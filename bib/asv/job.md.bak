### American Standard Version: Job

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> There was a man in the land of Uz, whose
name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared
God, and turned away from evil.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> And there were born unto him seven sons and
three daughters.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> His substance also was seven thousand
sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and
five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was
the greatest of all the children of the east.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> And his sons went and held a feast in the
house of each one upon his day; and they sent and called for their three
sisters to eat and to drink with them.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And it was so, when the days of their
feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up
early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the
number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned,
and renounced God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Now it came to pass on the day when the
sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan also
came among them.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> And Jehovah said unto Satan, Whence comest
thou? Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in
the earth, and from walking up and down in it.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou
considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a
perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from
evil.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Doth
Job fear God for nought?

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and
about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? thou hast
blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the
land.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> But put forth thy hand now, and touch all
that he hath, and he will renounce thee to thy face.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, all
that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand.
So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> And it fell on a day when his sons and
his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's
house,

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> that there came a messenger unto Job, and
said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them;

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> and the Sabeans fell \[upon them\], and
took them away: yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the
sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> While he was yet speaking, there came
also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath
burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am
escaped alone to tell thee.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> While he was yet speaking, there came
also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon
the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with
the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> While he was yet speaking, there came
also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and
drinking wine in their eldest brother's house;

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> and, behold, there came a great wind from
the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell
upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to
tell thee.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and
shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped;

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> and he said, Naked came I out of my
mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and
Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> In all this Job sinned not, nor charged
God foolishly.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Again it came to pass on the day when the
sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan came
also among them to present himself before Jehovah.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> And Jehovah said unto Satan, From whence
comest thou? And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro
in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou
considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a
perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from
evil: and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me
against him, to destroy him without cause.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin
for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> But put forth thy hand now, and touch his
bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, he is
in thy hand; only spare his life.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> So Satan went forth from the presence of
Jehovah, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto
his crown.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> And he took him a potsherd to scrape
himself therewith; and he sat among the ashes.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou
still hold fast thine integrity? renounce God, and die.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> But he said unto her, Thou speakest as
one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the
hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin
with his lips.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Now when Job's three friends heard of all
this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own
place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the
Naamathite, and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him
and to comfort him.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> And when they lifted up their eyes afar
off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they
rent every one his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward
heaven.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> So they sat down with him upon the ground
seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they
saw that his grief was very great.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed
his day.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> And Job answered and said:

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Let the day perish wherein I was born, And
the night which said, There is a man-child conceived.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Let that day be darkness; Let not God from
above seek for it, Neither let the light shine upon it.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Let darkness and the shadow of death claim
it for their own; Let a cloud dwell upon it; Let all that maketh black
the day terrify it.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> As for that night, let thick darkness seize
upon it: Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come
into the number of the months.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Lo, let that night be barren; Let no joyful
voice come therein.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Let them curse it that curse the day, Who
are ready to rouse up leviathan.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Let the stars of the twilight thereof be
dark: Let it look for light, but have none; Neither let it behold the
eyelids of the morning:

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> Because it shut not up the doors of my
\[mother's\] womb, Nor hid trouble from mine eyes.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Why died I not from the womb? Why did I
not give up the ghost when my mother bare me?

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Why did the knees receive me? Or why the
breast, that I should suck?

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> For now should I have lain down and been
quiet; I should have slept; then had I been at rest,

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> With kings and counsellors of the earth,
Who built up waste places for themselves;

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> Or with princes that had gold, Who filled
their houses with silver:

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not
been, As infants that never saw light.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> There the wicked cease from troubling;
And there the weary are at rest.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> There the prisoners are at ease together;
They hear not the voice of the taskmaster.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> The small and the great are there: And
the servant is free from his master.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> Wherefore is light given to him that is
in misery, And life unto the bitter in soul;

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> Who long for death, but it cometh not,
And dig for it more than for hid treasures;

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> Who rejoice exceedingly, And are glad,
when they can find the grave?

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> \[Why is light given\] to a man whose way
is hid, And whom God hath hedged in?

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> For my sighing cometh before I eat, And
my groanings are poured out like water.

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> For the thing which I fear cometh upon
me, And that which I am afraid of cometh unto me.

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> I am not at ease, neither am I quiet,
neither have I rest; But trouble cometh.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and
said,

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> If one assay to commune with thee, wilt
thou be grieved? But who can withhold himself from speaking?

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> Behold, thou hast instructed many, And thou
hast strengthened the weak hands.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Thy words have upholden him that was
falling, And thou hast made firm the feeble knees.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> But now it is come unto thee, and thou
faintest; It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> Is not thy fear \[of God\] thy confidence,
\[And\] the integrity of thy ways thy hope?

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> Remember, I pray thee, who \[ever\]
perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off?

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> According as I have seen, they that plow
iniquity, And sow trouble, reap the same.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> By the breath of God they perish, And by
the blast of his anger are they consumed.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of
the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions, are broken.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> The old lion perisheth for lack of prey,
And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> Now a thing was secretly brought to me,
And mine ear received a whisper thereof.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> In thoughts from the visions of the
night, When deep sleep falleth on men,

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> Fear came upon me, and trembling, Which
made all my bones to shake.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> Then a spirit passed before my face; The
hair of my flesh stood up.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> It stood still, but I could not discern
the appearance thereof; A form was before mine eyes: \[There was\]
silence, and I heard a voice, \[saying\],

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> Shall mortal man be more just than God?
Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> Behold, he putteth no trust in his
servants; And his angels he chargeth with folly:

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> How much more them that dwell in houses
of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, Who are crushed before the
moth!

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> Betwixt morning and evening they are
destroyed: They perish for ever without any regarding it.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> Is not their tent-cord plucked up within
them? They die, and that without wisdom.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Call now; is there any that will answer
thee? And to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> For vexation killeth the foolish man, And
jealousy slayeth the silly one.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> I have seen the foolish taking root: But
suddenly I cursed his habitation.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> His children are far from safety, And they
are crushed in the gate, Neither is there any to deliver them:

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, And
taketh it even out of the thorns; And the snare gapeth for their
substance.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> For affliction cometh not forth from the
dust, Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> But man is born unto trouble, As the sparks
fly upward.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> But as for me, I would seek unto God, And
unto God would I commit my cause;

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> Who doeth great things and unsearchable,
Marvellous things without number:

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> Who giveth rain upon the earth, And
sendeth waters upon the fields;

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> So that he setteth up on high those that
are low, And those that mourn are exalted to safety.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> He frustrateth the devices of the crafty,
So that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> He taketh the wise in their own
craftiness; And the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> They meet with darkness in the day-time,
And grope at noonday as in the night.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> But he saveth from the sword of their
mouth, Even the needy from the hand of the mighty.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> So the poor hath hope, And iniquity
stoppeth her mouth.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> Behold, happy is the man whom God
correcteth: Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> For he maketh sore, and bindeth up; He
woundeth, and his hands make whole.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> He will deliver thee in six troubles;
Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> In famine he will redeem thee from death;
And in war from the power of the sword.

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the
tongue; Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> At destruction and dearth thou shalt
laugh; Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> For thou shalt be in league with the
stones of the field; And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with
thee.

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> And thou shalt know that thy tent is in
peace; And thou shalt visit thy fold, and shalt miss nothing.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall
be great, And thine offspring as the grass of the earth.

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full
age, Like as a shock of grain cometh in in its season.

<span id="an_5:27">5:27</span> Lo this, we have searched it, so it is;
Hear it, and know thou it for thy good.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Then Job answered and said,

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Oh that my vexation were but weighed, And
all my calamity laid in the balances!

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> For now it would be heavier than the sand
of the seas: Therefore have my words been rash.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> For the arrows of the Almighty are within
me, The poison whereof my spirit drinketh up: The terrors of God do set
themselves in array against me.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass?
Or loweth the ox over his fodder?

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> Can that which hath no savor be eaten
without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> My soul refuseth to touch \[them\]; They
are as loathsome food to me.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> Oh that I might have my request; And that
God would grant \[me\] the thing that I long for!

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> Even that it would please God to crush me;
That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> And be it still my consolation, Yea, let
me exult in pain that spareth not, That I have not denied the words of
the Holy One.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> What is my strength, that I should wait?
And what is mine end, that I should be patient?

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> Is my strength the strength of stones? Or
is my flesh of brass?

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> Is it not that I have no help in me, And
that wisdom is driven quite from me?

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> To him that is ready to faint kindness
\[should be showed\] from his friend; Even to him that forsaketh the
fear of the Almighty.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a
brook, As the channel of brooks that pass away;

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> Which are black by reason of the ice,
\[And\] wherein the snow hideth itself:

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> What time they wax warm, they vanish;
When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> The caravans \[that travel\] by the way
of them turn aside; They go up into the waste, and perish.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> The caravans of Tema looked, The
companies of Sheba waited for them.

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> They were put to shame because they had
hoped; They came thither, and were confounded.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> For now ye are nothing; Ye see a terror,
and are afraid.

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> Did I say, Give unto me? Or, Offer a
present for me of your substance?

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> Or, Deliver me from the adversary's hand?
Or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> Teach me, and I will hold my peace; And
cause me to understand wherein I have erred.

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> How forcible are words of uprightness!
But your reproof, what doth it reprove?

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> Do ye think to reprove words, Seeing that
the speeches of one that is desperate are as wind?

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> Yea, ye would cast \[lots\] upon the
fatherless, And make merchandise of your friend.

<span id="an_6:28">6:28</span> Now therefore be pleased to look upon me;
For surely I shall not lie to your face.

<span id="an_6:29">6:29</span> Return, I pray you, let there be no
injustice; Yea, return again, my cause is righteous.

<span id="an_6:30">6:30</span> Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot
my taste discern mischievous things?

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> Is there not a warfare to man upon earth?
And are not his days like the days of a hireling?

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> As a servant that earnestly desireth the
shadow, And as a hireling that looketh for his wages:

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> So am I made to possess months of misery,
And wearisome nights are appointed to me.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise,
and the night be gone? And I am full of tossings to and fro unto the
dawning of the day.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of
dust; My skin closeth up, and breaketh out afresh.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> My days are swifter than a weaver's
shuttle, And are spent without hope.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> Oh remember that my life is a breath: Mine
eye shall no more see good.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> The eye of him that seeth me shall behold
me no more; Thine eyes shall be upon me, but I shall not be.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth
away, So he that goeth down to Sheol shall come up no more.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> He shall return no more to his house,
Neither shall his place know him any more.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I
will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the
bitterness of my soul.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, That thou
settest a watch over me?

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> When I say, My bed shall comfort me, My
couch shall ease my complaint;

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> Then thou scarest me with dreams, And
terrifiest me through visions:

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> So that my soul chooseth strangling, And
death rather than \[these\] my bones.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> I loathe \[my life\]; I would not live
alway: Let me alone; for my days are vanity.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> What is man, that thou shouldest magnify
him, And that thou shouldest set thy mind upon him,

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> And that thou shouldest visit him every
morning, And try him every moment?

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> How long wilt thou not look away from me,
Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> If I have sinned, what do I unto thee, O
thou watcher of men? Why hast thou set me as a mark for thee, So that I
am a burden to myself?

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> And why dost thou not pardon my
transgression, and take away mine iniquity? For now shall I lie down in
the dust; And thou wilt seek me diligently, but I shall not be.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> How long wilt thou speak these things? And
\[how long\] shall the words of thy mouth be \[like\] a mighty wind?

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> Doth God pervert justice? Or doth the
Almighty pervert righteousness?

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> If thy children have sinned against him,
And he hath delivered them into the hand of their transgression;

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> If thou wouldest seek diligently unto God,
And make thy supplication to the Almighty;

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> If thou wert pure and upright: Surely now
he would awake for thee, And make the habitation of thy righteousness
prosperous.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> And though thy beginning was small, Yet thy
latter end would greatly increase.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> For inquire, I pray thee, of the former
age, And apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out:

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> (For we are but of yesterday, and know
nothing, Because our days upon earth are a shadow);

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee,
And utter words out of their heart?

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> Can the rush grow up without mire? Can
the flag grow without water?

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> Whilst it is yet in its greenness,
\[and\] not cut down, It withereth before any \[other\] herb.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> So are the paths of all that forget God;
And the hope of the godless man shall perish:

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> Whose confidence shall break in sunder,
And whose trust is a spider's web.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> He shall lean upon his house, but it
shall not stand: He shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> He is green before the sun, And his
shoots go forth over his garden.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> His roots are wrapped about the \[stone\]
-heap, He beholdeth the place of stones.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> If he be destroyed from his place, Then
it shall deny him, \[saying\], I have not seen thee.

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> Behold, this is the joy of his way; And
out of the earth shall others spring.

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> Behold, God will not cast away a perfect
man, Neither will he uphold the evil-doers.

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> He will yet fill thy mouth with laughter,
And thy lips with shouting.

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> They that hate thee shall be clothed with
shame; And the tent of the wicked shall be no more.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> Then Job answered and said,

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> Of a truth I know that it is so: But how
can man be just with God?

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> If he be pleased to contend with him, He
cannot answer him one of a thousand.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> \[He is\] wise in heart, and mighty in
strength: Who hath hardened himself against him, and prospered?-

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> \[Him\] that removeth the mountains, and
they know it not, When he overturneth them in his anger;

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> That shaketh the earth out of its place,
And the pillars thereof tremble;

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> That commandeth the sun, and it riseth not,
And sealeth up the stars;

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> That alone stretcheth out the heavens, And
treadeth upon the waves of the sea;

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> That maketh the Bear, Orion, and the
Pleiades, And the chambers of the south;

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> That doeth great things past finding out,
Yea, marvellous things without number.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: He
passeth on also, but I perceive him not.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> Behold, he seizeth \[the prey\], who can
hinder him? Who will say unto him, What doest thou?

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> God will not withdraw his anger; The
helpers of Rahab do stoop under him.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> How much less shall I answer him, And
choose out my words \[to reason\] with him?

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> Whom, though I were righteous, yet would
I not answer; I would make supplication to my judge.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> If I had called, and he had answered me,
Yet would I not believe that he hearkened unto my voice.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> For he breaketh me with a tempest, And
multiplieth my wounds without cause.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> He will not suffer me to take my breath,
But filleth me with bitterness.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> If \[we speak\] of strength, lo, \[he
is\] mighty! And if of justice, Who, \[saith he\], will summon me?

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> Though I be righteous, mine own mouth
shall condemn me: Though I be perfect, it shall prove me perverse.

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> I am perfect; I regard not myself; I
despise my life.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> It is all one; therefore I say, He
destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> If the scourge slay suddenly, He will
mock at the trial of the innocent.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> The earth is given into the hand of the
wicked; He covereth the faces of the judges thereof: If \[it be\] not
\[he\], who then is it?

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> Now my days are swifter than a post: They
flee away, they see no good,

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> They are passed away as the swift ships;
As the eagle that swoopeth on the prey.

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> If I say, I will forget my complaint, I
will put off my \[sad\] countenance, and be of good cheer;

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know
that thou wilt not hold me innocent.

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> I shall be condemned; Why then do I labor
in vain?

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> If I wash myself with snow water, And
make my hands never so clean;

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch, And
mine own clothes shall abhor me.

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> For he is not a man, as I am, that I
should answer him, That we should come together in judgment.

<span id="an_9:33">9:33</span> There is no umpire betwixt us, That might
lay his hand upon us both.

<span id="an_9:34">9:34</span> Let him take his rod away from me, And
let not his terror make me afraid:

<span id="an_9:35">9:35</span> Then would I speak, and not fear him; For
I am not so in myself.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> My soul is weary of my life; I will give
free course to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> I will say unto God, Do not condemn me;
Show me wherefore thou contendest with me.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest
oppress, That thou shouldest despise the work of thy hands, And shine
upon the counsel of the wicked?

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> Hast thou eyes of flesh? Or seest thou as
man seeth?

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> Are thy days as the days of man, Or thy
years as man's days,

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> That thou inquirest after mine iniquity,
And searchest after my sin,

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> Although thou knowest that I am not
wicked, And there is none that can deliver out of thy hand?

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> Thy hands have framed me and fashioned me
Together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast
fashioned me as clay; And wilt thou bring me into dust again?

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> Hast thou not poured me out as milk,
And curdled me like cheese?

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> Thou hast clothed me with skin and
flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> Thou hast granted me life and
lovingkindness; And thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> Yet these things thou didst hide in thy
heart; I know that this is with thee:

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> If I sin, then thou markest me, And
thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> If I be wicked, woe unto me; And if I
be righteous, yet shall I not lift up my head; Being filled with
ignominy, And looking upon mine affliction.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> And if \[my head\] exalt itself, thou
huntest me as a lion; And again thou showest thyself marvellous upon me.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> Thou renewest thy witnesses against me,
And increasest thine indignation upon me: Changes and warfare are with
me.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> Wherefore then hast thou brought me
forth out of the womb? I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> I should have been as though I had not
been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> Are not my days few? cease then, And
let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> Before I go whence I shall not return,
\[Even\] to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> The land dark as midnight, \[The land\]
of the shadow of death, without any order, And where the light is as
midnight.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and
said,

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> Should not the multitude of words be
answered? And should a man full of talk be justified?

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> Should thy boastings make men hold their
peace? And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> For thou sayest, My doctrine is pure, And
I am clean in thine eyes.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> But oh that God would speak, And open his
lips against thee,

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> And that he would show thee the secrets
of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know therefore that God
exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> Canst thou by searching find out God?
Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> It is high as heaven; what canst thou do?
Deeper than Sheol; what canst thou know?

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> The measure thereof is longer than the
earth, And broader than the sea.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> If he pass through, and shut up, And
all unto judgment, then who can hinder him?

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> For he knoweth false men: He seeth
iniquity also, even though he consider it not.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> But vain man is void of understanding,
Yea, man is born \[as\] a wild ass's colt.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> If thou set thy heart aright, And
stretch out thy hands toward him;

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far
away, And let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face
without spot; Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> For thou shalt forget thy misery; Thou
shalt remember it as waters that are passed away,

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> And \[thy\] life shall be clearer than
the noonday; Though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> And thou shalt be secure, because there
is hope; Yea, thou shalt search \[about thee\], and shalt take thy rest
in safety.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> Also thou shalt lie down, and none
shall make thee afraid; Yea, many shall make suit unto thee.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> But the eyes of the wicked shall fail,
And they shall have no way to flee; And their hope shall be the giving
up of the ghost.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> Then Job answered and said,

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> No doubt but ye are the people, And
wisdom shall die with you.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> But I have understanding as well as you;
I am not inferior to you: Yea, who knoweth not such things as these?

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> I am as one that is a laughing-stock to
his neighbor, I who called upon God, and he answered: The just, the
perfect man is a laughing-stock.

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> In the thought of him that is at ease
there is contempt for misfortune; It is ready for them whose foot
slippeth.

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> The tents of robbers prosper, And they
that provoke God are secure; Into whose hand God bringeth
\[abundantly\].

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> But ask now the beasts, and they shall
teach thee; And the birds of the heavens, and they shall tell thee:

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach
thee; And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> Who knoweth not in all these, That the
hand of Jehovah hath wrought this,

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> In whose hand is the soul of every
living thing, And the breath of all mankind?

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> Doth not the ear try words, Even as the
palate tasteth its food?

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> With aged men is wisdom, And in length
of days understanding.

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> With \[God\] is wisdom and might; He
hath counsel and understanding.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot
be built again; He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and
they dry up; Again, he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> With him is strength and wisdom; The
deceived and the deceiver are his.

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> He leadeth counsellors away stripped,
And judges maketh he fools.

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> He looseth the bond of kings, And he
bindeth their loins with a girdle.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> He leadeth priests away stripped, And
overthroweth the mighty.

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> He removeth the speech of the trusty,
And taketh away the understanding of the elders.

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> He poureth contempt upon princes, And
looseth the belt of the strong.

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> He uncovereth deep things out of
darkness, And bringeth out to light the shadow of death.

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> He increaseth the nations, and he
destroyeth them: He enlargeth the nations, and he leadeth them captive.

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> He taketh away understanding from the
chiefs of the people of the earth, And causeth them to wander in a
wilderness where there is no way.

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> They grope in the dark without light;
And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> Lo, mine eye hath seen all \[this\], Mine
ear hath heard and understood it.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> What ye know, \[the same\] do I know
also: I am not inferior unto you.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> Surely I would speak to the Almighty, And
I desire to reason with God.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> But ye are forgers of lies; Ye are all
physicians of no value.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> Oh that ye would altogether hold your
peace! And it would be your wisdom.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> Hear now my reasoning, And hearken to the
pleadings of my lips.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> Will ye speak unrighteously for God, And
talk deceitfully for him?

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> Will ye show partiality to him? Will ye
contend for God?

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> Is it good that he should search you out?
Or as one deceiveth a man, will ye deceive him?

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> He will surely reprove you If ye do
secretly show partiality.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> Shall not his majesty make you afraid,
And his dread fall upon you?

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> Your memorable sayings are proverbs of
ashes, Your defences are defences of clay.

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> Hold your peace, let me alone, that I
may speak; And let come on me what will.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> Wherefore should I take my flesh in my
teeth, And put my life in my hand?

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> Behold, he will slay me; I have no
hope: Nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> This also shall be my salvation, That a
godless man shall not come before him.

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> Hear diligently my speech, And let my
declaration be in your ears.

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> Behold now, I have set my cause in
order; I know that I am righteous.

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> Who is he that will contend with me?
For then would I hold my peace and give up the ghost.

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> Only do not two things unto me; Then
will I not hide myself from thy face:

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> Withdraw thy hand far from me; And let
not thy terror make me afraid.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> Then call thou, and I will answer; Or
let me speak, and answer thou me.

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> How many are mine iniquities and sins?
Make me to know my transgression and my sin.

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> Wherefore hidest thou thy face, And
holdest me for thine enemy?

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> Wilt thou harass a driven leaf? And
wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?

<span id="an_13:26">13:26</span> For thou writest bitter things against
me, And makest me to inherit the iniquities of my youth:

<span id="an_13:27">13:27</span> Thou puttest my feet also in the
stocks, And markest all my paths; Thou settest a bound to the soles of
my feet:

<span id="an_13:28">13:28</span> Though I am like a rotten thing that
consumeth, Like a garment that is moth-eaten.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> Man, that is born of a woman, Is of few
days, and full of trouble.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut
down: He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> And dost thou open thine eyes upon such a
one, And bringest me into judgment with thee?

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> Who can bring a clean thing out of an
unclean? not one.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> Seeing his days are determined, The
number of his months is with thee, And thou hast appointed his bounds
that he cannot pass;

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> Look away from him, that he may rest,
Till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> For there is hope of a tree, If it be cut
down, that it will sprout again, And that the tender branch thereof will
not cease.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> Though the root thereof wax old in the
earth, And the stock thereof die in the ground;

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> Yet through the scent of water it will
bud, And put forth boughs like a plant.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> But man dieth, and is laid low: Yea,
man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> \[As\] the waters fail from the sea,
And the river wasteth and drieth up;

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> So man lieth down and riseth not: Till
the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, Nor be roused out of their
sleep.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> Oh that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol,
That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, That thou
wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> If a man die, shall he live \[again\]?
All the days of my warfare would I wait, Till my release should come.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> Thou wouldest call, and I would answer
thee: Thou wouldest have a desire to the work of thy hands.

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> But now thou numberest my steps: Dost
thou not watch over my sin?

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> My transgression is sealed up in a bag,
And thou fastenest up mine iniquity.

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> But the mountain falling cometh to
nought; And the rock is removed out of its place;

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> The waters wear the stones; The
overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth: So thou destroyest
the hope of man.

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> Thou prevailest for ever against him,
and he passeth; Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> His sons come to honor, and he knoweth
it not; And they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> But his flesh upon him hath pain, And
his soul within him mourneth.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and
said,

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> Should a wise man make answer with vain
knowledge, And fill himself with the east wind?

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> Should he reason with unprofitable talk,
Or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> Yea, thou doest away with fear, And
hinderest devotion before God.

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> For thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth,
And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not
I; Yea, thine own lips testify against thee.

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> Art thou the first man that was born? Or
wast thou brought forth before the hills?

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> Hast thou heard the secret counsel of
God? And dost thou limit wisdom to thyself?

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> What knowest thou, that we know not? What
understandest thou, which is not in us?

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> With us are both the gray-headed and
the very aged men, Much elder than thy father.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> Are the consolations of God too small
for thee, Even the word that is gentle toward thee?

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> Why doth thy heart carry thee away? And
why do thine eyes flash,

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> That against God thou turnest thy
spirit, And lettest words go out of thy mouth?

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> What is man, that he should be clean?
And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> Behold, he putteth no trust in his holy
ones; Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight:

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> How much less one that is abominable
and corrupt, A man that drinketh iniquity like water!

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> I will show thee, hear thou me; And
that which I have seen I will declare:

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> (Which wise men have told From their
fathers, and have not hid it;

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> Unto whom alone the land was given, And
no stranger passed among them):

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> The wicked man travaileth with pain all
his days, Even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> A sound of terrors is in his ears; In
prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> He believeth not that he shall return
out of darkness, And he is waited for of the sword.

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> He wandereth abroad for bread,
\[saying\], Where is it? He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at
his hand.

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> Distress and anguish make him afraid;
They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> Because he hath stretched out his hand
against God, And behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty;

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> He runneth upon him with a \[stiff\]
neck, With the thick bosses of his bucklers;

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> Because he hath covered his face with
his fatness, And gathered fat upon his loins;

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> And he hath dwelt in desolate cities,
In houses which no man inhabited, Which were ready to become heaps;

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> He shall not be rich, neither shall his
substance continue, Neither shall their possessions be extended on the
earth.

<span id="an_15:30">15:30</span> He shall not depart out of darkness;
The flame shall dry up his branches, And by the breath of \[God's\]
mouth shall he go away.

<span id="an_15:31">15:31</span> Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving
himself; For vanity shall be his recompense.

<span id="an_15:32">15:32</span> It shall be accomplished before his
time, And his branch shall not be green.

<span id="an_15:33">15:33</span> He shall shake off his unripe grape as
the vine, And shall cast off his flower as the olive-tree.

<span id="an_15:34">15:34</span> For the company of the godless shall be
barren, And fire shall consume the tents of bribery.

<span id="an_15:35">15:35</span> They conceive mischief, and bring forth
iniquity, And their heart prepareth deceit.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> Then Job answered and said,

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> I have heard many such things: Miserable
comforters are ye all.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> Shall vain words have an end? Or what
provoketh thee that thou answerest?

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> I also could speak as ye do; If your soul
were in my soul's stead, I could join words together against you, And
shake my head at you.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> \[But\] I would strengthen you with my
mouth, And the solace of my lips would assuage \[your grief\].

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged;
And though I forbear, what am I eased?

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> But now he hath made me weary: Thou hast
made desolate all my company.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> And thou hast laid fast hold on me,
\[which\] is a witness \[against me\]: And my leanness riseth up against
me, It testifieth to my face.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> He hath torn me in his wrath, and
persecuted me; He hath gnashed upon me with his teeth: Mine adversary
sharpeneth his eyes upon me.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> They have gaped upon me with their
mouth; They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully: They gather
themselves together against me.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> God delivereth me to the ungodly, And
casteth me into the hands of the wicked.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> I was at ease, and he brake me asunder;
Yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces: He hath also
set me up for his mark.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> His archers compass me round about; He
cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; He poureth out my gall
upon the ground.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> He breaketh me with breach upon breach;
He runneth upon me like a giant.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin,
And have laid my horn in the dust.

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> My face is red with weeping, And on my
eyelids is the shadow of death;

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> Although there is no violence in my
hands, And my prayer is pure.

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> O earth, cover not thou my blood, And
let my cry have no \[resting\] -place.

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> Even now, behold, my witness is in
heaven, And he that voucheth for me is on high.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> My friends scoff at me: \[But\] mine
eye poureth out tears unto God,

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> That he would maintain the right of a
man with God, And of a son of man with his neighbor!

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> For when a few years are come, I shall
go the way whence I shall not return.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> My spirit is consumed, my days are
extinct, The grave is \[ready\] for me.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> Surely there are mockers with me, And
mine eye dwelleth upon their provocation.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> Give now a pledge, be surety for me with
thyself; Who is there that will strike hands with me?

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> For thou hast hid their heart from
understanding: Therefore shalt thou not exalt \[them\].

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> He that denounceth his friends for a
prey, Even the eyes of his children shall fail.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> But he hath made me a byword of the
people; And they spit in my face.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow,
And all my members are as a shadow.

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> Upright men shall be astonished at this,
And the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> Yet shall the righteous hold on his way,
And he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> But as for you all, come on now again;
And I shall not find a wise man among you.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> My days are past, my purposes are
broken off, Even the thoughts of my heart.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> They change the night into day: The
light, \[say they\], is near unto the darkness.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> If I look for Sheol as my house; If I
have spread my couch in the darkness;

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> If I have said to corruption, Thou art
my father; To the worm, \[Thou art\] my mother, and my sister;

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> Where then is my hope? And as for my
hope, who shall see it?

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> It shall go down to the bars of Sheol,
When once there is rest in the dust.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and
said,

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> How long will ye hunt for words?
Consider, and afterwards we will speak.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> Wherefore are we counted as beasts,
\[And\] are become unclean in your sight?

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger,
Shall the earth be forsaken for thee? Or shall the rock be removed out
of its place?

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put
out, And the spark of his fire shall not shine.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> The light shall be dark in his tent, And
his lamp above him shall be put out.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> The steps of his strength shall be
straitened, And his own counsel shall cast him down.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> For he is cast into a net by his own
feet, And he walketh upon the toils.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> A gin shall take \[him\] by the heel,
\[And\] a snare shall lay hold on him.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> A noose is hid for him in the ground,
And a trap for him in the way.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> Terrors shall make him afraid on every
side, And shall chase him at his heels.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> His strength shall be hunger-bitten,
And calamity shall be ready at his side.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> The members of his body shall be
devoured, \[Yea\], the first-born of death shall devour his members.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> He shall be rooted out of his tent
where he trusteth; And he shall be brought to the king of terrors.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> There shall dwell in his tent that
which is none of his: Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> His roots shall be dried up beneath,
And above shall his branch be cut off.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> His remembrance shall perish from the
earth, And he shall have no name in the street.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> He shall be driven from light into
darkness, And chased out of the world.

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> He shall have neither son nor son's son
among his people, Nor any remaining where he sojourned.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> They that come after shall be
astonished at his day, As they that went before were affrighted.

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> Surely such are the dwellings of the
unrighteous, And this is the place of him that knoweth not God.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> Then Job answered and said,

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> How long will ye vex my soul, And break
me in pieces with words?

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> These ten times have ye reproached me: Ye
are not ashamed that ye deal hardly with me.

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> And be it indeed that I have erred, Mine
error remaineth with myself.

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> If indeed ye will magnify yourselves
against me, And plead against me my reproach;

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> Know now that God hath subverted me \[in
my cause\], And hath compassed me with his net.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not
heard: I cry for help, but there is no justice.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> He hath walled up my way that I cannot
pass, And hath set darkness in my paths.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> He hath stripped me of my glory, And
taken the crown from my head.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> He hath broken me down on every side,
and I am gone; And my hope hath he plucked up like a tree.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> He hath also kindled his wrath against
me, And he counteth me unto him as \[one of\] his adversaries.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> His troops come on together, And cast
up their way against me, And encamp round about my tent.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> He hath put my brethren far from me,
And mine acquaintance are wholly estranged from me.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> My kinsfolk have failed, And my
familiar friends have forgotten me.

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> They that dwell in my house, and my
maids, count me for a stranger; I am an alien in their sight.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> I call unto my servant, and he giveth
me no answer, \[Though\] I entreat him with my mouth.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> My breath is strange to my wife, And my
supplication to the children of mine own mother.

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> Even young children despise me; If I
arise, they speak against me.

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> All my familiar friends abhor me, And
they whom I loved are turned against me.

<span id="an_19:20">19:20</span> My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my
flesh, And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.

<span id="an_19:21">19:21</span> Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O
ye my friends; For the hand of God hath touched me.

<span id="an_19:22">19:22</span> Why do ye persecute me as God, And are
not satisfied with my flesh?

<span id="an_19:23">19:23</span> Oh that my words were now written! Oh
that they were inscribed in a book!

<span id="an_19:24">19:24</span> That with an iron pen and lead They
were graven in the rock for ever!

<span id="an_19:25">19:25</span> But as for me I know that my Redeemer
liveth, And at last he will stand up upon the earth:

<span id="an_19:26">19:26</span> And after my skin, \[even\] this
\[body\], is destroyed, Then without my flesh shall I see God;

<span id="an_19:27">19:27</span> Whom I, even I, shall see, on my side,
And mine eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger. My heart is consumed
within me.

<span id="an_19:28">19:28</span> If ye say, How we will persecute him!
And that the root of the matter is found in me;

<span id="an_19:29">19:29</span> Be ye afraid of the sword: For wrath
\[bringeth\] the punishments of the sword, That ye may know there is a
judgment.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and
said,

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> Therefore do my thoughts give answer to
me, Even by reason of my haste that is in me.

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> I have heard the reproof which putteth me
to shame; And the spirit of my understanding answereth me.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> Knowest thou \[not\] this of old time,
Since man was placed upon earth,

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> That the triumphing of the wicked is
short, And the joy of the godless but for a moment?

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> Though his height mount up to the
heavens, And his head reach unto the clouds;

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> Yet he shall perish for ever like his own
dung: They that have seen him shall say, Where is he?

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> He shall fly away as a dream, and shall
not be found: Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> The eye which saw him shall see him no
more; Neither shall his place any more behold him.

<span id="an_20:10">20:10</span> His children shall seek the favor of
the poor, And his hands shall give back his wealth.

<span id="an_20:11">20:11</span> His bones are full of his youth, But it
shall lie down with him in the dust.

<span id="an_20:12">20:12</span> Though wickedness be sweet in his
mouth, Though he hide it under his tongue,

<span id="an_20:13">20:13</span> Though he spare it, and will not let it
go, But keep it still within his mouth;

<span id="an_20:14">20:14</span> Yet his food in his bowels is turned,
It is the gall of asps within him.

<span id="an_20:15">20:15</span> He hath swallowed down riches, and he
shall vomit them up again; God will cast them out of his belly.

<span id="an_20:16">20:16</span> He shall suck the poison of asps: The
viper's tongue shall slay him.

<span id="an_20:17">20:17</span> He shall not look upon the rivers, The
flowing streams of honey and butter.

<span id="an_20:18">20:18</span> That which he labored for shall he
restore, and shall not swallow it down; According to the substance that
he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice.

<span id="an_20:19">20:19</span> For he hath oppressed and forsaken the
poor; He hath violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it
up.

<span id="an_20:20">20:20</span> Because he knew no quietness within
him, He shall not save aught of that wherein he delighteth.

<span id="an_20:21">20:21</span> There was nothing left that he devoured
not; Therefore his prosperity shall not endure.

<span id="an_20:22">20:22</span> In the fulness of his sufficiency he
shall be in straits: The hand of every one that is in misery shall come
upon him.

<span id="an_20:23">20:23</span> When he is about to fill his belly,
\[God\] will cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him, And will rain it
upon him while he is eating.

<span id="an_20:24">20:24</span> He shall flee from the iron weapon, And
the bow of brass shall strike him through.

<span id="an_20:25">20:25</span> He draweth it forth, and it cometh out
of his body; Yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall: Terrors
are upon him.

<span id="an_20:26">20:26</span> All darkness is laid up for his
treasures: A fire not blown \[by man\] shall devour him; It shall
consume that which is left in his tent.

<span id="an_20:27">20:27</span> The heavens shall reveal his iniquity,
And the earth shall rise up against him.

<span id="an_20:28">20:28</span> The increase of his house shall depart;
\[His goods\] shall flow away in the day of his wrath.

<span id="an_20:29">20:29</span> This is the portion of a wicked man
from God, And the heritage appointed unto him by God.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> Then Job answered and said,

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> Hear diligently my speech; And let this
be your consolations.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> Suffer me, and I also will speak; And
after that I have spoken, mock on.

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> As for me, is my complaint to man? And
why should I not be impatient?

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> Mark me, and be astonished, And lay your
hand upon your mouth.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> Even when I remember I am troubled, And
horror taketh hold on my flesh.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> Wherefore do the wicked live, Become old,
yea, wax mighty in power?

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> Their seed is established with them in
their sight, And their offspring before their eyes.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> Their houses are safe from fear, Neither
is the rod of God upon them.

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> Their bull gendereth, and faileth not;
Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> They send forth their little ones like
a flock, And their children dance.

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> They sing to the timbrel and harp, And
rejoice at the sound of the pipe.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> They spend their days in prosperity,
And in a moment they go down to Sheol.

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> And they say unto God, Depart from us;
For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> What is the Almighty, that we should
serve him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> Lo, their prosperity is not in their
hand: The counsel of the wicked is far from me.

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> How oft is it that the lamp of the
wicked is put out? That their calamity cometh upon them? That \[God\]
distributeth sorrows in his anger?

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> That they are as stubble before the
wind, And as chaff that the storm carrieth away?

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> \[Ye say\], God layeth up his iniquity
for his children. Let him recompense it unto himself, that he may know
it:

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> Let his own eyes see his destruction,
And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> For what careth he for his house after
him, When the number of his months is cut off?

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> Shall any teach God knowledge, Seeing
he judgeth those that are high?

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> One dieth in his full strength, Being
wholly at ease and quiet:

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> His pails are full of milk, And the
marrow of his bones is moistened.

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> And another dieth in bitterness of
soul, And never tasteth of good.

<span id="an_21:26">21:26</span> They lie down alike in the dust, And
the worm covereth them.

<span id="an_21:27">21:27</span> Behold, I know your thoughts, And the
devices wherewith ye would wrong me.

<span id="an_21:28">21:28</span> For ye say, Where is the house of the
prince? And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?

<span id="an_21:29">21:29</span> Have ye not asked wayfaring men? And do
ye not know their evidences,

<span id="an_21:30">21:30</span> That the evil man is reserved to the
day of calamity? That they are led forth to the day of wrath?

<span id="an_21:31">21:31</span> Who shall declare his way to his face?
And who shall repay him what he hath done?

<span id="an_21:32">21:32</span> Yet shall he be borne to the grave, And
men shall keep watch over the tomb.

<span id="an_21:33">21:33</span> The clods of the valley shall be sweet
unto him, And all men shall draw after him, As there were innumerable
before him.

<span id="an_21:34">21:34</span> How then comfort ye me in vain, Seeing
in your answers there remaineth \[only\] falsehood?

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and
said,

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> Can a man be profitable unto God? Surely
he that is wise is profitable unto himself.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that
thou art righteous? Or is it gain \[to him\], that thou makest thy ways
perfect?

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> Is it for thy fear \[of him\] that he
reproveth thee, That he entereth with thee into judgment?

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> Is not thy wickedness great? Neither is
there any end to thine iniquities.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> For thou hast taken pledges of thy
brother for nought, And stripped the naked of their clothing.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> Thou hast not given water to the weary to
drink, And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> But as for the mighty man, he had the
earth; And the honorable man, he dwelt in it.

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> Thou hast sent widows away empty, And the
arms of the fatherless have been broken.

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> Therefore snares are round about thee,
And sudden fear troubleth thee,

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> Or darkness, so that thou canst not
see, And abundance of waters cover thee.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> Is not God in the height of heaven? And
behold the height of the stars, how high they are!

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> And thou sayest, What doth God know?
Can he judge through the thick darkness?

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> Thick clouds are a covering to him, so
that he seeth not; And he walketh on the vault of heaven.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> Wilt thou keep the old way Which wicked
men have trodden?

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> Who were snatched away before their
time, Whose foundation was poured out as a stream,

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> Who said unto God, Depart from us; And,
What can the Almighty do for us?

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> Yet he filled their houses with good
things: But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> The righteous see it, and are glad; And
the innocent laugh them to scorn,

<span id="an_22:20">22:20</span> \[Saying\], Surely they that did rise
up against us are cut off, And the remnant of them the fire hath
consumed.

<span id="an_22:21">22:21</span> Acquaint now thyself with him, and be
at peace: Thereby good shall come unto thee.

<span id="an_22:22">22:22</span> Receive, I pray thee, the law from his
mouth, And lay up his words in thy heart.

<span id="an_22:23">22:23</span> If thou return to the Almighty, thou
shalt be built up, If thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents.

<span id="an_22:24">22:24</span> And lay thou \[thy\] treasure in the
dust, And \[the gold of\] Ophir among the stones of the brooks;

<span id="an_22:25">22:25</span> And the Almighty will be thy treasure,
And precious silver unto thee.

<span id="an_22:26">22:26</span> For then shalt thou delight thyself in
the Almighty, And shalt lift up thy face unto God.

<span id="an_22:27">22:27</span> Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him,
and he will hear thee; And thou shalt pay thy vows.

<span id="an_22:28">22:28</span> Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it
shall be established unto thee; And light shall shine upon thy ways.

<span id="an_22:29">22:29</span> When they cast \[thee\] down, thou
shalt say, \[There is\] lifting up; And the humble person he will save.

<span id="an_22:30">22:30</span> He will deliver \[even\] him that is
not innocent: Yea, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thy
hands.

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> Then Job answered and said,

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> Even to-day is my complaint rebellious:
My stroke is heavier than my groaning.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> Oh that I knew where I might find him!
That I might come even to his seat!

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> I would set my cause in order before him,
And fill my mouth with arguments.

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> I would know the words which he would
answer me, And understand what he would say unto me.

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> Would he contend with me in the greatness
of his power? Nay; but he would give heed unto me.

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> There the upright might reason with him;
So should I be delivered for ever from my judge.

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> Behold, I go forward, but he is not
\[there\]; And backward, but I cannot perceive him;

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> On the left hand, when he doth work, but
I cannot behold him; He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot
see him.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> But he knoweth the way that I take;
When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> My foot hath held fast to his steps;
His way have I kept, and turned not aside.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> I have not gone back from the
commandment of his lips; I have treasured up the words of his mouth more
than my necessary food.

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> But he is in one \[mind\], and who can
turn him? And what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> For he performeth that which is
appointed for me: And many such things are with him.

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> Therefore am I terrified at his
presence; When I consider, I am afraid of him.

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> For God hath made my heart faint, And
the Almighty hath terrified me;

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> Because I was not cut off before the
darkness, Neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> Why are times not laid up by the
Almighty? And why do not they that know him see his days?

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> There are that remove the landmarks; They
violently take away flocks, and feed them.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> They drive away the ass of the
fatherless; They take the widow's ox for a pledge.

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> They turn the needy out of the way: The
poor of the earth all hide themselves.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> Behold, as wild asses in the desert They
go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food; The wilderness
\[yieldeth\] them bread for their children.

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> They cut their provender in the field;
And they glean the vintage of the wicked.

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> They lie all night naked without
clothing, And have no covering in the cold.

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> They are wet with the showers of the
mountains, And embrace the rock for want of a shelter.

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> There are that pluck the fatherless from
the breast, And take a pledge of the poor;

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> \[So that\] they go about naked without
clothing, And being hungry they carry the sheaves.

<span id="an_24:11">24:11</span> They make oil within the walls of these
men; They tread \[their\] winepresses, and suffer thirst.

<span id="an_24:12">24:12</span> From out of the populous city men
groan, And the soul of the wounded crieth out: Yet God regardeth not the
folly.

<span id="an_24:13">24:13</span> These are of them that rebel against
the light; They know not the ways thereof, Nor abide in the paths
thereof.

<span id="an_24:14">24:14</span> The murderer riseth with the light; He
killeth the poor and needy; And in the night he is as a thief.

<span id="an_24:15">24:15</span> The eye also of the adulterer waiteth
for the twilight, Saying, No eye shall see me: And he disguiseth his
face.

<span id="an_24:16">24:16</span> In the dark they dig through houses:
They shut themselves up in the day-time; They know not the light.

<span id="an_24:17">24:17</span> For the morning is to all of them as
thick darkness; For they know the terrors of the thick darkness.

<span id="an_24:18">24:18</span> Swiftly they \[pass away\] upon the
face of the waters; Their portion is cursed in the earth: They turn not
into the way of the vineyards.

<span id="an_24:19">24:19</span> Drought and heat consume the snow
waters: \[So doth\] Sheol \[those that\] have sinned.

<span id="an_24:20">24:20</span> The womb shall forget him; The worm
shall feed sweetly on him; He shall be no more remembered; And
unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree.

<span id="an_24:21">24:21</span> He devoureth the barren that beareth
not, And doeth not good to the widow.

<span id="an_24:22">24:22</span> Yet \[God\] preserveth the mighty by
his power: He riseth up that hath no assurance of life.

<span id="an_24:23">24:23</span> \[God\] giveth them to be in security,
and they rest thereon; And his eyes are upon their ways.

<span id="an_24:24">24:24</span> They are exalted; yet a little while,
and they are gone; Yea, they are brought low, they are taken out of the
way as all others, And are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.

<span id="an_24:25">24:25</span> And if it be not so now, who will prove
me a liar, And make my speech nothing worth?

<span id="an_25:1">25:1</span> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and
said,

<span id="an_25:2">25:2</span> Dominion and fear are with him; He maketh
peace in his high places.

<span id="an_25:3">25:3</span> Is there any number of his armies? And
upon whom doth not his light arise?

<span id="an_25:4">25:4</span> How then can man be just with God? Or how
can he be clean that is born of a woman?

<span id="an_25:5">25:5</span> Behold, even the moon hath no brightness,
And the stars are not pure in his sight:

<span id="an_25:6">25:6</span> How much less man, that is a worm! And
the son of man, that is a worm!

<span id="an_26:1">26:1</span> Then Job answered and said,

<span id="an_26:2">26:2</span> How hast thou helped him that is without
power! How hast thou saved the arm that hath no strength!

<span id="an_26:3">26:3</span> How hast thou counselled him that hath no
wisdom, And plentifully declared sound knowledge!

<span id="an_26:4">26:4</span> To whom hast thou uttered words? And
whose spirit came forth from thee?

<span id="an_26:5">26:5</span> They that are deceased tremble Beneath
the waters and the inhabitants thereof.

<span id="an_26:6">26:6</span> Sheol is naked before \[God\], And
Abaddon hath no covering.

<span id="an_26:7">26:7</span> He stretcheth out the north over empty
space, And hangeth the earth upon nothing.

<span id="an_26:8">26:8</span> He bindeth up the waters in his thick
clouds; And the cloud is not rent under them.

<span id="an_26:9">26:9</span> He incloseth the face of his throne, And
spreadeth his cloud upon it.

<span id="an_26:10">26:10</span> He hath described a boundary upon the
face of the waters, Unto the confines of light and darkness.

<span id="an_26:11">26:11</span> The pillars of heaven tremble And are
astonished at his rebuke.

<span id="an_26:12">26:12</span> He stirreth up the sea with his power,
And by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab.

<span id="an_26:13">26:13</span> By his Spirit the heavens are
garnished; His hand hath pierced the swift serpent.

<span id="an_26:14">26:14</span> Lo, these are but the outskirts of his
ways: And how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his
power who can understand?

<span id="an_27:1">27:1</span> And Job again took up his parable, and
said,

<span id="an_27:2">27:2</span> As God liveth, who hath taken away my
right, And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul:

<span id="an_27:3">27:3</span> (For my life is yet whole in me, And the
spirit of God is in my nostrils);

<span id="an_27:4">27:4</span> Surely my lips shall not speak
unrighteousness, Neither shall my tongue utter deceit.

<span id="an_27:5">27:5</span> Far be it from me that I should justify
you: Till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me.

<span id="an_27:6">27:6</span> My righteousness I hold fast, and will
not let it go: My heart shall not reproach \[me\] so long as I live.

<span id="an_27:7">27:7</span> Let mine enemy be as the wicked, And let
him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous.

<span id="an_27:8">27:8</span> For what is the hope of the godless,
though he get him gain, When God taketh away his soul?

<span id="an_27:9">27:9</span> Will God hear his cry, When trouble
cometh upon him?

<span id="an_27:10">27:10</span> Will he delight himself in the
Almighty, And call upon God at all times?

<span id="an_27:11">27:11</span> I will teach you concerning the hand of
God; That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.

<span id="an_27:12">27:12</span> Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it;
Why then are ye become altogether vain?

<span id="an_27:13">27:13</span> This is the portion of a wicked man
with God, And the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the
Almighty:

<span id="an_27:14">27:14</span> If his children be multiplied, it is
for the sword; And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.

<span id="an_27:15">27:15</span> Those that remain of him shall be
buried in death, And his widows shall make no lamentation.

<span id="an_27:16">27:16</span> Though he heap up silver as the dust,
And prepare raiment as the clay;

<span id="an_27:17">27:17</span> He may prepare it, but the just shall
put it on, And the innocent shall divide the silver.

<span id="an_27:18">27:18</span> He buildeth his house as the moth, And
as a booth which the keeper maketh.

<span id="an_27:19">27:19</span> He lieth down rich, but he shall not be
gathered \[to his fathers\]; He openeth his eyes, and he is not.

<span id="an_27:20">27:20</span> Terrors overtake him like waters; A
tempest stealeth him away in the night.

<span id="an_27:21">27:21</span> The east wind carrieth him away, and he
departeth; And it sweepeth him out of his place.

<span id="an_27:22">27:22</span> For \[God\] shall hurl at him, and not
spare: He would fain flee out of his hand.

<span id="an_27:23">27:23</span> Men shall clap their hands at him, And
shall hiss him out of his place.

<span id="an_28:1">28:1</span> Surely there is a mine for silver, And a
place for gold which they refine.

<span id="an_28:2">28:2</span> Iron is taken out of the earth, And
copper is molten out of the stone.

<span id="an_28:3">28:3</span> \[Man\] setteth an end to darkness, And
searcheth out, to the furthest bound, The stones of obscurity and of
thick darkness.

<span id="an_28:4">28:4</span> He breaketh open a shaft away from where
men sojourn; They are forgotten of the foot; They hang afar from men,
they swing to and fro.

<span id="an_28:5">28:5</span> As for the earth, out of it cometh bread;
And underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.

<span id="an_28:6">28:6</span> The stones thereof are the place of
sapphires, And it hath dust of gold.

<span id="an_28:7">28:7</span> That path no bird of prey knoweth,
Neither hath the falcon's eye seen it:

<span id="an_28:8">28:8</span> The proud beasts have not trodden it, Nor
hath the fierce lion passed thereby.

<span id="an_28:9">28:9</span> He putteth forth his hand upon the flinty
rock; He overturneth the mountains by the roots.

<span id="an_28:10">28:10</span> He cutteth out channels among the
rocks; And his eye seeth every precious thing.

<span id="an_28:11">28:11</span> He bindeth the streams that they
trickle not; And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.

<span id="an_28:12">28:12</span> But where shall wisdom be found? And
where is the place of understanding?

<span id="an_28:13">28:13</span> Man knoweth not the price thereof;
Neither is it found in the land of the living.

<span id="an_28:14">28:14</span> The deep saith, It is not in me; And
the sea saith, It is not with me.

<span id="an_28:15">28:15</span> It cannot be gotten for gold, Neither
shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.

<span id="an_28:16">28:16</span> It cannot be valued with the gold of
Ophir, With the precious onyx, or the sapphire.

<span id="an_28:17">28:17</span> Gold and glass cannot equal it, Neither
shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.

<span id="an_28:18">28:18</span> No mention shall be made of coral or of
crystal: Yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies.

<span id="an_28:19">28:19</span> The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal
it, Neither shall it be valued with pure gold.

<span id="an_28:20">28:20</span> Whence then cometh wisdom? And where is
the place of understanding?

<span id="an_28:21">28:21</span> Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all
living, And kept close from the birds of the heavens.

<span id="an_28:22">28:22</span> Destruction and Death say, We have
heard a rumor thereof with our ears.

<span id="an_28:23">28:23</span> God understandeth the way thereof, And
he knoweth the place thereof.

<span id="an_28:24">28:24</span> For he looketh to the ends of the
earth, And seeth under the whole heaven;

<span id="an_28:25">28:25</span> To make a weight for the wind: Yea, he
meteth out the waters by measure.

<span id="an_28:26">28:26</span> When he made a decree for the rain, And
a way for the lightning of the thunder;

<span id="an_28:27">28:27</span> Then did he see it, and declare it; He
established it, yea, and searched it out.

<span id="an_28:28">28:28</span> And unto man he said, Behold, the fear
of the Lord, that is wisdom; And to depart from evil is understanding.

<span id="an_29:1">29:1</span> And Job again took up his parable, and
said,

<span id="an_29:2">29:2</span> Oh that I were as in the months of old,
As in the days when God watched over me;

<span id="an_29:3">29:3</span> When his lamp shined upon my head, And by
his light I walked through darkness;

<span id="an_29:4">29:4</span> As I was in the ripeness of my days, When
the friendship of God was upon my tent;

<span id="an_29:5">29:5</span> When the Almighty was yet with me, And my
children were about me;

<span id="an_29:6">29:6</span> When my steps were washed with butter,
And the rock poured me out streams of oil!

<span id="an_29:7">29:7</span> When I went forth to the gate unto the
city, When I prepared my seat in the street,

<span id="an_29:8">29:8</span> The young men saw me and hid themselves,
And the aged rose up and stood;

<span id="an_29:9">29:9</span> The princes refrained from talking, And
laid their hand on their mouth;

<span id="an_29:10">29:10</span> The voice of the nobles was hushed, And
their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.

<span id="an_29:11">29:11</span> For when the ear heard \[me\], then it
blessed me; And when the eye saw \[me\], it gave witness unto me:

<span id="an_29:12">29:12</span> Because I delivered the poor that
cried, The fatherless also, that had none to help him.

<span id="an_29:13">29:13</span> The blessing of him that was ready to
perish came upon me; And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.

<span id="an_29:14">29:14</span> I put on righteousness, and it clothed
me: My justice was as a robe and a diadem.

<span id="an_29:15">29:15</span> I was eyes to the blind, And feet was I
to the lame.

<span id="an_29:16">29:16</span> I was a father to the needy: And the
cause of him that I knew not I searched out.

<span id="an_29:17">29:17</span> And I brake the jaws of the
unrighteous, And plucked the prey out of his teeth.

<span id="an_29:18">29:18</span> Then I said, I shall die in my nest,
And I shall multiply my days as the sand:

<span id="an_29:19">29:19</span> My root is spread out to the waters,
And the dew lieth all night upon my branch;

<span id="an_29:20">29:20</span> My glory is fresh in me, And my bow is
renewed in my hand.

<span id="an_29:21">29:21</span> Unto me men gave ear, and waited, And
kept silence for my counsel.

<span id="an_29:22">29:22</span> After my words they spake not again;
And my speech distilled upon them.

<span id="an_29:23">29:23</span> And they waited for me as for the rain;
And they opened their mouth wide \[as\] for the latter rain.

<span id="an_29:24">29:24</span> I smiled on them, when they had no
confidence; And the light of my countenance they cast not down.

<span id="an_29:25">29:25</span> I chose out their way, and sat \[as\]
chief, And dwelt as a king in the army, As one that comforteth the
mourners.

<span id="an_30:1">30:1</span> But now they that are younger than I have
me in derision, Whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my
flock.

<span id="an_30:2">30:2</span> Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto
should it profit me? Men in whom ripe age is perished.

<span id="an_30:3">30:3</span> They are gaunt with want and famine; They
gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of wasteness and desolation.

<span id="an_30:4">30:4</span> They pluck salt-wort by the bushes; And
the roots of the broom are their food.

<span id="an_30:5">30:5</span> They are driven forth from the midst \[of
men\]; They cry after them as after a thief;

<span id="an_30:6">30:6</span> So that they dwell in frightful valleys,
In holes of the earth and of the rocks.

<span id="an_30:7">30:7</span> Among the bushes they bray; Under the
nettles they are gathered together.

<span id="an_30:8">30:8</span> \[They are\] children of fools, yea,
children of base men; They were scourged out of the land.

<span id="an_30:9">30:9</span> And now I am become their song, Yea, I am
a byword unto them.

<span id="an_30:10">30:10</span> They abhor me, they stand aloof from
me, And spare not to spit in my face.

<span id="an_30:11">30:11</span> For he hath loosed his cord, and
afflicted me; And they have cast off the bridle before me.

<span id="an_30:12">30:12</span> Upon my right hand rise the rabble;
They thrust aside my feet, And they cast up against me their ways of
destruction.

<span id="an_30:13">30:13</span> They mar my path, They set forward my
calamity, \[Even\] men that have no helper.

<span id="an_30:14">30:14</span> As through a wide breach they come: In
the midst of the ruin they roll themselves \[upon me\].

<span id="an_30:15">30:15</span> Terrors are turned upon me; They chase
mine honor as the wind; And my welfare is passed away as a cloud.

<span id="an_30:16">30:16</span> And now my soul is poured out within
me; Days of affliction have taken hold upon me.

<span id="an_30:17">30:17</span> In the night season my bones are
pierced in me, And the \[pains\] that gnaw me take no rest.

<span id="an_30:18">30:18</span> By \[God's\] great force is my garment
disfigured; It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.

<span id="an_30:19">30:19</span> He hath cast me into the mire, And I am
become like dust and ashes.

<span id="an_30:20">30:20</span> I cry unto thee, and thou dost not
answer me: I stand up, and thou gazest at me.

<span id="an_30:21">30:21</span> Thou art turned to be cruel to me; With
the might of thy hand thou persecutest me.

<span id="an_30:22">30:22</span> Thou liftest me up to the wind, thou
causest me to ride \[upon it\]; And thou dissolvest me in the storm.

<span id="an_30:23">30:23</span> For I know that thou wilt bring me to
death, And to the house appointed for all living.

<span id="an_30:24">30:24</span> Howbeit doth not one stretch out the
hand in his fall? Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?

<span id="an_30:25">30:25</span> Did not I weep for him that was in
trouble? Was not my soul grieved for the needy?

<span id="an_30:26">30:26</span> When I looked for good, then evil came;
And when I waited for light, there came darkness.

<span id="an_30:27">30:27</span> My heart is troubled, and resteth not;
Days of affliction are come upon me.

<span id="an_30:28">30:28</span> I go mourning without the sun: I stand
up in the assembly, and cry for help.

<span id="an_30:29">30:29</span> I am a brother to jackals, And a
companion to ostriches.

<span id="an_30:30">30:30</span> My skin is black, \[and falleth\] from
me, And my bones are burned with heat.

<span id="an_30:31">30:31</span> Therefore is my harp \[turned\] to
mourning, And my pipe into the voice of them that weep.

<span id="an_31:1">31:1</span> I made a covenant with mine eyes; How
then should I look upon a virgin?

<span id="an_31:2">31:2</span> For what is the portion from God above,
And the heritage from the Almighty on high?

<span id="an_31:3">31:3</span> Is it not calamity to the unrighteous,
And disaster to the workers of iniquity?

<span id="an_31:4">31:4</span> Doth not he see my ways, And number all
my steps?

<span id="an_31:5">31:5</span> If I have walked with falsehood, And my
foot hath hasted to deceit

<span id="an_31:6">31:6</span> (Let me be weighed in an even balance,
That God may know mine integrity);

<span id="an_31:7">31:7</span> If my step hath turned out of the way,
And my heart walked after mine eyes, And if any spot hath cleaved to my
hands:

<span id="an_31:8">31:8</span> Then let me sow, and let another eat;
Yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out.

<span id="an_31:9">31:9</span> If my heart hath been enticed unto a
woman, And I have laid wait at my neighbor's door;

<span id="an_31:10">31:10</span> Then let my wife grind unto another,
And let others bow down upon her.

<span id="an_31:11">31:11</span> For that were a heinous crime; Yea, it
were an iniquity to be punished by the judges:

<span id="an_31:12">31:12</span> For it is a fire that consumeth unto
Destruction, And would root out all mine increase.

<span id="an_31:13">31:13</span> If I have despised the cause of my
man-servant or of my maid-servant, When they contended with me;

<span id="an_31:14">31:14</span> What then shall I do when God riseth
up? And when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?

<span id="an_31:15">31:15</span> Did not he that made me in the womb
make him? And did not one fashion us in the womb?

<span id="an_31:16">31:16</span> If I have withheld the poor from
\[their\] desire, Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,

<span id="an_31:17">31:17</span> Or have eaten my morsel alone, And the
fatherless hath not eaten thereof

<span id="an_31:18">31:18</span> (Nay, from my youth he grew up with me
as with a father, And her have I guided from my mother's womb);

<span id="an_31:19">31:19</span> If I have seen any perish for want of
clothing, Or that the needy had no covering;

<span id="an_31:20">31:20</span> If his loins have not blessed me, And
if he hath not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep;

<span id="an_31:21">31:21</span> If I have lifted up my hand against the
fatherless, Because I saw my help in the gate:

<span id="an_31:22">31:22</span> Then let my shoulder fall from the
shoulder-blade, And mine arm be broken from the bone.

<span id="an_31:23">31:23</span> For calamity from God is a terror to
me, And by reason of his majesty I can do nothing.

<span id="an_31:24">31:24</span> If I have made gold my hope, And have
said to the fine gold, \[Thou art\] my confidence;

<span id="an_31:25">31:25</span> If I have rejoiced because my wealth
was great, And because my hand had gotten much;

<span id="an_31:26">31:26</span> If I have beheld the sun when it
shined, Or the moon walking in brightness,

<span id="an_31:27">31:27</span> And my heart hath been secretly
enticed, And my mouth hath kissed my hand:

<span id="an_31:28">31:28</span> This also were an iniquity to be
punished by the judges; For I should have denied the God that is above.

<span id="an_31:29">31:29</span> If I have rejoiced at the destruction
of him that hated me, Or lifted up myself when evil found him;

<span id="an_31:30">31:30</span> (Yea, I have not suffered by mouth to
sin By asking his life with a curse);

<span id="an_31:31">31:31</span> If the men of my tent have not said,
Who can find one that hath not been filled with his meat?

<span id="an_31:32">31:32</span> (The sojourner hath not lodged in the
street; But I have opened my doors to the traveller);

<span id="an_31:33">31:33</span> If like Adam I have covered my
transgressions, By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom,

<span id="an_31:34">31:34</span> Because I feared the great multitude,
And the contempt of families terrified me, So that I kept silence, and
went not out of the door-

<span id="an_31:35">31:35</span> Oh that I had one to hear me! (Lo, here
is my signature, let the Almighty answer me); And \[that I had\] the
indictment which mine adversary hath written!

<span id="an_31:36">31:36</span> Surely I would carry it upon my
shoulder; I would bind it unto me as a crown:

<span id="an_31:37">31:37</span> I would declare unto him the number of
my steps; As a prince would I go near unto him.

<span id="an_31:38">31:38</span> If my land crieth out against me, And
the furrows thereof weep together;

<span id="an_31:39">31:39</span> If I have eaten the fruits thereof
without money, Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:

<span id="an_31:40">31:40</span> Let thistles grow instead of wheat, And
cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.

<span id="an_32:1">32:1</span> So these three men ceased to answer Job,
because he was righteous in his own eyes.

<span id="an_32:2">32:2</span> Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the
son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his
wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.

<span id="an_32:3">32:3</span> Also against his three friends was his
wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned
Job.

<span id="an_32:4">32:4</span> Now Elihu had waited to speak unto Job,
because they were elder than he.

<span id="an_32:5">32:5</span> And when Elihu saw that there was no
answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.

<span id="an_32:6">32:6</span> And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite
answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; Wherefore I held
back, and durst not show you mine opinion.

<span id="an_32:7">32:7</span> I said, Days should speak, And multitude
of years should teach wisdom.

<span id="an_32:8">32:8</span> But there is a spirit in man, And the
breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding.

<span id="an_32:9">32:9</span> It is not the great that are wise, Nor
the aged that understand justice.

<span id="an_32:10">32:10</span> Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also
will show mine opinion.

<span id="an_32:11">32:11</span> Behold, I waited for your words, I
listened for your reasonings, Whilst ye searched out what to say.

<span id="an_32:12">32:12</span> Yea, I attended unto you, And, behold,
there was none that convinced Job, Or that answered his words, among
you.

<span id="an_32:13">32:13</span> Beware lest ye say, We have found
wisdom; God may vanquish him, not man:

<span id="an_32:14">32:14</span> For he hath not directed his words
against me; Neither will I answer him with your speeches.

<span id="an_32:15">32:15</span> They are amazed, they answer no more:
They have not a word to say.

<span id="an_32:16">32:16</span> And shall I wait, because they speak
not, Because they stand still, and answer no more?

<span id="an_32:17">32:17</span> I also will answer my part, I also will
show mine opinion.

<span id="an_32:18">32:18</span> For I am full of words; The spirit
within me constraineth me.

<span id="an_32:19">32:19</span> Behold, my breast is as wine which hath
no vent; Like new wine-skins it is ready to burst.

<span id="an_32:20">32:20</span> I will speak, that I may be refreshed;
I will open my lips and answer.

<span id="an_32:21">32:21</span> Let me not, I pray you, respect any
man's person; Neither will I give flattering titles unto any man.

<span id="an_32:22">32:22</span> For I know not to give flattering
titles; \[Else\] would my Maker soon take me away.

<span id="an_33:1">33:1</span> Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my
speech, And hearken to all my words.

<span id="an_33:2">33:2</span> Behold now, I have opened my mouth; My
tongue hath spoken in my mouth.

<span id="an_33:3">33:3</span> My words \[shall utter\] the uprightness
of my heart; And that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.

<span id="an_33:4">33:4</span> The Spirit of God hath made me, And the
breath of the Almighty giveth me life.

<span id="an_33:5">33:5</span> If thou canst, answer thou me; Set \[thy
words\] in order before me, stand forth.

<span id="an_33:6">33:6</span> Behold, I am toward God even as thou art:
I also am formed out of the clay.

<span id="an_33:7">33:7</span> Behold, my terror shall not make thee
afraid, Neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee.

<span id="an_33:8">33:8</span> Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing,
And I have heard the voice of \[thy\] words, \[saying\],

<span id="an_33:9">33:9</span> I am clean, without transgression; I am
innocent, neither is there iniquity in me:

<span id="an_33:10">33:10</span> Behold, he findeth occasions against
me, He counteth me for his enemy:

<span id="an_33:11">33:11</span> He putteth my feet in the stocks, He
marketh all my paths.

<span id="an_33:12">33:12</span> Behold, I will answer thee, in this
thou art not just; For God is greater than man.

<span id="an_33:13">33:13</span> Why dost thou strive against him, For
that he giveth not account of any of his matters?

<span id="an_33:14">33:14</span> For God speaketh once, Yea twice,
\[though man\] regardeth it not.

<span id="an_33:15">33:15</span> In a dream, in a vision of the night,
When deep sleep falleth upon men, In slumberings upon the bed;

<span id="an_33:16">33:16</span> Then he openeth the ears of men, And
sealeth their instruction,

<span id="an_33:17">33:17</span> That he may withdraw man \[from his\]
purpose, And hide pride from man;

<span id="an_33:18">33:18</span> He keepeth back his soul from the pit,
And his life from perishing by the sword.

<span id="an_33:19">33:19</span> He is chastened also with pain upon his
bed, And with continual strife in his bones;

<span id="an_33:20">33:20</span> So that his life abhorreth bread, And
his soul dainty food.

<span id="an_33:21">33:21</span> His flesh is consumed away, that it
cannot be seen; And his bones that were not seen stick out.

<span id="an_33:22">33:22</span> Yea, his soul draweth near unto the
pit, And his life to the destroyers.

<span id="an_33:23">33:23</span> If there be with him an angel, An
interpreter, one among a thousand, To show unto man what is right for
him;

<span id="an_33:24">33:24</span> Then \[God\] is gracious unto him, and
saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.

<span id="an_33:25">33:25</span> His flesh shall be fresher than a
child's; He returneth to the days of his youth.

<span id="an_33:26">33:26</span> He prayeth unto God, and he is
favorable unto him, So that he seeth his face with joy: And he restoreth
unto man his righteousness.

<span id="an_33:27">33:27</span> He singeth before men, and saith, I
have sinned, and perverted that which was right, And it profited me not:

<span id="an_33:28">33:28</span> He hath redeemed my soul from going
into the pit, And my life shall behold the light.

<span id="an_33:29">33:29</span> Lo, all these things doth God work,
Twice, \[yea\] thrice, with a man,

<span id="an_33:30">33:30</span> To bring back his soul from the pit,
That he may be enlightened with the light of the living.

<span id="an_33:31">33:31</span> Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: Hold
thy peace, and I will speak.

<span id="an_33:32">33:32</span> If thou hast anything to say, answer
me: Speak, for I desire to justify thee.

<span id="an_33:33">33:33</span> If not, hearken thou unto me: Hold thy
peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.

<span id="an_34:1">34:1</span> Moreover Elihu answered and said,

<span id="an_34:2">34:2</span> Hear my words, ye wise men; And give ear
unto me, ye that have knowledge.

<span id="an_34:3">34:3</span> For the ear trieth words, As the palate
tasteth food.

<span id="an_34:4">34:4</span> Let us choose for us that which is right:
Let us know among ourselves what is good.

<span id="an_34:5">34:5</span> For Job hath said, I am righteous, And
God hath taken away my right:

<span id="an_34:6">34:6</span> Notwithstanding my right I am
\[accounted\] a liar; My wound is incurable, \[though I am\] without
transgression.

<span id="an_34:7">34:7</span> What man is like Job, Who drinketh up
scoffing like water,

<span id="an_34:8">34:8</span> Who goeth in company with the workers of
iniquity, And walketh with wicked men?

<span id="an_34:9">34:9</span> For he hath said, It profiteth a man
nothing That he should delight himself with God.

<span id="an_34:10">34:10</span> Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of
understanding: Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, And
from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.

<span id="an_34:11">34:11</span> For the work of a man will he render
unto him, And cause every man to find according to his ways.

<span id="an_34:12">34:12</span> Yea, of a surety, God will not do
wickedly, Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.

<span id="an_34:13">34:13</span> Who gave him a charge over the earth?
Or who hath disposed the whole world?

<span id="an_34:14">34:14</span> If he set his heart upon himself,
\[If\] he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;

<span id="an_34:15">34:15</span> All flesh shall perish together, And
man shall turn again unto dust.

<span id="an_34:16">34:16</span> If now \[thou hast\] understanding,
hear this: Hearken to the voice of my words.

<span id="an_34:17">34:17</span> Shall even one that hateth justice
govern? And wilt thou condemn him that is righteous \[and\] mighty?-

<span id="an_34:18">34:18</span> \[Him\] that saith to a king, \[Thou
art\] vile, \[Or\] to nobles, \[Ye are\] wicked;

<span id="an_34:19">34:19</span> That respecteth not the persons of
princes, Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor; For they all are the
work of his hands.

<span id="an_34:20">34:20</span> In a moment they die, even at midnight;
The people are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away
without hand.

<span id="an_34:21">34:21</span> For his eyes are upon the ways of a
man, And he seeth all his goings.

<span id="an_34:22">34:22</span> There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,
Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.

<span id="an_34:23">34:23</span> For he needeth not further to consider
a man, That he should go before God in judgment.

<span id="an_34:24">34:24</span> He breaketh in pieces mighty men \[in
ways\] past finding out, And setteth others in their stead.

<span id="an_34:25">34:25</span> Therefore he taketh knowledge of their
works; And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.

<span id="an_34:26">34:26</span> He striketh them as wicked men In the
open sight of others;

<span id="an_34:27">34:27</span> Because they turned aside from
following him, And would not have regard in any of his ways:

<span id="an_34:28">34:28</span> So that they caused the cry of the poor
to come unto him, And he heard the cry of the afflicted.

<span id="an_34:29">34:29</span> When he giveth quietness, who then can
condemn? And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? Alike
whether \[it be done\] unto a nation, or unto a man:

<span id="an_34:30">34:30</span> That the godless man reign not, That
there be none to ensnare the people.

<span id="an_34:31">34:31</span> For hath any said unto God, I have
borne \[chastisement\], I will not offend \[any more\]:

<span id="an_34:32">34:32</span> That which I see not teach thou me: If
I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?

<span id="an_34:33">34:33</span> Shall his recompense be as thou wilt,
that thou refusest it? For thou must choose, and not I: Therefore speak
what thou knowest.

<span id="an_34:34">34:34</span> Men of understanding will say unto me,
Yea, every wise man that heareth me:

<span id="an_34:35">34:35</span> Job speaketh without knowledge, And his
words are without wisdom.

<span id="an_34:36">34:36</span> Would that Job were tried unto the end,
Because of his answering like wicked men.

<span id="an_34:37">34:37</span> For he addeth rebellion unto his sin;
He clappeth his hands among us, And multiplieth his words against God.

<span id="an_35:1">35:1</span> Moreover Elihu answered and said,

<span id="an_35:2">35:2</span> Thinkest thou this to be \[thy\] right,
\[Or\] sayest thou, My righteousness is more than God's,

<span id="an_35:3">35:3</span> That thou sayest, What advantage will it
be unto thee? \[And\], What profit shall I have, more than if I had
sinned?

<span id="an_35:4">35:4</span> I will answer thee, And thy companions
with thee.

<span id="an_35:5">35:5</span> Look unto the heavens, and see; And
behold the skies, which are higher than thou.

<span id="an_35:6">35:6</span> If thou hast sinned, what effectest thou
against him? And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou
unto him?

<span id="an_35:7">35:7</span> If thou be righteous, what givest thou
him? Or what receiveth he of thy hand?

<span id="an_35:8">35:8</span> Thy wickedness \[may hurt\] a man as thou
art; And thy righteousness \[may profit\] a son of man.

<span id="an_35:9">35:9</span> By reason of the multitude of oppressions
they cry out; They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.

<span id="an_35:10">35:10</span> But none saith, Where is God my Maker,
Who giveth songs in the night,

<span id="an_35:11">35:11</span> Who teacheth us more than the beasts of
the earth, And maketh us wiser than the birds of the heavens?

<span id="an_35:12">35:12</span> There they cry, but none giveth answer,
Because of the pride of evil men.

<span id="an_35:13">35:13</span> Surely God will not hear an empty
\[cry\], Neither will the Almighty regard it.

<span id="an_35:14">35:14</span> How much less when thou sayest thou
beholdest him not, The cause is before him, and thou waitest for him!

<span id="an_35:15">35:15</span> But now, because he hath not visited in
his anger, Neither doth he greatly regard arrogance;

<span id="an_35:16">35:16</span> Therefore doth Job open his mouth in
vanity; He multiplieth words without knowledge.

<span id="an_36:1">36:1</span> Elihu also proceeded, and said,

<span id="an_36:2">36:2</span> Suffer me a little, and I will show thee;
For I have yet somewhat to say on God's behalf.

<span id="an_36:3">36:3</span> I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And
will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.

<span id="an_36:4">36:4</span> For truly my words are not false: One
that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.

<span id="an_36:5">36:5</span> Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not
any: He is mighty in strength of understanding.

<span id="an_36:6">36:6</span> He preserveth not the life of the wicked,
But giveth to the afflicted \[their\] right.

<span id="an_36:7">36:7</span> He withdraweth not his eyes from the
righteous: But with kings upon the throne He setteth them for ever, and
they are exalted.

<span id="an_36:8">36:8</span> And if they be bound in fetters, And be
taken in the cords of afflictions;

<span id="an_36:9">36:9</span> Then he showeth them their work, And
their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.

<span id="an_36:10">36:10</span> He openeth also their ear to
instruction, And commandeth that they return from iniquity.

<span id="an_36:11">36:11</span> If they hearken and serve \[him\], They
shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures.

<span id="an_36:12">36:12</span> But if they hearken not, they shall
perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge.

<span id="an_36:13">36:13</span> But they that are godless in heart lay
up anger: They cry not for help when he bindeth them.

<span id="an_36:14">36:14</span> They die in youth, And their life
\[perisheth\] among the unclean.

<span id="an_36:15">36:15</span> He delivereth the afflicted by their
affliction, And openeth their ear in oppression.

<span id="an_36:16">36:16</span> Yea, he would have allured thee out of
distress Into a broad place, where there is no straitness; And that
which is set on thy table would be full of fatness.

<span id="an_36:17">36:17</span> But thou art full of the judgment of
the wicked: Judgment and justice take hold \[on thee\].

<span id="an_36:18">36:18</span> For let not wrath stir thee up against
chastisements; Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside.

<span id="an_36:19">36:19</span> Will thy cry avail, \[that thou be\]
not in distress, Or all the forces of \[thy\] strength?

<span id="an_36:20">36:20</span> Desire not the night, When peoples are
cut off in their place.

<span id="an_36:21">36:21</span> Take heed, regard not iniquity: For
this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.

<span id="an_36:22">36:22</span> Behold, God doeth loftily in his power:
Who is a teacher like unto him?

<span id="an_36:23">36:23</span> Who hath enjoined him his way? Or who
can say, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness?

<span id="an_36:24">36:24</span> Remember that thou magnify his work,
Whereof men have sung.

<span id="an_36:25">36:25</span> All men have looked thereon; Man
beholdeth it afar off.

<span id="an_36:26">36:26</span> Behold, God is great, and we know him
not; The number of his years is unsearchable.

<span id="an_36:27">36:27</span> For he draweth up the drops of water,
Which distil in rain from his vapor,

<span id="an_36:28">36:28</span> Which the skies pour down And drop upon
man abundantly.

<span id="an_36:29">36:29</span> Yea, can any understand the spreadings
of the clouds, The thunderings of his pavilion?

<span id="an_36:30">36:30</span> Behold, he spreadeth his light around
him; And he covereth the bottom of the sea.

<span id="an_36:31">36:31</span> For by these he judgeth the peoples; He
giveth food in abundance.

<span id="an_36:32">36:32</span> He covereth his hands with the
lightning, And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark.

<span id="an_36:33">36:33</span> The noise thereof telleth concerning
him, The cattle also concerning \[the storm\] that cometh up.

<span id="an_37:1">37:1</span> Yea, at this my heart trembleth, And is
moved out of its place.

<span id="an_37:2">37:2</span> Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice,
And the sound that goeth out of his mouth.

<span id="an_37:3">37:3</span> He sendeth it forth under the whole
heaven, And his lightening unto the ends of the earth.

<span id="an_37:4">37:4</span> After it a voice roareth; He thundereth
with the voice of his majesty; And he restraineth not \[the lightnings\]
when his voice is heard.

<span id="an_37:5">37:5</span> God thundereth marvellously with his
voice; Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.

<span id="an_37:6">37:6</span> For he saith to the snow, Fall thou on
the earth; Likewise to the shower of rain, And to the showers of his
mighty rain.

<span id="an_37:7">37:7</span> He sealeth up the hand of every man, That
all men whom he hath made may know \[it\].

<span id="an_37:8">37:8</span> Then the beasts go into coverts, And
remain in their dens.

<span id="an_37:9">37:9</span> Out of the chamber \[of the south\]
cometh the storm, And cold out of the north.

<span id="an_37:10">37:10</span> By the breath of God ice is given; And
the breadth of the waters is straitened.

<span id="an_37:11">37:11</span> Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with
moisture; He spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning:

<span id="an_37:12">37:12</span> And it is turned round about by his
guidance, That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them Upon the face
of the habitable world,

<span id="an_37:13">37:13</span> Whether it be for correction, or for
his land, Or for lovingkindness, that he cause it to come.

<span id="an_37:14">37:14</span> Hearken unto this, O Job: Stand still,
and consider the wondrous works of God.

<span id="an_37:15">37:15</span> Dost thou know how God layeth \[his
charge\] upon them, And causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine?

<span id="an_37:16">37:16</span> Dost thou know the balancings of the
clouds, The wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?

<span id="an_37:17">37:17</span> How thy garments are warm, When the
earth is still by reason of the south \[wind\]?

<span id="an_37:18">37:18</span> Canst thou with him spread out the sky,
Which is strong as a molten mirror?

<span id="an_37:19">37:19</span> Teach us what we shall say unto him;
\[For\] we cannot set \[our speech\] in order by reason of darkness.

<span id="an_37:20">37:20</span> Shall it be told him that I would
speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?

<span id="an_37:21">37:21</span> And now men see not the light which is
bright in the skies; But the wind passeth, and cleareth them.

<span id="an_37:22">37:22</span> Out of the north cometh golden
splendor: God hath upon him terrible majesty.

<span id="an_37:23">37:23</span> \[Touching\] the Almighty, we cannot
find him out He is excellent in power; And in justice and plenteous
righteousness he will not afflict.

<span id="an_37:24">37:24</span> Men do therefore fear him: He regardeth
not any that are wise of heart.

<span id="an_38:1">38:1</span> Then Jehovah answered Job out of the
whirlwind, and said,

<span id="an_38:2">38:2</span> Who is this that darkeneth counsel By
words without knowledge?

<span id="an_38:3">38:3</span> Gird up now thy loins like a man; For I
will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.

<span id="an_38:4">38:4</span> Where wast thou when I laid the
foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding.

<span id="an_38:5">38:5</span> Who determined the measures thereof, if
thou knowest? Or who stretched the line upon it?

<span id="an_38:6">38:6</span> Whereupon were the foundations thereof
fastened? Or who laid the corner-stone thereof,

<span id="an_38:7">38:7</span> When the morning stars sang together, And
all the sons of God shouted for joy?

<span id="an_38:8">38:8</span> Or \[who\] shut up the sea with doors,
When it brake forth, \[as if\] it had issued out of the womb;

<span id="an_38:9">38:9</span> When I made clouds the garment thereof,
And thick darkness a swaddling-band for it,

<span id="an_38:10">38:10</span> And marked out for it my bound, And set
bars and doors,

<span id="an_38:11">38:11</span> And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but
no further; And here shall thy proud waves be stayed?

<span id="an_38:12">38:12</span> Hast thou commanded the morning since
thy days \[began\], \[And\] caused the dayspring to know its place;

<span id="an_38:13">38:13</span> That it might take hold of the ends of
the earth, And the wicked be shaken out of it?

<span id="an_38:14">38:14</span> It is changed as clay under the seal;
And \[all things\] stand forth as a garment:

<span id="an_38:15">38:15</span> And from the wicked their light is
withholden, And the high arm is broken.

<span id="an_38:16">38:16</span> Hast thou entered into the springs of
the sea? Or hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep?

<span id="an_38:17">38:17</span> Have the gates of death been revealed
unto thee? Or hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death?

<span id="an_38:18">38:18</span> Hast thou comprehended the earth in its
breadth? Declare, if thou knowest it all.

<span id="an_38:19">38:19</span> Where is the way to the dwelling of
light? And as for darkness, where is the place thereof,

<span id="an_38:20">38:20</span> That thou shouldest take it to the
bound thereof, And that thou shouldest discern the paths to the house
thereof?

<span id="an_38:21">38:21</span> \[Doubtless\], thou knowest, for thou
wast then born, And the number of thy days is great!

<span id="an_38:22">38:22</span> Hast thou entered the treasuries of the
snow, Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,

<span id="an_38:23">38:23</span> Which I have reserved against the time
of trouble, Against the day of battle and war?

<span id="an_38:24">38:24</span> By what way is the light parted, Or the
east wind scattered upon the earth?

<span id="an_38:25">38:25</span> Who hath cleft a channel for the
waterflood, Or the way for the lightning of the thunder;

<span id="an_38:26">38:26</span> To cause it to rain on a land where no
man is; On the wilderness, wherein there is no man;

<span id="an_38:27">38:27</span> To satisfy the waste and desolate
\[ground\], And to cause the tender grass to spring forth?

<span id="an_38:28">38:28</span> Hath the rain a father? Or who hath
begotten the drops of dew?

<span id="an_38:29">38:29</span> Out of whose womb came the ice? And the
hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?

<span id="an_38:30">38:30</span> The waters hide themselves \[and
become\] like stone, And the face of the deep is frozen.

<span id="an_38:31">38:31</span> Canst thou bind the cluster of the
Pleiades, Or loose the bands of Orion?

<span id="an_38:32">38:32</span> Canst thou lead forth the Mazzaroth in
their season? Or canst thou guide the Bear with her train?

<span id="an_38:33">38:33</span> Knowest thou the ordinances of the
heavens? Canst thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth?

<span id="an_38:34">38:34</span> Canst thou lift up thy voice to the
clouds, That abundance of waters may cover thee?

<span id="an_38:35">38:35</span> Canst thou send forth lightnings, that
they may go, And say unto thee, Here we are?

<span id="an_38:36">38:36</span> Who hath put wisdom in the inward
parts? Or who hath given understanding to the mind?

<span id="an_38:37">38:37</span> Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or
who can pour out the bottles of heaven,

<span id="an_38:38">38:38</span> When the dust runneth into a mass, And
the clods cleave fast together?

<span id="an_38:39">38:39</span> Canst thou hunt the prey for the
lioness, Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,

<span id="an_38:40">38:40</span> When they couch in their dens, \[And\]
abide in the covert to lie in wait?

<span id="an_38:41">38:41</span> Who provideth for the raven his prey,
When his young ones cry unto God, \[And\] wander for lack of food?

<span id="an_39:1">39:1</span> Knowest thou the time when the wild goats
of the rock bring forth? \[Or\] canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?

<span id="an_39:2">39:2</span> Canst thou number the months that they
fulfil? Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?

<span id="an_39:3">39:3</span> They bow themselves, they bring forth
their young, They cast out their pains.

<span id="an_39:4">39:4</span> Their young ones become strong, they grow
up in the open field; They go forth, and return not again.

<span id="an_39:5">39:5</span> Who hath sent out the wild ass free? Or
who hath loosed the bonds of the swift ass,

<span id="an_39:6">39:6</span> Whose home I have made the wilderness,
And the salt land his dwelling-place?

<span id="an_39:7">39:7</span> He scorneth the tumult of the city,
Neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver.

<span id="an_39:8">39:8</span> The range of the mountains is his
pasture, And he searcheth after every green thing.

<span id="an_39:9">39:9</span> Will the wild-ox be content to serve
thee? Or will he abide by thy crib?

<span id="an_39:10">39:10</span> Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his
band in the furrow? Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?

<span id="an_39:11">39:11</span> Wilt thou trust him, because his
strength is great? Or wilt thou leave to him thy labor?

<span id="an_39:12">39:12</span> Wilt thou confide in him, that he will
bring home thy seed, And gather \[the grain\] of thy threshing-floor?

<span id="an_39:13">39:13</span> The wings of the ostrich wave proudly;
\[But\] are they the pinions and plumage of love?

<span id="an_39:14">39:14</span> For she leaveth her eggs on the earth,
And warmeth them in the dust,

<span id="an_39:15">39:15</span> And forgetteth that the foot may crush
them, Or that the wild beast may trample them.

<span id="an_39:16">39:16</span> She dealeth hardly with her young ones,
as if they were not hers: Though her labor be in vain, \[she is\]
without fear;

<span id="an_39:17">39:17</span> Because God hath deprived her of
wisdom, Neither hath he imparted to her understanding.

<span id="an_39:18">39:18</span> What time she lifteth up herself on
high, She scorneth the horse and his rider.

<span id="an_39:19">39:19</span> Hast thou given the horse \[his\]
might? Hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane?

<span id="an_39:20">39:20</span> Hast thou made him to leap as a locust?
The glory of his snorting is terrible.

<span id="an_39:21">39:21</span> He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth
in his strength: He goeth out to meet the armed men.

<span id="an_39:22">39:22</span> He mocketh at fear, and is not
dismayed; Neither turneth he back from the sword.

<span id="an_39:23">39:23</span> The quiver rattleth against him, The
flashing spear and the javelin.

<span id="an_39:24">39:24</span> He swalloweth the ground with
fierceness and rage; Neither believeth he that it is the voice of the
trumpet.

<span id="an_39:25">39:25</span> As oft as the trumpet \[soundeth\] he
saith, Aha! And he smelleth the battle afar off, The thunder of the
captains, and the shouting.

<span id="an_39:26">39:26</span> Is it by thy wisdom that the hawk
soareth, (And) stretcheth her wings toward the south?

<span id="an_39:27">39:27</span> Is it at thy command that the eagle
mounteth up, And maketh her nest on high?

<span id="an_39:28">39:28</span> On the cliff she dwelleth, and maketh
her home, Upon the point of the cliff, and the stronghold.

<span id="an_39:29">39:29</span> From thence she spieth out the prey;
Her eyes behold it afar off.

<span id="an_39:30">39:30</span> Her young ones also suck up blood: And
where the slain are, there is she.

<span id="an_40:1">40:1</span> Moreover Jehovah answered Job, and said,

<span id="an_40:2">40:2</span> Shall he that cavilleth contend with the
Almighty? He that argueth with God, let him answer it.

<span id="an_40:3">40:3</span> Then Job answered Jehovah, and said,

<span id="an_40:4">40:4</span> Behold, I am of small account; What shall
I answer thee? I lay my hand upon my mouth.

<span id="an_40:5">40:5</span> Once have I spoken, and I will not
answer; Yea, twice, but I will proceed no further.

<span id="an_40:6">40:6</span> Then Jehovah answered Job out of the
whirlwind, and said,

<span id="an_40:7">40:7</span> Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will
demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.

<span id="an_40:8">40:8</span> Wilt thou even annul my judgment? Wilt
thou condemn me, that thou mayest be justified?

<span id="an_40:9">40:9</span> Or hast thou an arm like God? And canst
thou thunder with a voice like him?

<span id="an_40:10">40:10</span> Deck thyself now with excellency and
dignity; And array thyself with honor and majesty.

<span id="an_40:11">40:11</span> Pour forth the overflowings of thine
anger; And look upon every one that is proud, and abase him.

<span id="an_40:12">40:12</span> Look on every one that is proud,
\[and\] bring him low; And tread down the wicked where they stand.

<span id="an_40:13">40:13</span> Hide them in the dust together; Bind
their faces in the hidden \[place\].

<span id="an_40:14">40:14</span> Then will I also confess of thee That
thine own right hand can save thee.

<span id="an_40:15">40:15</span> Behold now, behemoth, which I made as
well as thee; He eateth grass as an ox.

<span id="an_40:16">40:16</span> Lo now, his strength is in his loins,
And his force is in the muscles of his belly.

<span id="an_40:17">40:17</span> He moveth his tail like a cedar: The
sinews of his thighs are knit together.

<span id="an_40:18">40:18</span> His bones are \[as\] tubes of brass;
His limbs are like bars of iron.

<span id="an_40:19">40:19</span> He is the chief of the ways of God: He
\[only\] that made him giveth him his sword.

<span id="an_40:20">40:20</span> Surely the mountains bring him forth
food, Where all the beasts of the field do play.

<span id="an_40:21">40:21</span> He lieth under the lotus-trees, In the
covert of the reed, and the fen.

<span id="an_40:22">40:22</span> The lotus-trees cover him with their
shade; The willows of the brook compass him about.

<span id="an_40:23">40:23</span> Behold, if a river overflow, he
trembleth not; He is confident, though a Jordan swell even to his mouth.

<span id="an_40:24">40:24</span> Shall any take him when he is on the
watch, Or pierce through his nose with a snare?

<span id="an_41:1">41:1</span> Canst thou draw out leviathan with a
fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord?

<span id="an_41:2">41:2</span> Canst thou put a rope into his nose? Or
pierce his jaw through with a hook?

<span id="an_41:3">41:3</span> Will he make many supplications unto
thee? Or will he speak soft words unto thee?

<span id="an_41:4">41:4</span> Will he make a covenant with thee, That
thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever?

<span id="an_41:5">41:5</span> Wilt thou play with him as with a bird?
Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?

<span id="an_41:6">41:6</span> Will the bands \[of fishermen\] make
traffic of him? Will they part him among the merchants?

<span id="an_41:7">41:7</span> Canst thou fill his skin with barbed
irons, Or his head with fish-spears?

<span id="an_41:8">41:8</span> Lay thy hand upon him; Remember the
battle, and do so no more.

<span id="an_41:9">41:9</span> Behold, the hope of him is in vain: Will
not one be cast down even at the sight of him?

<span id="an_41:10">41:10</span> None is so fierce that he dare stir him
up; Who then is he that can stand before me?

<span id="an_41:11">41:11</span> Who hath first given unto me, that I
should repay him? \[Whatsoever is\] under the whole heaven is mine.

<span id="an_41:12">41:12</span> I will not keep silence concerning his
limbs, Nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.

<span id="an_41:13">41:13</span> Who can strip off his outer garment?
Who shall come within his jaws?

<span id="an_41:14">41:14</span> Who can open the doors of his face?
Round about his teeth is terror.

<span id="an_41:15">41:15</span> \[His\] strong scales are \[his\]
pride, Shut up together \[as with\] a close seal.

<span id="an_41:16">41:16</span> One is so near to another, That no air
can come between them.

<span id="an_41:17">41:17</span> They are joined one to another; They
stick together, so that they cannot be sundered.

<span id="an_41:18">41:18</span> His sneezings flash forth light, And
his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.

<span id="an_41:19">41:19</span> Out of his mouth go burning torches,
And sparks of fire leap forth.

<span id="an_41:20">41:20</span> Out of his nostrils a smoke goeth, As
of a boiling pot and \[burning\] rushes.

<span id="an_41:21">41:21</span> His breath kindleth coals, And a flame
goeth forth from his mouth.

<span id="an_41:22">41:22</span> In his neck abideth strength, And
terror danceth before him.

<span id="an_41:23">41:23</span> The flakes of his flesh are joined
together: They are firm upon him; they cannot be moved.

<span id="an_41:24">41:24</span> His heart is as firm as a stone; Yea,
firm as the nether millstone.

<span id="an_41:25">41:25</span> When he raiseth himself up, the mighty
are afraid: By reason of consternation they are beside themselves.

<span id="an_41:26">41:26</span> If one lay at him with the sword, it
cannot avail; Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.

<span id="an_41:27">41:27</span> He counteth iron as straw, \[And\]
brass as rotten wood.

<span id="an_41:28">41:28</span> The arrow cannot make him flee:
Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble.

<span id="an_41:29">41:29</span> Clubs are counted as stubble: He
laugheth at the rushing of the javelin.

<span id="an_41:30">41:30</span> His underparts are \[like\] sharp
potsherds: He spreadeth \[as it were\] a threshing-wain upon the mire.

<span id="an_41:31">41:31</span> He maketh the deep to boil like a pot:
He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.

<span id="an_41:32">41:32</span> He maketh a path to shine after him;
One would think the deep to be hoary.

<span id="an_41:33">41:33</span> Upon earth there is not his like, That
is made without fear.

<span id="an_41:34">41:34</span> He beholdeth everything that is high:
He is king over all the sons of pride.

<span id="an_42:1">42:1</span> Then Job answered Jehovah, and said,

<span id="an_42:2">42:2</span> I know that thou canst do all things, And
that no purpose of thine can be restrained.

<span id="an_42:3">42:3</span> Who is this that hideth counsel without
knowledge? Therefore have I uttered that which I understood not, Things
too wonderful for me, which I knew not.

<span id="an_42:4">42:4</span> Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak; I
will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.

<span id="an_42:5">42:5</span> I had heard of thee by the hearing of the
ear; But now mine eye seeth thee:

<span id="an_42:6">42:6</span> Wherefore I abhor \[myself\], And repent
in dust and ashes.

<span id="an_42:7">42:7</span> And it was so, that, after Jehovah had
spoken these words unto Job, Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My
wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have
not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.

<span id="an_42:8">42:8</span> Now therefore, take unto you seven
bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for
yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you; for
him will I accept, that I deal not with you after your folly; for ye
have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.

<span id="an_42:9">42:9</span> So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the
Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as Jehovah
commanded them: and Jehovah accepted Job.

<span id="an_42:10">42:10</span> And Jehovah turned the captivity of
Job, when he prayed for his friends: and Jehovah gave Job twice as much
as he had before.

<span id="an_42:11">42:11</span> Then came there unto him all his
brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his
acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they
bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that Jehovah had
brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every
one a ring of gold.

<span id="an_42:12">42:12</span> So Jehovah blessed the latter end of
Job more than his beginning: And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six
thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.

<span id="an_42:13">42:13</span> He had also seven sons and three
daughters.

<span id="an_42:14">42:14</span> And he called the name of the first,
Jemimah: and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third,
Keren-happuch.

<span id="an_42:15">42:15</span> And in all the land were no women found
so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance
among their brethren.

<span id="an_42:16">42:16</span> And after this Job lived a hundred and
forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, \[even\] four
generations.

<span id="an_42:17">42:17</span> So Job died, being old and full of
days.
