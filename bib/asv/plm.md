### American Standard Version: Philemon

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and
Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus
our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house:

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Grace to you and peace from God our Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I thank my God always, making mention of
thee in my prayers,

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> hearing of thy love, and of the faith which
thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> that the fellowship of thy faith may become
effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto
Christ.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For I had much joy and comfort in thy love,
because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee,
brother.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Wherefore, though I have all boldness in
Christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting,

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> yet for love's sake I rather beseech, being
such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus:

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> I beseech thee for my child, whom I have
begotten in my bonds, Onesimus,

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> who once was unprofitable to thee, but
now is profitable to thee and to me:

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> whom I have sent back to thee in his own
person, that is, my very heart:

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> whom I would fain have kept with me, that
in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel:

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> but without thy mind I would do nothing;
that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> For perhaps he was therefore parted
\[from thee\] for a season, that thou shouldest have him for ever;

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> no longer as a servant, but more than a
servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to
thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> If then thou countest me a partner,
receive him as myself.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> But if he hath wronged the at all, or
oweth \[thee\] aught, put that to mine account;

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> I Paul write it with mine own hand, I
will repay it: that I say not unto thee that thou owest to me even thine
own self besides.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in
the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> Having confidence in thine obedience I
write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> But withal prepare me also a lodging: for
I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you.

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ
Jesus, saluteth thee;

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> \[and so do\] Mark, Aristarchus, Demas,
Luke, my fellow-workers.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with your spirit. Amen.
