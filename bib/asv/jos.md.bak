### American Standard Version: Joshua

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Now it came to pass after the death of
Moses the servant of Jehovah, that Jehovah spake unto Joshua the son of
Nun, Moses' minister, saying,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Moses my servant is dead; now therefore
arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land
which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Every place that the sole of your foot
shall tread upon, to you have I given it, as I spake unto Moses.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even
unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites,
and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your
border.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> There shall not any man be able to stand
before thee all the days of thy life. as I was with Moses, so I will be
with thee; I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Be strong and of good courage; for thou
shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I sware unto their
fathers to give them.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Only be strong and very courageous, to
observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded
thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou
mayest have good success whithersoever thou goest.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> This book of the law shall not depart out
of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate thereon day and night, that thou
mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then
thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good
success.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of
good courage; be not affrighted, neither be thou dismayed: for Jehovah
thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Then Joshua commanded the officers of the
people, saying,

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Pass through the midst of the camp, and
command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days
ye are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which
Jehovah your God giveth you to possess it.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> And to the Reubenites, and to the
Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Remember the word which Moses the servant
of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God giveth you rest, and
will give you this land.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> Your wives, your little ones, and your
cattle, shall abide in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan;
but ye shall pass over before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of
valor, and shall help them;

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> until Jehovah have given your brethren
rest, as \[he hath given\] you, and they also have possessed the land
which Jehovah your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land
of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah
gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> And they answered Joshua, saying, All
that thou hast commanded us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest
us we will go.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> According as we hearkened unto Moses in
all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only Jehovah thy God be with
thee, as he was with Moses.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Whosoever he be that shall rebel against
thy commandment, and shall not hearken unto thy words in all that thou
commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of good
courage.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of
Shittim two men as spies secretly, saying, Go, view the land, and
Jericho. And they went and came into the house of a harlot whose name
was Rahab, and lay there.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> And it was told the king of Jericho,
saying, Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of
Israel to search out the land.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab,
saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, that are entered into
thy house; for they are come to search out all the land.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And the woman took the two men, and hid
them; and she said, Yea, the men came unto me, but I knew not whence
they were:

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> and it came to pass about the time of the
shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; whither
the men went I know not: pursue after them quickly; for ye will overtake
them.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> But she had brought them up to the roof,
and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon
the roof.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> And the men pursued after them the way to
the Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they that pursued after them
were gone out, they shut the gate.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> And before they were laid down, she came up
unto them upon the roof;

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> and she said unto the men, I know that
Jehovah hath given you the land, and that the fear of you is fallen upon
us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> For we have heard how Jehovah dried up
the water of the Red Sea before you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what
ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan,
unto Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> And as soon as we had heard it, our
hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man,
because of you: for Jehovah your God, he is God in heaven above, and on
earth beneath.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me
by Jehovah, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye also will deal
kindly with my father's house, and give me a true token;

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> and that ye will save alive my father,
and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have,
and will deliver our lives from death.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> And the men said unto her, Our life for
yours, if ye utter not this our business; and it shall be, when Jehovah
giveth us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> Then she let them down by a cord through
the window: for her house was upon the side of the wall, and she dwelt
upon the wall.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> And she said unto them, Get you to the
mountain, lest the pursuers light upon you; and hide yourselves there
three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your
way.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> And the men said unto her, We will be
guiltless of this thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> Behold, when we come into the land, thou
shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst
let us down by: and thou shalt gather unto thee into the house thy
father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's
household.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> And it shall be, that whosoever shall go
out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon
his head, and we shall be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in
the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> But if thou utter this our business, then
we shall be guiltless of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> And she said, According unto your words,
so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the
scarlet line in the window.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> And they went, and came unto the
mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned:
and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> Then the two men returned, and descended
from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun;
and they told him all that had befallen them.

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> And they said unto Joshua, Truly Jehovah
hath delivered into our hands all the land; and moreover all the
inhabitants of the land do melt away before us.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> And Joshua rose up early in the morning;
and they removed from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the
children of Israel; and they lodged there before they passed over.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> And it came to pass after three days, that
the officers went through the midst of the camp;

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> and they commanded the people, saying, When
ye see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests the
Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after
it.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Yet there shall be a space between you and
it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye
may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way
heretofore.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify
yourselves; for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonders among you.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying,
Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And
they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> And Jehovah said unto Joshua, This day will
I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know
that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> And thou shalt command the priests that
bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of
the waters of the Jordan, ye shall stand still in the Jordan.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> And Joshua said unto the children of
Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of Jehovah your God.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know
that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive
out from before you the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and
the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Behold, the ark of the covenant of the
Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into the Jordan.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Now therefore take you twelve men out of
the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> And it shall come to pass, when the soles
of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all
the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of
the Jordan shall be cut off, even the waters that come down from above;
and they shall stand in one heap.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> And it came to pass, when the people
removed from their tents, to pass over the Jordan, the priests that bare
the ark of the covenant being before the people;

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> and when they that bare the ark were come
unto the Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were
dipped in the brink of the water (for the Jordan overfloweth all its
banks all the time of harvest,)

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> that the waters which came down from
above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city
that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of the
Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off: and the people passed
over right against Jericho.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> And the priests that bare the ark of the
covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan;
and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation were
passed clean over the Jordan.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> And it came to pass, when all the nation
were clean passed over the Jordan, that Jehovah spake unto Joshua,
saying,

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Take you twelve men out of the people, out
of every tribe a man,

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> and command ye them, saying, Take you hence
out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet
stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them
down in the lodging-place, where ye shall lodge this night.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he
had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> and Joshua said unto them, Pass over before
the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan, and take you
up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number
of the tribes of the children of Israel;

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> that this may be a sign among you, that,
when your children ask in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these
stones?

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> then ye shall say unto them, Because the
waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of
Jehovah; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were
cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of
Israel for ever.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> And the children of Israel did so as Joshua
commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as
Jehovah spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the
children of Israel; and they carried them over with them unto the place
where they lodged, and laid them down there.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> And Joshua set up twelve stones in the
midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests that
bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> For the priests that bare the ark stood
in the midst of the Jordan, until everything was finished that Jehovah
commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses
commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> And it came to pass, when all the people
were clean passed over, that the ark of Jehovah passed over, and the
priests, in the presence of the people.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> And the children of Reuben, and the
children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed
before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> about forty thousand ready armed for war
passed over before Jehovah unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in
the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all
the days of his life.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> And Jehovah spake unto Joshua, saying,

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> Command the priests that bear the ark of
the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> Joshua therefore commanded the priests,
saying, Come ye up out of the Jordan.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> And it came to pass, when the priests
that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah were come up out of the
midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up
unto the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned unto their
place, and went over all its banks, as aforetime.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> And the people came up out of the Jordan
on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east
border of Jericho.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> And those twelve stones, which they took
out of the Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> And he spake unto the children of Israel,
saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come,
saying, What mean these stones?

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> Then ye shall let your children know,
saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> For Jehovah your God dried up the waters
of the Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as Jehovah
your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we
were passed over;

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> that all the peoples of the earth may
know the hand of Jehovah, that it is mighty; that ye may fear Jehovah
your God for ever.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> And it came to pass, when all the kings of
the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of
the Canaanites, that were by the sea, heard how that Jehovah had dried
up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we
were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in
them any more, because of the children of Israel.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> At that time Jehovah said unto Joshua, Make
thee knives of flint, and circumcise again the children of Israel the
second time.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> And Joshua made him knives of lint, and
circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> And this is the cause why Joshua did
circumcise: all the people that came forth out of Egypt, that were
males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after
they came forth out of Egypt.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> For all the people that came out were
circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the
way as they came forth out of Egypt, they had not circumcised.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> For the children of Israel walked forty
years in the wilderness, till all the nation, even the men of war that
came forth out of Egypt, were consumed, because they hearkened not unto
the voice of Jehovah: unto whom Jehovah sware that he would not let them
see the land which Jehovah sware unto their fathers that he would give
us, a land flowing with milk and honey.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> And their children, whom he raised up in
their stead, them did Joshua circumcise: for they were uncircumcised,
because they had not circumcised them by the way.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> And it came to pass, when they had done
circumcising all the nation, that they abode in their places in the
camp, till they were whole.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> And Jehovah said unto Joshua, This day have
I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of
that place was called Gilgal, unto this day.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> And the children of Israel encamped in
Gilgal; and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at
even in the plains of Jericho.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And they did eat of the produce of the
land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched
grain, in the selfsame day.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> And the manna ceased on the morrow, after
they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither had the children of
Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of
Canaan that year.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> And it came to pass, when Joshua was by
Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood
a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went
unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> And he said, Nay; but \[as\] prince of
the host of Jehovah am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the
earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his
servant?

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> And the prince of Jehovah's host said
unto Joshua, Put off thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon
thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of
the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> And Jehovah said unto Joshua, See, I have
given into thy hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of
valor.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> And ye shall compass the city, all the men
of war, going about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets
of rams' horns before the ark: and the seventh day ye shall compass the
city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> And it shall be, that, when they make a
long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the
trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of
the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man
straight before him.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> And Joshua the son of Nun called the
priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let
seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of
Jehovah.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> And they said unto the people, Pass on, and
compass the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of
Jehovah.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> And it was so, that, when Joshua had spoken
unto the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams'
horns before Jehovah passed on, and blew the trumpets: and the ark of
the covenant of Jehovah followed them.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> And the armed men went before the priests
that blew the trumpets, and the rearward went after the ark, \[the
priests\] blowing the trumpets as they went.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> And Joshua commanded the people, saying,
Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word
proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye
shout.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> So he caused the ark of Jehovah to
compass the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and
lodged in the camp.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> And Joshua rose early in the morning, and
the priests took up the ark of Jehovah.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> And the seven priests bearing the seven
trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Jehovah went on continually,
and blew the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; and the
rearward came after the ark of Jehovah, \[the priests\] blowing the
trumpets as they went.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> And the second day they compassed the
city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> And it came to pass on the seventh day,
that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and compassed the city
after the same manner seven times: only on the day they compassed the
city seven times.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> And it came to pass at the seventh time,
when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout;
for Jehovah hath given you the city.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> And the city shall be devoted, even it
and all that is therein, to Jehovah: only Rahab the harlot shall live,
she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the
messengers that we sent.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> But as for you, only keep yourselves from
the devoted thing, lest when ye have devoted it, ye take of the devoted
thing; so would ye make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> But all the silver, and gold, and vessels
of brass and iron, are holy unto Jehovah: they shall come into the
treasury of Jehovah.

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> So the people shouted, and \[the
priests\] blew the trumpets; and it came to pass, when the people heard
the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout,
and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city,
every man straight before him, and they took the city.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> And they utterly destroyed all that was
in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep,
and ass, with the edge of the sword.

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> And Joshua said unto the two men that had
spied out the land, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the
woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> And the young men the spies went in, and
brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and
all that she had; all her kindred also they brought out; and they set
them without the camp of Israel.

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> And they burnt the city with fire, and
all that was therein; only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of
brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> But Rahab the harlot, and her father's
household, and all that she had, did Joshua save alive; and she dwelt in
the midst of Israel unto this day, because she hid the messengers, whom
Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> And Joshua charged them with an oath at
that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah, that riseth up and
buildeth this city Jericho: with the loss of his first-born shall he lay
the foundation thereof, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he
set up the gates of it.

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> So Jehovah was with Joshua; and his fame
was in all the land.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> But the children of Israel committed a
trespass in the devoted thing; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of
Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted
thing: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the children of
Israel.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai,
which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spake unto
them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied
out Ai.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> And they returned to Joshua, and said unto
him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand
men go up and smite Ai; make not all the people to toil thither; for
they are but few.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> So there went up thither of the people
about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> And the men of Ai smote of them about
thirty and six men; and they chased them \[from\] before the gate even
unto Shebarim, and smote them at the descent; and the hearts of the
people melted, and became as water.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to
the earth upon his face before the ark of Jehovah until the evening, he
and the elders of Israel; and they put dust upon their heads.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah,
wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to
deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would
that we had been content and dwelt beyond the Jordan!

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that
Israel hath turned their backs before their enemies!

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants
of the land will hear of it, and will compass us round, and cut off our
name from the earth: and what wilt thou do for thy great name?

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Get thee
up; wherefore art thou thus fallen upon thy face?

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even
transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: yea, they have even
taken of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also;
and they have even put it among their own stuff.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> Therefore the children of Israel cannot
stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies,
because they are become accursed: I will not be with you any more,
except ye destroy the devoted thing from among you.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> Up, sanctify the people, and say,
Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for thus saith Jehovah, the God of
Israel, There is a devoted thing in the midst of thee, O Israel; thou
canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the devoted
thing from among you.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> In the morning therefore ye shall be
brought near by your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which
Jehovah taketh shall come near by families; and the family which Jehovah
shall take shall come near by households; and the household which
Jehovah shall take shall come near man by man.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> And it shall be, that he that is taken
with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he
hath; because he hath transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because
he hath wrought folly in Israel.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> So Joshua rose up early in the morning,
and brought Israel near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was
taken:

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> and he brought near the family of Judah;
and he took the family of the Zerahites: and he brought near the family
of the Zerahites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> and he brought near his household man by
man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of
the tribe of Judah, was taken.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give,
I pray thee, glory to Jehovah, the God of Israel, and make confession
unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a
truth I have sinned against Jehovah, the God of Israel, and thus and
thus have I done:

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> when I saw among the spoil a goodly
Babylonish mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of
gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and,
behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the
silver under it.

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran
unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under
it.

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> And they took them from the midst of the
tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel;
and they laid them down before Jehovah.

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took
Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of
gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and
his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them up
unto the valley of Achor.

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled
us? Jehovah shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with
stones; and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> And they raised over him a great heap of
stones, unto this day; and Jehovah turned from the fierceness of his
anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor,
unto this day.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Fear not,
neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and
arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and
his people, and his city, and his land;

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as
thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the
cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: set thee an
ambush for the city behind it.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> So Joshua arose, and all the people of war,
to go up to Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men
of valor, and sent them forth by night.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye
shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city; go not very far
from the city, but be ye all ready:

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> and I, and all the people that are with me,
will approach unto the city. And it shall come to pass, when they come
out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them;

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> and they will come out after us, till we
have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, They flee before
us, as at the first: so we will flee before them;

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> and ye shall rise up from the ambush, and
take possession of the city: for Jehovah your God will deliver it into
your hand.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> And it shall be, when ye have seized upon
the city, that ye shall set the city on fire; according to the word of
Jehovah shall ye do: see, I have commanded you.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> And Joshua sent them forth; and they went
to the ambushment, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of
Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> And Joshua arose up early in the morning,
and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel,
before the people to Ai.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> And all the people, \[even\] the \[men
of\] war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the
city, and encamped on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley
between him and Ai.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> And he took about five thousand men, and
set them in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> So they set the people, even all the host
that was on the north of the city, and their liers-in-wait that were on
the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the
valley.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> And it came to pass, when the king of Ai
saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went
out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time
appointed, before the Arabah; but he knew not that there was an ambush
against him behind the city.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> And Joshua and all Israel made as if they
were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> And all the people that were in the city
were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after
Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> And there was not a man left in Ai or
Beth-el, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open,
and pursued after Israel.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Stretch out
the javelin that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thy
hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward
the city.

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> And the ambush arose quickly out of their
place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and
entered into the city, and took it; and they hasted and set the city on
fire.

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> And when the men of Ai looked behind
them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to
heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the
people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> And when Joshua and all Israel saw that
the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended,
then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> And the others came forth out of the city
against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side,
and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of
them remain or escape.

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> And the king of Ai they took alive, and
brought him to Joshua.

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> And it came to pass, when Israel had made
an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the
wilderness wherein they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the
edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned
unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> And all that fell that day, both of men
and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> For Joshua drew not back his hand,
wherewith he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed
all the inhabitants of Ai.

<span id="an_8:27">8:27</span> Only the cattle and the spoil of that
city Israel took for prey unto themselves, according unto the word of
Jehovah which he commanded Joshua.

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap
for ever, even a desolation, unto this day.

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree
until the eventide: and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded,
and they took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance
of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap of stones, unto
this day.

<span id="an_8:30">8:30</span> Then Joshua built an altar unto Jehovah,
the God of Israel, in mount Ebal,

<span id="an_8:31">8:31</span> as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded
the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of
Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, upon which no man had lifted up any
iron: and they offered thereon burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, and
sacrificed peace-offerings.

<span id="an_8:32">8:32</span> And he wrote there upon the stones a copy
of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the children of
Israel.

<span id="an_8:33">8:33</span> And all Israel, and their elders and
officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that
side before the priests the Levites, that bare the ark of the covenant
of Jehovah, as well the sojourner as the homeborn; half of them in front
of mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of mount Ebal; as Moses the
servant of Jehovah had commanded at the first, that they should bless
the people of Israel.

<span id="an_8:34">8:34</span> And afterward he read all the words of
the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in
the book of the law.

<span id="an_8:35">8:35</span> There was not a word of all that Moses
commanded, which Joshua read not before all the assembly of Israel, and
the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners that were among them.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> And it came to pass, when all the kings
that were beyond the Jordan, in the hill-country, and in the lowland,
and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite,
and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the
Jebusite, heard thereof;

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> that they gathered themselves together, to
fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard
what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> they also did work wilily, and went and
made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their
asses, and wine-skins, old and rent and bound up,

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> and old and patched shoes upon their feet,
and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry
and was become mouldy.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> And they went to Joshua unto the camp at
Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We are come from a
far country: now therefore make ye a covenant with us.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> And the men of Israel said unto the
Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a
covenant with you?

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> And they said unto Joshua, We are thy
servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come
ye?

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> And they said unto him, From a very far
country thy servants are come because of the name of Jehovah thy God:
for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> and all that he did to the two kings of
the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and
to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> And our elders and all the inhabitants of
our country spake to us, saying, Take provision in your hand for the
journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants:
and now make ye a covenant with us.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> This our bread we took hot for our
provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but
now, behold, it is dry, and is become mouldy:

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> and these wine-skins, which we filled,
were new; and, behold, they are rent: and these our garments and our
shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> And the men took of their provision, and
asked not counsel at the mouth of Jehovah.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> And Joshua made peace with them, and made
a covenant with them, to let them live: and the princes of the
congregation sware unto them.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> And it came to pass at the end of three
days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they
were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> And the children of Israel journeyed, and
came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon,
and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> And the children of Israel smote them
not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by
Jehovah, the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against
the princes.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> But all the princes said unto all the
congregation, We have sworn unto them by Jehovah, the God of Israel: now
therefore we may not touch them.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> This we will do to them, and let them
live; lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto
them.

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> And the princes said unto them, Let them
live: so they became hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the
congregation, as the princes had spoken unto them.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> And Joshua called for them, and he spake
unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very
far from you; when ye dwell among us?

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> Now therefore ye are cursed, and there
shall never fail to be of you bondmen, both hewers of wood and drawers
of water for the house of my God.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> And they answered Joshua, and said,
Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that Jehovah thy God
commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all
the inhabitants of the land from before you; therefore we were sore
afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> And now, behold, we are in thy hand: as
it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> And so did he unto them, and delivered
them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> And Joshua made them that day hewers of
wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of
Jehovah, unto this day, in the place which he should choose.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek
king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly
destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to
Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with
Israel, and were among them;

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> that they feared greatly, because Gibeon
was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater
than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem
sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto
Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> Come up unto me, and help me, and let us
smite Gibeon; for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children
of Israel.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> Therefore the five kings of the Amorites,
the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king
of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went
up, they and all their hosts, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war
against it.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to
the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come
up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the
Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered together against
us.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and
all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Fear them
not: for I have delivered them into thy hands; there shall not a man of
them stand before thee.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly;
\[for\] he went up from Gilgal all the night.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> And Jehovah discomfited them before
Israel, and he slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased
them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah,
and unto Makkedah.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> And it came to pass, as they fled from
before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that
Jehovah cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and
they died: they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom
the children of Israel slew with the sword.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> Then spake Joshua to Jehovah in the day
when Jehovah delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel;
and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon;
And thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> And the sun stood still, and the moon
stayed, Until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Is not
this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of
heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> And there was no day like that before
it or after it, that Jehovah hearkened unto the voice of a man: for
Jehovah fought for Israel.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> And Joshua returned, and all Israel
with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> And these five kings fled, and hid
themselves in the cave at Makkedah.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> And it was told Joshua, saying, The
five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> And Joshua said, Roll great stones unto
the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them:

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> but stay not ye; pursue after your
enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into
their cities: for Jehovah your God hath delivered them into your hand.

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> And it came to pass, when Joshua and
the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great
slaughter, till they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of
them had entered into the fortified cities,

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> that all the people returned to the
camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any
of the children of Israel.

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the
cave, and bring forth those five kings unto me out of the cave.

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> And they did so, and brought forth
those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the
king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of
Eglon.

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> And it came to pass, when they brought
forth those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of
Israel, and said unto the chiefs of the men of war that went with him,
Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came
near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> And Joshua said unto them, Fear not,
nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage: for thus shall Jehovah
do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> And afterward Joshua smote them, and
put them to death, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging
upon the trees until the evening.

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> And it came to pass at the time of the
going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down
off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had hidden
themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, unto this
very day.

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> And Joshua took Makkedah on that day,
and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof: he
utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein; he left none
remaining; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done unto the
king of Jericho.

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and
all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> and Jehovah delivered it also, and the
king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of
the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining
in it; and he did unto the king thereof as he had done unto the king of
Jericho.

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all
Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought
against it:

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> and Jehovah delivered Lachish into the
hand of Israel; and he took it on the second day, and smote it with the
edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all
that he had done to Libnah.

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> Then Horam king of Gezer came up to
help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him
none remaining.

<span id="an_10:34">10:34</span> And Joshua passed from Lachish, and all
Israel with him, unto Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought
against it;

<span id="an_10:35">10:35</span> and they took it on that day, and smote
it with the edge of the sword; and all the souls that were therein he
utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to
Lachish.

<span id="an_10:36">10:36</span> And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all
Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:

<span id="an_10:37">10:37</span> and they took it, and smote it with the
edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and
all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to
all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the
souls that were therein.

<span id="an_10:38">10:38</span> And Joshua returned, and all Israel
with him, to Debir, and fought against it:

<span id="an_10:39">10:39</span> and he took it, and the king thereof,
and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the
sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left
none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the
king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to the king thereof.

<span id="an_10:40">10:40</span> So Joshua smote all the land, the
hill-country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all
their kings: he left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that
breathed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, commanded.

<span id="an_10:41">10:41</span> And Joshua smote them from
Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto
Gibeon.

<span id="an_10:42">10:42</span> And all these kings and their land did
Joshua take at one time, because Jehovah, the God of Israel, fought for
Israel.

<span id="an_10:43">10:43</span> And Joshua returned, and all Israel
with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> And it came to pass, when Jabin king of
Hazor heard thereof, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the
king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> and to the kings that were on the north,
in the hill-country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the
lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> to the Canaanite on the east and on the
west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the
Jebusite in the hill-country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of
Mizpah.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> And they went out, they and all their
hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the
sea-shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> And all these kings met together; and
they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with
Israel.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Be not
afraid because of them; for to-morrow at this time will I deliver them
up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hock their horses, and burn their
chariots with fire.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> So Joshua came, and all the people of war
with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell upon
them.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> And Jehovah delivered them into the hand
of Israel, and they smote them, and chased them unto great Sidon, and
unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they
smote them, until they left them none remaining.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> And Joshua did unto them as Jehovah bade
him: he hocked their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> And Joshua turned back at that time,
and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor
beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> And they smote all the souls that were
therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; there was
none left that breathed: and he burnt Hazor with fire.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> And all the cities of those kings, and
all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and he smote them with the edge
of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of
Jehovah commanded.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> But as for the cities that stood on
their mounds, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did
Joshua burn.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> And all the spoil of these cities, and
the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but
every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had
destroyed them, neither left they any that breathed.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> As Jehovah commanded Moses his servant,
so did Moses command Joshua: and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone
of all that Jehovah commanded Moses.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> So Joshua took all that land, the
hill-country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the
lowland, and the Arabah, and the hill-country of Israel, and the lowland
of the same;

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> from mount Halak, that goeth up to
Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon:
and all their kings he took, and smote them, and put them to death.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> Joshua made war a long time with all
those kings.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> There was not a city that made peace
with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon:
they took all in battle.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> For it was of Jehovah to harden their
hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy
them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as
Jehovah commanded Moses.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> And Joshua came at that time, and cut
off the Anakim from the hill-country, from Hebron, from Debir, from
Anab, and from all the hill-country of Judah, and from all the
hill-country of Israel: Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> There was none of the Anakim left in
the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in
Ashdod, did some remain.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> So Joshua took the whole land,
according to all that Jehovah spake unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for
an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes.
And the land had rest from war.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> Now these are the kings of the land, whom
the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land beyond the Jordan
toward the sunrising, from the valley of the Arnon unto mount Hermon,
and all the Arabah eastward:

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in
Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the
Arnon, and \[the city that is in\] the middle of the valley, and half
Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> and the Arabah unto the sea of
Chinneroth, eastward, and unto the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea,
eastward, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes
of Pisgah:

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> and the border of Og king of Bashan, of
the remnant of the Rephaim, who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> and ruled in mount Hermon, and in
Salecah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the
Maacathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> Moses the servant of Jehovah and the
children of Israel smote them: and Moses the servant of Jehovah gave it
for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the
half-tribe of Manasseh.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> And these are the kings of the land whom
Joshua and the children of Israel smote beyond the Jordan westward, from
Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even unto mount Halak, that goeth up
to Seir; and Joshua gave it unto the tribes of Israel for a possession
according to their divisions;

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> in the hill-country, and in the lowland,
and in the Arabah, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the
South; the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the
Hivite, and the Jebusite:

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai,
which is beside Bethel, one;

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of
Hebron, one;

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of
Lachish, one;

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> the king of Eglon, one; the king of
Gezer, one;

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> the king of Debir, one; the king of
Geder, one;

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> the king of Hormah, one; the king of
Arad, one;

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> the king of Libnah, one; the king of
Adullam, one;

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> the king of Makkedah, one; the king of
Bethel, one;

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> the king of Tappuah, one; the king of
Hepher, one;

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> the king of Aphek, one; the king of
Lassharon, one;

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> the king of Madon, one; the king of
Hazor, one;

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> the king of Shimron-meron, one; the
king of Achshaph, one;

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> the king of Taanach, one; the king of
Megiddo, one;

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> the king of Kedesh, one; the king of
Jokneam in Carmel, one;

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> the king of Dor in the height of Dor,
one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one;

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> the king of Tirzah, one: all the kings
thirty and one.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> Now Joshua was old and well stricken in
years; and Jehovah said unto him, Thou art old and well stricken in
years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> This is the land that yet remaineth: all
the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> from the Shihor, which is before Egypt,
even unto the border of Ekron northward, \[which\] is reckoned to the
Canaanites; the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the
Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the
Avvim,

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> on the south; all the land of the
Canaanites, and Mearah that belongeth to the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to
the border of the Amorites;

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> and the land of the Gebalites, and all
Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon unto the
entrance of Hamath;

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> all the inhabitants of the hill-country
from Lebanon unto Misrephoth-maim, even all the Sidonians; them will I
drive out from before the children of Israel: only allot thou it unto
Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> Now therefore divide this land for an
inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> With him the Reubenites and the Gadites
received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan
eastward, even as Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them:

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> from Aroer, that is on the edge of the
valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley,
and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> and all the cities of Sihon king of the
Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of
Ammon;

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> and Gilead, and the border of the
Geshurites and Maacathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto
Salecah;

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who
reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of
the Rephaim); for these did Moses smite, and drove them out.

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> Nevertheless the children of Israel
drove not out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites: but Geshur and
Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel unto this day.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave no
inheritance; the offerings of Jehovah, the God of Israel, made by fire
are his inheritance, as he spake unto him.

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> And Moses gave unto the tribe of the
children of Reuben according to their families.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> And their border was from Aroer, that
is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the
middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> Heshbon, and all its cities that are in
the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon,

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and
Zereth-shahar in the mount of the valley,

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> and Beth-peor, and the slopes of
Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth,

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> and all the cities of the plain, and
all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon,
whom Moses smote with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and
Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon, that dwelt in the land.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> Balaam also the son of Beor, the
soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among the
rest of their slain.

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> And the border of the children of
Reuben was the Jordan, and the border \[thereof\]. This was the
inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, the
cities and the villages thereof.

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> And Moses gave unto the tribe of Gad,
unto the children of Gad, according to their families.

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> And their border was Jazer, and all the
cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer
that is before Rabbah;

<span id="an_13:26">13:26</span> and from Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh,
and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;

<span id="an_13:27">13:27</span> and in the valley, Beth-haram, and
Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon
king of Heshbon, the Jordan and the border \[thereof\], unto the
uttermost part of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward.

<span id="an_13:28">13:28</span> This is the inheritance of the children
of Gad according to their families, the cities and the villages thereof.

<span id="an_13:29">13:29</span> And Moses gave \[inheritance\] unto the
half-tribe of Manasseh: and it was for the half-tribe of the children of
Manasseh according to their families.

<span id="an_13:30">13:30</span> And their border was from Mahanaim, all
Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair,
which are in Bashan, threescore cities:

<span id="an_13:31">13:31</span> and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and
Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children
of Machir the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children of
Machir according to their families.

<span id="an_13:32">13:32</span> These are the inheritances which Moses
distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho,
eastward.

<span id="an_13:33">13:33</span> But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave
no inheritance: Jehovah, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as he
spake unto them.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> And these are the inheritances which the
children of Israel took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest,
and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' \[houses\] of
the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed unto them,

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> by the lot of their inheritance, as
Jehovah commanded by Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> For Moses had given the inheritance of
the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan: but unto the
Levites he gave no inheritance among them.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> For the children of Joseph were two
tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: and they gave no portion unto the Levites
in the land, save cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for their
cattle and for their substance.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> As Jehovah commanded Moses, so the
children of Israel did; and they divided the land.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> Then the children of Judah drew nigh unto
Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said unto
him, Thou knowest the thing that Jehovah spake unto Moses the man of God
concerning me and concerning thee in Kadesh-barnea.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> Forty years old was I when Moses the
servant of Jehovah sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land; and I
brought him word again as it was in my heart.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> Nevertheless my brethren that went up
with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed Jehovah
my God.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> And Moses sware on that day, saying,
Surely the land whereon thy foot hath trodden shall be an inheritance to
thee and to thy children for ever, because thou hast wholly followed
Jehovah my God.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> And now, behold, Jehovah hath kept me
alive, as he spake, these forty and five years, from the time that
Jehovah spake this word unto Moses, while Israel walked in the
wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> As yet I am as strong this day as I as
in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my
strength now, for war, and to go out and to come in.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> Now therefore give me this
hill-country, whereof Jehovah spake in that day; for thou heardest in
that day how the Anakim were there, and cities great and fortified: it
may be that Jehovah will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as
Jehovah spake.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> And Joshua blessed him; and he gave
Hebron unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> Therefore Hebron became the inheritance
of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite unto this day; because that
he wholly followed Jehovah, the God of Israel.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> Now the name of Hebron beforetime was
Kiriath-arba; \[which Arba was\] the greatest man among the Anakim. And
the land had rest from war.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> And the lot for the tribe of the children
of Judah according to their families was unto the border of Edom, even
to the wilderness of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of the south.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> And their south border was from the
uttermost part of the Salt Sea, from the bay that looketh southward;

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> and it went out southward of the ascent
of Akrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and went up by the south of
Kadesh-barnea, and passed along by Hezron, and went up to Addar, and
turned about to Karka;

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> and it passed along to Azmon, and went
out at the brook of Egypt; and the goings out of the border were at the
sea: this shall be your south border.

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> And the east border was the Salt Sea,
even unto the end of the Jordan. And the border of the north quarter was
from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan;

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> and the border went up to Beth-hoglah,
and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to
the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben;

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> and the border went up to Debir from the
valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over
against the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river;
and the border passed along to the waters of En-shemesh, and the goings
out thereof were at En-rogel;

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> and the border went up by the valley of
the son of Hinnom unto the side of the Jebusite southward (the same is
Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth
before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the uttermost part of
the vale of Rephaim northward;

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> and the border extended from the top of
the mountain unto the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out
to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border extended to Baalah (the
same is Kiriath-jearim);

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> and the border turned about from Baalah
westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim
on the north (the same is Chesalon), and went down to Beth-shemesh, and
passed along by Timnah;

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> and the border went out unto the side
of Ekron northward; and the border extended to Shikkeron, and passed
along to mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings out of
the border were at the sea.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> And the west border was to the great
sea, and the border \[thereof\]. This is the border of the children of
Judah round about according to their families.

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he
gave a portion among the children of Judah, according to the commandment
of Jehovah to Joshua, even Kiriath-arba, \[which Arba was\] the father
of Anak (the same is Hebron).

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> And Caleb drove out thence the three
sons of Anak: Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> And he went up thence against the
inhabitants of Debir: now the name of Debir beforetime was
Kiriath-sepher.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> And Caleb said, He that smiteth
Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to
wife.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the
brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> And it came to pass, when she came
\[unto him\], that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she
alighted from off her ass; and Caleb said, What wouldest thou?

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> And she said, Give me a blessing; for
that thou hast set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of
water. And he gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of
the children of Judah according to their families.

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> And the uttermost cities of the tribe
of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom in the South were
Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> and Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> and Hazor-hadattah, and Kerioth-hezron
(the same is Hazor),

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> and Hazar-gaddah, and Heshmon, and
Beth-pelet,

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> and Hazar-shual, and Beer-sheba, and
Biziothiah,

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> Baalah, and Iim, and Ezem,

<span id="an_15:30">15:30</span> and Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,

<span id="an_15:31">15:31</span> and Ziklag, and Madmannah, and
Sansannah,

<span id="an_15:32">15:32</span> and Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and
Rimmon: all the cities are twenty and nine, with their villages.

<span id="an_15:33">15:33</span> In the lowland, Eshtaol, and Zorah, and
Ashnah,

<span id="an_15:34">15:34</span> and Zanoah, and En-gannim, Tappuah, and
Enam,

<span id="an_15:35">15:35</span> Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and

<span id="an_15:39">15:39</span> Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,

<span id="an_15:40">15:40</span> and Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Chitlish,

<span id="an_15:41">15:41</span> and Gederoth, Beth-dagon, and Naamah,
and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages.

<span id="an_15:42">15:42</span> Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,

<span id="an_15:43">15:43</span> and Iphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,

<span id="an_15:44">15:44</span> and Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah;
nine cities with their villages.

<span id="an_15:45">15:45</span> Ekron, with its towns and its villages;

<span id="an_15:46">15:46</span> from Ekron even unto the sea, all that
were by the side of Ashdod, with their villages.

<span id="an_15:47">15:47</span> Ashdod, its towns and its villages;
Gaza, its towns and its villages; unto the brook of Egypt, and the great
sea, and the border \[thereof\].

<span id="an_15:48">15:48</span> And in the hill-country, Shamir, and
Jattir, and Socoh,

<span id="an_15:49">15:49</span> and Dannah, and Kiriath-sannah (the
same is Debir),

<span id="an_15:50">15:50</span> and Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,

<span id="an_15:51">15:51</span> and Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh;
eleven cities with their villages.

<span id="an_15:52">15:52</span> Arab, and Dumah, and Eshan,

<span id="an_15:53">15:53</span> and Janim, and Beth-tappuah, and
Aphekah,

<span id="an_15:54">15:54</span> and Humtah, and Kiriath-arba (the same
is Hebron), and Zior; nine cities with their villages.

<span id="an_15:55">15:55</span> Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Jutah,

<span id="an_15:56">15:56</span> and Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,

<span id="an_15:57">15:57</span> Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities
with their villages.

<span id="an_15:58">15:58</span> Halhul, Beth-zur, and Gedor,

<span id="an_15:59">15:59</span> and Maarath, and Beth-anoth, and
Eltekon; six cities with their villages.

<span id="an_15:60">15:60</span> Kiriath-baal (the same is
Kiriath-jearim), and Rabbah; two cities with their villages.

<span id="an_15:61">15:61</span> In the wilderness, Beth-arabah, Middin,
and Secacah,

<span id="an_15:62">15:62</span> and Nibshan, and the City of Salt, and
En-gedi; six cities with their villages.

<span id="an_15:63">15:63</span> And as for the Jebusites, the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them
out: but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem
unto this day.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> And the lot came out for the children of
Joseph from the Jordan at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho on the east,
even the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill-country to
Beth-el;

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> and it went out from Beth-el to Luz, and
passed along unto the border of the Archites to Ataroth;

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> and it went down westward to the border
of the Japhletites, unto the border of Beth-horon the nether, even unto
Gezer; and the goings out thereof were at the sea.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> And the children of Joseph, Manasseh and
Ephraim, took their inheritance.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> And the border of the children of Ephraim
according to their families was \[thus\]: the border of their
inheritance eastward was Ataroth-addar, unto Beth-horon the upper;

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> and the border went out westward at
Michmethath on the north; and the border turned about eastward unto
Taanath-shiloh, and passed along it on the east of Janoah;

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> and it went down from Janoah to Ataroth,
and to Naarah, and reached unto Jericho, and went out at the Jordan.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> From Tappuah the border went along
westward to the brook of Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the
sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim
according to their families;

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> together with the cities which were set
apart for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the
children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> And they drove not out the Canaanites
that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim
unto this day, and are become servants to do taskwork.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> And \[this\] was the lot for the tribe of
Manasseh; for he was the first-born of Joseph. As for Machir the
first-born of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of
war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> So \[the lot\] was for the rest of the
children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of
Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel,
and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for
the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the
son of Joseph according to their families.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the
son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but
daughters: and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, and Noah,
Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> And they came near before Eleazar the
priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes,
saying, Jehovah commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our
brethren: therefore according to the commandment of Jehovah he gave them
an inheritance among the brethren of their father.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> And there fell ten parts to Manasseh,
besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> because the daughters of Manasseh had an
inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead belonged unto the
rest of the sons of Manasseh.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> And the border of Manasseh was from Asher
to Michmethath, which is before Shechem; and the border went along to
the right hand, unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah.

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh;
but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of
Ephraim.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> And the border went down unto the brook
of Kanah, southward of the brook: these cities belonged to Ephraim among
the cities of Manasseh: and the border of Manasseh was on the north side
of the brook, and the goings out thereof were at the sea:

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> southward it was Ephraim's, and
northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea was his border; and they
reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> And Manasseh had in Issachar and in
Asher Beth-shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the
inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its
towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants
of Megiddo and its towns, even the three heights.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> Yet the children of Manasseh could not
drive out \[the inhabitants of\] those cities; but the Canaanites would
dwell in that land.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> And it came to pass, when the children
of Israel were waxed strong, that they put the Canaanites to taskwork,
and did not utterly drive them out.

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> And the children of Joseph spake unto
Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one part for an
inheritance, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as hitherto Jehovah
hath blessed me?

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> And Joshua said unto them, If thou be a
great people, get thee up to the forest, and cut down for thyself there
in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill-country
of Ephraim is too narrow for thee.

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> And the children of Joseph said, The
hill-country is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in
the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are in
Beth-shean and its towns, and they who are in the valley of Jezreel.

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> And Joshua spake unto the house of
Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great
people, and hast great power; thou shalt not have one lot only:

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> but the hill-country shall be thine;
for though it is a forest, thou shalt cut it down, and the goings out
thereof shall be thine; for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though
they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> And the whole congregation of the
children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set up
the tent of meeting there: and the land was subdued before them.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> And there remained among the children of
Israel seven tribes, which had not yet divided their inheritance.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> And Joshua said unto the children of
Israel, How long are ye slack to go in to possess the land, which
Jehovah, the God of your fathers, hath given you?

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> Appoint for you three men of each tribe:
and I will send them, and they shall arise, and walk through the land,
and describe it according to their inheritance; and they shall come unto
me.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> And they shall divide it into seven
portions: Judah shall abide in his border on the south, and the house of
Joseph shall abide in their border on the north.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> And ye shall describe the land into seven
portions, and bring \[the description\] hither to me; and I will cast
lots for you here before Jehovah our God.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> For the Levites have no portion among
you; for the priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance: and Gad and
Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance
beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave
them.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> And the men arose, and went: and Joshua
charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through
the land, and describe it, and come again to me; and I will cast lots
for you here before Jehovah in Shiloh.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> And the men went and passed through the
land, and described it by cities into seven portions in a book; and they
came to Joshua unto the camp at Shiloh.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh
before Jehovah: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of
Israel according to their divisions.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> And the lot of the tribe of the
children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the border
of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of
Joseph.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> And their border on the north quarter
was from the Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on
the north, and went up through the hill-country westward; and the goings
out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth-aven.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> And the border passed along from thence
to Luz, to the side of Luz (the same is Beth-el), southward; and the
border went down to Ataroth-addar, by the mountain that lieth on the
south of Beth-horon the nether.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> And the border extended \[thence\], and
turned about on the west quarter southward, from the mountain that lieth
before Beth-horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at
Kiriath-baal (the same is Kiriath-jearim), a city of the children of
Judah: this was the west quarter.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> And the south quarter was from the
uttermost part of Kiriath-jearim; and the border went out westward, and
went out to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah;

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> and the border went down to the
uttermost part of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son
of Hinnom, which is in the vale of Rephaim northward; and it went down
to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went
down to En-rogel;

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> and it extended northward, and went out
at En-shemesh, and went out to Geliloth, which is over against the
ascent of Adummim; and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of
Reuben;

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> and it passed along to the side over
against the Arabah northward, and went down unto the Arabah;

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> and the border passed along to the side
of Beth-hoglah northward; and the goings out of the border were at the
north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan: this was the
south border.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> And the Jordan was the border of it on
the east quarter. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin,
by the borders thereof round about, according to their families.

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> Now the cities of the tribe of the
children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and
Beth-hoglah, and Emek-keziz,

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> and Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and
Beth-el,

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> and Avvim, and Parah, and Ophrah,

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> and Chephar-ammoni, and Ophni, and
Geba; twelve cities with their villages:

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> and Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> and Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> and Zelah, Eleph, and the Jebusite (the
same is Jerusalem), Gibeath, \[and\] Kiriath; fourteen cities with their
villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according
to their families.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> And the second lot came out for Simeon,
even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their
families: and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of
the children of Judah.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> And they had for their inheritance
Beer-sheba, or Sheba, and Moladah,

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> and Hazar-shual, and Balah, and Ezem,

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> and Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> and Ziklag, and Beth-marcaboth, and
Hazar-susah,

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> and Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen
cities with their villages:

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> Ain, Rimmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four
cities with their villages:

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> and all the villages that were round
about these cities to Baalath-beer, Ramah of the South. This is the
inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their
families.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> Out of the part of the children of Judah
was the inheritance of the children of Simeon; for the portion of the
children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of
Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> And the third lot came up for the
children of Zebulun according to their families; and the border of their
inheritance was unto Sarid;

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> and their border went up westward, even
to Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth; and it reached to the brook that
is before Jokneam;

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> and it turned from Sarid eastward
toward the sunrising unto the border of Chisloth-tabor; and it went out
to Daberath, and went up to Japhia;

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> and from thence it passed along
eastward to Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin; and it went out at Rimmon which
stretcheth unto Neah;

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> and the border turned about it on the
north to Hannathon; and the goings out thereof were at the valley of
Iphtah-el;

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> and Kattath, and Nahalal, and Shimron,
and Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> This is the inheritance of the children
of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their
villages.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> The fourth lot came out for Issachar,
even for the children of Issachar according to their families.

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> And their border was unto Jezreel, and
Chesulloth, and Shunem,

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> and Hapharaim, and Shion, and
Anaharath,

<span id="an_19:20">19:20</span> and Rabbith, and Kishion, and Ebez,

<span id="an_19:21">19:21</span> and Remeth, and Engannim, and
En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez,

<span id="an_19:22">19:22</span> and the border reached to Tabor, and
Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh; and the goings out of their border were at
the Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.

<span id="an_19:23">19:23</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of
the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities with
their villages.

<span id="an_19:24">19:24</span> And the fifth lot came out for the
tribe of the children of Asher according to their families.

<span id="an_19:25">19:25</span> And their border was Helkath, and Hali,
and Beten, and Achshaph,

<span id="an_19:26">19:26</span> and Allammelech, and Amad, and Mishal;
and it reached to Carmel westward, and to Shihor-libnath;

<span id="an_19:27">19:27</span> and it turned toward the sunrising to
Beth-dagon, and reached to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtah-el
northward to Beth-emek and Neiel; and it went out to Cabul on the left
hand,

<span id="an_19:28">19:28</span> and Ebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and
Kanah, even unto great Sidon;

<span id="an_19:29">19:29</span> and the border turned to Ramah, and to
the fortified city of Tyre; and the border turned to Hosah; and the
goings out thereof were at the sea by the region of Achzib;

<span id="an_19:30">19:30</span> Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob:
twenty and two cities with their villages.

<span id="an_19:31">19:31</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of
the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with
their villages.

<span id="an_19:32">19:32</span> The sixth lot came out for the children
of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their
families.

<span id="an_19:33">19:33</span> And their border was from Heleph, from
the oak in Zaanannim, and Adaminekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakkum; and the
goings out thereof were at the Jordan;

<span id="an_19:34">19:34</span> and the border turned westward to
Aznoth-tabor, and went out from thence to Hukkok; and it reached to
Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at
the Jordan toward the sunrising.

<span id="an_19:35">19:35</span> And the fortified cities were Ziddim,
Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,

<span id="an_19:36">19:36</span> and Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,

<span id="an_19:37">19:37</span> and Kedesh, and Edrei, and En-hazor,

<span id="an_19:38">19:38</span> And Iron, and Migdal-el, Horem, and
Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.

<span id="an_19:39">19:39</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of
the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities with
their villages.

<span id="an_19:40">19:40</span> The seventh lot came out for the tribe
of the children of Dan according to their families.

<span id="an_19:41">19:41</span> And the border of their inheritance was
Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Ir-shemesh,

<span id="an_19:42">19:42</span> and Shaalabbin, and Aijalon, and
Ithlah,

<span id="an_19:43">19:43</span> and Elon, and Timnah, and Ekron,

<span id="an_19:44">19:44</span> and Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and
Baalath,

<span id="an_19:45">19:45</span> and Jehud, and Bene-berak, and
Gath-rimmon,

<span id="an_19:46">19:46</span> and Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the
border over against Joppa.

<span id="an_19:47">19:47</span> And the border of the children of Dan
went out beyond them; for the children of Dan went up and fought against
Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and
possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name
of Dan their father.

<span id="an_19:48">19:48</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of
the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their
villages.

<span id="an_19:49">19:49</span> So they made an end of distributing the
land for inheritance by the borders thereof; and the children of Israel
gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them:

<span id="an_19:50">19:50</span> according to the commandment of Jehovah
they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah in the
hill-country of Ephraim; and he built the city, and dwelt therein.

<span id="an_19:51">19:51</span> These are the inheritances, which
Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the
fathers' \[houses\] of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed
for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Jehovah, at the door of the tent
of meeting. So they made an end of dividing the land.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> And Jehovah spake unto Joshua, saying,

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> Speak to the children of Israel, saying,
Assign you the cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by Moses,

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> that the manslayer that killeth any
person unwittingly \[and\] unawares may flee thither: and they shall be
unto you for a refuge from the avenger of blood.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> And he shall flee unto one of those
cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and
declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city; and they shall
take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may
dwell among them.

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> And if the avenger of blood pursue after
him, then they shall not deliver up the manslayer into his hand; because
he smote his neighbor unawares, and hated him not beforetime.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> And he shall dwell in that city, until he
stand before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the high
priest that shall be in those days: then shall the manslayer return, and
come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from
whence he fled.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> And they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in
the hill-country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill-country of
Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron) in the hill-country of
Judah.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> And beyond the Jordan at Jericho
eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the plain out of the
tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan
in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> These were the appointed cities for all
the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them,
that whosoever killeth any person unwittingly might flee thither, and
not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the
congregation.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> Then came near the heads of fathers'
\[houses\] of the Levites unto Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the
son of Nun, and unto the heads of fathers' \[houses\] of the tribes of
the children of Israel;

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> and they spake unto them at Shiloh in the
land of Canaan, saying, Jehovah commanded Moses to give us cities to
dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> And the children of Israel gave unto the
Levites out of their inheritance, according to the commandment of
Jehovah, these cities with their suburbs.

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> And the lot came out for the families of
the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the
Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of
the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> And the rest of the children of Kohath
had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the
tribe of Dan, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> And the children of Gershon had by lot
out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of
Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe of
Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> The children of Merari according to their
families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad,
and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> And the children of Israel gave by lot
unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as Jehovah commanded
by Moses.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> And they gave out of the tribe of the
children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these
cities which are \[here\] mentioned by name:

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> and they were for the children of
Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of
Levi; for theirs was the first lot.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> And they gave them Kiriath-arba,
\[which Arba was\] the father of Anak (the same is Hebron), in the
hill-country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it.

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> But the fields of the city, and the
villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his
possession.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> And unto the children of Aaron the
priest they gave Hebron with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the
manslayer, and Libnah with its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> and Jattir with its suburbs, and
Eshtemoa with its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> and Holon with its suburbs, and Debir
with its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> and Ain with its suburbs, and Juttah
with its suburbs, \[and\] Beth-shemesh with its suburbs; nine cities out
of those two tribes.

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> And out of the tribe of Benjamin,
Gibeon with its suburbs, Geba with its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon
with its suburbs; four cities.

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> All the cities of the children of
Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> And the families of the children of
Kohath, the Levites, even the rest of the children of Kohath, they had
the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> And they gave them Shechem with its
suburbs in the hill-country of Ephraim, the city of refuge for the
manslayer, and Gezer with its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> and Kibzaim with its suburbs, and
Beth-horon with its suburbs; four cities.

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> And out of the tribe of Dan, Elteke
with its suburbs, Gibbethon with its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> Aijalon with its suburbs, Gath-rimmon
with its suburbs; four cities.

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> And out of the half-tribe of Manasseh,
Taanach with its suburbs, and Gath-rimmon with its suburbs; two cities.

<span id="an_21:26">21:26</span> All the cities of the families of the
rest of the children of Kohath were ten with their suburbs.

<span id="an_21:27">21:27</span> And unto the children of Gershon, of
the families of the Levites, out of the half-tribe of Manasseh \[they
gave\] Golan in Bashan with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the
manslayer, and Be-eshterah with its suburbs; two cities.

<span id="an_21:28">21:28</span> And out of the tribe of Issachar,
Kishion with its suburbs, Daberath with its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:29">21:29</span> Jarmuth with its suburbs, En-gannim
with its suburbs; four cities.

<span id="an_21:30">21:30</span> And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal
with its suburbs, Abdon with its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:31">21:31</span> Helkath with its suburbs, and Rehob
with its suburbs; four cities.

<span id="an_21:32">21:32</span> And out of the tribe of Naphtali,
Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the
manslayer, and Hammoth-dor with its suburbs, and Kartan with its
suburbs; three cities.

<span id="an_21:33">21:33</span> All the cities of the Gershonites
according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs.

<span id="an_21:34">21:34</span> And unto the families of the children
of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam
with its suburbs, and Kartah with its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:35">21:35</span> Dimnah with its suburbs, Nahalal with
its suburbs; four cities.

<span id="an_21:36">21:36</span> And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer
with its suburbs, and Jahaz with its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:37">21:37</span> Kedemoth with its suburbs, and Mephaath
with its suburbs; four cities.

<span id="an_21:38">21:38</span> And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in
Gilead with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and
Mahanaim with its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:39">21:39</span> Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer with
its suburbs; four cities in all.

<span id="an_21:40">21:40</span> All \[these were\] the cities of the
children of Merari according to their families, even the rest of the
families of the Levites; and their lot was twelve cities.

<span id="an_21:41">21:41</span> All the cities of the Levites in the
midst of the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight
cities with their suburbs.

<span id="an_21:42">21:42</span> These cities were every one with their
suburbs round about them: thus it was with all these cities.

<span id="an_21:43">21:43</span> So Jehovah gave unto Israel all the
land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it,
and dwelt therein.

<span id="an_21:44">21:44</span> And Jehovah gave them rest round about,
according to all that he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a
man of all their enemies before them; Jehovah delivered all their
enemies into their hand.

<span id="an_21:45">21:45</span> There failed not aught of any good
thing which Jehovah had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to
pass.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and
the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> and said unto them, Ye have kept all that
Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, and have hearkened unto my
voice in all that I commanded you:

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> ye have not left your brethren these many
days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of
Jehovah your God.

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> And now Jehovah your God hath given rest
unto your brethren, as he spake unto them: therefore now turn ye, and
get you unto your tents, unto the land of your possession, which Moses
the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> Only take diligent heed to do the
commandment and the law which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded
you, to love Jehovah your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep
his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your
heart and with all your soul.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> So Joshua blessed them, and sent them
away; and they went unto their tents.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh
Moses had given \[inheritance\] in Bashan; but unto the other half gave
Joshua among their brethren beyond the Jordan westward; moreover when
Joshua sent them away unto their tents, he blessed them,

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> and spake unto them, saying, Return with
much wealth unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and
with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment:
divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> And the children of Reuben and the
children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed
from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of
Canaan, to go unto the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession,
whereof they were possessed, according to the commandment of Jehovah by
Moses.

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> And when they came unto the region
about the Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben
and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an
altar by the Jordan, a great altar to look upon.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> And the children of Israel heard say,
Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land
of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that pertaineth
to the children of Israel.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> And when the children of Israel heard
of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered
themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war.

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> And the children of Israel sent unto
the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the
half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of
Eleazar the priest,

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> and with him ten princes, one prince of
a fathers' house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were every
one of them head of their fathers' houses among the thousands of Israel.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> And they came unto the children of
Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh,
unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> Thus saith the whole congregation of
Jehovah, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of
Israel, to turn away this day from following Jehovah, in that ye have
builded you an altar, to rebel this day against Jehovah?

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> Is the iniquity of Peor too little for
us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves unto this day, although
there came a plague upon the congregation of Jehovah,

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> that ye must turn away this day from
following Jehovah? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to-day against
Jehovah, that to-morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of
Israel.

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> Howbeit, if the land of your possession
be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of
Jehovah, wherein Jehovah's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession
among us: but rebel not against Jehovah, nor rebel against us, in
building you an altar besides the altar of Jehovah our God.

<span id="an_22:20">22:20</span> Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a
trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell upon all the congregation
of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.

<span id="an_22:21">22:21</span> Then the children of Reuben and the
children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spake unto
the heads of the thousands of Israel,

<span id="an_22:22">22:22</span> The Mighty One, God, Jehovah, the
Mighty One, God, Jehovah, he knoweth; and Israel he shall know: if it be
in rebellion, or if in trespass against Jehovah (save thou us not this
day,)

<span id="an_22:23">22:23</span> that we have built us an altar to turn
away from following Jehovah; or if to offer thereon burnt-offering or
meal-offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace-offerings thereon, let
Jehovah himself require it;

<span id="an_22:24">22:24</span> and if we have not \[rather\] out of
carefulness done this, \[and\] of purpose, saying, In time to come your
children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with
Jehovah, the God of Israel?

<span id="an_22:25">22:25</span> for Jehovah hath made the Jordan a
border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye
have no portion in Jehovah: so might your children make our children
cease from fearing Jehovah.

<span id="an_22:26">22:26</span> Therefore we said, Let us now prepare
to build us an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice:

<span id="an_22:27">22:27</span> but it shall be a witness between us
and you, and between our generations after us, that we may do the
service of Jehovah before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our
sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not say
to our children in time to come, Ye have no portion in Jehovah.

<span id="an_22:28">22:28</span> Therefore said we, It shall be, when
they so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall
say, Behold the pattern of the altar of Jehovah, which our fathers made,
not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between
us and you.

<span id="an_22:29">22:29</span> Far be it from us that we should rebel
against Jehovah, and turn away this day from following Jehovah, to build
an altar for burnt-offering, for meal-offering, or for sacrifice,
besides the altar of Jehovah our God that is before his tabernacle.

<span id="an_22:30">22:30</span> And when Phinehas the priest, and the
princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel
that were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the
children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them
well.

<span id="an_22:31">22:31</span> And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the
priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and
to the children of Manasseh, This day we know that Jehovah is in the
midst of us, because ye have not committed this trespass against
Jehovah: now have ye delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of
Jehovah.

<span id="an_22:32">22:32</span> And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the
priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from
the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan,
to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.

<span id="an_22:33">22:33</span> And the thing pleased the children of
Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spake no more of
going up against them to war, to destroy the land wherein the children
of Reuben and the children of Gad dwelt.

<span id="an_22:34">22:34</span> And the children of Reuben and the
children of Gad called the altar \[Ed\]: For, \[said they\], it is a
witness between us that Jehovah is God.

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> And it came to pass after many days, when
Jehovah had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about,
and Joshua was old and well stricken in years;

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> that Joshua called for all Israel, for
their elders and for their heads, and for their judges and for their
officers, and said unto them, I am old and well stricken in years:

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> and ye have seen all that Jehovah your
God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for Jehovah your
God, he it is that hath fought for you.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> Behold, I have allotted unto you these
nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the
Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great
sea toward the going down of the sun.

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> And Jehovah your God, he will thrust them
out from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall
possess their land, as Jehovah your God spake unto you.

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> Therefore be ye very courageous to keep
and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye
turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> that ye come not among these nations,
these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their
gods, nor cause to swear \[by them\], neither serve them, nor bow down
yourselves unto them;

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> but cleave unto Jehovah your God, as ye
have done unto this day.

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> For Jehovah hath driven out from before
you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath stood before
you unto this day.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> One man of you shall chase a thousand;
for Jehovah your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he spake unto
you.

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> Take good heed therefore unto
yourselves, that ye love Jehovah your God.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> Else if ye do at all go back, and
cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among
you, and make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you;

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> know for a certainty that Jehovah your
God will no more drive these nations from out of your sight; but they
shall be a snare and a trap unto you, and a scourge in your sides, and
thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which
Jehovah your God hath given you.

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> And, behold, this day I am going the
way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your
souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which
Jehovah your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you,
not one thing hath failed thereof.

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> And it shall come to pass, that as all
the good things are come upon you of which Jehovah your God spake unto
you, so will Jehovah bring upon you all the evil things, until he have
destroyed you from off this good land which Jehovah your God hath given
you.

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> When ye transgress the covenant of
Jehovah your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods,
and bow down yourselves to them; then will the anger of Jehovah be
kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land
which he hath given unto you.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> And Joshua gathered all the tribes of
Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their
heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented
themselves before God.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus
saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt of old time beyond
the River, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor:
and they served other gods.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> And I took your father Abraham from
beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and
multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and
I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it: and Jacob and his children
went down into Egypt.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued
Egypt, according to that which I did in the midst thereof: and afterward
I brought you out.

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> And I brought your fathers out of Egypt:
and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers
with chariots and with horsemen unto the Red Sea.

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> And when they cried out unto Jehovah, he
put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon
them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt: and ye
dwelt in the wilderness many days.

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> And I brought you into the land of the
Amorites, that dwelt beyond the Jordan: and they fought with you; and I
gave them into your hand, and ye possessed their land; and I destroyed
them from before you.

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of
Moab, arose and fought against Israel: and he sent and called Balaam the
son of Beor to curse you;

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> but I would not hearken unto Balaam;
therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.

<span id="an_24:11">24:11</span> And ye went over the Jordan, and came
unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite,
and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the
Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your
hand.

<span id="an_24:12">24:12</span> And I sent the hornet before you, which
drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not
with thy sword, nor with thy bow.

<span id="an_24:13">24:13</span> And I gave you a land whereon thou
hadst not labored, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell therein;
of vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.

<span id="an_24:14">24:14</span> Now therefore fear Jehovah, and serve
him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers
served beyond the River, and in Egypt; and serve ye Jehovah.

<span id="an_24:15">24:15</span> And if it seem evil unto you to serve
Jehovah, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which
your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the
Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will
serve Jehovah.

<span id="an_24:16">24:16</span> And the people answered and said, Far
be it from us that we should forsake Jehovah, to serve other gods;

<span id="an_24:17">24:17</span> for Jehovah our God, he it is that
brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house
of bondage, and that did those great signs in our sight, and preserved
us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the peoples through the
midst of whom we passed;

<span id="an_24:18">24:18</span> and Jehovah drove out from before us
all the peoples, even the Amorites that dwelt in the land: therefore we
also will serve Jehovah; for he is our God.

<span id="an_24:19">24:19</span> And Joshua said unto the people, Ye
cannot serve Jehovah; for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will
not forgive your transgression nor your sins.

<span id="an_24:20">24:20</span> If ye forsake Jehovah, and serve
foreign gods, then he will turn and do you evil, and consume you, after
that he hath done you good.

<span id="an_24:21">24:21</span> And the people said unto Joshua, Nay;
but we will serve Jehovah.

<span id="an_24:22">24:22</span> And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are
witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you Jehovah, to serve
him. And they said, We are witnesses.

<span id="an_24:23">24:23</span> Now therefore put away, \[said he\],
the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto
Jehovah, the God of Israel.

<span id="an_24:24">24:24</span> And the people said unto Joshua,
Jehovah our God will we serve, and unto his voice will we hearken.

<span id="an_24:25">24:25</span> So Joshua made a covenant with the
people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.

<span id="an_24:26">24:26</span> And Joshua wrote these words in the
book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there
under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Jehovah.

<span id="an_24:27">24:27</span> And Joshua said unto all the people,
Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it hath heard all
the words of Jehovah which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a
witness against you, lest ye deny your God.

<span id="an_24:28">24:28</span> So Joshua sent the people away, every
man unto his inheritance.

<span id="an_24:29">24:29</span> And it came to pass after these things,
that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being a
hundred and ten years old.

<span id="an_24:30">24:30</span> And they buried him in the border of
his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in the hill-country of
Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.

<span id="an_24:31">24:31</span> And Israel served Jehovah all the days
of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and had
known all the work of Jehovah, that he had wrought for Israel.
