### American Standard Version: 3 John

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I
love in truth.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Beloved, I pray that in all things thou
mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came
and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> Greater joy have I none than this, to hear
of my children walking in the truth.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in
whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers
withal;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> who bare witness to thy love before the
church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily
of God:

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> because that for the sake of the Name they
went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> We therefore ought to welcome such, that we
may be fellow-workers for the truth.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> I wrote somewhat unto the church: but
Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us
not.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Therefore, if I come, I will bring to
remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked
words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the
brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth and casteth \[them\] out of
the church.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Beloved, imitate not that which is evil,
but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: he that doeth evil
hath not seen God.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Demetrius hath the witness of all
\[men\], and of the truth itself: yea, we also bear witness: and thou
knowest that our witness is true.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> I had many things to write unto thee, but
I am unwilling to write \[them\] to thee with ink and pen:

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> but I hope shortly to see thee, and we
shall speak face to face.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Peace \[be\] unto thee. The friends
salute thee. Salute the friends by name.
