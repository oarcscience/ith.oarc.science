### American Standard Version: Matthew

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The book of the generation of Jesus Christ,
the son of David, the son of Abraham.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob;
and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren;

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> and Judah begat Perez and Zerah of Tamar;
and Perez begat Hezron; and Hezron begat Ram;

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> and Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab
begat Nahshon; and Nahshon begat Salmon;

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab; and Boaz
begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> and Jesse begat David the king. And David
begat Solomon of her \[that had been the wife\] of Uriah;

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> and Solomon begat Rehoboam; and Rehoboam
begat Abijah; and Abijah begat Asa;

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> and Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat
begat Joram; and Joram begat Uzziah;

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> and Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat
Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah;

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> and Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh
begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah;

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> and Josiah begat Jechoniah and his
brethren, at the time of the carrying away to Babylon.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> And after the carrying away to Babylon,
Jechoniah begat Shealtiel; and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel;

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> and Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud
begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> and Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat
Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar
begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of
Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> So all the generations from Abraham unto
David are fourteen generations; and from David unto the carrying away to
Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon unto
the Christ fourteen generations.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this
wise: When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they
came together she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> And Joseph her husband, being a righteous
man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her
away privily.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> But when he thought on these things,
behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying,
Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for
that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> And she shall bring forth a son; and thou
shalt call his name JESUS; for it is he that shall save his people from
their sins.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> Now all this is come to pass, that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet,
saying,

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> Behold, the virgin shall be with child,
and shall bring forth a son, And they shall call his name Immanuel;
which is, being interpreted, God with us.

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did
as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto him his wife;

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> and knew her not till she had brought
forth a son: and he called his name JESUS.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of
Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, Wise-men from the east
came to Jerusalem, saying,

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> Where is he that is born King of the Jews?
for we saw his star in the east, and are come to worship him.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And when Herod the king heard it, he was
troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And gathering together all the chief
priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ
should be born.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of
Judaea: for thus it is written through the prophet,

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah, Art in
no wise least among the princes of Judah: For out of thee shall come
forth a governor, Who shall be shepherd of my people Israel.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> Then Herod privily called the Wise-men, and
learned of them exactly what time the star appeared.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go
and search out exactly concerning the young child; and when ye have
found \[him,\] bring me word, that I also may come and worship him.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> And they, having heard the king, went their
way; and lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them,
till it came and stood over where the young child was.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> And when they saw the star, they rejoiced
with exceeding great joy.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> And they came into the house and saw the
young child with Mary his mother; and they fell down and worshipped him;
and opening their treasures they offered unto him gifts, gold and
frankincense and myrrh.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> And being warned \[of God\] in a dream
that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own
country another way.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> Now when they were departed, behold, an
angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take
the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there
until I tell thee: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> And he arose and took the young child and
his mother by night, and departed into Egypt;

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> and was there until the death of Herod:
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the
prophet, saying, Out of Egypt did I call my son.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> Then Herod, when he saw that he was
mocked of the Wise-men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew
all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders
thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he
had exactly learned of the Wise-men.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken
through Jeremiah the prophet, saying,

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> A voice was heard in Ramah, Weeping and
great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; And she would not be
comforted, because they are not.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel
of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> Arise and take the young child and his
mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead that sought
the young child's life.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> And he arose and took the young child and
his mother, and came into the land of Israel.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> But when he heard that Archelaus was
reigning over Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to
go thither; and being warned \[of God\] in a dream, he withdrew into the
parts of Galilee,

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> and came and dwelt in a city called
Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the
prophets, that he should be called a Nazarene.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> And in those days cometh John the Baptist,
preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, saying,

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at
hand.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> For this is he that was spoken of through
Isaiah the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Now John himself had his raiment of camel's
hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts
and wild honey.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Then went out unto him Jerusalem, and all
Judaea, and all the region round about the Jordan;

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> and they were baptized of him in the river
Jordan, confessing their sins.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> But when he saw many of the Pharisees and
Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said unto them, Ye offspring of
vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of
repentance:

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> and think not to say within yourselves, We
have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of
these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> And even now the axe lieth at the root of
the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is
hewn down, and cast into the fire.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> I indeed baptize you in water unto
repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes
I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and
\[in\] fire:

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> whose fan is in his hand, and he will
thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor; and he will gather his wheat
into the garner, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the
Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> But John would have hindered him, saying,
I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> But Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer
\[it\] now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he
suffereth him.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> And Jesus when he was baptized, went up
straightway from the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him,
and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him;

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> and lo, a voice out of the heavens,
saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into
the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> And when he had fasted forty days and forty
nights, he afterward hungered.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> And the tempter came and said unto him, If
thou art the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> But he answered and said, It is written,
Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out
of the mouth of God.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Then the devil taketh him into the holy
city; and he set him on the pinnacle of the temple,

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> and saith unto him, If thou art the Son of
God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels
charge concerning thee: and, On their hands they shall bear thee up,
Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> Jesus said unto him, Again it is written,
Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Again, the devil taketh him unto an
exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world,
and the glory of them;

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> and he said unto him, All these things will
I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee
hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,
and him only shalt thou serve.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> Then the devil leaveth him; and behold,
angels came and ministered unto him.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> Now when he heard that John was delivered
up, he withdrew into Galilee;

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt
in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and
Naphtali:

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> The land of Zebulun and the land of
Naphtali, Toward the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> The people that sat in darkness Saw a
great light, And to them that sat in the region and shadow of death, To
them did light spring up.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> From that time began Jesus to preach, and
to say, Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw
two brethren, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting
a net into the sea; for they were fishers.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> And he saith unto them, Come ye after me,
and I will make you fishers of men.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> And they straightway left the nets, and
followed him.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> And going on from thence he saw two other
brethren, James the \[son\] of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the
boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> And they straightway left the boat and
their father, and followed him.

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> And Jesus went about in all Galilee,
teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom,
and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness among the
people.

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> And the report of him went forth into all
Syria: and they brought unto him all that were sick, holden with divers
diseases and torments, possessed with demons, and epileptic, and
palsied; and he healed them.

<span id="an_4:25">4:25</span> And there followed him great multitudes
from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and \[from\] beyond
the Jordan.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> And seeing the multitudes, he went up into
the mountain: and when he had sat down, his disciples came unto him:

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> and he opened his mouth and taught them,
saying,

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs
is the kingdom of heaven.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall
be comforted.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> Blessed are the meek: for they shall
inherit the earth.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Blessed are they that hunger and thirst
after righteousness: for they shall be filled.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> Blessed are the merciful: for they shall
obtain mercy.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> Blessed are the pure in heart: for they
shall see God.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall
be called sons of God.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> Blessed are they that have been
persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> Blessed are ye when \[men\] shall
reproach you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you
falsely, for my sake.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great
is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets that were
before you.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the
salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted? it is
thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot
of men.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> Ye are the light of the world. A city set
on a hill cannot be hid.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> Neither do \[men\] light a lamp, and put
it under the bushel, but on the stand; and it shineth unto all that are
in the house.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> Even so let your light shine before men;
that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in
heaven.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> Think not that I came to destroy the law
or the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfil.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> For verily I say unto you, Till heaven
and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away
from the law, till all things be accomplished.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> Whosoever therefore shall break one of
these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least
in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, he
shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> For I say unto you, that except your
righteousness shall exceed \[the righteousness\] of the scribes and
Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> Ye have heard that it was said to them of
old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in
danger of the judgment:

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> but I say unto you, that every one who is
angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever
shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and
whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of the hell of fire.

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> If therefore thou art offering thy gift
at the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against
thee,

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> leave there thy gift before the altar,
and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and
offer thy gift.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> Agree with thine adversary quickly, while
thou art with him in the way; lest haply the adversary deliver thee to
the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast
into prison.

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt by no
means come out thence, till thou have paid the last farthing.

<span id="an_5:27">5:27</span> Ye have heard that it was said, Thou
shalt not commit adultery:

<span id="an_5:28">5:28</span> but I say unto you, that every one that
looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her
already in his heart.

<span id="an_5:29">5:29</span> And if thy right eye causeth thee to
stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for
thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body be
cast into hell.

<span id="an_5:30">5:30</span> And if thy right hand causeth thee to
stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for
thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body go
into hell.

<span id="an_5:31">5:31</span> It was said also, Whosoever shall put
away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:

<span id="an_5:32">5:32</span> but I say unto you, that every one that
putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her
an adulteress: and whosoever shall marry her when she is put away
committeth adultery.

<span id="an_5:33">5:33</span> Again, ye have heard that it was said to
them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform
unto the Lord thine oaths:

<span id="an_5:34">5:34</span> but I say unto you, swear not at all;
neither by the heaven, for it is the throne of God;

<span id="an_5:35">5:35</span> nor by the earth, for it is the footstool
of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.

<span id="an_5:36">5:36</span> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for
thou canst not make one hair white or black.

<span id="an_5:37">5:37</span> But let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay,
nay: and whatsoever is more than these is of the evil \[one\].

<span id="an_5:38">5:38</span> Ye have heard that it was said, An eye
for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:

<span id="an_5:39">5:39</span> but I say unto you, resist not him that
is evil: but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the
other also.

<span id="an_5:40">5:40</span> And if any man would go to law with thee,
and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.

<span id="an_5:41">5:41</span> And whosoever shall compel thee to go one
mile, go with him two.

<span id="an_5:42">5:42</span> Give to him that asketh thee, and from
him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.

<span id="an_5:43">5:43</span> Ye have heard that it was said, Thou
shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy:

<span id="an_5:44">5:44</span> but I say unto you, love your enemies,
and pray for them that persecute you;

<span id="an_5:45">5:45</span> that ye may be sons of your Father who is
in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and
sendeth rain on the just and the unjust.

<span id="an_5:46">5:46</span> For if ye love them that love you, what
reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?

<span id="an_5:47">5:47</span> And if ye salute your brethren only, what
do ye more \[than others?\] do not even the Gentiles the same?

<span id="an_5:48">5:48</span> Ye therefore shall be perfect, as your
heavenly Father is perfect.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Take heed that ye do not your righteousness
before men, to be seen of them: else ye have no reward with your Father
who is in heaven.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> When therefore thou doest alms, sound not a
trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the
streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They
have received their reward.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> But when thou doest alms, let not thy left
hand know what thy right hand doeth:

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> that thine alms may be in secret: and thy
Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> And when ye pray, ye shall not be as the
hypocrites: for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the
corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto
you, They have received their reward.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into
thine inner chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is
in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> And in praying use not vain repetitions, as
the Gentiles do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much
speaking.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> Be not therefore like unto them: for your
Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> After this manner therefore pray ye. Our
Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in
heaven, so on earth.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> Give us this day our daily bread.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> And forgive us our debts, as we also have
forgiven our debtors.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> And bring us not into temptation, but
deliver us from the evil \[one.\]

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> For if ye forgive men their trespasses,
your heavenly Father will also forgive you.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> But if ye forgive not men their
trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the
hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that
they may be seen of men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have
received their reward.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy
head, and wash thy face;

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> that thou be not seen of men to fast, but
of thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father, who seeth in secret,
shall recompense thee.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon
the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through
and steal:

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> but lay up for yourselves treasures in
heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth consume, and where thieves do
not break through nor steal:

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> for where thy treasure is, there will thy
heart be also.

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> The lamp of the body is the eye: if
therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body
shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be
darkness, how great is the darkness!

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> No man can serve two masters; for either
he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one,
and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> Therefore I say unto you, be not anxious
for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for
your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than the food, and
the body than the raiment?

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> Behold the birds of the heaven, that they
sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly
Father feedeth them. Are not ye of much more value then they?

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> And which of you by being anxious can add
one cubit unto the measure of his life?

<span id="an_6:28">6:28</span> And why are ye anxious concerning
raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not,
neither do they spin:

<span id="an_6:29">6:29</span> yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in
all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

<span id="an_6:30">6:30</span> But if God doth so clothe the grass of
the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, \[shall
he\] not much more \[clothe\] you, O ye of little faith?

<span id="an_6:31">6:31</span> Be not therefore anxious, saying, What
shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be
clothed?

<span id="an_6:32">6:32</span> For after all these things do the
Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all
these things.

<span id="an_6:33">6:33</span> But seek ye first his kingdom, and his
righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.

<span id="an_6:34">6:34</span> Be not therefore anxious for the morrow:
for the morrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient unto the day is
the evil thereof.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> Judge not, that ye be not judged.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall
be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> And why beholdest thou the mote that is in
thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own
eye?

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me
cast out the mote out of thine eye; and lo, the beam is in thine own
eye?

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out
of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote
out of thy brother's eye.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> Give not that which is holy unto the dogs,
neither cast your pearls before the swine, lest haply they trample them
under their feet, and turn and rend you.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and
ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> for every one that asketh receiveth; and he
that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> Or what man is there of you, who, if his
son shall ask him for a loaf, will give him a stone;

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> or if he shall ask for a fish, will give
him a serpent?

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> If ye then, being evil, know how to give
good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father who is in
heaven give good things to them that ask him?

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> All things therefore whatsoever ye would
that men should do unto you, even so do ye also unto them: for this is
the law and the prophets.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> Enter ye in by the narrow gate: for wide
is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many
are they that enter in thereby.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> For narrow is the gate, and straitened
the way, that leadeth unto life, and few are they that find it.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> Beware of false prophets, who come to you
in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> By their fruits ye shall know them. Do
\[men\] gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> Even so every good tree bringeth forth
good fruit; but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> A good tree cannot bring forth evil
fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> Every tree that bringeth not forth good
fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> Therefore by their fruits ye shall know
them.

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> Not every one that saith unto me, Lord,
Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will
of my Father who is in heaven.

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> Many will say to me in that day, Lord,
Lord, did we not prophesy by thy name, and by thy name cast out demons,
and by thy name do many mighty works?

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> And then will I profess unto them, I
never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> Every one therefore that heareth these
words of mine, and doeth them, shall be likened unto a wise man, who
built his house upon the rock:

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> and the rain descended, and the floods
came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and if fell not: for
it was founded upon the rock.

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> And every one that heareth these words of
mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built
his house upon the sand:

<span id="an_7:27">7:27</span> and the rain descended, and the floods
came, and the winds blew, and smote upon that house; and it fell: and
great was the fall thereof.

<span id="an_7:28">7:28</span> And it came to pass, when Jesus had
finished these words, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching:

<span id="an_7:29">7:29</span> for he taught them as \[one\] having
authority, and not as their scribes.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> And when he was come down from the
mountain, great multitudes followed him.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> And behold, there came to him a leper and
worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> And he stretched forth his hand, and
touched him, saying, I will; be thou made clean. And straightway his
leprosy was cleansed.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no
man; but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses
commanded, for a testimony unto them.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> And when he was entered into Capernaum,
there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> and saying, Lord, my servant lieth in the
house sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> And he saith unto him, I will come and heal
him.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> And the centurion answered and said, Lord,
I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof; but only say the
word, and my servant shall be healed.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> For I also am a man under authority, having
under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to
another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth
it.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> And when Jesus heard it, he marvelled,
and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found
so great faith, no, not in Israel.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> And I say unto you, that many shall come
from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac,
and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven:

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast
forth into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the
gnashing of teeth.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy
way; as thou hast believed, \[so\] be it done unto thee. And the servant
was healed in that hour.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> And when Jesus was come into Peter's
house, he saw his wife's mother lying sick of a fever.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> And he touched her hand, and the fever
left her; and she arose, and ministered unto him.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> And when even was come, they brought unto
him many possessed with demons: and he cast out the spirits with a word,
and healed all that were sick:

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: Himself took our infirmities,
and bare our diseases.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about
him, he gave commandments to depart unto the other side.

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> And there came a scribe, and said unto
him, Teacher, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have
holes, and the birds of the heaven \[have\] nests; but the Son of man
hath not where to lay his head.

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> And another of the disciples said unto
him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> But Jesus saith unto him, Follow me; and
leave the dead to bury their own dead.

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> And when he was entered into a boat, his
disciples followed him.

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> And behold, there arose a great tempest
in the sea, insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves: but he
was asleep.

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> And they came to him, and awoke him,
saying, Save, Lord; we perish.

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> And he saith unto them, Why are ye
fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and
the sea; and there was a great calm.

<span id="an_8:27">8:27</span> And the men marvelled, saying, What
manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> And when he was come to the other side
into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two possessed with
demons, coming forth out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man
could pass by that way.

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> And behold, they cried out, saying, What
have we to do with thee, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to
torment us before the time?

<span id="an_8:30">8:30</span> Now there was afar off from them a herd
of many swine feeding.

<span id="an_8:31">8:31</span> And the demons besought him, saying, If
thou cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine.

<span id="an_8:32">8:32</span> And he said unto them, Go. And they came
out, and went into the swine: and behold, the whole herd rushed down the
steep into the sea, and perished in the waters.

<span id="an_8:33">8:33</span> And they that fed them fled, and went
away into the city, and told everything, and what was befallen to them
that were possessed with demons.

<span id="an_8:34">8:34</span> And behold, all the city came out to meet
Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought \[him\] that he would depart
from their borders.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> And he entered into a boat, and crossed
over, and came into his own city.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> And behold, they brought to him a man sick
of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the
sick of the palsy, Son, be of good cheer; thy sins are forgiven.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> And behold, certain of the scribes said
within themselves, This man blasphemeth.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> And Jesus knowing their thoughts said,
Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> For which is easier, to say, Thy sins are
forgiven; or to say, Arise, and walk?

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> But that ye may know that the Son of man
hath authority on earth to forgive sins (then saith he to the sick of
the palsy), Arise, and take up thy bed, and go up unto thy house.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> And he arose, and departed to his house.

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> But when the multitudes saw it, they were
afraid, and glorified God, who had given such authority unto men.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> And as Jesus passed by from thence, he saw
a man, called Matthew, sitting at the place of toll: and he saith unto
him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> And it came to pass, as he sat at meat in
the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with
Jesus and his disciples.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> And when the Pharisees saw it, they said
unto his disciples, Why eateth your Teacher with the publicans and
sinners?

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> But when he heard it, he said, They that
are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> But go ye and learn what \[this\]
meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, for I came not to call the
righteous, but sinners.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> Then come to him the disciples of John,
saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast
not?

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> And Jesus said unto them, Can the sons of
the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the
days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and
then will they fast.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> And no man putteth a piece of undressed
cloth upon an old garment; for that which should fill it up taketh from
the garment, and a worse rent is made.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> Neither do \[men\] put new wine into old
wine-skins: else the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins
perish: but they put new wine into fresh wine-skins, and both are
preserved.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> While he spake these things unto them,
behold, there came a ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is
even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> And Jesus arose, and followed him, and
\[so did\] his disciples.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> And behold, a woman, who had an issue of
blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the border of his
garment:

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> for she said within herself, If I do but
touch his garment, I shall be made whole.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> But Jesus turning and seeing her said,
Daughter, be of good cheer; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the
woman was made whole from that hour.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> And when Jesus came into the ruler's
house, and saw the flute-players, and the crowd making a tumult,

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> he said, Give place: for the damsel is
not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> But when the crowd was put forth, he
entered in, and took her by the hand; and the damsel arose.

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> And the fame hereof went forth into all
that land.

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> And as Jesus passed by from thence, two
blind men followed him, crying out, and saying, Have mercy on us, thou
son of David.

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> And when he was come into the house, the
blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am
able to do this? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> Then touched he their eyes, saying,
According to your faith be it done unto you.

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> And their eyes were opened. And Jesus
strictly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> But they went forth, and spread abroad
his fame in all that land.

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> And as they went forth, behold, there was
brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon.

<span id="an_9:33">9:33</span> And when the demon was cast out, the dumb
man spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in
Israel.

<span id="an_9:34">9:34</span> But the Pharisees said, By the prince of
the demons casteth he out demons.

<span id="an_9:35">9:35</span> And Jesus went about all the cities and
the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of
the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of
sickness.

<span id="an_9:36">9:36</span> But when he saw the multitudes, he was
moved with compassion for them, because they were distressed and
scattered, as sheep not having a shepherd.

<span id="an_9:37">9:37</span> Then saith he unto his disciples, The
harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few.

<span id="an_9:38">9:38</span> Pray ye therefore the Lord of the
harvest, that he send forth laborers into his harvest.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> And he called unto him his twelve
disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them
out, and to heal all manner of disease and all manner of sickness.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> Now the names of the twelve apostles are
these: The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother;
James the \[son\] of Zebedee, and John his brother;

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and
Matthew the publican; James the \[son\] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot,
who also betrayed him.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> These twelve Jesus sent forth, and
charged them, saying, Go not into \[any\] way of the Gentiles, and enter
not into any city of the Samaritans:

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> but go rather to the lost sheep of the
house of Israel.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom
of heaven is at hand.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse
the lepers, cast out demons: freely ye received, freely give.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> Get you no gold, nor silver, nor brass in
your purses;

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> no wallet for \[your\] journey, neither
two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> And into whatsoever city or village ye
shall enter, search out who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go
forth.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> And as ye enter into the house, salute
it.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> And if the house be worthy, let your
peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to
you.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> And whosoever shall not receive you,
nor hear your words, as ye go forth out of that house or that city,
shake off the dust of your feet.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> Verily I say unto you, It shall be more
tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment,
than for that city.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> Behold, I send you forth as sheep in
the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as
doves.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> But beware of men: for they will
deliver you up to councils, and in theirs synagogues they will scourge
you;

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> yea and before governors and kings
shall ye be brought for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the
Gentiles.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> But when they deliver you up, be not
anxious how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that
hour what ye shall speak.

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> For it is not ye that speak, but the
Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> And brother shall deliver up brother to
death, and the father his child: and children shall rise up against
parents, and cause them to be put to death.

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> And ye shall be hated of all men for my
name's sake: but he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> But when they persecute you in this
city, flee into the next: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have
gone through the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> A disciple is not above his teacher,
nor a servant above his lord.

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> It is enough for the disciple that he
be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the
master of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of his household!

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> Fear them not therefore: for there is
nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be
known.

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> What I tell you in the darkness, speak
ye in the light; and what ye hear in the ear, proclaim upon the
house-tops.

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> And be not afraid of them that kill the
body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him who is able
to destroy both soul and body in hell.

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?
and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father:

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> but the very hairs of your head are all
numbered.

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> Fear not therefore: ye are of more
value than many sparrows.

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> Every one therefore who shall confess
me before men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in
heaven.

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> But whosoever shall deny me before men,
him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven.

<span id="an_10:34">10:34</span> Think not that I came to send peace on
the earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.

<span id="an_10:35">10:35</span> For I came to set a man at variance
against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the
daughter in law against her mother in law:

<span id="an_10:36">10:36</span> and a man's foes \[shall be\] they of
his own household.

<span id="an_10:37">10:37</span> He that loveth father or mother more
than me is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more
than me is not worthy of me.

<span id="an_10:38">10:38</span> And he that doth not take his cross and
follow after me, is not worthy of me.

<span id="an_10:39">10:39</span> He that findeth his life shall lose it;
and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.

<span id="an_10:40">10:40</span> He that receiveth you receiveth me, and
he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.

<span id="an_10:41">10:41</span> He that receiveth a prophet in the name
of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward: and he that receiveth a
righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous
man's reward.

<span id="an_10:42">10:42</span> And whosoever shall give to drink unto
one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a
disciple, verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> And it came to pass when Jesus had
finished commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach
and preach in their cities.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> Now when John heard in the prison the
works of the Christ, he sent by his disciples

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> and said unto him, Art thou he that
cometh, or look we for another?

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> And Jesus answered and said unto them, Go
and tell John the things which ye hear and see:

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> the blind receive their sight, and the
lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are
raised up, and the poor have good tidings preached to them.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> And blessed is he, whosoever shall find
no occasion of stumbling in me.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> And as these went their way, Jesus began
to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the
wilderness to behold? a reed shaken with the wind?

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> But what went ye out to see? a man
clothed in soft \[raiment\]? Behold, they that wear soft \[raiment\] are
in king's houses.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> But wherefore went ye out? to see a
prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> This is he, of whom it is written,
Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way
before thee.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> Verily I say unto you, Among them that
are born of women there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist:
yet he that is but little in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> And from the days of John the Baptist
until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and men of violence
take it by force.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> For all the prophets and the law
prophesied until John.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> And if ye are willing to receive
\[it,\] this is Elijah, that is to come.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> He that hath ears to hear, let him
hear.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> But whereunto shall I liken this
generation? It is like unto children sitting in the marketplaces, who
call unto their fellows

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> and say, We piped unto you, and ye did
not dance; we wailed, and ye did not mourn.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> For John came neither eating nor
drinking, and they say, He hath a demon.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> The Son of man came eating and
drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a
friend of publicans and sinners! And wisdom is justified by her works.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> Then began he to upbraid the cities
wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee,
Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which
were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and
ashes.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> But I say unto you, it shall be more
tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be
exalted unto heaven? thou shalt go down unto Hades: for if the mighty
works had been done in Sodom which were done in thee, it would have
remained until this day.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> But I say unto you that it shall be
more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for
thee.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> At that season Jesus answered and said,
I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide
these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto
babes:

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> yea, Father, for so it was
well-pleasing in thy sight.

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> All things have been delivered unto me
of my Father: and no one knoweth the Son, save the Father; neither doth
any know the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth
to reveal \[him.\]

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> Come unto me, all ye that labor and are
heavy laden, and I will give you rest.

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me;
for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your
souls.

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> For my yoke is easy, and my burden is
light.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> At that season Jesus went on the sabbath
day through the grainfields; and his disciples were hungry and began to
pluck ears and to eat.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said
unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do
upon the sabbath.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> But he said unto them, Have ye not read
what David did, when he was hungry, and they that were with him;

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> how he entered into the house of God, and
ate the showbread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, neither for
them that were with him, but only for the priests?

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> Or have ye not read in the law, that on
the sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are
guiltless?

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> But I say unto you, that one greater than
the temple is here.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> But if ye had known what this meaneth, I
desire mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the
guiltless.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> For the Son of man is lord of the
sabbath.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> And he departed thence, and went into
their synagogue:

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> and behold, a man having a withered
hand. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath
day? that they might accuse him.

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> And he said unto them, What man shall
there be of you, that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit
on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> How much then is a man of more value
than a sheep! Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day.

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth
thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, as the
other.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> But the Pharisees went out, and took
counsel against him, how they might destroy him.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> And Jesus perceiving \[it\] withdrew
from thence: and many followed him; and he healed them all,

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> and charged them that they should not
make him known:

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> Behold, my servant whom I have chosen;
My beloved in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my Spirit upon
him, And he shall declare judgment to the Gentiles.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> He shall not strive, nor cry aloud;
Neither shall any one hear his voice in the streets.

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> A bruised reed shall he not break, And
smoking flax shall he not quench, Till he send forth judgment unto
victory.

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> And in his name shall the Gentiles
hope.

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> Then was brought unto him one possessed
with a demon, blind and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the dumb
man spake and saw.

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> And all the multitudes were amazed, and
said, Can this be the son of David?

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> But when the Pharisees heard it, they
said, This man doth not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub the prince of
the demons.

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> And knowing their thoughts he said unto
them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and
every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> and if Satan casteth out Satan, he is
divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons,
by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> But if I by the Spirit of God cast out
demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you.

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> Or how can one enter into the house of
the strong \[man,\] and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong
\[man\]? and then he will spoil his house.

<span id="an_12:30">12:30</span> He that is not with me is against me,
and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.

<span id="an_12:31">12:31</span> Therefore I say unto you, Every sin and
blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy against the
Spirit shall not be forgiven.

<span id="an_12:32">12:32</span> And whosoever shall speak a word
against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall
speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in
this world, nor in that which is to come.

<span id="an_12:33">12:33</span> Either make the tree good, and its
fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the
tree is known by its fruit.

<span id="an_12:34">12:34</span> Ye offspring of vipers, how can ye,
being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the
mouth speaketh.

<span id="an_12:35">12:35</span> The good man out of his good treasure
bringeth forth good things: and the evil man out of his evil treasure
bringeth forth evil things.

<span id="an_12:36">12:36</span> And I say unto you, that every idle
word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of
judgment.

<span id="an_12:37">12:37</span> For by thy words thou shalt be
justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.

<span id="an_12:38">12:38</span> Then certain of the scribes and
Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we would see a sign from thee.

<span id="an_12:39">12:39</span> But he answered and said unto them, An
evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no
sign be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet:

<span id="an_12:40">12:40</span> for as Jonah was three days and three
nights in the belly of the whale; so shall the Son of man be three days
and three nights in the heart of the earth.

<span id="an_12:41">12:41</span> The men of Nineveh shall stand up in
the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they
repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is
here.

<span id="an_12:42">12:42</span> The queen of the south shall rise up in
the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came
from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a
greater than Solomon is here.

<span id="an_12:43">12:43</span> But the unclean spirit, when he is gone
out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and
findeth it not.

<span id="an_12:44">12:44</span> Then he saith, I will return into my
house whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty,
swept, and garnished.

<span id="an_12:45">12:45</span> Then goeth he, and taketh with himself
seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell
there: and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first.
Even so shall it be also unto this evil generation.

<span id="an_12:46">12:46</span> While he was yet speaking to the
multitudes, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking
to speak to him.

<span id="an_12:47">12:47</span> And one said unto him, Behold, thy
mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking to speak to thee.

<span id="an_12:48">12:48</span> But he answered and said unto him that
told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?

<span id="an_12:49">12:49</span> And he stretched forth his hand towards
his disciples, and said, Behold, my mother and my brethren!

<span id="an_12:50">12:50</span> For whosoever shall do the will of my
Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> On that day went Jesus out of the house,
and sat by the sea side.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> And there were gathered unto him great
multitudes, so that he entered into a boat, and sat; and all the
multitude stood on the beach.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> And he spake to them many things in
parables, saying, Behold, the sower went forth to sow;

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> and as he sowed, some \[seeds\] fell by
the way side, and the birds came and devoured them:

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> and others fell upon the rocky places,
where they had not much earth: and straightway they sprang up, because
they had no deepness of earth:

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> and when the sun was risen, they were
scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> And others fell upon the thorns; and the
thorns grew up and choked them:

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> and others fell upon the good ground, and
yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> He that hath ears, let him hear.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> And the disciples came, and said unto
him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> And he answered and said unto them,
Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but
to them it is not given.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> For whosoever hath, to him shall be
given, and he shall have abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him
shall be taken away even that which he hath.

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> Therefore speak I to them in parables;
because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they
understand.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> And unto them is fulfilled the prophecy
of Isaiah, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise
understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> For this people's heart is waxed gross,
And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed;
Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their
ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I
should heal them.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> But blessed are your eyes, for they
see; and your ears, for they hear.

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> For verily I say unto you, that many
prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see, and
saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> Hear then ye the parable of the sower.

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> When any one heareth the word of the
kingdom, and understandeth it not, \[then\] cometh the evil \[one\], and
snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart. This is he that
was sown by the way side.

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> And he that was sown upon the rocky
places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy
receiveth it;

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> yet hath he not root in himself, but
endureth for a while; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth
because of the word, straightway he stumbleth.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> And he that was sown among the thorns,
this is he that heareth the word; and the care of the world, and the
deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> And he that was sown upon the good
ground, this is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who
verily beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some
sixty, some thirty.

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> Another parable set he before them,
saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed
in his field:

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> but while men slept, his enemy came and
sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away.

<span id="an_13:26">13:26</span> But when the blade sprang up and
brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.

<span id="an_13:27">13:27</span> And the servants of the householder
came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field?
whence then hath it tares?

<span id="an_13:28">13:28</span> And he said unto them, An enemy hath
done this. And the servants say unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and
gather them up?

<span id="an_13:29">13:29</span> But he saith, Nay; lest haply while ye
gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them.

<span id="an_13:30">13:30</span> Let both grow together until the
harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers,
Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but
gather the wheat into my barn.

<span id="an_13:31">13:31</span> Another parable set he before them,
saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed,
which a man took, and sowed in his field:

<span id="an_13:32">13:32</span> which indeed is less than all seeds;
but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree,
so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof.

<span id="an_13:33">13:33</span> Another parable spake he unto them; The
kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in
three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.

<span id="an_13:34">13:34</span> All these things spake Jesus in
parables unto the multitudes; and without a parable spake he nothing
unto them:

<span id="an_13:35">13:35</span> that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I
will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.

<span id="an_13:36">13:36</span> Then he left the multitudes, and went
into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain unto us
the parable of the tares of the field.

<span id="an_13:37">13:37</span> And he answered and said, He that
soweth the good seed is the Son of man;

<span id="an_13:38">13:38</span> and the field is the world; and the
good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons
of the evil \[one\];

<span id="an_13:39">13:39</span> and the enemy that sowed them is the
devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are
angels.

<span id="an_13:40">13:40</span> As therefore the tares are gathered up
and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world.

<span id="an_13:41">13:41</span> The Son of man shall send forth his
angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause
stumbling, and them that do iniquity,

<span id="an_13:42">13:42</span> and shall cast them into the furnace of
fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.

<span id="an_13:43">13:43</span> Then shall the righteous shine forth as
the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear.

<span id="an_13:44">13:44</span> The kingdom of heaven is like unto a
treasure hidden in the field; which a man found, and hid; and in his joy
he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.

<span id="an_13:45">13:45</span> Again, the kingdom of heaven is like
unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls:

<span id="an_13:46">13:46</span> and having found one pearl of great
price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.

<span id="an_13:47">13:47</span> Again, the kingdom of heaven is like
unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:

<span id="an_13:48">13:48</span> which, when it was filled, they drew up
on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but
the bad they cast away.

<span id="an_13:49">13:49</span> So shall it be in the end of the world:
the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the
righteous,

<span id="an_13:50">13:50</span> and shall cast them into the furnace of
fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.

<span id="an_13:51">13:51</span> Have ye understood all these things?
They say unto him, Yea.

<span id="an_13:52">13:52</span> And he said unto them, Therefore every
scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like
unto a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure
things new and old.

<span id="an_13:53">13:53</span> And it came to pass, when Jesus had
finished these parables, he departed thence.

<span id="an_13:54">13:54</span> And coming into his own country he
taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and
said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?

<span id="an_13:55">13:55</span> Is not this the carpenter's son? is not
his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon,
and Judas?

<span id="an_13:56">13:56</span> And his sisters, are they not all with
us? Whence then hath this man all these things?

<span id="an_13:57">13:57</span> And they were offended in him. But
Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own
country, and in his own house.

<span id="an_13:58">13:58</span> And he did not many mighty works there
because of their unbelief.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> At that season Herod the tetrarch heard
the report concerning Jesus,

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> and said unto his servants, This is John
the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore do these powers
work in him.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> For Herod had laid hold on John, and
bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother
Philip's wife.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> For John said unto him, It is not lawful
for thee to have her.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> And when he would have put him to death,
he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> But when Herod's birthday came, the
daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> Whereupon he promised with an oath to
give her whatsoever she should ask.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> And she, being put forward by her mother,
saith, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> And the king was grieved; but for the
sake of his oaths, and of them that sat at meat with him, he commanded
it to be given;

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> and he sent and beheaded John in the
prison.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> And his head was brought on a platter,
and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> And his disciples came, and took up the
corpse, and buried him; and they went and told Jesus.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> Now when Jesus heard \[it\], he
withdrew from thence in a boat, to a desert place apart: and when the
multitudes heard \[thereof,\] they followed him on foot from the cities.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> And he came forth, and saw a great
multitude, and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> And when even was come, the disciples
came to him, saying, The place is desert, and the time is already past;
send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy
themselves food.

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> But Jesus said unto them, They have no
need to go away; give ye them to eat.

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> And they say unto him, We have here but
five loaves, and two fishes.

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> And he said, Bring them hither to me.

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> And he commanded the multitudes to sit
down on the grass; and he took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and
looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake and gave the loaves to the
disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> And they all ate, and were filled: and
they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, twelve
baskets full.

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> And they that did eat were about five
thousand men, besides women and children.

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> And straightway he constrained the
disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before him unto the other
side, till he should send the multitudes away.

<span id="an_14:23">14:23</span> And after he had sent the multitudes
away, he went up into the mountain apart to pray: and when even was
come, he was there alone.

<span id="an_14:24">14:24</span> But the boat was now in the midst of
the sea, distressed by the waves; for the wind was contrary.

<span id="an_14:25">14:25</span> And in the fourth watch of the night he
came unto them, walking upon the sea.

<span id="an_14:26">14:26</span> And when the disciples saw him walking
on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; and they cried
out for fear.

<span id="an_14:27">14:27</span> But straightway Jesus spake unto them,
saying Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.

<span id="an_14:28">14:28</span> And Peter answered him and said, Lord,
if it be thou, bid me come unto the upon the waters.

<span id="an_14:29">14:29</span> And he said, Come. And Peter went down
from the boat, and walked upon the waters to come to Jesus.

<span id="an_14:30">14:30</span> But when he saw the wind, he was
afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.

<span id="an_14:31">14:31</span> And immediately Jesus stretched forth
his hand, and took hold of him, and saith unto him, O thou of little
faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?

<span id="an_14:32">14:32</span> And when they were gone up into the
boat, the wind ceased.

<span id="an_14:33">14:33</span> And they that were in the boat
worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.

<span id="an_14:34">14:34</span> And when they had crossed over, they
came to the land, unto Gennesaret.

<span id="an_14:35">14:35</span> And when the men of that place knew
him, they sent into all that region round about, and brought unto him
all that were sick,

<span id="an_14:36">14:36</span> and they besought him that they might
only touch the border of his garment: and as many as touched were made
whole.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> Then there come to Jesus from Jerusalem
Pharisees and scribes, saying,

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> Why do thy disciples transgress the
tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat
bread.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> And he answered and said unto them, Why
do ye also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> For God said, Honor thy father and thy
mother: and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the
death.

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> But ye say, whosoever shall say to his
father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by
me is given \[to God\];

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> he shall not honor his father. And ye
have made void the word of God because of your tradition.

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy
of you, saying,

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> This people honoreth me with their lips;
But their heart is far from me.

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> But in vain do they worship me, Teaching
\[as their\] doctrines the precepts of men.

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> And he called to him the multitude, and
said unto them, Hear, and understand:

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> Not that which entereth into the mouth
defileth the man; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth, this
defileth the man.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> Then came the disciples, and said unto
him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this
saying?

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> But he answered and said, Every plant
which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up.

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> Let them alone: they are blind guides.
And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into a pit.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> And Peter answered and said unto him,
Declare unto us the parable.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> And he said, Are ye also even yet
without understanding?

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> Perceive ye not, that whatsoever goeth
into the mouth passeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> But the things which proceed out of the
mouth come forth out of the heart; and they defile the man.

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> For out of the heart come forth evil
thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness,
railings:

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> these are the things which defile the
man; but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man.

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> And Jesus went out thence, and withdrew
into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> And behold, a Canaanitish woman came
out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord,
thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon.

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> But he answered her not a word. And his
disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth
after us.

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> But he answered and said, I was not
sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> But she came and worshipped him,
saying, Lord, help me.

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> And he answered and said, It is not
meet to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> But she said, Yea, Lord: for even the
dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> Then Jesus answered and said unto her,
O woman, great is thy faith: be it done unto thee even as thou wilt. And
her daughter was healed from that hour.

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> And Jesus departed thence, and came
nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat
there.

<span id="an_15:30">15:30</span> And there came unto him great
multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many
others, and they cast them down at this feet; and he healed them:

<span id="an_15:31">15:31</span> insomuch that the multitude wondered,
when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, and lame walking, and
the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel.

<span id="an_15:32">15:32</span> And Jesus called unto him his
disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they
continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat: and I would not
send them away fasting, lest haply they faint on the way.

<span id="an_15:33">15:33</span> And the disciples say unto him, Whence
should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a
multitude?

<span id="an_15:34">15:34</span> And Jesus said unto them, How many
loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.

<span id="an_15:35">15:35</span> And he commanded the multitude to sit
down on the ground;

<span id="an_15:36">15:36</span> and he took the seven loaves and the
fishes; and he gave thanks and brake, and gave to the disciples, and the
disciples to the multitudes.

<span id="an_15:37">15:37</span> And they all ate, and were filled: and
they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven
baskets full.

<span id="an_15:38">15:38</span> And they that did eat were four
thousand men, besides women and children.

<span id="an_15:39">15:39</span> And he sent away the multitudes, and
entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and
trying him asked him to show them a sign from heaven.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> But he answered and said unto them, When
it is evening, ye say, \[It will be\] fair weather: for the heaven is
red.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> And in the morning, \[It will be\] foul
weather to-day: for the heaven is red and lowering. Ye know how to
discern the face of the heaven; but ye cannot \[discern\] the signs of
the times.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> An evil and adulterous generation seeketh
after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of
Jonah. And he left them, and departed.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> And the disciples came to the other side
and forgot to take bread.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> And Jesus said unto them, Take heed and
beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> And they reasoned among themselves,
saying, We took no bread.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> And Jesus perceiving it said, O ye of
little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have no bread?

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> Do ye not yet perceive, neither remember
the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> Neither the seven loaves of the four
thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> How is it that ye do not perceive that
I spake not to you concerning bread? But beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees and Sadducees.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> Then understood they that he bade them
not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees
and Sadducees.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> Now when Jesus came into the parts of
Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that
the Son of man is?

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> And they said, Some \[say\] John the
Baptist; some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> He saith unto them, But who say ye that
I am?

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou
art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> And Jesus answered and said unto him,
Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jonah: for flesh and blood hath not revealed
it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven.

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> And I also say unto thee, that thou art
Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of Hades
shall not prevail against it.

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> I will give unto thee the keys of the
kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be
bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be
loosed in heaven.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> Then charged he the disciples that they
should tell no man that he was the Christ.

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> From that time began Jesus to show unto
his disciples, that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of
the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third
day be raised up.

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> And Peter took him, and began to rebuke
him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall never be unto thee.

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get
thee behind me, Satan: thou art a stumbling-block unto me: for thou
mindest not the things of God, but the things of men.

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If
any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his
cross, and follow me.

<span id="an_16:25">16:25</span> For whosoever would save his life shall
lose it: and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it.

<span id="an_16:26">16:26</span> For what shall a man be profited, if he
shall gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? or what shall a man
give in exchange for his life?

<span id="an_16:27">16:27</span> For the Son of man shall come in the
glory of his Father with his angels; and then shall he render unto every
man according to his deeds.

<span id="an_16:28">16:28</span> Verily I say unto you, there are some
of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they
see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> And after six days Jesus taketh with him
Peter, and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high
mountain apart:

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> and he was transfigured before them; and
his face did shine as the sun, and his garments became white as the
light.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> And behold, there appeared unto them
Moses and Elijah talking with him.

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> And Peter answered, and said unto Jesus,
Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, I will make here three
tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> While he was yet speaking, behold, a
bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold, a voice out of the cloud,
saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> And when the disciples heard it, they
fell on their face, and were sore afraid.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> And Jesus came and touched them and said,
Arise, and be not afraid.

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> And lifting up their eyes, they saw no
one, save Jesus only.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> And as they were coming down from the
mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until
the Son of man be risen from the dead.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> And his disciples asked him, saying,
Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come?

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> And he answered and said, Elijah indeed
cometh, and shall restore all things:

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> but I say into you, that Elijah is come
already, and they knew him not, but did unto him whatsoever they would.
Even so shall the Son of man also suffer of them.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> Then understood the disciples that he
spake unto them of John the Baptist.

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> And when they were come to the
multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling to him, saying,

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is
epileptic, and suffereth grievously; for oft-times he falleth into the
fire, and off-times into the water.

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> And I brought him to thy disciples, and
they could not cure him.

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> And Jesus answered and said, O
faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how
long shall I bear with you? bring him hither to me.

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> And Jesus rebuked him; and the demon
went out of him: and the boy was cured from that hour.

<span id="an_17:19">17:19</span> Then came the disciples to Jesus apart,
and said, Why could not we cast it out?

<span id="an_17:20">17:20</span> And he saith unto them, Because of your
little faith: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of
mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder
place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.

<span id="an_17:21">17:21</span> \[But this kind goeth not out save by
prayer and fasting.\]

<span id="an_17:22">17:22</span> And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus
said unto them, The Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of
men;

<span id="an_17:23">17:23</span> and they shall kill him, and the third
day he shall be raised up. And they were exceeding sorry.

<span id="an_17:24">17:24</span> And when they were come to Capernaum,
they that received the half-shekel came to Peter, and said, Doth not
your teacher pay the half-shekel?

<span id="an_17:25">17:25</span> He saith, Yea. And when he came into
the house, Jesus spake first to him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon?
the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive toll or tribute? from
their sons, or from strangers?

<span id="an_17:26">17:26</span> And when he said, From strangers, Jesus
said unto him, Therefore the sons are free.

<span id="an_17:27">17:27</span> But, lest we cause them to stumble, go
thou to the sea, and cast a hook, and take up the fish that first cometh
up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a shekel: that
take, and give unto them for me and thee.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> In that hour came the disciples unto
Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> And he called to him a little child, and
set him in the midst of them,

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> and said, Verily I say unto you, Except
ye turn, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into
the kingdom of heaven.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> Whosoever therefore shall humble himself
as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> And whoso shall receive one such little
child in my name receiveth me:

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> But whoso shall cause one of these little
ones that believe on me to stumble, it is profitable for him that a
great millstone should be hanged about his neck, and \[that\] he should
be sunk in the depth of the sea.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> Woe unto the world because of occasions
of stumbling! for it must needs be that the occasions come; but woe to
that man through whom the occasion cometh!

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> And if thy hand or thy foot causeth thee
to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: it is good for thee to
enter into life maimed or halt, rather than having two hands or two feet
to be cast into the eternal fire.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> And if thine eye causeth thee to stumble,
pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is good for thee to enter into
life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell
of fire.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> See that ye despise not one of these
little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always
behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> \[For the Son of man came to save that
which was lost.\]

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> How think ye? if any man have a hundred
sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and
nine, and go unto the mountains, and seek that which goeth astray?

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> And if so be that he find it, verily I
say unto you, he rejoiceth over it more than over the ninety and nine
which have not gone astray.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> Even so it is not the will of your
Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> And if thy brother sin against thee,
go, show him his fault between thee and him alone: if he hear thee, thou
hast gained thy brother.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> But if he hear \[thee\] not, take with
thee one or two more, that at the mouth of two witnesses or three every
word may be established.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> And if he refuse to hear them, tell it
unto the church: and if he refuse to hear the church also, let him be
unto thee as the Gentile and the publican.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> Verily I say unto you, what things
soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and what things
soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> Again I say unto you, that if two of
you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it
shall be done for them of my Father who is in heaven.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> For where two or three are gathered
together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> Then came Peter and said to him, Lord,
how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? until seven
times?

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto
thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven.

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> Therefore is the kingdom of heaven
likened unto a certain king, who would make a reckoning with his
servants.

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> And when he had begun to reckon, one
was brought unto him, that owed him ten thousand talents.

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> But forasmuch as he had not
\[wherewith\] to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife,
and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> The servant therefore fell down and
worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee
all.

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> And the lord of that servant, being
moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> But that servant went out, and found
one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred shillings: and he
laid hold on him, and took \[him\] by the throat, saying, Pay what thou
owest.

<span id="an_18:29">18:29</span> So his fellow-servant fell down and
besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee.

<span id="an_18:30">18:30</span> And he would not: but went and cast him
into prison, till he should pay that which was due.

<span id="an_18:31">18:31</span> So when his fellow-servants saw what
was done, they were exceeding sorry, and came and told unto their lord
all that was done.

<span id="an_18:32">18:32</span> Then his lord called him unto him, and
saith to him, Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because
thou besoughtest me:

<span id="an_18:33">18:33</span> shouldest not thou also have had mercy
on thy fellow-servant, even as I had mercy on thee?

<span id="an_18:34">18:34</span> And his lord was wroth, and delivered
him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due.

<span id="an_18:35">18:35</span> So shall also my heavenly Father do
unto you, if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> And it came to pass when Jesus had
finished these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the
borders of Judaea beyond the Jordan;

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> and great multitudes followed him; and he
healed them there.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> And there came unto him Pharisees, trying
him, and saying, Is it lawful \[for a man\] to put away his wife for
every cause?

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> And he answered and said, Have ye not
read, that he who made \[them\] from the beginning made them male and
female,

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> and said, For this cause shall a man
leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two
shall become one flesh?

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> So that they are no more two, but one
flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> They say unto him, Why then did Moses
command to give a bill of divorcement, and to put \[her\] away?

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> He saith unto them, Moses for your
hardness of heart suffered you to put away your wives: but from the
beginning it hath not been so.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put
away his wife, except for fornication, and shall marry another,
committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her when she is put away
committeth adultery.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> The disciples say unto him, If the case
of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> But he said unto them, Not all men can
receive this saying, but they to whom it is given.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> For there are eunuchs, that were so
born from their mother's womb: and there are eunuchs, that were made
eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, that made themselves eunuchs for
the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him
receive it.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> Then were there brought unto him little
children, that he should lay his hands on them, and pray: and the
disciples rebuked them.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> But Jesus said, Suffer the little
children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for to such belongeth
the kingdom of heaven.

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> And he laid his hands on them, and
departed thence.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> And behold, one came to him and said,
Teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> And he said unto him, Why askest thou
me concerning that which is good? One there is who is good: but if thou
wouldest enter into life, keep the commandments.

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> He saith unto him, Which? And Jesus
said, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt
not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> Honor thy father and mother; and, Thou
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.

<span id="an_19:20">19:20</span> The young man saith unto him, All these
things have I observed: what lack I yet?

<span id="an_19:21">19:21</span> Jesus said unto him, If thou wouldest
be perfect, go, sell that which thou hast, and give to the poor, and
thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.

<span id="an_19:22">19:22</span> But when the young man heard the
saying, he went away sorrowful; for he was one that had great
possessions.

<span id="an_19:23">19:23</span> And Jesus said unto his disciples,
Verily I say unto you, It is hard for a rich man to enter into the
kingdom of heaven.

<span id="an_19:24">19:24</span> And again I say unto you, It is easier
for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter
into the kingdom of God.

<span id="an_19:25">19:25</span> And when the disciples heard it, they
were astonished exceedingly, saying, Who then can be saved?

<span id="an_19:26">19:26</span> And Jesus looking upon \[them\] said to
them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.

<span id="an_19:27">19:27</span> Then answered Peter and said unto him,
Lo, we have left all, and followed thee; what then shall we have?

<span id="an_19:28">19:28</span> And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say
unto you, that ye who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son
of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon
twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

<span id="an_19:29">19:29</span> And every one that hath left houses, or
brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for
my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal
life.

<span id="an_19:30">19:30</span> But many shall be last \[that are\]
first; and first \[that are\] last.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a
man that was a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire
laborers into his vineyard.

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> And when he had agreed with the laborers
for a shilling a day, he sent them into his vineyard.

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> And he went out about the third hour, and
saw others standing in the marketplace idle;

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> and to them he said, Go ye also into the
vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their
way.

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> Again he went out about the sixth and the
ninth hour, and did likewise.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> And about the eleventh \[hour\] he went
out, and found others standing; and he saith unto them, Why stand ye
here all the day idle?

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> They say unto him, Because no man hath
hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> And when even was come, the lord of the
vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the laborers, and pay them their
hire, beginning from the last unto the first.

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> And when they came that \[were hired\]
about the eleventh hour, they received every man a shilling.

<span id="an_20:10">20:10</span> And when the first came, they supposed
that they would receive more; and they likewise received every man a
shilling.

<span id="an_20:11">20:11</span> And when they received it, they
murmured against the householder,

<span id="an_20:12">20:12</span> saying, These last have spent \[but\]
one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, who have borne the
burden of the day and the scorching heat.

<span id="an_20:13">20:13</span> But he answered and said to one of
them, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a
shilling?

<span id="an_20:14">20:14</span> Take up that which is thine, and go thy
way; it is my will to give unto this last, even as unto thee.

<span id="an_20:15">20:15</span> Is it not lawful for me to do what I
will with mine own? or is thine eye evil, because I am good?

<span id="an_20:16">20:16</span> So the last shall be first, and the
first last.

<span id="an_20:17">20:17</span> And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem,
he took the twelve disciples apart, and on the way he said unto them,

<span id="an_20:18">20:18</span> Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the
Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and scribes; and
they shall condemn him to death,

<span id="an_20:19">20:19</span> and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles
to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify: and the third day he shall be
raised up.

<span id="an_20:20">20:20</span> Then came to him the mother of the sons
of Zebedee with her sons, worshipping \[him\], and asking a certain
thing of him.

<span id="an_20:21">20:21</span> And he said unto her, What wouldest
thou? She saith unto him, Command that these my two sons may sit, one on
thy right hand, and one on thy left hand, in thy kingdom.

<span id="an_20:22">20:22</span> But Jesus answered and said, Ye know
not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?
They say unto him, We are able.

<span id="an_20:23">20:23</span> He saith unto them, My cup indeed ye
shall drink: but to sit on my right hand, and on \[my\] left hand, is
not mine to give; but \[it is for them\] for whom it hath been prepared
of my Father.

<span id="an_20:24">20:24</span> And when the ten heard it, they were
moved with indignation concerning the two brethren.

<span id="an_20:25">20:25</span> But Jesus called them unto him, and
said, Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and
their great ones exercise authority over them.

<span id="an_20:26">20:26</span> Not so shall it be among you: but
whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister;

<span id="an_20:27">20:27</span> and whosoever would be first among you
shall be your servant:

<span id="an_20:28">20:28</span> even as the Son of man came not to be
ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for
many.

<span id="an_20:29">20:29</span> And as they went out from Jericho, a
great multitude followed him.

<span id="an_20:30">20:30</span> And behold, two blind men sitting by
the way side, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out,
saying, Lord, have mercy on us, thou son of David.

<span id="an_20:31">20:31</span> And the multitude rebuked them, that
they should hold their peace: but they cried out the more, saying, Lord,
have mercy on us, thou son of David.

<span id="an_20:32">20:32</span> And Jesus stood still, and called them,
and said, What will ye that I should do unto you?

<span id="an_20:33">20:33</span> They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes
may be opened.

<span id="an_20:34">20:34</span> And Jesus, being moved with compassion,
touched their eyes; and straightway they received their sight, and
followed him.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem,
and came unto Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two
disciples,

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> saying unto them, Go into the village
that is over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and
a colt with her: loose \[them\], and bring \[them\] unto me.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> And if any one say aught unto you, ye
shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send
them.

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> Now this is come to pass, that it might
be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy
King cometh unto thee, Meek, and riding upon an ass, And upon a colt the
foal of an ass.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> And the disciples went, and did even as
Jesus appointed them,

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> and brought the ass, and the colt, and
put on them their garments; and he sat thereon.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> And the most part of the multitude spread
their garments in the way; and others cut branches from the trees, and
spread them in the way.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> And the multitudes that went before him,
and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed
\[is\] he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> And when he was come into Jerusalem,
all the city was stirred, saying, Who is this?

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> And the multitudes said, This is the
prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> And Jesus entered into the temple of
God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and
overthrew the tables of he money-changers, and the seats of them that
sold the doves;

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> and he saith unto them, It is written,
My house shall be called a house of prayer: but ye make it a den of
robbers.

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> And the blind and the lame came to him
in the temple; and he healed them.

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> But when the chief priests and the
scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children that were
crying in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were
moved with indignation,

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> and said unto him, Hearest thou what
these are saying? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea: did ye never read, Out
of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has perfected praise?

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> And he left them, and went forth out of
the city to Bethany, and lodged there.

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> Now in the morning as he returned to
the city, he hungered.

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> And seeing a fig tree by the way side,
he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only; and he saith
unto it, Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And
immediately the fig tree withered away.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> And when the disciples saw it, they
marvelled, saying, How did the fig tree immediately wither away?

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> And Jesus answered and said unto them,
Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not
only do what is done to the fig tree, but even if ye shall say unto this
mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, it shall be done.

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask
in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> And when he was come into the temple,
the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was
teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who
gave thee this authority?

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> And Jesus answered and said unto them,
I also will ask you one question, which if ye tell me, I likewise will
tell you by what authority I do these things.

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> The baptism of John, whence was it?
from heaven or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If
we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why then did ye not
believe him?

<span id="an_21:26">21:26</span> But if we shall say, From men; we fear
the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet.

<span id="an_21:27">21:27</span> And they answered Jesus, and said, We
know not. He also said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I
do these things.

<span id="an_21:28">21:28</span> But what think ye? A man had two sons;
and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to-day in the vineyard.

<span id="an_21:29">21:29</span> And he answered and said, I will not:
but afterward he repented himself, and went.

<span id="an_21:30">21:30</span> And he came to the second, and said
likewise. And he answered and said, I \[go\], sir: and went not.

<span id="an_21:31">21:31</span> Which of the two did the will of his
father? They say, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto
you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God
before you.

<span id="an_21:32">21:32</span> For John came unto you in the way of
righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and the
harlots believed him: and ye, when ye saw it, did not even repent
yourselves afterward, that ye might believe him.

<span id="an_21:33">21:33</span> Hear another parable: There was a man
that was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about
it, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to
husbandmen, and went into another country.

<span id="an_21:34">21:34</span> And when the season of the fruits drew
near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive his fruits.

<span id="an_21:35">21:35</span> And the husbandmen took his servants,
and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.

<span id="an_21:36">21:36</span> Again, he sent other servants more than
the first: and they did unto them in like manner.

<span id="an_21:37">21:37</span> But afterward he sent unto them his
son, saying, They will reverence my son.

<span id="an_21:38">21:38</span> But the husbandmen, when they saw the
son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and
take his inheritance.

<span id="an_21:39">21:39</span> And they took him, and cast him forth
out of the vineyard, and killed him.

<span id="an_21:40">21:40</span> When therefore the lord of the vineyard
shall come, what will he do unto those husbandmen?

<span id="an_21:41">21:41</span> They say unto him, He will miserably
destroy those miserable men, and will let out the vineyard unto other
husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their seasons.

<span id="an_21:42">21:42</span> Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never
read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, The same
was made the head of the corner; This was from the Lord, And it is
marvelous in our eyes?

<span id="an_21:43">21:43</span> Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom
of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation
bringing forth the fruits thereof.

<span id="an_21:44">21:44</span> And he that falleth on this stone shall
be broken to pieces: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter
him as dust.

<span id="an_21:45">21:45</span> And when the chief priests and the
Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.

<span id="an_21:46">21:46</span> And when they sought to lay hold on
him, they feared the multitudes, because they took him for a prophet.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> And Jesus answered and spake again in
parables unto them, saying,

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a
certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> and sent forth his servants to call them
that were bidden to the marriage feast: and they would not come.

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> Again he sent forth other servants,
saying, Tell them that are bidden, Behold, I have made ready my dinner;
my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to
the marriage feast.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> But they made light of it, and went their
ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise;

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> and the rest laid hold on his servants,
and treated them shamefully, and killed them.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> But the king was wroth; and he sent his
armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> Then saith he to his servants, The
wedding is ready, but they that were bidden were not worthy.

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> Go ye therefore unto the partings of the
highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage feast.

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> And those servants went out into the
highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and
good: and the wedding was filled with guests.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> But when the king came in to behold the
guests, he saw there a man who had not on a wedding-garment:

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> and he saith unto him, Friend, how
camest thou in hither not having a wedding-garment? And he was
speechless.

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> Then the king said to the servants,
Bind him hand and foot, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there
shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> For many are called, but few chosen.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> Then went the Pharisees, and took
counsel how they might ensnare him in \[his\] talk.

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> And they send to him their disciples,
with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and
teachest the way of God in truth, and carest not for any one: for thou
regardest not the person of men.

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou?
Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> But Jesus perceived their wickedness,
and said, Why make ye trial of me, ye hypocrites?

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> Show me the tribute money. And they
brought unto him a denarius.

<span id="an_22:20">22:20</span> And he saith unto them, Whose is this
image and superscription?

<span id="an_22:21">22:21</span> They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith
he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's;
and unto God the things that are God's.

<span id="an_22:22">22:22</span> And when they heard it, they marvelled,
and left him, and went away.

<span id="an_22:23">22:23</span> On that day there came to him
Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection: and they asked
him,

<span id="an_22:24">22:24</span> saying, Teacher, Moses said, If a man
die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up
seed unto his brother.

<span id="an_22:25">22:25</span> Now there were with us seven brethren:
and the first married and deceased, and having no seed left his wife
unto his brother;

<span id="an_22:26">22:26</span> in like manner the second also, and the
third, unto the seventh.

<span id="an_22:27">22:27</span> And after them all, the woman died.

<span id="an_22:28">22:28</span> In the resurrection therefore whose
wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.

<span id="an_22:29">22:29</span> But Jesus answered and said unto them,
Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.

<span id="an_22:30">22:30</span> For in the resurrection they neither
marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven.

<span id="an_22:31">22:31</span> But as touching the resurrection of the
dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,

<span id="an_22:32">22:32</span> I am the God of Abraham, and the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not \[the God\] of the dead, but of
the living.

<span id="an_22:33">22:33</span> And when the multitudes heard it, they
were astonished at his teaching.

<span id="an_22:34">22:34</span> But the Pharisees, when they heard that
he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered themselves together.

<span id="an_22:35">22:35</span> And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a
question, trying him:

<span id="an_22:36">22:36</span> Teacher, which is the great commandment
in the law?

<span id="an_22:37">22:37</span> And he said unto him, Thou shalt love
the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all
thy mind.

<span id="an_22:38">22:38</span> This is the great and first
commandment.

<span id="an_22:39">22:39</span> And a second like \[unto it\] is this,
Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.

<span id="an_22:40">22:40</span> On these two commandments the whole law
hangeth, and the prophets.

<span id="an_22:41">22:41</span> Now while the Pharisees were gathered
together, Jesus asked them a question,

<span id="an_22:42">22:42</span> saying, What think ye of the Christ?
whose son is he? They say unto him, \[The son\] of David.

<span id="an_22:43">22:43</span> He saith unto them, How then doth David
in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,

<span id="an_22:44">22:44</span> The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on
my right hand, Till I put thine enemies underneath thy feet?

<span id="an_22:45">22:45</span> If David then calleth him Lord, how is
he his son?

<span id="an_22:46">22:46</span> And no one was able to answer him a
word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more
questions.

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> Then spake Jesus to the multitudes and to
his disciples,

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit
on Moses seat:

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> all things therefore whatsoever they bid
you, \[these\] do and observe: but do not ye after their works; for they
say, and do not.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> Yea, they bind heavy burdens and grievous
to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will
not move them with their finger.

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> But all their works they do to be seen of
men: for they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders
\[of their garments\],

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> and love the chief place at feasts, and
the chief seats in the synagogues,

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> and the salutations in the marketplaces,
and to be called of men, Rabbi.

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is
your teacher, and all ye are brethren.

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> And call no man your father on the earth:
for one is your Father, \[even\] he who is in heaven.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> Neither be ye called masters: for one
is your master, \[even\] the Christ.

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> But he that is greatest among you shall
be your servant.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> And whosoever shall exalt himself shall
be humbled; and whosoever shall humble himself shall be exalted.

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> But woe unto you, scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye shut the kingdom of heaven against
men: for ye enter not in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are
entering in to enter\[.\]

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, even while for a pretence ye
make long prayers: therefore ye shall receive greater condemnation.

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when
he is become so, ye make him twofold more a son of hell than yourselves.

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> Woe unto you, ye blind guides, that
say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever
shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor.

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> Ye fools and blind: for which is
greater, the gold, or the temple that hath sanctified the gold?

<span id="an_23:18">23:18</span> And, Whosoever shall swear by the
altar, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon
it, he is a debtor.

<span id="an_23:19">23:19</span> Ye blind: for which is greater, the
gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?

<span id="an_23:20">23:20</span> He therefore that sweareth by the
altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.

<span id="an_23:21">23:21</span> And he that sweareth by the temple,
sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.

<span id="an_23:22">23:22</span> And he that sweareth by the heaven,
sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.

<span id="an_23:23">23:23</span> Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! for ye tithe mint and anise and cummin, and have left undone
the weightier matters of the law, justice, and mercy, and faith: but
these ye ought to have done, and not to have left the other undone.

<span id="an_23:24">23:24</span> Ye blind guides, that strain out the
gnat, and swallow the camel!

<span id="an_23:25">23:25</span> Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter,
but within they are full from extortion and excess.

<span id="an_23:26">23:26</span> Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the
inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside thereof may
become clean also.

<span id="an_23:27">23:27</span> Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which outwardly
appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men's bones, and of all
uncleanness.

<span id="an_23:28">23:28</span> Even so ye also outwardly appear
righteous unto men, but inwardly ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

<span id="an_23:29">23:29</span> Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and garnish the
tombs of the righteous,

<span id="an_23:30">23:30</span> and say, If we had been in the days of
our fathers, we should not have been partakers with them in the blood of
the prophets.

<span id="an_23:31">23:31</span> Wherefore ye witness to yourselves,
that ye are sons of them that slew the prophets.

<span id="an_23:32">23:32</span> Fill ye up then the measure of your
fathers.

<span id="an_23:33">23:33</span> Ye serpents, ye offspring of vipers,
how shall ye escape the judgment of hell?

<span id="an_23:34">23:34</span> Therefore, behold, I send unto you
prophets, and wise men, and scribes: some of them shall ye kill and
crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and
persecute from city to city:

<span id="an_23:35">23:35</span> that upon you may come all the
righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous
unto the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom ye slew between the
sanctuary and the altar.

<span id="an_23:36">23:36</span> Verily I say unto you, All these things
shall come upon this generation.

<span id="an_23:37">23:37</span> O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killeth
the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would I
have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her
chickens under her wings, and ye would not!

<span id="an_23:38">23:38</span> Behold, your house is left unto you
desolate.

<span id="an_23:39">23:39</span> For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me
henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed \[is\] he that cometh in the name
of the Lord.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> And Jesus went out from the temple, and
was going on his way; and his disciples came to him to show him the
buildings of the temple.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> But he answered and said unto them, See
ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left
here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the
disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these
things be? and what \[shall be\] the sign of thy coming, and of the end
of the world?

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> And Jesus answered and said unto them,
Take heed that no man lead you astray.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> For many shall come in my name, saying, I
am the Christ; and shall lead many astray.

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of
wars; see that ye be not troubled: for \[these things\] must needs come
to pass; but the end is not yet.

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> For nation shall rise against nation, and
kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines and earthquakes in
divers places.

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> But all these things are the beginning of
travail.

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> Then shall they deliver you up unto
tribulation, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all the
nations for my name's sake.

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> And then shall many stumble, and shall
deliver up one another, and shall hate one another.

<span id="an_24:11">24:11</span> And many false prophets shall arise,
and shall lead many astray.

<span id="an_24:12">24:12</span> And because iniquity shall be
multiplied, the love of the many shall wax cold.

<span id="an_24:13">24:13</span> But he that endureth to the end, the
same shall be saved.

<span id="an_24:14">24:14</span> And this gospel of the kingdom shall be
preached in the whole world for a testimony unto all the nations; and
then shall the end come.

<span id="an_24:15">24:15</span> When therefore ye see the abomination
of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing
in the holy place (let him that readeth understand),

<span id="an_24:16">24:16</span> then let them that are in Judaea flee
unto the mountains:

<span id="an_24:17">24:17</span> let him that is on the housetop not go
down to take out things that are in his house:

<span id="an_24:18">24:18</span> and let him that is in the field not
return back to take his cloak.

<span id="an_24:19">24:19</span> But woe unto them that are with child
and to them that give suck in those days!

<span id="an_24:20">24:20</span> And pray ye that your flight be not in
the winter, neither on a sabbath:

<span id="an_24:21">24:21</span> for then shall be great tribulation,
such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor
ever shall be.

<span id="an_24:22">24:22</span> And except those days had been
shortened, no flesh would have been saved: but for the elect's sake
those days shall be shortened.

<span id="an_24:23">24:23</span> Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo,
here is the Christ, or, Here; believe \[it\] not.

<span id="an_24:24">24:24</span> For there shall arise false Christs,
and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; so as to
lead astray, if possible, even the elect.

<span id="an_24:25">24:25</span> Behold, I have told you beforehand.

<span id="an_24:26">24:26</span> If therefore they shall say unto you,
Behold, he is in the wilderness; go not forth: Behold, he is in the
inner chambers; believe \[it\] not.

<span id="an_24:27">24:27</span> For as the lightning cometh forth from
the east, and is seen even unto the west; so shall be the coming of the
Son of man.

<span id="an_24:28">24:28</span> Wheresoever the carcase is, there will
the eagles be gathered together.

<span id="an_24:29">24:29</span> But immediately after the tribulation
of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her
light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the
heavens shall be shaken:

<span id="an_24:30">24:30</span> and then shall appear the sign of the
Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn,
and they shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with
power and great glory.

<span id="an_24:31">24:31</span> And he shall send forth his angels with
a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect
from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.

<span id="an_24:32">24:32</span> Now from the fig tree learn her
parable: when her branch is now become tender, and putteth forth its
leaves, ye know that the summer is nigh;

<span id="an_24:33">24:33</span> even so ye also, when ye see all these
things, know ye that he is nigh, \[even\] at the doors.

<span id="an_24:34">24:34</span> Verily I say unto you, This generation
shall not pass away, till all these things be accomplished.

<span id="an_24:35">24:35</span> Heaven and earth shall pass away, but
my words shall not pass away.

<span id="an_24:36">24:36</span> But of that day and hour knoweth no
one, not even the angels of heaven, neither the Son, but the Father
only.

<span id="an_24:37">24:37</span> And as \[were\] the days of Noah, so
shall be the coming of the Son of man.

<span id="an_24:38">24:38</span> For as in those days which were before
the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in
marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,

<span id="an_24:39">24:39</span> and they knew not until the flood came,
and took them all away; so shall be the coming of the Son of man.

<span id="an_24:40">24:40</span> Then shall two man be in the field; one
is taken, and one is left:

<span id="an_24:41">24:41</span> two women \[shall be\] grinding at the
mill; one is taken, and one is left.

<span id="an_24:42">24:42</span> Watch therefore: for ye know not on
what day your Lord cometh.

<span id="an_24:43">24:43</span> But know this, that if the master of
the house had known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have
watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through.

<span id="an_24:44">24:44</span> Therefore be ye also ready; for in an
hour that ye think not the Son of man cometh.

<span id="an_24:45">24:45</span> Who then is the faithful and wise
servant, whom his lord hath set over his household, to give them their
food in due season?

<span id="an_24:46">24:46</span> Blessed is that servant, whom his lord
when he cometh shall find so doing.

<span id="an_24:47">24:47</span> Verily I say unto you, that he will set
him over all that he hath.

<span id="an_24:48">24:48</span> But if that evil servant shall say in
his heart, My lord tarrieth;

<span id="an_24:49">24:49</span> and shall begin to beat his
fellow-servants, and shall eat and drink with the drunken;

<span id="an_24:50">24:50</span> the lord of that servant shall come in
a day when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he knoweth not,

<span id="an_24:51">24:51</span> and shall cut him asunder, and appoint
his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be the weeping and the
gnashing of teeth.

<span id="an_25:1">25:1</span> Then shall the kingdom of heaven be
likened unto ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went forth to meet
the bridegroom.

<span id="an_25:2">25:2</span> And five of them were foolish, and five
were wise.

<span id="an_25:3">25:3</span> For the foolish, when they took their
lamps, took no oil with them:

<span id="an_25:4">25:4</span> but the wise took oil in their vessels
with their lamps.

<span id="an_25:5">25:5</span> Now while the bridegroom tarried, they
all slumbered and slept.

<span id="an_25:6">25:6</span> But at midnight there is a cry, Behold,
the bridegroom! Come ye forth to meet him.

<span id="an_25:7">25:7</span> Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed
their lamps.

<span id="an_25:8">25:8</span> And the foolish said unto the wise, Give
us of your oil; for our lamps are going out.

<span id="an_25:9">25:9</span> But the wise answered, saying,
Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: go ye rather to
them that sell, and buy for yourselves.

<span id="an_25:10">25:10</span> And while they went away to buy, the
bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the
marriage feast: and the door was shut.

<span id="an_25:11">25:11</span> Afterward came also the other virgins,
saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.

<span id="an_25:12">25:12</span> But he answered and said, Verily I say
unto you, I know you not.

<span id="an_25:13">25:13</span> Watch therefore, for ye know not the
day nor the hour.

<span id="an_25:14">25:14</span> For \[it is\] as \[when\] a man, going
into another country, called his own servants, and delivered unto them
his goods.

<span id="an_25:15">25:15</span> And unto one he gave five talents, to
another two, to another one; to each according to his several ability;
and he went on his journey.

<span id="an_25:16">25:16</span> Straightway he that received the five
talents went and traded with them, and made other five talents.

<span id="an_25:17">25:17</span> In like manner he also that
\[received\] the two gained other two.

<span id="an_25:18">25:18</span> But he that received the one went away
and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.

<span id="an_25:19">25:19</span> Now after a long time the lord of those
servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them.

<span id="an_25:20">25:20</span> And he that received the five talents
came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto
me five talents: lo, I have gained other five talents.

<span id="an_25:21">25:21</span> His lord said unto him, Well done, good
and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will
set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

<span id="an_25:22">25:22</span> And he also that \[received\] the two
talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: lo, I
have gained other two talents.

<span id="an_25:23">25:23</span> His lord said unto him, Well done, good
and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will
set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

<span id="an_25:24">25:24</span> And he also that had received the one
talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man,
reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou didst not
scatter;

<span id="an_25:25">25:25</span> and I was afraid, and went away and hid
thy talent in the earth: lo, thou hast thine own.

<span id="an_25:26">25:26</span> But his lord answered and said unto
him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I
sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter;

<span id="an_25:27">25:27</span> thou oughtest therefore to have put my
money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back mine
own with interest.

<span id="an_25:28">25:28</span> Take ye away therefore the talent from
him, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents.

<span id="an_25:29">25:29</span> For unto every one that hath shall be
given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even
that which he hath shall be taken away.

<span id="an_25:30">25:30</span> And cast ye out the unprofitable
servant into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the
gnashing of teeth.

<span id="an_25:31">25:31</span> But when the Son of man shall come in
his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne
of his glory:

<span id="an_25:32">25:32</span> and before him shall be gathered all
the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as the
shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats;

<span id="an_25:33">25:33</span> and he shall set the sheep on his right
hand, but the goats on the left.

<span id="an_25:34">25:34</span> Then shall the King say unto them on
his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world:

<span id="an_25:35">25:35</span> for I was hungry, and ye gave me to
eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took
me in;

<span id="an_25:36">25:36</span> naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick,
and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me.

<span id="an_25:37">25:37</span> Then shall the righteous answer him,
saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee? or athirst, and
gave thee drink?

<span id="an_25:38">25:38</span> And when saw we thee a stranger, and
took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?

<span id="an_25:39">25:39</span> And when saw we thee sick, or in
prison, and came unto thee?

<span id="an_25:40">25:40</span> And the King shall answer and say unto
them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my
brethren, \[even\] these least, ye did it unto me.

<span id="an_25:41">25:41</span> Then shall he say also unto them on the
left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is
prepared for the devil and his angels:

<span id="an_25:42">25:42</span> for I was hungry, and ye did not give
me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;

<span id="an_25:43">25:43</span> I was a stranger, and ye took me not
in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me
not.

<span id="an_25:44">25:44</span> Then shall they also answer, saying,
Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or
sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?

<span id="an_25:45">25:45</span> Then shall he answer them, saying,
Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these
least, ye did it not unto me.

<span id="an_25:46">25:46</span> And these shall go away into eternal
punishment: but the righteous into eternal life.

<span id="an_26:1">26:1</span> And it came to pass, when Jesus had
finished all these words, he said unto his disciples,

<span id="an_26:2">26:2</span> Ye know that after two days the passover
cometh, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.

<span id="an_26:3">26:3</span> Then were gathered together the chief
priests, and the elders of the people, unto the court of the high
priest, who was called Caiaphas;

<span id="an_26:4">26:4</span> and they took counsel together that they
might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him.

<span id="an_26:5">26:5</span> But they said, Not during the feast, lest
a tumult arise among people.

<span id="an_26:6">26:6</span> Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the
house of Simon the leper,

<span id="an_26:7">26:7</span> there came unto him a woman having an
alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment, and she poured it upon
his head, as he sat at meat.

<span id="an_26:8">26:8</span> But when the disciples saw it, they had
indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?

<span id="an_26:9">26:9</span> For this \[ointment\] might have been
sold for much, and given to the poor.

<span id="an_26:10">26:10</span> But Jesus perceiving it said unto them,
Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.

<span id="an_26:11">26:11</span> For ye have the poor always with you;
but me ye have not always.

<span id="an_26:12">26:12</span> For in that she poured this ointment
upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.

<span id="an_26:13">26:13</span> Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this
gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman
hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.

<span id="an_26:14">26:14</span> Then one of the twelve, who was called
Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,

<span id="an_26:15">26:15</span> and said, What are ye willing to give
me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they weighed unto him thirty
pieces of silver.

<span id="an_26:16">26:16</span> And from that time he sought
opportunity to deliver him \[unto them.\]

<span id="an_26:17">26:17</span> Now on the first \[day\] of unleavened
bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we make
ready for thee to eat the passover?

<span id="an_26:18">26:18</span> And he said, Go into the city to such a
man, and say unto him, The Teacher saith, My time is at hand; I keep the
passover at thy house with my disciples.

<span id="an_26:19">26:19</span> And the disciples did as Jesus
appointed them; and they made ready the passover.

<span id="an_26:20">26:20</span> Now when even was come, he was sitting
at meat with the twelve disciples;

<span id="an_26:21">26:21</span> and as they were eating, he said,
Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.

<span id="an_26:22">26:22</span> And they were exceeding sorrowful, and
began to say unto him every one, Is it I, Lord?

<span id="an_26:23">26:23</span> And he answered and said, He that
dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.

<span id="an_26:24">26:24</span> The Son of man goeth, even as it is
written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is
betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born.

<span id="an_26:25">26:25</span> And Judas, who betrayed him, answered
and said, Is it I, Rabbi? He saith unto him, Thou hast said.

<span id="an_26:26">26:26</span> And as they were eating, Jesus took
bread, and blessed, and brake it; and he gave to the disciples, and
said, Take, eat; this is my body.

<span id="an_26:27">26:27</span> And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and
gave to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;

<span id="an_26:28">26:28</span> for this is my blood of the covenant,
which is poured out for many unto remission of sins.

<span id="an_26:29">26:29</span> But I say unto you, I shall not drink
henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new
with you in my Father's kingdom.

<span id="an_26:30">26:30</span> And when they had sung a hymn, they
went out unto the mount of Olives.

<span id="an_26:31">26:31</span> Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye
shall be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will smite the
shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.

<span id="an_26:32">26:32</span> But after I am raised up, I will go
before you into Galilee.

<span id="an_26:33">26:33</span> But Peter answered and said unto him,
If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended.

<span id="an_26:34">26:34</span> Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto
thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.

<span id="an_26:35">26:35</span> Peter saith unto him, Even if I must
die with thee, \[yet\] will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the
disciples.

<span id="an_26:36">26:36</span> Then cometh Jesus with them unto a
place called Gethsemane, and saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here,
while I go yonder and pray.

<span id="an_26:37">26:37</span> And he took with him Peter and the two
sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled.

<span id="an_26:38">26:38</span> Then saith he unto them, My soul is
exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: abide ye here, and watch with me.

<span id="an_26:39">26:39</span> And he went forward a little, and fell
on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this
cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.

<span id="an_26:40">26:40</span> And he cometh unto the disciples, and
findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch
with me one hour?

<span id="an_26:41">26:41</span> Watch and pray, that ye enter not into
temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.

<span id="an_26:42">26:42</span> Again a second time he went away, and
prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it,
thy will be done.

<span id="an_26:43">26:43</span> And he came again and found them
sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.

<span id="an_26:44">26:44</span> And he left them again, and went away,
and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.

<span id="an_26:45">26:45</span> Then cometh he to the disciples, and
saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is
at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

<span id="an_26:46">26:46</span> Arise, let us be going: behold, he is
at hand that betrayeth me.

<span id="an_26:47">26:47</span> And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one
of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and
staves, from the chief priest and elders of the people.

<span id="an_26:48">26:48</span> Now he that betrayed him gave them a
sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take him.

<span id="an_26:49">26:49</span> And straightway he came to Jesus, and
said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.

<span id="an_26:50">26:50</span> And Jesus said unto him, Friend, \[do\]
that for which thou art come. Then they came and laid hands on Jesus,
and took him.

<span id="an_26:51">26:51</span> And behold, one of them that were with
Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote the servant
of the high priest, and struck off his ear.

<span id="an_26:52">26:52</span> Then saith Jesus unto him, Put up again
thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish
with the sword.

<span id="an_26:53">26:53</span> Or thinkest thou that I cannot beseech
my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of
angels?

<span id="an_26:54">26:54</span> How then should the scriptures be
fulfilled that thus it must be?

<span id="an_26:55">26:55</span> In that hour said Jesus to the
multitudes, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves
to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and ye took me not.

<span id="an_26:56">26:56</span> But all this is come to pass, that the
scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples
left him, and fled.

<span id="an_26:57">26:57</span> And they that had taken Jesus led him
away to \[the house of\] Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and
the elders were gathered together.

<span id="an_26:58">26:58</span> But Peter followed him afar off, unto
the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the officers,
to see the end.

<span id="an_26:59">26:59</span> Now the chief priests and the whole
council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to
death;

<span id="an_26:60">26:60</span> and they found it not, though many
false witnesses came. But afterward came two,

<span id="an_26:61">26:61</span> and said, This man said, I am able to
destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.

<span id="an_26:62">26:62</span> And the high priest stood up, and said
unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against
thee?

<span id="an_26:63">26:63</span> But Jesus held his peace. And the high
priest said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us
whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God.

<span id="an_26:64">26:64</span> Jesus said unto him, Thou hast said:
nevertheless I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man
sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.

<span id="an_26:65">26:65</span> Then the high priest rent his garments,
saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of
witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy:

<span id="an_26:66">26:66</span> what think ye? They answered and said,
He is worthy of death.

<span id="an_26:67">26:67</span> Then did they spit in his face and
buffet him: and some smote him with the palms of their hands,

<span id="an_26:68">26:68</span> saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ:
who is he that struck thee?

<span id="an_26:69">26:69</span> Now Peter was sitting without in the
court: and a maid came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus the
Galilaean.

<span id="an_26:70">26:70</span> But he denied before them all, saying,
I know not what thou sayest.

<span id="an_26:71">26:71</span> And when he was gone out into the
porch, another \[maid\] saw him, and saith unto them that were there,
This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.

<span id="an_26:72">26:72</span> And again he denied with an oath, I
know not the man.

<span id="an_26:73">26:73</span> And after a little while they that
stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth thou also art \[one\] of
them; for thy speech maketh thee known.

<span id="an_26:74">26:74</span> Then began he to curse and to swear, I
know not the man. And straightway the cock crew.

<span id="an_26:75">26:75</span> And Peter remembered the word which
Jesus had said, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he
went out, and wept bitterly.

<span id="an_27:1">27:1</span> Now when morning was come, all the chief
priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put
him to death:

<span id="an_27:2">27:2</span> and they bound him, and led him away, and
delivered him up to Pilate the governor.

<span id="an_27:3">27:3</span> Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw
that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought back the thirty
pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,

<span id="an_27:4">27:4</span> saying, I have sinned in that I betrayed
innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? see thou \[to it\].

<span id="an_27:5">27:5</span> And he cast down the pieces of silver
into the sanctuary, and departed; and he went away and hanged himself.

<span id="an_27:6">27:6</span> And the chief priests took the pieces of
silver, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since
it is the price of blood.

<span id="an_27:7">27:7</span> And they took counsel, and bought with
them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.

<span id="an_27:8">27:8</span> Wherefore that field was called, the
field of blood, unto this day.

<span id="an_27:9">27:9</span> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken
through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of
silver, the price of him that was priced, whom \[certain\] of the
children of Israel did price;

<span id="an_27:10">27:10</span> and they gave them for the potter's
field, as the Lord appointed me.

<span id="an_27:11">27:11</span> Now Jesus stood before the governor:
and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And
Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.

<span id="an_27:12">27:12</span> And when he was accused by the chief
priests and elders, he answered nothing.

<span id="an_27:13">27:13</span> Then saith Pilate unto him, Hearest
thou not how many things they witness against thee?

<span id="an_27:14">27:14</span> And he gave him no answer, not even to
one word: insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.

<span id="an_27:15">27:15</span> Now at the feast the governor was wont
to release unto the multitude one prisoner, whom they would.

<span id="an_27:16">27:16</span> And they had then a notable prisoner,
called Barabbas.

<span id="an_27:17">27:17</span> When therefore they were gathered
together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you?
Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?

<span id="an_27:18">27:18</span> For he knew that for envy they had
delivered him up.

<span id="an_27:19">27:19</span> And while he was sitting on the
judgment-seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do
with that righteous man; for I have suffered many things this day in a
dream because of him.

<span id="an_27:20">27:20</span> Now the chief priests and the elders
persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy
Jesus.

<span id="an_27:21">27:21</span> But the governor answered and said unto
them, Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? And they said,
Barabbas.

<span id="an_27:22">27:22</span> Pilate saith unto them, What then shall
I do unto Jesus who is called Christ? They all say, Let him be
crucified.

<span id="an_27:23">27:23</span> And he said, Why, what evil hath he
done? But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified.

<span id="an_27:24">27:24</span> So when Pilate saw that he prevailed
nothing, but rather that a tumult was arising, he took water, and washed
his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of
this righteous man; see ye \[to it\].

<span id="an_27:25">27:25</span> And all the people answered and said,
His blood \[be\] on us, and on our children.

<span id="an_27:26">27:26</span> Then released he unto them Barabbas;
but Jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified.

<span id="an_27:27">27:27</span> Then the soldiers of the governor took
Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered unto him the whole band.

<span id="an_27:28">27:28</span> And they stripped him, and put on him a
scarlet robe.

<span id="an_27:29">27:29</span> And they platted a crown of thorns and
put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled
down before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!

<span id="an_27:30">27:30</span> And they spat upon him, and took the
reed and smote him on the head.

<span id="an_27:31">27:31</span> And when they had mocked him, they took
off from him the robe, and put on him his garments, and led him away to
crucify him.

<span id="an_27:32">27:32</span> And as they came out, they found a man
of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to go \[with them\], that
he might bear his cross.

<span id="an_27:33">27:33</span> And they were come unto a place called
Golgotha, that is to say, The place of a skull,

<span id="an_27:34">27:34</span> they gave him wine to drink mingled
with gall: and when he had tasted it, he would not drink.

<span id="an_27:35">27:35</span> And when they had crucified him, they
parted his garments among them, casting lots;

<span id="an_27:36">27:36</span> and they sat and watched him there.

<span id="an_27:37">27:37</span> And they set up over his head his
accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

<span id="an_27:38">27:38</span> Then are there crucified with him two
robbers, one on the right hand and one on the left.

<span id="an_27:39">27:39</span> And they that passed by railed on him,
wagging their heads,

<span id="an_27:40">27:40</span> and saying, Thou that destroyest the
temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son
of God, come down from the cross.

<span id="an_27:41">27:41</span> In like manner also the chief priests
mocking \[him\], with the scribes and elders, said,

<span id="an_27:42">27:42</span> He saved others; himself he cannot
save. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross,
and we will believe on him.

<span id="an_27:43">27:43</span> He trusteth on God; let him deliver him
now, if he desireth him: for he said, I am the Son of God.

<span id="an_27:44">27:44</span> And the robbers also that were
crucified with him cast upon him the same reproach.

<span id="an_27:45">27:45</span> Now from the sixth hour there was
darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.

<span id="an_27:46">27:46</span> And about the ninth hour Jesus cried
with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God,
my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

<span id="an_27:47">27:47</span> And some of them stood there, when they
heard it, said, This man calleth Elijah.

<span id="an_27:48">27:48</span> And straightway one of them ran, and
took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and
gave him to drink.

<span id="an_27:49">27:49</span> And the rest said, Let be; let us see
whether Elijah cometh to save him.

<span id="an_27:50">27:50</span> And Jesus cried again with a loud
voice, and yielded up his spirit.

<span id="an_27:51">27:51</span> And behold, the veil of the temple was
rent in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake; and the
rocks were rent;

<span id="an_27:52">27:52</span> and the tombs were opened; and many
bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised;

<span id="an_27:53">27:53</span> and coming forth out of the tombs after
his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many.

<span id="an_27:54">27:54</span> Now the centurion, and they that were
with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things
that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this was the Son of
God.

<span id="an_27:55">27:55</span> And many women were there beholding
from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:

<span id="an_27:56">27:56</span> among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary
the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.

<span id="an_27:57">27:57</span> And when even was come, there came a
rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus'
disciple:

<span id="an_27:58">27:58</span> this man went to Pilate, and asked for
the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given up.

<span id="an_27:59">27:59</span> And Joseph took the body, and wrapped
it in a clean linen cloth,

<span id="an_27:60">27:60</span> and laid it in his own new tomb, which
he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of
the tomb, and departed.

<span id="an_27:61">27:61</span> And Mary Magdalene was there, and the
other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.

<span id="an_27:62">27:62</span> Now on the morrow, which is \[the day\]
after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered
together unto Pilate,

<span id="an_27:63">27:63</span> saying, Sir, we remember that that
deceiver said while he was yet alive, After three days I rise again.

<span id="an_27:64">27:64</span> Command therefore that the sepulchre be
made sure until the third day, lest haply his disciples come and steal
him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: and the
last error will be worse than the first.

<span id="an_27:65">27:65</span> Pilate said unto them, Ye have a guard:
go, make it \[as\] sure as ye can.

<span id="an_27:66">27:66</span> So they went, and made the sepulchre
sure, sealing the stone, the guard being with them.

<span id="an_28:1">28:1</span> Now late on the sabbath day, as it began
to dawn toward the first \[day\] of the week, came Mary Magdalene and
the other Mary to see the sepulchre.

<span id="an_28:2">28:2</span> And behold, there was a great earthquake;
for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away
the stone, and sat upon it.

<span id="an_28:3">28:3</span> His appearance was as lightning, and his
raiment white as snow:

<span id="an_28:4">28:4</span> and for fear of him the watchers did
quake, and became as dead men.

<span id="an_28:5">28:5</span> And the angel answered and said unto the
women, Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus, who hath been
crucified.

<span id="an_28:6">28:6</span> He is not here; for he is risen, even as
he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.

<span id="an_28:7">28:7</span> And go quickly, and tell his disciples,
He is risen from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee;
there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.

<span id="an_28:8">28:8</span> And they departed quickly from the tomb
with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.

<span id="an_28:9">28:9</span> And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All
hail. And they came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him.

<span id="an_28:10">28:10</span> Then saith Jesus unto them, Fear not:
go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee, and there shall they
see me.

<span id="an_28:11">28:11</span> Now while they were going, behold, some
of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the
things that were come to pass.

<span id="an_28:12">28:12</span> And when they were assembled with the
elders, and had taken counsel, they gave much money unto the soldiers,

<span id="an_28:13">28:13</span> saying, Say ye, His disciples came by
night, and stole him away while we slept.

<span id="an_28:14">28:14</span> And if this come to the governor's
ears, we will persuade him, and rid you of care.

<span id="an_28:15">28:15</span> So they took the money, and did as they
were taught: and this saying was spread abroad among the Jews, \[and
continueth\] until this day.

<span id="an_28:16">28:16</span> But the eleven disciples went into
Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.

<span id="an_28:17">28:17</span> And when they saw him, they worshipped
\[him\]; but some doubted.

<span id="an_28:18">28:18</span> And Jesus came to them and spake unto
them, saying, All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on
earth.

<span id="an_28:19">28:19</span> Go ye therefore, and make disciples of
all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the
Son and of the Holy Spirit:

<span id="an_28:20">28:20</span> teaching them to observe all things
whatsoever I commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even unto the
end of the world.
