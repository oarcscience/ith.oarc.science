### American Standard Version: John

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> The same was in the beginning with God.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> All things were made through him; and
without him was not anything made that hath been made.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> In him was life; and the life was the light
of men.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And the light shineth in the darkness; and
the darkness apprehended it not.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> There came a man, sent from God, whose name
was John.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> The same came for witness, that he might
bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> He was not the light, but \[came\] that he
might bear witness of the light.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> There was the true light, \[even the
light\] which lighteth every man, coming into the world.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> He was in the world, and the world was
made through him, and the world knew him not.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> He came unto his own, and they that were
his own received him not.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> But as many as received him, to them gave
he the right to become children of God, \[even\] to them that believe on
his name:

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> who were born, not of blood, nor of the
will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> And the Word became flesh, and dwelt
among us (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from
the Father), full of grace and truth.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> John beareth witness of him, and crieth,
saying, This was he of whom I said, He that cometh after me is become
before me: for he was before me.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> For of his fulness we all received, and
grace for grace.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> For the law was given through Moses;
grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> No man hath seen God at any time; the
only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared
\[him\].

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> And this is the witness of John, when the
Jews sent unto him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, Who
art thou?

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> And he confessed, and denied not; and he
confessed, I am not the Christ.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> And they asked him, What then? Art thou
Elijah? And he saith, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered,
No.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> They said therefore unto him, Who art
thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou
of thyself?

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> He said, I am the voice of one crying in
the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the
prophet.

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> And they had been sent from the
Pharisees.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> And they asked him, and said unto him,
Why then baptizest thou, if thou art not the Christ, neither Elijah,
neither the prophet?

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> John answered them, saying, I baptize in
water: in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not,

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> \[even\] he that cometh after me, the
latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.

<span id="an_1:28">1:28</span> These things were done in Bethany beyond
the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

<span id="an_1:29">1:29</span> On the morrow he seeth Jesus coming unto
him, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the
world!

<span id="an_1:30">1:30</span> This is he of whom I said, After me
cometh a man who is become before me: for he was before me.

<span id="an_1:31">1:31</span> And I knew him not; but that he should be
made manifest to Israel, for this cause came I baptizing in water.

<span id="an_1:32">1:32</span> And John bare witness, saying, I have
beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it abode upon
him.

<span id="an_1:33">1:33</span> And I knew him not: but he that sent me
to baptize in water, he said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the
Spirit descending, and abiding upon him, the same is he that baptizeth
in the Holy Spirit.

<span id="an_1:34">1:34</span> And I have seen, and have borne witness
that this is the Son of God.

<span id="an_1:35">1:35</span> Again on the morrow John was standing,
and two of his disciples;

<span id="an_1:36">1:36</span> and he looked upon Jesus as he walked,
and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God!

<span id="an_1:37">1:37</span> And the two disciples heard him speak,
and they followed Jesus.

<span id="an_1:38">1:38</span> And Jesus turned, and beheld them
following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? And they said unto him,
Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where abideth thou?

<span id="an_1:39">1:39</span> He saith unto them, Come, and ye shall
see. They came therefore and saw where he abode; and they abode with him
that day: it was about the tenth hour.

<span id="an_1:40">1:40</span> One of the two that heard John \[speak\],
and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.

<span id="an_1:41">1:41</span> He findeth first his own brother Simon,
and saith unto him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being
interpreted, Christ).

<span id="an_1:42">1:42</span> He brought him unto Jesus. Jesus looked
upon him, and said, Thou art Simon the son of John: thou shalt be called
Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter).

<span id="an_1:43">1:43</span> On the morrow he was minded to go forth
into Galilee, and he findeth Philip: and Jesus saith unto him, Follow
me.

<span id="an_1:44">1:44</span> Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the
city of Andrew and Peter.

<span id="an_1:45">1:45</span> Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto
him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets,
wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.

<span id="an_1:46">1:46</span> And Nathanael said unto him, Can any good
thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.

<span id="an_1:47">1:47</span> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and
saith of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!

<span id="an_1:48">1:48</span> Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest
thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before Philip called thee,
when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.

<span id="an_1:49">1:49</span> Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, thou art
the Son of God; thou art King of Israel.

<span id="an_1:50">1:50</span> Jesus answered and said unto him, Because
I said unto thee, I saw thee underneath the fig tree, believest thou?
thou shalt see greater things than these.

<span id="an_1:51">1:51</span> And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I
say unto you, Ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God
ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> And the third day there was a marriage in
Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> and Jesus also was bidden, and his
disciples, to the marriage.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And when the wine failed, the mother of
Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have
I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> His mother saith unto the servants,
Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> Now there were six waterpots of stone set
there after the Jews' manner of purifying, containing two or three
firkins apiece.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots
with water. And they filled them up to the brim.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and
bear unto the ruler of the feast. And they bare it.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> And when the ruler of the feast tasted the
water now become wine, and knew not whence it was (but the servants that
had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast calleth the
bridegroom,

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> and saith unto him, Every man setteth on
first the good wine; and when \[men\] have drunk freely, \[then\] that
which is worse: thou hast kept the good wine until now.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> This beginning of his signs did Jesus in
Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on
him.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> After this he went down to Capernaum, he,
and his mother, and \[his\] brethren, and his disciples; and there they
abode not many days.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And the passover of the Jews was at hand,
and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> And he found in the temple those that
sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> and he made a scourge of cords, and cast
all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out
the changers' money, and overthrew their tables;

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> and to them that sold the doves he said,
Take these things hence; make not my Father's house a house of
merchandise.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> His disciples remembered that it was
written, Zeal for thy house shall eat me up.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> The Jews therefore answered and said unto
him, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these
things?

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> Jesus answered and said unto them,
Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> The Jews therefore said, Forty and six
years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three
days?

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> But he spake of the temple of his body.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> When therefore he was raised from the
dead, his disciples remembered that he spake this; and they believed the
scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> Now when he was in Jerusalem at the
passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, beholding his
signs which he did.

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> But Jesus did not trust himself unto
them, for that he knew all men,

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> and because he needed not that any one
should bear witness concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named
Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> the same came unto him by night, and said
to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no one
can do these signs that thou doest, except God be with him.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily,
verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born anew, he cannot see the
kingdom of God.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be
born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's womb,
and be born?

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto
thee, Except one be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into
the kingdom of God!

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> That which is born of the flesh is flesh;
and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must
be born anew.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> The wind bloweth where it will, and thou
hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither
it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How
can these things be?

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> Jesus answered and said unto him, Art
thou the teacher of Israel, and understandest not these things?

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak
that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen; and ye
receive not our witness.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> If I told you earthly things and ye
believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly things?

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> And no one hath ascended into heaven, but
he that descended out of heaven, \[even\] the Son of man, who is in
heaven.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the
wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up;

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> that whosoever believeth may in him have
eternal life.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> For God so loved the world, that he gave
his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not
perish, but have eternal life.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> For God sent not the Son into the world
to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> He that believeth on him is not judged:
he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not
believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> And this is the judgment, that the light
is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the
light; for their works were evil.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> For every one that doeth evil hateth the
light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> But he that doeth the truth cometh to the
light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought
in God.

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> After these things came Jesus and his
disciples into the land of Judea; and there he tarried with them, and
baptized.

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> And John also was baptizing in Enon near
to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were
baptized.

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> For John was not yet cast into prison.

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> There arose therefore a questioning on
the part of John's disciples with a Jew about purifying.

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> And they came unto John, and said to him,
Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou hast borne
witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.

<span id="an_3:27">3:27</span> John answered and said, A man can receive
nothing, except it have been given him from heaven.

<span id="an_3:28">3:28</span> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I
said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent before him.

<span id="an_3:29">3:29</span> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom:
but the friend of the bridegroom, that standeth and heareth him,
rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy
therefore is made full.

<span id="an_3:30">3:30</span> He must increase, but I must decrease.

<span id="an_3:31">3:31</span> He that cometh from above is above all:
he that is of the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh:
he that cometh from heaven is above all.

<span id="an_3:32">3:32</span> What he hath seen and heard, of that he
beareth witness; and no man receiveth his witness.

<span id="an_3:33">3:33</span> He that hath received his witness hath
set his seal to \[this\], that God is true.

<span id="an_3:34">3:34</span> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the
words of God: for he giveth not the Spirit by measure.

<span id="an_3:35">3:35</span> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given
all things into his hand.

<span id="an_3:36">3:36</span> He that believeth on the Son hath eternal
life; but he that obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath
of God abideth on him.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> When therefore the Lord knew that the
Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples
than John

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> (although Jesus himself baptized not, but
his disciples),

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> he left Judea, and departed again into
Galilee.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> And he must needs pass through Samaria.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called
Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph:

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> and Jacob's well was there. Jesus
therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was
about the sixth hour.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw
water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> For his disciples were gone away into the
city to buy food.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto
him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a
Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> Jesus answered and said unto unto her, If
thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me
to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee
living water.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast
nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that
living water?

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> Art thou greater than our father Jacob,
who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his
cattle?

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> Jesus answered and said unto her, Every
one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again:

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> but whosoever drinketh of the water that
I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him
shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me
this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy
husband, and come hither.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> The woman answered and said unto him, I
have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no
husband:

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> for thou hast had five husbands; and he
whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive
that thou art a prophet.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain;
and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me,
the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall
ye worship the Father.

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> Ye worship that which ye know not: we
worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the
true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such
doth the Father seek to be his worshippers.

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> God is a Spirit: and they that worship
him must worship in spirit and truth.

<span id="an_4:25">4:25</span> The woman saith unto him, I know that
Messiah cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will
declare unto us all things.

<span id="an_4:26">4:26</span> Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto
thee am \[he\].

<span id="an_4:27">4:27</span> And upon this came his disciples; and
they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What
seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?

<span id="an_4:28">4:28</span> So the woman left her waterpot, and went
away into the city, and saith to the people,

<span id="an_4:29">4:29</span> Come, see a man, who told me all things
that \[ever\] I did: can this be the Christ?

<span id="an_4:30">4:30</span> They went out of the city, and were
coming to him.

<span id="an_4:31">4:31</span> In the mean while the disciples prayed
him, saying, Rabbi, eat.

<span id="an_4:32">4:32</span> But he said unto them, I have meat to eat
that ye know not.

<span id="an_4:33">4:33</span> The disciples therefore said one to
another, Hath any man brought him \[aught\] to eat?

<span id="an_4:34">4:34</span> Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do
the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.

<span id="an_4:35">4:35</span> Say not ye, There are yet four months,
and \[then\] cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your
eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest.

<span id="an_4:36">4:36</span> He that reapeth receiveth wages, and
gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that
reapeth may rejoice together.

<span id="an_4:37">4:37</span> For herein is the saying true, One
soweth, and another reapeth.

<span id="an_4:38">4:38</span> I sent you to reap that whereon ye have
not labored: others have labored, and ye are entered into their labor.

<span id="an_4:39">4:39</span> And from that city many of the Samaritans
believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told
me all things that \[ever\] I did.

<span id="an_4:40">4:40</span> So when the Samaritans came unto him,
they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days.

<span id="an_4:41">4:41</span> And many more believed because of his
word;

<span id="an_4:42">4:42</span> and they said to the woman, Now we
believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves,
and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.

<span id="an_4:43">4:43</span> And after the two days he went forth from
thence into Galilee.

<span id="an_4:44">4:44</span> For Jesus himself testified, that a
prophet hath no honor in his own country.

<span id="an_4:45">4:45</span> So when he came into Galilee, the
Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did in
Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.

<span id="an_4:46">4:46</span> He came therefore again unto Cana of
Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman,
whose son was sick at Capernaum.

<span id="an_4:47">4:47</span> When he heard that Jesus was come out of
Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought \[him\] that he
would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.

<span id="an_4:48">4:48</span> Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye
see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe.

<span id="an_4:49">4:49</span> The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come
down ere my child die.

<span id="an_4:50">4:50</span> Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son
liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went
his way.

<span id="an_4:51">4:51</span> And as he was now going down, his
servants met him, saying, that his son lived.

<span id="an_4:52">4:52</span> So he inquired of them the hour when he
began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh
hour the fever left him.

<span id="an_4:53">4:53</span> So the father knew that \[it was\] at
that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself
believed, and his whole house.

<span id="an_4:54">4:54</span> This is again the second sign that Jesus
did, having come out of Judaea into Galilee.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> After these things there was a feast of the
Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep
\[gate\] a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five
porches.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> In these lay a multitude of them that were
sick, blind, halt, withered, \[waiting for the moving of the water.\]

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> \[for an angel of the Lord went down at
certain seasons into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then
first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole, with
whatsoever disease he was holden.\]

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> And a certain man was there, who had been
thirty and eight years in his infirmity.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he
had been now a long time \[in that case\], he saith unto him, Wouldest
thou be made whole?

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no
man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am
coming, another steppeth down before me.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> Jesus saith unto him, Arise, take up thy
bed, and walk.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> And straightway the man was made whole, and
took up his bed and walked. Now it was the sabbath on that day.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> So the Jews said unto him that was cured,
It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> But he answered them, He that made me
whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> They asked him, Who is the man that said
unto thee, Take up \[thy bed\], and walk?

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> But he that was healed knew not who it
was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the
place.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> Afterward Jesus findeth him in the
temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more,
lest a worse thing befall thee.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> The man went away, and told the Jews that
it was Jesus who had made him whole.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> And for this cause the Jews persecuted
Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> But Jesus answered them, My Father
worketh even until now, and I work.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> For this cause therefore the Jews sought
the more to kill him, because he not only brake the sabbath, but also
called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> Jesus therefore answered and said unto
them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself,
but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doeth,
these the Son also doeth in like manner.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> For the Father loveth the Son, and
showeth him all things that himself doeth: and greater works than these
will he show him, that ye may marvel.

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> For as the Father raiseth the dead and
giveth them life, even so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> For neither doth the Father judge any
man, but he hath given all judgment unto the Son;

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> that all may honor the Son, even as they
honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father
that sent him.

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that
heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life, and
cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into life.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour
cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of
God; and they that hear shall live.

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> For as the Father hath life in himself,
even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself:

<span id="an_5:27">5:27</span> and he gave him authority to execute
judgment, because he is a son of man.

<span id="an_5:28">5:28</span> Marvel not at this: for the hour cometh,
in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice,

<span id="an_5:29">5:29</span> and shall come forth; they that have done
good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto
the resurrection of judgment.

<span id="an_5:30">5:30</span> I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I
judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I seek not mine own will,
but the will of him that sent me.

<span id="an_5:31">5:31</span> If I bear witness of myself, my witness
is not true.

<span id="an_5:32">5:32</span> It is another that beareth witness of me;
and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.

<span id="an_5:33">5:33</span> Ye have sent unto John, and he hath borne
witness unto the truth.

<span id="an_5:34">5:34</span> But the witness which I receive is not
from man: howbeit I say these things, that ye may be saved.

<span id="an_5:35">5:35</span> He was the lamp that burneth and shineth;
and ye were willing to rejoice for a season in his light.

<span id="an_5:36">5:36</span> But the witness which I have is greater
than \[that of\] John; for the works which the Father hath given me to
accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the
Father hath sent me.

<span id="an_5:37">5:37</span> And the Father that sent me, he hath
borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor
seen his form.

<span id="an_5:38">5:38</span> And ye have not his word abiding in you:
for whom he sent, him ye believe not.

<span id="an_5:39">5:39</span> Ye search the scriptures, because ye
think that in them ye have eternal life; and these are they which bear
witness of me;

<span id="an_5:40">5:40</span> and ye will not come to me, that ye may
have life.

<span id="an_5:41">5:41</span> I receive not glory from men.

<span id="an_5:42">5:42</span> But I know you, that ye have not the love
of God in yourselves.

<span id="an_5:43">5:43</span> I am come in my Father's name, and ye
receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will
receive.

<span id="an_5:44">5:44</span> How can ye believe, who receive glory one
of another, and the glory that \[cometh\] from the only God ye seek not?

<span id="an_5:45">5:45</span> Think not that I will accuse you to the
Father: there is one that accuseth you, \[even\] Moses, on whom ye have
set your hope.

<span id="an_5:46">5:46</span> For if ye believed Moses, ye would
believe me; for he wrote of me.

<span id="an_5:47">5:47</span> But if ye believe not his writings, how
shall ye believe my words?

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> After these things Jesus went away to the
other side of the sea of Galilee, which is \[the sea\] of Tiberias.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> And a great multitude followed him, because
they beheld the signs which he did on them that were sick.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> And Jesus went up into the mountain, and
there he sat with his disciples.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> Now the passover, the feast of the Jews,
was at hand.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and
seeing that a great multitude cometh unto him, saith unto Philip, Whence
are we to buy bread, that these may eat?

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> And this he said to prove him: for he
himself knew what he would do.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> Philip answered him, Two hundred shillings'
worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one may take a
little.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's
brother, saith unto him,

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> There is a lad here, who hath five barley
loaves, and two fishes: but what are these among so many?

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> Jesus said, Make the people sit down. Now
there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about
five thousand.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> Jesus therefore took the loaves; and
having given thanks, he distributed to them that were set down; likewise
also of the fishes as much as they would.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> And when they were filled, he saith unto
his disciples, Gather up the broken pieces which remain over, that
nothing be lost.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> So they gathered them up, and filled
twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which
remained over unto them that had eaten.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> When therefore the people saw the sign
which he did, they said, This is of a truth the prophet that cometh into
the world.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> Jesus therefore perceiving that they were
about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again
into the mountain himself alone.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> And when evening came, his disciples went
down unto the sea;

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> and they entered into a boat, and were
going over the sea unto Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had
not yet come to them.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> And the sea was rising by reason of a
great wind that blew.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> When therefore they had rowed about five
and twenty or thirty furlongs, they behold Jesus walking on the sea, and
drawing nigh unto the boat: and they were afraid.

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> But he saith unto them, It is I; be not
afraid.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> They were willing therefore to receive
him into the boat: and straightway the boat was at the land whither they
were going.

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> On the morrow the multitude that stood on
the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, save
one, and that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the boat, but
\[that\] his disciples went away alone

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> (howbeit there came boats from Tiberias
nigh unto the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given
thanks):

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> when the multitude therefore saw that
Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they themselves got into the
boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> And when they found him on the other side
of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> Jesus answered them and said, Verily,
verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but
because ye ate of the loaves, and were filled.

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> Work not for the food which perisheth,
but for the food which abideth unto eternal life, which the Son of man
shall give unto you: for him the Father, even God, hath sealed.

<span id="an_6:28">6:28</span> They said therefore unto him, What must
we do, that we may work the works of God?

<span id="an_6:29">6:29</span> Jesus answered and said unto them, This
is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.

<span id="an_6:30">6:30</span> They said therefore unto him, What then
doest thou for a sign, that we may see, and believe thee? what workest
thou?

<span id="an_6:31">6:31</span> Our fathers ate the manna in the
wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.

<span id="an_6:32">6:32</span> Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily,
verily, I say unto you, It was not Moses that gave you the bread out of
heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread out of heaven.

<span id="an_6:33">6:33</span> For the bread of God is that which cometh
down out of heaven, and giveth life unto the world.

<span id="an_6:34">6:34</span> They said therefore unto him, Lord,
evermore give us this bread.

<span id="an_6:35">6:35</span> Jesus said unto them. I am the bread of
life: he that cometh to me shall not hunger, and he that believeth on me
shall never thirst.

<span id="an_6:36">6:36</span> But I said unto you, that ye have seen
me, and yet believe not.

<span id="an_6:37">6:37</span> All that which the Father giveth me shall
come unto me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.

<span id="an_6:38">6:38</span> For I am come down from heaven, not to do
mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.

<span id="an_6:39">6:39</span> And this is the will of him that sent me,
that of all that which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but
should raise it up at the last day.

<span id="an_6:40">6:40</span> For this is the will of my Father, that
every one that beholdeth the Son, and believeth on him, should have
eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.

<span id="an_6:41">6:41</span> The Jews therefore murmured concerning
him, because he said, I am the bread which came down out of heaven.

<span id="an_6:42">6:42</span> And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son
of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how doth he now say, I am
come down out of heaven?

<span id="an_6:43">6:43</span> Jesus answered and said unto them, Murmur
not among yourselves.

<span id="an_6:44">6:44</span> No man can come to me, except the Father
that sent me draw him: and I will raise him up in the last day.

<span id="an_6:45">6:45</span> It is written in the prophets, And they
shall all be taught of God. Every one that hath heard from the Father,
and hath learned, cometh unto me.

<span id="an_6:46">6:46</span> Not that any man hath seen the Father,
save he that is from God, he hath seen the Father.

<span id="an_6:47">6:47</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that
believeth hath eternal life.

<span id="an_6:48">6:48</span> I am the bread of life.

<span id="an_6:49">6:49</span> Your fathers ate the manna in the
wilderness, and they died.

<span id="an_6:50">6:50</span> This is the bread which cometh down out
of heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.

<span id="an_6:51">6:51</span> I am the living bread which came down out
of heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: yea and
the bread which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world.

<span id="an_6:52">6:52</span> The Jews therefore strove one with
another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?

<span id="an_6:53">6:53</span> Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily,
verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and
drink his blood, ye have not life in yourselves.

<span id="an_6:54">6:54</span> He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
blood hath eternal life: and I will raise him up at the last day.

<span id="an_6:55">6:55</span> For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood
is drink indeed.

<span id="an_6:56">6:56</span> He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
blood abideth in me, and I in him.

<span id="an_6:57">6:57</span> As the living Father sent me, and I live
because of the Father; so he that eateth me, he also shall live because
of me.

<span id="an_6:58">6:58</span> This is the bread which came down out of
heaven: not as the fathers ate, and died; he that eateth this bread
shall live for ever.

<span id="an_6:59">6:59</span> These things said he in the synagogue, as
he taught in Capernaum.

<span id="an_6:60">6:60</span> Many therefore of his disciples, when the
heard \[this\], said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it?

<span id="an_6:61">6:61</span> But Jesus knowing in himself that his
disciples murmured at this, said unto them, Doth this cause you to
stumble?

<span id="an_6:62">6:62</span> \[What\] then if ye should behold the Son
of man ascending where he was before?

<span id="an_6:63">6:63</span> It is the spirit that giveth life; the
flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I have spoken unto you are
spirit, are are life.

<span id="an_6:64">6:64</span> But there are some of you that believe
not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not,
and who it was that should betray him.

<span id="an_6:65">6:65</span> And he said, For this cause have I said
unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it be given unto him of
the Father.

<span id="an_6:66">6:66</span> Upon this many of his disciples went
back, and walked no more with him.

<span id="an_6:67">6:67</span> Jesus said therefore unto the twelve,
Would ye also go away?

<span id="an_6:68">6:68</span> Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom
shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.

<span id="an_6:69">6:69</span> And we have believed and know that thou
art the Holy One of God.

<span id="an_6:70">6:70</span> Jesus answered them, Did not I choose you
the twelve, and one of you is a devil?

<span id="an_6:71">6:71</span> Now he spake of Judas \[the son\] of
Simon Iscariot, for he it was that should betray him, \[being\] one of
the twelve.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> And after these things Jesus walked in
Galilee: for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to
kill him.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of
tabernacles, was at hand.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> His brethren therefore said unto him,
Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may behold thy
works which thou doest.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> For no man doeth anything in secret, and
himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, manifest
thyself to the world.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> For even his brethren did not believe on
him.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> Jesus therefore saith unto them, My time is
not yet come; but your time is always ready.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> The world cannot hate you; but me it
hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> Go ye up unto the feast: I go not up unto
this feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> And having said these things unto them, he
abode \[still\] in Galilee.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> But when his brethren were gone up unto
the feast, then went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> The Jews therefore sought him at the
feast, and said, Where is he?

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> And there was much murmuring among the
multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not
so, but he leadeth the multitude astray.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> Yet no man spake openly of him for fear
of the Jews.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> But when it was now the midst of the
feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> The Jews therefore marvelled, saying, How
knoweth this man letters, having never learned?

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> Jesus therefore answered them and said,
My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> If any man willeth to do his will, he
shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or \[whether\] I speak
from myself.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> He that speaketh from himself seeketh his
own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same
is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> Did not Moses give you the law, and
\[yet\] none of you doeth the law? Why seek ye to kill me?

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> The multitude answered, Thou hast a
demon: who seeketh to kill thee?

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> Jesus answered and said unto them, I did
one work, and ye all marvel because thereof.

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> Moses hath given you circumcision (not
that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath ye
circumcise a man.

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> If a man receiveth circumcision on the
sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye wroth with me,
because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath?

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> Judge not according to appearance, but
judge righteous judgment.

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said,
Is not this he whom they seek to kill?

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say
nothing unto him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the
Christ?

<span id="an_7:27">7:27</span> Howbeit we know this man whence he is:
but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is.

<span id="an_7:28">7:28</span> Jesus therefore cried in the temple,
teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I am; and I am not
come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.

<span id="an_7:29">7:29</span> I know him; because I am from him, and he
sent me.

<span id="an_7:30">7:30</span> They sought therefore to take him: and no
man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.

<span id="an_7:31">7:31</span> But of the multitude many believed on
him; and they said, When the Christ shall come, will he do more signs
than those which this man hath done?

<span id="an_7:32">7:32</span> The Pharisees heard the multitude
murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the
Pharisees sent officers to take him.

<span id="an_7:33">7:33</span> Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while
am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me.

<span id="an_7:34">7:34</span> Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me:
and where I am, ye cannot come.

<span id="an_7:35">7:35</span> The Jews therefore said among themselves,
Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? will he go unto the
Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?

<span id="an_7:36">7:36</span> What is this word that he said, Ye shall
seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come?

<span id="an_7:37">7:37</span> Now on the last day, the great \[day\] of
the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him
come unto me and drink.

<span id="an_7:38">7:38</span> He that believeth on me, as the scripture
hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water.

<span id="an_7:39">7:39</span> But this spake he of the Spirit, which
they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet
\[given\]; because Jesus was not yet glorified.

<span id="an_7:40">7:40</span> \[Some\] of the multitude therefore, when
they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet.

<span id="an_7:41">7:41</span> Others said, This is the Christ. But some
said, What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee?

<span id="an_7:42">7:42</span> Hath not the scripture said that the
Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village
where David was?

<span id="an_7:43">7:43</span> So there arose a division in the
multitude because of him.

<span id="an_7:44">7:44</span> And some of them would have taken him;
but no man laid hands on him.

<span id="an_7:45">7:45</span> The officers therefore came to the chief
priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring
him?

<span id="an_7:46">7:46</span> The officers answered, Never man so
spake.

<span id="an_7:47">7:47</span> The Pharisees therefore answered them,
Are ye also led astray?

<span id="an_7:48">7:48</span> Hath any of the rulers believed on him,
or of the Pharisees?

<span id="an_7:49">7:49</span> But this multitude that knoweth not the
law are accursed.

<span id="an_7:50">7:50</span> Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came
to him before, being one of them),

<span id="an_7:51">7:51</span> Doth our law judge a man, except it first
hear from himself and know what he doeth?

<span id="an_7:52">7:52</span> They answered and said unto him, Art thou
also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.

<span id="an_7:53">7:53</span> And they went every man unto his own
house:

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> but Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> And early in the morning he came again into
the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and
taught them.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a
woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst,

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> they say unto him, Teacher, this woman hath
been taken in adultery, in the very act.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone
such: what then sayest thou of her?

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> And this they said, trying him, that they
might have \[whereof\] to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with
his finger wrote on the ground.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> But when they continued asking him, he
lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you,
let him first cast a stone at her.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> And again he stooped down, and with his
finger wrote on the ground.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> And they, when they heard it, went out one
by one, beginning from the eldest, \[even\] unto the last: and Jesus was
left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> And Jesus lifted up himself, and said
unto her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee?

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus
said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from henceforth sin no
more.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> Again therefore Jesus spake unto them,
saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk
in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> The Pharisees therefore said unto him,
Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> Jesus answered and said unto them, Even
if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I
came, and whither I go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> Yea and if I judge, my judgment is true;
for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> Yea and in your law it is written, that
the witness of two men is true.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> I am he that beareth witness of myself,
and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> They said therefore unto him, Where is
thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father: if ye
knew me, ye would know my Father also.

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> These words spake he in the treasury, as
he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not
yet come.

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> He said therefore again unto them, I go
away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye
cannot come.

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> The Jews therefore said, Will he kill
himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come?

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> And he said unto them, Ye are from
beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> I said therefore unto you, that ye shall
die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am \[he\], ye shall die
in your sins.

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> They said therefore unto him, Who art
thou? Jesus said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you
from the beginning.

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> I have many things to speak and to judge
concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I
heard from him, these speak I unto the world.

<span id="an_8:27">8:27</span> They perceived not that he spake to them
of the Father.

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted
up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am \[he\], and \[that\] I
do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> And he that sent me is with me; he hath
not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him.

<span id="an_8:30">8:30</span> As he spake these things, many believed
on him.

<span id="an_8:31">8:31</span> Jesus therefore said to those Jews that
had believed him, If ye abide in my word, \[then\] are ye truly my
disciples;

<span id="an_8:32">8:32</span> and ye shall know the truth, and the
truth shall make you free.

<span id="an_8:33">8:33</span> They answered unto him, We are Abraham's
seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye
shall be made free?

<span id="an_8:34">8:34</span> Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I
say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin.

<span id="an_8:35">8:35</span> And the bondservant abideth not in the
house for ever: the son abideth for ever.

<span id="an_8:36">8:36</span> If therefore the Son shall make you free,
ye shall be free indeed.

<span id="an_8:37">8:37</span> I know that ye are Abraham's seed: yet ye
seek to kill me, because my word hath not free course in you.

<span id="an_8:38">8:38</span> I speak the things which I have seen with
\[my\] Father: and ye also do the things which ye heard from \[your\]
father.

<span id="an_8:39">8:39</span> They answered and said unto him, Our
father is Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children,
ye would do the works of Abraham.

<span id="an_8:40">8:40</span> But now ye seek to kill me, a man that
hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham.

<span id="an_8:41">8:41</span> Ye do the works of your father. They said
unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, \[even\]
God.

<span id="an_8:42">8:42</span> Jesus said unto them, If God were your
Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for
neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.

<span id="an_8:43">8:43</span> Why do ye not understand my speech?
\[Even\] because ye cannot hear my word.

<span id="an_8:44">8:44</span> Ye are of \[your\] father the devil, and
the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from
the beginning, and standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth
in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a
liar, and the father thereof.

<span id="an_8:45">8:45</span> But because I say the truth, ye believe
me not.

<span id="an_8:46">8:46</span> Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I
say truth, why do ye not believe me?

<span id="an_8:47">8:47</span> He that is of God heareth the words of
God: for this cause ye hear \[them\] not, because ye are not of God.

<span id="an_8:48">8:48</span> The Jews answered and said unto him, Say
we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?

<span id="an_8:49">8:49</span> Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I
honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.

<span id="an_8:50">8:50</span> But I seek not mine own glory: there is
one that seeketh and judgeth.

<span id="an_8:51">8:51</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man
keep my word, he shall never see death.

<span id="an_8:52">8:52</span> The Jews said unto him, Now we know that
thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a
man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.

<span id="an_8:53">8:53</span> Art thou greater than our father Abraham,
who died? and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself?

<span id="an_8:54">8:54</span> Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my
glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say,
that he is your God;

<span id="an_8:55">8:55</span> and ye have not known him: but I know
him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a
liar: but I know him, and keep his word.

<span id="an_8:56">8:56</span> Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my
day; and he saw it, and was glad.

<span id="an_8:57">8:57</span> The Jews therefore said unto him, Thou
art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?

<span id="an_8:58">8:58</span> Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I
say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I am.

<span id="an_8:59">8:59</span> They took up stones therefore to cast at
him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> And as he passed by, he saw a man blind
from his birth.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi,
who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin,
nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in
him.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> We must work the works of him that sent me,
while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> When I am in the world, I am the light of
the world.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> When he had thus spoken, he spat on the
ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the
clay,

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of
Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went away therefore, and
washed, and came seeing.

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> The neighbors therefore, and they that saw
him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and
begged?

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> Others said, It is he: others said, No, but
he is like him. He said, I am \[he\].

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> They said therefore unto him, How then
were thine eyes opened?

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> He answered, The man that is called Jesus
made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and
wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> And they said unto him, Where is he? He
saith, I know not.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> They bring to the Pharisees him that
aforetime was blind.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> Now it was the sabbath on the day when
Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> Again therefore the Pharisees also asked
him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon
mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> Some therefore of the Pharisees said,
This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others
said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was
division among them.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> They say therefore unto the blind man
again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he
said, He is a prophet.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> The Jews therefore did not believe
concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight,
until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> and asked them, saying, Is this your son,
who ye say was born blind? How then doth he now see?

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> His parents answered and said, We know
that this is our son, and that he was born blind:

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> but how he now seeth, we know not; or who
opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for
himself.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> These things said his parents, because
they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man
should confess him \[to be\] Christ, he should be put out of the
synagogue.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> Therefore said his parents, He is of age;
ask him.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> So they called a second time the man that
was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man
is a sinner.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> He therefore answered, Whether he is a
sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I
see.

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> They said therefore unto him, What did he
to thee? How opened he thine eyes?

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> He answered them, I told you even now,
and ye did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also
become his disciples?

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> And they reviled him, and said, Thou art
his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> We know that God hath spoken unto Moses:
but as for this man, we know not whence he is.

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> The man answered and said unto them, Why,
herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and \[yet\] he
opened mine eyes.

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> We know that God heareth not sinners: but
if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth.

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> Since the world began it was never heard
that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind.

<span id="an_9:33">9:33</span> If this man were not from God, he could
do nothing.

<span id="an_9:34">9:34</span> They answered and said unto him, Thou
wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him
out.

<span id="an_9:35">9:35</span> Jesus heard that they had cast him out;
and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?

<span id="an_9:36">9:36</span> He answered and said, And who is he,
Lord, that I may believe on him?

<span id="an_9:37">9:37</span> Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen
him, and he it is that speaketh with thee.

<span id="an_9:38">9:38</span> And he said, Lord, I believe. And he
worshipped him.

<span id="an_9:39">9:39</span> And Jesus said, For judgment came I into
this world, that they that see not may see; and that they that see may
become blind.

<span id="an_9:40">9:40</span> Those of the Pharisees who were with him
heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind?

<span id="an_9:41">9:41</span> Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind,
ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that
entereth not by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbeth up
some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> But he that entereth in by the door is
the shepherd of the sheep.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> To him the porter openeth; and the sheep
hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them
out.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> When he hath put forth all his own, he
goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> And a stranger will they not follow, but
will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> This parable spake Jesus unto them: but
they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> Jesus therefore said unto them again,
Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> All that came before me are thieves and
robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> I am the door; by me if any man enter in,
he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out, and shall find pasture.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> The thief cometh not, but that he may
steal, and kill, and destroy: I came that they may have life, and may
have \[it\] abundantly.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> I am the good shepherd: the good
shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> He that is a hireling, and not a
shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, beholdeth the wolf coming, and
leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, and the wolf snatcheth them, and
scattereth \[them\]:

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> \[he fleeth\] because he is a hireling,
and careth not for the sheep.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> I am the good shepherd; and I know mine
own, and mine own know me,

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> even as the Father knoweth me, and I
know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> And other sheep I have, which are not
of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice: and
they shall become one flock, one shepherd.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> Therefore doth the Father love me,
because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> No one taketh it away from me, but I
lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to
take it again. This commandment received I from my Father.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> There arose a division again among the
Jews because of these words.

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> And many of them said, He hath a demon,
and is mad; why hear ye him?

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> Others said, These are not the sayings
of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> And it was the feast of the dedication
at Jerusalem:

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> it was winter; and Jesus was walking in
the temple in Solomon's porch.

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> The Jews therefore came round about
him, and said unto him, How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou
art the Christ, tell us plainly.

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye
believe not: the works that I do in my Father's name, these bear witness
of me.

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> But ye believe not, because ye are not
of my sheep.

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> My sheep hear my voice, and I know
them, and they follow me:

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> and I give unto them eternal life; and
they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> My Father, who hath given \[them\] unto
me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch \[them\] out of
the Father's hand.

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> I and the Father are one.

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> The Jews took up stones again to stone
him.

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> Jesus answered them, Many good works
have I showed you from the Father; for which of those works do ye stone
me?

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> The Jews answered him, For a good work
we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a
man, makest thyself God.

<span id="an_10:34">10:34</span> Jesus answered them, Is it not written
in your law, I said, ye are gods?

<span id="an_10:35">10:35</span> If he called them gods, unto whom the
word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),

<span id="an_10:36">10:36</span> say ye of him, whom the Father
sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I
am \[the\] Son of God?

<span id="an_10:37">10:37</span> If I do not the works of my Father,
believe me not.

<span id="an_10:38">10:38</span> But if I do them, though ye believe not
me, believe the works: that ye may know and understand that the Father
is in me, and I in the Father.

<span id="an_10:39">10:39</span> They sought again to take him: and he
went forth out of their hand.

<span id="an_10:40">10:40</span> And he went away again beyond the
Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing; and there
be abode.

<span id="an_10:41">10:41</span> And many came unto him; and they said,
John indeed did no sign: but all things whatsoever John spake of this
man were true.

<span id="an_10:42">10:42</span> And many believed on him there.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of
Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> And it was that Mary who anointed the
Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother
Lazarus was sick.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> The sisters therefore sent unto him,
saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> But when Jesus heard it, he said, This
sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of
God may be glorified thereby.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister,
and Lazarus.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> When therefore he heard that he was sick,
he abode at that time two days in the place where he was.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> Then after this he saith to the
disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> The disciples say unto him, Rabbi, the
Jews were but now seeking to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> Jesus answered, Are there not twelve
hours in the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he
seeth the light of this world.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> But if a man walk in the night, he
stumbleth, because the light is not in him.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> These things spake he: and after this
he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep; but I go, that
I may awake him out of sleep.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> The disciples therefore said unto him,
Lord, if he is fallen asleep, he will recover.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but
they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> Then Jesus therefore said unto them
plainly, Lazarus is dead.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> And I am glad for your sakes that I was
not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto
him.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> Thomas therefore, who is called
Didymus, said unto his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die
with him.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> So when Jesus came, he found that he
had been in the tomb four days already.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem,
about fifteen furlongs off;

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> and many of the Jews had come to Martha
and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> Martha therefore, when she heard that
Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary still sat in the house.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> Martha therefore said unto Jesus, Lord,
if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> And even now I know that, whatsoever
thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall
rise again.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> Martha saith unto him, I know that he
shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> Jesus said unto her, I am the
resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, though he die, yet
shall he live;

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> and whosoever liveth and believeth on
me shall never die. Believest thou this?

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I have
believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, \[even\] he that
cometh into the world.

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> And when she had said this, she went
away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is her,
and calleth thee.

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> And she, when she heard it, arose
quickly, and went unto him.

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> (Now Jesus was not yet come into the
village, but was still in the place where Martha met him.)

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> The Jews then who were with her in the
house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up
quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going unto
the tomb to weep there.

<span id="an_11:32">11:32</span> Mary therefore, when she came where
Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if
thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.

<span id="an_11:33">11:33</span> When Jesus therefore saw her weeping,
and the Jews \[also\] weeping who came with her, he groaned in the
spirit, and was troubled,

<span id="an_11:34">11:34</span> and said, Where have ye laid him? They
say unto him, Lord, come and see.

<span id="an_11:35">11:35</span> Jesus wept.

<span id="an_11:36">11:36</span> The Jews therefore said, Behold how he
loved him!

<span id="an_11:37">11:37</span> But some of them said, Could not this
man, who opened the eyes of him that was blind, have caused that this
man also should not die?

<span id="an_11:38">11:38</span> Jesus therefore again groaning in
himself cometh to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against
it.

<span id="an_11:39">11:39</span> Jesus saith, Take ye away the stone.
Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this
time the body decayeth; for he hath been \[dead\] four days.

<span id="an_11:40">11:40</span> Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto
thee, that, if thou believedst, thou shouldest see the glory of God?

<span id="an_11:41">11:41</span> So they took away the stone. And Jesus
lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heardest
me.

<span id="an_11:42">11:42</span> And I knew that thou hearest me always:
but because of the multitude that standeth around I said it, that they
may believe that thou didst send me.

<span id="an_11:43">11:43</span> And when he had thus spoken, he cried
with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.

<span id="an_11:44">11:44</span> He that was dead came forth, bound hand
and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin.
Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.

<span id="an_11:45">11:45</span> Many therefore of the Jews, who came to
Mary and beheld that which he did, believed on him.

<span id="an_11:46">11:46</span> But some of them went away to the
Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.

<span id="an_11:47">11:47</span> The chief priests therefore and the
Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth
many signs.

<span id="an_11:48">11:48</span> If we let him thus alone, all men will
believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away both our place
and our nation.

<span id="an_11:49">11:49</span> But a certain one of them, Caiaphas,
being high priest that year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,

<span id="an_11:50">11:50</span> nor do ye take account that it is
expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the
whole nation perish not.

<span id="an_11:51">11:51</span> Now this he said not of himself: but,
being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the
nation;

<span id="an_11:52">11:52</span> and not for the nation only, but that
he might also gather together into one the children of God that are
scattered abroad.

<span id="an_11:53">11:53</span> So from that day forth they took
counsel that they might put him to death.

<span id="an_11:54">11:54</span> Jesus therefore walked no more openly
among the Jews, but departed thence into the country near to the
wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there he tarried with the
disciples.

<span id="an_11:55">11:55</span> Now the passover of the Jews was at
hand: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the
passover, to purify themselves.

<span id="an_11:56">11:56</span> They sought therefore for Jesus, and
spake one with another, as they stood in the temple, What think ye? That
he will not come to the feast?

<span id="an_11:57">11:57</span> Now the chief priests and the Pharisees
had given commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should
show it, that they might take him.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> Jesus therefore six days before the
passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the
dead.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> So they made him a supper there: and
Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> Mary therefore took a pound of ointment
of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped
his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the
ointment.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples,
that should betray him, saith,

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> Why was not this ointment sold for three
hundred shillings, and given to the poor?

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> Now this he said, not because he cared
for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the bag took away
what was put therein.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to keep
it against the day of my burying.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> For the poor ye have always with you; but
me ye have not always.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> The common people therefore of the Jews
learned that he was there: and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but
that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> But the chief priests took counsel that
they might put Lazarus also to death;

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> because that by reason of him many of
the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> On the morrow a great multitude that
had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to
Jerusalem,

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> took the branches of the palm trees,
and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed \[is\] he
that cometh in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> And Jesus, having found a young ass,
sat thereon; as it is written,

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy
King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> These things understood not his
disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered
they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these
things unto him.

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> The multitude therefore that was with
him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the
dead, bare witness.

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> For this cause also the multitude went
and met him, for that they heard that he had done this sign.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> The Pharisees therefore said among
themselves, Behold how ye prevail nothing: lo, the world is gone after
him.

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> Now there were certain Greeks among
those that went up to worship at the feast:

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> these therefore came to Philip, who was
of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> Philip cometh and telleth Andrew:
Andrew cometh, and Philip, and they tell Jesus.

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> And Jesus answereth them, saying, The
hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except
a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by itself
alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit.

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> He that loveth his life loseth it; and
he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> If any man serve me, let him follow me;
and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him
will the Father honor.

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> Now is my soul troubled; and what shall
I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto
this hour.

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> Father, glorify thy name. There came
therefore a voice out of heaven, \[saying\], I have both glorified it,
and will glorify it again.

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> The multitude therefore, that stood by,
and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath
spoken to him.

<span id="an_12:30">12:30</span> Jesus answered and said, This voice
hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes.

<span id="an_12:31">12:31</span> Now is the judgment of this world: now
shall the prince of this world be cast out.

<span id="an_12:32">12:32</span> And I, if I be lifted up from the
earth, will draw all men unto myself.

<span id="an_12:33">12:33</span> But this he said, signifying by what
manner of death he should die.

<span id="an_12:34">12:34</span> The multitude therefore answered him,
We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how
sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?

<span id="an_12:35">12:35</span> Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a
little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that
darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth
not whither he goeth.

<span id="an_12:36">12:36</span> While ye have the light, believe on the
light, that ye may become sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and
he departed and hid himself from them.

<span id="an_12:37">12:37</span> But though he had done so many signs
before them, yet they believed not on him:

<span id="an_12:38">12:38</span> that the word of Isaiah the prophet
might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report?
And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?

<span id="an_12:39">12:39</span> For this cause they could not believe,
for that Isaiah said again,

<span id="an_12:40">12:40</span> He hath blinded their eyes, and he
hardened their heart; Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive
with their heart, And should turn, And I should heal them.

<span id="an_12:41">12:41</span> These things said Isaiah, because he
saw his glory; and he spake of him.

<span id="an_12:42">12:42</span> Nevertheless even of the rulers many
believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess
\[it\], lest they should be put out of the synagogue:

<span id="an_12:43">12:43</span> for they loved the glory \[that is\] of
men more than the glory \[that is\] of God.

<span id="an_12:44">12:44</span> And Jesus cried and said, He that
believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.

<span id="an_12:45">12:45</span> And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him
that sent me.

<span id="an_12:46">12:46</span> I am come a light into the world, that
whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness.

<span id="an_12:47">12:47</span> And if any man hear my sayings, and
keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but
to save the world.

<span id="an_12:48">12:48</span> He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not
my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same
shall judge him in the last day.

<span id="an_12:49">12:49</span> For I spake not from myself; but the
Father that sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say,
and what I should speak.

<span id="an_12:50">12:50</span> And I know that his commandment is life
eternal: the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath
said unto me, so I speak.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> Now before the feast of the passover,
Jesus knowing that his hour was come that he should depart out of this
world unto his Father, having loved his own that were in the world, he
loved them unto the end.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> And during supper, the devil having
already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's \[son\], to betray
him,

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> \[Jesus\], knowing that the Father had
given all the things into his hands, and that he came forth from God,
and goeth unto God,

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> riseth from supper, and layeth aside his
garments; and he took a towel, and girded himself.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> Then he poureth water into the basin, and
began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel
wherewith he was girded.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> So he cometh to Simon Peter. He saith
unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> Jesus answered and said unto him, What I
do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt understand hereafter.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never
wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part
with me.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my
feet only, but also my hands and my head.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> Jesus saith to him, He that is bathed
needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are
clean, but not all.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> For he knew him that should betray him;
therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> So when he had washed their feet, and
taken his garments, and sat down again, he said unto them, Know ye what
I have done to you?

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> Ye call me, Teacher, and, Lord: and ye
say well; for so I am.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> If I then, the Lord and the Teacher,
have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet.

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> For I have given you an example, that
ye also should do as I have done to you.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, a
servant is not greater than his lord; neither one that is sent greater
than he that sent him.

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> If ye know these things, blessed are ye
if ye do them.

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> I speak not of you all: I know whom I
have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled: He that eateth my
bread lifted up his heel against me.

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> From henceforth I tell you before it
come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am
\[he\].

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that
receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me
receiveth him that sent me.

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> When Jesus had thus said, he was
troubled in the spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say
unto you, that one of you shall betray me.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> The disciples looked one on another,
doubting of whom he spake.

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> There was at the table reclining in
Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him,
and saith unto him, Tell \[us\] who it is of whom he speaketh.

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> He leaning back, as he was, on Jesus'
breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?

<span id="an_13:26">13:26</span> Jesus therefore answereth, He it is,
for whom I shall dip the sop, and give it him. So when he had dipped the
sop, he taketh and giveth it to Judas, \[the son\] of Simon Iscariot.

<span id="an_13:27">13:27</span> And after the sop, then entered Satan
into him. Jesus therefore saith unto him, What thou doest, do quickly.

<span id="an_13:28">13:28</span> Now no man at the table knew for what
intent he spake this unto him.

<span id="an_13:29">13:29</span> For some thought, because Judas had the
bag, that Jesus said unto him, Buy what things we have need of for the
feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.

<span id="an_13:30">13:30</span> He then having received the sop went
out straightway: and it was night.

<span id="an_13:31">13:31</span> When therefore he was gone out, Jesus
saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him;

<span id="an_13:32">13:32</span> and God shall glorify him in himself,
and straightway shall he glorify him.

<span id="an_13:33">13:33</span> Little children, yet a little while I
am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I
go, ye cannot come; so now I say unto you.

<span id="an_13:34">13:34</span> A new commandment I give unto you, that
ye love one another; even as I have loved you, that ye also love one
another.

<span id="an_13:35">13:35</span> By this shall all men know that ye are
my disciples, if ye have love one to another.

<span id="an_13:36">13:36</span> Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord,
whither goest thou? Jesus answered, Whither I go, thou canst not follow
now; but thou shalt follow afterwards.

<span id="an_13:37">13:37</span> Peter saith unto him, Lord, why cannot
I follow thee even now? I will lay down my life for thee.

<span id="an_13:38">13:38</span> Jesus answereth, Wilt thou lay down thy
life for me? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow,
till thou hast denied me thrice.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> Let not your heart be troubled: believe
in God, believe also in me.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> In my Father's house are many mansions;
if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place
for you.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> And if I go and prepare a place for you,
I come again, and will receive you unto myself; that where I am,
\[there\] ye may be also.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> And whither I go, ye know the way.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not
whither thou goest; how know we the way?

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, and
the truth, and the life: no one cometh unto the Father, but by me.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> If ye had known me, ye would have known
my Father also: from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the
Father, and it sufficeth us.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long
time with you, and dost thou not know me, Philip? he that hath seen me
hath seen the Father; how sayest thou, Show us the Father?

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> Believest thou not that I am in the
Father, and the Father in me? the words that I say unto you I speak not
from myself: but the Father abiding in me doeth his works.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> Believe me that I am in the Father, and
the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that
believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater
\[works\] than these shall he do; because I go unto the Father.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name,
that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> If ye shall ask anything in my name,
that will I do.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> If ye love me, ye will keep my
commandments.

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> And I will pray the Father, and he
shall give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever,

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> \[even\] the Spirit of truth: whom the
world cannot receive; for it beholdeth him not, neither knoweth him: ye
know him; for he abideth with you, and shall be in you.

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> I will not leave you desolate: I come
unto you.

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> Yet a little while, and the world
beholdeth me no more; but ye behold me: because I live, ye shall live
also.

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> In that day ye shall know that I am in
my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> He that hath my commandments, and
keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be
loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself unto
him.

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> Judas (not Iscariot) saith unto him,
Lord, what is come to pass that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and
not unto the world?

<span id="an_14:23">14:23</span> Jesus answered and said unto him, If a
man love me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we
will come unto him, and make our abode with him.

<span id="an_14:24">14:24</span> He that loveth me not keepeth not my
words: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent
me.

<span id="an_14:25">14:25</span> These things have I spoken unto you,
while \[yet\] abiding with you.

<span id="an_14:26">14:26</span> But the Comforter, \[even\] the Holy
Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all
things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said unto you.

<span id="an_14:27">14:27</span> Peace I leave with you; my peace I give
unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart
be troubled, neither let it be fearful.

<span id="an_14:28">14:28</span> Ye heard how I said to you, I go away,
and I come unto you. If ye loved me, ye would have rejoiced, because I
go unto the Father: for the Father is greater than I.

<span id="an_14:29">14:29</span> And now I have told you before it come
to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe.

<span id="an_14:30">14:30</span> I will no more speak much with you, for
the prince of the world cometh: and he hath nothing in me;

<span id="an_14:31">14:31</span> but that the world may know that I love
the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise,
let us go hence.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> I am the true vine, and my Father is the
husbandman.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> Every branch in me that beareth not
fruit, he taketh it away: and every \[branch\] that beareth fruit, he
cleanseth it, that it may bear more fruit.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> Already ye are clean because of the word
which I have spoken unto you.

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch
cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; so neither can
ye, except ye abide in me.

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> I am the vine, ye are the branches: He
that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for apart
from me ye can do nothing.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> If a man abide not in me, he is cast
forth as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, and cast them
into the fire, and they are burned.

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> If ye abide in me, and my words abide in
you, ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done unto you.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> Herein is my Father glorified, that ye
bear much fruit; and \[so\] shall ye be my disciples.

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> Even as the Father hath loved me, I also
have loved you: abide ye in my love.

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> If ye keep my commandments, ye shall
abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and
abide in his love.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> These things have I spoken unto you,
that my joy may be in you, and \[that\] your joy may be made full.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> This is my commandment, that ye love
one another, even as I have loved you.

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> Greater love hath no man than this,
that a man lay down his life for his friends.

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> Ye are my friends, if ye do the things
which I command you.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> No longer do I call you servants; for
the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you
friends; for all things that I heard from my Father, I have made known
unto you.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> Ye did not choose me, but I chose you,
and appointed you, that ye should go and bear fruit, and \[that\] your
fruit should abide: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my
name, he may give it you.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> These things I command you, that ye may
love one another.

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> If the world hateth you, ye know that
it hath hated me before \[it hated\] you.

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> If ye were of the world, the world
would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I chose you
out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> Remember the word that I said unto you,
A servant is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, they will
also persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> But all these things will they do unto
you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> If I had not come and spoken unto them,
they had not had sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin.

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> He that hateth me hateth my Father
also.

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> If I had not done among them the works
which none other did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen
and hated both me and my Father.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> But \[this cometh to pass\], that the
word may be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me
without a cause.

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> But when the Comforter is come, whom I
will send unto you from the Father, \[even\] the Spirit of truth, which
proceedeth from the Father, he shall bear witness of me:

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> and ye also bear witness, because ye
have been with me from the beginning.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> These things have I spoken unto you, that
ye should not be caused to stumble.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> They shall put you out of the synagogues:
yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you shall think that he
offereth service unto God.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> And these things will they do, because
they have not known the Father, nor me.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> But these things have I spoken unto you,
that when their hour is come, ye may remember them, how that I told you.
And these things I said not unto you from the beginning, because I was
with you.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> But now I go unto him that sent me; and
none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> But because I have spoken these things
unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is
expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter
will not come unto you; but if I go, I will send him unto you.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> And he, when he is come, will convict the
world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> of sin, because they believe not on me;

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> of righteousness, because I go to the
Father, and ye behold me no more;

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> of judgment, because the prince of this
world hath been judged.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> I have yet many things to say unto you,
but ye cannot bear them now.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth,
is come, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak
from himself; but what things soever he shall hear, \[these\] shall he
speak: and he shall declare unto you the things that are to come.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> He shall glorify me: for he shall take
of mine, and shall declare \[it\] unto you.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> All things whatsoever the Father hath
are mine: therefore said I, that he taketh of mine, and shall declare
\[it\] unto you.

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> A little while, and ye behold me no
more; and again a little while, and ye shall see me.

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> \[Some\] of his disciples therefore
said one to another, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while,
and ye behold me not; and again a little while, and ye shall see me:
and, Because I go to the Father?

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> They said therefore, What is this that
he saith, A little while? We know not what he saith.

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> Jesus perceived that they were desirous
to ask him, and he said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves
concerning this, that I said, A little while, and ye behold me not, and
again a little while, and ye shall see me?

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye
shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: ye shall be
sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> A woman when she is in travail hath
sorrow, because her hour is come: but when she is delivered of the
child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for the joy that a man is
born into the world.

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> And ye therefore now have sorrow: but I
will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one
taketh away from you.

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> And in that day ye shall ask me no
question. Verily, verily, I say unto you, if ye shall ask anything of
the Father, he will give it you in my name.

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my
name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be made full.

<span id="an_16:25">16:25</span> These things have I spoken unto you in
dark sayings: the hour cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in
dark sayings, but shall tell you plainly of the Father.

<span id="an_16:26">16:26</span> In that day ye shall ask in my name:
and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you;

<span id="an_16:27">16:27</span> for the Father himself loveth you,
because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from the
Father.

<span id="an_16:28">16:28</span> I came out from the Father, and am come
into the world: again, I leave the world, and go unto the Father.

<span id="an_16:29">16:29</span> His disciples say, Lo, now speakest
thou plainly, and speakest no dark saying.

<span id="an_16:30">16:30</span> Now know we that thou knowest all
things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe
that thou camest forth from God.

<span id="an_16:31">16:31</span> Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?

<span id="an_16:32">16:32</span> Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is come,
that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me
alone: and \[yet\] I am not alone, because the Father is with me.

<span id="an_16:33">16:33</span> These things have I spoken unto you,
that in me ye may have peace. In the world ye have tribulation: but be
of good cheer; I have overcome the world.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> These things spake Jesus; and lifting up
his eyes to heaven, he said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son,
that the son may glorify thee:

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> even as thou gavest him authority over
all flesh, that to all whom thou hast given him, he should give eternal
life.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> And this is life eternal, that they
should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou didst send,
\[even\] Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> I glorified thee on the earth, having
accomplished the work which thou hast given me to do.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> And now, Father, glorify thou me with
thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world
was.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> I manifested thy name unto the men whom
thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them
to me; and they have kept thy word.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> Now they know that all things whatsoever
thou hast given me are from thee:

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> for the words which thou gavest me I have
given unto them; and they received \[them\], and knew of a truth that I
came forth from thee, and they believed that thou didst send me.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> I pray for them: I pray not for the
world, but for those whom thou hast given me; for they are thine:

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> and all things that are mine are thine,
and thine are mine: and I am glorified in them.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> And I am no more in the world, and
these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in
thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one, even as we
\[are\].

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> While I was with them, I kept them in
thy name which thou hast given me: and I guarded them, and not one of
them perished, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be
fulfilled.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> But now I come to thee; and these
things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy made full in
themselves.

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> I have given them thy word; and the
world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of
the world.

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> I pray not that thou shouldest take
them from the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil
\[one\].

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> They are not of the world even as I am
not of the world.

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> Sanctify them in the truth: thy word is
truth.

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> As thou didst send me into the world,
even so sent I them into the world.

<span id="an_17:19">17:19</span> And for their sakes I sanctify myself,
that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.

<span id="an_17:20">17:20</span> Neither for these only do I pray, but
for them also that believe on me through their word;

<span id="an_17:21">17:21</span> that they may all be one; even as thou,
Father, \[art\] in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us: that
the world may believe that thou didst send me.

<span id="an_17:22">17:22</span> And the glory which thou hast given me
I have given unto them; that they may be one, even as we \[are\] one;

<span id="an_17:23">17:23</span> I in them, and thou in me, that they
may be perfected into one; that the world may know that thou didst send
me, and lovedst them, even as thou lovedst me.

<span id="an_17:24">17:24</span> Father, I desire that they also whom
thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory,
which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of
the world.

<span id="an_17:25">17:25</span> O righteous Father, the world knew thee
not, but I knew thee; and these knew that thou didst send me;

<span id="an_17:26">17:26</span> and I made known unto them thy name,
and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be
in them, and I in them.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> When Jesus had spoken these words, he
went forth with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where was a garden,
into which he entered, himself and his disciples.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> Now Judas also, who betrayed him, knew
the place: for Jesus oft-times resorted thither with his disciples.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> Judas then, having received the band \[of
soldiers\], and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees,
cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> Jesus therefore, knowing all the things
that were coming upon him, went forth, and saith unto them, Whom seek
ye?

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth.
Jesus saith unto them, I am \[he\]. And Judas also, who betrayed him,
was standing with them.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> When therefore he said unto them, I am
\[he\], they went backward, and fell to the ground.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> Again therefore he asked them, Whom seek
ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> Jesus answered, I told you that I am
\[he\]; if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> that the word might be fulfilled which he
spake, Of those whom thou hast given me I lost not one.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> Simon Peter therefore having a sword
drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, and cut off his right
ear. Now the servant's name was Malchus.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> Jesus therefore said unto Peter, Put up
the sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father hath given me, shall
I not drink it?

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> So the band and the chief captain, and
the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> and led him to Annas first; for he was
father in law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> Now Caiaphas was he that gave counsel
to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the
people.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and
\[so did\] another disciple. Now that disciple was known unto the high
priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> but Peter was standing at the door
without. So the other disciple, who was known unto the high priest, went
out and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> The maid therefore that kept the door
saith unto Peter, Art thou also \[one\] of this man's disciples? He
saith, I am not.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> Now the servants and the officers were
standing \[there\], having made a fire of coals; for it was cold; and
they were warming themselves: and Peter also was with them, standing and
warming himself.

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> The high priest therefore asked Jesus
of his disciples, and of his teaching.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> Jesus answered him, I have spoken
openly to the world; I ever taught in synagogues, and in the temple,
where all the Jews come together; and in secret spake I nothing.

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> Why askest thou me? Ask them that have
heard \[me\], what I spake unto them: behold, these know the things
which I said.

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> And when he had said this, one of the
officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, Answerest thou
the high priest so?

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> Jesus answered him, If I have spoken
evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> Annas therefore sent him bound unto
Caiaphas the high priest.

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> Now Simon Peter was standing and
warming himself. They said therefore unto him, Art thou also \[one\] of
his disciples? He denied, and said, I am not.

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> One of the servants of the high priest,
being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see
thee in the garden with him?

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> Peter therefore denied again: and
straightway the cock crew.

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas
into the Praetorium: and it was early; and they themselves entered not
into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the
passover.

<span id="an_18:29">18:29</span> Pilate therefore went out unto them,
and saith, What accusation bring ye against this man?

<span id="an_18:30">18:30</span> They answered and said unto him, If
this man were not an evildoer, we should not have delivered him up unto
thee.

<span id="an_18:31">18:31</span> Pilate therefore said unto them, Take
him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said unto
him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:

<span id="an_18:32">18:32</span> that the word of Jesus might be
fulfilled, which he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should
die.

<span id="an_18:33">18:33</span> Pilate therefore entered again into the
Praetorium, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of
the Jews?

<span id="an_18:34">18:34</span> Jesus answered, Sayest thou this of
thyself, or did others tell it thee concerning me?

<span id="an_18:35">18:35</span> Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own
nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me: what hast thou
done?

<span id="an_18:36">18:36</span> Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of
this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants
fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom
not from hence.

<span id="an_18:37">18:37</span> Pilate therefore said unto him, Art
thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this
end have I been born, and to this end am I come into the world, that I
should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth
heareth my voice.

<span id="an_18:38">18:38</span> Pilate saith unto him, What is truth?
And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith
unto them, I find no crime in him.

<span id="an_18:39">18:39</span> But ye have a custom, that I should
release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release
unto you the King of the Jews?

<span id="an_18:40">18:40</span> They cried out therefore again, saying,
Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.)

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and
scourged him.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> And the soldiers platted a crown of
thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple garment;

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> and they came unto him, and said, Hail,
King of the Jews! and they struck him with their hands.

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> And Pilate went out again, and saith unto
them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find no
crime in him.

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> Jesus therefore came out, wearing the
crown of thorns and the purple garment. And \[Pilate\] saith unto them,
Behold, the man!

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> When therefore the chief priests and the
officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify \[him\], crucify
\[him\]! Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him:
for I find no crime in him.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> The Jews answered him, We have a law, and
by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> When Pilate therefore heard this saying,
he was the more afraid;

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> and he entered into the Praetorium again,
and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> Pilate therefore saith unto him,
Speakest thou not unto me? Knowest thou not that I have power to release
thee, and have power to crucify thee?

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have
no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he
that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> Upon this Pilate sought to release him:
but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not
Caesar's friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against
Caesar.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> When Pilate therefore heard these
words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a
place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> Now it was the Preparation of the
passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews,
Behold, your King!

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> They therefore cried out, Away with
\[him\], away with \[him\], crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I
crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but
Caesar.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> Then therefore he delivered him unto
them to be crucified.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> They took Jesus therefore: and he went
out, bearing the cross for himself, unto the place called The place of a
skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha:

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> where they crucified him, and with him
two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> And Pilate wrote a title also, and put
it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF
THE JEWS.

<span id="an_19:20">19:20</span> This title therefore read many of the
Jews, for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city; and
it was written in Hebrew, \[and\] in Latin, \[and\] in Greek.

<span id="an_19:21">19:21</span> The chief priests of the Jews therefore
said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am
King of the Jews.

<span id="an_19:22">19:22</span> Pilate answered, What I have written I
have written.

<span id="an_19:23">19:23</span> The soldiers therefore, when they had
crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier
a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the
top throughout.

<span id="an_19:24">19:24</span> They said therefore one to another, Let
us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the
scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my garments among
them, And upon my vesture did they cast lots.

<span id="an_19:25">19:25</span> These things therefore the soldiers
did. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his
mother's sister, Mary the \[wife\] of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.

<span id="an_19:26">19:26</span> When Jesus therefore saw his mother,
and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his mother,
Woman, behold thy son!

<span id="an_19:27">19:27</span> Then saith he to the disciple, Behold,
thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own
\[home\].

<span id="an_19:28">19:28</span> After this Jesus, knowing that all
things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished,
saith, I thirst.

<span id="an_19:29">19:29</span> There was set there a vessel full of
vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and
brought it to his mouth.

<span id="an_19:30">19:30</span> When Jesus therefore had received the
vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his
spirit.

<span id="an_19:31">19:31</span> The Jews therefore, because it was the
Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the
sabbath (for the day of that sabbath was a high \[day\]), asked of
Pilate that their legs might be broken, and \[that\] they might be taken
away.

<span id="an_19:32">19:32</span> The soldiers therefore came, and brake
the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him:

<span id="an_19:33">19:33</span> but when they came to Jesus, and saw
that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:

<span id="an_19:34">19:34</span> howbeit one of the soldiers with a
spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water.

<span id="an_19:35">19:35</span> And he that hath seen hath borne
witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true,
that ye also may believe.

<span id="an_19:36">19:36</span> For these things came to pass, that the
scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.

<span id="an_19:37">19:37</span> And again another scripture saith, They
shall look on him whom they pierced.

<span id="an_19:38">19:38</span> And after these things Joseph of
Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the
Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and
Pilate gave \[him\] leave. He came therefore, and took away his body.

<span id="an_19:39">19:39</span> And there came also Nicodemus, he who
at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and
aloes, about a hundred pounds.

<span id="an_19:40">19:40</span> So they took the body of Jesus, and
bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is
to bury.

<span id="an_19:41">19:41</span> Now in the place where he was crucified
there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man
yet laid.

<span id="an_19:42">19:42</span> There then because of the Jews'
Preparation (for the tomb was nigh at hand) they laid Jesus.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> Now on the first \[day\] of the week
cometh Mary Magdalene early, while it was yet dark, unto the tomb, and
seeth the stone taken away from the tomb.

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> She runneth therefore, and cometh to
Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith unto
them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not
where they have laid him.

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> Peter therefore went forth, and the other
disciple, and they went toward the tomb.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> And they ran both together: and the other
disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb;

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> and stooping and looking in, he seeth the
linen cloths lying; yet entered he not in.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> Simon Peter therefore also cometh,
following him, and entered into the tomb; and he beholdeth the linen
cloths lying,

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> and the napkin, that was upon his head,
not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> Then entered in therefore the other
disciple also, who came first to the tomb, and he saw, and believed.

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> For as yet they knew not the scripture,
that he must rise from the dead.

<span id="an_20:10">20:10</span> So the disciples went away again unto
their own home.

<span id="an_20:11">20:11</span> But Mary was standing without at the
tomb weeping: so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb;

<span id="an_20:12">20:12</span> and she beholdeth two angels in white
sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus
had lain.

<span id="an_20:13">20:13</span> And they say unto her, Woman, why
weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord,
and I know not where they have laid him.

<span id="an_20:14">20:14</span> When she had thus said, she turned
herself back, and beholdeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was
Jesus.

<span id="an_20:15">20:15</span> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why
weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener,
saith unto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou
hast laid him, and I will take him away.

<span id="an_20:16">20:16</span> Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turneth
herself, and saith unto him in Hebrew, Rabboni; which is to say,
Teacher.

<span id="an_20:17">20:17</span> Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I
am not yet ascended unto the Father: but go unto my brethren, and say to
them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.

<span id="an_20:18">20:18</span> Mary Magdalene cometh and telleth the
disciples, I have seen the Lord; and \[that\] he had said these things
unto her.

<span id="an_20:19">20:19</span> When therefore it was evening, on that
day, the first \[day\] of the week, and when the doors were shut where
the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the
midst, and saith unto them, Peace \[be\] unto you.

<span id="an_20:20">20:20</span> And when he had said this, he showed
unto them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad,
when they saw the Lord.

<span id="an_20:21">20:21</span> Jesus therefore said to them again,
Peace \[be\] unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you.

<span id="an_20:22">20:22</span> And when he had said this, he breathed
on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit:

<span id="an_20:23">20:23</span> whose soever sins ye forgive, they are
forgiven unto them; whose soever \[sins\] ye retain, they are retained.

<span id="an_20:24">20:24</span> But Thomas, one of the twelve, called
Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.

<span id="an_20:25">20:25</span> The other disciples therefore said unto
him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in
his hands the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will
not believe.

<span id="an_20:26">20:26</span> And after eight days again his
disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors
being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace \[be\] unto you.

<span id="an_20:27">20:27</span> Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither
thy finger, and see my hands; and reach \[hither\] thy hand, and put it
into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.

<span id="an_20:28">20:28</span> Thomas answered and said unto him, My
Lord and my God.

<span id="an_20:29">20:29</span> Jesus saith unto him, Because thou hast
seen me, thou hast believed: blessed \[are\] they that have not seen,
and \[yet\] have believed.

<span id="an_20:30">20:30</span> Many other signs therefore did Jesus in
the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book:

<span id="an_20:31">20:31</span> but these are written, that ye may
believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye
may have life in his name.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> After these things Jesus manifested
himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and he manifested
\[himself\] on this wise.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> There was together Simon Peter, and
Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the
\[sons\] of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a
fishing. They say unto him, We also come with thee. They went forth, and
entered into the boat; and that night they took nothing.

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> But when day was now breaking, Jesus
stood on the beach: yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> Jesus therefore saith unto them,
Children, have ye aught to eat? They answered him, No.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> And he said unto them, Cast the net on
the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and
now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved
saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it was
the Lord, he girt his coat about him (for he was naked), and cast
himself into the sea.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> But the other disciples came in the
little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred
cubits off), dragging the net \[full\] of fishes.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> So when they got out upon the land, they
see a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the
fish which ye have now taken.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> Simon Peter therefore went up, and drew
the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three:
and for all there were so many, the net was not rent.

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> Jesus saith unto them, Come \[and\]
break your fast. And none of the disciples durst inquire of him, Who art
thou? knowing that it was the Lord.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> Jesus cometh, and taketh the bread, and
giveth them, and the fish likewise.

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> This is now the third time that Jesus
was manifested to the disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> So when they had broken their fast,
Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, \[son\] of John, lovest thou me more
than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee.
He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> He saith to him again a second time,
Simon, \[son\] of John, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord;
thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Tend my sheep.

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> He saith unto him the third time,
Simon, \[son\] of John, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he
said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him,
Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus
saith unto him, Feed my sheep.

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When
thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou
wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy
hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest
not.

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> Now this he spake, signifying by what
manner of death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he
saith unto him, Follow me.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> Peter, turning about, seeth the
disciple whom Jesus loved following; who also leaned back on his breast
at the supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> Peter therefore seeing him saith to
Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he
tarry till I come, what \[is that\] to thee? Follow thou me.

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> This saying therefore went forth among
the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto
him, that he should not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come,
what \[is that\] to thee?

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> This is the disciple that beareth
witness of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his
witness is true.

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> And there are also many other things
which Jesus did, the which if they should be written every one, I
suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that
should be written.
