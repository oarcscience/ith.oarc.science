### American Standard Version: Micah

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The word of Jehovah that came to Micah the
Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah,
which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Hear, ye peoples, all of you: hearken, O
earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord Jehovah be witness
against you, the Lord from his holy temple.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> For, behold, Jehovah cometh forth out of
his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the
earth.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> And the mountains shall be melted under
him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, as waters
that are poured down a steep place.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> For the transgression of Jacob is all this,
and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of
Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are
they not Jerusalem?

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Therefore I will make Samaria as a heap of
the field, \[and\] as places for planting vineyards; and I will pour
down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will uncover the
foundations thereof.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> And all her graven images shall be beaten
to pieces, and all her hires shall be burned with fire, and all her
idols will I lay desolate; for of the hire of a harlot hath she gathered
them, and unto the hire of a harlot shall they return.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> For this will I lament and wail; I will go
stripped and naked; I will make a wailing like the jackals, and a
lamentation like the ostriches.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> For her wounds are incurable; for it is
come even unto Judah; it reacheth unto the gate of my people, even to
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Tell it not in Gath, weep not at all: at
Beth-le-aphrah have I rolled myself in the dust.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Pass away, O inhabitant of Shaphir, in
nakedness and shame: the inhabitant of Zaanan is not come forth; the
wailing of Beth-ezel shall take from you the stay thereof.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> For the inhabitant of Maroth waiteth
anxiously for good, because evil is come down from Jehovah unto the gate
of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Bind the chariot to the swift steed, O
inhabitant of Lachish: she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of
Zion; for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> Therefore shalt thou give a parting gift
to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing unto
the kings of Israel.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> I will yet bring unto thee, O inhabitant
of Mareshah, him that shall possess thee: the glory of Israel shall come
even unto Adullam.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> Make thee bald, and cut off thy hair for
the children of thy delight: enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they
are gone into captivity from thee.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Woe to them that devise iniquity and work
evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it,
because it is in the power of their hand.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> And they covet fields, and seize them; and
houses, and take them away: and they oppress a man and his house, even a
man and his heritage.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold,
against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove
your necks, neither shall ye walk haughtily; for it is an evil time.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> In that day shall they take up a parable
against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, \[and\] say, We are
utterly ruined: he changeth the portion of my people: how doth he remove
\[it\] from me! to the rebellious he divideth our fields.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Therefore thou shalt have none that shall
cast the line by lot in the assembly of Jehovah.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> Prophesy ye not, \[thus\] they prophesy.
They shall not prophesy to these: reproaches shall not depart.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, Is the
Spirit of Jehovah straitened? are these his doings? Do not my words do
good to him that walketh uprightly?

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> But of late my people is risen up as an
enemy: ye strip the robe from off the garment from them that pass by
securely \[as men\] averse from war.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> The women of my people ye cast out from
their pleasant houses; from their young children ye take away my glory
for ever.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> Arise ye, and depart; for this is not
your resting-place; because of uncleanness that destroyeth, even with a
grievous destruction.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood
do lie, \[saying\], I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong
drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of
thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them
together as the sheep of Bozrah, as a flock in the midst of their
pasture; they shall make great noise by reason of \[the multitude of\]
men.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> The breaker is gone up before them: they
have broken forth and passed on to the gate, and are gone out thereat;
and their king is passed on before them, and Jehovah at the head of
them.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> And I said, Hear, I pray you, ye heads of
Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel: is it not for you to know
justice?

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> ye who hate the good, and love the evil;
who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their
bones;

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> who also eat the flesh of my people, and
flay their skin from off them, and break their bones, and chop them in
pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Then shall they cry unto Jehovah, but he
will not answer them; yea, he will hide his face from them at that time,
according as they have wrought evil in their doings.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets
that make my people to err; that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace;
and whoso putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against
him:

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> Therefore it shall be night unto you, that
ye shall have no vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall
not divine; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day
shall be black over them.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> And the seers shall be put to shame, and
the diviners confounded; yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there
is no answer of God.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> But as for me, I am full of power by the
Spirit of Jehovah, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob
his transgression, and to Israel his sin.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the
house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, that abhor justice,
and pervert all equity.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> They build up Zion with blood, and
Jerusalem with iniquity.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> The heads thereof judge for reward, and
the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for
money: yet they lean upon Jehovah, and say, Is not Jehovah in the midst
of us? no evil shall come upon us.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Therefore shall Zion for your sake be
plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of
the house as the high places of a forest.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> But in the latter days it shall come to
pass, that the mountain of Jehovah's house shall be established on the
top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and
peoples shall flow unto it.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> And many nations shall go and say, Come ye,
and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God
of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his
paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah
from Jerusalem;

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> and he will judge between many peoples, and
will decide concerning strong nations afar off: and they shall beat
their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks;
nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn
war any more.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> But they shall sit every man under his vine
and under his fig-tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth
of Jehovah of hosts hath spoken it.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> For all the peoples walk every one in the
name of his god; and we will walk in the name of Jehovah our God for
ever and ever.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> In that day, saith Jehovah, will I assemble
that which is lame, and I will gather that which is driven away, and
that which I have afflicted;

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> and I will make that which was lame a
remnant, and that which was cast far off a strong nation: and Jehovah
will reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth even for ever.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> And thou, O tower of the flock, the hill of
the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, yea, the former dominion
shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> Now why dost thou cry out aloud? Is there
no king in thee, is thy counsellor perished, that pangs have taken hold
of thee as of a woman in travail?

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O
daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now shalt thou go forth
out of the city, and shalt dwell in the field, and shalt come even unto
Babylon: there shalt thou be rescued; there will Jehovah redeem thee
from the hand of thine enemies.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> And now many nations are assembled
against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye see \[our
desire\] upon Zion.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> But they know not the thoughts of
Jehovah, neither understand they his counsel; for he hath gathered them
as the sheaves to the threshing-floor.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for
I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass; and thou
shalt beat in pieces many peoples: and I will devote their gain unto
Jehovah, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Now shalt thou gather thyself in troops, O
daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us; they shall smite the
judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> But thou, Beth-lehem Ephrathah, which art
little to be among the thousands of Judah, out of thee shall one come
forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth are from
of old, from everlasting.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> Therefore will he give them up, until the
time that she who travaileth hath brought forth: then the residue of his
brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> And he shall stand, and shall feed \[his
flock\] in the strength of Jehovah, in the majesty of the name of
Jehovah his God: and they shall abide; for now shall he be great unto
the ends of the earth.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> And this \[man\] shall be \[our\] peace.
When the Assyrian shall come into our land, and when he shall tread in
our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight
principal men.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> And they shall waste the land of Assyria
with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: and he
shall deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and
when he treadeth within our border.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the
midst of many peoples as dew from Jehovah, as showers upon the grass,
that tarry not for man, nor wait for the sons of men.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the
nations, in the midst of many peoples, as a lion among the beasts of the
forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep; who, if he go
through, treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and there is none to
deliver.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> Let thy hand be lifted up above thine
adversaries, and let all thine enemies be cut off.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> And it shall come to pass in that day,
saith Jehovah, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee,
and will destroy thy chariots:

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> and I will cut off the cities of thy
land, and will throw down all thy strongholds.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thy
hand; and thou shalt have no \[more\] soothsayers:

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> and I will cut off thy graven images and
thy pillars out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the
work of thy hands;

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> and I will pluck up thine Asherim out of
the midst of thee; and I will destroy thy cities.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> And I will execute vengeance in anger and
wrath upon the nations which hearkened not.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Hear ye now what Jehovah saith: Arise,
contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Hear, O ye mountains, Jehovah's
controversy, and ye enduring foundations of the earth; for Jehovah hath
a controversy with his people, and he will contend with Israel.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> O my people, what have I done unto thee?
and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> For I brought thee up out of the land of
Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage; and I sent before
thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> O my people, remember now what Balak king
of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him;
\[remember\] from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the righteous
acts of Jehovah.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> Wherewith shall I come before Jehovah, and
bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with
burnt-offerings, with calves a year old?

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of
rams, \[or\] with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my
first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my
soul?

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> He hath showed thee, O man, what is good;
and what doth Jehovah require of thee, but to do justly, and to love
kindness, and to walk humbly with thy God?

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> The voice of Jehovah crieth unto the city,
and \[the man of\] wisdom will see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who
hath appointed it.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> Are there yet treasures of wickedness in
the house of the wicked, and a scant measure that is abominable?

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> Shall I be pure with wicked balances, and
with a bag of deceitful weights?

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> For the rich men thereof are full of
violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue
is deceitful in their mouth.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> Therefore I also have smitten thee with a
grievous wound; I have made thee desolate because of thy sins.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and
thy humiliation shall be in the midst of thee: and thou shalt put away,
but shalt not save; and that which thou savest will I give up to the
sword.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap; thou
shalt tread the olives, but shalt not anoint thee with oil; and the
vintage, but shalt not drink the wine.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> For the statutes of Omri are kept, and
all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that
I may make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof a hissing: and
ye shall bear the reproach of my people.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> Woe is me! for I am as when they have
gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there
is no cluster to eat; my soul desireth the first-ripe fig.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> The godly man is perished out of the earth,
and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood;
they hunt every man his brother with a net.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> Their hands are upon that which is evil to
do it diligently; the prince asketh, and the judge \[is ready\] for a
reward; and the great man, he uttereth the evil desire of his soul: thus
they weave it together.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> The best of them is as a brier; the most
upright is \[worse\] than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen, even
thy visitation, is come; now shall be their perplexity.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> Trust ye not in a neighbor; put ye not
confidence in a friend; keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth
in thy bosom.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> For the son dishonoreth the father, the
daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her
mother-in-law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> But as for me, I will look unto Jehovah; I
will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when
I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, Jehovah will be a light
unto me.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> I will bear the indignation of Jehovah,
because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute
judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, \[and\] I shall
behold his righteousness.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> Then mine enemy shall see it, and shame
shall cover her who said unto me, Where is Jehovah thy God? Mine eyes
shall see \[my desire\] upon her; now shall she be trodden down as the
mire of the streets.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> A day for building thy walls! in that day
shall the decree be far removed.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> In that day shall they come unto thee
from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River,
and from sea to sea, and \[from\] mountain to mountain.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> Yet shall the land be desolate because of
them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock
of thy heritage, which dwell solitarily, in the forest in the midst of
Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> As in the days of thy coming forth out of
the land of Egypt will I show unto them marvellous things.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> The nations shall see and be ashamed of
all their might; they shall lay their hand upon their mouth; their ears
shall be deaf.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> They shall lick the dust like a serpent;
like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their
close places; they shall come with fear unto Jehovah our God, and shall
be afraid because of thee.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> Who is a God like unto thee, that
pardoneth iniquity, and passeth over the transgression of the remnant of
his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth
in lovingkindness.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> He will again have compassion upon us; he
will tread our iniquities under foot; and thou wilt cast all their sins
into the depths of the sea.

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob,
\[and\] the lovingkindness to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our
fathers from the days of old.
