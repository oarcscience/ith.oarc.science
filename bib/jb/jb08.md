### IV.

<span class="small">*John Baptizes in Jordan*.</span>

NOW in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius
Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee,
and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of
Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

2 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto
John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

3 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of
repentance for the remission of sins.

4 And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern
girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.

5 ¶ Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region
round about Jordan;

6 And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.
