### LVIII.

*Parable of the Talents*.

FOR *the kingdom of heaven* is as a man travelling into a far country,
*who* called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.

2 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one;
to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his
journey.

3 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the
same, and made *them* other five talents.

4 And likewise he that *had received* two, he also gained other two.

5 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his
lord's money.

6 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth
with them.

7 And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five
talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I
have gained beside them five talents more.

8 His lord said unto him, Well done, *thou* good and faithful servant:
thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over
many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

9 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou
deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents
beside them.

10 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou
hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many
things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

11 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew
thee that thou art an

hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou
hast not strawed:

12 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo,
*there* thou hast *that is* thine.

13 His lord answered and said unto him, *Thou* wicked and slothful
servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I
have not strawed:

14 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and
*then* at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.

15 Take therefore the talent from him, and give *it* unto him which hath
ten talents.

16 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have
abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that
which he hath.

17 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall
be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
