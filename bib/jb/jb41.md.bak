### XXXVII.

<span class="small">*Precepts*.</span>

FOR which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first,
and counteth the cost, whether he have *sufficient* to finish *it?*

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

2 Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to
finish *it*, all that behold *it* begin to mock him,

3 Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.

4 Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down
first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him
that cometh against him with twenty thousand?

5 Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an
ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.
