### RELIGIOUS VIEWS

### OF

### THOMAS JEFFERSON.

In a letter to his daughter, written in 1803, Mr. Jefferson said: "A
promise made to a friend some years ago, but executed only lately, has
placed my religious creed on paper. I have thought it just that my
family, by possessing this, should be enabled to estimate the libels
published against me on this, as on every other possible subject." The
"religious creed" to which he referred was a comparison of the doctrines
of Jesus with those of others, prepared in fulfillment of a promise made
to Dr. Benjamin Rush. This paper, with the letter to Dr. Rush which
accompanied it. is a fit introduction to the "Jefferson Bible."

Washington, April 21, 1803.

Dear Sir: In some of the delightful conversations with you, in the
evenings of 1798-99, and which served as an anodyne to the afflictions
of the crisis through which our country was

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

then laboring, the Christian religion was sometimes our topic; and I
then promised you that one day or other, I would give you my views of
it. They are the result of a life of inquiry and reflection, and very
different from that Anti-Christian system imputed to me by those who
know nothing of my opinions. To the corruptions of christianity I am
indeed opposed; but not to the genuine precepts of Jesus himself. I am a
Christian in the only sense in which he wished any one to be; sincerely
attached to his doctrines, in preference to all others; ascribing to
himself every human excellence, and believing he never claimed any
other.

At the short intervals since these conversations, when I could
justifiably abstract my mind from public affairs, this subject has been
under my contemplation; but the more I considered it, the more it
expanded beyond the measure of either my time or Information. In the
moment of my late departure from Monticello, I received from Dr.
Priestly his little treatise of "Socrates and Jesus Compared." This
being a section of the general view I had taken of the field, it became
a subject of reflection while on the road, and unoccupied otherwise. The
result was to arrange in my mind a syllabus, or outline, of such an
estimate of the comparative merits of Christianity, as I wished to see
executed by some one of more leisure and information for the task than
myself. This I now send you, as the only discharge of my promise I can
probably ever execute. And in confiding it to you, I know it will not be
exposed to the

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

malignant perversions of those who make every word from me a text for
new misrepresentations and calumnies.

I am moreover averse to the communication of my religious tenets to the
public; because it would countenance the presumption of those who have
endeavored to draw them before that tribunal, and to seduce public
opinion to erect itself into that inquisition over the rights of
conscience which the laws have so justly proscribed. It behooves every
man who values liberty of conscience for himself to resist invasions of
it in the case of others, or their case may, by change of circumstances,
become his own. It behooves him, too, in his own case, to give no
example of concession, betraying the right of independent opinion by
answering questions of faith, which the laws have left between God and
himself.

Accept my affectionate salutations.

#### SYLLABUS OF AN ESTIMATE OF THE DOCTRINES OF JESUS, COMPARED WITH THOSE OF OTHERS.

In a comparative view of the ethics of the enlightened nations of
antiquity, of the Jews, and of Jesus, no notice should be taken of the
corruptions of reason among the ancients, to wit, the idolatry and
superstition of the vulgar, nor of the corruptions of Christianity by
the learned among its professors. Let a just view be taken of the moral
principles inculcated by the most esteemed of the sects of ancient
philosophy, or of

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

their individuals; particularly Pythagoras, Socrates, Epicurus, Cicero,
Epictetus, Seneca, Antoninus.

##### I. PHILOSOPHERS.

1\. Their precepts related chiefly to ourselves, and the government of
those passions which, unrestrained, would disturb our tranquility of
mind. In this branch of philosophy they were really great.

2\. In developing our duties to others, they were short and defective.
They embraced indeed the circles of kindred and friends, and inculcated
patriotism, or the love of country in the aggregate, as a primary
obligation: towards our neighbors and countrymen they taught justice,
but scarcely viewed them as within the circle of benevolence. Still less
have they inculcated peace, charity, and love to our fellow-men, or
embraced with benevolence the whole family of mankind.

##### II. JEWS.

1\. Their system was Deism, that is, the belief in one only God; but
their ideas of him and of his attributes were degrading and injurious.

2\. Their ethics were not only imperfect, but often irreconcilable with
the sound dictates of reason and morality, as they respect intercourse
with those around us; and repulsive and anti-social as respecting other
nations. They needed reformation, therefore, in an eminent degree.

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

##### III. JESUS.

In this state of things among the Jews, Jesus appeared. His parentage
was obscure; his condition poor; his education null; his natural
endowments great; his life correct and innocent. He was meek,
benevolent, patient, firm, disinterested, and of the sublimest
eloquence. The disadvantages under which his doctrines appear are
remarkable.

1\. Like Socrates and Epictetus, he wrote nothing himself.

2\. But he had not, like them, a Xenophon or an Arrian to write for him.
I name not Plato, who only used the name of Socrates to cover the
whimsies of his own brain.

On the contrary, all the learned of his country, entrenched in its power
and riches, were opposed to him, lest his labors should undermine their
advantages; and the committing to writing of his life and doctrines fell
on unlettered and ignorant men; who wrote, too, from memory, and not
till long after the transactions had passed.

3\. According to the ordinary fate of those who attempt to enlighten and
reform mankind, he fell an early victim to the jealousy and combination
of the altar and the throne, at about 33 years of age, his reason having
not yet attained the maximum of its energy, nor the course of his
preaching, which was but of three years at most, presented occasions for
developing a complete system of morals.

4\. Hence the doctrines which he really delivered were defective, as a
whole, and fragments only of what he did deliver

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

have come to us mutilated, misstated, and often
[unintelligible](errata.htm#0.md).

5\. They have been still more disfigured by the corruptions of
schismatizing followers, who have found an interest in sophisticating
and perverting the simple doctrines he taught, by engrafting on them the
mysticisms of a Grecian Sophist (Plato), frittering them into subtilties
and obscuring them with jargon, until they have caused good men to
reject the whole in disgust, and to view Jesus himself as an impostor.
Notwithstanding these disadvantages, a system of morals is presented to
us which, if filled up in the true style and spirit of the rich
fragments he left us, would be the most perfect and sublime that has
ever been taught by man. The question of his being a member of the
Godhead, or in direct communication with it, claimed for him by some of
his followers, and denied by others, is foreign to the present view,
which is merely an estimate of the intrinsic merits of his doctrines.

1\. He corrected the Deism of the Jews, confirming them in their belief
of one only god, and giving them juster notions of his attributes and
government.

2\. His moral doctrines, relating to kindred and friends, were more pure
and perfect than those of the most correct of the philosophers, and
greatly more so than those of the Jews; and they went far beyond both in
inculcating universal philanthrophy, not only to kindred and friends, to
neighbors and countrymen,

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

but to all mankind, gathering all into one family, under the bonds of
love, charity, peace, common wants and common aids. A development of
this head will evince the peculiar superiority of the system of Jesus
over all others.

3\. The precepts of philosophy and of the Hebrew code laid hold of
action only. He pushed his scrutinies into the heart of man; erected his
tribunal in the region of his thought, and purified the waters at the
fountain head.

4\. He taught emphatically the doctrine of a future state, which was
either doubted or disbelieved by the Jews; and wielded it with efficacy
as an important incentive, supplementary to the other motives to moral
conduct.

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

I, too, have made a wee-little book from the same materials (The
Gospels) which I call the Philosophy of Jesus. It is a paradigma of his
doctrines, made by cutting the texts out of the book and arranging them
on the pages of a blank book, in a certain order of time or subject. A
more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never seen. It is a
document in proof that I am a REAL CHRISTIAN, that is to say, a disciple
of the doctrines of Jesus, very different from the Platonists, who call
ME infidel and THEMSELVES Christians and preachers of the Gospel, while
they draw all their characteristic dogmas from what its author never
said nor saw. They have compounded from the heathen mysteries a system
beyond the comprehension of man, of which the great reformer of the
vicious ethics and deism of the Jews, were he to return on earth, would
not recognize one feature.—*Jefferson to Mr. Charles Thompson*.
