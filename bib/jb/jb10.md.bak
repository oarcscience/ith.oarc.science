### VI.

<span class="small">*Drives the Traders Out of the Temple*.</span>

AFTER this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his
brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.

2 ¶ And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem;

3 And found in the temple those hat sold oxen and sheep and doves, and
the changers of money sitting:

4 And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out
of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’
money, and overthrew the tables;

5 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not
my Father's house an house of merchandise.
