<p align="center"><small><i>Love God and Thy Neighbour; Parable of the Samaritan</i>.</small></p>  
<p>AND, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</p>  
<p>2 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?</p>  
<p>3 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.</p>  
<p>4 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.</p>

<p>5 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?</p>  
<p>6 And Jesus answering said, A certain <i>man</i> went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded <i>him</i>, and departed, leaving <i>him</i> half dead.</p>  
<p>7 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him he passed by on the other side.</p>  
<p>8 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked <i>on him</i>, and passed by on the other side.</p>  
<p>9 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion <i>on him</i>,</p>  
<p>10 And went to <i>him</i>, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</p>  
<p>11 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave <i>them</i> to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</p>

<p>12 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?</p>  
<p>13 And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.</p>
