### XXXV.

<span class="small">*The Sabbath*.</span>

AND it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief
Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him.

2 And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy.

3 And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is
it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?

4 And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let
him go;

5 And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox
fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath
day?

6 And they could not answer him again to these things.
