### IX.

<span class="small">*Explains the Sabbath*.</span>

AT that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his
disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to
eat.

2 But when the Pharisees saw *it*, they said unto him, Behold, thy
disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.

3 But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an
hungred, and they that were with him;

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

4 How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shew-bread,
which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with
him, but only for the priests?

5 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the
priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?

6 ¶ And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:

7 And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they
asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they
might accuse him.

8 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall
have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he
not lay hold on it, and lift it out?

9 How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to
do well on the sabbath days.

10 And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for
the Sabbath.

11 ¶ Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how
they might destroy him.

12 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great
multitudes followed him, and he healed them all.
