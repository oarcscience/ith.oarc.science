<p>AND he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,</p>  
<p>2 When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;</p>  
<p>3 And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.</p>  
<p>4 But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee.</p>  
<p>5 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</p>  
<p>6 &para;[ Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not</p>  
<p><a name="page_93"><font size="1" color="green">p. 93</font></A></p>  
<p>thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor <i>thy</i> rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made thee.</p>  
<p>7 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:</p>  
<p>8 And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.</p>  
<p>9 &para; And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed <i>is</i> he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.</p>  
<p>10 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:</p>  
<p>11 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.</p>  
<p>12 And they all with one <i>consent</i> began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.</p>  
<p>13 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.</p>  
<p><a name="page_94"><font size="1" color="green">p. 94</font></A></p>  
<p>14 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.</p>  
<p>15 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.</p>  
<p>16 And the servant said, Lord it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.</p>  
<p>17 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel <i>them</i> to come in, that my house may be filled.</p>  
<p>18 For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper.</p>
