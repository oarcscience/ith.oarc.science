### LXV.

<span class="small">*Is then Carried to Pilate*.</span>

THEN led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was
early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they
should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.

2 Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye
against this man?

3 They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would
not have delivered him up unto thee.

4 Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to
your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to
put any man to death.

5 Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus,
and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?

6 Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others
tell it thee of me?

7 Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests
have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?

8 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of
this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered
to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.

9 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered,
Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause
came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every
one that is of the truth heareth my voice.

10 Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he
went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no
fault *at all*.

11 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people,
teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.

12 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they
witness against thee?
