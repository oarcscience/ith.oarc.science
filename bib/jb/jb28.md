### XXIV.

<span class="small">*A Prophet Hath no Honor in his Own Country*.</span>

AND it came to pass, *that* when Jesus had finished these parables, he
departed thence.

2 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their
synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished and said, Whence hath this
*man* this wisdom, and *these* mighty works?

3 Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and
his brethren James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?

4 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this *man*
all these things?

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

5\. And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet
is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.
