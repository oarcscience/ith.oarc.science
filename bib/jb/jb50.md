### XLVI.

<span class="small">*Goes to Jerusalem and Bethany*.</span>

AND when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto
the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,

2 Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and
straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose
*them*, and bring *them* unto me.

3 And if any *man* say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need
of them; and straightway he will send them.

4 And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,

5 And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and
they set *him* thereon.

6 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others
cut down branches from the trees, and strawed *them* in the way.

7 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying,
Who is this?

8 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye
prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.

9 And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at
the feast:

10 The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee,
and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.

11 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell
Jesus.

12 And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of
man should be glorified.

13 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the
ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much
fruit.

14 And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he
lodged there.
