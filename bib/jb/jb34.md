### XXX.

<span class="small">*The Woman Taken in Adultery*.</span>

JESUS went unto the mount of Olives.

2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the
people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.

3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in
adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,

4 They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the
very act.

5 Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned; but
what sayest thou?

6 This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But
Jesus stooped down, and with *his* finger wrote on the ground, *as
though he heard them not*.

7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto
them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at
her.

8 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.

9 And they which heard *it*, being convicted by *their own* conscience,
went out one by one beginning at the eldest, *even* unto the last: and
Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.

10 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said
unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned
thee?

11 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn
thee; go, and sin no more.
