### XVIII.

<span class="small">*Precepts*.</span>

AND as he spake a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he
went in, and sat down to meat.

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

2 And when the Pharisee saw *it*, he marvelled that he had not first
washed before dinner.

3 And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside
of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and
wickedness.

4 *Ye* fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which
is within also?

5 But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all
things are clean unto you.

6 But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner
of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to
have done, and not to leave the other undone.

7 Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the
synagogues, and greetings in the markets.

8 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves
which appear not, and the men that walk over *them* are not aware *of
them*.

9 Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus
saying thou reproachest us also.

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

10 And he said, Woe unto you also, *ye* lawyers! for ye lade men with
burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens
with one of your fingers.

11 Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge:
ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye
hindered.

12 And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees
began to urge *him* vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many
things:

13 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth,
that they might accuse him.
