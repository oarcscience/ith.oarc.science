### XL.

<span class="small">*Parable of Lazarus*.</span>

THERE was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen
and fared sumptuously every day:

2 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his
gate, full of sores,

3 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's
table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.

4 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the
angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;

5 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments and seeth Abraham
afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.

6 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send
Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my
tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.

7 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst
thy good things, and likewise

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lazarus evil
things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.

8 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed:
so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they
pass to us, that *would come* from thence.

9 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send
him to my father's house:

10 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they
also come into this place of torment.

11\. Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them
hear them.

12 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the
dead, they will repent.

13 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets,
neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.
