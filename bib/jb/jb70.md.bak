### LXVI.

<span class="small">*Who Sends Him to Herod*.</span>

WHEN Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilean.

2 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he
sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.

3 ¶ And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous
to see him of a long *season*, because he had heard many things of him;
and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.

4 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him
nothing.

5 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.

6 And Herod with his men of war set him at naught, and mocked *him*, and
arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.

7 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for
before they were at enmity between themselves.
