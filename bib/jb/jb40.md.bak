### XXXVI.

<span class="small">*The Bidden to a Feast*.</span>

AND he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked
how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,

2 When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the
highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;

3 And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man
place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.

4 But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that
when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up
higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at
meat with thee.

5 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth
himself shall be exalted.

6 ¶\[ Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner
or a supper, call not

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor *thy* rich
neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made
thee.

7 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the
blind:

8 And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou
shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.

9 ¶ And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things,
he said unto him, Blessed *is* he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of
God.

10 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade
many:

11 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden,
Come; for all things are now ready.

12 And they all with one *consent* began to make excuse. The first said
unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see
it: I pray thee have me excused.

13 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove
them: I pray thee have me excused.

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

14 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.

15 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the
master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into
the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the
maimed, and the halt, and the blind.

16 And the servant said, Lord it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet
there is room.

17 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and
hedges, and compel *them* to come in, that my house may be filled.

18 For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall
taste of my supper.
