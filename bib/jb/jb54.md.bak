### L.

<span class="small">*Parable of the King and the Wedding*.</span>

AND Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,

2 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a
marriage for his son;

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

3 And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the
wedding; and they would not come.

4 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are
bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and *my* fatlings
*are* killed, and all things *are* ready: come unto the marriage.

5 But they made light of *it*, and went their ways, one to his farm,
another to his merchandise:

6 And the remnant took his servants, and entreated *them* spitefully,
and slew *them*.

7 But when the king heard *thereof*, he was wroth: and he sent forth his
armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.

8 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which
were bidden were not worthy.

9 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid
to the marriage.

10 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together
all as many as they found, both bad and good; and the wedding was
furnished with guests.

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

11 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which
had not on a wedding garment:

12 And he saith unto him, Friend, how earnest thou in hither not having
a wedding garment? And he was speechless.

13 Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take
him away and cast *him* into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.

14 For many are called, but few *are* chosen.
