### XV.

<span class="small">*Parable of the Rich Man*.</span>

AND he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich
man brought forth plentifully:

2 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have
no room where to bestow my fruits?

3 And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build
greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.

4 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many
years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.

5 But God said unto him, *Thou* fool, this night thy soul shall be
required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast
provided?

6 So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward
God.
