### XLI.

<span class="small">*Precepts to be Always Ready*.</span>

THEN said he unto the disciples, it is impossible but that offences will
come: but woe *unto him*, through whom they come!

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

2 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck,
and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little
ones.

3 ¶ Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee,
rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.

4 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times
in a day turn again to thee. saying, T repent; thou shalt forgive him.

5 But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say
unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to
meat?

6 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and
gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward
thou shalt eat and drink?

7 Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were
commanded him? I trow not.

8 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are
commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that
which was our duty to do.

9 ¶ And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God
should come, he

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

answered them and said, The Kingdom of God cometh not with observation.

10 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of
the Son of man.

11 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in
marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood
came, and destroyed them all.

12 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank,
they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;

13 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and
brimstone from heaven, and destroyed *them* all.

14 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.

15 In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his staff in
the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the
field, let him likewise not return back.

16 Remember Lot's wife.

17 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever
shall lose his life shall preserve it.

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

18 I tell you, in that night there shall be two *men* in one bed; the
one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.

19 Two *women* shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and
the other left.

20 Two *men* shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the
other left.
