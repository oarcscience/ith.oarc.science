<p>AT that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.</p>  
<p>2 But when the Pharisees saw <i>it</i>, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.</p>  
<p>3 But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;</p>  
<p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="green">p. 28</font></A></p>  
<p>4 How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shew-bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?</p>  
<p>5 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?</p>  
<p>6 &para; And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:</p>  
<p>7 And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.</p>  
<p>8 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?</p>  
<p>9 How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.</p>  
<p>10 And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.</p>  
<p>11 &para; Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.</p>  
<p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="green">p. 29</font></A></p>  
<p>12 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all.</p>
