### XLIX.

<span class="small">*Parable of the Vineyard and Husbandmen*.</span>

HEAR another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a
vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a wine-press in it, and
built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far
country:

2 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might
receive from the husband-men of the fruit of the vineyard.

3 And they caught *him*, and beat him, and sent *him* away empty.

4 And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast
stones, and wounded *him* in the head, and sent *him* away shamefully
handled.

5 And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others;
beating some, and killing some.

6 Having yet therefore one son, his well-beloved, he sent him also last
unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.

7 But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come,
let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.

8 And they took him, and killed *him* and cast *him* out of the
vineyard.

9 What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and
destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.

10 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they
perceived that he spake of them.

11 But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude,
because they took him for a prophet.
