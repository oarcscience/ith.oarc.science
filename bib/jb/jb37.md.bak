### XXXIII.

<span class="small">*Love God and Thy Neighbour; Parable of the
Samaritan*.</span>

AND, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master,
what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

2 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?

3 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all
thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.

4 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou
shalt live.

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

5 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my
neighbour?

6 And Jesus answering said, A certain *man* went down from Jerusalem to
Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and
wounded *him*, and departed, leaving *him* half dead.

7 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he
saw him he passed by on the other side.

8 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked *on
him*, and passed by on the other side.

9 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when
he saw him, he had compassion *on him*,

10 And went to *him*, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine,
and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care
of him.

11 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave
*them* to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever
thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

12 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that
fell among the thieves?

13 And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him,
Go, and do thou likewise.
