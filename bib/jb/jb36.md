### XXXII.

<span class="small">*The Good Shepherd*.</span>

VERILY, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into
the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a
robber.

2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he
calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.

4 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the
sheep follow him; for they know his voice.

5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they
know not the voice of strangers.

6 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the
sheep.

7 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep
are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and
the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

8 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the
sheep.

9 I am the good shepherd, and know my *sheep*, and am known of mine.

10 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must
bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, *and*
one shepherd.
