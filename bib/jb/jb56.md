### LII.

<span class="small">*The Two Commandments*.</span>

AND one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together,
and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the
first commandment of all?

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

2 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments *is*, Hear,
O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:

3 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all
thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this *is*
the first commandment.

4 And the second *is* like, *namely* this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour
as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.

5 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

6 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth:
for there is one God; and there is none other but he:

7 And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding,
and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love *his*
neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and
sacrifices.
