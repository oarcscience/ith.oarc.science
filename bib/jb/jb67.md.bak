### LXIII.

<span class="small">*Judas Conducts the Officers to Jesus*.</span>

WHEN Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over
the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his
disciples.

2 And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes
resorted thither with his disciples.

3 Judas then, having received a band of *men* and officers from the
chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches
and weapons.

4 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall
kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.

5 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed
him.

6 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came
they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
