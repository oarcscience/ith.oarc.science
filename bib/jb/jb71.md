### LXVII.

<span class="small">*Receives Him Back, Scourges and Delivers Him to
Execution*.</span>

AND Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers
and the people,

2 Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that
perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined *him* before you,
have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse
him:

3 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of
death is done unto him.

4 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.

5 ¶ Now at *that* feast the governor was wont to release unto the people
a prisoner, whom they would.

6 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.

7 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them,
Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called
Christ?

8 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.

9 ¶ When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him,
saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered
many things this day in a dream because of him.

10 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they
should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.

11 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will
ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.

12 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is
called Christ? *They* all say unto him, Let him be crucified.

13 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried
out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.

14 Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus,
he delivered *him* to be crucified.
