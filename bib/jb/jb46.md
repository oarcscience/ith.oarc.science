### XLII.

<span class="small">*Parables of the Widow and Judge, the Pharisee and
Publican*.</span>

AND he spake a parable unto them *to this end*, that men ought always to
pray, and not to faint;

2 Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither
regarded man:

3 And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying,
Avenge me of mine adversary.

4 And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself,
Though I fear not God, nor regard man,

5 Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her
continual coming she weary me.

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

6 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.

7 And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto
him, though he bear long with them?

8 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the
Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?

9 ¶ And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves
that they were righteous, and despised others:

10 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the
other a publican.

11 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee
that I am not as other men *are*, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or
even as this publican.

12 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.

13 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as
*his* eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be
merciful to me a sinner.

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified *rather* than
the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he
that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
