### XXIII.

<span class="small">*Parable of New Wine in Old Bottles*.</span>

AND he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new
garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and
the piece that was *taken* out of the new agreeth not with the old.

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

2 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will
burst the bottles, and be spilled and the bottles shall perish.

3 But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.

4 No man also having drunk old *wine* straightway desireth new: for he
saith, The old is better.
