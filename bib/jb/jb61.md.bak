### LVII.

<span class="small">*Parable of the Ten Virgins*.</span>

THEN shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took
their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.

3 They that *were* foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:

4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.

5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.

6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh;
go ye out to meet him.

7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.

8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps
are gone out.

9 But the wise answered, saying, *Not so;* lest there be not enough for
us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.

10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were
ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.

11 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to
us.

12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.

13 Watch, therefore, for ye know neither the clay nor the hour wherein
the Son of man cometh.
