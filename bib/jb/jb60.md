### LVI.

<span class="small">*The Faithful and Wise Servant*.</span>

WHO then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler
over his household, to give them meat in due season?

2 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so
doing.

3 Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his
goods.

4 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth
his coming;

5 And shall begin to smite *his* fellow-servants, and to eat and drink
with the drunken;

6 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for
*him*, and in an hour that he is not aware of,

7 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint *him* his portion with the
hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
