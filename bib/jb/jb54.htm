<p align="center"><small><i>Parable of the King and the Wedding</i>.</small></p>  
<p>AND Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,</p>  
<p>2 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son;</p>  
<p><a name="page_124"><font size="1" color="green">p. 124</font></A></p>  
<p>3 And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding; and they would not come.</p>  
<p>4 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and <i>my</i> fatlings <i>are</i> killed, and all things <i>are</i> ready: come unto the marriage.</p>  
<p>5 But they made light of <i>it</i>, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:</p>  
<p>6 And the remnant took his servants, and entreated <i>them</i> spitefully, and slew <i>them</i>.</p>  
<p>7 But when the king heard <i>thereof</i>, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</p>  
<p>8 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.</p>  
<p>9 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.</p>  
<p>10 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good; and the wedding was furnished with guests.</p>  
<p><a name="page_125"><font size="1" color="green">p. 125</font></A></p>  
<p>11 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:</p>  
<p>12 And he saith unto him, Friend, how earnest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</p>  
<p>13 Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away and cast <i>him</i> into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>  
<p>14 For many are called, but few <i>are</i> chosen.</p>
