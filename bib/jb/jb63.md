### LIX.

<span class="small">*The Day of Judgment*.</span>

AND take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged
with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that
day come upon you unawares.

2 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the
whole earth.

3 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy
to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before
the Son of man.

4 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels
with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:

5 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate
them one from another, as a shepherd divideth *his* sheep from the
goats:

6 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the
left.

7 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed
of my Father, inherit

the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:

8 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave
me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:

9 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was, in
prison, and ye came unto me.

10 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee
an hungred, and fed *thee?* or thirsty, and gave *thee* drink?

11 When saw we thee a stranger, and took *thee* in? or naked, and
clothed *thee?*

12 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?

13 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you,
Inasmuch as ye have done *it* unto one of the least of these my
brethren, ye have done *it* unto me.

14 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye
cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:

15 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye
gave me no drink:

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

16 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me
not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.

17 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an
hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and
did not minister unto thee?

18 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily, I say unto you, Inasmuch
as ye did *it* not to one of the least of these, ye did *it* not to me.

19 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the
righteous into life eternal.
