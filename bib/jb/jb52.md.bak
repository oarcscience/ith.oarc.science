### XLVIII.

<span class="small">*Parable of the Two Sons*.</span>

AND they came again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple,
there came to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,

2 And they answered Jesus and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto
them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.

3 But what think ye? A *certain* man had two sons; and he came to the
first, and said, Son, go work today in my vineyard.

4 He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.

5 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said
I *go*, sir: and went not.

6 Whether of them twain did the will of *his* father? They say unto him,
The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the
publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
