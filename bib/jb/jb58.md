### LIV.

<span class="small">*The Widow's Mite*.</span>

AND Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast
money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.

2 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which
make a farthing.

3 And he called *unto him* his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I
say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they
which have cast into the treasury:

4 For all *they* did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did
cast in all that she had, *even* all her living.
