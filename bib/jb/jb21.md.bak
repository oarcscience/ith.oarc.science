### XVII.

<span class="small">*Parable of the Fig Tree*.</span>

HE spake also this parable; A certain *man* had a fig tree planted in
his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.

2 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three
years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down;
why cumbereth it the ground?

3 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also,
till I shall dig about it, and dung *it:*

4 And if it bear fruit, *well:* and if not, *then* after that thou shalt
cut it down.
