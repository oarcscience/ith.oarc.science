### XXXIX.

<span class="small">*Parable of the Unjust Steward*.</span>

AND he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which
had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his
goods.

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

2 And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of
thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer
steward.

3 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord
taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.

4 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship,
they may receive me into their houses.

5 So he called every one of his lord's debtors *unto him*, and said unto
the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?

6 And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take
thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.

7 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An
hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and
write fourscore.

8 And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely;
for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the
children of light.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

9 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of
unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into
everlasting habitations.

10 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much:
and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.

11 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who
will commit to your trust the true *riches?*

12 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who
shall give you that which is your own?

13 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,
and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the
other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

14 ¶ And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things:
and they derided him.

15 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before
men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed
among men is abomination in the sight of God.
