### XLIV.

<span class="small">*Parable of the Labourers in the Vineyard*.</span>

FOR the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man *that is* an householder,
which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.

2 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent
them into his vineyard.

3 And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in
the marketplace,

4 And said unto them: Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is
right I will give you. And they went their way.

5 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

6 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing
idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?

7 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them,
Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, *that* shall ye
receive.

8 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his
steward, Call the labourers, and give them *their* hire, beginning from
the last unto the first.

9 And when they came that *were hired* about the eleventh hour, they
received every man a penny.

10 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received
more; and they likewise received every man a penny.

11 And when they had received *it*, they murmured against the goodman of
the house,

12 Saying, These last have wrought *but* one hour, and thou hast made
them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

13 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong;
didst thou not agree with me for a penny?

14 Take *that* thine *is* and go thy way: I will give unto this last,
even as unto thee.

15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye
evil, because I am good?

16 So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called,
but few chosen.
