*The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth (the Jefferson Bible)*, by
Thomas Jefferson, \[1902\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

### PREFACE.

In 1803, while "overwhelmed with other business," Mr. Jefferson cut from
the evangelists such passages as he believed would best present the
ethical teaching of Jesus, and "arranged them, on the pages of a blank
book, in a certain order of time or subject." He called it "The
Philosophy of Jesus of Nazareth, extracted from the account of his life
and doctrines, as given by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John; being an
abridgment of the New Testament for the use of the Indians,
unembarrassed with matters of fact or faith beyond the level of their
comprehension." In a letter to his friend, Mr. Charles Thompson, after
describing this work, he said: "If I had time I would add to my little
book the Greek, Latin and French texts in columns, side by side." Some
time afterwards he carried out the design thus expressed, giving the
texts in the four languages, "in a handsome morocco-bound volume,
labeled on the back 'Morals of Jesus.'" This is the volume called "The
Jefferson Bible," which is now owned by the Government, and the
publication of which has been recently ordered by Congress. While this
volume was still in the possession of Mr. Jefferson's oldest grandson,
Colonel Thomas Jefferson Randolph, an accurate copy of its table of
contents was made, and from that copy the English text is reproduced in
the following pages. As a fit introduction to it, a letter to Dr.
Benjamin Rush, and a comparison of the doctrines of Jesus with those of
others, are published, giving, perhaps, the fullest expression of his
religious views ever made by Mr. Jefferson himself.
