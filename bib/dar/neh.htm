<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to  pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in  Shushan the fortress,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and [certain] men  of Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews that had  escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning  Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;And they said to me, Those who remain, that are left of the  captivity there in the province, are in great affliction and  reproach; and the wall of Jerusalem is in ruins, and its gates  are burned with fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat  and wept, and mourned for days, and fasted, and prayed before  the God of the heavens,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;and said, I beseech thee, Jehovah, God of the heavens, the  great and terrible &#249;God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for  them that love him and keep his commandments.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, to hear  the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this  time, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants,  confessing the sins of the children of Israel, which we have  sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;We have acted very perversely against thee, and have not  kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances  that thou commandedst thy servant Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy  servant Moses, saying, If ye act unfaithfully, I will scatter  you among the peoples;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;but if ye return to me, and keep my commandments and do  them, though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part  of the heavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will  bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name  there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;And they are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast  redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to  the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants  who delight to fear thy name; and prosper, I pray thee, thy  servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.  Now I was the king's cupbearer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth  year of Artaxerxes the king, [that] wine was before him, and I  took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now, I had never been  sad in his presence.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;And the king said to me, Why is thy face sad, seeing thou  art not sick? this is nothing else but sadness of heart. And I  was very sore afraid.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And I said to the king, Let the king live for ever! Why  should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of  my fathers' sepulchres, lies waste, and its gates are consumed  with fire?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;And the king said to me, For what dost thou make request? So  I prayed to the God of the heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;And I said to the king, If it please the king, and if thy  servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send  me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may  build it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;And the king said to me -- the queen also sitting by him, --  For how long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return?  And it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;And I said to the king, If it please the king, let letters  be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may  set me forward till I come into Judah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that  he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace  which [appertains] to the house, and for the wall of the city,  and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted  me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;And I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them  the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of a force  and horsemen with me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobijah the servant,  the Ammonite, heard [of it], it grieved them exceedingly that  there had come a man to seek the welfare of the children of  Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;And I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me -- but  I told no man what my God had put in my heart to do for  Jerusalem -- and there was no beast with me, except the beast  that I rode upon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And I went out by night by the valley-gate, even toward the  jackal-fountain, and to the dung-gate; and I viewed the walls  of Jerusalem, which were in ruins, and its gates were consumed  with fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;And I went on to the fountain-gate, and to the king's pool;  and there was no place for the beast under me to pass.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;And I went up in the night through the valley, and viewed  the wall, and turned back, and entered by the valley-gate and  returned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;And the rulers did not know whither I went or what I did,  for I had not as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests,  nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did  the work.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;And I said to them, Ye see the distress that we are in,  that Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire.  Come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no  more a reproach.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;And I told them of the hand of my God which had been good  upon me; as also of the king's words which he had said unto me.  And they said, Let us rise up and build. And they strengthened  their hands for the good [work].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;And Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobijah the servant, the  Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it; and they mocked us  and despised us, and said, What is this thing which ye do? will  ye rebel against the king?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;And I answered them, and said to them, The God of the  heavens, he will prosper us, and we his servants will arise and  build; but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial in  Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;And Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the  priests, and they built the sheep-gate. They hallowed it, and  set up its doors; and they hallowed it even to the tower of  Meah, to the tower of Hananeel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;And next to them built the men of Jericho. And next to them  built Zaccur the son of Imri.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;And the fish-gate did the sons of Senaah build: they laid  its beams, and set up its doors, its locks and its bars.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;And next to them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the  son of Koz. And next to them repaired Meshullam the son of  Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel. And next to them repaired  Zadok the son of Baana.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;And next to them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put  not their necks to the work of their Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;And the gate of the old [wall] repaired Jehoiada the son of  Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodiah; they laid its beams,  and set up its doors, and its locks, and its bars.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;And next to them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon  the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon and of Mizpah, to the seat  of the governor on this side the river.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;Next to them repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the  goldsmiths; and next to him repaired Hananiah of the perfumers,  and they left Jerusalem [in its state] as far as the broad  wall.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;And next to them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler  of the half part of Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;And next to them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even  over against his house. And next to him repaired Hattush the  son of Hashabniah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;Malchijah the son of Harim and Hasshub the son of  Pahath-Moab repaired a second piece, and the tower of the  furnaces.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;And next to them repaired Shallum the son of Hallohesh, the  ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;The valley-gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of  Zanoah; they built it, and set up its doors, its locks and its  bars, and a thousand cubits of the wall as far as the  dung-gate.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;And the dung-gate repaired Malchijah the son of Rechab, the  chief of the district of Beth-haccerem; he built it, and set up  its doors, its locks and its bars.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;And the fountain-gate repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh,  the chief of the district of Mizpah; he built it, and covered  it, and set up its doors, its locks and its bars, and the wall  of the pool of Shelah by the king's garden, and to the stairs  that go down from the city of David.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the chief of  the half district of Beth-zur, even over against the sepulchres  of David, and to the pool that was made, and to the house of  the mighty [men].</p>

<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece,  from the house of Azariah to the angle, as far as the corner.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;Palal the son of Uzai, over against the angle, and the high  tower that lies out from the king's house, which was by the  court of the prison. After him, Pedaiah the son of Parosh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;(Now the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel, even over against the  water-gate toward the east, and the tower which lies out.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:27">3:27</A>&nbsp;After him the Tekoites repaired a second piece, over  against the great tower which lies out, as far as the wall of  Ophel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:28">3:28</A>&nbsp;From above the horse-gate repaired the priests, every one  over against his house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:29">3:29</A>&nbsp;After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his  house. And after him repaired also Shemaiah the son of  Shechaniah, the keeper of the east gate.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_3:31">3:31</A>&nbsp;After him repaired Malchijah of the goldsmiths to the place  of the Nethinim and of the dealers, over against the gate  Miphkad, and to the ascent of the corner.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:32">3:32</A>&nbsp;And between the ascent of the corner and the sheep-gate  repaired the goldsmiths and the dealers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass that when Sanballat heard that we built  the wall, he was angry and very indignant, and mocked the Jews.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria,  and said, What do these feeble Jews? shall they be permitted to  go on? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day?  Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, when  they are burned?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;And Tobijah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that  which they build, if a fox went up, it would break down their  stone wall. --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;Hear, our God, for we are despised, and turn their reproach  upon their own head, and give them for a prey in a land of  captivity!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be  blotted out from before thee; for they have provoked the  builders.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;But we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together  to the half thereof; for the people had a mind to work.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobijah, and the  Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the  walls of Jerusalem were being repaired, that the breaches began  to be stopped, then they were very wroth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;and conspired all of them together to come to fight against  Jerusalem, and to hinder it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;Then we prayed to our God, and set a watch against them day  and night, because of them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens  faileth, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to  build at the wall.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see,  till we come into the midst of them and kill them, and put an  end to the work.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass that when the Jews that dwelt by them  came and told us so ten times, from all the places whence they  returned to us,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;I set in the lower places behind the wall in exposed  places, I even set the people, according to their families,  with their swords, their spears and their bows.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;And I looked, and rose up, and said to the nobles, and to  the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not afraid of  them: remember the Lord who is great and terrible, and fight  for your brethren, your sons and your daughters, your wives and  your houses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass that when our enemies heard that it was  known to us, and that God had defeated their counsel, we  returned all of us to the wall, every one to his work.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;And from that time forth the half of my servants wrought in  the work, and the other half of them held the spears, and the  shields, and the bows, and the corslets; and the captains were  behind all the house of Judah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;They that built on the wall, and they that bore burdens,  with those that loaded, wrought in the work with one hand, and  with the other they held a weapon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;And the builders had every one his sword girded by his  side, and built. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;And I said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the  rest of the people, The work is great and extended, and we are  scattered upon the wall, one far from another:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;in what place ye hear the sound of the trumpet, thither  shall ye assemble to us; our God will fight for us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;And we laboured in the work; and half of them held the  spears from the rising of the dawn till the stars appeared.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;Likewise at the same time I said to the people, Let every  one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night  they may be a guard to us, and [be for] labour in the day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;And neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the  men of the guard that followed me, none of us put off our  garments: every one had his weapon on his right side.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives  against their brethren the Jews.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;And there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters,  are many, and we must procure corn that we may eat and live.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;And there were that said, We have had to pledge our fields,  and our vineyards, and our houses, that we might procure corn  in the dearth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;And there were that said, We have borrowed money for the  king's tribute upon our fields and vineyards;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our  children as their children; and behold, we must bring into  bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of  our daughters are brought into bondage [already]; neither is it  in the power of our hand [to redeem them], for other men have  our fields and our vineyards.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;And I consulted with myself; and I remonstrated with the  nobles and the rulers, and said to them, Ye exact usury, every  one of his brother! And I set a great assembly against them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;And I said to them, We, according to our ability, have  redeemed our brethren the Jews, who were sold to the nations;  and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto  us? And they were silent and found no answer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;And I said, The thing that ye do is not good. Ought ye not  to walk in the fear of our God, so as not to be the reproach of  the nations our enemies?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;I also, my brethren and my servants, we might exact usury  of them, money and corn. I pray you, let us leave off this  usury.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;Restore, I pray you, to them this very day their fields,  their vineyards, their olive-gardens, and their houses, also  the hundredth [part] of the money, and of the corn, the wine  and the oil, that ye have exacted of them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;And they said, We will restore [them], and will require  nothing of them; so will we do, as thou hast said. And I called  the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do  according to this promise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man  from his house and from his earnings, that performeth not this  promise: even thus be he shaken out and emptied! And all the  congregation said, Amen! And they praised Jehovah. And the  people did according to this promise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their  governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to  the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, twelve years, I  and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;But the former governors that were before me had been  chargeable to the people, and had taken of them bread and wine,  besides forty shekels of silver: even their servants bore rule  over the people. But I did not so, because of the fear of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;Yea, also I applied myself to this work of the wall, and we  bought no fields; and all my servants were gathered thither for  the work.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;And there were at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jews  and the rulers, besides those that came to us from among the  nations that were about us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;And that which was prepared daily was one ox [and] six  choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten  days all sorts of wine in abundance. Yet for all this I  demanded not the bread of the governor; for the service was  heavy upon this people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;Remember for me, my God, for good, all that I have done for  this people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobijah, and Geshem  the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had  built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it (though  at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates),</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us  meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono. But they  thought to do me mischief.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;And I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great  work, and I cannot come down. Why should the work cease, whilst  I leave it and come down to you?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;And they sent to me four times after this sort; and I  answered them in the same manner.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;Then sent Sanballat his servant to me in this manner the  fifth time, with an open letter in his hand,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;in which was written: It is reported among the nations, and  Gashmu says [it, that] thou and the Jews think to rebel, for  which cause thou buildest the wall, and according to these  words thou wilt become their king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;And thou hast also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning  thee at Jerusalem saying, There is a king in Judah! And now it  will be reported to the king according to these words. Come now  therefore, and let us take counsel together.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;And I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done as  thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands  shall be slackened from the work, that it be not carried out.  -- Now therefore strengthen my hands!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;And I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the  son of Mehetabeel, who had shut himself up. And he said, Let us  meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let  us shut the doors of the temple; for they are coming to kill  thee; even in the night are they coming to kill thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there,  that, being as I am, could go into the temple, and live? I will  not go in.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;And I perceived, and behold, God had not sent him; for he  pronounced this prophecy against me; and Tobijah and Sanballat  had hired him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so,  and sin, and that they might have wherewith to spread an evil  report, that they might reproach me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;My God, remember Tobijah and Sanballat according to these  their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of  the prophets who would have put me in fear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in  fifty-two days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass that when all our enemies heard [of  it], all the nations that were about us were afraid and were  much cast down in their own eyes, and they perceived that this  work was wrought by our God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many  letters to Tobijah, and those of Tobijah came to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;For there were many in Judah sworn to him; for he was a  son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan  had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported  my words to him. [And] Tobijah sent letters to put me in fear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass when the wall was built, and I had set  up the doors, that the doorkeepers and the singers and the  Levites were appointed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;And I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the  citadel, charge over Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man and  feared God above many.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;And I said to them that the gates of Jerusalem should not be  opened until the sun was hot, and that they should shut the  doors and bar them while they stood by; and that there should  be appointed watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one  in his watch, and every one over against his house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;Now the city was large and great; but the people in it were  few, and no houses were built.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;And my God put into my heart to gather together the nobles,  and the rulers, and the people, for registration by genealogy.  And I found a genealogical register of those that had come up  at the first, and I found written in it:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;These are the children of the province that went up out of  the captivity of those that had been carried away, whom  Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who  came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one to his city;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;all the people gathered together as one man to the open  place that was before the water-gate; and they spoke to Ezra  the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah  had commanded Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation,  both of men and women, and all that could hear with  understanding, on the first day of the seventh month.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;And he read in it before the open place that was before the  water-gate from the morning until midday, in presence of the  men and the women, and those that could understand. And the  ears of all the people were [attentive] to the book of the law.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;And Ezra the scribe stood upon a high stage of wood, which  they had made for the purpose. And beside him stood Mattithiah,  and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkijah, and Maaseiah  on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael,  and Malchijah, and Hashum, and Hashbaddana, Zechariah,  Meshullam.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for  he was above all the people; and when he opened it, all the  people stood up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;And Ezra blessed Jehovah, the great God; and all the people  answered, Amen, Amen! with lifting up of their hands; and they  bowed their heads, and worshipped Jehovah with their faces to  the ground.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;And Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub,  Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan,  Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the  law; and the people [stood] in their place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;And they read in the law of God distinctly out of the book,  and gave the sense, and caused [them] to understand the  reading.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;And Nehemiah, that is, the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest  the scribe, and the Levites that explained to the people, said  to all the people, This day is holy to Jehovah your God: mourn  not, nor weep. For all the people wept when they heard the  words of the law.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink  the sweet, and send portions to them for whom nothing is  prepared; for the day is holy to our Lord; and be not grieved,  for the joy of Jehovah is your strength.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;And the Levites quieted all the people, saying, Be still!  for the day is holy; neither be grieved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;And all the people went their way, to eat and to drink, and  to send portions, and to make great rejoicing. For they had  understood the words that were declared to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;And on the second day were gathered together the chief  fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, to  Ezra the scribe, even to gain wisdom as to the words of the  law.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;And they found written in the law which Jehovah had  commanded through Moses, that the children of Israel should  dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;and that they should publish and proclaim through all their  cities, and at Jerusalem, saying, Go forth to the mount, and  fetch olive-branches, and wild olive-branches, and  myrtle-branches, and palm-branches, and branches of thick  trees, to make booths, as it is written.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;And the people went forth and brought [them], and made  themselves booths, everyone upon the roof of his house, and in  their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the  open space of the water-gate, and in the open space of the gate  of Ephraim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;And all the congregation of them that had come back from  the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths. For since  the days of Jeshua the son of Nun until that day had not the  children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he  read in the book of the law of God. And they observed the feast  seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly,  according to the ordinance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;And on the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of  Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and  earth upon them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all  foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins, and the  iniquities of their fathers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of  the law of Jehovah their God a fourth part of the day; and a  fourth part they confessed, and worshipped Jehovah their God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;Then stood up upon the platform of the Levites, Jeshua, and  Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, Chenani, and  cried with a loud voice to Jehovah their God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;And the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah,  Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, Pethahiah, said, Stand up, bless  Jehovah your God from eternity to eternity. And let [men] bless  the name of thy glory, which is exalted above all blessing and  praise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;Thou art the Same, thou alone, Jehovah, who hast made the  heaven of heavens, and all their host, the earth and all that  is therein, the seas and all that is therein. And thou  quickenest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;Thou art the Same, Jehovah Elohim, who didst choose Abram  and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest  him the name of Abraham;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;and foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest the  covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the  Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites,  and the Girgashites, -- to give it to his seed; and thou hast  performed thy words, for thou art righteous.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and  heardest their cry by the Red Sea;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;and didst shew signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and upon all  his servants, and upon all the people of his land; for thou  knewest that they dealt proudly against them, and thou didst  make thee a name, as it is this day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;And thou didst divide the sea before them, and they went  through the midst of the sea on dry [ground]; and their  pursuers thou threwest into the depths, as a stone into the  mighty waters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;And thou leddest them in the day by a pillar of cloud, and  in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way  wherein they should go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;And thou camest down on mount Sinai, and didst speak with  them from the heavens, and gavest them right judgments and true  laws, good statutes and commandments.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;And thou madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and  prescribedst for them commandments and statutes and a law,  through Moses thy servant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;And thou gavest them bread from the heavens for their  hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for  their thirst, and didst say to them that they should go in to  possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;But they, our fathers, dealt proudly, and hardened their  neck, and hearkened not to thy commandments,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;and refused to obey, neither were they mindful of thy  wonders which thou hadst done among them; but hardened their  neck, and in their rebellion made a captain to return to their  bondage. But thou art a +God ready to forgive, gracious and  merciful, slow to anger and of great loving-kindness, and thou  forsookest them not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This  is thy god that brought thee up out of Egypt! and they had  wrought great provocation,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:19">9:19</A>&nbsp;yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the  wilderness. The pillar of the cloud departed not from over them  by day, to lead them on the way; neither the pillar of fire by  night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:20">9:20</A>&nbsp;Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to instruct them, and  withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them  water for their thirst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:21">9:21</A>&nbsp;Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness;  they lacked nothing; their clothes grew not old, and their feet  swelled not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:22">9:22</A>&nbsp;And thou gavest them kingdoms and peoples, and didst divide  them by countries; and they possessed the land of Sihon, as  well the land of the king of Heshbon, as the land of Og king of  Bashan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:23">9:23</A>&nbsp;And their children thou didst multiply as the stars of  heaven, and thou broughtest them into the land concerning which  thou didst say to their fathers that they should go in to  possess it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:24">9:24</A>&nbsp;And the children went in and possessed the land; and thou  subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the  Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, both their kings  and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as  they would.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:25">9:25</A>&nbsp;And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed  houses full of all good things, wells digged, vineyards and  olive-gardens, and fruit trees in abundance. And they did eat  and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in  thy great goodness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:26">9:26</A>&nbsp;But they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and  cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets who  testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought  great provocations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:27">9:27</A>&nbsp;And thou gavest them into the hand of their oppressors, and  they oppressed them; and in the time of their distress, when  they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from the heavens, and  according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours,  who saved them out of the hand of their oppressors.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:28">9:28</A>&nbsp;But when they had rest, they did evil again before thee;  and thou didst leave them in the hand of their enemies, and  they had dominion over them; and again they cried unto thee,  and thou heardest [them] from the heavens, and many times didst  thou deliver them, according to thy mercies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:29">9:29</A>&nbsp;And thou testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring  them again unto thy law; but they dealt proudly, and hearkened  not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thine ordinances  (which if a man do, he shall live in them); and they withdrew  the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:30">9:30</A>&nbsp;And many years didst thou forbear with them, and  testifiedst against them by thy Spirit through thy prophets;  but they would not give ear: and thou gavest them into the hand  of the peoples of the lands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:31">9:31</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless for thy manifold mercies' sake, thou didst not  make a full end of them nor forsake them; for thou art a  gracious and merciful &#249;God.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;had prepared for him a great chamber, where formerly they  laid the oblations, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the  tithes of the corn, the new wine and the oil, which was  commanded for the Levites and the singers and the doorkeepers,  and the heave-offerings of the priests.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;And during all that [time] I was not at Jerusalem; for in  the two-and-thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I came  to the king; and after some time I obtained leave of the king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:7">13:7</A>&nbsp;And I came to Jerusalem, and observed the evil that  Eliashib had done for Tobijah, in preparing him a chamber in  the courts of the house of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:8">13:8</A>&nbsp;And it grieved me much, and I cast forth all the household  stuff of Tobijah out of the chamber.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:9">13:9</A>&nbsp;And I commanded, and they purified the chambers; and  thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, the  oblation and the frankincense.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:10">13:10</A>&nbsp;And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not  been given, and that the Levites and the singers that did the  work had fled every one to his field.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:11">13:11</A>&nbsp;Then I contended with the rulers, and said, Why is the  house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together and set  them in their place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:12">13:12</A>&nbsp;And all Judah brought the tithe of the corn and the new  wine and the oil into the storehouses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:13">13:13</A>&nbsp;And I made storekeepers over the storehouses: Shelemiah  the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah;  and subordinate to them, Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of  Mattaniah; for they were esteemed faithful, and their office  was to distribute to their brethren.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:14">13:14</A>&nbsp;Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out  my good deeds which I have done for the house of my God, and  for the charges thereof!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:15">13:15</A>&nbsp;In those days I saw in Judah some treading winepresses on  the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading them on asses;  as also wine, grapes and figs, and all manner of burdens; and  they brought them into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I  protested in the day on which they sold the victuals.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:16">13:16</A>&nbsp;Men of Tyre also dwelt therein, who brought fish and all  manner of ware, and sold it on the sabbath to the children of  Judah, and in Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:17">13:17</A>&nbsp;And I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to  them, What evil thing is this which ye do, profaning the  sabbath day?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:18">13:18</A>&nbsp;Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all  this evil upon us and upon this city? And ye will bring more  wrath against Israel by profaning the sabbath.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:19">13:19</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that when it began to be dark in the  gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I commanded that the  gates should be shut; and I commanded that they should not be  opened till after the sabbath. And I set [some] of my servants  at the gates, so that no burden should be brought in on the  sabbath day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:20">13:20</A>&nbsp;And the dealers and sellers of all kind of ware passed the  night without Jerusalem once or twice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:21">13:21</A>&nbsp;And I testified against them, and said to them, Why do ye  pass the night before the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay  hands on you. From that time forth they came not on the  sabbath.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:22">13:22</A>&nbsp;And I commanded the Levites that they should purify  themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to  hallow the sabbath day. Remember this also for me, my God, and  spare me according to thy great loving-kindness!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:23">13:23</A>&nbsp;In those days also I saw Jews that had married wives of  Ashdod, of Ammon, [and] of Moab.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:24">13:24</A>&nbsp;And their children spoke half in the language of Ashdod,  and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the  language of each people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:25">13:25</A>&nbsp;And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote  certain of them and plucked off their hair, and adjured them by  God [saying], Ye shall not give your daughters to their sons,  nor take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:26">13:26</A>&nbsp;Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet  among the many nations was there no king like him, who was  beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel; but  even him did foreign wives cause to sin.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:27">13:27</A>&nbsp;And should we hearken to you to do all this great evil, to  act unfaithfully to our God by marrying foreign wives?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:28">13:28</A>&nbsp;And [one] of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the  high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite; and I  chased him from me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:29">13:29</A>&nbsp;Remember them, my God, for they are polluters of the  priesthood, and of the covenant of the priesthood and of the  Levites!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:30">13:30</A>&nbsp;And I purified them from all foreigners, and appointed the  charges of the priests and the Levites, every one in his  service;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:31">13:31</A>&nbsp;and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the  first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good!</p>
