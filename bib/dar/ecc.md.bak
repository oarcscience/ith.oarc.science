### Darby Bible: Ecclesiastes

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The words of the Preacher, the son of
David, king in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher,
vanity of vanities! all is vanity.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> What profit hath man of all his labour
wherewith he laboureth under the sun?

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> \[One\] generation passeth away, and
\[another\] generation cometh, but the earth standeth for ever.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> The sun also riseth, and the sun goeth
down, and hasteth to its place where it ariseth.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> The wind goeth towards the south, and
turneth about towards the north: it turneth about continually, and the
wind returneth again to its circuits.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> All the rivers run into the sea, yet the
sea is not full: unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go
again.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> All things are full of toil; none can
express it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled
with hearing.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> That which hath been is that which shall
be; and that which hath been done is that which will be done: and there
is nothing new under the sun.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Is there a thing whereof it may be said,
See, this is new? It hath been already in the ages which were before us.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> There is no remembrance of former things;
neither shall there be remembrance of things that are to come with those
who shall live afterwards.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> And I applied my heart to seek and search
out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the heavens: this
grievous occupation hath God given to the children of men to weary
themselves therewith.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> I have seen all the works that are done
under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and pursuit of the wind.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> That which is crooked cannot be made
straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> I communed with mine own heart, saying,
Lo, I have become great and have acquired wisdom more than all they that
have been before me over Jerusalem; and my heart hath seen much of
wisdom and knowledge.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> And I applied my heart to the knowledge
of wisdom, and to the knowledge of madness and folly: I perceived that
this also is a striving after the wind.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> For in much wisdom is much vexation, and
he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> I said in my heart, Come now, I will try
thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure. But behold, this also is
vanity.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> I said of laughter, Madness! and of mirth,
What availeth it?

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> I searched in my heart how to cherish my
flesh with wine, while practising my heart with wisdom; and how to lay
hold on folly, till I should see what was that good for the children of
men which they should do under the heavens all the days of their life.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> I made me great works; I builded me houses;
I planted me vineyards;

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> I made me gardens and parks, and I planted
trees in them of every kind of fruit;

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> I made me ponds of water, to water
therewith the wood, where the trees are reared.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> I acquired servants and maidens, and had
servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and
flocks, above all that had been in Jerusalem before me.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> I gathered me also silver and gold, and the
peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces; I got me men-singers
and women-singers, and the delights of the children of men, a wife and
concubines.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> And I became great, and increased more than
all that had been before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with
me.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept
not from them: I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart
rejoiced in all my labour, and this was my portion from all my labour.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Then I looked on all the works that my
hands had wrought, and on the labour that it had cost me to do \[them\];
and behold, all was vanity and pursuit of the wind, and there was no
profit under the sun.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and
madness, and folly; for what shall the man \[do\] that cometh after the
king? -- that which hath already been done.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as
light excelleth darkness.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> The wise man's eyes are in his head, and
the fool walketh in darkness; but I myself also perceived that one event
happeneth to them all.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> And I said in my heart, As it happeneth
to the fool so will it happen even to me; and why was I then so wise?
Then I said in my heart that this also is vanity.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> For there shall be no remembrance of the
wise more than of the fool for ever; because everything is already
forgotten in the days which come. And how dieth the wise even as the
fool?

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> And I hated life; for the work that is
wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and
pursuit of the wind.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> And I hated all my labour wherewith I had
been toiling under the sun, because I should leave it unto the man that
shall be after me.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> And who knoweth whether he will be a wise
\[man\] or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour at which I
have laboured, and wherein I have been wise under the sun. This also is
vanity.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> Then I went about to cause my heart to
despair of all the labour wherewith I had laboured under the sun.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> For there is a man whose labour hath been
with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skill, and who leaveth it to a
man that hath not laboured therein, to be his portion. This also is
vanity and a great evil.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> For what will man have of all his labour
and of the striving of his heart, wherewith he hath wearied himself
under the sun?

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> For all his days are sorrows, and his
travail vexation: even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also
is vanity.

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> There is nothing good for man, but that
he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in
his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> For who can eat, or who be eager, more
than I?

<span id="an_2:26">2:26</span> For he giveth to a man that is good in
his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth
travail to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good
in God's sight. This also is vanity and pursuit of the wind.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> To everything there is a season, and a time
to every purpose under the heavens:

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> A time to be born, and a time to die; A
time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> A time to kill, and a time to heal; A time
to break down, and a time to build up;

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> A time to weep, and a time to laugh; A time
to mourn, and a time to dance;

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> A time to cast away stones, and a time to
gather stones together; A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from
embracing;

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> A time to seek, and a time to lose; A time
to keep, and a time to cast away;

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> A time to rend, and a time to sew; A time
to keep silence, and a time to speak;

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> A time to love, and a time to hate; A time
of war, and a time of peace.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> What profit hath he that worketh from that
wherein he laboureth?

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> I have seen the travail that God hath
given to the sons of men to toil in.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> He hath made everything beautiful in its
time; also he hath set the world in their heart, so that man findeth not
out from the beginning to the end the work that God doeth.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> I know that there is nothing good for
them but to rejoice and to do well in their life;

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> yea also that every man should eat and
drink, and enjoy good in all his labour, it is the gift of God.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> I know that whatever God doeth, it shall
be for ever; there is nothing to be added to it, nor anything to be
taken from it; and God doeth \[it\], that \[men\] should fear before
him.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> That which is was long ago, and that
which is to be hath already been; and God bringeth back again that which
is past.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> And moreover I saw under the sun, that in
the place of judgment, wickedness was there; and in the place of
righteousness, wickedness was there.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> I said in my heart, God will judge the
righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose
and for every work.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> I said in my heart, It is thus with the
children of men, that God may prove them, and that they should see that
they themselves are but beasts.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> For what befalleth the children of men
befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so
dieth the other, and they have all one breath; and man hath no
pre-eminence above the beast: for all is vanity.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> All go unto one place: all are of the
dust, and all return to dust.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> Who knoweth the spirit of the children of
men? Doth it go upwards? and the spirit of the beasts, doth it go
downwards to the earth?

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> And I have seen that there is nothing
better than that man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his
portion; for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> And I returned and saw all the oppressions
that are done under the sun: and behold, the tears of the oppressed, and
they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors was power,
and they had no comforter.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Then I praised the dead who are already
dead more than the living who are yet alive;

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> and more fortunate than both is he who hath
not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the
sun.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> And I saw all labour, and all success of
work, that it is man's jealousy of his neighbour. This also is vanity
and pursuit of the wind.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> The fool foldeth his hands together, and
eateth his own flesh.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> Better is a handful with quietness, than
both hands full with labour and pursuit of the wind.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> And I returned and saw vanity under the
sun.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> There is one \[alone\] and without a
second; also he hath neither son nor brother: yet is there no end of all
his labour, neither is his eye satisfied with riches, and \[he saith
not\], For whom then am I labouring, and depriving my soul of good? This
also is vanity and a grievous occupation.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> Two are better than one; because they have
a good reward for their labour.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> For if they fall, the one will lift up
his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and who hath
not another to lift him up!

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> Again, if two lie together, then they
have warmth; but how can one alone be warm?

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> And if a \[man\] overpower the one, the
two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> Better is a poor but wise youth than an
old and foolish king, who knoweth no more how to be admonished.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> For out of the prison-house he came forth
to reign, although he was born poor in his kingdom.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> I saw all the living that walk under the
sun, with the child, the second, that should stand up in his stead.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> \[There is\] no end of all the people, of
all that stood before them; those however that come after shall not
rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after the
wind.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house
of God, and draw near to hear, rather than to give the sacrifice of
fools: for they know not that they do evil.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy
heart be hasty to utter anything before God: for God is in the heavens,
and thou upon earth; therefore let thy words be few.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> For a dream cometh through the multitude of
business, and a fool's voice through a multitude of words.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not
to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast
vowed.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> Better is it that thou shouldest not vow,
than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to
sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an inadvertence.
Wherefore should God be wroth at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy
hands?

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> For in the multitude of dreams are
vanities; so with many words: but fear God.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> If thou seest the oppression of the poor,
and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not
at the matter; for a higher than the high is watching, and there are
higher than they.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> Moreover the earth is every way profitable:
the king \[himself\] is dependent upon the field.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> He that loveth silver shall not be
satisfied with silver, nor he that loveth abundance with increase. This
also is vanity.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> When goods increase, they are increased
that eat them; and what profit is there to the owner thereof, except the
beholding \[of them\] with his eyes?

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> The sleep of the labourer is sweet,
whether he have eaten little or much; but the fulness of the rich doth
not suffer him to sleep.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> There is a grievous evil that I have seen
under the sun: riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt;

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> or those riches perish by some evil
circumstance, and if he have begotten a son, there is nothing in his
hand.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> As he came forth from his mother's womb,
naked shall he go away again as he came, and shall take nothing of his
labour, which he may carry away in his hand.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> And this also is a grievous evil, that in
all points as he came so doth he go away, and what profit hath he, in
having laboured for the wind?

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> All his days also he eateth in darkness,
and hath much vexation, and sickness, and irritation.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> Behold what I have seen good and comely:
\[it is\] to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labour
wherewith \[man\] laboureth under the sun, all the days of his life
which God hath given him: for that is his portion.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> Every man also to whom God hath given
riches and wealth, and power to eat thereof, and to take his portion and
to rejoice in his labour: that is a gift of God.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> For he will not much remember the days of
his life, because God answereth \[him\] with the joy of his heart.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> There is an evil that I have seen under the
sun, and it is frequent among men:

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> one to whom God giveth riches, wealth, and
honour, and he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet
God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this
is vanity, and a sore evil.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> If a man beget a hundred \[sons\], and live
many years, so that the days of his years be many, but his soul be not
filled with good, and also he have no burial, I say an untimely birth is
better than he.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> For it cometh in vanity, and departeth in
darkness, and its name is covered with darkness;

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> moreover it hath not seen nor known the
sun: this hath rest rather than the other.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> Yea, though he live twice a thousand years,
yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place?

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> All the labour of man is for his mouth, and
yet the appetite is not filled.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> For what advantage hath the wise above the
fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> Better is the seeing of the eyes than the
wandering of the desire: this also is vanity and pursuit of the wind.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> That which is hath already been named;
and what man is, is known, and that he cannot contend with him that is
mightier than he.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> For there are many things that increase
vanity: what is man advantaged?

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> For who knoweth what is good for man in
life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for
who can tell man what shall be after him under the sun?

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> A \[good\] name is better than precious
ointment, and the day of death than the day of one's birth.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> It is better to go to the house of mourning
than to go to the house of feasting: in that that is the end of all men,
and the living taketh it to heart.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> Vexation is better than laughter; for by
the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> The heart of the wise is in the house of
mourning, but the heart of fools in the house of mirth.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> It is better for a man to hear the rebuke
of the wise, than to hear the song of fools.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> For as the crackling of thorns under a pot,
so is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad,
and a gift destroyeth the heart.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> Better is the end of a thing than its
beginning; better is a patient spirit than a proud spirit.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> Be not hasty in thy spirit to be vexed; for
vexation resteth in the bosom of fools.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> Say not, How is it that the former days
were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning
this.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, and
profitable to them that see the sun.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> For wisdom is a defence \[as\] money is a
defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, \[that\] wisdom maketh them
that possess it to live.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> Consider the work of God; for who can
make straight what he hath made crooked?

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> In the day of prosperity enjoy good, and
in the day of adversity consider: God hath also set the one beside the
other, to the end that man should find out nothing \[of what shall be\]
after him.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> All \[this\] have I seen in the days of
my vanity: there is a righteous \[man\] that perisheth by his
righteousness, and there is a wicked \[man\] that prolongeth \[his
days\] by his wickedness.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> Be not righteous overmuch; neither make
thyself overwise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou
foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> It is good that thou shouldest take hold
of this; yea, also from that withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth
God cometh forth from them all.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than
ten mighty \[men\] that are in a city.

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> Surely there is not a righteous man upon
earth, that doeth good and sinneth not.

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> Also give not heed unto all words that
are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee.

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> For also thine own heart knoweth that
oftentimes thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> All this have I tried by wisdom: I said,
I will be wise; but it was far from me.

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> Whatever hath been, is far off, and
exceeding deep: who will find it out?

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> I turned, I and my heart, to know, and to
search, and to seek out wisdom and reason, and to know wickedness to be
folly, and foolishness to be madness;

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> and I found more bitter than death the
woman whose heart is nets and snares, \[and\] whose hands are bands:
whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be caught
by her.

<span id="an_7:27">7:27</span> See this which I have found, saith the
Preacher, \[searching\] one by one to find out the reason;

<span id="an_7:28">7:28</span> which my soul yet seeketh, and I have not
found: one man among a thousand have I found, but a woman among all
those have I not found.

<span id="an_7:29">7:29</span> Only see this which I have found: that
God made man upright, but they have sought out many devices.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> Who is as the wise? and who knoweth the
explanation of things? A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the
boldness of his face is changed.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> I \[say\], Keep the king's commandment, and
\[that\] on account of the oath of God.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> Be not hasty to go out of his sight;
persist not in an evil thing: for he doeth whatever pleaseth him,

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> because the word of a king is power; and
who may say unto him, What doest thou?

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no
evil thing; and a wise man's heart knoweth time and manner.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> For to every purpose there is time and
manner. For the misery of man is great upon him;

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> for he knoweth not that which shall be; for
who can tell him how it shall be?

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> There is no man who hath control over the
spirit to retain the spirit; and no one hath control over the day of
death; and there is no discharge in that war, neither shall wickedness
deliver those that are given to it.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> All this have I seen, and applied my heart
unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time when man
ruleth man to his hurt.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> And I have also seen the wicked buried
and going away; and such as had acted rightly went from \[the\] holy
place, and were forgotten in the city. This also is vanity.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> Because sentence against an evil work is
not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the children of men is
fully set in them to do evil.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> Though a sinner do evil a hundred times,
and prolong his \[days\], yet I know that it shall be well with them
that fear God, because they fear before him;

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> but it shall not be well with the wicked,
neither shall he prolong \[his\] days as a shadow, because he feareth
not before God.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> There is a vanity which is done upon the
earth; that there are righteous \[men\] unto whom it happeneth according
to the work of the wicked; and there are wicked \[men\] to whom it
happeneth according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also
is vanity.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> And I commended mirth, because there is
nothing better for man under the sun than to eat, and to drink, and to
be merry; for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his
life, which God hath given him under the sun.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> When I applied my heart to know wisdom,
and to see the business that is done upon the earth (for also there is
that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes),

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> then I saw that all \[is\] the work of
God, \[and\] that man cannot find out the work that is done under the
sun: because however man may labour to seek \[it\] out, yet doth he not
find \[it\]; and even, if a wise \[man\] think to know \[it\], he shall
not be able to find \[it\] out.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> For all this I laid to my heart and
\[indeed\] to investigate all this, that the righteous, and the wise,
and their works, are in the hand of God; man knoweth neither love nor
hatred: all is before them.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> All things \[come\] alike to all: one event
to the righteous and to the wicked, to the good, and to the clean, and
to the unclean, to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not:
as is the good, so is the sinner; he that sweareth, as he that feareth
an oath.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> This is an evil among all that is done
under the sun, that one thing befalleth all: yea, also the heart of the
children of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while
they live; and after that, \[they have to go\] to the dead.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> For to him that is joined to all the living
there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> For the living know that they shall die;
but the dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward, for
the memory of them is forgotten.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> Their love also, and their hatred, and
their envy is already perished; neither have they any more for ever a
portion in all that is done under the sun.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> Go, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy
wine with a merry heart; for God hath already accepted thy works.

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> Let thy garments be always white, and let
not thy head lack oil.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> Enjoy life with the wife whom thou lovest
all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under
the sun, all the days of thy vanity; for that is thy portion in life,
and in thy labour wherein thou art labouring under the sun.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> Whatever thy hand findeth to do, do with
thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom,
in Sheol, whither thou goest.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> I returned, and saw under the sun, that
the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet
bread to the wise, nor yet riches to the intelligent, nor yet favour to
men of knowledge; but time and chance happeneth to them all.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> For man also knoweth not his time: as the
fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are taken
with the snare, like them are the children of men snared in an evil
time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> This also have I seen as wisdom under the
sun, and it was great unto me.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> There was a little city, and few men
within it; and there came a great king against it, and encompassed it,
and built great bulwarks against it:

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> and there was found in it a poor wise
man, who by his wisdom delivered the city; but no man remembered that
poor man.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> Then said I, Wisdom is better than
strength; but the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not
heard.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> The words of the wise are heard in quiet
more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but
one sinner destroyeth much good.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> Dead flies cause the ointment of the
apothecary to stink \[and\] ferment; \[so\] a little folly is weightier
than wisdom \[and\] honour.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> The heart of a wise \[man\] is at his
right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh
by the way, his sense faileth \[him\], and he saith to every one
\[that\] he is a fool.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> If the spirit of the ruler rise up
against thee, leave not thy place; for quietness pacifieth great
offences.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> There is an evil that I have seen under
the sun, as an error \[that\] proceedeth from the ruler:

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> folly is set in great dignities, but the
rich sit in a low place.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> I have seen servants upon horses, and
princes walking as servants upon the earth.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> He that diggeth a pit falleth into it;
and whoso breaketh down a hedge, a serpent biteth him.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> Whoso removeth stones is hurt therewith;
he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> If the iron be blunt, and one do not
whet the edge, then must he apply more strength; but wisdom is
profitable to give success.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> If the serpent bite before enchantment,
then the charmer hath no advantage.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> The words of a wise man's mouth are
gracious; but the lips of a fool swallow up himself.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> The beginning of the words of his mouth
is folly; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> And the fool multiplieth words: \[yet\]
man knoweth not what shall be; and what shall be after him, who will
tell him?

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> The labour of fools wearieth them,
because they know not how to go to the city.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a
child, and thy princes eat in the morning!

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> Happy art thou, O land, when thy king
is a son of nobles, and thy princes eat in \[due\] season, for strength,
and not for drunkenness!

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> By much sloth fulness the framework
falleth in; and through idleness of the hands the house drippeth.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> A feast is made for laughter, and wine
maketh life merry; but money answereth everything.

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> Curse not the king, no, not in thy
thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for the bird of the
air will carry the voice, and that which hath wings will tell the
matter.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> Cast thy bread upon the waters; for thou
shalt find it after many days.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> Give a portion to seven, and also to
eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> If the clouds be full of rain, they empty
themselves upon the earth; and if a tree fall toward the south, or
toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall
be.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> He that observeth the wind will not sow;
and he that regardeth the clouds will not reap.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> As thou knowest not what is the way of
the spirit, how the bones \[grow\] in the womb of her that is with
child, even so thou knowest not the work of God who maketh all.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> In the morning sow thy seed, and in the
evening withhold not thy hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper,
whether this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> Now the light is sweet, and pleasant is
it to the eyes to see the sun;

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> but if a man live many years, \[and\]
rejoice in them all, yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they
shall be many: all that cometh is vanity.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> Rejoice, young man, in thy youth; and let
thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of
thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know that for all these
\[things\] God will bring thee into judgment.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> Then remove discontent from thy heart,
and put away evil from thy flesh; for childhood and youth are vanity.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> And remember thy Creator in the days of
thy youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, of which
thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> before the sun, and the light, and the
moon, and the stars, be darkened, and the clouds return after the rain;

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> in the day when the keepers of the house
tremble, and the strong men bow themselves, and the grinders cease
because they are few, and those that look out of the windows are
darkened,

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> and the doors are shut toward the street;
when the sound of the grinding is subdued, and they rise up at the voice
of the bird, and all the daughters of song are brought low;

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> they are also afraid of what is high, and
terrors are in the way, and the almond is despised, and the grasshopper
is a burden, and the caper-berry is without effect; (for man goeth to
his age-long home, and the mourners go about the streets;)

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> -- before the silver cord be loosed, or
the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be shattered at the fountain,
or the wheel be broken at the cistern;

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> and the dust return to the earth as it
was, and the spirit return unto God who gave it.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher:
all is vanity.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> And moreover, because the Preacher was
wise, he still taught the people knowledge; and he pondered, and sought
out, \[and\] set in order many proverbs.

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> The Preacher sought to find out
acceptable words; and that which was written is upright, words of truth.

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> The words of the wise are as goads, and
the collections \[of them\] as nails fastened in: they are given from
one shepherd.

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> And besides, my son, be warned by them:
of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of
the flesh.

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> Let us hear the end of the whole
matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole of
man.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> For God shall bring every work into
judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be
evil.
