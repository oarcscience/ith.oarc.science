### Darby Bible: Philemon

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, prisoner of Christ Jesus, and
Timotheus the brother, to Philemon the beloved and our fellow-workman,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> and to the sister Apphia and to Archippus
our fellow-soldier, and to the assembly which \[is\] in thine house.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Grace to you and peace from God our Father,
and \[the\] Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I thank my God, always making mention of
thee at my prayers,

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> hearing of thy love and the faith which
thou hast towards the Lord Jesus, and towards all the saints,

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> in such sort that thy participation in the
faith should become operative in the acknowledgment of every good thing
which is in us towards Christ \[Jesus\].

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For we have great thankfulness and
encouragement through thy love, because the bowels of the saints are
refreshed by thee, brother.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Wherefore having much boldness in Christ to
enjoin thee what is fitting,

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> for love's sake I rather exhort, being such
a one as Paul the aged, and now also prisoner of Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> I exhort thee for \*my\* child, whom I
have begotten in \[my\] bonds, Onesimus,

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> once unserviceable to thee, but now
serviceable to thee and to me:

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> whom I have sent back to thee: \[but do
\*thou\* receive\] him, that is, \*my\* bowels:

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> whom \*I\* was desirous of keeping with
myself, that for thee he might minister to me in the bonds of the glad
tidings;

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> but I have wished to do nothing without
thy mind, that thy good might not be as of necessity but of willingness:

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> for perhaps for this reason he has been
separated \[from thee\] for a time, that thou mightest possess him fully
for ever;

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> not any longer as a bondman, but above a
bondman, a beloved brother, specially to me, and how much rather to
thee, both in \[the\] flesh and in \[the\] Lord?

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> If therefore thou holdest me to be a
partner \[with thee\], receive him as me;

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> but if he have wronged thee anything or
owe anything \[to thee\], put this to my account.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> \*I\* Paul have written \[it\] with mine
own hand; \*I\* will repay \[it\]: that I say not to thee that thou
owest even thine own self also to me.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Yea, brother, \*I\* would have profit of
\*thee\* in \[the\] Lord: refresh my bowels in Christ.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> Being confident of thine obedience, I
have written to thee, knowing that thou wilt do even more than I say.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> But withal prepare me also a lodging; for
I hope that I shall be granted to you through your prayers.

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> Epaphras salutes thee, my fellow-prisoner
in Christ Jesus;

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my
fellow-workmen.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ \[be\]
with your spirit.
