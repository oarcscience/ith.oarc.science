### Darby Bible: Lamentations

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> How doth the city sit solitary \[that\] was
full of people! She that was great among the nations is become as a
widow; the princess among the provinces is become tributary!

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> She weepeth sore in the night, and her
tears are on her cheeks; among all her lovers she hath no comforter; all
her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her
enemies.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Judah is gone into captivity because of
affliction, and because of great servitude; she dwelleth among the
nations, she findeth no rest: all her pursuers have overtaken her within
the straits.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> The ways of Zion do mourn, because none
come to the solemn assembly: all her gates are desolate; her priests
sigh, her virgins are in grief; and as for her, she is in bitterness.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Her adversaries have become the head, her
enemies prosper; for Jehovah hath afflicted her for the multitude of her
transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the
adversary.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And from the daughter of Zion all her
splendour is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no
pasture; and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> In the days of her affliction and of her
wanderings, since her people fell into the hand of an adversary, and
none did help her, Jerusalem remembereth all her precious things which
she had in the days of old: the adversaries have seen her, they mock at
her ruin.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore
is she removed as an impurity: all that honoured her despise her because
they have seen her nakedness; and she sigheth, and turneth backward.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Her impurity was in her skirts, she
remembered not her latter end; and she came down wonderfully: she hath
no comforter. Jehovah, behold my affliction; for the enemy hath
magnified himself.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> The adversary hath spread out his hand
upon all her precious things; for she hath seen the nations enter into
her sanctuary, concerning whom thou didst command that they should not
enter into thy congregation.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> All her people sigh, they seek bread;
they have given their precious things for food to revive \[their\] soul.
See, Jehovah, and consider, for I am become vile.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass
by? Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is
done unto me, whom Jehovah hath afflicted in the day of his fierce
anger.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> From on high hath he sent fire into my
bones, and it prevaileth against them; he hath spread a net for my feet;
he hath turned me back; he hath made me desolate \[and\] faint all the
day.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> The yoke of my transgressions is bound by
his hand: they are wreathed, they are come up upon my neck; he hath made
my strength to fail; the Lord hath delivered me into hands out of which
I am not able to rise up.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> The Lord hath cast down all my mighty men
in the midst of me; he hath called an assembly against me to crush my
young men; the Lord hath trodden as a winepress the virgin daughter of
Judah.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> For these things I weep; mine eye, mine
eye runneth down with water: for the comforter that should revive my
soul is far from me; my children are desolate, for the enemy hath
prevailed.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> Zion spreadeth forth her hands; there is
none to comfort her; Jehovah hath commanded concerning Jacob, \[that\]
his adversaries \[should be\] round about him; Jerusalem is as an
impurity among them.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Jehovah is righteous; for I have rebelled
against his commandment. Hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, and behold my
sorrow. My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> I called for my lovers, they have
deceived me; my priests and mine elders have expired in the city, while
they sought them food to revive their soul.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> See, Jehovah, for I am in distress, my
bowels are troubled; my heart is turned within me, for I have grievously
rebelled: without, the sword hath bereaved \[me\], within, it is as
death.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> They have heard that I sigh: I have no
comforter: all mine enemies have heard of my calamity; they are glad
that thou hast done it. Thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called,
and they shall be like unto me.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> Let all their wickedness come before
thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my
transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> How hath the Lord in his anger covered the
daughter of Zion with a cloud! He hath cast down from the heavens unto
the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the
day of his anger.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> The Lord hath swallowed up all the
dwellings of Jacob, and hath not spared; he hath thrown down in his
wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah: he hath brought \[them\]
down to the ground; he hath profaned the kingdom and the princes
thereof.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> He hath cut off in fierce anger all the
horn of Israel: he hath withdrawn his right hand from before the enemy;
and he burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, devouring round about.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> He hath bent his bow like an enemy; he
stood with his right hand as an adversary, and hath slain all that was
pleasant to the eye: in the tent of the daughter of Zion, he hath poured
out his fury like fire.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> The Lord is become as an enemy: he hath
swallowed up Israel; he hath swallowed up all her palaces; he hath
destroyed his strongholds, and hath multiplied in the daughter of Judah
mourning and lamentation.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> And he hath violently cast down his
enclosure as a garden; he hath destroyed his place of assembly: Jehovah
hath caused set feast and sabbath to be forgotten in Zion, and hath
despised in the indignation of his anger king and priest.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath
rejected his sanctuary; he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the
walls of her palaces: they have made a noise in the house of Jehovah, as
on the day of a set feast.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Jehovah hath purposed to destroy the wall
of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out the line, he hath not
withdrawn his hand from destroying; and he hath made the rampart and the
wall to lament: they languish together.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath
destroyed and broken her bars. Her king and her princes are among the
nations: the law is no \[more\]; her prophets also find no vision from
Jehovah.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> The elders of the daughter of Zion sit
upon the ground, they keep silence; they have cast dust upon their
heads, they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of
Jerusalem hang down their head to the ground.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Mine eyes are consumed with tears, my
bowels are troubled; my liver is poured upon the earth, because of the
ruin of the daughter of my people; because infant and suckling swoon in
the streets of the city.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> They say to their mothers, Where is corn
and wine? when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city;
when they pour out their soul into their mothers' bosom.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> What shall I take to witness for thee?
what shall I liken unto thee, daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I equal
to thee, that I may comfort thee, virgin daughter of Zion? For thy ruin
is great as the sea: who will heal thee?

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> Thy prophets have seen vanity and folly
for thee; and they have not revealed thine iniquity, to turn away thy
captivity; but have seen for thee burdens of falsehood and causes of
expulsion.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> All that pass by clap \[their\] hands at
thee; they hiss and shake their head at the daughter of Jerusalem: Is
this the city which they called, The perfection of beauty, The joy of
the whole earth?

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> All thine enemies open their mouth
against thee, they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed
\[her\] up; this is forsooth the day that we looked for: we have found,
we have seen \[it\].

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> Jehovah hath done what he had devised; he
hath fulfilled his word which he had commanded from the days of old: he
hath thrown down, and hath not spared, and he hath caused the enemy to
rejoice over thee; he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> Their heart cried unto the Lord. O wall
of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a torrent day and
night: give thyself no respite; let not the apple of thine eye rest.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> Arise, cry out in the night, in the
beginning of the watches; pour out thy heart like water before the face
of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young
children, who faint from hunger at the top of all the streets.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> See, Jehovah, and consider to whom thou
hast done this! Shall the women eat their fruit, the infants that they
nursed? Shall priest and prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> The child and the old man lie on the
ground in the streets; my virgins and my young men are fallen by the
sword: thou hast slain \[them\] in the day of thine anger; thou hast
killed, thou hast not spared.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> Thou hast called up, as on the day of a
set feast, my terrors on every side; and in the day of Jehovah's anger
there was none that escaped or remained: those that I have nursed and
brought up hath mine enemy consumed.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> I am the man that hath seen affliction by
the rod of his wrath.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Me hath he led, and brought into darkness,
and not into light.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Surely against me hath he turned again and
again his hand all the day.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> My flesh and my skin hath he wasted away,
he hath broken my bones.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> He hath built against me, and encompassed
\[me\] with gall and toil.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> He hath made me to dwell in dark places as
those that have been long dead.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> He hath hedged me about that I cannot get
out: he hath made my chain heavy.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Even when I cry and shout, he shutteth out
my prayer.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone,
he hath made my paths crooked.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> He is unto me \[as\] a bear lying in
wait, a lion in secret places.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled
me in pieces; he hath made me desolate.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> He hath bent his bow, and set me as a
mark for the arrow.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> He hath caused the arrows of his quiver
to enter into my reins.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> I am become a derision to all my people;
their song all the day.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> He hath sated me with bitterness, he hath
made me drunk with wormwood.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> He hath also broken my teeth with gravel
stones, he hath covered me with ashes.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> And thou hast removed my soul far off
from peace: I have forgotten prosperity.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> And I said, My strength is perished, and
my hope in Jehovah.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> Remember thou mine affliction and my
wandering, the wormwood and the gall.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> My soul hath \[them\] constantly in
remembrance, and is humbled in me.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> -- This I recall to heart, therefore have
I hope.

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> It is of Jehovah's loving-kindness we are
not consumed, because his compassions fail not;

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> they are new every morning: great is thy
faithfulness.

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> Jehovah is my portion, saith my soul;
therefore will I hope in him.

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> Jehovah is good unto them that wait for
him, to the soul \[that\] seeketh him.

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> It is good that one should both wait, and
that in silence, for the salvation of Jehovah.

<span id="an_3:27">3:27</span> It is good for a man that he bear the
yoke in his youth:

<span id="an_3:28">3:28</span> He sitteth solitary and keepeth silence,
because he hath laid it upon him;

<span id="an_3:29">3:29</span> he putteth his mouth in the dust, if so
be there may be hope;

<span id="an_3:30">3:30</span> he giveth his cheek to him that smiteth
him; he is filled full with reproach.

<span id="an_3:31">3:31</span> For the Lord will not cast off for ever;

<span id="an_3:32">3:32</span> but if he have caused grief, he will have
compassion according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses:

<span id="an_3:33">3:33</span> for he doth not willingly afflict or
grieve the children of men.

<span id="an_3:34">3:34</span> To crush under foot all the prisoners of
the earth,

<span id="an_3:35">3:35</span> to turn aside the right of a man before
the face of the Most High,

<span id="an_3:36">3:36</span> to wrong a man in his cause, -- will not
the Lord see it?

<span id="an_3:37">3:37</span> Who is he that saith, and there cometh to
pass, what the Lord hath not commanded?

<span id="an_3:38">3:38</span> Out of the mouth of the Most High doth
not there proceed evil and good?

<span id="an_3:39">3:39</span> Wherefore doth a living man complain, a
man for the punishment of his sins?

<span id="an_3:40">3:40</span> Let us search and try our ways, and turn
again to Jehovah.

<span id="an_3:41">3:41</span> Let us lift up our heart with \[our\]
hands unto ùGod in the heavens.

<span id="an_3:42">3:42</span> We have transgressed and have rebelled:
thou hast not pardoned.

<span id="an_3:43">3:43</span> Thou hast covered thyself with anger, and
pursued us; thou hast slain, thou hast not spared.

<span id="an_3:44">3:44</span> Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud,
that prayer should not pass through.

<span id="an_3:45">3:45</span> Thou hast made us the offscouring and
refuse in the midst of the peoples.

<span id="an_3:46">3:46</span> All our enemies have opened their mouth
against us.

<span id="an_3:47">3:47</span> Fear and the pit are come upon us,
devastation and ruin.

<span id="an_3:48">3:48</span> Mine eye runneth down with streams of
water for the ruin of the daughter of my people.

<span id="an_3:49">3:49</span> Mine eye poureth down, and ceaseth not,
without any intermission,

<span id="an_3:50">3:50</span> till Jehovah look down and behold from
the heavens.

<span id="an_3:51">3:51</span> Mine eye affecteth my soul, because of
all the daughters of my city.

<span id="an_3:52">3:52</span> They that are mine enemies without cause
have chased me sore like a bird.

<span id="an_3:53">3:53</span> They have cut off my life in a pit, and
cast a stone upon me.

<span id="an_3:54">3:54</span> Waters streamed over my head; I said, I
am cut off.

<span id="an_3:55">3:55</span> I called upon thy name, Jehovah, out of
the lowest pit.

<span id="an_3:56">3:56</span> Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine
ear at my sighing, at my cry.

<span id="an_3:57">3:57</span> Thou drewest near in the day that I
called upon thee; thou saidst, Fear not.

<span id="an_3:58">3:58</span> Lord, thou hast pleaded the cause of my
soul, thou hast redeemed my life.

<span id="an_3:59">3:59</span> Jehovah, thou hast seen my wrong: judge
thou my cause.

<span id="an_3:60">3:60</span> Thou hast seen all their vengeance, all
their imaginations against me.

<span id="an_3:61">3:61</span> Thou hast heard their reproach, O
Jehovah, all their imaginations against me;

<span id="an_3:62">3:62</span> the lips of those that rise up against me
and their meditation against me all the day.

<span id="an_3:63">3:63</span> Behold thou their sitting down and their
rising up: I am their song.

<span id="an_3:64">3:64</span> Render unto them a recompence, O Jehovah,
according to the work of their hands;

<span id="an_3:65">3:65</span> give them obduracy of heart, thy curse
unto them;

<span id="an_3:66">3:66</span> pursue them in anger, and destroy them
from under the heavens of Jehovah.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> How is the gold become dim! the most pure
gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary poured out at the top of all
the streets!

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> The sons of Zion, so precious, comparable
to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the
hands of the potter!

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> Even the jackals offer the breast, they
give suck to their young; the daughter of my people is become cruel,
like the ostriches in the wilderness.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to
the roof of his mouth for thirst; the young children ask bread, no man
breaketh it unto them.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> They that fed delicately are desolate in
the streets; they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dung-hills.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> And the punishment of the iniquity of the
daughter of my people is greater than the reward of the sin of Sodom,
which was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were violently laid
upon her.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> Her Nazarites were purer than snow, whiter
than milk; they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their figure was as
sapphire.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Their visage is darker than blackness, they
are not known in the streets; their skin cleaveth to their bones, it is
withered, it is become like a stick.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> The slain with the sword are happier than
the slain with hunger; for these pine away, stricken through for want of
the fruits of the field.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> The hands of pitiful women have boiled
their own children: they were their meat in the ruin of the daughter of
my people.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> Jehovah hath accomplished his fury; he
hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, which
hath consumed the foundations thereof.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> The kings of the earth, and all the
inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and
the enemy should enter into the gates of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> \[It is\] for the sins of her prophets,
\[and\] the iniquities of her priests, who have shed the blood of the
righteous in the midst of her.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> They wandered about blind in the streets;
they were polluted with blood, so that men could not touch their
garments.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> They cried unto them, Depart! Unclean!
Depart! depart, touch not! When they fled away, and wandered about, it
was said among the nations, They shall no more sojourn \[there\].

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> The face of Jehovah hath divided them; he
will no more regard them. They respected not the persons of the priests,
they favoured not the aged.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> Our eyes still failed for our vain help;
in our watching, we have watched for a nation that did not save.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> They hunted our steps, that we could not
go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end
is come.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles
of the heavens; they chased us hotly upon the mountains, they laid wait
for us in the wilderness.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> The breath of our nostrils, the anointed
of Jehovah, was taken in their pits; of whom we said, Under his shadow
we shall live among the nations.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> Rejoice and be glad, daughter of Edom,
that dwellest in the land of Uz: the cup shall pass also unto thee; thou
shalt be drunken, and make thyself naked.

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> The punishment of thine iniquity is
accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into
captivity. He will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will
discover thy sins.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Remember, O Jehovah, what is come upon us;
consider, and see our reproach.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our
houses to aliens.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers
are as widows.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> Our water have we to drink for money, our
wood cometh unto us for a price.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> Our pursuers are on our necks: we are
weary, we have no rest.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> We have given the hand to Egypt, \[and\] to
Asshur, to be satisfied with bread.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> Our fathers have sinned, \[and\] they are
not; and we bear their iniquities.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> Bondmen rule over us: there is no deliverer
out of their hand.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> We have to get our bread at the risk of our
lives, because of the sword of the wilderness.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> Our skin gloweth like an oven, because of
the burning heat of the famine.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> They have ravished the women in Zion, the
maids in the cities of Judah.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> Princes were hanged up by their hand; the
faces of elders were not honoured.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> The young men have borne the mill, and
the youths have stumbled under the wood.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> The elders have ceased from the gate, the
young men from their music.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> The joy of our heart hath ceased; our
dance is turned into mourning.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> The crown is fallen from our head: woe
unto us, for we have sinned!

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> For this our heart is faint; for these
things our eyes have grown dim,

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> Because of the mountain of Zion, which is
desolate: foxes walk over it.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> Thou, Jehovah, dwellest for ever; thy
throne is from generation to generation.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever,
dost thou forsake us so long time?

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> Turn thou us unto thee, Jehovah, and we
shall be turned; renew our days as of old.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> Or is it that thou hast utterly rejected
us? Wouldest thou be exceeding wroth against us?
