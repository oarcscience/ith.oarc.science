### Darby Bible: Titus

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, bondman of God, and apostle of Jesus
Christ according to \[the\] faith of God's elect, and knowledge of
\[the\] truth which \[is\] according to piety;

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> in \[the\] hope of eternal life, which God,
who cannot lie, promised before the ages of time,

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> but has manifested in its own due season
his word, in \[the\] proclamation with which \*I\* have been entrusted,
according to \[the\] commandment of our Saviour God;

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> to Titus, my own child according to \[the\]
faith common \[to us\]: Grace and peace from God \[the\] Father, and
Christ Jesus our Saviour.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> For this cause I left thee in Crete, that
thou mightest go on to set right what remained \[unordered\], and
establish elders in each city, as \*I\* had ordered thee:

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> if any one be free from all charge
\[against him\], husband of one wife, having believing children not
accused of excess or unruly.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For the overseer must be free from all
charge \[against him\] as God's steward; not headstrong, not passionate,
not disorderly through wine, not a striker, not seeking gain by base
means;

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> but hospitable, a lover of goodness,
discreet, just, pious, temperate,

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> clinging to the faithful word according to
the doctrine taught, that he may be able both to encourage with sound
teaching and refute gainsayers.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> For there are many and disorderly vain
speakers and deceivers of people's minds, specially those of \[the\]
circumcision,

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> who must have their mouths stopped, who
subvert whole houses, teaching things which ought not \[to be taught\]
for the sake of base gain.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> One of themselves, a prophet of their
own, has said, Cretans are always liars, evil wild beasts, lazy
gluttons.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> This testimony is true; for which cause
rebuke them severely, that they may be sound in the faith,

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> not turning \[their\] minds to Jewish
fables and commandments of men turning away from the truth.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> All things \[are\] pure to the pure; but
to the defiled and unbelieving nothing \[is\] pure; but both their mind
and their conscience are defiled.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> They profess to know God, but in works
deny \[him\], being abominable, and disobedient, and found worthless as
to every good work.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> But do \*thou\* speak the things that
become sound teaching;

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> that the elder men be sober, grave,
discreet, sound in faith, in love, in patience;

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> that the elder women in like manner be in
deportment as becoming those who have to say to sacred things, not
slanderers, not enslaved to much wine, teachers of what is right;

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> that they may admonish the young women to
be attached to \[their\] husbands, to be attached to \[their\] children,

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> discreet, chaste, diligent in home work,
good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be
evil spoken of.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> The younger men in like manner exhort to be
discreet:

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> in all things affording thyself as a
pattern of good works; in teaching uncorruptedness, gravity,

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> a sound word, not to be condemned; that he
who is opposed may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us:

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> bondmen to be subject to their own masters,
to make themselves acceptable in everything; not gainsaying;

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> not robbing \[their masters\], but
shewing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the teaching which \[is\]
of our Saviour God in all things.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> For the grace of God which carries with
it salvation for all men has appeared,

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> teaching us that, having denied impiety
and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, and justly, and piously in
the present course of things,

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> awaiting the blessed hope and appearing
of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ;

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> who gave himself for us, that he might
redeem us from all lawlessness, and purify to himself a peculiar people,
zealous for good works.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> These things speak, and exhort, and
rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise thee.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Put them in mind to be subject to rulers,
to authorities, to be obedient to rule, to be ready to do every good
work,

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> to speak evil of no one, not to be
contentious, \[to be\] mild, shewing all meekness towards all men.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> For we were once ourselves also without
intelligence, disobedient, wandering in error, serving various lusts and
pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, \[and\] hating one
another.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> But when the kindness and love to man of
our Saviour God appeared,

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> not on the principle of works which \[have
been done\] in righteousness which \*we\* had done, but according to his
own mercy he saved us through \[the\] washing of regeneration and
renewal of \[the\] Holy Spirit,

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> which he poured out on us richly through
Jesus Christ our Saviour;

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> that, having been justified by \*his\*
grace, we should become heirs according to \[the\] hope of eternal life.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> The word \[is\] faithful, and I desire that
thou insist strenuously on these things, that they who have believed God
may take care to pay diligent attention to good works. These things are
good and profitable to men.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> But foolish questions, and genealogies, and
strifes, and contentions about the law, shun; for they are unprofitable
and vain.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> An heretical man after a first and second
admonition have done with,

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> knowing that such a one is perverted, and
sins, being self-condemned.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> When I shall send Artemas to thee, or
Tychicus, use diligence to come to me to Nicopolis; for I have decided
to winter there.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Zenas the lawyer and Apollos set forward
diligently on their way, that nothing may be lacking to them;

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> and let ours also learn to apply
themselves to good works for necessary wants, that they may not be
unfruitful.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> All with me salute thee. Salute those who
love us in \[the\] faith. Grace \[be\] with you all.
