### Darby Bible: 2 Chronicles

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> And Solomon the son of David was
strengthened in his kingdom, and Jehovah his God was with him and
magnified him exceedingly.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the
captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to all the
princes of all Israel, the chief fathers;

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> and Solomon, and all the congregation with
him, went to the high place at Gibeon; for there was God's tent of
meeting which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> But the ark of God had David brought up
from Kirjath-jearim to the \[place\] that David had prepared for it; for
he had spread a tent for it at Jerusalem.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And the brazen altar that Bezaleel the son
of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of
Jehovah; and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And Solomon offered there upon the brazen
altar before Jehovah which was at the tent of meeting; and he offered up
a thousand burnt-offerings upon it.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> In that night God appeared to Solomon, and
said to him, Ask what I shall give thee.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> And Solomon said to God, Thou hast shewn
unto David my father great loving-kindness, and hast made me king in his
stead.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Now, Jehovah Elohim, let thy word unto
David my father be firm; for thou hast made me king over a people
numerous as the dust of the earth.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I
may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this thy
great people?

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> And God said to Solomon, Because this was
in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the
life of them that hate thee, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast
asked for thyself wisdom and knowledge, that thou mayest judge my
people, over whom I have made thee king:

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> wisdom and knowledge are granted unto
thee; and I will give thee riches and wealth and honour, such as none of
the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall any after
thee have the like.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Then Solomon came back \[from\] the high
place at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tent of meeting, and
reigned over Israel.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> And Solomon gathered chariots and
horsemen; and he had a thousand four hundred chariots and twelve
thousand horsemen; and he placed them in the chariot-cities, and with
the king at Jerusalem.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> And the king made silver and gold in
Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he as the sycamores that are in the
lowland for abundance.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> And the exportation of horses that
Solomon had was from Egypt: a caravan of the king's merchants fetched a
drove \[of horses\], at a price.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> And they fetched up and brought forth out
of Egypt a chariot for six hundred \[shekels\] of silver, and a horse
for a hundred and fifty; and so they brought \[them\] by their means,
for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Syria.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> And Solomon purposed to build a house for
the name of Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> And Solomon numbered seventy thousand men
to bear burdens, and eighty thousand stone-masons in the mountain, and
three thousand six hundred to superintend them.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And Solomon sent to Huram king of Tyre,
saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him
cedars to build him a house to dwell therein \[so do for me\].

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> Behold, I build a house unto the name of
Jehovah my God to dedicate it to him, to burn before him sweet incense,
and for the continual arrangement \[of the shewbread\], and for the
morning and evening burnt-offerings \[and\] on the sabbaths and on the
new moons, and on the set feasts of Jehovah our God. This is \[an
ordinance\] for ever to Israel.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> And the house that I will build is great;
for great is our God above all gods.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> But who is able to build him a house,
seeing the heavens and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? And who
am I that I should build him a house, except to burn sacrifice before
him?

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> And now send me a man skilful to work in
gold, and in silver, and in bronze, and in iron, and in purple and
crimson and blue, and experienced in carving, besides the skilful men
that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father
provided.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Send me also cedar-trees, cypress-trees,
and sandal-wood trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that thy servants are
experienced in cutting timber in Lebanon; and behold, my servants shall
be with thy servants,

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> even to prepare me timber in abundance: for
the house that I build shall be great and wonderful.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> And behold, I will give to thy servants
the hewers that fell timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat,
and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of
wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> And Huram king of Tyre answered in
writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because Jehovah loved his people, he
made thee king over them.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> And Huram said, Blessed be Jehovah the
God of Israel, that made the heavens and the earth, who has given to
David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, who
will build a house for Jehovah and a house for his kingdom.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And now, I send a skilful man, endued
with understanding, Huram Abi,

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> the son of a woman of the daughters of
Dan, and whose father was a man of Tyre, experienced in working in gold,
and in silver, in bronze, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple,
in blue, and in byssus, and in crimson, and for doing any manner of
engraving, and for inventing every device which shall be put to him,
besides thy skilful men, and the skilful men of my lord David thy
father.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> And now the wheat and the barley, the oil
and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his
servants.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as
much as thou shalt need; and we will bring it to thee \[in\] floats by
sea to Joppa, and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> And Solomon numbered all the strangers
that were in the land of Israel, after the account that David his father
had taken of them, and there were found a hundred and fifty-three
thousand six hundred.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> And he set seventy thousand of them to be
bearers of burdens, and eighty thousand to be stone-masons in the
mountains, and three thousand six hundred overseers to set the people to
work.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> And Solomon began to build the house of
Jehovah at Jerusalem on mount Moriah, where he appeared to David his
father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshing-floor of
Ornan the Jebusite.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> And he began to build on the second of the
second month, in the fourth year of his reign.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> And this was Solomon's foundation for the
construction of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first
measure was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> And the porch which was in front was twenty
cubits in length, in front of the house broadways, and the height was a
hundred and twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> And the greater house he boarded with
cypress-wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set on it palm-trees
and chains.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> And he overlaid the house with precious
stones for beauty; and the gold was gold of Parvaim.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> And he covered the house, the beams, the
threshold, and its walls, and its doors with gold, and engraved cherubim
on the walls.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> And he made the house of the most holy
place, the length of which was according to the breadth of the house,
twenty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits; and he covered it with
fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> And the weight of the nails was fifty
shekels of gold. And he covered the upper chambers with gold.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> And in the house of the most holy place
he made two cherubim of image work, and they overlaid them with gold.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> And the wings of the cherubim were twenty
cubits long: one wing of five cubits touched the wall of the house; and
the other wing of five cubits touched the wing of the other cherub.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> And the wing of the other cherub of five
cubits touched the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits
joining the wing of the other cherub.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> The wings of these cherubim spread forth
were twenty cubits; and they stood on their feet, and their faces were
toward the house.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> And he made the veil of blue, and purple,
and crimson, and byssus, and made cherubim upon it.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> And before the house he made two pillars
thirty-five cubits long; and the capital that was on the top of each of
them was five cubits.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> And he made chains \[as\] in the oracle,
and he put them on the top of the pillars; and he made a hundred
pomegranates, and put them on the chains.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> And he set up the pillars in front of the
temple, one on the right hand and the other on the left; and he called
the name of that on the right Jachin, and the name of that on the left
Boaz.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> And he made a brazen altar: its length was
twenty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits, and its height ten cubits.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> And he made the sea, molten, ten cubits
from brim to brim, round all about; and its height was five cubits; and
a line of thirty cubits encompassed it round about.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> And under it was the similitude of oxen,
encompassing it round about, ten in a cubit enclosing the sea round
about, two rows of oxen, cast when it was cast.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking
toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking
toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was
above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> And its thickness was a hand-breadth, and
its brim like the work of the brim of a cup, with lily-blossoms; in
capacity it held three thousand baths.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> And he made ten lavers, and put five on the
right and five on the left, to wash in them: they rinsed in them what
they prepared for the burnt-offering; and the sea was for the priests to
wash in.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> And he made ten candlesticks of gold
according to the ordinance respecting them, and set them in the temple,
five on the right hand and five on the left.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> And he made ten tables, and placed them in
the temple, five on the right hand and five on the left. And he made a
hundred golden bowls.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> And he made the court of the priests, and
the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors thereof
with bronze.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> And he set the sea on the right side
eastward, over against the south.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> And Huram made the pots and the shovels
and the bowls. So Huram ended doing the work that he made for king
Solomon in the house of God:

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> two pillars, and the globes and the
capitals on the top of the pillars, two; and the two networks, to cover
the two globes of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> and the four hundred pomegranates for the
two networks, two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two
globes of the capitals which were upon the pillars.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> And he made the bases, and he made the
lavers on the bases;

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> And the pots, and the shovels, and the
forks, and all their instruments did Huram Abiv make king Solomon for
the house of Jehovah, of bright brass.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> In the plain of the Jordan did the king
cast them, in the clay-ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> And Solomon made all these vessels in
great number; for the weight of the brass was not ascertained.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> And Solomon made all the vessels that
were \[in\] the house of God: the golden altar; and the tables whereon
was the shewbread;

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> and the candlesticks with their lamps to
burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> and the flowers, and the lamps, and the
tongs, of gold (it was perfect gold);

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> and the knives, and the bowls, and the
cups, and the censers, of pure gold; and the entrance of the house, the
inner folding-doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of
the house, of the temple, of gold.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> And all the work was finished that Solomon
made for the house of Jehovah. And Solomon brought in the things that
David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all
the vessels he put among the treasures of the house of God.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Then Solomon assembled the elders of
Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers of
the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the
covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> And all the men of Israel assembled
themselves to the king at the feast, that of the seventh month.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> And all the elders of Israel came; and the
Levites took up the ark.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> And they brought up the ark, and the tent
of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent: the priests,
the Levites, brought them up.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> And king Solomon, and all the assembly of
Israel, that were assembled to him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and
oxen which could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> And the priests brought in the ark of the
covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the oracle of the house, into the
most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim;

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> and the cherubim stretched forth \[their\]
wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and
its staves above.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> And the staves were long, so that the ends
of the staves were seen outside the ark before the oracle; but they were
not seen without. And there they are to this day.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> There was nothing in the ark save the two
tables which Moses put there at Horeb, when Jehovah made \[a covenant\]
with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And it came to pass when the priests were
come out of the holy place (for all the priests that were present were
hallowed without observing the courses;

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> and the Levites the singers, all they of
Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, clad
in byssus, with cymbals and lutes and harps, stood at the east end of
the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with
trumpets),

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> -- it came to pass when the trumpeters
and singers were as one, to make one voice to be heard in praising and
thanking Jehovah; and when they lifted up their voice with trumpets, and
cymbals, and instruments of music, and praised Jehovah: For he is good,
for his loving-kindness \[endureth\] for ever; that then the house, the
house of Jehovah, was filled with a cloud,

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> and the priests could not stand to do
their service because of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah had filled
the house of God.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Then said Solomon: Jehovah said that he
would dwell in the thick darkness.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> But I have built a house of habitation for
thee, even a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> And the king turned his face and blessed
the whole congregation of Israel; and the whole congregation of Israel
stood.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> And he said: Blessed be Jehovah the God of
Israel, who spoke with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his
hands fulfilled it, saying,

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> Since the day that I brought forth my
people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city out of all the tribes of
Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I
any man to be prince over my people Israel:

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name
might be there; and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> And it was in the heart of David my father
to build a house unto the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> But Jehovah said to David my father,
Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house unto my name, thou didst
well that it was in thy heart;

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> nevertheless thou shalt not build the
house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall
build the house unto my name.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> And Jehovah has performed his word which
he spoke; and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on
the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and I have built the house
unto the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> And in it have I put the ark, wherein is
the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with the children of Israel.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> And he stood before the altar of Jehovah
in the presence of the whole congregation of Israel, and spread forth
his hands.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> For Solomon had made a platform of
bronze, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high,
and had set it in the midst of the court; and upon it he stood, and he
kneeled down on his knees before the whole congregation of Israel, and
spread forth his hands toward the heavens,

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> and said, Jehovah, God of Israel! there
is no God like thee, in the heavens or on the earth, who keepest
covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all
their heart;

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> who hast kept with thy servant David my
father that which thou didst promise him; thou spokest with thy mouth,
and hast fulfilled \[it\] with thy hand as at this day.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> And now, Jehovah, God of Israel, keep
with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him
saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne
of Israel, if only thy sons take heed to their way to walk in my law, as
thou hast walked before me.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> And now, Jehovah, God of Israel, let thy
word be verified which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> But will God indeed dwell with man on the
earth? behold, the heavens and the heaven of heavens cannot contain
thee; how much less this house which I have built!

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> Yet have respect unto the prayer of thy
servant, and to his supplication, Jehovah, my God, to hearken unto the
cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee;

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> that thine eyes may be open upon this
house day and night, upon the place in which thou hast said thou
wouldest put thy name: to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant
prayeth toward this place.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> And hearken unto the supplications of thy
servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall pray toward this
place, and hear thou from thy dwelling-place, from the heavens, and when
thou hearest, forgive.

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> If a man have sinned against his
neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to adjure him, and the oath come
before thine altar in this house;

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> then hear thou from the heavens, and do,
and judge thy servants, requiting the wicked, to bring his way upon his
own head; and justifying the righteous, giving him according to his
righteousness.

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> And if thy people Israel be put to the
worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall
turn again and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication before
thee in this house;

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> then hear thou from the heavens, and
forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land
that thou gavest to them and to their fathers.

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> When the heavens are shut up, and there
is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward
this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, because thou
hast afflicted them;

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> then hear thou in the heavens, and
forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou
teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and give rain upon
thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.

<span id="an_6:28">6:28</span> If there be famine in the land, if there
be pestilence, if there be blight or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if
their enemies besiege them in the land of their gates; whatever plague
or whatever sickness there be:

<span id="an_6:29">6:29</span> what prayer, what supplication soever be
made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, when they shall know every
man his own plague, and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands
toward this house;

<span id="an_6:30">6:30</span> then hear thou from the heavens, the
settled place of thy dwelling, and forgive, and render unto every man
according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest (for thou, thou
only, knowest the hearts of the children of men),

<span id="an_6:31">6:31</span> that they may fear thee, to walk in thy
ways, all the days that they live upon the land which thou gavest unto
our fathers.

<span id="an_6:32">6:32</span> And as to the stranger also, who is not
of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy great
name's sake, and thy mighty hand and thy stretched-out arm; when they
shall come and pray toward this house,

<span id="an_6:33">6:33</span> then hear thou from the heavens, the
settled place of thy dwelling, and do according to all that the stranger
calleth to thee for; in order that all peoples of the earth may know thy
name, and may fear thee as do thy people Israel, and may know that this
house which I have built is called by thy name.

<span id="an_6:34">6:34</span> If thy people go out to battle against
their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto
thee toward this city that thou hast chosen, and the house that I have
built unto thy name;

<span id="an_6:35">6:35</span> then hear thou from the heavens their
prayer and their supplication, and maintain their right.

<span id="an_6:36">6:36</span> If they have sinned against thee (for
there is no man that sinneth not), and thou be angry with them, and give
them up to the enemy, and they have carried them away captives unto a
land far off or near;

<span id="an_6:37">6:37</span> and if they shall take it to heart in the
land whither they were carried captive, and repent, and make
supplication unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have
sinned, we have done iniquity and have dealt perversely;

<span id="an_6:38">6:38</span> and if they return unto thee with all
their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity,
whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land
which thou gavest unto their fathers, and the city that thou hast
chosen, and the house that I have built unto thy name;

<span id="an_6:39">6:39</span> then hear thou from the heavens, from the
settled place of thy dwelling, their prayer and their supplications, and
maintain their right, and forgive thy people their sin against thee.

<span id="an_6:40">6:40</span> Now, my God, I beseech thee, let thine
eyes be open and let thine ears be attentive unto the prayer \[that is
made\] in this place.

<span id="an_6:41">6:41</span> And now, arise, Jehovah Elohim, into thy
resting-place, thou and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests,
Jehovah Elohim, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in
\[thy\] goodness.

<span id="an_6:42">6:42</span> Jehovah Elohim, turn not away the face of
thine anointed: remember mercies to David thy servant.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> And when Solomon had ended praying, the
fire came down from the heavens and consumed the burnt-offering and the
sacrifices; and the glory of Jehovah filled the house.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> And the priests could not enter into the
house of Jehovah, because the glory of Jehovah filled Jehovah's house.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> And all the children of Israel saw how the
fire came down, and the glory of Jehovah upon the house, and bowed
themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement, and
worshipped and thanked Jehovah: For he is good, for his loving-kindness
\[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> And the king and all the people offered
sacrifices before Jehovah.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> And king Solomon sacrificed a sacrifice of
twenty-two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So
the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> And the priests stood in their charges, and
the Levites with Jehovah's instruments of music, which David the king
had made to praise Jehovah, for his loving-kindness \[endureth\] for
ever, when David praised by their means; and the priests sounded the
trumpets opposite to them, and all Israel stood.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> And Solomon hallowed the middle of the
court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the
burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen
altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt-offerings
and the oblations and the fat.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> And at that time Solomon held the feast
seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the
entrance of Hamath unto the torrent of Egypt.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> And on the eighth day they held a solemn
assembly; for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the
feast seven days.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> And on the three and twentieth day of the
seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of
heart for the goodness that Jehovah had done to David and to Solomon,
and to Israel his people.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> And Solomon completed the house of
Jehovah, and the king's house; and all that came into Solomon's heart to
make in the house of Jehovah, and in his own house, he did prosperously.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> Then Jehovah appeared to Solomon by
night, and said to him: I have heard thy prayer, and I have chosen for
myself this place for a house of sacrifice.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> If I shut up the heavens that there be no
rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send
pestilence among my people;

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> and my people, who are called by my name,
humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their
wicked ways; then will I hear from the heavens, and forgive their sin,
and heal their land.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine
ears attentive to the prayer \[made\] in this place;

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> for I have now chosen and hallowed this
house, that my name may be there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart
shall be there perpetually.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> And \[as for\] thee, if thou wilt walk
before me, as David thy father walked, to do according to all that I
have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances;

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> then will I establish the throne of thy
kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying,
There shall not fail thee a man to rule over Israel.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> But if ye turn away and forsake my
statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and go and
serve other gods and worship them;

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> then will I pluck them up by the roots
out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have
hallowed to my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it a
proverb and a byword among all peoples.

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> And this house, which is high, shall be
an astonishment to every one that passes by it; so that he shall say,
Why has Jehovah done thus to this land and to this house?

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> And they shall say, Because they forsook
Jehovah the God of their fathers, who brought them forth out of the land
of Egypt, and have attached themselves to other gods, and have
worshipped them and served them; therefore he has brought upon them all
this evil.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> And it came to pass at the end of twenty
years, when Solomon had built the house of Jehovah and his own house,

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> that the cities which Huram had given to
Solomon, Solomon built them and caused the children of Israel to dwell
there.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> And Solomon went to Hamath-Zobah, and
overcame it.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> And he built Tadmor, in the wilderness, and
all the store-cities, which he built in Hamath.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> And he built upper Beth-Horon and lower
Beth-Horon, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> and Baalath, and all the store-cities that
Solomon had, and all the cities for chariots, and the cities for the
horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and on
Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> All the people that were left of the
Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
Jebusites, who were not of Israel,

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> their children that were left after them in
the land, whom the children of Israel had not destroyed, upon them did
Solomon impose tribute-service until this day.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> But of the children of Israel, of them did
Solomon make no bondmen for his work; but they were men of war, and
chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and his horsemen.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> And these were the chief of king
Solomon's superintendents, two hundred and fifty, that ruled over the
people.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> And Solomon brought up the daughter of
Pharaoh out of the city of David to the house which he had built for
her; for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of
Israel, because the \[places\] are holy to which the ark of Jehovah has
come.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> Then Solomon offered up burnt-offerings
to Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah, which he had built before the porch;

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> even as the duty of every day required,
offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on
the new moons, and at the set feasts, three times in the year, -- at the
feast of unleavened bread, and at the feast of weeks, and at the feast
of tabernacles.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> And he appointed, according to the
ordinance of David his father, the divisions of the priests for their
service, and the Levites for their charges, to praise and serve before
the priests, as the duty of every day required; and the doorkeepers by
their divisions at every gate: for such was the commandment of David the
man of God;

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> and they did not depart from the
commandment of the king to the priests and the Levites concerning any
matter, nor concerning the treasures.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> And all the work of Solomon was prepared,
to the day of the foundation of the house of Jehovah and to its
completion. \[So\] the house of Jehovah was finished.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to
Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> And Huram sent him by his servants ships,
and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the
servants of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched thence four hundred and fifty
talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> And the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of
Solomon, and came to Jerusalem to prove Solomon with enigmas; with a
very great train, and camels that bore spices and gold in great
abundance, and precious stones; and she came to Solomon, and spoke with
him of all that was in her heart.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> And Solomon explained to her all she spoke
of, and there was not a thing hidden from Solomon that he did not
explain to her.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> And when the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom
of Solomon, and the house that he had built,

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> and the food of his table, and the
deportment of his servants, and the order of service of his attendants
and their apparel, and his cupbearers and their apparel, and his ascent
by which he went up to the house of Jehovah, there was no more spirit in
her.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> And she said to the king, It was a true
report that I heard in mine own land of thine affairs and of thy wisdom;

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> but I gave no credit to their words, until
I came and mine eyes had seen; and behold, the half of the greatness of
thy wisdom was not told me: thou exceedest the report that I heard.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy
servants, who stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom!

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted
in thee, to set thee on his throne, to be king to Jehovah thy God!
Because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore did
he make thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> And she gave the king a hundred and twenty
talents of gold, and spices in very great abundance, and precious
stones; neither was there any such spice as that which the queen of
Sheba gave to king Solomon.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> (And the servants also of Huram, and the
servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought sandal-wood
and precious stones.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> And the king made of the sandal-wood
stairs for the house of Jehovah, and for the king's house, and harps and
lutes for the singers. And there were none such seen before in the land
of Judah.)

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> And king Solomon gave to the queen of
Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides what she had brought
to the king. And she turned and went to her own land, she and her
servants.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> And the weight of gold that came to
Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> besides \[what\] dealers and merchants
brought, and \[what\] all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the
country brought of gold and silver to Solomon.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> And king Solomon made two hundred targets
of beaten gold, -- he applied six hundred \[shekels\] of beaten gold to
one target;

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> and three hundred shields of beaten gold,
-- he applied three hundred \[shekels\] of gold to one shield; and the
king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> And the king made a great throne of
ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold;

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> and the throne had six steps, with a
footstool of gold fastened to the throne; and there were arms on each
side at the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the arms;

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> and twelve lions stood there on the one
side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in
any kingdom.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> And all king Solomon's drinking vessels
were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon
were of precious gold: silver was not of the least account in the days
of Solomon.

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> For the king's ships went to Tarshish
with the servants of Huram: once in three years came the ships of
Tarshish, bringing gold and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> And king Solomon was greater than all the
kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> And all the kings of the earth sought the
presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> And they brought every man his present,
vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and clothing, armour, and spices,
horses and mules, a rate year by year.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> And Solomon had four thousand stalls for
horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; and he placed them in
the chariot-cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> And he ruled over all the kings from the
river as far as the land of the Philistines, and up to the border of
Egypt.

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> And the king made silver in Jerusalem as
stones, and cedars made he as the sycamores that are in the lowland for
abundance.

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> And they brought to Solomon horses out of
Egypt, and out of all lands.

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> And the rest of the acts of Solomon first
and last, are they not written in the words of Nathan the prophet, and
in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the
seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all
Israel forty years.

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> And Solomon slept with his fathers, and
they buried him in the city of David his father; and Rehoboam his son
reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> And Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all
Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> And it came to pass when Jeroboam the son
of Nebat heard it (now he was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the
presence of king Solomon) that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> And they sent and called him; and
Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam saying,

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> Thy father made our yoke grievous; and
now lighten the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke
that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> And he said to them, Come again to me
after three days. And the people departed.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> And king Rehoboam consulted with the old
men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying,
How do ye advise to return answer to this people?

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> And they spoke to him saying, If thou be
kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they
will be thy servants for ever.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> But he forsook the advice of the old men
which they had given him, and consulted with the young men, who had
grown up with him, that stood before him.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> And he said to them, What advice give ye
that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me saying,
Lighten the yoke which thy father put upon us?

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> And the young men that had grown up
with him spoke to him saying, Thus shalt thou say to the people who have
spoken to thee saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, and lighten thou
it for us, -- thus shalt thou say to them: My little \[finger\] is
thicker than my father's loins;

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> and whereas my father laid a heavy yoke
upon you, \*I\* will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with
whips, but \*I\* \[will chastise you\] with scorpions.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> And Jeroboam and all the people came to
Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed saying, Come again to
me on the third day.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> And the king answered them roughly; and
king Rehoboam forsook the advice of the old men,

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> and spoke to them according to the
advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but
\*I\* will add to it; my father chastised you with whips, but \*I\*
\[will chastise you\] with scorpions.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> So the king hearkened not to the
people; for it was brought about by God, that Jehovah might give effect
to his word, which he spoke through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the
son of Nebat.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> And all Israel saw that the king
hearkened not to them; and the people answered the king saying, What
portion have we in David? and \[we have\] no inheritance in the son of
Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel. Now see to thine own house,
David! And all Israel went to their tents.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> But as for the children of Israel that
dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> And king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was
over the levy; but the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that
he died. And king Rehoboam hastened to mount his chariot, to flee to
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> And Israel rebelled against the house
of David, unto this day.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> And Rehoboam came to Jerusalem; and he
assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand
chosen men apt for war, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the
kingdom again to Rehoboam.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> But the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah
the man of God, saying,

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon,
king of Judah, and unto all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> Thus saith Jehovah: Go not up, nor fight
with your brethren; return every man to his house; for this thing is
from me. And they hearkened to the words of Jehovah, and returned from
going against Jeroboam.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and
built cities for defence in Judah.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> And he built Bethlehem, and Etam, and
Tekoa,

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> and Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam,

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> and Zorah, and Ajalon, and Hebron,
which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> And he fortified the strongholds, and
put captains in them, and stores of victuals, and of oil and wine;

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> and in every several city, targets and
spears, and made them exceedingly strong. And Judah and Benjamin were
his.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> And the priests and the Levites that
were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their districts;

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> for the Levites left their suburbs and
their possessions, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his
sons had cast them off from exercising the priesthood to Jehovah;

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> and he ordained for himself priests for
the high places, and for the he-goats and for the calves that he had
made.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> -- And after them, those out of all the
tribes of Israel that set their heart to seek Jehovah the God of Israel
came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice to Jehovah the God of their fathers.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> And they strengthened the kingdom of
Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong three years; for
during three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> And Rehoboam took Mahalath the daughter
of Jerimoth the son of David as wife, \[and of\] Abihail the daughter of
Eliab the son of Jesse.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> And she bore him children: Jeush, and
Shemariah, and Zaham.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> And after her he took Maachah the
daughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and
Shelomith.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter
of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines; for he had taken
eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and he begot twenty-eight sons and
sixty daughters.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> And Rehoboam established Abijah the son
of Maachah at the head, to be ruler among his brethren; for \[he
thought\] to make him king.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of
all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to all the
fortified cities; and he gave them food in abundance. And he desired
\[for them\] a multitude of wives.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> And it came to pass when the kingdom of
Rehoboam was established, and when he had become strong, \[that\] he
forsook the law of Jehovah, and all Israel with him.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> And it came to pass in the fifth year of
king Rehoboam, because they had transgressed against Jehovah, that
Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem,

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> with twelve hundred chariots and sixty
thousand horsemen; and the people were without number that came with him
out of Egypt: Libyans, Sukkites, and Ethiopians.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> And he took the fortified cities that
belonged to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> And Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam
and \[to\] the princes of Judah that had gathered together to Jerusalem
because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus saith Jehovah: Ye have
forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> And the princes of Israel and the king
humbled themselves; and they said, Jehovah is righteous.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> And when Jehovah saw that they humbled
themselves, the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah, saying, They have
humbled themselves: I will not destroy them, but I will grant them a
little deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem
by the hand of Shishak.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> Nevertheless they shall be his servants;
that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the
countries.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> And Shishak king of Egypt came up against
Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the
treasures of the king's house; he took away all; and he took away the
shields of gold that Solomon had made.

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> And king Rehoboam made in their stead
shields of bronze, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the
couriers who kept the entrance of the king's house.

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> And it was so, that as often as the
king entered into the house of Jehovah, the couriers came and fetched
them, and brought them again into the chamber of the couriers.

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> And when he humbled himself, the anger
of Jehovah turned away from him, that he would not destroy him
altogether; and also in Judah there were good things.

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> And king Rehoboam strengthened himself
in Jerusalem, and reigned; for Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he
began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city
that Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name
there: and his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> And he did evil, for he applied not his
heart to seek Jehovah.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> And the acts of Rehoboam, first and
last, are they not written in the words of Shemaiah the prophet, and of
Iddo the seer, in the genealogical registers? And there were wars
between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> And Rehoboam slept with his fathers,
and was buried in the city of David. And Abijah his son reigned in his
stead.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam
began Abijah to reign over Judah.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> He reigned three years in Jerusalem; and
his mother's name was Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And
there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> And Abijah began the war with an army of
men of war, four hundred thousand chosen men; and Jeroboam set the
battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men,
mighty men of valour.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> And Abijah stood up on the top of mount
Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, Jeroboam, and
all Israel!

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> Ought ye not to know that Jehovah the God
of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, to him and to
his sons \[by\] a covenant of salt?

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> But Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the
servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his
lord.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> And vain men, sons of Belial, gathered to
him and strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, and
Rehoboam was young and faint-hearted, and did not shew himself strong
against them.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> And now ye think to shew yourselves
strong against the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David;
and ye are a great multitude, and ye have with you the golden calves
that Jeroboam made you for gods.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> Have ye not cast out the priests of
Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests as the
peoples of the lands? whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young
bullock and seven rams, he becomes a priest of what is not God.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and
we have not forsaken him; and the priests that serve Jehovah are the
sons of Aaron, and the Levites are at their work:

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> and they burn to Jehovah every morning
and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense; the loaves also are
set in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with its
lamps to burn every evening: for \*we\* keep the charge of Jehovah our
God; but \*ye\* have forsaken him.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> And behold, we have God with us at our
head, and his priests, and the loud-sounding trumpets to sound an alarm
against you. Children of Israel, do not fight with Jehovah the God of
your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come
about behind them; and they were before Judah, and the ambush behind
them.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> And Judah looked back, and behold, they
had the battle in front and behind; and they cried to Jehovah, and the
priests sounded with the trumpets.

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> And the men of Judah gave a shout; and
as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass that God smote Jeroboam and
all Israel before Abijah and Judah.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> And the children of Israel fled before
Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> And Abijah and his people slew them
with a great slaughter; and there fell down slain of Israel five hundred
thousand chosen men.

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> And the children of Israel were humbled
at that time, and the children of Judah were strengthened, because they
relied upon Jehovah the God of their fathers.

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and
took cities from him: Bethel with its dependent villages, and Jeshanah
with its dependent villages, and Ephron with its dependent villages.

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> And Jeroboam did not recover strength
again in the days of Abijah; and Jehovah smote him, and he died.

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> But Abijah strengthened himself, and
took fourteen wives, and begot twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and
his ways and his sayings, are written in the treatise of the prophet
Iddo.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> And Abijah slept with his fathers, and
they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his
stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> And Asa did what was good and right in
the sight of Jehovah his God;

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> and he took away the altars of the
strange \[gods\] and the high places, and broke the columns, and cut
down the Asherahs;

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah the
God of their fathers, and to practise the law and the commandment.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> And he removed out of all the cities of
Judah the high places and the sun-images; and the kingdom was quiet
before him.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> And he built fortified cities in Judah,
for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because Jehovah
had given him rest.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> And he said to Judah, Let us build these
cities, and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars, while
the land is yet before us; for we have sought Jehovah our God; we have
sought him, and he has given us rest on every side. And they built and
prospered.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> And Asa had an army that bore targets and
spears: out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that
bore shields and drew the bow, two hundred and eighty thousand: all
these, mighty men of valour.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> And Zerah the Ethiopian came out against
him with a host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots, and
he came to Mareshah.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> And Asa went out against him, and they
set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah near Mareshah.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God, and
said, Jehovah, it maketh no difference to thee to help, whether there be
much or no power: help us, O Jehovah our God, for we rely on thee, and
in thy name have we come against this multitude. Jehovah, thou art our
God; let not man prevail against thee.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> And Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before
Asa and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> And Asa and the people that were with
him pursued them to Gerar; and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that none
of them was left alive; for they were crushed before Jehovah and before
his army. And they carried away very much spoil.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> And they smote all the cities round
about Gerar, for the terror of Jehovah came upon them; and they spoiled
all the cities, for there was very much spoil in them.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> They smote also the tents of cattle,
and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah
the son of Oded.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> And he went out to meet Asa, and said to
him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: Jehovah is with you
while ye are with him; and if ye seek him he will be found of you, but
if ye forsake him he will forsake you.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> Now for a long while Israel \[was\]
without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law;

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> but in their trouble they turned to
Jehovah the God of Israel, and sought him, and he was found of them.

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> And in those times there \[was\] no peace
to him that went out nor to him that came in, but great disturbances
were amongst all the inhabitants of the countries.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> And nation was broken against nation, and
city against city; for God disturbed them with all manner of distress.

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> But as for you, be firm and let not your
hands be weak; for there is a reward for your deeds.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> And when Asa heard these words and the
prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the
abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the
cities that he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of
Jehovah, that was before the porch of Jehovah.

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> And he assembled all Judah and Benjamin,
and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of
Simeon; for they fell away to him out of Israel in abundance, when they
saw that Jehovah his God was with him.

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> And they assembled themselves at
Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> And they sacrificed to Jehovah in that
day, of the spoil that they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven
thousand sheep.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> And they entered into a covenant to
seek Jehovah the God of their fathers, with all their heart, and with
all their soul,

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> and that whoever would not seek Jehovah
the God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great,
whether man or woman.

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> And they swore to Jehovah with a loud
voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> And all Judah rejoiced at the oath; for
they took the oath with all their heart, and sought him with their whole
desire; and he was found of them. And Jehovah gave them rest round
about.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> And also Maachah, the mother of Asa the
king, he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol for the
Asherah; and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burned it in the
valley Kidron.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> But the high places were not removed
from Israel; only, Asa's heart was perfect all his days.

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> And he brought into the house of God
the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which he
himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> And there was no war until the
thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of
Asa, Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, in
order to let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> And Asa brought out silver and gold out
of the treasures of the house of Jehovah and of the king's house, and
sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, who dwelt at Damascus, saying,

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> There is a league between me and thee,
and between my father and thy father: behold, I send thee silver and
gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may
depart from me.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> And Ben-hadad hearkened to king Asa, and
sent the captains of his forces against the cities of Israel; and they
smote Ijon and Dan and Abelmaim, and all the store-magazines of the
cities of Naphtali.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> And it came to pass when Baasha heard of
it, that he left off building Ramah, and let his work cease.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> And king Asa took all Judah; and they
carried away the stones and the timber from Ramah, with which Baasha had
been building, and he built with them Geba and Mizpah.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> And at that time Hanani the seer came to
Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the
king of Syria, and hast not relied on Jehovah thy God, therefore has the
army of the king of Syria escaped out of thy hand.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a
huge army, with very many chariots and horsemen? but when thou didst
rely on Jehovah, he delivered them into thy hand.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> For the eyes of Jehovah run to and fro
through the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of those
whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly; for
from henceforth thou shalt have wars.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> And Asa was wroth with the seer, and
put him in the prison; for he was enraged with him because of this. And
Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> And behold the acts of Asa, first and
last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and
Israel.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> And Asa in the thirty-ninth year of his
reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was extremely great;
yet in his disease he did not seek Jehovah, but the physicians.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> And Asa slept with his fathers, and
died in the one-and-fortieth year of his reign.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> And they buried him in his own
sepulchre, which he had excavated for himself in the city of David, and
laid him in a bed filled with spices, a mixture of divers kinds prepared
by the perfumer's art; and they made a very great burning for him.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his
stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> And he placed forces in all the fortified
cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the
cities of Ephraim that Asa his father had taken.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> And Jehovah was with Jehoshaphat, for he
walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto the
Baals;

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> but he sought the God of his father, and
walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> And Jehovah established the kingdom in
his hand; and all Judah gave gifts to Jehoshaphat; and he had riches and
honour in abundance.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> And he took courage in the ways of
Jehovah; moreover, he removed the high places and Asherahs out of Judah.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> And in the third year of his reign he
sent his princes, Ben-hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethaneel,
and Micah, to teach in the cities of Judah;

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> and with them the Levites: Shemaiah, and
Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jonathan, and
Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-Adonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama
and Jehoram, the priests.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> And they taught in Judah, and had the
book of the law of Jehovah with them; and they went about through all
the cities of Judah, and taught among the people.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> And the terror of Jehovah was upon all
the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, and they made no
war against Jehoshaphat.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> And some of the Philistines brought
Jehoshaphat gifts and tribute-silver. The Arabians also brought him
flocks, seven thousand seven hundred rams, and seven thousand seven
hundred he-goats.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> And Jehoshaphat waxed exceeding great;
and he built in Judah castles and store-cities.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> And he had much business in the cities
of Judah; and men of war, strong and valiant, in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> And these are the numbers of them
according to their fathers' houses. Of Judah the captains of thousands:
Adnah the captain, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of
valour;

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> and next to him was Johanan the
captain, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand;

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> and next to him, Amasiah the son of
Zichri, who willingly offered himself to Jehovah; and with him two
hundred thousand mighty men of valour.

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> And of Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man
of valour, and with him two hundred thousand, armed with bow and shield;

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> and next to him was Jehozabad, and with
him a hundred and eighty thousand ready prepared for war.

<span id="an_17:19">17:19</span> These were they that waited on the
king, besides those that the king had put in the fortified cities
throughout Judah.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> And Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in
abundance; and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> And after \[certain\] years he went down
to Ahab, to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in
abundance, and for the people that were with him, and urged him to go up
against Ramoth-Gilead.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> And Ahab king of Israel said to
Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-Gilead? And he
said to him, I am as thou, and my people as thy people; and \[I will
be\] with thee in the war.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> And Jehoshaphat said to the king of
Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, this day of the word of Jehovah.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> And the king of Israel assembled the
prophets, four hundred men, and said to them, Shall we go against
Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, and
God will give it into the king's hand.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a
prophet of Jehovah besides, that we might inquire of him?

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> And the king of Israel said to
Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah; but
I hate him, for he prophesies no good concerning me, but always evil:
\[it is\] Micah the son of Imlah. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king
say so.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> Then the king of Israel called a
chamberlain, and said, Fetch quickly Micah the son of Imlah.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat
the king of Judah, having put on their robes, sat each on his throne;
and they sat in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria;
and all the prophets prophesied before them.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made
for himself horns of iron, and he said, Thus saith Jehovah: With these
shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have exterminated them.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> And all the prophets prophesied so,
saying, Go up to Ramoth-Gilead, and prosper; for Jehovah will give it
into the king's hand.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> And the messenger that went to call
Micah spoke to him saying, Behold, the words of the prophets \[declare\]
good to the king with one assent: let thy word therefore, I pray thee,
be like one of theirs, and declare good.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> And Micah said, As Jehovah liveth, even
what my God shall say, that will I declare.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> And he came to the king. And the king
said to him, Micah, shall we go against Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or
shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper; and they will be
given into your hands.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> And the king said to him, How many
times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but truth in the
name of Jehovah?

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> And he said, I saw all Israel scattered
upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And Jehovah said,
These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> And the king of Israel said to
Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he prophesies no good concerning
me, but evil?

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> And he said, Hear ye therefore the word
of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting upon his throne, and all the host of
heaven standing on his right hand and on his left;

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> and Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab
king of Israel that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead? And one
spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> And there came forth a spirit, and
stood before Jehovah and said, I will entice him. And Jehovah said unto
him, Wherewith?

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> And he said, I will go forth, and will
be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou
shalt entice \[him\], and also succeed: go forth, and do so.

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> And now, behold, Jehovah has put a
lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets; and Jehovah has spoken
evil concerning thee.

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went
near, and smote Micah upon the cheek, and said, Which way now went the
Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak to thee?

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> And Micah said, Behold, thou shalt see
on that day when thou shalt go from chamber to chamber to hide thyself.

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> And the king of Israel said, Take ye
Micah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash
the king's son;

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> and ye shall say, Thus says the king:
Put this \[man\] in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction
and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> And Micah said, If thou return at all
in peace, Jehovah has not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O peoples,
all of you!

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat
the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-Gilead.

<span id="an_18:29">18:29</span> And the king of Israel said to
Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will enter into the battle; but
put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself; and
they went into the battle.

<span id="an_18:30">18:30</span> And the king of Syria commanded the
captains of his chariots saying, Fight neither with small nor great, but
with the king of Israel only.

<span id="an_18:31">18:31</span> And it came to pass when the captains
of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, That is the king of
Israel; and they surrounded him to fight; and Jehoshaphat cried out, and
Jehovah helped him; and God diverted them from him.

<span id="an_18:32">18:32</span> And it came to pass that when the
captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel,
they turned back from pursuing him.

<span id="an_18:33">18:33</span> And a man drew a bow at a venture, and
smote the king of Israel between the fastenings and the corslet. And he
said to the charioteer, Turn thy hand and drive me out of the camp; for
I am wounded.

<span id="an_18:34">18:34</span> And the battle increased that day; and
the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians
until the even; and about the time of the going down of the sun he died.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> And Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned to
his house in peace to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> And Jehu the son of Hanani, the seer,
went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help
the ungodly, and love them that hate Jehovah? Therefore is wrath upon
thee from Jehovah.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> Nevertheless there are good things found
in thee; for thou hast put away the Asherahs out of the land, and hast
directed thy heart to seek God.

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> And Jehoshaphat dwelt in Jerusalem; and
he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and
brought them back to Jehovah the God of their fathers.

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> And he set judges in the land throughout
the fortified cities of Judah, city by city.

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> And he said to the judges, Take heed what
ye do; for ye judge not for man, but for Jehovah, who will be with you
in the matter of judgment.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> And now, let the terror of Jehovah be
upon you; be careful what ye do, for there is no iniquity with Jehovah,
nor respect of persons, nor taking of presents.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> -- And moreover in Jerusalem did
Jehoshaphat set some of the Levites and priests, and of the chief
fathers of Israel, for the judgment of Jehovah and for causes. -- And
they returned to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> And he charged them saying, Thus shall ye
do in the fear of Jehovah faithfully and with a perfect heart.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> And what cause soever comes to you of
your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood,
between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, ye shall even warn
them that they trespass not against Jehovah, and so wrath come upon you
and upon your brethren: this do and ye shall not trespass.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> And behold, Amariah the chief priest is
over you in all matters of Jehovah, and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael,
prince of the house of Judah, in all the king's matters; and ye have the
Levites before you as officers. Be strong and do it, and Jehovah will be
with the good.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> And it came to pass after this \[that\]
the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them certain
of the Maonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> And they came and told Jehoshaphat
saying, A great multitude is come against thee from beyond the sea, from
Syria; and behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar, which is Engedi.

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself
to seek Jehovah, and proclaimed a fast throughout Judah.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> And Judah gathered themselves together to
ask \[help\] of Jehovah: even out of all the cities of Judah they came
to seek Jehovah.

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation
of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of Jehovah, before the new court;

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> and he said, Jehovah, God of our fathers,
art not thou God in the heavens, and rulest thou not over all the
kingdoms of the nations? And in thy hand there is power and might, and
none can withstand thee.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> Hast not thou, our God, dispossessed the
inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and given it for ever
to the seed of Abraham, thy friend?

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> And they have dwelt therein, and have
built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying,

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> If evil come upon us, sword, judgment, or
pestilence, or famine, and we stand before this house and before thee --
for thy name is in this house -- and cry unto thee in our distress, then
thou wilt hear and save.

<span id="an_20:10">20:10</span> And now, behold, the children of Ammon
and Moab, and those of mount Seir, amongst whom thou wouldest not let
Israel go when they came out of the land of Egypt, (for they turned from
them, and destroyed them not,)

<span id="an_20:11">20:11</span> behold, they reward us, in coming to
cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to possess.

<span id="an_20:12">20:12</span> Our God, wilt thou not judge them? for
we have no might in presence of this great company which cometh against
us, neither know we what to do; but our eyes are upon thee.

<span id="an_20:13">20:13</span> And all Judah stood before Jehovah,
with their little ones, their wives, and their sons.

<span id="an_20:14">20:14</span> And upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah,
the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of
the sons of Asaph, upon him came the Spirit of Jehovah, in the midst of
the congregation;

<span id="an_20:15">20:15</span> and he said, Be attentive, all Judah,
and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat! Thus saith
Jehovah unto you: Fear not, nor be dismayed by reason of this great
multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.

<span id="an_20:16">20:16</span> To-morrow go down against them: behold,
they come up by the ascent of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of
the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel.

<span id="an_20:17">20:17</span> Ye shall not have to fight on this
occasion: set yourselves, stand and see the salvation of Jehovah \[who
is\] with you! Judah and Jerusalem, fear not nor be dismayed; to-morrow
go out against them, and Jehovah will be with you.

<span id="an_20:18">20:18</span> And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his
face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell
down before Jehovah, worshipping Jehovah.

<span id="an_20:19">20:19</span> And the Levites, of the sons of the
Kohathites, and of the sons of the Korahites, stood up to praise Jehovah
the God of Israel with an exceeding loud voice.

<span id="an_20:20">20:20</span> And they rose early in the morning, and
went forth towards the wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went forth,
Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, Judah, and ye inhabitants of
Jerusalem! Believe in Jehovah your God, and ye shall be established;
believe his prophets, and ye shall prosper!

<span id="an_20:21">20:21</span> And he consulted with the people, and
appointed singers to Jehovah, and those that should praise in holy
splendour, as they went forth before the armed men, and say, Give thanks
to Jehovah; for his loving-kindness \[endureth\] for ever!

<span id="an_20:22">20:22</span> And when they began the song of triumph
and praise, Jehovah set liers-in-wait against the children of Ammon,
Moab, and mount Seir, who had come against Judah, and they were smitten.

<span id="an_20:23">20:23</span> And the children of Ammon and Moab
stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, to exterminate and
destroy \[them\]; and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of
Seir, they helped to destroy one another.

<span id="an_20:24">20:24</span> And Judah came on to the mountain-watch
in the wilderness, and they looked toward the multitude; and behold,
they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none had escaped.

<span id="an_20:25">20:25</span> And Jehoshaphat and his people came to
plunder the spoil of them, and they found among them in abundance, both
riches with the dead bodies, and precious things, and they stripped off
for themselves more than they could carry away; and they were three days
in plundering the spoil, it was so much.

<span id="an_20:26">20:26</span> And on the fourth day they assembled
themselves in the valley of Berachah, for there they blessed Jehovah;
therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Berachah, to
this day.

<span id="an_20:27">20:27</span> And they returned, all the men of Judah
and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat at their head, to go again to Jerusalem
with joy; for Jehovah had made them to rejoice over their enemies.

<span id="an_20:28">20:28</span> And they came to Jerusalem with lutes
and harps and trumpets, to the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_20:29">20:29</span> And the terror of God was on all the
kingdoms of the lands, when they had heard that Jehovah fought against
the enemies of Israel.

<span id="an_20:30">20:30</span> And the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet;
and his God gave him rest round about.

<span id="an_20:31">20:31</span> And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he
was thirty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned
twenty-five years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Azubah,
daughter of Shilhi.

<span id="an_20:32">20:32</span> And he walked in the way of Asa his
father, and turned not aside from it, doing what was right in the sight
of Jehovah.

<span id="an_20:33">20:33</span> Only, the high places were not removed;
and as yet the people had not directed their hearts to the God of their
fathers.

<span id="an_20:34">20:34</span> And the rest of the acts of
Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the words of
Jehu the son of Hanani, which are inserted in the book of the kings of
Israel.

<span id="an_20:35">20:35</span> And after this Jehoshaphat king of
Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly.

<span id="an_20:36">20:36</span> And he joined himself with him to make
ships to go to Tarshish; and they made the ships in Ezion-geber.

<span id="an_20:37">20:37</span> And Eliezer the son of Dodavah, of
Mareshah, prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast
joined thyself with Ahaziah, Jehovah has broken thy works. And the ships
were broken, and could not go to Tarshish.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers,
and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Jehoram his
son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> And he had brethren, the sons of
Jehoshaphat: Azariah and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and
Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were sons of Jehoshaphat king of
Israel.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> And their father had given them great
gifts of silver and of gold and of precious things, besides fortified
cities in Judah; but the kingdom he gave to Jehoram, for he was the
firstborn.

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> And Jehoram established himself over the
kingdom of his father, and strengthened himself; and he slew all his
brethren with the sword, and \[certain\] also of the princes of Israel.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he
began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> And he walked in the way of the kings of
Israel, as did the house of Ahab, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife;
and he did evil in the sight of Jehovah.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> But Jehovah would not destroy the house
of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he
had promised to give to him always a lamp, and to his sons.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> In his days Edom revolted from under the
hand of Judah, and they set a king over themselves.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> And Jehoram went over with his captains,
and all the chariots with him; and he rose up by night, and smote the
Edomites who had surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots.

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> But the Edomites revolted from under
the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time
from under his hand, because he had forsaken Jehovah the God of his
fathers.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> Moreover he made high places on the
mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit
fornication, and compelled Judah \[thereto\].

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> And there came a writing to him from
Elijah the prophet saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy
father: Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy
father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> but hast walked in the way of the kings
of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to
commit fornication, like the fornications of the house of Ahab, and also
hast slain thy brethren, thy father's house who were better than
thyself:

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> behold, Jehovah will smite with a great
stroke thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy
substance,

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> and thyself with sore sicknesses, with
a disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the
sickness day by day.

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> And Jehovah stirred up against Jehoram
the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, who \[are\] near the
Ethiopians;

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> and they came up into Judah, and broke
into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's
house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was no son left
him, except Jehoahaz the youngest of his sons.

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> And after all this, Jehovah smote him
in his bowels with an incurable sickness.

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> And it came to pass, from day to day,
and at the time when the second year was drawing to a close, that his
bowels fell out by reason of his sickness, and he died in cruel
sufferings. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of
his fathers.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> He was thirty-two years old when he
began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed
without being regretted. And they buried him in the city of David, but
not in the sepulchres of the kings.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made
Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead; for the band of men that
came in the camp with the Arabians had slain all the elder ones. And
Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he
began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem; and his mother's
name was Athaliah, daughter of Omri.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> He also walked in the ways of the house
of Ahab; for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah
like the house of Ahab; for they were his counsellors after the death of
his father, to his destruction.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> He walked also after their counsel, and
went with Jehoram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, to the war against
Hazael the king of Syria at Ramoth-Gilead; and the Syrians wounded
Joram.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> And he returned to be healed in Jizreel
because of the wounds that were given him at Ramah, when he fought with
Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah,
went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jizreel; for he was sick.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> But his coming to Joram was from God the
complete ruin of Ahaziah. And when he had come, he went out with Jehoram
against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah had anointed to cut off the
house of Ahab.

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> And it came to pass when Jehu was
executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, that he found the princes of
Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that attended upon
Ahaziah, and he slew them.

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> And he sought Ahaziah; and they caught
him (for he had hid himself in Samaria), and brought him to Jehu, and
slew him; and they buried him, for they said, He is a son of
Jehoshaphat, who sought Jehovah with all his heart. And in the house of
Ahaziah there was no one who was able to \[hold\] the kingdom.

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah
saw that her son was dead, she rose up and exterminated all the royal
seed of the house of Judah.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> But Jehoshabeath the daughter of the
king took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him from among the king's
sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedchamber. So
Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the
priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so
that she did not slay him;

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> and he was with them hid in the house
of God six years. And Athaliah reigned over the land.

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> And in the seventh year Jehoiada
strengthened himself, and took the captains of the hundreds, Azariah the
son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of
Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri,
into covenant with him.

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> And they went about in Judah and gathered
together the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief
fathers of Israel; and they came to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> And all the congregation made a covenant
with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, Behold, the
king's son shall reign, as Jehovah has said of the sons of David.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> This is the thing which ye shall do: a
third part of you that come in on the sabbath, of the priests and of the
Levites, shall be keepers of the doors;

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> and a third part shall be at the king's
house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation; and all the
people shall be in the courts of the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> But let none come into the house of
Jehovah except the priests and those of the Levites that do the service;
they shall go in, for they are holy; but all the people shall keep the
watch of Jehovah.

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> And the Levites shall encompass the king
round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he that comes
into the house shall be put to death; and ye shall be with the king when
he comes in and when he goes out.

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> And the Levites and all Judah did
according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every
man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that
were to go forth on the sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest did not
liberate the divisions.

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> And Jehoiada the priest gave to the
captains of the hundreds king David's spears and shields and targets,
which were in the house of God.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> And he set all the people, every man
with his javelin in his hand, from the right side of the house to the
left side of the house, toward the altar and the house, by the king
round about.

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> And they brought forth the king's son,
and put the crown upon him, and \[gave him\] the testimony, and made him
king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, Long live the
king!

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> And Athaliah heard the noise of the
people running and praising the king, and she came to the people into
the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> And she looked, and behold, the king
stood on his dais at the entrance, and the princes and the trumpets were
by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with
trumpets; and the singers \[were there\] with the instruments of music,
and such as taught to sing praise. And Athaliah rent her garments, and
said, Conspiracy! Conspiracy!

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> And Jehoiada the priest brought out the
captains of the hundreds that were set over the host, and said to them,
Lead her forth without the ranks; and whosoever follows her, let him be
slain with the sword; for the priest said, Ye shall not put her to death
in the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> And they made way for her, and she went
through the entrance of the horse-gate into the king's house, and they
put her to death there.

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> And Jehoiada made a covenant between
himself and all the people and the king, that they should be the people
of Jehovah.

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> And all the people went into the house
of Baal, and broke it down; and they broke his altars and his images in
pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.

<span id="an_23:18">23:18</span> And Jehoiada appointed the offices of
the house of Jehovah under the hand of the priests, the Levites, whom
David had set by classes over the house of Jehovah to offer up Jehovah's
burnt-offerings, as it is written in the law of Moses, -- with rejoicing
and with singing according to the directions of David.

<span id="an_23:19">23:19</span> And he set the doorkeepers at the gates
of the house of Jehovah, that no one unclean in anything should enter
in.

<span id="an_23:20">23:20</span> And he took the captains of the
hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the
people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of Jehovah;
and they came through the upper gate into the king's house, and set the
king upon the throne of the kingdom.

<span id="an_23:21">23:21</span> And all the people of the land
rejoiced, and the city was quiet; and they had slain Athaliah with the
sword.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> Joash was seven years old when he began
to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name
was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> And Joash did what was right in the sight
of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and
he begot sons and daughters.

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> And it came to pass after this, that
Joash was minded to renew the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> And he gathered together the priests and
the Levites, and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah and collect
of all Israel money for the repair of the house of your God from year to
year, and ye shall hasten the matter. But the Levites hastened it not.

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> And the king called for Jehoiada the
chief, and said to him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to
bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tribute of Moses the
servant of Jehovah \[laid upon\] the congregation of Israel, for the
tent of the testimony?

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> For the wicked Athaliah \[and\] her sons
had devastated the house of God; and also all the hallowed things of the
house of Jehovah had they employed for the Baals.

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> And the king commanded, and they made a
chest, and set it at the gate of the house of Jehovah without,

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> and they made a proclamation through
Judah and Jerusalem, to bring to Jehovah the tribute of Moses the
servant of God \[laid upon\] Israel in the wilderness.

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> And all the princes and all the people
rejoiced, and brought in and cast into the chest, until they had
finished.

<span id="an_24:11">24:11</span> And it came to pass at the time the
chest was brought for the king's control by the hand of the Levites, and
when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and high
priest's officer came, and they emptied the chest, and took it, and
carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered
money in abundance.

<span id="an_24:12">24:12</span> And the king and Jehoiada gave it to
such as did the work of the service of the house of Jehovah, and they
hired masons and carpenters to renew the house of Jehovah, and also such
as wrought in iron and bronze, to repair the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_24:13">24:13</span> So the workmen wrought, and the work
was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in its state, and
strengthened it.

<span id="an_24:14">24:14</span> And when they had finished, they
brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada; and they
made of it vessels for the house of Jehovah, utensils to minister, and
with which to offer up, and cups, and utensils of gold and silver. And
they offered up burnt-offerings in the house of Jehovah continually all
the days of Jehoiada.

<span id="an_24:15">24:15</span> And Jehoiada grew old and was full of
days, and he died; he was a hundred and thirty years old when he died.

<span id="an_24:16">24:16</span> And they buried him in the city of
David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward
God and toward his house.

<span id="an_24:17">24:17</span> And after the death of Jehoiada the
princes of Judah came and made obeisance to the king; then the king
hearkened to them.

<span id="an_24:18">24:18</span> And they forsook the house of Jehovah
the God of their fathers, and served the Asherahs and idols; and wrath
came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.

<span id="an_24:19">24:19</span> And he sent prophets among them to
bring them again to Jehovah, and they testified against them; but they
would not give ear.

<span id="an_24:20">24:20</span> And the Spirit of God came upon
Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood up above the
people and said unto them, Thus saith God: Wherefore do ye transgress
the commandments of Jehovah? And ye cannot prosper; for ye have forsaken
Jehovah, and he hath forsaken you.

<span id="an_24:21">24:21</span> And they conspired against him, and
stoned him with stones at the command of the king in the court of the
house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_24:22">24:22</span> And king Joash remembered not the
kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son.
And when he died, he said, Jehovah see and require \[it\]!

<span id="an_24:23">24:23</span> And it came to pass at the end of the
year \[that\] the army of Syria came up against him; and they entered
into Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people
from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them to the king at
Damascus.

<span id="an_24:24">24:24</span> Truly with a small company of men came
the army of the Syrians, but Jehovah delivered a very great army into
their hand, because they had forsaken Jehovah the God of their fathers;
and they executed judgment upon Joash.

<span id="an_24:25">24:25</span> And when they had departed from him
(for they left him in great diseases), his own servants conspired
against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew
him on his bed, and he died; and they buried him in the city of David,
but they did not bury him in the sepulchres of the kings.

<span id="an_24:26">24:26</span> And these are they that conspired
against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the
son of Shimrith a Moabitess.

<span id="an_24:27">24:27</span> And as to his sons, and the greatness
of the burdens \[laid\] upon him, and the building of the house of God,
behold, they are written in the treatise of the book of the kings. And
Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_25:1">25:1</span> Amaziah was twenty-five years old
\[when\] he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine years in
Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_25:2">25:2</span> And he did what was right in the sight of
Jehovah, yet not with a perfect heart.

<span id="an_25:3">25:3</span> And it came to pass when the kingdom was
established unto him, that he killed his servants who had smitten the
king his father.

<span id="an_25:4">25:4</span> But their children he did not put to
death, but \[did\] according to that which is written in the law in the
book of Moses, wherein Jehovah commanded saying, The fathers shall not
die for the children, nor shall the children die for the fathers, but
every man shall die for his own sin.

<span id="an_25:5">25:5</span> And Amaziah gathered Judah together and
arranged them according to the fathers' houses, according to the
captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, throughout Judah and
Benjamin; and he numbered them from twenty years old and upwards, and
found them three hundred thousand choice men, able for military service,
that could handle spear and target.

<span id="an_25:6">25:6</span> He hired also a hundred thousand mighty
men of valour out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver.

<span id="an_25:7">25:7</span> But there came a man of God to him,
saying, O king, let not the host of Israel go with thee; for Jehovah is
not with Israel, \[with\] all the children of Ephraim.

<span id="an_25:8">25:8</span> But if thou wilt go, do \[it\]; be strong
for the battle: God will make thee fall before the enemy, for there is
with God power to help and to cast down.

<span id="an_25:9">25:9</span> And Amaziah said to the man of God, But
what is to be done for the hundred talents which I have given to the
troop of Israel? And the man of God said, Jehovah is able to give thee
much more than this.

<span id="an_25:10">25:10</span> Then Amaziah separated them, -- the
troop that was come to him out of Ephraim, -- to go home again. And
their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in
fierce anger.

<span id="an_25:11">25:11</span> But Amaziah strengthened himself, and
led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the
children of Seir ten thousand.

<span id="an_25:12">25:12</span> And the children of Judah took ten
thousand captive, alive, and brought them to the top of the cliff, and
cast them down from the top of the cliff, so that they all were broken
in pieces.

<span id="an_25:13">25:13</span> But those of the troop that Amaziah had
sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the
cities of Judah from Samaria as far as Beth-horon, and smote three
thousand of them, and took much spoil.

<span id="an_25:14">25:14</span> And it came to pass after Amaziah was
come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the
children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed himself down
before them, and burned incense to them.

<span id="an_25:15">25:15</span> And the anger of Jehovah was kindled
against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, who said to him, Why dost
thou seek after the gods of a people who have not delivered their own
people out of thy hand?

<span id="an_25:16">25:16</span> And it came to pass as he talked with
him, that \[Amaziah\] said to him, Hast thou been made the king's
counsellor? Forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet
forbore, and said, I know that God has determined to destroy thee,
because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened to my counsel.

<span id="an_25:17">25:17</span> And Amaziah king of Judah took counsel,
and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel,
saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.

<span id="an_25:18">25:18</span> And Joash king of Israel sent to
Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thorn-bush that is in Lebanon sent to
the cedar that is in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son as
wife; and there passed by the wild beast that is in Lebanon, and trode
down the thorn-bush.

<span id="an_25:19">25:19</span> Thou thinkest, Lo, thou hast smitten
Edom; and thy heart has lifted thee up to boast: abide now at home; why
shouldest thou contend with misfortune, that thou shouldest fall, thou
and Judah with thee?

<span id="an_25:20">25:20</span> But Amaziah would not hear; for it was
of God, that he might deliver them into \[the enemy's\] hand, because
they had sought after the gods of Edom.

<span id="an_25:21">25:21</span> And Joash king of Israel went up; and
they looked one another in the face, he and Amaziah king of Judah, at
Beth-shemesh, which is in Judah.

<span id="an_25:22">25:22</span> And Judah was routed before Israel; and
they fled every man to his tent.

<span id="an_25:23">25:23</span> And Joash king of Israel took Amaziah
king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh,
and brought him to Jerusalem, and he broke down the wall of Jerusalem
from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

<span id="an_25:24">25:24</span> And he \[took\] all the gold and the
silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with
Obed-Edom, and the treasures of the king's house, and hostages, and
returned to Samaria.

<span id="an_25:25">25:25</span> And Amaziah the son of Joash, king of
Judah, lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel,
fifteen years.

<span id="an_25:26">25:26</span> And the rest of the acts of Amaziah,
first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of
Judah and Israel?

<span id="an_25:27">25:27</span> And from the time that Amaziah turned
aside from following Jehovah, they made a conspiracy against him in
Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish; and they sent after him to Lachish,
and slew him there.

<span id="an_25:28">25:28</span> And they brought him on horses, and
buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.

<span id="an_26:1">26:1</span> And all the people of Judah took Uzziah,
who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father
Amaziah.

<span id="an_26:2">26:2</span> It was he that built Eloth, and restored
it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers.

<span id="an_26:3">26:3</span> Uzziah was sixteen years old when he
began to reign; and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem; and his
mother's name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_26:4">26:4</span> And he did what was right in the sight of
Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.

<span id="an_26:5">26:5</span> And he sought God in the days of
Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God; and in the days
that he sought Jehovah, God made him to prosper.

<span id="an_26:6">26:6</span> And he went forth and fought against the
Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh,
and the wall of Ashdod; and built cities about Ashdod, and among the
Philistines.

<span id="an_26:7">26:7</span> And God helped him against the
Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-Baal, and the
Maonites.

<span id="an_26:8">26:8</span> And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah:
and his name spread abroad to the entrance of Egypt; for he became
exceeding strong.

<span id="an_26:9">26:9</span> And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at
the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the angle, and fortified
them.

<span id="an_26:10">26:10</span> And he built towers in the desert and
digged many cisterns; for he had much cattle, both in the lowland and on
the plateau, husbandmen \[also\] and vinedressers on the mountains and
in Carmel; for he loved husbandry.

<span id="an_26:11">26:11</span> And Uzziah had an army of fighting men,
that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account
by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand
of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.

<span id="an_26:12">26:12</span> The whole number of the chief fathers
of the mighty men of valour was two thousand six hundred.

<span id="an_26:13">26:13</span> And under their hand was an army-host
of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred, that made war with
mighty power to help the king against the enemy.

<span id="an_26:14">26:14</span> And Uzziah prepared for them,
throughout the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of
mail, and bows, and even slinging-stones.

<span id="an_26:15">26:15</span> And he made in Jerusalem machines
invented by skilful men, to be upon the towers and upon the bulwarks,
wherewith to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name spread far
abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he became strong.

<span id="an_26:16">26:16</span> But when he became strong his heart was
lifted up to \[his\] downfall; and he transgressed against Jehovah his
God, and went into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the altar
of incense.

<span id="an_26:17">26:17</span> And Azariah the priest went in after
him, and with him priests of Jehovah, eighty valiant men;

<span id="an_26:18">26:18</span> and they withstood Uzziah the king, and
said to him, It is not for thee, Uzziah, to burn incense to Jehovah, but
for the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense.
Go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast transgressed; neither shall it be
for thine honour from Jehovah Elohim.

<span id="an_26:19">26:19</span> And Uzziah was wroth; and he had a
censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was wroth with the
priests, the leprosy rose up in his forehead before the priests in the
house of Jehovah, beside the incense altar.

<span id="an_26:20">26:20</span> And Azariah the chief priest and all
the priests looked upon him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead,
and they thrust him out from thence; even he himself hasted to go out,
because Jehovah had smitten him.

<span id="an_26:21">26:21</span> And Uzziah the king was a leper to the
day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, being a leper; for he
was cut off from the house of Jehovah. And Jotham his son was over the
king's house, judging the people of the land.

<span id="an_26:22">26:22</span> And the rest of the acts of Uzziah,
first and last, did the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz write.

<span id="an_26:23">26:23</span> And Uzziah slept with his fathers; and
they buried him with his fathers in the burial-ground of the kings, for
they said, He is a leper. And Jotham his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_27:1">27:1</span> Jotham was twenty-five years old when he
began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and his
mother's name was Jerushah, daughter of Zadok.

<span id="an_27:2">27:2</span> And he did what was right in the sight of
Jehovah, according to all that his father Uzziah had done; only he
entered not into the temple of Jehovah. And the people still acted
corruptly.

<span id="an_27:3">27:3</span> It was he who built the upper gate of the
house of Jehovah, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.

<span id="an_27:4">27:4</span> And he built cities in the hill-country
of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.

<span id="an_27:5">27:5</span> And he fought against the king of the
children of Ammon, and overcame them. And the children of Ammon gave him
the same year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of
wheat, and ten thousand of barley. This the children of Ammon brought
again to him also in the second year, and in the third.

<span id="an_27:6">27:6</span> And Jotham became strong, for he prepared
his ways before Jehovah his God.

<span id="an_27:7">27:7</span> And the rest of the acts of Jotham, and
all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the
kings of Israel and Judah.

<span id="an_27:8">27:8</span> He was twenty-five years old when he
began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_27:9">27:9</span> And Jotham slept with his fathers, and
they buried him in the city of David; and Ahaz his son reigned in his
stead.

<span id="an_28:1">28:1</span> Ahaz was twenty years old when he began
to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not what
was right in the sight of Jehovah, like David his father,

<span id="an_28:2">28:2</span> but walked in the ways of the kings of
Israel, and even made molten images for the Baals;

<span id="an_28:3">28:3</span> and he burned incense in the valley of
the son of Hinnom, and burned his sons in the fire, according to the
abominations of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed from before
the children of Israel.

<span id="an_28:4">28:4</span> And he sacrificed and burned incense on
the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.

<span id="an_28:5">28:5</span> Therefore Jehovah his God gave him into
the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a
great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he
was also given into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a
great slaughter.

<span id="an_28:6">28:6</span> And Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in
Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all valiant men, because
they had forsaken Jehovah the God of their fathers.

<span id="an_28:7">28:7</span> And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew
Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and
Elkanah the second to the king.

<span id="an_28:8">28:8</span> And the children of Israel carried away
captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and
daughters, and took away also much spoil from them, and brought the
spoil to Samaria.

<span id="an_28:9">28:9</span> But a prophet of Jehovah was there, whose
name was Oded; and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and
said unto them, Behold, because Jehovah the God of your fathers was
wroth with Judah, he gave them into your hand, and ye have slain them in
a rage that reaches up to heaven.

<span id="an_28:10">28:10</span> And now ye think to subjugate the
children of Judah and Jerusalem as your bondmen and bondwomen. Are there
not with you, even with you, trespasses against Jehovah your God?

<span id="an_28:11">28:11</span> And now hear me, and send back the
captives again, whom ye have taken captive of your brethren; for the
fierce wrath of Jehovah is upon you.

<span id="an_28:12">28:12</span> And certain of the heads of the
children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of
Meshillemoth, and Hezekiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of
Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,

<span id="an_28:13">28:13</span> and said to them, Ye shall not bring in
the captives hither; because, for our guilt before Jehovah, ye think to
increase our sins and our trespasses: for our trespass is great, and
fierce wrath is upon Israel.

<span id="an_28:14">28:14</span> Then the armed men left the captives
and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.

<span id="an_28:15">28:15</span> And the men that have been expressed by
name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that
were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to
eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them
on asses, and brought them to Jericho the city of palm-trees, to their
brethren. And they returned to Samaria.

<span id="an_28:16">28:16</span> At that time king Ahaz sent to the
kings of Assyria to help him.

<span id="an_28:17">28:17</span> And again the Edomites came and smote
Judah, and carried away captives.

<span id="an_28:18">28:18</span> And the Philistines invaded the cities
of the lowland, and of the south of Judah, and took Beth-shemesh, and
Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Socho and its dependent villages, and Timnah
and its dependent villages, and Guimzo and its dependent villages; and
they dwelt there.

<span id="an_28:19">28:19</span> For Jehovah humbled Judah because of
Ahaz king of Israel, for he had made Judah lawless, and transgressed
much against Jehovah.

<span id="an_28:20">28:20</span> And Tilgath-Pilneser king of Assyria
came to him, and troubled him, and did not support him.

<span id="an_28:21">28:21</span> For Ahaz stripped the house of Jehovah,
and the house of the king and of the princes, and gave to the king of
Assyria; but he was of no help to him.

<span id="an_28:22">28:22</span> And in the time of his trouble he
transgressed yet more against Jehovah, this king Ahaz.

<span id="an_28:23">28:23</span> And he sacrificed to the gods of
Damascus, which had smitten him; and he said, Since the gods of the
kings of Syria help them, I will sacrifice to them, that they may help
me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.

<span id="an_28:24">28:24</span> And Ahaz gathered the vessels of the
house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and
closed the doors of the house of Jehovah, and he made for himself altars
in every corner of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_28:25">28:25</span> And in every several city of Judah he
made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger
Jehovah the God of his fathers.

<span id="an_28:26">28:26</span> And the rest of his acts, and all his
ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings
of Judah and Israel.

<span id="an_28:27">28:27</span> And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and
they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem; but they brought him not into
the sepulchres of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son reigned in
his stead.

<span id="an_29:1">29:1</span> Hezekiah began to reign being twenty-five
years old; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem; and his
mother's name was Abijah, daughter of Zechariah.

<span id="an_29:2">29:2</span> And he did what was right in the sight of
Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done.

<span id="an_29:3">29:3</span> He, in the first year of his reign, in
the first month, opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and repaired
them.

<span id="an_29:4">29:4</span> And he brought in the priests and the
Levites, and gathered them into the open place eastward;

<span id="an_29:5">29:5</span> and he said to them, Hear me, ye Levites:
hallow yourselves now, and hallow the house of Jehovah the God of your
fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the sanctuary.

<span id="an_29:6">29:6</span> For our fathers have transgressed, and
done evil in the sight of Jehovah our God, and have forsaken him and
turned away their faces from the habitation of Jehovah, and have turned
their backs.

<span id="an_29:7">29:7</span> Also they have shut up the doors of the
porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered up
burnt-offerings in the sanctuary to the God of Israel.

<span id="an_29:8">29:8</span> Therefore the wrath of Jehovah has been
upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he has delivered them to vexation, to
desolation, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.

<span id="an_29:9">29:9</span> And behold, our fathers have fallen by
the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity
for this.

<span id="an_29:10">29:10</span> Now it is in my heart to make a
covenant with Jehovah the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn
away from us.

<span id="an_29:11">29:11</span> My sons, be not now negligent; for
Jehovah has chosen you to stand before him, to do service unto him, and
to be his ministers and incense-burners.

<span id="an_29:12">29:12</span> Then the Levites rose up, Mahath the
son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the
Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah
the son of Jehalleleel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah,
and Eden the son of Joah;

<span id="an_29:13">29:13</span> and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri
and Jeiel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;

<span id="an_29:14">29:14</span> and of the sons of Heman, Jehiel and
Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.

<span id="an_29:15">29:15</span> And they gathered their brethren, and
hallowed themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king
by the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_29:16">29:16</span> And the priests went into the inner
part of the house of Jehovah to cleanse it, and carried forth all the
uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah, into the court of
the house of Jehovah. And the Levites took it to carry it forth into the
brook Kidron.

<span id="an_29:17">29:17</span> And they began on the first of the
first month to hallow, and on the eighth day of the month they came to
the porch of Jehovah; and they hallowed the house of Jehovah eight days;
and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.

<span id="an_29:18">29:18</span> And they went in to king Hezekiah, and
said, We have cleansed all the house of Jehovah, and the altar of
burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the table of the \[bread\] to
be set in rows, and all its vessels;

<span id="an_29:19">29:19</span> and all the vessels that king Ahaz in
his reign cast away in his transgression have we prepared and hallowed,
and behold, they are before the altar of Jehovah.

<span id="an_29:20">29:20</span> And Hezekiah the king arose early, and
gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_29:21">29:21</span> And they brought seven bullocks, and
seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats for a sin-offering for
the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the
priests the sons of Aaron to offer \[them\] upon the altar of Jehovah.

<span id="an_29:22">29:22</span> And they slaughtered the bullocks, and
the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar; and they
slaughtered the rams, and sprinkled the blood on the altar; and they
slaughtered the lambs, and sprinkled the blood on the altar.

<span id="an_29:23">29:23</span> And they brought near the he-goats of
the sin-offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid
their hands upon them.

<span id="an_29:24">29:24</span> And the priests slaughtered them, and
they made purification for sin with their blood upon the altar, to make
an atonement for all Israel; because for all Israel, said the king, is
the burnt-offering and the sin-offering.

<span id="an_29:25">29:25</span> And he set the Levites in the house of
Jehovah with cymbals, with lutes, and with harps, according to the
commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and of Nathan the
prophet; for the commandment was of Jehovah through his prophets.

<span id="an_29:26">29:26</span> And the Levites stood with the
instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.

<span id="an_29:27">29:27</span> And Hezekiah commanded to offer up the
burnt-offering on the altar. And at the moment the burnt-offering began,
the song of Jehovah began, and the trumpets, accompanied by the
instruments of David king of Israel.

<span id="an_29:28">29:28</span> And all the congregation worshipped,
and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded, all \[the time\] until
the burnt-offering was finished.

<span id="an_29:29">29:29</span> And when they had ended offering the
burnt-offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed
themselves and worshipped.

<span id="an_29:30">29:30</span> And king Hezekiah and the princes
commanded the Levites to sing praise to Jehovah with the words of David,
and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and bowed
their heads and worshipped.

<span id="an_29:31">29:31</span> And Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye
have consecrated yourselves to Jehovah, come near and bring sacrifices
and thank-offerings into the house of the Lord. And the congregation
brought in sacrifices and thank-offerings; and as many as were of a
willing heart, burnt-offerings.

<span id="an_29:32">29:32</span> And the number of the burnt-offerings,
which the congregation brought, was seventy bullocks, a hundred rams,
two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt-offering to Jehovah.

<span id="an_29:33">29:33</span> And the consecrated things were six
hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.

<span id="an_29:34">29:34</span> Only the priests were too few, and they
could not flay all the burnt-offerings; therefore their brethren the
Levites helped them, until the work was ended, and until the priests had
hallowed themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to
hallow themselves than the priests.

<span id="an_29:35">29:35</span> And also the burnt-offerings were in
abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and with the
drink-offerings for the burnt-offering. And the service of the house of
Jehovah was set in order.

<span id="an_29:36">29:36</span> And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the
people, that God had prepared the people; for the thing was done
suddenly.

<span id="an_30:1">30:1</span> And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and
Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should
come to the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, to hold the passover to
Jehovah the God of Israel.

<span id="an_30:2">30:2</span> And the king took counsel, and his
princes, and the whole congregation in Jerusalem, to hold the passover
in the second month.

<span id="an_30:3">30:3</span> For they could not keep it at that time,
because the priests had not hallowed themselves in sufficient number,
neither had the people been gathered together to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_30:4">30:4</span> And the thing pleased the king and the
whole congregation.

<span id="an_30:5">30:5</span> So they established a decree to make
proclamation throughout Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they
should come to hold the passover to Jehovah the God of Israel, at
Jerusalem; because they had not held it for a long time as it was
written.

<span id="an_30:6">30:6</span> And the couriers went with the letters
from the king and his princes throughout Israel and Judah, and according
to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, return to
Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the
remnant of you that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.

<span id="an_30:7">30:7</span> And be not like your fathers and like
your brethren, who transgressed against Jehovah the God of their
fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as ye see.

<span id="an_30:8">30:8</span> Now, harden not your necks, as your
fathers; yield yourselves to Jehovah, and come to his sanctuary, which
he has sanctified for ever; and serve Jehovah your God, that the
fierceness of his anger may turn away from you.

<span id="an_30:9">30:9</span> For if ye return to Jehovah, your
brethren and your children shall find compassion with those that have
carried them captive, so that they shall come again unto this land; for
Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his
face from you, if ye return to him.

<span id="an_30:10">30:10</span> And the couriers passed from city to
city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun; but
they laughed them to scorn and mocked them.

<span id="an_30:11">30:11</span> Nevertheless certain of Asher and
Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_30:12">30:12</span> The hand of God was also upon Judah to
give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the
princes, by the word of Jehovah.

<span id="an_30:13">30:13</span> And there assembled at Jerusalem much
people to hold the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very
great congregation.

<span id="an_30:14">30:14</span> And they rose up and took away the
altars that were in Jerusalem; and they took away all the
incense-altars, and cast them into the torrent Kidron.

<span id="an_30:15">30:15</span> And they slaughtered the passover on
the fourteenth of the second month; and the priests and the Levites were
ashamed, and hallowed themselves; and they brought the burnt-offerings
into the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_30:16">30:16</span> And they stood in their place after
their custom, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests
sprinkled the blood \[receiving it\] from the hand of the Levites.

<span id="an_30:17">30:17</span> For there were many in the congregation
that were not hallowed; therefore the Levites had the charge of the
slaughtering of the passover-lambs for every one not clean, to hallow
them unto Jehovah.

<span id="an_30:18">30:18</span> For a multitude of the people, many of
Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves,
and they ate the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah
prayed for them saying, Jehovah, who is good, forgive every one

<span id="an_30:19">30:19</span> that has directed his heart to seek
God, Jehovah the God of his fathers, although not according to the
purification of the sanctuary.

<span id="an_30:20">30:20</span> And Jehovah hearkened to Hezekiah, and
healed the people.

<span id="an_30:21">30:21</span> And the children of Israel, that were
present at Jerusalem, held the feast of unleavened bread seven days with
great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Jehovah day by
day, with the instruments of praise to Jehovah.

<span id="an_30:22">30:22</span> And Hezekiah spoke consolingly to all
the Levites that had understanding in the good knowledge of Jehovah; and
they ate the feast-offerings the seven days, sacrificing
peace-offerings, and extolling Jehovah the God of their fathers.

<span id="an_30:23">30:23</span> And the whole congregation took counsel
to observe other seven days; and they observed the seven days with
gladness.

<span id="an_30:24">30:24</span> For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the
congregation as heave-offering: a thousand bullocks and seven thousand
sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and
ten thousand sheep; and a great number of priests hallowed themselves.

<span id="an_30:25">30:25</span> And the whole congregation of Judah,
with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out
of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and
that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.

<span id="an_30:26">30:26</span> And there was great joy in Jerusalem;
for since the time of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, there
had not been the like in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_30:27">30:27</span> And the priests the Levites arose and
blessed the people; and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up
to his holy habitation, to the heavens.

<span id="an_31:1">31:1</span> And when all this was finished, all
Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke the
columns, and hewed down the Asherahs, and demolished the high places and
the altars in all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh,
until they had destroyed them all. And all the children of Israel
returned every man to his possession, into their cities.

<span id="an_31:2">31:2</span> And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of
the priests, and the Levites after their divisions, every man according
to his service, as well the priests as the Levites, for burnt-offerings
and for peace-offerings, to serve and to give thanks and to praise in
the gates of the courts of Jehovah.

<span id="an_31:3">31:3</span> And \[he ordered\] that the king's
portion \[should be taken\] from his substance for the burnt-offerings:
for the morning and evening burnt-offerings, for the burnt-offerings of
the sabbaths, and of the new moons, and of the set feasts, as it is
written in the law of Jehovah.

<span id="an_31:4">31:4</span> And he commanded the people that dwelt in
Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they
might be encouraged in the law of Jehovah.

<span id="an_31:5">31:5</span> And as soon as the commandment was
published, the children of Israel gave in abundance the firstfruits of
corn, new wine and oil and honey, and of all the increase of the field;
and they brought in abundantly the tithe of all \[things\].

<span id="an_31:6">31:6</span> And the children of Israel and of Judah,
that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought the tithe of oxen
and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated to
Jehovah their God, and laid them by heaps.

<span id="an_31:7">31:7</span> In the third month they began to lay the
heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.

<span id="an_31:8">31:8</span> And Hezekiah and the princes came and saw
the heaps, and they blessed Jehovah, and his people Israel.

<span id="an_31:9">31:9</span> And Hezekiah questioned the priests and
the Levites concerning the heaps.

<span id="an_31:10">31:10</span> And Azariah the chief priest of the
house of Zadok spoke to him and said, Since they began to bring the
heave-offerings into the house of Jehovah, we have eaten and been
satisfied and have left plenty; for Jehovah has blessed his people; and
what is left is this great store.

<span id="an_31:11">31:11</span> And Hezekiah commanded to prepare
chambers in the house of Jehovah; and they prepared \[them\],

<span id="an_31:12">31:12</span> and brought in the heave-offerings and
the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully; and over these Cononiah
the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was second.

<span id="an_31:13">31:13</span> And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath,
and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Jismachiah, and
Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei
his brother, at the command of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler
of the house of God.

<span id="an_31:14">31:14</span> And Kore the son of Jimnah the Levite,
the doorkeeper toward the east, was over the voluntary-offerings of God,
to distribute the heave-offerings of Jehovah, and the most holy things.

<span id="an_31:15">31:15</span> And under him were Eden and Miniamin
and Jeshua and Shemaiah, Amariah and Shecaniah, in the cities of the
priests, in \[their\] set trust, to make distributions to their brethren
by \[their\] divisions, to the great as to the small,

<span id="an_31:16">31:16</span> besides those from three years old and
upward who as males were entered in the genealogical register, -- all
that came into the house of Jehovah, as the duty of every day required,
for their service in their charges, according to their divisions,

<span id="an_31:17">31:17</span> -- both to the priests enregistered
according to their fathers' houses, and to the Levites from twenty years
old and upward, in their charges, by their divisions;

<span id="an_31:18">31:18</span> and to all their little ones, their
wives, and their sons, and their daughters, the whole congregation of
those entered in the register; for in their trust they hallowed
themselves to be holy.

<span id="an_31:19">31:19</span> And for the sons of Aaron the priests
who were in the country, in the suburbs of their cities, there were, in
every several city, men expressed by name, to give portions to all the
males among the priests, and to all the Levites that were entered in the
register.

<span id="an_31:20">31:20</span> And thus did Hezekiah throughout Judah,
and wrought what was good and right and true before Jehovah his God.

<span id="an_31:21">31:21</span> And in every work that he undertook in
the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the
commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart and
prospered.

<span id="an_32:1">32:1</span> After these things and this faithfulness,
Sennacherib king of Assyria came and entered into Judah, and encamped
against the fortified cities, and thought to break into them.

<span id="an_32:2">32:2</span> And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib
was come, and that he was minded to fight against Jerusalem,

<span id="an_32:3">32:3</span> he took counsel with his princes and his
mighty men to stop the fountains of waters that were outside the city;
and they helped him.

<span id="an_32:4">32:4</span> And there was gathered together much
people, and they stopped all the fountains, and the torrent that flows
through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria
come and find much water?

<span id="an_32:5">32:5</span> And he strengthened himself, and built up
all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, and
\[built\] another wall outside, and fortified the Millo of the city of
David, and made darts and shields in abundance.

<span id="an_32:6">32:6</span> And he set captains of war over the
people, and assembled them to him on the open place at the gate of the
city, and spoke consolingly to them saying,

<span id="an_32:7">32:7</span> Be strong and courageous, be not afraid
nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is
with him; for there are more with us than with him:

<span id="an_32:8">32:8</span> with him is an arm of flesh, but with us
is Jehovah our God to help us and to fight our battles. And the people
depended upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.

<span id="an_32:9">32:9</span> After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria
sent his servants to Jerusalem (but he himself was before Lachish, and
all his power with him), unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah
that were at Jerusalem, saying,

<span id="an_32:10">32:10</span> Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria:
On what do ye rely that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?

<span id="an_32:11">32:11</span> Does not Hezekiah persuade you, to give
yourselves over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God
will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

<span id="an_32:12">32:12</span> Has not the same Hezekiah removed his
high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem saying, Ye
shall worship before \*one\* altar, and burn incense upon it?

<span id="an_32:13">32:13</span> Do ye not know what I and my fathers
have done to all the peoples of the countries? Were the gods of the
nations of the countries in any wise able to deliver their country out
of my hand?

<span id="an_32:14">32:14</span> Who is there among all the gods of
those nations that my fathers have utterly destroyed, that was able to
deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to
deliver you out of my hand?

<span id="an_32:15">32:15</span> And now, let not Hezekiah deceive you,
nor persuade you in this manner, neither yet believe him; for no +god of
any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, nor
out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you
out of my hand?

<span id="an_32:16">32:16</span> And his servants spoke yet more against
Jehovah, the \[true\] God, and against his servant Hezekiah.

<span id="an_32:17">32:17</span> And he wrote a letter to rail at
Jehovah the God of Israel, and to speak against him saying, As the gods
of the nations of the countries have not delivered their people out of
my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of my
hand.

<span id="an_32:18">32:18</span> And they cried with a loud voice in the
Jewish \[language\] to the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to
frighten them and to trouble them; that they might take the city.

<span id="an_32:19">32:19</span> And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem
as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, the work of man's hand.

<span id="an_32:20">32:20</span> And because of this, king Hezekiah and
the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz prayed and cried to heaven.

<span id="an_32:21">32:21</span> And Jehovah sent an angel, who cut off
all the mighty men of valour, and the princes and the captains in the
camp of the king of Assyria. And he returned with shame of face to his
own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came
forth of his own bowels made him fall there with the sword.

<span id="an_32:22">32:22</span> And Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of
Assyria, and from the hand of all, and protected them on every side.

<span id="an_32:23">32:23</span> And many brought gifts unto Jehovah to
Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; and he was
thenceforth magnified in the sight of all the nations.

<span id="an_32:24">32:24</span> In those days Hezekiah was sick unto
death, and he prayed to Jehovah; and he spoke to him and gave him a
sign.

<span id="an_32:25">32:25</span> But Hezekiah rendered not again
according to the benefit \[done\] to him, for his heart was lifted up;
and there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.

<span id="an_32:26">32:26</span> And Hezekiah humbled himself for the
pride of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the
wrath of Jehovah came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.

<span id="an_32:27">32:27</span> And Hezekiah had very much riches and
honour; and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for
precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of
pleasant vessels;

<span id="an_32:28">32:28</span> storehouses also for the increase of
corn and new wine and oil, and stalls for all manner of beasts, and \[he
procured\] flocks for the stalls.

<span id="an_32:29">32:29</span> And he provided for himself cities, and
possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God gave him very much
substance.

<span id="an_32:30">32:30</span> And he, Hezekiah, stopped the upper
outlet of the waters of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west
side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.

<span id="an_32:31">32:31</span> However in \[the matter of\] the
ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the
wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he
might know all \[that was\] in his heart.

<span id="an_32:32">32:32</span> And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah
and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of the
prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz in the book of the kings of Judah and
Israel.

<span id="an_32:33">32:33</span> And Hezekiah slept with his fathers,
and they buried him in the highest place of the sepulchres of the sons
of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour
at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_33:1">33:1</span> Manasseh was twelve years old when he
began to reign; and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_33:2">33:2</span> And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah,
like the abominations of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed from
before the children of Israel.

<span id="an_33:3">33:3</span> And he built again the high places that
Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars to the
Baals, and made Asherahs, and worshipped all the host of heaven and
served them.

<span id="an_33:4">33:4</span> And he built altars in the house of
Jehovah, of which Jehovah had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for
ever.

<span id="an_33:5">33:5</span> And he built altars to all the host of
heaven in both courts of the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_33:6">33:6</span> He also caused his children to pass
through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he used magic
and divination and sorcery, and appointed necromancers and soothsayers:
he wrought evil beyond measure in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him
to anger.

<span id="an_33:7">33:7</span> And he set the graven image of the idol
that he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David
and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have
chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever;

<span id="an_33:8">33:8</span> neither will I any more remove the foot
of Israel from out of the land that I have appointed to your fathers; if
they will only take heed to do all that I commanded them through Moses,
according to all the law and the statutes and the ordinances.

<span id="an_33:9">33:9</span> And Manasseh led Judah and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem astray, to do more evil than the nations that
Jehovah had destroyed from before the children of Israel.

<span id="an_33:10">33:10</span> And Jehovah spoke to Manasseh and to
his people; but they did not hearken.

<span id="an_33:11">33:11</span> And Jehovah brought upon them the
captains of the host of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh with
fetters, and bound him with chains of brass, and carried him to Babylon.

<span id="an_33:12">33:12</span> And when he was in affliction, he
besought Jehovah his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of
his fathers,

<span id="an_33:13">33:13</span> and prayed to him. And he was intreated
of him and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem
into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah, he was God.

<span id="an_33:14">33:14</span> And after this he built the outer wall
of the city of David, on the west, toward Gihon, in the valley, even to
the entrance of the fish-gate, and carried it round Ophel, and raised it
up a very great height; and he put captains of war in all the fortified
cities of Judah.

<span id="an_33:15">33:15</span> And he removed the strange gods, and
the idol out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he had
built on the mount of the house of Jehovah and in Jerusalem, and cast
\[them\] out of the city.

<span id="an_33:16">33:16</span> And he reinstated the altar of Jehovah,
and sacrificed on it peace-offerings and thank-offerings, and commanded
Judah to serve Jehovah the God of Israel.

<span id="an_33:17">33:17</span> Nevertheless, the people sacrificed
still on the high places, although to Jehovah their God only.

<span id="an_33:18">33:18</span> And the rest of the acts of Manasseh,
and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him
in the name of Jehovah the God of Israel, behold, they \[are written\]
in the acts of the kings of Israel.

<span id="an_33:19">33:19</span> And his prayer, and \[how God\] was
intreated of him, and all his sin and his unfaithfulness, and the places
in which he built high places, and set up Asherahs and graven images,
before he was humbled, behold, they are written among the words of
Hozai.

<span id="an_33:20">33:20</span> And Manasseh slept with his fathers,
and they buried him in his own house; and Amon his son reigned in his
stead.

<span id="an_33:21">33:21</span> Amon was twenty-two years old when he
began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_33:22">33:22</span> And he did evil in the sight of
Jehovah, as Manasseh his father had done; and Amon sacrificed to all the
graven images that Manasseh his father had made, and served them.

<span id="an_33:23">33:23</span> And he did not humble himself before
Jehovah, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; for he, Amon,
multiplied trespass.

<span id="an_33:24">33:24</span> And his servants conspired against him,
and slew him in his own house.

<span id="an_33:25">33:25</span> But the people of the land smote all
them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land
made Josiah his son king in his stead.

<span id="an_34:1">34:1</span> Josiah was eight years old when he began
to reign; and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_34:2">34:2</span> And he did what was right in the sight of
Jehovah, and walked in the ways of David his father, and turned not
aside to the right hand nor to the left.

<span id="an_34:3">34:3</span> And in the eighth year of his reign,
while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his
father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem
from the high places, and the Asherahs, and the graven images, and the
molten images.

<span id="an_34:4">34:4</span> And they broke down the altars of the
Baals in his presence; and the sun-pillars that were on high above them
he cut down; and the Asherahs and the graven images and the molten
images he broke in pieces, and made dust \[of them\] and strewed it upon
the graves of those that had sacrificed to them;

<span id="an_34:5">34:5</span> and he burned the bones of the priests
upon their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.

<span id="an_34:6">34:6</span> And \[so did he\] in the cities of
Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even to Naphtali, in their ruins round
about;

<span id="an_34:7">34:7</span> and he broke down the altars, and beat
the Asherahs and the graven images into powder, and cut down all the
sun-pillars throughout the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_34:8">34:8</span> And in the eighteenth year of his reign,
when he purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of
Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of
Joahaz the chronicler, to repair the house of Jehovah his God.

<span id="an_34:9">34:9</span> And they came to Hilkijah the high
priest, and they delivered \[to them\] the money that had been brought
into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had
gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of
Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_34:10">34:10</span> And they gave \[it\] into the hand of
them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of Jehovah;
and they gave it to the workmen who wrought in the house of Jehovah to
reinstate and repair the house:

<span id="an_34:11">34:11</span> they gave \[it\] to the carpenters and
the builders, to buy hewn stone, and timber for the joists, and to floor
the houses that the kings of Judah had destroyed.

<span id="an_34:12">34:12</span> And the men did the work faithfully.
And over them were appointed Jahath and Obadiah, Levites, of the
children of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the children of the
Kohathites, for the oversight; and all these Levites were skilled in
instruments of music.

<span id="an_34:13">34:13</span> They were also over the bearers of
burdens, and were overseers of all that worked in any manner of service.
And of the Levites were the scribes, and officers, and doorkeepers.

<span id="an_34:14">34:14</span> And when they brought out the money
that had been brought into the house of Jehovah, Hilkijah the priest
found the book of the law of Jehovah by Moses.

<span id="an_34:15">34:15</span> Then Hilkijah spoke and said to Shaphan
the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah.
And Hilkijah gave the book to Shaphan.

<span id="an_34:16">34:16</span> And Shaphan carried the book to the
king. And moreover he brought the king word again saying, All that was
committed to the hand of thy servants, they do;

<span id="an_34:17">34:17</span> and they have emptied out the money
that was found in the house of Jehovah, and have delivered it into the
hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.

<span id="an_34:18">34:18</span> And Shaphan the scribe informed the
king saying, Hilkijah the priest has given me a book. And Shaphan read
out of it before the king.

<span id="an_34:19">34:19</span> And it came to pass when the king heard
the words of the law, that he rent his garments.

<span id="an_34:20">34:20</span> And the king commanded Hilkijah, and
Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the
scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying,

<span id="an_34:21">34:21</span> Go, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for
them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the
book which is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is poured
out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Jehovah, to
do according to all that is written in this book.

<span id="an_34:22">34:22</span> And Hilkijah and they that the king
\[had appointed\] went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the
son of Tokehath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe: now she dwelt in
Jerusalem in the second quarter \[of the town\]; and they spoke with her
to that effect.

<span id="an_34:23">34:23</span> And she said to them, Thus saith
Jehovah the God of Israel: Tell the man that sent you to me,

<span id="an_34:24">34:24</span> Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will
bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, all the
curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king
of Judah.

<span id="an_34:25">34:25</span> Because they have forsaken me, and have
burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with
all the works of their hands; therefore my fury shall be poured out upon
this place, and shall not be quenched.

<span id="an_34:26">34:26</span> But to the king of Judah, who sent you
to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him: Thus saith Jehovah the
God of Israel touching the words which thou hast heard:

<span id="an_34:27">34:27</span> Because thy heart was tender, and thou
didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against
this place and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself
before me, and didst rend thy garments and weep before me, I also have
heard \[thee\], saith Jehovah.

<span id="an_34:28">34:28</span> Behold, I will gather thee unto thy
fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace; and thine
eyes shall not see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and
upon the inhabitants thereof. And they brought the king word again.

<span id="an_34:29">34:29</span> And the king sent and gathered all the
elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_34:30">34:30</span> And the king went up into the house of
Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and
the priests and the Levites, and all the people, great and small; and he
read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which had
been found in the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_34:31">34:31</span> And the king stood in his place, and
made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his
commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and
with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that are written
in this book.

<span id="an_34:32">34:32</span> And he caused all that were present in
Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand \[to it\]. And the inhabitants of
Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their
fathers.

<span id="an_34:33">34:33</span> And Josiah removed all the abominations
out of all the countries that belonged to the children of Israel, and
made to serve all that were found in Israel, -- to serve Jehovah their
God: all his days they did not depart from following Jehovah, the God of
their fathers.

<span id="an_35:1">35:1</span> And Josiah held a passover to Jehovah in
Jerusalem; and they slaughtered the passover on the fourteenth of the
first month.

<span id="an_35:2">35:2</span> And he set the priests in their charges,
and encouraged them to the service of the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_35:3">35:3</span> And he said to the Levites, that taught
all Israel, \[and\] who were holy to Jehovah, Put the holy ark in the
house that Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, built; ye have not
to carry it upon your shoulders. Serve now Jehovah your God, and his
people Israel;

<span id="an_35:4">35:4</span> and prepare yourselves by your fathers'
houses, in your divisions, according to the writing of David king of
Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son;

<span id="an_35:5">35:5</span> and stand in the sanctuary for the
classes of the fathers' houses, for your brethren, the children of the
people, and \[according\] to the divisions of the fathers' houses of the
Levites;

<span id="an_35:6">35:6</span> and slaughter the passover, and hallow
yourselves, and prepare it for your brethren, that they may do according
to the word of Jehovah through Moses.

<span id="an_35:7">35:7</span> And Josiah gave for the children of the
people a heave-offering of the flocks, lambs and goats, all for the
passover-offerings, for all that were present -- to the number of thirty
thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's
substance.

<span id="an_35:8">35:8</span> And his princes gave a voluntary
heave-offering for the people, for the priests, and for the Levites:
Hilkijah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave to
the priests for the passover-offerings two thousand six hundred \[small
cattle\] and three hundred oxen;

<span id="an_35:9">35:9</span> and Conaniah, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel,
his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites,
gave as heave-offering to the Levites for the passover-offerings five
thousand \[small cattle\] and five hundred oxen.

<span id="an_35:10">35:10</span> And the service was prepared, and the
priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their divisions,
according to the king's commandment.

<span id="an_35:11">35:11</span> And they slaughtered the passover, and
the priests sprinkled \[the blood\] from their hand, and the Levites
flayed them.

<span id="an_35:12">35:12</span> And they set apart the burnt-offerings
to give them to the classes of the fathers' houses of the children of
the people, to present them to Jehovah, as it is written in the book of
Moses. And so \[did they\] with the oxen.

<span id="an_35:13">35:13</span> And they roasted the passover with fire
according to the ordinance; and the consecrated things they boiled in
pots and in cauldrons and in pans, and divided them speedily among all
the children of the people.

<span id="an_35:14">35:14</span> And afterwards they made ready for
themselves and for the priests; because the priests, the sons of Aaron,
\[were engaged\] in offering up the burnt-offerings and the fat until
night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the
priests, the sons of Aaron.

<span id="an_35:15">35:15</span> And the singers, the sons of Asaph,
were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph,
and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the doorkeepers were at
every gate; they had not to depart from their service, for their
brethren the Levites prepared for them.

<span id="an_35:16">35:16</span> And all the service of Jehovah was
prepared the same day, to hold the passover, and to offer
burnt-offerings on the altar of Jehovah according to the commandment of
king Josiah.

<span id="an_35:17">35:17</span> And the children of Israel that were
present held the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened
bread seven days.

<span id="an_35:18">35:18</span> And there was no passover like to that
holden in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all
the kings of Israel hold such a passover as Josiah held, and the
priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present,
and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_35:19">35:19</span> In the eighteenth year of the reign of
Josiah was this passover holden.

<span id="an_35:20">35:20</span> After all this, when Josiah had
arranged the house, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against
Karkemish at the Euphrates; and Josiah went out against him.

<span id="an_35:21">35:21</span> And he sent messengers to him, saying,
What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee
this day, but against the house with which I have war; and God has told
me to make haste: keep aloof from God who is with me, that he destroy
thee not.

<span id="an_35:22">35:22</span> But Josiah would not turn his face from
him, but disguised himself, that he might fight against him; and he
hearkened not to the words of Necho from the mouth of God; and he came
to fight in the valley of Megiddo.

<span id="an_35:23">35:23</span> And the archers shot at king Josiah;
and the king said to his servants, Have me away, for I am sore wounded.

<span id="an_35:24">35:24</span> And his servants took him out from the
chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him
to Jerusalem. And he died, and was buried in the sepulchres of his
fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.

<span id="an_35:25">35:25</span> And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah; and
all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their
lamentations to this day; and they made them an ordinance for Israel.
And behold, they are written in the lamentations.

<span id="an_35:26">35:26</span> And the rest of the acts of Josiah, and
his good deeds, according to that which is written in the law of
Jehovah,

<span id="an_35:27">35:27</span> and his acts, first and last, behold,
they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

<span id="an_36:1">36:1</span> And the people of the land took Jehoahaz
the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead, in
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_36:2">36:2</span> Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when
he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_36:3">36:3</span> And the king of Egypt put him down at
Jerusalem, and imposed a fine upon the land of a hundred talents of
silver and a talent of gold.

<span id="an_36:4">36:4</span> And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his
brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to
Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to
Egypt.

<span id="an_36:5">36:5</span> Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when
he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and he did
evil in the sight of Jehovah his God.

<span id="an_36:6">36:6</span> Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king
of Babylon, and bound him with chains of brass to carry him to Babylon.

<span id="an_36:7">36:7</span> And Nebuchadnezzar carried \[part\] of
the vessels of the house of Jehovah to Babylon, and put them in his
temple at Babylon.

<span id="an_36:8">36:8</span> And the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim,
and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him,
behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_36:9">36:9</span> Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he
began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem;
and he did evil in the sight of Jehovah.

<span id="an_36:10">36:10</span> And at the turn of the year king
Nebuchadnezzar sent and had him brought to Babylon, with the precious
vessels of the house of Jehovah; and he made Zedekiah his brother king
over Judah and Jerusalem.

<span id="an_36:11">36:11</span> Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when
he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_36:12">36:12</span> And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah
his God; he humbled not himself before the prophet Jeremiah speaking
from the mouth of Jehovah.

<span id="an_36:13">36:13</span> And he also rebelled against king
Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him take oath by God; and he stiffened his
neck, and hardened his heart from returning to Jehovah the God of
Israel.

<span id="an_36:14">36:14</span> All the chiefs of the priests also, and
the people, increased their transgressions, according to all the
abominations of the nations; and they defiled the house of Jehovah which
he had hallowed in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_36:15">36:15</span> And Jehovah the God of their fathers
sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending; because he
had compassion on his people and on his dwelling-place.

<span id="an_36:16">36:16</span> But they mocked at the messengers of
God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the fury
of Jehovah rose against his people, and there was no remedy.

<span id="an_36:17">36:17</span> And he brought up \[against\] them the
king of the Chaldees, and slew their young men with the sword in the
house of their sanctuary, and spared not young man nor maiden, old man
nor him of hoary head: he gave \[them\] all into his hand.

<span id="an_36:18">36:18</span> And all the vessels of the house of
God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the
treasures of the king and of his princes, he brought all to Babylon.

<span id="an_36:19">36:19</span> And they burned the house of God, and
broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burned all the palaces thereof
with fire, and all the precious vessels thereof were given up to
destruction.

<span id="an_36:20">36:20</span> And them that had escaped from the
sword he carried away to Babylon; and they became servants to him and
his sons, until the reign of the kingdom of Persia;

<span id="an_36:21">36:21</span> to fulfil the word of Jehovah by the
mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths. All the days
of its desolation it kept sabbath, to fulfil seventy years.

<span id="an_36:22">36:22</span> And in the first year of Cyrus king of
Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be
accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and
he made a proclamation throughout his kingdom, and also in writing,
saying,

<span id="an_36:23">36:23</span> Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: All the
kingdoms of the earth has Jehovah the God of the heavens given to me,
and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in
Judah. Whosoever there is among you of all his people, Jehovah his God
be with him, and let him go up.
