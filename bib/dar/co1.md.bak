### Darby Bible: 1 Corinthians

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, \[a\] called apostle of Jesus Christ,
by God's will, and Sosthenes the brother,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> to the assembly of God which is in Corinth,
to \[those\] sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in
every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and
ours:

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Grace to you and peace from God our Father,
and \[the\] Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I thank my God always about you, in respect
of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus;

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> that in everything ye have been enriched in
him, in all word \[of doctrine\], and all knowledge,

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> (according as the testimony of the Christ
has been confirmed in you,)

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> so that ye come short in no gift, awaiting
the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> who shall also confirm you to \[the\] end,
unimpeachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> God \[is\] faithful, by whom ye have been
called into \[the\] fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all say the same thing, and that there
be not among you divisions; but that ye be perfectly united in the same
mind and in the same opinion.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> For it has been shewn to me concerning
you, my brethren, by those of \[the house of\] Chloe, that there are
strifes among you.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> But I speak of this, that each of you
says, \*I\* am of Paul, and \*I\* of Apollos, and \*I\* of Cephas, and
\*I\* of Christ.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Is the Christ divided? has Paul been
crucified for you? or have ye been baptised unto the name of Paul?

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> I thank God that I have baptised none of
you, unless Crispus and Gaius,

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> that no one may say that I have baptised
unto my own name.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> Yes, I baptised also the house of
Stephanas; for the rest I know not if I have baptised any other.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> For Christ has not sent me to baptise,
but to preach glad tidings; not in wisdom of word, that the cross of the
Christ may not be made vain.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> For the word of the cross is to them that
perish foolishness, but to us that are saved it is God's power.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> For it is written, I will destroy the
wisdom of the wise, and set aside the understanding of the understanding
ones.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Where \[is the\] wise? where scribe?
where disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of the
world?

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> For since, in the wisdom of God, the
world by wisdom has not known God, God has been pleased by the
foolishness of the preaching to save those that believe.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> Since Jews indeed ask for signs, and
Greeks seek wisdom;

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> but \*we\* preach Christ crucified, to
Jews an offence, and to nations foolishness;

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> but to those that \[are\] called, both
Jews and Greeks, Christ God's power and God's wisdom.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> Because the foolishness of God is wiser
than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> For consider your calling, brethren, that
\[there are\] not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not
many high-born.

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> But God has chosen the foolish things of
the world, that he may put to shame the wise; and God has chosen the
weak things of the world, that he may put to shame the strong things;

<span id="an_1:28">1:28</span> and the ignoble things of the world, and
the despised, has God chosen, \[and\] things that are not, that he may
annul the things that are;

<span id="an_1:29">1:29</span> so that no flesh should boast before God.

<span id="an_1:30">1:30</span> But of him are \*ye\* in Christ Jesus,
who has been made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and
holiness, and redemption;

<span id="an_1:31">1:31</span> that according as it is written, He that
boasts, let him boast in \[the\] Lord.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> And \*I\*, when I came to you, brethren,
came not in excellency of word, or wisdom, announcing to you the
testimony of God.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> For I did not judge \[it well\] to know
anything among you save Jesus Christ, and \*him\* crucified.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And \*I\* was with you in weakness and in
fear and in much trembling;

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> and my word and my preaching, not in
persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of \[the\] Spirit and
of power;

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> that your faith might not stand in men's
wisdom, but in God's power.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> But we speak wisdom among the perfect; but
wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who come to
nought.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> But we speak God's wisdom in \[a\] mystery,
that hidden \[wisdom\] which God had predetermined before the ages for
our glory:

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> which none of the princes of this age knew,
(for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;)

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> but according as it is written, Things
which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into
man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him,

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> but God has revealed to us by \[his\]
Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> For who of men hath known the things of a
man except the spirit of the man which is in him? thus also the things
of God knows no one except the Spirit of God.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> But \*we\* have received, not the spirit
of the world, but the Spirit which \[is\] of God, that we may know the
things which have been freely given to us of God:

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> which also we speak, not in words taught
by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, communicating
spiritual \[things\] by spiritual \[means\].

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> But \[the\] natural man does not receive
the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him; and he
cannot know \[them\] because they are spiritually discerned;

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> but the spiritual discerns all things,
and \*he\* is discerned of no one.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> For who has known the mind of \[the\]
Lord, who shall instruct him? But \*we\* have the mind of Christ.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> And \*I\*, brethren, have not been able to
speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly; as to babes in Christ.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> I have given you milk to drink, not meat,
for ye have not yet been able, nor indeed are ye yet able;

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> for ye are yet carnal. For whereas \[there
are\] among you emulation and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk
according to man?

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> For when one says, \*I\* am of Paul, and
another, \*I\* of Apollos, are ye not men?

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Who then is Apollos, and who Paul?
Ministering servants, through whom ye have believed, and as the Lord has
given to each.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> \*I\* have planted; Apollos watered; but
God has given the increase.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> So that neither the planter is anything,
nor the waterer; but God the giver of the increase.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> But the planter and the waterer are one;
but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> For we are God's fellow-workmen; ye are
God's husbandry, God's building.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> According to the grace of God which has
been given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation, but
another builds upon it. But let each see how he builds upon it.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> For other foundation can no man lay
besides that which \[is\] laid, which is Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Now if any one build upon \[this\]
foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, straw,

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> the work of each shall be made manifest;
for the day shall declare \[it\], because it is revealed in fire; and
the fire shall try the work of each what it is.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> If the work of any one which he has built
upon \[the foundation\] shall abide, he shall receive a reward.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> If the work of any one shall be consumed,
he shall suffer loss, but \*he\* shall be saved, but so as through
\[the\] fire.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> Do ye not know that ye are \[the\] temple
of God, and \[that\] the Spirit of God dwells in you?

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> If any one corrupt the temple of God,
\*him\* shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are
\*ye\*.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> Let no one deceive himself: if any one
thinks himself to be wise among you in this world, let him become
foolish, that he may be wise.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> For the wisdom of this world is
foolishness with God; for it is written, He who takes the wise in their
craftiness.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> And again, \[The\] Lord knows the
reasonings of the wise that they are vain.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> So that let no one boast in men; for all
things are yours.

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or
\[the\] world, or life, or death, or things present, or things coming,
all are yours;

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> and \*ye\* \[are\] Christ's, and Christ
\[is\] God's.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Let a man so account of us as servants of
Christ, and stewards of \[the\] mysteries of God.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Here, further, it is sought in stewards,
that a man be found faithful.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> But for me it is the very smallest matter
that I be examined of you or of man's day. Nor do I even examine myself.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> For I am conscious of nothing in myself;
but I am not justified by this: but he that examines me is the Lord.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> So that do not judge anything before
\[the\] time, until the Lord shall come, who shall also both bring to
light the hidden things of darkness, and shall make manifest the
counsels of hearts; and then shall each have \[his\] praise from God.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> Now these things, brethren, I have
transferred, in their application, to myself and Apollos, for your
sakes, that ye may learn in us the \[lesson of\] not \[letting your
thoughts go\] above what is written, that ye may not be puffed up one
for \[such a\] one against another.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> For who makes thee to differ? and what hast
thou which thou hast not received? but if also thou hast received, why
boastest thou as not receiving?

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Already ye are filled; already ye have been
enriched; ye have reigned without us; and I would that ye reigned, that
\*we\* also might reign with you.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> For I think that God has set us the
apostles for the last, as appointed to death. For we have become a
spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> \*We\* \[are\] fools for Christ's sake,
but \*ye\* prudent in Christ: \*we\* weak, but \*ye\* strong: \*ye\*
glorious, but \*we\* in dishonour.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> To the present hour we both hunger and
thirst, and are in nakedness, and buffeted, and wander without a home,

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> and labour, working with our own hands.
Railed at, we bless; persecuted, we suffer \[it\];

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> insulted, we entreat: we are become as
\[the\] offscouring of the world, \[the\] refuse of all, until now.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> Not \[as\] chiding do I write these
things to you, but as my beloved children I admonish \[you\].

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> For if ye should have ten thousand
instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus \*I\*
have begotten you through the glad tidings.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> I entreat you therefore, be my imitators.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> For this reason I have sent to you
Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in \[the\] Lord, who
shall put you in mind of my ways \[as\] they \[are\] in Christ,
according as I teach everywhere in every assembly.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> But some have been puffed up, as if I
were not coming to you;

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> but I will come quickly to you, if the
Lord will; and I will know, not the word of those that are puffed up,
but the power.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> For the kingdom of God \[is\] not in
word, but in power.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> What will ye? that I come to you with a
rod; or in love, and \[in\] a spirit of meekness?

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> It is universally reported \[that there
is\] fornication among you, and such fornication as \[is\] not even
among the nations, so that one should have his father's wife.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> And \*ye\* are puffed up, and ye have not
rather mourned, in order that he that has done this deed might be taken
away out of the midst of you.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> For \*I\*, \[as\] absent in body but
present in spirit, have already judged as present,

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> \[to deliver,\] in the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ (ye and my spirit being gathered together, with the power
of our Lord Jesus Christ), him that has so wrought this:

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> to deliver him, \[I say,\] \[being\] such,
to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in
the day of the Lord Jesus.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Your boasting \[is\] not good. Do ye not
know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a
new lump, according as ye are unleavened. For also our passover, Christ,
has been sacrificed;

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> so that let us celebrate the feast, not
with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and wickedness, but with
unleavened \[bread\] of sincerity and truth.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> I have written to you in the epistle not to
mix with fornicators;

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> not altogether with the fornicators of
this world, or with the avaricious and rapacious, or idolaters, since
\[then\] ye should go out of the world.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> But now I have written to you, if any one
called brother be fornicator, or avaricious, or idolater, or abusive, or
a drunkard, or rapacious, not to mix with \[him\]; with such a one not
even to eat.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> For what have \*I\* \[to do\] with
judging those outside also? \*ye\*, do not ye judge them that are
within?

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> But those without God judges. Remove the
wicked person from amongst yourselves.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Dare any one of you, having a matter
against another, prosecute his suit before the unjust, and not before
the saints?

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Do ye not then know that the saints shall
judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy of
\[the\] smallest judgments?

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> Do ye not know that we shall judge angels?
and not then matters of this life?

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> If then ye have judgments as to things of
this life, set those \[to judge\] who are little esteemed in the
assembly.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> I speak to you \[to put you\] to shame.
Thus there is not a wise person among you, not even one, who shall be
able to decide between his brethren!

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> But brother prosecutes his suit with
brother, and that before unbelievers.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> Already indeed then it is altogether a
fault in you that ye have suits between yourselves. Why do ye not rather
suffer wrong? why are ye not rather defrauded?

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> But \*ye\* do wrong, and defraud, and this
\[your\] brethren.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> Do ye not know that unrighteous \[persons\]
shall not inherit \[the\] kingdom of God? Do not err: neither
fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor those who make women of
themselves, nor who abuse themselves with men,

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards,
nor abusive persons, nor \[the\] rapacious, shall inherit \[the\]
kingdom of God.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> And these things were some of you; but ye
have been washed, but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been
justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> All things are lawful to me, but all
things do not profit; all things are lawful to me, but \*I\* will not be
brought under the power of any.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> Meats for the belly, and the belly for
meats; but God will bring to nothing both it and them: but the body
\[is\] not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> And God has both raised up the Lord, and
will raise us up from among \[the dead\] by his power.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> Do ye not know that your bodies are
members of Christ? Shall I then, taking the members of the Christ, make
\[them\] members of a harlot? Far be the thought.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> Do ye not know that he \[that is\] joined
to the harlot is one body? for the two, he says, shall be one flesh.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> But he that \[is\] joined to the Lord is
one Spirit.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> Flee fornication. Every sin which a man
may practise is without the body, but he that commits fornication sins
against his own body.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> Do ye not know that your body is \[the\]
temple of the Holy Spirit which \[is\] in you, which ye have of God; and
ye are not your own?

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> for ye have been bought with a price:
glorify now then God in your body.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> But concerning the things of which ye have
written \[to me\]: \[It is\] good for a man not to touch a woman;

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> but on account of fornications, let each
have his own wife, and each \[woman\] have her own husband.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> Let the husband render her due to the wife,
and in like manner the wife to the husband.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> The wife has not authority over her own
body, but the husband: in like manner also the husband has not authority
over his own body, but the wife.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> Defraud not one another, unless, it may be,
by consent for a time, that ye may devote yourselves to prayer, and
again be together, that Satan tempt you not because of your
incontinency.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> But this I say, as consenting \[to\], not
as commanding \[it\].

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> Now I wish all men to be even as myself:
but every one has his own gift of God: one man thus, and another thus.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> But I say to the unmarried and to the
widows, It is good for them that they remain even as I.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> But if they have not control over
themselves, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> But to the married I enjoin, not \*I\*,
but the Lord, Let not wife be separated from husband;

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> (but if also she shall have been
separated, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband;)
and let not husband leave wife.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> But as to the rest, \*I\* say, not the
Lord, If any brother have an unbelieving wife, and \*she\* consent to
dwell with him, let him not leave her.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> And a woman who has an unbelieving
husband, and he consents to dwell with her, let her not leave \[her\]
husband.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified
in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother;
since \[otherwise\] indeed your children are unclean, but now they are
holy.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> But if the unbeliever go away, let them
go away; a brother or a sister is not bound in such \[cases\], but God
has called us in peace.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> For what knowest thou, O wife, if thou
shalt save thy husband? or what knowest thou, O husband, if thou shalt
save thy wife?

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> However, as the Lord has divided to each,
as God has called each, so let him walk; and thus I ordain in all the
assemblies.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> Has any one been called circumcised? let
him not become uncircumcised: has any one been called in uncircumcision?
let him not be circumcised.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> Circumcision is nothing, and
uncircumcision is nothing; but keeping God's commandments.

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> Let each abide in that calling in which
he has been called.

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> Hast thou been called \[being\] a
bondman, let it not concern thee; but and if thou canst become free, use
\[it\] rather.

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> For the bondman that is called in \[the\]
Lord is the Lord's freedman; in like manner \[also\] the freeman being
called is Christ's bondman.

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> Ye have been bought with a price; do not
be the bondmen of men.

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> Let each, wherein he is called, brethren,
therein abide with God.

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> But concerning virgins, I have no
commandment of \[the\] Lord; but I give my opinion, as having received
mercy of \[the\] Lord to be faithful.

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> I think then that this is good, on
account of the present necessity, that \[it is\] good for a man to
remain so as he is.

<span id="an_7:27">7:27</span> Art thou bound to a wife? seek not to be
loosed; art thou free from a wife? do not seek a wife.

<span id="an_7:28">7:28</span> But if thou shouldest also marry, thou
hast not sinned; and if the virgin marry, they have not sinned: but such
shall have tribulation in the flesh; but I spare you.

<span id="an_7:29">7:29</span> But this I say, brethren, the time is
straitened. For the rest, that they who have wives, be as not having
\[any\]:

<span id="an_7:30">7:30</span> and they that weep, as not weeping; and
they that rejoice, as not rejoicing; and they that buy, as not
possessing;

<span id="an_7:31">7:31</span> and they that use the world, as not
disposing of it as their own; for the fashion of this world passes.

<span id="an_7:32">7:32</span> But I wish you to be without care. The
unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, how he shall please the
Lord;

<span id="an_7:33">7:33</span> but he that has married cares for the
things of the world, how he shall please his wife.

<span id="an_7:34">7:34</span> There is a difference between the wife
and the virgin. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, that she
may be holy both in body and spirit; but she that has married cares for
the things of the world, how she shall please her husband.

<span id="an_7:35">7:35</span> But I say this for your own profit; not
that I may set a snare before you, but for what \[is\] seemly, and
waiting on the Lord without distraction.

<span id="an_7:36">7:36</span> But if any one think that he behaves
unseemly to his virginity, if he be beyond the flower of his age, and so
it must be, let him do what he will, he does not sin: let them marry.

<span id="an_7:37">7:37</span> But he who stands firm in his heart,
having no need, but has authority over his own will, and has judged this
in his heart to keep his own virginity, he does well.

<span id="an_7:38">7:38</span> So that he that marries himself does
well; and he that does not marry does better.

<span id="an_7:39">7:39</span> A wife is bound for whatever time her
husband lives; but if the husband be fallen asleep, she is free to be
married to whom she will, only in \[the\] Lord.

<span id="an_7:40">7:40</span> But she is happier if she so remain,
according to my judgment; but I think that \*I\* also have God's Spirit.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> But concerning things sacrificed to idols,
we know, (for we all have knowledge: knowledge puffs up, but love
edifies.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> If any one think he knows anything, he
knows nothing yet as he ought to know \[it\].

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> But if any one love God, \*he\* is known of
him):

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> -- concerning then the eating of things
sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol \[is\] nothing in \[the\]
world, and that there \[is\] no other God save one.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> For and if indeed there are \[those\]
called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, (as there are gods many, and
lords many,)

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> yet to us \[there is\] one God, the Father,
of whom all things, and \*we\* for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by
whom \[are\] all things, and \*we\* by him.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> But knowledge \[is\] not in all: but some,
with conscience of the idol, until now eat as of a thing sacrificed to
idols; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> But meat does not commend us to God;
neither if we should not eat do we come short; nor if we should eat have
we an advantage.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> But see lest anywise this your right \[to
eat\] itself be a stumbling-block to the weak.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> For if any one see thee, who hast
knowledge, sitting at table in an idol-house, shall not his conscience,
he being weak, be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed to the idol?

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> and the weak \[one\], the brother for
whose sake Christ died, will perish through thy knowledge.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> Now, thus sinning against the brethren,
and wounding their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> Wherefore if meat be a fall-trap to my
brother, I will eat no flesh for ever, that I may not be a fall-trap to
my brother.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> Am I not free? am I not an apostle? have I
not seen Jesus our Lord? are not \*ye\* my work in \[the\] Lord?

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> If I am not an apostle to others, yet at
any rate I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are \*ye\* in
\[the\] Lord.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> My defence to those who examine me is this:

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> Have we not a right to eat and to drink?

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> have we not a right to take round a sister
\[as\] wife, as also the other apostles, and the brethren of the Lord,
and Cephas?

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> Or \*I\* alone and Barnabas, have we not a
right not to work?

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> Who ever carries on war at his own charges?
who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? or who herds a
flock and does not eat of the milk of the flock?

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> Do I speak these things as a man, or does
not the law also say these things?

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> For in the law of Moses it is written, Thou
shalt not muzzle the ox that is treading out corn. Is God occupied about
the oxen,

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> or does he say \[it\] altogether for our
sakes? For for our sakes it has been written, that the plougher should
plough in hope, and he that treads out corn, in hope of partaking of
\[it\].

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> If we have sown to you spiritual things,
\[is it a\] great \[thing\] if \*we\* shall reap your carnal things?

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> If others partake of this right over you,
should not rather \*we\*? But we have not used this right, but we bear
all things, that we may put no hindrance in the way of the glad tidings
of the Christ.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> Do ye not know that they who labour
\[at\] sacred things eat of the \[offerings offered in the\] temple;
they that attend at the altar partake with the altar?

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> So also the Lord has ordained to those
that announce the glad tidings to live of the glad tidings.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> But \*I\* have used none of these things.
Now I have not written these things that it should be thus in my case;
for \[it were\] good for me rather to die than that any one should make
vain my boast.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> For if I announce the glad tidings, I
have nothing to boast of; for a necessity is laid upon me; for it is woe
to me if I should not announce the glad tidings.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> For if I do this voluntarily, I have a
reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with an
administration.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> What is the reward then that I have? That
in announcing the glad tidings I make the glad tidings costless \[to
others\], so as not to have made use, as belonging to me, of my right in
\[announcing\] the glad tidings.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> For being free from all, I have made
myself bondman to all, that I might gain the most \[possible\].

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> And I became to the Jews as a Jew, in
order that I might gain the Jews: to those under law, as under law, not
being myself under law, in order that I might gain those under law:

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> to those without law, as without law,
(not as without law to God, but as legitimately subject to Christ,) in
order that I might gain \[those\] without law.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> I became to the weak, \[as\] weak, in
order that I might gain the weak. To all I have become all things, in
order that at all events I might save some.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> And I do all things for the sake of the
glad tidings, that I may be fellow-partaker with them.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> Know ye not that they who run in \[the\]
race-course run all, but one receives the prize? Thus run in order that
ye may obtain.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> But every one that contends \[for a
prize\] is temperate in all things: \*they\* then indeed that they may
receive a corruptible crown, but \*we\* an incorruptible.

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> \*I\* therefore thus run, as not
uncertainly; so I combat, as not beating the air.

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> But I buffet my body, and lead it
captive, lest \[after\] having preached to others I should be myself
rejected.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> For I would not have you ignorant,
brethren, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed
through the sea;

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> and all were baptised unto Moses in the
cloud and in the sea;

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> and all ate the same spiritual food,

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> and all drank the same spiritual drink,
for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed \[them\]: (now the
rock was the Christ;)

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> yet God was not pleased with the most of
them, for they were strewed in the desert.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> But these things happened \[as\] types of
us, that we should not be lusters after evil things, as they also
lusted.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> Neither be ye idolaters, as some of them;
as it is written, The people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up
to play.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> Neither let us commit fornication, as
some of them committed fornication, and fell in one day three and twenty
thousand.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> Neither let us tempt the Christ, as some
of them tempted, and perished by serpents.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> Neither murmur ye, as some of them
murmured, and perished by the destroyer.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> Now all these things happened to them
\[as\] types, and have been written for our admonition, upon whom the
ends of the ages are come.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> So that let him that thinks that he
stands take heed lest he fall.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> No temptation has taken you but such as
is according to man's nature; and God is faithful, who will not suffer
you to be tempted above what ye are able \[to bear\], but will with the
temptation make the issue also, so that \[ye\] should be able to bear
\[it\].

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> Wherefore, my beloved, flee from
idolatry.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> I speak as to intelligent \[persons\]:
do \*ye\* judge what I say.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> The cup of blessing which we bless, is
it not \[the\] communion of the blood of the Christ? The bread which we
break, is it not \[the\] communion of the body of the Christ?

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> Because we, \[being\] many, are one
loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> See Israel according to flesh: are not
they who eat the sacrifices in communion with the altar?

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> What then do I say? that what is
sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything?

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> But that what \[the nations\] sacrifice
they sacrifice to demons, and not to God. Now I do not wish you to be in
communion with demons.

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> Ye cannot drink \[the\] Lord's cup, and
\[the\] cup of demons: ye cannot partake of \[the\] Lord's table, and of
\[the\] table of demons.

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are
we stronger than he?

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> All things are lawful, but all are not
profitable; all things are lawful, but all do not edify.

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> Let no one seek his own \[advantage\],
but that of the other.

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> Everything sold in the shambles eat,
making no inquiry for conscience sake.

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> For the earth \[is\] the Lord's and its
fulness.

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> But if any one of the unbelievers
invite you, and ye are minded to go, all that is set before you eat,
making no inquiry for conscience sake.

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> But if any one say to you, This is
offered to holy purposes, do not eat, for his sake that pointed it out,
and conscience sake;

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> but conscience, I mean, not thine own,
but that of the other: for why is my liberty judged by another
conscience?

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> If \*I\* partake with thanksgiving, why
am I spoken evil of for what \*I\* give thanks for?

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or
whatever ye do, do all things to God's glory.

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> Give no occasion to stumbling, whether
to Jews, or Greeks, or the assembly of God.

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> Even as \*I\* also please all in all
things; not seeking my own profit, but that of the many, that they may
be saved.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> Be my imitators, even as \*I\* also
\[am\] of Christ.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> Now I praise you, that in all things ye
are mindful of me; and that as I have directed you, ye keep the
directions.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> But I wish you to know that the Christ is
the head of every man, but woman's head \[is\] the man, and the Christ's
head God.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> Every man praying or prophesying, having
\[anything\] on his head, puts his head to shame.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> But every woman praying or prophesying
with her head uncovered puts her own head to shame; for it is one and
the same as a shaved \[woman\].

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> For if a woman be not covered, let her
hair also be cut off. But if \[it be\] shameful to a woman to have her
hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> For man indeed ought not to have his head
covered, being God's image and glory; but woman is man's glory.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> For man is not of woman, but woman of
man.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> For also man was not created for the sake
of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> Therefore ought the woman to have
authority on her head, on account of the angels.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> However, neither \[is\] woman without
man, nor man without woman, in \[the\] Lord.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> For as the woman \[is\] of the man, so
also \[is\] the man by the woman, but all things of God.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> Judge in yourselves: is it comely that
a woman should pray to God uncovered?

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> Does not even nature itself teach you,
that man, if he have long hair, it is a dishonour to him?

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> But woman, if she have long hair, \[it
is\] glory to her; for the long hair is given \[to her\] in lieu of a
veil.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> But if any one think to be contentious,
\*we\* have no such custom, nor the assemblies of God.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> But \[in\] prescribing \[to you on\]
this \[which I now enter on\], I do not praise, \[namely,\] that ye come
together, not for the better, but for the worse.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> For first, when ye come together in
assembly, I hear there exist divisions among you, and I partly give
credit \[to it\].

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> For there must also be sects among you,
that the approved may become manifest among you.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> When ye come therefore together into
one place, it is not to eat \[the\] Lord's supper.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> For each one in eating takes his
\*own\* supper before \[others\], and one is hungry and another drinks
to excess.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> Have ye not then houses for eating and
drinking? or do ye despise the assembly of God, and put to shame them
who have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this
\[point\] I do not praise.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> For \*I\* received from the Lord, that
which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in
which he was delivered up, took bread,

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> and having given thanks broke \[it\],
and said, This is my body, which \[is\] for you: this do in remembrance
of me.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> In like manner also the cup, after
having supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this
do, as often as ye shall drink \[it\], in remembrance of me.

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> For as often as ye shall eat this
bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he
come.

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> So that whosoever shall eat the bread,
or drink the cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty in respect of
the body and of the blood of the Lord.

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> But let a man prove himself, and thus
eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> For \[the\] eater and drinker eats and
drinks judgment to himself, not distinguishing the body.

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> On this account many among you \[are\]
weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep.

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> But if we judged ourselves, so were we
not judged.

<span id="an_11:32">11:32</span> But being judged, we are disciplined of
\[the\] Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.

<span id="an_11:33">11:33</span> So that, my brethren, when ye come
together to eat, wait for one another.

<span id="an_11:34">11:34</span> If any one be hungry, let him eat at
home, that ye may not come together for judgment. But the other things,
whenever I come, I will set in order.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> But concerning spiritual
\[manifestations\], brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> Ye know that when ye were \[of the\]
nations \[ye were\] led away to dumb idols, in whatever way ye might be
led.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> I give you therefore to know, that no
one, speaking in \[the power of the\] Spirit of God, says, Curse \[on\]
Jesus; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in \[the power of the\]
Holy Spirit.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> But there are distinctions of gifts, but
the same Spirit;

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> and there are distinctions of services,
and the same Lord;

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> and there are distinctions of operations,
but the same God who operates all things in all.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> But to each the manifestation of the
Spirit is given for profit.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> For to one, by the Spirit, is given
\[the\] word of wisdom; and to another \[the\] word of knowledge,
according to the same Spirit;

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> and to a different one faith, in \[the
power of\] the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healing in \[the
power of\] the same Spirit;

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> and to another operations of miracles;
and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; and to a
different one kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of
tongues.

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> But all these things operates the one
and the same Spirit, dividing to each in particular according as he
pleases.

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> For even as the body is one and has
many members, but all the members of the body, being many, are one body,
so also \[is\] the Christ.

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> For also in \[the power of\] one Spirit
\*we\* have all been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks,
whether bondmen or free, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> For also the body is not one member but
many.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> If the foot say, Because I am not a
hand I am not of the body, is it on account of this not indeed of the
body?

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> And if the ear say, Because I am not an
eye I am not of the body, is it on account of this not indeed of the
body?

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> If the whole body \[were\] an eye,
where the hearing? if all hearing, where the smelling?

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> But now God has set the members, each
one of them in the body, according as it has pleased \[him\].

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> But if all were one member, where the
body?

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> But now the members \[are\] many, and
the body one.

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> The eye cannot say to the hand, I have
not need of thee; or again, the head to the feet, I have not need of
you.

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> But much rather, the members of the
body which seem to be weaker are necessary;

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> and those \[parts\] of the body which
we esteem to be the more void of honour, these we clothe with more
abundant honour; and our uncomely \[parts\] have more abundant
comeliness;

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> but our comely \[parts\] have not need.
But God has tempered the body together, having given more abundant
honour to \[the part\] that lacked;

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> that there might be no division in the
body, but that the members might have the same concern one for another.

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> And if one member suffer, all the
members suffer with \[it\]; and if one member be glorified, all the
members rejoice with \[it\].

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> Now \*ye\* are Christ's body, and
members in particular.

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> And God has set certain in the
assembly: first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then
miraculous powers; then gifts of healings; helps; governments; kinds of
tongues.

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> \[Are\] all apostles? \[are\] all
prophets? \[are\] all teachers? \[are\] all \[in possession of\]
miraculous powers?

<span id="an_12:30">12:30</span> have all gifts of healings? do all
speak with tongues? do all interpret?

<span id="an_12:31">12:31</span> But desire earnestly the greater gifts,
and yet shew I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> If I speak with the tongues of men and of
angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass or a clanging
cymbal.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> And if I have prophecy, and know all
mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove
mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> And if I shall dole out all my goods in
food, and if I deliver up my body that I may be burned, but have not
love, I profit nothing.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> Love has long patience, is kind; love is
not emulous \[of others\]; love is not insolent and rash, is not puffed
up,

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> does not behave in an unseemly manner,
does not seek what is its own, is not quickly provoked, does not impute
evil,

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> does not rejoice at iniquity but rejoices
with the truth,

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> bears all things, believes all things,
hopes all things, endures all things.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> Love never fails; but whether prophecies,
they shall be done away; or tongues, they shall cease; or knowledge, it
shall be done away.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> For we know in part, and we prophesy in
part:

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> but when that which is perfect has
come, that which is in part shall be done away.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> When I was a child, I spoke as a child,
I felt as a child, I reasoned as a child; when I became a man, I had
done with what belonged to the child.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> For we see now through a dim window
obscurely, but then face to face; now I know partially, but then I shall
know according as I also have been known.

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> And now abide faith, hope, love; these
three things; and the greater of these \[is\] love.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> Follow after love, and be emulous of
spiritual \[manifestations\], but rather that ye may prophesy.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> For he that speaks with a tongue does not
speak to men but to God: for no one hears; but in spirit he speaks
mysteries.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> But he that prophesies speaks to men
\[in\] edification, and encouragement, and consolation.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> He that speaks with a tongue edifies
himself; but he that prophesies edifies \[the\] assembly.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> Now I desire that ye should all speak
with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy. But greater is he that
prophesies than he that speaks with tongues, unless he interpret, that
the assembly may receive edification.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> And now, brethren, if I come to you
speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I shall speak to
you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in
teaching?

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> Even lifeless things giving a sound,
whether pipe or harp, if they give not distinction to the sounds, how
shall it be known what is piped or harped?

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> For also, if the trumpet give an
uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for war?

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> Thus also \*ye\* with the tongue, unless
ye give a distinct speech, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye
will be speaking to the air.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> There are, it may be, so many kinds of
voices in the world, and none of undistinguishable sound.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> If therefore I do not know the power of
the sound, I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks
a barbarian for me.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> Thus \*ye\* also, since ye are desirous
of spirits, seek that ye may abound for the edification of the assembly.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> Wherefore let him that speaks with a
tongue pray that he may interpret.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> For if I pray with a tongue, my spirit
prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> What is it then? I will pray with the
spirit, but I will pray also with the understanding; I will sing with
the spirit, but I will sing also with the understanding.

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> Since otherwise, if thou blessest with
\[the\] spirit, how shall he who fills the place of the simple
\[Christian\] say Amen, at thy giving of thanks, since he does not know
what thou sayest?

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> For \*thou\* indeed givest thanks well,
but the other is not edified.

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> I thank God I speak in a tongue more
than all of you:

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> but in \[the\] assembly I desire to
speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also,
\[rather\] than ten thousand words in a tongue.

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> Brethren, be not children in \[your\]
minds, but in malice be babes; but in \[your\] minds be grown \[men\].

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> It is written in the law, By people of
other tongues, and by strange lips, will I speak to this people; and
neither thus will they hear me, saith the Lord.

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> So that tongues are for a sign, not to
those who believe, but to unbelievers; but prophecy, not to unbelievers,
but to those who believe.

<span id="an_14:23">14:23</span> If therefore the whole assembly come
together in one place, and all speak with tongues, and simple
\[persons\] enter in, or unbelievers, will not they say ye are mad?

<span id="an_14:24">14:24</span> But if all prophesy, and some
unbeliever or simple \[person\] come in, he is convicted of all, he is
judged of all;

<span id="an_14:25">14:25</span> the secrets of his heart are
manifested; and thus, falling upon \[his\] face, he will do homage to
God, reporting that God is indeed amongst you.

<span id="an_14:26">14:26</span> What is it then, brethren? whenever ye
come together, each \[of you\] has a psalm, has a teaching, has a
tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done
to edification.

<span id="an_14:27">14:27</span> If any one speak with a tongue, \[let
it be\] two, or at the most three, and separately, and let one
interpret;

<span id="an_14:28">14:28</span> but if there be no interpreter, let him
be silent in \[the\] assembly, and let him speak to himself and to God.

<span id="an_14:29">14:29</span> And let two or three prophets speak,
and let the others judge.

<span id="an_14:30">14:30</span> But if there be a revelation to another
sitting \[there\], let the first be silent.

<span id="an_14:31">14:31</span> For ye can all prophesy one by one,
that all may learn and all be encouraged.

<span id="an_14:32">14:32</span> And spirits of prophets are subject to
prophets.

<span id="an_14:33">14:33</span> For God is not \[a God\] of disorder
but of peace, as in all the assemblies of the saints.

<span id="an_14:34">14:34</span> Let \[your\] women be silent in the
assemblies, for it is not permitted to them to speak; but to be in
subjection, as the law also says.

<span id="an_14:35">14:35</span> But if they wish to learn anything, let
them ask their own husbands at home; for it is a shame for a woman to
speak in assembly.

<span id="an_14:36">14:36</span> Did the word of God go out from you, or
did it come to you only?

<span id="an_14:37">14:37</span> If any one thinks himself to be a
prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you,
that it is \[the\] Lord's commandment.

<span id="an_14:38">14:38</span> But if any be ignorant, let him be
ignorant.

<span id="an_14:39">14:39</span> So that, brethren, desire to prophesy,
and do not forbid the speaking with tongues.

<span id="an_14:40">14:40</span> But let all things be done comelily and
with order.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> But I make known to you, brethren, the
glad tidings which I announced to you, which also ye received, in which
also ye stand,

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> by which also ye are saved, (if ye hold
fast the word which I announced to you as the glad tidings,) unless
indeed ye have believed in vain.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> For I delivered to you, in the first
place, what also I had received, that Christ died for our sins,
according to the scriptures;

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> and that he was buried; and that he was
raised the third day, according to the scriptures;

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> and that he appeared to Cephas, then to
the twelve.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> Then he appeared to above five hundred
brethren at once, of whom the most remain until now, but some also have
fallen asleep.

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> Then he appeared to James; then to all
the apostles;

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> and last of all, as to an abortion, he
appeared to \*me\* also.

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> For \*I\* am the least of the apostles,
who am not fit to be called apostle, because I have persecuted the
assembly of God.

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> But by God's grace I am what I am; and
his grace, which \[was\] towards me, has not been vain; but I have
laboured more abundantly than they all, but not \*I\*, but the grace of
God which \[was\] with me.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> Whether, therefore, I or they, thus we
preach, and thus ye have believed.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> Now if Christ is preached that he is
raised from among \[the\] dead, how say some among you that there is not
a resurrection of \[those that are\] dead?

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> But if there is not a resurrection of
\[those that are\] dead, neither is Christ raised:

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> but if Christ is not raised, then,
indeed, vain also \[is\] our preaching, and vain also your faith.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> And we are found also false witnesses
of God; for we have witnessed concerning God that he raised the Christ,
whom he has not raised if indeed \[those that are\] dead are not raised.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> For if \[those that are\] dead are not
raised, neither is Christ raised;

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> but if Christ be not raised, your faith
\[is\] vain; ye are yet in your sins.

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> Then indeed also those who have fallen
asleep in Christ have perished.

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> If in this life only we have hope in
Christ, we are \[the\] most miserable of all men.

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> (But now Christ is raised from among
\[the\] dead, first-fruits of those fallen asleep.

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> For since by man \[came\] death, by man
also resurrection of \[those that are\] dead.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> For as in the Adam all die, thus also
in the Christ all shall be made alive.

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> But each in his own rank: \[the\]
first-fruits, Christ; then those that are the Christ's at his coming.

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> Then the end, when he gives up the
kingdom to him \[who is\] God and Father; when he shall have annulled
all rule and all authority and power.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> For he must reign until he put all
enemies under his feet.

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> \[The\] last enemy \[that\] is annulled
\[is\] death.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> For he has put all things in subjection
under his feet. But when he says that all things are put in subjection,
\[it is\] evident that \[it is\] except him who put all things in
subjection to him.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> But when all things shall have been
brought into subjection to him, then the Son also himself shall be
placed in subjection to him who put all things in subjection to him,
that God may be all in all.)

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> Since what shall the baptised for the
dead do if \[those that are\] dead rise not at all? why also are they
baptised for them?

<span id="an_15:30">15:30</span> Why do \*we\* also endanger ourselves
every hour?

<span id="an_15:31">15:31</span> Daily I die, by your boasting which I
have in Christ Jesus our Lord.

<span id="an_15:32">15:32</span> If, \[to speak\] after the manner of
man, I have fought with beasts in Ephesus, what is the profit to me if
\[those that are\] dead do not rise? let us eat and drink; for to-morrow
we die.

<span id="an_15:33">15:33</span> Be not deceived: evil communications
corrupt good manners.

<span id="an_15:34">15:34</span> Awake up righteously, and sin not; for
some are ignorant of God: I speak to you as a matter of shame.

<span id="an_15:35">15:35</span> But some one will say, How are the dead
raised? and with what body do they come?

<span id="an_15:36">15:36</span> Fool; what \*thou\* sowest is not
quickened unless it die.

<span id="an_15:37">15:37</span> And what thou sowest, thou sowest not
the body that shall be, but a bare grain: it may be of wheat, or some
one of the rest:

<span id="an_15:38">15:38</span> and God gives to it a body as he has
pleased, and to each of the seeds its own body.

<span id="an_15:39">15:39</span> Every flesh \[is\] not the same flesh,
but one \[is\] of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another
\[flesh\] of birds, and another of fishes.

<span id="an_15:40">15:40</span> And \[there are\] heavenly bodies, and
earthly bodies: but different is the glory of the heavenly, different
that of the earthly:

<span id="an_15:41">15:41</span> one \[the\] sun's glory, and another
\[the\] moon's glory, and another \[the\] stars' glory; for star differs
from star in glory.

<span id="an_15:42">15:42</span> Thus also \[is\] the resurrection of
the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruptibility.

<span id="an_15:43">15:43</span> It is sown in dishonour, it is raised
in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.

<span id="an_15:44">15:44</span> It is sown a natural body, it is raised
a spiritual body: if there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual
\[one\].

<span id="an_15:45">15:45</span> Thus also it is written, The first man
Adam became a living soul; the last Adam a quickening spirit.

<span id="an_15:46">15:46</span> But that which is spiritual \[was\] not
first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual:

<span id="an_15:47">15:47</span> the first man out of \[the\] earth,
made of dust; the second man, out of heaven.

<span id="an_15:48">15:48</span> Such as he made of dust, such also
those made of dust; and such as the heavenly \[one\], such also the
heavenly \[ones\].

<span id="an_15:49">15:49</span> And as we have borne the image of the
\[one\] made of dust, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly
\[one\].

<span id="an_15:50">15:50</span> But this I say, brethren, that flesh
and blood cannot inherit God's kingdom, nor does corruption inherit
incorruptibility.

<span id="an_15:51">15:51</span> Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall
not all fall asleep, but we shall all be changed,

<span id="an_15:52">15:52</span> in an instant, in \[the\] twinkling of
an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead
shall be raised incorruptible, and \*we\* shall be changed.

<span id="an_15:53">15:53</span> For this corruptible must needs put on
incorruptibility, and this mortal put on immortality.

<span id="an_15:54">15:54</span> But when this corruptible shall have
put on incorruptibility, and this mortal shall have put on immortality,
then shall come to pass the word written: Death has been swallowed up in
victory.

<span id="an_15:55">15:55</span> Where, O death, \[is\] thy sting?
where, O death, thy victory?

<span id="an_15:56">15:56</span> Now the sting of death \[is\] sin, and
the power of sin the law;

<span id="an_15:57">15:57</span> but thanks to God, who gives us the
victory by our Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_15:58">15:58</span> So then, my beloved brethren, be firm,
immovable, abounding always in the work of the Lord, knowing that your
toil is not in vain in \[the\] Lord.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> Now concerning the collection for the
saints, as I directed the assemblies of Galatia, so do \*ye\* do also.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> On \[the\] first of \[the\] week let each
of you put by at home, laying up \[in\] whatever \[degree\] he may have
prospered, that there may be no collections when I come.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> And when I am arrived, whomsoever ye
shall approve, these I will send with letters to carry your bounty to
Jerusalem:

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> and if it be suitable that \*I\* also
should go, they shall go with me.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> But I will come to you when I shall have
gone through Macedonia; for I do go through Macedonia.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> But perhaps I will stay with you, or even
winter with you, that \*ye\* may set me forward wheresoever I may go.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> For I will not see you now in passing,
for I hope to remain a certain time with you, if the Lord permit.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> But I remain in Ephesus until Pentecost.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> For a great door is opened to me and an
effectual \[one\], and \[the\] adversaries many.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> Now if Timotheus come, see that he may
be with you without fear; for he works the work of the Lord, even as I.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> Let not therefore any one despise him;
but set him forward in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him
with the brethren.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> Now concerning the brother Apollos, I
begged him much that he would go to you with the brethren; but it was
not at all \[his\] will to go now; but he will come when he shall have
good opportunity.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> Be vigilant; stand fast in the faith;
quit yourselves like men; be strong.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> Let all things ye do be done in love.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> But I beseech you, brethren, (ye know
the house of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruits of Achaia, and they
have devoted themselves to the saints for service,)

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> that \*ye\* should also be subject to
such, and to every one joined in the work and labouring.

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> But I rejoice in the coming of
Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus; because \*they\* have supplied
what was lacking on your part.

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> For they have refreshed my spirit and
yours: own therefore such.

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> The assemblies of Asia salute you.
Aquila and Priscilla, with the assembly in their house, salute you much
in \[the\] Lord.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> All the brethren salute you. Salute one
another with a holy kiss.

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> The salutation of \[me\] Paul with my
own hand.

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> If any one love not the Lord \[Jesus
Christ\] let him be Anathema Maranatha.

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
\[be\] with you.

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> My love \[be\] with you all in Christ
Jesus. Amen.
