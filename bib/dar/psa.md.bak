### Darby Bible: Psalms

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Blessed is the man that walketh not in the
counsel of the wicked, and standeth not in the way of sinners, and
sitteth not in the seat of scorners;

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> But his delight is in Jehovah's law, and in
his law doth he meditate day and night.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> And he \[is\] as a tree planted by brooks
of water, which giveth its fruit in its season, and whose leaf fadeth
not; and all that he doeth prospereth.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> The wicked are not so; but are as the chaff
which the wind driveth away.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the
judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> For Jehovah knoweth the way of the
righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Why are the nations in tumultuous
agitation, and \[why\] do the peoples meditate a vain thing?

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> The kings of the earth set themselves, and
the princes plot together, against Jehovah and against his anointed:

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> Let us break their bonds asunder, and cast
away their cords from us!

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> He that dwelleth in the heavens shall
laugh, the Lord shall have them in derision.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Then will he speak to them in his anger,
and in his fierce displeasure will he terrify them:

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> And \*I\* have anointed my king upon Zion,
the hill of my holiness.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> I will declare the decree: Jehovah hath
said unto me, Thou art my Son; \*I\* this day have begotten thee.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Ask of me, and I will give thee nations for
an inheritance, and for thy possession the ends of the earth:

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Thou shalt break them with a sceptre of
iron, as a potter's vessel thou shalt dash them in pieces.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> And now, O kings, be ye wise, be
admonished, ye judges of the earth.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with
trembling.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye
perish in the way, though his anger burn but a little. Blessed are all
who have their trust in him.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> {A Psalm of David, when he fled from
Absalom his son.} Jehovah, how many are they that trouble me, many they
that rise up against me!

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Many say of my soul, There is no salvation
for him in God. Selah.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> But thou, Jehovah, art a shield about me;
my glory, and the lifter up of my head.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> With my voice will I call to Jehovah, and
he will answer me from the hill of his holiness. Selah.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> I laid me down and slept; I awaked, for
Jehovah sustaineth me.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> I will not fear for myriads of the people
that have set themselves against me round about.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Arise, Jehovah; save me, my God! For thou
hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheekbone, thou hast broken the
teeth of the wicked.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Salvation is of Jehovah; thy blessing is
upon thy people. Selah.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> {To the chief Musician. On stringed
instruments. A Psalm of David.} When I call, answer me, O God of my
righteousness: in pressure thou hast enlarged me; be gracious unto me,
and hear my prayer.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Ye sons of men, till when is my glory \[to
be put\] to shame? \[How long\] will ye love vanity, will ye seek after
a lie? Selah.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> But know that Jehovah hath set apart the
pious \[man\] for himself: Jehovah will hear when I call unto him.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Be moved with anger, and sin not; meditate
in your own hearts upon your bed, and be still. Selah.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Offer sacrifices of righteousness, and
confide in Jehovah.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> Many say, Who shall cause us to see good?
Lift up upon us the light of thy countenance, O Jehovah.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> Thou hast put joy in my heart, more than in
the time that their corn and their new wine was in abundance.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> In peace will I both lay me down and sleep;
for thou, Jehovah, alone makest me to dwell in safety.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> {To the chief Musician. Upon Nehiloth. A
Psalm of David.} Give ear to my words, O Jehovah; consider my
meditation.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Hearken unto the voice of my crying, my
king and my God; for to thee will I pray.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> Jehovah, in the morning shalt thou hear my
voice; in the morning will I address myself to thee, and will look up.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> For thou art not a ùGod that hath pleasure
in wickedness; evil shall not sojourn with thee.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> Insolent fools shall not stand before thine
eyes; thou hatest all workers of iniquity.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies:
Jehovah abhorreth a man of blood and deceit.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> But as for me, in the greatness of thy
loving-kindness will I enter thy house; I will bow down toward the
temple of thy holiness in thy fear.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> Lead me, Jehovah, in thy righteousness,
because of my foes; make thy way plain before me.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> For there is no certainty in their mouth;
their inward part is perversion, their throat is an open sepulchre; they
flatter with their tongue.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> Bring guilt upon them, O God; let them
fall by their own counsels: drive them out in the multitude of their
transgressions, for they have rebelled against thee.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And all that trust in thee shall rejoice:
for ever shall they shout joyously, and thou wilt protect them; and they
that love thy name shall exult in thee.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> For thou, Jehovah, wilt bless the
righteous \[man\]; with favour wilt thou surround him as \[with\] a
shield.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> {To the chief Musician. On stringed
instruments, upon Sheminith. A Psalm of David.} Jehovah, rebuke me not
in thine anger, and chasten me not in thy hot displeasure.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Be gracious unto me, Jehovah, for I am
withered; Jehovah, heal me, for my bones tremble.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> And my soul trembleth exceedingly: and
thou, Jehovah, till how long?

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> Return, Jehovah, free my soul; save me for
thy loving-kindness' sake.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> For in death there is no remembrance of
thee; in Sheol who shall give thanks unto thee?

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> I am wearied with my groaning; all the
night make I my bed to swim; I dissolve my couch with my tears.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> Mine eye wasteth away through grief; it
hath grown old because of all mine oppressors.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity;
for Jehovah hath heard the voice of my weeping.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> Jehovah hath heard my supplication; Jehovah
receiveth my prayer.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> All mine enemies shall be ashamed and
tremble exceedingly; they will turn, they will be ashamed suddenly.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> {Shiggaion of David, which he sang to
Jehovah, concerning the words of Cush the Benjaminite.} Jehovah my God,
in thee have I trusted: save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me;

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> Lest he tear my soul like a lion, crushing
it while there is no deliverer.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> Jehovah my God, if I have done this, if
there be iniquity in my hands;

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> If I have rewarded evil to him that was at
peace with me; (indeed I have freed him that without cause oppressed
me;)

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> Let the enemy pursue after my soul, and
take \[it\], and let him tread down my life to the earth, and lay my
glory in the dust. Selah.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> Arise, Jehovah, in thine anger; lift
thyself up against the raging of mine oppressors, and awake for me: thou
hast commanded judgment.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> And the assembly of the peoples shall
encompass thee; and for their sakes return thou on high.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> Jehovah shall minister judgment to the
peoples. Judge me, Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and according
to mine integrity which is in me.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> Oh let the wrong of the wicked come to an
end, and establish thou the righteous \[man\]; even thou that triest the
hearts and reins, the righteous God.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> My shield is with God, who saveth the
upright in heart.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> God is a righteous judge, and a ùGod who
is indignant all the day.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> If one turn not, he will sharpen his
sword; he hath bent his bow and made it ready,

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> And he hath prepared for him instruments
of death; his arrows hath he made burning.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, yea,
he hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood:

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> He digged a pit, and hollowed it out, and
is fallen into the hole that he made.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> His mischief shall return upon his own
head, and his violence shall come down upon his own pate.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> I will praise Jehovah according to his
righteousness, and will sing forth the name of Jehovah the Most High.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> {To the chief Musician. Upon the Gittith. A
Psalm of David.} Jehovah our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the
earth! who hast set thy majesty above the heavens.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings
hast thou established praise because of thine adversaries, to still the
enemy and the avenger.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> When I see thy heavens, the work of thy
fingers, the moon and stars, which thou hast established;

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> What is man, that thou art mindful of him?
and the son of man, that thou visitest him?

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> Thou hast made him a little lower than the
angels, and hast crowned him with glory and splendour.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> Thou hast made him to rule over the works
of thy hands; thou hast put everything under his feet:

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> Sheep and oxen, all of them, and also the
beasts of the field;

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> The fowl of the heavens, and the fishes of
the sea, \[whatever\] passeth through the paths of the seas.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> Jehovah our Lord, how excellent is thy name
in all the earth!

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> {To the chief Musician. Upon Muthlabben. A
Psalm of David.} I will praise Jehovah with my whole heart; I will
recount all thy marvellous works.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> I will be glad and rejoice in thee; I will
sing forth thy name, O Most High.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> When mine enemies turned back, they
stumbled and perished at thy presence:

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> For thou hast maintained my right and my
cause. Thou sittest on the throne, judging righteously.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast
destroyed the wicked; thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> O enemy! destructions are ended for ever.
-- Thou hast also destroyed cities, even the remembrance of them hath
perished.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> But Jehovah sitteth for ever; he hath
ordained his throne for judgment.

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> And it is he that will judge the world with
righteousness; he shall execute judgment upon the peoples with equity.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> And Jehovah will be a refuge to the
oppressed one, a refuge in times of distress.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> And they that know thy name will confide
in thee; for thou, Jehovah, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> Sing psalms to Jehovah who dwelleth in
Zion; tell among the peoples his doings.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> For when he maketh inquisition for blood,
he remembereth them; the cry of the afflicted ones hath he not
forgotten.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> Be gracious unto me, O Jehovah; consider
mine affliction from them that hate me, lifting me up from the gates of
death:

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> That I may declare all thy praise in the
gates of the daughter of Zion. I will be joyful in thy salvation.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> The nations are sunk down in the pit
\[that\] they made; in the net that they hid is their own foot taken.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> Jehovah is known \[by\] the judgment he
hath executed: the wicked is ensnared in the work of his own hands.
Higgaion. Selah.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> The wicked shall be turned into Sheol,
all the nations that forget God.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> For the needy one shall not be forgotten
alway; the hope of the meek shall not perish for ever.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> Arise, Jehovah; let not man prevail: let
the nations be judged in thy sight.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> Put them in fear, Jehovah: that the
nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> Why, Jehovah, standest thou afar off?
\[Why\] hidest thou thyself in times of distress?

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> The wicked, in his pride, doth hotly
pursue the afflicted. They shall be taken in the devices that they have
imagined.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> For the wicked boasteth of his soul's
desire, and he blesseth the covetous; he contemneth Jehovah.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> The wicked \[saith\], in the haughtiness
of his countenance, He doth not search out: all his thoughts are, There
is no God!

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> His ways always succeed; thy judgments
are far above out of his sight; \[as for\] all his adversaries, he
puffeth at them.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> He saith in his heart, I shall not be
moved; from generation to generation I shall be in no adversity.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> His mouth is full of cursing, and deceit,
and oppression; under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> He sitteth in the lurking-places of the
villages; in the secret places doth he slay the innocent: his eyes watch
for the wretched.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> He lieth in wait secretly, like a lion in
his thicket; he lieth in wait to catch the afflicted: he doth catch the
afflicted, drawing him into his net.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> He croucheth, he boweth down, that the
wretched may fall by his strong ones.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> He saith in his heart, ùGod hath
forgotten, he hideth his face, he will never see \[it\].

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> Arise, Jehovah; O ùGod, lift up thy
hand: forget not the afflicted.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God?
He hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require \[it\].

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> Thou hast seen \[it\], for thou thyself
beholdest trouble and vexation, to requite by thy hand. The wretched
committeth himself unto thee; thou hast been the helper of the
fatherless.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> Break thou the arm of the wicked, and
as for the evil man, seek out his wickedness \[till\] thou find none.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> Jehovah is King for ever and ever: the
nations have perished out of his land.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> Jehovah, thou hast heard the desire of
the meek, thou hast established their heart: thou causest thine ear to
hear,

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> To do justice to the fatherless and the
oppressed one, that the man of the earth may terrify no more.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> {To the chief Musician. \[A Psalm\] of
David.} In Jehovah have I put my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee
\[as\] a bird to your mountain?

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> For behold, the wicked bend the bow, they
make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may in darkness shoot
at the upright in heart.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> If the foundations be destroyed, what
shall the righteous do?

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> Jehovah \[is\] in the temple of his
holiness; Jehovah, -- his throne is in the heavens: his eyes behold, his
eyelids try the children of men.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> Jehovah trieth the righteous one; but the
wicked, and him that loveth violence, his soul hateth.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> Upon the wicked he shall rain snares,
fire and brimstone; and scorching wind shall be the portion of their
cup.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> For righteous is Jehovah; he loveth
righteousness, his countenance doth behold the upright.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> {To the chief Musician. Upon Sheminith. A
Psalm of David.} Save, Jehovah, for the godly man is gone; for the
faithful have failed from among the children of men.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> They speak falsehood every one with his
neighbour: \[with\] flattering lip, with a double heart, do they speak.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> Jehovah will cut off all flattering lips,
the tongue that speaketh proud things,

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> Who have said, With our tongue will we
prevail, our lips are our own: who \[is\] lord over us?

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> Because of the oppression of the
afflicted, because of the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith
Jehovah, I will set \[him\] in safety, at whom they puff.

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> The words of Jehovah are pure words,
silver tried in the furnace of earth, purified seven times.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> Thou, Jehovah, wilt keep them, thou wilt
preserve them from this generation for ever.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> The wicked walk about on every side, when
vileness is exalted among the children of men.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> {To the chief Musician. A Psalm of
David.} How long, Jehovah, wilt thou forget me for ever? how long wilt
thou hide thy face from me?

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> How long shall I take counsel in my soul,
with sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over
me?

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> Consider, answer me, O Jehovah my God!
lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the \[sleep of\] death;

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed
against him! \[lest\] mine adversaries be joyful when I am moved.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> As for me, I have confided in thy
loving-kindness; my heart shall be joyful in thy salvation.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> I will sing unto Jehovah, for he hath
dealt bountifully with me.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> {To the chief Musician. \[A Psalm\] of
David.} The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They have
corrupted themselves, they have done abominable works: there is none
that doeth good.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> Jehovah looked down from the heavens upon
the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that
did seek God.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> They have all gone aside, they are
together become corrupt: there is none that doeth good, not even one.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> Have all the workers of iniquity no
knowledge, eating up my people \[as\] they eat bread? They call not upon
Jehovah.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> There were they in great fear; for God is
in the generation of the righteous.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> Ye have shamed the counsel of the
afflicted, because Jehovah \[was\] his refuge.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come
out of Zion! When Jehovah turneth again the captivity of his people,
Jacob shall be glad, Israel shall rejoice.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> {A Psalm of David.} Jehovah, who shall
sojourn in thy tent? who shall dwell in the hill of thy holiness?

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> He that walketh uprightly, and worketh
righteousness, and speaketh the truth from his heart.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> \[He that\] slandereth not with his
tongue, doeth not evil to his companion, nor taketh up a reproach
against his neighbour;

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> In whose eyes the depraved person is
contemned, and who honoureth them that fear Jehovah; who, if he have
sworn to his own hurt, changeth it not;

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> \[He that\] putteth not out his money to
usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these
\[things\] shall never be moved.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> {Michtam of David.} Preserve me, O ùGod:
for I trust in thee.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> Thou \[my soul\] hast said to Jehovah,
Thou art the Lord: my goodness \[extendeth\] not to thee; --

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> To the saints that are on the earth, and
to the excellent \[thou hast said\], In them is all my delight.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> Their sorrows shall be multiplied that
hasten after another: their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer,
and I will not take up their names into my lips.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> Jehovah is the portion of mine
inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant
places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> I will bless Jehovah, who giveth me
counsel; even in the nights my reins instruct me.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> I have set Jehovah continually before me;
because \[he is\] at my right hand, I shall not be moved.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> Therefore my heart rejoiceth, and my
glory exulteth; my flesh moreover shall dwell in hope.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> For thou wilt not leave my soul to
Sheol, neither wilt thou allow thy Holy One to see corruption.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> Thou wilt make known to me the path of
life: thy countenance is fulness of joy; at thy right hand are pleasures
for evermore.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> {A Prayer of David.} Hear the right, O
Jehovah, attend unto my cry; give ear unto my prayer, which is not out
of feigned lips.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> Let my judgment come forth from thy
presence, let thine eyes regard equity.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> Thou hast proved my heart, thou hast
visited me by night; thou hast tried me, thou hast found nothing: my
thought goeth not beyond my word.

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> Concerning the works of men, by the word
of thy lips I have kept from the paths of the violent \[man\].

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> When thou holdest my goings in thy paths,
my footsteps slip not.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> I have called upon thee, for thou
answerest me, O ùGod. Incline thine ear unto me, hear my speech.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> Shew wondrously thy loving-kindnesses, O
thou that savest by thy right hand them that trust \[in thee\] from
those that rise up \[against them\].

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me
under the shadow of thy wings,

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> From the wicked that destroy me, my
deadly enemies, who compass me about.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> They are enclosed in their own fat;
with their mouth they speak proudly.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> They have now encompassed us in our
steps; their eyes have they set, bowing down to the earth.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> He is like a lion that is greedy of its
prey, and as a young lion lurking in secret places.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> Arise, Jehovah, anticipate him, cast
him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, thy sword;

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> From men \[who are\] thy hand, O
Jehovah, from men of this age: their portion is in \[this\] life, and
their belly thou fillest with thy hid \[treasure\]; they have their fill
of sons, and leave the rest of their \[substance\] to their children.

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> As for me, I will behold thy face in
righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> {To the chief Musician. \[A Psalm\] of
David, the servant of Jehovah, who spoke to Jehovah the words of this
song in the day that Jehovah had delivered him out of the hand of all
his enemies and out of the hand of Saul. And he said,} I will love thee,
O Jehovah, my strength.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and
my deliverer; my ùGod, my rock, in whom I will trust; my shield, and the
horn of my salvation, my high tower.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> I will call upon Jehovah, who is to be
praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> The bands of death encompassed me, and
torrents of Belial made me afraid.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> The bands of Sheol surrounded me, the
cords of death encountered me.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> In my distress I called upon Jehovah, and
I cried out to my God; he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry
came before him, into his ears.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> Then the earth shook and quaked, and the
foundations of the mountains trembled and shook, because he was wroth.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> There went up a smoke out of his
nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals burned forth from
it.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> And he bowed the heavens, and came down;
and darkness was under his feet.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> And he rode upon a cherub and did fly;
yea, he flew fast upon the wings of the wind.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> He made darkness his secret place, his
tent round about him: darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> From the brightness before him his
thick clouds passed forth: hail and coals of fire.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> And Jehovah thundered in the heavens,
and the Most High uttered his voice: hail and coals of fire.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> And he sent his arrows, and scattered
\[mine enemies\]; and he shot forth lightnings, and discomfited them.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> And the beds of the waters were seen,
and the foundations of the world were uncovered at thy rebuke, Jehovah,
at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> He reached forth from above, he took
me, he drew me out of great waters:

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> He delivered me from my strong enemy,
and from them that hated me; for they were mightier than I.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> They encountered me in the day of my
calamity, but Jehovah was my stay.

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> And he brought me forth into a large
place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> Jehovah hath rewarded me according to
my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he
recompensed me.

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> For I have kept the ways of Jehovah,
and have not wickedly departed from my God.

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> For all his ordinances were before me,
and I did not put away his statutes from me;

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> And I was upright with him, and kept
myself from mine iniquity.

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> And Jehovah hath recompensed me
according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in
his sight.

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> With the gracious thou dost shew
thyself gracious; with the upright man thou dost shew thyself upright;

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> With the pure thou dost shew thyself
pure; and with the perverse thou dost shew thyself contrary.

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> For it is thou that savest the
afflicted people; but the haughty eyes wilt thou bring down.

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> For it is thou that makest my lamp to
shine: Jehovah my God enlighteneth my darkness.

<span id="an_18:29">18:29</span> For by thee I have run through a troop;
and by my God have I leaped over a wall.

<span id="an_18:30">18:30</span> As for ùGod, his way is perfect; the
word of Jehovah is tried: he is a shield to all that trust in him.

<span id="an_18:31">18:31</span> For who is +God save Jehovah? and who
is a rock if not our God?

<span id="an_18:32">18:32</span> The ùGod who girdeth me with strength,
and maketh my way perfect,

<span id="an_18:33">18:33</span> Who maketh my feet like hinds'
\[feet\], and setteth me upon my high places;

<span id="an_18:34">18:34</span> Who teacheth my hands to war, and mine
arms bend a bow of brass;

<span id="an_18:35">18:35</span> And thou didst give me the shield of
thy salvation, and thy right hand held me up; and thy condescending
gentleness hath made me great.

<span id="an_18:36">18:36</span> Thou didst enlarge my steps under me,
and mine ankles have not wavered.

<span id="an_18:37">18:37</span> I pursued mine enemies, and overtook
them; and I turned not again till they were consumed.

<span id="an_18:38">18:38</span> I crushed them, and they were not able
to rise: they fell under my feet.

<span id="an_18:39">18:39</span> And thou girdedst me with strength to
battle; thou didst subdue under me those that rose up against me.

<span id="an_18:40">18:40</span> And mine enemies didst thou make to
turn their backs unto me, and those that hated me I destroyed.

<span id="an_18:41">18:41</span> They cried, and there was none to save;
-- unto Jehovah, and he answered them not.

<span id="an_18:42">18:42</span> And I did beat them small as dust
before the wind; I did cast them out as the mire of the streets.

<span id="an_18:43">18:43</span> Thou hast delivered me from the
strivings of the people; thou hast made me the head of the nations: a
people I knew not doth serve me.

<span id="an_18:44">18:44</span> At the hearing of the ear, they obey
me: strangers come cringing unto me.

<span id="an_18:45">18:45</span> Strangers have faded away, and they
come trembling forth from their close places.

<span id="an_18:46">18:46</span> Jehovah liveth; and blessed be my rock;
and exalted be the God of my salvation,

<span id="an_18:47">18:47</span> The ùGod who hath avenged me, and hath
subjected the peoples to me;

<span id="an_18:48">18:48</span> Who hath delivered me from mine
enemies: yea, thou hast lifted me up above them that rose up against me;
from the man of violence hast thou delivered me.

<span id="an_18:49">18:49</span> Therefore will I give thanks to thee,
Jehovah, among the nations, and will sing psalms to thy name.

<span id="an_18:50">18:50</span> \[It is he\] who giveth great
deliverances to his king, and sheweth loving-kindness to his anointed,
to David, and to his seed for evermore.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> {To the chief Musician. A Psalm of
David.} The heavens declare the glory of ùGod; and the expanse sheweth
the work of his hands.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> Day unto day uttereth speech, and night
unto night sheweth knowledge.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> There is no speech and there are no
words, yet their voice is heard.

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> Their line is gone out through all the
earth, and their language to the extremity of the world. In them hath he
set a tent for the sun,

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> And he is as a bridegroom going forth
from his chamber; he rejoiceth as a strong man to run the race.

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> His going forth is from the end of the
heavens, and his circuit unto the ends of it; and there is nothing hid
from the heat thereof.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring
the soul; the testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the simple;

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> The precepts of Jehovah are right,
rejoicing the heart; the commandment of Jehovah is pure, enlightening
the eyes;

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring
for ever; the judgments of Jehovah are truth, they are righteous
altogether:

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> They are more precious than gold, yea,
than much fine gold; and sweeter than honey and the dropping of the
honeycomb.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> Moreover, by them is thy servant
enlightened; in keeping them there is great reward.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> Who understandeth \[his\] errors?
Purify me from secret \[faults\].

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> Keep back thy servant also from
presumptuous \[sins\]; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I
be perfect, and I shall be innocent from great transgression.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> Let the words of my mouth and the
meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Jehovah, my rock,
and my redeemer.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> {To the chief Musician. A Psalm of
David.} Jehovah answer thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God
of Jacob protect thee;

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> May he send thee help from the sanctuary,
and strengthen thee out of Zion;

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> Remember all thine oblations, and accept
thy burnt-offering; Selah.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> Grant thee according to thy heart, and
fulfil all thy counsels.

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> We will triumph in thy salvation, and in
the name of our God will we set up our banners. Jehovah fulfil all thy
petitions!

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> Now know I that Jehovah saveth his
anointed; he answereth him from the heavens of his holiness, with the
saving strength of his right hand.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> Some make mention of chariots, and some
of horses, but we of the name of Jehovah our God.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> They are bowed down and fallen; but we
are risen and stand upright.

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> Save, Jehovah! Let the king answer us in
the day we call.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> {To the chief Musician. A Psalm of
David.} The king shall joy in thy strength, Jehovah; and in thy
salvation how greatly shall he rejoice.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> Thou hast given him his heart's desire,
and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> For thou hast met him with the blessings
of goodness; thou hast set a crown of pure gold on his head.

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> He asked life of thee; thou gavest \[it\]
him, length of days for ever and ever.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> His glory is great through thy salvation;
majesty and splendour hast thou laid upon him.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> For thou hast made him to be blessings
for ever; thou hast filled him with joy by thy countenance.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> For the king confideth in Jehovah: and
through the loving-kindness of the Most High he shall not be moved.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> Thy hand shall find out all thine
enemies; thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> Thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace
in the time of thy presence; Jehovah shall swallow them up in his anger,
and the fire shall devour them:

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the
earth, and their seed from among the children of men.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> For they intended evil against thee;
they imagined a mischievous device, which they could not execute.

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> For thou wilt make them turn their
back; thou wilt make ready thy bowstring against their face.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> Be thou exalted, Jehovah, in thine own
strength: we will sing and celebrate thy power.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> {To the chief Musician. Upon
Aijeleth-Shahar. A Psalm of David.} My ùGod, my ùGod, why hast thou
forsaken me? \[why art thou\] far from my salvation, from the words of
my groaning?

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> My God, I cry by day, and thou answerest
not; and by night, and there is no rest for me:

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> And thou art holy, thou that dwellest
amid the praises of Israel.

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> Our fathers confided in thee: they
confided, and thou didst deliver them.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> They cried unto thee, and were delivered;
they confided in thee, and were not confounded.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach
of men, and the despised of the people.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> All they that see me laugh me to scorn;
they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, \[saying:\]

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> Commit it to Jehovah -- let him rescue
him; let him deliver him, because he delighteth in him!

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> But thou art he that took me out of the
womb; thou didst make me trust, upon my mother's breasts.

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> I was cast upon thee from the womb;
thou art my ùGod from my mother's belly.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> Be not far from me, for trouble is
near; for there is none to help.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> Many bulls have encompassed me;
Bashan's strong ones have beset me round.

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> They gape upon me with their mouth,
\[as\] a ravening and a roaring lion.

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> I am poured out like water, and all my
bones are out of joint: my heart is become like wax; it is melted in the
midst of my bowels.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> My strength is dried up like a
potsherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my palate; and thou hast laid me in
the dust of death.

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> For dogs have encompassed me; an
assembly of evil-doers have surrounded me: they pierced my hands and my
feet.

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> I may count all my bones. They look,
they stare upon me;

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> They part my garments among them, and
cast lots upon my vesture.

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> But thou, Jehovah, be not far \[from
me\]; O my strength, haste thee to help me.

<span id="an_22:20">22:20</span> Deliver my soul from the sword; my only
one from the power of the dog;

<span id="an_22:21">22:21</span> Save me from the lion's mouth. Yea,
from the horns of the buffaloes hast thou answered me.

<span id="an_22:22">22:22</span> I will declare thy name unto my
brethren, in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.

<span id="an_22:23">22:23</span> Ye that fear Jehovah, praise him; all
ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and revere him, all ye the seed of
Israel.

<span id="an_22:24">22:24</span> For he hath not despised nor abhorred
the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him:
but when he cried unto him, he heard.

<span id="an_22:25">22:25</span> My praise is from thee, in the great
congregation; I will pay my vows before them that fear him.

<span id="an_22:26">22:26</span> The meek shall eat and be satisfied;
they shall praise Jehovah that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.

<span id="an_22:27">22:27</span> All the ends of the earth shall
remember and turn unto Jehovah, and all the families of the nations
shall worship before thee:

<span id="an_22:28">22:28</span> For the kingdom is Jehovah's, and he
ruleth among the nations.

<span id="an_22:29">22:29</span> All the fat ones of the earth shall eat
and worship; all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him, and
he that cannot keep alive his own soul.

<span id="an_22:30">22:30</span> A seed shall serve him; it shall be
accounted to the Lord for a generation.

<span id="an_22:31">22:31</span> They shall come, and shall declare his
righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done
\[it\].

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> {A Psalm of David.} Jehovah is my
shepherd; I shall not want.

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> He maketh me to lie down in green
pastures; he leadeth me beside still waters.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in
paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> Yea, though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod
and thy staff, they comfort me.

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> Thou preparest a table before me in the
presence of mine enemies; thou hast anointed my head with oil; my cup
runneth over.

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> Surely, goodness and loving-kindness
shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house
of Jehovah for the length of the days.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> {Of David. A Psalm.} The earth is
Jehovah's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell
therein.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> For it was he that founded it upon seas,
and established it upon floods.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> Who shall ascend into the mount of
Jehovah? and who shall stand in his holy place?

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> He that hath blameless hands and a pure
heart; who lifteth not up his soul unto vanity, nor sweareth
deceitfully:

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> He shall receive blessing from Jehovah,
and righteousness from the God of his salvation.

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> This is the generation of them that seek
unto him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> Lift up your heads, ye gates, and be ye
lifted up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in.

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> Who is this King of glory? Jehovah strong
and mighty, Jehovah mighty in battle.

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> Lift up your heads, ye gates; yea, lift
up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in.

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> Who is he, this King of glory? Jehovah
of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.

<span id="an_25:1">25:1</span> {\[A Psalm\] of David.} Unto thee,
Jehovah, do I lift up my soul.

<span id="an_25:2">25:2</span> My God, I confide in thee; let me not be
ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.

<span id="an_25:3">25:3</span> Yea, none that wait on thee shall be
ashamed: they shall be ashamed that deal treacherously without cause.

<span id="an_25:4">25:4</span> Make me to know thy ways, O Jehovah;
teach me thy paths.

<span id="an_25:5">25:5</span> Make me to walk in thy truth, and teach
me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.

<span id="an_25:6">25:6</span> Remember, Jehovah, thy tender mercies and
thy loving-kindnesses; for they are from everlasting.

<span id="an_25:7">25:7</span> Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my
transgressions; according to thy loving-kindness remember thou me, for
thy goodness' sake, Jehovah.

<span id="an_25:8">25:8</span> Good and upright is Jehovah; therefore
will he instruct sinners in the way:

<span id="an_25:9">25:9</span> The meek will he guide in judgment, and
the meek will he teach his way.

<span id="an_25:10">25:10</span> All the paths of Jehovah are
loving-kindness and truth for such as keep his covenant and his
testimonies.

<span id="an_25:11">25:11</span> For thy name's sake, O Jehovah, thou
wilt indeed pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.

<span id="an_25:12">25:12</span> What man is he that feareth Jehovah?
him will he instruct in the way \[that\] he should choose.

<span id="an_25:13">25:13</span> His soul shall dwell in prosperity, and
his seed shall inherit the earth.

<span id="an_25:14">25:14</span> The secret of Jehovah is with them that
fear him, that he may make known his covenant to them.

<span id="an_25:15">25:15</span> Mine eyes are ever toward Jehovah; for
he will bring my feet out of the net.

<span id="an_25:16">25:16</span> Turn toward me, and be gracious unto
me; for I am solitary and afflicted.

<span id="an_25:17">25:17</span> The troubles of my heart are increased:
bring me out of my distresses;

<span id="an_25:18">25:18</span> Consider mine affliction and my
travail, and forgive all my sins.

<span id="an_25:19">25:19</span> Consider mine enemies, for they are
many, and they hate me \[with\] cruel hatred.

<span id="an_25:20">25:20</span> Keep my soul, and deliver me: let me
not be ashamed; for I trust in thee.

<span id="an_25:21">25:21</span> Let integrity and uprightness preserve
me; for I wait on thee.

<span id="an_25:22">25:22</span> Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his
troubles.

<span id="an_26:1">26:1</span> {\[A Psalm\] of David.} Judge me, O
Jehovah, for I have walked in mine integrity, and I have confided in
Jehovah: I shall not slip.

<span id="an_26:2">26:2</span> Prove me, Jehovah, and test me; try my
reins and my heart:

<span id="an_26:3">26:3</span> For thy loving-kindness is before mine
eyes, and I have walked in thy truth.

<span id="an_26:4">26:4</span> I have not sat with vain persons, neither
have I gone in with dissemblers;

<span id="an_26:5">26:5</span> I have hated the congregation of
evil-doers, and I have not sat with the wicked.

<span id="an_26:6">26:6</span> I will wash my hands in innocency, and
will encompass thine altar, O Jehovah,

<span id="an_26:7">26:7</span> That I may cause the voice of
thanksgiving to be heard, and declare all thy marvellous works.

<span id="an_26:8">26:8</span> Jehovah, I have loved the habitation of
thy house, and the place where thy glory dwelleth.

<span id="an_26:9">26:9</span> Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my
life with men of blood;

<span id="an_26:10">26:10</span> In whose hands are evil devices, and
their right hand is full of bribes.

<span id="an_26:11">26:11</span> But as for me, I will walk in mine
integrity. Redeem me, and be gracious unto me.

<span id="an_26:12">26:12</span> My foot standeth in an even place; in
the congregations will I bless Jehovah.

<span id="an_27:1">27:1</span> {\[A Psalm\] of David.} Jehovah is my
light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? Jehovah is the strength of my
life; of whom shall I be afraid?

<span id="an_27:2">27:2</span> When evil-doers, mine adversaries and
mine enemies, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.

<span id="an_27:3">27:3</span> If a host encamp against me, my heart
shall not fear; if war rise against me, in this will I be confident.

<span id="an_27:4">27:4</span> One \[thing\] have I asked of Jehovah,
that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the
days of my life, to behold the beauty of Jehovah, and to inquire \[of
him\] in his temple.

<span id="an_27:5">27:5</span> For in the day of evil he will hide me in
his pavilion; in the secret of his tent will he keep me concealed: he
will set me high upon a rock.

<span id="an_27:6">27:6</span> And now shall my head be lifted up above
mine enemies round about me; and I will offer in his tent sacrifices of
shouts of joy: I will sing, yea, I will sing psalms unto Jehovah.

<span id="an_27:7">27:7</span> Hear, Jehovah; with my voice do I call;
be gracious unto me, and answer me.

<span id="an_27:8">27:8</span> My heart said for thee, Seek ye my face.
Thy face, O Jehovah, will I seek.

<span id="an_27:9">27:9</span> Hide not thy face from me; put not thy
servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; cast me not off, neither
forsake me, O God of my salvation.

<span id="an_27:10">27:10</span> For had my father and my mother
forsaken me, then had Jehovah taken me up.

<span id="an_27:11">27:11</span> Teach me thy way, Jehovah, and lead me
in an even path, because of mine enemies.

<span id="an_27:12">27:12</span> Deliver me not over to the will of mine
adversaries; for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as
breathe out violence.

<span id="an_27:13">27:13</span> Unless I had believed to see the
goodness of Jehovah in the land of the living ...!

<span id="an_27:14">27:14</span> Wait for Jehovah; be strong and let thy
heart take courage: yea, wait for Jehovah.

<span id="an_28:1">28:1</span> {\[A Psalm\] of David.} Unto thee,
Jehovah, do I call; my rock, be not silent unto me, lest, \[if\] thou
keep silence toward me, I become like them that go down into the pit.

<span id="an_28:2">28:2</span> Hear the voice of my supplications, when
I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward the oracle of thy
holiness.

<span id="an_28:3">28:3</span> Draw me not away with the wicked, and
with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace to their neighbours, and
mischief is in their heart.

<span id="an_28:4">28:4</span> Give them according to their doing, and
according to the wickedness of their deeds; give them after the work of
their hands, render to them their desert.

<span id="an_28:5">28:5</span> For they regard not the deeds of Jehovah,
nor the work of his hands: he will destroy them, and not build them up.

<span id="an_28:6">28:6</span> Blessed be Jehovah, for he hath heard the
voice of my supplications.

<span id="an_28:7">28:7</span> Jehovah is my strength and my shield; my
heart confided in him, and I was helped: therefore my heart exulteth,
and with my song will I praise him.

<span id="an_28:8">28:8</span> Jehovah is their strength; and he is the
stronghold of salvation to his anointed one.

<span id="an_28:9">28:9</span> Save thy people, and bless thine
inheritance; and feed them, and lift them up for ever.

<span id="an_29:1">29:1</span> {A Psalm of David.} Give unto Jehovah, ye
sons of the mighty ones, give unto Jehovah glory and strength;

<span id="an_29:2">29:2</span> Give unto Jehovah the glory of his name;
worship Jehovah in holy splendour.

<span id="an_29:3">29:3</span> The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters:
the ùGod of glory thundereth, -- Jehovah upon great waters.

<span id="an_29:4">29:4</span> The voice of Jehovah is powerful; the
voice of Jehovah is full of majesty.

<span id="an_29:5">29:5</span> The voice of Jehovah breaketh cedars;
yea, Jehovah breaketh the cedars of Lebanon:

<span id="an_29:6">29:6</span> And he maketh them to skip like a calf,
Lebanon and Sirion like a young buffalo.

<span id="an_29:7">29:7</span> The voice of Jehovah cleaveth out flames
of fire.

<span id="an_29:8">29:8</span> The voice of Jehovah shaketh the
wilderness; Jehovah shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.

<span id="an_29:9">29:9</span> The voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds to
calve, and layeth bare the forests; and in his temple doth every one
say, Glory!

<span id="an_29:10">29:10</span> Jehovah sitteth upon the flood; yea,
Jehovah sitteth as king for ever.

<span id="an_29:11">29:11</span> Jehovah will give strength unto his
people; Jehovah will bless his people with peace.

<span id="an_30:1">30:1</span> {A Psalm of David: dedication-song of the
house.} I will extol thee, Jehovah; for thou hast delivered me, and hast
not made mine enemies to rejoice over me.

<span id="an_30:2">30:2</span> Jehovah my God, I cried unto thee, and
thou hast healed me.

<span id="an_30:3">30:3</span> Jehovah, thou hast brought up my soul
from Sheol, thou hast quickened me from among those that go down to the
pit.

<span id="an_30:4">30:4</span> Sing psalms unto Jehovah, ye saints of
his, and give thanks in remembrance of his holiness.

<span id="an_30:5">30:5</span> For a moment \[is passed\] in his anger,
a life in his favour; at even weeping cometh for the night, and at morn
there is rejoicing.

<span id="an_30:6">30:6</span> As for me, I said in my prosperity, I
shall never be moved.

<span id="an_30:7">30:7</span> Jehovah, by thy favour thou hadst made my
mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face; I was troubled.

<span id="an_30:8">30:8</span> I called to thee, Jehovah, and unto the
Lord did I make supplication:

<span id="an_30:9">30:9</span> What profit is there in my blood, in my
going down to the pit? shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy
truth?

<span id="an_30:10">30:10</span> Hear, O Jehovah, and be gracious unto
me; Jehovah, be my helper.

<span id="an_30:11">30:11</span> Thou hast turned for me my mourning
into dancing; thou hast loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with
gladness;

<span id="an_30:12">30:12</span> That \[my\] glory may sing psalms of
thee, and not be silent. Jehovah my God, I will praise thee for ever.

<span id="an_31:1">31:1</span> {To the chief Musician. A Psalm of
David.} In thee, Jehovah, do I trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver
me in thy righteousness.

<span id="an_31:2">31:2</span> Incline thine ear to me, deliver me
speedily; be a strong rock to me, a house of defence to save me.

<span id="an_31:3">31:3</span> For thou art my rock and my fortress;
and, for thy name's sake, thou wilt lead me and guide me.

<span id="an_31:4">31:4</span> Draw me out of the net that they have
hidden for me; for thou art my strength.

<span id="an_31:5">31:5</span> Into thy hand I commit my spirit: thou
hast redeemed me, Jehovah, \[thou\] ùGod of truth.

<span id="an_31:6">31:6</span> I have hated them that observe lying
vanities; and as for me, I have confided in Jehovah.

<span id="an_31:7">31:7</span> I will be glad and rejoice in thy
loving-kindness, for thou hast seen mine affliction; thou hast known the
troubles of my soul,

<span id="an_31:8">31:8</span> And hast not shut me up into the hand of
the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large place.

<span id="an_31:9">31:9</span> Be gracious unto me, Jehovah, for I am in
trouble: mine eye wasteth away with vexation, my soul and my belly.

<span id="an_31:10">31:10</span> For my life is spent with sorrow, and
my years with sighing; my strength faileth through mine iniquity, and my
bones are wasted.

<span id="an_31:11">31:11</span> More than to all mine oppressors, I am
become exceedingly a reproach, even to my neighbours, and a fear to mine
acquaintance: they that see me without flee from me.

<span id="an_31:12">31:12</span> I am forgotten in \[their\] heart as a
dead man; I am become like a broken vessel.

<span id="an_31:13">31:13</span> For I have heard the slander of many --
terror on every side -- when they take counsel together against me: they
plot to take away my life.

<span id="an_31:14">31:14</span> But I confided in thee, Jehovah; I
said, thou art my God.

<span id="an_31:15">31:15</span> My times are in thy hand: deliver me
from the hand of mine enemies, and from my persecutors.

<span id="an_31:16">31:16</span> Make thy face to shine upon thy
servant; save me in thy loving-kindness.

<span id="an_31:17">31:17</span> Jehovah, let me not be ashamed; for I
have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, let them be silent in
Sheol.

<span id="an_31:18">31:18</span> Let the lying lips become dumb, which
speak insolently against the righteous in pride and contempt.

<span id="an_31:19">31:19</span> \[Oh\] how great is thy goodness, which
thou hast laid up for them that fear thee, \[which\] thou hast wrought
for them that trust in thee, before the sons of men!

<span id="an_31:20">31:20</span> Thou keepest them concealed in the
secret of thy presence from the conspiracies of man; thou hidest them in
a pavilion from the strife of tongues.

<span id="an_31:21">31:21</span> Blessed be Jehovah; for he hath shewn
me wondrously his loving-kindness in a strong city.

<span id="an_31:22">31:22</span> As for me, I said in my haste, I am cut
off from before thine eyes; nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my
supplications when I cried unto thee.

<span id="an_31:23">31:23</span> Love Jehovah, all ye his saints.
Jehovah preserveth the faithful, and plentifully requiteth the proud
doer.

<span id="an_31:24">31:24</span> Be strong, and let your heart take
courage, all ye that hope in Jehovah.

<span id="an_32:1">32:1</span> {Of David. Instruction.} Blessed is he
\[whose\] transgression is forgiven, \[whose\] sin is covered!

<span id="an_32:2">32:2</span> Blessed is the man unto whom Jehovah
reckoneth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile!

<span id="an_32:3">32:3</span> When I kept silence, my bones waxed old,
through my groaning all the day long.

<span id="an_32:4">32:4</span> For day and night thy hand was heavy upon
me; my moisture was turned into the drought of summer. Selah.

<span id="an_32:5">32:5</span> I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine
iniquity I covered not; I said, I will confess my transgressions unto
Jehovah, and \*thou\* forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.

<span id="an_32:6">32:6</span> For this shall every one that is godly
pray unto thee at a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods
of great waters they will not reach him.

<span id="an_32:7">32:7</span> Thou art a hiding-place for me; thou
preservest me from trouble; thou dost encompass me with songs of
deliverance. Selah.

<span id="an_32:8">32:8</span> I will instruct thee and teach thee the
way in which thou shalt go; I will counsel \[thee\] with mine eye upon
thee.

<span id="an_32:9">32:9</span> Be ye not as a horse, as a mule, which
have no understanding: whose trappings must be bit and bridle, for
restraint, or they will not come unto thee.

<span id="an_32:10">32:10</span> Many sorrows hath the wicked; but he
that confideth in Jehovah, loving-kindness shall encompass him.

<span id="an_32:11">32:11</span> Rejoice in Jehovah, and be glad, ye
righteous; and shout for joy, all ye upright in heart.

<span id="an_33:1">33:1</span> Exult, ye righteous, in Jehovah: praise
is comely for the upright.

<span id="an_33:2">33:2</span> Give thanks unto Jehovah with the harp;
sing psalms unto him with the ten-stringed lute.

<span id="an_33:3">33:3</span> Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully
with a loud sound.

<span id="an_33:4">33:4</span> For the word of Jehovah is right, and all
his work is in faithfulness.

<span id="an_33:5">33:5</span> He loveth righteousness and judgment: the
earth is full of the loving-kindness of Jehovah.

<span id="an_33:6">33:6</span> By the word of Jehovah were the heavens
made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.

<span id="an_33:7">33:7</span> He gathereth the waters of the sea
together as a heap; he layeth up the deeps in storehouses.

<span id="an_33:8">33:8</span> Let all the earth fear Jehovah; let all
the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.

<span id="an_33:9">33:9</span> For \*he\* spoke, and it was \[done\];
\*he\* commanded, and it stood fast.

<span id="an_33:10">33:10</span> Jehovah frustrateth the counsel of the
nations; he maketh the thoughts of the peoples of none effect.

<span id="an_33:11">33:11</span> The counsel of Jehovah standeth for
ever, the thoughts of his heart from generation to generation.

<span id="an_33:12">33:12</span> Blessed is the nation whose God is
Jehovah, the people that he hath chosen for his inheritance!

<span id="an_33:13">33:13</span> Jehovah looketh from the heavens; he
beholdeth all the sons of men:

<span id="an_33:14">33:14</span> From the place of his habitation he
looketh forth upon all the inhabitants of the earth;

<span id="an_33:15">33:15</span> He who fashioneth the hearts of them
all, who considereth all their works.

<span id="an_33:16">33:16</span> The king is not saved by the multitude
of \[his\] forces; a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.

<span id="an_33:17">33:17</span> The horse is a vain thing for safety;
neither doth he deliver by his great power.

<span id="an_33:18">33:18</span> Behold, the eye of Jehovah is upon them
that fear him, upon them that hope in his loving-kindness,

<span id="an_33:19">33:19</span> To deliver their soul from death, and
to keep them alive in famine.

<span id="an_33:20">33:20</span> Our soul waiteth for Jehovah: he is our
help and our shield.

<span id="an_33:21">33:21</span> For in him shall our heart rejoice,
because we have confided in his holy name.

<span id="an_33:22">33:22</span> Let thy loving-kindness, O Jehovah, be
upon us, according as we have hoped in thee.

<span id="an_34:1">34:1</span> {\[A Psalm\] of David; when he changed
his behaviour before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.} I
will bless Jehovah at all times; his praise shall continually be in my
mouth.

<span id="an_34:2">34:2</span> My soul shall make its boast in Jehovah:
the meek shall hear, and rejoice.

<span id="an_34:3">34:3</span> Magnify Jehovah with me, and let us exalt
his name together.

<span id="an_34:4">34:4</span> I sought Jehovah, and he answered me, and
delivered me from all my fears.

<span id="an_34:5">34:5</span> They looked unto him, and were
enlightened, and their faces were not confounded.

<span id="an_34:6">34:6</span> This afflicted one called, and Jehovah
heard \[him\], and saved him out of all his troubles.

<span id="an_34:7">34:7</span> The angel of Jehovah encampeth round
about them that fear him, and delivereth them.

<span id="an_34:8">34:8</span> Taste and see that Jehovah is good:
blessed is the man that trusteth in him!

<span id="an_34:9">34:9</span> Fear Jehovah, ye his saints; for there is
no want to them that fear him.

<span id="an_34:10">34:10</span> The young lions are in need and suffer
hunger; but they that seek Jehovah shall not want any good.

<span id="an_34:11">34:11</span> Come, ye sons, hearken unto me: I will
teach you the fear of Jehovah.

<span id="an_34:12">34:12</span> What man is he that desireth life,
\[and\] loveth days, that he may see good?

<span id="an_34:13">34:13</span> Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips
from speaking guile;

<span id="an_34:14">34:14</span> Depart from evil, and do good; seek
peace, and pursue it.

<span id="an_34:15">34:15</span> The eyes of Jehovah are upon the
righteous, and his ears are toward their cry;

<span id="an_34:16">34:16</span> The face of Jehovah is against them
that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth:

<span id="an_34:17">34:17</span> \[The righteous\] cry, and Jehovah
heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.

<span id="an_34:18">34:18</span> Jehovah is nigh to those that are of a
broken heart, and saveth them that are of a contrite spirit.

<span id="an_34:19">34:19</span> Many are the adversities of the
righteous, but Jehovah delivereth him out of them all:

<span id="an_34:20">34:20</span> He keepeth all his bones; not one of
them is broken.

<span id="an_34:21">34:21</span> Evil shall destroy the wicked; and they
that hate the righteous shall bear their guilt.

<span id="an_34:22">34:22</span> Jehovah redeemeth the soul of his
servants; and none of them that trust in him shall bear guilt.

<span id="an_35:1">35:1</span> {\[A Psalm\] of David.} Strive, O
Jehovah, with them that strive with me; fight against them that fight
against me:

<span id="an_35:2">35:2</span> Take hold of shield and buckler, and
stand up for my help;

<span id="an_35:3">35:3</span> And draw out the spear, and stop \[the
way\] against my pursuers: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.

<span id="an_35:4">35:4</span> Let them be put to shame and confounded
that seek after my life; let them be turned backward and brought to
confusion that devise my hurt:

<span id="an_35:5">35:5</span> Let them be as chaff before the wind, and
let the angel of Jehovah drive \[them\] away;

<span id="an_35:6">35:6</span> Let their way be dark and slippery, and
let the angel of Jehovah pursue them.

<span id="an_35:7">35:7</span> For without cause have they hidden for me
their net \[in\] a pit; without cause they have digged \[it\] for my
soul.

<span id="an_35:8">35:8</span> Let destruction come upon him unawares,
and let his net which he hath hidden catch himself: for destruction let
him fall therein.

<span id="an_35:9">35:9</span> And my soul shall be joyful in Jehovah;
it shall rejoice in his salvation.

<span id="an_35:10">35:10</span> All my bones shall say, Jehovah, who is
like unto thee, who deliverest the afflicted from one stronger than he,
yea, the afflicted and the needy from him that spoileth him!

<span id="an_35:11">35:11</span> Unrighteous witnesses rise up; they lay
to my charge things which I know not.

<span id="an_35:12">35:12</span> They reward me evil for good, \[to\]
the bereavement of my soul.

<span id="an_35:13">35:13</span> But as for me, when they were sick, my
clothing was sackcloth; I chastened my soul with fasting, and my prayer
returned into mine own bosom:

<span id="an_35:14">35:14</span> I behaved myself as though \[he had
been\] a friend, a brother to me; I bowed down in sadness, as one that
mourneth \[for\] a mother.

<span id="an_35:15">35:15</span> But at my halting they rejoiced, and
gathered together: the slanderers gathered themselves together against
me, and I knew \[it\] not; they did tear \[me\], and ceased not:

<span id="an_35:16">35:16</span> With profane jesters for bread, they
have gnashed their teeth against me.

<span id="an_35:17">35:17</span> Lord, how long wilt thou look on?
Rescue my soul from their destructions, my only one from the young
lions.

<span id="an_35:18">35:18</span> I will give thee thanks in the great
congregation; I will praise thee among much people.

<span id="an_35:19">35:19</span> Let not them that are wrongfully mine
enemies rejoice over me; let them not wink with the eye that hate me
without cause.

<span id="an_35:20">35:20</span> For they speak not peace; and they
devise deceitful words against the quiet in the land.

<span id="an_35:21">35:21</span> And they opened their mouth wide
against me; they said, Aha! aha! our eye hath seen \[it\].

<span id="an_35:22">35:22</span> Thou hast seen \[it\], Jehovah: keep
not silence; O Lord, be not far from me.

<span id="an_35:23">35:23</span> Stir up thyself, and awake for my
right, for my cause, my God and Lord!

<span id="an_35:24">35:24</span> Judge me, Jehovah my God, according to
thy righteousness, and let them not rejoice over me.

<span id="an_35:25">35:25</span> Let them not say in their heart, Aha!
so would we have it. Let them not say, We have swallowed him up.

<span id="an_35:26">35:26</span> Let them be ashamed and brought to
confusion together that rejoice at mine adversity; let them be clothed
with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.

<span id="an_35:27">35:27</span> Let them exult and rejoice that delight
in my righteousness; and let them say continually, Jehovah be magnified,
who delighteth in the prosperity of his servant.

<span id="an_35:28">35:28</span> And my tongue shall talk of thy
righteousness, \[and\] of thy praise, all the day.

<span id="an_36:1">36:1</span> {To the chief Musician. \[A Psalm\] of
the servant of Jehovah; of David.} The transgression of the wicked
uttereth within my heart, There is no fear of God before his eyes.

<span id="an_36:2">36:2</span> For he flattereth himself in his own
eyes, \[even\] when his iniquity is found to be hateful.

<span id="an_36:3">36:3</span> The words of his mouth are wickedness and
deceit: he hath left off to be wise, to do good.

<span id="an_36:4">36:4</span> He deviseth wickedness up on his bed; he
setteth himself in a way that is not good: he abhorreth not evil.

<span id="an_36:5">36:5</span> Jehovah, thy loving-kindness is in the
heavens, and thy faithfulness \[reacheth\] unto the clouds.

<span id="an_36:6">36:6</span> Thy righteousness is like the high
mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: thou, Jehovah, preservest man
and beast.

<span id="an_36:7">36:7</span> How precious is thy loving-kindness, O
God! So the sons of men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings.

<span id="an_36:8">36:8</span> They shall be abundantly satisfied with
the fatness of thy house; and thou wilt make them drink of the river of
thy pleasures.

<span id="an_36:9">36:9</span> For with thee is the fountain of life: in
thy light shall we see light.

<span id="an_36:10">36:10</span> Continue thy loving-kindness unto them
that know thee, and thy righteousness to the upright in heart;

<span id="an_36:11">36:11</span> Let not the foot of pride come against
me, and let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.

<span id="an_36:12">36:12</span> There are the workers of iniquity
fallen: they are cast down, and are not able to rise.

<span id="an_37:1">37:1</span> {\[A Psalm\] of David.} Fret not thyself
because of evil-doers, and be not envious of them that work
unrighteousness;

<span id="an_37:2">37:2</span> for they shall soon be cut down like the
grass, and fade as the green herb.

<span id="an_37:3">37:3</span> Confide in Jehovah, and do good; dwell in
the land, and feed on faithfulness;

<span id="an_37:4">37:4</span> and delight thyself in Jehovah, and he
will give thee the desires of thy heart.

<span id="an_37:5">37:5</span> Commit thy way unto Jehovah, and rely
upon him: he will bring \[it\] to pass;

<span id="an_37:6">37:6</span> and he will bring forth thy righteousness
as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.

<span id="an_37:7">37:7</span> Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for
him: fret not thyself because of him that prospereth in his way, because
of the man that bringeth mischievous devices to pass.

<span id="an_37:8">37:8</span> Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; fret
not thyself: it \[would be\] only to do evil.

<span id="an_37:9">37:9</span> For evil-doers shall be cut off; but
those that wait on Jehovah, they shall possess the land.

<span id="an_37:10">37:10</span> For yet a little while, and the wicked
is not; and thou considerest his place, but he is not.

<span id="an_37:11">37:11</span> But the meek shall possess the land,
and shall delight themselves in the abundance of prosperity.

<span id="an_37:12">37:12</span> The wicked plotteth against the
righteous, and gnasheth his teeth against him.

<span id="an_37:13">37:13</span> The Lord laugheth at him; for he seeth
that his day is coming.

<span id="an_37:14">37:14</span> The wicked have drawn out the sword,
and have bent their bow, to cast down the afflicted and needy, to slay
those that are upright in \[the\] way:

<span id="an_37:15">37:15</span> their sword shall enter into their own
heart, and their bows shall be broken.

<span id="an_37:16">37:16</span> The little that the righteous hath is
better than the abundance of many wicked;

<span id="an_37:17">37:17</span> for the arms of the wicked shall be
broken, but Jehovah upholdeth the righteous.

<span id="an_37:18">37:18</span> Jehovah knoweth the days of the
perfect; and their inheritance shall be for ever:

<span id="an_37:19">37:19</span> they shall not be ashamed in the time
of evil, and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.

<span id="an_37:20">37:20</span> For the wicked shall perish, and the
enemies of Jehovah shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume,
like smoke shall they consume away.

<span id="an_37:21">37:21</span> The wicked borroweth, and payeth not
again; but the righteous is gracious and giveth:

<span id="an_37:22">37:22</span> for those blessed of him shall possess
the land, and they that are cursed of him shall be cut off.

<span id="an_37:23">37:23</span> The steps of a man are established by
Jehovah, and he delighteth in his way:

<span id="an_37:24">37:24</span> though he fall, he shall not be utterly
cast down, for Jehovah upholdeth his hand.

<span id="an_37:25">37:25</span> I have been young, and now am old, and
I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread:

<span id="an_37:26">37:26</span> all the day he is gracious and lendeth,
and his seed shall be a blessing.

<span id="an_37:27">37:27</span> Depart from evil, and do good, and
dwell for evermore;

<span id="an_37:28">37:28</span> for Jehovah loveth judgment, and will
not forsake his saints: They are preserved for ever; but the seed of the
wicked shall be cut off.

<span id="an_37:29">37:29</span> The righteous shall possess the land,
and dwell therein for ever.

<span id="an_37:30">37:30</span> The mouth of the righteous proffereth
wisdom, and his tongue speaketh judgment;

<span id="an_37:31">37:31</span> the law of his God is in his heart; his
goings shall not slide.

<span id="an_37:32">37:32</span> The wicked watcheth the righteous, and
seeketh to slay him:

<span id="an_37:33">37:33</span> Jehovah will not leave him in his hand,
nor condemn him when he is judged.

<span id="an_37:34">37:34</span> Wait for Jehovah, and keep his way, and
he will exalt thee to possess the land: when the wicked are cut off,
thou shalt see \[it\].

<span id="an_37:35">37:35</span> I have seen the wicked in great power,
and spreading like a green tree in its native soil:

<span id="an_37:36">37:36</span> but he passed away, and behold, he was
not; and I sought him, but he was not found.

<span id="an_37:37">37:37</span> Mark the perfect, and behold the
upright, for the end of \[that\] man is peace;

<span id="an_37:38">37:38</span> but the transgressors shall be
destroyed together; the future of the wicked shall be cut off.

<span id="an_37:39">37:39</span> But the salvation of the righteous is
of Jehovah: he is their strength in the time of trouble.

<span id="an_37:40">37:40</span> And Jehovah will help them and deliver
them: he will deliver them from the wicked, and save them; for they
trust in him.

<span id="an_38:1">38:1</span> {A Psalm of David, to bring to
remembrance.} Jehovah, rebuke me not in thy wrath; neither chasten me in
thy hot displeasure.

<span id="an_38:2">38:2</span> For thine arrows stick fast in me, and
thy hand cometh down upon me.

<span id="an_38:3">38:3</span> There is no soundness in my flesh because
of thine indignation; no peace in my bones, because of my sin.

<span id="an_38:4">38:4</span> For mine iniquities are gone over my
head: as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.

<span id="an_38:5">38:5</span> My wounds stink, they are corrupt,
because of my foolishness.

<span id="an_38:6">38:6</span> I am depressed; I am bowed down beyond
measure; I go mourning all the day.

<span id="an_38:7">38:7</span> For my loins are full of burning, and
there is no soundness in my flesh.

<span id="an_38:8">38:8</span> I am faint and broken beyond measure; I
roar by reason of the agitation of my heart.

<span id="an_38:9">38:9</span> Lord, all my desire is before thee, and
my sighing is not hid from thee.

<span id="an_38:10">38:10</span> My heart throbbeth, my strength hath
left me; and the light of mine eyes, it also is no more with me.

<span id="an_38:11">38:11</span> My lovers and mine associates stand
aloof from my stroke; and my kinsmen stand afar off.

<span id="an_38:12">38:12</span> And they that seek after my life lay
snares \[for me\]; and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things,
and meditate deceits all the day long.

<span id="an_38:13">38:13</span> But I, as a deaf \[man\], hear not; and
am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.

<span id="an_38:14">38:14</span> Yea, I am as a man that heareth not,
and in whose mouth are no reproofs.

<span id="an_38:15">38:15</span> For in thee, Jehovah, do I hope:
\*thou\* wilt answer, O Lord my God.

<span id="an_38:16">38:16</span> For I said, Let them not rejoice over
me! When my foot slipped, they magnified \[themselves\] against me.

<span id="an_38:17">38:17</span> For I am ready to halt, and my pain is
continually before me.

<span id="an_38:18">38:18</span> For I will declare mine iniquity, I am
grieved for my sin.

<span id="an_38:19">38:19</span> But mine enemies are lively, they are
strong; and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied:

<span id="an_38:20">38:20</span> And they that render evil for good are
adversaries unto me; because I pursue what is good.

<span id="an_38:21">38:21</span> Forsake me not, Jehovah; O my God, be
not far from me.

<span id="an_38:22">38:22</span> Make haste to help me, O Lord, my
salvation.

<span id="an_39:1">39:1</span> {To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun. A
Psalm of David.} I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not
with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a muzzle, while the wicked is
before me.

<span id="an_39:2">39:2</span> I was dumb with silence, I held my peace
from good; and my sorrow was stirred.

<span id="an_39:3">39:3</span> My heart burned within me; the fire was
kindled in my musing: I spoke with my tongue,

<span id="an_39:4">39:4</span> Make me to know, Jehovah, mine end, and
the measure of my days, what it is: I shall know how frail I am.

<span id="an_39:5">39:5</span> Behold, thou hast made my days \[as\]
hand-breadths, and my lifetime is as nothing before thee; verily, every
man, \[even\] the high placed, is altogether vanity. Selah.

<span id="an_39:6">39:6</span> Verily, man walketh in a vain show;
verily they are disquieted in vain; he heapeth up \[riches\], and
knoweth not who shall gather them.

<span id="an_39:7">39:7</span> And now, what wait I for, Lord? my hope
is in thee.

<span id="an_39:8">39:8</span> Deliver me from all my transgressions;
make me not the reproach of the foolish.

<span id="an_39:9">39:9</span> I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; for
\*thou\* hast done \[it\].

<span id="an_39:10">39:10</span> Remove thy stroke away from me: I am
consumed by the blow of thy hand.

<span id="an_39:11">39:11</span> When thou with rebukes dost correct a
man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth:
surely, every man is vanity. Selah.

<span id="an_39:12">39:12</span> Hear my prayer, Jehovah, and give ear
unto my cry; be not silent at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, a
sojourner, like all my fathers.

<span id="an_39:13">39:13</span> Look away from me, and let me recover
strength, before I go hence and be no more.

<span id="an_40:1">40:1</span> {To the chief Musician. Of David. A
Psalm.} I waited patiently for Jehovah; and he inclined unto me, and
heard my cry.

<span id="an_40:2">40:2</span> And he brought me up out of the pit of
destruction, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock; he hath
established my goings:

<span id="an_40:3">40:3</span> And he hath put a new song in my mouth,
praise unto our God. Many shall see it, and fear, and shall confide in
Jehovah.

<span id="an_40:4">40:4</span> Blessed is the man that hath made Jehovah
his confidence, and turneth not to the proud, and to such as turn aside
to lies.

<span id="an_40:5">40:5</span> Thou, O Jehovah my God, hast multiplied
thy marvellous works, and thy thoughts toward us: they cannot be
reckoned up in order unto thee; would I declare and speak \[them\], they
are more than can be numbered.

<span id="an_40:6">40:6</span> Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not
desire: ears hast thou prepared me. Burnt-offering and sin-offering hast
thou not demanded;

<span id="an_40:7">40:7</span> Then said I, Behold, I come, in the
volume of the book it is written of me --

<span id="an_40:8">40:8</span> To do thy good pleasure, my God, is my
delight, and thy law is within my heart.

<span id="an_40:9">40:9</span> I have published righteousness in the
great congregation: behold, I have not withheld my lips, Jehovah,
\*thou\* knowest.

<span id="an_40:10">40:10</span> I have not hidden thy righteousness
within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I
have not concealed thy loving-kindness and thy truth from the great
congregation.

<span id="an_40:11">40:11</span> Withhold not thou, Jehovah, thy tender
mercies from me; let thy loving-kindness and thy truth continually
preserve me.

<span id="an_40:12">40:12</span> For innumerable evils have compassed me
about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I cannot see;
they are more than the hairs of my head: and my heart hath failed me.

<span id="an_40:13">40:13</span> Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me;
Jehovah, make haste to my help.

<span id="an_40:14">40:14</span> Let them be ashamed and brought to
confusion together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be
turned backward and confounded that take pleasure in mine adversity;

<span id="an_40:15">40:15</span> Let them be desolate, because of their
shame, that say unto me, Aha! Aha!

<span id="an_40:16">40:16</span> Let all those that seek thee be glad
and rejoice in thee; let such as love thy salvation say continually,
Jehovah be magnified!

<span id="an_40:17">40:17</span> But I am afflicted and needy: the Lord
thinketh upon me. Thou art my help and my deliverer: my God, make no
delay.

<span id="an_41:1">41:1</span> {To the chief Musician. A Psalm of
David.} Blessed is he that understandeth the poor: Jehovah will deliver
him in the day of evil.

<span id="an_41:2">41:2</span> Jehovah will preserve him, and keep him
alive; he shall be made happy in the land; and thou wilt not deliver him
to the will of his enemies.

<span id="an_41:3">41:3</span> Jehovah will sustain him upon the bed of
languishing: thou turnest all his bed in his sickness.

<span id="an_41:4">41:4</span> As for me, I said, Jehovah, be gracious
unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.

<span id="an_41:5">41:5</span> Mine enemies wish me evil: When will he
die, and his name perish?

<span id="an_41:6">41:6</span> And if one come to see \[me\], he
speaketh falsehood; his heart gathereth wickedness to itself: he goeth
abroad, he telleth \[it\].

<span id="an_41:7">41:7</span> All that hate me whisper together against
me; against me do they devise my hurt.

<span id="an_41:8">41:8</span> A thing of Belial cleaveth fast unto him;
and now that he is laid down, he will rise up no more.

<span id="an_41:9">41:9</span> Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I
confided, who did eat of my bread, hath lifted up \[his\] heel against
me.

<span id="an_41:10">41:10</span> But thou, Jehovah, be gracious unto me,
and raise me up, that I may requite them.

<span id="an_41:11">41:11</span> By this I know that thou delightest in
me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.

<span id="an_41:12">41:12</span> But as for me, thou upholdest me in
mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.

<span id="an_41:13">41:13</span> Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel,
from eternity to eternity! Amen, and Amen.

<span id="an_42:1">42:1</span> {To the chief Musician. An instruction;
of the sons of Korah.} As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so
panteth my soul after thee, O God.

<span id="an_42:2">42:2</span> My soul thirsteth for God, for the living
ùGod: when shall I come and appear before God?

<span id="an_42:3">42:3</span> My tears have been my bread day and
night, while they say unto me all the day, Where is thy God?

<span id="an_42:4">42:4</span> These things I remember and have poured
out my soul within me: how I passed along with the multitude, how I went
on with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, a
festive multitude.

<span id="an_42:5">42:5</span> Why art thou cast down, my soul, and art
disquieted in me? hope in God; for I shall yet praise him, \[for\] the
health of his countenance.

<span id="an_42:6">42:6</span> My God, my soul is cast down within me;
therefore do I remember thee from the land of the Jordan, and the
Hermons, from mount Mizar.

<span id="an_42:7">42:7</span> Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of
thy cataracts; all thy breakers and thy billows are gone over me.

<span id="an_42:8">42:8</span> In the day-time will Jehovah command his
loving-kindness, and in the night his song shall be with me, a prayer
unto the ùGod of my life.

<span id="an_42:9">42:9</span> I will say unto ùGod my rock, Why hast
thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the
enemy?

<span id="an_42:10">42:10</span> As with a crushing in my bones mine
adversaries reproach me, while they say unto me all the day, Where is
thy God?

<span id="an_42:11">42:11</span> Why art thou cast down, my soul? and
why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God; for I shall yet praise
him, \[who is\] the health of my countenance, and my God.

<span id="an_43:1">43:1</span> Judge me, O God, and plead my cause
against an ungodly nation; deliver me from the deceitful and unrighteous
man.

<span id="an_43:2">43:2</span> For thou art the God of my strength: why
hast thou cast me off? why go I about mourning because of the oppression
of the enemy?

<span id="an_43:3">43:3</span> Send out thy light and thy truth:
\*they\* shall lead me, \*they\* shall bring me to thy holy mount, and
unto thy habitations.

<span id="an_43:4">43:4</span> Then will I go unto the altar of God,
unto the ùGod of the gladness of my joy: yea, upon the harp will I
praise thee, O God, my God.

<span id="an_43:5">43:5</span> Why art thou cast down, my soul? and why
art thou disquieted within me? hope in God; for I shall yet praise him,
\[who is\] the health of my countenance, and my God.

<span id="an_44:1">44:1</span> {To the chief Musician. Of the sons of
Korah. An instruction.} O God, with our ears have we heard, our fathers
have told us, the work thou wroughtest in their days, in the days of
old:

<span id="an_44:2">44:2</span> Thou, by thy hand, didst dispossess the
nations, but them thou didst plant; thou didst afflict the peoples, but
them didst thou cause to spread out.

<span id="an_44:3">44:3</span> For not by their own sword did they take
possession of the land, neither did their own arm save them; but thy
right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because
thou hadst delight in them.

<span id="an_44:4">44:4</span> Thou thyself art my king, O God: command
deliverance for Jacob.

<span id="an_44:5">44:5</span> Through thee will we push down our
adversaries; through thy name will we tread them under that rise up
against us.

<span id="an_44:6">44:6</span> For I will not put confidence in my bow,
neither shall my sword save me.

<span id="an_44:7">44:7</span> For thou hast saved us from our
adversaries, and hast put them to shame that hate us.

<span id="an_44:8">44:8</span> In God will we boast all the day, and we
will praise thy name for ever. Selah.

<span id="an_44:9">44:9</span> But thou hast cast off, and put us to
confusion, and dost not go forth with our armies;

<span id="an_44:10">44:10</span> Thou hast made us to turn back from the
adversary, and they that hate us spoil for themselves;

<span id="an_44:11">44:11</span> Thou hast given us over like sheep
\[appointed\] for meat, and hast scattered us among the nations;

<span id="an_44:12">44:12</span> Thou hast sold thy people for nought,
and hast not increased \[thy wealth\] by their price;

<span id="an_44:13">44:13</span> Thou makest us a reproach to our
neighbours, a mockery and a derision for them that are round about us;

<span id="an_44:14">44:14</span> Thou makest us a byword among the
nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.

<span id="an_44:15">44:15</span> All the day my confusion is before me,
and the shame of my face hath covered me,

<span id="an_44:16">44:16</span> Because of the voice of him that
reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and the avenger.

<span id="an_44:17">44:17</span> All this is come upon us; yet have we
not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely against thy covenant:

<span id="an_44:18">44:18</span> Our heart is not turned back, neither
have our steps declined from thy path;

<span id="an_44:19">44:19</span> Though thou hast crushed us in the
place of jackals, and covered us with the shadow of death.

<span id="an_44:20">44:20</span> If we had forgotten the name of our
God, and stretched out our hands to a strange ùgod,

<span id="an_44:21">44:21</span> Would not God search this out? for he
knoweth the secrets of the heart.

<span id="an_44:22">44:22</span> But for thy sake are we killed all the
day long; we are reckoned as sheep for slaughter.

<span id="an_44:23">44:23</span> Awake, why sleepest thou, Lord? arise,
cast \[us\] not off for ever.

<span id="an_44:24">44:24</span> Wherefore hidest thou thy face, \[and\]
forgettest our affliction and our oppression?

<span id="an_44:25">44:25</span> For our soul is bowed down to the dust;
our belly cleaveth unto the earth.

<span id="an_44:26">44:26</span> Rise up for our help, and redeem us for
thy loving-kindness' sake.

<span id="an_45:1">45:1</span> {To the chief Musician. Upon Shoshannim.
Of the sons of Korah. An instruction; -- a song of the Beloved.} My
heart is welling forth \[with\] a good matter: I say what I have
composed touching the king. My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.

<span id="an_45:2">45:2</span> Thou art fairer than the sons of men;
grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.

<span id="an_45:3">45:3</span> Gird thy sword upon \[thy\] thigh, O
mighty one, \[in\] thy majesty and thy splendour;

<span id="an_45:4">45:4</span> And \[in\] thy splendour ride
prosperously, because of truth and meekness \[and\] righteousness: and
thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.

<span id="an_45:5">45:5</span> Thine arrows are sharp -- peoples fall
under thee -- in the heart of the king's enemies.

<span id="an_45:6">45:6</span> Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever;
a sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of thy kingdom:

<span id="an_45:7">45:7</span> Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated
wickedness; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of
gladness above thy companions.

<span id="an_45:8">45:8</span> Myrrh and aloes, cassia, are all thy
garments; out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad.

<span id="an_45:9">45:9</span> Kings' daughters are among thine
honourable women; upon thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of
Ophir.

<span id="an_45:10">45:10</span> Hearken, daughter, and see, and incline
thine ear; and forget thine own people and thy father's house:

<span id="an_45:11">45:11</span> And the king will desire thy beauty;
for he is thy Lord, and worship thou him.

<span id="an_45:12">45:12</span> And the daughter of Tyre with a gift,
the rich ones among the people, shall court thy favour.

<span id="an_45:13">45:13</span> All glorious is the king's daughter
within; her clothing is of wrought gold:

<span id="an_45:14">45:14</span> She shall be brought unto the king in
raiment of embroidery; the virgins behind her, her companions, shall be
brought in unto thee:

<span id="an_45:15">45:15</span> With joy and gladness shall they be
brought; they shall enter into the king's palace.

<span id="an_45:16">45:16</span> Instead of thy fathers shall be thy
sons; princes shalt thou make them in all the earth.

<span id="an_45:17">45:17</span> I will make thy name to be remembered
throughout all generations; therefore shall the peoples praise thee for
ever and ever.

<span id="an_46:1">46:1</span> {To the chief Musician. Of the sons of

the seas;

<span id="an_46:3">46:3</span> Though the waters thereof roar \[and\]
foam, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.

<span id="an_46:4">46:4</span> There is a river the streams whereof make
glad the city of God, the sanctuary of the habitations of the Most High.

<span id="an_46:5">46:5</span> God is in the midst of her; she shall not
be moved: God shall help her at the dawn of the morning.

<span id="an_46:6">46:6</span> The nations raged, the kingdoms were
moved; he uttered his voice, the earth melted.

<span id="an_46:7">46:7</span> Jehovah of hosts is with us; the God of
Jacob is our high fortress. Selah.

<span id="an_46:8">46:8</span> Come, behold the works of Jehovah, what
desolations he hath made in the earth:

<span id="an_46:9">46:9</span> He hath made wars to cease unto the end
of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he
burneth the chariots in the fire.

<span id="an_46:10">46:10</span> Be still, and know that I am God: I
will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.

<span id="an_46:11">46:11</span> Jehovah of hosts is with us; the God of
Jacob is our high fortress. Selah.

<span id="an_47:1">47:1</span> {To the chief Musician. Of the sons of
Korah. A Psalm.} All ye peoples, clap your hands; shout unto God with
the voice of triumph!

<span id="an_47:2">47:2</span> For Jehovah, the Most High, is terrible,
a great king over all the earth.

<span id="an_47:3">47:3</span> He subdueth the peoples under us, and the
nations under our feet.

<span id="an_47:4">47:4</span> He hath chosen our inheritance for us,
the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.

<span id="an_47:5">47:5</span> God is gone up amid shouting, Jehovah
amid the sound of the trumpet.

<span id="an_47:6">47:6</span> Sing psalms of God, sing psalms; sing
psalms unto our King, sing psalms!

<span id="an_47:7">47:7</span> For God is the King of all the earth;
sing psalms with understanding.

<span id="an_47:8">47:8</span> God reigneth over the nations; God
sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.

<span id="an_47:9">47:9</span> The willing-hearted of the peoples have
gathered together, \[with\] the people of the God of Abraham. For unto
God \[belong\] the shields of the earth: he is greatly exalted.

<span id="an_48:1">48:1</span> {A Song; a Psalm. Of the sons of Korah.}
Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in
the hill of his holiness.

<span id="an_48:2">48:2</span> Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the
whole earth, is mount Zion, \[on\] the sides of the north, the city of
the great King.

<span id="an_48:3">48:3</span> God is known in her palaces as a high
fortress.

<span id="an_48:4">48:4</span> For behold, the kings assembled
themselves, they passed by together;

<span id="an_48:5">48:5</span> They saw, -- so they marvelled; they were
troubled, they fled in consternation:

<span id="an_48:6">48:6</span> Trembling took hold upon them there;
anguish, as of a woman in travail.

<span id="an_48:7">48:7</span> With an east wind thou hast broken the
ships of Tarshish.

<span id="an_48:8">48:8</span> As we have heard, so have we seen, in the
city of Jehovah of hosts, in the city of our God: God doth establish it
for ever. Selah.

<span id="an_48:9">48:9</span> We have thought, O God, of thy
loving-kindness, in the midst of thy temple.

<span id="an_48:10">48:10</span> According to thy name, O God, so is thy
praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of
righteousness.

<span id="an_48:11">48:11</span> Let mount Zion rejoice, let the
daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.

<span id="an_48:12">48:12</span> Walk about Zion, and go round about
her: count the towers thereof;

<span id="an_48:13">48:13</span> Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her
palaces: that ye may tell it to the generation following.

<span id="an_48:14">48:14</span> For this God is our God for ever and
ever; he will be our guide until death.

<span id="an_49:1">49:1</span> {To the chief Musician. Of the sons of
Korah. A Psalm.} Hear this, all ye peoples; give ear, all inhabitants of
the world:

<span id="an_49:2">49:2</span> Both men of low and men of high degree,
rich and poor alike.

<span id="an_49:3">49:3</span> My mouth shall speak wisdom, and the
meditation of my heart shall be of understanding:

<span id="an_49:4">49:4</span> I will incline mine ear to a parable, I
will open my riddle upon the harp.

<span id="an_49:5">49:5</span> Wherefore should I fear in the days of
adversity, \[when\] the iniquity of my supplanters encompasseth me? --

<span id="an_49:6">49:6</span> They depend upon their wealth, and boast
themselves in the abundance of their riches. ...

<span id="an_49:7">49:7</span> None can by any means redeem his brother,
nor give to God a ransom for him,

<span id="an_49:8">49:8</span> (For the redemption of their soul is
costly, and must be given up for ever,)

<span id="an_49:9">49:9</span> That he should still live perpetually,
\[and\] not see corruption.

<span id="an_49:10">49:10</span> For he seeth that wise men die; all
alike, the fool and the brutish perish, and they leave their wealth to
others.

<span id="an_49:11">49:11</span> Their inward thought is, that their
houses are for ever, their dwelling-places from generation to
generation: they call the lands after their own names.

<span id="an_49:12">49:12</span> Nevertheless, man being in honour
abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.

<span id="an_49:13">49:13</span> This their way is their folly, yet they
that come after them delight in their sayings. Selah.

<span id="an_49:14">49:14</span> Like sheep are they laid in Sheol:
Death feedeth on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in
the morning; and their comeliness shall be for Sheol to consume, that
there be no habitation for them.

<span id="an_49:15">49:15</span> But God will redeem my soul from the
power of Sheol: for he will receive me. Selah.

<span id="an_49:16">49:16</span> Be not afraid when a man becometh rich,
when the glory of his house is increased:

<span id="an_49:17">49:17</span> For when he dieth, he shall carry
nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him.

<span id="an_49:18">49:18</span> Though he blessed his soul in his
lifetime, -- and men will praise thee when thou doest well to thyself,
--

<span id="an_49:19">49:19</span> It shall go to the generation of his
fathers: they shall never see light.

<span id="an_49:20">49:20</span> Man that is in honour, and
understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.

<span id="an_50:1">50:1</span> {A Psalm. Of Asaph.} ùGod,
Elohim-Jehovah, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the
sun unto the going down thereof.

<span id="an_50:2">50:2</span> Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,
God hath shined forth.

<span id="an_50:3">50:3</span> Our God will come, and will not keep
silence: fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous
round about him.

<span id="an_50:4">50:4</span> He will call to the heavens from above,
and to the earth, that he may judge his people:

<span id="an_50:5">50:5</span> Gather unto me my godly ones, those that
have made a covenant with me by sacrifice!

<span id="an_50:6">50:6</span> And the heavens shall declare his
righteousness; for God executeth judgment himself. Selah.

<span id="an_50:7">50:7</span> Hear, my people, and I will speak; O
Israel, and I will testify unto thee: I am God, thy God.

<span id="an_50:8">50:8</span> I will not reprove thee for thy
sacrifices, or thy burnt-offerings, continually before me;

<span id="an_50:9">50:9</span> I will take no bullock out of thy house,
\[nor\] he-goats out of thy folds:

<span id="an_50:10">50:10</span> For every beast of the forest is mine,
the cattle upon a thousand hills;

<span id="an_50:11">50:11</span> I know all the fowl of the mountains,
and the roaming creatures of the field are mine:

<span id="an_50:12">50:12</span> If I were hungry, I would not tell
thee; for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.

<span id="an_50:13">50:13</span> Should I eat the flesh of bulls, and
drink the blood of goats?

<span id="an_50:14">50:14</span> Offer unto God thanksgiving, and
perform thy vows unto the Most High;

<span id="an_50:15">50:15</span> And call upon me in the day of trouble;
I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.

<span id="an_50:16">50:16</span> But unto the wicked God saith, What
hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my
covenant into thy mouth,

<span id="an_50:17">50:17</span> Seeing thou hast hated correction and
hast cast my words behind thee?

<span id="an_50:18">50:18</span> When thou sawest a thief, thou didst
take pleasure in him, and thy portion was with adulterers;

<span id="an_50:19">50:19</span> Thou lettest thy mouth loose to evil,
and thy tongue frameth deceit;

<span id="an_50:20">50:20</span> Thou sittest \[and\] speakest against
thy brother, thou revilest thine own mother's son:

<span id="an_50:21">50:21</span> These \[things\] hast thou done, and I
kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether as thyself: \[but\]
I will reprove thee, and set \[them\] in order before thine eyes.

<span id="an_50:22">50:22</span> Now consider this, ye that forget +God,
lest I tear in pieces, and there be no deliverer.

<span id="an_50:23">50:23</span> Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me;
and to him that ordereth \[his\] way will I shew the salvation of God.

<span id="an_51:1">51:1</span> {To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David;
when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to
Bath-sheba.} Be gracious unto me, O God, according to thy
loving-kindness; according to the abundance of thy tender mercies, blot
out my transgressions.

<span id="an_51:2">51:2</span> Wash me fully from mine iniquity, and
cleanse me from my sin.

<span id="an_51:3">51:3</span> For I acknowledge my transgressions, and
my sin is continually before me.

<span id="an_51:4">51:4</span> Against thee, thee only, have I sinned,
and done what is evil in thy sight; that thou mayest be justified when
thou speakest, be clear when thou judgest.

<span id="an_51:5">51:5</span> Behold, in iniquity was I brought forth,
and in sin did my mother conceive me.

<span id="an_51:6">51:6</span> Behold, thou wilt have truth in the
inward parts; and in the hidden \[part\] thou wilt make me to know
wisdom.

<span id="an_51:7">51:7</span> Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be
clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

<span id="an_51:8">51:8</span> Make me to hear gladness and joy;
\[that\] the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.

<span id="an_51:9">51:9</span> Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out
all mine iniquities.

<span id="an_51:10">51:10</span> Create in me a clean heart, O God, and
renew a steadfast spirit within me.

<span id="an_51:11">51:11</span> Cast me not away from thy presence, and
take not the spirit of thy holiness from me.

<span id="an_51:12">51:12</span> Restore unto me the joy of thy
salvation, and let a willing spirit sustain me.

<span id="an_51:13">51:13</span> I will teach transgressors thy ways,
and sinners shall return unto thee.

<span id="an_51:14">51:14</span> Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O
God, thou God of my salvation: my tongue shall sing aloud of thy
righteousness.

<span id="an_51:15">51:15</span> Lord, open my lips, and my mouth shall
declare thy praise.

<span id="an_51:16">51:16</span> For thou desirest not sacrifice; else
would I give it: thou hast no pleasure in burnt-offering.

<span id="an_51:17">51:17</span> The sacrifices of God are a broken
spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

<span id="an_51:18">51:18</span> Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion;
build the walls of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_51:19">51:19</span> Then shalt thou have sacrifices of
righteousness, burnt-offering, and whole burnt-offering; then shall they
offer up bullocks upon thine altar.

<span id="an_52:1">52:1</span> {To the chief Musician: an instruction.
Of David; when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him,
David came to the house of Ahimelech.} Why boastest thou thyself in
evil, thou mighty man? The loving-kindness of ùGod \[abideth\]
continually.

<span id="an_52:2">52:2</span> Thy tongue deviseth mischievous things,
like a sharp razor, practising deceit.

<span id="an_52:3">52:3</span> Thou hast loved evil rather than good,
lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.

<span id="an_52:4">52:4</span> Thou hast loved all devouring words, O
deceitful tongue!

<span id="an_52:5">52:5</span> ùGod shall likewise destroy thee for
ever; he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of \[thy\] tent, and
root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.

<span id="an_52:6">52:6</span> The righteous also shall see, and fear,
and shall laugh at him, \[saying,\]

<span id="an_52:7">52:7</span> Behold the man that made not God his
strength, but put confidence in the abundance of his riches, \[and\]
strengthened himself in his avarice.

<span id="an_52:8">52:8</span> But as for me, I am like a green
olive-tree in the house of God: I will confide in the loving-kindness of
God for ever and ever.

<span id="an_52:9">52:9</span> I will praise thee for ever, because thou
hast done \[it\]; and I will wait on thy name, before thy godly ones,
for it is good.

<span id="an_53:1">53:1</span> {To the chief Musician. On Mahalath: an
instruction. Of David.} The fool hath said in his heart, There is no
God! They have corrupted themselves, and have done abominable iniquity:
there is none that doeth good.

<span id="an_53:2">53:2</span> God looked down from the heavens upon the
children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did
seek God.

<span id="an_53:3">53:3</span> Every one of them is gone back, they are
together become corrupt: there is none that doeth good, not even one.

<span id="an_53:4">53:4</span> Have the workers of iniquity no
knowledge, eating up my people \[as\] they eat bread? they call not upon
God.

<span id="an_53:5">53:5</span> There were they in great fear, where no
fear was; for God scattereth the bones of him that encampeth against
thee. Thou hast put \[them\] to shame, for God hath despised them.

<span id="an_53:6">53:6</span> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come
out of Zion! When God turneth again the captivity of his people, Jacob
shall be glad, Israel shall rejoice.

<span id="an_54:1">54:1</span> {To the chief Musician. On stringed
instruments: an instruction. Of David; when the Ziphites came, and said
to Saul, Is not David hiding himself with us?} O God, by thy name save
me, and by thy strength do me justice.

<span id="an_54:2">54:2</span> O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the
words of my mouth.

<span id="an_54:3">54:3</span> For strangers are risen up against me,
and the violent seek after my life: they have not set God before them.
Selah.

<span id="an_54:4">54:4</span> Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is
among them that uphold my soul.

<span id="an_54:5">54:5</span> He will requite evil to mine enemies: in
thy truth cut them off.

<span id="an_54:6">54:6</span> I will freely sacrifice unto thee; I will
praise thy name, O Jehovah, because it is good.

<span id="an_54:7">54:7</span> For he hath delivered me out of all
trouble; and mine eye hath seen \[its desire\] upon mine enemies.

<span id="an_55:1">55:1</span> {To the chief Musician. On stringed
instruments: an instruction. Of David.} Give ear to my prayer, O God;
and hide not thyself from my supplication.

<span id="an_55:2">55:2</span> Attend unto me, and answer me: I wander
about in my plaint, and I moan aloud,

<span id="an_55:3">55:3</span> Because of the voice of the enemy;
because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me,
and in anger they persecute me.

<span id="an_55:4">55:4</span> My heart is writhing within me, and the
terrors of death are fallen upon me.

<span id="an_55:5">55:5</span> Fear and trembling are come upon me, and
horror hath overwhelmed me.

<span id="an_55:6">55:6</span> And I said, Oh that I had wings like a
dove! I would fly away, and be at rest;

<span id="an_55:7">55:7</span> Behold, I would flee afar off, I would
lodge in the wilderness; Selah;

<span id="an_55:8">55:8</span> I would hasten my escape from the stormy
wind, from the tempest.

<span id="an_55:9">55:9</span> Swallow \[them\] up, Lord; divide their
tongue: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.

<span id="an_55:10">55:10</span> Day and night they go about it upon the
walls thereof; and iniquity and mischief are in the midst of it.

<span id="an_55:11">55:11</span> Perversities are in the midst thereof;
and oppression and deceit depart not from its streets.

<span id="an_55:12">55:12</span> For it is not an enemy that hath
reproached me -- then could I have borne it; neither is it he that
hateth me that hath magnified \[himself\] against me -- then would I
have hidden myself from him;

<span id="an_55:13">55:13</span> But it was thou, a man mine equal, mine
intimate, my familiar friend. ...

<span id="an_55:14">55:14</span> We who held sweet intercourse together.
To the house of God we walked amid the throng.

<span id="an_55:15">55:15</span> Let death seize upon them, let them go
down alive into Sheol. For wickedness is in their dwellings, in their
midst.

<span id="an_55:16">55:16</span> As for me, unto God will I call; and
Jehovah will save me.

<span id="an_55:17">55:17</span> Evening, and morning, and at noon, will
I pray and moan aloud; and he will hear my voice.

<span id="an_55:18">55:18</span> He hath redeemed my soul in peace from
the battle against me: for there were many about me.

<span id="an_55:19">55:19</span> ùGod will hear, and afflict them: he
that is seated of old, (Selah) ... because there is no change in them,
and they fear not God.

<span id="an_55:20">55:20</span> He hath put forth his hands against
such as are at peace with him; he hath profaned his covenant.

<span id="an_55:21">55:21</span> Smooth were the milky \[words\] of his
mouth, but his heart was war; his words were softer than oil, yet are
they drawn swords.

<span id="an_55:22">55:22</span> Cast thy burden upon Jehovah, and
\*he\* will sustain thee: he will never suffer the righteous to be
moved.

<span id="an_55:23">55:23</span> And thou, O God, wilt bring them down
into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out
half their days. But as for me, I will confide in thee.

<span id="an_56:1">56:1</span> {To the chief Musician. On
Jonathelem-rechokim. Of David. Michtam; when the Philistines took him in
Gath.} Be gracious unto me, O God; for man would swallow me up: all the
day long fighting he oppresseth me.

<span id="an_56:2">56:2</span> Mine enemies would swallow \[me\] up all
the day long; for they are many that fight against me haughtily.

<span id="an_56:3">56:3</span> In the day that I am afraid, I will
confide in thee.

<span id="an_56:4">56:4</span> In God will I praise his word, in God I
put my confidence: I will not fear; what can flesh do unto me?

<span id="an_56:5">56:5</span> All the day long they wrest my words; all
their thoughts are against me for evil.

<span id="an_56:6">56:6</span> They gather themselves together, they
hide themselves; they mark my steps, because they wait for my soul.

<span id="an_56:7">56:7</span> Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger
cast down the peoples, O God.

<span id="an_56:8">56:8</span> \*Thou\* countest my wanderings; put my
tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?

<span id="an_56:9">56:9</span> Then shall mine enemies return backward
in the day when I call: this I know, for God is for me.

<span id="an_56:10">56:10</span> In God will I praise \[his\] word; in
Jehovah will I praise \[his\] word.

<span id="an_56:11">56:11</span> In God have I put my confidence: I will
not fear; what can man do unto me?

<span id="an_56:12">56:12</span> Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will
render thanks unto thee.

<span id="an_56:13">56:13</span> For thou hast delivered my soul from
death; \[wilt thou\] not \[keep\] my feet from falling, that I may walk
before God in the light of the living?

<span id="an_57:1">57:1</span> {To the chief Musician. 'Destroy not.' Of
David. Michtam; when he fled from Saul in the cave.} Be gracious unto
me, O God, be gracious unto me; for my soul taketh refuge in thee: yea,
in the shadow of thy wings do I take refuge, until the calamities be
overpast.

<span id="an_57:2">57:2</span> I will call unto God, the Most High; unto
ùGod that performeth \[all\] for me.

<span id="an_57:3">57:3</span> He will send from the heavens and save
me; he hath covered with reproach him that would swallow me up. Selah.
God hath sent forth his loving-kindness and his truth.

<span id="an_57:4">57:4</span> My soul is in the midst of lions; I lie
down \[among\] them that breathe out flames, the sons of men, whose
teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

<span id="an_57:5">57:5</span> Be exalted above the heavens, O God; let
thy glory be above all the earth!

<span id="an_57:6">57:6</span> They have prepared a net for my steps; my
soul was bowed down: they have digged a pit before me; they are fallen
into the midst thereof. Selah.

<span id="an_57:7">57:7</span> My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is
fixed: I will sing, yea, I will sing psalms.

<span id="an_57:8">57:8</span> Awake, my glory; awake, lute and harp: I
will wake the dawn.

<span id="an_57:9">57:9</span> I will give thee thanks among the
peoples, O Lord; of thee will I sing psalms among the nations:

<span id="an_57:10">57:10</span> For thy loving-kindness is great unto
the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.

<span id="an_57:11">57:11</span> Be exalted above the heavens, O God;
let thy glory be above all the earth!

<span id="an_58:1">58:1</span> {To the chief Musician. 'Destroy not.' Of
David. Michtam.} Is righteousness indeed silent? Do ye speak it? Do ye
judge with equity, ye sons of men?

<span id="an_58:2">58:2</span> Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye
weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth.

<span id="an_58:3">58:3</span> The wicked go astray from the womb; they
err as soon as they are born, speaking lies.

<span id="an_58:4">58:4</span> Their poison is like the poison of a
serpent: \[they are\] like the deaf adder which stoppeth her ear;

<span id="an_58:5">58:5</span> Which doth not hearken to the voice of

<span id="an_58:6">58:6</span> O God, break their teeth in their mouth;
break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Jehovah.

<span id="an_58:7">58:7</span> Let them melt away as waters that flow
off; when he aimeth his arrows, let them be as blunted:

<span id="an_58:8">58:8</span> Let them be as a snail that melteth as it
passeth away; \[like\] the untimely birth of a woman, let them not see
the sun.

<span id="an_58:9">58:9</span> Before your pots feel the thorns, green
or burning, -- they shall be whirled away.

<span id="an_58:10">58:10</span> The righteous shall rejoice when he
seeth the vengeance; he shall wash his footsteps in the blood of the
wicked:

<span id="an_58:11">58:11</span> And men shall say, Verily there is
fruit for the righteous; verily there is a God that judgeth in the
earth.

<span id="an_59:1">59:1</span> {To the chief Musician. 'Destroy not.' Of
David. Michtam; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.}
Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God; secure me on high from them that
rise up against me.

<span id="an_59:2">59:2</span> Deliver me from the workers of iniquity,
and save me from men of blood.

<span id="an_59:3">59:3</span> For behold, they lie in wait for my soul;
strong ones are gathered against me: not for my transgression, nor for
my sin, O Jehovah.

<span id="an_59:4">59:4</span> They run and prepare themselves without
\[my\] fault: awake to meet me, and behold.

<span id="an_59:5">59:5</span> Yea, do thou, Jehovah, the God of hosts,
the God of Israel, arise to visit all the nations: be not gracious to
any plotters of iniquity. Selah.

<span id="an_59:6">59:6</span> They return in the evening; they howl
like a dog, and go round about the city:

<span id="an_59:7">59:7</span> Behold, they belch out with their mouth;
swords are in their lips: for who \[say they\] doth hear?

<span id="an_59:8">59:8</span> But thou, Jehovah, wilt laugh at them;
thou wilt have all the nations in derision.

<span id="an_59:9">59:9</span> Their strength! ... I will take heed to
thee; for God is my high fortress.

<span id="an_59:10">59:10</span> God, whose loving-kindness will come to
meet me, -- God shall let me see \[my desire\] upon mine enemies.

<span id="an_59:11">59:11</span> Slay them not, lest my people forget;
by thy power make them wander, and bring them down, O Lord, our shield.

<span id="an_59:12">59:12</span> \[Because of\] the sin of their mouth,
the word of their lips, let them even be taken in their pride; and
because of cursing and lying which they speak.

<span id="an_59:13">59:13</span> Make an end in wrath, make an end, that
they may be no more; that they may know that God ruleth in Jacob, unto
the ends of the earth. Selah.

<span id="an_59:14">59:14</span> And in the evening they shall return,
they shall howl like a dog, and go round about the city.

<span id="an_59:15">59:15</span> They shall wander about for meat, and
stay all night if they be not satisfied.

<span id="an_59:16">59:16</span> But as for me, I will sing of thy
strength; yea, I will sing aloud of thy loving-kindness in the morning;
for thou hast been to me a high fortress, and a refuge in the day of my
trouble.

<span id="an_59:17">59:17</span> Unto thee, my strength, will I sing
psalms; for God is my high fortress, the God of my mercy.

<span id="an_60:1">60:1</span> {To the chief Musician. On Shushan.
Testimony. Michtam of David; to teach: when he strove with the Syrians
of Mesopotamia, and the Syrians of Zobah, and Joab returned, and smote

cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased: restore
us again.

<span id="an_60:2">60:2</span> Thou hast made the earth to tremble, thou
hast rent it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.

<span id="an_60:3">60:3</span> Thou hast shewn thy people hard things;
thou hast made us to drink the wine of bewilderment.

<span id="an_60:4">60:4</span> Thou hast given a banner to them that
fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth, (Selah,)

<span id="an_60:5">60:5</span> That thy beloved ones may be delivered.
Save with thy right hand, and answer me.

<span id="an_60:6">60:6</span> God hath spoken in his holiness: I will
exult, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

<span id="an_60:7">60:7</span> Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine, and
Ephraim is the strength of my head; Judah is my law-giver;

cast my sandal; Philistia, shout aloud because of me.

<span id="an_60:9">60:9</span> Who will bring me into the strong city?
who will lead me unto Edom?

<span id="an_60:10">60:10</span> \[Wilt\] not thou, O God, who didst
cast us off? and didst not go forth, O God, with our armies?

<span id="an_60:11">60:11</span> Give us help from trouble; for vain is
man's deliverance.

<span id="an_60:12">60:12</span> Through God we shall do valiantly; and
he it is that will tread down our adversaries.

unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: thou wilt lead me on to a rock
which is too high for me.

<span id="an_61:3">61:3</span> For thou hast been a refuge for me, a
strong tower from before the enemy.

<span id="an_61:4">61:4</span> I will sojourn in thy tent for ever; I
will take refuge in the covert of thy wings. Selah.

<span id="an_61:5">61:5</span> For thou, O God, hast heard my vows; thou
hast given \[me\] the inheritance of those that fear thy name.

<span id="an_61:6">61:6</span> Thou wilt add days to the days of the
king: his years shall be as many generations.

<span id="an_61:7">61:7</span> He shall abide before God for ever:
bestow loving-kindness and truth, that they may preserve him.

high fortress: I shall not be greatly moved.

<span id="an_62:3">62:3</span> How long will ye assail a man; will ye
\[seek\], all of you, to break him down as a bowing wall or a tottering
fence?

<span id="an_62:4">62:4</span> They only consult to thrust \[him\] down
from his excellency; they delight in lies; they bless with their mouth,
but in their inward part they curse. Selah.

<span id="an_62:5">62:5</span> Upon God alone, O my soul, rest
peacefully; for my expectation is from him.

<span id="an_62:6">62:6</span> He only is my rock and my salvation; my

the rock of my strength, my refuge is in God.

pour out your heart before him: God is our refuge. Selah.

<span id="an_62:9">62:9</span> Men of low degree are only vanity; men of
high degree, a lie: laid in the balance, they go up together \[lighter\]

beheld thee in the sanctuary;

<span id="an_63:3">63:3</span> For thy loving-kindness is better than

<span id="an_63:4">63:4</span> So will I bless thee while I live; I will
lift up my hands in thy name.

<span id="an_63:5">63:5</span> My soul is satisfied as with marrow and
fatness, and my mouth shall praise \[thee\] with joyful lips.

<span id="an_63:6">63:6</span> When I remember thee upon my bed, I
meditate on thee in the night-watches:

<span id="an_64:1">64:1</span> {To the chief Musician. A Psalm of
David.} Hear, O God, my voice in my plaint; preserve my life from fear

<span id="an_64:2">64:2</span> Hide me from the secret counsel of
evil-doers, from the tumultuous crowd of the workers of iniquity,

<span id="an_64:3">64:3</span> Who have sharpened their tongue like a
sword, \[and\] have aimed their arrow, a bitter word;

<span id="an_64:4">64:4</span> That they may shoot in secret at the
perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.

<span id="an_64:5">64:5</span> They encourage themselves in an evil
matter, they concert to hide snares; they say, Who will see them?

<span id="an_64:6">64:6</span> They devise iniquities: We have it ready,
the plan is diligently sought out. And each one's inward \[thought\] and
heart is deep.

<span id="an_64:7">64:7</span> But God will shoot an arrow at them:
suddenly are they wounded;

<span id="an_64:8">64:8</span> By their own tongue they are made to fall
over one another: all that see them shall flee away.

<span id="an_64:9">64:9</span> And all men shall fear, and shall declare
God's doing; and they shall wisely consider his work.

<span id="an_64:10">64:10</span> The righteous shall rejoice in Jehovah,

causest to approach: he shall dwell in thy courts. We shall be satisfied
with the goodness of thy house, of thy holy temple.

raging of their waves, and the tumult of the peoples.

<span id="an_65:8">65:8</span> And they that dwell in the uttermost
parts are afraid at thy tokens; thou makest the outgoings of the morning
and evening to rejoice.

<span id="an_65:9">65:9</span> Thou hast visited the earth, thou hast
watered it; thou greatly enrichest it: the river of God is full of
water; thou providest their corn, when thou hast so prepared it:

<span id="an_65:10">65:10</span> Thou dost satiate its furrows, thou
smoothest its clods, thou makest it soft with showers; thou blessest the
springing thereof.

<span id="an_65:11">65:11</span> Thou crownest the year with thy
goodness, and thy paths drop fatness:

<span id="an_65:12">65:12</span> They drop upon the pastures of the
wilderness, and the hills are girded with gladness.

<span id="an_65:13">65:13</span> The meadows are clothed with flocks,
and the valleys are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, yea,
they sing.

<span id="an_66:1">66:1</span> {To the chief Musician. A Song: a Psalm.}

unto thee.

terrible in \[his\] doings toward the children of men.

went through the river on foot: there did we rejoice in him.

<span id="an_66:9">66:9</span> Who hath set our soul in life, and
suffereth not our feet to be moved.

hast tried us, as silver is tried.

didst lay a heavy burden upon our loins;

<span id="an_66:12">66:12</span> Thou didst cause men to ride over our
head; we went through fire and through water: but thou hast brought us
out into abundance.

<span id="an_66:13">66:13</span> I will go into thy house with
burnt-offerings; I will perform my vows to thee,

mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.

<span id="an_66:15">66:15</span> I will offer up unto thee
burnt-offerings of fatted beasts, with the incense of rams; I will offer
bullocks with goats. Selah.

<span id="an_66:16">66:16</span> Come, hear, all ye that fear God, and I
will declare what he hath done for my soul.

<span id="an_66:17">66:17</span> I called unto him with my mouth, and he
was extolled with my tongue.

<span id="an_66:18">66:18</span> Had I regarded iniquity in my heart,

dropped at the presence of God, yon Sinai, at the presence of God, the
God of Israel.

me, neither let the deep swallow me up; and let not the pit shut its
mouth upon me.

<span id="an_69:16">69:16</span> Answer me, O Jehovah; for thy
loving-kindness is good: according to the abundance of thy tender
mercies, turn toward me;

<span id="an_69:17">69:17</span> And hide not thy face from thy servant,
for I am in trouble: answer me speedily.

<span id="an_69:18">69:18</span> Draw nigh unto my soul, be its
redeemer; ransom me because of mine enemies.

<span id="an_69:19">69:19</span> \*Thou\* knowest my reproach, and my
shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.

<span id="an_69:20">69:20</span> Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am
overwhelmed: and I looked for sympathy, but there was none; and for
comforters, but I found none.

<span id="an_69:21">69:21</span> Yea, they gave me gall for my food, and
in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.

<span id="an_69:22">69:22</span> Let their table become a snare before
them, and their very welfare a trap;

<span id="an_69:23">69:23</span> Let their eyes be darkened, that they
see not, and make their loins continually to shake.

<span id="an_69:24">69:24</span> Pour out thine indignation upon them,
and let the fierceness of thine anger take hold of them.

<span id="an_69:25">69:25</span> Let their habitation be desolate; let
there be no dweller in their tents.

<span id="an_69:26">69:26</span> For they persecute him whom \*thou\*
hast smitten, and they talk for the sorrow of those whom thou hast
wounded.

<span id="an_69:27">69:27</span> Add iniquity unto their iniquity, and
let them not come into thy righteousness.

<span id="an_69:28">69:28</span> Let them be blotted out of the book of
life, and not be written with the righteous.

<span id="an_69:29">69:29</span> But I am afflicted and sorrowful: let
thy salvation, O God, set me secure on high.

<span id="an_69:30">69:30</span> I will praise the name of God with a
song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving;

<span id="an_69:31">69:31</span> And it shall please Jehovah more than
an ox, -- a bullock with horns and cloven hoofs.

<span id="an_69:32">69:32</span> The meek shall see it, they shall be
glad; ye that seek God, your heart shall live.

<span id="an_69:33">69:33</span> For Jehovah heareth the needy, and
despiseth not his prisoners.

<span id="an_69:34">69:34</span> Let heavens and earth praise him; the
seas, and everything that moveth therein.

<span id="an_69:35">69:35</span> For God will save Zion, and will build
the cities of Judah; and they shall dwell there, and possess it:

<span id="an_69:36">69:36</span> And the seed of his servants shall
inherit it, and they that love his name shall dwell therein.

<span id="an_70:1">70:1</span> {To the chief Musician. \[A Psalm\] of
David: to bring to remembrance.} Make haste, O God, to deliver me;
Jehovah, \[hasten\] to my help.

<span id="an_70:2">70:2</span> Let them be ashamed and brought to
confusion that seek after my soul; let them be turned backward and
confounded that take pleasure in mine adversity;

<span id="an_70:3">70:3</span> Let them turn back because of their shame
that say, Aha! Aha!

<span id="an_70:4">70:4</span> Let all those that seek thee be glad and
rejoice in thee, and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let
God be magnified!

<span id="an_70:5">70:5</span> But I am afflicted and needy: make haste
unto me, O God. Thou art my help and my deliverer: O Jehovah, make no
delay.

<span id="an_71:1">71:1</span> In thee, Jehovah, do I trust: let me
never be ashamed.

<span id="an_71:2">71:2</span> Deliver me in thy righteousness, and
rescue me; incline thine ear unto me, and save me.

<span id="an_71:3">71:3</span> Be to me a rock of habitation, whereunto
I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for
thou art my rock and my fortress.

<span id="an_71:4">71:4</span> My God, rescue me out of the hand of the
wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

<span id="an_71:5">71:5</span> For thou art my hope, O Lord Jehovah, my
confidence from my youth.

<span id="an_71:6">71:6</span> On thee have I been stayed from the womb;
from the bowels of my mother thou didst draw me forth: my praise shall
be continually of thee.

<span id="an_71:7">71:7</span> I have been as a wonder unto many; but
thou art my strong refuge.

<span id="an_71:8">71:8</span> My mouth shall be filled with thy praise,
with thy glory, all the day.

<span id="an_71:9">71:9</span> Cast me not off in the time of old age;
forsake me not when my strength faileth.

<span id="an_71:10">71:10</span> For mine enemies speak against me, and
they that watch for my soul consult together,

<span id="an_71:11">71:11</span> Saying, God hath forsaken him; pursue
and seize him, for there is none to deliver.

<span id="an_71:12">71:12</span> O God, be not far from me; my God,
hasten to my help.

<span id="an_71:13">71:13</span> Let them be ashamed, let them be
consumed, that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with
reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.

<span id="an_71:14">71:14</span> But as for me, I will hope continually,
and will praise thee yet more and more.

<span id="an_71:15">71:15</span> My mouth shall declare thy
righteousness, \[and\] thy salvation all the day: for I know not the
numbers \[thereof\].

<span id="an_71:16">71:16</span> I will go in the might of the Lord
Jehovah; I will recall thy righteousness, thine alone.

<span id="an_71:17">71:17</span> O God, thou hast taught me from my
youth, and hitherto have I proclaimed thy marvellous works:

<span id="an_71:18">71:18</span> Now also, when I am old and greyheaded,
O God, forsake me not, until I have proclaimed thine arm unto \[this\]
generation, thy might to every one that is to come.

<span id="an_71:19">71:19</span> And thy righteousness, O God, reacheth
on high, thou who hast done great things: O God, who is like unto thee?

<span id="an_71:20">71:20</span> Thou, who hast shewn us many and sore
troubles, wilt revive us again, and wilt bring us up again from the
depths of the earth;

<span id="an_71:21">71:21</span> Thou wilt increase my greatness, and
comfort me on every side.

<span id="an_71:22">71:22</span> I will also praise thee with the
psaltery, even thy truth, my God; unto thee will I sing psalms with the
harp, thou holy One of Israel.

<span id="an_71:23">71:23</span> My lips shall exult when I sing psalms
unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.

<span id="an_71:24">71:24</span> My tongue also shall talk of thy
righteousness all the day; for they shall be ashamed, for they shall be
brought to confusion, that seek my hurt.

<span id="an_72:1">72:1</span> {For Solomon.} O God, give the king thy
judgments, and thy righteousness unto the king's son.

<span id="an_72:2">72:2</span> He will judge thy people with
righteousness, and thine afflicted with judgment.

<span id="an_72:3">72:3</span> The mountains shall bring peace to the
people, and the hills, by righteousness.

<span id="an_72:4">72:4</span> He will do justice to the afflicted of
the people; he will save the children of the needy, and will break in
pieces the oppressor.

<span id="an_72:5">72:5</span> They shall fear thee as long as sun and
moon endure, from generation to generation.

<span id="an_72:6">72:6</span> He shall come down like rain on the mown
grass, as showers that water the earth.

<span id="an_72:7">72:7</span> In his days shall the righteous flourish,
and abundance of peace till the moon be no more.

<span id="an_72:8">72:8</span> And he shall have dominion from sea to
sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.

<span id="an_72:9">72:9</span> The dwellers in the desert shall bow
before him, and his enemies shall lick the dust.

<span id="an_72:10">72:10</span> The kings of Tarshish and of the isles
shall render presents; the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer tribute:

<span id="an_72:11">72:11</span> Yea, all kings shall bow down before
him; all nations shall serve him.

<span id="an_72:12">72:12</span> For he will deliver the needy who
crieth, and the afflicted, who hath no helper;

<span id="an_72:13">72:13</span> He will have compassion on the poor and
needy, and will save the souls of the needy:

<span id="an_72:14">72:14</span> He will redeem their souls from
oppression and violence, and precious shall their blood be in his sight.

<span id="an_72:15">72:15</span> And he shall live; and to him shall be
given of the gold of Sheba; and prayer shall be made for him
continually: all the day shall he be blessed.

<span id="an_72:16">72:16</span> There shall be abundance of corn in the
earth, upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like
Lebanon; and they of the city shall bloom like the herb of the earth.

<span id="an_72:17">72:17</span> His name shall endure for ever; his
name shall be continued as long as the sun: and \[men\] shall bless
themselves in him; all nations shall call him blessed.

<span id="an_72:18">72:18</span> Blessed be Jehovah Elohim, the God of
Israel, who alone doeth wondrous things!

<span id="an_72:19">72:19</span> And blessed be his glorious name for
ever! and let the whole earth be filled with his glory! Amen, and Amen.

<span id="an_72:20">72:20</span> The prayers of David the son of Jesse
are ended.

<span id="an_73:1">73:1</span> {A Psalm of Asaph.} Truly God is good to
Israel, to such as are of a pure heart.

<span id="an_73:2">73:2</span> But as for me, my feet were almost gone,
my steps had well nigh slipped;

<span id="an_73:3">73:3</span> For I was envious at the arrogant, seeing
the prosperity of the wicked.

<span id="an_73:4">73:4</span> For they have no pangs in their death,
and their body is well nourished;

<span id="an_73:5">73:5</span> They have not the hardships of mankind,
neither are they plagued like \[other\] men:

<span id="an_73:6">73:6</span> Therefore pride encompasseth them as a
neck-chain, violence covereth them \[as\] a garment;

<span id="an_73:7">73:7</span> Their eyes stand out from fatness, they
exceed the imaginations of their heart:

<span id="an_73:8">73:8</span> They mock and speak wickedly of
oppression, they speak loftily:

<span id="an_73:9">73:9</span> They set their mouth in the heavens, and
their tongue walketh through the earth.

<span id="an_73:10">73:10</span> Therefore his people turn hither, and
waters in fulness are wrung out to them.

<span id="an_73:11">73:11</span> And they say, How can ùGod know, and is
there knowledge in the Most High?

<span id="an_73:12">73:12</span> Behold, these are the wicked, and they
prosper in the world: they heap up riches.

<span id="an_73:13">73:13</span> Truly have I purified my heart in vain,
and washed my hands in innocency:

<span id="an_73:14">73:14</span> For all the day have I been plagued,
and chastened every morning.

<span id="an_73:15">73:15</span> If I said, I will speak thus, behold, I
should be faithless to the generation of thy children.

<span id="an_73:16">73:16</span> When I thought to be able to know this,
it was a grievous task in mine eyes;

<span id="an_73:17">73:17</span> Until I went into the sanctuaries of
ùGod; \[then\] understood I their end.

<span id="an_73:18">73:18</span> Truly thou settest them in slippery
places, thou castest them down in ruins.

<span id="an_73:19">73:19</span> How are they suddenly made desolate!
they pass away, consumed with terrors.

<span id="an_73:20">73:20</span> As a dream, when one awaketh, wilt
thou, Lord, on arising despise their image.

<span id="an_73:21">73:21</span> When my heart was in a ferment, and I
was pricked in my reins,

<span id="an_73:22">73:22</span> Then I was brutish and knew nothing; I
was \[as\] a beast with thee.

<span id="an_73:23">73:23</span> Nevertheless I am continually with
thee: thou hast holden my right hand;

<span id="an_73:24">73:24</span> Thou wilt guide me by thy counsel, and
after the glory, thou wilt receive me.

<span id="an_73:25">73:25</span> Whom have I in the heavens? and there
is none upon earth I desire beside thee.

<span id="an_73:26">73:26</span> My flesh and my heart faileth: God is
the rock of my heart and my portion for ever.

<span id="an_73:27">73:27</span> For behold, they that are far from thee
shall perish; thou destroyest every one that goeth a whoring from thee.

<span id="an_73:28">73:28</span> But as for me, it is good for me to
draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord Jehovah, that I may
declare all thy works.

<span id="an_74:1">74:1</span> {An instruction: of Asaph.} Why, O God,
hast thou cast off for ever? \[why\] doth thine anger smoke against the
sheep of thy pasture?

<span id="an_74:2">74:2</span> Remember thine assembly, which thou hast
purchased of old, which thou hast redeemed \[to be\] the portion of
thine inheritance, this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.

<span id="an_74:3">74:3</span> Lift up thy steps unto the perpetual
desolations: everything in the sanctuary hath the enemy destroyed.

<span id="an_74:4">74:4</span> Thine adversaries roar in the midst of
thy place of assembly; they set up their signs \[for\] signs.

<span id="an_74:5">74:5</span> \[A man\] was known as he could lift up
axes in the thicket of trees;

<span id="an_74:6">74:6</span> And now they break down its carved work
altogether, with hatchets and hammers.

<span id="an_74:7">74:7</span> They have set on fire thy sanctuary, they
have profaned the habitation of thy name to the ground.

<span id="an_74:8">74:8</span> They said in their heart, Let us destroy
them together: they have burned up all ùGod's places of assembly in the
land.

<span id="an_74:9">74:9</span> We see not our signs; there is no more
any prophet, neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.

<span id="an_74:10">74:10</span> How long, O God, shall the adversary
reproach? Shall the enemy contemn thy name for ever?

<span id="an_74:11">74:11</span> Why withdrawest thou thy hand, and thy
right hand? \[pluck it\] out of thy bosom: consume \[them\].

<span id="an_74:12">74:12</span> But God is my king of old,
accomplishing deliverances in the midst of the earth.

<span id="an_74:13">74:13</span> \*Thou\* didst divide the sea by thy
strength; thou didst break the heads of the monsters on the waters:

<span id="an_74:14">74:14</span> \*Thou\* didst break in pieces the
heads of leviathan, thou gavest him to be meat to those that people the
desert.

<span id="an_74:15">74:15</span> \*Thou\* didst cleave fountain and
torrent, \*thou\* driedst up ever-flowing rivers.

<span id="an_74:16">74:16</span> The day is thine, the night also is
thine; \*thou\* hast prepared the moon and the sun:

<span id="an_74:17">74:17</span> \*Thou\* hast set all the borders of
the earth; summer and winter -- \*thou\* didst form them.

<span id="an_74:18">74:18</span> Remember this, that an enemy hath
reproached Jehovah, and a foolish people have contemned thy name.

<span id="an_74:19">74:19</span> Give not up the soul of thy turtle-dove
unto the wild beast; forget not the troop of thine afflicted for ever.

<span id="an_74:20">74:20</span> Have respect unto the covenant; for the
dark places of the earth are full of the dwellings of violence.

<span id="an_74:21">74:21</span> Oh let not the oppressed one return
ashamed; let the afflicted and needy praise thy name.

<span id="an_74:22">74:22</span> Rise up, O God, plead thine own cause:
remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee all the day;

<span id="an_74:23">74:23</span> Forget not the voice of thine
adversaries: the tumult of those that rise up against thee ascendeth
continually.

<span id="an_75:1">75:1</span> {To the chief Musician. 'Destroy not.' A
Psalm of Asaph: a Song.} Unto thee we give thanks, O God, we give
thanks; and thy name is near: thy marvellous works declare it.

<span id="an_75:2">75:2</span> When I shall receive the assembly, I will
judge with equity.

<span id="an_75:3">75:3</span> The earth and all the inhabitants thereof
are dissolved: I have established its pillars. Selah.

<span id="an_75:4">75:4</span> I said unto the boastful, Boast not; and
to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:

<span id="an_75:5">75:5</span> Lift not up your horn on high; speak not
arrogantly with a \[stiff\] neck.

<span id="an_75:6">75:6</span> For not from the east nor from the west,
nor yet from the south doth exaltation \[come\]:

<span id="an_75:7">75:7</span> For God is the judge; he putteth down one
and exalteth another.

<span id="an_75:8">75:8</span> For in the hand of Jehovah there is a
cup, and it foameth with wine, it is full of mixture; and he poureth out
of the same; yea, the dregs thereof shall all the wicked of the earth
drain off, \[and\] drink.

<span id="an_75:9">75:9</span> But as for me, I will declare for ever; I
will sing psalms to the God of Jacob.

<span id="an_75:10">75:10</span> And all the horns of the wicked will I
cut off; \[but\] the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.

<span id="an_76:1">76:1</span> {To the chief Musician. On stringed
instruments. A Psalm of Asaph: a Song.} In Judah is God known, his name
is great in Israel;

<span id="an_76:2">76:2</span> And in Salem is his tent, and his
dwelling-place in Zion.

<span id="an_76:3">76:3</span> There broke he the flashings of the bow,
shield and sword and battle. Selah.

<span id="an_76:4">76:4</span> More glorious art thou, more excellent,
than the mountains of prey.

<span id="an_76:5">76:5</span> The stout-hearted are made a spoil, they
have slept their sleep; and none of the men of might have found their
hands.

<span id="an_76:6">76:6</span> At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both
chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.

<span id="an_76:7">76:7</span> Thou, thou art to be feared, and who can
stand before thee when once thou art angry?

<span id="an_76:8">76:8</span> Thou didst cause judgment to be heard
from the heavens; the earth feared, and was still,

<span id="an_76:9">76:9</span> When God rose up to judgment, to save all
the meek of the earth. Selah.

<span id="an_76:10">76:10</span> For the fury of man shall praise thee;
the remainder of fury wilt thou gird on thyself.

<span id="an_76:11">76:11</span> Vow and pay unto Jehovah your God: let
all that are round about him bring presents unto him that is to be
feared.

<span id="an_76:12">76:12</span> He cutteth off the spirit of princes;
\[he\] is terrible to the kings of the earth.

<span id="an_77:1">77:1</span> {To the chief Musician. On Jeduthun. Of
Asaph. A Psalm.} My voice is unto God, and I will cry; my voice is unto
God, and he will give ear unto me.

<span id="an_77:2">77:2</span> In the day of my trouble, I sought the
Lord: my hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not; my soul
refused to be comforted.

<span id="an_77:3">77:3</span> I remembered God, and I moaned; I
complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.

<span id="an_77:4">77:4</span> Thou holdest open mine eyelids; I am full
of disquiet and cannot speak.

<span id="an_77:5">77:5</span> I consider the days of old, the years of
ancient times.

<span id="an_77:6">77:6</span> I remember my song in the night; I muse
in mine own heart, and my spirit maketh diligent search.

<span id="an_77:7">77:7</span> Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will
he be favourable no more?

<span id="an_77:8">77:8</span> Hath his loving-kindness ceased for ever?
hath \[his\] word come to an end from generation to generation?

<span id="an_77:9">77:9</span> Hath ùGod forgotten to be gracious? or
hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.

<span id="an_77:10">77:10</span> Then said I, This is my weakness: --
the years of the right hand of the Most High

<span id="an_77:11">77:11</span> Will I remember, -- the works of Jah;
for I will remember thy wonders of old,

<span id="an_77:12">77:12</span> And I will meditate upon all thy work,
and muse upon thy doings.

<span id="an_77:13">77:13</span> O God, thy way is in the sanctuary: who
is so great a ùgod as God?

<span id="an_77:14">77:14</span> Thou art the ùGod that doest wonders;
thou hast declared thy strength among the peoples.

<span id="an_77:15">77:15</span> Thou hast with \[thine\] arm redeemed
thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.

<span id="an_77:16">77:16</span> The waters saw thee, O God, the waters
saw thee; they trembled, yea, the depths were troubled:

<span id="an_77:17">77:17</span> The thick clouds poured out water; the
skies sent out a sound, yea, thine arrows went abroad:

<span id="an_77:18">77:18</span> The voice of thy thunder was in the
whirlwind, lightnings lit up the world; the earth was troubled and it
quaked.

<span id="an_77:19">77:19</span> Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths
are in the great waters; and thy footsteps are not known.

<span id="an_77:20">77:20</span> Thou leddest thy people like a flock by
the hand of Moses and Aaron.

<span id="an_78:1">78:1</span> {An instruction. Of Asaph.} Give ear, O
my people, to my law; incline your ears to the words of my mouth.

<span id="an_78:2">78:2</span> I will open my mouth in a parable; I will
utter riddles from of old,

<span id="an_78:3">78:3</span> Which we have heard and known, and our
fathers have told us:

<span id="an_78:4">78:4</span> We will not hide \[them\] from their
sons, shewing forth to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah,
and his strength, and his marvellous works which he hath done.

<span id="an_78:5">78:5</span> For he established a testimony in Jacob,
and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they
should make them known to their children;

<span id="an_78:6">78:6</span> That the generation to come might know
\[them\], the children that should be born; that they might rise up and
tell \[them\] to their children,

<span id="an_78:7">78:7</span> And that they might set their hope in
God, and not forget the works of ùGod, but observe his commandments;

<span id="an_78:8">78:8</span> And might not be as their fathers, a
stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that prepared not their
heart, and whose spirit was not stedfast with ùGod.

<span id="an_78:9">78:9</span> The sons of Ephraim, armed bowmen, turned
back in the day of battle.

<span id="an_78:10">78:10</span> They kept not the covenant of God, and
refused to walk in his law;

<span id="an_78:11">78:11</span> And forgot his doings, and his
marvellous works which he had shewn them.

<span id="an_78:12">78:12</span> In the sight of their fathers had he
done wonders, in the land of Egypt, the field of Zoan.

<span id="an_78:13">78:13</span> He clave the sea, and caused them to
pass through; and made the waters to stand as a heap;

<span id="an_78:14">78:14</span> And he led them with a cloud in the
daytime, and all the night with the light of fire.

<span id="an_78:15">78:15</span> He clave rocks in the wilderness, and
gave \[them\] drink as out of the depths, abundantly;

<span id="an_78:16">78:16</span> And he brought streams out of the rock,
and caused waters to run down like rivers.

<span id="an_78:17">78:17</span> Yet they still went on sinning against
him, provoking the Most High in the desert;

<span id="an_78:18">78:18</span> And they tempted ùGod in their heart,
by asking meat for their lust;

<span id="an_78:19">78:19</span> And they spoke against God: they said,
Is ùGod able to prepare a table in the wilderness?

<span id="an_78:20">78:20</span> Behold, he smote the rock, and waters
gushed out, and streams overflowed; is he able to give bread also, or
provide flesh for his people?

<span id="an_78:21">78:21</span> Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth;
and fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also went up against
Israel:

<span id="an_78:22">78:22</span> Because they believed not in God, and
confided not in his salvation;

<span id="an_78:23">78:23</span> Though he had commanded the clouds from
above, and had opened the doors of the heavens,

<span id="an_78:24">78:24</span> And had rained down manna upon them to
eat, and had given them the corn of the heavens.

<span id="an_78:25">78:25</span> Man did eat the bread of the mighty; he
sent them provision to the full.

<span id="an_78:26">78:26</span> He caused the east wind to rise in the
heavens, and by his strength he brought the south wind;

<span id="an_78:27">78:27</span> And he rained flesh upon them as dust,
and feathered fowl as the sand of the seas,

<span id="an_78:28">78:28</span> And he let it fall in the midst of
their camp, round about their habitations:

<span id="an_78:29">78:29</span> And they did eat, and were well filled;
for that they lusted after, he brought to them.

<span id="an_78:30">78:30</span> They were not alienated from their
lust, their meat was yet in their mouths,

<span id="an_78:31">78:31</span> When the anger of God went up against
them; and he slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of
Israel.

<span id="an_78:32">78:32</span> For all this, they sinned still, and
believed not in his marvellous works;

<span id="an_78:33">78:33</span> And he consumed their days in vanity,
and their years in terror.

<span id="an_78:34">78:34</span> When he slew them, then they sought
him, and returned and sought early after ùGod;

<span id="an_78:35">78:35</span> And they remembered that God was their
rock, and ùGod, the Most High, their redeemer.

<span id="an_78:36">78:36</span> But they flattered him with their
mouth, and lied unto him with their tongue;

<span id="an_78:37">78:37</span> For their heart was not firm toward
him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.

<span id="an_78:38">78:38</span> But he was merciful: he forgave the
iniquity, and destroyed \[them\] not; but many a time turned he his
anger away, and did not stir up all his fury:

<span id="an_78:39">78:39</span> And he remembered that they were flesh,
a breath that passeth away and cometh not again.

<span id="an_78:40">78:40</span> How oft did they provoke him in the
wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!

<span id="an_78:41">78:41</span> And they turned again and tempted ùGod,
and grieved the Holy One of Israel.

<span id="an_78:42">78:42</span> They remembered not his hand, the day
when he delivered them from the oppressor,

<span id="an_78:43">78:43</span> How he set his signs in Egypt, and his
miracles in the field of Zoan;

<span id="an_78:44">78:44</span> And turned their rivers into blood, and
their streams, that they could not drink;

<span id="an_78:45">78:45</span> He sent dog-flies among them, which
devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them;

<span id="an_78:46">78:46</span> And he gave their increase unto the
caterpillar, and their labour unto the locust;

<span id="an_78:47">78:47</span> He killed their vines with hail, and
their sycamore trees with hail-stones;

<span id="an_78:48">78:48</span> And he delivered up their cattle to the
hail, and their flocks to thunderbolts.

<span id="an_78:49">78:49</span> He cast upon them the fierceness of his
anger, wrath, and indignation, and distress, -- a mission of angels of
woes.

<span id="an_78:50">78:50</span> He made a way for his anger; he spared
not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;

<span id="an_78:51">78:51</span> And he smote all the firstborn in
Egypt, the first-fruits of their vigour in the tents of Ham.

<span id="an_78:52">78:52</span> And he made his own people to go forth
like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock;

<span id="an_78:53">78:53</span> And he led them safely, so that they
were without fear; and the sea covered their enemies.

<span id="an_78:54">78:54</span> And he brought them to his holy border,
this mountain, which his right hand purchased;

<span id="an_78:55">78:55</span> And he drove out the nations before
them, and allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes
of Israel to dwell in their tents.

<span id="an_78:56">78:56</span> But they tempted and provoked God, the
Most High, and kept not his testimonies,

<span id="an_78:57">78:57</span> And they drew back and dealt
treacherously like their fathers: they turned like a deceitful bow.

<span id="an_78:58">78:58</span> And they provoked him to anger with
their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.

<span id="an_78:59">78:59</span> God heard, and was wroth, and greatly
abhorred Israel:

<span id="an_78:60">78:60</span> And he forsook the tabernacle at
Shiloh, the tent where he had dwelt among men,

<span id="an_78:61">78:61</span> And gave his strength into captivity,
and his glory into the hand of the oppressor;

<span id="an_78:62">78:62</span> And delivered up his people unto the
sword, and was very wroth with his inheritance:

<span id="an_78:63">78:63</span> The fire consumed their young men, and
their maidens were not praised in \[nuptial\] song;

<span id="an_78:64">78:64</span> Their priests fell by the sword, and
their widows made no lamentation.

<span id="an_78:65">78:65</span> Then the Lord awoke as one out of
sleep, like a mighty man that shouteth aloud by reason of wine;

<span id="an_78:66">78:66</span> And he smote his adversaries in the
hinder part, and put them to everlasting reproach.

<span id="an_78:67">78:67</span> And he rejected the tent of Joseph, and
chose not the tribe of Ephraim,

<span id="an_78:68">78:68</span> But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount
Zion which he loved;

<span id="an_78:69">78:69</span> And he built his sanctuary like the
heights, like the earth which he hath founded for ever.

<span id="an_78:70">78:70</span> And he chose David his servant, and
took him from the sheepfolds:

<span id="an_78:71">78:71</span> From following the suckling-ewes, he
brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.

<span id="an_78:72">78:72</span> And he fed them according to the
integrity of his heart, and led them by the skilfulness of his hands.

<span id="an_79:1">79:1</span> {A Psalm of Asaph.} O God, the nations
are come into thine inheritance: thy holy temple have they defiled; they
have laid Jerusalem in heaps.

<span id="an_79:2">79:2</span> The dead bodies of thy servants have they
given to be meat unto the fowl of the heavens, the flesh of thy saints
unto the beasts of the earth:

<span id="an_79:3">79:3</span> Their blood have they shed like water
round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury \[them\].

<span id="an_79:4">79:4</span> We are become a reproach to our
neighbours, a mockery and a derision to them that are round about us.

<span id="an_79:5">79:5</span> How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou be angry
for ever? Shall thy jealousy burn like fire?

<span id="an_79:6">79:6</span> Pour out thy fury upon the nations that
have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name:

<span id="an_79:7">79:7</span> For they have devoured Jacob, and laid
waste his habitation.

<span id="an_79:8">79:8</span> Remember not against us the iniquities of
\[our\] forefathers; let thy tender mercies speedily come to meet us:
for we are brought very low.

<span id="an_79:9">79:9</span> Help us, O God of our salvation, because
of the glory of thy name; and deliver us, and forgive our sins, for thy
name's sake.

<span id="an_79:10">79:10</span> Wherefore should the nations say, Where
is their God? Let the avenging of the blood of thy servants that is shed
be known among the nations in our sight.

<span id="an_79:11">79:11</span> Let the groaning of the prisoner come
before thee; according to the greatness of thine arm, preserve those
that are appointed to die;

<span id="an_79:12">79:12</span> And render unto our neighbours,
sevenfold into their bosom, their reproach, wherewith they have
reproached thee, O Lord.

<span id="an_79:13">79:13</span> And we, thy people and the sheep of thy
pasture, will give thanks unto thee for ever; we will shew forth thy
praise from generation to generation.

<span id="an_80:1">80:1</span> {To the chief Musician. On
Shoshannim-Eduth. Of Asaph. A Psalm.} Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,
thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that sittest \[between\] the
cherubim, shine forth.

<span id="an_80:2">80:2</span> Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh,
stir up thy strength, and come to our deliverance.

<span id="an_80:3">80:3</span> O God, restore us; and cause thy face to
shine, and we shall be saved.

<span id="an_80:4">80:4</span> Jehovah, God of hosts, how long will
thine anger smoke against the prayer of thy people?

<span id="an_80:5">80:5</span> Thou hast fed them with the bread of
tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure:

<span id="an_80:6">80:6</span> Thou hast made us a strife unto our
neighbours, and our enemies mock among themselves.

<span id="an_80:7">80:7</span> Restore us, O God of hosts; and cause thy
face to shine, and we shall be saved.

<span id="an_80:8">80:8</span> Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt; thou
didst cast out the nations, and plant it:

<span id="an_80:9">80:9</span> Thou preparedst space before it, and it
took deep root, and filled the land;

<span id="an_80:10">80:10</span> The mountains were covered with its
shadow, and the branches thereof were \[like\] cedars of ùGod;

<span id="an_80:11">80:11</span> It sent out its boughs unto the sea,
and its shoots unto the river.

<span id="an_80:12">80:12</span> Why hast thou broken down its fences,
so that all who pass by the way do pluck it?

<span id="an_80:13">80:13</span> The boar out of the forest doth waste
it, and the beast of the field doth feed off it.

<span id="an_80:14">80:14</span> O God of hosts, return, we beseech
thee; look down from the heavens, and behold, and visit this vine;

<span id="an_80:15">80:15</span> Even the stock which thy right hand
hath planted, and the young plant thou madest strong for thyself.

<span id="an_80:16">80:16</span> It is burned with fire, it is cut down;
they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.

<span id="an_80:17">80:17</span> Let thy hand be upon the man of thy
right hand, upon the son of man whom thou hast made strong for thyself.

<span id="an_80:18">80:18</span> So will we not go back from thee.
Revive us, and we will call upon thy name.

<span id="an_80:19">80:19</span> Restore us, O Jehovah, God of hosts;
cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.

<span id="an_81:1">81:1</span> {To the chief Musician. Upon the Gittith.
\[A Psalm\] of Asaph.} Sing ye joyously unto God our strength, shout
aloud unto the God of Jacob;

<span id="an_81:2">81:2</span> Raise a song, and sound the tambour, the
pleasant harp with the lute.

<span id="an_81:3">81:3</span> Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the
set time, on our feast day:

<span id="an_81:4">81:4</span> For this is a statute for Israel, an
ordinance of the God of Jacob;

<span id="an_81:5">81:5</span> He ordained it in Joseph \[for\] a
testimony, when he went forth over the land of Egypt, \[where\] I heard
a language that I knew not.

<span id="an_81:6">81:6</span> I removed his shoulder from the burden;
his hands were freed from the basket.

<span id="an_81:7">81:7</span> Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered
thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at
the waters of Meribah. Selah.

<span id="an_81:8">81:8</span> Hear, my people, and I will testify unto
thee; O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto me!

<span id="an_81:9">81:9</span> There shall no strange ùgod be in thee,
neither shalt thou worship any foreign ùgod.

<span id="an_81:10">81:10</span> I am Jehovah thy God, that brought thee
up out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.

<span id="an_81:11">81:11</span> But my people hearkened not to my
voice, and Israel would none of me.

<span id="an_81:12">81:12</span> So I gave them up unto their own
hearts' stubbornness: they walked after their own counsels.

<span id="an_81:13">81:13</span> Oh that my people had hearkened unto
me, that Israel had walked in my ways!

<span id="an_81:14">81:14</span> I would soon have subdued their
enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.

<span id="an_81:15">81:15</span> The haters of Jehovah would have come
cringing unto him; but their time would have been for ever.

<span id="an_81:16">81:16</span> And he would have fed them with the
finest of wheat; yea, with honey out of the rock would I have satisfied
thee.

<span id="an_82:1">82:1</span> {A Psalm of Asaph.} God standeth in the
assembly of ùGod, he judgeth among the gods.

<span id="an_82:2">82:2</span> How long will ye judge unrighteously, and
accept the person of the wicked? Selah.

<span id="an_82:3">82:3</span> Judge the poor and the fatherless, do
justice to the afflicted and the destitute;

<span id="an_82:4">82:4</span> Rescue the poor and needy, deliver them
out of the hand of the wicked.

<span id="an_82:5">82:5</span> They know not, neither do they
understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth
are moved.

<span id="an_82:6">82:6</span> I have said, Ye are gods, and all of you
are children of the Most High;

<span id="an_82:7">82:7</span> But ye shall die like men, and fall like
one of the princes.

<span id="an_82:8">82:8</span> Arise, O God, judge the earth; for
\*thou\* shalt inherit all the nations.

<span id="an_83:1">83:1</span> {A Song; a Psalm of Asaph.} O God, keep
not silence; hold not thy peace, and be not still, O ùGod:

<span id="an_83:2">83:2</span> For behold, thine enemies make a tumult;
and they that hate thee lift up the head.

<span id="an_83:3">83:3</span> They take crafty counsel against thy
people, and consult against thy hidden ones:

<span id="an_83:4">83:4</span> They say, Come, and let us cut them off
from being a nation, and let the name of Israel be mentioned no more.

<span id="an_83:5">83:5</span> For they have consulted together with one
heart: they have made an alliance together against thee.

<span id="an_83:6">83:6</span> The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
Moab and the Hagarites;

<span id="an_83:7">83:7</span> Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia,
with the inhabitants of Tyre;

<span id="an_83:8">83:8</span> Asshur also is joined with them: they are
an arm to the sons of Lot. Selah.

<span id="an_83:9">83:9</span> Do unto them as to Midian; as to Sisera,
as to Jabin, at the torrent of Kishon:

<span id="an_83:10">83:10</span> Who were destroyed at Endor; they
became as dung for the ground.

<span id="an_83:11">83:11</span> Make their nobles as Oreb and as Zeeb;
and all their chiefs as Zebah and as Zalmunna.

<span id="an_83:12">83:12</span> For they have said, Let us take to
ourselves God's dwelling-places in possession.

<span id="an_83:13">83:13</span> O my God, make them like a whirling
thing, like stubble before the wind.

<span id="an_83:14">83:14</span> As fire burneth a forest, and as the
flame setteth the mountains on fire,

<span id="an_83:15">83:15</span> So pursue them with thy tempest, and
terrify them with thy whirlwind.

<span id="an_83:16">83:16</span> Fill their faces with shame, that they
may seek thy name, O Jehovah.

<span id="an_83:17">83:17</span> Let them be put to shame and be
dismayed for ever, and let them be confounded and perish:

<span id="an_83:18">83:18</span> That they may know that thou alone,
whose name is Jehovah, art the Most High over all the earth.

<span id="an_84:1">84:1</span> {To the chief Musician. Upon the Gittith.
Of the sons of Korah. A Psalm.} How amiable are thy tabernacles, O
Jehovah of hosts!

<span id="an_84:2">84:2</span> My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for
the courts of Jehovah; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living
ùGod.

<span id="an_84:3">84:3</span> Yea, the sparrow hath found a house, and
the swallow a nest for herself, where she layeth her young, thine
altars, O Jehovah of hosts, my King and my God.

<span id="an_84:4">84:4</span> Blessed are they that dwell in thy house:
they will be constantly praising thee. Selah.

<span id="an_84:5">84:5</span> Blessed is the man whose strength is in
thee, -- they, in whose heart are the highways.

<span id="an_84:6">84:6</span> Passing through the valley of Baca, they
make it a well-spring; yea, the early rain covereth it with blessings.

<span id="an_84:7">84:7</span> They go from strength to strength: \[each
one\] will appear before God in Zion.

<span id="an_84:8">84:8</span> Jehovah, God of hosts, hear my prayer;
give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.

<span id="an_84:9">84:9</span> Behold, O God our shield, and look upon
the face of thine anointed.

<span id="an_84:10">84:10</span> For a day in thy courts is better than
a thousand. I had rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God,
than dwell in the tents of wickedness.

<span id="an_84:11">84:11</span> For Jehovah Elohim is a sun and shield:
Jehovah will give grace and glory; no good thing will he withhold from
them that walk uprightly.

<span id="an_84:12">84:12</span> Jehovah of hosts, blessed is the man
that confideth in thee!

<span id="an_85:1">85:1</span> {To the chief Musician. Of the sons of
Korah. A Psalm.} Thou hast been favourable, Jehovah, unto thy land; thou
hast turned the captivity of Jacob:

<span id="an_85:2">85:2</span> Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy
people; thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.

<span id="an_85:3">85:3</span> Thou hast withdrawn all thy wrath; thou
hast turned from the fierceness of thine anger.

<span id="an_85:4">85:4</span> Bring us back, O God of our salvation,
and cause thine indignation toward us to cease.

<span id="an_85:5">85:5</span> Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt
thou draw out thine anger from generation to generation?

<span id="an_85:6">85:6</span> Wilt thou not revive us again, that thy
people may rejoice in thee?

<span id="an_85:7">85:7</span> Shew us thy loving-kindness, O Jehovah,
and grant us thy salvation.

<span id="an_85:8">85:8</span> I will hear what ùGod, Jehovah, will
speak; for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his godly ones:
but let them not turn again to folly.

<span id="an_85:9">85:9</span> Surely his salvation is nigh them that
fear him, that glory may dwell in our land.

<span id="an_85:10">85:10</span> Loving-kindness and truth are met
together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other:

<span id="an_85:11">85:11</span> Truth shall spring out of the earth,
and righteousness shall look down from the heavens.

<span id="an_85:12">85:12</span> Jehovah also will give what is good,
and our land shall yield its increase.

<span id="an_85:13">85:13</span> Righteousness shall go before him, and
shall set his footsteps on the way.

<span id="an_86:1">86:1</span> {A Prayer of David.} Incline thine ear,
Jehovah, answer me; for I am afflicted and needy.

<span id="an_86:2">86:2</span> Keep my soul, for I am godly; O thou my
God, save thy servant who confideth in thee.

<span id="an_86:3">86:3</span> Be gracious unto me, O Lord; for unto
thee do I call all the day.

<span id="an_86:4">86:4</span> Rejoice the soul of thy servant; for unto
thee, Lord, do I lift up my soul.

<span id="an_86:5">86:5</span> For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to
forgive, and art of great loving-kindness unto all that call upon thee.

<span id="an_86:6">86:6</span> Give ear, O Jehovah, unto my prayer, and
attend to the voice of my supplications.

<span id="an_86:7">86:7</span> In the day of my distress I will call
upon thee, for thou wilt answer me.

<span id="an_86:8">86:8</span> Among the gods there is none like unto
thee, Lord, and there is nothing like unto thy works.

<span id="an_86:9">86:9</span> All nations whom thou hast made shall
come and worship before thee, O Lord, and shall glorify thy name.

<span id="an_86:10">86:10</span> For thou art great, and doest wondrous
things: thou art God, thou alone.

<span id="an_86:11">86:11</span> Teach me thy way, Jehovah; I will walk
in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.

<span id="an_86:12">86:12</span> I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with
my whole heart; and I will glorify thy name for evermore.

<span id="an_86:13">86:13</span> For great is thy loving-kindness toward
me, and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.

<span id="an_86:14">86:14</span> O God, the proud are risen against me,
and the assembly of the violent seek after my soul, and they have not
set thee before them.

<span id="an_86:15">86:15</span> But thou, Lord, art a ùGod merciful and
gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in goodness and truth.

<span id="an_86:16">86:16</span> Turn toward me, and be gracious unto
me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine
handmaid.

<span id="an_86:17">86:17</span> Shew me a token for good, that they
which hate me may see it, and be ashamed; for thou, Jehovah, hast helped
me and comforted me.

<span id="an_87:1">87:1</span> {Of the sons of Korah. A Psalm. A Song.}
His foundation is in the mountains of holiness.

<span id="an_87:2">87:2</span> Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion more
than all the habitations of Jacob.

<span id="an_87:3">87:3</span> Glorious things are spoken of thee, O
city of God. Selah.

<span id="an_87:4">87:4</span> I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon
among them that know me; behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia: this
\[man\] was born there.

<span id="an_87:5">87:5</span> And of Zion it shall be said, This one
and that one was born in her; and the Most High himself shall establish
her.

<span id="an_87:6">87:6</span> Jehovah will count, when he inscribeth
the peoples, This \[man\] was born there. Selah.

<span id="an_87:7">87:7</span> As well the singers as the dancers
\[shall say\], All my springs are in thee.

<span id="an_88:1">88:1</span> {A Song, a Psalm for the sons of Korah.
To the chief Musician. Upon Mahalath Leannoth. An instruction. Of Heman
the Ezrahite.} Jehovah, God of my salvation, I have cried by day \[and\]
in the night before thee.

<span id="an_88:2">88:2</span> Let my prayer come before thee; incline
thine ear unto my cry.

<span id="an_88:3">88:3</span> For my soul is full of troubles, and my
life draweth nigh to Sheol.

<span id="an_88:4">88:4</span> I am reckoned with them that go down into
the pit; I am as a man that hath no strength:

<span id="an_88:5">88:5</span> Prostrate among the dead, like the slain
that lie in the grave; whom thou rememberest no more, and who are cut
off from thy hand.

<span id="an_88:6">88:6</span> Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in
dark places, in the deeps.

<span id="an_88:7">88:7</span> Thy fury lieth hard upon me, and thou
hast afflicted \[me\] with all thy waves. Selah.

<span id="an_88:8">88:8</span> Thou hast put my familiar friends far
from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I
cannot come forth.

<span id="an_88:9">88:9</span> Mine eye consumeth by reason of
affliction. Upon thee, Jehovah, have I called every day; I have
stretched out my hands unto thee.

<span id="an_88:10">88:10</span> Wilt thou do wonders to the dead? shall
the shades arise and praise thee? Selah.

<span id="an_88:11">88:11</span> Shall thy loving-kindness be declared
in the grave? thy faithfulness in Destruction?

<span id="an_88:12">88:12</span> Shall thy wonders be known in the dark?
and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

<span id="an_88:13">88:13</span> But as for me, Jehovah, I cry unto
thee, and in the morning my prayer cometh before thee.

<span id="an_88:14">88:14</span> Why, O Jehovah, castest thou off my
soul? \[why\] hidest thou thy face from me?

<span id="an_88:15">88:15</span> I am afflicted and expiring from my
youth up; I suffer thy terrors, \[and\] I am distracted.

<span id="an_88:16">88:16</span> Thy fierce anger hath gone over me; thy
terrors have brought me to nought:

<span id="an_88:17">88:17</span> They have surrounded me all the day
like water; they have compassed me about together.

<span id="an_88:18">88:18</span> Lover and associate hast thou put far
from me: my familiar friends are darkness.

<span id="an_89:1">89:1</span> {An instruction. Of Ethan the Ezrahite.}
I will sing of the loving-kindness of Jehovah for ever; with my mouth
will I make known thy faithfulness from generation to generation.

<span id="an_89:2">89:2</span> For I said, Loving-kindness shall be
built up for ever; in the very heavens wilt thou establish thy
faithfulness.

<span id="an_89:3">89:3</span> I have made a covenant with mine elect, I
have sworn unto David my servant:

<span id="an_89:4">89:4</span> Thy seed will I establish for ever, and
build up thy throne from generation to generation. Selah.

<span id="an_89:5">89:5</span> And the heavens shall celebrate thy
wonders, O Jehovah, and thy faithfulness in the congregation of the
saints.

<span id="an_89:6">89:6</span> For who in the heaven can be compared to
Jehovah? \[who\] among the sons of the mighty shall be likened to
Jehovah?

<span id="an_89:7">89:7</span> ùGod is greatly to be feared in the
council of the saints, and terrible for all that are round about him.

<span id="an_89:8">89:8</span> Jehovah, God of hosts, who is like unto
thee, the strong Jah? And thy faithfulness is round about thee.

<span id="an_89:9">89:9</span> \*Thou\* rulest the pride of the sea:
when its waves arise, \*thou\* stillest them.

<span id="an_89:10">89:10</span> Thou hast crushed Rahab as one that is
slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with the arm of thy strength.

<span id="an_89:11">89:11</span> Thine are the heavens, the earth also
is thine; the world and its fulness, \*thou\* hast founded them.

<span id="an_89:12">89:12</span> The north and the south, \*thou\* hast
created them: Tabor and Hermon triumph in thy name.

<span id="an_89:13">89:13</span> Thine is the arm of might: strong is
thy hand, high is thy right hand.

<span id="an_89:14">89:14</span> Righteousness and judgment are the
foundation of thy throne; loving-kindness and truth go before thy face.

<span id="an_89:15">89:15</span> Blessed is the people that know the
shout of joy: they walk, O Jehovah, in the light of thy countenance.

<span id="an_89:16">89:16</span> In thy name are they joyful all the
day, and in thy righteousness are they exalted.

<span id="an_89:17">89:17</span> For thou art the glory of their
strength; and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.

<span id="an_89:18">89:18</span> For Jehovah is our shield, and the Holy
One of Israel, our king.

<span id="an_89:19">89:19</span> Then thou spakest in vision of thy Holy
One, and saidst, I have laid help upon a mighty one; I have exalted one
chosen out of the people.

<span id="an_89:20">89:20</span> I have found David my servant; with my
holy oil have I anointed him:

<span id="an_89:21">89:21</span> With whom my hand shall be established;
and mine arm shall strengthen him.

<span id="an_89:22">89:22</span> No enemy shall exact upon him, nor the
son of wickedness afflict him;

<span id="an_89:23">89:23</span> But I will beat down his adversaries
before his face, and will smite them that hate him.

<span id="an_89:24">89:24</span> And my faithfulness and my
loving-kindness shall be with him, and by my name shall his horn be
exalted.

<span id="an_89:25">89:25</span> And I will set his hand in the sea, and
his right hand in the rivers.

<span id="an_89:26">89:26</span> \*He\* shall call unto me, Thou art my
father, my ùGod, and the rock of my salvation;

<span id="an_89:27">89:27</span> And as to me, I will make him
firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.

<span id="an_89:28">89:28</span> My loving-kindness will I keep for him
for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him;

<span id="an_89:29">89:29</span> And I will establish his seed for ever,
and his throne as the days of heaven.

<span id="an_89:30">89:30</span> If his sons forsake my law, and walk
not in mine ordinances;

<span id="an_89:31">89:31</span> If they profane my statutes, and keep
not my commandments:

<span id="an_89:32">89:32</span> Then will I visit their transgression
with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.

<span id="an_89:33">89:33</span> Nevertheless my loving-kindness will I
not utterly take from him, nor belie my faithfulness;

<span id="an_89:34">89:34</span> My covenant will I not profane, nor
alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.

<span id="an_89:35">89:35</span> Once have I sworn by my holiness; I
will not lie unto David:

<span id="an_89:36">89:36</span> His seed shall endure for ever, and his
throne as the sun before me;

<span id="an_89:37">89:37</span> It shall be established for ever as the
moon, and the witness in the sky is firm. Selah.

<span id="an_89:38">89:38</span> But thou hast rejected and cast off;
thou hast been very wroth with thine anointed:

<span id="an_89:39">89:39</span> Thou hast made void the covenant of thy
servant; thou hast profaned his crown to the ground:

<span id="an_89:40">89:40</span> Thou hast broken down all his hedges;
thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin.

<span id="an_89:41">89:41</span> All that pass by the way plunder him;
he is become a reproach to his neighbours.

<span id="an_89:42">89:42</span> Thou hast exalted the right hand of his
oppressors; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice:

<span id="an_89:43">89:43</span> Yea, thou hast turned back the edge of
his sword, and hast not made him stand in the battle.

<span id="an_89:44">89:44</span> Thou hast made his brightness to cease,
and cast his throne down to the ground;

<span id="an_89:45">89:45</span> The days of his youth hast thou
shortened; thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.

<span id="an_89:46">89:46</span> How long, Jehovah, wilt thou hide
thyself for ever? shall thy fury burn like fire?

<span id="an_89:47">89:47</span> Remember, as regards me, what life is.
Wherefore hast thou created all the children of men to be vanity?

<span id="an_89:48">89:48</span> What man liveth, and shall not see
death? Shall he deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah.

<span id="an_89:49">89:49</span> Where, Lord, are thy former
loving-kindnesses, \[which\] thou swarest unto David in thy
faithfulness?

<span id="an_89:50">89:50</span> Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy
servants -- that I bear in my bosom \[that of\] all the mighty peoples
--

<span id="an_89:51">89:51</span> Wherewith thine enemies, O Jehovah,
have reproached, wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine
anointed.

<span id="an_89:52">89:52</span> Blessed be Jehovah for evermore! Amen,
and Amen.

<span id="an_90:1">90:1</span> {A Prayer of Moses, the man of God.}
Lord, \*thou\* hast been our dwelling-place in all generations.

<span id="an_90:2">90:2</span> Before the mountains were brought forth,
and thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from eternity to
eternity thou art ùGod.

<span id="an_90:3">90:3</span> Thou makest \[mortal\] man to return to
dust, and sayest, Return, children of men.

<span id="an_90:4">90:4</span> For a thousand years, in thy sight, are
as yesterday when it is past, and \[as\] a watch in the night.

<span id="an_90:5">90:5</span> Thou carriest them away as with a flood;
they are \[as\] a sleep: in the morning they are like grass \[that\]
groweth up:

<span id="an_90:6">90:6</span> In the morning it flourisheth and groweth
up; in the evening it is cut down and withereth.

<span id="an_90:7">90:7</span> For we are consumed by thine anger, and
by thy fury are we troubled.

<span id="an_90:8">90:8</span> Thou hast set our iniquities before thee,
our secret \[sins\] in the light of thy countenance.

<span id="an_90:9">90:9</span> For all our days pass away in thy wrath:
we spend our years as a \[passing\] thought.

<span id="an_90:10">90:10</span> The days of our years are threescore
years and ten; and if, by reason of strength, they be fourscore years,
yet their pride is labour and vanity, for it is soon cut off, and we fly
away.

<span id="an_90:11">90:11</span> Who knoweth the power of thine anger?
and thy wrath according to the fear of thee?

<span id="an_90:12">90:12</span> So teach \[us\] to number our days,
that we may acquire a wise heart.

<span id="an_90:13">90:13</span> Return, Jehovah: how long? and let it
repent thee concerning thy servants.

<span id="an_90:14">90:14</span> Satisfy us early with thy
loving-kindness; that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.

<span id="an_90:15">90:15</span> Make us glad according to the days
\[wherein\] thou hast afflicted us, according to the years \[wherein\]
we have seen evil.

<span id="an_90:16">90:16</span> Let thy work appear unto thy servants,
and thy majesty unto their sons.

<span id="an_90:17">90:17</span> And let the beauty of Jehovah our God
be upon us; and establish thou the work of our hands upon us: yea, the
work of our hands, establish thou it.

<span id="an_91:1">91:1</span> He that dwelleth in the secret place of
the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

<span id="an_91:2">91:2</span> I say of Jehovah, My refuge and my
fortress; my God, I will confide in him.

<span id="an_91:3">91:3</span> Surely \*he\* shall deliver thee from the
snare of the fowler, \[and\] from the destructive pestilence.

<span id="an_91:4">91:4</span> He shall cover thee with his feathers,
and under his wings shalt thou find refuge: his truth is a shield and
buckler.

<span id="an_91:5">91:5</span> Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
by night, for the arrow that flieth by day,

<span id="an_91:6">91:6</span> For the pestilence that walketh in
darkness, for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.

<span id="an_91:7">91:7</span> A thousand shall fall at thy side, and
ten thousand at thy right hand; \[but\] it shall not come nigh thee.

<span id="an_91:8">91:8</span> Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold,
and see the reward of the wicked.

<span id="an_91:9">91:9</span> Because \*thou\* hast made Jehovah, my
refuge, the Most High, thy dwelling-place,

<span id="an_91:10">91:10</span> There shall no evil befall thee,
neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent.

<span id="an_91:11">91:11</span> For he shall give his angels charge
concerning thee, to keep thee in all thy ways:

<span id="an_91:12">91:12</span> They shall bear thee up in \[their\]
hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.

<span id="an_91:13">91:13</span> Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the
adder; the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under foot.

<span id="an_91:14">91:14</span> Because he hath set his love upon me,
therefore will I deliver him; I will set him on high, because he hath
known my name.

<span id="an_91:15">91:15</span> He shall call upon me, and I will
answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honour
him.

<span id="an_91:16">91:16</span> With length of days will I satisfy him,
and shew him my salvation.

<span id="an_92:1">92:1</span> {A Psalm, a Song, for the Sabbath day.}
It is good to give thanks unto Jehovah, and to sing psalms unto thy
name, O Most High;

<span id="an_92:2">92:2</span> To declare thy loving-kindness in the
morning, and thy faithfulness in the nights,

<span id="an_92:3">92:3</span> Upon an instrument of ten strings and
upon the lute; upon the Higgaion with the harp.

<span id="an_92:4">92:4</span> For thou, Jehovah, hast made me glad
through thy work; I will triumph in the works of thy hands.

<span id="an_92:5">92:5</span> Jehovah, how great are thy works! Thy
thoughts are very deep:

<span id="an_92:6">92:6</span> A brutish man knoweth not, neither doth a
fool understand it.

<span id="an_92:7">92:7</span> When the wicked spring as the grass, and
when all the workers of iniquity flourish, it is that they may be
destroyed for ever.

<span id="an_92:8">92:8</span> And thou, Jehovah, art on high for
evermore.

<span id="an_92:9">92:9</span> For lo, thine enemies, O Jehovah, for lo,
thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be
scattered.

<span id="an_92:10">92:10</span> But my horn shalt thou exalt like a
buffalo's: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.

<span id="an_92:11">92:11</span> And mine eye shall see \[its desire\]
on mine enemies; mine ears shall hear \[it\] of the evil-doers that rise
up against me.

<span id="an_92:12">92:12</span> The righteous shall shoot forth like a
palm-tree; he shall grow like a cedar on Lebanon.

<span id="an_92:13">92:13</span> Those that are planted in the house of
Jehovah shall flourish in the courts of our God:

<span id="an_92:14">92:14</span> They are still vigorous in old age,
they are full of sap and green;

<span id="an_92:15">92:15</span> To shew that Jehovah is upright: \[he
is\] my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

<span id="an_93:1">93:1</span> Jehovah reigneth, he hath clothed himself
with majesty: Jehovah hath clothed himself, he hath girded himself with
strength; yea, the world is established, it shall not be moved.

<span id="an_93:2">93:2</span> Thy throne is established of old; thou
art from eternity.

<span id="an_93:3">93:3</span> The floods lifted up, O Jehovah, the
floods lifted up their voice; the floods lifted up their roaring waves.

<span id="an_93:4">93:4</span> Jehovah on high is mightier than the
voices of many waters, than the mighty breakers of the sea.

<span id="an_93:5">93:5</span> Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness
becometh thy house, O Jehovah, for ever.

<span id="an_94:1">94:1</span> O ùGod of vengeances, Jehovah, ùGod of
vengeances, shine forth;

<span id="an_94:2">94:2</span> Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth,
render the reward to the proud.

<span id="an_94:3">94:3</span> How long shall the wicked, O Jehovah, how
long shall the wicked triumph?

<span id="an_94:4">94:4</span> \[How long\] shall they utter \[and\]
speak insolence -- all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?

<span id="an_94:5">94:5</span> They crush thy people, O Jehovah, and
afflict thine inheritance;

<span id="an_94:6">94:6</span> They slay the widow and the stranger, and
murder the fatherless,

<span id="an_94:7">94:7</span> And say, Jah will not see, neither will
the God of Jacob regard \[it\].

<span id="an_94:8">94:8</span> Understand, ye brutish among the people;
and ye fools, when will ye be wise?

<span id="an_94:9">94:9</span> He that planted the ear, shall he not
hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see?

<span id="an_94:10">94:10</span> He that instructeth the nations, shall
not he correct -- he that teacheth man knowledge?

<span id="an_94:11">94:11</span> Jehovah knoweth the thoughts of man,
that they are vanity.

<span id="an_94:12">94:12</span> Blessed is the man whom thou
chastenest, O Jah, and whom thou teachest out of thy law;

<span id="an_94:13">94:13</span> That thou mayest give him rest from the
days of evil, until the pit be digged for the wicked.

<span id="an_94:14">94:14</span> For Jehovah will not cast off his
people, neither will he forsake his inheritance;

<span id="an_94:15">94:15</span> For judgment shall return unto
righteousness, and all the upright in heart shall follow it.

<span id="an_94:16">94:16</span> Who will rise up for me against the
evil-doers? who will stand for me against the workers of iniquity?

<span id="an_94:17">94:17</span> If Jehovah had not been my help, my
soul had almost dwelt in silence.

<span id="an_94:18">94:18</span> When I said, My foot slippeth, thy
loving-kindness, O Jehovah, held me up.

<span id="an_94:19">94:19</span> In the multitude of my anxious thoughts
within me thy comforts have delighted my soul.

<span id="an_94:20">94:20</span> Shall the throne of wickedness be
united to thee, which frameth mischief into a law?

<span id="an_94:21">94:21</span> They band together against the soul of
the righteous, and condemn innocent blood.

<span id="an_94:22">94:22</span> But Jehovah will be my high tower; and
my God the rock of my refuge.

<span id="an_94:23">94:23</span> And he will bring upon them their
iniquity, and will cut them off in their own evil: Jehovah our God will
cut them off.

<span id="an_95:1">95:1</span> Come, let us sing aloud to Jehovah, let
us shout for joy to the rock of our salvation;

<span id="an_95:2">95:2</span> Let us come before his face with
thanksgiving; let us shout aloud unto him with psalms.

<span id="an_95:3">95:3</span> For Jehovah is a great ùGod, and a great
king above all gods.

<span id="an_95:4">95:4</span> In his hand are the deep places of the
earth; the heights of the mountains are his also:

<span id="an_95:5">95:5</span> The sea is his, and he made it, and his
hands formed the dry \[land\].

<span id="an_95:6">95:6</span> Come, let us worship and bow down; let us
kneel before Jehovah our Maker.

<span id="an_95:7">95:7</span> For he is our God; and we are the people
of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. To-day if ye hear his voice,

<span id="an_95:8">95:8</span> Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, as
\[in\] the day of Massah, in the wilderness;

<span id="an_95:9">95:9</span> When your fathers tempted me, proved me,
and saw my work.

<span id="an_95:10">95:10</span> Forty years was I grieved with the
generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and
they have not known my ways;

<span id="an_95:11">95:11</span> So that I swore in mine anger, that
they should not enter into my rest.

<span id="an_96:1">96:1</span> Sing ye unto Jehovah a new song: sing
unto Jehovah, all the earth.

<span id="an_96:2">96:2</span> Sing unto Jehovah, bless his name;
publish his salvation from day to day.

<span id="an_96:3">96:3</span> Declare his glory among the nations, his
wondrous works among all the peoples.

<span id="an_96:4">96:4</span> For Jehovah is great and exceedingly to
be praised; he is terrible above all gods.

<span id="an_96:5">96:5</span> For all the gods of the peoples are
idols; but Jehovah made the heavens.

<span id="an_96:6">96:6</span> Majesty and splendour are before him;
strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.

<span id="an_96:7">96:7</span> Give unto Jehovah, ye families of
peoples, give unto Jehovah glory and strength;

<span id="an_96:8">96:8</span> Give unto Jehovah the glory of his name;
bring an oblation and come into his courts;

<span id="an_96:9">96:9</span> Worship Jehovah in holy splendour;
tremble before him, all the earth.

<span id="an_96:10">96:10</span> Say among the nations, Jehovah
reigneth! yea, the world is established, it shall not be moved; he will
execute judgment upon the peoples with equity.

<span id="an_96:11">96:11</span> Let the heavens rejoice, and let the
earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;

<span id="an_96:12">96:12</span> Let the field exult and all that is
therein. Then shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy,

<span id="an_96:13">96:13</span> Before Jehovah, for he cometh; for he
cometh to judge the earth: he will judge the world with righteousness,
and the peoples in his faithfulness.

<span id="an_97:1">97:1</span> Jehovah reigneth: let the earth be glad,
let the many isles rejoice.

<span id="an_97:2">97:2</span> Clouds and darkness are round about him;
righteousness and judgment are the foundation of his throne.

<span id="an_97:3">97:3</span> A fire goeth before him, and burneth up
his adversaries round about.

<span id="an_97:4">97:4</span> His lightnings lightened the world: the
earth saw, and trembled.

<span id="an_97:5">97:5</span> The mountains melted like wax at the
presence of Jehovah, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

<span id="an_97:6">97:6</span> The heavens declare his righteousness,
and all the peoples see his glory.

<span id="an_97:7">97:7</span> Ashamed be all they that serve graven
images, that boast themselves of idols. Worship him, all ye gods.

<span id="an_97:8">97:8</span> Zion heard, and rejoiced; and the
daughters of Judah were glad, because of thy judgments, O Jehovah.

<span id="an_97:9">97:9</span> For thou, Jehovah, art the Most High
above all the earth; thou art exalted exceedingly above all gods.

<span id="an_97:10">97:10</span> Ye that love Jehovah, hate evil: he
preserveth the souls of his saints, he delivereth them out of the hand
of the wicked.

<span id="an_97:11">97:11</span> Light is sown for the righteous, and
joy for the upright in heart.

<span id="an_97:12">97:12</span> Rejoice in Jehovah, ye righteous; and
give thanks in remembrance of his holiness.

<span id="an_98:1">98:1</span> {A Psalm.} Sing ye unto Jehovah a new
song: for he hath done wondrous things; his right hand and his holy arm
hath wrought salvation for him.

<span id="an_98:2">98:2</span> Jehovah hath made known his salvation:
his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the nations.

<span id="an_98:3">98:3</span> He hath remembered his loving-kindness
and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the
earth have seen the salvation of our God.

<span id="an_98:4">98:4</span> Shout aloud unto Jehovah, all the earth;
break forth and shout for joy, and sing psalms.

<span id="an_98:5">98:5</span> Sing psalms unto Jehovah with the harp:
with the harp, and the voice of a song;

<span id="an_98:6">98:6</span> With trumpets and sound of cornet, make a
joyful noise before the King, Jehovah.

<span id="an_98:7">98:7</span> Let the sea roar, and the fulness
thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein;

<span id="an_98:8">98:8</span> Let the floods clap \[their\] hands; let
the mountains sing for joy together,

<span id="an_98:9">98:9</span> Before Jehovah, for he cometh to judge
the earth: he will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples
with equity.

<span id="an_99:1">99:1</span> Jehovah reigneth: let the peoples
tremble. He sitteth \[between the\] cherubim: let the earth be moved.

<span id="an_99:2">99:2</span> Jehovah is great in Zion, and he is high
above all the peoples.

<span id="an_99:3">99:3</span> They shall praise thy great and terrible
name, -- it is holy! --

<span id="an_99:4">99:4</span> And the strength of the king that loveth
justice. \*Thou\* hast established equity: it is thou that executest
judgment and righteousness in Jacob.

<span id="an_99:5">99:5</span> Exalt Jehovah our God, and worship at his
footstool. He is holy!

<span id="an_99:6">99:6</span> Moses and Aaron among his priests, and
Samuel among them that call upon his name: they called unto Jehovah, and
\*he\* answered them.

<span id="an_99:7">99:7</span> He spoke unto them in the pillar of
cloud: they kept his testimonies, and the statute that he gave them.

<span id="an_99:8">99:8</span> Jehovah, our God, \*thou\* answeredst
them: a forgiving ùGod wast thou unto them, though thou tookest
vengeance of their doings.

<span id="an_99:9">99:9</span> Exalt Jehovah our God, and worship at the
hill of his holiness; for holy is Jehovah our God.

<span id="an_100:1">100:1</span> {A Psalm of thanksgiving.} Shout aloud
unto Jehovah, all the earth!

<span id="an_100:2">100:2</span> Serve Jehovah with joy: come before his
presence with exultation.

<span id="an_100:3">100:3</span> Know that Jehovah is God: it is he that
hath made us, and not we ourselves; \[we are\] his people, and the sheep
of his pasture.

<span id="an_100:4">100:4</span> Enter into his gates with thanksgiving
\[and\] into his courts with praise; give thanks unto him, bless his
name:

<span id="an_100:5">100:5</span> For Jehovah is good; his
loving-kindness \[endureth\] for ever; and his faithfulness from
generation to generation.

<span id="an_101:1">101:1</span> {A Psalm of David.} I will sing of
loving-kindness and judgment: unto thee, Jehovah, will I sing psalms.

<span id="an_101:2">101:2</span> I will behave myself wisely in a
perfect way. When wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house in
the integrity of my heart.

<span id="an_101:3">101:3</span> I will set no thing of Belial before
mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave
to me.

<span id="an_101:4">101:4</span> A perverse heart shall depart from me;
I will not know evil.

<span id="an_101:5">101:5</span> Whoso secretly slandereth his
neighbour, him will I destroy; him that hath a high look and a proud
heart will I not suffer.

<span id="an_101:6">101:6</span> Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of
the land, that they may dwell with me; he that walketh in a perfect way,
he shall serve me.

<span id="an_101:7">101:7</span> He that practiseth deceit shall not
dwell within my house; he that speaketh falsehoods shall not subsist in
my sight.

<span id="an_101:8">101:8</span> Every morning will I destroy all the
wicked of the land: to cut off all workers of iniquity from the city of
Jehovah.

<span id="an_102:1">102:1</span> {A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is
overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before Jehovah.} Jehovah,
hear my prayer, and let my cry come unto thee.

<span id="an_102:2">102:2</span> Hide not thy face from me: in the day
of my trouble, incline thine ear unto me; in the day I call, answer me
speedily.

<span id="an_102:3">102:3</span> For my days are consumed like smoke,
and my bones are burned as a firebrand.

<span id="an_102:4">102:4</span> My heart is smitten and withered like
grass; yea, I have forgotten to eat my bread.

<span id="an_102:5">102:5</span> By reason of the voice of my groaning,
my bones cleave to my flesh.

<span id="an_102:6">102:6</span> I am become like the pelican of the
wilderness, I am as an owl in desolate places;

<span id="an_102:7">102:7</span> I watch, and am like a sparrow alone
upon the housetop.

<span id="an_102:8">102:8</span> Mine enemies reproach me all the day;
they that are mad against me swear by me.

<span id="an_102:9">102:9</span> For I have eaten ashes like bread, and
mingled my drink with weeping,

<span id="an_102:10">102:10</span> Because of thine indignation and thy
wrath; for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.

<span id="an_102:11">102:11</span> My days are like a lengthened-out
shadow, and I, I am withered like grass.

<span id="an_102:12">102:12</span> But thou, Jehovah, abidest for ever,
and thy memorial from generation to generation.

<span id="an_102:13">102:13</span> \*Thou\* wilt rise up, thou wilt have
mercy upon Zion: for it is the time to be gracious to her, for the set
time is come.

<span id="an_102:14">102:14</span> For thy servants take pleasure in her
stones, and favour her dust.

<span id="an_102:15">102:15</span> And the nations shall fear the name
of Jehovah, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.

<span id="an_102:16">102:16</span> When Jehovah shall build up Zion, he
will appear in his glory.

<span id="an_102:17">102:17</span> He will regard the prayer of the
destitute one, and not despise their prayer.

<span id="an_102:18">102:18</span> This shall be written for the
generation to come; and a people that shall be created shall praise Jah:

<span id="an_102:19">102:19</span> For he hath looked down from the
height of his sanctuary; from the heavens hath Jehovah beheld the earth,

<span id="an_102:20">102:20</span> To hear the groaning of the prisoner,
to loose those that are appointed to die;

<span id="an_102:21">102:21</span> That the name of Jehovah may be
declared in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem,

<span id="an_102:22">102:22</span> When the peoples shall be gathered
together, and the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah.

<span id="an_102:23">102:23</span> He weakened my strength in the way,
he shortened my days.

<span id="an_102:24">102:24</span> I said, My ùGod, take me not away in
the midst of my days! ... Thy years are from generation to generation.

<span id="an_102:25">102:25</span> Of old hast thou founded the earth,
and the heavens are the work of thy hands:

<span id="an_102:26">102:26</span> \*They\* shall perish, but \*thou\*
continuest; and all of them shall grow old as a garment: as a vesture
shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed.

<span id="an_102:27">102:27</span> But thou art the Same, and thy years
shall have no end.

<span id="an_102:28">102:28</span> The children of thy servants shall
abide, and their seed shall be established before thee.

<span id="an_103:1">103:1</span> {\[A Psalm\] of David.} Bless Jehovah,
O my soul; and all that is within me, \[bless\] his holy name!

<span id="an_103:2">103:2</span> Bless Jehovah, O my soul, and forget
not all his benefits:

<span id="an_103:3">103:3</span> Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who
healeth all thy diseases;

<span id="an_103:4">103:4</span> Who redeemeth thy life from the pit,
who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies;

<span id="an_103:5">103:5</span> Who satisfieth thine old age with good
\[things\]; thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.

<span id="an_103:6">103:6</span> Jehovah executeth righteousness and
justice for all that are oppressed.

<span id="an_103:7">103:7</span> He made known his ways unto Moses, his
acts unto the children of Israel.

<span id="an_103:8">103:8</span> Jehovah is merciful and gracious, slow
to anger, and abundant in loving-kindness.

<span id="an_103:9">103:9</span> He will not always chide, neither will
he keep \[his anger\] for ever.

<span id="an_103:10">103:10</span> He hath not dealt with us according
to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.

<span id="an_103:11">103:11</span> For as the heavens are high above the
earth, so great is his loving-kindness toward them that fear him.

<span id="an_103:12">103:12</span> As far as the east is from the west,
so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.

<span id="an_103:13">103:13</span> As a father pitieth \[his\] children,
so Jehovah pitieth them that fear him.

<span id="an_103:14">103:14</span> For himself knoweth our frame; he
remembereth that we are dust.

<span id="an_103:15">103:15</span> As for man, his days are as grass; as
a flower of the field, so he flourisheth:

<span id="an_103:16">103:16</span> For the wind passeth over it, and it
is gone, and the place thereof knoweth it no more.

<span id="an_103:17">103:17</span> But the loving-kindness of Jehovah is
from everlasting and to everlasting, upon them that fear him, and his
righteousness unto children's children,

<span id="an_103:18">103:18</span> To such as keep his covenant and to
those that remember his precepts to do them.

<span id="an_103:19">103:19</span> Jehovah hath established his throne
in the heavens, and his kingdom ruleth over all.

<span id="an_103:20">103:20</span> Bless Jehovah, ye his angels, mighty
in strength, that execute his word, hearkening unto the voice of his
word.

<span id="an_103:21">103:21</span> Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts; ye
ministers of his that do his will.

<span id="an_103:22">103:22</span> Bless Jehovah, all his works, in all
places of his dominion. Bless Jehovah, O my soul!

<span id="an_104:1">104:1</span> Bless Jehovah, O my soul! Jehovah my
God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with majesty and splendour;

<span id="an_104:2">104:2</span> Covering thyself with light as with a
garment, stretching out the heavens like a tent-curtain; --

<span id="an_104:3">104:3</span> Who layeth the beams of his upper
chambers in the waters, who maketh clouds his chariot, who walketh upon
the wings of the wind;

<span id="an_104:4">104:4</span> Who maketh his angels spirits; his
ministers a flame of fire.

<span id="an_104:5">104:5</span> He laid the earth upon its foundations:
it shall not be removed for ever.

<span id="an_104:6">104:6</span> Thou hadst covered it with the deep, as
with a vesture; the waters stood above the mountains:

<span id="an_104:7">104:7</span> At thy rebuke they fled, at the voice
of thy thunder they hasted away; --

<span id="an_104:8">104:8</span> The mountains rose, the valleys sank,
unto the place which thou hadst founded for them; --

<span id="an_104:9">104:9</span> Thou hast set a bound which they may
not pass over, that they turn not again to cover the earth.

<span id="an_104:10">104:10</span> He sendeth the springs into the
valleys: they run among the mountains;

<span id="an_104:11">104:11</span> They give drink to every beast of the
field; the wild asses quench their thirst.

<span id="an_104:12">104:12</span> The birds of heaven dwell by them;
they give forth their voice from among the branches.

<span id="an_104:13">104:13</span> He watereth the mountains from his
upper-chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.

<span id="an_104:14">104:14</span> He maketh the grass to grow for the
cattle, and herb for the service of man; bringing forth bread out of the
earth,

<span id="an_104:15">104:15</span> And wine which gladdeneth the heart
of man; making \[his\] face shine with oil; and with bread he
strengtheneth man's heart.

<span id="an_104:16">104:16</span> The trees of Jehovah are satisfied,
the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted,

<span id="an_104:17">104:17</span> Where the birds make their nests;
\[as for\] the stork, the fir trees are her house.

<span id="an_104:18">104:18</span> The high mountains are for the wild
goats; the cliffs, a refuge for the rock-badgers.

<span id="an_104:19">104:19</span> He made the moon for seasons: the sun
knoweth its going down.

<span id="an_104:20">104:20</span> Thou makest darkness, and it is
night, wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth:

<span id="an_104:21">104:21</span> The young lions roar after the prey,
and to seek their food from ùGod.

<span id="an_104:22">104:22</span> The sun ariseth, they retreat, and
lay them down in their dens.

<span id="an_104:23">104:23</span> Man goeth forth unto his work, and to
his labour until the evening.

<span id="an_104:24">104:24</span> How manifold are thy works, O
Jehovah! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy
riches.

<span id="an_104:25">104:25</span> Yonder is the great and wide sea:
therein are moving things innumerable, living creatures small and great.

<span id="an_104:26">104:26</span> There go the ships; \[there\] that
leviathan, which thou hast formed to play therein.

<span id="an_104:27">104:27</span> These all look unto thee, that thou
mayest give their food in its season:

<span id="an_104:28">104:28</span> That thou givest unto them, they
gather; thou openest thy hand, they are filled with good.

<span id="an_104:29">104:29</span> Thou hidest thy face, they are
troubled; thou takest away their breath, they expire and return to their
dust.

<span id="an_104:30">104:30</span> Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they
are created, and thou renewest the face of the earth.

<span id="an_104:31">104:31</span> The glory of Jehovah will endure for
ever; Jehovah will rejoice in his works.

<span id="an_104:32">104:32</span> He looketh on the earth, and it
trembleth; he toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.

<span id="an_104:33">104:33</span> I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I
live; I will sing psalms to my God while I have my being.

<span id="an_104:34">104:34</span> My meditation shall be pleasant unto
him; I will rejoice in Jehovah.

<span id="an_104:35">104:35</span> Sinners shall be consumed out of the
earth, and the wicked shall be no more. Bless Jehovah, O my soul.
Hallelujah!

<span id="an_105:1">105:1</span> Give ye thanks unto Jehovah, call upon
his name; make known his acts among the peoples.

<span id="an_105:2">105:2</span> Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him;
meditate upon all his wondrous works.

<span id="an_105:3">105:3</span> Glory ye in his holy name: let the
heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.

<span id="an_105:4">105:4</span> Seek Jehovah and his strength, seek his
face continually;

<span id="an_105:5">105:5</span> Remember his wondrous works which he
hath done, his miracles and the judgments of his mouth:

<span id="an_105:6">105:6</span> Ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye sons
of Jacob, his chosen ones.

<span id="an_105:7">105:7</span> He, Jehovah, is our God; his judgments
are in all the earth.

<span id="an_105:8">105:8</span> He is ever mindful of his covenant, --
the word which he commanded to a thousand generations, --

<span id="an_105:9">105:9</span> Which he made with Abraham, and of his
oath unto Isaac;

<span id="an_105:10">105:10</span> And he confirmed it unto Jacob for a
statute, unto Israel for an everlasting covenant,

<span id="an_105:11">105:11</span> Saying, Unto thee will I give the
land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;

<span id="an_105:12">105:12</span> When they were a few men in number,
of small account, and strangers in it.

<span id="an_105:13">105:13</span> And they went from nation to nation,
from one kingdom to another people.

<span id="an_105:14">105:14</span> He suffered no man to oppress them,
and reproved kings for their sakes,

<span id="an_105:15">105:15</span> \[Saying,\] Touch not mine anointed
ones, and do my prophets no harm.

<span id="an_105:16">105:16</span> And he called for a famine upon the
land; he broke the whole staff of bread.

<span id="an_105:17">105:17</span> He sent a man before them: Joseph was
sold for a bondman.

<span id="an_105:18">105:18</span> They afflicted his feet with fetters;
his soul came into irons;

<span id="an_105:19">105:19</span> Until the time when what he said came
about: the word of Jehovah tried him.

<span id="an_105:20">105:20</span> The king sent and loosed him -- the
ruler of peoples -- and let him go free.

<span id="an_105:21">105:21</span> He made him lord of his house, and
ruler over all his possessions:

<span id="an_105:22">105:22</span> To bind his princes at his pleasure,
and teach his elders wisdom.

<span id="an_105:23">105:23</span> And Israel came into Egypt, and Jacob
sojourned in the land of Ham.

<span id="an_105:24">105:24</span> And he made his people exceeding
fruitful, and made them mightier than their oppressors.

<span id="an_105:25">105:25</span> He turned their heart to hate his
people, to deal subtilly with his servants.

<span id="an_105:26">105:26</span> He sent Moses his servant, \[and\]
Aaron whom he had chosen:

<span id="an_105:27">105:27</span> They set his signs among them, and
miracles in the land of Ham.

<span id="an_105:28">105:28</span> He sent darkness, and made it dark;
and they rebelled not against his word.

<span id="an_105:29">105:29</span> He turned their waters into blood,
and caused their fish to die.

<span id="an_105:30">105:30</span> Their land swarmed with frogs, -- in
the chambers of their kings.

<span id="an_105:31">105:31</span> He spoke, and there came dog-flies,
\[and\] gnats in all their borders.

<span id="an_105:32">105:32</span> He gave them hail for rain, \[and\]
flaming fire in their land;

<span id="an_105:33">105:33</span> And he smote their vines and their
fig-trees, and broke the trees of their borders.

<span id="an_105:34">105:34</span> He spoke, and the locust came, and
the cankerworm, even without number;

<span id="an_105:35">105:35</span> And they devoured every herb in their
land, and ate up the fruit of their ground.

<span id="an_105:36">105:36</span> And he smote every firstborn in their
land, the firstfruits of all their vigour.

<span id="an_105:37">105:37</span> And he brought them forth with silver
and gold; and there was not one feeble among their tribes.

<span id="an_105:38">105:38</span> Egypt rejoiced at their departure;
for the fear of them had fallen upon them.

<span id="an_105:39">105:39</span> He spread a cloud for a covering, and
fire to give light in the night.

<span id="an_105:40">105:40</span> They asked, and he brought quails,
and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.

<span id="an_105:41">105:41</span> He opened the rock, and waters gushed
forth; they ran in the dry places \[like\] a river.

<span id="an_105:42">105:42</span> For he remembered his holy word,
\[and\] Abraham his servant;

<span id="an_105:43">105:43</span> And he brought forth his people with
gladness, his chosen with rejoicing;

<span id="an_105:44">105:44</span> And he gave them the lands of the
nations, and they took possession of the labour of the peoples:

<span id="an_105:45">105:45</span> That they might keep his statutes,
and observe his laws. Hallelujah!

<span id="an_106:1">106:1</span> Hallelujah! Give ye thanks unto
Jehovah; for he is good; for his loving-kindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_106:2">106:2</span> Who can utter the mighty acts of
Jehovah? \[who\] can shew forth all his praise?

<span id="an_106:3">106:3</span> Blessed are they that keep justice,
\[and\] he that doeth righteousness at all times.

<span id="an_106:4">106:4</span> Remember me, O Jehovah, with \[thy\]
favour toward thy people; visit me with thy salvation:

<span id="an_106:5">106:5</span> That I may see the prosperity of thy
chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the joy of thy nation, that I may
glory with thine inheritance.

<span id="an_106:6">106:6</span> We have sinned with our fathers, we
have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.

<span id="an_106:7">106:7</span> Our fathers in Egypt considered not thy
wondrous works; they remembered not the multitude of thy
loving-kindnesses; but they rebelled at the sea, at the Red Sea.

<span id="an_106:8">106:8</span> Yet he saved them for his name's sake,
that he might make known his might.

<span id="an_106:9">106:9</span> And he rebuked the Red Sea, and it
dried up; and he led them through the deeps as through a wilderness.

<span id="an_106:10">106:10</span> And he saved them from the hand of
him that hated \[them\], and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

<span id="an_106:11">106:11</span> And the waters covered their
oppressors: there was not one of them left.

<span id="an_106:12">106:12</span> Then believed they his words; they
sang his praise.

<span id="an_106:13">106:13</span> They soon forgot his works; they
waited not for his counsel:

<span id="an_106:14">106:14</span> And they lusted exceedingly in the
wilderness, and tempted ùGod in the desert.

<span id="an_106:15">106:15</span> Then he gave them their request, but
sent leanness into their soul.

<span id="an_106:16">106:16</span> And they envied Moses in the camp,
\[and\] Aaron, the saint of Jehovah.

<span id="an_106:17">106:17</span> The earth opened and swallowed up
Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram;

<span id="an_106:18">106:18</span> And fire was kindled in their
company; a flame burned up the wicked.

<span id="an_106:19">106:19</span> They made a calf in Horeb, and did
homage to a molten image;

<span id="an_106:20">106:20</span> And they changed their glory into the
similitude of an ox that eateth grass.

<span id="an_106:21">106:21</span> They forgot ùGod their Saviour, who
had done great things in Egypt,

<span id="an_106:22">106:22</span> Wondrous works in the land of Ham,
terrible things by the Red Sea.

<span id="an_106:23">106:23</span> And he said that he would destroy
them, had not Moses, his chosen, stood before him in the breach, to turn
away his fury, lest he should destroy \[them\].

<span id="an_106:24">106:24</span> And they despised the pleasant land;
they believed not his word,

<span id="an_106:25">106:25</span> But murmured in their tents: they
hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.

<span id="an_106:26">106:26</span> And he lifted up his hand to them,
that he would make them fall in the wilderness;

<span id="an_106:27">106:27</span> And that he would make their seed
fall among the nations, and disperse them through the countries.

<span id="an_106:28">106:28</span> And they joined themselves unto
Baal-Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead;

<span id="an_106:29">106:29</span> And they provoked \[him\] to anger
with their doings; and a plague broke out among them.

<span id="an_106:30">106:30</span> Then stood up Phinehas and executed
judgment, and the plague was stayed;

<span id="an_106:31">106:31</span> And that was reckoned unto him for
righteousness, from generation to generation, for evermore.

<span id="an_106:32">106:32</span> And they moved him to wrath at the
waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses on their account;

<span id="an_106:33">106:33</span> For they provoked his spirit, so that
he spoke unadvisedly with his lips.

<span id="an_106:34">106:34</span> They did not destroy the peoples, as
Jehovah commanded them;

<span id="an_106:35">106:35</span> But they mingled with the nations,
and learned their works;

<span id="an_106:36">106:36</span> And they served their idols; and they
were a snare unto them:

<span id="an_106:37">106:37</span> And they sacrificed their sons and
their daughters unto demons,

<span id="an_106:38">106:38</span> And shed innocent blood, the blood of
their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols
of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.

<span id="an_106:39">106:39</span> And they were defiled with their
works, and went a-whoring in their doings.

<span id="an_106:40">106:40</span> Then was the anger of Jehovah kindled
against his people, and he abhorred his inheritance;

<span id="an_106:41">106:41</span> And he gave them into the hand of the
nations; and they that hated them ruled over them:

<span id="an_106:42">106:42</span> And their enemies oppressed them, and
they were brought into subjection under their hand.

<span id="an_106:43">106:43</span> Often did he deliver them; but as for
them they provoked \[him\] by their counsel, and they were brought low
by their iniquity.

<span id="an_106:44">106:44</span> But he regarded their distress, when
he heard their cry;

<span id="an_106:45">106:45</span> And he remembered for them his
covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his
loving-kindnesses;

<span id="an_106:46">106:46</span> And he caused them to find compassion
of all those that had carried them captives.

<span id="an_106:47">106:47</span> Save us, Jehovah our God, and gather
us from among the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, \[and\] to
triumph in thy praise.

<span id="an_106:48">106:48</span> Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel,
from eternity and to eternity! And let all the people say, Amen!
Hallelujah!

<span id="an_107:1">107:1</span> Give ye thanks unto Jehovah; for he is
good; for his loving-kindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_107:2">107:2</span> Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so,
whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the oppressor,

<span id="an_107:3">107:3</span> And gathered out of the countries, from
the east and from the west, from the north and from the sea.

<span id="an_107:4">107:4</span> They wandered in the wilderness in a
desert way, they found no city of habitation;

<span id="an_107:5">107:5</span> Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted
in them:

<span id="an_107:6">107:6</span> Then they cried unto Jehovah in their
trouble, \[and\] he delivered them out of their distresses,

<span id="an_107:7">107:7</span> And he led them forth by a right way,
that they might go to a city of habitation.

<span id="an_107:8">107:8</span> Let them give thanks unto Jehovah for
his loving-kindness, and for his wondrous works to the children of men;

<span id="an_107:9">107:9</span> For he hath satisfied the longing soul
and filled the hungry soul with good.

<span id="an_107:10">107:10</span> Such as inhabit darkness and the
shadow of death, bound in affliction and iron,

<span id="an_107:11">107:11</span> Because they had rebelled against the
words of ùGod, and had despised the counsel of the Most High; ...

<span id="an_107:12">107:12</span> And he bowed down their heart with
labour; they stumbled, and there was none to help:

<span id="an_107:13">107:13</span> Then they cried unto Jehovah in their
trouble, \[and\] he saved them out of their distresses;

<span id="an_107:14">107:14</span> He brought them out of darkness and
the shadow of death, and broke their bands in sunder.

<span id="an_107:15">107:15</span> Let them give thanks unto Jehovah for
his loving-kindness, and for his wondrous works to the children of men;

<span id="an_107:16">107:16</span> For he hath broken the gates of
bronze, and cut asunder the bars of iron.

<span id="an_107:17">107:17</span> Fools, because of their way of
transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted;

<span id="an_107:18">107:18</span> Their soul abhorreth all manner of
food, and they draw near unto the gates of death:

<span id="an_107:19">107:19</span> Then they cry unto Jehovah in their
trouble, \[and\] he saveth them out of their distresses;

<span id="an_107:20">107:20</span> He sendeth his word, and healeth
them, and delivereth them from their destructions.

<span id="an_107:21">107:21</span> Let them give thanks unto Jehovah for
his loving-kindness, and for his wondrous works to the children of men,

<span id="an_107:22">107:22</span> And let them offer the sacrifices of
thanksgiving, and declare his works in joyful song.

<span id="an_107:23">107:23</span> They that go down to the sea in
ships, that do business in great waters,

<span id="an_107:24">107:24</span> These see the works of Jehovah, and
his wonders in the deep.

<span id="an_107:25">107:25</span> For he speaketh, and raiseth the
stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof:

<span id="an_107:26">107:26</span> They mount up to the heavens, they go
down to the depths; their soul is melted because of trouble;

<span id="an_107:27">107:27</span> They reel to and fro, and stagger
like a drunken man, and they are at their wits' end:

<span id="an_107:28">107:28</span> Then they cry unto Jehovah in their
trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses;

<span id="an_107:29">107:29</span> He maketh the storm a calm, and the
waves thereof are still:

<span id="an_107:30">107:30</span> And they rejoice because they are
quiet; and he bringeth them unto their desired haven.

<span id="an_107:31">107:31</span> Let them give thanks unto Jehovah for
his loving-kindness, and for his wondrous works to the children of men;

<span id="an_107:32">107:32</span> Let them exalt him also in the
congregation of the people, and praise him in the session of the elders.

<span id="an_107:33">107:33</span> He maketh rivers into a wilderness,
and water-springs into dry ground;

<span id="an_107:34">107:34</span> A fruitful land into a plain of salt,
for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.

<span id="an_107:35">107:35</span> He maketh the wilderness into a pool
of water, and the dry land into water-springs;

<span id="an_107:36">107:36</span> And there he maketh the hungry to
dwell, and they establish a city of habitation;

<span id="an_107:37">107:37</span> And sow fields, and plant vineyards,
which yield fruits of increase;

<span id="an_107:38">107:38</span> And he blesseth them, so that they
are multiplied greatly; and he suffereth not their cattle to decrease.

<span id="an_107:39">107:39</span> And they are diminished and brought
low, through oppression, adversity, and sorrow:

<span id="an_107:40">107:40</span> He poureth contempt upon nobles, and
causeth them to wander in a pathless waste;

<span id="an_107:41">107:41</span> But he secureth the needy one on high
from affliction, and maketh \[him\] families like flocks.

<span id="an_107:42">107:42</span> The upright shall see it, and
rejoice; and all unrighteousness shall stop its mouth.

<span id="an_107:43">107:43</span> Whoso is wise, let him observe these
things, and let them understand the loving-kindnesses of Jehovah.

<span id="an_108:1">108:1</span> {A Song, a Psalm of David.} My heart is
fixed, O God: I will sing, yea, I will sing psalms, even \[with\] my
glory.

<span id="an_108:2">108:2</span> Awake, lute and harp: I will wake the
dawn.

<span id="an_108:3">108:3</span> I will give thee thanks among the
peoples, O Jehovah; of thee will I sing psalms among the nations:

<span id="an_108:4">108:4</span> For thy loving-kindness is great above
the heavens, and thy truth is unto the clouds.

<span id="an_108:5">108:5</span> Be thou exalted above the heavens, O
God, and thy glory above all the earth.

<span id="an_108:6">108:6</span> That thy beloved ones may be delivered:
save with thy right hand, and answer me.

<span id="an_108:7">108:7</span> God hath spoken in his holiness: I will
exult, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

<span id="an_108:8">108:8</span> Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine, and
Ephraim is the strength of my head; Judah is my law-giver;

<span id="an_108:9">108:9</span> Moab is my wash-pot; upon Edom will I
cast my sandal; over Philistia will I shout aloud.

<span id="an_108:10">108:10</span> Who will bring me into the strong
city? who will lead me unto Edom?

<span id="an_108:11">108:11</span> \[Wilt\] not \[thou\], O God, who
didst cast us off? and didst not go forth, O God, with our armies?

<span id="an_108:12">108:12</span> Give us help from trouble; for vain
is man's deliverance.

<span id="an_108:13">108:13</span> Through God we shall do valiantly;
and he it is that will tread down our adversaries.

<span id="an_109:1">109:1</span> {To the chief Musician. Of David. A
Psalm.} O God of my praise, be not silent:

<span id="an_109:2">109:2</span> For the mouth of the wicked \[man\] and
the mouth of deceit are opened against me: they have spoken against me
with a lying tongue,

<span id="an_109:3">109:3</span> And with words of hatred have they
encompassed me; and they fight against me without a cause.

<span id="an_109:4">109:4</span> For my love they are mine adversaries;
but I \[give myself unto\] prayer.

<span id="an_109:5">109:5</span> And they have rewarded me evil for
good, and hatred for my love.

<span id="an_109:6">109:6</span> Set a wicked \[man\] over him, and let
\[the\] adversary stand at his right hand;

<span id="an_109:7">109:7</span> When he shall be judged, let him go out
guilty, and let his prayer become sin;

<span id="an_109:8">109:8</span> Let his days be few, let another take
his office;

<span id="an_109:9">109:9</span> Let his sons be fatherless, and his
wife a widow;

<span id="an_109:10">109:10</span> Let his sons be vagabonds and beg,
and let them seek \[their bread\] far from their desolate places;

<span id="an_109:11">109:11</span> Let the usurer cast the net over all
that he hath, and let strangers despoil his labour;

<span id="an_109:12">109:12</span> Let there be none to extend kindness
unto him, neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children;

<span id="an_109:13">109:13</span> Let his posterity be cut off; in the
generation following let their name be blotted out:

<span id="an_109:14">109:14</span> Let the iniquity of his fathers be
remembered with Jehovah, and let not the sin of his mother be blotted
out;

<span id="an_109:15">109:15</span> Let them be before Jehovah
continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth:

<span id="an_109:16">109:16</span> Because he remembered not to shew
kindness, but persecuted the afflicted and needy man, and the broken in
heart, to slay him.

<span id="an_109:17">109:17</span> And he loved cursing; so let it come
unto him. And he delighted not in blessing; and let it be far from him.

<span id="an_109:18">109:18</span> And he clothed himself with cursing
like his vestment; so let it come into his bowels like water, and like
oil into his bones;

<span id="an_109:19">109:19</span> Let it be unto him as a garment with
which he covereth himself, and for a girdle wherewith he is constantly
girded.

<span id="an_109:20">109:20</span> Let this be the reward of mine
adversaries from Jehovah, and of them that speak evil against my soul.

<span id="an_109:21">109:21</span> But do \*thou\* for me, Jehovah,
Lord, for thy name's sake; because thy loving-kindness is good, deliver
me:

<span id="an_109:22">109:22</span> For I am afflicted and needy, and my
heart is wounded within me.

<span id="an_109:23">109:23</span> I am gone like a shadow when it
lengtheneth; I am tossed about like the locust;

<span id="an_109:24">109:24</span> My knees are failing through fasting,
and my flesh hath lost its fatness;

<span id="an_109:25">109:25</span> And I am become a reproach unto them;
\[when\] they look upon me they shake their heads.

<span id="an_109:26">109:26</span> Help me, Jehovah my God; save me
according to thy loving-kindness:

<span id="an_109:27">109:27</span> That they may know that this is thy
hand; that \*thou\*, Jehovah, hast done it.

<span id="an_109:28">109:28</span> Let \*them\* curse, but bless
\*thou\*; when they rise up, let them be ashamed, and let thy servant
rejoice.

<span id="an_109:29">109:29</span> Let mine adversaries be clothed with
confusion, and let them cover themselves with their shame as with a
mantle.

<span id="an_109:30">109:30</span> I will greatly celebrate Jehovah with
my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.

<span id="an_109:31">109:31</span> For he standeth at the right hand of
the needy, to save him from those that judge his soul.

<span id="an_110:1">110:1</span> {Psalm of David.} Jehovah said unto my
Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I put thine enemies \[as\] footstool
of thy feet.

<span id="an_110:2">110:2</span> Jehovah shall send the sceptre of thy
might out of Zion: rule in the midst of thine enemies.

<span id="an_110:3">110:3</span> Thy people shall be willing in the day
of thy power, in holy splendour: from the womb of the morning \[shall
come\] to thee the dew of thy youth.

<span id="an_110:4">110:4</span> Jehovah hath sworn, and will not
repent, Thou art priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek.

<span id="an_110:5">110:5</span> The Lord at thy right hand will smite
through kings in the day of his anger.

<span id="an_110:6">110:6</span> He shall judge among the nations; he
shall fill \[all places\] with dead bodies; he shall smite through the
head over a great country.

<span id="an_110:7">110:7</span> He shall drink of the brook in the way;
therefore shall he lift up the head.

<span id="an_111:1">111:1</span> Hallelujah! I will celebrate Jehovah
with \[my\] whole heart, in the council of the upright, and in the
assembly.

<span id="an_111:2">111:2</span> Great are the works of Jehovah; sought
out of all that delight in them.

<span id="an_111:3">111:3</span> His work is majesty and splendour, and
his righteousness abideth for ever.

<span id="an_111:4">111:4</span> He hath made his wonders to be
remembered: Jehovah is gracious and merciful.

<span id="an_111:5">111:5</span> He hath given meat unto them that fear
him; he is ever mindful of his covenant.

<span id="an_111:6">111:6</span> He hath shewn his people the power of
his works, to give them the heritage of the nations.

<span id="an_111:7">111:7</span> The works of his hands are truth and
judgment; all his precepts are faithful:

<span id="an_111:8">111:8</span> Maintained for ever and ever, done in
truth and uprightness.

<span id="an_111:9">111:9</span> He sent deliverance unto his people; he
hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and terrible is his name.

<span id="an_111:10">111:10</span> The fear of Jehovah is the beginning
of wisdom; a good understanding have all they that do \[his precepts\]:
his praise abideth for ever.

<span id="an_112:1">112:1</span> Hallelujah! Blessed is the man that
feareth Jehovah, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.

<span id="an_112:2">112:2</span> His seed shall be mighty in the land;
the generation of the upright shall be blessed.

<span id="an_112:3">112:3</span> Wealth and riches \[shall be\] in his
house; and his righteousness abideth for ever.

<span id="an_112:4">112:4</span> Unto the upright there ariseth light in
the darkness; he is gracious, and merciful, and righteous.

<span id="an_112:5">112:5</span> It is well with the man that is
gracious and lendeth; he will sustain his cause in judgment.

<span id="an_112:6">112:6</span> For he shall not be moved for ever: the
righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.

<span id="an_112:7">112:7</span> He shall not be afraid of evil tidings;
his heart is fixed confiding in Jehovah;

<span id="an_112:8">112:8</span> His heart is maintained, he is not
afraid, until he see \[his desire\] upon his oppressors.

<span id="an_112:9">112:9</span> He scattereth abroad, he giveth to the
needy; his righteousness abideth for ever: his horn shall be exalted
with honour.

<span id="an_112:10">112:10</span> The wicked \[man\] shall see \[it\]
and be vexed; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire
of the wicked shall perish.

<span id="an_113:1">113:1</span> Hallelujah! Praise, ye servants of
Jehovah, praise the name of Jehovah.

<span id="an_113:2">113:2</span> Blessed be the name of Jehovah, from
this time forth and for evermore!

<span id="an_113:3">113:3</span> From the rising of the sun unto the
going down of the same, let Jehovah's name be praised.

<span id="an_113:4">113:4</span> Jehovah is high above all nations, his
glory above the heavens.

<span id="an_113:5">113:5</span> Who is like unto Jehovah our God, who
hath placed his dwelling on high;

<span id="an_113:6">113:6</span> Who humbleth himself to look on the
heavens and on the earth?

<span id="an_113:7">113:7</span> He raiseth up the poor out of the dust;
from the dung-hill he lifteth up the needy,

<span id="an_113:8">113:8</span> To set \[him\] among nobles, among the
nobles of his people.

<span id="an_113:9">113:9</span> He maketh the barren woman to keep
house, \[as\] a joyful mother of sons. Hallelujah!

<span id="an_114:1">114:1</span> When Israel went out of Egypt, the
house of Jacob from a people of strange language,

<span id="an_114:2">114:2</span> Judah was his sanctuary, Israel his
dominion.

<span id="an_114:3">114:3</span> The sea saw it and fled, the Jordan
turned back;

<span id="an_114:4">114:4</span> The mountains skipped like rams, the
hills like lambs.

<span id="an_114:5">114:5</span> What ailed thee, thou sea, that thou
fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou turnedst back?

<span id="an_114:6">114:6</span> Ye mountains, that ye skipped like
rams? ye hills, like lambs?

<span id="an_114:7">114:7</span> Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of
the Lord, at the presence of the +God of Jacob,

<span id="an_114:8">114:8</span> Who turned the rock into a pool of
water, the flint into a fountain of waters.

<span id="an_115:1">115:1</span> Not unto us, O Jehovah, not unto us,
but unto thy name give glory, for thy loving-kindness and for thy
truth's sake.

<span id="an_115:2">115:2</span> Wherefore should the nations say, Where
then is their God?

<span id="an_115:3">115:3</span> But our God is in the heavens: he hath
done whatsoever he pleased.

<span id="an_115:4">115:4</span> Their idols are silver and gold, the
work of men's hands:

<span id="an_115:5">115:5</span> They have a mouth, and they speak not;
eyes have they, and they see not;

<span id="an_115:6">115:6</span> They have ears, and they hear not; a
nose have they, and they smell not;

<span id="an_115:7">115:7</span> They have hands, and they handle not;
feet have they, and they walk not; they give no sound through their
throat.

<span id="an_115:8">115:8</span> They that make them are like unto them,
-- every one that confideth in them.

<span id="an_115:9">115:9</span> O Israel, confide thou in Jehovah: he
is their help and their shield.

<span id="an_115:10">115:10</span> House of Aaron, confide in Jehovah:
he is their help and their shield.

<span id="an_115:11">115:11</span> Ye that fear Jehovah, confide in
Jehovah: he is their help and their shield.

<span id="an_115:12">115:12</span> Jehovah hath been mindful of us: he
will bless, he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house
of Aaron;

<span id="an_115:13">115:13</span> He will bless them that fear Jehovah,
both the small and the great.

<span id="an_115:14">115:14</span> Jehovah will add unto you more, unto
you and unto your children.

<span id="an_115:15">115:15</span> Ye are blessed of Jehovah, who made
the heavens and the earth.

<span id="an_115:16">115:16</span> The heavens are the heavens of
Jehovah, but the earth hath he given to the children of men.

<span id="an_115:17">115:17</span> The dead praise not Jah, neither any
that go down into silence;

<span id="an_115:18">115:18</span> But \*we\* will bless Jah from this
time forth and for evermore. Hallelujah!

<span id="an_116:1">116:1</span> I love Jehovah, for he hath heard my
voice \[and\] my supplications;

<span id="an_116:2">116:2</span> For he hath inclined his ear unto me,
and I will call upon him during \[all\] my days.

<span id="an_116:3">116:3</span> The bands of death encompassed me, and
the anguish of Sheol took hold of me; I found trouble and sorrow:

<span id="an_116:4">116:4</span> Then called I upon the name of Jehovah:
I beseech thee, Jehovah, deliver my soul.

<span id="an_116:5">116:5</span> Gracious is Jehovah and righteous; and
our God is merciful.

<span id="an_116:6">116:6</span> Jehovah keepeth the simple: I was
brought low, and he saved me.

<span id="an_116:7">116:7</span> Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for
Jehovah hath dealt bountifully with thee.

<span id="an_116:8">116:8</span> For thou hast delivered my soul from
death, mine eyes from tears, my feet from falling.

<span id="an_116:9">116:9</span> I will walk before Jehovah in the land
of the living.

<span id="an_116:10">116:10</span> I believed, therefore have I spoken.
As for me, I was greatly afflicted.

<span id="an_116:11">116:11</span> I said in my haste, All men are
liars.

<span id="an_116:12">116:12</span> What shall I render unto Jehovah,
\[for\] all his benefits toward me?

<span id="an_116:13">116:13</span> I will take the cup of salvation, and
call upon the name of Jehovah.

<span id="an_116:14">116:14</span> I will perform my vows unto Jehovah,
yea, before all his people.

<span id="an_116:15">116:15</span> Precious in the sight of Jehovah is
the death of his saints.

<span id="an_116:16">116:16</span> Yea, Jehovah! for I am thy servant; I
am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.

<span id="an_116:17">116:17</span> I will offer to thee the sacrifice of
thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of Jehovah.

<span id="an_116:18">116:18</span> I will perform my vows unto Jehovah,
yea, before all his people,

<span id="an_116:19">116:19</span> In the courts of Jehovah's house, in
the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah!

<span id="an_117:1">117:1</span> Praise Jehovah, all ye nations; laud
him, all ye peoples;

<span id="an_117:2">117:2</span> For his loving-kindness is great toward
us, and the truth of Jehovah \[endureth\] for ever. Hallelujah!

<span id="an_118:1">118:1</span> Give ye thanks unto Jehovah; for he is
good; for his loving-kindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_118:2">118:2</span> Oh let Israel say, that his
loving-kindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_118:3">118:3</span> Oh let the house of Aaron say, that his
loving-kindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_118:4">118:4</span> Oh let them that fear Jehovah say, that
his loving-kindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_118:5">118:5</span> I called upon Jah in distress; Jah
answered me \[and set me\] in a large place.

<span id="an_118:6">118:6</span> Jehovah is for me, I will not fear;
what can man do unto me?

<span id="an_118:7">118:7</span> Jehovah is for me among them that help
me; and I shall see \[my desire\] upon them that hate me.

<span id="an_118:8">118:8</span> It is better to trust in Jehovah than
to put confidence in man;

<span id="an_118:9">118:9</span> It is better to trust in Jehovah than
to put confidence in nobles.

<span id="an_118:10">118:10</span> All nations encompassed me; but in
the name of Jehovah have I destroyed them.

<span id="an_118:11">118:11</span> They encompassed me, yea, encompassed
me; but in the name of Jehovah have I destroyed them.

<span id="an_118:12">118:12</span> They encompassed me like bees; they
are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of Jehovah have I
destroyed them.

<span id="an_118:13">118:13</span> Thou hast thrust hard at me that I
might fall; but Jehovah helped me.

<span id="an_118:14">118:14</span> My strength and song is Jah, and he
is become my salvation.

<span id="an_118:15">118:15</span> The voice of triumph and salvation is
in the tents of the righteous: the right hand of Jehovah doeth
valiantly;

<span id="an_118:16">118:16</span> The right hand of Jehovah is exalted,
the right hand of Jehovah doeth valiantly.

<span id="an_118:17">118:17</span> I shall not die, but live, and
declare the works of Jah.

<span id="an_118:18">118:18</span> Jah hath chastened me sore; but he
hath not given me over unto death.

<span id="an_118:19">118:19</span> Open to me the gates of
righteousness: I will enter into them; Jah will I praise.

<span id="an_118:20">118:20</span> This is the gate of Jehovah: the
righteous shall enter therein.

<span id="an_118:21">118:21</span> I will give thee thanks, for thou
hast answered me, and art become my salvation.

<span id="an_118:22">118:22</span> \[The\] stone which the builders
rejected hath become the head of the corner:

<span id="an_118:23">118:23</span> This is of Jehovah; it is wonderful
in our eyes.

<span id="an_118:24">118:24</span> This is the day that Jehovah hath
made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.

<span id="an_118:25">118:25</span> Oh save, Jehovah, I beseech thee;
Jehovah, I beseech thee, oh send prosperity!

<span id="an_118:26">118:26</span> Blessed be he that cometh in the name
of Jehovah. We have blessed you out of the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_118:27">118:27</span> Jehovah is ùGod, and he hath given us
light: bind the sacrifice with cords, -- up to the horns of the altar.

<span id="an_118:28">118:28</span> Thou art my ùGod, and I will give
thee thanks; my God, I will exalt thee.

<span id="an_118:29">118:29</span> Give ye thanks unto Jehovah; for he
is good; for his loving-kindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_119:1">119:1</span> ALEPH. Blessed are the perfect in the
way, who walk in the law of Jehovah.

<span id="an_119:2">119:2</span> Blessed are they that observe his
testimonies, that seek him with the whole heart;

<span id="an_119:3">119:3</span> Who also do no unrighteousness: they
walk in his ways.

<span id="an_119:4">119:4</span> Thou hast enjoined thy precepts, to be
kept diligently.

<span id="an_119:5">119:5</span> Oh that my ways were directed to keep
thy statutes!

<span id="an_119:6">119:6</span> Then shall I not be ashamed, when I
have respect unto all thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:7">119:7</span> I will give thee thanks with
uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.

<span id="an_119:8">119:8</span> I will keep thy statutes: forsake me
not utterly.

<span id="an_119:9">119:9</span> BETH. Wherewithal shall a young man
cleanse his path? by taking heed according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:10">119:10</span> With my whole heart have I sought
thee: let me not wander from thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:11">119:11</span> Thy ùword have I hid in my heart,
that I might not sin against thee.

<span id="an_119:12">119:12</span> Blessed art thou, Jehovah! teach me
thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:13">119:13</span> With my lips have I declared all the
judgments of thy mouth.

<span id="an_119:14">119:14</span> I have rejoiced in the way of thy
testimonies, as \[much as\] in all wealth.

<span id="an_119:15">119:15</span> I will meditate upon thy precepts,
and have respect unto thy paths.

<span id="an_119:16">119:16</span> I delight myself in thy statutes; I
will not forget thy word.

<span id="an_119:17">119:17</span> GIMEL. Deal bountifully with thy
servant \[and\] I shall live; and I will keep thy word.

<span id="an_119:18">119:18</span> Open mine eyes, and I shall behold
wondrous things out of thy law.

<span id="an_119:19">119:19</span> I am a stranger in the land; hide not
thy commandments from me.

<span id="an_119:20">119:20</span> My soul breaketh for longing after
thy judgments at all times.

<span id="an_119:21">119:21</span> Thou hast rebuked the proud \[that
are\] cursed, who wander from thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:22">119:22</span> Roll off from me reproach and
contempt; for I observe thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:23">119:23</span> Princes also did sit \[and\] talk
together against me: thy servant doth meditate in thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:24">119:24</span> Thy testimonies also are my delight
\[and\] my counsellors.

<span id="an_119:25">119:25</span> DALETH. My soul cleaveth unto the
dust: quicken me according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:26">119:26</span> I have declared my ways, and thou
hast answered me: teach me thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:27">119:27</span> Make me to understand the way of thy
precepts, and I will meditate upon thy wondrous works.

<span id="an_119:28">119:28</span> My soul melteth for sadness:
strengthen me according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:29">119:29</span> Remove from me the way of falsehood,
and graciously grant me thy law.

<span id="an_119:30">119:30</span> I have chosen the way of
faithfulness; thy judgments have I set \[before me\].

<span id="an_119:31">119:31</span> I cleave unto thy testimonies;
Jehovah, let me not be ashamed.

<span id="an_119:32">119:32</span> I will run the way of thy
commandments when thou shalt enlarge my heart.

<span id="an_119:33">119:33</span> HE. Teach me, O Jehovah, the way of
thy statutes, and I will observe it \[unto\] the end.

<span id="an_119:34">119:34</span> Give me understanding, and I will
observe thy law; and I will keep it with \[my\] whole heart.

<span id="an_119:35">119:35</span> Make me to walk in the path of thy
commandments; for therein do I delight.

<span id="an_119:36">119:36</span> Incline my heart unto thy
testimonies, and not to gain.

<span id="an_119:37">119:37</span> Turn away mine eyes from beholding
vanity; quicken me in thy way.

<span id="an_119:38">119:38</span> Establish thy ùword unto thy servant,
who is \[devoted\] to thy fear.

<span id="an_119:39">119:39</span> Turn away my reproach which I fear;
for thy judgments are good.

<span id="an_119:40">119:40</span> Behold, I have longed after thy
precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.

<span id="an_119:41">119:41</span> VAU. And let thy loving-kindness come
unto me, O Jehovah, -- thy salvation according to thy ùword.

<span id="an_119:42">119:42</span> So shall I have wherewith to answer
him that reproacheth me; for I confide in thy word.

<span id="an_119:43">119:43</span> And take not the word of truth
utterly out of my mouth; because I have hoped in thy judgments.

<span id="an_119:44">119:44</span> Then will I keep thy law continually,
for ever and ever;

<span id="an_119:45">119:45</span> And I will walk at liberty, for I
have sought thy precepts;

<span id="an_119:46">119:46</span> And I will speak of thy testimonies
before kings, and will not be ashamed;

<span id="an_119:47">119:47</span> And I will delight myself in thy
commandments, which I have loved;

<span id="an_119:48">119:48</span> And I will lift up my hands unto thy
commandments, which I have loved, and I will meditate in thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:49">119:49</span> ZAIN. Remember the word for thy
servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.

<span id="an_119:50">119:50</span> This is my comfort in mine
affliction; for thy ùword hath quickened me.

<span id="an_119:51">119:51</span> The proud have derided me beyond
measure: I have not declined from thy law.

<span id="an_119:52">119:52</span> I remembered thy judgments of old, O
Jehovah, and have comforted myself.

<span id="an_119:53">119:53</span> Burning indignation hath taken hold
upon me because of the wicked who forsake thy law.

<span id="an_119:54">119:54</span> Thy statutes have been my songs in
the house of my pilgrimage.

<span id="an_119:55">119:55</span> I have remembered thy name, O
Jehovah, in the night, and have kept thy law.

<span id="an_119:56">119:56</span> This I have had, because I have
observed thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:57">119:57</span> CHETH. My portion, O Jehovah, I have
said, is to keep thy words.

<span id="an_119:58">119:58</span> I have sought thy favour with \[my\]
whole heart: be gracious unto me according to thy ùword.

<span id="an_119:59">119:59</span> I have thought on my ways, and turned
my feet unto thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:60">119:60</span> I have made haste, and not delayed,
to keep thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:61">119:61</span> The bands of the wicked have wrapped
me round: I have not forgotten thy law.

<span id="an_119:62">119:62</span> At midnight I rise up to give thanks
unto thee, because of thy righteous judgments.

<span id="an_119:63">119:63</span> I am the companion of all that fear
thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:64">119:64</span> The earth, O Jehovah, is full of thy
loving-kindness: teach me thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:65">119:65</span> TETH. Thou hast dealt well with thy
servant, O Jehovah, according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:66">119:66</span> Teach me good discernment and
knowledge; for I have believed in thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:67">119:67</span> Before I was afflicted I went astray,
but now I keep thy ùword.

<span id="an_119:68">119:68</span> Thou art good, and doest good; teach
me thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:69">119:69</span> The proud have forged falsehood
against me: I will observe thy precepts with \[my\] whole heart.

<span id="an_119:70">119:70</span> Their heart is as fat as grease: as
for me, I delight in thy law.

<span id="an_119:71">119:71</span> It is good for me that I have been
afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:72">119:72</span> The law of thy mouth is better unto
me than thousands of gold and silver.

<span id="an_119:73">119:73</span> YOD. Thy hands have made me and
fashioned me: give me understanding, and I will learn thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:74">119:74</span> They that fear thee will see me, and
rejoice; because I have hoped in thy word.

<span id="an_119:75">119:75</span> I know, Jehovah, that thy Judgments
are righteousness, and that in faithfulness thou hast afflicted me.

<span id="an_119:76">119:76</span> Oh let thy loving-kindness be for my
comfort, according to thy ùword unto thy servant.

<span id="an_119:77">119:77</span> Let thy tender mercies come unto me,
that I may live; for thy law is my delight.

<span id="an_119:78">119:78</span> Let the proud be ashamed; for they
have acted perversely towards me with falsehood: as for me, I meditate
in thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:79">119:79</span> Let those that fear thee turn unto
me, and those that know thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:80">119:80</span> Let my heart be perfect in thy
statutes, that I be not ashamed.

<span id="an_119:81">119:81</span> CAPH. My soul fainteth for thy
salvation; I hope in thy word.

<span id="an_119:82">119:82</span> Mine eyes fail for thy ùword, saying,
When wilt thou comfort me?

<span id="an_119:83">119:83</span> For I am become like a bottle in the
smoke; I do not forget thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:84">119:84</span> How many shall be the days of thy
servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?

<span id="an_119:85">119:85</span> The proud have digged pits for me,
which is not according to thy law.

<span id="an_119:86">119:86</span> All thy commandments are
faithfulness. They persecute me wrongfully: help thou me.

<span id="an_119:87">119:87</span> They had almost consumed me upon the
earth; but as for me, I forsook not thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:88">119:88</span> Quicken me according to thy
loving-kindness, and I will keep the testimony of thy mouth.

<span id="an_119:89">119:89</span> LAMED. For ever, O Jehovah, thy word
is settled in the heavens.

<span id="an_119:90">119:90</span> Thy faithfulness is from generation
to generation: thou hast established the earth, and it standeth.

<span id="an_119:91">119:91</span> By thine ordinances they stand this
day; for all things are thy servants.

<span id="an_119:92">119:92</span> Unless thy law had been my delight, I
should then have perished in mine affliction.

<span id="an_119:93">119:93</span> I will never forget thy precepts; for
by them thou hast quickened me.

<span id="an_119:94">119:94</span> I am thine, save me; for I have
sought thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:95">119:95</span> The wicked have awaited me to destroy
me; \[but\] I attend unto thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:96">119:96</span> I have seen an end of all perfection:
thy commandment is exceeding broad.

<span id="an_119:97">119:97</span> MEM. Oh how I love thy law! it is my
meditation all the day.

<span id="an_119:98">119:98</span> Thy commandments make me wiser than
mine enemies; for they are ever with me.

<span id="an_119:99">119:99</span> I have more understanding than all my
teachers; for thy testimonies are my meditation.

<span id="an_119:100">119:100</span> I understand more than the aged,
because I have observed thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:101">119:101</span> I have refrained my feet from every
evil path, that I might keep thy word.

<span id="an_119:102">119:102</span> I have not departed from thy
judgments; for it is thou that hast taught me.

<span id="an_119:103">119:103</span> How sweet are thy ùwords unto my
taste! more than honey to my mouth!

<span id="an_119:104">119:104</span> From thy precepts I get
understanding; therefore I hate every false path.

<span id="an_119:105">119:105</span> NUN. Thy word is a lamp unto my
feet, and a light unto my path.

<span id="an_119:106">119:106</span> I have sworn, and I will perform
it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.

<span id="an_119:107">119:107</span> I am afflicted very much; O
Jehovah, quicken me according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:108">119:108</span> Accept, I beseech thee, Jehovah,
the voluntary-offerings of my mouth, and teach me thy judgments.

<span id="an_119:109">119:109</span> My life is continually in my hand;
but I do not forget thy law.

<span id="an_119:110">119:110</span> The wicked have laid a snare for
me; but I have not wandered from thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:111">119:111</span> Thy testimonies have I taken as a
heritage for ever; for they are the rejoicing of my heart.

<span id="an_119:112">119:112</span> I have inclined my heart to perform
thy statutes for ever, unto the end.

<span id="an_119:113">119:113</span> SAMECH. The double-minded have I
hated; but thy law do I love.

<span id="an_119:114">119:114</span> Thou art my hiding-place and my
shield: I hope in thy word.

<span id="an_119:115">119:115</span> Depart from me, ye evil-doers; and
I will observe the commandments of my God.

<span id="an_119:116">119:116</span> Uphold me according to thy ùword,
that I may live; and let me not be ashamed of my hope.

<span id="an_119:117">119:117</span> Hold thou me up, and I shall be
safe; and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.

<span id="an_119:118">119:118</span> Thou hast set at nought all them
that wander from thy statutes; for their deceit is falsehood.

<span id="an_119:119">119:119</span> Thou puttest away all the wicked of
the earth \[like\] dross; therefore I love thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:120">119:120</span> My flesh shuddereth for fear of
thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.

<span id="an_119:121">119:121</span> AIN. I have done judgment and
justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.

<span id="an_119:122">119:122</span> Be surety for thy servant for good;
let not the proud oppress me.

<span id="an_119:123">119:123</span> Mine eyes fail for thy salvation,
and for the ùword of thy righteousness.

<span id="an_119:124">119:124</span> Deal with thy servant according to
thy loving-kindness, and teach me thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:125">119:125</span> I am thy servant; give me
understanding that I may know thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:126">119:126</span> It is time for Jehovah to work:
they have made void thy law.

<span id="an_119:127">119:127</span> Therefore I love thy commandments
above gold, yea, above fine gold.

<span id="an_119:128">119:128</span> Therefore I regard all \[thy\]
precepts concerning all things to be right: I hate every false path.

<span id="an_119:129">119:129</span> PE. Thy testimonies are wonderful;
therefore doth my soul observe them.

<span id="an_119:130">119:130</span> The entrance of thy words giveth
light, giving understanding unto the simple.

<span id="an_119:131">119:131</span> I opened my mouth wide and panted;
for I longed for thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:132">119:132</span> Turn unto me, and be gracious unto
me, as thou art wont to do unto those that love thy name.

<span id="an_119:133">119:133</span> Establish my steps in thy ùword;
and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.

<span id="an_119:134">119:134</span> Deliver me from the oppression of
man; and I will keep thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:135">119:135</span> Make thy face to shine upon thy
servant, and teach me thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:136">119:136</span> Mine eyes run down with streams of
water, because they keep not thy law.

<span id="an_119:137">119:137</span> TZADE. Righteous art thou, Jehovah,
and upright are thy judgments.

<span id="an_119:138">119:138</span> Thou hast commanded thy testimonies
in righteousness and exceeding faithfulness.

<span id="an_119:139">119:139</span> My zeal destroyeth me, because mine
oppressors have forgotten thy words.

<span id="an_119:140">119:140</span> Thy ùword is exceeding pure, and
thy servant loveth it.

<span id="an_119:141">119:141</span> I am little and despised: thy
precepts have I not forgotten.

<span id="an_119:142">119:142</span> Thy righteousness is an everlasting
righteousness, and thy law is truth.

<span id="an_119:143">119:143</span> Trouble and anguish have taken hold
upon me: thy commandments are my delights.

<span id="an_119:144">119:144</span> The righteousness of thy
testimonies is for ever: give me understanding, and I shall live.

<span id="an_119:145">119:145</span> KOPH. I have called with \[my\]
whole heart; answer me, O Jehovah: I will observe thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:146">119:146</span> I call upon thee; save me, and I
will keep thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:147">119:147</span> I anticipate the morning-dawn and I
cry: I hope in thy word.

<span id="an_119:148">119:148</span> Mine eyes anticipate the
night-watches, that I may meditate in thy ùword.

<span id="an_119:149">119:149</span> Hear my voice according to thy
loving-kindness: O Jehovah, quicken me according to thy judgment.

<span id="an_119:150">119:150</span> They have drawn nigh that follow
after mischief: they are far from thy law.

<span id="an_119:151">119:151</span> Thou, Jehovah, art near, and all
thy commandments are truth.

<span id="an_119:152">119:152</span> From thy testimonies, I have known
of old that thou hast founded them for ever.

<span id="an_119:153">119:153</span> RESH. See mine affliction, and
deliver me; for I have not forgotten thy law.

<span id="an_119:154">119:154</span> Plead my cause, and redeem me:
quicken me according to thy ùword.

<span id="an_119:155">119:155</span> Salvation is far from the wicked;
for they seek not thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:156">119:156</span> Many are thy tender mercies, O
Jehovah; quicken me according to thy judgments.

<span id="an_119:157">119:157</span> Many are my persecutors and mine
oppressors; I have not declined from thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:158">119:158</span> I beheld them that deal
treacherously, and was grieved; because they kept not thy ùword.

<span id="an_119:159">119:159</span> See how I have loved thy precepts:
quicken me, O Jehovah, according to thy loving-kindness.

<span id="an_119:160">119:160</span> The sum of thy word is truth, and
every righteous judgment of thine is for ever.

<span id="an_119:161">119:161</span> SHIN. Princes have persecuted me
without a cause; but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.

<span id="an_119:162">119:162</span> I have joy in thy ùword, as one
that findeth great spoil.

<span id="an_119:163">119:163</span> I hate and abhor falsehood; thy law
do I love.

<span id="an_119:164">119:164</span> Seven times a day do I praise thee
because of thy righteous judgments.

<span id="an_119:165">119:165</span> Great peace have they that love thy
law, and nothing doth stumble them.

<span id="an_119:166">119:166</span> I have hoped for thy salvation, O
Jehovah, and have done thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:167">119:167</span> My soul hath kept thy testimonies,
and I love them exceedingly.

<span id="an_119:168">119:168</span> I have kept thy precepts and thy
testimonies; for all my ways are before thee.

<span id="an_119:169">119:169</span> TAU. Let my cry come near before
thee, Jehovah: give me understanding according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:170">119:170</span> Let my supplication come before
thee: deliver me according to thy ùword.

<span id="an_119:171">119:171</span> My lips shall pour forth praise
when thou hast taught me thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:172">119:172</span> My tongue shall speak aloud of thy
ùword; for all thy commandments are righteousness.

<span id="an_119:173">119:173</span> Let thy hand be for my help; for I
have chosen thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:174">119:174</span> I have longed for thy salvation, O
Jehovah, and thy law is my delight.

<span id="an_119:175">119:175</span> Let my soul live, and it shall
praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.

<span id="an_119:176">119:176</span> I have gone astray like a lost
sheep: seek thy servant; for I have not forgotten thy commandments.

<span id="an_120:1">120:1</span> {A Song of degrees.} In my trouble I
called unto Jehovah, and he answered me.

<span id="an_120:2">120:2</span> Jehovah, deliver my soul from the lying
lip, from the deceitful tongue.

<span id="an_120:3">120:3</span> What shall be given unto thee, what
shall be added unto thee, thou deceitful tongue?

<span id="an_120:4">120:4</span> Sharp arrows of a mighty one, with
burning coals of broom-wood.

<span id="an_120:5">120:5</span> Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech,
that I dwell among the tents of Kedar!

<span id="an_120:6">120:6</span> My soul hath long dwelt with them that
hate peace.

<span id="an_120:7">120:7</span> I \[am for\] peace; but when I speak,
\*they\* \[are\] for war.

<span id="an_121:1">121:1</span> {A Song of degrees.} I lift up mine
eyes unto the mountains: whence shall my help come?

<span id="an_121:2">121:2</span> My help \[cometh\] from Jehovah, who
made the heavens and the earth.

<span id="an_121:3">121:3</span> He will not suffer thy foot to be
moved; he that keepeth thee will not slumber.

<span id="an_121:4">121:4</span> Behold, he that keepeth Israel will
neither slumber nor sleep.

<span id="an_121:5">121:5</span> Jehovah is thy keeper, Jehovah is thy
shade upon thy right hand;

<span id="an_121:6">121:6</span> The sun shall not smite thee by day,
nor the moon by night.

<span id="an_121:7">121:7</span> Jehovah will keep thee from all evil;
he will keep thy soul.

<span id="an_121:8">121:8</span> Jehovah will keep thy going out and thy
coming in, from henceforth and for evermore.

<span id="an_122:1">122:1</span> {A Song of degrees. Of David.} I
rejoiced when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_122:2">122:2</span> Our feet shall stand within thy gates,
O Jerusalem.

<span id="an_122:3">122:3</span> Jerusalem, which art built as a city
that is compact together,

<span id="an_122:4">122:4</span> Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of
Jah, a testimony to Israel, to give thanks unto the name of Jehovah.

<span id="an_122:5">122:5</span> For there are set thrones for judgment,
the thrones of the house of David.

<span id="an_122:6">122:6</span> Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they
shall prosper that love thee.

<span id="an_122:7">122:7</span> Peace be within thy bulwarks,
prosperity within thy palaces.

<span id="an_122:8">122:8</span> For my brethren and companions' sakes I
will say, Peace be within thee!

<span id="an_122:9">122:9</span> Because of the house of Jehovah our God
I will seek thy good.

<span id="an_123:1">123:1</span> {A Song of degrees.} Unto thee do I
lift up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.

<span id="an_123:2">123:2</span> Behold, as the eyes of servants
\[look\] unto the hand of their masters, as the eyes of a maiden unto
the hand of her mistress, so our eyes \[are directed\] to Jehovah our
God, until he be gracious unto us.

<span id="an_123:3">123:3</span> Be gracious unto us, O Jehovah, be
gracious unto us; for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.

<span id="an_123:4">123:4</span> Our soul is exceedingly filled with the
scorning of those that are at ease, with the contempt of the proud.

<span id="an_124:1">124:1</span> {A Song of degrees. Of David.} If it
had not been Jehovah who was for us -- oh let Israel say --

<span id="an_124:2">124:2</span> If it had not been Jehovah who was for
us, when men rose up against us,

<span id="an_124:3">124:3</span> Then they had swallowed us up alive,
when their anger was kindled against us;

<span id="an_124:4">124:4</span> Then the waters had overwhelmed us, a
torrent had gone over our soul;

<span id="an_124:5">124:5</span> Then the proud waters had gone over our
soul.

<span id="an_124:6">124:6</span> Blessed be Jehovah, who gave us not up
a prey to their teeth!

<span id="an_124:7">124:7</span> Our soul is escaped as a bird out of
the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we have escaped.

<span id="an_124:8">124:8</span> Our help is in the name of Jehovah, the
maker of heavens and earth.

<span id="an_125:1">125:1</span> {A Song of degrees.} They that confide
in Jehovah are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved; it abideth for
ever.

<span id="an_125:2">125:2</span> Jerusalem! -- mountains are round about
her, and Jehovah is round about his people, from henceforth and for
evermore.

<span id="an_125:3">125:3</span> For the sceptre of wickedness shall not
rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their
hands unto iniquity.

<span id="an_125:4">125:4</span> Do good, O Jehovah, unto the good, and
to them that are upright in their hearts.

<span id="an_125:5">125:5</span> But as for such as turn aside unto
their crooked ways, Jehovah will lead them forth with the workers of
iniquity. Peace be upon Israel!

<span id="an_126:1">126:1</span> {A Song of degrees.} When Jehovah
turned the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.

<span id="an_126:2">126:2</span> Then was our mouth filled with
laughter, and our tongue with rejoicing: then said they among the
nations, Jehovah hath done great things for them.

<span id="an_126:3">126:3</span> Jehovah hath done great things for us;
\[and\] we are joyful.

<span id="an_126:4">126:4</span> Turn our captivity, O Jehovah, as the
streams in the south.

<span id="an_126:5">126:5</span> They that sow in tears shall reap with
rejoicing:

<span id="an_126:6">126:6</span> He goeth forth and weepeth, bearing
seed for scattering; he cometh again with rejoicing, bearing his
sheaves.

<span id="an_127:1">127:1</span> {A Song of degrees. Of Solomon.} Unless
Jehovah build the house, in vain do its builders labour in it; unless
Jehovah keep the city, the keeper watcheth in vain:

<span id="an_127:2">127:2</span> It is vain for you to rise up early, to
lie down late, to eat the bread of sorrows: so to his beloved one he
giveth sleep.

<span id="an_127:3">127:3</span> Lo, children are an inheritance from
Jehovah, \[and\] the fruit of the womb a reward.

<span id="an_127:4">127:4</span> As arrows in the hand of a mighty man,
so are the children of youth.

<span id="an_127:5">127:5</span> Happy is the man that hath filled his
quiver with them. They shall not be ashamed when they speak with enemies
in the gate.

<span id="an_128:1">128:1</span> {A Song of degrees.} Blessed is every
one that feareth Jehovah, that walketh in his ways.

<span id="an_128:2">128:2</span> For thou shalt eat the labour of thy
hands; happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.

<span id="an_128:3">128:3</span> Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine in
the inner part of thy house; thy children like olive-plants round about
thy table.

<span id="an_128:4">128:4</span> Behold, thus shall the man be blessed
that feareth Jehovah.

<span id="an_128:5">128:5</span> Jehovah will bless thee out of Zion;
and mayest thou see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life,

<span id="an_128:6">128:6</span> And see thy children's children. Peace
be upon Israel!

<span id="an_129:1">129:1</span> {A Song of degrees.} Many a time have
they afflicted me from my youth -- oh let Israel say --

<span id="an_129:2">129:2</span> Many a time have they afflicted me from
my youth; yet they have not prevailed against me.

<span id="an_129:3">129:3</span> The ploughers ploughed upon my back;
they made long their furrows.

<span id="an_129:4">129:4</span> Jehovah is righteous: he hath cut
asunder the cords of the wicked.

<span id="an_129:5">129:5</span> Let them be ashamed and turned
backward, all that hate Zion;

<span id="an_129:6">129:6</span> Let them be as the grass upon the
house-tops, which withereth before it is plucked up,

<span id="an_129:7">129:7</span> Wherewith the mower filleth not his
hand, nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom;

<span id="an_129:8">129:8</span> Neither do the passers-by say, The
blessing of Jehovah be upon you; we bless you in the name of Jehovah!

<span id="an_130:1">130:1</span> {A Song of degrees.} Out of the depths
do I call upon thee, Jehovah.

<span id="an_130:2">130:2</span> Lord, hear my voice; let thine ears be
attentive to the voice of my supplication.

<span id="an_130:3">130:3</span> If thou, Jah, shouldest mark
iniquities, Lord, who shall stand?

<span id="an_130:4">130:4</span> But there is forgiveness with thee,
that thou mayest be feared.

<span id="an_130:5">130:5</span> I wait for Jehovah; my soul doth wait,
and in his word do I hope.

<span id="an_130:6">130:6</span> My soul \[waiteth\] for the Lord more
than the watchers \[wait\] for the morning, \[more than\] the watchers
for the morning.

<span id="an_130:7">130:7</span> Let Israel hope in Jehovah, because
with Jehovah there is loving-kindness, and with him is plenteous
redemption;

<span id="an_130:8">130:8</span> And he will redeem Israel from all his
iniquities.

<span id="an_131:1">131:1</span> {A Song of degrees. Of David.} Jehovah,
my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; neither do I exercise
myself in great matters, and in things too wonderful for me.

<span id="an_131:2">131:2</span> Surely I have restrained and composed
my soul, like a weaned child with its mother: my soul within me is as a
weaned child.

<span id="an_131:3">131:3</span> Let Israel hope in Jehovah, from
henceforth and for evermore.

<span id="an_132:1">132:1</span> {A Song of degrees.} Jehovah, remember
for David all his affliction;

<span id="an_132:2">132:2</span> How he swore unto Jehovah, vowed unto
the Mighty One of Jacob:

<span id="an_132:3">132:3</span> I will not come into the tent of my
house, I will not go up to the couch of my bed;

<span id="an_132:4">132:4</span> I will not give sleep to mine eyes,
slumber to mine eyelids,

<span id="an_132:5">132:5</span> Until I find out a place for Jehovah,
habitations for the Mighty One of Jacob. ...

<span id="an_132:6">132:6</span> Behold, we heard of it at Ephratah, we
found it in the fields of the wood.

<span id="an_132:7">132:7</span> Let us go into his habitations, let us
worship at his footstool.

<span id="an_132:8">132:8</span> Arise, Jehovah, into thy rest, thou and
the ark of thy strength.

<span id="an_132:9">132:9</span> Let thy priests be clothed with
righteousness, and let thy saints shout for joy.

<span id="an_132:10">132:10</span> For thy servant David's sake, turn
not away the face of thine anointed.

<span id="an_132:11">132:11</span> Jehovah hath sworn \[in\] truth unto
David; he will not turn from it: Of the fruit of thy body will I set
upon thy throne;

<span id="an_132:12">132:12</span> If thy children keep my covenant, and
my testimonies which I will teach them, their children also for evermore
shall sit upon thy throne.

<span id="an_132:13">132:13</span> For Jehovah hath chosen Zion; he hath
desired it for his dwelling:

<span id="an_132:14">132:14</span> This is my rest for ever; here will I
dwell, for I have desired it.

<span id="an_132:15">132:15</span> I will abundantly bless her
provision; I will satisfy her needy ones with bread;

<span id="an_132:16">132:16</span> And I will clothe her priests with
salvation, and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.

<span id="an_132:17">132:17</span> There will I cause the horn of David
to bud forth; I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.

<span id="an_132:18">132:18</span> His enemies will I clothe with shame;
but upon himself shall his crown flourish.

<span id="an_133:1">133:1</span> {A Song of degrees. Of David.} Behold,
how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!

<span id="an_133:2">133:2</span> Like the precious oil upon the head,
that ran down upon the beard, upon Aaron's beard, that ran down to the
hem of his garments;

<span id="an_133:3">133:3</span> As the dew of Hermon that descendeth on
the mountains of Zion; for there hath Jehovah commanded the blessing,
life for evermore.

<span id="an_134:1">134:1</span> {A Song of degrees.} Behold, bless
Jehovah, all ye servants of Jehovah, who by night stand in the house of
Jehovah.

<span id="an_134:2">134:2</span> Lift up your hands in the sanctuary,
and bless Jehovah.

<span id="an_134:3">134:3</span> Jehovah, the maker of heavens and
earth, bless thee out of Zion.

<span id="an_135:1">135:1</span> Hallelujah! Praise the name of Jehovah;
praise, ye servants of Jehovah,

<span id="an_135:2">135:2</span> Ye that stand in the house of Jehovah,
in the courts of the house of our God.

<span id="an_135:3">135:3</span> Praise ye Jah; for Jehovah is good:
sing psalms unto his name; for it is pleasant.

<span id="an_135:4">135:4</span> For Jah hath chosen Jacob unto himself,
Israel for his own possession.

<span id="an_135:5">135:5</span> For \*I\* know that Jehovah is great,
and our Lord is above all gods.

<span id="an_135:6">135:6</span> Whatsoever Jehovah pleased, he hath
done in the heavens and on the earth, in the seas and all deeps;

<span id="an_135:7">135:7</span> Who causeth the vapours to ascend from
the ends of the earth; who maketh lightnings for the rain; who bringeth
the wind out of his treasuries:

<span id="an_135:8">135:8</span> Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both
of man and beast;

<span id="an_135:9">135:9</span> Who sent signs and miracles into the
midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh and upon all his servants;

<span id="an_135:10">135:10</span> Who smote great nations, and slew
mighty kings,

<span id="an_135:11">135:11</span> Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og
king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan;

<span id="an_135:12">135:12</span> And gave their land for an
inheritance, an inheritance unto Israel his people.

<span id="an_135:13">135:13</span> Thy name, O Jehovah, is for ever; thy
memorial, O Jehovah, from generation to generation.

<span id="an_135:14">135:14</span> For Jehovah will judge his people,
and will repent in favour of his servants.

<span id="an_135:15">135:15</span> The idols of the nations are silver
and gold, the work of men's hands:

<span id="an_135:16">135:16</span> They have a mouth, and they speak
not; eyes have they, and they see not;

<span id="an_137:1">137:1</span> By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat
down; yea, we wept when we remembered Zion.

<span id="an_137:2">137:2</span> We hanged our harps upon the willows in
the midst thereof.

<span id="an_137:3">137:3</span> For there they that carried us away
captive required of us a song; and they that made us wail \[required\]
mirth, \[saying,\] Sing us \[one\] of the songs of Zion.

<span id="an_137:4">137:4</span> How should we sing a song of Jehovah's
upon a foreign soil?

<span id="an_137:5">137:5</span> If I forget thee, Jerusalem, let my
right hand forget \[its skill\];

<span id="an_137:6">137:6</span> If I do not remember thee, let my
tongue cleave to my palate: if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief
joy.

<span id="an_137:7">137:7</span> Remember, O Jehovah, against the sons
of Edom, the day of Jerusalem; who said, Lay \[it\] bare, Lay \[it\]
bare, down to its foundation!

<span id="an_137:8">137:8</span> Daughter of Babylon, who art to be laid
waste, happy he that rendereth unto thee that which thou hast meted out
to us.

<span id="an_137:9">137:9</span> Happy he that taketh and dasheth thy
little ones against the rock.

<span id="an_138:1">138:1</span> {\[A Psalm\] of David.} I will give
thee thanks with my whole heart; before the gods will I sing psalms of
thee.

<span id="an_138:2">138:2</span> I will bow down toward the temple of
thy holiness, and celebrate thy name for thy loving-kindness and for thy
truth; for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.

<span id="an_138:3">138:3</span> In the day when I called thou
answeredst me; thou didst encourage me with strength in my soul.

<span id="an_138:4">138:4</span> All the kings of the earth shall
celebrate thee, Jehovah, when they have heard the words of thy mouth;

<span id="an_138:5">138:5</span> And they shall sing in the ways of
Jehovah, for great is the glory of Jehovah.

<span id="an_138:6">138:6</span> For Jehovah is high; but he looketh
upon the lowly, and the proud he knoweth afar off.

<span id="an_138:7">138:7</span> Though I walk in the midst of trouble,
thou wilt revive me: thou wilt stretch forth thy hand against the anger
of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.

<span id="an_138:8">138:8</span> Jehovah will perfect what concerneth
me: thy loving-kindness, O Jehovah, \[endureth\] for ever; forsake not
the works of thine own hands.

<span id="an_139:1">139:1</span> {To the chief Musician. A Psalm of
David.} Jehovah, thou hast searched me, and known \[me\].

<span id="an_139:2">139:2</span> \*Thou\* knowest my down-sitting and
mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off;

<span id="an_139:3">139:3</span> Thou searchest out my path and my lying
down, and art acquainted with all my ways;

<span id="an_139:4">139:4</span> For there is not yet a word on my
tongue, \[but\] lo, O Jehovah, thou knowest it altogether.

<span id="an_139:5">139:5</span> Thou hast beset me behind and before,
and laid thy hand upon me.

<span id="an_139:6">139:6</span> O knowledge too wonderful for me! it is
high, I cannot \[attain\] unto it.

<span id="an_139:7">139:7</span> Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? and
whither flee from thy presence?

<span id="an_139:8">139:8</span> If I ascend up into the heavens thou
art there; or if I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou \[art there\];

<span id="an_139:9">139:9</span> \[If\] I take the wings of the dawn
\[and\] dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,

<span id="an_139:10">139:10</span> Even there shall thy hand lead me,
and thy right hand shall hold me.

<span id="an_139:11">139:11</span> And if I say, Surely darkness shall
cover me, and the light about me be night;

<span id="an_139:12">139:12</span> Even darkness hideth not from thee,
and the night shineth as the day: the darkness is as the light.

<span id="an_139:13">139:13</span> For thou hast possessed my reins;
thou didst cover me in my mother's womb.

<span id="an_139:14">139:14</span> I will praise thee, for I am
fearfully, wonderfully made. Marvellous are thy works; and \[that\] my
soul knoweth right well.

<span id="an_139:15">139:15</span> My bones were not hidden from thee
when I was made in secret, curiously wrought in the lower parts of the
earth.

<span id="an_139:16">139:16</span> Thine eyes did see my unformed
substance, and in thy book all \[my members\] were written; \[during
many\] days were they fashioned, when \[as yet\] there was none of them.

<span id="an_139:17">139:17</span> But how precious are thy thoughts
unto me, O ùGod! how great is the sum of them!

<span id="an_139:18">139:18</span> \[If\] I would count them, they are
more in number than the sand. When I awake, I am still with thee.

<span id="an_139:19">139:19</span> Oh that thou wouldest slay the
wicked, O +God! And ye men of blood, depart from me.

<span id="an_139:20">139:20</span> For they speak of thee wickedly, they
take \[thy name\] in vain, thine enemies.

<span id="an_139:21">139:21</span> Do not I hate them, O Jehovah, that
hate thee? and do not I loathe them that rise up against thee?

<span id="an_139:22">139:22</span> I hate them with perfect hatred; I
account them mine enemies.

<span id="an_139:23">139:23</span> Search me, O ùGod, and know my heart;
prove me, and know my thoughts;

<span id="an_139:24">139:24</span> And see if there be any grievous way
in me; and lead me in the way everlasting.

<span id="an_140:1">140:1</span> {To the chief Musician. A Psalm of
David.} Free me, O Jehovah, from the evil man; preserve me from the
violent man:

<span id="an_140:2">140:2</span> Who devise mischiefs in \[their\]
heart; every day are they banded together for war.

<span id="an_140:3">140:3</span> They sharpen their tongues like a
serpent; adders' poison is under their lips. Selah.

<span id="an_140:4">140:4</span> Keep me, O Jehovah, from the hands of
the wicked \[man\], preserve me from the violent man, who devise to
overthrow my steps.

<span id="an_140:5">140:5</span> The proud have hidden a snare for me,
and cords; they have spread a net by the way-side; they have set traps
for me. Selah.

<span id="an_140:6">140:6</span> I have said unto Jehovah, Thou art my
ùGod: give ear, O Jehovah, to the voice of my supplications.

<span id="an_140:7">140:7</span> Jehovah, the Lord, is the strength of
my salvation: thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.

<span id="an_140:8">140:8</span> Grant not, O Jehovah, the desire of the
wicked; further not his device: they would exalt themselves. Selah.

<span id="an_140:9">140:9</span> \[As for\] the head of those that
encompass me, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.

<span id="an_140:10">140:10</span> Let burning coals fall on them; let
them be cast into the fire; into deep waters, that they rise not up
again.

<span id="an_140:11">140:11</span> Let not the man of \[evil\] tongue be
established in the earth: evil shall hunt the man of violence to \[his\]
ruin.

<span id="an_140:12">140:12</span> I know that Jehovah will maintain the
cause of the afflicted one, the right of the needy.

<span id="an_140:13">140:13</span> Yea, the righteous shall give thanks
unto thy name; the upright shall dwell in thy presence.

<span id="an_141:1">141:1</span> {A Psalm of David.} Jehovah, I have
called upon thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I
call unto thee.

<span id="an_141:2">141:2</span> Let my prayer be set forth before thee
as incense, the lifting up of my hands as the evening oblation.

<span id="an_141:3">141:3</span> Set a watch, O Jehovah, before my
mouth; keep the door of my lips.

<span id="an_141:4">141:4</span> Incline not my heart to any evil thing,
to practise deeds of wickedness with men that are workers of iniquity;
and let me not eat of their dainties.

<span id="an_141:5">141:5</span> Let the righteous smite me, it is
kindness; and let him reprove me, it is an excellent oil which my head
shall not refuse: for yet my prayer also is \[for them\] in their
calamities.

<span id="an_141:6">141:6</span> When their judges are thrown down from
the rocks, they shall hear my words, for they are sweet.

<span id="an_141:7">141:7</span> Our bones are scattered at the mouth of
Sheol, as when one cutteth and cleaveth \[wood\] upon the earth.

<span id="an_141:8">141:8</span> For unto thee, Jehovah, Lord, are mine
eyes; in thee do I trust: leave not my soul destitute.

<span id="an_141:9">141:9</span> Keep me from the snare which they have
laid for me, and from the traps of the workers of iniquity.

<span id="an_141:10">141:10</span> Let the wicked fall into their own
nets, whilst that \*I\* withal pass over.

<span id="an_142:1">142:1</span> {An instruction of David; when he was
in the cave: a prayer.} I cry unto Jehovah with my voice: with my voice
unto Jehovah do I make supplication.

<span id="an_142:2">142:2</span> I pour out my plaint before him; I shew
before him my trouble.

<span id="an_142:3">142:3</span> When my spirit was overwhelmed within
me, then \*thou\* knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they
hidden a snare for me.

<span id="an_142:4">142:4</span> Look on the right hand and see; there
is no man that knoweth me: refuge hath failed me; no man careth for my
soul.

<span id="an_142:5">142:5</span> I cried unto thee, Jehovah; I said,
Thou art my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.

<span id="an_142:6">142:6</span> Attend unto my cry, for I am brought
very low; deliver me from my persecutors, for they are stronger than I.

<span id="an_142:7">142:7</span> Bring my soul out of prison, that I may
celebrate thy name. The righteous shall surround me, because thou
dealest bountifully with me.

<span id="an_143:1">143:1</span> {A Psalm of David.} Jehovah, hear my
prayer; give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, in
thy righteousness.

<span id="an_143:2">143:2</span> And enter not into judgment with thy
servant; for in thy sight no man living shall be justified.

<span id="an_143:3">143:3</span> For the enemy persecuteth my soul: he
hath crushed my life down to the earth; he hath made me to dwell in dark
places, as those that have been long dead.

<span id="an_143:4">143:4</span> And my spirit is overwhelmed within me;
my heart within me is desolate.

<span id="an_143:5">143:5</span> I remember the days of old: I meditate
on all thy doing; I muse on the work of thy hands.

<span id="an_143:6">143:6</span> I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my
soul, as a parched land, \[thirsteth\] after thee. Selah.

<span id="an_143:7">143:7</span> Answer me speedily, O Jehovah; my
spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, or I shall be like unto them
that go down into the pit.

<span id="an_143:8">143:8</span> Cause me to hear thy loving-kindness in
the morning, for in thee do I confide; make me to know the way wherein I
should walk, for unto thee do I lift up my soul.

<span id="an_143:9">143:9</span> Deliver me, O Jehovah, from mine
enemies: unto thee do I flee for refuge.

<span id="an_143:10">143:10</span> Teach me to do thy will; for thou art
my God: let thy good Spirit lead me in a plain country.

<span id="an_143:11">143:11</span> Revive me, O Jehovah, for thy name's
sake; in thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble;

<span id="an_143:12">143:12</span> And in thy loving-kindness cut off
mine enemies, and destroy all them that oppress my soul: for I am thy
servant.

<span id="an_144:1">144:1</span> {\[A Psalm\] of David.} Blessed be
Jehovah my rock, who teacheth my hands to war, my fingers to fight;

<span id="an_144:2">144:2</span> My mercy and my fortress, my high tower
and my deliverer, my shield and he in whom I trust, who subdueth my
people under me!

<span id="an_144:3">144:3</span> Jehovah, what is man, that thou takest
knowledge of him, the son of man, that thou takest thought of him?

<span id="an_144:4">144:4</span> Man is like to vanity; his days are as
a shadow that passeth away.

<span id="an_144:5">144:5</span> Jehovah, bow thy heavens, and come
down; touch the mountains, that they smoke;

<span id="an_144:6">144:6</span> Cast forth lightnings, and scatter
them; send forth thine arrows, and discomfit them:

<span id="an_144:7">144:7</span> Stretch out thy hands from above;
rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of aliens,

<span id="an_144:8">144:8</span> Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their
right hand is a right hand of falsehood.

<span id="an_144:9">144:9</span> O God, I will sing a new song unto
thee; with the ten-stringed lute will I sing psalms unto thee:

<span id="an_144:10">144:10</span> Who givest salvation unto kings; who
rescuest David thy servant from the hurtful sword.

<span id="an_144:11">144:11</span> Rescue me, and deliver me from the
hand of aliens, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a
right hand of falsehood.

<span id="an_144:12">144:12</span> That our sons may be as plants grown
up in their youth; our daughters as corner-columns, sculptured after the
fashion of a palace:

<span id="an_144:13">144:13</span> Our granaries full, affording all
manner of store; our sheep bringing forth thousands, ten thousands in
our pastures;

<span id="an_144:14">144:14</span> Our kine laden \[with young\]; no
breaking in and no going forth, and no outcry in our streets.

<span id="an_144:15">144:15</span> Blessed the people that is in such a
case! Blessed the people whose God is Jehovah!

<span id="an_145:1">145:1</span> {A Psalm of praise. Of David.} I will
extol thee, my God, O King, and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.

<span id="an_145:2">145:2</span> Every day will I bless thee, and I will
praise thy name for ever and ever.

<span id="an_145:3">145:3</span> Great is Jehovah, and exceedingly to be
praised; and his greatness is unsearchable.

<span id="an_145:4">145:4</span> One generation shall laud thy works to
another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.

<span id="an_145:5">145:5</span> I will speak of the glorious splendour
of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works.

<span id="an_145:6">145:6</span> And they shall tell of the might of thy
terrible acts; and thy great deeds will I declare.

<span id="an_145:7">145:7</span> They shall abundantly utter the memory
of thy great goodness, and shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.

<span id="an_145:8">145:8</span> Jehovah is gracious and merciful; slow
to anger, and of great loving-kindness.

<span id="an_145:9">145:9</span> Jehovah is good to all; and his tender
mercies are over all his works.

<span id="an_145:10">145:10</span> All thy works shall praise thee,
Jehovah, and thy saints shall bless thee.

<span id="an_145:11">145:11</span> They shall tell of the glory of thy
kingdom, and speak of thy power;

<span id="an_145:12">145:12</span> To make known to the children of men
his mighty acts, and the glorious splendour of his kingdom.

<span id="an_145:13">145:13</span> Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages,
and thy dominion is throughout all generations.

<span id="an_145:14">145:14</span> Jehovah upholdeth all that fall, and
raiseth up all that are bowed down.

<span id="an_145:15">145:15</span> The eyes of all wait upon thee; and
thou givest them their food in its season.

<span id="an_145:16">145:16</span> Thou openest thy hand, and satisfiest
the desire of every living thing.

<span id="an_145:17">145:17</span> Jehovah is righteous in all his ways,
and kind in all his works.

<span id="an_145:18">145:18</span> Jehovah is nigh unto all that call
upon him, unto all that call upon him in truth.

<span id="an_145:19">145:19</span> He fulfilleth the desire of them that
fear him; he heareth their cry, and saveth them.

<span id="an_145:20">145:20</span> Jehovah keepeth all that love him,
and all the wicked will he destroy.

<span id="an_145:21">145:21</span> My mouth shall speak the praise of
Jehovah; and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.

<span id="an_146:1">146:1</span> Hallelujah! Praise Jehovah, O my soul.

<span id="an_146:2">146:2</span> As long as I live will I praise
Jehovah; I will sing psalms unto my God while I have my being.

<span id="an_146:3">146:3</span> Put not confidence in nobles, in a son
of man, in whom there is no salvation.

<span id="an_146:4">146:4</span> His breath goeth forth, he returneth to
his earth; in that very day his purposes perish.

<span id="an_146:5">146:5</span> Blessed is he who hath the ùGod of
Jacob for his help, whose hope is in Jehovah his God,

<span id="an_146:6">146:6</span> Who made the heavens and the earth, the
sea and all that is therein; who keepeth truth for ever;

<span id="an_146:7">146:7</span> Who executeth judgment for the
oppressed, who giveth bread to the hungry. Jehovah looseth the
prisoners;

<span id="an_146:8">146:8</span> Jehovah openeth \[the eyes of\] the
blind; Jehovah raiseth up them that are bowed down; Jehovah loveth the
righteous;

<span id="an_146:9">146:9</span> Jehovah preserveth the strangers; he
lifteth up the fatherless and the widow; but the way of the wicked doth
he subvert.

<span id="an_146:10">146:10</span> Jehovah will reign for ever, \[even\]
thy God, O Zion, from generation to generation. Halleluiah!

<span id="an_147:1">147:1</span> Praise ye Jah! for it is good. Sing
psalms of our God; for it is pleasant: praise is comely.

<span id="an_147:2">147:2</span> Jehovah doth build up Jerusalem: he
gathereth the outcasts of Israel.

<span id="an_147:3">147:3</span> He healeth the broken in heart, and
bindeth up their wounds.

<span id="an_147:4">147:4</span> He counteth the number of the stars; he
giveth names to them all.

<span id="an_147:5">147:5</span> Great is our Lord, and of great power:
his understanding is infinite.

<span id="an_147:6">147:6</span> Jehovah lifteth up the meek; he abaseth
the wicked to the earth.

<span id="an_147:7">147:7</span> Sing unto Jehovah with thanksgiving;
sing psalms upon the harp unto our God:

<span id="an_147:8">147:8</span> Who covereth the heavens with clouds,
who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the
mountains;

<span id="an_147:9">147:9</span> Who giveth to the cattle their food, to
the young ravens which cry.

<span id="an_147:10">147:10</span> He delighteth not in the strength of
the horse, he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man;

<span id="an_147:11">147:11</span> Jehovah taketh pleasure in those that
fear him, in those that hope in his loving-kindness.

<span id="an_147:12">147:12</span> Laud Jehovah, O Jerusalem; praise thy
God, O Zion.

<span id="an_147:13">147:13</span> For he hath strengthened the bars of
thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee;

<span id="an_147:14">147:14</span> He maketh peace in thy borders; he
satisfieth thee with the finest of the wheat.

<span id="an_147:15">147:15</span> He sendeth forth his oracles to the
earth: his word runneth very swiftly.

<span id="an_147:16">147:16</span> He giveth snow like wool, scattereth
the hoar frost like ashes;

<span id="an_147:17">147:17</span> He casteth forth his ice like
morsels: who can stand before his cold?

<span id="an_147:18">147:18</span> He sendeth his word, and melteth
them; he causeth his wind to blow -- the waters flow.

<span id="an_147:19">147:19</span> He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his
statutes and his judgments unto Israel.

<span id="an_147:20">147:20</span> He hath not dealt thus with any
nation; and as for \[his\] judgments, they have not known them.
Hallelujah!

<span id="an_148:1">148:1</span> Hallelujah! Praise Jehovah from the
heavens; praise him in the heights.

<span id="an_148:2">148:2</span> Praise ye him, all his angels; praise
ye him, all his hosts.

<span id="an_148:3">148:3</span> Praise him, sun and moon; praise him,
all ye stars of light.

<span id="an_148:4">148:4</span> Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and
ye waters that are above the heavens.

<span id="an_148:5">148:5</span> Let them praise the name of Jehovah,
for he it is that commanded, and they were created:

<span id="an_148:6">148:6</span> And he established them for ever and
ever; he made \[for them\] a statute which shall not pass.

<span id="an_148:7">148:7</span> Praise Jehovah from the earth, ye
sea-monsters, and all deeps;

<span id="an_148:8">148:8</span> Fire and hail, snow and vapour, stormy
wind fulfilling his word;

<span id="an_148:9">148:9</span> Mountains and all hills, fruit-trees
and all cedars;

<span id="an_148:10">148:10</span> Beasts and all cattle, creeping
things and winged fowl;

<span id="an_148:11">148:11</span> Kings of the earth and all peoples,
princes and all judges of the earth;

<span id="an_148:12">148:12</span> Both young men and maidens, old men
with youths, --

<span id="an_148:13">148:13</span> Let them praise the name of Jehovah:
for his name alone is exalted; his majesty is above the earth and the
heavens.

<span id="an_148:14">148:14</span> And he hath lifted up the horn of his
people, the praise of all his saints, \[even\] of the children of
Israel, a people near unto him. Hallelujah!

<span id="an_149:1">149:1</span> Hallelujah! Sing unto Jehovah a new
song; \[sing\] his praise in the congregation of the godly.

<span id="an_149:2">149:2</span> Let Israel rejoice in his Maker; let
the sons of Zion be joyful in their King.

<span id="an_149:3">149:3</span> Let them praise his name in the dance;
let them sing psalms unto him with the tambour and harp.

<span id="an_149:4">149:4</span> For Jehovah taketh pleasure in his
people; he beautifieth the meek with salvation.

<span id="an_149:5">149:5</span> Let the godly exult in glory; let them
shout for joy upon their beds.

<span id="an_149:6">149:6</span> Let the high praises of ùGod be in
their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand:

<span id="an_149:7">149:7</span> To execute vengeance against the
nations, \[and\] punishment among the peoples;

<span id="an_149:8">149:8</span> To bind their kings with chains, and
their nobles with fetters of iron;

<span id="an_149:9">149:9</span> To execute upon them the judgment
written. This honour have all his saints. Hallelujah!

<span id="an_150:1">150:1</span> Hallelujah! Praise ùGod in his
sanctuary; praise him in the firmament of his power.

<span id="an_150:2">150:2</span> Praise him in his mighty acts; praise
him according to the abundance of his greatness.

<span id="an_150:3">150:3</span> Praise him with the sound of the
trumpet; praise him with lute and harp;

<span id="an_150:4">150:4</span> Praise him with the tambour and dance;
praise him with stringed instruments and the pipe;

<span id="an_150:5">150:5</span> Praise him with loud cymbals; praise
him with high sounding cymbals.

<span id="an_150:6">150:6</span> Let everything that hath breath praise
Jah. Hallelujah!
