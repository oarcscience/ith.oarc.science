### Darby Bible: Song of Solomon

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The song of songs, which is Solomon's.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his
mouth; For thy love is better than wine.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Thine ointments savour sweetly; Thy name is
an ointment poured forth: Therefore do the virgins love thee.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> Draw me, we will run after thee! -- The
king hath brought me into his chambers -- We will be glad and rejoice in
thee, We will remember thy love more than wine. They love thee
uprightly.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> I am black, but comely, daughters of
Jerusalem, As the tents of Kedar, As the curtains of Solomon.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Look not upon me, because I am black;
Because the sun hath looked upon me. My mother's children were angry
with me: They made me keeper of the vineyards; Mine own vineyard have I
not kept.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Tell me, thou whom my soul loveth, Where
thou feedest \[thy flock\], Where thou makest it to rest at noon; For
why should I be as one veiled Beside the flocks of thy companions?

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> If thou know not, thou fairest among women,
Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, And feed thy kids beside
the shepherds' booths.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> I compare thee, my love, To a steed in
Pharaoh's chariots.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Thy cheeks are comely with bead-rows, Thy
neck with ornamental chains.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> We will make thee bead-rows of gold With
studs of silver.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> While the king is at his table, My
spikenard sendeth forth its fragrance.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> A bundle of myrrh is my beloved unto me;
He shall pass the night between my breasts.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> My beloved is unto me a cluster of
henna-flowers In the vineyards of Engedi.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Behold, thou art fair, my love; Behold,
thou art fair: thine eyes are doves.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea,
pleasant; Also our bed is green.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> The beams of our houses are cedars, Our
rafters are cypresses.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> I am a narcissus of Sharon, A lily of the
valleys.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> As the lily among thorns, So is my love
among the daughters.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> As the apple-tree among the trees of the
wood, So is my beloved among the sons: In his shadow have I rapture and
sit down; And his fruit is sweet to my taste.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> He hath brought me to the house of wine,
And his banner over me is love.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Sustain ye me with raisin-cakes, Refresh me
with apples; For I am sick of love.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> His left hand is under my head, And his
right hand doth embrace me.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem, By
the gazelles, or by the hinds of the field, That ye stir not up, nor
awake \[my\] love, till he please.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> The voice of my beloved! Behold, he cometh
Leaping upon the mountains, Skipping upon the hills.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> My beloved is like a gazelle or a young
hart. Behold, he standeth behind our wall, He looketh in through the
windows, Glancing through the lattice.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> My beloved spake and said unto me, Rise
up, my love, my fair one, and come away.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> For behold, the winter is past, The rain
is over, it is gone:

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> The flowers appear on the earth; The time
of singing is come, And the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our
land;

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> The fig-tree melloweth her winter figs,
And the vines in bloom give forth \[their\] fragrance. Arise, my love,
my fair one, and come away!

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> My dove, in the clefts of the rock, In
the covert of the precipice, Let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy
voice; For sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> Take us the foxes, The little foxes, that
spoil the vineyards; For our vineyards are in bloom.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> My beloved is mine, and I am his; He
feedeth \[his flock\] among the lilies,

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> Until the day dawn, and the shadows flee
away. Turn, my beloved: be thou like a gazelle or a young hart, Upon the
mountains of Bether.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> On my bed, in the nights, I sought him whom
my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> I will rise now, and go about the city; In
the streets and in the broadways Will I seek him whom my soul loveth: I
sought him, but I found him not.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> The watchmen that go about the city found
me: -- Have ye seen him whom my soul loveth?

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> -- Scarcely had I passed from them, When I
found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go,
Until I had brought him into my mother's house, And into the chamber of
her that conceived me.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem, By
the gazelles, or by the hinds of the field, That ye stir not up, nor
awake \[my\] love, till he please.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> Who is this, \[she\] that cometh up from
the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and
frankincense, With all powders of the merchant? ...

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Behold his couch, Solomon's own: Threescore
mighty men are about it, Of the mighty of Israel.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> They all hold the sword, Experts in war;
Each hath his sword upon his thigh Because of alarm in the nights.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> King Solomon made himself a palanquin Of
the wood of Lebanon.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> Its pillars he made of silver, Its
support of gold, Its seat of purple; The midst thereof was paved
\[with\] love By the daughters of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Go forth, daughters of Zion, And behold
king Solomon With the crown wherewith his mother crowned him In the day
of his espousals, And in the day of the gladness of his heart.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold,
thou art fair; Thine eyes are doves behind thy veil; Thy hair is as a
flock of goats, On the slopes of mount Gilead.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Thy teeth are like a flock of shorn sheep,
Which go up from the washing; Which have all borne twins, And none is
barren among them.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, And
thy speech is comely; As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples Behind
thy veil.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Thy neck is like the tower of David, Built
for an armoury: A thousand bucklers hang thereon, All shields of mighty
men.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Thy two breasts are like two fawns, twins
of a gazelle, Which feed among the lilies.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> Until the day dawn, and the shadows flee
away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, And to the hill of
frankincense.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> Thou art all fair, my love; And there is no
spot in thee.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> \[Come\] with me, from Lebanon, \[my\]
spouse, With me from Lebanon, -- Come, look from the top of Amanah, From
the top of Senir and Hermon, From the lions' dens, From the mountains of
the leopards.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister,
\[my\] spouse; Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, With
one chain of thy neck.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> How fair is thy love, my sister, \[my\]
spouse! How much better is thy love than wine! And the fragrance of
thine ointments than all spices!

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> Thy lips, \[my\] spouse, drop \[as\] the
honeycomb; Honey and milk are under thy tongue; And the smell of thy
garments is like the smell of Lebanon.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> A garden enclosed is my sister, \[my\]
spouse; A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> Thy shoots are a paradise of
pomegranates, with precious fruits; Henna with spikenard plants;

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> Spikenard and saffron; Calamus and
cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; Myrrh and aloes, with all the
chief spices:

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> A fountain in the gardens, A well of
living waters, Which stream from Lebanon.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> Awake, north wind, and come, \[thou\]
south; Blow upon my garden, \[that\] the spices thereof may flow forth.
Let my beloved come into his garden, And eat its precious fruits.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> I am come into my garden, my sister, \[my\]
spouse; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my
honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O
friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, beloved ones!

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> I slept, but my heart was awake. The voice
of my beloved! he knocketh: Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove,
mine undefiled; For my head is filled with dew, My locks with the drops
of the night.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> -- I have put off my tunic, how should I
put it on? I have washed my feet, how should I pollute them? --

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> My beloved put in his hand by the hole \[of
the door\]; And my bowels yearned for him.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> I rose up to open to my beloved; And my
hands dropped with myrrh, And my fingers with liquid myrrh, Upon the
handles of the lock.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> I opened to my beloved; But my beloved had
withdrawn himself; he was gone: My soul went forth when he spoke. I
sought him, but I found him not; I called him, but he gave me no answer.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> The watchmen that went about the city found
me; They smote me, they wounded me; The keepers of the walls took away
my veil from me.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem, If ye
find my beloved, ... What will ye tell him? -- That I am sick of love.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> What is thy beloved more than \[another\]
beloved, Thou fairest among women? What is thy beloved more than
\[another\] beloved, That thou dost so charge us?

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> My beloved is white and ruddy, The
chiefest among ten thousand.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> His head is \[as\] the finest gold; His
locks are flowing, black as the raven;

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> His eyes are like doves by the
water-brooks, Washed with milk, fitly set;

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> His cheeks are as a bed of spices, raised
beds of sweet plants; His lips lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> His hands gold rings, set with the
chrysolite; His belly is bright ivory, overlaid \[with\] sapphires;

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> His legs, pillars of marble, set upon
bases of fine gold: His bearing as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars;

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> His mouth is most sweet: Yea, he is
altogether lovely. This is my beloved, yea, this is my friend, O
daughters of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Whither is thy beloved gone, Thou fairest
among women? Whither is thy beloved turned aside? And we will seek him
with thee.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> My beloved is gone down into his garden, to
the beds of spices, To feed in the gardens and to gather lilies.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine:
He feedeth \[his flock\] among the lilies.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> Thou art fair, my love, as Tirzah, Comely
as Jerusalem, Terrible as troops with banners:

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> Turn away thine eyes from me, For they
overcome me. Thy hair is as a flock of goats On the slopes of Gilead.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep Which
go up from the washing; Which have all borne twins, And none is barren
among them.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples
Behind thy veil.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> There are threescore queens, and fourscore
concubines, And virgins without number:

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> My dove, mine undefiled, is but one; She is
the only one of her mother, She is the choice one of her that bore her.
The daughters saw her, and they called her blessed; The queens and the
concubines, and they praised her.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> Who is she that looketh forth as the
dawn, Fair as the moon, clear as the sun, Terrible as troops with
banners?

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> I went down into the garden of nuts, To
see the verdure of the valley, To see whether the vine budded, Whether
the pomegranates blossomed.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> Before I was aware, My soul set me upon
the chariots of my willing people.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> Return, return, O Shulamite; Return,
return, that we may look upon thee. -- What would ye look upon in the
Shulamite? -- As it were the dance of two camps.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> How beautiful are thy footsteps in sandals,
O prince's daughter! The roundings of thy thighs are like jewels, The
work of the hands of an artist.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> Thy navel is a round goblet, \[which\]
wanteth not mixed wine; Thy belly a heap of wheat, set about with
lilies;

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> Thy two breasts are like two fawns, twins
of a gazelle;

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; Thine
eyes, \[like\] the pools in Heshbon, By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Thy
nose like the tower of Lebanon, Which looketh toward Damascus;

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, And the
locks of thy head like purple; The king is fettered by \[thy\] ringlets!

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> How fair and how pleasant art thou, \[my\]
love, in delights!

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> This thy stature is like to a palm-tree,
And thy breasts to grape clusters.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> I said, I will go up to the palm-tree, I
will take hold of the boughs thereof; And thy breasts shall indeed be
like clusters of the vine, And the fragrance of thy nose like apples,

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> And the roof of thy mouth like the best
wine, ... That goeth down smoothly for my beloved, And stealeth over the
lips of them that are asleep.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> I am my beloved's, And his desire is
toward me.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> -- Come, my beloved, let us go forth into
the fields; Let us lodge in the villages.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> We will go up early to the vineyards, We
will see if the vine hath budded, \[If\] the blossom is opening, And the
pomegranates are in bloom: There will I give thee my loves.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> The mandrakes yield fragrance; And at our
gates are all choice fruits, new and old: I have laid them up for thee,
my beloved.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> Oh that thou wert as my brother, That
sucked the breasts of my mother! Should I find thee without, I would
kiss thee; And they would not despise me.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> I would lead thee, bring thee into my
mother's house; Thou wouldest instruct me: I would cause thee to drink
of spiced wine, Of the juice of my pomegranate.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> His left hand would be under my head, And
his right hand embrace me.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem, ...
Why should ye stir up, why awake \[my\] love, till he please?

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> Who is this that cometh up from the
wilderness, Leaning upon her beloved? I awoke thee under the apple-tree:
There thy mother brought thee forth; There she brought thee forth
\[that\] bore thee.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> Set me as a seal upon thy heart, As a seal
upon thine arm: For love is strong as death; Jealousy is cruel as Sheol:
The flashes thereof are flashes of fire, Flames of Jah.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> Many waters cannot quench love, Neither do
the floods drown it: Even if a man gave all the substance of his house
for love, It would utterly be contemned.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> We have a little sister, And she hath no
breasts: What shall we do for our sister In the day when she shall be
spoken for? --

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> If she be a wall, We will build upon her a
turret of silver; And if she be a door, We will enclose her with boards
of cedar.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> I am a wall, and my breasts like towers;
Then was I in his eyes as one that findeth peace.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon: He
let out the vineyard unto keepers; Every one for the fruit thereof was
to bring a thousand silver-pieces.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> My vineyard, which is mine, is before me:
The thousand \[silver-pieces\] be to thee, Solomon; And to the keepers
of its fruit, two hundred.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> Thou that dwellest in the gardens, The
companions hearken to thy voice: Let me hear \[it\].

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> Haste, my beloved, And be thou like a
gazelle or a young hart Upon the mountains of spices.
