<span id="an_4:38">4:38</span> these mentioned by name were princes in
their families; and their fathers' houses increased greatly.

<span id="an_4:39">4:39</span> And they went to the entrance of Gedor,
as far as the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.

<span id="an_4:40">4:40</span> And they found fat and good pasture, and
a land widely extended and quiet and fertile, for they who had dwelt
there formerly were of Ham.

<span id="an_4:41">4:41</span> And these written by name came in the
days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and smote their tents and the
habitations that were found there, and destroyed them utterly unto this
day, and dwelt in their stead; for there was pasture there for their
flocks.

<span id="an_4:42">4:42</span> And five hundred men of them, of the sons
of Simeon, went to mount Seir, having at their head Pelatiah, and
Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Jishi,

<span id="an_4:43">4:43</span> and they smote the rest of the Amalekites
that had escaped; and they dwelt there unto this day.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> And the sons of Reuben the firstborn of
Israel (for he was the firstborn; but, inasmuch as he defiled his
father's bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of
Israel; but the genealogy is not registered according to the birthright,

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> for Judah prevailed among his brethren, and
of him was the prince, but the birthright was Joseph's),

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> -- the sons of Reuben, the firstborn of
Israel: Enoch and Phallu, Hezron and Carmi.

genealogical register of their generations, were: the chief, Jeiel, and
Zechariah,

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> and Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema,
the son of Joel, who dwelt in Aroer, as far as Nebo and Baal-meon;

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> and eastward he dwelt as far as the
entrance to the wilderness from the river Euphrates; for their cattle
were multiplied in the land of Gilead.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> And in the days of Saul they made war
with the Hagarites, who fell by their hand; and they dwelt in their
tents throughout the east side of Gilead.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And the children of Gad dwelt over
against them, in the land of Bashan, as far as Salcah:

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> Joel was the chief and Shapham the next,
and Jaanai, and Shaphat in Bashan.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> And their brethren according to their

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni,
was chief of their fathers' house.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and
in its towns, and in all the pasture-grounds of Sharon, as far as their
limits.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> All these were registered by genealogy in
the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of
Israel.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> The children of Reuben and the Gadites
and half the tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men who carried shield
and sword, drawing the bow and skilful in war, were forty-four thousand
seven hundred and sixty, able to go forth to war.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> And they made war with the Hagarites,
with Jetur, and Naphish, and Nodab;

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> and they were helped against them, and
the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with
them; for they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them,
because they put their trust in him.

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> And they took away their cattle: their
camels fifty thousand, and two hundred and fifty thousand sheep, and two
thousand asses, and a hundred thousand human souls.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> For there fell down many slain, for the
war was of God. And they dwelt in their stead until the captivity.

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> And the children of the half tribe of
Manasseh dwelt in the land, from Bashan as far as Baal-Hermon and Senir,
and mount Hermon; they were many.

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> And these were the heads of their
fathers' houses: Epher, and Jishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah,
and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, heads of
their fathers' houses.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> And they transgressed against the God of
their fathers, and went a whoring after the gods of the peoples of the
land, whom God had destroyed before them.

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> And the God of Israel stirred up the
spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath-Pilneser king
of Assyria, and he carried them away, the Reubenites, and the Gadites,
and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, and Habor,
and Hara, and to the river Gozan, -- unto this day.

were the chief fathers of the inhabitants of Geba; and they carried them
away to Manahath;

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> even Naaman, and Ahijah, and Gera; he
removed them), and he begot Uzza and Ahihud.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> And Shaharaim begot \[children\] in the
land of Moab after he had sent away Hushim and Baara his wives.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> And he begot of Hodesh his wife: Jobab, and
Zibia, and Mesha, and Malcham,

and Shemer, who built Ono, and Lod and its dependent villages;

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> and Beriah, and Shema, who were chief

were the sons of Jeroham.

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> These were the chief fathers, according
to their generations, principal men; these dwelt in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> And at Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon;
and his wife's name was Maachah.

<span id="an_8:30">8:30</span> And his son, the firstborn, was Abdon;
and Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Nadab,

<span id="an_8:31">8:31</span> and Gedor, and Ahio, and Zecher.

<span id="an_8:32">8:32</span> And Mikloth begot Shimeah. And these also

<span id="an_8:33">8:33</span> And Ner begot Kish; and Kish begot Saul;
and Saul begot Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Esh-baal.

<span id="an_8:38">8:38</span> And Azel had six sons, and these are
their names: Azrikam, Bochru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah,
and Hanan; all these were sons of Azel.

<span id="an_8:39">8:39</span> And the sons of Eshek his brother were
Ulam his firstborn, Jeush the second, and Eliphelet the third.

<span id="an_8:40">8:40</span> And the sons of Ulam were mighty men of
valour, archers; and they had many sons, and sons' sons, a hundred and
fifty. All these were of the sons of Benjamin.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> And all Israel were registered by
genealogy; and behold, they are written in the book of the kings of
Israel. And Judah was carried away to Babylon because of their
transgression.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> And the inhabitants that were first in
their possessions in their cities were the Israelites, the priests, the
Levites, and the Nethinim.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of
Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim,
and Manasseh:

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri,
the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Pherez the son of
Judah.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> And of the Shilonites: Asaiah the
firstborn, and his sons.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> And of the sons of Zerah: Jeuel; and their
brethren, six hundred and ninety.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> And of the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son

the son of Uzzi, the son of Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephatiah,
the son of Reuel, the son of Jibnijah;

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> and their brethren, according to their
generations, nine hundred and fifty-six. All these men were chief
fathers in their fathers' houses.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> And of the priests: Jedaiah, and
Jehoiarib, and Jachin,

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> and Azariah the son of Hilkijah, the son
of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub,
the ruler of the house of God;

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of
Pashhur, the son of Malchijah, and Masai the son of Adiel, the son of
Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of
Immer;

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> and their brethren, heads of their
fathers' houses, a thousand and seven hundred and sixty; able men for
the work of the service of the house of God.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> And of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of
Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of
Merari;

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> and Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal; and
Mattaniah the son of Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph;

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> and Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son
of Galal, the son of Jeduthun; and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of
Elkanah, who dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> And the doorkeepers: Shallum, and Akkub,
and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brethren; Shallum was the chief.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> And they have been hitherto in the king's
gate eastward: they were the doorkeepers in the camps of the children of
Levi.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of
Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his
father, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the
thresholds of the tent, and their fathers, set over the camp of Jehovah,
were keepers of the entrance.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the
ruler over them formerly; Jehovah was with him.

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was
doorkeeper at the entrance to the tent of meeting.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> All these chosen to be doorkeepers at the
thresholds were two hundred and twelve. These were registered by
genealogy according to their villages: David and Samuel the seer had
instituted them in their trust.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> And they and their sons were at the gates
of the house of Jehovah, the house of the tent, to keep watch there.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> At the four quarters were the
doorkeepers, toward the east, west, north, and south.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> And their brethren, in their villages,
were to come after \[every\] seven days from time to time with them.

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> For in their trust these four were the
chief doorkeepers: they were Levites; and they were over the chambers
and over the treasuries of the house of God;

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> for they stayed round about the house of
God during the night, because the charge was upon them, and the opening
thereof every morning \[pertained\] to them.

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> And \[part\] of them had the charge of
the instruments of service, for by number they brought them in and by
number they brought them out.

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> \[Part\] of them also were appointed over
the vessels, and over all the holy instruments, and over the fine flour,
and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> And it was \[some one\] of the sons of
the priests who compounded the ointment of the spices.

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> And Mattithiah of the Levites, who was
the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, was in trust over the things that
were made in the pans.

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> And \[some\] of the sons of the
Kohathites, their brethren, were over the loaves to be set in rows, to
prepare them every sabbath.

<span id="an_9:33">9:33</span> And these were the singers, chief fathers
of the Levites, \[who were\] in the chambers free from service; for they
were employed day and night.

<span id="an_9:34">9:34</span> These are the chief fathers of the
Levites, heads according to their families; these dwelt in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_9:35">9:35</span> And at Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon,
Jeiel, and his wife's name was Maachah.

<span id="an_9:36">9:36</span> And his son, the firstborn, was Abdon,
and Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab,

<span id="an_9:37">9:37</span> and Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and
Mikloth;

<span id="an_9:38">9:38</span> and Mikloth begot Shimeam. And they also
dwelt beside their brethren in Jerusalem, with their brethren.

<span id="an_9:39">9:39</span> And Ner begot Kish; and Kish begot Saul;
and Saul begot Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Esh-baal.

<span id="an_9:40">9:40</span> And the son of Jonathan was Merib-Baal;
and Merib-Baal begot Micah.

<span id="an_9:41">9:41</span> And the sons of Micah: Pithon, and
Melech, and Tahrea.

<span id="an_9:42">9:42</span> And Ahaz begot Jarah: and Jarah begot
Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begot Moza;

<span id="an_9:43">9:43</span> and Moza begot Binea; and Rephaiah his
son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son.

<span id="an_9:44">9:44</span> And Azel had six sons, and these are
their names: Azrikam, Bochru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah,
and Hanan; these were the sons of Azel.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> And the Philistines fought against
Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell
down slain on mount Gilboa.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> And the Philistines followed hard after
Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines smote Jonathan, and
Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, Saul's sons.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> And the battle went sore against Saul,
and the archers came up with him, and he was terrified by the archers.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> Then said Saul to his armour-bearer, Draw
thy sword, and thrust me through with it; lest these uncircumcised come
and abuse me. But his armour-bearer would not; for he was much afraid.
So Saul took the sword and fell on it.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> And when his armour-bearer saw that Saul
was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> So Saul died, and his three sons, and all
his house died together.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> And when all the men of Israel that were
in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead,
they forsook their cities and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt
in them.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> And it came to pass the next day, that
the Philistines came to strip the slain, and they found Saul and his
sons fallen on mount Gilboa.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> And they stripped him, and took his head,
and his armour, and sent \[them\] into the land of the Philistines round
about, to announce the glad tidings to their idols, and to the people.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> And they put his armour in the house of
their god, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> And when all they of Jabesh-Gilead
heard of all that the Philistines had done to Saul,

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> all the valiant men arose, and took up
the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh,
and buried their bones under the terebinth of Jabesh, and fasted seven
days.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> And Saul died for his unfaithfulness
which he committed against Jehovah, because of the word of Jehovah which
he kept not, and also for having inquired of the spirit of Python,
asking counsel of it;

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> and he asked not counsel of Jehovah;
therefore he slew him, and transferred the kingdom to David the son of
Jesse.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> And all Israel assembled themselves to
David to Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> Even aforetime, even when Saul was king,
thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel; and Jehovah thy
God said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be
prince over my people Israel.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> And all the elders of Israel came to the
king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before
Jehovah; and they anointed David king over Israel according to the word
of Jehovah through Samuel.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> And David and all Israel went to
Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of
the land.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> And the inhabitants of Jebus said to
David, Thou shalt not come in hither. But David took the stronghold of
Zion, which is the city of David.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> And David said, Whoever smites the
Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Zeruiah
went first up, and was chief.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> And David dwelt in the stronghold;
therefore they called it the city of David.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> And he built the city round about, even
from the Millo round about; and Joab renewed the rest of the city.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> And David became continually greater; and
Jehovah of hosts was with him.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> And these are the chief of the mighty
men whom David had, who shewed themselves valiant with him in his
kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of
Jehovah concerning Israel.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> And this is the number of the mighty
men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of Hachmoni, the chief of the
captains; he brandished his spear against three hundred, slain \[by
him\] at one time.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> And after him, Eleazar the son of Dodo,
the Ahohite; he was one of the three mighty men.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> He was with David at Pas-dammim, where
the Philistines were gathered together to battle; and there was
\[there\] a plot of ground full of barley; and the people had fled from
before the Philistines.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> And they stood in the midst of the plot
and delivered it, and smote the Philistines; and Jehovah wrought a great
deliverance.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> And three of the thirty chiefs went
down to the rock to David, to the cave of Adullam, when the army of the
Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> And David was then in the stronghold;
and the Philistines' garrison was then at Bethlehem.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> And David longed, and said, Oh that one
would give me to drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is
in the gate!

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> And the three broke through the camp of
the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, which is
in the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; David however would
not drink of it, but poured it out to Jehovah.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> And he said, My God forbid it me, that
I should do this thing! should I drink the blood of these men \[who
went\] at the risk of their lives? for at the risk of their lives they
brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three
mighty men.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was
the chief of three; and he brandished his spear against three hundred
and slew them; and he had a name among the three.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> Of the three he was more honourable
than the two, and he was their captain; but he did not attain to the
\[first\] three.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of
a valiant man, great in exploits, of Kabzeel: he it was that smote two
lions of Moab; and he went down and smote a lion in the midst of a pit
on a snowy day.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> He also smote the Egyptian, a man of
stature, five cubits high: and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a
weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the
spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> These things did Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada, and he had a name among the three mighty men.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> Behold, he was honoured above the
thirty, but he did not attain to the \[first\] three. And David set him
in his council.

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> And the valiant men of the forces were:
Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the
Pelonite,

<span id="an_11:41">11:41</span> Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of
Ahlai,

<span id="an_11:42">11:42</span> Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a
captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with him;

Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Jithmah the Moabite,

<span id="an_11:47">11:47</span> Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel the
Mezobaite.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> Now these are they that came to David to
Ziklag, while he kept still close because of Saul the son of Kish; and
they were among the mighty men who helped him in the conflict;

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> armed with bows, using both the right
hand and the left with stones and with arrows on the bow; \[they were\]
of Saul's brethren of Benjamin:

Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> And of the Gadites, there separated
themselves to David in the stronghold in the wilderness mighty men of
valour, men fit for the service of war, armed with shield and spear;

gazelles upon the mountains:

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> These were of the sons of Gad, captains
of the host: one of the least was over a hundred, and the greatest over
a thousand.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> These are they that went over Jordan in
the first month, when it overflows all its banks, and they put to flight
all \[them\] of the valleys, toward the east and toward the west.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> And there came of the children of
Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold to David.

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> And David went out to meet them, and
answered and said to them, If ye come peaceably to me to help me, my
heart shall be knit unto you; but if to betray me to mine enemies,
seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers see \[it\]
and rebuke \[it\].

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> And the Spirit came upon Amasai, the
chief of the captains, \[and he said,\] Thine \[are we\], David, And
with thee, thou son of Jesse: Peace, peace be to thee! And peace be to
thy helpers! For thy God helps thee. And David received them, and made
them chiefs of bands.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> And there fell some of Manasseh to
David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but
they helped them not; for the lords of the Philistines upon deliberation
sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul at the peril of
our heads.

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> As he went away to Ziklag, there fell
to him of Manasseh: Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and
Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of
Manasseh.

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> And they helped David in his
expeditions; for they were all mighty men of valour, and were captains
in the host.

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> For day by day there came \[men\] to
David to help him, until it was a great camp, like the camp of God.

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> And this is the number of the men
equipped for military service, who came to David to Hebron, to transfer
the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of Jehovah.

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> The children of Judah that bore shield
and spear were six thousand eight hundred, equipped for military
service.

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> Of the children of Simeon, mighty men
of valour for war, seven thousand one hundred.

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> Of the children of Levi four thousand
six hundred.

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> And Jehoiada the prince of Aaron, and
with him were three thousand seven hundred;

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> and Zadok, a valiant young man, and his
father's house two and twenty chief men.

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> And of the children of Benjamin, the
brethren of Saul, three thousand; but hitherto the greater part of them
had adhered to the house of Saul.

<span id="an_12:30">12:30</span> And of the children of Ephraim twenty
thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valour, men of name in their
fathers' houses.

<span id="an_12:31">12:31</span> And of the half tribe of Manasseh
eighteen thousand, who were expressed by name, to come and make David
king.

<span id="an_12:32">12:32</span> And of the children of Issachar, who
had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, the
heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their
bidding.

<span id="an_12:33">12:33</span> Of Zebulun, such as went forth in the
host, armed for war with all weapons of war, fifty thousand, keeping
rank without double heart.

<span id="an_12:34">12:34</span> And of Naphtali a thousand captains,
and with them thirty-seven thousand with shield and spear.

<span id="an_12:35">12:35</span> And of the Danites armed for war
twenty-eight thousand six hundred.

<span id="an_12:36">12:36</span> And of Asher such as went forth in the
host, to set themselves in battle array, forty thousand.

<span id="an_12:37">12:37</span> And from the other side of the Jordan,
of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh,
with all manner of weapons of war for battle, a hundred and twenty
thousand.

<span id="an_12:38">12:38</span> All of them men of war, keeping rank in
battle array, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king
over all Israel; and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to
make David king.

<span id="an_12:39">12:39</span> And there they were with David three
days, eating and drinking; for their brethren had prepared for them;

<span id="an_12:40">12:40</span> and those too that were near them, as
far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought food on asses, and on
camels, and on mules, and on oxen; provisions of meal, fig-cakes and
raisin-cakes, and wine and oil, and oxen and sheep, abundantly; for
there was joy in Israel.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> And David consulted with the captains of
thousands and hundreds, with every prince.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> And David said to all the congregation of
Israel, If it seem good to you, and it be of Jehovah our God, let us
send abroad to our brethren everywhere, that are left in all the lands
of Israel, and with them to the priests and Levites in their cities and
suburbs, that they may gather themselves to us;

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> and let us bring again the ark of our God
to us; for we inquired not of it in the days of Saul.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> And all the congregation said that they
should do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> And David assembled all Israel from the
Shihor of Egypt unto the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God
from Kirjath-jearim.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> And David went up, and all Israel, to
Baalah, to Kirjath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from
thence the ark of God, of Jehovah, who sitteth between the cherubim,
whose name is placed \[there\].

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> And they carried the ark of God on a new
cart out of the house of Abinadab; and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> And David and all Israel played before
God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with
lutes, and with tambours, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> And when they came to the threshing-floor
of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen had
stumbled.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> And the anger of Jehovah was kindled
against Uzza, and he smote him, because he had put forth his hand to the
ark; and there he died before God.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> And David was indignant; for Jehovah
had made a breach upon Uzza; and he called that place Perez-Uzza to this
day.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> And David was afraid of God that day,
saying, How shall I bring the ark of God to me?

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> And David brought not the ark home unto
himself into the city of David, but he carried it aside into the house
of Obed-Edom the Gittite.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> And the ark of God remained with the
family of Obed-Edom in his house three months. And Jehovah blessed the
house of Obed-Edom, and all that he had.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to
David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him a
house.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> And David perceived that Jehovah had
established him king over Israel, for his kingdom was highly exalted,
because of his people Israel.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> And David took more wives at Jerusalem:
and David begot more sons and daughters.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> And these are the names of the children
which he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> and Elishama, and Beeliada, and
Eliphelet.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> And the Philistines heard that David was
anointed king over all Israel, and all the Philistines went up to seek
David; and David heard \[of it\], and went out against them.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> And the Philistines came and spread
themselves in the valley of Rephaim.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> And David inquired of God saying, Shall
I go up against the Philistines, and wilt thou give them into my hand?
And Jehovah said to him, Go up; and I will give them into thy hand.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> And they came up to Baal-perazim, and
David smote them there; and David said, God has broken in upon mine
enemies by my hand, as the breaking forth of waters. Therefore they
called the name of that place Baal-perazim.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> And they left their gods there; and
David commanded, and they were burned with fire.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> And the Philistines yet again spread
themselves in the valley.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> And David inquired again of God; and
God said to him, Go not up after them; turn round them and come upon
them opposite the mulberry-trees.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> And it shall be, when thou hearest the
sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou
shalt go out to battle; for God will have gone forth before thee to
smite the army of the Philistines.

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> And David did as God commanded him; and
they smote the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> And the fame of David went out into all
lands; and Jehovah brought the fear of him upon all the nations.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> And he made him houses in the city of
David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and spread a tent for
it.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> Then David said, None ought to carry the
ark of God but the Levites, for them has Jehovah chosen to carry the ark
of God, and to serve him for ever.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> And David assembled all Israel to
Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Jehovah to its place that he had
prepared for it.

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> And David gathered the sons of Aaron and
the Levites:

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief,
and his brethren a hundred and twenty;

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief,
and his brethren two hundred and twenty;

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief,
and his brethren a hundred and thirty;

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the
chief, and his brethren two hundred;

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief,
and his brethren eighty;

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the
chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> And David called for Zadok and Abiathar
the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah,
and Eliel, and Amminadab;

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> and he said to them, Ye are the chief
fathers of the Levites; hallow yourselves, ye and your brethren, that ye
may bring up the ark of Jehovah the God of Israel to \[the place that\]
I have prepared for it.

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> For because ye did \[it\] not at the
first, Jehovah our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not
after the due order.

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> So the priests and the Levites hallowed
themselves to bring up the ark of Jehovah the God of Israel.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> And the children of the Levites bore
the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves upon them, as Moses
had commanded according to the word of Jehovah.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> And David spoke to the chief of the
Levites to appoint their brethren, the singers, with instruments of
music, lutes, and harps, and cymbals, that they should sound aloud,
lifting up the voice with joy.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> And the Levites appointed Heman the son
of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the
sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> and with them their brethren of the
second \[rank\], Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and
Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and
Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers;

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> and the singers, Heman, Asaph, and
Ethan, to sound aloud with cymbals of brass;

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> and Zechariah, and Aziel, and
Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah,
with lutes on Alamoth;

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and
Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the
Sheminith to lead \[the singing\].

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites for
the music, gave instruction in music, for he was skilful.

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> And Berechiah and Elkanah were
doorkeepers for the ark.

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and
Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the
priests, blew with the trumpets before the ark of God; and Obed-Edom and
Jehijah were doorkeepers for the ark.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> And David, and the elders of Israel,
and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the
covenant of Jehovah out of the house of Obed-Edom with joy.

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> And it came to pass, when God helped
the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, that they
sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> And David was clothed with a robe of
byssus, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and
Chenaniah chief of the music of the singers; and David had upon him a
linen ephod.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> And all Israel brought up the ark of
the covenant of Jehovah with shouting, and with sound of the trumpet,
and with clarions, and with cymbals, playing aloud with lutes and harps.

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> And it came to pass as the ark of the
covenant of Jehovah came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter
of Saul looked through a window, and saw king David dancing and playing;
and she despised him in her heart.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> And they brought in the ark of God, and
set it in the midst of the tent that David had spread for it; and they
presented burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> And when David had ended offering up the
burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the
name of Jehovah.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> And he dealt to every one of Israel, both
man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread and a measure \[of wine\]
and a raisin-cake.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> And he appointed certain of the Levites
to do the service before the ark of Jehovah, and to celebrate, and to
thank and praise Jehovah the God of Israel:

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> Asaph the chief, and second to him
Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and
Eliab, and Benaiah and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with instruments of lutes
and with harps; and Asaph sounding with cymbals;

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with
trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> Then on that day David delivered first
\[this psalm\] to give thanks to Jehovah through Asaph and his brethren.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> Give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his
name; Make known his acts among the peoples.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him;
Meditate upon all his wondrous works.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> Glory in his holy name: Let the heart
of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> Seek Jehovah and his strength, Seek his
face continually;

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> Remember his wondrous works which he
hath done; His miracles, and the judgments of his mouth:

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> Ye seed of Israel his servant, Ye sons
of Jacob, his chosen ones.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> He, Jehovah, is our God; His judgments
are in all the earth.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> Be ye ever mindful of his covenant, The
word which he commanded to a thousand generations, --

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> Which he made with Abraham, And of his
oath unto Isaac;

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> And he confirmed it unto Jacob for a
statute, Unto Israel for an everlasting covenant,

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> Saying, Unto thee will I give the land
of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> When ye were a few men in number, Of
small account, and strangers in it.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> And they went from nation to nation,
And from one kingdom to another people.

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> He suffered no man to oppress them, And
reproved kings for their sakes,

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> \[Saying,\] Touch not mine anointed
ones, And do my prophets no harm.

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth;
Publish his salvation from day to day.

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> Declare his glory among the nations,
His wondrous works among all peoples.

<span id="an_16:25">16:25</span> For Jehovah is great, and exceedingly
to be praised; And he is terrible above all gods.

<span id="an_16:26">16:26</span> For all the gods of the peoples are
idols; But Jehovah made the heavens.

<span id="an_16:27">16:27</span> Majesty and splendour are before him;
Strength and gladness in his place.

<span id="an_16:28">16:28</span> Give unto Jehovah, ye families of
peoples, Give unto Jehovah glory and strength!

<span id="an_16:29">16:29</span> Give unto Jehovah the glory of his
name! Bring an oblation, and come before him: Worship Jehovah in holy
splendour.

<span id="an_16:30">16:30</span> Tremble before him, all the earth: The
world also is established, it shall not be moved.

<span id="an_16:31">16:31</span> Let the heavens rejoice, and let the
earth be glad; And let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth!

<span id="an_16:32">16:32</span> Let the sea roar, and the fulness
thereof; Let the field exult, and all that is therein.

<span id="an_16:33">16:33</span> Then shall the trees of the forest sing
out at the presence of Jehovah, For he cometh to judge the earth.

<span id="an_16:34">16:34</span> Give thanks unto Jehovah, for he is
good; For his loving-kindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_16:35">16:35</span> And say, Save us, O God of our
salvation, And gather us, and deliver us from the nations, To give
thanks unto thy holy name, To triumph in thy praise.

<span id="an_16:36">16:36</span> Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel,
from eternity and to eternity! And all the people said, Amen! and
praised Jehovah.

<span id="an_16:37">16:37</span> And he left there, before the ark of
the covenant of Jehovah, Asaph and his brethren, to do the service
before the ark continually, as every day's duty required;

<span id="an_16:38">16:38</span> and Obed-Edom, and their brethren,
sixty-eight; Obed-Edom also, the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah as
doorkeepers.

<span id="an_16:39">16:39</span> And Zadok the priest, and his brethren
the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah in the high place that was
at Gibeon,

<span id="an_16:40">16:40</span> to offer up burnt-offerings to Jehovah
on the altar of burnt-offering continually, morning and evening, and
according to all that is written in the law of Jehovah, which he
commanded Israel;

<span id="an_16:41">16:41</span> and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and
the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to
Jehovah, because his loving-kindness \[endureth\] for ever;

<span id="an_16:42">16:42</span> and with them, \[with\] Heman and
Jeduthun, trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud; and
the musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were at the
gate.

<span id="an_16:43">16:43</span> And all the people departed every one
to his house; and David returned to bless his household.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> And it came to pass as David dwelt in his
house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Behold, I dwell in a house
of cedars, and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah under curtains.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> And Nathan said to David, Do all that is
in thy heart; for God is with thee.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> And it came to pass that night that the
word of God came to Nathan saying,

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> Go and say to David my servant, Thus
saith Jehovah: Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in;

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> for I have not dwelt in a house since the
day that I brought up Israel to this day; but I have been from tent to
tent, and from \[one\] tabernacle \[to another\].

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> In all my going about with all Israel,
did I speak a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to
feed my people, saying, Why build ye me not a house of cedars?

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> And now, thus shalt thou say unto my
servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I took thee from the
pasture-grounds, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people
Israel;

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> and I have been with thee whithersoever
thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and
have made thee a name, like unto the name of the great men that are on
the earth.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> And I will appoint a place for my people
Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their
own, and be disturbed no more; neither shall the sons of wickedness
waste them any more, as formerly,

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> and since the days that I commanded
judges to be over my people Israel. And I will subdue all thine enemies;
and I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> And it shall come to pass, when thy
days are fulfilled that thou must go \[to be\] with thy fathers, that I
will set up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will
establish his kingdom.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> It is he who shall build me a house,
and I will establish his throne for ever.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> I will be his father, and he shall be
my son; and I will not take away my mercy from him, as I took it from
him that was before thee;

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> and I will settle him in my house and
in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> According to all these words, and
according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> And king David went in and sat before
Jehovah, and said, Who am I, Jehovah Elohim, and what is my house, that
thou hast brought me hitherto?

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> And this hath been a small thing in thy
sight, O God; and thou hast spoken of thy servant's house for a great
while to come, and hast regarded me according to the rank of a man of
high degree, Jehovah Elohim.

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> What can David \[say\] more to thee for
the glory of thy servant? thou indeed knowest thy servant.

<span id="an_17:19">17:19</span> Jehovah, for thy servant's sake, and
according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, to make
known all these great things.

<span id="an_17:20">17:20</span> Jehovah, there is none like thee,
neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have
heard with our ears.

<span id="an_17:21">17:21</span> And who is like thy people Israel, the
one nation in the earth that God went to redeem to be a people to
himself, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving
out nations from before thy people, which thou hast redeemed out of
Egypt?

<span id="an_17:22">17:22</span> And thy people Israel hast thou made
thine own people for ever; and thou, Jehovah, art become their God.

<span id="an_17:23">17:23</span> And now, Jehovah, let the word that
thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be
established for ever, and do as thou hast said.

<span id="an_17:24">17:24</span> Let it even be established, and let thy
name be magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel,
is God to Israel; and let the house of David thy servant be established
before thee.

<span id="an_17:25">17:25</span> For thou, my God, hast revealed to thy
servant that thou wilt build him a house; therefore hath thy servant
found \[in his heart\] to pray before thee.

<span id="an_17:26">17:26</span> And now, Jehovah, thou art that God,
and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant;

<span id="an_17:27">17:27</span> and now, let it please thee to bless
the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever; for thou,
Jehovah, hast blessed \[it\], and it shall be blessed for ever.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> And after this it came to pass that David
smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out
of the hand of the Philistines.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> And he smote the Moabites; and the
Moabites became David's servants, \[and\] brought gifts.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah,
at Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> And David took from him a thousand
chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and
David houghed all the chariot \[horses\], but reserved of them \[for\] a
hundred chariots.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> And the Syrians of Damascus came to help
Hadarezer king of Zobah, and David smote of the Syrians twenty-two
thousand men.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> And David put \[garrisons\] in Syria of
Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, \[and\] brought
gifts. And Jehovah preserved David whithersoever he went.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> And David took the shields of gold that
were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> And from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities
of Hadarezer, David took very much brass, of which Solomon made the
brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> And Tou king of Hamath heard that David
had smitten all the forces of Hadarezer king of Zobah;

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> and he sent Hadoram his son to king
David to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had
fought against Hadarezer and smitten him; for Hadarezer was continually
at war with Tou; \[he sent\] also all manner of vessels of gold and
silver and bronze.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> Them also king David dedicated to
Jehovah, with the silver and the gold that he had brought from all the
nations: from the Edomites, and from the Moabites, and from the children
of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from the Amalekites.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> And Abishai the son of Zeruiah smote of
the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> And he put garrisons in Edom; and all
they of Edom became servants to David. And Jehovah preserved David
whithersoever he went.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> And David reigned over all Israel, and
executed judgment and justice to all his people.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over
the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was chronicler;

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and
Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was
over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were the
first at the king's hand.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> And it came to pass after this that
Nahash king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his
stead.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> And David said, I will shew kindness to
Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And
David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David's
servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to
comfort him.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> And the princes of the children of Ammon
said to Hanun, Is it, in thine eyes, to honour thy father that David has
sent comforters to thee? Is it not to search and overthrow, and to spy
out the land that his servants are come to thee?

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> And Hanun took David's servants, and had
them shaved, and their raiment cut off in the midst, as far as the hip,
and sent them away.

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> And \[certain\] went and told David
concerning the men; and he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly
ashamed. And the king said, Abide at Jericho until your beards be grown,
and then return.

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> And the children of Ammon saw that they
had made themselves odious to David; and Hanun and the children of Ammon
sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out
of Mesopotamia, and from the Syrians of Maacah, and from Zobah.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> And they hired thirty-two thousand
chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people; and they came and
encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered together from
their cities, and came to battle.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> And David heard \[of it\], and he sent
Joab, and all the host, the mighty men.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> And the children of Ammon came out, and
put the battle in array at the entrance of the city; and the kings that
had come were by themselves on the field.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> And Joab saw that the front of the
battle was against him before and behind; and he chose out of all the
choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians;

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> and the rest of the people he gave into
the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array
against the children of Ammon.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> And he said, If the Syrians be too
strong for me, then thou shalt help me; and if the children of Ammon be
too strong for thee, then I will help thee.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> Be strong, and let us shew ourselves
valiant for our people, and for the cities of our God; and Jehovah will
do what is good in his sight.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> And Joab and the people that were with
him drew near in front of the Syrians to the battle; and they fled
before him.

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> And when the children of Ammon saw that
the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and
entered into the city. And Joab came to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> And when the Syrians saw that they were
routed before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians
that were beyond the river; and Shophach the captain of the host of
Hadarezer \[went\] before them.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> And it was told David; and he gathered
all Israel, and passed over the Jordan, and came upon them, and set
\[the battle\] in array against them. And David put the battle in array
against the Syrians, and they fought with him.

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> And the Syrians fled from before
Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand \[in\] chariots,
and forty thousand footmen, and slew Shophach the captain of the host.

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> And the servants of Hadarezer saw that
they were routed before Israel, and they made peace with David, and
became his servants. And the Syrians would no more help the children of
Ammon.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> And it came to pass at the time of the
return of the year, at the time when kings go forth, that Joab led forth
the power of the army, and laid waste the land of the children of Ammon,
and came and besieged Rabbah. But David abode at Jerusalem. And Joab
smote Rabbah, and overthrew it.

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> And David took the crown of their king
from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there
were precious stones in it; and it was \[set\] upon David's head: and he
brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> And he brought out the people that were
in it, and cut them with the saw, and with harrows of iron, and with
saws. And so David did to all the cities of the children of Ammon. And
David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> And it came to pass after this, that
there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; then Sibbechai the
Hushathite smote Sippai, one of the children of Rapha; and they were
subdued.

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> And there was again a battle with the
Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair smote Lahmi the brother of
Goliath the Gittite; now the shaft of his spear was like a weaver's
beam.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> And there was again a battle, at Gath;
and there was a man \[there\] of great stature, whose fingers \[and
toes\] were four and twenty, six \[on each hand\], and six \[on each
foot\]; and he also was born to Rapha.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> And he defied Israel; but Jonathan the
son of Shimea David's brother smote him.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> These were born to Rapha in Gath; and
they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> And Satan stood up against Israel, and
moved David to number Israel.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> And David said to Joab and to the princes
of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring
the number of them to me, that I may know it.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> And Joab said, Jehovah add to his people,
how many soever they be, a hundredfold: are they not all, my lord O
king, my lord's servants? why does my lord require this thing? why
should he become a trespass to Israel?

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> But the king's word prevailed against
Joab; and Joab departed, and went through all Israel, and came \[again\]
to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> And Joab gave the sum of the number of
the people to David. And all they of Israel were eleven hundred thousand
men that drew sword; and of Judah, four hundred and seventy thousand men
that drew sword.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> But Levi and Benjamin he did not count
among them; for the king's word was abominable to Joab.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> And God was displeased on account of this
thing, and he smote Israel.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> And David said to God, I have sinned
greatly, in that I have done this thing; and now, I beseech thee, put
away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> And Jehovah spoke to Gad, David's seer,
saying,

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> Go and speak to David saying, Thus
saith Jehovah: I offer thee three \[things\]; choose one of them, that I
may do it unto thee.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> And Gad came to David, and said to him,
Thus saith Jehovah:

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> Choose thee, either three years of
famine, or three months to be destroyed before thine adversaries while
that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee, or three days the sword
of Jehovah and the pestilence in the land, and the angel of Jehovah
destroying through all the borders of Israel. And now consider what word
I shall bring again to him that sent me.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> And David said to Gad, I am in a great
strait: let me fall, I pray thee, into the hand of Jehovah, for his
mercies are very great; but let me not fall into the hand of man.

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> And Jehovah sent a pestilence upon
Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to
destroy it; and as he was destroying, Jehovah beheld, and he repented
him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough;
withdraw now thine hand. And the angel of Jehovah stood by the
threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> And David lifted up his eyes, and saw
the angel of Jehovah stand between the earth and the heavens, and his
sword drawn in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem. And David and the
elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> And David said to God, Is it not I that
commanded the people to be numbered? It is I that have sinned and done
evil; but these sheep, what have they done? Let thy hand, I pray thee,
Jehovah my God, be on me and on my father's house; but not on thy
people, that they should be smitten.

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> And the angel of Jehovah commanded Gad
to say to David, that David should go up and rear an altar to Jehovah in
the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> And David went up at the saying of Gad,
which he had spoken in the name of Jehovah.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> And Ornan turned back and saw the
angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was
threshing wheat.

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> And David came to Ornan, and Ornan
looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed
himself to David with \[his\] face to the ground.

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> And David said to Ornan, Grant me the
place of the threshing-floor, that I may build an altar in it to
Jehovah: grant it to me for the full money, that the plague may be
stayed from the people.

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> And Ornan said to David, Take it to
thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his sight: see,
I give the oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing-sledges for
wood, and the wheat for the oblation; I give it all.

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> And king David said to Ornan, No; but I
will in any case buy \[them\] for the full money; for I will not take
that which is thine for Jehovah, to offer up a burnt-offering without
cost.

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> And David gave to Ornan for the place
in shekels of gold the weight of six hundred \[shekels\].

<span id="an_21:26">21:26</span> And David built there an altar to
Jehovah, and offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called
upon Jehovah; and he answered him from the heavens by fire upon the
altar of burnt-offering.

<span id="an_21:27">21:27</span> And Jehovah spoke to the angel; and he
put up his sword again into its sheath.

<span id="an_21:28">21:28</span> At that time when David saw that
Jehovah had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite,
then he sacrificed there.

<span id="an_21:29">21:29</span> And the tabernacle of Jehovah, which
Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were
at that time in the high place at Gibeon.

<span id="an_21:30">21:30</span> But David could not go before it to
inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of
Jehovah.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> And David said, This is the house of
Jehovah Elohim, and this is the altar of burnt-offering for Israel.

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> And David commanded to collect the
strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew
wrought stones to build the house of God.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> And David prepared iron in abundance for
the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joists, and brass in
abundance without weight;

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> and cedar-trees innumerable; for the
Zidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar-wood in abundance to David.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> For David said, Solomon my son is young
and tender, and the house that is to be built for Jehovah must be
exceeding great in fame and in beauty in all lands: I will therefore
make preparation for it. And David prepared abundantly before his death.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> And he called for Solomon his son, and
charged him to build a house for Jehovah the God of Israel.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> And David said to Solomon, As for me, my
son, I was minded to build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God.

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> But the word of Jehovah came to me
saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou
shalt not build a house unto my name, for thou hast shed much blood upon
the earth in my sight.

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who
shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies
round about; for his name shall be Solomon, and in his days I will give
peace and quietness unto Israel.

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> He shall build a house unto my name;
and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish
the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> Now, my son, Jehovah be with thee, that
thou mayest prosper, and build the house of Jehovah thy God, as he has
said of thee.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> Only, Jehovah give thee wisdom and
understanding, and place thee over Israel, and to keep the law of
Jehovah thy God.

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest
heed to perform the statutes and ordinances which Jehovah commanded
Moses for Israel: be strong and courageous; fear not, neither be
dismayed.

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> And behold, in my affliction I have
prepared for the house of Jehovah a hundred thousand talents of gold,
and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without
weight, for it is in abundance; and timber and stone have I prepared;
and thou shalt add to it.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> And there are workmen with thee in
abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of
skilful men for every kind of work.

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> Of the gold, the silver, and the brass,
and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing and Jehovah be with
thee.

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> And David commanded all the princes of
Israel to help Solomon his son, \[saying,\]

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> Is not Jehovah your God with you? and
has he \[not\] given you rest on every side? for he has given the
inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before
Jehovah, and before his people.

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> Now set your heart and your soul to
seek Jehovah your God; and arise and build the sanctuary of Jehovah
Elohim, to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and the vessels of
the sanctuary of God into the house that is to be built unto the name of
Jehovah.

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> And David was old and full of days; and
he made Solomon his son king over Israel.

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> And he gathered together all the princes
of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> And the Levites were numbered from thirty
years old and upward; and their number, by their polls, man by man, was
thirty-eight thousand.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> Of these, twenty-four thousand were to
preside over the work of the house of Jehovah; and six thousand were
officers and judges;

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> and four thousand were doorkeepers; and
four thousand praised Jehovah with the instruments which I made, \[said
David,\] to praise \[therewith\].

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> And David divided them into courses
according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> Of the Gershonites: Laadan and Shimei.

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> The sons of Laadan: the head was Jehiel,
and Zetham, and Joel, three.

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> The sons of Shimei: Shelomith, and
Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chief fathers of Laadan.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Ziza,
and Jeush, and Beriah. These were the four sons of Shimei.

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> And Jahath was the head, and Ziza the
second; and Jeush and Beriah had not many sons: as father's house,
therefore, they were reckoned as one.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> The sons of Kohath: Amram, Jizhar,
Hebron, and Uzziel, four.

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. And
Aaron was separated, that he should be hallowed as most holy, he and his
sons for ever, to offer before Jehovah, to do service to him, and to
bless in his name for ever.

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> -- And as to Moses the man of God, his
sons were named of the tribe of Levi.

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the head.

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> And the sons of Eliezer: Rehabiah the
head; and Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very
many.

<span id="an_23:18">23:18</span> -- The sons of Jizhar: Shelomith the
head.

<span id="an_23:19">23:19</span> The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the head,
Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.

<span id="an_23:20">23:20</span> The sons of Uzziel: Micah the head, and
Jishijah the second.

<span id="an_23:21">23:21</span> The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi.
The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.

<span id="an_23:22">23:22</span> And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but
daughters; and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.

<span id="an_23:23">23:23</span> The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and
Jeremoth, three.

<span id="an_23:24">23:24</span> These were the sons of Levi according
to their fathers' houses, the chief fathers, as they were reckoned, by
number of names by their polls, who did the work of the service of the
house of Jehovah, from twenty years old and upward.

<span id="an_23:25">23:25</span> For David said, Jehovah the God of
Israel has given rest to his people, and he will dwell in Jerusalem for
ever;

<span id="an_23:26">23:26</span> and the Levites also have no more to
carry the tabernacle, nor any of its vessels for its service.

<span id="an_23:27">23:27</span> For by the last words of David was this
\[done\], -- the numbering of the sons of Levi from twenty years old and
upward.

<span id="an_23:28">23:28</span> For their place was by the side of the
sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah, over the courts,
and over the chambers, and over the purifying of all holy things, and
\[for\] the work of the service of the house of God;

<span id="an_23:29">23:29</span> and for the loaves to be set in rows,
and for the fine flour for the oblation, and for the unleavened cakes,
and for \[what is baked in\] the pan, and for that which is saturated
\[with oil\], and for all measure of capacity and size;

Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of Jehovah.

father, and had no children; and Eleazar and Ithamar exercised the
priesthood.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> And David distributed them, both Zadok of
the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to
their office in their service.

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> And there were more head-men found of the
sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar, and \[thus\] were they
divided: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen heads of fathers'
houses, and eight of the sons of Ithamar according to their fathers'
houses.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> And they were divided by lot, one with

Gilead;)

<span id="an_26:32">26:32</span> and his brethren, men of valour, two

These were the princes of the tribes of Israel.

<span id="an_27:23">27:23</span> And David took not their number from

Israel as the stars of heaven.

<span id="an_27:24">27:24</span> Joab the son of Zeruiah began to
number, but he did not finish; and there fell wrath for it upon Israel;

was Shitrai the Sharonite; and over the herds in the valleys was Shaphat
the son of Adlai.

Ishmaelite; and over the asses was Jehdiah the Meronothite.

<span id="an_27:31">27:31</span> And over the flocks was Jaziz the

David's.

<span id="an_27:32">27:32</span> And Jonathan, David's uncle, was
counsellor, a wise man, and a scribe; and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was
with the king's sons;

<span id="an_27:33">27:33</span> and Ahithophel was the king's
counsellor; and Hushai the Archite was the king's friend;

<span id="an_28:1">28:1</span> And David assembled all the princes of
Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the princes of the divisions that
ministered to the king, and the captains over thousands, and the
captains over hundreds, and the comptrollers of all the substance and
possessions of the king and of his sons, with the chamberlains, and the
mighty men, and all the men of valour, unto Jerusalem.

<span id="an_28:2">28:2</span> And king David stood up upon his feet,
and said, Hear me, my brethren and my people! I had in my heart to build
a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and for the
footstool of our God, and I have prepared to build.

<span id="an_28:3">28:3</span> But God said to me, Thou shalt not build
a house unto my name, for thou art a man of war, and hast shed blood.

<span id="an_28:4">28:4</span> And Jehovah the God of Israel chose me
out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever; for
he has chosen Judah to be the prince; and of the house of Judah, the
house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in
me to make me king over all Israel;

<span id="an_28:5">28:5</span> and of all my sons, (for Jehovah has
given me many sons,) he has chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne
of the kingdom of Jehovah over Israel.

<span id="an_28:6">28:6</span> And he said to me, Solomon thy son, he
shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son,
and I will be his father.

<span id="an_28:7">28:7</span> And I will establish his kingdom for
ever, if he be firm to do my commandments and mine ordinances, as at
this day.

<span id="an_28:8">28:8</span> And now in the sight of all Israel, the
congregation of Jehovah, and in the audience of our God, -- keep and
seek for all the commandments of Jehovah your God; that ye may possess
the good land, and leave it as an inheritance to your children after you
for ever.

<span id="an_28:9">28:9</span> And thou, Solomon my son, know the God of
thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind;
for Jehovah searches all hearts, and discerns all the imaginations of
the thoughts. If thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou
forsake him, he will cut thee off for ever.

<span id="an_28:10">28:10</span> Consider now, that Jehovah has chosen
thee to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do \[it\].

<span id="an_28:11">28:11</span> And David gave to Solomon his son the
pattern of the porch, and of its houses, and of its treasuries, and of
its upper chambers, and of its inner chambers, and of the house of the
mercy-seat;

<span id="an_28:12">28:12</span> and the pattern of all that he had by
the Spirit, of the courts of the house of Jehovah, and of all the
chambers round about, for the treasuries of the house of God, and for
the treasuries of the dedicated things;

<span id="an_28:13">28:13</span> and for the courses of the priests and
the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of
Jehovah, and for all the instruments of service in the house of Jehovah:

<span id="an_28:14">28:14</span> gold by weight for \[things\] of gold,
for all utensils of each kind of service; for all utensils of silver, by
weight, for all utensils of each kind of service;

<span id="an_28:15">28:15</span> and the weight of the golden
candlesticks, and of their golden lamps, by weight for every
candlestick, and for its lamps; and for the silver candlesticks, by
weight, for the candlestick and for its lamps, according to the use of
every candlestick;

<span id="an_28:16">28:16</span> and gold by weight for the tables of
the \[loaves\] to be set in rows, for every table; and silver for the
tables of silver;

<span id="an_28:17">28:17</span> and pure gold for the forks, and the
bowls, and the goblets; and for the golden basons by weight for every
bason; and for the silver basons by weight for every bason;

<span id="an_28:18">28:18</span> and for the altar of incense, refined
gold by weight; and the pattern of the chariot of the cherubim of gold,
which spread out \[their wings\] and cover the ark of the covenant of
Jehovah.

<span id="an_28:19">28:19</span> All this \[said David,\] in writing, by
Jehovah's hand upon me, instructing as to all the works of the pattern.

<span id="an_28:20">28:20</span> And David said to Solomon his son, Be
strong and courageous, and do it; fear not nor be dismayed: for Jehovah
Elohim, my God, will be with thee; he will not leave thee, neither
forsake thee, until all the work for the service of the house of Jehovah
is finished.

<span id="an_28:21">28:21</span> And behold, the courses of the priests
and the Levites are for all the service of the house of God; and thou
hast with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing man, skilful
for every sort of service; and the princes and all the people are wholly
at thy commandment.

<span id="an_29:1">29:1</span> And king David said to all the
congregation, Solomon my son, the one whom God has chosen, is young and
tender, and the work is great; for this palace is not to be for man, but
for Jehovah Elohim.

<span id="an_29:2">29:2</span> And I have prepared according to all my
power for the house of my God gold for \[things of\] gold, and silver
for \[things of\] silver, and brass for \[things of\] brass, iron for
\[things of\] iron, and wood for \[things of\] wood; onyx stones, and
\[stones\] to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all
manner of precious stones, and white marble in abundance.

<span id="an_29:3">29:3</span> And moreover, in my affection for the
house of my God I have given of my own property of gold and silver, for
the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the
house of the sanctuary:

<span id="an_29:4">29:4</span> three thousand talents of gold, of the
gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay
the walls of the houses;

<span id="an_29:5">29:5</span> gold for \[things of\] gold, and silver
for \[things of\] silver, and for all manner of work by the hands of
artificers. And who is willing to offer to Jehovah this day?

<span id="an_29:6">29:6</span> And the chief fathers and princes of the
tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and the
comptrollers of the king's business, offered willingly.

<span id="an_29:7">29:7</span> And they gave for the service of the
house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, and
ten thousand talents of silver, and eighteen thousand talents of brass,
and one hundred thousand talents of iron.

<span id="an_29:8">29:8</span> And they with whom stones were found gave
\[them\] to the treasure of the house of Jehovah, into the hand of
Jehiel the Gershonite.

<span id="an_29:9">29:9</span> And the people rejoiced because they
offered willingly, for with perfect heart they offered willingly to
Jehovah; and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.

<span id="an_29:10">29:10</span> And David blessed Jehovah in the sight
of all the congregation; and David said, Blessed be thou, Jehovah, the
God of our father Israel, for ever and ever.

<span id="an_29:11">29:11</span> Thine, Jehovah, is the greatness, and
the power, and the glory, and the splendour, and the majesty; for all
that is in the heavens and on the earth is thine: thine, Jehovah, is the
kingdom, and thou art exalted as Head above all;

<span id="an_29:12">29:12</span> and riches and glory are of thee, and
thou rulest over everything; and in thy hand is power and might; and in
thy hand it is to make all great and strong.

<span id="an_29:13">29:13</span> And now, our God, we thank thee, and
praise thy glorious name.

<span id="an_29:14">29:14</span> But who am I, and what is my people,
that we should be able to offer willingly after this manner? for all is
of thee, and of that which is from thy hand have we given thee.

<span id="an_29:15">29:15</span> For we are strangers before thee, and
sojourners, as all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow,
and there is no hope \[of life\].

<span id="an_29:16">29:16</span> Jehovah our God, all this store that we
have prepared to build thee a house to thy holy name, is of thy hand,
and is all thine own.

<span id="an_29:17">29:17</span> And I know, my God, that thou triest
the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. In the uprightness of my
heart have I willingly offered all these things; and now have I seen
with joy thy people, which are present here, offer willingly to thee.

<span id="an_29:18">29:18</span> Jehovah, God of Abraham, of Isaac, and
of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the
thoughts of the heart of thy people, and direct their hearts to thee!

<span id="an_29:19">29:19</span> And give to Solomon my son a perfect
heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and
to do all, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.

<span id="an_29:20">29:20</span> And David said to all the congregation,
Bless now Jehovah your God. And all the congregation blessed Jehovah the
God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and did homage to
Jehovah and the king.

<span id="an_29:21">29:21</span> And they sacrificed sacrifices to
Jehovah, and offered up burnt-offerings to Jehovah, on the morrow after
that day: a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with
their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.

<span id="an_29:22">29:22</span> And they ate and drank before Jehovah
on that day with great joy. And they made Solomon the son of David king
the second time, and anointed him to Jehovah to be prince, and Zadok to
be priest.

<span id="an_29:23">29:23</span> And Solomon sat on the throne of
Jehovah as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all
Israel obeyed him.

<span id="an_29:24">29:24</span> And all the princes, and the mighty
men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to
Solomon the king.

<span id="an_29:25">29:25</span> And Jehovah magnified Solomon
exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him royal
majesty such as had not been on any king before him in Israel.

<span id="an_29:26">29:26</span> Now David the son of Jesse reigned over
all Israel.

<span id="an_29:27">29:27</span> And the time that he reigned over
Israel was forty years: he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned
thirty-three years in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_29:28">29:28</span> And he died in a good old age, full of
days, riches, and honour; and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_29:29">29:29</span> And the acts of David the king, first
and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and
in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer;

<span id="an_29:30">29:30</span> with all his reign and his might, and
the times that passed over him, and over Israel, and over all the
kingdoms of the countries.
