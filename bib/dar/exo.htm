<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;And these are the names of the sons of Israel who had come  into Egypt; with Jacob had they come, each with his household:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;And all the souls that had come out of the loins of Jacob  were seventy souls; and Joseph was in Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that  generation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel were fruitful, and swarmed and  multiplied, and became exceeding strong; and the land was full  of them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;And there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know  Joseph.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the  children of Israel are more numerous and stronger than we.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;Come on, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply,  and it come to pass that, if war occur, they take side with our  enemies and fight against us, and go up out of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;And they set over them service-masters to oppress them with  their burdens. And they built store-cities for Pharaoh, Pithom  and Rameses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied  and spread; and they were distressed because of the children of  Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;And the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve with  harshness;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;and they embittered their life with hard labour in clay and  bricks, and in all manner of labour in the field: all their  labour with which they made them serve was with harshness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives -- of  whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the  other was Puah --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;and he said, When ye help the Hebrew women in bearing, and  see [them] on the stool, if it be a son, then ye shall kill  him, but if a daughter, then she shall live.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of  Egypt had said to them, but saved the male children alive.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;And the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them,  Why have ye done this, and saved the male children alive?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women  are not as the Egyptian; for they are strong, and they have  borne before the midwife comes to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;And God dealt well with the midwives; and the people  multiplied and became very strong.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that  he made them houses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;Then Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that  is born ye shall cast into the river, but every daughter ye  shall save alive.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;And a man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of  Levi.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;And the woman conceived, and bore a son. And she saw him  that he was fair, and hid him three months.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an  ark of reeds, and plastered it with resin and with pitch, and  put the child in it, and laid [it] in the sedge on the bank of  the river.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;And his sister stood afar off to see what would happen to  him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;And the daughter of Pharaoh went down to bathe in the river;  and her maids went along by the river's side. And she saw the  ark in the midst of the sedge, and sent her handmaid and  fetched it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;And she opened [it], and saw the child, and behold, the boy  wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is [one] of  the Hebrews' children.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;And his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and  call thee a wet-nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse  the child for thee?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the damsel went  and called the child's mother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away and  nurse it for me, and I will give [thee] thy wages. And the  woman took the child and nursed it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;And when the child was grown, she brought him to Pharaoh's  daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses,  and said, Because I drew him out of the water.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown,  that he went out to his brethren and looked on their burdens;  and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;And he turned this way and that way, and when he saw that  there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the  sand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And he went out on the second day, and behold, two Hebrew  men were quarrelling; and he said to him that was in the wrong,  Why art thou smiting thy neighbour?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;And he said, Who made thee ruler and judge over us? dost  thou intend to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? Then  Moses feared, and said, Surely the matter is known.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh heard of this matter, and sought to slay Moses.  But Moses fled from before Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of  Midian. And he sat by the well.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;And the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came  and drew [water], and filled the troughs, to water their  father's flock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses rose  and helped them, and watered their flock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, Why are  ye come so soon to-day?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of  the shepherds, and also drew [water] abundantly for us, and  watered the flock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;And he said to his daughters, And where is he? why then  have ye left the man behind? Call him, that he may eat bread.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;And Moses consented to remain with the man; and he gave  Moses Zipporah his daughter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he  said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass during those many days, that the king  of Egypt died. And the children of Israel sighed because of the  bondage, and cried; and their cry came up to God because of the  bondage;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:24">2:24</A>&nbsp;and God heard their groaning, and God remembered his  covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:25">2:25</A>&nbsp;and God looked upon the children of Israel, and God  acknowledged [them].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;And Moses tended the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the  priest of Midian. And he led the flock behind the wilderness,  and came to the mountain of God -- to Horeb.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire  out of the midst of a thorn-bush: and he looked, and behold,  the thorn-bush burned with fire, and the thorn-bush was not  being consumed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;And Moses said, Let me now turn aside and see this great  sight, why the thorn-bush is not burnt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, and God called  to him out of the midst of the thorn-bush and said, Moses,  Moses! And he said, Here am I.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;And he said, Draw not nigh hither: loose thy sandals from  off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy  ground.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;And he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,  the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face;  for he was afraid to look at God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said, I have seen assuredly the affliction of my  people who are in Egypt, and their cry have I heard on account  of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the  Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good  and spacious land, unto a land flowing with milk and honey,  unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the  Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the  Jebusites.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;And now behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come  unto me; and I have also seen the oppression with which the  Egyptians oppress them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;And now come, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou  mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of  Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go unto  Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel  out of Egypt?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;And he said, For I will be with thee; and this shall be the  sign to thee that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought  forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this  mountain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;And Moses said to God, Behold, [when] I come unto the  children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your  fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say, What is his  name? what shall I say unto them?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM. And he said, Thus  shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: I AM hath sent me  unto you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;And God said moreover to Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto  the children of Israel: Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the  God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath  sent me unto you. This is my name for ever, and this is my  memorial unto all generations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto  them, Jehovah the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,  Isaac, and Jacob, hath appeared to me, saying, I have indeed  visited you, and [seen] that which is done unto you in Egypt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction  of Egypt, unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites,  and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the  Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;And they shall hearken to thy voice. And thou shalt come,  thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye  shall say unto him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, hath met  with us; and now, let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey  into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no,  not by a powerful hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;And I will stretch out my hand and smite Egypt with all my  wonders which I will do in the midst thereof; and after that he  will let you go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;And I will give this people favour in the eyes of the  Egyptians, and it shall come to pass, when ye go out, that ye  shall not go out empty;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;but every woman shall ask of her neighbour, and of her that  is the inmate of her house, utensils of silver, and utensils of  gold, and clothing; and ye shall put [them] on your sons and on  your daughters, and shall spoil the Egyptians.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;And Moses answered and said, But behold, they will not  believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say,  Jehovah has not appeared to thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to him, What is that in thy hand? And he  said, A staff.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the  ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand and take it  by the tail -- and he stretched out his hand and caught it, and  it became a staff in his hand --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;that they may believe that Jehovah, the God of their  fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of  Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said moreover to him, Put now thy hand into thy  bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom, and took it out, and  behold, his hand was leprous, as snow.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. And he put  his hand into his bosom again, and took it out of his bosom,  and behold, it was turned again as his flesh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee,  neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will  believe the voice of the other sign.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also  those two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou  shalt take of the water of the river, and pour [it] on the dry  [land]; and the water that thou takest out of the river shall  become blood upon the dry [land].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;And Moses said to Jehovah, Ah Lord! I am not eloquent,  neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken to thy servant,  for I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to him, Who gave man a mouth? or who  maketh dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? [have] not I,  Jehovah?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;And now go, and I will be with thy mouth, and will teach  thee what thou shalt say.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;And he said, Ah Lord! send, I pray thee, by the hand [of  him whom] thou wilt send.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;Then the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and he  said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can  speak well. And also behold, he goeth out to meet thee; and  when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his  mouth; and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and  will teach you what ye shall do.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;And he shall speak for thee unto the people; and it shall  come to pass that he shall be to thee for a mouth, and thou  shalt be to him for God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt take this staff in thy hand, with which thou  shalt do the signs.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law,  and said to him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return to my  brethren who are in Egypt, that I may see whether they are yet  alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses in Midian, Go, return to Egypt;  for all the men are dead who sought thy life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them riding  upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses  took the staff of God in his hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, When thou goest to return to  Egypt, see that thou do all the wonders before Pharaoh that I  have put in thy hand. And I will harden his heart, that he  shall not let the people go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt say to Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah: Israel  is my son, my firstborn.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;And I say to thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me. And  if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill thy son, thy  firstborn.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:24">4:24</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the way, in the inn, that Jehovah  came upon him, and sought to slay him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:25">4:25</A>&nbsp;Then Zipporah took a stone and cut off the foreskin of her  son, and cast it at his feet, and said, A bloody husband indeed  art thou to me!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:26">4:26</A>&nbsp;And he let him go. Then she said, A bloody husband --  because of the circumcision.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:27">4:27</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet  Moses. And he went, and met him on the mountain of God, and  kissed him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:28">4:28</A>&nbsp;And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah who had sent  him, and all the signs that he had commanded him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:29">4:29</A>&nbsp;And Moses and Aaron went and gathered all the elders of the  children of Israel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:30">4:30</A>&nbsp;and Aaron spoke all the words that Jehovah had spoken to  Moses, and did the signs before the eyes of the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:31">4:31</A>&nbsp;And the people believed. And when they heard that Jehovah  had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their  affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;And afterwards Moses and Aaron went in, and said to Pharaoh,  Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Let my people go that  they may celebrate a feast to me in the wilderness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah, to whose voice I am to  hearken to let Israel go? I do not know Jehovah, neither will I  let Israel go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us: let  us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness,  and sacrifice to Jehovah our God; lest he fall upon us with  pestilence or with sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do ye, Moses and  Aaron, wish to have the people go off from their works? Away,  to your burdens!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh said, Behold the people of the land are now  many, and ye wish to make them rest from their burdens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the  people, and their officers, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as  heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;And the number of the bricks they have made heretofore shall  ye lay upon them: ye shall not diminish any of it, for they are  idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go [and] sacrifice to  our God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;Let them put heavier labour on the men, that they may be  taken up with it, and not regard vain words.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;And the taskmasters of the people and their officers went  out and spoke to the people, saying, Thus says Pharaoh: I will  not give you straw:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;go ye, get yourselves straw where ye may find it; but none  of your work shall be diminished.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;And the people were scattered abroad throughout the land of  Egypt to gather stubble for straw.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;And the taskmasters urged [them], saying, Fulfil your  labours, the daily work, as when there was straw.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's  taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, [and] it was said,  Why have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick, both  yesterday and to-day, as heretofore?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried  to Pharaoh, saying, Why dost thou deal thus with thy bondmen?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;There is no straw given to thy bondmen, and they say to us,  Make brick; and behold, thy bondmen are beaten, but it is the  fault of thy people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;And he said, Ye are idle, idle! therefore ye say, Let us go  and sacrifice to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;And now go -- work! and straw shall not be given you, and  ye shall deliver the measure of bricks.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;And the officers of the children of Israel saw [that] it  stood ill with them, because it was said, Ye shall not diminish  anything from your bricks, the daily work.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood there to meet them,  as they came out from Pharaoh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;And they said to them, Jehovah look upon you and judge,  that ye have made our odour to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh,  and in the eyes of his bondmen, putting a sword into their hand  to kill us!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:22">5:22</A>&nbsp;And Moses returned to Jehovah, and said, Lord, why hast  thou done evil to this people? why now hast thou sent me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:23">5:23</A>&nbsp;For ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he  hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy  people at all!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do  to Pharaoh; for by a strong hand shall he let them go, and by a  strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;And God spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as  the Almighty &#249;God; but by my name Jehovah I was not made known  to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;And I established also my covenant with them, to give them  the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in which they  were sojourners.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;And I have heard also the groaning of the children of  Israel, whom the Egyptians have forced to serve, and I have  remembered my covenant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;Therefore say unto the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and  I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians,  and I will deliver you from their service, and I will redeem  you with a stretched-out arm, and with great judgments.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;And the frogs shall come up both upon thee and upon thy  people, and upon all thy bondmen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy  hand with thy staff over the streams, over the rivers, and over  the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt;  and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;And the scribes did so with their sorceries, and brought up  frogs on the land of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat  Jehovah, that he may take away the frogs from me and from my  people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice  to Jehovah.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;And he said, For to-morrow. And he said, Be it according to  thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like Jehovah  our God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses,  and from thy bondmen, and from thy people: they shall remain in  the river only.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried  to Jehovah because of the frogs that he had brought against  Pharaoh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and the  frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the  fields.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;And they gathered them in heaps; and the land stank.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh saw that there was respite; and he hardened his  heart, and hearkened not to them, as Jehovah had said.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy  staff, and smite the dust of the earth, and it shall become  gnats throughout the land of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his  staff, and smote the dust of the earth, and there arose gnats  on man and on beast: all the dust of the land became gnats  throughout the land of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;And the scribes did so with their sorceries, to bring forth  gnats; but they could not. And the gnats were on man and on  beast.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:19">8:19</A>&nbsp;Then the scribes said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of  God! But Pharaoh's heart was stubborn, and he hearkened not to  them, as Jehovah had said.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:20">8:20</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning,  and stand before Pharaoh -- behold, he will go out to the water  -- and say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let my people go, that  they may serve me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:21">8:21</A>&nbsp;For, if thou do not let my people go, behold, I will send  dog-flies upon thee, and upon thy bondmen, and upon thy people,  and into thy houses; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be  full of dog-flies, and also the ground on which they are.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:22">8:22</A>&nbsp;And I will distinguish in that day the land of Goshen, in  which my people dwell, that no dog-flies shall be there; that  thou mayest know that I Jehovah am in the midst of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:23">8:23</A>&nbsp;And I will put a separation between my people and thy  people; to-morrow shall this sign be.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:24">8:24</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah did so; and there came dog-flies in a multitude  into the house of Pharaoh, and [into] the houses of his  bondmen; and throughout the land of Egypt, the land was  corrupted by the dog-flies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:25">8:25</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, Go, sacrifice  to your God in the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:26">8:26</A>&nbsp;And Moses said, It is not proper to do so; for we should  sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God:  lo, if we sacrificed the abomination of the Egyptians before  their eyes, would they not stone us?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:27">8:27</A>&nbsp;We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and  sacrifice to Jehovah our God, as he shall command us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:28">8:28</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that you may sacrifice  to Jehovah your God in the wilderness; only, go not very far  away: intreat for me!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:29">8:29</A>&nbsp;And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and will  intreat Jehovah; and the dog-flies will depart from Pharaoh,  from his bondmen, and from his people, to-morrow; only let not  Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go  to sacrifice to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:30">8:30</A>&nbsp;And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:31">8:31</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and he  removed the dog-flies from Pharaoh, from his bondmen, and from  his people; there remained not one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:32">8:32</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and would  not let the people go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him,  Thus saith Jehovah the God of the Hebrews: Let my people go,  that they may serve me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;For if thou refuse to let them go, and shalt retain them  still,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;behold, the hand of Jehovah shall be on thy cattle which is  in the field, on the horses, on the asses, on the camels, on  the oxen and on the sheep, with a very grievous plague.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah will distinguish between the cattle of Israel  and the cattle of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all  that the children of Israel have.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah appointed a set time, saying, To-morrow will  Jehovah do this thing in the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah did this thing on the following day, and all the  cattle of Egypt died; but of the cattle of the children of  Israel died not one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh sent, and behold, there was not one of the  cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was  hardened, and he did not let the people go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to yourselves  handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses scatter it  toward the heavens before the eyes of Pharaoh.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before  Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it toward the heavens; and it  became boils [with] blisters breaking out on man and on cattle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;And the scribes could not stand before Moses because of the  boils; for the boils were on the scribes, and on all the  Egyptians.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and he did not  hearken to them, as Jehovah had told Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning,  and set thyself before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus saith  Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews: Let my people go, that they  may serve me.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and  rested in all the borders of Egypt, very grievous; before them  there were no such locusts as they, neither after them will be  such.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;And they covered the face of the whole land, so that the  land was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land, and all  the fruit of the trees that the hail had left; and there  remained not any green thing on the trees, and in the herbs of  the field, throughout the land of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said,  I have sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:17">10:17</A>&nbsp;And now, forgive, I pray you, my sin only this time, and  intreat Jehovah your God that he may take away from me this  death only!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:18">10:18</A>&nbsp;And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:19">10:19</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah turned a very powerful west wind, which took  away the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea: there  remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:20">10:20</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and he did not  let the children of Israel go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:21">10:21</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward the  heavens, that there may be darkness in the land of Egypt -- so  that one may feel darkness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:22">10:22</A>&nbsp;And Moses stretched out his hand toward the heavens; and  there was a thick darkness throughout the land of Egypt three  days:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:23">10:23</A>&nbsp;they saw not one another, neither rose any from his place,  for three days. But all the children of Israel had light in  their dwellings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:24">10:24</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh called Moses and said, Go, serve Jehovah;  only, let your flocks and your herds remain; let your little  ones also go with you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:25">10:25</A>&nbsp;And Moses said, Thou must give also sacrifices and  burnt-offerings into our hands, that we may sacrifice to  Jehovah our God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:26">10:26</A>&nbsp;Our cattle also must go with us: there shall not a hoof be  left behind; for we must take thereof to serve Jehovah our God;  and we do not know with what we must serve Jehovah, until we  come there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:27">10:27</A>&nbsp;But Jehovah made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and he would  not let them go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:28">10:28</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh said to him, Get thee from me, take heed to  thyself, see my face no more; for in the day thou seest my face  thou shalt die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:29">10:29</A>&nbsp;And Moses said, Thou hast spoken rightly: I will see thy  face again no more!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:1">11:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, Yet one plague will I bring upon  Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence:  when he shall let [you] go altogether, he shall utterly drive  you out hence.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;Speak now in the ears of the people, that they ask every  man of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour,  utensils of silver and utensils of gold.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah gave the people favour in the eyes of the  Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of  Egypt -- in the eyes of Pharaoh's bondmen, and in the eyes of  the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:4">11:4</A>&nbsp;And Moses said, Thus saith Jehovah: About midnight I will  go out into the midst of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:5">11:5</A>&nbsp;And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from  the firstborn of Pharaoh who sitteth on his throne, even unto  the firstborn of the bondwoman that is behind the mill; and all  the firstborn of cattle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:6">11:6</A>&nbsp;And there shall be a great cry throughout the land of  Egypt, such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like  it any more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:7">11:7</A>&nbsp;But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog  move his tongue, against man or beast; that ye may know that  Jehovah distinguisheth between the Egyptians and Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:8">11:8</A>&nbsp;And all these thy bondmen shall come down unto me, and bow  down to me, saying, Go out, thou, and all the people that  follow thee; and after that I will go out. And he went out from  Pharaoh in a glowing anger.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:9">11:9</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah had said to Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken to  you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:10">11:10</A>&nbsp;And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh;  but Jehovah made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and he did not let  the children of Israel go out of his land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:1">12:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,  saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:2">12:2</A>&nbsp;This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it  shall be the first month of the year to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:3">12:3</A>&nbsp;Speak unto all the assembly of Israel, saying, On the tenth  of this month let them take themselves each a lamb, for a  father's house, a lamb for a house.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:5">12:5</A>&nbsp;Your lamb shall be without blemish, a yearling male; ye  shall take [it] from the sheep, or from the goats.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:6">12:6</A>&nbsp;And ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this  month; and the whole congregation of the assembly of Israel  shall kill it between the two evenings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:7">12:7</A>&nbsp;And they shall take of the blood, and put [it] on the two  door-posts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat  it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:8">12:8</A>&nbsp;And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with  fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter [herbs] shall they eat  it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:9">12:9</A>&nbsp;Ye shall eat none of it raw, nor boiled at all with water,  but roast with fire; its head with its legs and with its  in-wards.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:10">12:10</A>&nbsp;And ye shall let none of it remain until the morning; and  what remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:11">12:11</A>&nbsp;And thus shall ye eat it: your loins shall be girded, your  sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall  eat it in haste; it is Jehovah's passover.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:12">12:12</A>&nbsp;And I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and  smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and  beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute  judgment: I am Jehovah.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:14">12:14</A>&nbsp;And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye  shall celebrate it [as] a feast to Jehovah; throughout your  generations [as] an ordinance for ever shall ye celebrate it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:15">12:15</A>&nbsp;Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread: on the very  first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses; for  whoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the  seventh day -- that soul shall be cut off from Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:16">12:16</A>&nbsp;And on the first day ye shall have a holy convocation, and  on the seventh day a holy convocation: no manner of work shall  be done on them, save what is eaten by every person -- that  only shall be done by you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:17">12:17</A>&nbsp;And ye shall keep the [feast of] unleavened [bread]; for  in this same day have I brought your hosts out of the land of  Egypt; and ye shall keep this day in your generations [as] an  ordinance for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:18">12:18</A>&nbsp;In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month,  in the evening, ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one and  twentieth day of the month in the evening.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:19">12:19</A>&nbsp;Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses;  for whoever eateth what is leavened -- that soul shall be cut  off from the assembly of Israel, whether he be a sojourner, or  born in the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:20">12:20</A>&nbsp;Ye shall eat nothing leavened: in all your dwellings shall  ye eat unleavened bread.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:21">12:21</A>&nbsp;And Moses called all the elders of Israel, and said to  them, Seize and take yourselves lambs for your families, and  kill the passover.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:22">12:22</A>&nbsp;And take a bunch of hyssop, and dip [it] in the blood that  is in the bason, and smear the lintel and the two door-posts  with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go  out of the door of his house until the morning.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:23">12:23</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and  when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two  door-posts, Jehovah will pass over the door, and will not  suffer the destroyer to come into your houses to smite [you].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:24">12:24</A>&nbsp;And ye shall observe this as an ordinance for thee and for  thy sons for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:25">12:25</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, when ye are come into the land  that Jehovah will give you, as he has promised, that ye shall  keep this service.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:26">12:26</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say to  you, What mean ye by this service?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:27">12:27</A>&nbsp;that ye shall say, It is a sacrifice of passover to  Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel  in Egypt when he smote the Egyptians and delivered our houses.  And the people bowed their heads and worshipped.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:28">12:28</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel went away, and did as Jehovah  had commanded Moses and Aaron; so did they.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:29">12:29</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass that at midnight Jehovah smote all the  firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh  who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive that was  in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of cattle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:30">12:30</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his bondmen,  and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for  there was not a house in which there was not one dead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:31">12:31</A>&nbsp;And he called Moses and Aaron in the night, and said, Rise  up, go away from among my people, both ye and the children of  Israel; and go, serve Jehovah, as ye have said.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:32">12:32</A>&nbsp;Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and  go; and bless me also.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:33">12:33</A>&nbsp;And the Egyptians urged the people, to send them out of  the land in haste; for they said, We are all dead [men]!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:34">12:34</A>&nbsp;And the people took their dough before it was leavened;  their kneading-troughs bound up in their clothes upon their  shoulders.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:35">12:35</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel had done according to the word  of Moses, and they had asked of the Egyptians utensils of  silver, and utensils of gold, and clothing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:36">12:36</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah had given the people favour in the eyes of the  Egyptians, and they gave to them; and they spoiled the  Egyptians.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:37">12:37</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to  Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot [that were] men,  besides children.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:38">12:38</A>&nbsp;And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks  and herds -- very much cattle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:39">12:39</A>&nbsp;And they baked the dough that they brought forth out of  Egypt into unleavened cakes, for it was not leavened; for they  were driven out of Egypt, and could not wait; neither had they  prepared for themselves any food.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:40">12:40</A>&nbsp;And the residence of the children of Israel that they  resided in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:41">12:41</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and  thirty years, on that same day it came to pass that all the  hosts of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:42">12:42</A>&nbsp;It is a night of observance to Jehovah, because of their  being brought out from the land of Egypt: that same night is an  observance to Jehovah for all the children of Israel in their  generations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:43">12:43</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance  of the passover: No stranger shall eat of it;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:45">12:45</A>&nbsp;A settler and a hired servant shall not eat it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:46">12:46</A>&nbsp;In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth  any of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye  break a bone thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:47">12:47</A>&nbsp;All the assembly of Israel shall hold it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:48">12:48</A>&nbsp;And when a sojourner sojourneth with thee, and would hold  the passover to Jehovah, let all his males be circumcised, and  then let him come near and hold it; and he shall be as one that  is born in the land; but no uncircumcised person shall eat  thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:49">12:49</A>&nbsp;One law shall be for him that is home-born and for the  sojourner that sojourneth among you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:50">12:50</A>&nbsp;And all the children of Israel did as Jehovah had  commanded Moses and Aaron; so did they.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:51">12:51</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on that same day, [that] Jehovah  brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt  according to their hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:2">13:2</A>&nbsp;Hallow unto me every firstborn, whatever breaketh open the  womb among the children of Israel, of man and of cattle: it is  mine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:3">13:3</A>&nbsp;And Moses said to the people, Remember this day, in which  ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for with a  powerful hand hath Jehovah brought you out from this; and  nothing leavened shall be eaten.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:4">13:4</A>&nbsp;Ye come out to-day, in the month Abib.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;And it shall be when Jehovah hath brought thee into the  land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the  Hivite and the Jebusite, which he swore to thy fathers to give  thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep  this service in this month.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread; and in the  seventh day is a feast to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:7">13:7</A>&nbsp;Unleavened bread shall be eaten the seven days; and  leavened bread shall not be seen with thee, neither shall there  be leaven seen with thee in all thy borders.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:8">13:8</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt inform thy son in that day, saying, It is  because of what Jehovah did to me when I came out of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:9">13:9</A>&nbsp;And it shall be for a sign to thee on thy hand, and for a  memorial between thine eyes, that the law of Jehovah may be in  thy mouth; for with a powerful hand hath Jehovah brought thee  out of Egypt.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_13:11">13:11</A>&nbsp;And it shall be when Jehovah hath brought thee into the  land of the Canaanites, as he hath sworn to thee and to thy  fathers, and hath given it thee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:12">13:12</A>&nbsp;that thou shalt offer unto Jehovah all that breaketh open  the womb, and every firstling that cometh of cattle which is  thine: the males [shall be] Jehovah's.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_13:15">13:15</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to  let us go, that Jehovah slew all the firstborn in the land of  Egypt, both the firstborn of men and the firstborn of cattle:  therefore I sacrifice to Jehovah all that breaketh open the  womb -- being males; and every firstborn of my children I  ransom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:16">13:16</A>&nbsp;And it shall be for a sign on thy hand, and for frontlets  between thine eyes, for with a powerful hand Jehovah brought us  forth out of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:17">13:17</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when Pharaoh let the people go, that  God did not lead them the way of the land of the Philistines,  although that was near; for God said, That the people may not  repent when they see conflict, and return to Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:18">13:18</A>&nbsp;And God led the people about, the way of the wilderness of  the Red Sea; and the children of Israel went arrayed out of the  land of Egypt.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:5">14:5</A>&nbsp;And it was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled;  and the heart of Pharaoh and of his bondmen was turned against  the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have  let Israel go from our service?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:6">14:6</A>&nbsp;And he yoked his chariot, and took his people with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:7">14:7</A>&nbsp;And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the  chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:10">14:10</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh approached; and the children of Israel lifted  up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them;  and the children of Israel were much afraid, and cried out to  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:11">14:11</A>&nbsp;And they said to Moses, Is it because there were no graves  in Egypt, thou hast taken us away to die in the wilderness? why  hast thou done this to us, that thou hast led us out of Egypt?</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:24">14:24</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the morning watch, that Jehovah  looked upon the camp of the Egyptians, in the pillar of fire  and of the cloud, and embarrassed the camp of the Egyptians.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:25">14:25</A>&nbsp;And he took off their chariot wheels, and caused them to  drive with difficulty; and the Egyptians said, Let us flee  before Israel, for Jehovah is fighting for them against the  Egyptians!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:26">14:26</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the  sea, that the waters may return upon the Egyptians, upon their  chariots and upon their horsemen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:27">14:27</A>&nbsp;And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea  returned to its strength toward the morning; and the Egyptians  fled against it; and Jehovah overturned the Egyptians into the  midst of the sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:28">14:28</A>&nbsp;And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the  horsemen of all the host of Pharaoh that had come into the sea  after them; there remained not even one of them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:29">14:29</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel walked on dry [ground] through  the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall to them on  their right hand and on their left.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:30">14:30</A>&nbsp;Thus Jehovah saved Israel that day out of the hand of the  Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the sea-shore.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:31">14:31</A>&nbsp;And Israel saw the great power [with] which Jehovah had  wrought against the Egyptians; and the people feared Jehovah,  and believed in Jehovah, and in Moses his bondman.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:1">15:1</A>&nbsp;Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to  Jehovah, and spoke, saying, I will sing unto Jehovah, for he is  highly exalted: The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the  sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:2">15:2</A>&nbsp;My strength and song is Jah, and he is become my salvation:  This is my &#249;God, and I will glorify him; My father's God, and I  will extol him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:3">15:3</A>&nbsp;Jehovah is a man of war; Jehovah, his name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:4">15:4</A>&nbsp;Pharaoh's chariots and his army hath he cast into the sea;  His chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:5">15:5</A>&nbsp;The depths covered them; they sank to the bottom as a  stone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:6">15:6</A>&nbsp;Thy right hand, Jehovah, is become glorious in power: Thy  right hand, Jehovah, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:7">15:7</A>&nbsp;And by the greatness of thine excellency thou hast  overthrown thine adversaries: Thou sentest forth thy burning  wrath, it consumed them as stubble.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:8">15:8</A>&nbsp;And by the breath of thy nostrils the waters were heaped  up; The streams stood as a mound; The depths were congealed in  the heart of the sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:9">15:9</A>&nbsp;The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will  divide the spoil; my soul shall be sated upon them; I will  unsheath my sword, my hand shall dispossess them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:10">15:10</A>&nbsp;Thou didst blow with thy breath, the sea covered them;  They sank as lead in the mighty waters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:11">15:11</A>&nbsp;Who is like unto thee, Jehovah, among the gods? Who is  like unto thee, glorifying thyself in holiness, Fearful [in]  praises, doing wonders?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:12">15:12</A>&nbsp;Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed  them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:13">15:13</A>&nbsp;Thou by thy mercy hast led forth the people that thou hast  redeemed; Thou hast guided them by thy strength unto the abode  of thy holiness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:14">15:14</A>&nbsp;The peoples heard it, they were afraid: A thrill seized  the inhabitants of Philistia.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:15">15:15</A>&nbsp;Then the princes of Edom were amazed; The mighty men of  Moab, trembling hath seized them; All the inhabitants of Canaan  melted away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:16">15:16</A>&nbsp;Fear and dread fall upon them; By the greatness of thine  arm they are still as a stone; Till thy people pass over,  Jehovah, Till the people pass over that thou hast purchased.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:17">15:17</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain  of thine inheritance, The place that thou, Jehovah, hast made  thy dwelling, The Sanctuary, Lord, that thy hands have  prepared.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:18">15:18</A>&nbsp;Jehovah shall reign for ever and ever!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:19">15:19</A>&nbsp;For the horse of Pharaoh, with his chariots and with his  horsemen, came into the sea, and Jehovah brought again the  waters of the sea upon them; and the children of Israel went on  dry [ground] through the midst of the sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:20">15:20</A>&nbsp;And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took the  tambour in her hand, and all the women went out after her with  tambours and with dances.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:21">15:21</A>&nbsp;And Miriam answered them, Sing to Jehovah, for he is  highly exalted: The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the  sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:22">15:22</A>&nbsp;And Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea, and they went  out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in  the wilderness, and found no water.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:23">15:23</A>&nbsp;And they came to Marah, and could not drink the waters of  Marah, for they were bitter; therefore the name of it was  called Marah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:24">15:24</A>&nbsp;And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall  we drink?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:25">15:25</A>&nbsp;And he cried to Jehovah; and Jehovah shewed him wood, and  he cast it into the waters, and the waters became sweet. There  he made for them a statute and an ordinance; and there he  tested them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:26">15:26</A>&nbsp;And he said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice  of Jehovah thy God, and do what is right in his eyes, and  incline thine ears to his commandments, and keep all his  statutes, I will put none of the complaints upon thee that I  have put upon the Egyptians; for I am Jehovah who healeth thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:27">15:27</A>&nbsp;And they came to Elim; and twelve springs of water were  there, and seventy palm trees; and they encamped there by the  waters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:1">16:1</A>&nbsp;And they journeyed from Elim, and the whole assembly of the  children of Israel came into the wilderness of Sin, which is  between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second  month after their departure out of the land of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:2">16:2</A>&nbsp;And the whole assembly of the children of Israel murmured  against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:3">16:3</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel said to them, Would that we had  died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt, when we sat  by the flesh-pots, when we ate bread to the full; for ye have  brought us out into this wilderness, to kill this whole  congregation with hunger!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:4">16:4</A>&nbsp;Then said Jehovah to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from  heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather the  daily need on its day, that I may prove them, whether they will  walk in my law, or not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:5">16:5</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall  prepare what they have brought in; and it shall be twice as  much as they shall gather daily.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:6">16:6</A>&nbsp;And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, In  the evening, then shall ye know that Jehovah has brought you  out from the land of Egypt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:7">16:7</A>&nbsp;and in the morning, then shall ye see the glory of Jehovah;  for he has heard your murmurings against Jehovah; -- and what  are we, that ye murmur against us?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:8">16:8</A>&nbsp;And Moses said, When Jehovah gives you in the evening flesh  to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for Jehovah hears  your murmurings which ye murmur against him ... and what [are]  we? your murmurings are not against us, but against Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:9">16:9</A>&nbsp;And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the assembly of the  children of Israel, Come near into the presence of Jehovah; for  he has heard your murmurings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:10">16:10</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when Aaron spoke to the whole  assembly of the children of Israel, that they turned toward the  wilderness, and behold, the glory of Jehovah appeared in the  cloud.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:11">16:11</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:12">16:12</A>&nbsp;I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel:  speak to them, saying, Between the two evenings ye shall eat  flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye  shall know that I am Jehovah your God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:13">16:13</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the evening, that quails came up,  and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay round the  camp.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:14">16:14</A>&nbsp;And when the dew that lay [round it] was gone up, behold,  on the face of the wilderness there was [something] fine,  granular, fine as hoar-frost, on the ground.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:15">16:15</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel saw [it], and said one to  another, What is it? for they did not know what it was. And  Moses said to them, This is the bread which Jehovah has given  you to eat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:16">16:16</A>&nbsp;This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded: Gather of  it every man according to what he can eat, an omer a poll,  [according to] the number of your persons: ye shall take every  man for those that are in his tent.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:17">16:17</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some  much, some little.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:18">16:18</A>&nbsp;And they measured with the omer: then he that gathered  much had nothing over, and he that gathered little wanted  nothing: they had gathered every man according to the measure  of his eating.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:19">16:19</A>&nbsp;And Moses said to them, Let no man leave [any] of it until  the morning.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:20">16:20</A>&nbsp;But they did not hearken to Moses; and some men left of it  until the morning; then worms bred in it and it stank. And  Moses was wroth with them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:21">16:21</A>&nbsp;And they gathered it every morning, every man as much as  he could eat; and when the sun became hot, it melted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:22">16:22</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the sixth day, that they gathered  twice as much bread, two omers for one; and all the princes of  the assembly came and told Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:23">16:23</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, This is what Jehovah has said:  To-morrow is the rest, the holy sabbath, of Jehovah: bake what  ye will bake, and cook what ye will cook; and lay up for  yourselves all that remains over, to be kept for the morning.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:24">16:24</A>&nbsp;And they laid it up for the morning, as Moses had  commanded; and it did not stink, neither was there any worm in  it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:25">16:25</A>&nbsp;And Moses said, Eat it to-day; for to-day is sabbath to  Jehovah: to-day ye shall not find it in the field.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:26">16:26</A>&nbsp;Six days shall ye gather it; but on the seventh day is  sabbath: on it there shall be none.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:27">16:27</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the seventh day that there went out  [some] from the people to gather [it], and they found none.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:28">16:28</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, How long do ye refuse to keep  my commandments and my laws?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:29">16:29</A>&nbsp;See, for Jehovah hath given you the sabbath; therefore he  giveth you on the sixth day the bread for two days. Abide every  man in his place: let no man go from his place on the seventh  day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:30">16:30</A>&nbsp;And the people rested on the seventh day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:31">16:31</A>&nbsp;And the house of Israel called its name Manna; and it was  like coriander-seed, white; and the taste of it was like cake  with honey.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:32">16:32</A>&nbsp;And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah has  commanded: Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations;  that they may see the bread that I gave you to eat in the  wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:33">16:33</A>&nbsp;And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put in it an omer  full of manna, and deposit it before Jehovah, to be kept for  your generations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:34">16:34</A>&nbsp;As Jehovah had commanded Moses, so Aaron deposited it  before the Testimony, to be kept.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:35">16:35</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years,  until they came into an inhabited land: they ate the manna  until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:36">16:36</A>&nbsp;Now an omer is the tenth [part] of an ephah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:1">17:1</A>&nbsp;And all the assembly of the children of Israel journeyed  from the wilderness of Sin, according to their journeys, at the  command of Jehovah; and they encamped in Rephidim; and there  was no water for the people to drink.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:2">17:2</A>&nbsp;And the people contended with Moses, and said, Give us  water, that we may drink! And Moses said to them, Why do ye  dispute with me? Why do ye tempt Jehovah?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:3">17:3</A>&nbsp;And the people thirsted there for water; and the people  murmured against Moses, and said, Why is it that thou hast  brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our  cattle with thirst?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:4">17:4</A>&nbsp;And Moses cried to Jehovah, saying, What shall I do with  this people? Yet a little, and they will stone me!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:5">17:5</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, Go on before the people, and  take with thee of the elders of Israel, and thy staff with  which thou didst smite the river, take in thy hand, and go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:6">17:6</A>&nbsp;Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock on  Horeb; and thou shalt strike the rock, and there shall come  water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so  before the eyes of the elders of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:7">17:7</A>&nbsp;And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah,  because of the contention of the children of Israel, and  because they had tempted Jehovah, saying, Is Jehovah among us,  or not?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:8">17:8</A>&nbsp;And Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:9">17:9</A>&nbsp;And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us men, and go out, fight  with Amalek; to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with  the staff of God in my hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:10">17:10</A>&nbsp;And Joshua did as Moses had said to him, to fight with  Amalek; and Moses, Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the  hill.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:11">17:11</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass when Moses raised his hand, that  Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek  prevailed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:12">17:12</A>&nbsp;And Moses' hands were heavy; then they took a stone, and  put [it] under him, and he sat on it; and Aaron and Hur  supported his hands, one on this side, and one on that side;  and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:13">17:13</A>&nbsp;And Joshua broke the power of Amalek and his people with  the edge of the sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:14">17:14</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, Write this [for] a memorial in  the book, and rehearse [it] in the ears of Joshua, that I will  utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the  heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:15">17:15</A>&nbsp;And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it  Jehovah-nissi.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:16">17:16</A>&nbsp;And he said, For the hand is on the throne of Jah; Jehovah  will have war with Amalek from generation to generation!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:1">18:1</A>&nbsp;And Jethro the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law,  heard of all that God had done to Moses, and to Israel his  people; that Jehovah had brought Israel out of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:2">18:2</A>&nbsp;And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses'  wife, after he had sent her back,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:3">18:3</A>&nbsp;and her two sons, of whom the name of the one was Gershom  -- for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:4">18:4</A>&nbsp;-- and the name of the other, Eliezer -- For the God of my  father has been my help, and has delivered me from the sword of  Pharaoh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:5">18:5</A>&nbsp;And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came to Moses with his  sons and his wife into the wilderness, where he encamped at the  mountain of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:6">18:6</A>&nbsp;And he sent word to Moses: I, thy father-in-law Jethro, am  come to thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:7">18:7</A>&nbsp;And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did  obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other [after]  their welfare, and went into the tent.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:8">18:8</A>&nbsp;And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done  to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake; all the  trouble that had befallen them on the way, and [how] Jehovah  had delivered them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:9">18:9</A>&nbsp;And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness that Jehovah had  done to Israel; that he had delivered them out of the hand of  the Egyptians.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:10">18:10</A>&nbsp;And Jethro said, Blessed be Jehovah, who has delivered you  out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of  Pharaoh; who has delivered the people from under the hand of  the Egyptians.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:11">18:11</A>&nbsp;Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all gods; for in  the thing in which they acted haughtily [he was] above them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:12">18:12</A>&nbsp;And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt-offering  and sacrifices for God; and Aaron came, and all the elders of  Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law in the presence  of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:13">18:13</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge  the people; and the people stood by Moses from the morning to  the evening.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:14">18:14</A>&nbsp;And Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did with the  people, and said, What is this thing which thou art doing with  the people? why dost thou sit alone, and all the people are  standing by thee from morning to evening?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:15">18:15</A>&nbsp;And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people  come to me to enquire of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:16">18:16</A>&nbsp;When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge  between one and another; and I make known [to them] the  statutes of God, and his laws.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:17">18:17</A>&nbsp;And Moses' father-in-law said to him, The thing that thou  art doing is not good.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:18">18:18</A>&nbsp;Thou wilt be quite exhausted, both thou and this people  that is with thee; for the thing is too heavy for thee: thou  canst not perform it alone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:19">18:19</A>&nbsp;Hearken now to my voice: I will give thee counsel, and God  shall be with thee. Be thou for the people with God, and bring  the matters before God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:20">18:20</A>&nbsp;and teach them the statutes and the laws, and make known  to them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they  must do.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:21">18:21</A>&nbsp;But do thou provide among all the people able men, such as  fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place [them]  over them, chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of  fifties, and chiefs of tens,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:22">18:22</A>&nbsp;that they may judge the people at all times; and it shall  be [that] they shall bring to thee every great matter, and that  they shall judge every small matter, and they shall lighten  [the task] on thee, and they shall bear [it] with thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:23">18:23</A>&nbsp;If thou do this thing, and God command thee [so], thou  wilt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to  their place in peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:24">18:24</A>&nbsp;And Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and  did all that he had said.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:25">18:25</A>&nbsp;And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them  heads over the people, chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds,  chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of tens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:26">18:26</A>&nbsp;And they judged the people at all times: the hard matters  they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:27">18:27</A>&nbsp;And Moses sent away his father-in-law, and he departed  into his land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:1">19:1</A>&nbsp;In the third month after the departure of the children of  Israel out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they [into]  the wilderness of Sinai:</p>

<p><A NAME="an_19:3">19:3</A>&nbsp;And Moses went up to God, and Jehovah called to him out of  the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of  Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:</p>

<p><A NAME="an_19:7">19:7</A>&nbsp;And Moses came and called the elders of the people, and  laid before the mall these words which Jehovah had commanded  him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:8">19:8</A>&nbsp;And all the people answered together, and said, All that  Jehovah has spoken will we do! And Moses brought the words of  the people back to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:9">19:9</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, Lo, I will come to thee in the  cloud's thick darkness, that the people may hear when I speak  with thee, and believe thee also for ever. And Moses told the  words of the people to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:10">19:10</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, Go to the people, and hallow  them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their clothes;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_19:12">19:12</A>&nbsp;And set bounds round about the people, saying, Take heed  to yourselves, [not] to go up unto the mountain nor touch the  border of it: whatever toucheth the mountain shall certainly be  put to death:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:13">19:13</A>&nbsp;not a hand shall touch it, but it shall certainly be  stoned, or shot through; whether it be a beast or a man, it  shall not live. When the long drawn note of the trumpet  soundeth, they shall come up to the mountain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:14">19:14</A>&nbsp;And Moses came down from the mountain to the people, and  hallowed the people; and they washed their clothes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:15">19:15</A>&nbsp;And he said to the people, Be ready for the third day; do  not come near [your] wives.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:16">19:16</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning,  that there were thunders and lightnings and a heavy cloud on  the mountain, and the sound of the trumpet exceeding loud; and  the whole people that was in the camp trembled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:17">19:17</A>&nbsp;And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with  God; and they stood at the foot of the mountain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:18">19:18</A>&nbsp;And the whole of mount Sinai smoked, because Jehovah  descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended as the smoke of  a furnace; and the whole mountain shook greatly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:19">19:19</A>&nbsp;And the sound of the trumpet increased and became  exceeding loud; Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:20">19:20</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah came down on mount Sinai, on the top of the  mountain; and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mountain,  and Moses went up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:21">19:21</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, Go down, testify to the people  that they break not through to Jehovah to gaze, and many of  them perish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:22">19:22</A>&nbsp;And the priests also, who come near to Jehovah, shall  hallow themselves, lest Jehovah break forth on them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:23">19:23</A>&nbsp;And Moses said to Jehovah, The people cannot come up to  mount Sinai; for thou hast testified to us, saying, Set bounds  about the mountain, and hallow it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:24">19:24</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to him, Go, descend, and thou shalt come  up, thou, and Aaron with thee; but the priests and the people  shall not break through to go up to Jehovah, lest he break  forth on them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:25">19:25</A>&nbsp;So Moses went down to the people, and told them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:1">20:1</A>&nbsp;And God spoke all these words, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:2">20:2</A>&nbsp;I am Jehovah thy God, who have brought thee out of the land  of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:3">20:3</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:4">20:4</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not make thyself any graven image, or any form  of what is in the heavens above, or what is in the earth  beneath, or what is in the waters under the earth:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:5">20:5</A>&nbsp;thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them;  for I, Jehovah thy God, am a jealous &#249;God, visiting the  iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and to the  fourth [generation] of them that hate me,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:6">20:6</A>&nbsp;and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and  keep my commandments.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:7">20:7</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not idly utter the name of Jehovah thy God; for  Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that idly uttereth his  name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:8">20:8</A>&nbsp;Remember the sabbath day to hallow it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:9">20:9</A>&nbsp;Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:10">20:10</A>&nbsp;but the seventh day is the sabbath of Jehovah thy God:  thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy  daughter, thy bondman, nor thy handmaid, nor thy cattle, nor  thy stranger that is within thy gates.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:11">20:11</A>&nbsp;For in six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth,  the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh  day; therefore Jehovah blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed  it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:12">20:12</A>&nbsp;Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be  prolonged in the land that Jehovah thy God giveth thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:13">20:13</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not kill.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:14">20:14</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not commit adultery.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:15">20:15</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not steal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:16">20:16</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:17">20:17</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not desire thy neighbour's house, thou shalt  not desire thy neighbour's wife, nor his bondman, nor his  handmaid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy  neighbour's.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:18">20:18</A>&nbsp;And all the people saw the thunderings, and the flames,  and the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking; and  when the people saw [it], they trembled, and stood afar off,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:19">20:19</A>&nbsp;and said to Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear;  but let not God speak with us, lest we die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:20">20:20</A>&nbsp;And Moses said to the people, Fear not; for God is come to  prove you, and that his fear may be before you, that ye sin  not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:21">20:21</A>&nbsp;And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near to the  obscurity where God was.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:22">20:22</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, Thus shalt thou say to the  children of Israel: Ye have seen that I have spoken with you  from the heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:23">20:23</A>&nbsp;Ye shall not make beside me gods of silver, and ye shall  not make to you gods of gold.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:24">20:24</A>&nbsp;An altar of earth shalt thou make unto me, and shalt  sacrifice on it thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings,  thy sheep and thine oxen: in all places where I shall make my  name to be remembered, I will come unto thee, and bless thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:25">20:25</A>&nbsp;And if thou make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not  build it of hewn stone; for if thou lift up thy sharp tool upon  it, thou hast profaned it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:26">20:26</A>&nbsp;Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that  thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:1">21:1</A>&nbsp;And these are the judgments which thou shalt set before  them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:2">21:2</A>&nbsp;If thou buy a Hebrew bondman, six years shall he serve; and  in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:3">21:3</A>&nbsp;If he came in alone, he shall go out alone: if he had a  wife, then his wife shall go out with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:4">21:4</A>&nbsp;If his master have given him a wife, and she have borne him  sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her  master's, and he shall go out alone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:5">21:5</A>&nbsp;But if the bondman shall say distinctly, I love my master,  my wife, and my children, I will not go free;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:6">21:6</A>&nbsp;then his master shall bring him before the judges, and  shall bring him to the door, or to the door-post; and his  master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall be  his bondman for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:7">21:7</A>&nbsp;And if a man shall sell his daughter as a handmaid, she  shall not go out as the bondmen go out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:8">21:8</A>&nbsp;If she is unacceptable in the eyes of her master, who had  taken her for himself, then shall he let her be ransomed: to  sell her unto a foreign people he hath no power, after having  dealt unfaithfully with her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:9">21:9</A>&nbsp;And if he have appointed her unto his son, he shall deal  with her after the law of daughters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:10">21:10</A>&nbsp;If he take himself another, her food, her clothing, and  her conjugal rights he shall not diminish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:11">21:11</A>&nbsp;And if he do not these three things unto her, then shall  she go out free without money.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:12">21:12</A>&nbsp;He that striketh a man, so that he die, shall certainly be  put to death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:13">21:13</A>&nbsp;But if he have not lain in wait, and God have delivered  [him] into his hand, I will appoint thee a place to which he  shall flee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:14">21:14</A>&nbsp;But if a man act wantonly toward his neighbour, and slay  him with guile, thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he  may die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:15">21:15</A>&nbsp;And he that striketh his father, or his mother, shall  certainly be put to death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:16">21:16</A>&nbsp;And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be  found in his hand, he shall certainly be put to death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:17">21:17</A>&nbsp;And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall  certainly be put to death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:18">21:18</A>&nbsp;And if men dispute, and one strike the other with a stone,  or with the fist, and he die not, but take to [his] bed,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:19">21:19</A>&nbsp;-- if he rise, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall  he that struck [him] be guiltless; only he shall pay [for] the  loss of his time, and shall cause [him] to be thoroughly  healed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:20">21:20</A>&nbsp;And if a man strike his bondman or his handmaid with a  staff, and he die under his hand, he shall certainly be  avenged.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:21">21:21</A>&nbsp;Only, if he continue [to live] a day or two days, he shall  not be avenged; for he is his money.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:22">21:22</A>&nbsp;And if men strive together, and strike a woman with child,  so that she be delivered, and no mischief happen, he shall in  any case be fined, according as the woman's husband shall  impose on him, and shall give it as the judges estimate.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:23">21:23</A>&nbsp;But if mischief happen, then thou shalt give life for  life,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:24">21:24</A>&nbsp;eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for  foot,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:25">21:25</A>&nbsp;branding for branding, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:26">21:26</A>&nbsp;And if a man strike the eye of his bondman or the eye of  his handmaid, and it be marred, he shall let him go for his  eye.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:27">21:27</A>&nbsp;And if he knock out his bondman's tooth or his handmaid's  tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:28">21:28</A>&nbsp;And if an ox gore a man or a woman, so that they die, then  the ox shall certainly be stoned, and its flesh shall not be  eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be guiltless.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:29">21:29</A>&nbsp;But if the ox have gored heretofore, and it have been  testified to its owner, and he have not kept it in, and it kill  a man or a woman, -- the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also  shall be put to death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:30">21:30</A>&nbsp;If there be imposed on him a satisfaction, then he shall  give the ransom of his life, according to what is imposed on  him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:31">21:31</A>&nbsp;Whether it gore a son or gore a daughter, according to  this judgment shall it be done to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:32">21:32</A>&nbsp;If the ox gore a bondman or a handmaid, he shall give to  their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be  stoned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:33">21:33</A>&nbsp;-- And if a man open a pit, or if a man dig a pit, and do  not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall into it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:34">21:34</A>&nbsp;the owner of the pit shall make it good, shall give money  to the owner of them; and the dead [ox] shall be his.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:35">21:35</A>&nbsp;-- And if one man's ox gore his neighbour's ox, and it  die, then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money  thereof, and divide the dead also.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:36">21:36</A>&nbsp;Or if it be known that the ox have gored heretofore, and  its owner have not kept him in, he shall in any case restore ox  for ox; and the dead shall be his.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:1">22:1</A>&nbsp;If a man steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it,  he shall restore five oxen for the ox, and four sheep for the  sheep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:2">22:2</A>&nbsp;If the thief be encountered breaking in, and be smitten so  that he die, there shall be no blood-guiltiness for him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:3">22:3</A>&nbsp;If the sun be risen on him, there shall be blood-guiltiness  for him; he should have made full restitution: if he had  nothing, he would have been sold for his theft.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:4">22:4</A>&nbsp;If the stolen thing be actually found alive in his hand,  whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep, he shall restore double.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:5">22:5</A>&nbsp;If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and  put in his cattle, and pasture in another man's field, of the  best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard  shall he make [it] good.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:6">22:6</A>&nbsp;-- If fire break out, and seize the thorns, and the stacks  of corn, or the standing corn, or the field be consumed, he  that kindled the fire shall fully make it good.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:7">22:7</A>&nbsp;-- If a man deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to  keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be  found, let him restore double;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:8">22:8</A>&nbsp;if the thief be not found, the master of the house shall be  brought before the judges, [to see] if he has not put his hand  unto his neighbour's goods.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:9">22:9</A>&nbsp;As to all manner of fraud, -- as to ox, as to ass, as to  sheep, as to clothing, as to everything lost, of which [a man]  saith, It is this -- the cause of both parties shall come  before the judges: he whom the judges shall condemn shall  restore double to his neighbour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:10">22:10</A>&nbsp;If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a  sheep, or any cattle, to keep, and it die, or be hurt, or  driven away, and no man see [it],</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:11">22:11</A>&nbsp;an oath of Jehovah shall be between them both, that he  hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner  of it shall accept it, and he shall not make [it] good.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_22:13">22:13</A>&nbsp;If it have been torn in pieces, let him bring it [as]  witness: he shall not make good what was torn.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:14">22:14</A>&nbsp;-- And if a man borrow anything of his neighbour, and it  be hurt, or die, its owner not being with it, he shall fully  make it good;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:15">22:15</A>&nbsp;if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make [it]  good; if it be a hired [thing], it came for its hire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:16">22:16</A>&nbsp;And if a man seduce a virgin that is not betrothed, and  lie with her, he shall certainly endow her, to be his wife.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:17">22:17</A>&nbsp;If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he  shall weigh money according to the dowry of virgins.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:18">22:18</A>&nbsp;-- Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_22:20">22:20</A>&nbsp;-- He that sacrificeth to [any] god, save to Jehovah only,  shall be devoted to destruction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:21">22:21</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him; for ye  have been strangers in the land of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:22">22:22</A>&nbsp;Ye shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:23">22:23</A>&nbsp;If thou afflict him in any way, if he cry at all unto me,  I will certainly hear his cry;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:24">22:24</A>&nbsp;and my anger shall burn, and I will slay you with the  sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children  fatherless.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:25">22:25</A>&nbsp;-- If thou lend money to my people, the poor with thee,  thou shalt not be to him as a usurer: ye shall charge him no  interest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:26">22:26</A>&nbsp;-- If thou at all take thy neighbour's garment in pledge,  thou shalt return it to him before the sun goes down;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:27">22:27</A>&nbsp;for that is his only covering, his garment for his skin:  on what shall he lie down? And it shall come to pass, when he  crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:28">22:28</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not revile the judges, nor curse a prince  amongst thy people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:29">22:29</A>&nbsp;-- Thou shalt not delay the fulness of thy  [threshing-floor] and the outflow of thy [winepress]. The  firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:30">22:30</A>&nbsp;Likewise shalt thou do with thy calf, with thy sheep:  seven days shall it be with its dam; on the eighth day thou  shalt give it me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:31">22:31</A>&nbsp;-- And ye shall be holy men unto me; and ye shall not eat  flesh torn in the field: ye shall cast it to the dog.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:1">23:1</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not accept a false report; extend not thy hand  to the wicked, to be an unrighteous witness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:2">23:2</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not follow the multitude for evil; neither shalt  thou answer in a cause, to go after the multitude to pervert  [judgment].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:3">23:3</A>&nbsp;Neither shalt thou favour a poor man in his cause.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:4">23:4</A>&nbsp;-- If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray,  thou shalt certainly bring it back to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:5">23:5</A>&nbsp;If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under its  burden, beware of leaving [it] to him: thou shalt certainly  loosen [it] with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:6">23:6</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of thy poor in his  cause.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:7">23:7</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt keep far from the cause of falsehood; and the  innocent and righteous slay not; for I will not justify the  wicked.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:8">23:8</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt take no bribe; for the bribe blindeth those  whose eyes are open, and perverteth the words of the righteous.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:9">23:9</A>&nbsp;And the stranger thou shalt not oppress; for ye know the  spirit of the stranger, for ye have been strangers in the land  of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:10">23:10</A>&nbsp;And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and gather in its  produce;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:11">23:11</A>&nbsp;but in the seventh thou shalt let it rest and lie  [fallow], that the poor of thy people may eat [of it]; and what  they leave, the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner  thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thine olive-tree.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:12">23:12</A>&nbsp;-- Six days thou shalt do thy work, but on the seventh day  thou shalt rest; that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the  son of thy handmaid, and the stranger may be refreshed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:13">23:13</A>&nbsp;And ye shall be on your guard as to everything that I have  said unto you; and shall make no mention of the name of other  gods -- it shall not be heard in thy mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:14">23:14</A>&nbsp;Thrice in the year thou shalt celebrate a feast to me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:15">23:15</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread, (thou shalt  eat unleavened bread seven days, as I have commanded thee, in  the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out  from Egypt; and none shall appear in my presence empty;)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:16">23:16</A>&nbsp;and the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of thy labours  which thou hast sown in the field, and the feast of  in-gathering, at the end of the year, when thou gatherest in  thy labours out of the field.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:17">23:17</A>&nbsp;Three times in the year all thy males shall appear in the  presence of the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:18">23:18</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with  leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my feast remain all  night until the morning.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:19">23:19</A>&nbsp;The first of the first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring  into the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in  its mother's milk.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:20">23:20</A>&nbsp;Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the  way, and to bring thee to the place that I have prepared.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:21">23:21</A>&nbsp;Be careful in his presence, and hearken unto his voice: do  not provoke him, for he will not forgive your transgressions;  for my name is in him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:22">23:22</A>&nbsp;But if thou shalt diligently hearken unto his voice, and  do all that I shall say, then I will be an enemy to thine  enemies, and an adversary to thine adversaries.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:23">23:23</A>&nbsp;For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in  unto the Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the  Canaanites, the Hivites and the Jebusites; and I will cut them  off.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_23:25">23:25</A>&nbsp;And ye shall serve Jehovah your God; and he shall bless  thy bread and thy water; and I will take sickness away from thy  midst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:26">23:26</A>&nbsp;There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in  thy land; the number of thy days will I fulfil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:27">23:27</A>&nbsp;I will send my fear before thee, and confound every people  to which thou comest, and will make all thine enemies turn  their back to thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:28">23:28</A>&nbsp;And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out  the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:29">23:29</A>&nbsp;I will not drive them out from before thee in one year:  lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field  multiply against thee.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_32:1">32:1</A>&nbsp;And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down  from the mountain, the people collected together to Aaron, and  said to him, Up, make us a god, who will go before us; for this  Moses, the man that has brought us up out of the land of Egypt,  -- we do not know what is become of him!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:2">32:2</A>&nbsp;And Aaron said to them, Break off the golden rings that are  in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters,  and bring [them] to me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:3">32:3</A>&nbsp;Then all the people broke off the golden rings that were in  their ears, and brought [them] to Aaron.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:4">32:4</A>&nbsp;And he took [them] out of their hand, and fashioned it with  a chisel and made of it a molten calf: and they said, This is  thy god, Israel, who has brought thee up out of the land of  Egypt!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:5">32:5</A>&nbsp;And Aaron saw [it], and built an altar before it; and Aaron  made a proclamation, and said, To-morrow is a feast to Jehovah!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:6">32:6</A>&nbsp;And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered up  burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings; and the people  sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to sport.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:7">32:7</A>&nbsp;Then Jehovah said to Moses, Away, go down! for thy people,  which thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, is acting  corruptly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:8">32:8</A>&nbsp;They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I  commanded them: they have made themselves a molten calf, and  have bowed down to it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said,  This is thy god, Israel, who has brought thee up out of the  land of Egypt!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:9">32:9</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, I see this people, and behold,  it is a stiff-necked people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:10">32:10</A>&nbsp;And now let me alone, that my anger may burn against them,  and I may consume them; and I will make of thee a great nation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:11">32:11</A>&nbsp;And Moses besought Jehovah his God, and said, Why,  Jehovah, doth thy wrath burn against thy people, which thou  hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power  and with a strong hand?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:12">32:12</A>&nbsp;Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, For misfortune he  has brought them out, to slay them on the mountains, and to  annihilate them from the face of the earth? Turn from the heat  of thine anger, and repent of this evil against thy people!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:13">32:13</A>&nbsp;Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel, thy servants, to whom  thou sworest by thyself, and saidst to them, I will multiply  your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have  spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall possess [it]  for ever!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:14">32:14</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah repented of the evil that he had said he would  do to his people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:15">32:15</A>&nbsp;And Moses turned and went down from the mountain, [with]  the two tables of the testimony in his hand -- tables written  on both their sides: on this side and on that were they  written.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:16">32:16</A>&nbsp;And the tables [were] God's work, and the writing was  God's writing, engraven on the tables.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:17">32:17</A>&nbsp;And Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,  and said to Moses, There is a shout of war in the camp.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:18">32:18</A>&nbsp;And he said, It is not the sound of a shout of victory,  neither is it the sound of a shout of defeat: it is the noise  of alternate singing I hear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:19">32:19</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when he came near the camp, and saw  the calf and the dancing, that Moses' anger burned, and he cast  the tables out of his hands, and shattered them beneath the  mountain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:20">32:20</A>&nbsp;And he took the calf that they had made, and burned [it]  with fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed [it] on the  water, and made the children of Israel drink [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:21">32:21</A>&nbsp;And Moses said to Aaron, What has this people done to  thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin on them?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:22">32:22</A>&nbsp;And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord burn! thou  knowest the people, that they are [set] on mischief.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:23">32:23</A>&nbsp;And they said to me, Make us a god, who will go before us;  for this Moses, the man that has brought us up out of the land  of Egypt, we do not know what is become of him!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:24">32:24</A>&nbsp;And I said to them, Who has gold? They broke [it] off, and  gave [it] me, and I cast it into the fire, and there came out  this calf.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:25">32:25</A>&nbsp;And Moses saw the people how they were stripped; for Aaron  had stripped them to [their] shame before their adversaries.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:26">32:26</A>&nbsp;And Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, He that  is for Jehovah, [let him come] to me. And all the sons of Levi  gathered to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:27">32:27</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of  Israel: Put every man his sword upon his hip; go and return  from gate to gate through the camp, and slay every man his  brother, and every man his friend, and every man his neighbour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:28">32:28</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses;  and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:29">32:29</A>&nbsp;And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves to-day to Jehovah,  yea, every man with his son, and with his brother, and bring on  yourselves a blessing to-day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:30">32:30</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass the next day, that Moses said to the  people, Ye have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to  Jehovah: perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:31">32:31</A>&nbsp;And Moses returned to Jehovah, and said, Alas, this people  has sinned a great sin, and they have made themselves a god of  gold!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:32">32:32</A>&nbsp;And now, if thou wilt forgive their sin ... but if not,  blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book that thou hast written.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:33">32:33</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, Whoever hath sinned against me,  him will I blot out of my book.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:34">32:34</A>&nbsp;And now go, lead the people whither I have told thee:  behold, my Angel shall go before thee; but in the day of my  visiting I will visit their sin upon them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:35">32:35</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah smote the people, because they made the calf,  which Aaron had made.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:1">33:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, Depart, go up hence, thou and  the people that thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt,  into the land that I swore unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to  Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:2">33:2</A>&nbsp;(and I will send an angel before thee, and dispossess the  Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the  Hivite, and the Jebusite,)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:3">33:3</A>&nbsp;into a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go  up in the midst of thee, for thou art a stiff-necked people, --  lest I consume thee on the way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:4">33:4</A>&nbsp;And when the people heard this evil word, they mourned; and  no man put on his ornaments.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:5">33:5</A>&nbsp;Now Jehovah had said to Moses, Say unto the children of  Israel, Ye are a stiff-necked people: in one moment I will come  up into the midst of thee and will consume thee. And now put  off thine ornaments from thee, and I will know what I will do  unto thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:6">33:6</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their  ornaments at mount Horeb.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:7">33:7</A>&nbsp;And Moses took the tent, and pitched it outside the camp,  far from the camp, and called it the Tent of meeting. And it  came to pass [that] every one who sought Jehovah went out to  the tent of meeting which was outside the camp.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:8">33:8</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when Moses went out to the tent, all  the people rose up, and stood every man at the entrance of his  tent, and they looked after Moses until he entered into the  tent.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:9">33:9</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass when Moses entered into the tent, the  pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the entrance of the  tent, and [Jehovah] talked with Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:10">33:10</A>&nbsp;And all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the  entrance of the tent; and all the people rose and worshipped,  every man at the entrance of his tent.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:11">33:11</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spoke with Moses face to face, as a man speaks  with his friend. And he returned to the camp; but his  attendant, Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, departed not  from within the tent.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:12">33:12</A>&nbsp;And Moses said to Jehovah, Behold, thou sayest unto me,  Bring up this people; but thou dost not let me know whom thou  wilt send with me; and thou hast said, I know thee by name, and  thou hast also found grace in mine eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:13">33:13</A>&nbsp;And now, if indeed I have found grace in thine eyes, make  me now to know thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find  grace in thine eyes; and consider that this nation is thy  people!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:14">33:14</A>&nbsp;And he said, My presence shall go, and I will give thee  rest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:15">33:15</A>&nbsp;And he said to him, If thy presence do not go, bring us  not up hence.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:16">33:16</A>&nbsp;And how shall it be known then that I have found grace in  thine eyes -- I and thy people? [Is it] not by thy going with  us? so shall we be distinguished, I and thy people, from every  people that is on the face of the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:17">33:17</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, I will do this thing also that  thou hast said; for thou hast found grace in mine eyes, and I  know thee by name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:18">33:18</A>&nbsp;And he said, Let me, I pray thee, see thy glory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:19">33:19</A>&nbsp;And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thy  face, and I will proclaim the name of Jehovah before thee; and  I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will shew  mercy on whom I will shew mercy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:20">33:20</A>&nbsp;And he said, Thou canst not see my face; for Man shall not  see me, and live.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:21">33:21</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said, Behold, [there is] a place by me: there  shalt thou stand on the rock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:22">33:22</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, when my glory passeth by, that  I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee  with my hand, until I have passed by.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:23">33:23</A>&nbsp;And I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see me from  behind; but my face shall not be seen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:1">34:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, Hew for thyself two tables of  stone like the first; and I will write upon the tables the  words that were upon the first tables, which thou hast broken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:2">34:2</A>&nbsp;And be ready for the morning, and go up in the morning to  mount Sinai, and stand there before me on the top of the  mountain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:3">34:3</A>&nbsp;And let no man go up with thee, neither shall any man be  seen on all the mountain; neither shall sheep and oxen feed in  front of that mountain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:4">34:4</A>&nbsp;And he hewed two tables of stone like the first; and Moses  rose up early in the morning and went up to mount Sinai, as  Jehovah had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables  of stone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:5">34:5</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and stood beside him  there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:6">34:6</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah passed by before his face, and proclaimed,  Jehovah, Jehovah &#249;God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and  abundant in goodness and truth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:7">34:7</A>&nbsp;keeping mercy unto thousands, forgiving iniquity and  transgression and sin, but by no means clearing [the guilty];  visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and  upon the children's children, upon the third and upon the  fourth [generation].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:8">34:8</A>&nbsp;And Moses made haste, and bowed his head to the earth and  worshipped,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:9">34:9</A>&nbsp;and said, If indeed I have found grace in thine eyes, Lord,  let the Lord, I pray thee, go in our midst; for it is a  stiff-necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and  take us for an inheritance!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:10">34:10</A>&nbsp;And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy  people I will do marvels that have not been done in all the  earth, nor in any nation; and all the people in the midst of  which thou [art] shall see the work of Jehovah; for a terrible  thing it shall be that I will do with thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:11">34:11</A>&nbsp;Observe what I command thee this day: behold, I will drive  out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the  Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:12">34:12</A>&nbsp;Take heed to thyself, that thou make no covenant with the  inhabitants of the land to which thou shalt come, lest it be a  snare in the midst of thee;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:13">34:13</A>&nbsp;but ye shall demolish their altars, shatter their statues,  and hew down their Asherahs.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:14">34:14</A>&nbsp;For thou shalt worship no other &#249;God; for Jehovah --  Jealous is his name -- is a jealous &#249;God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:15">34:15</A>&nbsp;lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the  land, and then, when they go a whoring after their gods, and  sacrifice unto their gods, thou be invited, and eat of their  sacrifice,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:16">34:16</A>&nbsp;and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their  daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a  whoring after their gods.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:17">34:17</A>&nbsp;-- Thou shalt make thyself no molten gods.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:18">34:18</A>&nbsp;-- The feast of the unleavened bread shalt thou keep:  seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, as I have commanded  thee, at the appointed time of the month Abib; for in the month  Abib thou camest out from Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:19">34:19</A>&nbsp;-- All that openeth the womb [is] mine; and all the cattle  that is born a male, the firstling of ox and sheep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:20">34:20</A>&nbsp;But the firstling of an ass thou shalt ransom with a lamb;  and if thou ransom [it] not, then shalt thou break its neck.  All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt ransom; and none  shall appear before me empty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:21">34:21</A>&nbsp;-- Six days shalt thou work, but on the seventh day thou  shalt rest; in ploughing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:22">34:22</A>&nbsp;-- And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the  first-fruits of wheat-harvest, and the feast of ingathering at  the turn of the year.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:23">34:23</A>&nbsp;Thrice in the year shall all thy males appear before the  Lord Jehovah, the God of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:24">34:24</A>&nbsp;For I will dispossess the nations before thee, and enlarge  thy border, and no man shall desire thy land, when thou goest  up to appear before the face of Jehovah thy God thrice in the  year.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:25">34:25</A>&nbsp;-- Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with  leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the  passover be left over night until the morning.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:26">34:26</A>&nbsp;-- The first of the first-fruits of thy land shalt thou  bring into the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a  kid in its mother's milk.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:27">34:27</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Moses, Write thee these words; for  after the tenor of these words have I made a covenant with thee  and with Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:28">34:28</A>&nbsp;-- And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty  nights; he ate no bread, and drank no water. -- And he wrote on  the tables the words of the covenant, the ten words.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:29">34:29</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai  -- and the two tables of testimony were in Moses' hand, when he  came down from the mountain -- that Moses knew not that the  skin of his face shone through his talking with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:30">34:30</A>&nbsp;And Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, and  behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to  come near him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:31">34:31</A>&nbsp;And Moses called to them; and they turned to him, -- Aaron  and all the principal men of the assembly; and Moses talked  with them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:32">34:32</A>&nbsp;And afterwards, all the children of Israel came near; and  he gave them in commandment all that Jehovah had spoken with  him on mount Sinai.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:33">34:33</A>&nbsp;And Moses ended speaking with them; and he had put on his  face a veil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:34">34:34</A>&nbsp;And when Moses went in before Jehovah to speak with him,  he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and  spoke to the children of Israel what he was commanded.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:35">34:35</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the  skin of Moses' face shone; and Moses put the veil on his face  again, until he went in to speak with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:1">35:1</A>&nbsp;And Moses collected all the assembly of the children of  Israel, and said to them, These are the things which Jehovah  has commanded, to do them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:2">35:2</A>&nbsp;Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there  shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of rest to Jehovah:  whoever does work on it shall be put to death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:3">35:3</A>&nbsp;Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your dwellings upon the  sabbath day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:4">35:4</A>&nbsp;And Moses spoke to all the assembly of the children of  Israel, saying, This is the word which Jehovah has commanded,  saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:5">35:5</A>&nbsp;Take from among you a heave-offering to Jehovah: every one  whose heart [is] willing, let him bring it, Jehovah's  heave-offering -- gold, and silver, and copper,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_35:21">35:21</A>&nbsp;And they came, every one whose heart moved him, and every  one whose spirit prompted him; they brought Jehovah's  heave-offering for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all  its service, and for the holy garments.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:22">35:22</A>&nbsp;And they came, both men and women; every one who was of  willing heart brought nose-rings, and earrings, and rings, and  bracelets, all kinds of utensils of gold: every man that waved  a wave-offering of gold to Jehovah.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_39:42">39:42</A>&nbsp;According to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses, so had  the children of Israel done all the labour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:43">39:43</A>&nbsp;And Moses saw all the work, and behold, they had done it  as Jehovah had commanded -- so had they done [it]; and Moses  blessed them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:1">40:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:2">40:2</A>&nbsp;On the day of the first month, on the first of the month,  shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:3">40:3</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt put in it the ark of the testimony, and  shalt cover the ark with the veil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:4">40:4</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the  things that are to be set in order upon it. And thou shalt  bring in the candlestick and light its lamps.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:5">40:5</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt set the golden altar for the incense before  the ark of the testimony; and hang up the curtain of the  entrance to the tabernacle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:6">40:6</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt set the altar of burnt-offering before the  entrance of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:7">40:7</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of meeting  and the altar, and shalt put water in it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:8">40:8</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt fix the court round about, and hang up the  curtain at the gate of the court.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:9">40:9</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the  tabernacle, and all that is in it, and shalt hallow it, and all  its utensils; and it shall be holy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:10">40:10</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt-offering, and all  its utensils; and thou shalt hallow the altar, and the altar  shall be most holy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:11">40:11</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt anoint the laver and its stand, and hallow  it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:12">40:12</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons near, at the  entrance of the tent of meeting, and bathe them with water.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:13">40:13</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt clothe Aaron with the holy garments, and  anoint him, and hallow him, that he may serve me as priest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:14">40:14</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt bring his sons near, and clothe them with  vests.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:15">40:15</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their  father, that they may serve me as priests. And their anointing  shall be to them an everlasting priesthood throughout their  generations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:16">40:16</A>&nbsp;And Moses did so: as Jehovah had commanded him, so did he.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:17">40:17</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the first month in the second year,  on the first of the month, that the tabernacle was set up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:18">40:18</A>&nbsp;And Moses set up the tabernacle, and put in its bases, and  fixed its boards, and put in its bars, and set up its pillars.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:19">40:19</A>&nbsp;And he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the  covering of the tent above over it; as Jehovah had commanded  Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:20">40:20</A>&nbsp;And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and put  the staves in the ark, and put the mercy-seat above on the ark.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:21">40:21</A>&nbsp;And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and hung up  the veil of separation, and covered the ark of the testimony;  as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:22">40:22</A>&nbsp;And he put the table in the tent of meeting, on the side  of the tabernacle northward, outside the veil,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:23">40:23</A>&nbsp;and arranged the bread in order upon it before Jehovah; as  Jehovah had commanded Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:24">40:24</A>&nbsp;And he put the candlestick in the tent of meeting,  opposite to the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:25">40:25</A>&nbsp;And he lighted the lamps before Jehovah; as Jehovah had  commanded Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:26">40:26</A>&nbsp;And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before  the veil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:27">40:27</A>&nbsp;And he burnt on it fragrant incense; as Jehovah had  commanded Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:28">40:28</A>&nbsp;And he hung up the curtain of the entrance to the  tabernacle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:29">40:29</A>&nbsp;And he put the altar of burnt-offering at the entrance to  the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered on it the  burnt-offering and the oblation; as Jehovah had commanded  Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:30">40:30</A>&nbsp;And he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the  altar, and put water in it for washing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:31">40:31</A>&nbsp;And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and  their feet out of it:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:32">40:32</A>&nbsp;when they went into the tent of meeting, and when they  drew near to the altar, they washed; as Jehovah had commanded  Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:33">40:33</A>&nbsp;And he set up the court round about the tabernacle and the  altar, and hung up the curtain of the gate of the court. And so  Moses finished the work.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:34">40:34</A>&nbsp;And the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory  of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:35">40:35</A>&nbsp;And Moses could not enter into the tent of meeting, for  the cloud abode on it, and the glory of Jehovah filled the  tabernacle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:36">40:36</A>&nbsp;And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle,  the children of Israel journeyed in all their journeys.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:37">40:37</A>&nbsp;And if the cloud were not taken up, then they did not  journey until the day that it was taken up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:38">40:38</A>&nbsp;For the cloud of Jehovah was on the tabernacle by day, and  fire was in it by night, before the eyes of all the house of  Israel, throughout all their journeys.</p>
