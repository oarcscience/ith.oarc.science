### Darby Bible: Hebrews

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> God having spoken in many parts and in many
ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> at the end of these days has spoken to us
in \[the person of the\] Son, whom he has established heir of all
things, by whom also he made the worlds;

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> who being \[the\] effulgence of his glory
and \[the\] expression of his substance, and upholding all things by the
word of his power, having made \[by himself\] the purification of sins,
set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high,

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> taking a place by so much better than the
angels, as he inherits a name more excellent than they.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> For to which of the angels said he ever,
\*Thou\* art my Son: this day have \*I\* begotten thee? and again, \*I\*
will be to him for father, and \*he\* shall be to me for son?

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> and again, when he brings in the firstborn
into the habitable world, he says, And let all God's angels worship him.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> And as to the angels he says, Who makes his
angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire;

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> but as to the Son, Thy throne, O God,
\[is\] to the age of the age, and a sceptre of uprightness \[is\] the
sceptre of thy kingdom.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Thou hast loved righteousness and hast
hated lawlessness; therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with oil of
gladness above thy companions.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> And, \*Thou\* in the beginning, Lord,
hast founded the earth, and works of thy hands are the heavens.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> They shall perish, but \*thou\*
continuest still; and they all shall grow old as a garment,

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> and as a covering shalt thou roll them
up, and they shall be changed; but \*thou\* art the Same, and thy years
shall not fail.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> But as to which of the angels said he
ever, Sit at my right hand until I put thine enemies \[as\] footstool of
thy feet?

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> Are they not all ministering spirits,
sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation?

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> For this reason we should give heed more
abundantly to the things \[we have\] heard, lest in any way we should
slip away.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> For if the word which was spoken by angels
was firm, and every transgression and disobedience received just
retribution,

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> how shall \*we\* escape if we have been
negligent of so great salvation, which, having had its commencement in
being spoken \[of\] by the Lord, has been confirmed to us by those who
have heard;

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> God bearing, besides, witness with \[them\]
to \[it\], both by signs and wonders, and various acts of power, and
distributions of \[the\] Holy Spirit, according to his will?

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> For he has not subjected to angels the
habitable world which is to come, of which we speak;

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> but one has testified somewhere, saying,
What is man, that thou rememberest him, or son of man that thou visitest
him?

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> Thou hast made him some little inferior to
the angels; thou hast crowned him with glory and honour, \[and hast set
him over the works of thy hands;\]

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> thou hast subjected all things under his
feet. For in subjecting all things to him, he has left nothing unsubject
to him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to \*him\*,

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> but we see Jesus, who \[was\] made some
little inferior to angels on account of the suffering of death, crowned
with glory and honour; so that by the grace of God he should taste death
for every thing.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> For it became him, for whom \[are\] all
things, and by whom \[are\] all things, in bringing many sons to glory,
to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> For both he that sanctifies and those
sanctified \[are\] all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call
them brethren,

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> saying, I will declare thy name to my
brethren; in \[the\] midst of \[the\] assembly will I sing thy praises.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And again, I will trust in him. And
again, Behold, I and the children which God has given me.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> Since therefore the children partake of
blood and flesh, he also, in like manner, took part in the same, that
through death he might annul him who has the might of death, that is,
the devil;

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> and might set free all those who through
fear of death through the whole of their life were subject to bondage.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> For he does not indeed take hold of
angels \[by the hand\], but he takes hold of the seed of Abraham.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> Wherefore it behoved him in all things to
be made like to \[his\] brethren, that he might be a merciful and
faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make propitiation for
the sins of the people;

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> for, in that himself has suffered, being
tempted, he is able to help those that are being tempted.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of
\[the\] heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our
confession, Jesus,

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> who is faithful to him that has constituted
him, as Moses also in all his house.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> For \*he\* has been counted worthy of
greater glory than Moses, by how much he that has built it has more
honour than the house.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> For every house is built by some one; but
he who has built all things \[is\] God.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> And Moses indeed \[was\] faithful in all
his house, as a ministering servant, for a testimony of the things to be
spoken after;

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> but Christ, as Son over his house, whose
house are \*we\*, if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of
hope firm to the end.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Wherefore, even as says the Holy Spirit,
To-day if ye will hear his voice,

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> harden not your hearts, as in the
provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness;

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> where your fathers tempted \[me\], by
proving \[me\], and saw my works forty years.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> Wherefore I was wroth with this
generation, and said, They always err in heart; and \*they\* have not
known my ways;

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> so I swore in my wrath, If they shall
enter into my rest.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> See, brethren, lest there be in any one
of you a wicked heart of unbelief, in turning away from \[the\] living
God.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> But encourage yourselves each day, as
long as it is called To-day, that none of you be hardened by the
deceitfulness of sin.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> For we are become companions of the
Christ if indeed we hold the beginning of the assurance firm to the end;

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> in that it is said, To-day if ye will
hear his voice, do not harden your hearts, as in the provocation;

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> (for who was it, who, having heard,
provoked? but \[was it\] not all who came out of Egypt by Moses?

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> And with whom was he wroth forty years?
\[Was it\] not with those who had sinned, whose carcases fell in the
wilderness?

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> And to whom sware he that they should not
enter into his rest, but to those who had not hearkened to the word?

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> And we see that they could not enter in
on account of unbelief;)

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise
being left of entering into his rest, any one of you might seem to have
failed \[of it\].

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> For indeed we have had glad tidings
presented to us, even as they also; but the word of the report did not
profit \*them\*, not being mixed with faith in those who heard.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> For we enter into the rest who have
believed; as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, If they shall enter
into my rest; although the works had been completed from \[the\]
foundation of \[the\] world.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> For he has said somewhere of the seventh
\[day\] thus, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works:

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> and in this again, If they shall enter into
my rest.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> Seeing therefore it remains that some enter
into it, and those who first received the glad tidings did not enter in
on account of not hearkening to the word,

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> again he determines a certain day, saying,
in David, 'To-day,' after so long a time; (according as it has been said
before), To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> For if Jesus had brought them into rest, he
would not have spoken afterwards about another day.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> There remains then a sabbatism to the
people of God.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> For he that has entered into his rest, he
also has rested from his works, as God did from his own.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> Let us therefore use diligence to enter
into that rest, that no one may fall after the same example of not
hearkening to the word.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> For the word of God \[is\] living and
operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to
\[the\] division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a
discerner of the thoughts and intents of \[the\] heart.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> And there is not a creature unapparent
before him; but all things \[are\] naked and laid bare to his eyes, with
whom we have to do.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> Having therefore a great high priest who
has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast
the confession.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> For we have not a high priest not able to
sympathise with our infirmities, but tempted in all things in like
manner, sin apart.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> Let us approach therefore with boldness
to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for
seasonable help.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> For every high priest taken from amongst
men is established for men in things relating to God, that he may offer
both gifts and sacrifices for sins;

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> being able to exercise forbearance towards
the ignorant and erring, since he himself also is clothed with
infirmity;

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> and, on account of this \[infirmity\], he
ought, even as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> And no one takes the honour to himself but
\[as\] called by God, even as Aaron also.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> Thus the Christ also has not glorified
himself to be made a high priest; but he who had said to him, \*Thou\*
art my Son, \*I\* have to-day begotten thee.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Even as also in another \[place\] he says,
\*Thou\* \[art\] a priest for ever according to the order of
Melchisedec.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> Who in the days of his flesh, having
offered up both supplications and entreaties to him who was able to save
him out of death, with strong crying and tears; (and having been heard
because of his piety;)

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> though he were Son, he learned obedience
from the things which he suffered;

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> and having been perfected, became to all
them that obey him, author of eternal salvation;

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> addressed by God \[as\] high priest
according to the order of Melchisedec.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> Concerning whom we have much to say, and
hard to be interpreted in speaking \[of it\], since ye are become dull
in hearing.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> For when for the time ye ought to be
teachers, ye have again need that \[one\] should teach you what \[are\]
the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God, and are become such
as have need of milk, \[and\] not of solid food.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> For every one that partakes of milk
\[is\] unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe;

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> but solid food belongs to full-grown men,
who, on account of habit, have their senses exercised for distinguishing
both good and evil.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Wherefore, leaving the word of the
beginning of the Christ, let us go on \[to what belongs\] to full
growth, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and
faith in God,

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> of \[the\] doctrine of washings, and of
imposition of hands, and of resurrection of \[the\] dead, and of eternal
judgment;

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> and this will we do if God permit.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> For it is impossible to renew again to
repentance those once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly
gift, and have been made partakers of \[the\] Holy Spirit,

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> and have tasted the good word of God, and
\[the\] works of power of \[the\] age to come,

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> and have fallen away, crucifying for
themselves \[as they do\] the Son of God, and making a show of \[him\].

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> For ground which drinks the rain which
comes often upon it, and produces useful herbs for those for whose sakes
also it is tilled, partakes of blessing from God;

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> but bringing forth thorns and briars, it is
found worthless and nigh to a curse, whose end \[is\] to be burned.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> But we are persuaded concerning you,
beloved, better things, and connected with salvation, even if we speak
thus.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> For God \[is\] not unrighteous to forget
your work, and the love which ye have shewn to his name, having
ministered to the saints, and \[still\] ministering.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> But we desire earnestly that each one of
you shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end;

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of
those who through faith and patience have been inheritors of the
promises.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> For God, having promised to Abraham,
since he had no greater to swear by, swore by himself,

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> saying, Surely blessing I will bless
thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee;

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> and thus, having had long patience, he
got the promise.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> For men indeed swear by a greater, and
with them the oath is a term to all dispute, as making matters sure.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> Wherein God, willing to shew more
abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his
purpose, intervened by an oath,

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> that by two unchangeable things, in which
\[it was\] impossible that God should lie, we might have a strong
encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set
before us,

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> which we have as anchor of the soul, both
secure and firm, and entering into that within the veil,

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> where Jesus is entered as forerunner for
us, become for ever a high priest according to the order of Melchisedec.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> For this Melchisedec, King of Salem, priest
of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from smiting the kings,
and blessed him;

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> to whom Abraham gave also the tenth portion
of all; first being interpreted King of righteousness, and then also
King of Salem, which is King of peace;

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> without father, without mother, without
genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but
assimilated to the Son of God, abides a priest continually.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> Now consider how great this \[personage\]
was, to whom \[even\] the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth out of the
spoils.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> And they indeed from among the sons of
Levi, who receive the priesthood, have commandment to take tithes from
the people according to the law, that is from their brethren, though
these are come out of the loins of Abraham:

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> but he who has no genealogy from them has
tithed Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> But beyond all gainsaying, the inferior is
blessed by the better.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> And here dying men receive tithes; but
there \[one\] of whom the witness is that he lives;

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> and, so to speak, through Abraham, Levi
also, who received tithes, has been made to pay tithes.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> For he was yet in the loins of his father
when Melchisedec met him.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> If indeed then perfection were by the
Levitical priesthood, for the people had their law given to them in
connexion with \*it\*, what need \[was there\] still that a different
priest should arise according to the order of Melchisedec, and not be
named after the order of Aaron?

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> For, the priesthood being changed, there
takes place of necessity a change of law also.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> For he, of whom these things are said,
belongs to a different tribe, of which no one has \[ever\] been attached
to the service of the altar.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> For it is clear that our Lord has sprung
out of Juda, as to which tribe Moses spake nothing as to priests.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> And it is yet more abundantly evident,
since a different priest arises according to the similitude of
Melchisedec,

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> who has been constituted not according to
law of fleshly commandment, but according to power of indissoluble life.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> For it is borne witness, \*Thou\* art a
priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> For there is a setting aside of the
commandment going before for its weakness and unprofitableness,

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> (for the law perfected nothing,) and the
introduction of a better hope by which we draw nigh to God.

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> And by how much \[it was\] not without
the swearing of an oath;

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> (for they are become priests without the
swearing of an oath, but he with the swearing of an oath, by him who
said, as to him, The Lord has sworn, and will not repent \[of it\],
\*Thou\* \[art\] priest for ever \[according to the order of
Melchisedec\];)

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> by so much Jesus became surety of a
better covenant.

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> And they have been many priests, on
account of being hindered from continuing by death;

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> but he, because of his continuing for
ever, has the priesthood unchangeable.

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> Whence also he is able to save completely
those who approach by him to God, always living to intercede for them.

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> For such a high priest became us, holy,
harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the
heavens:

<span id="an_7:27">7:27</span> who has not day by day need, as the high
priests, first to offer up sacrifices for his own sins, then \[for\]
those of the people; for this he did once for all \[in\] having offered
up himself.

<span id="an_7:28">7:28</span> For the law constitutes men high priests,
having infirmity; but the word of the swearing of the oath which \[is\]
after the law, a Son perfected for ever.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> Now a summary of the things of which we are
speaking \[is\], We have such a one high priest who has sat down on
\[the\] right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens;

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> minister of the holy places and of the true
tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, \[and\] not man.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> For every high priest is constituted for
the offering both of gifts and sacrifices; whence it is needful that
this one also should have something which he may offer.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> If then indeed he were upon earth, he would
not even be a priest, there being those who offer the gifts according to
the law,

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> (who serve the representation and shadow of
heavenly things, according as Moses was oracularly told \[when\] about
to make the tabernacle; for See, saith He, that thou make all things
according to the pattern which has been shewn to thee in the mountain.)

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> But now he has got a more excellent
ministry, by so much as he is mediator of a better covenant, which is
established on the footing of better promises.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> For if that first was faultless, place had
not been sought for a second.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> For finding fault, he says to them, Behold,
days come, saith the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant as
regards the house of Israel, and as regards the house of Juda;

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> not according to the covenant which I made
to their fathers in \[the\] day of my taking their hand to lead them out
of the land of Egypt; because \*they\* did not continue in my covenant,
and \*I\* did not regard them, saith \[the\] Lord.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> Because this \[is\] the covenant that I
will covenant to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord:
Giving my laws into their mind, I will write them also upon their
hearts; and I will be to them for God, and \*they\* shall be to me for
people.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> And they shall not teach each his
fellow-citizen, and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; because all
shall know me in themselves, from \[the\] little one \[among them\] unto
\[the\] great among them.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> Because I will be merciful to their
unrighteousnesses, and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never
remember any more.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> In that he says New, he has made the
first old; but that which grows old and aged \[is\] near disappearing.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> The first therefore also indeed had
ordinances of service, and the sanctuary, a worldly one.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> For a tabernacle was set up; the first, in
which \[were\] both the candlestick and the table and the exposition of
the loaves, which is called Holy;

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> but after the second veil a tabernacle
which is called Holy of holies,

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> having a golden censer, and the ark of the
covenant, covered round in every part with gold, in which \[were\] the
golden pot that had the manna, and the rod of Aaron that had sprouted,
and the tables of the covenant;

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> and above over it the cherubim of glory
shadowing the mercy-seat; concerning which it is not now \[the time\] to
speak in detail.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> Now these things being thus ordered, into
the first tabernacle the priests enter at all times, accomplishing the
services;

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> but into the second, the high priest only,
once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the
errors of the people:

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> the Holy Spirit shewing this, that the way
of the \[holy of\] holies has not yet been made manifest while as yet
the first tabernacle has \[its\] standing;

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> the which \[is\] an image for the present
time, according to which both gifts and sacrifices, unable to perfect as
to conscience him that worshipped, are offered,

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> \[consisting\] only of meats and drinks
and divers washings, ordinances of flesh, imposed until \[the\] time of
setting things right.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> But Christ being come high priest of the
good things to come, by the better and more perfect tabernacle not made
with hand, (that is, not of this creation,)

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> nor by blood of goats and calves, but by
his own blood, has entered in once for all into the \[holy of\] holies,
having found an eternal redemption.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> For if the blood of goats and bulls, and
a heifer's ashes sprinkling the defiled, sanctifies for the purity of
the flesh,

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> how much rather shall the blood of the
Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God,
purify your conscience from dead works to worship \[the\] living God?

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> And for this reason he is mediator of a
new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the
transgressions under the first covenant, the called might receive the
promise of the eternal inheritance.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> (For where \[there is\] a testament, the
death of the testator must needs come in.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> For a testament \[is\] of force when men
are dead, since it is in no way of force while the testator is alive.)

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> Whence neither the first was inaugurated
without blood.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> For every commandment having been spoken
according to \[the\] law by Moses to all the people; having taken the
blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, he
sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> saying, This \[is\] the blood of the
covenant which God has enjoined to you.

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> And the tabernacle too and all the
vessels of service he sprinkled in like manner with blood;

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> and almost all things are purified with
blood according to the law, and without blood-shedding there is no
remission.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> \[It was\] necessary then that the
figurative representations of the things in the heavens should be
purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with sacrifices
better than these.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> For the Christ is not entered into holy
places made with hand, figures of the true, but into heaven itself, now
to appear before the face of God for us:

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> nor in order that he should offer himself
often, as the high priest enters into the holy places every year with
blood not his own;

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> since he had \[then\] been obliged often
to suffer from the foundation of the world. But now once in the
consummation of the ages he has been manifested for \[the\] putting away
of sin by his sacrifice.

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> And forasmuch as it is the portion of men
once to die, and after this judgment;

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> thus the Christ also, having been once
offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear to those that look for
him the second time without sin for salvation.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> For the law, having a shadow of the
coming good things, not the image itself of the things, can never, by
the same sacrifices which they offer continually yearly, perfect those
who approach.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> Since, would they not indeed have ceased
being offered, on account of the worshippers once purged having no
longer any conscience of sins?

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> But in these \[there is\] a calling to
mind of sins yearly.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> For blood of bulls and goats \[is\]
incapable of taking away sins.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> Wherefore coming into the world he says,
Sacrifice and offering thou willedst not; but thou hast prepared me a
body.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> Thou tookest no pleasure in
burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> Then I said, Lo, I come (in \[the\] roll
of the book it is written of me) to do, O God, thy will.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> Above, saying Sacrifices and offerings
and burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou willedst not, neither
tookest pleasure in (which are offered according to the law);

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> then he said, Lo, I come to do thy will.
He takes away the first that he may establish the second;

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> by which will we have been sanctified
through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> And every priest stands daily
ministering, and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never
take away sins.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> But \*he\*, having offered one
sacrifice for sins, sat down in perpetuity at \[the\] right hand of God,

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> waiting from henceforth until his
enemies be set \[for the\] footstool of his feet.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> For by one offering he has perfected in
perpetuity the sanctified.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> And the Holy Spirit also bears us
witness \[of it\]; for after what was said:

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> This \[is\] the covenant which I will
establish towards them after those days, saith \[the\] Lord: Giving my
laws into their hearts, I will write them also in their understandings;

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> and their sins and their lawlessnesses
I will never remember any more.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> But where there \[is\] remission of
these, \[there is\] no longer a sacrifice for sin.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> Having therefore, brethren, boldness
for entering into the \[holy of\] holies by the blood of Jesus,

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> the new and living way which he has
dedicated for us through the veil, that is, his flesh,

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> and \[having\] a great priest over the
house of God,

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> let us approach with a true heart, in
full assurance of faith, sprinkled as to our hearts from a wicked
conscience, and washed as to our body with pure water.

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> Let us hold fast the confession of the
hope unwavering, (for he \[is\] faithful who has promised;)

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> and let us consider one another for
provoking to love and good works;

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> not forsaking the assembling of
ourselves together, as the custom \[is\] with some; but encouraging
\[one another\], and by so much the more as ye see the day drawing near.

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> For where we sin wilfully after
receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains any
sacrifice for sins,

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> but a certain fearful expectation of
judgment, and heat of fire about to devour the adversaries.

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> Any one that has disregarded Moses' law
dies without mercy on \[the testimony of\] two or three witnesses:

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> of how much worse punishment, think ye,
shall he be judged worthy who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and
esteemed the blood of the covenant, whereby he has been sanctified,
common, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> For we know him that said, To me
\[belongs\] vengeance; \*I\* will recompense, saith the Lord: and again,
The Lord shall judge his people.

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> \[It is\] a fearful thing falling into
\[the\] hands of \[the\] living God.

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> But call to mind the earlier days in
which, having been enlightened, ye endured much conflict of sufferings;

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> on the one hand, when ye were made a
spectacle both in reproaches and afflictions; and on the other, when ye
became partakers with those who were passing through them.

<span id="an_10:34">10:34</span> For ye both sympathised with prisoners
and accepted with joy the plunder of your goods, knowing that ye have
for yourselves a better substance, and an abiding one.

<span id="an_10:35">10:35</span> Cast not away therefore your
confidence, which has great recompense.

<span id="an_10:36">10:36</span> For ye have need of endurance in order
that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise.

<span id="an_10:37">10:37</span> For yet a very little while he that
comes will come, and will not delay.

<span id="an_10:38">10:38</span> But the just shall live by faith; and,
if he draw back, my soul does not take pleasure in him.

<span id="an_10:39">10:39</span> But \*we\* are not drawers back to
perdition, but of faith to saving \[the\] soul.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> Now faith is \[the\] substantiating of
things hoped for, \[the\] conviction of things not seen.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> For in \[the power of\] this the elders
have obtained testimony.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> By faith we apprehend that the worlds
were framed by \[the\] word of God, so that that which is seen should
not take its origin from things which appear.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> By faith Abel offered to God a more
excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained testimony of being
righteous, God bearing testimony to his gifts, and by it, having died,
he yet speaks.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> By faith Enoch was translated that he
should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him;
for before \[his\] translation he has the testimony that he had pleased
God.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> But without faith \[it is\] impossible to
please \[him\]. For he that draws near to God must believe that he is,
and \[that\] he is a rewarder of them who seek him out.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> By faith, Noah, oracularly warned
concerning things not yet seen, moved with fear, prepared an ark for the
saving of his house; by which he condemned the world, and became heir of
the righteousness which \[is\] according to faith.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> By faith Abraham, being called, obeyed to
go out into the place which he was to receive for an inheritance, and
went out, not knowing where he was going.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> By faith he sojourned as a stranger in
the land of promise as a foreign country, having dwelt in tents with
Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with \[him\] of the same promise;

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> for he waited for the city which has
foundations, of which God is \[the\] artificer and constructor.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> By faith also Sarah herself received
strength for \[the\] conception of seed, and \[that\] beyond a
seasonable age; since she counted him faithful who promised.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> Wherefore also there have been born of
one, and that of one become dead, even as the stars of heaven in
multitude, and as the countless sand which \[is\] by the sea shore.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> All these died in faith, not having
received the promises, but having seen them from afar off and embraced
\[them\], and confessed that they were strangers and sojourners on the
earth.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> For they who say such things shew
clearly that they seek \[their\] country.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> And if they had called to mind that
from whence they went out, they had had opportunity to have returned;

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> but now they seek a better, that is, a
heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God;
for he has prepared for them a city.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> By faith Abraham, \[when\] tried,
offered up Isaac, and he who had received to himself the promises
offered up his only begotten \[son\],

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> as to whom it had been said, In Isaac
shall thy seed be called:

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> counting that God \[was\] able to raise
\[him\] even from among \[the\] dead, whence also he received him in a
figure.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau
concerning things to come.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> By faith Jacob \[when\] dying blessed
each of the sons of Joseph, and worshipped on the top of his staff.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> By faith Joseph \[when\] dying called
to mind the going forth of the sons of Israel, and gave commandment
concerning his bones.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> By faith Moses, being born, was hid
three months by his parents, because they saw the child beautiful; and
they did not fear the injunction of the king.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> By faith Moses, when he had become
great, refused to be called son of Pharaoh's daughter;

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> choosing rather to suffer affliction
along with the people of God than to have \[the\] temporary pleasure of
sin;

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> esteeming the reproach of the Christ
greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, for he had respect to the
recompense.

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the
wrath of the king; for he persevered, as seeing him who is invisible.

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> By faith he celebrated the passover and
the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn might
not touch them.

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> By faith they passed through the Red
sea as through dry land; of which the Egyptians having made trial were
swallowed up.

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> By faith the walls of Jericho fell,
having been encircled for seven days.

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> By faith Rahab the harlot did not
perish along with the unbelieving, having received the spies in peace.

<span id="an_11:32">11:32</span> And what more do I say? For the time
would fail me telling of Gideon, and Barak, and Samson, and Jephthah,
and David and Samuel, and of the prophets:

<span id="an_11:33">11:33</span> who by faith overcame kingdoms, wrought
righteousness, obtained promises, stopped lions' mouths,

<span id="an_11:34">11:34</span> quenched \[the\] power of fire, escaped
\[the\] edge of the sword, became strong out of weakness, became mighty
in war, made \[the\] armies of strangers give way.

<span id="an_11:35">11:35</span> Women received their dead again by
resurrection; and others were tortured, not having accepted deliverance,
that they might get a better resurrection;

<span id="an_11:36">11:36</span> and others underwent trial of mockings
and scourgings, yea, and of bonds and imprisonment.

<span id="an_11:37">11:37</span> They were stoned, were sawn asunder,
were tempted, died by the death of the sword; they went about in
sheepskins, in goatskins, destitute, afflicted, evil treated,

<span id="an_11:38">11:38</span> (of whom the world was not worthy,)
wandering in deserts and mountains, and \[in\] dens and caverns of the
earth.

<span id="an_11:39">11:39</span> And these all, having obtained witness
through faith, did not receive the promise,

<span id="an_11:40">11:40</span> God having foreseen some better thing
for us, that they should not be made perfect without us.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> Let \*us\* also therefore, having so
great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, laying aside every weight,
and sin which so easily entangles us, run with endurance the race that
lies before us,

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> looking stedfastly on Jesus the leader
and completer of faith: who, in view of the joy lying before him,
endured \[the\] cross, having despised \[the\] shame, and is set down at
the right hand of the throne of God.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> For consider well him who endured so
great contradiction from sinners against himself, that ye be not weary,
fainting in your minds.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> Ye have not yet resisted unto blood,
wrestling against sin.

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> And ye have quite forgotten the
exhortation which speaks to you as to sons: My son, despise not \[the\]
chastening of \[the\] Lord, nor faint \[when\] reproved by him;

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> for whom \[the\] Lord loves he chastens,
and scourges every son whom he receives.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> Ye endure for chastening, God conducts
himself towards you as towards sons; for who is the son that the father
chastens not?

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> But if ye are without chastening, of
which all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> Moreover we have had the fathers of our
flesh as chasteners, and we reverenced \[them\]; shall we not much
rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> For they indeed chastened for a few
days, as seemed good to them; but he for profit, in order to the
partaking of his holiness.

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> But no chastening at the time seems to
be \[matter\] of joy, but of grief; but afterwards yields \[the\]
peaceful fruit of righteousness to those exercised by it.

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> Wherefore lift up the hands that hang
down, and the failing knees;

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> and make straight paths for your feet,
that that which is lame be not turned aside; but that rather it may be
healed.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> Pursue peace with all, and holiness,
without which no one shall see the Lord:

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> watching lest \[there be\] any one who
lacks the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble
\[you\], and many be defiled by it;

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> lest \[there be\] any fornicator, or
profane person, as Esau, who for one meal sold his birthright;

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> for ye know that also afterwards,
desiring to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, (for he found no
place for repentance) although he sought it earnestly with tears.

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> For ye have not come to \[the mount\]
that might be touched and was all on fire, and to obscurity, and
darkness, and tempest,

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> and trumpet's sound, and voice of
words; which they that heard, excusing themselves, declined \[the\] word
being addressed to them any more:

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> (for they were not able to bear what
was enjoined: And if a beast should touch the mountain, it shall be
stoned;

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> and, so fearful was the sight, Moses
said, I am exceedingly afraid and full of trembling;)

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> but ye have come to mount Zion; and to
\[the\] city of \[the\] living God, heavenly Jerusalem; and to myriads
of angels,

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> the universal gathering; and to \[the\]
assembly of the firstborn \[who are\] registered in heaven; and to God,
judge of all; and to \[the\] spirits of just \[men\] made perfect;

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> and to Jesus, mediator of a new
covenant; and to \[the\] blood of sprinkling, speaking better than Abel.

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> See that ye refuse not him that speaks.
For if those did not escape who had refused him who uttered the oracles
on earth, much more we who turn away from him \[who does so\] from
heaven:

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> whose voice then shook the earth; but
now he has promised, saying, Yet once will \*I\* shake not only the
earth, but also the heaven.

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> But this Yet once, signifies the
removing of what is shaken, as being made, that what is not shaken may
remain.

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> Wherefore let us, receiving a kingdom
not to be shaken, have grace, by which let us serve God acceptably with
reverence and fear.

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> For also our God \[is\] a consuming
fire.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> Let brotherly love abide.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> Be not forgetful of hospitality; for by
it some have unawares entertained angels.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> Remember prisoners, as bound with
\[them\]; those that are evil-treated, as being yourselves also in
\[the\] body.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> \[Let\] marriage \[be held\] every way in
honour, and the bed \[be\] undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers
will God judge.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> \[Let your\] conversation \[be\] without
love of money, satisfied with \[your\] present circumstances; for \*he\*
has said, I will not leave thee, neither will I forsake thee.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> So that, taking courage, we may say, The
Lord \[is\] my helper, and I will not be afraid: what will man do unto
me?

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> Remember your leaders who have spoken to
you the word of God; and considering the issue of their conversation,
imitate their faith.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> Jesus Christ \[is\] the same yesterday,
and to-day, and to the ages \[to come\].

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> Be not carried away with various and
strange doctrines; for \[it is\] good that the heart be confirmed with
grace, not meats; those who have walked in which have not been profited
by \[them\].

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> We have an altar of which they have no
right to eat who serve the tabernacle;

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> for of those beasts whose blood is
carried \[as sacrifices for sin\] into the \[holy of\] holies by the
high priest, of these the bodies are burned outside the camp.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> Wherefore also Jesus, that he might
sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate:

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> therefore let us go forth to him
without the camp, bearing his reproach:

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> for we have not here an abiding city,
but we seek the coming one.

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> By him therefore let us offer \[the\]
sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, \[the\] fruit of
\[the\] lips confessing his name.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> But of doing good and communicating
\[of your substance\] be not forgetful, for with such sacrifices God is
well pleased.

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> Obey your leaders, and be submissive;
for \*they\* watch over your souls as those that shall give account;
that they may do this with joy, and not groaning, for this \[would be\]
unprofitable for you.

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> Pray for us: for we persuade ourselves
that we have a good conscience, in all things desirous to walk rightly.

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> But I much more beseech \[you\] to do
this, that I may the more quickly be restored to you.

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> But the God of peace, who brought again
from among \[the\] dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep,
in \[the power of the\] blood of \[the\] eternal covenant,

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> perfect you in every good work to the
doing of his will, doing in you what is pleasing before him through
Jesus Christ; to whom \[be\] glory for the ages of ages. Amen.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> But I beseech you, brethren, bear the
word of exhortation, for it is but in few words that I have written to
you.

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> Know that our brother Timotheus is set
at liberty; with whom, if he should come soon, I will see you.

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> Salute all your leaders, and all the
saints. They from Italy salute you.

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> Grace \[be\] with you all. Amen.
