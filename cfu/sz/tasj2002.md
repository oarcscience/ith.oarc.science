## SHUNDAI ZATSUWA. BOOK ONE.—BENEVOLENCE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

<span class="small">THE AGED SCHOLAR'S PREFACE.</span>

   I was born in Musashi, and when my hair was first fastened in a queue
studied the Chinese poetry and history.<span
id="fr_1"></span>[<sup><span class="small">1</span></sup>](#note_1.md)
Thenceforth I wrote essays on themes which interested me, presented my
writings to the daimyō and was entertained in their mansions. Or, with
my box of books upon my back I lived like a traveller in Kyōto.
Afterwards I made my home in the north,<span
id="fr_2"></span>[<sup><span class="small">2</span></sup>](#note_2.md) ever
studying the ancient writings, and constantly strengthened my purpose to
perfect myself to the end of life. But, unexpectedly, I was summoned by
my lord and returned to my native place.<span
id="fr_3"></span>[<sup><span class="small">3</span></sup>](#note_3.md) Thus
have I grown old and imbecile and wait for death to pillow my head upon
the hills. Many years and months have passed away and now at
seventy-four, in the old age of horse or dog, though I love learning and
purpose to follow the "Way," I have no virtue that fits me to be leader
or teacher. Nor have I ability for aught else, and stay useless in the
world. This is far other than I had purposed. So I expound that which I
have learned to those who believe in the Old Man and come to him with
questions. If I can help future scholars it will be the reward for my
long life, and in illness and pain I comment constantly upon the
books.<span id="fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#note_4.md)

   One day after the exposition, when the talk was of the changes in the
learning since the times of the Sō, one of <span id="page_29">p.
29</span> those present expressed doubts as to the philosophy of
Tei-Shu;<span id="fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#note_5.md) and the Old Man replied:—

   When young I too studied with worthless teachers. I conned words and
wasted time until suddenly I perceived the folly of such study and
resolved to seek that wisdom of the men of old which is for one's
self.<span id="fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#note_6.md) Yet alas! Without teacher or
friend I was bewildered by the conflicting opinions of scholars, and
half doubted, half believed the teaching of Tei-Shu. So the time still
passed in vain until I was forty years of age when I fully accepted this
philosophy,<span id="fr_6a"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6a</span></sup>](#note_6a.md) understanding that nothing
could take its place. For thirty years I have read and pondered it.
Looking at its heights, how transcendent! Seeking to divide it, how
compact! Yet is it neither too far away and high, nor too shallow and
near at hand! Should Sages again appear they would follow it! For the
"Way" of Heaven and Earth is the "Way" of Gyō and Shun:<span
id="fr_7"></span>[<sup><span class="small">7</span></sup>](#note_7.md) the
"Way" of Gyō and Shun is the "Way" of Confucius and Mencius; and the
"Way" of Confucius and Mencius is the "Way" of Tei-Shu. Forsaking
Tei-Shu we cannot find Confucius and Mencius. Forsaking Confucius and
Mencius we cannot find Gyō and Shun; and forsaking Gyō and Shun we
cannot find the "Way" of Heaven and Earth. Do not trust implicitly an
aged scholar, but this I know and therefore speak. If I say that which
is false, that which I have not verified, may I instantly be punished by
Heaven and Earth.

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

   At this all present straightened themselves and listened intently.
The Old Man<span id="fr_8"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">8</span></sup>](#note_8.md) continued;—This has not waited
for my oath, it has been determined these five hundred years. From
Shushi's own time the great scholars of the Sō, the Gen and Min<span
id="fr_9"></span>[<sup><span class="small">9</span></sup>](#note_9.md) with
all who followed the Ethical Philosophy have fully accepted him. Men of
great learning debated, indeed, his style and minor points but said
nothing against his philosophy.<span id="fr_10"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">10</span></sup>](#note_10.md) So until the middle of the Min,
learning was pure and the celebrated truth unimpaired. Then came Ōyōmei
with his intuitionalism.<span id="fr_11"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">11</span></sup>](#note_11.md) He attacked Shushi and changed
the learning of the Min. After his death his pupils accepted the
Zen<span id="fr_12"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">12</span></sup>](#note_12.md) doctrines and thenceforth
scholars were intoxicated with intuitionalism and weary of natural
philosophy. They were either mere memorizers or they were Buddhists.
That men without one ten-thousandth of the learning of Tei-Shu should
readily find fault is for a wren to mock a bo,<span
id="fr_13"></span>[<sup><span class="small">13</span></sup>](#note_13.md)
for a caterpillar to measure the sea. As Kantaishi<span
id="fr_14"></span>[<sup><span class="small">14</span></sup>](#note_14.md)
says,—"To sit in a well and, looking at the <span id="page_31">p.
31</span> sky, pronounce it small." But the superficial ignorant men who
adopt these views because of their novelty are numberless.

   In our land with peace for an hundred years learning has flourished.
I cannot pronounce upon its value, but the ancient models and Tei-Shu
have been firmly accepted, a cause for thankfulness. But of late some
set forth false doctrine. They have established their school and
gathered followers. Evil scholars appear above whom these men seek to
advance themselves with senseless arguments, selfishly and wholly
without shame. It is the fashion for all the dogs to join when one sets
up his lying bark, so evil teachings and doctrines abound. Truly an evil
fortune has befallen the ethical philosophy.

   Kantaishi lived when Buddhism and Taoism flourished, and comparing
himself to Mencius attacked them single handed with an oath,—"The Gods
of Heaven and Earth are above, and to the right and left."<span
id="fr_15"></span>[<sup><span class="small">15</span></sup>](#note_15.md)
My oath has not the strength of Mencius but I do not purpose to fall
behind the oath of Kantaishi. See to it that you do not hear in vain!"

 

<span class="small">PRIEST GENKU'S OATH.</span>

   The celebrated priest Genku sent his oath to Tsukinowa, Kujō, Kyōto.
The document is still in the temple <span id="page_32">p. 32</span> of
Shin-kuro-tani. I have not seen it but have been told that it is as
follows, "If those who say nembutsu<span id="fr_16"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">16</span></sup>](#note_16.md) go not to Heaven may I sink to
Hell." Buddhists doubtless think that a strong oath, but from the point
of view of our philosophy what could be more vain? If there is no
heaven, of course there is no hell! It is easy to utter such oaths!

   In the old days when retainers died with their lords,<span
id="fr_17"></span>[<sup><span class="small">17</span></sup>](#note_17.md)
in a certain clan many samurai were determined thus to end their lives.
Among them was one young man who was especially lamented by every one.
His karō called at his house and sought to dissuade him. But in vain.
Finally, however, as the karō continued importunate his multitude of
words forced consent, and the samurai with an oath promised to forego
his purpose. So the official went home content. But on the morrow when
he went to the temple with those who had resolved to die together there
with the rest was this samurai saying his farewells to the guests. The
karō exclaimed: "Though you deceive me how dare you break your oath? It
is impious!" But the samurai laughed as he replied, "Forgive me for
deceiving you. Yesterday had I not sworn you would not have left me, so
I swore to satisfy you. As to the gods, though they punish me there is
nothing more than death, and as I had determined to die I swore
purposing to break my oath." The karō had not a word to say.

   Such was priest Genku's oath. He knew there is no Hell, nothing
beyond falling into the grave. But my oath is not like these. "With
sovereign Heaven above, and treading the sovereign Earth beneath,"<span
id="fr_18"></span>[<sup><span class="small">18</span></sup>](#note_18.md)
by Heaven and Earth <span id="page_33">p. 33</span> I swear. So like
Genku I purpose to swear for my "Way" but if my oath is false I am
punished by Heaven and Earth. Consider, in Buddhism "is" becomes "is
not"<span id="fr_19"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">19</span></sup>](#note_19.md) and truth is made falsehood.
Only as that which "is not" becomes that which "is" can we make that
which "is" into that which "is not." Only as we turn lies into truth can
we turn truth into lies. Though we know that this talk of Heaven and
Hell is false, still is it taught as if falsehood and truth were one. So
is it taught to many men without distinction of wise and foolish, that
if we say nembutsu punishment will be destroyed. This is Buddha's
mystery. And here in Japan are many priests who are like the founders of
sects who hold this mystery in their hearts. They transfer it from heart
to heart and never say that all the talk of Heaven and Hell is false.
Genku's oath was such a propagating oath. There is neither Heaven for
Tsukinowa nor Hell for Genku. "Is not" is put for "is" and lies for
truth, that men may be separated from birth and death. Such was Buddha's
purpose.

   Compare their scheme with our philosophy which guides men by the very
truth! The difference is as the difference between the clouds and the
earth.

 

<span class="small">HERESIES MANY.</span>

   Once when the Old Man was ill his friends came to see him and he
begged them to stay and cheer his loneliness. So they spent the day in
conversation about the prevalent opinions. And one remarked: "I have
heard the leading scholars of Edo and Kyōto. Some expound what they call
our national religion and confound it with the Way of the <span
id="page_34">p. 34</span> Gods: others follow Ōyōmei and his
intuitionalism; and others explain the ancient learning after new
principles. Where is the truth in this confusion of strange and familiar
opinions? What in your heart do you think?" And the Old Man replied:—

   "I too have heard of these schools which have established themselves
and teach heresy. Their wisdom is such as you described. But I cannot
agree with them. For the "Way" is from Heaven and its source is one. If
we know that source we shall not distinguish the religion of our country
from that of foreign lands; nor will intuitionalism be opposed to
natural philosophy; nor will the learning of the Sages be put in
opposition to Tei-Shu. The classical literature teaches all this, but it
is not easy nor to be understood unless studied with humble and single
minds. But scholars now-a-days are proud, and few of them thoroughly
study the Tei-Shu works. Without knowing even the hedge of Tei-Shu they
make their own hearts supreme and readily refute those great scholars.
We shall postpone the consideration of their learning. We grieve over
their thin, light, restless, shallow learning. They have not thoroughly
studied Confucius and Mencius and do not understand them, so how can
they fail to doubt Tei-Shu? They superficially attack them but I hear of
no attacks on Confucius and Mencius. It is not that these scholars do
not doubt the Sages but they know that Confucius and Mencius have been
honoured and accepted by the world for two thousand years and that it
will not listen to attacks upon them. But Shushi is modern and some in
the age of the Min attacked him, so they feel at liberty to revile him.
"They act according to the man" and not from established principles.
They know that their philosophy can in no wise equal that of the Sages,
and so make their excuses while they permit themselves to revile Shushi.
Thus they hope to exalt themselves above him. But be that as it may!

   As to Shintō, it professes to help our country and calls <span
id="page_35">p. 35</span> the Sages rebels.<span
id="fr_20"></span>[<sup><span class="small">20</span></sup>](#note_20.md)
Such a "Way of the Gods" is apart from Benevolence and Righteousness.
The illustrious virtue of intuitionalism is only the "nature" of the
Buddhists. The intuitionalists call Musashibo Benkei<span
id="fr_21"></span>[<sup><span class="small">21</span></sup>](#note_21.md) a
samurai of wisdom, humanity and bravery! Such intuitionalism is not of a
heart that can distinguish good and evil.

   And there are men professing the ancient learning who declare that
the Great Learning is not the work of a Sage,<span
id="fr_22"></span>[<sup><span class="small">22</span></sup>](#note_22.md)
and that Confucianism and Buddhism are one! Such ancient learning is
apart from virtue.<span id="fr_23"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">23</span></sup>](#note_23.md)

   The Old Man doubts all these teachings. Only the philosophy of
Tei-Shu unites outer and inner, includes Benevolence and Righteousness,
makes past and present one, and is the orthodox school descended in a
straight line from Confucius and Mencius. My only deep anxiety is that
its followers will merely argue and expound instead of practising what
they preach. Such orthodoxy avails nothing. This evil abounded in the
time of the Min, and so it was that <span id="page_36">p. 36</span>
Ōyōmei could reproach Shushi with this side issue. This is the source of
heresy and the classics ever forbid such forgetfulness of practice and
indulgence in empty talk. It is a subject for the most profound
consideration.

 

<span class="small">THE BLIND OF HEART.</span>

   Then one remarked: "We agree that we can best overcome heresy by
exhorting each other and striving after right conduct. So did Mencius
when he replied to the attack of Yo-Bu<span
id="fr_24"></span>[<sup><span class="small">24</span></sup>](#note_24.md)
for he disregarded the charge of being disputatious and concluded his
exposition of fundamental principles saying: "The superior man returns
to the right line." Still more should we degrade the "Way" now-a-days
when heresies and heretics are like weeds on a plain and evil principles
and contemptible opinions are like the fallen leaves of a forest, were
we to reply to each one. Recently I was astounded at the words of a
philosopher: "The way comes not from Heaven," said he, "it was invented
by the sages. Nor is it in accord with nature; it is a mere matter of
æsthetics and ornament.<span id="fr_25"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">25</span></sup>](#note_25.md) Of the five relations only the
conjugal is natural, while loyalty, filial obedience and the rest were
invented by the sages and have been maintained on their authority ever
since." Surely among all heresies from ancient days until now none has
been so monstrous as this."

   The listeners at this spoke together and laughed, and the Old Man
said:—

   "You know Sotōba's<span id="fr_26"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">26</span></sup>](#note_26.md) parable about the sun? A man
<span id="page_37">p. 37</span> born blind once asked: "What is the sun
like?" and was told: "It is round like this gong," the speaker tapping
the gong as he spoke. Oh! It has a voice! the blind man thought. And
another said, "It gives light," and put a candle before his eyes. The
blind man touched the candle and thought: "The sun is long and slender!"

   So is it with most men. Though they read books they are in the dark
as to principles, and with open eyes they are blind in heart. And their
much thinking is like this blind man's study of the sun. How can they
fail to err! It is not necessary to discuss such opinions: it would be
like discussing good and evil with men who have no hearts. Those who
argue with them are like unto them.

   I know the origin of such notions. These men are mere students of the
letter. They like to hunt through a multitude of books but do not
establish their hearts upon the classics. They study words and
commentaries but do not seek the profound truth. They are ignorant of
their own darkness and are given over to learned vanity and the love of
empty praise. So has it been since the time of the Min. These men desire
high things, revile the former superior men and set themselves above the
scholars of the past. But the wise man sees that their learning is
"remote" and that they are intoxicated with the poison of Jun and
So<span id="fr_27"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">27</span></sup>](#note_27.md) and that their style is a mere
culling of the ornaments of Ori.<span id="fr_28"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">28</span></sup>](#note_28.md) With their heretical learning
they declare that the "Way" is not from Heaven. Testing it with their
own base hearts they say that only the conjugal relation is <span
id="page_38">p. 38</span> "natural." Their arguments are weak but many
believe them and the world seems to fancy their base opinions. We shall
grieve indeed that thus they may increasingly injure the minds of men,
and the accepted truth. To prevent such evil, empty words were punished
in the Book of Rites.<span id="fr_29"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">29</span></sup>](#note_29.md)

   But in such a world for me, without talent or virtue, to stop the
evil is to prop up a great house with a single stick. Who would believe
my polemic or my exposition? And how should I escape the reproach of not
knowing the limits of my powers? The Tei-Shu philosophy is like the
ceremonial robes of former kings; but this is like selling the garments
of civilized men to savages. Though his philosophy is the celebrated
music of the world yet now is it like Eikaku's Song of Spring<span
id="fr_30"></span>[<sup><span class="small">30</span></sup>](#note_30.md)
among a people of barbarous speech. As the Book of Poetry says: "Who
knows me says: He has sorrow in his heart; Who knows me not says:
Something he seeks; Blue, distant Sky! What man is this?"<span
id="fr_31"></span>[<sup><span class="small">31</span></sup>](#note_31.md)
So sang the officer of Shu in his sorrow over the downfall of the house
of Shu, and such is my grief over the decay of the "Way."

 

<span class="small">THE FOOL'S MOUNTAIN.</span>

   But I do not seek collaborators in this present age. Evil customs and
false opinions from of old have flourished like rootless things, and
bloom, with noisy reputation, for an <span id="page_39">p. 39</span>
hour. As the ages pass there is a sure return to the "Way" though to
look for it in haste shows inexperience.

   You know the works of Resshi.<span id="fr_32"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">32</span></sup>](#note_32.md) He tells of a Mr. Fool who with
his children laboured every day with pick and basket removing a mountain
that stood inconveniently near his house. Mr. Wiseman jeered at the
folly: "How can a few men remove a mountain?" But Mr. Fool replied: "I
begin the task, my children continue it, their children after them and
grandchildren's children labour on and finally it will be done." Thereat
Mr. Wiseman laughed the more.

   Such conduct men call silly and such men fools, and the critics are
called "wise." But with such a "fool's" heart anything in heaven or
earth can be done. And the men of wisdom with "Mr. Wiseman's" heart
laugh at the Fool's mountain and accomplish nothing. For the world's
folly is wisdom and its wisdom folly.

   After my death comes a day that will settle this debate of an hundred
years. Meanwhile men laugh at my roundabout ways, but I am old and
stubborn, determined to go on in this purpose to the end. You may class
me with Mr. Fool and his hill.

 

<span class="small">THE OLD PRIEST'S TREE-GRAFTING.</span>

   But I have another thought. Beyond Shinobu-ga-oka is a village called
Yanaka with a temple of the Shin-gon sect; and there I often played when
a boy. Once I heard a priest tell this story:—

   In the period Kan-ei (A.D. 1624-1643) the Shōgun came to Yanaka on a
hawking expedition, and as he followed the birds, chanced upon the
temple with only an attendant or two. <span id="page_40">p. 40</span> An
old priest eighty years of age was grafting trees, and, with no notion
of the Shōgun's rank, continued at his work. The Shōgun said: "What are
you doing, Priest?" The priest thought the question foolish and replied
shortly: "Grafting trees." The Shōgun laughed: "Such an old priest will
not live to see them grow. What is the profit in your hard work?" The
priest returned: "Who are you that says such a heartless thing?
Consider! The trees will be big enough to darken the temple in the time
of future priests. I work for the temple, not for myself alone." The
Shōgun was filled with admiration. Meanwhile attendants kept coming up
bearing the Shōgun's crest, and the priest recognizing his visitor fled
in dismay. But the Shōgun called him back and rewarded him.

   I am like this old priest. To the end of life I study the established
principles, teach and write books that there may be the beginning of
true learning in a future age. If I can help the "Way" one
ten-thousandth, though I die still shall I live.<span
id="fr_33"></span>[<sup><span class="small">33</span></sup>](#note_33.md)
As one of old said: "Though dead the bones do not decay." So think I. I
do not labour for myself at all. Believe me! Such is the Old Man's
heart.

 

<span class="small">SEKKŌ'S DRAGON.</span>

   But deep would be my shame were I to be like Sekkō. From youth have I
cherished the Sages and superior men, reading their books, but I know
them only from books and <span id="page_41">p. 41</span> understand only
the beginning of their true character. Were I to meet a living Sage who
should prove different from those I have been cherishing, might I not
hate him? I have such fears. And if I at all hate the Sages then all I
say is false, a shame not comparable to the shame of hills and valleys.
And how then should I wait for the coming age?

   In the olden time Sekkō fancied dragons, painted them and spent days
and nights in loving them. A real dragon heard of it and thought, if he
is so devoted to painted dragons if I visit him how he will love me! So
straightway he put his head through the window, but Sekkō fled
panic-struck!

   Among the scholars of the east and the west are some true men but
most of them are proud and vain, desirous only of reputation and
applause while professing to love the Sages. Should they meet a living
sage they could not look him in the face. Their daily admiration is like
Sekkō's devotion to dragons. Learning without the practice of virtue is
like swimming in a field. In illustration of my meaning I will tell you
a story of thirty years ago.

   In Kaga I had a friend, a samurai of low rank named Sugimoto. While
absent in Adzuma with his lord his son Kujurō, who was fifteen years
old, quarrelled with a neighbor's son of the same age over a game of
*go*, lost his self control and before he could be seized drew his sword
and cut the boy down. While the wounded boy was under the surgeon's care
Kujurō was in custody, but he showed no fear and his words and acts were
calm beyond his years. After some days the boy died and Kujurō was
condemned to hara-kiri. The officer in charge gave him a farewell feast
the night before he died. He calmly wrote to his mother, took
ceremonious farewell of his keeper and all in the house and then said to
the guests: I regret to leave you all and should like to stay and talk
till day-break; but I must not be sleepy when I commit hara-kiri
to-morrow so I'll go to <span id="page_42">p. 42</span> bed at once. Do
you stay at your ease and drink the wine. So he went to his room and
fell asleep, all being filled with admiration as they heard him snore.
On the morrow he arose early, bathed, dressed himself with care, made
all his preparations with perfect calmmess and then, quiet and composed,
killed himself. No old, trained, self-possessed samurai could have
excelled him. No one who saw it could speak of it for years without
tears.

   At the beginning of the affair I wrote to his father: "Though Kujurō
commit hara-kiri he is so calm and collected there need be no regret. Be
at peace." But as Sugimoto read the letter he remarked: "A child often
will be brave enough as others encourage it before the moxa is applied,
and yet burst into tears when it feels the heat. My child is so young
that I cannot be at peace until I hear that he has done the deed with
bravery." As the proverb says, "Only such fathers have such sons." I
have told you this that Kujurō may be remembered. It would be shameful
were it to be forgotten that so young a boy performed such a deed.

   But there is another reason also. Were I and all who study the words
and mimic the actions of the ancient Sages to meet a living one
different from our notions we should be like the child who cries as he
feels the moxa applied. Surely it were shameful to study for years,
attain the name of philosopher, and yet be less brave than this child
Kujurō.

   Therefore examine yourselves with this thought.

 

<span class="small">RENJAKU CASTS AWAY HIS MEDICINE-SPOON.</span>

   At a later meeting the Old Man said: I have not finished what I was
saying the other day about learning true and false. To day I'll make an
end.

   Three classes of scholars attack Shushi:

   1st, the school of Ōyōmei. Ōyōmei was a strong man, and although his
arguments will not stand examination still <span id="page_43">p.
43</span> he was not wholly without reason. For in his day most scholars
were busy with words and phrases and neglected self-examination. So he
supposed that the "science" of Shushi was apart from righteousness and
with his "intuitions" sought to examine himself. We approve his purpose.
But Shushi's "science" does not neglect our intuitions but shows that
they arise from "things." Apart from "things" can we seek our
intuitions, after the fashion of Ōyōmei? But are not the classics, the
ceremonies and music the teaching of former kings? What are these if not
"things"? There are the six classics and the hundred deeds. Loyalty and
disloyalty, truth and falsehood, we know their principles by "things."
If intuitively we know all about reverence what need for the study of
the ceremonies? And if by nature we are peaceful what need for music?
Again, if intuitively we can govern our actions, making progress in
loyalty and truth, if there is so short and easy a path why did not the
sages teach it instead of their long and difficult "Way"? Then further,
with what shall we employ these "intuitions" if not with "things"?
"Surely" they will say, "in self examination and and casting away lust
we will employ our intuitions." Let me illustrate: The knowledge of the
five sounds is by the ears, so let us mind our ears and know the five
sounds without hearing them! And the knowledge of the five colours is by
the eyes; let us attend to them and know the five colours without seeing
them! And the knowledge of the five tastes is by the mouth, so if we
have a care for it we shall know them without eating! Is it not plain
that though the knowledge of the five sounds and of the rest is in
ourselves, yet the colours, sounds and tastes are in "things" and that
we know them only as we listen, look and eat? Still less can we know the
finer distinctions of light and deep in colour, of pure and impure in in
sounds, and of delicate and harsh in tastes apart from things, for these
differences are in the things."<span id="fr_34"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">34</span></sup>](#note_34.md)

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

   Without study we know that we must love our parents and reverence our
elder brother, yet by our performance of these duties do we investigate
the principles. So is it with all the hundred virtues of the Superior
Man. If we are not thus "scientific" but use our intuitions merely, we
shall not distinguish good and evil. Since filial piety is the beginning
of the hundred virtues. I'll speak of that a while.

   All filial sons know such precepts as "In the morning reflect and in
the evening consider."<span id="fr_35"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">35</span></sup>](#note_35.md) Yet even that is not known to
the rustics who do not lack loving hearts. Still more as to "nourishing"
our parents, all nourish them, yet is there the difference between
merely caring for the body and nourishing also the heart. And though all
reverence parents, yet many do not follow the severe, strict way with
such precepts as,—"Do not speak of old age before them,"<span

and "Do not speak angrily before them, not even to a dog or horse."<span
id="fr_35"></span>[<sup><span class="small">35</span></sup>](#note_35.md)
All this is included in filial piety, and though a Sage might fulfil
this law without learning the particulars one by one, surely not so an
ordinary scholar. <span id="page_45">p. 45</span> Such an one would not
simply fail to fulfil the whole law, he would fall into actual
transgressions.

   We are not to cease obeying for the sake of study, nor must we
establish all the laws before we begin to obey. In our obedience we are
to establish its rightness or wrongness, examining ourselves as we read
what the Sages say, tasting them carefully and reading them throughout.
All the virtues are illustrated by what I have said. This is the
scientific philosophy. Follow this course constantly and learn
thoroughly these laws and at last you will not err, though you simply
follow the dictates of your filial love. This is Tei-Shu's mystery, but
only those who strive earnestly can know its flavour.

   The expression of Mencius, "To know without learning is intuitive
knowledge"<span id="fr_36"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">36</span></sup>](#note_36.md) means that there is in man,
before he studies, a heart which loves parent and reverences elder
brother. Make that heart the foundation, study and we shall strengthen
that power. Mencius did not teach that we can be perfect without study!
This attempt to correct Shushi by casting aside the natural philosophy
is not merely to misunderstand him. It is so to straighten the crooked
that it bends backward.

   2nd.—The scholars who reject the "ri-ki-tai-yo"<span
id="fr_37"></span>[<sup><span class="small">37</span></sup>](#note_37.md)
doctrine of Shushi and declare that it is not taught by Confucius and
Mencius. But in reply we remember that Confucius said "The nature is
alike;"<span id="fr_38"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">38</span></sup>](#note_38.md) and Mencius said, "The nature
is good"<span id="fr_39"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">39</span></sup>](#note_39.md) and he further set forth the
"yo-ki-ya-ki" doctrine which is not in the more ancient books. Confucius
did not use these words of Shushi, but the scholars of the Sō did not
offend against his principles. They knew none of these doubts and
especially praised the <span id="page_46">p. 46</span> discovery of what
the Sages had not taught. The age of the Sō was long after Confucius and
Mencius, and the scholars were busy with arguments and in the
explanation of the "Way," and were not so careful to repeat the words of
the Sages so long as their principles were not violated. When Shushi
teaches that which is not in Confucius and Mencius, let us learn his
meaning by careful thought and study. If there seem to be disagreement
let us restrain our doubts, for if we declare that his doctrine does not
please us and that it is opposed to the Sages the superficiality of our
scholarship will be manifest. Such notions show shallow carelessnes. I
cannot argue all of these points but will speak in brief of ki and ri
(spirit and law.)<span id="fr_40"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">40</span></sup>](#note_40.md)

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

   These scholars say: "In Heaven and Earth there is only spirit (ki),
flowing through the four seasons; it produces all things and naturally
ceases not. This is the Way of Heaven, Clearly is it as we see it. It is
nonsense for Shushi to put above this spirit another formless thing
called law."<span id="fr_41"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">41</span></sup>](#note_41.md) Even in China there were
formerly many scholars who could not rid themselves of these doubts
though they professed to have studied carefully Shushi. They at least
did not settle the matter at a glance like our Japanese scholars. Of
course I cannot pretend to settle the mysterious question of the
priority of ki or ri at a sitting, but I will talk a while, taking an
illustration from Laotze.<span id="fr_42"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">42</span></sup>](#note_42.md)

   "Reckoning up the wheel there is no wheel; reckoning up the year,
there is no year." Let us see, this is the rim, this the hub, this the
axle, this the spoke; but the rim is not the wheel, nor the hub, nor the
axle, nor the spokes. Yet if we cast these away the wheel goes too. But
the law of the wheel preceded it and before the wheel was made the <span
id="page_48">p. 48</span> principle was determined. And because the law
is imperishable the carpenter follows it and makes the wheel. See then!
Does the wheel come from the spokes and rim or do these come from the
wheel? If we say the wheel comes from the parts we know its form but not
its law.

   So with the year. Twelve hours make one day, thirty days make a
month, twelve months make a year. This then we say, is an hour, a day, a
month or a year, and if we cast them aside, without them there is no
year. But on the three hundred and sixty-sixth day sun and earth return
and meeting make the year. For the year is not in day or month, but its
"law" was determined first and sun and moon revolve according to this
plan. So for ages calendars have been made, and for years and days that
are not yet, for an hundred years to come as for the hundred years past.
For the "law" is not in day or month but is forever. So is it that
"Heaven speaks not, yet the four seasons labour and all things are
produced."<span id="fr_43"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">43</span></sup>](#note_43.md) For this is the centre, the
main pillar of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons work by it and all
things are begotten. This is the meaning of the expression: Reckoning up
the wheel there is no wheel, and reckoning up the year there is no
year."

   Separated from "spirit" is no "law" for thus without form or place we
should say simply "reason" (dori). Confucius by the shape separated the
upper and the lower and over against the utensil placed the "Way"; and
so Shushi by the form separated the before and after and over against
the "spirit" placed the "law." The reasoning is the same. To neglect the
fundamental reason and argue from the leaves and branches is to cause
only confusion: no conclusion can be reached.

   In like manner we reason of "body" and "activity." Where is activity
there is always body. Body is quiet, <span id="page_49">p. 49</span>
motionless, activity moves and acts. Quietly nourished activity dwells
with body, reflecting and moving body works with activity. This is what
the expression, body and activity are one in origin without the least
separation, means. Confucius said: "The Superior Man reforms that which
is within with reverence, and establishes that which is without with
righteousness."<span id="fr_44"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">44</span></sup>](#note_44.md) Shishi said: "With moderation
and harmony establish the universal way."<span
id="fr_45"></span>[<sup><span class="small">45</span></sup>](#note_45.md)
And Mencius: "Benevolence and righteousness are the great and holy
way."<span id="fr_46"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">46</span></sup>](#note_46.md) Without the words "body" and
"activity" yet is the reason the same in all, and "body" and "activity"
are in them all. But that crooked school of scholars rests content with
the trifies it knows, and of course does not understand that perfect
body and great activity are included in the "Way." There is no necessity
for a thorough argument with them.

   3rd.—These scholars are dissolute and weary of the illustrious
virtue. They study only books and words. When once they hear the saying
of Shushi: "With care and reverence establish the truth," they think it
the common place of an antiquated scholar. They do not know that
philosophers study by self-examination. As they noisily assail the ears
of men with their babble, no reply is to to be made to them. We can only
draw a deep sigh.

   Henjaku twice prescribed for the Duke of Sei, but the third time as
he could do nothing more he cast away his medicine spoon and fled in
dismay. Daily the disease of <span id="page_50">p. 50</span> philosophy
increases. Even Henjaku could not cure it. Still less can I, aged and
talentless. I can only cover my mouth and flee in dismay.<span
id="fr_47"></span>[<sup><span class="small">47</span></sup>](#note_47.md)

 

<span class="small">THE VIRTUE OF THE GODS.</span>

   When, one day, five or six students remained after the lecture to ask
questions, one said:—I have a question. Many scholars explain 'Shin-tō'
by saying that 'Japan is the Land of the Gods.' But their teaching is
fantastic and opposed to reason. Since even the Sage did not speak
lightly of the Gods<span id="fr_48"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">48</span></sup>](#note_48.md) such men as we cannot
understand it. We wish your help. We shall gain food for future thought.
And as all were of one mind Okina replied:—

   In the Book of Changes it is said, "The Sages formed their teaching
by the Way of the Gods."<span id="fr_49"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">49</span></sup>](#note_49.md) That is, their teaching is
called 'The Way of the Gods' to manifest its Divine mystery, as we speak
of the Way of Benevolence. But the 'Way of the Gods' is not a religion
by itself. So I cannot accept that which is popularly called Shin-tō and
that is exalted above the teaching of the Sages as our native religion.
I do not profess to understand the profound reason of the Divinities but
in outline this is my idea:—

   The Doctrine of the Mean speaks of the "virtue of the Gods"<span
id="fr_50"></span>[<sup><span class="small">50</span></sup>](#note_50.md)
and Shushi explains this word "virtue" to mean "the heart and its
revelation." Its meaning is thus stated <span id="page_51">p. 51</span>
in the Saden, "God is pure intelligence, and justice."<span
id="fr_51"></span>[<sup><span class="small">51</span></sup>](#note_51.md)
Now all know that God is just but do not know that he is intelligent.
But there is no such intelligence elsewhere as God's. Man hears by the
ear and where the ear is not he hears not though as quick of hearing as
Shikō; and man sees with his eyes and where they are not he sees not,
though as quick of sight as Rirō;<span id="fr_52"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">52</span></sup>](#note_52.md) and with his heart man thinks
and the swiftest thought takes time. But God uses neither ear nor eye,
nor does he pass over in thought. Directly he feels, and directly does
he respond. This then we should know is not two or three but just the
virtue received from the one truth. Thus, in Heaven and Earth is a being
of quickest eye and ear, separated from no time or place, now in this
manner, communicating instantaneously, embodied in all things, filling
the universe. Having of course neither form nor voice it is not seen nor
heard by men. When there is truth it feels and when it feels it
responds. When there is no truth it feels not and when it feels not
there is no response. Responding at once it is, not responding it
naturally is not. Is not this the Divinity of Heaven and Earth? So the
Doctrine of the Mean says: "Looked for it cannot be seen, listened to it
cannot be heard. It enters into all things! There is nothing without
it."<span id="fr_53"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">53</span></sup>](#note_53.md)

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

   It is like Priest Saigyō's verse at the Shrines in Ise,<span
id="fr_54"></span>[<sup><span class="small">54</span></sup>](#note_54.md)

   "Though not knowing what it is, Grateful tears he weeps."

   Are not his tears from his perception of truth? Before the shrine he
stands, single hearted, direct, with truth; and to his truth God also
comes and they commune, and so it is he weeps.

   As the reflection in the clear water answers to the moon, and
together moon and pool increase the light, so if continually in the one
truth they are dissolved we cannot distinguish God and man, even as sky
and water, water and sky unite in one. "Everywhere, everywhere, on the
right He seems and on the left."<span id="fr_55"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">55</span></sup>](#note_55.md) This is the revealing of God,
the truth not to be concealed. Think not that God is distant but seek
Him in the heart, for the heart is the House of God. Where there is no
obstacle of lust, of one spirit with the God of Heaven and Earth there
is this communion. But except by this communion there is not such a
thing. Saigyō did not weep before he went to the shrine and by this we
know God came.

   And now for the application. Examine yourselves, make the truth of
the heart the foundation, increase in learning and at last you will
attain. Then you will know the truth of what I speak.

   As thus he spoke all were silent, impressed by the great thoughts of
the aged philosopher. They too shed grateful tears like the priest
before the shrine.

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

 

<span class="small">THE TRUTH OF THE SAGE.</span>

   The Old Man continued: Consider the saying, "Shun by doing nothing
rules."<span id="fr_56"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">56</span></sup>](#note_56.md) The truth of the Sage is
Divine. When anything there is we cannot use this phrase "doing
nothing." Not knowing what it is or why but only that it is most holy
and Divine "grateful tears he weeps." When the Sage enrobed with folded
arms is in the place of power<span id="fr_57"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">57</span></sup>](#note_57.md) the empire honours him as the
sun and moon, imitates him as one imitates his parents and communes with
him more than with the formless God of Heaven and Earth. Wherever he
goes there is reformation as the fluid shapes itself to the vessel. When
Shun was a farmer all naturally sought the enlargement of their
neighbor's fields, and when he was a potter all turned out pieces
without flaws. His thought is Divine and accomplishes that on which his
heart rests as readily as one turns his hand. When Confucius would work
reformation he merely rested in the place and the result was attained,
and when he willed to move men, all followed in peace. How far is this
from the thoughts of ordinary men!<span id="fr_58"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">58</span></sup>](#note_58.md)

   The Sages did not "do" wonders, but their truth cannot be hidden.
When the Superior Man utters a word within his room the response comes
from a thousand miles and still more is his neighborhood reformed. And
if an evil word is spoken a thousand miles are changed, and still more
<span id="page_54">p. 54</span> is the immediate neighborhood
corrupted.<span id="fr_59"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">59</span></sup>](#note_59.md) Not instantly does it go a
thousand miles, but as the wind moves from blade of grass to blade so
does that done in private go from house to province and on, increasing,
to the empire. This is the nature of things, the truth that cannot be
hidden. So the superior man is busy with self-reformation and cares
nothing for outward effect and ornament, yet are his hidden riches
revealed like a silken robe worn beneath a worthless wrap. But the
vulgar man cares nothing for self-culture and only for display, like him
who vainly seeks to cover up decay which yet increasingly manifests
itself.

   Maijō reproved the king of Go: "If you would not that men should
know, do not act; and if you would not have them hear, do not
speak."<span id="fr_60"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">60</span></sup>](#note_60.md) This is a celebrated saying,
simple in expression but profound in meaning. To speak evil or to do it,
thinking it will not be known, is to add interest to the principal and
to bind a burden on the back which grows heavy day by day. At last its
weight is great, how shall it be concealed? All sin, except the Sage,
even the superior man. But the superior man does not attempt to conceal
his faults, but reforms them in the sight of men. Error and repentance
are without attempt at concealment and thus virtue is increased. The
error of the superior man is like the eclipse of the sun or moon, all
see the error and all are impressed by his repentance.<span
id="fr_61"></span>[<sup><span class="small">61</span></sup>](#note_61.md)
Though less than the truth of the Sage when men see such a face and hear
such words they believe and follow, nor is any exertion necessary. This
is the true "communion." It never can be rivalled by the leadership of
wisdom, power or gifts. How partial the saying, "Good stays within the
gates but evil goes a thousand miles." Both when real go everywhere.

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

 

<span class="small">MONSTERS ARISE FROM MAN.</span>

   A listener asked:—Since God is just and quick to perceive there may
well be such communion with truth. But tradition from of old speaks of
the appearance of evil things. Does reason account for them also? And
the Old Man replied:

   The Gods are the activity of Heaven and Earth, the good power of the
In and Yō<span id="fr_62"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">62</span></sup>](#note_62.md) and of course of the true
"law." Man's nature is originally good but as it is individualized good
and evil appear.<span id="fr_63"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">63</span></sup>](#note_63.md) So too as God descends to man's
world there is good and evil. For though the working through the four
seasons of the spirit of the five elements of the In and Yō is of the
right "law" of Heaven <span id="page_56">p. 56</span> and Earth and not
of evil at all, yet as that "spirit" is scattered throughout the
universe and confused there arise unexpectedly winds, heat, cold and
storms. Thus naturally there are evil spirits which are known as they
are felt by men. When with a righteous "spirit" we feel, the righteous
"spirits" respond; and when with an evil "spirit" we feel, the evil
"spirits" respond. And as both good and bad come from this "feeling and
response" with the In and Yō we cannot refuse to call the bad also,
gods. In Heaven and Earth is no place where these "spirits" are not. The
"feeling" of the good "spirits" whether great or small is all of the
pure heart. So in the empire have the good qualities of humble men been
perceived miraculously; and, in a private station frost has been
perceived in summer and Kantaishi "felt" the alligator in the evil
valley.<span id="fr_64"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">64</span></sup>](#note_64.md) Such events are extraordinary,
but they are not to be doubted and are all caused by the pure "feeling."

   I read a while ago, in the writings of Shinseisan, of the daughter of
a farmer. Her father was ill and she prayed that she might suffer in his
stead. Because of this "feeling and response" for one night many birds
sang round the house, three great stars shone in the sky, lighting up
the eaves like the moon; and in the morning the farmer was well. Seisan
was the head of the village and knew the facts. He named the place,—"The
village of great filial piety," and set up a memorial. This is a certain
fact and an illustration of the feeling of which I speak.

   But in a degenerate age man's heart is evil; for the most part he
"feels" the evil spirits and monsters appear. The Sage did not speak of
wonders,<span id="fr_65"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">65</span></sup>](#note_65.md) of feats of strength,
confusions or divinities, yet as their "law" is included in "the
distinction of things," they must be mentioned.

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

   In the Saden, Shinju of Rō thus writes of monsters:—"When men fear
then monsters arise by the flickering flames of the spirit. Monsters
arise from men."<span id="fr_66"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">66</span></sup>](#note_66.md) This accords well with our
science. When the fire is undetermined the flame flickers, dying down
and flashing up, and there is a state of man's spirit which is like
this. As the proverb says,—"Men wish to see the thing they fear." They
cannot forget it and led by their fancies, as the flame flashes up and
dies down, now they see it and then they see it not. At last so giddy is
their spirit that they question their own identity and then, into that
opening the spirits thrust themselves and show their forms in visions
and monsters and things of evil. These come by the flames of the spirit,
and cease by the "feeling" of the good spirits.

   In the tales of Tō-Sō<span id="fr_67"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">67</span></sup>](#note_67.md) it is said that at Lake Do-tei
is a temple to the water god, where travellers pray before they embark.
A merchant of firm faith, and mindful of his prayers as he crossed year
by year, was drowned at last in a storm. Thereupon his son in grief and
anger came determined to burn, on the morrow, the temple which had
failed to aid in spite of prayers and gifts. But in his dreams the god
appeared in fright and said:—"Forgive me and to-morrow you shall hear
Divine music on the lake. I fear neither the <span id="page_58">p.
58</span> burning of the temple nor your wrath, but seek forgiveness
since I cannot ward off the fixed determination of your mind."

   This trifling story teaches that the gods fear a determined mind. Had
the man been undertermined whether he should burn or not, now resolute
and now irresolute, he had been cursed.

   In the castle of Sumpu<span id="fr_68"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">68</span></sup>](#note_68.md) was a fox called Uba. It would
put a towel on its head and dance, no form being seen, only the towel
waving in the air. As the towel was taken from the hand by the fox a
rubbing was felt across the palm. And the young men would seek to hold
the towel fast but could not. Ōkubo Hikozaemon,<span
id="fr_69"></span>[<sup><span class="small">69</span></sup>](#note_69.md)
however, held out the towel and the fox could not take it; for he had
resolved when he felt the touch to cut with his sword both fox and hand.
The fox knew his purpose and was powerless. When the heart of the
samurai is determined there is no entrance and the fox can work no ill.
Still more is this the case with Sages and superior men. For evil melts
before the righteous spirits like ice before the sun. Those who practice
evil arts against such men find their curses returned upon themselves.
But good men are few and evil spirits abound.

   And, further, men worship at profane temples and believe in Buddhism.
As a shadow goes with a body so if there is strong belief even where
there is naught we shall construct a being. Wonders are seen and folks
are more and more deceived and the truth is lost. Trifles are thought to
be of the gods and the Buddhas and are foolishly called their answers.
The priests invent lies, deceive the people, assembling them together
until the offerings of pennies are like mountains. These cheats are the
thieves of the nation, a great evil to the empire.

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

 

<span class="small">THE GOBLIN OF HIDAYAMA.</span>

   After a pause the Old Man continued:—This "feeling and response" of
the gods is the thoroughfare of the spirit. If there is the least
"touch" of the spirit, though it show not in voice or face the gods know
it at once. But when in perfect quiet there is no mixture of the spirit
the gods can find no place to enter in. This is the true nature
(honbun), what I call the "self." The verse of Sha-rei-un<span
id="fr_70"></span>[<sup><span class="small">70</span></sup>](#note_70.md)
happens to set off my thought although he did not know the profound I
meaning of the "self:"—

   "The perfect man exalts himself."

   The Book of Changes says: "Heaven opposes not, still less does man or
god."<span id="fr_71"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">71</span></sup>](#note_71.md) This of course is true of man,
and also of Heaven and the gods. So the Sage kings with this "self" were
above the empire,—"The empire is only I, who can break my resolution?"
The later philosophers put "self" apart from ten thousand, and in the
midst of the multitude knew only "self."

   Where then is this "self"? It is before all thought, the reality of
the unmoved. Superior men cherish it, Heaven and Earth are given rank by
it and by it all things are reared. From it "feeling" goes to God and
there is nothing apart from it. As Shokosetsu says, "If there is not a
thought even the gods cannot know; if not by self then not by
anyone."<span id="fr_72"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">72</span></sup>](#note_72.md) Here is a vulgar illustration
which I heard in Kaga.

   A sawyer was making boards in the woods of Hidayama when he saw a
hermit with a long nose, and took him for a goblin. Thereon the hermit
said: "Why do you take me for a goblin and hate me and wish me away?"
The sawyer in extremity picked up his things to depart <span
id="page_60">p. 60</span> when a board slipped by chance and hit the
goblin on the nose. "You dreadful man," it cried, "I cannot understand
your thoughts," and ran away. It could not endure the unpurposed hit. So
it is that, "if there is no thought even the gods cannot know."

   But ordinary minds are ever moved by the undetermined thoughts and
fancies with which they are filled. So they are led by spirits,
enchained by things and the "self" cannot assert itself. We must nourish
the source of "self" if we would not lose it and first of all by getting
rid of lust. Without lust, in repose, and without plans or thought, from
this empty quietness alone, in accord with right reason does movement
come, determined before all and thus after all is no fall. This it is to
command the gods and not be commanded by them. Without voice or odour it
is the foundation of the empire, a formless body. Without thought or act
it is the source of all.<span id="fr_73"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">73</span></sup>](#note_73.md)

\*   \*   \*   \*   \*

   Unknown of men the origin of a thought in darkness and solitude is
like the coming of spring while winter still is here. Just as the
thought begins to come there is the distinction of right and wrong, as
this year and next divides while winter remains. A thousand miles of
error come from an inch. In the trifle is the separation of right and
wrong, their division and their boundary gate. "Ceaselessly we must
guard this gate" asking our hearts whether right or wrong is in our
choice. Thus to forsake all evil and follow good is the beginning of the
practice of our philosophy. Careless here, knowing good and evil only as
shown in face and act, is to be too late. Struggle as we may we shall
not attain.

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

 

<span class="small">ALL "WAYS" ENTER BY DEEDS.</span>

   Many who had been absent for a time came again and excused themselves
saying: We have been busy and so have been negligent. But the Old Man
replied:

   It is the fashion for scholars to say that occupation with the
affairs of the world has made them negligent. I too have made that
mistake. But the true difficulty is a want of resolution while we,
unmindful of that, lay the blame on our occupation. This doubtless may
interfere with our study of the books but "learning" is the practice of
the "Way" of the Sages. True, we must know the "laws" if we are to act
aright and these are learned not merely from books, though the study of
the classics is to be put first. Read, learn the "laws" and then search
them out in conduct and affairs; this is true knowledge, the knowledge
that is the beginning of right conduct. The "Way" of the Sages is not
apart from the things of every day. Loyalty, obedience, friendship, all
the relations are in this "learning," and not a movement, not even our
resting, is without its duty.

   Ōyōmei's followers reproach the "science" of Shushi and say:
Doubtless it is admirable, but how shall busy men find time to learn its
universal laws? Thus they misunderstand Shushi to teach that first at
our leisure we determine "laws" and only afterwards begin to practise
them. Not so! We learn loyalty and obedience as we are loyal and
obedient. To-day I know yesterday's shortcomings and to-morrow shall I
know to-day's. This is the knowledge of the scientific philosophy. In
our occupations we learn whether conduct conforms to right, and so
advance in the truth by practice.

   Big and little describe things and not principles, so everywhere and
always may we learn philosophy, nor should we despise anything. For
principles are decided by the <span id="page_62">p. 62</span> things of
Heaven and Earth. But all in proper order, not neglecting the important
things of every day that the laws of trees or blades of grass may be
determined. In the "Way" of Heaven and Earth there is nothing which
comes not from deeds. And where there is anything there is the rule.
Just as with the six accomplishments we learn by practice and yet not
without rules, so is it with the "Way." Though I have an intuition, if I
know not the rule of its application I am like an unpolished jewel or
unsmelted ore.

   An old samurai thus taught his pupils. Be not samurai through the
wearing of two swords, but day and night have a care to bring no
reproach on the name. When you cross your threshold and pass out through
the gate go as men who shall never return again. Thus shall you be ready
for every adventure you may meet. All men of deep earnestness think
thus. The Buddhist is forever to remember the five commandments and the
samurai the laws of chivalry. But these are easy, being of limited
application. But philosophy is of all things, and in all the scholar
finds his duty. And especially three things must never be forgotten, the
blessings of parent, lord and Sage. Parents bestow and cherish the body,
not a hair even is apart from them and their love. The daimyō gives us
all we have, and maintains us, not a chopstick save from him. And the
Sage instructs us and saves us from the state of the brutes. Remembering
these blessings the original nature is not lost, Heaven's reason is not
destroyed and all the virtues are brought together. This is the mystery
of our philosophy. Impress it even on your bodies.

   But now-a-days young men seek only pleasure. Careless of their duty
to parent and lord they fall into selfishness. And their elders and
scholars know not the blessing of the Sages but are proud and desirous
of fame, without a drop of truth. Did they know this mystery they would
curb their proud spirits and become helpers in the "way" of virtue. But
now, teachers and pupils laugh at the <span id="page_63">p. 63</span>
truth of Shushi till head and stomach ache. Were they to hear my
threefold mystery their stomachs would pain them to the point of
throwing up. But all who truly know understand that it is not an empty
and senile word.

Dr. Legge translates "ki" \#\#\# "passion nature" and remarks.—"On
\#\#\# {. . . ki} there is much vain babbling in the Comm. to show how
the \#\#\# {ki} of heaven and earth is the \#\#\# {ki} also of man." And
he translates 13 thus, "This is the passion nature: it is exceedingly
great and exceedingly strong. Being nourished by rectitude, and
sustaining no injury, it fills up all between heaven and earth." The
Tei-Shu school would perhaps question who is here guilty of vain
babbling. If men like our author and his master Shushi understood the
classics, the \#\#\# {ki} of heaven and earth may well be identified
with the \#\#\# {ki} in man. Indeed I do not see how their philosophy
can be otherwise explained. Dr. Legge elsewhere writes; "Khi (ki), or
'spirit,' is the breath, still material but purer than the Zing
(essence) and belongs to the finer, and more active part of the ether."
"The Yi King" p. 355 note, Vol. XVI "Sacred Books of the East." And
again he writes,—"The name of the intelligent spirit is literally 'the
knowing breath' . . . . . . . . 'the breath' being used like the Hebrew
ruach and the Latin spiritus." "I have adduced it to show how he
(Confucius) held that, while man's body crumbles and returns to the dust
at death, the liberated spirit, 'the breath' as he phrases it, ascends
to a brighter state." "The Religions of China" pp. 119-121. In fact the
Stoic 'pneuma' is the "ki" of the school of Tei-Shu, and so of the
dominant system of Chinese thought to our day:—"The human soul, as <span
id="footnotes_page_47">p. 47</span> defined by the Stoics, is an inborn
breath. . . . . It is a part severed from the Deity." "The latter
pervades the world as an all pervading breath. The human soul is a part
of the Deity, or an emanation from the same; the soul and its source act
and react upon each other. The soul is the warm breath in us'. Opinions
differed as to its life after the death of the body. Ueberweg's History
of Philosophy, Vol. I, pp. 194-196, Eng. trans. See "Ki Ri and Ten"

of pneuma. Griffith John translates "ri" "immaterial principle" and "ki"
material principle. See my "Comment" below for a summary of Shushi's

good. It is the same with the "ri," the "law," but when it is
individualized, when it unites with the "ki-nature," both good and evil
appear. This "ki-nature" varies, is thin or dense, is the air, the
breath, the essence of the five elements, forms matter. It is in man as
his "spirit" which may therefore be thought of as material, but matter
might also be thought of as ethereal. The spirit within us "feels" the
spirit without and the latter "responds." So there is a revelation of
the invisible, a theophany, but it is of the will of man and not of the
will of God, p. 51 above. Evil seems to be confusion, the good powers
appearing at the wrong times. The five elements are wood, fire, earth,
metal, water. Perhaps the five elements would be better translated, "the
five activities" manifested in the five elements. I am indebted for this
suggestion, as for many others, to the Rev. H. Waddell, A. B.

he is deceived by the evil "ki" and monsters appear.
