------------------------------------------------------------------------

This book is an exposition of orthodox neo-Confucian thought from
Tokugawa Japan. Kyusō lived from 1658-1734, and the *Shundai Zatsuwa*
was compiled and published posthumously by his grandson in 1750.
According to Knox, the work is not considered to be a classic, but it
was well respected and "\[i\]n the Shundai Zatsuwa of Kyusō Murō we have
the ruling ideas of the Japan that has forever passed away."
([Introduction, p. 25](tasj2001.htm#page_25).md). In addition to
philosophy, the book has many anecdotal stories from Chinese and
Japanese history illustrating the results of the virtuous conduct of the
Confucian sage and the honorable samurai. This translation was
originally published in the *Transactions of the Asiatic Society of
Japan*, volume 20, part 1 \[1892\] under the title *A Japanese
Philosopher*. The remainder of that issue (60 more pages) was also taken
up with discussions relating to this article, which are not presented in
this iteration.

The Sino-Japanese characters in the footnotes have been eliminated
(replaced with \#\#\#), apologies. Also, some of the footnotes were
numbered inconsistently and consequently had to be renumbered, and some
of the typographical errors in the text were silently corrected.
