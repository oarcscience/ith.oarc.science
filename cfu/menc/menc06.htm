<p>1. Mencius said, 'He who, using force, makes a pretence to benevolence
is the leader of the princes. A leader of the princes requires a large
kingdom. He who, using virtue, practises benevolence is the sovereign of
the kingdom. To become the sovereign of the kingdom, a prince need not wait
for a large kingdom. T'ang did it with only seventy l&icirc;, and king Wan
with only a hundred.</p>

<p>2. 'When one by force subdues men, they do not submit to him in heart.
They submit, because their strength is not adequate to resist. When one
subdues men by virtue, in their hearts' core they are pleased, and
sincerely submit, as was the case with the seventy disciples in their
submission to Confucius. What is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>

<blockquote>
"From the west, from the east,<br />
From the south, from the north,<br />
There was not one who thought of refusing submission,"
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">is an illustration of this.'</p>


<p>1. Mencius said, 'Benevolence brings glory to a prince, and the opposite
of it brings disgrace. For the princes of the present day to hate disgrace
and yet to live complacently doing what is not benevolent, is like hating
moisture and yet living in a low situation.</p>

<p>2. 'If a prince hates disgrace, the best course for him to pursue, is to
esteem virtue and honour virtuous scholars, giving the worthiest among them
places of dignity, and the able offices of trust. When throughout his
kingdom there is leisure and rest from external troubles, let him, taking
advantage of such a season, clearly digest the principles of his government
with its legal sanctions, and then even great kingdoms will be constrained
to stand in awe of him.</p>

<p>3. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>

<blockquote>
"Before the heavens were dark w1th rain,<br />
I gathered the bark from the roots of the mulberry trees,<br />
And wove it closely to form the window and door of my nest;<br />
Now, I thought, ye people below,<br />
Perhaps ye will not dare to insult me."
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Confucius said, "Did not he who made this ode
understand the way of governing?" If a prince is able rightly to govern his
kingdom, who will dare to insult him?</p>

<p>4. 'But now the princes take advantage of the time when throughout their
kingdoms there is leisure and rest from external troubles, to abandon
themselves to pleasure and indolent indifference;-- they in fact seek for
calamities for themselves.</p>

<p>5. 'Calamity and happiness in all cases are men's own seeking.</p>

<p>6. 'This is illustrated by what is said in the Book of Poetry,--</p>

<blockquote>
Be always studious to be in harmony with the ordinances of God,<br />
So you will certainly get for yourself much happiness;" 
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">and by the passage ofthe T&acirc;i Chiah,-- "When
Heaven sends down calamities, it is still possible to escape from them;
when we occasion the calamities ourselves, it is not possible any longer to
live."'</p>



<p>1. Mencius said, 'If a ruler give honour to men of talents and virtue
and employ the able, so that offices shall all be filled by individuals of
distinction and mark;-- then all the scholars of the kingdom will be
pleased, and wish to stand in his court.</p>

<p>2. 'If, in the market-place of his capital, he levy a ground-rent on the
shops but do not tax the goods, or enforce the proper regulations without
levying a ground-rent;-- then all the traders of the kingdom will be
pleased, and wish to store their goods in his market-place.</p>

<p>3. 'If, at his frontier-passes, there be an inspection of persons, but no
taxes charged on goods or other articles, then all the travellers of the
kingdom will be pleased, and wish to make their tours on his roads.</p>

<p>4. 'If he require that the husbandmen give their mutual aid to cultivate
the public feld, and exact no other taxes from them;-- then all the
husbandmen of the kingdom will be pleased, and wish to plough in his
fields.</p>

<p>5. 'If from the occupiers of the shops in his market-place he do not exact
the fine of the individual idler, or of the hamlet's quota of cloth, then
all the people of the kingdom will be pleased, and wish to come and be his
people.</p>

<p>6. 'If a ruler can truly practise these five things, then the people in
the neighbouring kingdoms will look up to him as a parent. From the first
birth of mankind till now, never has any one led children to attack their
parent, and succeeded in his design. Thus, such a ruler will not have an
enemy in all the kingdom, and he who has no enemy in the kingdom is the
minister of Heaven. Never has there been a ruler in such a case who did not
attain to the royal dignity.'</p>



<p>1. Mencius said, 'All men have a mind which cannot bear to see
the sufferings of others.</p>

<p>2. 'The ancient kings had this commiserating mind, and they, as a matter of
course, had likewise a commiserating government. When with a commiserating
mind was practised a commiserating government, to rule the kingdom was as
easy a matter as to make anything go round in the palm.</p>

<p>3. 'When I say that all men have a mind which cannot bear
to see the sufferings of others, my meaning may be illustrated thus:--
even now-a-days, if men suddenly see a child about to fall into a well,
they will without exception experience a feeling of alarm and distress.
They will feel so, not as a ground on which they may gain the
favour of the child's parents, nor as a ground on which they may
seek the praise of their neighbours and friends, nor from a dislike
to the reputation of having been unmoved by such a thing.</p>

<p>4. 'From this case we may perceive that the feeling of commiseration is
essential to man, that the feeling of shame and dislike is essential to
man, that the feeling of modesty and complaisance is essential to man, and
that the feeling of approving and disapproving is essential to man.</p>

<p>5. 'The feeling of commiseration is the principle of benevolence.
The feeling of shame and dislike is the principle of righteousness. The
feeling of modesty and complaisance is the principle of propriety. The
feeling of approving and disapproving is the principle of knowledge.</p>

<p>6. 'Men have these four principles just as they have their four limbs.
When men, having these four principles, yet say of themselves that they
cannot develop them, they play the thief with themselves, and he who says
of his prince that he cannot develop them plays the thief with his
prince.</p>

<p>7. 'Since all men have these four principles in themselves, let them
know to give them all their development and completion, and the issue will
be like that of fire which has begun to burn, or that of a spring which has
begun to find vent. Let them have their complete development, and they will
suffice to love and protect all within the four seas. Let them be denied
that development, and they will not suffice for a man to serve his parents
with.'</p>



<p>1. Mencius said, 'Is the arrow-maker less benevolent than the
maker of armour of defence? And yet, the arrow-maker's only fear is lest
men should not be hurt, and the armour-maker's only fear is lest men should
be hurt. So it is with the priest and the coffin-maker. The choice of a
profession, therefore, is a thing in which great caution is required.</p>

<p>2. 'Confucius said, "It is virtuous manners which constitute the
excellence of a neighbourhood. If a man, in selecting a residence, do not
fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?" Now, benevolence is the
most honourable dignity conferred by Heaven, and the quiet home in which
man should awell. Since no one can hinder us from being so, if yet we are
not benevolent;-- this is being not wise.</p>

<p>3. 'From the want of benevolence and the want of wisdom will ensue the
entire absence of propriety and righteousness;-- he who is in such a case
must be the servant of other men. To be the servant of men and yet ashamed
of such servitude, is like a bowmaker's being ashamed to make bows, or an
arrow-maker's being ashamed to make arrows.</p>

<p>4. 'If he be ashamed of his case, his best course is to practise
benevolence.</p>

<p>5. 'The man who would be benevolent is like the archer. The archer adjusts
himself and then shoots. If he misses, he does not murmur against those who
surpass himself. He simply turns round and seeks the cause of his failure in
himself.'</p>



<p>1. Mencius said, 'When any one told Tsze-l&ucirc; that he had a fault,
he rejoiced.</p>

<p>2. 'When Y&uuml; heard good words, he bowed to the speaker.</p>

<p>3. 'The great Shun had a still greater delight in what was good.
He regarded virtue as the common property of himself and others, giving up
his own way to follow that of others, and delighting to learn from others
to practise what was good.</p>

<p>4. 'From the time when he ploughed and sowed, exercised the potter's art,
and was a fisherman, to the time when he became emperor, he was continually
learning from others.</p>

<p>5. 'To take example from others to practise virtue, is to help them in the
same practice. Therefore, there is no attribute of the superior man greater
than his helping men to practise virtue.'</p>



<p>1. Mencius said, 'Po-&icirc; would not serve a prince whom he did not
approve, nor associate with a friend whom he did not esteem. He would not
stand in a bad prince's court, nor speak with a bad man. To stand in a bad
prince's court, or to speak with a bad man, would have been to him the same
as to sit with his court robes and court cap amid mire and ashes. Pursuing
the examination of his dislike to what was evil, we find that he thought it
necessary, if he happened to be standing with a villager whose cap was not
rightly adjusted, to leave him with a high air, as if he were going to be
defiled. Therefore, although some of the princes made application to him
with very proper messages, he would not receive their gifts.-- He would not
receive their gifts, counting it inconsistent with his purity to go to
them.</p>

<p>2. 'H&ucirc;i of Li&ucirc;-hsi&acirc; was not ashamed to serve an impure
prince, nor did he think it low to be an inferior officer. When advanced to
employment, he did not conceal his virtue, but made it a point to carry out
his principles. When neglected and left without office, he did not murmur.
When straitened by poverty, he did not grieve. Accordingly, he had a
saying,"You are you, and I am I. Although you stand by my side with breast
and aims bare, or with your body naked, how can you defile me?" Therefore,
self-possessed, he companied with men indifferently, at the same time not
losing himself. When he wished to leave, if pressed to remain in office, he
would remain.-- He would remain in office, when pressed to do so, not
counting it required by his purity to go away.'</p>

<p>3. Mencius said, 'Po-&icirc; was narrow-minded, and H&ucirc;i of
Li&ucirc;-hsi&acirc; was wanting in self-respect. The superior man will not
manifest either narrow-mindedness, or the want of self-respect.'</p>
