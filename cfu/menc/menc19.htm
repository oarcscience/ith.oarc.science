<p>1. Mencius said, 'Po-&icirc; would not allow his eyes to look on a bad
sight, nor his ears to listen to a bad sound. He would not serve a prince
whom he did not approve, nor command a people whom he did not esteem. In a
time of good government he took office, and on the occurrence of confusion
he retired. He could not bear to dwell either in a court from which a
lawless government emanated, or among lawless people. He considered his
being in the same place with a villager, as if he were to sit amid mud and
coals with his court robes and court cap. In the time of Ch&acirc;u he
dwelt on the shores of the North sea, waiting the purification of the
kingdom. Therefore when men now hear the character of Po-&icirc;, the
corrupt become pure, and the weak acquire determination.</p>

<p>2. '&Icirc; Yin said, "Whom may I not serve? My serving him makes him my
sovereign. What people may I not command? My commanding them makes them my
people." In a time of good government he took office, and when confusion
prevailed, he also took office. He said, "Heaven's plan in the production
of mankind is this:-- that they who are first informed should instruct
those who are later in being informed, and they who first apprehend
principles should instruct those who are slower in doing so. I am the one
of Heaven's people who has first apprehended;-- I will take these
principles and instruct the people in them." He thought that among all the
people of the kingdom, even the common men and women, if there were any who
did not share in the enjoyment of such benefits as Y&acirc;o and Shun
conferred, it was as if he himself pushed them into a ditch;-- for he took
upon himself the heavy charge of the kingdom.</p>

<p>3. 'H&ucirc;i of Li&ucirc;-hsi&acirc; was not ashamed to serve an impure
prince, nor did he think it low to be an inferior officer. When advanced to
employment, he did not conceal his virtue, but made it a point to carry out
his principles. When dismissed and left without office, he did not murmur.
When straitened by poverty, he did not grieve. When thrown into the company
of village people, he was quite at ease and could not bear to leave them.
He had a saying, "You are you, and I am I. Although you stand by my side
with breast and arms bare, or with your body naked, how can you defile me?"
Therefore when men now hear the character of H&ucirc;i of
Li&uuml;-hsi&acirc;, the mean become generous, and the niggardly become
liberal.</p>

<p>4. 'When Confucius was leaving Ch'&icirc;, he strained off with his
hand the water in which his rice was being rinsed, took the rice, and went
away. When he left L&ucirc;, he said, "I will set out by-and-by:"-- it was
right he should leave the country of his parents in this way. When it was
proper to go away quickly, he did so; when it was proper to delay, he did
so; when it was proper to keep in retirement, he did so; when it was proper
to go into office, he did so:-- this was Confucius.'</p>

<p>5. Mencius said,'Po-&icirc; among the sages was the pure one; &Icirc;
Yin was the one most inclined to take office; H&ucirc;i of
Li&ucirc;-hsi&acirc; was the accommodating one; and Confucius was the
timeous one.</p>

<p>6. 'In Confucius we have what is called a complete concert. A complete
concert is when the large bell proclaims the commencement of the music, and
the ringing stone proclaims its close. The metal sound commences the
blended harmony of all the instruments, and the winding up with the stone
terminates that blended harmony. The commencing that harmony is the work of
wisdom. The terminating it is the work of sageness.</p>

<p>7. 'As a comparison for wisdom, we may liken it to skill, and as a
comparison for sageness, we may liken it to strength;-- as in the case of
shooting at a mark a hundred paces distant. That you reach it is owing to
your strength, but that you hit the mark is not owing to your
strength.'</p>



<p>1. P&ecirc;i-kung &Icirc; asked Mencius, saying, 'What was the
arrangement of dignities and emoluments determined by the House of
Ch&acirc;u?'</p>

<p>2. Mencius replied, 'The particulars of that arrangement cannot be
learned, for the princes, disliking them as injurious to themselves, have
all made away with the records of them. Still I have learned the general
outline of them.</p>

<p>3. 'The S<span class="small01">ON OF</span> H<span class="small01">EAVEN
</span> constituted one dignity; the <span class="small01">KUNG</span>
one; the <span class="small01">H&Acirc;U</span> one; the 
<span class="small01">P&Acirc;I</span> one; and the 
<span class="small01">TSZE</span> and the <span class="small01">NAN</span>
each one of equal rank:-- altogether making five degrees of rank. The 
<span class="small01">RULER</span> again constituted one dignity; the 
<span class="small01">CHIEF MINISTER</span> one; the 
<span class="small01">GREAT OFFICERS</span> one; the 
<span class="small01">SCHOLARS OF THE FIRST CLASS</span> one; 
<span class="small01">THOSE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS</span> one; and 
<span class="small01">THOSE OF THE LOWEST CLASS</span> one:-- altogether 
making six degrees of dignity.</p>

<p>4. 'To the Son of Heaven there was allotted a territory of a thousand
l&icirc; square. A Kung and a H&acirc;u had each a hundred l&icirc; square.
A P&acirc;i had seventy l&icirc;, and a Tsze and a Nan had each fifty
l&icirc;. The assignments altogether were of four amounts. Where the
territory did not amount to fiftyl&icirc;, the chief could not have access
himself to the Son of Heaven. His land was attached to some H&acirc;u-ship,
and was called a <span class="small01">F&Ucirc;-YUNG</span>.</p>

<p>5. 'The Chief ministers of the Son of Heaven received an amount of
territory equal to that of a H&acirc;u; a Great officer received as much as
a P&acirc;i; and a scholar of the first class as much as a Tsze or a
Nan.</p>

<p>6. 'In a great State, where the territory was a hundred l&icirc; square,
the ruler had ten times as much income as his Chief ministers; a Chief
minister four times as much as a Great officer; a Great officer twice as
much as a scholar of the first class; a scholar of the first class twice as
much as one of the middle; a scholar of the middle class twice as much as
one of the lowest; the scholars of the lowest class, and such of the common
people as were employed about the government offices, had for their
emolument as much as was equal to what they would have made by tilling the
fields.</p>

<p>7. 'In a State of the next order, where the territory was seventy
l&icirc; square, the ruler had ten times as much revenue as his Chief
minister; a Chief minister three times as much as a Great officer; a Great
officer twice as much as a scholar of the first class; a scholar of the
first class twice as much as one of the middle; a scholar of the middle
class twice as much as one of the lowest; the scholars of the lowest class,
and such of the common people as were employed about the government
offices, had for their emolument as much as was equal to what they would
have made by tilling the fields.</p>

<p>8. 'In a small State, where the territory was fifty l&icirc; square, the
ruler had ten times as much revenue as his Chief minister; a Chief minister
had twice as much as a Great officer; a Great officer twice as much as a
scholar of the highest class; a scholar of the highest class twice as much
as one of the middle; a scholar of the middle class twice as much as one of
the lowest; scholars of the lowest class, and such of the common people as
were employed about the government offices, had the same emolument;-- as
much, namely, as was equal to what they would have made by tilling the
fields.</p>

<p>9. 'As to those who tilled the fields, each husbandman received a
hundred m&acirc;u. When those m&acirc;u were manured, the best husbandmen
of the highest class supported nine individuals, and those ranking next to
them supported eight. The best husbandmen of the second class supported
seven individuals, and those ranking next to them supported six; while
husbandmen of the lowest class only supported five. The salaries of the
common people who were employed about the government offices were regulated
according to these differences.'</p>



<p>1. Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'I venture to ask the principles of
friendship.' Mencius replied, 'Friendship should be maintained without any
presumption on the ground of one's superior age, or station, or the
circumstances of his relatives. Friendship with a man is friendship with
his virtue, and does not admit of assumptions of superiority.</p>

<p>2. 'There was Mang Hsien, chief of a family of a hundred chariots. He
had five friends, namely, Yo-chang Chi&ucirc;, M&ucirc; Chung, and three
others whose names I have forgotten. With those five men Hsien maintained a
friendship, because they thought nothing about his family. If they had
thought about his family, he would not have maintained his friendship with
them.</p>

<p>3. 'Not only has the chief of a family of a hundred chariots acted thus.
The same thing was exemplified by the sovereign of a small State. The duke
H&ucirc;i of P&icirc; said, "I treat Tsze-sze as my Teacher, and Yen Pan as
my Friend. As to Wang Shun and Ch'ang Hs&icirc;, they serve me."</p>

<p>4. 'Not only has the sovereign of a small State acted thus. The same
thing has been exemplified by the sovereign of a large State. There was the
duke P'ing of Tsin with H&acirc;i T'ang:-- when T'ang told him to come into
his house, he came; when he told him to be seated, he sat; when he told him
to eat, he ate. There might only be coarse rice and soup of vegetables, but
he always ate his fill, not daring to do otherwise. Here, however, he
stopped, and went no farther. He did not call him to share any of Heaven's
places, or to govern any of Heaven's offices, or to partake of any of
Heaven's emoluments. His conduct was but a scholar's honouring virtue and
talents, not the honouring them proper to a king or a duke.</p>

<p>5. 'Shun went up to court and saw the sovereign, who lodged him as his
son-in-law in the second palace. The sovereign also enjoyed there Shun's
hospitality. Alternately he was host and guest. Here was the sovereign
maintaining friendship with a private man.</p>

<p>6. Respect shown by inferiors to superiors is called giving to the noble
the observance due to rank. Respect shown by superiors to inferiors is
called giving honour to talents and virtue. The rightness in each case is
the same.'</p>



<p>1. Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'I venture to ask what
feeling of the mind is expressed in the presents of friendship?' Mencius
replied, 'The feeling of respect.'</p>

<p>2. 'How is it,' pursued Chang, 'that the declining a present is
accounted disrespectful?' The answer was, 'When one of honourable rank
presents a gift, to say in the mind, "Was the way in which he got this
righteous or not? I must know this before I can receive it;"-- this is
deemed disrespectful, and therefore presents are not declined.'</p>

<p>3. Wan Chang asked again, 'When one does not take on him in so many
express words to refuse the gift, but having declined it in his heart,
saying, "It was taken by him unrighteously from the people," and then
assigns some other reason for not receiving it;-- is not this a proper
course?' Mencius said, 'When the donor offers it on a ground of reason, and
his manner of doing so is according to propriety;-- in such a case
Confucius would have received it.'</p>

<p>4. Wan Chang said, 'Here now is one who stops and robs people outside
the gates of the city. He offers his gift on a ground of reason, and does
so in a manner according to propriety;-- would the reception of it so
acquired by robbery be proper?' Mencius replied, 'It would not be proper.
in "The Announcement to Kang" it is said, "When men kill others, and roll
over their bodies to take their property, being reckless and fearless of
death, among all the people there are none but detest them:"-- thus, such
characters are to be put to death, without waiting to give them warning.
Yin received this rule from Hsi&acirc; and Ch&acirc;u received it from Yin.
It cannot be questioned, and to the present day is clearly acknowledged.
How can the grift of a robber be received?'</p>

<p>5. Chang said, 'The princes of the present day take from their people
just as a robber despoils his victim. Yet if they put a good face of
propriety on their gifts, then the superior man receives them. I venture to
ask how you explain this.' Mencius answered, 'Do you think that, if there
should arise a truly royal sovereign, he would collect the princes of the
present day, and put them all to death? Or would he admonish them, and
then, on their not changing their ways, put them to death? Indeed, to call
every one who takes what does not properly belong to him a robber, is
pushing a point of resemblance to the utmost, and insisting on the most
refined idea of righteousness. When Confucius was in office in L&ucirc;,
the people struggled together for the game taken in hunting, and he also
did the same. If that struggling for the captured game was proper, how much
more may the gifts of the princes be received!'</p>

<p>6. Chang urged, 'Then are we to suppose that when Confucius held office, it
was not with the view to carry his doctrines into practice?' 'It was with
that view,' Mencius replied, and Chang rejoined, 'If the practice of his
doctrines was his business, what had he to do with that struggling for the
captured game?' Mencius said, 'Confucius first rectified his vessels of
sacrifice according to the registers, and did not fill them so rectified
with food gathered from every quarter.' 'But why did he not go away?' He
wished to make a trial of carrying his doctrines into practice. When
that trial was sufficient to show that they could be practised and
they were still not practised, then he went away, and thus it was
that he never completed in any State a residence of three years.</p>

<p>7. 'Confucius took office when he saw that the practice of his doctrines
was likely; he took office when his reception was proper; he took office
when he was supported by the State. In the case of his relation to
Ch&icirc; Hwan, he took office, seeing that the practice of his doctrines
was likely. With the duke Ling of Wei he took office, because his reception
was proper. With the duke Hsi&acirc;o of Wei he took office, because he was
maintained by the State.'</p>
