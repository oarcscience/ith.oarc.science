#### CHAPTER XI

<span class="small">THE FIVE PUNISHMENTS</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> criminal law consists principally of
five punishments, which are directed against three thousand offences. Of
them, disobedience to one's parents is considered the most heinous
crime.

To threaten the sovereign with force is an act which shows that the
wrongdoer does not know the duty of an inferior to a superior; to say
anything against the government founded by the wise men of many
generations gone by is an act which shows that the speaker does not know
what law is; and to say that a son need not be filial to his parents is
also an act which shows that the speaker does not know what is the
natural relation and duty between a son and parents. Such acts will no
doubt lead the man to a wrong course of life.
