#### No. XV

*He collected Mulberries to support his Mother*

During the Han dynasty lived Ts‘ai Shun, whose father died when he was
young, and who served his mother very dutifully. It happened that,
during the troubles of the time, when Wang Mang was plotting to usurp
the throne, there were years of scarcity, in which he could not procure
food, and Ts‘ai was compelled to gather mulberries, which he assorted,
putting them into two vessels. The red-eyebrowed robber <span

Ts‘ai replied: "The black and ripe berries I give to my mother, the
yellow and unripe ones I eat myself." The bandit admired his filial
affection, and rewarded him with three measures of white rice and the
leg of an ox.

Anxious and fearful, he seeks for food; untiring in his toil, he takes
up his baskets and penetrates the thickets of the distant forests, where
he finds many mulberry-trees. His hunger now has something to satisfy
its cravings; he also remembers his mother, and that he must carry some
to her. The ripe and unripe berries he does not put together, but
divides them, so that mother and son can each have their proper portion.
The chieftain heard of his conduct, and highly praised him, conferring a
gift upon him,

and speaking of his filial piety to all around. Taking up his rice and
flesh, Ts‘ai returned home to his mother with the food; and in their joy
they even forgot that the year was one of dearth.
