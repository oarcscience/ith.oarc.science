#### CHAPTER XVII

<span class="small">SERVING THE SOVEREIGN</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Confucius</span> said: "A good man always
endeavours, while he is in the service of his sovereign, to express the
utmost loyalty during audience with his August Master, and thinks at his
leisure how to repair any wrong his August Master may have done. He will
carry out any praiseworthy schemes projected by his master, and will
correct any fault which he may commit. In this way a great affection
will be fostered between them.

"Thus in the *Shih Ching* it is written: "Although the minister may be
far away from his master, yet his affection will not be affected by the
distance. He is so attached to him that he thinks of him every day."
