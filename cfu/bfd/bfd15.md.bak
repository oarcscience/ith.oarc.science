#### CHAPTER XII

<span class="small">AMPLIFICATION OF THE "IMPORTANT DOCTRINE"</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Confucius</span> said: "The best way to teach
the people to love their sovereign is for the sovereign

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

first to love his own parents; to teach them to be polite to each other
is for the sovereign himself first to be polite to all his elders; and
to improve bad manners and customs is for him first to pay attention to
the composition of the music played in the country.

"What is etiquette? It is simply due respect to one's elders. If I
respect the parents, the son will be pleased; if I respect the elder
brothers, the younger ones will be pleased; and if I respect the
sovereign, all the ministers will be pleased. I respect only one person,
but I please thousands upon thousands. Those to whom the respect is paid
are few, and those whom I please are many. This is what is called "an
important doctrine."
