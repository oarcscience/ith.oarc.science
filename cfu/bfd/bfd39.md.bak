#### No. XVIII

*He wept to the Bamboos, and Shoots sprang up*

Mêng Tsung, who lived in the Chin dynasty, lost his father when young.
His mother was very ill, and one winter's day she longed to taste a soup
made of bamboo shoots, but Mêng could not procure any. At last he went
into the bamboo grove, and, clasping the bamboos with his hands, wept
bitterly. His filial love moved Nature, and the ground slowly opened,
sending forth several shoots, which he gathered and carried home. He

made a soup of them, which his mother tasted, and immediately recovered
from her malady.

In winter, when the forests are unsightly and bare, and the bamboos
sombre and gloomy, for plants to send forth their branches is surprising
and unexpected. But it is impossible to root out the true filial nature
from men who have it, although senseless and ignorant people, not
understanding its power, ridicule them, calling them mad. The young Mêng
Tsung dutifully served his mother, and morning and evening waited on her
to receive her commands. His mother was ill, and desired the delicacy of
a soup made from bamboo shoots; but in dreary winter, Nature still
concealed her fruits awaited. With anxious haste he goes to the
cheerless forest, which he enters, seeking for them; but not finding the
shoots, he entreats the bamboos with tears. One petition from his inmost
heart ascended to the threshold of heaven, and the deities were
delighted, laughing with pleasure. A miracle is wrought, the ordinary
course of nature is reversed, and suddenly the pearly shoots appear in
the forest.
