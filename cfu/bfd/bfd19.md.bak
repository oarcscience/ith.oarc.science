#### CHAPTER XVI

<span class="small">THE INFLUENCE AND FRUIT OF FILIAL PIETY</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> good Emperors of old were not only
filial to their parents, but also to the Supreme Father and Mother—that
is, Heaven and the Earth. When an Emperor can live in harmony with his
elders, there will be harmony throughout his dominion between superiors
and inferiors; and when he is filial to the Supreme Father and Mother,
he will be blessed by them.

Although the Emperor is the highest of all ranks, yet he still has some
one to respect. He has his father and elder brothers.

Why do we offer sacrifices to our ancestors in our family shrine?
Because we ought not to forget them. Why must we cultivate our minds and
be circumspect in our actions? Because we do not wish to bring disgrace
upon the name of our ancestors. If we can show respect to them when we
offer them sacrifices in our family shrine, we shall be blessed by the
Supreme Father and Mother. Filiality to parents and reverence to elders
will be known to the Supreme Being, and will be followed by the people
in every part of the world; no place can remain unaffected by their
influence. In the *Shih Ching* it is said that "from east to west and
from north to south there is no one who does not submit to rule."
