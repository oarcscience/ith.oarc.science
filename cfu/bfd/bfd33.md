#### No. XII

*He carved Wood and served his Parents*

During the Han dynasty lived Ting Lan, whose parents both died when he
was young, before he could obey and support them; and he reflected that
for all the trouble and anxiety he had caused them, no recompense had
yet been given. He then carved wooden images of his parents, and served
them as if they had been alive. For a long time his wife would not
reverence them; and one day, taking a bodkin, she pricked their fingers
in derision. Blood flowed immediately from the wound; and seeing Ting
coming, the images wept. He inquired into the circumstances, and
forthwith divorced his wife.

He remembers his parents, but cannot see them; so he carves wood to
represent their persons. He believes that their spirits are now the same
as when they were alive, and his quietless

heart trusts that their spirits have entered the carved images. He
cannot rest until he has made their statues, so strong is his desire to
nourish and reverence them. He now reveres them, although dead, as if
they were alive; and hopes they will condescend to dwell in his
ancestral hall.
