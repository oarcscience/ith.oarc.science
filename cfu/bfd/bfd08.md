#### CHAPTER V

<span class="small">THE FILIAL DUTY OF THE LITERARY CLASS</span>

<span class="smallcaps">From</span> the manner in which we should treat
our father we learn how to treat our mother. The love toward them is the
same. From the manner in which we should treat our father we also learn
how to serve our August Master. The respect shown to them is the same.
To our mother we show love, to our August Master respect, while to our
father, both love and respect. If we can serve our August Master with
such feelings as we have toward our father, then loyalty is shown; and
if we treat venerable persons with respect, then harmony will reign in
the circle of our life. Not failing to treat the August Master with
loyalty and the venerable with respect, we shall be able to make
ourselves secure in our high position and to offer sacrifices to our
ancestors for ever.

This is the filial duty of the Literati. So in the *Shih Ching* it is
written: "Do not do anything in the course of a day which will reflect
dishonour upon your ancestors."
