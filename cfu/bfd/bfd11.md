#### CHAPTER VIII

<span class="small">FILIAL DUTY IN GOVERNMENT</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> good Emperors of old ruled the Empire
by means of filial duty, and dared not neglect the ministers of their
vassal states. How much less

the dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts, and barons! They thereby gained
the goodwill of all their vassal states, which sent their deputies to
represent them in any sacrifice offered to the ancestors of their
Supreme Master. This is what we mean by saying that the good Emperors of
old governed the world by filial duty.

As to the vassal states, their rulers dared not treat widowers and
widows with insolence; how then could they dare act so towards the
literary class and the people? Hence they gained the good-will of their
subjects, and the latter would join them in offering sacrifices to their
ancestors.

Now we may say a word about a family. If the head of a family do not act
haughtily towards his servant, he cannot act so to his wife and
children. Hence he will gain the goodwill of all his people, and they
will help him in the fulfilment of his filial duty. In such a family the
parents must feel happy when they are living, and their spirits must
come to enjoy the sacrifice when they are dead. By the principle of
filial duty the whole world can be made happy and all calamities and
dangers can be averted. Such was the government of the Empire by the
enlightened rulers of old, in accordance with the principle of filial
duty.

In the *Shih Ching* it is thus written: "If you adorn yourself with the
highest virtue, the whole world will follow you."
