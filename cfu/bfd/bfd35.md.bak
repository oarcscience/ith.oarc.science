#### No. XIV

*He seized the Tiger and saved his Father*

In the Han dynasty lived Yang Hsiang, a lad of fourteen, who was in the
habit of following his father to the fields to cut grain. Once a tiger
seized his father, and was slowly carrying him off, when Yang, anxious
for his father and forgetting

himself, although he had no iron weapon in his hand, rushed forward and
seized the tiger by the neck. The beast let the prey fall from his
teeth, and fled, and Yang's father was thus saved from injury and death.

A tiger suddenly appears in the borders of the field, and seizes the man
as lightly as he catches a sheep, and drags him off. Yang Hsiang, seeing
the sudden peril of his father, was vexed that he had no weapon with an
iron head; but being strongly excited and his feelings roused, he ran
forward in the path, crying with a loud voice, and grasped the tiger by
the neck. The frightened animal fled, nor stopped in its rapid course
until it reached the high hills. Yang then, in a gentle manner, raised
his father up and led him home, endeavouring to soothe his mind and
dispel his fears, and also presented him the golden wine-cup. Among the
great number of sages whose reputations are famous, how few of them have
been devoted and filial at the hazard of their lives! But this lad,
quite young and fair, as soon as he saw his father's danger, risked his
own life; surely his fame will spread throughout the country. We have
heard of the lady T‘i Ying, who saved her father from banishment, and of
young Chu O, who lost her life in trying to rescue her father from
drowning; and I think that Yang Hsiang will form a trio with them, and
the three be celebrated in the same ode.
