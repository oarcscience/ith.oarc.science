#### No. V

*With Sports and Embroidered Robes he amused his Parents*

In the Chou dynasty there flourished Lao Lai Tzŭ, who was very obedient
and reverent towards his parents, manifesting his dutifulness by
exerting himself to provide them with every delicacy. Although upwards
of seventy years of age, he declared that he was not yet too old, and,
dressed in gaudy-coloured garments, would frisk and cut capers like a
child in front of his parents. He would also take up buckets of water
and try to carry them into the house; but, feigning to slip, would fall
to the ground, wailing and crying like a child; and all these things he
did in order to divert his parents.

In the country of Ch‘u lived Lao Lai Tzŭ, who, when so old that he had
lost nearly all his teeth, made every effort to rejoice and comfort his
parents, constantly endeavouring to gladden their hearts. At times he
imitated the playfulness of

a little child, and arraying himself in gaudy and variegated clothes,
amused them by his strutting and gambols. He would likewise purposely
fall on the ground, kicking and wailing to the utmost of his power. His
mother was delighted, and manifested her joy in her countenance. Thus
did Lai forget his age in order to rejoice the hearts of his parents;
and affection, harmony, and joy prevailed among the family. If this
ardent love for his parents had been insincere and constrained, how
could it be referred to as worthy of imitation?
