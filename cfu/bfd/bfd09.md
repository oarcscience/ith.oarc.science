*The Book of Filial Duty*, by Ivan Chen, \[1908\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### CHAPTER VI

<span class="small">THE FILIAL DUTY OF COMMON PEOPLE</span>

<span class="smallcaps">To</span> do the necessary in every season (such
as growing crops in spring and reaping harvest in autumn), to do the
utmost to make lands as fertile as possible, and to be frugal in their
expense, in order to keep their parents in comfort, is the filial duty
of the common people.

From the Emperor downwards to the common people, every one has the same
duty imposed upon him, and there is no instance in which we can find
that a man cannot fulfil this duty.
