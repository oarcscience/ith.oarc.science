#### CHAPTER XIV

<span class="small">AMPLIFICATION OF "RAISING THE REPUTATION"</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Confucius</span> said: "A true gentleman is
always filial to his parents, and in order to fulfil his duty to them to
the fullest extent, he also serves his August Master with patriotism. He
always shows reverence to his elder brothers, and in order to fulfil his
duty to them to the fullest extent, he does the same towards every one
who is older than he.

"As he can maintain order in his family affairs, so he can do the same
in the government. He bases the principle of the government of a State
upon that of a ruling family, and the consequent success will make his
name to be remembered throughout generations to come."
