#### CHAPTER IX

<span class="small">GOVERNMENT BY THE SAGE</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Tsêng Tzŭ</span> asked: "Is filial piety the
highest of all the virtues possessed by a great sage?" To this Confucius
replied: "There is nothing so great in the world as man, and there is
nothing so great in a man as filial piety. The first duty of a son is to
venerate his parent, and in order to show reverence for his dead father
he has to offer him sacrifice when he offers sacrifices to Heaven. A man
who had done this was the Duke of Chou. When he offered sacrifices to
Heaven in a suburban district, he also offered a sacrifice to his
deceased ancestor Hou Chi, and when he offered sacrifice to Heaven at
the temple named Ming Tang, he also made one to his deceased father Wên
Wang. His good action produced such an effect that all the feudal barons
at that time came to assist him in performing the ceremony of offering
sacrifice to Heaven. It is therefore evident that there is nothing so
great in human nature as filial piety. The feeling of affection is
fostered during the time of infancy, and from that affection springs
reverence. Since every man has a natural reverence, the great sages of
the time teach him how and when to show it; and since he has a natural
feeling of affection, they teach him when and how to cultivate it. As
the teachings of these sages are based on the principle of filial

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

piety, their doctrine is propagated without effort, and their government
is effectual without resorting to force. The affection between a father
and a son is natural, and also a source from which springs the reverence
which a minister ought to show to his sovereign. When parents have a son
born to them, the regular line of descent in the family is thereby
secured. This is the greatest duty in family life. We must treat our
parents with the same reverence as is shown to our sovereign, because we
receive boundless kindness from them and are under a natural obligation
to do so. If any one does not love his parents, but others, he is a
rebel against virtue; and if any one does not respect his parents, but
others, he is also a rebel against the standard of rites. Any action
which is against the law of nature will certainly not be an example for
the public; and any one who gets a high position, such as that of a
ruler, by undue influence instead of by good actions, will be despised
by good men. As to the latter, they say what they ought to say, and do
what they think is good for the public. Their virtue and justice are
estimable, their actions are worthy of being followed, their behaviour
is creditable, and their manner is correct in every way. If such persons
are rulers of a state, they will afford to the people a good example to
follow and will also inspire them with reverence and affection. This is
principally the cause of their being successful

in propagating their doctrines, and in effectually carrying on their
government. Do you not remember what is said in the *Shih Ching?*—Look
at that good man. How correct his behaviour is!"
