#### CHAPTER IV

<span class="small">THE FILIAL DUTY OF HIGH OFFICERS</span>

<span class="smallcaps">If</span> we do not put on such dress as our
good Emperors of old would forbid, if we do not speak such words as they
would forbid, and if we do not behave ourselves in such a way as they
would forbid, then we shall be always right in what we say and what we
do. If so, then nobody

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

will be able to find fault with our words or with our deeds, and
therefore we shall be able to keep our family from being visited with
any serious misfortune, and to offer sacrifices to our ancestors for
ever. This is the filial duty of a high officer.

In the *Shih Ching* it is thus written: "Be diligent every minute to
attend upon the one person " (meaning the Emperor).
