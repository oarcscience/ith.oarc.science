*He carried Rice for his Parents*

In the Chou dynasty lived Chung Yu, also a disciple of Confucius, who,

also went more than a hundred li to procure rice for his parents.
Afterwards, when they were dead, he went south to the country of Ch‘u,
where he was made commander of a hundred companies of chariots. There he
became rich, storing up grain in myriads of measures, reclining upon
cushions, and eating food served to him in numerous dishes; but,
sighing, he said: "Although I should now desire to eat coarse herbs and
bring rice for my parents, it cannot be!"

"Alas!" said Chung Yu, "although I was a scholar, yet my parents were
poor; and how was I to nourish them?" Exhausted he travelled the long
road and cheerfully brought rice for his parents. Pleasantly he endured
the toil, and exerted his utmost strength without any commendation. At
that time his lot in life was hard and unfortunate, and he little
expected the

official honours he afterwards enjoyed. But when his parents were dead,
and he had become rich and honourable, enjoying all the luxuries of
life, then he was unhappy and discontented; not cheerful as in the days
of his poverty, nor happy as when he ministered to his parents' wants.
