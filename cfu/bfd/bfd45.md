#### No. XXIV

*He watched by his Mother's Bedside*

In the Yüan-yu period of the Sung dynasty, Huang T‘ing-chien filled the
office of prefect.

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He was of a very
filial disposition, and although honourable and renowned, yet he
received his mother's commands with the utmost deference. When his
mother was seized with illness, he watched her for a whole year without
leaving her bedside or even taking off his clothes; and at her death he
mourned so bitterly that he himself fell ill and nearly lost his life.

Well-written poetry flows along like rills meandering among the hills
and valleys. This instance of a dutiful heart has not as yet been
brought into much notice. For a whole year he tended his parent in her
illness; and both she who dwelt in the curtained room (*i.e.* his
mother) and he who remained in the hall (*i.e.* his father) strove to
express the merits of their son. It would be difficult to find another
child who would have done so—all would be dilatory and unwilling; and
where shall we meet another who would undergo such drudgery himself with
keenness and pleasure? Although raised to high office, he does not
hesitate to perform the most troublesome and minute duties, for he loves
his parents; how then can we suppose that he will change from what he
was when young and unhonoured?
