*All literary communications to be addressed to the Editors of*

THE ORIENT LIBRARY, c/o DR. S. A. KAPADIA, ORIENTAL  
SECRETARY, NORTHBROOK SOCIETY, 185 PICCADILLY, LONDON, W.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> object of the Editors of this Series
is a very definite one. They desire above all things that, in their
humble way, these books shall be the ambassadors of good-will and
understanding between East and West, the old world of Thought and the
new of Action. In this endeavour, and in their own sphere, they are but
followers of the highest example in the land. They are confident that a
deeper knowledge of the great ideals and lofty philosophy of Oriental
thought may help to a revival of that true spirit of Charity which
neither despises nor fears the nations of another creed and colour.
Finally, in thanking press and public for the very cordial reception
given to the "Wisdom of the East" Series, they wish to state that no
pains have been spared to secure the best specialists for the treatment
of the various subjects at hand.

#### SOME OPINIONS OF THE PRESS

dreamy, lifelike, and fascinating."

**Pall Mall Gazette.**—"No translation of this important work has been
made since the beginning of the eighteenth century."

**Manchester Courier.**—"Worthy of close study by all who would
penetrate to the depth of Eastern thought and feeling."

**Literary Guide.**—"We wish success to this little series of books."

**Outlook.**—"This Series is published to help in the process of
renewing the spiritual and moral life of the West."

**The Scotsman.**—"This Series should not fail to please readers of the

**Glasgow Herald.**—"This new Series has a definite and lofty aim, and
is deserving of support. The books are small, cheap, and well adapted

far-off age and people, and have a great interest for the student of
literature."
