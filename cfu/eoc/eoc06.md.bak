# The Ethics of Confucius

### CHAPTER I

#### WHAT CONSTITUTES THE SUPERIOR MAN

THE central idea of Confucius is that every normal human being cherishes
the aspiration to become a superior man—superior to his fellows, if
possible, but surely superior to his own past and present self. This
does not more than hint at perfection as a goal; and it is said of him
that one of the subjects concerning which the Master rarely spoke, was
"perfect virtue." (Analects, bk. ix., c. i.) He also said, "They who
know virtue, are few" (Analects, bk. xv., c. iii.), and was far from
teaching a perfectionist doctrine. It refers rather to the perpetually
relative, the condition of being superior to that to which one may be
superior, be it high or low,—that hopeful possibility which has ever
lured mankind toward higher things.

This accords well with the ameliorating and progressive principle of
evolution which in these days offers a substantial reward, both for a
man

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

and for his progeny, if he will but cultivate higher and more useful
traits and qualities. The aim to excel, if respected of all, approved
and accepted by common consent, would appeal to every child and,
logically presented to its mind and enforced by universal recognition of
its validity, would become a conviction and a scheme for the art of
living, of transforming power and compelling vigour.

In various sayings Confucius, his disciples, and Mencius present the
attributes of the superior man, whom the sage adjures his disciples to
admire without ceasing, to emulate without turning, and to imitate
without let or hindrance. These are some of them:

*Purpose:* "The superior man learns in order to attain to the utmost of
his principles." (Analects, bk. xix., c. vii.)

*Poise:* "The superior man in his thought does not go out of his place."
(Analects, bk. xiv., c. xxviii.)

*Self-sufficiency:* "What the superior man seeks, is in himself; what
the ordinary <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) man seeks, is in others."
(Analects, bk. xv., c. xx.)

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

*Earnestness:* "The superior man in everything puts forth his utmost
endeavours." (Great Learning, ii., 4.)

*Thoroughness:* "The superior man bends his attention to what is
radical. That being established, all practical courses naturally grow
up." (Analects, bk. i., c. ii., v. 2.)

*Sincerity:* "The superior man must make his thoughts sincere." (Great
Learning, vi., 4.) " Is it not his absolute sincerity which
distinguishes a superior man?" (Doctrine of the Mean, c. xiii., 4.)

*Truthfulness:* "What the superior man requires is that in what he says
there may be nothing inaccurate." (Analects, bk. xiii., c. iii., v. 7.)

*Purity of thought and action:* "The superior man must be watchful over
himself when alone." (Great Learning, vi., 2.)

*Love of truth:* "The object of the superior man is truth." (Analects,
bk. xv., c. xxxi.) "The superior man is anxious lest he should not get
truth; he is not anxious lest poverty come upon him." (Analects, bk.
xv., c. xxxi.)

*Mental hospitality:* "The superior man is catholic and not partisan;
the ordinary man is partisan and not catholic." (Analects, bk. ii., c.
xiv.) " The superior man in the world does not set his mind either for
anything or against anything; what is right, he will follow." (Analects,
bk. iv., c. x.)

*Rectitude:* "The superior man thinks of virtue; the ordinary man thinks
of comfort." (Analects,

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

bk. iv., c. xi.) " The mind of the superior man is conversant with
righteousness; the mind of the ordinary man is conversant with gain."
(Analects, bk. iv., c. xxi.) " The superior man in all things considers
righteousness essential." (Analects, bk. xv., c. xvii.)

*Prudence:* "The superior man wishes to be slow in his words and earnest
in his conduct." (Analects, bk. iv., c. xxiv.)

*Composure:* "The superior man is satisfied and composed; the ordinary
man is always full of distress." (Analects, bk. vii., c. xxxvi.) "The
superior man may indeed have to endure want; but the ordinary man, when
he is in want, gives way to unbridled license." (Analects, bk. xv., c.
i., v. 3.)

*Fearlessness:* "The superior man has neither anxiety nor fear."
(Analects, bk. xii., c. iv., v. i.) "When internal examination discovers
nothing wrong, what is there to be anxious about, what is there to
fear?" (Analects, bk. xi., c. iv., v. 3.) " They sought to act
virtuously and they did so; and what was there for them to repine
about?" (Analects, bk. vii., c. xiv., v. 2.)

*Ease and dignity:* "The superior man has dignified ease without pride;
the ordinary man has pride without dignified ease." (Analects, bk.
xiii., c. xxvi.) "The superior man is dignified and does not wrangle."
(Analects, bk. xv., c. xxi.)

*Firmness:* "Refusing to surrender their wills

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

or to submit to any taint to their persons." (Analects, bk. xviii., c.
viii., v. 2.) "The superior man is correctly firm and not merely firm."
(Analects, bk. xv., c. xxxvi.) "Looked at from a distance, he appears
stern; when approached, he is mild; when he is heard to speak, his
language is firm and decided." (Analects, bk. xix., c. ix.)

*Lowliness:* "The superior man is affable but not adulatory; the
ordinary man is adulatory but not affable." (Analects, bk. xiii., c.
xxiii.)

*Avoidance of sycophancy:* "I have heard that the superior man helps the
distressed, but he does not add to the wealth of the rich." (Analects,
bk. vi., c. iii., v. 2.)

*Growth:* "The progress of the superior man is upward, the progress of
the ordinary man is downward." (Analects, bk. xiv., c. xxiv.) "The
superior man is distressed by his want of ability; he is not distressed
by men's not knowing him." (Analects, bk. xv., c. xviii.)

*Capacity:* "The superior man cannot be known in little matters but may
be entrusted with great concerns." (Analects, bk. xv., c. xxxiii.)

*Openness:* "The faults of the superior man are like the sun and moon.
He has his faults and all men see them. He changes again and all men low
look up to him." (Analects, bk. xix., c. xxi.)

*Benevolence:* "The superior man seeks to develop the admirable
qualities of men and does not seek to develop their evil qualities. The
ordinary

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

man does the opposite of this." (Analects, bk. xii., c. xvi.)

*Broadmindedness:* "The superior man honours talent and virtue and bears
with all. He praises the good and pities the incompetent." (Analects,
bk. xix., c. iii.) "The superior man does not promote a man on account
of his words, nor does he put aside good words on account of the man."
(Analects, bk. xv., c. xxii.)

*Charity:* "To be able to judge others by what is in ourselves, this may
be called the art of virtue." (Analects, bk. vi., c. xxviii., v. 3.)

*Moderation:* "The superior man conforms with the path of the mean."
(Doctrine of the Mean, c. xi., vi. 3.)

*The Golden Rule:* "When Gm cultivates to the utmost the capabilities of
his nature and exercises them on the principle of reciprocity, he is not
far from the path. What you do not want done to yourself, do not do unto
others." (Doctrine of the Mean, c. xiii., v. 3.)

*Reserve power:* "That wherein the superior man cannot be equalled is
simply this, his work which other men cannot see." (Doctrine of the
Mean, c. xxxiii., v. 2.)

 

**The Art of Living.** " The practice of right-living is deemed the
highest, the practice of any other art lower. Complete virtue takes
first place; the doing of anything else whatsoever is subordinate." (Li
Ki, bk. xvii., sect. iii., 5.)

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

These words from the "Li Ki" are the keynote of the sage's teachings.

Confucius sets before every man, as what he should strive for, his own
improvement, the development of himself,—a task without surcease, until
he shall "abide in the highest excellence." This goal, albeit
unattainable in the absolute, he must ever have before his vision,
determined above all things to attain it, relatively, every moment of
his life—that is, to "abide in the highest excellence" of which he is at
the moment capable. So he says in "The Great Learning": "What one should
abide in being known, what should be aimed at is determined; upon this
decision, unperturbed resolve is attained; to this succeeds tranquil
poise; this affords opportunity for deliberate care; through such
deliberation the goal is achieved." (Text, v. 2.)

This speaks throughout of self-development, of that renunciation of
worldly lusts which inspired the cry: "For what shall it profit a man if
he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?"; but this is not
left doubtful—for again in "The Great Learning" he says: "From the
highest to the lowest, self-development must be deemed the root of all,
by every man. When the root is neglected, it cannot be that what springs
from it will be well-ordered." (Text, v. 6, 7.)

Confucius taught that to pursue the art of life was possible for every
man, all being of like passions and in more things like than different.
He

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

says: "By nature men are nearly alike; by practice, they get to be wide
apart." (Analects, bk. xvii., c. ii.)

Mencius put forward this idea continually, never more succinctly and
aptly than in this: "All things are already complete in us." (Bk. vii.,
pt. i., c. iv., 1.)

Mencius also announced that the advance of every man is independent of
the power of others, as follows: "To advance a man or to stop his
advance is beyond the power of other men." (Bk. i., pt. ii., c. xvi.,
3.)

It has already in these pages been quoted from the "Analects" that "the
superior man learns in order to attain to the utmost of his principles."

In the same book is reported this colloquy: "Tsze-loo asked 'What
constitutes the superior man?' The Master said, 'The cultivation of
himself with reverential care'" (Analects, bk. xiv., c. xlv.); and in
the " Doctrine of the Mean," "When one cultivates to the utmost the
capabilities of his nature and exercises them on the principle of
reciprocity, he is not far from the path." (C. xiii., 3.).

In "The Great Learning," Confucius revealed the process, step by step,
by which self-development is attained and by which it flows over into
the common life to serve the state and to bless mankind.

"The ancients," he said, "when they wished to exemplify illustrious
virtue throughout the empire,

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

first ordered well their states. Desiring to order well their states,
they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate their families,
they first cultivated themselves. Wishing to cultivate themselves, they
first rectified their purposes. Wishing to rectify their purposes, they
first sought to think sincerely. Wishing to think sincerely, they first
extended their knowledge as widely as possible. This they did by
investigation of things.

"By investigation of things, their knowledge became extensive; their
knowledge being extensive, their thoughts became sincere; their thoughts
being sincere, their purposes were rectified; their purposes being
rectified, they cultivated themselves; they being cultivated, their
families were regulated; their families being regulated, their states
were rightly governed; their states being rightly governed, the empire
was thereby tranquil and prosperous." (Text, 4, 5.)

Lest there be misunderstanding, it should be said that mere wealth is
not to be considered the prosperity of which he speaks, but rather
plenty and right-living. For there is the saying: "In a state, gain is
not to be considered prosperity, but prosperity is found in
righteousness." (Great Learning, x., 23.) The distribution of wealth
into mere livelihoods among the people is urged by Confucius as an
essential to good government, for it is said in "The Great Learning":
"The concentration of wealth is the way to disperse

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

the people, distributing it among them is the way to collect the
people." (X., 9.)

The order of development, therefore, Confucius set forth as follows:

Investigation of phenomena.

Learning.

Sincerity.

Rectitude of purpose.

Self-development.

Family discipline.

Local self-government.

Universal self-government.

The rules of conduct, mental, spiritual, in one's inner life, in the
family, in the state, and in society at large, which will lead to this
self-development and beyond it, Confucius conceived to be of universal
application, for it is said in the "Doctrine of the Mean" (c. xxviii.,
v. 3): "Now throughout the empire carriages all have wheels with the
same tread, all writing is with the same characters, and for conduct
there are the same rules."

How this may be, is set forth in the same book (c. xii., v. 1, 2): "The
path which the superior man follows extends far and wide, and yet is
secret. Ordinary men and women, however ignorant, may meddle with the
knowledge of it; yet, in its utmost reaches, there is that which even
the sage does not discern. Ordinary men and women, however below the
average standard of ability, can carry it into practice; yet, in its
utmost reaches,

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

there is that which even the sage is not able to carry into practice."

It is, indeed, a true art of living which is thus presented, a scheme of
adaptation of means to ends, of causes to produce their appropriate
consequences, with clear and noble purposes in view, both as regards
one's own development and man's, both as regards one's own weal and the
common weal.

For the completion of its work, it requires, also, the whole of life,
every deflection from virtue marring by so much the perfection of the
whole. Its saintliness lies not in purity alone, but in the rounded
fulness of the well-planned and well-spent life, the more a thing of
beauty if extended to extreme old age. Confucius thus modestly hints how
slowly it develops at best, when he says: "At fifteen I had my mind bent
on learning. At thirty I stood firm. At forty I was free from doubt. At
fifty I knew the decrees of Heaven. At sixty my ear was an obedient
organ for the reception of truth. At seventy I could follow what my
heart desired without transgressing what was right." (Analects, bk. ii.,
c. iv.)

That it is not finished until death rings down the curtain upon the last
act, is shown in the "Analects" by this aphorism attributed to his
disciple, Tsang: "The scholar may not be without breadth of mind and
vigorous endurance. His burden is heavy and his course is long. Perfect
virtue is the burden which he considers it his to

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

sustain; is it not heavy? Only with death does his course stop; is it
not long?" (Analects, bk. viii., c. vii.)

**Mental Morality.** "When you know a thing, to hold that you know it,
and when you do not know a thing, to acknowledge that you do not know
it—this is knowledge." (Analects, bk. ii., c. xvii.)

In these words Confucius set forth more lucidly than any other thinker,
ancient or modern, the essential of all morality, mental honesty,
integrity of the mind—the only attitude which does not close the door to
truth.

The same thing is put forward in a different way in the "Li Ki," thus:
"Do not positively affirm when you have doubts; and when you have not,
do not put forth what you say, as merely your view." (Bk. i., sect. i.,
pt. i., c. iii., 5.)

The Chinese sage had no delusions about the real nature of the art of
living, the rules of human conduct; he knew and understood that ethics
are of the mind, that sticks and stones are neither moral nor immoral
but merely unmoral, and that the possibilities of good and evil choices
come only when the intelligence dawns which alone can choose between
them.

Mencius considerably extended this view, starting from the position: "If
men do what is not good, the blame cannot be imputed to their natural
powers." (Bk. xi., pt. i., c. vi., v. 6.)

Not that he did not recognize the perils of unrestrained

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

animal passions, ministered to, instead of guided and controlled by, a
human mind which accordingly becomes their slave instead of master; for
he says: "That whereby man differs from the lower animals is little.
Most people throw it away, the superior man preserves it." (Bk. iv., pt.
ii., c. xix., v. 1.)

And again he refers to this inexcusable reversal of the natural order,
thus: "When a man's finger is deformed, he knows enough to be
dissatisfied; but if his mind be deformed, he does not know that he
should be dissatisfied. This is called: 'Ignorance of the relative
importance of things.'" (Bk. vi., pt. i., c. xii., v. 2.)

The "Li Ki" says of this, more explicitly: "It belongs to the nature of
man, as from Heaven, to be still at his birth. His activity shows itself
as he is acted on by external things, and develops the desires incident
to his nature. Things come to him more and more, and his knowledge is
increased. Then arise the manifestations of liking and disliking. When
these are not regulated by anything within, and growing knowledge leads
more astray without, he cannot come back to himself, and his Heavenly
principle is extinguished.

"Now there is no end of the things by which man is affected; and when
his likings and dislikings are not subject to regulation (from within),
he is changed into the nature of things as they come before him; that
is, he stifles the voice of Heavenly principle within, and gives the
utmost indulgence

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

to the desires by which men may be possessed. On this we have the
rebellious and deceitful heart, with licentious and violent disorder."
(Bk. xvii., sect. i., v. 11, 12.)

Therefore, with acumen and discernment never excelled, Confucius divined
that the mind must first be honest with itself. This indicates the
essential immorality of the mind which clings to that which it does not
know, with fervency and loyalty more devoted than that with which it
holds to that which it does know. That one should not be swayed by what
he prefers to believe, is again asserted in these words of the
"Shu-King," ascribed to I Yin (pt. iv., bk. v., sect. iii., v. 2.):

"When you hear words that are distasteful to your mind, you must inquire
whether they be not right; when you hear words that accord with your own
views, you must inquire whether they be not contrary to right."

It is consonant with the spirit and teaching of Confucius that the
philosopher Ch‘ing should have said of the "Doctrine of the Mean": "This
work contains the law of the mind which was handed down from one to
another"; and that Confucius himself has said: "In the Book of Poetry
are three hundred pieces, but the design of them all may be embraced in
one sentence: Have no depraved thoughts.'" (Analects, bk. ii., c. ii.)

It was thus that Confucius conceived the art of living, as a thing
thought out, a response purposive, instead of automatic, to every
impulse from

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

without. He says of himself, meaning thereby to instruct his disciples
and inspire them to emulation: "I have no course for which I am
predetermined and no course against which I am predetermined."
(Analects, bk. xviii., c. viii., v. 5.)

And, as already quoted, these are among his most striking attributes of
the superior man: "The superior man is catholic and not partisan; the
ordinary man is partisan and not catholic." (Analects, bk. ii., c. xiv.)
"The superior man in the world does not set his mind either for anything
or against anything; what is right, he will follow." (Analects, bk. iv.,
c. x.) "The superior man is anxious lest he should not get truth; he is
not anxious lest poverty should come upon him." (Analects, bk. xv., c.
xxxi.)

In yet more glowing and enthusiastic terms he sang the praises of the
open mind, its need, its utility, its essential beauty and sure promise,
saying: "They who know the truth are not equal to them that love it, and
they who love it are not equal to them that find pleasure in it."
(Analects, bk. vi., c. xviii.)

Socrates said something akin to this when he rebuked the "sophists,"
*i.e.*, the "wise," and modestly called himself "philosophos," *i.e.*,
only a lover of wisdom and one who devoutly wishes to learn.

Confucius sets before his disciples the apprehension and ascertainment
of the bald truth

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

concerning the phenomena of nature, as the thing first to be desired;
for he says: "The object of the superior man is truth." (Analects, bk.
xv., c. xxxi.)

Of himself, his disciples present this portrayal: "There were four
things from which the Master was entirely free: He had no foregone
conclusions, no arbitrary predeterminations, no obstinacy, and no
egoism." (Analects, bk. ix., c. iv.)

**The Investigation of Phenomena.** "Wishing to think sincerely, they
first extended their knowledge. This they did by investigation of
things. By investigation of things, their knowledge became extensive.
Their knowledge being extensive, their thoughts became sincere."

These words from "The Great Learning" (Text, v. 4, 5) are meant to show
how the mind, holding itself in resolution, its conclusions ready to
take whatever form the compelling logic of the ascertained facts may
require, must, as an essential prerequisite of a normal and well-rounded
life, investigate the phenomena which are around it. These are its
world, with which it must cope, and which, in order that it may cope
therewith, it must also understand. Confucius says: "To this
attainment"—*i.e.*, perfect sincerity—"there are requisite extensive
study of what is good, accurate inquiry into it, careful consideration
of it, clear distinguishing about it, and earnest practical application
of it." (Doctrine of the Mean, c. xx., v. 19.)

That there must be this ardent spirit of inquiry,

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

this insatiable thirst after knowledge, or the man is lost, is indicated
by Confucius in many sayings. One of the aptest of these is: "When a man
says not, 'What shall I think of this? What shall I think of this?', I
can indeed do nothing with him." (Analects, bk. xv., c. xv.)

On another occasion he announced: "I do not reveal the truth to one who
is not eager to get knowledge, nor assist any one who is not himself
anxious to explain." (Analects, bk. vii., c. viii.)

The apprehension that effect follows cause, was rightly regarded by him
the first office of the human mind and the primary moral act of an
intelligent being. This was made the foundation of "The Great Learning"
(Text, v. 3): "Things have their root and their fruition. Affairs have
their end and their beginning. To know what goes first and what comes
after, is near to what is taught in the Great Learning."

As the followers of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle soon lost the real
point of view of the great lover of wisdom, by reason of their devotion
to what they understood to be the positive teaching of himself and his
disciples, and built up a system of prescriptive and authoritative
learning which in fact stifled original investigation of phenomena,
while encouraging mere speculation and dialectics, so in like manner the
investigation of phenomena, enjoined by Confucius, soon degenerated into
scholasticism, and the mere conning and memorizing of texts. The neglect
of the true significance

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

of his injunction was so complete that, though apparently no other
sentences are missing, the chapter of "The Great Learning" in which was
given the early author's version of what is meant by "investigation of
things" is lost. Only these words are still extant: "This is called
knowing the root. This is called the perfecting of knowledge."

Views, ascribed to the commentator Ch‘ing, are usually supplied to fill
this hiatus. They are here quoted to show how the true function of
investigation, which is not the duty merely of the young and untutored
mind but yet more the duty of the trained and experienced, was distorted
into something altogether contrary, by passing through the intellect of
the adoring scholiast: "The meaning of the expression, 'The perfecting
of knowledge depends upon the investigation of things' is this: If we
wish to carry our knowledge to the utmost, we must investigate the
principles of all things we come into contact with; for the intelligent
mind of man is certainly formed to know and there is not a single thing
of which its principles are not a part. But so long as all principles
are not investigated, man's knowledge is incomplete. On this account,
the 'Learning for Adults,' in its opening chapters, instructs the
learner in regard to all things in the world, to proceed from what
knowledge he has of their principles and pursue his investigations of
them until he reaches the extreme point. After exerting himself in this
way for a long time, he will

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

suddenly find himself possessed of a wide and far-reaching penetration.
Then the qualities of all things, whether external or internal, subtle
or coarse, will be apprehended and the mind, in its whole substance and
its relations to things, will be perfectly intelligent. This is called
the investigation of things, this is called the perfection of
knowledge."

But, while it may have been, and indeed was, called "the investigation
of things," by Ch‘ing and by many of the scholiasts since his day, it is
obviously far from that enduring open-mindedness and spirit of impartial
inquiry which Confucius held to be the first essential to the art of
living. The words of Confucius, therefore, have clearer and higher
significance in this scientific age than in all the centuries during
which Asiatic students have memorized them in the schools.

That Confucius meant no such blind following of authority is clear from
this saying: "Hwuy gives me no assistance. There is nothing that I say,
in which he does not delight." (Analects, bk. xi., c. iii.)

Investigation and the spirit of free investigation, in order that
knowledge may ever be subjected to repeated tests, are "the root,"
according to the reasoning of Confucius, from which the conduct of life
must proceed. Therefore and referring thereto, the philosopher Yew is
quoted as saying: "The superior man bends his attention to what is
radical. That being established, all

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

practical courses naturally grow up." (Analects, bk. i., c. ii., v. 2.)

This is set forth at length in yet more enthusiastic language: "When we
minutely investigate the nature and reasons of things till we have
entered into the inscrutable and spiritual in them, we attain to the
largest practical application of them; when that application becomes
quickest and readiest and personal poise is secured, our virtue is
thereby exalted. Proceeding beyond this, we reach a point which it is
hardly possible to comprehend; we have thoroughly mastered the
inscrutable and spiritual and understand the processes of
transformation. This is the fulness of virtue." (Yi King, appendix iii.,
sect. ii., v. 33, 34.)

**Learning.** "Learning without thought is labour lost; thought without
learning is perilous." (Analects, bk. ii., c. xv.)

The emphasis is put upon thinking in this statement of the Duke of Kau,
quoted in the "Shu King," by Confucius with approval: "The wise, through
not thinking, become foolish; and the foolish, by thinking, become
wise." (Pt. v., bk. xviii., 2.)

To the idea expressed in these astute words thus adopted by Confucius,
he has added a personal application elsewhere, emphasizing the emptiness
of mere speculation: "I have been the whole day without eating and the
whole night without sleeping, occupied with thinking. It was of no

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

avail. The better plan is to learn." (Analects, bk. xv., c. xxx.)

The idleness of thought, desire, and conduct proceeding upon
insufficient data is set forth by the sage in great detail, in the
following: "There is the love of being benevolent without the love of
learning;—the beclouding here leads to a foolish simplicity. There is
the love of knowing without the love of learning;—the beclouding here
leads to dissipation of mind. There is the love of being sincere without
the love of learning;—the beclouding here leads to an injurious
disregard of consequences. There is the love of straightforwardness
without the love of learning;—the beclouding here leads to rudeness.
There is the love of boldness without the love of learning;—the
beclouding here leads to insubordination. There is the love of firmness
without the love of learning;—the beclouding here leads to extravagant
conduct." (Analects, bk. xvii., c. viii., v. 3.)

Therefore the necessity for patient, unremitting study, not merely of
books but of men, animals, and things, of the phenomena of animate and
inanimate nature, is urged by the great teacher again and again: "Learn
as if you might not attain your object and were always fearing lest you
miss it." (Analects, bk. viii., c. xvii.) "Is it not pleasant to learn
with constant perseverance and application?" (Analects, bk. i., c. i.,
v. 1.)

In this regard, he leaves this picture of himself,

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

in words which he spoke to one of his disciples: "The Duke of She asked
Tsze-loo about Confucius and Tsze-loo did not answer him. The Master
said, 'Why did you not say to him: He is simply a man who in his eager
pursuit of knowledge forgets his food, who in the joy of attaining it
forgets his sorrows, and who does not perceive that old, age is coming
on?'" (Analects, bk. vii., c. xviii.)

And this is also declared to be an essential characteristic of the
superior man: "The superior man learns and accumulates the results of
his learning; puts questions and discriminates among those results;
dwells magnanimously and unambitiously in what he has attained to; and
carries it into practice with benevolence." (Yi King, appendix iv., c.
vi., v. 31.)

That one must be modest as to his ability and acquirements, in order to
learn, was as obvious to the mind of Confucius, as to that of Socrates.
These words of Yueh in the "Shu King" are illustrative of this: "In
learning there should be a humble mind and the maintenance of constant
earnestness." (Pt. iv., bk. viii., sec. iii., i.)

And these are the words of Tsang, referring to his friend, Yen Yuan:
"Gifted with ability and yet putting questions to those who were not so;
possessed of much and yet putting questions to those possessed of
little; having, as though he had not; full, and yet counting himself as
empty; offended against, and yet entering into no altercation."
(Analects, bk. viii., c. v.)

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

Though the mentor of princes, Confucius did not himself depart from such
modesty in giving instruction, even as he adjured his disciples to
observe it always in receiving t; for he gives this testimony concerning
his course: "From the man bringing his bundle of dried flesh upwards, I
have never refused instruction to any one." (Analects, bk. vii., c.
vii.)

There comes before the mind of the modern student of Confucius,
therefore, the same picture of humble companionship with the lowly as
with the great, which the sojourn of Jesus, of Socrates, or of Epictetus
among men also conjures forth. That such would be the universal
consequence, were there universal instruction, *i.e.*, that learning is
essentially democratic and not a respecter of rank, riches, or even of
persons, he affirms in this sentence: "There being instruction, there
will be no distinction of classes" (Analects, bk. xv., c. xxxviii.),
which declaration, accepted and followed, has preserved China from that
stifling death into which the caste system of India has forced its
unhappy people.

Yet by no means unto all, the scoffer as well as the earnest student,
the dull as well as the discerning, did Confucius consider that all
knowledge should be imparted; instead he said: "To those whose talents
are above mediocrity, the highest subjects may be announced. To those
who are below mediocrity, the highest subjects may not be announced."
(Analects, bk. vi., c. xix.)

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

The course which he who would learn must follow is given by Tsze-hea in
these words: "He who from day to day recognizes what he has not yet
attained to, and from month to month remembers what he has attained to,
may be said to love to learn." (Analects, bk. xix., c. v.)

And that thoroughness and completion of all tasks are absolutely
requisite, in these: "The prosecution of learning may be compared with
what may happen in raising a mound. If there lack but one basket of
earth to complete the work, and I there cease, the cessation is my own
act." (Analects, bk. ix., c. xviii.)

That gravity and earnestness are requisite, he thus affirms: "If the
scholar be not grave, he will not call forth any veneration, and his
learning will not be solid." (Analects, bk. i., c. viii., v. 1.)

The reward of learning he declares to be: "It is not easy to find a man
who has learned for three years, without coming to be virtuous."
(Analects, bk. viii., c. xii.)

If observation in these twentieth-century days does not confirm this, is
it not because of this, that investigation and study are but too often
undertaken only in support of propositions to which the students are
already committed, or, to put it otherwise, that such are rather the
labours of the special advocate to establish his cause than of the
impartial seeker after truth? And, if so, how could the result be as
Confucius said? Moreover, in which of our schools are the rules of
mental ethics,

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

of correct study and thought, imparted? Is not the fault rather that
education is not what it should be, than that there is education?

One of the disciples of Confucius testified concerning his instruction,
"He enlarged my mind with learning and taught me the restraints of
propriety" (Analects, bk. ix., c. x., v. 2), by which is meant the rules
of conduct, mental and within one's self, as well as mental though
outwardly expressed. Another disciple said: "There are learning
extensively and having a firm and sincere aim, inquiring with
earnestness, and reflecting with self-application; virtue is in such a
course." (Analects, bk. xix., c. vi.)

Confucius himself remarked: "By extensively studying all learning and
keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of propriety, one may
thus likewise not err from what is right." (Analects, bk. xii., c. xv.)

And in the "Li Ki" this is found: "To acquire extensive information and
remember retentively while yet modest; to do earnestly what is good and
not become weary in so doing—these are characteristics of him whom we
call the superior man." (Bk. i., sect. i., pt. iv., v. 27.)

By emphasizing that learning should be extensive, he did not mean to
advise serious study of every idle speculation which the invention and
ingenuity of human intellects can produce. Instead, the course which he
marked out is that of close and careful observation of facts and
pains-taking,

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

cautious reasoning about them. Of the perils of the other, he says: "The
study of strange doctrines is injurious indeed." (Analects, bk. ii., c.
xvi.)

Notwithstanding this, he did not subordinate, and much less did he
eliminate the need for, attention to the broad conception of the
universe, while keeping one's eye upon the particle of dead matter or
the infinitesimal forms of life. That the laws which operate in the
phenomena of nature are the very laws of God, was ever present in his
mind, and that narrow views of these phenomena, as if they were
unrelated and independent, are not and cannot be true knowledge.
Therefore is it, as he said, that "in order to know men," one "may not
dispense with a knowledge of Heaven." (Doctrine of the Mean, c. xx., v.
7.)

That everything cognizable is the field of learning is suggested in the
words: "Accordingly, the sage, looking up, contemplates the brilliant
phenomena of the heavens and, looking down, examines the definite
arrangements of the earth; thus he knows the causes of darkness and of
light. He traces things to their beginning and follows them to their
end; thus he knows what can be said about death and life." (Yi King,
appendix iii., c. iv., v. 21.)

The great utility to him who would round out his own life by knowledge
of the achievements of ancient worthies was enforced as follows: "The

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

scholar lives and associates with men of his own dime; but the men of
antiquity are the subjects of his study." (Li Ki, bk. xxxviii., v. ii.)

The great, the all-important place of learning, so defined as a moving
force in the scheme of life, and, within the measure of his capacity,
its claim upon every human being, he thus affirmed: "Knowledge,
magnanimity, and energy, these three are the virtues which are
universally binding." (Doctrine of the Mean, c. xx., v. 8.)

The union of a sublime trust and an earnest struggle to learn is thus
praised by the sage himself: "With sincere trust he unites the love of
learning; holding firm unto death, he is perfecting the excellence of
his course." (Analects, bk. viii., c. xiii., v. i.)

**Genius and Inspiration.** It is characteristic of Confucius that,
where he did not know, he did not affirm. His saying, "When you do not
know a thing, to acknowledge that you do not know it, is knowledge "
(Analects, bk. ii., c. xvii.), is far from being: "If you do not know a
thing, affirm that it is not true."

Therefore, especially since, as all candid souls must ever have been, he
was impressed with the marvellous insight which the minds of some of
earth's children had shown, he was not a doctrinaire concerning the
possibility of quicker, surer, and deeper discernment of facts and
truths than that of which ordinary human beings are capable. Accordingly
he says of this: "Those who are born

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

in the possession of knowledge, are the highest class of men. Those who
learn and so acquire knowledge, are next. The dull and stupid who yet
achieve knowledge, are a class next to these. Those who are dull and
stupid and yet do not learn, are the lowest of the people." (Analects,
bk. xvi., c. ix.)

Though he is now reverenced by millions in the Asiatic world as the
greatest mind that has been incarnate among them, Confucius makes no
claim to such inspiration and internal perception of knowledge without
external observation, for himself; instead, he says: "I am not one who
was born in the possession of knowledge; I am one who is fond of
antiquity and earnest in seeking it there." (Analects, bk. vii., c.
xix.)

In view of the fact that others were not able in his day to find what he
set forth, in the archives of mankind or even in the contemplation of
nature, and the further undeniable fact of his wonderful penetration and
clarity, it may be questioned whether, in addition to his tireless
industry, there was not present also the full measure of illumination
from without and, let us reverently say, from above, which has attended
others of the world's great moral teachers and leaders in all time.

That it was not all pure grind—nay, more, that it should never be all
pure grind—but, instead, the organic absorption of knowledge into
himself and as inherent parts of himself, blending into a

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

harmonious, developed whole, these words indicate: "The Master asked,
'Tsze, you think, I suppose, that I am one who learns many things and
keeps them in his memory?' Tsze-kung replied, 'Yes, but perhaps it is
not so?' 'No,' was the answer, 'I seek unity, all pervading.'"
(Analects, bk. xv., c. ii.)

That there might not be foolish reliance upon internal light as a means
of escaping the onerous labour of learning, he spoke this parable: "The
mechanic who wishes to do his work well must first sharpen his tools."
(Analects, bk. xv., c. ix.)

Preparation for the practice of the art of living, he taught, is
necessary unto all men, saying: "Let every man consider virtue as what
devolves upon himself; he may not yield the performance of it even to
his teacher." (Analects, bk. xv., c. xxxv.) And also that perfection is
a plant of slow growth, matured only by steady progress in development,
in this saying as in many others: "I saw his constant advance. I never
saw him halt in his progress." (Analects, bk. ix., c. xx.)

**Sincerity.** "Their knowledge being extensive, their thoughts became
sincere."

The foregoing from "The Great Learning" (Text, v. 5) is challenged more
frequently, perhaps, than any other of its propositions; for the mind
immediately recurs to the remembrance of many Machiavellian characters
who were well-informed, even erudite, and yet insincere. And, although
Confucius here speaks of sincerity within

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

a man's self and toward himself, as counter-distinguished from sincere
speech and action, yet, notwithstanding that one cannot read the inmost
thoughts and purposes of another, few there are who have pondered deeply
and observed widely and closely, that do not know that sincerity of
thought must itself be cultivated or at least be preserved.

Confucius had no mind to say otherwise for he puts it thus in "The Great
Learning" at the very outset: "Wishing to think sincerely, they first
extended their knowledge as widely as possible. This they did by the
investigation of things"; and he himself says, elsewhere: "Leaving
virtue without proper cultivation; not thoroughly discussing what is
learned; not being able to move toward righteousness of which knowledge
has been gained; and not being able to change what is not good: these
are the things which occasion me solicitude." (Analects, bk. vii., c.
iii.)

He also said, referring to knowledge: "A man can enlarge his principles;
the principles do not \[*i.e.*, of themselves\] enlarge the man."
(Analects, bk. xv., c. xxviii.) The same is also implied, as well as
that a man of character, while ready to serve, will not permit himself
to be used, by this saying (Analects, bk. ii., c. xii.): "The superior
man is not an utensil," *i.e.*, his usefulness is not confined to one
thing.

Therefore, not to one who must as a matter of mere consequence comply,
but to one who may

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

exercise a choice whether to obey or not, learned though he may be, he
directs this injunction: "Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first
principles and be moving continually toward what is right." (Analects,
bk. xii., c. x.)

Mencius puts it, beautifully, thus: "There is no greater delight than to
be conscious of sincerity upon self-examination." (Bk. vii., pt. i., c.
iv., v. 2.)

In the "Doctrine of the Mean," Confucius says: "Is it not just entire
sincerity which marks the superior man?" (c. xiii., v. 4); and in "The
Great Learning": "The superior man must make his thoughts sincere." (C.
vi., 4.)

The same idea Mencius presents in this pleasing trope: "The great man is
he who does not lose his child's heart." (Bk. iv., pt. ii., c. xii.)

This sincerity of thought, as of action, Confucius included among the
five qualities essential to perfect virtue, saying: "To be able to
practise five things everywhere under heaven constitutes perfect virtue:
Gravity, magnanimity, sincerity, earnestness, and kindness." (Analects,
bk. xvii., c. vi.)

That it should not be found in every man, however imperfect and however
unstable, was incomprehensible to him, since to his view it is the very
breath of life for an intelligent being. This he declares in these
terms: "Ardent and yet not upright; stupid and yet not attentive; simple
and yet not sincere: such persons I do not understand." (Analects, bk.
viii., c. xvi.)

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

Yet that he did not expect those who were uninstructed to be sincere, is
plain from this expression in the "Doctrine of the Mean": "If a man do
not understand what is good, he will not attain sincerity in himself."
(C. xix., v. 17.)

This is but a negative statement of what has already been quoted
(Doctrine of the Mean, c. xx., v. 19): "To this attainment"—*i.e.*, of
sincerity" there are requisite extensive study of what is good, accurate
inquiry concerning it, careful consideration of it, clear distinguishing
about it, and earnest practical application of it"—many things, in
short, besides and beyond mere knowledge, essential as the intelligent
perception of things as they are, may be. As much is also implied in:
"He who attains to sincerity chooses the good and firmly holds it fast."
(Doctrine of the Mean, c. xxi., v. 8.)

That the attainment of sincerity is an essential prerequisite to
self-development, this book strongly asserts. "Sincerity," it says, "is
that whereby self-development is effected and the path by which a man
must direct himself " (Doctrine of the Mean, c. xxv., v. 1); and again:
"It is only he who is possessed of the completest sincerity that can
exist under Heaven, who can give full development to his nature."
(Doctrine of the Mean, c. xxii.) In the "Yi King" (appendix iv., sect.
i., c. ii., v. 3), it is said: "He is sincere even in his ordinary words
and earnest in his everyday conduct. Guarding against depravity,

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

he preserves his sincerity. His goodness is recognized in the world but
he does not boast of it."

This beneficent power he is also not confined to exerting upon himself
and for his own development only. Instead, it is of broader and even
universal application; for Confucius says: "The possessor of sincerity
develops not himself only; with it, he also develops others." (Doctrine
of the Mean, c. xxv., v. 3.)

By means of sincerity, it is taught in the " Doctrine of the Mean," and
by it alone, man becomes, and is welcomed as, the co-operator with
Heaven, and may thus beneficially influence and even transform others.
There is psychological import in the words: "It is only he who is
possessed of the completest sincerity that can exist under Heaven, who
can transform." (Doctrine of the Mean, c. xxiii.)

This is but one of the many alluring rewards that the sage saw to attend
sincerity, which is, besides, sufficiently its own reward. Insight and
foresight are others, concerning which it is said in the "Doctrine of
the Mean": "He who has sincerity without effort hits what is right and
discerns without laborious thought; he is a sage who naturally and
readily follows the path." (C. xx., v. 18.) "It is characteristic of the
completest sincerity to be able to foreknow." (C. xxiv.) "When
calamities or blessings are about to befall, the good or the evil will
surely be foreknown by

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

him. He, therefore, who is possessed of the completest sincerity, is
like a spirit." (C. xxiv.)

Extreme as these statements may appear, who is there among earnest
thinkers and students that has not seen or experienced something very
like this? It is obvious that the mind can the better fulfil its highest
offices, if steadily applied thereto and never to the grovelling arts of
deception or, lower yet, of self-deception. If gross self-deception, as
by cowardice, self-seeking, prejudice, or superstition, renders the mind
incapable of perceiving the simplest truths concerning the phenomena of
nature, it may well be that complete absence of the wish to deceive or
to be deceived bespeaks clarity of vision and of -prevision—which is,
perhaps, only clear reasoning from the known and now, to the unknown and
to be—though it otherwise seem impossible.

"The Great Learning" teaches that a large measure of this clear vision
may be attained; for, immediately after saying, "The superior man is
watchful over himself, when alone," it is added: "There is no evil to
which the inferior man will not proceed, when alone. When he beholds a
superior man, he tries at once to disguise himself, concealing his evil
under a display of virtue. The other penetrates him as if he saw his
heart and reins" (Text, vi., v. 1, 2).

And this is said (Great Learning, vi., v. 2) to warn the inferior man
and encourage the superior: "What is in fact within, will show without";

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

and the Master is quoted in the "Doctrine of the Mean" (c. xx., v. 18),
as saying with an enthusiasm no more than commensurate with the subject:
"Sincerity is the path of Heaven. The attainment of sincerity is the
path for men," and the "Doctrine of the Mean" adds yet more rapturously
in its praise: "Sincerity is the end and the beginning of all things;
without sincerity, there is nothing. Therefore, the superior man regards
the attainment of sincerity the highest excellence." (C. xxv., v. 2.)

This eloquent passage in the "Shu King" (pt. v., bk. ix., v. 2) is
evidently at one with the view of Confucius: "Awful though Heaven be, it
yet helps the sincere."

**Rectification of Purpose.** "Their thoughts being sincere, their
purposes were rectified."

In "The Great Learning," from which this is taken (Text, v. 5), the
following brief explanation of it is given: "This is meant by
'Self-development depends upon rectifying one's purposes': If a man be
swayed by passion, his conduct will be wrong; and so also if he be
swayed by terror, by fondness, by sorrow, by distress. When the mind is
not dominant, we look but see not, we hear but comprehend not, we eat
but taste not." (C. vii., v. 1, 2.)

The same thought Confucius expresses at another time when addressing one
of his disciples: "Ch‘ang is under the influence of his passions; how
can he be pronounced firm and unbending?" (Analects, bk. v., c. x.)

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

Rarely in any of the books edited by Confucius, composed of his sayings
or purporting to set forth his views, is anything advanced as the very
word of God. Yet upon this topic the following is found in the "Shi
King" (Major Odes, decade i., ode 7): "God said to King Wan: 'Be not
like them who reject this and cling to that! Be not like them who are
ruled by their likes and desires!'"

And in the "Li Ki" is found this account of the methods and purposes of
the ancient kings, already once quoted: "It belongs to the nature of
man, as from Heaven, to be still at his birth. His activity shows itself
as he is acted on by external things, and develops the desires incident
to his nature. Things come to him more and more, and his knowledge is
increased. Then arise the manifestations of liking and disliking. When
these are not regulated by anything within, and growing knowledge leads
more astray without, he cannot come back to himself, and his Heavenly
principle is extinguished.

"Now there is no end of the things by which man is affected; and when
his likings and dislikings are not subject to regulation (from within),
he is changed into the nature of things as they come before him; that
is, he stifles the voice of Heavenly principle within, and gives the
utmost indulgence to the desires by which men may be possessed. On this
we have the rebellious and deceitful heart, with licentious and violent
disorder." (Li Ki, bk. xvii., sect. i., v. 11, 12.)

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

The starting-point for such rectification is vividly portrayed by the
sage in the following passage, also from the "Li Ki" (bk. vii., sect.
ii., v. 20): "The things which men greatly desire are comprehended in
meat, drink, and sexual pleasure; the things which they greatly dislike
are comprehended in death, exile, poverty, and suffering. Likes and
dislikes are the great elements of men's minds."

If to the three things desired by all men were added "air," the four
primal animal requisites to self-preservation and race-preservation
would have been named, each good and well adapted for its own purposes
and not one of them subject to any abuses by the unthinking beast.

That the mind of man, in possessing which he differs from his brother
animals, should fail to subordinate each of these and at the same time
more perfectly and accurately to adapt it to its own purposes,
constitutes abandonment by him of his highest heritage; and such abuses
of normal appetites as are involved in feasting, drinking, abandoned
venery, or snuff-taking, or tobacco or opium smoking, each an exercise
in an abnormal way of a special function for its own sake and without
design that the consequences of its healthful exercise should follow,
obviously are perversions of the mind and well illustrate that saying of
the sage: "The progress of the superior man is upward; the progress of
the ordinary man is downward." (Analects, bk. xiv., c. xxiv.)

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

The destructive results of setting the heart upon blind indulgence in
these refinements of sensual pleasure were sung in "The Odes" by one of
the ancient bards:

"He who loves hunting and women  
Abandons his state to ruin."  
            (Li Ki, bk. ix., sect. ii., v. 12.)

And this bald fact, abundantly shown in this age by the vital statistics
of every country, was spoken by the Duke of Kau and handed down in the
"Shu King" (pt. v., bk. xv., v. 2): "They sought for nothing but
excessive pleasure and so not one of them had long life."

The greater longevity of men who were earnest students and vigorous,
forceful thinkers, not given to dissipation of their energies in any of
the ways described, had already been remarked, indeed, centuries before
the time of Confucius. Yet he had more respect for misguided seekers
after pleasure, at bottom, than for the smug lovers of safe comfort; the
former at least lived, however mistaken their view of life's true aim,
the strenuous existence, making sacrifices to obtain that which they
desired. He would not have been ready to go so far, perhaps, as Ibsen
who says through the lips of Brand:

"Let be, ye are the serfs of pleasure;  
 Be such, then, with no let nor measure!  
 Not one thing merely for today  
 And quite another thing tomorrow. <span id="page_39">p. 39</span>  
 The Bacchants were ideal. They  
 Kept up a constant round of revel.  
 The sot who swings ’twixt drink and sorrow  
 Is but a 'pitiable devil.'  
 Silenus was a fine *figure*,  
 The tippler but his caricature."

But much more clearly than any of the other great ethical teachers of
ancient times, Confucius recognizes the true opposite of lofty purpose
when he puts the contrast thus: "The superior man thinks of virtue; the
ordinary man thinks of comfort." (Analects, bk. iv., c. xi.)

He thus sets one against the other the highest and the lowest aims of
which man is capable; for all other low aims involve at least some
sacrifice, while he who seeks comfort only, thinks that he would be
happier as a mere parasite. Of such, Confucius says: "Hard is the case
of him who will stuff himself with food the whole day, without applying
his mind to anything. Are there not gamesters and chessplayers? Even to
be one of these would be better than doing nothing at all." (Analects,
bk. xvii., c. xxii.)

In this age, when comfort is the sole god of the many, who also deem
themselves good and virtuous and even superior, surely these truths need
to be held before all men without surcease, lest the race degenerate and
perish—degenerate because of low aim and its successful attainment, and
perish because they whose god is comfort tend to cease to propagate. Was
it not to this the

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

sage referred when he said, "Your good, careful people of the villages
are the thieves of virtue" (Analects, bk. xvii., c. xiii.), and, as
quoted by Mencius, "I hate your good, careful men of the villages, lest
they be confounded with the virtuous"? (Bk. vii., pt. ii., c. xxxvi., v.
12.)

The Duke of Kau is represented in the "Shu King " (pt. v., bk. xv., v.
1) to have said of old: "The superior man rests in this, that he will
indulge in no injurious ease."

Confucius was ever insistent upon contrasting the love of virtue with
the love of comfort as in these sayings: "The scholar who cherishes the
love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar." (Analects, bk. xiv.,
c. iii.) "A scholar, whose mind is set on truth and who is ashamed of
poor clothes and poor food, is not fit to be discoursed with."
(Analects, bk. iv., c. ix.)

Scarcely less apposite to the conditions of the present day is this
contrast which he makes: "The mind of the superior man is conversant
with righteousness; the mind of the ordinary man is conversant with
gain." (Analects, bk. iv., c. xxi.)

Yet he holds that one may receive and welcome his reward, albeit that to
secure it should not be his purpose in doing an excellent thing or
service. Indeed, one must not even set before him the purpose to secure
rewards which are real, though not material, such as fame or even
success and self-approbation. The course of virtue, leading

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

to singleness of purpose and thoroughness of work, is thus marked out:
"The man of virtue makes the difficulty to be overcome his first
business, and success only a subsequent consideration." (Analects, bk.
vi., c. xx.)

This he adverts to again, saying: "If doing what is to be done be made
the first business, and success a secondary consideration, is not this
the way to exalt virtue?" (Analects, bk. xii., c. xxi., v. 3.)

And repeatedly in the "Li Ki" this idea is presented in such varied and
beautiful forms as these: "The Master said: 'The superior man will
decline a position of high honour, but not one that is mean; will
decline riches, but not poverty. . . . The superior man, rather than be
rewarded beyond his desert, will have his desert greater than the
reward.'" (Bk. xxvii., v. 7.) "The Master said: 'There is only now and
then a man under heaven who loves what is right without expectation of
reward, or hates what is wrong without fear of consequences.'" (Bk.
xxix., v. 13.) "A superior man will not for counsel of little value
accept a great reward, nor for counsel of great value a small reward."
(Bk. xxix., v. 36.)

Yet more reprehensible, if possible, he deems it that in learning the
purpose be not solely the attainment of truth and the acquisition of
know- ledge, but also or even exclusively the praise or favours of
others; for he says: "In ancient times men learned with a view to their
own improvement.

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nowadays men learn
with a view to the approbation of others." (Analects, bk. xiv., c. xxv.)

From the book of Mencius the following is taken: "Yang Hoo said: 'He who
seeks to be rich will not be benevolent; he who seeks to be benevolent
will not be rich.'" (Bk. ii., pt. i., c. iii., v. 5.)

The following inspiring saying from the "Li Ki" (bk. xxix., v. 27)
points out the goal to attain which the sincere mind must perforce
direct all its power: "The services of Hau Ki were the most meritorious
of all under heaven. . . . But all he longed for was that his actions
should be better than the fame of them, and so he said of himself that
he was simply 'a man who is useful to others.'"

Mencius supplies these infallible indications that one's purpose is not
unmixed with selfish designs, and therefore that it requires careful
scrutiny and rectification: "If a man love others and that love is not
returned, let him examine himself as to his love of others. If he rules
others but his government is not successful, let him examine himself as
to wisdom. If he is polite to others but they impolite to him, let him
examine himself as to real respect for them. When by what we do we do
not achieve our aim, we must examine ourselves at every point. When a
man is right, the whole empire will turn to him." (Bk. iv., pt. i., c.
iv., v. 1, 2.)

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

**Rectified Purpose.** "Exalted merit depends on high aim."

This precept, taken from the "Shu King" (pt. v., bk. xxi., v. 4), in
altered form and otherwise applied, runs through these sentences of
Confucius: "Do not be desirous of having things done quickly. Do not
look at small advantages. Desire to have things done quickly prevents
their being done thoroughly. Looking at small advantages prevents great
affairs from being accomplished." (Analects, bk. xiii., c. xvii.)

Stern self-examination is inculcated in the "Li Ki" as the first duty of
him who aspires to be of service, or who assumes responsibilities: "For
one who wished to serve his ruler, the rule was first to measure his
abilities and duties and then enter upon the responsibilities; he did
not first enter and then measure. The same rule applied when one begged
or borrowed from others or sought to enter their service." (Bk. xv., v.
19.)

And yet more pointedly in this from the "Shi King" (Major Odes, decade
iii., ode 6): "He was always anxious lest he should not be equal to his
task."

Thoroughness, continuity of purpose and persistence are strongly urged;
but, above all things, that rigorous judgment of a man's self which
alone can keep his effort directed toward the goal. On this point,
Confucius sadly and repeatedly warns his disciples against
over-confidence that

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

these things will come of themselves, saying: "I have not seen one who
loves virtue as he loves beauty." (Analects, bk. ix., c. xvii., bk. xv.,
c. xii.) And again: "I have not yet seen one who could perceive his
faults and inwardly accuse himself." (Analects, bk. v., c. xxvi.)

Nevertheless the necessity for constant self-inspection was held before
his disciples, as in this parable (Great Learning, c. ii.): "On the
bathtub of Tang the following words were engraved: 'If you can purify
yourself a single day, do so every day. Let no day pass without
purification!'"; and the same he said, even more vigorously, thus: "To
assail one's own wickedness and not assail that of others, is this not
the way to correct cherished evil?" (Analects, bk. xii., c. xxi., v. 3.)

On another occasion Confucius illustrated it by referring to archery and
saying: "In archery, we have something like the way of the superior man.
When the archer misses the centre of the target, he turns around and
seeks the cause of his failure within himself." (Doctrine of the Mean,
c. xiv., v. 5.)

His disciple, Tsang, thus describes the scrutiny to which he habitually
and daily submitted his own thoughts and conduct: "I daily examine
myself on three points: whether, in transacting business for others I
may not have been faithful; whether, in intercourse with friends, I may
not have been sincere; and whether I may not have

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

mastered and practised the instructions of my teacher." (Analects, bk.
i., c. iv.)

This the "Doctrine of the Mean" enjoins as necessary in order that one
may justly cherish true self-respect, saying: "The superior man examines
his heart that there may be nothing wrong there and that he may have no
cause for dissatisfaction with himself." (C. xxxiii., v. 2.)

Both emulation of the virtues of superior men and this unrelenting
introspection are urged in this counsel: "When we see men of worth, we
should think of equalling them; when we see men of the contrary
character, we should turn inwards and examine ourselves." (Analects, bk.
iv., c. xvii.)

Mencius illustrates this and enlarges upon it thus: "To support the
resolution, there is nothing better than to make the desires few. Here
is a man whose desires are few; in some things he may not be able to
maintain his resolution, but they will be few. Here is a man whose
desires are many; in some things he may be able to maintain his
resolution, but they will be few." (Bk. vii., pt. ii., c. xxxv.)

The emphasis which the sage thus puts upon desire and purpose, does not
imply that he deems the act good or bad, only according as the motive is
virtuous or evil. The act will be judged by its effect and the motive
also by its result. The act may affect for weal or woe the man or others
or both, entirely independently of the purpose; but

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

the wish and intention immediately affect the development of the man
himself, and make him more or less a man.

Therefore is it that from earliest youth one must be careful about that
which he most earnestly desires, not because he will not obtain it, but
because he will, to his making or his undoing; and the teachers of the
young have greater reason to direct with care their wishes, longings,
and ambitions than merely their present application to study and work.

Mencius refers to this when he aptly says: "Let a man stand fast in the
nobler part of himself and the meaner part will not be able to take it
from him." (Bk. vi., pt. i., c. xv., v. 2.)

He also points out how men are distinguished by the loftiness or lowness
of their purposes, thus: "Those who follow that part of themselves which
is great, are great men; those who follow that part of themselves which
is little, are little men." (Bk. vi., pt. i., c. xv., v. 1.)

The intimate and immediate connection between sincerity and purity of
purpose is self-evident; only by the most searching sincerity can the
human intellect be prevented from deceiving itself, where elemental
appetites, useful for the purposes for which they exist but destructive
if unrestrained, plead for freedom from restraint and even for
stimulation as ends in themselves and not in furtherance of the cosmic
purposes of self-preservation and race-preservation for which they were
given.

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

This glorious picture of achievement Confucius puts before those of his
disciples who will preserve in thought and action unswerving integrity
of purpose and of aim: "Contemplating good and pursuing it as if they
could not attain to it, contemplating evil and shrinking from it as they
would from thrusting the hand into boiling water—I have seen such men as
I have heard such words." (Analects, bk. xvi., c. xi., v. 1.)

There may, then, be such men; no impossible standard is here set up.
Confucius had long held his conduct up to it and says of himself: "With
coarse rice to eat, with water to drink and my bended arm for a pillow,
I still have joy in the midst of these things. Riches and honours,
acquired by unrighteousness, are to me as a. floating cloud." (Analects,
bk. vii., c. xv.)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1"></span>[2:1](eoc06.htm#fr_1.md) I have been much concerned
about the word which should be given for the Chinese word appearing
here. Legge renders it "mean," meaning thereby "average." I discard his
word as ambiguous and choose "ordinary" as nearest to the idea, which is
"the average among men who are not superior." This expression must not,
however, be taken as a term describing the common people; as will be
seen, Confucius reverenced them, as in our age did Abraham Lincoln.
