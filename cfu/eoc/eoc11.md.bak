### CHAPTER VI

#### CULTIVATION OF THE FINE ARTS

CONFUCIUS held that the encouragement of the fine arts was no less a
duty of the state than the protection of the people from foreign foes
and the suppression of internal disorder.

**The Fine Arts in General.** "When good government prevails in the
empire, ceremonies, music, and punitive military expeditions proceed
from the emperor." (Analects, bk. xvi., c. ii., v. i.)

This saying of Confucius, recorded in the "Analects" and suggesting that
wise patronage and encouragement of art by the government which has
distinguished the most enlightened governments of ancient and of modern
times, was re-enforced without ceasing by Mencius when he rebuked
princes who indulged themselves, but failed to share their pleasures
with the meanest citizen. Thus he said: "If the people are not able to
enjoy themselves, they condemn them that are over them. Thus to condemn
their superiors when they cannot enjoy themselves is wrong; but when
they that are over the people do not make pleasure a thing common to all
as

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

to themselves, they also do wrong." (Bk. i., pt. ii., c. iv., v. 1, 2.)

And again, speaking of beauty in woman: "If Your Majesty loves beauty,
let the people be able to gratify the same feeling!" (Bk. i., pt. ii.,
c. v., v. 5.)

Confucius repeatedly emphasized the importance of the cultivation of the
arts, as when he said of himself: "When I had no official employment, I
acquired many arts." (Analects, bk. ix., c. vi., v. 4.) Among these
were, of course, letters in which he excelled all others, ceremonies in
which he had no peer, and music in which he was also trained, both as a
critic and as a performer.

To others he gave this counsel: "Let relaxation and enjoyment be found
in the polite arts!" (Analects, bk. vii., c. vi., v. 4.) "It is by the
Odes that the mind is aroused. It is by the rules of propriety that the
character is established." (Analects, bk. viii., c. viii., v. 1, 2.)

In the "Li Ki" is this admonition: "A scholar should constantly pursue
what is virtuous and find recreation in the arts." (Bk. xv., v. 22.)

His disciples' related of him: "The Master's frequent themes of
discourse were: the Odes, History, and the maintenance of the rules of
propriety." (Analects, bk. vii., c. xvii.) "There were four things which
the Master taught: letters, ethics, devotion of soul, and truthfulness."
(Analects, bk. vii., c. xxiv.)

The following disjointed passages, apropos of

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

nothing else in common, indicate the appreciation by the sage of
æsthetic values of the most varied character: "I have not seen one who
loves virtue as he loves beauty." (Analects, bk. ix., c. xvii., and bk.
xv., c. xii.)" The Master, standing by a stream, remarked: 'It flows on
like this, never ceasing, day and night!'" (Analects, bk. ix., c. xvi.)
"Is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant quarters?"
(Analects, bk. i., c. i., v. 2.) "The wise find pleasure in water, the
virtuous find pleasure in hills." (Analects, bk. vi., c. xxi.) "I hate
the manner in which purple takes away the lustre of vermilion. I hate
the way in which the songs of Ch‘ing confound the music of the Gna."
(Analects, bk. xvii., c. xviii.)

The foregoing reference to colour implies appreciation of painting
which, however, is seldom, if ever, referred to and seems to have been
in an undeveloped state, compared, for instance, with poetry or music.
The following from the "Analects" appears to refer to it, however:
"Tsze-hea asked, saying, 'What is the meaning of the passage: "The
pretty dimples of her artful smile! The well-defined black and white of
her eye! The plain ground for the colours!"?' The Master answered: 'The
business of laying on the colours follows the preparation of the plain
ground." (Bk. iii., c. viii., v. 1, 2.)

The value of beauty for beauty's sake, even though it be but the beauty
of ornament or of accomplishments, was enforced by Tsze-kung,

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

one of his disciples, in this colloquy: "Kih Tsze-shing asked: 'In a
superior man it is only the substantial qualities that are wanted; why
should we seek for ornamental accomplishments?' Tsze-kung replied:
'Alas! your words, sir, show you to be a superior man; but four horses
cannot overtake the tongue. Ornament is as substance; substance is as
ornament. The hide of a tiger or leopard stripped of its hair is like
the hide of a dog or goat stripped of its hair.'" (Analects, bk. xii.,
c. vii.)

That it will be beneficial for a state to encourage and foster the arts,
because of their civilizing effect upon the people, these words from the
"Li Ki" may be quoted to illustrate: "Confucius said: 'When you enter a
state you can know what subjects have been taught. If they show
themselves men who are mild and gentle, sincere and good, they have been
taught from the Book of Poetry. . . . If they be big-hearted and
generous, bland and honest, they have been taught from the Book of
Music."' (Bk. xxiii., 1.)

**Poetry and Letters.** "In the Book of Poetry are three hundred pieces,
but the design of them all may be embraced in one sentence: 'Have no
depraved thoughts!'" (Analects, bk. ii., c. ii.)

The importance of poetry and of good literature in general was
frequently emphasized as in this passage from the "Analects" by
Confucius who on one occasion addressed his disciples, saying: "My
children, why do you not study the Book of

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Poetry? The Odes
serve to stimulate the mind, They may be used for purposes of
self-contemplation. They teach the art of companionship. They show how
to moderate feelings of resentment. From them you learn the more
immediate duty of serving one's father and the remoter duty of serving
one's prince." (Bk. xvii., c. ix.)

Mencius seems to have been the earliest to make use of this metaphor in
describing the delights and benefits of reading: "When a scholar feels
that his friendship with all the virtuous scholars of the empire is not
sufficient, he proceeds to ascend to consider the men of antiquity. He
repeats their poems and reads their books and, as he does not know what
they were as men, to ascertain this, he considers the conditions of
their time. This is to ascend and make them his friends." (Bk. v., pt.
ii., c. viii., v. 2.)

The manner in which Confucius enjoined the study of poetry upon his
eldest son is told in this conversation with Chin K‘ang: "Ch‘in K‘ang
asked Pih-yu, saying, 'Have you had any lessons from your father
different from what we have all heard?' Pih-yu replied: 'No. He was
standing alone once, when I passed below the hall with hasty steps, and
said to me: "Have you learned the Odes?" On my replying, "Not yet," he
added: "If you do not learn the Odes, you will not be fit to converse
with." I retired and studied the Odes.'" (Analects, bk. xvi., c. xiii.,
v. 1, 2.)

That learning should not be merely by rote, that

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

the sentiments and thoughts of the poet must be made a part of a man's
self, and that all training should be with a view to use as well as
ornament, Confucius set forth in these words: "Though a man may be able
to recite the three hundred Odes, yet if, when intrusted with a
governmental charge, he knows not how to act or if, when sent to any
quarter on a mission, he cannot give his replies unassisted, then
notwithstanding the extent of his learning, of what practical use is
it?" (Analects, bk. xiii., c. v.)

The finely discriminating literary taste of Confucius was the marvel of
his time and his canons are yet generally accepted. He is even
represented as saying of himself, in all modesty: "In letters I am
perhaps equal to other men." (Analects, bk. vii., c. xxxii.) Still his
views were of the simplest, the most naïve. Thus, for instance, he says,
tersely: "Of language, it is sufficient that it convey the meaning."
(Analects, bk., xv., c. xl.)

Yet, well pondered, this saying is both true and discerning; for
comprehensive and accurate conveyance of the precise meaning in its
every shade and distinction is the office of the most consummate
literary art.

When Confucius was in Wei and was asked, by Tsze-loo, his pupil, what he
would consider the first thing to do in administering the government of
Wei, he replied: "What is first necessary is to correct names," *i.e.*,
the names of things, and said in explanation: "If names be not correct,
language

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

is not in accordance with the truth of things." (Analects, bk. viii., c.
iii.)

The mischiefs which arise from miscomprehension, due to the inexact use
of language, he painted in strong colours, and then said: "Therefore the
superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be
rightly spoken, so that what he says may be fulfilled to the letter.
What the superior man requires is just that in his language there may be
nothing inaccurate." (Analects, bk. xiii., c. iii., v. 7.)

That a man's diction should also be guarded against inelegance and
coarseness, the disciple Tsang declares in this: "There are three
principles of conduct which the man of high rank should consider
especially important: that in his deportment and manner he keep from
violence and heedlessness; that in regulating his countenance he keep
near to sincerity; that in his words and tones he keep far from lowness
and impropriety." (Analects, bk. viii., c. iv., v. 3.)

The emphasis upon "far" is worthy of special note.

Certainly Confucius was so completely removed from ignoring the beauties
and even the subtleties of style, that he was the most eminent of all
the Chinese ancients for simplicity, purity, elegance, and exactitude of
language, both spoken and written. He had, also, the conception that it
is only he who can discriminate finely between expressions that can
divine the thought from the spoken or

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

written word or even from the act, fully, accurately, and clearly; and
therefore he says: "Without knowing words, it is impossible to know
men." (Analects, bk. xx., c. iii., v. 3.)

In the "Li Ki" is thus described the accepted manner of elegant speech:
"The style prized in conversation is that it should be grave and
distinct." (Bk. xv., 23.)

The usefulness of letters and of association with men of literary taste,
in forming character and confirming it, the disciple Tsang set forth as
follows: "The superior man on literary grounds meets with his friends
and by their friendship helps his virtue." (Analects, bk. xii., c.
xxiii.)

And the inadequacy of both the written and the spoken word to express
the highest, noblest, and sublimest thought, is set forth in this saying
of Confucius, taken from the "Yi King" (appendix iii., sect. i., c.
xii., 76): "The written characters are not the full exponent of speech
and speech is not the full expression of ideas."

**Music.** "Music produces pleasure which human nature cannot be
without." (Li Ki, bk. xvii., sect. iii.) "Virtue is the strong stem of
human nature and music is the blossoming of virtue." (Li Ki, bk. xvii.,
sect. ii., 21.)

These eloquent tributes to both the charm and the usefulness of music
are from the "Li Ki," in which much attention is given to this
fascinating art, which seems to have been developed in ancient China far
beyond any other of the fine arts.

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

This is the more remarkable since in these days Chinese music is rightly
regarded of a poor sort. The disappearance of the old, worthy, classical
music is ascribed, singularly enough, to the Chinese scholastics. The
work of Confucius, "The Book of Music," was wholly lost during the Han
dynasty together with the old operas, choruses, songs, and instrumental
pieces. Later, the antiquarian scholars found it impossible to discover
and restore these; and, influenced by the word but not by the spirit of
Confucius, they ignored the music of the common people which,
accordingly, became and continues degraded. This is the tradition
offered to explain the absence of noble melodies and harmonies in a
country where, by the testimony of one of the world's greatest, it was
in full development more than two thousand years ago.

In the "Analects," also, Confucius has said: "If a man be without the
virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with music?" (Analects,
bk. iii., c. iii.)

Its development was already ancient in his day; and, according to the
"Li Ki," the tradition ran: "It was by music that the ancient kings gave
appropriate expression to their joy." (Bk. xvii., sect. iii., 30.) It
was also said in this book of the olden days: "He \[the emperor\] had
music at his meals." But the most significant of the traditions there
found was this: "In music the sages found pleasure and that it could be
used to make the hearts of the people good. Because of the

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

deep influence which it exerts on a man and the change which it produces
in manners and customs, the ancient kings appointed it as one of the
subjects of instruction." (Bk. xvii., sect. ii., 7.)

Of singing it was there said: "All the modulations of the voice arise
from the mind, and the various affections of the mind are produced by
things external to it. . . . Music is the production of the modulations
of the voice and its source is in the affections of the mind as it is
influenced by external things." (Bk. xvii., sect. i., 1, 2.)

That music is not merely an expression of what may be in the mind, be it
good or bad, but also a powerful influence upon it, for weal or ill, is
affirmed by Tsze-hsia in the "Li Ki" in these words: "The airs of Kang
go to wild excess and debauch the mind; those of Sung speak of slothful
indulgence and of women, and submerge the mind; those of Wei are
strenuous and fast and perplex the mind; and those of Khi are violent
and depraved and make the mind arrogant. The airs of these four states
all stimulate libidinous desire and are injurious to virtue." (Bk.
xvii., sect. iii., 11.) That such may be is accounted for by ascribing
to music the property of universal speech open to all the intelligences
of the universe, as follows: "Whenever notes that are evil and depraved
affect men, a corresponding evil spirit responds to them; and when this
evil spirit accomplishes its manifestations, licentious music is the
result. Whenever notes that are correct affect men, a

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

corresponding good spirit responds to them; and when this good spirit
accomplishes its manifestations, sublime music is the result." (Li Ki,
bk. xvii., sect. ii., 14.)

The labours of Confucius in editing, pruning, and perfecting the poetry
and music extant in his day were among his most celebrated feats. Of it
he himself says: "I returned from Wei to Loo, and then the music was
reformed and the pieces in the Imperial Songs and Songs of Praise all
found their proper places." (Analects, bk. ix., c. xiv.)

In the "Li Ki" it is also said: "In an age of disorder, ceremonies and
music are forgotten and neglected, and music becomes licentious." (Bk.
xvii., sect. ii., 12.)

But this need for reform did not apply to all music. "The Shaou" was
famous in his day as a noble piece of music, and "The Woo" scarcely
second to it. Between these he is said to have distinguished,
discriminatingly, thus: "The Master said of 'The Shaou' that it was
perfectly beautiful and also perfectly good. He said of 'The Woo' that
it was perfectly beautiful but not perfectly good." (Analects, bk. iii.,
c. xxv.)

Of his appreciation of "The Shaou" this is related: "When the Master was
in Ts‘e, he heard 'The Shaou'; and for three months he did not know the
taste of flesh. 'I did not think,' he said, 'that music could have been
made so excellent as this!'" (Analects, bk. vii., c. xiii.)

Of the performance of another piece, "The

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Kwan Ts‘eu," he
said: "When the music-master, Che, first entered upon his office, the
finish of 'The Kwan Ts‘eu' was magnificent. How it filled the ears!"
(Analects, bk. viii., c. xv.)

Of this piece he elsewhere said: "The Kwan Ts‘eu is expressive of
enjoyment without being licentious and of grief without being hurtfully
excessive." (Analects, bk. iii., c. xx.)

Obviously there were already performances of the oratorio or even the
opera type, for in the "Li Ki" this is found: "Poetry gives the thought
expression; singing prolongs the notes of the voice; pantomime puts the
body into action. These three spring from the mind and musical
instruments accompany them." (Bk. xvii., sect. ii., 21.)

"The Shaou" was evidently something akin to opera. Confucius indicates
as much when he speaks its praise in the following, commingled with
dispraise of certain other songs: "Let the music be Shaou with its
pantomimes! Banish the songs of Ch‘ing and keep aloof from specious
orators! The songs of Ch‘ing are licentious; specious orators are
dangerous." (Analects, bk. xv., c. x., v. 5, 6.)

That "The Woo" was operatic is plainly shown by this description of it,
given in the "Li Ki": "Regarding the music of Woo, in the first scene,
the pantomimes proceed towards the north to imitate the marching of Wu
Wang against Shang (or the Yin dynasty). In the second scene, they show
the extinction of Shang. In the third scene,

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

they exhibit the victorious return to the south, In the fourth scene,
they play the annexation of the southern states. In the fifth scene,
they manifest the division of labour of the dukes of Chou and Shao, one
on the left and the other on the right, in charge of the empire. In the
sixth scene, they return to the point of starting to show that the work
of the emperor is complete and that the whole empire recognizes him as
the supreme ruler." (Bk. xvii., sect. iii., 18.)

The condemnation of the sage was visited in action as well as in words
upon the following occasion: "The people of Ts‘e sent to Loo a present
of female musicians, which Ke Hwan Tze accepted; and for three days no
court was held. Confucius took his departure." (Analects, bk. xviii., c.
iv.)

Loo, it is to be recalled, was the very state where Confucius afterwards
revised and harmonized the music of the realm. Of mere jingle, he spoke
disparagingly, thus: "'It is music!' they say, 'It is music!' Are bells
and drums all that is meant by music?" (Analects, bk. xvii., c. xi.)

In the "Li Ki" it is said, likewise: "What you ask about is music, what
you like is sound. Now music and sound are akin but they are not the
same." (Bk. xvii., sect. iii., 9.)

And yet greater purity of taste is indicated by this saying from the
same book: "In music, more than aught else, there should be nothing
showy or false." (Bk. xvii., sect. ii., 22.)

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

To his eldest son, Pih-yu, he said: "Give yourself to the Chow-nan and
the Chaou-nan. The man who has not studied the Chow-nan and the
Chaou-nan is like one who stands with his face against a wall."
(Analects, bk. xvii., c. x.)

Confucius was himself a musical performer upon many instruments,
according to tradition. In the "Analects" is found this account of his
skill upon "the musical stone": "The Master was playing one day on a
musical stone in Wei, when a man carrying a straw basket passed the door
of the house where Confucius was and said, 'His heart is full who beats
the musical stone!'" (Analects, bk. xiv., c. xlii., v. i.)

That he had comprehensive knowledge of the art is obvious, not merely
from what he did for the music of Loo but also from the fact that this
saying of his was deemed worthy to be handed down: "How to play music
may be known. At the commencement of the piece, all the parts should
sound together. As it proceeds, they should be in harmony, severally
distinct and flowing, without break, and thus on to the conclusion."
(Analects, bk. iii., c. xxiii.)

That Chinese music had already progressed far beyond mere melodies is
sufficiently plain, no doubt, from what has already been said. Yet it is
germane to quote this from the "Li Ki": "Harmony is the thing
principally sought in music." (Bk. xvii., sect. i., 29.)

The following also indicates the reverence and

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

respect in which Confucius was held even by the most accomplished
singers of his time, both as a man and an expert on matters of taste,
and perhaps as a musician also: "When the Master was in company with a
person who was singing, if he sang well, he would make him repeat the
song while he accompanied it with his own voice." (Analects, bk. vii.,
c. xxxi.)

His preference for classical music is voiced in this saying: "The men of
former times, in the matters of ceremonies and music, were rustics, it
is said, while the men of these later times, in ceremonies and music,
are accomplished artists. If I have occasion to use those things, I
follow the men of former times!" (Analects, bk. xi., c. i.)

He included among the " three things men find enjoyment in, which are
advantageous," this: "The discriminating study of ceremonies and music."
(Analects, bk. xvi., c. v.)

The method by which music is conceived of, as profoundly affecting the
moral nature of man, is thus circumstantially and persuasively
delineated in the "Li Ki": "Hence the superior man returns to the good
affections proper to his nature, in order to bring his will into harmony
with them, and compares the different qualities of actions in order to
perfect his conduct. Notes that are evil and depraved and sights leading
to disorder and licentiousness are not allowed to affect his ears and
eyes. Licentious music and corrupted ceremonies are not admitted into
the mind to

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

affect its powers. The spirit of idleness, indifference, depravity, and
perversity finds no exhibition in his person." (Bk. xvii., sect. ii.,
15.)

These most desirable results, however, by no means exhaust the
conception of Confucius, of the benefits to the heart and mind which a
full knowledge and appreciation of music can impart. The highest
possibilities are set forth in these words of most enthusiastic
eloquence, also in the pages of the "Li Ki": "When one has mastered
music completely and regulates his heart and mind accordingly, the
natural, correct, gentle, and sincere heart is easily developed and joy
attends its development. This joy proceeds into a feeling of calm. This
calm continues long. In this unbroken calm the man is Heaven within
himself. Like unto Heaven, he is spiritual. Like unto Heaven, though he
speak not, he is accepted. Spiritual, he commands awe, without
displaying anger." (Bk. xvii., sect. iii., 23.)

**Ceremonies.** "Ceremonies and music should not for a moment be
neglected by any one." (Li Ki, bk. xvii., sect. iii., v. 23.)

In this passage from the "Li Ki" and in many other sayings of Confucius
and his followers, music and ceremonies are mentioned together. This is
particularly true in the "Li Ki" in which both subjects are most
discussed and from which all the quotations under this head have been
taken.

It is partly explained, as follows: "The sphere in which music
manifests, is within; the sphere of

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

ceremonies is without." (Li Ki, bk. xvii., sect. iii., v. 25.)

This is repeated in another place with emphasis and with apposite
deductions therefrom, thus: "Music springs from the inner motions of the
soul; ceremonies are the outward motions of the body. Therefore do men
make ceremonies as few and short as possible but give free range to
music." (Li Ki, bk. xvii., sect. iii., v. 26.)

That Chinese ceremonies are, or were, few and short, none will perhaps
credit, especially after looking through the portions relating to them
in the works of Confucius. But it must be recalled—and it requires a
distinct effort for the Occidental mind to conceive and to realize the
thought—that ceremonies constitute a language,—a language, also, very
erudite, richly expressive, ornate and comprehensive when developed as
in China. This language, indeed, in its difficulties, as in many other
respects, no doubt, is comparable only with a written language such as
the ideographs of China constitute; and perhaps, like them, has within
it the possibilities of a universal means of symbolical communication as
by a printed text, entirely independent of the speech of men.

It must have been with somewhat of this sentiment that the ancient sage
viewed ceremonies, else his praise would be extravagant, indeed. It is
said of those whose work was even then traditional: "The sages made
music in response to Heaven and framed ceremonies in correspondence

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

with Earth." (Li Ki, bk. xvii., sect. i., v. 29.)

Of good taste in manners as in music, the "Li Ki" well says: "The
highest style of music is sure to be distinguished by its ease; the
highest style of elegance, by its undemonstrativeness." (Bk. xvii.,
sect. i., v. 17.)

And it unites them with the real things of character and of life in
these words: "Benevolence is akin to music and righteousness to
ceremonies." (Bk. xvii., sect. i., v. 28.)

This also, is not a mere commonplace or abstraction in the mind of this
wisest of the Orientals; for the book returns to it as follows: "He who
has understood both ceremonies and music may be pronounced to be a
possessor of virtue; virtue means self-realization." (Li Ki, bk. xvii.,
sect. i., v. 8.)

This work even indicates the method by which these practical results may
flow from an art so simple and apparently so void of deep significance:
"Perform ceremonies and music perfectly in all their outward
manifestation and application, and all else under heaven will be easy."
(Li Ki, bk. xvii., sect. iii., v. 25.)

This is more definitely and clearly said in the following: "The
instructive and transforming power of ceremonies is subtle. They check
depravity before it has taken form, causing men daily to move toward
what is good and to keep themselves far from wrong-doing, without being
conscious

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

of it. It was on this account that the ancient kings set so high a value
on them." (Li Ki, bk. xxiii., 9.)

Confucius, however, does not think of music as merely a human art, but
also as the common speech of all intelligences of the universe; and he
desires that ceremonies become and be to the eyes of men just such a
delicate, graceful, and expressive mode of communication. Therefore
their interrelationship with the seen and the unseen is asserted in the
"Li Ki" in these terms, in no respect uncertain: "In music of the
grandest style there is the same harmony that prevails between Heaven
and Earth; in ceremonies of the grandest form there is the same
graduation that exists between Heaven and Earth." (Bk. xvii., sect. i.,
v. 19.)

Yet more explicit is this language, all the more significant in that
Confucius did not often discuss, or even refer to, spiritual beings: "In
the visible there are ceremonies and music; in the invisible, the
spiritual agencies." (Li Ki, bk. xvii., sect. i., v. 19.)

And in the same book he even asserted the psychical power of ceremonies,
as of music,—of both of these, united—to summon the intelligences of the
universe for communion with minds imprisoned in human bodies, in these
burning phrases: "Ceremonies and music in their nature resemble Heaven
and Earth, penetrate the virtues of the spiritual intelligences, bring
down spirits from above and lift the souls that are abased." (Bk. xvii.,
sect. iii., v. 2.)
