### Footnotes

<span id="note_1"></span>[1](#fr_1.md) "Bonds" with written characters on
them superseded the "knotted cords" of the primitive age. That the
material of the bonds should be, as here represented, slips of ivory,
would seem to anticipate the progress of society.

<span id="note_2"></span>[2](#fr_2.md) The Hwangs preceded the Tis in the
Taoistic genesis of history; and as being more simple were Taoistically
superior to them; so it was with the Tis and the Wangs or Kings.

<span id="note_3"></span>[3](#fr_3.md) This of course was Lao-Tze.

<span id="note_4"></span>[4](#fr_4.md) So it was, according to the story,
that Lao-Tze drew near to the barrier gate, when he wished to leave
China.

<span id="note_5"></span>[5](#fr_5.md) The Ko is a river flowing from
Ho-nan into An-hui, and falling into the Hwai, not far from the district
city of Hwai-yuan.

<span id="note_6"></span>[6](#fr_6.md) The nine wells, or bubbling springs,
near the village where Lao was born, are mentioned by various writers;
but I fail to see how the growth of the trees about them indicated the
ruin of his temple.

<span id="note_7"></span>[7](#fr_7.md) The "desert sands" were, no doubt,
what we call "the desert of Gobi." The trees referred to were "in the
extreme East."

<span id="note_8"></span>[8](#fr_8.md) "The sage beneath the Pillar" must
be Lao-Tze.

<span id="note_9"></span>[9](#fr_9.md) "The smoke," I suppose, "of the
incense, and from the offerings."

<span id="note_10"></span>[10](#fr_10.md) Taoist monks are called "Plumaged
or Feathered Scholars," from the idea that by their discipline and pills
they can emancipate themselves from the trammels of the material body,
and ascend (fly up) to heaven. Arrived there, as Immortals or *Hsien*,
it further appears they were constituted into a hierarchy or society, of
which some of them were "officers," higher in rank than others.

<span id="note_11"></span>[11](#fr_11.md) An allusion to the text of the
hexagrams of the Yi King, where the explanations of them by King Wan —
his *thwan*, are followed by the symbolism of their different lines by
the duke of Chau — his *hsiang*.
