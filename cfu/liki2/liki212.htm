<P>1. Formerly, when the duke of K&acirc;u gave audience to the feudal princes in their several places. in the Hall of Distinction, the son of Heaven stood with his back to the axe-embroidered screen [2], and his face towards the south[3].</P>
<P>2. The three dukes[4] were in front of the steps, in the middle, with their faces to the north, inclining to the east as the most honourable position[5]. The places of the marquises were at the east of the</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. See introductory notice, vol. xxvii, p . 28-30. On the opposite page there is the plan of the Hall, as given in Morrison's Dictionary, vol. i, part i, page 512. Compare it with the less complicated figure in vol. xxvii, page 252.</P>
<P>2. See vol. xxvii, page 111, paragraph 11.</P>
<P>3. Many chronological and other perplexing questions arise in connexion with the great audience described in this and the paragraphs that immediately follow. The time should be referred, I think to the inauguration of Lo as the eastern capital of K&acirc;u, probably in B.C. 1109, at the close of the duke of K&acirc;u's regency for the young king Khang; see the Sh&ucirc;, V, xiii. That 'the son of Heaven' must be understood of king Khang himself, and not of the duke of K&acirc;u, is a point, it seems to me, that no Chinese commentator should ever have called in question.</P>
<P>2. The three Kung, I suppose, mentioned in vol. iii, page 227, paragraph 3. The duke of K&acirc;u was himself one of them; but perhaps, during his regency, another had been appointed in his place.</P>
<P>3. The text here simply = 'the east the upper.' The nearer one was to the king, the more honourable was his position.]</P>
</FONT><P>eastern steps, with their faces to the west, inclining to the north as the most honourable position. The lords of the earldoms were at the west of the western steps, with their faces to the east, inclining also and for the same reason to the north. The counts were on the east of the gate, with their faces to the north, inclining to the east as the more honourable position. The barons were on the west of the gate, with their faces to the north, inclining also and for the same reason to the east.</P>
<P>3. The chiefs of the nine &Icirc; [1] were outside the eastern door, with their faces to the west, inclining to the north as the position of honour; those of the eight M&acirc;n were outside the door on the south, with their faces to the north, inclining for the same reason to the cast; those of the six Zung were outside the door on the west, with their faces to the east, inclining for the same reason to the south; and those of the five T&icirc; were outside the door on the north, with their faces to the south, inclining for the same reason to the east.</P>
<P>4. The chiefs of the nine Zh&acirc;i were outside the Ying gate, with their faces to the north, inclining to the east as the position of honour for them; those of the four S&acirc;i (also) came, who had only once in their time to announce their arrival (at the court). These were the places of the lords in the Hall of Distinction (when they appeared before) the duke of K&acirc;u[2].</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. &Icirc; was the general name for the wild tribes of the east; M&acirc;n, for those of the south; Zung, for those of the west; and T&icirc;, for those of the north.</P>
<P>2. It is so difficult to explain what is meant by 'the nine Zh&acirc;i,' and again by 'the four S&acirc;i,' that I am inclined to doubt, with Wang Yen and others, the genuineness of this paragraph.]</P>
</FONT><P>5. The Hall of Distinction was so called, because in it the rank of the princes was clearly shown as high or low[1].</P>
<P>6. Formerly, when K&acirc;u of Yin was throwing the whole kingdom into confusion, he made dried slices of (the flesh of) the marquis of Kwei[2], and used them in feasting the princes. On this account the duke of K&acirc;u assisted king W&ucirc; in attacking K&acirc;u. When king W&ucirc; died, king Khang being young and weak, the duke took the seat of the son of Heaven[3], and governed the kingdom. During six years he gave audience to all the princes in the Hall of Distinction; instituted ceremonies, made his instruments of music, gave out his (standard) weights and measures[4], and there was a grand submission throughout the kingdom.</P>
<P>7. In the seventh year, he resigned the government to king Khang; and he, in consideration of the duke's services to the kingdom, invested him with (the territory about) Kh&uuml;-f&ucirc;[5], seven hundred l&icirc; square, and sending forth a thousand chariots of</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. See the introduction, vol. xxvii, page 28.</P>
<P>2. 'The marquis of Kwei' appears in Sze-m&acirc; Khien's history of Yin (near the end), as the marquis of Khi&ucirc; (###), and is made into pickle. The reference, no doubt, is to some act of atrocious and wanton cruelty on the part of K&acirc;u.</P>
<P>3. This can only mean that the duke, as regent, administered the government, though the compiler of the Book wanted to exalt his personality beyond the bounds of truth.</P>
<P>4. The text is--measures of length and of capacity.</P>
<P>5. Kh&uuml;-f&ucirc; is still a district city in the department of Yen-k&acirc;u, Shan-tung. It was the capital of L&ucirc;; and is called by foreigners 'the city of Confucius.' It contains the great temple of the sage, and is the residence of his representative-descendant, with thousands of other Khungs.]</P>
</FONT><P>war[1]. He (also) gave charge that (the princes of) L&ucirc;, from generation to generation, should sacrifice to the duke of K&acirc;u with the ceremonies and music proper at a sacrifice by the son of Heaven.</P>
<P>8. Thus it was that the rulers of L&ucirc;, in the first month of spring, rode in a grand carriage, displaying the banner, suspended from its bow-like arm, with the twelve streamers, and having the sun and moon emblazoned on it, to sacrifice to God in the suburb of their metropolis, associating H&acirc;u K&icirc; as his assessor in the service;--according to the ceremonies used by the son of Heaven[2].</P>
<P>9. In the last month of summer, the sixth month, they used the ceremonies of the great sacrifice in sacrificing to the duke of K&acirc;u in the great ancestral temple, employing for the victim to him a white bull. The cups were those with the figure of a victim bull, of an elephant, and of hills and clouds; that for the fragrant spirits was the one with gilt eyes on it. For libations they used the cup of jade with the handle made of a long rank-symbol. The dishes with the offerings were on stands of wood, adorned with jade and carved. The cups for the personator were of jade carved in the same way. There were also the plain cups and those of horn, adorned with round pieces of jade; and for the meat-stands, they used those with four feet and the cross-binders.</P>
<P>10. (The singers) went up to the hall (or stage),</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This is one of the gross exaggerations in the Book. The marquisate of L&ucirc; was only a hundred l&icirc; square on its first constitution.</P>
<P>2. Of this and many of the statements in the paragraphs that follow, see the fourth of the 'Praise Odes of L&ucirc;,' in the Shih, Metrical version, pp. 379-383.]</P>
</FONT><P>and sang the Khing Mi&acirc;o; (in the court) below, (the pantomimes) performed the Hsiang dance[1], to the accompaniment of the wind instruments. With their red shields and jade-adorned axes, and in their caps with pendants, they danced to the music of the T&acirc; W&ucirc;[2]; in their skin caps, and large white skirts gathered at the waist, and jacket of silk, they danced the T&acirc; Hsi&acirc;[3]. There (were also) the Mei, or music of the wild tribes of the East; and the Zan, or music of those of the South. The introduction of these two in the grand temple was to signalise the distinction of L&ucirc; all over the kingdom.</P>
<P>11. The ruler, in his dragon-figured robe and cap with pendants, stood at the eastern steps; and his wife, in her head-dress and embroidered robe, stood in her room. The ruler, with shoulder bared, met the victim at the gate; his wife brought in the stands for the dishes. The ministers and Great officers assisted the ruler; their wives[4] assisted his wife. Each one discharged the duty proper to him or her. Any officer who neglected his duty was severely punished; and throughout the kingdom there was a great acknowledgment of, and submission to, (the worth of the duke of K&acirc;u).</P>
<P>12. (In L&ucirc;) they offered (also) the sacrifices of summer, autumn, and winter (in the ancestral temple); with those at the altars of the land and grain in spring, and that at the autumnal hunt, going on to the great sacrifice of thanksgiving at</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. See vol. xxvii, page 361, paragraph 21.</P>
<P>2. Attributed to king W&ucirc;.</P>
<P>3. Said to be of the Hsi&acirc; dynasty.</P>
<P>4. 'The commissioned wives;' including, according to Khan H&acirc;o, the ruler's 'ladies of honour,' as well as the wives of his ministers and Great officers.]</P>
</FONT><P>the end of the year:--all (after the pattern of) the sacrifices of the son of Heaven.</P>
<P>13. The grand temple (of L&ucirc;) corresponded to the Hall of Distinction of the son of Heaven, the Kh&ucirc; gate of the (marquis's palace) to the K&acirc;o (or outer) gate of the king's, and the Kih gate to the Ying[1]. They shook the bell with the wooden clapper in the court as was done in the royal court, in announcing governmental orders.</P>
<P>14. The capitals of the pillars with hills carved on them, and the pond-weed carving on the small pillars above the beams; the second storey and the great beams projecting under the eaves; the polished pillars and the windows opposite to one another; the earthen stand on which the cups, after being used, were placed; the high stand on which the jade tokens were displayed aloft; and the slightly carved screen:--all these were ornaments of the temple of the son of Heaven[2].</P>
<P>15. (The princes of L&ucirc;) had, as carriages, that of (Shun), the lord of Y&uuml;, furnished with bells; that of the sovereign of Hsi&acirc;, with its carved front; the Great carriage (of wood), or that of Yin; and the carriage (adorned with jade), or that of K&acirc;u.</P>
<P>16. They had, as flags or banners, that of (Shun), the lord of Y&uuml;; the yak's tail of the sovereign of Hsi&acirc;; the great white flag of Yin; and the corresponding red one of K&acirc;u.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The five gates of the royal palace, beginning with the outermost, were the K&acirc;o (###), the Kh&ucirc; (###), the Kih (###), the Ying (###), and the L&ucirc; (###); the palaces of the princes wanted the K&acirc;o and Ying gates. The grand temples appear to have been constructed on a similar plan, to the east of the palace.</P>
<P>2. And in the temple of L&ucirc;, also, it is implied.]</P>
</FONT><P>17. They had the white horses of the sovereign of Hsi&acirc;, with their black manes; the white horses of Yin, with their black heads; and the bay horses of K&acirc;u, with red manes. The sovereigns of Hsi&acirc; preferred black victims; those of Yin, white; and those of K&acirc;u, victims which were red and strong.</P>
<P>18. Of jugs for liquor, they had the earthenware jug of the lord of Y&uuml;; the jug of Hsi&acirc;, with clouds and hills figured on it; the ko of Yin, with no base, which rested directly on the ground; and the jugs of K&acirc;u, with a victim-bull or an elephant on them.</P>
<P>19. For bowls or cups they had the k&acirc;n[1] of Hsi&acirc;; the ki&acirc; of Yin; and the ki&acirc; of K&acirc;u[3].</P>
<P>20. For libations they had the jug of Hsi&acirc;, with a cock on it; the ki&acirc; of Yin; and that of K&acirc;u, with gilt eyes on it.</P>
<P>For ladles they had that of Hsi&acirc;, with the handle ending in a dragon's head; that of Yin, slightly carved all over; and that of K&acirc;u, with the handle like plaited rushes.</P>
<P>21. They had the earthen drum, with clods for the drumstick and the reed pipe,--producing the music of &Icirc;-kh&icirc;[4]; the pillow-like bundles of chaff,</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Made of jade, or adorned with it.</P>
<P>2. With plants of grain figured on it.</P>
<P>3. Also made of, or adorned with, jade.</P>
<P>4. &Icirc;-kh&icirc; is said by Kang to be 'the dynastic title of an ancient son of Heaven.' Many identify him with Shan Nang, who generally follows F&ucirc;-hs&icirc; in the chronology, and who cannot be placed later than the thirty-first century B.C., if we can speak at all of so distant dates. Evidently the compiler is putting down the names of the most ancient instruments which he had heard of. There is in the Khien-lung edition of our collection, chapter 81, Page 5, a representation of the drum and its handle; with a collection of the views about them, contradictory and fantastical, so that it is not worth while to reproduce them here. There is a figure also of the reed pipe, which can only have been something a little superior to the early 'oaten pipe ' of the west.]</P>
</FONT><P>which were struck[1]; the sounding stone of jade; the instruments rubbed or struck, (to regulate the commencement and close of the music)[2]; the great lute and great cithern; the medium lute and little citherns[3]: the musical instruments of the four dynasties.</P>
<P>22. The temple of the duke of L&ucirc; was maintained from generation to generation like that of (king) Wan (in the capital of K&acirc;u), and the temple of duke W&ucirc; in the same way like that of (king) W&ucirc;[4].</P>
<P>23. They had the hsiang (school) of the lord of Y&uuml;, in connexion with which were kept the stores of (sacrificial) rice[5]; the hs&uuml; school of the sovereign of Hsi&acirc;; the school of Yin, in which the blind were</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This also is represented in the Khien-lung edition; but how anything like music could be brought from the pillows I do not know. The two characters, supposed to give the name, are found, perhaps, the Sh&ucirc;, II, iv, 9, used with verbal force of playing on the lute.</P>
<P>2. The K&ucirc; and Y&uuml;; see vol. xxvii, pages 219 and 273.</P>
<P>3. The invention of the lute and cithern is ascribed to F&ucirc;-hs&icirc;. They are represented thus--<IMG SRC="img/03600.gif">.</P>
<P>4. The duke of L&ucirc; here is the first duke, Po-khin (B.C. 1115-1063). Duke W&ucirc; was the ninth duke (B.C. 826-817).</P>
<P>5. As a lesson, it is said, of filial duty.]</P>
</FONT><P>honoured[1]; and the college of K&acirc;u, with its semicircle of water.</P>
<P>24. They had the tripods of Khung[2] and Kwan[2]; the great jade hemisphere; and the tortoise-shell of Fang-f&ucirc;[3]:--all articles (properly) belonging to the son of Heaven. They (also) had the lance of Y&uuml;eh[3]; and the great bow,--military weapons of the son of Heaven.</P>
<P>25. They had the drum of Hsi&acirc; supported on four legs; that of Yin supported on a single pillar; the drums of K&acirc;u, pendent from a stand; the peal of bells of Sui[4]; the differently toned khing (sonorous stones) of Sh&ucirc;[5]; and the organ of N&uuml;-kw&acirc;[6], with its tongues.</P>
<P>26. They had the music-stand of Hsi&acirc;, with its face-board and posts, on which dragons were carved; that of Yin, with the high-toothed face-board; and that of K&acirc;u, with its round ornaments of jade, and feathers (hung from the corners).</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The father of Music, it is said, was here sacrificed to, or had offerings presented to him. All this is very uncertain. Blind men were used as musicians.</P>
<P>2. These are names of states mentioned in the Sh&ucirc;, with which we find king Wan at war.</P>
<P>3. Fang-f&ucirc; must also be the name of an ancient state; but where it was I do not know. Y&uuml;eh was a great state, south of W&ucirc;, on the seaboard.</P>
<P>4. See the Sh&ucirc;, II, i, 21, and note.</P>
<P>5. Sh&ucirc; was also called W&ucirc;-k&acirc;u (###).</P>
<P>6. N&uuml;-kw&acirc; is placed between F&ucirc;-hs&icirc; and Shan Nang. Various fabulous marvels are related of him or her (for many hold the name to be that of a female) in the account of the five T&icirc;s, prefixed to Sze-m&acirc; Khien's histories. The organ is represented-thus--<IMG SRC="img/03700.gif">.]</P>
</FONT><P>27. They had the two tui of the lord of Y&uuml; (for holding the grain at sacrifices); the four lien of Hsi&acirc;; the six h&ucirc; of Yin; and the eight kwei of K&acirc;u[1].</P>
<P>28. They had for stands (on which to set forth the flesh of the victims), the khwan of Shun; the k&uuml;eh of Hsi&acirc;; the k&uuml; of Yin; and the room-like stand of K&acirc;u. For the tall supports of the dishes, they used those of Hsi&acirc; of unadorned wood; those of Yin, adorned with jade; and those of K&acirc;u, with feathers carved on them.</P>
<P>29. They had the plain leather knee-covers of Shun; those of Hsi&acirc;, with hills represented on them; those of Yin, with flames; and those of K&acirc;u, with dragons.</P>
<P>30. They used for their sacrificial offerings (to the father of Cookery), like the lord of Y&uuml;, (portions of) the head; like the sovereigns of Hsi&acirc;, (portions of) the heart; as they did under Yin, (portions of) the liver; and as they did under K&acirc;u, (portions of) the lungs[2].</P>
<P>31. They used the bright water preferred by Hsi&acirc;; the unfermented liquor preferred by Yin; and the completed liquor preferred by K&acirc;u[3].</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Figures of all these are given. The number of the vessels in the different dynasties is thought to have been regulated by the number of the kinds of grain; but most of this is conjecture.</P>
<P>2 Kang Hs&uuml;an, in explanation of these practices, has only three characters, which I confess I do not fully comprehend. Khung Ying-t&acirc; says nothing about them, nor the Khien-lung editors. Fang K&uuml;eh writes, on the relation between the five elements and the five colours, and the symbolical colours adopted by the different dynasties, and of the different members of the victims; very mystically and darkly, and failing to elucidate the passage.</P>
<P>3. There have been various references to these points already, and there will be more hereafter.]</P>
</FONT><P>32. They used (the names) of the 50 officers of the lord of Y&uuml;; of the 100 of thc sovereigns of Hsi&acirc;; of the 200 of Yin; and of the 300 Of K&acirc;u[1].</P>
<P>33. (At their funerals) they used the feathery ornaments of the lord of Y&uuml;; the wrappings of white silk (about the flag-staffs) of the sovereigns of Hsi&acirc;; (the flags) with their toothed edges of Yin; and the round pieces of jade and plumes Of K&acirc;u[2].</P>
<P>34. L&ucirc; (thus) used the robes, vessels and officers of all the four dynasties, and so it observed the royal ceremonies. It long transmitted them everywhere. Its rulers and ministers never killed one another, Its rites, music, punishments, laws, governmental proceedings, manners and customs never changed. Throughout the kingdom it was considered the state which exhibited the right ways; and therefore dependence, was placed on it in the matters of ceremonies and music[3].</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Compare the Sh&ucirc;, V, xx, 3. Various attempts are made to reconcile the statements there and those of this paragraph; 'all,' says Khan H&acirc;o, 'mere conjectures.'</P>
<P>2. Compare paragraph 22, page 139, vol. xxvii.</P>
