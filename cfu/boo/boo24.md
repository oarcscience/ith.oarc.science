### *BLUE COLLAR*

<span class="smallcaps">O You</span> with the collar of blue,  
My heart is longing for you.  
Though to call you I am not free,  
Wherefore not send to me?

O you with the girdle of blue,  
Long, long do I think of you.  
Though to seek you I am not free,  
Wherefore not come to me?

Ah, random and pleasure-drawn,  
To the View Tower you are gone;  
And a day without your sight  
Is like three months in its flight.
