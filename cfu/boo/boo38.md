### *THE FOREST LOVER*

<span class="smallcaps">Këen-Kwan</span> the axles cried,  
As I drove to claim my bride.  
Hunger for her beauty presses,  
I am parched for her caresses;  
Though we lack good company,  
We shall revel—I and she.

Dense the forest in the plain,  
Where the long-tailed pheasants reign;  
Happy is the house that owns her,  
Where a lover's choice enthrones her.  
Pledge me while I praise you, dear!  
Love shall ever need you near.

Though I have but little wine,  
Love makes little cups divine.  
Though but one poor meal await us,  
Simple fare shall amply sate us;  
Though small worth is mine to bring,  
Gaily we will dance and sing.

Yon tall ridges I ascend  
And the stubborn firewood rend.  
When the riven oaks are ringing  
All my thoughts fly homeward winging;  
Though their green abysses hide,  
My whole heart is satisfied.

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Yon dim mountains
disappear,  
On the road the course is clear.  
Gathering hooves go loudly drumming,  
Reins like lute-strings join their thrumming;  
Till beside the open door,  
She is in my arms once more.
