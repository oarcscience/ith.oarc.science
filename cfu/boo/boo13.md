### *II*

### *THE PRAYER OF THE EMPEROR CHING*

<span class="smallcaps">Even</span> as a little helpless child am I,  
On whom hath fallen the perplexed affairs  
Of this unsettled state. High loneliness  
And sorrow are my portion. Thou great Father,  
Thou kingly pattern of parental awe,  
Whose mind for ever in the courts beheld,  
Roaming, the royal image of thy sire,  
Night long and day long, I—the little child—  
Will so be reverent.

                         O ye great kings!  
Your crowned successor crowns you in his heart.  
Live unforgotten. Here, upon the verge  
Of the momentous years, I pause and trace  
The shining footsteps of my forefathers,  
And the far-distant goal that drew them on—  
Too distant for my range. Howe’er resolved  
I may go forward, lo! a thousand tracks  
Cause me to swerve aside. A little child—  
Only a little child—I am too frail  
To cope with the anxieties of state  
And cares of king-craft. Yet I will ascend

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Into my Father's
room, and through the courts  
Below, for ever seeking, I will pass,  
To brush the skirts of inspiration  
And touch the sleeves of memory.

                                     O great  
And gracious Father, hear and condescend  
To guard, to cherish, to enlighten me.
