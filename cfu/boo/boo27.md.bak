### *HAPPY IN HAOU*

<span class="smallcaps">Fishes</span> are there, by the score, I trow,  
Their large heads sleepily showing;  
The King is here, in the city of Haou,  
At ease while the wine-cup's flowing.

Fishes are there in the weeds enow,  
Their long tails lazily swaying;  
The King is here, in the city of Haou,  
Drinking, dreaming, delaying.

The fish lie under the willow bough  
That leans and shadows the rushes;  
The King is here, in the city of Haou,  
At peace, and the wine-cup blushes.
