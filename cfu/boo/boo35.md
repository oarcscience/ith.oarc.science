### *GOOD KING WU*

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> the city of Haou he built his hall,  
With circling waters round the wall:  
From north to south, from east to west  
There was never a tongue but called him blest.  
Great King Wu was a monarch true.

With divination deep, I trow,  
Afar he sought the sight of Haou.  
With tortoise-shell the site he chose,  
And tier by tier the city rose.  
Great King Wu was a monarch true.

By the waters of Fung white millet grew.  
Statesmen wise were the choice of Wu,  
The future reaped whate’er he planned;  
His son was lord of a grateful land.  
Good King Wu was a monarch true.
