### *ON THE BANKS OF HO*

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> little boat of cypress rocks,  
Rocks in the midst of Ho;  
He was my lord, whose long dark locks  
Divided in their downward flow.  
Till death betide,  
His bride,  
I'll wed no other.  
O Heaven! O mother!  
Will you not understand your child?

The little boat of cypress rocks  
There by the side of Ho;  
He was my only one, whose locks  
Divided in their downward flow.  
Till death betide,  
His bride,  
I'll wed no other.  
O Heaven! O mother!  
Far from me be the thing defiled!  
Will you not understand your child?
