### *I*

### *THE PRAYER OF THE EMPEROR CHING*

<span class="smallcaps">Let</span> me be reverent, be reverent,  
Even as the way of Heaven is evident,  
And its appointment easy is to mar.

Let me not say, "It is too high above,"  
Above us and below us doth it move,  
And daily watches wheresoe’er we are.

It is but as a little child I ask,  
Without intelligence to do my task,  
Yet learning, month by month, and day by day.

I will hold fast some gleams of knowledge bright.  
Help me to bear my heavy burden right,  
And show me how to walk in wisdom's way.
