### *SORROW*

<span class="smallcaps">She</span> sought her native land again.  
*The swallow takes its ragged flight.  
*We went together day and night,  
Till parting drew her from my sight  
And the tears fell down like rain.

She went her native land to seek.  
*Now up, now down the swallow flies.  
*And oh!—the last of tender ties,  
The form that fades from aching eyes  
And the tears coursing down my cheek.

*Around, about the swallows dar  
*She fared into a far countree,  
And when I vainly sought to see  
The empty landscape mocked at me,  
And great grief settled on my heart.
