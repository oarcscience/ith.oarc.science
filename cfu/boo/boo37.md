### *WITHOUT HER*

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> moon comes forth in her brightness;  
Fair as the moon was she,  
That bright and beautiful lady  
Who lit the night for me.  
Would that I saw her now,  
With the stars around her brow.

The moon comes forth in her splendour;  
Fair through the void she burns,  
That pale and beautiful lady,  
My moon, no more returns;  
But under the alien skies  
She shines in a stranger's eyes.

The moon comes forth in her glory;  
Kind to the world is she.  
That kind and beautiful lady,  
Doth charm no night for me.  
Oh, when the dawn-star wanes  
For the sun to rend my chains!
