### *THROUGH EASTERN GATES*

<span class="smallcaps">Through</span> eastern gates I wandered far,  
Where cloud-like beauties thronged the way;  
Although like clouds their faces are,  
My thoughts among them would not stay.  
She in rough silk and kerchief blue  
Gave me the only joy I knew.

I wandered by the curtain tower,  
Like flowering rushes were the maids;  
Although they match the rushes' flower,  
Soon from my mind their beauty fades.  
In humble silk and madder dye,  
She fills my heart with ecstasy.
