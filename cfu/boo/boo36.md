### *FAINT HEART*

<span class="smallcaps">I pray</span> you, dear,  
My little hamlet leave,  
Nor break my willow-boughs;  
’Tis not that I should grieve,  
But I fear my sire to rouse.  
Love pleads with passion disarrayed,—  
"A sire's commands must be obeyed."

I pray you, dear,  
Leap not across my wall,  
Nor break my mulberry-boughs;  
Not that I fear their fall,  
But, lest my brother's wrath should rouse,  
Love pleads with passion disarrayed,—  
"A brother's words must be obeyed."

I pray you, dear,  
Steal not my garden down,  
Nor break my sandal-trees;  
Not that I care for these,  
But, oh! I dread the talk of town.  
Should lovers have their wilful way,  
Whatever would the neighbours say?
