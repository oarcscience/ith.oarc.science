<p><FONT SIZE="-1">There is no difficulty or difference in the interpretation of this piece; and it brings us down to B.C. 621. Then died duke M&ucirc;, after playing an important part in the north-west of China for thirty-nine years. The &#540;o <I>K</I>wan, under the sixth year of duke Wan, makes mention of M&ucirc;'s requiring that the three brothers here celebrated should be buried with him, and of the composition of this piece in consequence. Sze-m&acirc; <I>Kh</I>ien says that this barbarous practice began with M&ucirc;'s predecessor, with whom sixty-six persons were buried alive, and that one hundred and seventy-seven in all were buried with M&ucirc;. The death of the last distinguished man of the House of <I>Kh</I>in, the emperor I, was subsequently celebrated by the entombment with him of all the inmates of his harem.</FONT></p>

Some say that it is this,--that the people loved the three victims as they liked the birds; others that the birds among the trees were in their proper place,--very different from the brothers in the grave of duke M&ucirc;.</P>
