### BOOK III. THE SONGS OF THE FIVE SONS.

This Book ranks in that class of the documents of the Shû which goes by
the name of 'Instructions.' Though the form of it be poetical, the
subject-matter is derived from the Lessons left by Yü for the guidance
of his posterity.

Thâi Khang succeeded to his father in B.C. 2188, and his reign continues
in chronology to 2160. His character is given here in the introductory
chapter. Khiung, the principality of Î who took the field against him,
is identified with the sub-department of Tê-*K*âu, department *K*î-nan,
Shan-tung. There is a tradition that Î, at an early period of his life,
was lord of a state in the present Ho-nan. This would make his movement
against Thâi Khang, 'south of the Ho,' more easy for him. The name of
Thâi Khang remains in the district so called of the department
*Kh*ăn-*k*âu, Ho-nan. There, it is said, he died, having never been able
to recross the Ho.

In his song the king's first brother deplores how he had lost the
affections of the people; the second speaks of his dissolute
extravagance; the third mourns his loss of the throne; the fourth
deplores his departure from the principles of Yü, and its disastrous
consequences; and the fifth is a wail over the miserable condition of
them all.

1\. Thâi Khang occupied the throne like a personator of the dead <span
id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_87.md). By idleness and dissipation he
extinguished his virtue, till the black-haired people all wavered in
their allegiance. He, however, pursued his pleasure and wanderings
without any

self-restraint. He went out to hunt beyond the Lo, and a hundred days
elapsed without his returning. (On this) Î, the prince of *Kh*iung,
taking advantage of the discontent of the people, resisted (his return)
on (the south of) the Ho. The (king's) five brothers had attended their
mother in following him, and were waiting for him on the north of the
Lo; and (when they heard of Î's movement), all full of dissatisfaction,
they related the Cautions of the great Yü in the form of songs.

2\. The first said,

It was the lesson of our great ancestor:--  
The people should be cherished,  
And not looked down upon.  
The people are the root of a country;  
The root firm, the country is tranquil.  
When I look at all under heaven,  
Of the simple men and simple women,  
Any one may surpass me.  
If the One man err repeatedly <span id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_88.md),  
Should dissatisfaction be waited for till it appears?  
Before it is seen, it should be guarded against.  
In my dealing with the millions of the people,  
I should feel as much anxiety as if I were driving six horses with
rotten reins.  
The ruler of men--  
How should he be but reverent (of his duties)?'

The second said,  
It is in the Lessons:--  
When the palace is a wild of lust,  
And the country is a wild for hunting; <span id="page_80">p. 80</span>  
When spirits are liked, and music is the delight;  
When there are lofty roofs and carved walls;--  
The existence of any one of these things  
Has never been but the prelude to ruin.'

The third said,  
'There was. the lord of Thâo and Thang <span
id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_89.md)  
Who possessed this region of *K*î.  
Now we have fallen from his ways,  
And thrown into confusion his rules and laws;--  
The consequence is extinction and ruin.'

The fourth said,  
Brightly intelligent was our ancestor,  
Sovereign of the myriad regions.  
He had canons, he had patterns,  
Which he transmitted to his posterity.  
The standard stone and the equalizing quarter  
Were in the royal treasury.  
Wildly have we dropt the clue he gave us,  
Overturning our temple, and extinguishing our sacrifices.'\*

The fifth said,  
'Oh! whither shall we turn?  
The thoughts in my breast make me sad  
All the people are hostile to us;  
On whom can we rely?  
Anxieties crowd together in our hearts;  
Thick as are our faces, they are covered with blushes.  
We have not been careful of our virtue;  
And though we repent, we cannot over-take the past.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_87"></span>[78:1](sbe03015.htm#fr_91.md) The character that
here as a verb governs the character signifying 'throne' means properly
'a corpse,' and is often used for the personator of the dead, in the
sacrificial services to the dead which formed a large part of the
religious ceremonies of the ancient Chinese. A common definition of it
is 'the semblance of the spirit,' = the image into which the spirit
entered. Thâi Khang was but a personator on the throne, no better than a
sham sovereign.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[79:1](sbe03015.htm#fr_92.md) Any king, in the
person of Yü, may be understood to be the speaker.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[80:1](sbe03015.htm#fr_93.md) The lord of Thâo and
Thang is Yâo, who was lord of the principalities of Thâo and Thang, but
of which first and which last is uncertain, before his accession to the
throne. *K*î is the *K*î *K*âu of the Tribute of Yü.
