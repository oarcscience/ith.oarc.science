#### ODE 8. THE *KH*ÜAN Â.

#### ADDRESSED, PROBABLY, BY THE DUKE OF SHÂO TO KING *KH*ĂNG, DESIRING FOR HIM LONG PROSPERITY, AND CONGRATULATING HIM, IN ORDER TO ADMONISH HIM, ON THE HAPPINESS OF HIS PEOPLE, THE NUMBER OF HIS ADMIRABLE OFFICERS, AND THE AUSPICIOUS OMEN ARISING FROM THE APPEARANCE OF THE PHŒNIX.

The duke of Shâo was the famous Shih, who appears in the fifth and other
Books of the fifth Part of the Shû, the colleague of the duke of *K*âu
in the early days of the *K*âu dynasty. This piece may have been
composed by him, but there is no evidence in it that it was so. The
assigning it to him rests entirely on the authority of the preface. The
language, however, is that in which an old statesman of that time might
express his complacency in his young sovereign.

Into the recesses of the large mound Came the wind, whirling from the
south. There was (our) happy, courteous sovereign, Rambling and singing;
And I took occasion to give forth my notes.

'Full of spirits you ramble; Full of satisfaction you rest. O happy and
courteous sovereign, May you fulfil your years, And end them like your
ancestors!'

'Your territory is great and glorious, And perfectly

<span id="page_405">p. 405</span>

secure. O happy and courteous sovereign, May you fulfil your years, As
the host of all the spirits <span id="fr_567"></span>[1](#fn_547.md)!

'You have received the appointment long acknowledged, With peace around
your happiness and dignity. O happy and courteous sovereign, May you
fulfil your years, With pure happiness your constant possession!

'You have helpers and supporters, Men of filial piety and of virtue, To
lead you on, and act as wings to you, (So that), O happy and courteous
sovereign, You are a pattern to the four quarters (of the kingdom).

'Full of dignity and majesty (are they), Like a

<span id="page_406">p. 406</span>

jade-mace(in its purity), The subject of praise, the contemplation of
hope. O happy and courteous sovereign, (Through them) the four quarters
(of the kingdom) are guided by you.

'The male and female phœnix fly about <span
id="fr_568"></span>[1](#fn_548.md), Their wings rustling, While they settle
in their proper resting-place. Many are your admirable officers, O king,
Ready to be employed by you, Loving you, the Son of Heaven.

'The male and female phœnix fly about, Their wings rustling, As they
soar up to heaven. Many are your admirable officers, O king, Waiting for
your commands, And loving the multitudes of the people, The male and
female phœnix give out their notes, On that lofty ridge. The dryandras
grow, On those eastern slopes. They grow luxuriantly; And harmoniously
the notes resound.

<span id="page_407">p. 407</span>

'Your chariots, O sovereign, Are numerous, many. Your horses, O
sovereign, Are well trained and fleet. I have made my few verses, In
prolongation of your song.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_547"></span>[405:1](sbe03141.htm#fr_567.md) 'Host of the
hundred--i.e., of all--the spirits' is one of the titles of the
sovereign of China. It was and is his prerogative to offer the great
'border sacrifices' to Heaven and Earth, or, as Confucius explains.
them, to God, and to the spirits of his ancestors in his ancestral
temple; and in his progresses (now neglected), among the states, to the
spirits of the hills and 'rivers throughout the kingdom. Every feudal
prince could only sacrifice to the hills and streams within his own
territory. Under the changed conditions of the government of China, the
sacrificial ritual of the emperor still retains the substance of
whatever belonged to the sovereigns in this respect from the earliest
dynasties. On the text here, Khung Ying-tâ of the Thang dynasty said,
'He who possesses all under the sky, sacrifices to all the spirits, and
thus he is the host of them all.' *K*û Hsî said on it, 'And always be
the host of (the spirits of) Heaven and Earth, of the hills and rivers,
and of the departed.' The term 'host' does not imply any superiority of
rank on the part of the entertainer. In the greatest sacrifices the
emperor acknowledges himself as 'the servant or subject of Heaven.' See
the prayer of the first of the present Manchâu line of emperors, in
announcing that he had ascended the throne, at the altar of Heaven and
Earth, in 1644, as translated by the Rev. Dr. Edkins in the chapter on
Imperial Worship, in the recent edition of his 'Religion in China.'

<span id="fn_548"></span>[406:1](sbe03141.htm#fr_568.md) The phœnix (so the
creature has been named) is a fabulous bird, 'the chief of the 360
classes of the winged tribes.' It is mentioned in the fourth Book of the
second Part of the Shû, as appearing in the courtyard of Shun; and the
appearance of a pair of them has always been understood to denote a sage
on the throne and prosperity in the country. Even Confucius (Analects,
IX, viii) could not express his hopelessness about his own times more
strongly than by saying that 'the phœnix did not make its appearance.'
He was himself also called 'a phœnix,' in derision, by one of the
recluses of his time (Analects, XVIII, v). The type of' the bird was,
perhaps, the Argus pheasant, but the descriptions of it are of a
monstrous creature, having' a fowl's head, a swallow's chin, a serpent's
neck, a fish's tail,' &c. It only lights on the dryandra cordifolia, of
which tree also many marvellous stories are related. The poet is not to
be understood as saying that the phœnix actually appeared; but that the
king was Age and his government prosperous, as if it had appeared.
