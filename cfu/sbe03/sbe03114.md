#### ODE 2, STANZAS I AND 2. THE HSIÂO YÜAN.

#### SOME OFFICER IN A TIME OF DISORDER AND MISGOVERNMENT URGES ON HIS BROTHERS THE DUTY OF MAINTAINING THEIR OWN VIRTUE, AND OF OBSERVING THE GREATEST CAUTION.

Small is the cooing dove, But it flies aloft to heaven. My heart is
wounded with sorrow, And I think of our forefathers. When the dawn is
breaking, and I cannot sleep, The thoughts in my breast are of our
parents.

Men who are grave and wise, Though they drink, are mild and masters of
themselves; But those who are benighted and ignorant Become devoted to
drink, and more so daily. Be careful, each of you, of your deportment;
What Heaven confers, (when once lost), is not regained <span
id="fr_436"></span>[1](#fn_422).

The greenbeaks come and go, Picking up grain about the stackyard. Alas
for the distressed and the solitary, Deemed fit inmates for the prisons!
With a handful of grain I go out and divine <span
id="fr_437"></span>[2](#fn_423), How I may be able to become good.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_422"></span>[359:1](sbe03114.htm#fr_436) 'What Heaven
confers' is, probably, the good human nature which by vice, and
especially by drunkenness, may be irretrievably ruined.

<span id="fn_423"></span>[359:2](sbe03114.htm#fr_437) A religious act is
here referred to, on which we have not sufficient information to be able
to throw much light. It was the practice to spread some finely ground
rice on the ground, in connexion with divination, as an offering to the
spirits. The poet represents himself here as using a handful of grain
for the purpose,--probably on account of his poverty.
