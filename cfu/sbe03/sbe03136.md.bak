### The Second Decade, or that of Shăng Min.

#### ODE 1. THE SHĂNG MIN.

#### THE LEGEND OF HÂU-*K*Î:--HIS CONCEPTION; HIS BIRTH; THE PERILS OF HIS INFANCY; HIS BOYISH HABITS OF AGRICULTURE; HIS SUBSEQUENT METHODS AND TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE; HIS FOUNDING OF CERTAIN SACRIFICES; AND THE HONOURS OF SACRIFICE PAID TO HIM BY THE HOUSE OF KÂU.

Of Hâu-*k*î there is some notice on the tenth ode of the first decade of
the Sacrificial Odes of *K*âu. To him the kings of *K*âu traced their
lineage. Of *K*iang Yüan, his mother, our knowledge is very scanty. It
is said that she was a daughter of the House of Thâi, which traced its
lineage up to Shăn-nung in prehistoric times. From the first stanza of
this piece it appears that she was married, and had been so for some
time without having any child. But who her husband was it is impossible
to say with certainty. As the *K*âu surname was *K*î, he must have been
one of the descendants of Hwang Tî.

The first birth of (our) people <span id="fr_551"></span>[2](#fn_532.md)
Was from *K*iang Yüan. How did she give birth to (our) people She had
presented a pure offering and sacrificed <span
id="fr_552"></span>[3](#fn_533.md),

<span id="page_397">p. 397</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> That her
childlessness might be taken away. She then trod on a toe-print made by
God, and was moved <span id="fr_553"></span>[1](#fn_534.md), In the large
place where she rested. She became pregnant; she dwelt retired; She gave
birth to, and nourished (a son), Who was Hâu-*k*î.

When she had fulfilled her months, Her firstborn son (came forth) like a
lamb. There was no bursting, nor rending, No injury, no hurt; Showing
how wonderful he would be. Did not God give her the comfort? Had he not
accepted her pure offering and sacrifice, So that thus easily she
brought forth her son?

He was placed in a narrow lane, But the sheep and oxen protected him
with loving care <span id="fr_554"></span>[2](#fn_535.md). He was placed in
a wide forest, Where he was met with by the wood-cutters. He was placed
on the cold ice, And a bird screened and supported him with its wings.
When the bird went away, Hâu-*k*î began to wail. His cry was long and
loud, So that his voice filled the whole way <span
id="fr_555"></span>[2](#fn_535.md).

<span id="page_398">p. 398</span>

When he was able to crawl, He looked majestic and intelligent. When he
was able to feed himself, He fell to planting beans. The beans grew
luxuriantly; His rows of paddy shot up beautifully; His hemp and wheat
grew strong and close; His gourds yielded abundantly.

The husbandry of Hâu-*k*î Proceeded on the plan of helping (the growth).
Having cleared away the thick grass, He sowed the ground with the yellow
cereals. He managed the living grain, till it was ready to burst; Then
he used it as seed, and it sprang up; It grew and came into car; It
became strong and good; It hung down, every grain complete; And thus he
was appointed lord of Thâi <span id="fr_556"></span>[1](#fn_536.md).

He gave (his people) the beautiful grains;--The black millet and the
double-kernelled, The tall red and the white. They planted extensively
the black and the double-kernelled, Which were reaped and stacked on the
ground. They planted extensively the tall red and the white, Which were
carried on their shoulders and backs, Home for the sacrifices which he
founded <span id="fr_557"></span>[2](#fn_537.md).

And how as to our sacrifices (continued from him)?

<span id="page_399">p. 399</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Some hull (the
grain); some take it from the mortar; Some sift it; some tread it. It is
rattling in the dishes; It is distilled, and the steam floats about. We
consult <span id="fr_558"></span>[1](#fn_538.md); we observe the rites of
purification; We take southernwood and offer it with the fat; We
sacrifice a ram to the spirit of the path <span
id="fr_559"></span>[2](#fn_539.md); We offer roast flesh and broiled:--And
thus introduce the coming year <span id="fr_560"></span>[3](#fn_540.md).

We load the stands with the offerings, The stands both of wood and of
earthenware. As soon as the fragrance ascends, God, well pleased, smells
the sweet savour. Fragrant it is, and in its due season <span
id="fr_561"></span>[4](#fn_541.md). Hâu-*k*î founded our sacrifices, And no
one, we presume, has given occasion for blame or regret in regard to
them, Down to the present day.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_532"></span>[396:2](sbe03136.htm#fr_551.md) Our 'people' is of
course the people of *K*âu. The whole piece is about the individual from
whom the House of *K*âu sprang, of which were the kings of the dynasty
so called.

<span id="fn_533"></span>[396:3](sbe03136.htm#fr_552.md) To whom *K*iang
Yüan sacrificed and prayed we are not told, but I receive the impression
that it was to God,--see the next stanza,--and that she did so all alone
with the special object which is mentioned.

<span id="fn_534"></span>[397:1](sbe03136.htm#fr_553.md) The 'toe-print
made by God' has occasioned much speculation of the critics. We may
simply draw the conclusion that the poet meant to have his readers
believe with him that the conception of his hero was supernatural. We
saw in the third of the Sacrificial Odes of Shang that there was also a
legend assigning a præternatural birth to the father of the House of
Shang.

<span id="fn_535"></span>[397:2](sbe03136.htm#fr_555.md) It does not appear
from the ode who exposed the infant to these various perils; nor did
Chinese tradition ever fashion any story on the subject. Mâo makes the
exposure to have been made by *K*iang Yüan's husband, dissatisfied with
what had taken place; *K*ăng, by the mother herself, to show the more
the wonderful character of her child. Readers will compare the accounts
with the Roman legends about Romulus and Remus, their mother and her
father; but the two legends differ according to the different
characters, of the Chinese and Roman peoples.

<span id="fn_536"></span>[398:1](sbe03136.htm#fr_556.md) Hâu-*k*î's mother,
we have seen, was a princess of Thâi, in the present district of
Wû-kung, *Kh*ien *K*âu, Shen-hsî. This may have led to his appointment
to that principality, and the transference of the lordship from *K*iangs
to *K*îs. Evidently he was appointed to that dignity for his services in
the promotion of agriculture. Still be has not displaced the older
Shan-nung, with whom on his father's side he had a connexion, as 'the
Father of Husbandry.'

<span id="fn_537"></span>[398:2](sbe03136.htm#fr_557.md) This is not to be
understood of sacrifice in general, as if there had been no such thing
before Hâu-*k*î; but of the sacrifices of the of House of *K*âu,--those
in the ancestral temple and others,--which began with him as its great
ancestor.

<span id="fn_538"></span>[399:1](sbe03136.htm#fr_558.md) That is, we divine
about the day, and choose the officers to take part in the service.

<span id="fn_539"></span>[399:2](sbe03136.htm#fr_559.md) A sacrifice was
offered to the spirit of the road on commencing a journey, and we see
here that it was offered also in connexion with the king's going to the
ancestral temple or the border altar.

<span id="fn_540"></span>[399:3](sbe03136.htm#fr_560.md) It does not appear
clearly what sacrifices the poet had in view here. I think they must be
all those in which the kings of *K*âu appeared as the principals or
sacrificers. The concluding line is understood to intimate that the
kings were not to forget that a prosperous agriculture was the
foundation of their prosperity.

<span id="fn_541"></span>[399:4](sbe03136.htm#fr_561.md) In this stanza we
have the peculiar honour paid to Hâu-*k*î by his descendants at one of
the great border sacrifices to God,--the same to which the last ode in
the first decade of the Sacrificial Odes of *K*âu belongs.
