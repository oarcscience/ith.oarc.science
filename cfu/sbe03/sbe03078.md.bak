##### ODE 9. THE *K*IH *K*ING.

##### AN ODE APPROPRIATE IN SACRIFICING TO THE KINGS WÛ, *KH*ĂNG, AND KHANG.

The Chinese critics differ in the interpretation of this ode, the
Preface and older scholars restricting it to a sacrifice to king Wû,
while *K*û Hsî and others find reference in it, as to me also seems most
natural, to *Kh*ăng and Khang, who succeeded him.

The arm of king Wû was full of strength; Irresistible was his ardour.
Greatly illustrious were *Kh*ăng and Khang <span
id="fr_365"></span>[1](#fn_353.md), Kinged by God.

When we consider how *Kh*ăng and Khang Grandly held all within the four
quarters (of the kingdom), How penetrating was their intelligence!

The bells and drums sound in harmony; The sounding-stones and flutes
blend their notes; Abundant blessing is sent down.

Blessing is sent down in large measure. Careful and exact is all our
deportment; We have drunk, and we have eaten, to the fall; Our happiness
and dignity will be prolonged.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_353"></span>[319:1](sbe03078.htm#fr_365.md) If the whole piece
be understood only of a sacrifice to Wû, this line will have to be
translated--'How illustrious was he, who completed (his great work), and
secured its tranquillity.' We must deal similarly with the next line.
This construction is very forced; nor is the text clear on the view of
*K*û Hsî.
