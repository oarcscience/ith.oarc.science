##### ODE 10. THE SZE WĂN.

##### APPROPRIATE TO ONE OF THE BORDER SACRIFICES, WHEN HÂU-*K*Î WAS WORSHIPPED AS THE CORRELATE OF GOD, AND CELEBRATING HIM.

Hâu-*k*î was the same as *Kh*î, who appears in Part II of the Shû as
Minister of Agriculture to Yâo and Shun, and co-operating with

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Yü in his labours
on the flooded land. The name Hâu belongs to him as lord of Thâi; that
of *K*î, as Minister of Agriculture. However the combination arose,
Hâu-*k*î became historically the name of *Kh*î of the time of Yâo and
Shun, the ancestor to whom the kings of *K*âu traced their lineage. He
was to the people the Father of Husbandry, who first taught men to
plough and sow and reap. Hence, when the kings offered sacrifice and
prayer to God at the commencement of spring for his blessing on the
labours of the year, they associated Hâu-*k*î with him at the service.

O accomplished Hâu-*k*î, Thou didst prove thyself the correlate of
Heaven. Thou didst give grain-food to our multitudes:--The immense gift
of thy goodness. Thou didst confer on us the wheat and the barley, Which
God appointed for the nourishment of all. And without distinction of
territory or boundary, The rules of social duty were diffused throughout
these great regions.
