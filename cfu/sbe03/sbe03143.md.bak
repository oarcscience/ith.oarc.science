#### ODE 10. THE PAN.

#### AN OFFICER OF EXPERIENCE MOURNS OVER THE PREVAILING MISERY; COMPLAINS OF THE WANT OF SYMPATHY WITH HIM SHOWN BY OTHER OFFICERS; ADMONISHES THEM, AND SETS FORTH THE DUTY REQUIRED OF THEM, ESPECIALLY IN THE ANGRY MOOD IN WHICH IT MIGHT SEEM THAT HEAVEN WAS.

This piece, like the last, is assigned to the time of king Lî.

God has reversed (his usual course of procedure) <span
id="fr_570"></span>[1](#fn_550.md), And the lower people are full of
distress. The words which you utter are not right; The plans which you
form are not far-reaching. As there are not sages, you think you have no
guidance;--You have no real sincerity. (Thus) your plans do not reach
far, And I therefore strongly admonish you.

Heaven is now sending down calamities;--Do not be so complacent. Heaven
is now producing such movements;--Do not be so indifferent. If your
words were harmonious, The people would become united. If your words
were gentle and kind, The people would be settled.

Though my duties are different from yours, I am your fellow-servant. I
come to advise with you, And you hear me with contemptuous indifference,
My words are about the (present urgent) affairs;--Do not think them
matter for laughter. The ancients had a saying:--'Consult the gatherers
of grass and firewood <span id="fr_571"></span>[2](#fn_551.md).'

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

Heaven is now exercising oppression;--Do not in such a way make a mock
of things. An old man, (I speak) with entire sincerity; But you, my
juniors, are full of pride. It is not that my words are those of age,
But you make a joke of what is sad. But the troubles will multiply like
flames, Till they are beyond help or remedy.

Heaven is now displaying its anger;--Do not be either boastful or
flattering, Utterly departing from all propriety of demeanour, Till good
men are reduced to personators of the dead <span
id="fr_572"></span>[1](#fn_552.md). The people now sigh and groan, And we
dare not examine (into the causes of their trouble). The ruin and
disorder are exhausting all their means of living, And we show no
kindness to our multitudes.

Heaven enlightens the people <span id="fr_573"></span>[2](#fn_553.md), As
the bamboo flute responds to the earthen whistle; As two half-maces form
a whole one; As you take a thing, and bring it away in your hand,
Bringing it away, without any more ado. The enlightenment of the people
is very easy. They have (now) many perversities;--Do not you set up your
perversity before them.

Good men are a fence; The multitudes of the people are a wall; Great
states are screens; Great families are buttresses;--The cherishing of
virtue

<span id="page_410">p. 410</span>

secures repose; The circle of (the king's) relatives is a fortified
wall. We must not let the fortified wall get destroyed; We must not let
(the king) be solitary and consumed with terrors.

Revere the anger of Heaven, And presume not to make sport or be idle.
Revere the changing moods of Heaven, And presume not to drive about (at
your pleasure). Great Heaven is intelligent, And is with you in all your
goings. Great Heaven is clear-seeing, And is with you in your wanderings
and indulgences.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_550"></span>[408:1](sbe03143.htm#fr_570.md) The proof of God's
having reversed his usual course of procedure was to be found in the
universal misery of the people, whose good He was understood to desire,
and for the securing of which government by righteous kings was
maintained by him.

<span id="fn_551"></span>[408:2](sbe03143.htm#fr_571.md) If ancient
worthies thought that persons in such mean employments were to he
consulted surely, the advice of the writer deserved to be taken into
account by his comrades.

<span id="fn_552"></span>[409:1](sbe03143.htm#fr_572.md) During all the
time of the sacrifice, the personators of the dead said not a word, but
only ate and drank. To the semblance of them good men were now reduced.

<span id="fn_553"></span>[409:2](sbe03143.htm#fr_573.md) The meaning is,
that Heaven has so attuned the mind to virtue, that, if good example
were set before the people, they would certainly and readily follow it.
This is illustrated by various instances of things, in which the one
succeeded the other freely and as it necessarily; so that government by
virtue was really very easy.
