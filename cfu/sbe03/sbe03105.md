#### ODE 6. THE THIEN PÂO.

#### A FESTAL ODE, RESPONSIVE TO ANY OF THE FIVE THAT PRECEDE IT. THE KING'S OFFICERS AND GUESTS, HAVING BEEN FEASTED BY HIM, CELEBRATE HIS PRAISES, AND DESIRE FOR HIM THE BLESSING OF HEAVEN AND HIS ANCESTORS.

Ascribed, like the former, to the duke of *K*âu.

Heaven protects and establishes thee, With the greatest. security; Makes
thee entirely virtuous.

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> That thou mayest
enjoy every happiness; Grants thee much increase, So that thou hast all
in abundance.

Heaven protects and establishes thee. It grants thee all excellence, So
that thine every matter is right, And thou receivest every Heavenly
favour. It sends down to thee long-during happiness, Which the days are
not sufficient to enjoy.

Heaven protects and establishes thee, So that in everything thou dost
prosper. Like the high hills and the mountain masses, Like the topmost
ridges and the greatest bulks, Like the stream ever coming on, Such is
thine increase.

With happy auspices and purifications thou bringest the offerings, And
dost filially present them, In spring, summer, autumn, and winter, To
the dukes and former kings <span id="fr_419"></span>[1](#fn_405); And
they say, 'We give to thee myriads of years, duration unlimited <span
id="fr_420"></span>[2](#fn_406).'

The spirits come <span id="fr_421"></span>[3](#fn_407), And confer on
thee many blessings. The people are simple and honest, Daily enjoying
their meat, and drink. All the black-haired race, in all their surnames,
Universally practise thy virtue.

Like the moon advancing to the full, Like the sun ascending the heavens,
Like the everlasting southern hills, Never waning, never falling, Like

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

the luxuriance of the fir and the cypress;--May such be thy succeeding
line!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_405"></span>[348:1](sbe03105.htm#fr_419) These dukes and
former kings are all the ancestors of the royal House of *K*âu,
sacrificed to at the four seasons of the year.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[348:2](sbe03105.htm#fr_420) Here we have the
response of the dukes and kings communicated to the sacrificing king by
the individuals chosen to represent them at the service.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[348:3](sbe03105.htm#fr_421) The spirits here
are, of course, those of the former dukes and kings.
