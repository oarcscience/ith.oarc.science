#### ODE 3, STANZA 2. THE *K*ÜN-ȜZE KIEH LÂO.

#### CONTRAST BETWEEN THE BEAUTY AND SPLENDOUR OF HSÜAN *K*IANG AND HER VICIOUSNESS.

Hsüan *K*iang was a princess of *Kh*î, who, towards the close of the
seventh century B.C., became wife to the marquis of Wei, known as duke
Hsüan. She was beautiful and unfortunate, but various things are related
of her indicative of the grossest immoralities prevailing in the court
of Wei.

How rich and splendid Is her pheasant-figured

robe <span id="fr_623"></span>[1](#fn_603.md)! Her black hair in masses
like clouds, No false locks does she descend to. There are her earplugs
of jade, Her comb-pin of ivory, And her high forehead, so white. She
appears like a visitant from heaven! She appears like a goddess <span

introduced arrayed in the gorgeous robes worn by the princess of a state
in the ancestral temple.

<span id="fn_604"></span>[436:2](sbe03162.htm#fr_624.md) P. Lacharme
translated these two concluding lines by 'Tu primo aspectu coelos
(pulchritudine), et imperatorem (majestate) adaequas,' without any
sanction of the Chinese critics; and moreover there was no Tî (<span
id="img_43600"></span> ![](img/43600.jpg)) in the sense of imperator
then in China. The sovereigns of *K*âu were Wang or kings. *K*û Hsî
expands the lines thus:--'Such is the beauty of her robes and
appearance, that beholders are struck with awe, as if she were a
spiritual being.' Hsü *Kh*ien (Yüan dynasty) deals with them thus:--With
such splendour of beauty and dress, how is it that she is here? She has
come down from heaven I She is a spiritual being!'
