<p><FONT SIZE="-1">If this ode were not intended to do honour to W&ucirc;-ting, the K&acirc;o &#540;ung of Shang, we cannot account for the repeated mention of him in it. <I>K</I>&ucirc; Hs&icirc;, however, in his note on it, says nothing about W&ucirc;-ting, but simply that the piece belonged to the sacrifices in the ancestral temple, tracing back the line of the kings of Shang to its origin, and to its attaining the sovereignty of the kingdom. Not at all unlikely is the view of <I>K</I>&#259;ng Hs&uuml;an, that the sacrifice was in the third year after the death of W&ucirc;-ting and offered to him in the temple of Hsieh, the ancestor of the Shang dynasty.</FONT></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_325"></A><A HREF="sbe03067.htm#fr_337">307:1</A> The father of Shang is Hsieh, who has already been mentioned. The mother of Hsieh was a daughter of the House of the ancient state of Sung, and a concubine of the ancient ruler Kh&ucirc; (B.C. 2435). According to M&acirc;o, she accompanied Kh&ucirc;, at the time of the vernal equinox, when the swallow made its appearance, to sacrifice and pray to the first match-maker, and the result was the birth of Hsieh. Sze-m&acirc; <I>Kh</I>ien and <I>K</I>&#259;ng make Hsieh's birth more marvellous:--The lady was bathing in some open place, when a swallow made its appearance, and dropt an egg, which she took and swallowed; and from this came Hsieh. The editors of the imperial edition of the Shih, of the present dynasty, say we need not believe the legends;--the important point is to believe that the birth of Hsieh was specially ordered by Heaven.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_326"></A><A HREF="sbe03067.htm#fr_338">307:2</A> 'The nine regions' are the nine provinces into which Y&uuml; divided the kingdom.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_327"></A><A HREF="sbe03067.htm#fr_339">308:1</A> That is, Thang.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_328"></A><A HREF="sbe03067.htm#fr_340">308:2</A> If this ode were used, as <I>K</I>&#259;ng supposes, in the third year after W&ucirc;-ting's death, this 'descendant' would be his son Z&ucirc;-kang, B.C. 1265 to 1259.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_329"></A><A HREF="sbe03067.htm#fr_341">308:3</A> This expression, which occurs also in the Sh&ucirc;, indicates that the early Chinese believed that their country extended to the sea, east, west, north, and south.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_330"></A><A HREF="sbe03067.htm#fr_342">308:4</A> <I>K</I>&ucirc; Hs&icirc; Says he did not understand this line; but there is ground in the &#540;o <I>K</I>wan for our believing that <I>K</I>ing was the name of a hill in the region where the capital of Shang was.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_331"></A><A HREF="sbe03067.htm#fr_343">308:5</A> We saw in the Sh&ucirc; that the name Shang gave place to Yin after the time of Pan-k&#259;ng, B.C. 1401 to 1374. W&ucirc;-ting's reign was subsequent to that of Pan-k&#259;ng.</P>
