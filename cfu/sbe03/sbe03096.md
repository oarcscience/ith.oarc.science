##### ODE 7. THE SZE Î.

##### AN ODE APPROPRIATE TO THE PREPARATIONS AND PROGRESS OF A FEAST AFTER A SACRIFICE.

The Preface and the editors of the Yung-*kh*ăng Shih say that the piece
has reference to the entertainment given, the day after a

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

sacrifice, in the ancestral temple, to the personators of the dead,
described on [p. 301](sbe03063.htm#page_301.md). *K*û Hsî denies this, and
holds simply that it belongs to the feast after a sacrifice, without
further specifying what sacrifice. The old view is probably the more
correct.

In his silken robes, clean and bright, With his cap on his head, looking
so respectful, From the hall he goes to the foot of the stairs, And
(then) from the sheep to the oxen <span id="fr_382"></span>[1](#fn_369.md).
(He inspects) the tripods, large and small, And the curved goblet of
rhinoceros horn <span id="fr_383"></span>[2](#fn_370.md). The good spirits
are mild, (But) there is no noise, no insolence:--An auspice (this) of
great longevity.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_369"></span>[334:1](sbe03096.htm#fr_382.md) The subject of
these lines must be an ordinary officer, for to such the silk robes and
a purple cap were proper, when he was assisting at the sacrifices of the
king or of a feudal prince. There were two buildings outside the
principal gate leading to the ancestral temple, and two corresponding
inside, in which the personators of the departed ancestors were feasted.
We must suppose the officer in question descending from the upper hall
to the vestibule of the gate, to inspect the dishes, arranged for the
feast, and then proceeding to see the animals, and the tripods for
boiling the flesh, &c.

<span id="fn_370"></span>[334:2](sbe03096.htm#fr_383.md) The goblet of
rhinoceros horn was to be drained, as a penalty, by any one offending at
the feast against the rules of propriety; but here there was no occasion
for it.
