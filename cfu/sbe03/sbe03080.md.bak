#### The Second Decade, or that of *Kh*ăn Kung.

##### ODE 1. THE *KH*ĂN KUNG.

##### INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO THE OFFICERS OF HUSBANDRY.

The place of this piece among the sacrificial odes makes us assign it to
the conclusion of some sacrifice; but what the sacrifice was we cannot
tell. The Preface says that it was addressed, at the conclusion of the
spring sacrifice to ancestors to the princes who had been present and
taken part in the service. *K*û Hsî says nothing but what I have stated
in the above argument of the piece.

Ah! ah! ministers and officers, Reverently attend to your public duties.
The king has given you perfect rules;--Consult about them and consider
them.

Ah! ah! ye assistants, It is now the end of

spring <span id="fr_366"></span>[1](#fn_354.md); And what have ye to seek
for? (Only) how to manage the new fields and those of the third year,
How beautiful are the wheat and the barley! The bright and glorious God
Will in them give us a good year. Order all our men To be provided with
their spuds and hoes:--Anon we shall see the sickles at work.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_354"></span>[321:1](sbe03080.htm#fr_366.md) It is this line
which makes it difficult to determine after what sacrifice we are to
suppose these instructions to have been delivered. The year, during the
Hsiâ dynasty, began with the first month of spring, as it now does in
China, in consequence of Confucius having said that that was the proper
time. Under the Shang dynasty, it commenced a month earlier; and during
the *K*âu period, it ought always to have begun with the new moon
preceding the winter solstice,--between our November 22 and December 22.
But in the writings of the *K*âu period we find statements of time
continually referred to the calendar of Hsiâ,--as here.
