##### ODE 6. THE LIANG SZE.

##### PRESUMABLY, AN ODE OF THANKSGIVING IN THE AUTUMN TO THE SPIRITS OF THE LAND AND GRAIN.

Very sharp are the excellent shares, With which they set to work on the
south-lying, acres.

They sow their various kinds of grain, Each seed containing in it a germ
of life.

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

There are those who come to see them, With their baskets round and
square, Containing the provisions of millet.

With their light splint hats on their heads, They ply their hoes on the
ground, Clearing away the smartweed on the dry land and wet.

The weeds being decayed, The millets grow luxuriantly.

They fall rustling before the reapers. The gathered crop is piled up
solidly, High as a wall, United together like the teeth of a comb; And
the hundred houses are opened (to receive the grain) <span
id="fr_380"></span>[1](#fn_367).

Those hundred houses being full, The wives and children have a feeling
of repose.

(Now) we kill this black-muzzled tawny bull <span
id="fr_381"></span>[2](#fn_368), with his crooked horns, To imitate and
hand down, To hand down (the observances of) our ancestors.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_367"></span>[333:1](sbe03095.htm#fr_380) 'The hundred
houses,' or chambers in a hundred family residences, are those of the
hundred families, cultivating the space which was bounded by a
brook;--see note on the second ode of the preceding decade. They formed
a society, whose members helped one another in their field work, so that
their harvest might be said to be carried home at the same time. Then
would come the threshing or treading, and winnowing, after which the
groin would be brought into the houses.

<span id="fn_368"></span>[333:2](sbe03095.htm#fr_381) It has been
observed that under the *K*âu dynasty, red was the <span
id="page_334">p. 334</span> colour of the sacrificial victims. So it was
for the ancestral temple but in sacrificing to the spirits of the land
and grain, the victim was a 'yellow' bull with black lips.
