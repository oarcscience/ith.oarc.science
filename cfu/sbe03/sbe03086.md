##### ODE 7. THE YUNG.

##### APPROPRIATE, PROBABLY, AT A SACRIFICE BY KING WÛ TO HIS FATHER WAN.

From a reference in the Analects, III, ii, to an abuse of this ode in
the time of Confucius, We learn that it was sung When the sacrificial
vessels and their contents were being removed.

They come full of harmony; They are here in all gravity;--The princes
assisting, While the Son of Heaven looks profound.

(He says), 'While I present (this) noble bull, And they assist me in
setting forth the sacrifice, O great and august Father, Comfort me, your
filial son.

With penetrating wisdom thou didst play the man. A sovereign with the
gifts both of peace and war, Giving rest even to great Heaven <span
id="fr_374"></span>[1](#fn_361.md), And ensuring prosperity to thy
descendants.

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

'Thou comfortest me with the eyebrows of longevity; Thou makest me great
with manifold blessings, I offer this sacrifice to my meritorious
father, And to my accomplished mother <span
id="fr_375"></span>[1](#fn_362.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_361"></span>[325:1](sbe03086.htm#fr_374.md) To explain this
line one commentator refers to the seventh stanza of the first piece in
the Major Odes of the Kingdom, where it is said, 'God surveyed the four
quarters of the kingdom, seeking for some one to give settlement and
rest to the people;' and adds, 'Thus what Heaven has at heart is the
settlement of the people, When the), have rest given to them, then
Heaven is at rest.'

<span id="fn_362"></span>[326:1](sbe03086.htm#fr_375.md) At sacrifices to
ancestors, the spirit tablets of wives were placed along with those of
their husbands in their shrines, so that both shared in the honours of
the service. So it is now in the imperial ancestral temple in Peking.
The 'accomplished mother' here would be Thâi Sze, celebrated often in
the pieces of the first Book of Part I, and elsewhere.
