## PART II. THE BOOKS OF YÜ.

### BOOK I. THE CANON OF SHUN.

THE Books of Yü is the name of this Part of the Shû Yü being the
dynastic designation of Shun, as Thang was that of Yâo. It does not
appear so clearly, however, how it came to be so. Yü must be the name of
a state, and is commonly identified with the present district of An-yî,
in *K*ieh *K*âu, Shan-hsî. Some think that Yâo, after marrying his two
daughters to Shun, appointed him lord of this state; but in the first
mention of him to Yâo in the last Book, he is called Shun of Yü. It is.
generally said that Shun's ancestors had been lords of the principality
of Yü up to the time of his father, who lost his patrimony and was
reduced to the rank of a private man. But after what has been said, in
the Introduction, on the Books in the first two Parts of the Shû, it
will not be thought surprising that much in the accounts about Yâo and
Shun should be open to suspicion. According to Mencius, IV, Part ii, ch.
1, Shun was from the country of the wild tribes on the east. Sze-mâ
*Kh*ien makes him to have been descended from Hwang-Tî, in which case he
and his wives, the daughters of Yâo, would have had the same ancestor.
Nothing more injurious to the fame of Yâo and Shun, according to Chinese
notions of propriety, could be alleged against them.

Shun is the subject of this Canon, as Yâo was of the former. As it now
stands, we may divide it into six chapters:--the first, describing
Shun's virtues and gradual advancement; the second, Yâo's satisfaction
with his administration of affairs, and associating of Shun with himself
on the throne; the third, the acts of Shun in that position; the fourth,
the demise of Yâo, and Shun's accession as sole monarch; the fifth, his
choice of ministers and complete organization of his government; and the
sixth, his death.

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

1\. Examining into antiquity, (we find that) the Tî Shun <span
id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33.md) was styled *Kh*ung-hwâ <span
id="fr_34"></span>[2](#fn_34.md). His character was entirely conformed to
(that of): the (former) Tî, he was profound, wise, accomplished, and
intelligent. He was mild and courteous, and truly sincere. The report of
his mysterious virtue was heard on high, and he was appointed to office.

2\. (Shun) carefully set forth the beauty of the five cardinal duties,
and they came to be (universally) observed. Being appointed to be
General Regulator, the affairs of every (official) department were
arranged in their proper seasons. (Being charged) to receive (the
princes) from the four quarters of the land, they were all docilely
submissive. Being sent to the great plains at the foot of the mountains,
notwithstanding the tempests of wind, thunder, and rain, he did not go
astray.

The Tî said, 'Come, you Shun. I have consulted you on (all) affairs, and
examined your words, and found that they can be carried into
practice;--(now) for three years. Do you ascend the seat of the Tî.'
Shun wished to decline in favour of some one more virtuous, and not to
consent to be (Yâo's) successor. On the first day of the first month,
(however), he received (Yâo's) retirement (from his duties) in the
temple of the Accomplished Ancestor <span
id="fr_35"></span>[3](#fn_35.md).\*

3\. He examined the pearl-adorned turning sphere,

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

with its transverse tube of jade, and reduced to a harmonious system
(the movements of) the Seven Directors <span
id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md).

Thereafter, he sacrificed specially, but with the ordinary forms, to
God; sacrificed with reverent purity to the Six Honoured Ones; offered
their appropriate sacrifices to the hills and rivers; and extended his
worship to the host of spirits <span id="fr_37"></span>[2](#fn_37.md).\*

He called in (all) the five jade-symbols of rank; and when the month was
over, he gave daily audience to (the President of) the Four Mountains,
and all the Pastors <span id="fr_38"></span>[3](#fn_38), (finally.md)
returning their symbols to the various princes.

In the second month of the year he made a tour of inspection eastwards,
as far as Thâi-ȝung <span id="fr_39"></span>[4](#fn_39.md), where he
presented a burnt-offering to Heaven, and sacrificed in order to the
hills and rivers.\* Thereafter he gave audience to the princes of the
east. He set in accord their seasons and months, and regulated the days;
he made uniform the standard-tubes, with the measures of length and of
capacity, and the steelyards, he regulated the five (classes of)
ceremonies, with (the various) articles of introduction,--the five

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

symbols of jade, the three kinds of silk, the two living (animals) and
the one dead one. As to the five instruments of rank, when all was over,
he returned them. In the fifth month he made a similar tour southwards,
as far as the mountain of the south <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md),
where he observed the same ceremonies as at Thâi. In the eighth month he
made a tour westwards, as far as the mountain of the west <span
id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_40.md), where he did as before. In the eleventh
month he made a tour northwards, as far as the mountain of the north',
where he observed the same ceremonies as in the west. He (then) returned
(to the capital), went to (the temple of) the Cultivated Ancestor <span
id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_41.md), and sacrificed a single bull.\*

In five years there was one tour of inspection, and there were four
appearances of the princes at court. They gave a report (of their
government) in words, which was clearly tested by their works. They
received chariots and robes according to their merits.

He instituted the division (of the land) into twelve provinces <span
id="fr_43"></span>[3](#fn_42.md), raising altars upon twelve hills in
them.\* He (also) deepened the rivers.

He exhibited (to the people) the statutory punishments, enacting
banishment as a mitigation of the five (great) inflictions <span
id="fr_44"></span>[4](#fn_43.md); with the whip to be employed in the
magistrates' courts, the stick to be

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

employed in schools <span id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_44.md), and money to be
received for redeemable offences. Inadvertent offences and those which
could be ascribed to misfortune were to be pardoned, but those who
transgressed presumptuously and repeatedly were to be punished with
death. 'Let me be reverent! Let me be reverent!' (he said to himself.)
'Let compassion rule in punishment!'

He banished the Minister of Works to Yû island; confined Hwan-tâu on
mount *Kh*ung; drove (the chief of) San-miâo (and his people) into
San-wei, and kept them there; and held Khwăn a prisoner till death on
mount Yü. These four criminals being thus dealt with, all under heaven
acknowledged the justice (of Shun's administration) <span
id="fr_46"></span>[2](#fn_45.md).

4\. After twenty-eight years the Tî deceased, when the people mourned
for him as for a parent for three years. Within the four seas all the
eight kinds of instruments of music were stopped and hushed. On the
first day of the first month (of the) next year, Shun went to (the
temple of) the Accomplished Ancestor.\*

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

5\. He deliberated with (the President of) the Four Mountains how to
throw open the doors (of communication between himself and the) four
(quarters of the land), and how he could see with the eyes, and hear
with the ears of all.

He consulted with the twelve Pastors <span
id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_46.md), and said to them, 'The food!--it depends
on observing the seasons. Be kind to the distant, and cultivate the
ability of the near. Give honour to the virtuous, and your confidence to
the good, while you discountenance the artful;--so shall the barbarous
tribes lead on one another to make their submission.'

Shun said, 'Ho! (President of) the Four Mountains, is there any one who
can with vigorous service attend to all the affairs of the Tî, whom I
may appoint to be General Regulator, to assist me in (all) affairs,
managing each department according to its nature?' All (in the court)
replied, 'There is Po-yü <span id="fr_48"></span>[2](#fn_47.md), the
Minister of Works.' The Tî said, 'Yes. Ho! Yü, you have regulated the
water and the land. In this (new office) exert yourself.' Yü did
obeisance with his head to the ground, and wished to decline in favour
of the Minister of Agriculture, or Hsieh, or Kâo-yâo. The Tî said, 'Yes,
but do you go (and undertake the duties).'

The Tî said, '*Kh*î <span id="fr_49"></span>[3](#fn_48.md), the
black-haired people are (still) suffering from famine. Do you, O prince,
as

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Minister of
Agriculture, (continue to) sow (for them) the various kinds of grain.'

The Tî said, 'Hsieh <span id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_49.md), the people are
(still) wanting in affection for one another, and do not docilely,
observe the five orders of relationship. It is yours, as the Minister of
Instruction, reverently, to set forth the lessons of duty belonging to
those five orders. Do so with gentleness.'

The Tî said, 'Kâo-yâo <span id="fr_51"></span>[2](#fn_50.md), the barbarous
tribes trouble our great land. There are (also) robbers, murderers,
insurgents, and traitors. It is yours, as the Minister of Crime, to use
the five punishments to deal with their offences. For the infliction of
these there are the three appointed places. There are the five cases in
which banishment in the appropriate places is to be resorted to, to
which places, though five, three localities are assigned. Perform your
duties with intelligence, and you will secure a sincere (submission).'

The Tî said, 'Who can superintend my works, as they severally require?'
All (in the court) replied, 'Is there not *Z*ui <span
id="fr_52"></span>[3](#fn_51.md)?' The Tî said, 'Yes. Ho! *Z*ui, you must
be Minister of Works.' *Z*ui did obeisance with his head to the ground,
and wished to decline in favour of Shû, *Kh*iang, or Po-yü. The

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Tî said, 'Yes, but
do you go (and undertake the duties). Effect a harmony (in all the
departments).' The Tî said, 'Who can superintend, as the nature of the
charge requires, the grass and trees, with the birds and beasts on my
hills and in my marshes?' All (in the court) replied, 'Is there not
Yî <span id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_52.md)?' The Tî said, 'Yes. Ho! Yî do
you be my Forester.' Yî did obeisance with his head to the ground, and
wished to decline in favour of *K*û, Hû, Hsiung, or Pî <span
id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_52.md). The Tî said, 'Yes, but do you go (and
undertake the duties). You must manage them harmoniously.'

The Tî said, 'Ho! (President of the) Four Mountains, is there any one
able to direct my three (religious) ceremonies <span
id="fr_55"></span>[2](#fn_53)?' All (In the court.md) answered, 'Is there
not Po-î <span id="fr_56"></span>[3](#fn_54.md)?' The Tî said, 'Yes. Ho!
Po, you must be the Arranger in the Ancestral Temple. Morning and night
be reverent. Be upright, be pure.' Po did obeisance with his head to the
ground, and wished to decline in favour of Khwei or Lung. The Tî said,
'Yes, but do you go (and undertake the duties). Be reverential!'\*

The Tî said, 'Khwei <span id="fr_57"></span>[4](#fn_55.md), I appoint you
to be Director of Music, and to teach our sons, so that the
straightforward shall yet be mild; the gentle, dignified: the strong,
not tyrannical: and the impetuous,

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

not arrogant. Poetry is the expression of earnest thought; singing is
the prolonged utterance of that expression; the notes accompany that
utterance, and they are harmonized themselves by the standard tubes. (In
this way) the eight different kinds of musical instruments can be
adjusted so that one shall not take from or interfere with another; and
spirits and men are brought into harmony.' Khwei said, 'I smite the
(sounding-) stone, I gently strike it, and the various animals lead on
one another to dance.'

The Tî said ; 'Lung <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_56.md), I abominate
slanderous speakers and destroyers of the (right) ways, who agitate and
alarm my people. I appoint you to be the Minister of Communication.
Early and late give forth my orders and report to me, seeing that
everything is true.'

The Tî said, 'Ho! you, twenty and two men, be reverent; so shall you. be
helpful to the business (entrusted to me by) Heaven.'\*

Every three years there was an examination of merits, and after three
examinations the undeserving were degraded, and the deserving advanced.
(By this arrangement) the duties of all the departments were fully
discharged; the (people of) San-miâo (also) were discriminated and
separated.

6\. In the thirtieth year of his age, Shun was called to employment.
Thirty years he was on the throne (with Yâo). Fifty years afterwards he
went on high and died <span id="fr_59"></span>[2](#fn_57.md).\*

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_33"></span>[38:1](sbe03009.htm#fr_33.md) If Shun be taken as
an epithet, it will mean 'the Benevolent and Sage.'

<span id="fn_34"></span>[38:2](sbe03009.htm#fr_34.md) *Kh*ung-hwâ, the name
of Shun according to the Han scholars, may mean 'the Glorious (Yâo)
repeated.'

<span id="fn_35"></span>[38:3](sbe03009.htm#fr_35.md) The Accomplished
Ancestor would be, probably, the individual in some distant time to whom
Yâo traced his possession of the throne.

<span id="fn_36"></span>[39:1](sbe03009.htm#fr_36.md) Probably the seven
stars of the Great Bear.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[39:2](sbe03009.htm#fr_37.md) Who the Six Honoured
Ones were cannot be determined with certainty. An-kwo thought they were,
'the seasons, cold and heat, the sun, the moon, the stars, and drought,'
that is, certain spirits, supposed to rule over these phenomena and
things, and residing probably in different stars. The whole paragraph
describes Shun's exercise of the prerogative of the sovereign, so far as
religious worship was concerned.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[39:3](sbe03009.htm#fr_38.md) The princes of the
various states, whose official chief was the President of the Four
Mountains, all 'shepherds of men.'

<span id="fn_39"></span>[39:4](sbe03009.htm#fr_39.md) Thâi-ȝung is mount
Thâi in Shan-tung. See note on the President of the Four Mountains, [p.
35](sbe03008.htm#page_35.md).

<span id="fn_40"></span>[40:1](sbe03009.htm#fr_41.md) See note on the
President of the Four Mountains, p. 35.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[40:2](sbe03009.htm#fr_42.md) Probably the same as
the Accomplished Ancestor on p. 38.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[40:3](sbe03009.htm#fr_43.md) As Yü, according to
Part III, i, divided the land into nine provinces, this division of it
into twelve must have been subsequent to the completion of Yü's work.
See on the Tribute of Yü.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[40:4](sbe03009.htm#fr_44.md) Those five great
inflictions were-branding on the forehead; cutting off the nose; cutting
off the feet; castration; and death, inflicted in various ways.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[41:1](sbe03009.htm#fr_45.md) This punishment was
for officers in training; not for boys at school.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[41:2](sbe03009.htm#fr_46.md) The Minister of
Works, Hwan-tâu, and Khwăn are mentioned in the former Canon. Yû island,
or Yû *K*âu, was in the extreme north of the present district of Mî-yun,
department Shun-thien, *K*ih-lî.

Mount Khung was in the district of Yung-ting, Lî *K*âu, Hu-nan. San-miâo
was the name of a territory, embracing the present departments of
Wû-*kh*ang in Hû-pei, Yo-*k*âu in Hu-nan, and *K*iû-kiang in
*K*iang-hsî. San-wei was a tract of country round a mountain of the same
name in the present department of An-hsî, Kan-sû. Mount Yü was in the
present district of Than-*kh*ăng, Shan-tung.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[42:1](sbe03009.htm#fr_47.md) These were the twelve
princes holding the chief sway and superintendence in his twelve
provinces.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[42:2](sbe03009.htm#fr_48.md) Po-yü is the great
Yü, the founder of the Hsiâ dynasty. Po denotes, probably, his order as
the eldest among his brothers.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[42:3](sbe03009.htm#fr_49.md) *Kh*î was the name of
the Minister of Agriculture, better known in the Shih and other books as
Hû-*k*î, the progenitor of the kings of *K*âu. See the legend about him
in the Shih, Part III, ii, Ode 1.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[43:1](sbe03009.htm#fr_50.md) Hsieh was honoured by
the kings of the Shang dynasty as their progenitor. See the Shih, Part
IV, iii, Odes 3 and 4.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[43:2](sbe03009.htm#fr_51.md) See the preliminary
note to Book iii.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[43:3](sbe03009.htm#fr_52.md) *Z*ui was not claimed
by any great family as its progenitor, but he was handed down by
tradition as a great artificer. See a reference to him in Part V, xxii,
2. Shû and *Kh*iang must have been named from their skill in making
halberds and axes. The Yü (quite different from the name of the great
Yü) in Po-yü gives us no indication of the skill of that individual.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[44:1](sbe03009.htm#fr_54.md) For Yî, see the
preliminary note to Book iv. He wishes here to decline his appointment
in favour of *K*û ('The Cedar'), Hû ('The Tiger'), Hsiung ('The Bear'),
or Pî ('The Grisly Bear').

<span id="fn_53"></span>[44:2](sbe03009.htm#fr_55.md) The three ceremonies
were the observances in the worship of the Spirits of Heaven, the
Spirits of Earth, and the Spirits of Men.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[44:3](sbe03009.htm#fr_56.md) Po-î was the
progenitor of the great family of *K*iang, members of which ruled in
*Kh*î and other states,

<span id="fn_55"></span>[44:4](sbe03009.htm#fr_57.md) Of Khwei we know
nothing more than what is here told us. The character denotes a
monstrous animal, 'a dragon with one leg.'

<span id="fn_56"></span>[45:1](sbe03009.htm#fr_58.md) We are in ignorance
of Lung, as we are of Khwei. The character denotes 'the dragon.'

<span id="fn_57"></span>[45:2](sbe03009.htm#fr_59.md) The Chinese text is
here difficult to construe. *K*û Hsî says that the term 'went on high'
is appropriate to the death of the Son of Heaven; and that the meaning
is that Shun went to heaven.
