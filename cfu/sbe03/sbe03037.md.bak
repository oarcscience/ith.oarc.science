### BOOK X.

### THE ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT DRUNKENNESS.

THIS Announcement was, like the last, made to Făng, the prince of Khang,
about the time when he was invested with the principality of Wei.
Mention has often been made in previous documents of the Shû of the
drunken debauchery of *K*ieh as the chief cause of the downfall of the
dynasty of Hsiâ, and of the same vice in *K*âu-hsin, the last of the
kings of

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Shang. The people
of Shang had followed the example of their sovereign, and drunkenness,
with its attendant immoralities, characterised both the highest and
lowest classes of society. One of Făng's most difficult tasks in his
administration would be, to correct this evil habit, and be is called in
this Book to the undertaking. He is instructed in the proper use and the
allowable uses of spirits; the disastrous consequences of drunkenness
are set forth; and be is summoned to roll back the flood of its
desolation from his officers and people.

I have divided the Book into two chapters:--the, one preliminary,
showing the original use and the permissible uses of ardent spirits; the
other, showing how drunkenness had proved the ruin of the Shang dynasty,
and bow they of Kâu, and particularly Fang in Wei, should turn the
lesson to account.

The title might be translated--'The Announcement about Spirits,' but the
cursory reader would most readily suppose that the discourse was about
Spiritual Beings. The Chinese term *K*iû, that is here employed, is
often translated by wine, but it denotes, it seems to me, ardent
spirits. As Gaubil says, 'We have here to do with le vin du riz, the art
of which was discovered, according to most writers, in the time of Yü,
the founder of the first dynasty. The grape was not introduced to China
till that of the first Han.'

\[Since the above sentences were in manuscript, the Rev. Dr. Edkins of
Pekin has stated at a meeting of the North-China branch of the Royal
Asiatic Society, and in a letter to myself (April 24th), that he has
lately investigated the question whether the Kiû of the ancient Chinese
was spirits or not, and found that distillation was first known in China
in the Mongol or Yüan dynasty (A.D. 1280-1367), so that the Arabs must
have the credit of the invention; that the process in making *K*iû was
brewing, or nearly so, but, as the term beer is inadmissible in a
translation of the classics, he would prefer to use the term wine; and
that *K*iû with Shâo ('fired,' 'ardent') before it, means spirits, but
without Shâo, it means wine.

If the whole process of Dr. Edkins' investigation were before me, I
should be glad to consider it, and not hesitate to alter my own view, if
I saw reason to do so. Meanwhile, what he says makes me glad that I
adopted 'the Announcement about Drunkenness' as the title of this
chapter. It is drunkenness, by whatever liquor occasioned, that the king
of *K*âu condemns and denounces.

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

What we commonly understand by wine is never intended by Kiû in the
Chinese classics, and therefore I cannot use that term. After searching
as extensively as I could do in this country, since I received Dr.
Edkins' letter, I have found nothing to make me think that the Chinese
term is not properly translated by 'spirits.'

Dr. Williams, in his Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language
(Shanghai, 1874), gives this account of *K*iû:--'Liquor; it includes
spirits, wine, beer, and other drinks. The Chinese make no wine, and
chiefly distil. their liquors, and say that Tû Khang, a woman of the Tî
tribes, first made it.' This account is to a considerable extent
correct. The Chinese distil their liquors. I never saw beer or porter of
native production among them, though according to Dr. Edkins they had
been brewing 'or nearly so' for more than 3000 years. Among his examples
of the use of *K*iû, Williams gives the combinations of 'red *K*iû for
claret, 'white *K*iû' for sherry, and 'pî (simply phonetical) *K*iû' for
beer, adding that they 'are all terms of foreign origin! What he says
about the traditional account of the first maker of *K*iû is not
correct. It is said certainly that this was Tû Khang, but who he was, or
when he lived, I have never been able to discover. Some identify him
with to, said by Williams to have been 'a woman of the Tî tribes.' The
attributing of the invention to Î-tî is probably an independent
tradition. We find it in the 'Plans of the Warring States' (ch. xiv,
art. 10), a work covering about four centuries from the death of
Confucius:--'Anciently, the daughter of the Tî ordered Î-tî to make
*K*iû. She admired it, and presented some to Yü, who drank it, and found
it pleasant. He then discarded Î-tî, and denounced the use of such
generous *K*iû, saying, "In future ages there are sure to be those who
by *K*iû will lose their states' According to this tradition
intoxicating *K*iû was known in the time of Yü--in the twenty-third
century B.C. The daughter of the Tî would be Yü's wife, and Î-tî would
probably be their cook. It does not appear as the name of a woman, or
one from the wild Tî tribes.

With regard to the phrase Shâo *K*iû, said to be the proper term for
ardent spirits, and unknown in China till the Yüan dynasty, a reference
to the Khang-hsî Tonic Thesaurus of the language will show instances of
its use as early at least as the Thang dynasty (A.D. 618-906).\]

1\. The king speaks to the following effect:--'Do

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

you clearly make known my great commands in the country of Mei <span
id="fr_192"></span>[1](#fn_185.md).

'When your reverent father, the king Wăn, laid the foundations of our
kingdom in the western region, he delivered announcements and cautions
to (the princes of) the various regions, and to all his (high) officers,
with their assistants, and the managers of affairs, saying, morning and
evening, "At sacrifices spirits should be employed."\* When Heaven was
sending down its favouring decree, and laying the foundations of (the
eminence of) our people, (spirits) were used only at the great
sacrifices. When Heaven sends down its terrors, and our people are
thereby greatly disorganized and lose their virtue, this may be traced
invariably to their indulgence in spirits; yea, the ruin of states,
small and great, (by these terrors), has been caused invariably by their
guilt in the use of spirits <span id="fr_193"></span>[2](#fn_186.md).

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

'King Wăn admonished and instructed the young nobles, who were charged
with office or in any employment, that they should not ordinarily use
spirits; and throughout all the states, he required that such should
drink spirits only on occasion of sacrifices, and that then virtue
should preside so that there might be no drunkenness <span
id="fr_194"></span>[1](#fn_187.md).'

He said, 'Let my people teach their young men that they are to love only
the productions of the soil, for so will their hearts be good. Let the
young also hearken wisely to the constant instructions of their fathers;
and let them look at all virtuous actions, whether great or small, in
the same light (with watchful heed).

'(Ye people of) the land of Mei, if you can employ your limbs, largely
cultivating your millets, and hastening about in the service of your
fathers and elders; and if, with your carts and oxen, you traffic
diligently to a distance, that you may thereby filially minister to your
parents; then, when your parents are happy, you may set forth your
spirits clear and strong, and use them <span
id="fr_195"></span>[2](#fn_188.md).

'Hearken constantly to my instructions, all ye my (high) officers and ye
heads of departments, all ye, my noble chiefs;--when ye have largely
done your

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

duty in ministering to your aged, and serving your ruler, ye may eat and
drink freely and to satiety. And to speak of greater things:--when you
can maintain a constant, watchful examination of yourselves, and your
conduct is in accordance with correct. virtue, then may you present the
offerings of sacrifice,\* and at the same time indulge yourselves in
festivity. In such case you will indeed be ministers doing right service
to your king, and Heaven likewise will approve your great virtue, so
that you shall never be forgotten in the royal House.'\*

2\. The king says, 'O Făng, in our western region, the princes of
states, and the young (nobles), sons of the managers of affairs, who in
former days assisted king Wăn, were all able to obey his lessons, and
abstain from excess in the use of spirits; and so it is that I have now
received the appointment which belonged to Yin.'

The king says. 'O Făng, I have heard it said, that formerly the first
wise king of Yin manifested a reverential awe of the bright principles
of Heaven and of the lower people, acting accordingly, steadfast in his
virtue, and holding fast his wisdom.\* From him Thang the Successful,
down to Tî-yî <span id="fr_196"></span>[1](#fn_189.md), all completed their
royal virtue and revered their chief ministers, so that their managers
of affairs respectfully discharged their helping duties, and dared not
to allow themselves in idleness and pleasure;--how much less would they
dare to indulge themselves in drinking! Moreover, in the exterior
domains, (the princes of) the Hâu, Tien,

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nan, and Wei
(states) <span id="fr_197"></span>[1](#fn_190.md), with their presiding
chiefs and in the interior domain, all the various officers, the
directors of the several departments, the inferior officers and
employés, the heads of great houses, and the men of distinguished name
living in retirement, all eschewed indulgence in spirits. Not only did
they not dare to indulge in them, but the), had not leisure to do so,
being occupied with helping to complete the sovereigns virtue and make
it more illustrious, and helping the directors of affairs reverently to
attend to his service.

'I have heard it said likewise, that the last successor of those kings
was addicted to drink, so that no charges came from him brightly before
the people, and he was (as if) reverently and unchangingly bent on doing
and cherishing what provoked resentment. Greatly abandoned to
extraordinary lewdness and dissipation, for pleasure's sake he
sacrificed all his majesty. The people were all sorely grieved and
wounded in heart; but he gave himself wildly up to drink, not thinking
of restraining himself. but continuing his excess, till his mind was
frenzied, and he had no fear of death His crimes (accumulated) in the
capital of Shang: and though the extinction of the dynasty (was
imminent), this gave him no concern, and he wrought not that any
sacrifices of fragrant virtue might ascend to Heaven.\* The rank odour
of the people's resentments, and the drunkenness of his herd of
creatures, went loudly up on high, so that Heaven sent down ruin on Yin,

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

and showed no love for it,--because of such excesses. There is not any
cruel oppression of Heaven; people themselves accelerate their guilt,
(and its punishment.))

The king says, 'O Făng, I make you this long announcement, not (for the
pleasure of doing so); but the ancients have said, "Let not men look
into water; let them look into the glass of other people." Now that Yin
has lost its appointment, ought we not to look much to it as our glass,
(and learn) how to secure the repose of our time? I say to
you,--Strenuously warn the worthy ministers of Yin, and (the princes) in
the Hâu, the Tien, the Nan, and the Wei domains; and still more your
friends, the great Recorder and the Recorder of the Interior, and all
your worthy ministers, the heads of great Houses; and still more those
whom you serve, with whom you calmly discuss matters, and who carry out
your measures; and still more those who are, as it were, your
mates,--your Minister of War who deals with the rebellious, your
Minister of Instruction who is like a protector to the people, and your
Minister of Works who settles the boundaries; and above all, do you
strictly keep yourself from drink.

'If you are informed that there are companies that drink together, do
not fail to apprehend them all, and send them here to Kâu, where I may
put them to death. As to the ministers and officers of Yin who were led
to it and became addicted to drink, it is not necessary to put them to
death (at once);--let them be taught for a time. If they follow these
(lessons of mine), I will give them bright distinction. If they
disregard my lessons, then I, the One man, will show them no pity. As

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

they cannot change their way, they shall be classed with those who are
to be put to death.'

The king says, 'O Făng, give constant heed to my admonitions. If you do
not rightly manage the officers, the people will continue lost in
drunkenness.'

<span id="fn_185"></span>[174:1](sbe03037.htm#fr_192.md) There is a place
called 'the village of Mei,' in the north of the present district of
*Kh*î, department Wei-hui, Ho-nan;--a relic of the ancient name of the
whole territory. The royal domain of Shang, north from the capital, was
all called Mei. Fang's principality of Wei must have embraced most of
it.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[174:2](sbe03037.htm#fr_193.md) *K*û Hsî says upon
the meaning of the expressions 'Heaven was sending down its favouring
decree' (its order to make Kiû, as he understood the language), and
'when Heaven sends down its terrors,' in this paragraph:--'*K*ang
Nan-hsien has brought out the meaning of these two statements much
better than any of the critics who went before him, to the following
effect:--*K*iû is a thing intended to be used in offering sacrifices and
in entertaining guests;--such employment of it. is what Heaven has
prescribed. But men by their abuse of *K*iû come to lose their virtue,
and destroy their persons;--such employment of it is what Heaven has
annexed its terrors to. The Buddhists, hating the use of things where
Heaven sends down its terrors, put away as well the use of them which
Heaven has prescribed. It is not so with us of the learned (i.e. the
Confucian or orthodox) school;--we only put <span id="page_175">p.
175</span> away the use of things to which Heaven has annexed its
terrors, and the use of them, of which it approves, remains as a matter
of course.'

<span id="fn_187"></span>[175:1](sbe03037.htm#fr_194.md) In sacrificing,
the fragrant odour of spirits was supposed to be acceptable to the
Beings worshipped. Here the use of spirits seems to be permitted in
moderation to the worshippers after the sacrifices. Observe how king Wăn
wished to guard the young from acquiring the habit of drinking spirits.

<span id="fn_188"></span>[175:2](sbe03037.htm#fr_195.md) Here is another
permissible use of spirits;--at family feasts, with a view especially to
the comfort of the aged.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[176:1](sbe03037.htm#fr_196.md) Tî-yî was the
father of *K*âu-hsin, the twenty-seventh Shang sovereign. The sovereigns
between Thang and him had not all been good, but the duke of *K*âu
chooses here to say so.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[177:1](sbe03037.htm#fr_197.md) These were the
first, second, third, and fifth domains or territorial divisions of the
land under *K*âu, counting back from the royal domain. It appears here
that an arrangement akin to that of *K*âu had been made in the time of
Shang.
