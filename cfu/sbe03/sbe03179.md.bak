### CHAPTER III.

### CRITICISM OF THE HSIÂO SINCE THE THANG DYNASTY.

<span class="margnote">Works on the old text by Sze-mâ Kwang and Fan
Ȝû-yü.</span>

1\. Notwithstanding the difficulty about one chapter which has been
pointed out on p. 455, Hsüan Ȝung's text was generally accepted as the
representative of that in modern characters recovered in the second
century B. C. There were still those, however, who continued to advocate
the claims of 'the old text.' Sze-mâ Kwang, a distinguished minister and
scholar of the Sung dynasty (1009-1086), presented to the court in 1054
his 'Explanations of the Hsiâo King according to the Old Text,' arguing,
in his preface and in various memorials, for the correctness of that
text, as recovered by Liû Hsüan in the sixth century. Fan Ȝû-yü
(1041-1098), a scholar of the same century, and in other things a
collaborateur of Kwang, produced, towards the end of his life, an
'Exposition of the Hsiâo King according to the Old Text.' He says in his
preface:--'Though the agreement between the ancient and modern texts is
great, and the difference small, yet the ancient deserves to be
preferred, and my labour upon it may not be without some little
value <span id="fr_649"></span>[1](#fn_629.md).'

<span class="margnote">Sceptical criticism. Views of *K*û Hsî.</span>

2\. But our classic had still to pass the ordeal of the sceptical
criticism that set in during the Sung dynasty. The most notable result
of this was 'the Hsiâo King Expurgated,' published by *K*û Hsî in 1186.
He tells us that when be first saw a statement by Hû Hung (a minister in
the reign of Kâo Ȝung, 1127-1162), that the quotations from the Book of
Poetry in the Hsiâo were probably of later introduction into the text,
he was terror-struck. Prolonged examination, however, satisfied him that
there were good grounds for Hû's statement, and that other portions of
the text were also open to suspicion. He found, moreover, that another
earlier writer, Wang Ying-*kh*ăn, in the reign of Hsiâo Ȝung
(1163-1189), had come to the conclusion that much of the Hsiâo had been
fabricated or interpolated in the Han dynasty. The way was open for him
to give expression to his convictions without incurring the charge of
being the first to impugn the accepted text.

The fact was, as pointed out by the editors of the Catalogue Raisonné of
the Imperial Library of the present dynasty, that *K*û had long
entertained the views which he indicated in his expurgated edition of
the Hsiâo, and his references to Hû and Wang were simply to shield his
own boldness. He divided the treatise into one chapter of classical
text, and fourteen chapters of illustration and commentary. But both
parts were freely expurgated. His classical text embraces the first six
chapters in my translation, and is supposed by him to form one
continuous discourse by Confucius. The rest of the treatise should not
be attributed to the sage at all. The bulk of it may have come from
Ȝăng-ȝze, or from members of his school, but large interpolations were
made by the Han scholars. Adopting the old text, *K*û discarded from it
altogether 223 characters.

Attention will be called, under the several chapters, to

<span id="page_460">p. 460</span>

some of the passages which he suppressed. and to the reasons, generally
satisfactory, which he advanced for his procedure. 'Evidently be was
influenced considerably by the way in which *Kh*ăng Î (1033-1107), whom
he called 'his master,' had dealt with the old text of 'the Great
Learning;' but he made his innovations with a bolder pencil and on a
more extensive plan, not merely altering the arrangement of paragraphs,
and supplementing what was plainly defective, but challenging the
genuineness of large portions of the treatise, and removing them without
scruple.

<span class="margnote">Views of Wû *Kh*ăng.</span>

Under the Yüan dynasty, Wû *Kh*ăng (1249-1333), the greatest of its
scholars, followed in the wake of *K*û Hsî, yet with the independence
characteristic of himself. As Kû had preferred the old text, Wû
decided--and, I believe, more correctly--in favour of the modern,
arguing that the copy of Khung An-kwo's text and commentary, said to
have been recovered and published in the sixth century by Liû Hsüan, was
a fabrication. He adopted, therefore, Hsüan Ȝung's text as the basis of
his revision, which appeared with the title of 'the Hsiâo King, in
paragraphs and sentences <span id="fr_650"></span>[1](#fn_630.md).' He
adopted *K*û's division of the treatise into classical text and
commentary. The chapter of classical text is the same as *K*û's; the
chapters of commentary are only twelve. He discarded, of course, the
chapter peculiar to the old text, which has been referred to more than
once, united Hsüan Ȝung's eleventh chapter with another, and arranged
the other chapters differently from *K*û. His revision altogether had
246 characters fewer than the old text.

<span class="margnote">Later works on the Hsiâo.</span>

3\. *K*û Î-tsun gives the titles of nearly 120 works on our classic that
appeared after the volume of Wû *Kh*ăng, bringing its literary history
down to the end of the Ming dynasty. The scholars of the present dynasty
have not been less abundant in their labours on it than their
predecessors. Among the collected

<span id="page_461">p. 461</span>

works of Mâo *Kh*î-ling (1623-1713) is one called 'Questions about the
Hsiâo King,' in which, with his usual ability, and, it must be added,
his usual acrimony, he defends the received text. He asserts-and in this
he is correct-that there is no difference of any importance between the
ancient and modern texts; when he asserts further that there never was
any such difference, what he affirms is incapable of proof. He pours
scorn on *K*û Hsî and Wû *Kh*ăng; but he is not so successful in
defending the integrity of the Hsiâo as I have allowed him to be in
vindicating the portions of the Shû that we owe to Khung An-kwo.

The Hsiâo King has always been a favourite with the emperors of China.
Before Hsüan Ȝung took it in hand, the first and eighth emperors of the
eastern *K*in dynasty (317-419), the first and third of the Liang
(502-556), and the ninth of the northern Wei (386-534) had published
their labours upon it. The Manchâu rulers of the present dynasty have
signalised themselves in this department. In 1656 the first emperor
produced in one chapter his 'Imperial Commentary on the Hsiâo King,' and
in 1728 the third published a 'Collection of Comments' on it, Between
them was the long reign known to us as the Khang-hsî period (1662-1722),
during which there appeared under the direction of the second emperor,
the most distinguished of his line, his 'Extensive Explanation of the
Hsiâo King,' in 100 chapters. The only portion of the text which it
gives in full is *K*û Hsî's chapter of Confucian text: but most of the
topics touched on in *K*û's supplementary chapters, added as he
supposed, by some later hand, are dealt with in the course of the work,
the whole of which will amply repay a careful study.

<span class="margnote">Conclusion regarding the genuineness and
integrity of the Hsiâo.</span>

4\. It will have been seen that the two great scholars, *K*û Hsî and Wû
*Kh*ăng, who have taken the greatest liberties with the text of our
classic, allow that there is a Confucian element in it, and that more
than a fifth part of the whole, containing, even as expurgated by *K*û,
about 400 characters, may be correctly ascribed to the sage. I agree
with them

<span id="page_462">p. 462</span>

in this. All the rest of the treatise, to whomsoever it may be ascribed,
from Ȝăng-ȝze, the immediate disciple of Confucius, down to Liû Hsiang
(B.C. 80-9), took its present form in the first century before our
Christian era. The reader will fail to see in it a close connexion
between the different chapters, and think that the author or authors try
to make more of Filial Piety than can be made of it. The whole, however,
is a valuable monument of antiquity, and an exhibition of the virtue
which Chinese moralists and rulers, from the most ancient times, have
delighted to celebrate as the fundamental principle of human virtue, the
great source of social happiness, and the bond of national strength and
stability.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_629"></span>[458:1](sbe03179.htm#fr_649.md) In the Hsiâo King,
as now frequently published in China, either separately by itself, or
bound up with *K*û Hsî's Hsiâo Hsio, 'the Teaching for the Young,' we
find the old text, without distinction of chapters. The commentaries of
Hsüan Ȝung and Sze-mâ Kwang, and the exposition of Fan Ȝû-yü, however,
follow one another at the end of the several clauses and paragraphs.
<span id="page_459">p. 459</span> Some portions also are in a different
order from the arrangement of Hsüan Ȝung and Hsing Ping, which I have
followed in my translation. As has been already said, the difference
between its text and that of the Thang emperor is slight,--hardly
greater than the variations in the different recensions of our Gospels
and the other books of the New Testament.

<span id="fn_630"></span>[460:1](sbe03179.htm#fr_650.md) The title of this
work in the Catalogue of the Imperial Libraries is 'Settlement of the
Text of the Hsiâo King.'
