## CHAPTER IX. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SAGES <span id="fr_678"></span>[1](#fn_658.md).

The disciple Ȝăng said, 'I venture to ask whether in the virtue of the
sages there was not something greater than filial piety.' The Master
replied, 'Of all (creatures with their different) natures produced by
Heaven and Earth, man is the noblest. Of all the actions of man there is
none greater than filial piety. In filial piety there is nothing greater
than the reverential awe of one's father. In the reverential awe shown
to one's father there is nothing. greater than the making him the
correlate of Heaven <span id="fr_679"></span>[2](#fn_659.md). The duke of
*K*âu was the man who (first) did this <span
id="fr_680"></span>[3](#fn_660.md).

<span id="page_477">p. 477</span>

'Formerly the duke of *K*âu at the border altar sacrificed to Hâu-*k*î
as the correlate of Heaven, and in the Brilliant Hall he honoured king
Wăn, and sacrificed to him as the correlate of God <span
id="fr_681"></span>[1](#fn_661.md). The

<span id="page_478">p. 478</span>

consequence was that from (all the states) within the four seas, every
(prince) came in the discharge of his duty to (assist in those)
sacrifices. In the virtue of the sages what besides was there greater
than filial piety?

'Now the feeling of affection grows up at the parents' knees, and as
(the duty of) nourishing those parents is exercised, the affection daily
merges in awe. The sages proceeded from the (feeling of) awe to teach
(the duties of) reverence, and from (that of) affection to teach (those
of) love. The teachings of the sages, without being severe, were
successful, and their government, without being rigorous,

<span id="page_479">p. 479</span>

was effective. What they proceeded from was the root (of filial piety
implanted by Heaven).

'The relation and duties between father and son, (thus belonging to) the
Heaven-conferred nature, (contain in them the principle of)
righteousness between ruler and subject <span
id="fr_682"></span>[1](#fn_662.md). The son derives his life from his
parents, and no greater gift could possibly be transmitted; his ruler
and parent (in one), his father deals with him accordingly, and no
generosity could be greater than this. Hence, he who does not love his
parents, but loves other men, is called a rebel against virtue; and he
who does not revere his parents, but reveres other men, is called a
rebel against propriety. When (the ruler) himself thus acts contrary to
(the principles) which should place him in accord (with all men), he
presents nothing for the people to imitate. He has nothing to do with
what is good, but entirely and only with what is injurious to virtue.
Though he may get (his will, and be above others), the superior man does
not give him his approval.

<span id="page_480">p. 480</span>

'It is not so with the superior man. He speaks, having thought whether
the words should be spoken; he acts, having thought whether his actions
are sure to give pleasure. His virtue and righteousness are such as will
be honoured; what he initiates and does is fit to be imitated; his
deportment is worthy of contemplation; his movements in advancing or
retiring are all according to the proper rule. In this way does he
present himself to the people, who both revere and love him, imitate and
become like him. Thus he is able to make his teaching of virtue
successful, and his government and orders to be carried into
effect <span id="fr_683"></span>[1](#fn_663.md).

'It is said in the Book of Poetry <span id="fr_684"></span>[2](#fn_664.md),

"The virtuous man, the princely one,  
Has nothing wrong in his deportment."'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_658"></span>[476:1](sbe03189.htm#fr_678.md) 'The sages' here
must mean the sage sovereigns of antiquity'. who had at once the highest
wisdom and the highest place.

<span id="fn_659"></span>[476:2](sbe03189.htm#fr_679.md) See a note on [p.
99](sbe03021.htm#page_99.md) on the meaning of the phrase 'the fellow of
God,' which is the same as that in this chapter, translated 'the
correlate of God.' P. Cibot goes at length. into a discussion of the
idea conveyed by the Chinese character P‘ei, but without coming to any
definite conclusion; and indeed Tâi Thung, author of the dictionary Liû
Shû Kû, says that 'its original significancy has baffled investigation,
while its classical usage is in the sense of "mate," "fellow."' The
meaning here is the second assigned to it on [p.
99](sbe03021.htm#page_99.md). In the Chinese Repository we find:--'As a
mark of reverence there is nothing more important than to place the
father on an equality with heaven;' which is by no means the idea, while
the author further distorts the meaning by the following note: 'T‘ien,
"Heaven," and Shang Tî, the "Supreme Ruler," seem to be perfectly
synonymous; and whatever ideas the Chinese attach to them, it is evident
that the noble lord of *K*âu regarded his ancestors, immediate and
remote, as their equals, and paid to the one the same homage as the
other. In thus elevating mortals to an equality with the Supreme Ruler,
he is upheld and approved by Confucius, and has been imitated by myriads
of every generation of his countrymen down to the present day.'

<span id="fn_660"></span>[476:3](sbe03189.htm#fr_680.md) It is difficult to
say in what the innovation of the duke of *K*âu <span id="page_477">p.
477</span> consisted. The editors of the Extensive Explanation of the
Hsiâo say:--'According to commentators on our classic, Shun thinking
only of the virtue of his ancestor did not sacrifice to him at the
border altar. The sovereigns of Hsiâ and Yin were the first to sacrifice
there to their ancestors; but they had not the ceremony of sacrificing
to their fathers as the correlates of Heaven. This began with the duke
of *K*âu.' To this explanation of the text the editors demur, and
consider that the noun 'father' in the previous sentence should be
taken, in the case of the duke of *K*âu, both of Hâu-*k*î and king Wăn.

<span id="fn_661"></span>[477:1](sbe03189.htm#fr_681.md) The reader of the
translations from the Shih must be familiar with Hâu-*k*î, as the
ancestor to whom the kings of *K*âu traced their lineage, and with king
Wăn, as the acknowledged founder of their dynasty in connexion with his
son, king Wû. Was any greater honour done to Hâu-*k*î in making him the
correlate of Heaven than to king Wăn in making him the correlate of God?
We must say, No. As is said in the Extensive Explanation, 'The words
Heaven and God are different, but their meaning is one and the same.'
The question is susceptible of easy determination. Let me refer the
reader to the translations from the Shih on pp. 317 and 329. The tenth
piece on the latter was sung, at the border sacrifice to Heaven, in
honour of Hâu-*k*î; and the first four lines of it are to the effect--

O thou, accomplished, great Hâu-*k*î!  
  To thee alone 'twas given  
To be, by what we trace to thee,  
  The correlate of Heaven;'

while the fifth and sixth lines are--

God had the wheat and barley meant  
  To nourish all mankind.  
None would have fathomed His intent,  
  But for thy guiding mind.'

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The seventh piece
on the former page was used at the sacrifice, in the Brilliant Hall, to
king Wăn, as 'the correlate of God.' The first three lines have been
versified by--

<span id="page_478">p. 478</span>

'My offerings here are given,  
  A ram, a bull.  
Accept them, mighty Heaven,  
  All-bountiful;'

and the sixth and seventh lines by--

'From Wăn comes blessing rich;  
  Now on the right  
He owns those gifts to which  
  Him I invite.'

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Since 'Heaven' and
'God' have the same reference, why are they used here as if there were
some opposition between them? The nearest approach to an answer to this
is found also in the Extensive Explanation, derived mainly from Khăn
Hsiang-tâo, of the Sung dynasty, and to the following effect:--' Heaven
(Tien) just is God (Tî). Heaven is a term specially expressive of
honour, and Hâu-*k*î was made the correlate of Heaven, because he was
remote, far distant from the worshipper. God is a term expressive of
affection, and king Wăn was made the correlate of God, because he was
nearer to, the father of, the duke of *K*âu.' Hsiang-tâo concludes by
saying that the sacrifice at the border altar was an old
institution,--while that in the Brilliant Hall was first appointed by
the duke of *K*âu. According to this view, Heaven would approximate to
the name for Deity in the absolute,--Jehovah, as explained in Exodus xv.
14; while Tî is God, our Father in heaven.'

<span id="fn_662"></span>[479:1](sbe03189.htm#fr_682.md) We find for this
in the Chinese Repository:--'The feelings which ought to characterise
the intercourse between father and son are of a heavenly nature,
resembling the bonds which exist between a prince and his ministers.' P.
Cibot gives:--'Les rapports immuable de père et de fils découlent de
l’essence même du Tien, et offrent la première idée de prince et de
sujet;' adding on the former clause this note:--'Les commentateurs ne
disent que des mots sur ces paroles; mais comment pourroient ils les
bien expliquer, puisqu’ils ne sauroient en entrevoir le sens supreme et
ineffable? Quelques-uns ont pris le parti de citer le texte de Tâo-teh
King (ch. 42), "Le Tâo est vie et unité; le premier a engendré le
second; les deux ont produit le troisième; le trois ont fait toutes
choses;" c’est-à-dire, qu’ils ont tâchè d’expliquer un texte qui les
passe, par un autre où ils ne comprennent rien.' But there is neither
difficulty in the construction of the text here, nor mystery in its
meaning.

<span id="fn_663"></span>[480:1](sbe03189.htm#fr_683.md) This paragraph may
be called a mosaic, formed by piecing together passages from the Ȝo
*K*wan.

<span id="fn_664"></span>[480:2](sbe03189.htm#fr_684.md) See the Shih, I,
xiv, ode 3, stanza 3.'
