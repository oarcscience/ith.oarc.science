##### ODE 2. THE Î HSÎ.

##### FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS TO THE OFFICERS OF HUSBANDRY.

Again there is a difficulty in determining to what sacrifice this piece
should be referred. The Preface says it was sung on the occasions of
sacrifice by the king to God, in spring and summer, for a good year. But
the note on the first two lines will show that this view cannot be
accepted without modification.

Oh! yes, king *Kh*ăng <span id="fr_367"></span>[2](#fn_355.md) Brightly
brought himself near <span id="fr_368"></span>[2](#fn_355.md). Lead your
husbandmen To sow their various kinds of grain, Going vigorously to work

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

on your private fields <span id="fr_369"></span>[1](#fn_356.md), All over
the thirty lî <span id="fr_370"></span>[2](#fn_357.md). Attend to your
ploughing, With your ten thousand men all in pairs.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_355"></span>[321:2](sbe03081.htm#fr_368.md) These first two
lines are all but unmanageable. The old critics held that there was no
mention of king *Kh*ăng in them; but the text is definite on this point.
We must suppose that a special service had been performed at his shrine,
asking him to intimate the day when the sacrifice after which the
instructions were given should be performed; and that a directing oracle
had been received.

<span id="fn_356"></span>[322:1](sbe03081.htm#fr_369.md) The mention of
'the private fields' implies that there were also 'the public fields,'
cultivated by the husbandmen in common, in behalf of the government. As
the people are elsewhere introduced, wishing that the rain might first
fall on 'the public fields,' to show their loyalty, so the king here
mentions only 'the private fields,' to show his sympathy and
consideration for the people.

<span id="fn_357"></span>[322:2](sbe03081.htm#fr_370.md) For the
cultivation of the ground, the allotments of single families were
separated by a small ditch; ten allotments, by a larger; a hundred, by
what we may call a brook; a thousand, by a small stream; and ten
thousand, by a river. The space occupied by 10,000 families formed a
square of a little more than thirty-two lî. We may suppose that this
space was intended by the round number of thirty lî in the text. So at
least *K*ăng Khang-*kh*ăng explained it.
