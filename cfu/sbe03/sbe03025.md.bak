### BOOK IX. THE DAY OF THE SUPPLEMENTARY SACRIFICE TO KÂO ȜUNG.

KÂO ȜUNG was the title given to Wû-ting, after his death, in the
ancestral temple. A supplementary sacrifice was offered on the day
following the regular and more solemn service. What special idea was
connected with it, it would be difficult to say;

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

but at the close of it, the representatives or personators of the dead
in the sacrifice of the preceding day were all feasted.

The title of this short Book leaves it uncertain whether the sacrifice
was offered to Wû-ting or by him. The prefatory notice proceeds on the
former view. Many critics of great intelligence decide for the latter,
which a renewed consideration of the text has induced me to adopt. The
king then is Ȝû-kăng, Wû-ting's son. Something irregular or excessive in
his sacrificing to his father was the thing which his monitor Ȝû Kî
wished to censure, taking occasion to do so from the incident mentioned
in the first sentence.

On the day of the supplementary sacrifice of Kâo Ȝung, there appeared a
crowing pheasant <span id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_119.md). Ȝû Kî said, 'To
rectify this affair, the king must first be corrected.' He delivered
accordingly a lesson to the king, saying, 'In its inspection of men
below, Heaven's first consideration is of their righteousness, and it
bestows on them (accordingly) length of years or the contrary.\* It is
not Heaven that cuts short men's lives; they bring them to an end
themselves. Some men who have not complied with virtue will yet not
acknowledge their offences, and when Heaven has by evident tokens
charged them to correct their conduct, they still say, "What are these
things to us?"

'Oh! our Majesty's business is to care reverently for the people. And
all (your ancestors) were the heirs of (the kingdom by the gift of
Heaven;--in attending to the sacrifices (to them), be not so excessive
in those to your father.'\*

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_119"></span>[119:1](sbe03025.htm#fr_123.md) Sze-mâ *Kh*ien,
after the prefatory notice, says that the pheasant sat on the ear--one
of the handles--of a tripod.
