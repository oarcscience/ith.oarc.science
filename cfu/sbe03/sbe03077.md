##### ODE 8. THE SHIH MÂI.

##### APPROPRIATE TO KING WÛ'S SACRIFICING TO HEAVEN, AND TO THE SPIRITS OF THE HILLS AND RIVERS, ON A PROGRESS THROUGH THE KINGDOM, AFTER THE OVERTHROW OF THE SHANG DYNASTY.

Here again there is an agreement among the critics. We find from the Ȝo
*K*wan and 'the Narratives of the States.' that the

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

piece was, when those compilations were made, considered to be the work
of the duke of *K*âu; and, no doubt, it was made by him soon after the
accession of Wû to the kingdom, and when he was making a royal progress
in assertion of his being appointed by Heaven to succeed to the rulers
of Shang. The 'I' in the fourteenth line is, most probably, to be taken
of the duke of *K*âu, who may have recited the piece on occasion of the
sacrifices, in the hearing of the assembled princes and lords.

Now is he making a progress through his states; May Heaven deal with him
as its son!

Truly are the honour and succession come from it to the House of *K*âu.
To his movements All respond with tremulous awe. He has attempted and
given rest to all spiritual beings <span
id="fr_363"></span>[1](#fn_351), Even to (the spirits of.md) the Ho and the
highest hills. Truly is the king our sovereign lord.

Brilliant and illustrious is the House of *K*âu. He has regulated the
positions of the princes; He has called in shields and spears; He has
returned to their cases bows and arrows <span
id="fr_364"></span>[2](#fn_352.md). He will cultivate admirable virtue, And
display it throughout these great regions. Truly will the king preserve
the appointment.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_351"></span>[318:1](sbe03077.htm#fr_363.md) 'All spiritual
beings' is, literally, 'the hundred spirits,' meaning the spirits
presiding, under Heaven, over all nature, and especially the spirits of
the rivers and hills throughout the kingdom. Those of the Ho and the
lofty mountains are mentioned, because if their spirits Were satisfied
with Wû, those of all other mountains and hills, no doubt, were so.

<span id="fn_352"></span>[318:2](sbe03077.htm#fr_364.md) Compare with these
lines the last chapter of 'the Completion of the War' in the Shû.
