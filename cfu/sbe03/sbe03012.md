### BOOK IV. THE YÎ AND *K*Î.

Yî and *K*î, the names of Shun's Forester and Minister of Agriculture,
both of whom receive their appointments in Book i, occur near the
commencement of this Book, and occasion is thence taken to give its
title to the whole. But without good reason; for these worthies do not
appear at all as interlocutors

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

in it. Yî is the principal speaker; the Book belongs to the class of
'Counsels.'

To Yî there is, of course, assigned an ancient and illustrious descent;
what is of more importance, is that the lords of *Kh*in, who finally
superseded the kings of *K*âu, traced their lineage to him. *Kh*î was
the name of *K*î, the character for the latter term meaning 'Millet,'
and *Kh*î was so styled from his labours in teaching the people to sow
and reap, so that *K*î became equivalent to 'Minister of Agriculture.'

The contents of the Book have been divided into three chapters. The
first gives a conversation between Shun and Yü. Yü relates his own
diligence and achievements as a model to Shun, and gives him various
admonitions, while Shun insists on what his ministers should be, and
wherein he wished them to help him. In the second chapter, Khwei, the
Minister of Music, makes his appearance; it has no apparent connexion
with the former. In the third, Shun and Kâo-yâo sing to each other on
the mutual relation of the sovereign and his ministers.

1\. The Tî said, 'Come Yü, you also must have excellent words (to bring
before me).' Yü did obeisance, and said, 'Oh! what can I say, O Tî,
(after Kâo-yâo)? I can (only) think of maintaining a daily assiduity.'
Kâo-yâo said, 'Alas I will you describe it?' Yü replied, 'The inundating
waters seemed to assail the heavens, and in their vast extent embraced
the hills and overtopped the great mounds, so that the people were
bewildered and. overwhelmed. I mounted my four conveyances <span
id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_67.md), and all along the hills hewed down the
trees, at the same time, along with Yî, showing the multitudes how to
get flesh to eat. I (also) opened passages for the streams (throughout
the) nine (provinces), and conducted them to the four seas. I deepened
(moreover) the channels and canals, and conducted them to the streams,
sowing (grain), at the same time,

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

along with *K*î, and showing the multitudes how to procure the food of
toil, (in addition to) the flesh meat. I urged them (further) to
exchange what they had for what they had not, and to dispose of their
accumulated stores. (In this way) all the people got grain to eat, and
the myriad regions began to come under good rule.' Kâo-yâo said, 'Yes,
we ought to model ourselves after your excellent words.'

Yî said, 'Oh! carefully maintain, O Tî, the throne which you occupy.'
The Tî replied, 'Yes;' and Yü went on, 'Find your repose in your
(proper) resting-point Attend to the springs of things; study stability;
and let your assistants be the upright:--then shall your movements be
grandly responded to, (as if the people only) waited for your will. Thus
you will brightly receive (the favour of) God;--will not Heaven renew
its appointment of you, and give you blessing?'\*

The Tî said, 'Alas! what are ministers?--are they not (my) associates?
What are associates?--are they not (my) ministers?' Yü replied, 'Yes:'
and the Tî went on, 'My ministers constitute my legs and arms, my ears
and eyes. I wish to help and support my people;--you give effect to my
wishes. I wish to spread the influence (of my government) through the
four quarters;--you act as my agents. I wish to see the emblematic
figures of the ancients,--the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountain,
the dragons, and the flowery fowl (= the pheasant), which are depicted
(on the upper garment); the temple cups, the pondweed, the flames, the
grains of rice, the hatchet, and the symbol of distinction, which are
embroidered (on the lower Garment),--(I wish to see all these) fully
displayed

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

in the five colours, so as to form the (ceremonial) robes;--it is yours
to see them clearly (for me). I wish to hear the six pitch-tubes, the
five notes (determined by them), and the eight kinds of musical
instruments (regulated again by these), examining thereby the virtues
and defects of government, according as (the odes that) go forth (from
the court, set to music), and come in (from the people), are ordered by
those five notes;--it is yours to hear them (for me). When I am doing
wrong, it is yours to correct me;--do not follow me to my face, and,
when you have retired, have other remarks to make. Be reverent, ye
associates, who are before and behind and on each side of me! As to all
the obstinately stupid and calumniating talkers, who are found not to be
doing what is right, are there not--the target to exhibit (their true
character) <span id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_68.md), the scourge to make them
recollect, and the book of remembrance <span
id="fr_71"></span>[2](#fn_69.md)? Do we not wish them to live along with
us? There are also the masters (of music) to receive their compositions,
(set them to music), and continually publish them (as corrected by
themselves). If they become reformed they are to be received and
employed; if they do not, let the terrors (of punishment) overtake
them.'

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

Yü said, 'So far good! But let your light shine, O Tî, all under heaven,
even to every grassy corner of the sea-shore, and throughout the myriad
regions the most worthy of the people will all (wish) to be your
ministers. Then, O Tî, you may advance them to office. They will set
forth, and you will receive, their reports; you will make proof of them
according to their merits; you will confer chariots and robes according
to their services. Who will then dare not to cultivate a humble virtue?
who will dare not to respond to you with reverence? If you, O Tî, do not
act thus, all (your ministers) together will daily proceed to a
meritless character.'

'Be not haughty like Kû of Tan <span id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_70.md), who
found his pleasure only in indolence and dissipation, and pursued a
proud oppressive course. Day and night without ceasing he was thus. He
would make boats go where there was no water. He introduced licentious
associates into his family. The consequence was that he brought the
prosperity of his house to an end. I took warning from his course. When
I married in Thû-shan <span id="fr_73"></span>[2](#fn_71.md), (I remained
with my wife only the days) hsin, *z*ăn, kwei, and *k*iâ. When (my son)
*Kh*î was wailing and weeping, I did not regard him, but kept planning
with all my might my labour on the land. (Then) I assisted in completing
the five Tenures <span id="fr_74"></span>[3](#fn_72.md), extending over
5000 lî <span id="fr_75"></span>[4](#fn_73); (in appointing.md) in the
provinces twelve Tutors, and in establishing

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

in the regions beyond, reaching to the four seas, five Presidents. These
all pursue the right path, and are meritorious; but there are still (the
people of) Miâo, who obstinately refuse to render their service. Think
of this, O Tî.' The Tî said, 'That my virtue is followed is the result
of your meritorious services so orderly displayed. And now Kâo-yâo,
entering respectfully into your arrangements, is on every hand
displaying the (various) punishments, as represented, with entire
intelligence.'

2\. Khwei said, 'When the sounding-stone is tapped or struck with force,
and the lutes are strongly swept or gently touched, to accompany the
singing, the progenitors (of the Tî) come (to the service),\* the guest
of Yü <span id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_74.md) is in his place, and all the
princes show their virtue in giving place to one another. (In the court)
below (the hall) there are the flutes and hand-drums, which join in at
the sound of the rattle, and cease at that of the stopper, when the
organ and bells take their place. (This makes) birds and beasts fall
moving. When the nine parts of the service, as arranged by the Tî, have
all been performed, the male and female phœnix come with their measured
gambolings (into the court).'

Khwei said, 'Oh! when I smite the (sounding-) stone, or gently strike
it, the various animals lead on one another to dance <span
id="fr_77"></span>[2](#fn_75.md), and all the chiefs of the official
departments become truly harmonious.'

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

3\. The Tî on this made a song, saying, 'We must deal cautiously with
the favouring appointment of Heaven, at every moment and in the smallest
particular.'\* He then sang.

'When the members (work) joyfully,  
The head rises (grandly);  
And the duties of all the offices are fully discharged!

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Kâo-yâo did
obeisance with his head to his hands and then to the ground, and with a
loud and rapid voice said,' Think (O Tî). It is your to lead on and
originate things. Pay careful attention to your laws (in doing so). Be
reverential! and often examine what has been accomplished (by your
officers). Be reverential!' With this he continued the song,

'When the head is intelligent,  
The members are good;  
And all affairs will be happily performed!'

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Again he continued
the song,

'When the head is vexatious,  
The members are idle;  
And all affairs will go to ruin!'

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Tî said, 'Yes,
go and be reverently (attentive to your duties).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_67"></span>[57:1](sbe03012.htm#fr_69.md) See the Introduction,
pp. 16, 17.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[59:1](sbe03012.htm#fr_70.md) Archery was anciently
made much of in China, and supposed to be a test of character. Unworthy
men would not be found hitting frequently, and observing the various
rules of the exercise. Confucius more than once spoke of archery as a
discipline of virtue; see Analects, III, xvi.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[59:2](sbe03012.htm#fr_71.md) In the Official Book
of *K*âu, the heads of districts are required to keep a register of the
characters of the people. Shun's Book of Remembrance would be a record
on wood or cloth. The reference implies the use of writing.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[60:1](sbe03012.htm#fr_72.md) This was the son of
Yâo. He must have been made lord of some principality, called Tan.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[60:2](sbe03012.htm#fr_73.md) Yü married the
daughter of the lord of Thû-shan, a principality in the present
department of Făng-yung, An-hui.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[60:3](sbe03012.htm#fr_74.md) See in the Tribute of
Yü, Part II.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[60:4](sbe03012.htm#fr_75.md) The lî is what is
called the Chinese mile, generally reckoned to be 360 paces.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[61:1](sbe03012.htm#fr_76.md) *K*û of Tan.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[61:2](sbe03012.htm#fr_77.md) These last words of
Khwei have already appeared in Book i, ch. 5. They are more in place
here, though this second chapter has no apparent connexion with what
precedes. 'The stone' is the sonorous stone formed, often in the shape
of a carpenter's square, into a musical instrument, still seen
everywhere in China.
