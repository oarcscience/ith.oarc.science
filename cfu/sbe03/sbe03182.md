## CHAPTER II.

## FILIAL PIETY IN THE SON OF HEAVEN.

He who loves his parents will not dare (to incur the risk of) being
hated by any man, and he who reveres his parents will not dare (to incur
the risk of) being contemned by any man <span
id="fr_656"></span>[2](#fn_636.md). When the love and reverence (of the Son
of Heaven) are thus carried to the utmost in the service of his parents,
the lessons of his virtue affect all the people, and he becomes

<span id="page_468">p. 468</span>

a pattern to (all within) the four seas <span
id="fr_657"></span>[1](#fn_637.md):--this is the filial piety of the Son of
Heaven <span id="fr_658"></span>[2](#fn_638.md).

It is said in (the Marquis of) Fû on Punishments <span
id="fr_659"></span>[3](#fn_639.md),

'The One man will have felicity, and the millions of the People will
depend on (what ensures his happiness).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_636"></span>[467:2](sbe03182.htm#fr_656.md) The thing thus
generally stated must be understood specially of the sovereign, and only
he who stands related to all other men can give its full manifestation.
Previous translators have missed the peculiarity of the construction in
each of the clauses. Thus P. Cibot gives:--'He who loves his parents
will not dare to hate any one,' &c. But in the second member we have a
well-known form in Chinese to give the force of the passive voice.
Attention is called to this in the Extensive Explanation of the Hsiâo
(see p. 461):--'Wû yü *z*ăn does not mean merely to hate men; it
indicates an anxious apprehension lest the hatred of men should light on
me, and my parents thereby be involved in it.'

<span id="fn_637"></span>[468:1](sbe03182.htm#fr_657.md) Chinese scholars
make 'the people' to be the subjects of the king, and 'all within the
four seas' to be the barbarous tribes outside the four borders of the
kingdom, between them and the seas or oceans within which the habitable
earth was contained--according to the earliest geographical conceptions.
All we have to find in the language is the unbounded, the universal,
influence of 'the Son of Heaven.'

<span id="fn_638"></span>[468:2](sbe03182.htm#fr_658.md) The appellation
'Son of Heaven' for the sovereign was unknown in the earliest times of
the Chinese nation. It cannot be traced beyond the Shang dynasty.

<span id="fn_639"></span>[468:3](sbe03182.htm#fr_659.md) See the Shû, V,
xxvii, 4, and the note on the name of that Book, [p.
254](sbe03054.htm#page_254.md).
