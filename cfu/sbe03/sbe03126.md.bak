### The Eighth Decade, or that of Po Hwâ.

#### ODE 5, STANZAS 1 AND 2. THE PO HWÂ.

#### THE QUEEN OF KING YÛ COMPLAINS OF BEING DEGRADED AND FORSAKEN.

The fibres from the white-flowered rush Are bound with the white
grass <span id="fr_486"></span>[1](#fn_469.md). This man's sending me away
makes me dwell solitary.

The light and brilliant clouds Bedew the rush and the grass <span
id="fr_487"></span>[2](#fn_470.md). The way of Heaven is hard and
difficult <span id="fr_488"></span>[3](#fn_471.md);--This man does not
conform (to good principle).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_469"></span>[376:1](sbe03126.htm#fr_486.md) The stalks of the
rush were tied with the grass in bundles, in order to be steeped;--an
operation which ladies in those days might be supposed to be familiar
with. The two lines suggest the idea of the close connexion between the
two plants, and the necessariness of the one to the other;--as it should
be between husband and wife.

<span id="fn_470"></span>[376:2](sbe03126.htm#fr_487.md) The clouds
bestowed their dewy influence on the plants, while her husband neglected
the speaker.

<span id="fn_471"></span>[376:3](sbe03126.htm#fr_488.md) 'The way of
Heaven' is equivalent to our 'The course of Providence.' The lady's
words are, literally, 'The steps of Heaven.' She makes but a feeble
wail; but in Chinese opinion discharges thereby, all the better, the
duty of a wife.
