## CHAPTER XIII. AMPLIFICATION OF 'THE PERFECT VIRTUE' IN CHAPTER I.

The Master said, 'The teaching of filial piety by the superior man <span
id="fr_688"></span>[2](#fn_668.md) does not require that he should go to,
family after family, and daily see the members of each. His teaching of
filial piety is a tribute of reverence to all the fathers under heaven;
his teaching of fraternal submission is a tribute of reverence to all
the elder brothers under heaven; his teaching of the duty of a subject
is a tribute of reverence to all the rulers under heaven.

'It is said in the Book of Poetry <span id="fr_689"></span>[1](#fn_669.md),

"The happy and courteous sovereign  
Is the parent of the people."

'If it were not a perfect virtue, how could it be recognised as in
accordance with their nature by the people so extensively as this?'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_668"></span>[482:2](sbe03193.htm#fr_688.md) The *K*ün-ȝze, or
'superior man,' here must be taken of the sovereign. P. Cibot translates
it by 'un prince.'

<span id="fn_669"></span>[483:1](sbe03193.htm#fr_689.md) See the Shih, III,
ii, ode 7, stanza x. The two lines of the Shih here are, possibly, not
an interpolation.
