#### ODE 8. THE TÂ THIEN.

#### FURTHER PICTURES OF HUSBANDRY, AND SACRIFICES CONNECTED WITH IT.

Large are the fields, and various is the work to be done. Having
selected the seed, and looked after the implements, So that all
preparations have been made for our labour, We take our sharp
ploughshares, And commence on the south-lying acres. We sow all the
kinds of grain, Which grow up straight and large, So that the wish of
the distant descendant is satisfied.

It ears and the fruit lies soft in its sheath; It hardens and is of good
quality; There is no wolf's-tail grass nor darnel. We remove the insects
that eat the heart and the leaf, And those that eat the roots and the
joints, So that they shall not hurt the young plants of our fields. May
the spirit, the Father of Husbandry <span
id="fr_473"></span>[1](#fn_457.md), Lay hold of them, and put them in the
blazing fire!

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

The clouds form in dense masses,. And the rain comes down slowly. May it
first rain on our public fields <span id="fr_474"></span>[1](#fn_458.md),
And then come to our private Yonder shall be young grain unreaped, And
here some bundles ungathered; Yonder shall be handfuls left on the
ground, And here ears untouched:--For the benefit of the widow <span
id="fr_475"></span>[2](#fn_459.md).

The distant descendant will come, When their wives and children Are
bringing food to those (at work) on the south-lying acres. The surveyor
of the fields (also) will come and be glad. They will come and offer
pure sacrifices to (the spirits of the four) quarters, With their
victims red and black <span id="fr_476"></span>[3](#fn_460.md), With their
preparations of millet:--Thus offering, thus sacrificing, Thus
increasing our bright happiness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_457"></span>[372:1](sbe03123.htm#fr_473.md) The ancient Shăn
Năng, as in the preceding ode.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[373:1](sbe03123.htm#fr_474.md) These are two
famous lines, continually quoted as showing the loyal attachment of the
people to their superiors in those ancient times.

<span id="fn_459"></span>[373:2](sbe03123.htm#fr_475.md) Compare the
legislation of Moses, in connexion with the harvest, for the benefit of
the poor, in Deuteronomy xxiv. 19-22.

<span id="fn_460"></span>[373:3](sbe03123.htm#fr_476.md) They would not
sacrifice to these spirits all at once, or all in one place, but in the
several quarters as they went along on their progress through the
domain. For each quarter the colour of the victim was different. A red
victim was offered to the spirit of the south, and a black to that of
the north.
