#### ODE 6. THE SZE *K*ÂI.

#### THE VIRTUE OF WĂN, WITH HIS FILIAL PIETY AND CONSTANT REVERENCE, AND THEIR WONDERFUL EFFECTS. THE EXCELLENT CHARACTER OF HIS MOTHER AND WIFE.

Pure and reverent was Thâi *Z*ăn <span id="fr_524"></span>[5](#fn_506.md),
The mother of king Wăn. Loving was she to *K*âu *K*iang <span
id="fr_525"></span>[6](#fn_507.md);--

<span id="page_388">p. 388</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> A wife becoming
the House of *K*âu. Thâi Sze <span id="fr_526"></span>[1](#fn_508.md)
inherited her excellent fame, And from her came a hundred sons <span
id="fr_527"></span>[2](#fn_509.md).

He conformed to the example of his ancestors, And their spirits had no
occasion for complaint. Their spirits had no occasion for
dissatisfaction; And his example acted on his wife, Extended to his
brethren, And was felt by all the clans and states.

Full of harmony was he in his palace; Full of reverence in the ancestral
temple. Unseen (by men), he still felt that he was under
inspection <span id="fr_528"></span>[3](#fn_510.md): Unweariedly he
maintained his virtue.

Though he could not prevent (some) great calamities, His brightness and
magnanimity were without stain. Without previous instruction he did what
was right; Without admonition he went on (in the path of goodness).

So, grown up men became virtuous (through him), And young men made
(constant) attainments. (Our) ancient prince never felt weariness, And
from him were the fame and eminence of his officers.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_506"></span>[387:5](sbe03132.htm#fr_524.md) Thâi *Z*ăn is
celebrated, above, in the second ode.

<span id="fn_507"></span>[387:6](sbe03132.htm#fr_525.md) *K*âu *K*iang is
'the lady *K*iang' of ode 3, the wife of Than-fû or <span
id="page_388">p. 388</span> king Thâi, who came with him from Pin. She
is here called Kâu, as having married the lord of *K*âu.

<span id="fn_508"></span>[388:1](sbe03132.htm#fr_526.md) Thâi Sze, the wife
of Wăn, we are told in ode 2, was from the state of Hsin. The surname
Sze shows that its lords must have been descended from the Great Yü.

<span id="fn_509"></span>[388:2](sbe03132.htm#fr_527.md) We are not to
suppose that Thâi Sze had herself a hundred sons. She had ten, and her
freedom from jealousy so encouraged the fruitfulness of the harem, that
all the sons born in it are ascribed to her.

<span id="fn_510"></span>[388:3](sbe03132.htm#fr_528.md) Where there was no
human eye to observe him, Wan still felt that he was open to the
observation of spiritual beings.
