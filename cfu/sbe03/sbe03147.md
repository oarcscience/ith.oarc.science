#### ODE 4. THE YUN HAN.

#### KING HSÜAN, ON OCCASION OF A GREAT DROUGHT, EXPOSTULATES WITH GOD AND ALL THE SPIRITS, WHO MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO HELP HIM AND HIS PEOPLE; ASKS THEM WHEREFORE THEY WERE CONTENDING WITH HIM; AND DETAILS THE MEASURES HE HAD TAKEN, AND WAS STILL TAKING, FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE CALAMITY.

King Hsüan does not occur by name in the ode, though the remarkable
prayer which it relates is ascribed to a king in stanza 1. All critics
have admitted the statement of the Preface that the piece was made, in
admiration of king Hsüan, by *Z*ăng Shû, a great officer, we may
presume, of the court. The standard chronology places the commencement
of the drought in B.C. 822, the sixth year of Hsüan's reign. How long it
continued we cannot tell.

Bright was the milky way, Shining and revolving in the sky. The king
said, 'Oh! What crime is chargeable on us now, That Heaven (thus) sends
down death and disorder? Famine comes again and again. There is no
spirit I have not sacrificed to <span id="fr_592"></span>[2](#fn_572.md);
There is no victim I have grudged; Our

<span id="page_420">p. 420</span>

jade symbols, oblong and round, are exhausted <span
id="fr_593"></span>[1](#fn_573.md);--How is it that I am not heard?

'The drought is excessive; Its fervours become more and more tormenting.
I have not ceased offering pure sacrifices; From the border altars I
have gone to the ancestral temple <span id="fr_594"></span>[2](#fn_574.md).
To the (Powers) above and below I have presented my offerings and then'
buried them <span id="fr_595"></span>[3](#fn_575.md);--There is no spirit
whom I have not honoured. Hâu-*k*î is not equal to the occasion; God
does not come to us. This wasting and ruin of our country,--Would that
it fell (only) on me!

'The drought is excessive, And I may not try to excuse myself. I am full
of terror, and feel the peril, Like the clap of thunder or the roll. Of
the remnant of *K*âu, among the black-haired people, There will not be
half a man left; Nor will God from his great heaven exempt (even) me.
Shall

<span id="page_421">p. 421</span>

we not mingle our fears together? (The sacrifices to) my ancestors will
be extinguished <span id="fr_596"></span>[1](#fn_576.md).

'The drought is excessive, And it cannot be stopped. More fierce and
fiery, It is leaving me no place. My end is near;--I have none to look
up, none to look round, to. The many dukes and their ministers of the
past <span id="fr_597"></span>[2](#fn_577.md) Give me no help. O ye parents
and (nearer) ancestors <span id="fr_598"></span>[3](#fn_578.md), How can ye
bear to see me thus?

'The drought is excessive;--Parched are the hills, and the streams are
dried. The demon of drought exercises his oppression, As if scattering
flames and fire <span id="fr_599"></span>[4](#fn_579.md) My heart is
terrified with the heat;--My sorrowing heart is as if on fire. The

<span id="page_422">p. 422</span>

many dukes and their ministers of the past Do not hear me. O God, from
thy great heaven, Grant me the liberty to withdraw (into
retirement <span id="fr_600"></span>[1](#fn_580).md).

'The drought is excessive;--I struggle and fear to go away. How is it
that I am afflicted with this drought? I cannot ascertain the cause of
it. In praying for a good year I was abundantly early <span
id="fr_601"></span>[2](#fn_581). I was not late (in sacrificing.md) to (the
spirits of) the four quarters and of the land <span
id="fr_602"></span>[3](#fn_582.md). God in great heaven Does not consider
me. Reverent to the intelligent spirits, I ought not to be thus the
object of their anger.

'The drought is excessive;--All is dispersion, and the bonds of
government are relaxed. Reduced to extremities are the heads of
departments; Full of distress are my chief ministers, The Master of the
Horse, the Commander of the Guards, The chief Cook <span
id="fr_603"></span>[4](#fn_583.md), and my attendants. There is no one who
has not (tried to) help (the people); They have not refrained on the
ground of being unable. I look up to the great heaven;--Why am I plunged
in this sorrow?

'I look up to the great heaven, But its stars sparkle bright. My great
officers and excellent men, Ye have reverently drawn near (to Heaven)
with all

<span id="page_423">p. 423</span>

your powers. Death is approaching, But do not cast away what you have
done. You are seeking not for me only, But to give rest to all our
departments. I look up to the great heaven;--When shall I be favoured
with repose?'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_572"></span>[419:2](sbe03147.htm#fr_592.md) In the Official
Book of *K*âu, among the duties of the Minister of Instruction, or, as
Biot translates the title, 'the Director of the Multitudes,' it is
stated that one of the things he has to do, on occurrences of famine, is
'to seek out the spirits,' that is, as explained by the commentators, to
see that sacrifices are offered to all the spirits, even such as may
have been discontinued. This rule had, no doubt, been acted on during
the drought which this ode describes.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[420:1](sbe03147.htm#fr_593.md) We have, in the
sixth Book of the fifth Part of the Shû, an instance of the use of the
symbols here mentioned in sacrificing to the spirits of departed kings.
The Official Book, among the duties of the Minister of Religion,
mentions the use of these and other symbols--in all six, of different
shapes and colours--at the different sacrifices.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[420:2](sbe03147.htm#fr_594.md) By 'the border
altars' we are to understand the altars in the suburbs of the capital,
where Heaven and Earth were sacrificed to the great services at the
solstices, and any other seasons. The mention of Hâu-*k*î in the seventh
line makes us think especially of the service in the spring, to pray for
a good year, when Hâu-*k*î was associated with God.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[420:3](sbe03147.htm#fr_595) 'The (Powers.md)
above and below' are Heaven and Earth. The offerings, during the
progress of the service, were placed on the ground, or on the altars,
and buried in the earth at the close of it. This explains what the king
says in the first stanza about the offerings of jade being exhausted.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[421:1](sbe03147.htm#fr_596.md) Equivalent to the
extinction of the dynasty.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[421:2](sbe03147.htm#fr_597.md) The king had
sacrificed to all the early lords of *K*âu. 'The many dukes' may
comprehend kings Thâi and *K*î. He had also sacrificed to their
ministers. Compare what Pan-kăng says in the Shû, [p.
109](sbe03023.htm#page_109.md), about his predecessors and their ministers.
Some take 'the many dukes, and the ministers,' of all princes of states
who had signalised themselves by services to the people and kingdom.

<span id="fn_578"></span>[421:3](sbe03147.htm#fr_598.md) The king could
hardly hope that his father, the oppressive Lî, would in his
spirit-state give him any aid; but we need only find in his words the
expression of natural feeling. Probably it was the consideration of the
character of Lî which has made some critics understand by 'parents' and
'ancestors' the same individuals, namely, kings Wăn and Wû, 'the
ancestors' of Hsüan, and who had truly been 'the parents' of the people.

<span id="fn_579"></span>[421:4](sbe03147.htm#fr_599.md) Khung Ying-tâ,
from 'the Book of Spirits and Marvels,' gives the following account of
'the demon of drought:'--'In the southern regions there is a man, two or
three cubits in height, with the upper part of his body bare, and his
eyes in the top of his head. He runs with the speed of the wind, and is
named Po. In whatever state he appears, there ensues a great drought.'
The Book of Spirits and Marvels, however, as it now exists, cannot be
older, than our fourth or fifth century.

<span id="fn_580"></span>[422:1](sbe03147.htm#fr_600.md) That is, to
withdraw and give place to a more worthy sovereign.

<span id="fn_581"></span>[422:2](sbe03147.htm#fr_601.md) This was the
border sacrifice to God, when Hâu-*k*î was associated with him. Some
critics add a sacrifice in the first month of winter, for a blessing on
the ensuing year, offered to 'the honoured ones of heaven,'--the sun,
moon, and zodiacal constellations.

<span id="fn_582"></span>[422:3](sbe03147.htm#fr_602.md) See note 2 on [p.
371](sbe03122.htm#page_371.md).

<span id="fn_583"></span>[422:4](sbe03147.htm#fr_603.md) See note 1 on [p.
356](sbe03111.htm#page_356.md).
