#### ODE 4, STANZAS 1 AND 2. THE YÎ PHO.

Abundant is the growth of the buckthorn and shrubby trees, Supplying
firewood; yea, stores of it <span id="fr_515"></span>[1](#fn_498.md).
Elegant and dignified was our prince and king; On the left and the right
they hastened to him.

Elegant and dignified was our prince and king; On his left and his right
they bore their half-mace (libation-cups) <span

beseemed such eminent officers.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_498"></span>[386:1](sbe03130.htm#fr_515.md) It is difficult to
trace the connexion between-these allusive lines and the rest of the
piece.

<span id="fn_499"></span>[386:2](sbe03130.htm#fr_516.md) Here we have the
lord of *K*âu in his ancestral temple, assisted by his ministers or
great officers in pouring out the libations to the spirits of the
departed. The libation-cup was fitted with a handle of jade, that used
by the king having a complete kwei, the obelisk-like symbol of rank,
while the cups used by a minister had for a handle only half a kwei.
