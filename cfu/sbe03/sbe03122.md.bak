#### ODE 7. THE PHÛ THIEN.

#### PICTURES OF HUSBANDRY, AND SACRIFICES CONNECTED WITH IT. HAPPY UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND THEIR SUPERIORS.

It is difficult to say who the 'I' in the piece is, but evidently he and
the 'distant descendant' are different persons. I suppose he may have
been an officer, who had charge of the farms, as we may call them, in
the royal domain.

Bright are those extensive fields, A tenth of whose produce is annually
levied <span id="fr_469"></span>[3](#fn_453.md). I take the old

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

stores, And with them feed the husbandmen. From of old we have had good
years; And now I go to the south-lying acres, Where some are weeding,
and some gather the earth about the roots. The millets look luxuriant;
And in a spacious resting place, I collect and encourage the men of
greater promise <span id="fr_470"></span>[1](#fn_454.md).

With my vessels full of bright millet, And my pure victim-rams, we
sacrificed at the altar of the spirits of the land, and at (the altars
of those of the four) quarters <span id="fr_471"></span>[2](#fn_455.md).
That my fields are in such good condition is matter of joy to the
husbandmen. With lutes, and with drums beating, We will invoke the
Father of Husbandry <span id="fr_472"></span>[3](#fn_456.md) And pray for
sweet rain, To increase the produce of our millets, And to bless my men
and their wives.

The distant descendant comes, When their wives and children Are bringing
food to those (at work) in the south-lying acres. The surveyor of the
fields (also) comes and is glad. He takes (of the food) on the left and
the right, And tastes whether

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

it be good or not. The grain is well cultivated, all, the acres over;
Good will it be and abundant. The distant descendant has no displacency;
The husbandmen are encouraged to diligence.

The crops of the distant descendant Look (thick) as thatch, and
(swelling) like a carriage-cover. His stacks will stand like islands and
mounds. He will seek for thousands of granaries; He will seek for tens
of thousands of carts. The millets, the paddy, and the maize Will awake
the joy of the husbandmen; (And they will say),'May he be rewarded with
great happiness, With myriads of years, life without end!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_453"></span>[370:3](sbe03122.htm#fr_469.md) This line,
literally, is, 'Yearly are taken ten (and a) thousand meaning the
produce of ten acres in every hundred, and of a thousand in every ten
thousand.

<span id="fn_454"></span>[371:1](sbe03122.htm#fr_470.md) The general rule
was that the sons of husbandmen should continue husbandmen; but their
superior might select those among them in whom he saw promising
abilities, and facilitate their advancement to the higher grade of
officers.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[371:2](sbe03122.htm#fr_471.md) The sacrifices
here mentioned were of thanksgiving at the end of the harvest of the
preceding year. The one was to 'sovereign Earth,' supposed to be the
supreme Power in correlation with Heaven, or, possibly, to the spirits
supposed to preside over the productive energies of the land; the other
to the spirits presiding over the four quarters of the sky, and ruling
all atmospherical influences.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[371:3](sbe03122.htm#fr_472.md) This was the
sacrifice that had been, or was about to be, offered in spring to 'the
Father of Husbandry,'--probably the ancient mythical Tî, Shăn Năng.
