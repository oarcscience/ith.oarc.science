#### ODE 10. THE WĂN WANG YÛ SHĂNG.

#### THE PRAISE OF KINGS WĂN AND WÛ:--HOW THE FORMER DISPLAYED HIS MILITARY PROWESS ONLY TO SECURE THE TRANQUILLITY OF THE PEOPLE; AND HOW THE LATTER, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RESULTS OF DIVINATION, ENTERED IN HIS NEW CAPITAL OF HÂO, INTO THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE KINGDOM WITH THE SINCERE GOOD WILL OF ALL THE PEOPLE.

King Wăn is famous; Yea, he is very famous. What he sought was the
repose (of the people); What he saw was the completion (of his work). A
sovereign true was king Wăn!

King Wăn received the appointment (from Heaven), And achieved his
martial success. Having overthrown *Kh*ung <span
id="fr_545"></span>[1](#fn_526). He fixed his (capital.md) city in
Făng <span id="fr_546"></span>[2](#fn_527.md). A sovereign true was king
Wăn!

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

He repaired the walls along the (old) moat. His establishing himself in
Făng was according to (the pattern of his forefathers), It was not that
he was in haste to gratify his wishes;--It was to show the filial duty
that had come down to him. A sovereign true was the royal prince!

His royal merit was brightly displayed By those walls of Făng. There
were collected (the sympathies of the people of) the four quarters, Who
regarded the royal prince as their protector. A sovereign true was the
royal prince!

The Făng-water flowed on to the east (of the city), Through the
meritorious labour of Yü. There were collected (the sympathies of the
people of) the four quarters, Who would have the great king as their
ruler. A sovereign true was the great king <span
id="fr_547"></span>[1](#fn_528.md)!'

In the capital of Hâo he built his hall with its circlet of water <span
id="fr_548"></span>[2](#fn_529.md). From the west to the east, From the
south to the north, There was not a thought but did him homage. A
sovereign true was the great king!

He examined and divined, did the king, About settling in the capital of
Hâo. The tortoise-shell decided the site <span
id="fr_549"></span>[3](#fn_530.md), And king Wû completed the city. A
sovereign true was king Wû!

<span id="page_396">p. 396</span>

By the Făng-water grows the white millet <span
id="fr_550"></span>[1](#fn_531.md);--Did not king Wû show wisdom in his
employment of officers? He would leave his plans to his descendants, And
secure comfort and support to his son. A sovereign true was king Wû!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_526"></span>[394:1](sbe03135.htm#fr_545.md) As related in ode
7.

<span id="fn_527"></span>[394:2](sbe03135.htm#fr_546.md) Făng had,
probably, been the capital of *Kh*ung, and Wăn <span id="page_395">p.
395</span> removed to it, simply making the necessary repairs and
alterations. This explains how we find nothing about the divinations
which should have preceded so important a step as the founding of a new
capital.

<span id="fn_528"></span>[395:1](sbe03135.htm#fr_547.md) The writer has
passed on to Wû, who did actually become king.

<span id="fn_529"></span>[395:2](sbe03135.htm#fr_548.md) See on the third
of the Praise Odes of Lû in Part IV.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[395:3](sbe03135.htm#fr_549.md) Hâo was built by
Wû, and hence we have the account of his divining About the site and the
undertaking.

<span id="fn_531"></span>[396:1](sbe03135.htm#fr_550.md) 'The white
millet,' a valuable species, grown near the Făng, suggests to the writer
the idea of all the men of ability whom Wû collected around him.
