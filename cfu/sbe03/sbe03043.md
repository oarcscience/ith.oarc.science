### BOOK XVI. THE PRINCE SHIH.

THE words 'Prince Shih' occur at the commencement of the Book, and are
taken as its title. Shih was the name of the duke of Shâo, the author of
Book xii. To him the address or announcement here preserved was
delivered, and his name is not an inappropriate title for it.

The common view of Chinese critics is that the duke of Shâo had
announced his purpose to withdraw from office on account of his age,
when the duke of *K*âu persuaded him to remain at his post, and that the
reasons which he set before him were recorded in this Book. It may have
been so, but the language is far from clearly indicating it. A few
expressions, indeed, may be taken as intimating a wish that Shih should
continue at court, but some violence has to be put upon them:

I have divided the whole into four chapters, but the two principal ideas
In the address are these:--that the favour of Heaven can be permanently
secured for a dynasty only by the virtue of its sovereigns; and
that that virtue is secured mainly by the counsels and help of virtuous
ministers. The ablest sovereigns of Shang are mentioned, and the
ministers by whose aid it was, in a great measure, that they became what
they were. The cases of Wăn and Wû of their own dynasty, similarly aided
by able men, are adduced in the same way; and the speaker adverts to the
services which they--the two dukes--had already rendered to their
sovereign, and insists that they must go on to the end, and accomplish
still greater things.

1\. The duke of *K*âu spoke to the following effect:--'Prince Shih,
Heaven, unpitying, sent down ruin on Yin. Yin has lost its appointment
(to the throne), which our House of *K*âu has received. I do not dare,
however, to say, as if I knew

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

it, "The foundation will ever truly abide in prosperity. If Heaven aid
sincerity,"------ <span id="fr_227"></span>[1](#fn_220.md)\* Nor do I dare
to say, as if I knew it, "The end will issue in our misfortunes." Oh!
you have said, O prince, "It depends on ourselves." I also do not dare
to rest in the favour of God, not forecasting at a distance the terrors
of Heaven in the present time, when there is no murmuring or
disobedience among the people;\*--(the issue) is with men. Should our
present successor to his fathers prove greatly unable to reverence
(Heaven) above and (the people) below, and so bring to an end the glory
of his predecessors, could we in (the retirement of) our families be
ignorant of it? The favour of Heaven is not easily preserved; Heaven is
difficult to be depended on. Men lose its favouring appointment, because
they cannot pursue and carry out the reverence and brilliant virtue of
their forefathers.\* Now I, Tan, the little child, am not able to make
(the king) correct. I would simply conduct him to the glory of *h*is
fathers, and make him, who is my young charge, partaker of that.' He
also said, 'Heaven is not to be trusted. Our course is only to seek the
prolongation of the virtue of the Tranquillizing king, that Heaven may
not find occasion to remove its favouring decree which king Wăn
received.'\*

2\. The duke said, 'Prince Shih, I have heard that aforetime, when Thang
the successful had received the appointment (to the throne), he had with
him Î Yin, making (his virtue) like that of great Heaven;\* that Thâi
*K*iâ had (the same

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Î Yin), the
Pâo-hăng <span id="fr_228"></span>[1](#fn_221.md); that Thâi-Wû <span
id="fr_229"></span>[2](#fn_222.md) had Î *K*ih <span
id="fr_230"></span>[2](#fn_222.md) and *Kh*ăn Hû <span
id="fr_231"></span>[2](#fn_222), through whom (his virtue.md) was made to
affect God,\* and Wû Hsien <span id="fr_232"></span>[3](#fn_223.md) who
regulated the royal House; that Ȝû-yî <span
id="fr_233"></span>[3](#fn_223.md) had Wû Hsien's son; and that Wû-ting had
Kan Phan <span id="fr_234"></span>[4](#fn_224). (These ministers.md)
carried out (their principles), and displayed (their merit), preserving
and regulating the dynasty of Yin, so that, while its ceremonies lasted,
(those sovereigns), when deceased, were assessors to Heaven <span
id="fr_235"></span>[5](#fn_225.md),\* and its duration extended over many
years. Heaven thus determinately maintained its favouring appointment,
and Shang was replenished with men. The various heads of great surnames
and members of the royal House, holding employments, all held fast their
virtue, and showed an anxious solicitude (for the kingdom). The smaller
ministers, and the guardian princes in the Hâu and Tien domains, hurried
about on their services. Thus did they all exert their virtue and aid
their sovereign, so that whatever affairs he, the One man, had in hand,
throughout the land, an entire faith was reposed in their justice as in
the indications of the shell or the divining stalks.'\*

The duke said, 'Prince Shih, Heaven gives length of days to the just and
the intelligent; (it was thus

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

that those ministers) maintained and regulated the dynasty of Yin.\* He
who came last to the throne granted by Heaven was extinguished by its
terrors. Do you think of the distant future, and we shall have the
decree (in favour of Kâu) made sure, and its good government will be,
brilliantly exhibited in our newly-founded state.'

3\. The duke said, 'Prince Shih, aforetime when God was inflicting
calamity (on Yin), he encouraged anew the virtue of the Tranquillizing
king, till at last the great favouring decree was concentrated in his
person. (But) that king Wăn was able to conciliate and unite the portion
of the great kingdom which we came to possess, was owing to his having
(such ministers) as his brother of Kwo, Hung Yâo, San Î-shăng, Thâi
Tien, and Nan-kung Kwo.'

He said further, 'But for the ability of those men to go and come in his
affairs, developing his constant lessons, there would have been no
benefits descending from king Wăn on the people. And it also was from
the determinate favour of Heaven that there were these men of firm
virtue, and acting according to their knowledge of the dread majesty of
Heaven, to give themselves to enlighten king Wăn, and lead him forward
to his high distinction and universal rule, till his fame, reached the
ears of God, and he received the appointment that had been Yin's.\*
There were still four of those men who led on king Wû to the possession
of the revenues of the kingdom, and afterwards, along with him, in great
reverence of the majesty of Heaven, slew all his enemies.\* These four
men, moreover, made king Wû so illustrious that his glory overspread the
kingdom, and (the people) universally and greatly proclaimed his

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

virtue. Now with me Tan, the little child, it is as if I were floating
on a great stream;--With you, O Shih, let me from this time endeavour to
cross it. Our young sovereign is (powerless), as if he had not yet
ascended the throne. You must by no means lay the whole burden on me;
and if you draw yourself up without an effort to supply my deficiencies,
no good will flow to the people from our age and experience. We shall
not hear the voices of the phœnixes <span
id="fr_236"></span>[1](#fn_226.md), and how much less can it be thought
that we shall be able to make (the king's virtue) equal (to Heaven)!

The duke said, 'Oh! consider well these things, O prince. We have
received the appointment to which belongs an unlimited amount of
blessing, but having great difficulties attached to it. What I announce
to you are counsels of a generous largeness.--I cannot allow the
successor of our kings to go astray.'

4\. The duke said, 'The former king laid bare his heart, and gave full
charge to you, constituting you one of the guides and patterns for the
people, saying, "Do you with intelligence and energy second and help the
king; do you with sincerity support and convey forward the great decree.
Think of the virtue of king Wăn, and enter greatly into his boundless
anxieties." '

The duke said, 'What I tell you, O prince, are my sincere. thoughts. O
Shih, the Grand-Protector, if you can but reverently survey with me the
decay and great disorders of Yin, and thence consider the

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

dread majesty of Heaven (which warns) us!--Am I not to be believed that
I must reiterate my words? I simply say, "The establishment (of our
dynasty) rests with us two." Do you agree with me? Then you (also) will
say, "It rests with us two." And the favour of Heaven has come to us so
largely:--it should be ours to feel as if we could not sufficiently
respond to it. If you can but reverently cultivate your virtue (now),
and bring to light our men of eminent ability, then when you resign
(your position) to some successor in a time of established security, (I
will interpose no objection.)

'Oh! it is by the earnest service of us two that we have come to the
prosperity of the present day. We must both go on, abjuring all
idleness, to complete the work of king Wăn, till it has grandly
overspread the kingdom, and from the corners of the sea, and the
sunrising, there shall not be one who is disobedient to the rule (of
*K*âu).'

The duke said, 'O prince, have I not spoken in accordance with reason in
these many declarations? I am only influenced by anxiety about (the
appointment of) Heaven, and about the people.'

The duke said, 'Oh! you know, O prince, the ways of the people, how at
the beginning they can be (all we could desire); but it is the end (that
is to be thought of). Act in careful accordance with this fact. Go and
reverently exercise the duties of your office.'
