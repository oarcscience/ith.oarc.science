#### ODE 4. THE *KH*ANG FÂ.

#### CELEBRATING HSIEH, THE ANCESTOR OF THE HOUSE OF SHANG; HSIANG-THÛ, HIS GRANDSON; THANG, THE FOUNDER OF THE DYNASTY; AND Î-YIN, THANG'S CHIEF MINISTER AND ADVISER.

It does not appear on occasion of what sacrifice this piece was made.
The most probable view is that of Mâo, that it was the

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'great Tî
sacrifice,' when the principal object of honour would be the ancient
Khû, the father of Hsieh, with Hsieh as his correlate, and all the kings
of the dynasty, with the earlier lords of Shang, and their famous
ministers and advisers, would have their places at the service. I think
this is the oldest of the odes of Shang.

Profoundly wise were (the lords of) Shang, And long had there appeared
the omens (of their dignity).

When the waters of the deluge spread vast abroad, Yû arranged and
divided the regions of the land, And assigned to the exterior great
states their boundaries, With their borders extending all over (the
kingdom). (Even) then the chief of Sung was beginning to be great, And
God raised up the son (of his daughter), and founded (the line of)
Shang <span id="fr_344"></span>[1](#fn_332.md).

The dark king exercised an effective sway <span
id="fr_345"></span>[2](#fn_333.md). Charged with a small state, he
commanded success: Charged with a large state, he commanded
success <span id="fr_346"></span>[3](#fn_334.md). He followed his rules of
conduct without error; Wherever he inspected (the people), they
responded (to his instructions <span id="fr_347"></span>[4](#fn_335.md).
(Then came) Hsiang-thû all ardent <span id="fr_348"></span>[5](#fn_336.md),
And all within the four seas, beyond (the middle regions), acknowledged
his restraints.}

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

The favour of God did not leave (Shang), And in Thang was found the fit
object for its display. Thang was not born too late, And his wisdom and
reverence daily advanced:--Brilliant was the influence of his character
(on Heaven) for long. God he revered, And God appointed him to be the
model for the nine regions.

He received the rank-tokens of the states, small and large, Which
depended on him like the pendants of a banner:--So did he receive the
blessing of Heaven. He was neither violent nor remiss, Neither hard nor
soft. Gently he spread his instructions abroad, And all dignities and
riches were concentrated in him.

He received the tribute of the states, small and large, And he supported
them as a strong steed (does its burden):--So did he receive the favour
of Heaven. He displayed everywhere his valour, Unshaken, unmoved,
Unterrified, unscared:--All dignities were united in him.

The martial king displayed his banner, And with reverence grasped his
axe. It was like (the case of) a blazing fire which no one can repress.
The root, with its three shoots, Could make no progress, no growth <span
id="fr_349"></span>[1](#fn_337.md). The nine regions were effectually
secured by Thang. Having smitten (the princes of) Wei and Kû, He dealt
with (him of) *K*ün-wû and with *K*ieh of Hsiâ.

Formerly, in the middle of the period (before

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Thang), There was
a time of shaking and peril <span id="fr_350"></span>[1](#fn_338.md). But
truly did Heaven (then) deal with him as a son, And sent him down a high
minister, Namely, Â-hăng <span id="fr_351"></span>[2](#fn_339.md), Who gave
his assistance to the king of Shang.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_332"></span>[309:1](sbe03068.htm#fr_344.md) This line refers
to the birth of Hsieh, as described in the previous ode, and his being
made lord of Shang.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[309:2](sbe03068.htm#fr_345.md) It would be hard
to say why Hsieh is here called 'the dark king.' There may be an
allusion to the legend about the connexion of the swallow,--'the dark
bird,'--with his birth, He never was 'a king;' but his descendants here
represented him as such.

<span id="fn_334"></span>[309:3](sbe03068.htm#fr_346.md) All that is meant
here is, that the territory of Shang was enlarged under Hsieh.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[309:4](sbe03068.htm#fr_347.md) There is a
reference here to Hsieh's appointment by Shun to be Minister of
Instruction.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[309:5](sbe03068.htm#fr_348.md) Hsiang-thû appears
in the genealogical lists as grandson of Hsieh. We know nothing of him
but what is related here.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[310:1](sbe03068.htm#fr_349.md) By 'the root' we
are to understand Thang's chief opponent, *K*ieh, the last king of Hsiâ.
*K*ieh's three great helpers were 'the three shoots,'--the princes of
Wei, Kû, and *K*ün-wû; but the exact sites of their principalities
cannot be made out.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[311:1](sbe03068.htm#fr_350.md) We do not know
anything of this time of decadence in the fortunes of Shang between
Hsieh and Thang.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[311:2](sbe03068.htm#fr_351.md) Â-hăng is Î Yin,
who plays so remarkable a part in the Shû, IV, Books iv, v, and vi.
