### BOOK V. THE ODES OF WEI.

IT has been said on the title of Book iii, that Wei at first was the
eastern portion of the old domain of the kings of Shang. With this a
brother of king Wû, called Khang-shû, was invested. The principality was
afterwards increased by the absorption of Phei and Yung. It came to
embrace portions of the present provinces of *K*ih-lî, Shan-tung, and
Ho-nan. It outlasted the dynasty of *K*âu itself, the last prince of Wei
being reduced to the ranks of the people only during the dynasty of
*Kh*in.
