#### ODE 4. THE PÎ KUNG.

#### IN PRAISE OF DUKE HSÎ, AND AUSPICING FOR HIM A MAGNIFICENT CAREER OF SUCCESS, WHICH WOULD MAKE LÛ ALL THAT IT HAD EVER BEEN:--WRITTEN, PROBABLY, ON AN OCCASION WHEN HSÎ HAD REPAIRED THE TEMPLES OF THE STATE, OF WHICH PIOUS ACT HIS SUCCESS WOULD BE THE REWARD.

There is no doubt that duke Hsî is the hero of this piece. He is
mentioned in the third stanza as 'the son of duke *K*wang,' and the
Hsî-sze referred to in the last stanza as the architect under whose
superintendence the temples had been repaired was his brother, whom we
meet with elsewhere as 'duke's son, Yü'. The descriptions of various
sacrifices prove that the lords of Lû, whether permitted to use royal
ceremonies or not, did really do so. The writer was evidently in a
poetic rapture as to what his ruler was, and would do. The piece is a
genuine bardic effusion.

The poet traces the lords of Lû to *K*iang Yüen and her son Hâu-*k*î. He
then comes to the establishment of the *K*âu dynasty, and under it of
the marquisate of Lû; and finally to duke Hsî, dilating on his
sacrificial services, the military power of Lû, and the achievements
which be might be expected to accomplish in subjugating all the
territory lying to the east and a long way South, of Lû.

I. How pure and still are the solemn temples, In their strong solidity
and minute completeness! Highly distinguished was *K*iang Yüan <span
id="fr_393"></span>[1](#fn_380.md), Of virtue undeflected. God regarded her
with favour, And without injury or hurt, Immediately, when her months
were completed, She gave birth to Hâu-*k*î! On him were conferred all
blessings,--(To know) how the (ordinary) millet ripened early, and the
sacrificial millet late; How first to sow pulse

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

and then wheat. Anon he was invested with an inferior state, And taught
the people how to sow and to reap, The (ordinary) millet and the
sacrificial, Rice and the black millet; Ere long over the whole
country:--(Thus) continuing the work of Yü.

2\. Among the descendants of Hâu-*k*î, There was king Thâi <span
id="fr_394"></span>[1](#fn_381), Dwelling on the south of (mount.md) *Kh*î,
Where the clipping of Shang began. In process of time Wăn and Wû
Continued the work of king Thâi, And (the purpose of) Heaven was carried
out in its time, In the plain of Mû <span
id="fr_395"></span>[2](#fn_382.md). 'Have no doubts, no anxieties,'--(it
was said), 'God is with you <span id="fr_396"></span>[3](#fn_383.md).' Wû
disposed of the troops of Shang; He and his men equally, shared in the
achievement. (Then) king (*Kh*ăng) said, 'My uncle <span
id="fr_397"></span>[4](#fn_384.md), I will set up your eldest son, And make
him marquis of Lû. I will greatly enlarge your territory there, To be a
help and support to the House of *K*âu.'

3\. Accordingly he appointed (our first) duke of Lo, And made him
marquis in the east, Giving him the hills and rivers, The lands and
fields, and the attached states <span id="fr_398"></span>[5](#fn_385.md).
The (present) descendant of the duke of *K*âu, The son of duke *K*wang,
With dragon-emblazoned banner, attends the sacrifices, (Grasping) his
six reins soft and pliant. In spring

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

and autumn he is not remiss; His offerings are all without error <span
id="fr_399"></span>[1](#fn_386.md). To the great and sovereign God, And to
his great ancestor Hâu-*k*î, He offers the victims, red and pure <span
id="fr_400"></span>[2](#fn_387.md) They enjoy, they approve, And bestow
blessings in large number. The duke of *K*âu, and (your other) great
ancestors, Also bless you.

4\. In autumn comes the sacrifice of the season <span
id="fr_401"></span>[3](#fn_388.md), But the bulls for it have had their
horns capped in summer <span id="fr_402"></span>[4](#fn_389.md); They are
the white bull and the red one <span id="fr_403"></span>[5](#fn_390.md).
(There are) the bull-figured goblet in, its dignity <span
id="fr_404"></span>[6](#fn_391.md); Roast pig, minced meat, and soups; The
dishes of bamboo and wood, and the large stands <span
id="fr_405"></span>[7](#fn_392.md), And the dancers all complete. The
filial descendant

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

will be blessed. (Your ancestors) will make you gloriously prosperous,
They will make you long-lived and good, To preserve this eastern,
region, Long possessing the state of Lû, Unwaning, unfallen, Unshaken,
undisturbed! They will make your friendship with your three aged
(ministers) <span id="fr_406"></span>[1](#fn_393.md) Like the hills, like
the mountains.

5\. Our prince's chariots are a thousand, And (in each) are (the two
spears with their) vermilion tassels, and (the two bows with their)
green bands. His footmen are thirty thousand, With shells on vermilion
strings adorning their helmets <span id="fr_407"></span>[2](#fn_394.md). So
numerous are his ardent followers, To deal with the tribes of the west
and north, And to punish those of *K*ing and Shû <span
id="fr_408"></span>[3](#fn_395.md), So that none of them will dare to
withstand us. (The spirits of your ancestors) shall make you grandly
prosperous; They

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

shall make you long-lived and wealthy. The hoary hair and wrinkled back,
Marking the aged men, shall always be in your service. They shall grant
you old age, ever vigorous, For myriads and thousands of years, With the
eyebrows of longevity, and ever unharmed.

6\. The mountain of Thâi is lofty, Looked up to by the state of Lû <span
id="fr_409"></span>[1](#fn_396.md). We grandly possess also Kwei and
Măng <span id="fr_410"></span>[2](#fn_397.md). And we shall extend to the
limits of the east, Even the states along the sea. The tribes of the
Hwâi will seek our alliance; All will proffer their allegiance:--Such
shall be the achievements of the marquis of Lû.

7\. He shall maintain the possession of Hû and Yî <span
id="fr_411"></span>[3](#fn_398.md), And extend his sway to the regions of
Hsü <span id="fr_412"></span>[4](#fn_399.md), Even to the states along the
sea. The tribes of the Hwâi, the Man, and the Mo <span
id="fr_413"></span>[5](#fn_400), And those tribes (still more.md) to the
south, All will proffer their allegiance;--Not one will dare not to
answer to his call, Thus showing their obedience to the marquis of Lû.

8\. Heaven will give great blessing to our prince, So that with the
eyebrows of longevity he shall

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

maintain Lû. He shall possess *K*ang and Hsü <span
id="fr_414"></span>[1](#fn_401.md), And recover all the territory of the
duke of *K*âu. Then shall the marquis of Lû feast and be glad, With his
admirable wife and aged mother; With his excellent ministers and all his
(other) officers <span id="fr_415"></span>[2](#fn_402.md). Our region and
state shall he hold, Thus receiving many blessings, To hoary hair, and
with teeth ever renewed like a child's.

9\. The pines of Ȝû-lâi <span id="fr_416"></span>[3](#fn_403.md), And the
cypresses of Hsin-fû <span id="fr_417"></span>[3](#fn_403.md), Were cut
down and measured, With the cubit line and the eight cubits' line. The
projecting beams of pine were made very large; The grand inner
apartments rose vast. Splendid look the new temples, The work of
Hsî-sze, Very wide and large, Answering to the expectations of all the
people.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_380"></span>[341:1](sbe03103.htm#fr_393.md) About *K*iang Yüan
and her conception and birth of Hâu-*k*î, see the first piece in the
third decade of the Major Odes of the Kingdom. There also Hâu-*k*î's
teaching of husbandry is more fully described.

<span id="fn_381"></span>[342:1](sbe03103.htm#fr_394.md) See on the
Sacrificial Odes of *K*âu, decade i, ode 5.

<span id="fn_382"></span>[342:2](sbe03103.htm#fr_395.md) See the Shû, V,
iii.

<span id="fn_383"></span>[342:3](sbe03103.htm#fr_396.md) Shang-fû, one of
Wû's principal leaders, encouraged him at the battle of Mû with these
words.

<span id="fn_384"></span>[342:4](sbe03103.htm#fr_397.md) That is, the duke
of *K*âu.

<span id="fn_385"></span>[342:5](sbe03103.htm#fr_398.md) That is, small
territories, held by chiefs of other surnames, but acknowledging the
jurisdiction of. the lords of Lû, and dependent on them for introduction
to the royal court.

<span id="fn_386"></span>[343:1](sbe03103.htm#fr_399.md) These lines refer
to the seasonal sacrifices in the temple of ancestors, two seasons being
mentioned for all the four, as in some of the odes of Shang.

<span id="fn_387"></span>[343:2](sbe03103.htm#fr_400.md) From the seasonal
sacrifices the poet passes to the sacrifice to God at the border altar
in the spring,--no doubt the same which is referred to in the last ode
of the first decade of the Sacrificial Odes of *K*âu.

<span id="fn_388"></span>[343:3](sbe03103.htm#fr_401.md) The subject of the
seasonal sacrifices is resumed.

<span id="fn_389"></span>[343:4](sbe03103.htm#fr_402.md) A piece of wood
was fixed across the horns of the victim-bulls, to prevent their
injuring them by pushing or rubbing against any hard substance. An
animal injured in any way was not fit to be used in sacrifice.

<span id="fn_390"></span>[343:5](sbe03103.htm#fr_403.md) In sacrificing to
the duke of *K*âu, a white bull was used by way of distinction. His
great services to the. dynasty had obtained for him the privilege of
being sacrificed to with royal ceremonies. A white bull, such as had
been offered to the kings of Shang, was therefore devoted to him; while
for Po-*kh*in, and 'the other marquises (or dukes as spoken of by their
own subjects), a victim of the orthodox *K*âu colour was employed.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[343:6](sbe03103.htm#fr_404.md) This goblet,
fashioned in the shape of a bull, or with a bull pictured on it, must
have been well known in connexion with these services.

<span id="fn_392"></span>[343:7](sbe03103.htm#fr_405.md) 'The large stand'
was of a size to support half the roasted body of a victim.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[344:1](sbe03103.htm#fr_406.md) Referring,
probably, to the three principal ministers of the state.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[344:2](sbe03103.htm#fr_407.md) These lines
describe Hsî's resources for war. A thousand chariots was the regular
force which a great state could at the utmost bring into the field. Each
chariot contained three mailed men;--the charioteer in the middle, a
spearman on the right, and an archer on the left. Two spears rose aloft
with vermilion tassels, and there were two bows, bound with green bands
to frames in their cases. Attached to every chariot were seventy-two
foot-soldiers and twenty-five followers, making with the three men in
it, 100 in all; so that the whole force would amount to 100,000 men. But
in actual service the force of a great state was restricted to three
'armies' or 375 chariots, attended by 37,500 men, of whom 27,500 were
foot-soldiers, put down here in round numbers as 30,000.

<span id="fn_395"></span>[344:3](sbe03103.htm#fr_408.md) *K*ing is the
*K*ing-*kh*û of the last of the Sacrificial Odes of Shang, and the name
Shû was applied to several half-civilized states to the east of it,
which it brought, during the *Kh*un *Kh*iû period, one after another
under its jurisdiction.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[345:1](sbe03103.htm#fr_409.md) Mount Thâi is well
known, the eastern of the four great mountains of China in the time of
Shun. It is in the department of Thâi-an, Shan-tung.

<span id="fn_397"></span>[345:2](sbe03103.htm#fr_410.md) These were two
smaller hills in Lû.

<span id="fn_398"></span>[345:3](sbe03103.htm#fr_411.md) These were two
hills of Lû, in the present district of Ȝâu.

<span id="fn_399"></span>[345:4](sbe03103.htm#fr_412.md) Hsü was the name
of one of Yü's nine provinces, embracing portions of the present
Shan-tung, *K*iang-sû, and An-hui.

<span id="fn_400"></span>[345:5](sbe03103.htm#fr_413.md) Mo was properly
the name of certain wild tribes in the north, as Man was that of the
tribes of the south. But we cannot suppose any tribes to be meant here
but such as lay south of Lû.

<span id="fn_401"></span>[346:1](sbe03103.htm#fr_414.md) *K*ang was a city
with some adjacent territory, in the present district of Thang, that had
been taken from Lû by *Kh*î. Hsü, called in the Spring and Autumn 'the
fields of Hsü' was west from Lû, and had been granted to it as a
convenient place for its princes to stop at on their way to the royal
court; but it had been sold or parted with to *K*ăng in the first year
of duke Hwan (B.C. 711). The poet desires that Hsî should recover these
and all other territory which had at any time belonged to Lû.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[346:2](sbe03103.htm#fr_415.md) He would feast
with the ladies in the inner apartment of the palace, suitable for such
a purpose; with his ministers in the outer banqueting-room.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[346:3](sbe03103.htm#fr_417.md) These were two
hills, in the present department of Thâi-an.
