#### ODE 8, STANZAS 4 AND 5. THE *K*IANG HAN.

#### CELEBRATING AN EXPEDITION AGAINST THE SOUTHERN TRIBES OF THE HWÂI, AND THE WORK DONE FOR THE KING IN THEIR COUNTRY, BY HÛ, THE EARL OF SHÂO, WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH THE KING REWARDED HIM, AND HE RESPONDED TO THE ROYAL FAVOUR.

Hû was probably the same earl of Shâo, who is mentioned in ode 5, as
building his capital of Hsieh for the new marquis of Shan. The lords of
Shâo had been distinguished in the service of *K*âu ever since the rise
of the dynasty.

The king gave charge to Hû of Shâo:--'You have everywhere made known
(and carried out my orders). When (the kings) Wăn and Wû received their
appointment, The duke of Shâo was their strong support. You not (only)
have a regard to me the little child But you try to resemble that duke
of Shâo. You have commenced and earnestly displayed your merit; And I
will make you happy.

'I give you a large libation-cup of jade <span

from the black millet <span id="fr_612"></span>[2](#fn_592). I have made
announcement to the Accomplished one <span
id="fr_613"></span>[3](#fn_593), And confer on you hills, lands, and
fields. In (*Kh*î-)*k*âu shall you receive investiture, According as
your ancestor received his.' Hû bowed with

his head to the ground (and said), 'May the Son of Heaven live for
ever!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_591"></span>[427:1](sbe03151.htm#fr_611) See note 2 on [p.
386](sbe03130.htm#page_386).

<span id="fn_592"></span>[427:2](sbe03151.htm#fr_612) The cup and the
spirits would be used by the earl when sacrificing in his ancestral
temple. Compare the similar gift from king *Kh*ăng to the duke of *K*âu,
in the Shû, [p. 194](sbe03040.htm#page_194). More substantial gifts are
immediately specified.

<span id="fn_593"></span>[427:3](sbe03151.htm#fr_613) 'The Accomplished
one' is understood to be king Wăn (= 'the Accomplished king'). He was
the founder of the *K*âu dynasty. To him the kingdom had first come by
the appointment and gift of Heaven. It was the duty therefore of his
successors, in making grants of territory to meritorious officers, to
announce them to him in *Kh*î-*k*âu, the old territory of the family,
and obtain, as it were, his leave for what they were doing.
