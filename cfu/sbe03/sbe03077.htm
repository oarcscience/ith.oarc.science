</p>  <h5 align="center">ODE 8. THE SHIH M&Acirc;I.</h5>  <h5 align="center">APPROPRIATE TO KING W&Ucirc;'S SACRIFICING TO HEAVEN, AND TO THE SPIRITS OF THE HILLS AND RIVERS, ON A PROGRESS THROUGH THE KINGDOM, AFTER THE OVERTHROW OF THE SHANG DYNASTY.</h5>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Here again there is an agreement among the critics. We find from the &#540;o <I>K</I>wan and 'the Narratives of the States.' that the</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_318"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 318</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">piece was, when those compilations were made, considered to be the work of the duke of <I>K</I>&acirc;u; and, no doubt, it was made by him soon after the accession of W&ucirc; to the kingdom, and when he was making a royal progress in assertion of his being appointed by Heaven to succeed to the rulers of Shang. The 'I' in the fourteenth line is, most probably, to be taken of the duke of <I>K</I>&acirc;u, who may have recited the piece on occasion of the sacrifices, in the hearing of the assembled princes and lords.</FONT></p>  
<p>Now is he making a progress through his states; May Heaven deal with him as its son!</p>  
<p>Truly are the honour and succession come from it to the House of <I>K</I>&acirc;u. To his movements All respond with tremulous awe. He has attempted and given rest to all spiritual beings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_363"></A><A HREF="#fn_351"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, Even to (the spirits of) the Ho and the highest hills. Truly is the king our sovereign lord.</p>  
<p>Brilliant and illustrious is the House of <I>K</I>&acirc;u. He has regulated the positions of the princes; He has called in shields and spears; He has returned to their cases bows and arrows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_364"></A><A HREF="#fn_352"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. He will cultivate admirable virtue, And display it throughout these great regions. Truly will the king preserve the appointment.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_351"></A><A HREF="sbe03077.htm#fr_363">318:1</A> 'All spiritual beings' is, literally, 'the hundred spirits,' meaning the spirits presiding, under Heaven, over all nature, and especially the spirits of the rivers and hills throughout the kingdom. Those of the Ho and the lofty mountains are mentioned, because if their spirits Were satisfied with W&ucirc;, those of all other mountains and hills, no doubt, were so.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_352"></A><A HREF="sbe03077.htm#fr_364">318:2</A> Compare with these lines the last chapter of 'the Completion of the War' in the Sh&ucirc;.</P>
