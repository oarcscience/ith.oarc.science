</p>  <h2 align="center">CHAPTER XII. AMPLIFICATION OF 'THE ALL-EMBRACING RULE OF CONDUCT' IN CHAPTER I.</h2>  
<p>The Master said, 'For teaching the people to be affectionate and loving there is nothing better than Filial Piety; for teaching them (the observance of) propriety and submissiveness there is nothing better than Fraternal Duty; for changing their manners</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_482"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 482</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and altering their customs there is nothing better than Music; for securing the repose of superiors and the good order of the people there is nothing better than the Rules of Propriety.</p>  
<p>'The Rules of Propriety are simply (the development of) the principle of Reverence. Therefore the reverence paid to a father makes (all) sons pleased; the reverence paid to an elder brother makes (all) younger brothers pleased; the reverence paid to a ruler makes (all) subjects pleased&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_687"></A><A HREF="#fn_667"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The reverence paid to one man makes thousands and myriads of men pleased. The reverence is paid to a few, and the pleasure extends to many;--this is what is meant by an "All-embracing Rule of Conduct."'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_667"></A><A HREF="sbe03192.htm#fr_687">482:1</A> We must understand that the 'reverence' here is to be understood as paid by the sovereign. In reverencing his father (or an uncle may also in Chinese usage be so styled), he reverences the idea of fatherhood, and being 'in accord with the minds of all under heaven,' his example is universally powerful. And we may reason similarly of the other two cases of reverence specified.</P>
