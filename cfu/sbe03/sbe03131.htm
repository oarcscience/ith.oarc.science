<P><A NAME="fn_501"></A><A HREF="sbe03131.htm#fr_518">386:4</A> As the foot of the hill was favourable to vegetable growth, so were king W&#259;n's natural qualities to his distinction and advancement.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_502"></A><A HREF="sbe03131.htm#fr_519">387:1</A> As a cup of such quality was the proper receptacle for the yellow, herb-flavoured spirits, so was the character of W&#259;n such that all blessing must accrue to him.</P>
