#### ODE 1, STANZA 1. THE SHÛ-LÎ.

#### AN OFFICER DESCRIBES HIS MELANCHOLY AND REFLECTIONS ON SEEING THE DESOLATION OF THE OLD CAPITAL OF *K*ÂU, MAKING HIS MOAN TO HEAVEN BECAUSE OF IT.

There is no specific mention of the old. capital of *K*âu in the piece,
but the schools of Mâo and *K*û are agreed in this interpretation, which
is much more likely than any of the others that have been proposed.

There was the millet with its drooping heads; There was the sacrificial
millet coming into blade <span id="fr_633"></span>[1](#fn_613.md). Slowly I
moved about, In my heart all-agitated. Those who knew me said I was sad
at heart. Those who did not know me, Said I was seeking for something. O
thou distant and azure Heaven <span id="fr_634"></span>[2](#fn_614.md)! By
what man was this (brought about) <span id="fr_635"></span>[3](#fn_615.md)?

<span id="fn_613"></span>[439:1](sbe03167.htm#fr_633.md) That is, there
where the ancestral temple and other grand buildings of Hâo had once
stood.

<span id="fn_614"></span>[439:2](sbe03167.htm#fr_634.md) 'He cried out to
Heaven,' says Yen *Ȝh*an, 'and told (his distress), but he calls it
distant in its azure brightness, lamenting that his complaint was not
heard.' This is, probably, the correct explanation of the language. The
speaker would by it express his grief that the dynasty of *K*âu and its
people were abandoned and uncared for by Heaven.

<span id="fn_615"></span>[439:3](sbe03167.htm#fr_635.md) Referring to king
Yû, whose reckless course had led to the destruction of Hâo by the
*Z*ung, and in a minor degree to his son, king Phing, who had
subsequently removed to the eastern capital.
