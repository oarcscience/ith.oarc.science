#### ODE, 8, STANZA 1. THE PÂO YÜ.

#### THE MEN OF ȜIN, CALLED OUT TO WARFARE BY THE KING'S ORDER, MOURN OVER THE CONSEQUENT SUFFERING OF THEIR PARENTS, AND LONG FOR THEIR RETURN TO THEIR ORDINARY AGRICULTURAL PURSUITS, MAKING THEIR APPEAL TO HEAVEN.

Sû-sû go the feathers of the wild geese, As

<span id="page_441">p. 441</span>

they settle on the bushy oaks <span id="fr_637"></span>[1](#fn_617.md). The
king's affairs must not be slackly discharged, And (so) we cannot plant
our millets;--What will our parents have to rely on? O thou distant and
azure Heaven <span id="fr_638"></span>[2](#fn_618.md)! When shall we be in
our places again?

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_617"></span>[441:1](sbe03170.htm#fr_637.md) Trees are not the
proper place for geese to rest on; and the attempt to do so is
productive of much noise and trouble to the birds. The lines would seem
to allude to the hardships of the soldiers' lot, called from their homes
to go on a distant expedition.

<span id="fn_618"></span>[441:2](sbe03170.htm#fr_638.md) See note 2 on ode
I of Book vi, where Heaven is appealed to in the same language.
