#### ODE 7. THE HWANG Î.

#### SHOWING THE RISE OF THE HOUSE OF *K*ÂU TO THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE KINGDOM THROUGH THE FAVOUR OF GOD, THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF KINGS THÂI AND *K*Î, AND ESPECIALLY OF KING WĂN.

Great is God, Beholding this lower world in majesty. He surveyed the
four quarters (of the kingdom), Seeking for some one to give
establishment to the people. Those two earlier dynasties <span
id="fr_529"></span>[1](#fn_511.md) Had failed to satisfy him with their
government; So, throughout the various states, He sought and considered
For one on whom he might confer the rule. Hating all the great states,
He turned his kind regards on the west, And there gave a settlement (to
king Thâi).

(King Thâi) raised up and removed The dead trunks and the fallen trees.
He dressed and regulated The bushy clumps and the (tangled) rows. He
opened up and cleared The tamarisk trees and the stave trees. He hewed
and thinned The mountain mulberry trees. God having brought about the
removal thither of this intelligent ruler, The Kwan hordes fled
away <span id="fr_530"></span>[2](#fn_512.md). Heaven had raised up a
helpmeet for him, And the appointment he had received was made sure.

God surveyed the hills, Where the oaks and the buckthorn were thinned,
And paths made through the firs and cypresses. God, who had raised the

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

state, raised up a proper ruler <span id="fr_531"></span>[1](#fn_513.md)
for it,--From the time of Thâi-po and king *K*î (this was done) <span
id="fr_532"></span>[1](#fn_513.md). Now this king *K*î In his heart was
full of brotherly duty. Full of duty to his elder brother, He gave
himself the more to promote the prosperity (of the country), And secured
to him the glory (of his act) <span id="fr_533"></span>[2](#fn_514.md). He
accepted his dignity and did not lose it, And (ere long his family)
possessed the whole kingdom.

This king *K*î Was gifted by God with the power of judgment, So that the
fame of his virtue silently grew. His virtue was highly
intelligent,--Highly intelligent, and of rare discrimination; Able to
lead, able to rule, To rule over this great country; Rendering a cordial
submission, effecting a cordial union <span
id="fr_534"></span>[3](#fn_515). When (the sway.md) came to king Wăn, His

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

virtue left nothing to be dissatisfied with, He received the blessing of
God, And it was extended to his descendants.

God said to king Wăn <span id="fr_535"></span>[1](#fn_516.md), 'Be not like
those who reject this and cling to that; Be not like those who are ruled
by their likings and desires;' So he grandly ascended before others to
the height (of virtue). The people of Mî <span
id="fr_536"></span>[2](#fn_517.md) were disobedient, Daring to oppose our
great country, And invaded Yüan, marching to Kung <span
id="fr_537"></span>[3](#fn_518.md). The king rose, majestic in his wrath;
He marshalled his troops, To stop the invading foes; To consolidate the
prosperity of *K*âu; To meet the expectations of all under heaven.

He remained quietly in the capital, But (his troops) went on from the
borders of Yüan. They ascended our lofty ridges, And (the enemy) arrayed
no forces on our hills, On our hills, small or large, Nor drank at our
springs, Our springs or our pools. He then determined the finest of the
plains, And settled on the south of *Kh*î <span
id="fr_538"></span>[4](#fn_519.md), On the banks of

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

the Wei, The centre of all the states, The resort of the lower people.

God said to king Wăn, 'I am pleased with your intelligent virtue, Not
loudly proclaimed nor pourtrayed, Without extravagance or
changeableness, Without consciousness of effort on your part, In
accordance with the pattern of God.' God said to king Wăn, 'Take
measures against the country of your foes. Along with your brethren, Get
ready your scaling ladders, And your engines of onfall and assault, To
attack the walls of *Kh*ung <span id="fr_539"></span>[1](#fn_520.md).'

The engines of onfall and assault were (at first) gently plied, Against
the walls of *Kh*ung high [and](errata.htm#0.md) great; Captives for the
question were brought in, one after another; The left ears (of the
slain) were taken leisurely <span id="fr_540"></span>[2](#fn_521.md). He
had sacrificed to God and to the Father of War <span
id="fr_541"></span>[3](#fn_522.md), Thus seeking to induce

<span id="page_393">p. 393</span>

submission, And throughout the region none had dared to insult him. The
engines of onfall and assault were (then) vigorously plied, Against the
walls of *Kh*ung very strong. He attacked it, and let loose all his
forces; He extinguished (its sacrifices) <span
id="fr_542"></span>[1](#fn_523.md), and made an end of its existence; And
throughout the kingdom none dared to oppose him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_511"></span>[389:1](sbe03133.htm#fr_529.md) Those of Hsiâ and
Shang.

<span id="fn_512"></span>[389:2](sbe03133.htm#fr_530.md) The same as 'the
hordes of the Khwăn' in ode 3. Mr. T. W. Kingsmill says that 'Kwan' here
should be 'Chun,' and charges the transliteration Kwan with error
(journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for April, 1878). He had not
consulted his dictionary for the proper pronunciation of the Chinese
character.

<span id="fn_513"></span>[390:1](sbe03133.htm#fr_532.md) King Wăn is 'the
proper ruler' intended here, and the next line intimates that this was
determined before there was any likelihood of his becoming the ruler
even of the territory of *K*âu;--another instance of the foreseeing
providence ascribed to God. Thâi-po was the eldest son of king Thai, and
king *K*î was, perhaps, only the third. The succession ought to have
come to Thai-po; but he, seeing the sage virtues of *Kh*ang (afterwards
king Wăn), the son of *K*î, and seeing also that king Thai was anxious
that this boy should ultimately become ruler of *K*âu, voluntarily
withdrew from *K*âu altogether, and left the state to *K*î and his son.
See the remark of Confucius on Thâi-po's conduct, in the Analects, VIII,
i.

<span id="fn_514"></span>[390:2](sbe03133.htm#fr_533.md) *T*he lines from
six to ten speak of king *K*î in his relation to his elder brother. He
accepted Thâi-po's act without any failure of his own duty to him, and
by his own improvement of it, made his brother more glorious through it.
His feeling of brotherly duty was simply the natural instinct of his
heart. Having accepted the act, it only made him the more anxious to
promote the good of the state, and thus he made his brother more
glorious by showing what advantages accrued from his resignation and
withdrawal from *K*âu.

<span id="fn_515"></span>[390:3](sbe03133.htm#fr_534.md) This line refers
to Kî's maintenance of his own loyal duty <span id="page_391">p.
391</span> to the dynasty of Shang, and his making all the states under
his presidency loyal also.

<span id="fn_516"></span>[391:1](sbe03133.htm#fr_535.md) The statement that
'God spake to king Wăn,' repeated in stanza 7, vexes the Chinese
critics, and they find in it simply an intimation that Wăn's conduct was
'in accordance with the will of Heaven.' I am not prepared to object to
that view of the meaning; but it is plain that the writer, in giving
such a form to his meaning, must have conceived of God as a personal
Being, knowing men's hearts, and able to influence them.

<span id="fn_517"></span>[391:2](sbe03133.htm#fr_536.md) Mî or Mî-hsü was a
state in the present King-ning Kâu, of Phing-liang department, Kan-sû.

<span id="fn_518"></span>[391:3](sbe03133.htm#fr_537.md) Yüan was a state
adjacent to Mî,--the present *K*ing *K*âu, and Kung must have been a
place or district in it.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[391:4](sbe03133.htm#fr_538.md) Wăn, it appears,
made now a small change in the site of his capital, but did not move to
Făng, where he finally settled.

<span id="fn_520"></span>[392:1](sbe03133.htm#fr_539.md) *Kh*ung was a
state, in the present district of Hû, department Hsî-an, Shen-hsî. His
conquest of *Kh*ung was an important event in the history of king Wăn.
He moved his capital to it, advancing so much farther towards the east,
nearer to the domain of-Shang. According to Sze-mâ *Kh*ien the marquis
of *Kh*ung had slandered the lord of *K*âu, who was president of the
states of the west, to *K*âu-hsin, the king of Shang, and our hero was
put in prison. His friends succeeded in effecting his deliverance by
means of various gifts to the tyrant, and he was reinstated In the west
with more than his former power. Three years afterwards he attacked the
marquis of *Kh*ung.

<span id="fn_521"></span>[392:2](sbe03133.htm#fr_540.md) So far the siege
was prosecuted slowly and, so to say, tenderly, Wan hoping that the
enemy would be induced to surrender without great sacrifice of life.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[392:3](sbe03133.htm#fr_541.md) The sacrifice to
God had been offered in ,Kâu, at the commencement of the expedition;
that to the Father of War, on the army's arriving at the borders of
,Khung. We can hardly tell who is intended by the Father of War. *K*û
Hsî and others would require the plural 'Fathers,' saying the sacrifice
was to Hwang Tî and *Kh*ih Yû, who are found engaged in hostilities far
back in the <span id="page_393">p. 393</span> mythical period of Chinese
history. But *Kh*ih Yû appears as a rebel, or opposed to the One man in
all the country who was then fit to rule. It is difficult to imagine how
they could be associated, and sacrificed to together.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[393:1](sbe03133.htm#fr_542.md) The extinction of
its sacrifices was the final act in the extinction of a state. Any
members of its ruling House who might survive could no longer sacrifice
to their ancestors as having been men of princely dignity. The family
was reduced to the ranks of the people.
