#### ODE 3. THE PHAN SHUI.

#### IN PRAISE OF SOME MARQUIS OF LÛ, CELEBRATING HIS INTEREST IN THE STATE COLLEGE, WHICH HE HAD, PROBABLY, REPAIRED, TESTIFYING HIS VIRTUES, AND AUSPICING FOR HIM A COMPLETE TRIUMPH OVER THE TRIBES OF THE HWÂI, WHICH WOULD BE CELEBRATED IN THE COLLEGE.

The marquis here celebrated was, probably, Shăn, or 'duke Hsî,'
mentioned above. The immediate occasion of its composition

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

must have been some opening or inauguration service in connexion with
the repair of the college.

1\. Pleasant is the semicircular water <span
id="fr_384"></span>[1](#fn_371.md), And we gather the cress about it. The
marquis of Lû is coming to it, And we see his dragon-figured banner. His
banner waves in the wind, And the bells of his horses tinkle
harmoniously. Small and great, All follow the prince in his progress to
it.

2\. Pleasant is the semicircular water, And we gather the pondweed in
it. The marquis of Lû has come to it, With his horses so stately. His
horses are grand; His fame is brilliant. Blandly he looks and smiles;
Without any impatience he delivers his instructions.

3\. Pleasant is the semicircular water, And we gather the mallows about
it. The marquis of Lû has come to it, And in the college he is drinking.
He is drinking the good spirits. May there be

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

given to him such old age as is seldom enjoyed! May he accord with the
grand ways, So subduing to himself all the people!

4\. Very admirable is the marquis of Lû, Reverently displaying his
virtue, And reverently watching over his deportment, The pattern of the
people.

With great qualities, both civil and martial, Brilliantly he affects his
meritorious ancestors <span id="fr_385"></span>[1](#fn_372.md). In
everything entirely filial, He seeks the blessing that is sure to
follow.

5\. Very intelligent is the marquis of Lû, Making his virtue
illustrious. He has made this college with its semicircle of water, And
the tribes of the Hwâi will submit to him <span
id="fr_386"></span>[2](#fn_373.md). His martial-looking tiger-leaders Will
here present the left ears (of their foes) <span
id="fr_387"></span>[3](#fn_374.md). His examiners, wise as Kâo-yâo <span
id="fr_388"></span>[4](#fn_375.md) Will here present the prisoners.

6\. His numerous officers, Men who have enlarged their virtuous minds,
With martial energy conducting their expedition, Will drive far away
those tribes of the east and south. Vigorous and

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

grand, Without noise or display, Without appeal to the judges <span
id="fr_389"></span>[1](#fn_376), They will here present (the proofs of.md)
their merit.

7\. How they draw their bows adorned with bone! How their arrows whiz
forth! Their war chariots are very large! Their footmen and charioteers
never weary! They have subdued the tribes of Hwâi, And brought them to
an unrebellious submission. Only lay your plans securely, And all the
tribes of the Hwâi will be won <span id="fr_390"></span>[2](#fn_377.md).

8\. They come flying on the wing, those owls, And settle on the trees
about the college; They eat the fruit of our mulberry trees, And salute
us with fine notes <span id="fr_391"></span>[3](#fn_378.md). So awakened
shall be those tribes of the Hwâi. They will come presenting their
precious things, Their large tortoises, and their elephants' teeth, And
great contributions of the southern metals <span
id="fr_392"></span>[4](#fn_379.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_371"></span>[338:1](sbe03102.htm#fr_384.md) It is said in the
tenth ode of the first decade of the Major Odes of the Kingdom, that
king Wû in his capital of Hâo built 'his hall with its circlet of
water.' That was the royal college built in the middle of a circle of
water; each state had its grand college with a semicircular pool in
front of it, such is may now be seen in front of the temples of
Confucius in the metropolitan cities of the provinces. It is not easy to
describe all the purposes which the building served. In this piece the
marquis of Lû appears feasting in it, delivering instructions, taking
counsel with his ministers, and receiving the spoils and prisoners of
war. The Lî *K*î, VIII, ii, 7, refers to sacrifices to Hâu-*k*î in
connexion with the college of Lû. There the officers of the state in
autumn learned ceremonies; in winter, literary studies; in spring and
summer, the use of arms; and in autumn and winter, dancing. There were
celebrated trials of archery; there the aged were feasted; there the
princes held council with their ministers. The college was in the
western suburb of each capital.

<span id="fn_372"></span>[339:1](sbe03102.htm#fr_385.md) The meaning is
that the fine qualities of the marquis 'reached to' and affected his
ancestors in their spirit-state, and would draw down their protecting
favour. Their blessing, seen in his prosperity, was the natural result
of his filial piety.

<span id="fn_373"></span>[339:2](sbe03102.htm#fr_386.md) The Hwâi rises in
the department of Nan-yang, Ho-nan, and flows eastward to the sea. South
of it, down to the time of this ode, were many rude and wild tribes that
gave frequent occupation to the kings of *K*âu.

<span id="fn_374"></span>[339:3](sbe03102.htm#fr_387.md) When prisoners
refused to submit, their left ears were cut off, and shown as trophies.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[339:4](sbe03102.htm#fr_388.md) The ancient Shun's
Minister of Crime. The 'examiners' were officers. who questioned the
prisoners, especially the more important of them, to elicit information,
and decide as to the amount of their guilt and punishment.

<span id="fn_376"></span>[340:1](sbe03102.htm#fr_389.md) The 'judges'
decided all questions of dispute in the army, and on the merits of
different men who had distinguished themselves.

<span id="fn_377"></span>[340:2](sbe03102.htm#fr_390.md) In this stanza the
poet describes a battle with the wild tribes, as if it were going on
before his eyes.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[340:3](sbe03102.htm#fr_391.md) An owl is a bird
with a disagreeable scream, instead of a beautiful note; but the
mulberries grown about the college would make them sing delightfully.
And so would the influence of Lû, going forth from the college,
transform the nature of the tribes about the Hwâi.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[340:4](sbe03102.htm#fr_392.md) That is, according
to 'the Tribute of Yü,' in the Shû, from *K*ing-*k*âu and Yang-*k*âu.
