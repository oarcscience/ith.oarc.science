#### ODE 6. THE HSIN NAN SHAN.

#### HUSBANDRY TRACED TO ITS FIRST AUTHOR; DETAILS ABOUT IT, GOING ON TO THE SUBJECT OF SACRIFICES TO ANCESTORS.

The Preface refers this piece to the reign of king Yû; but there is
nothing. in it to suggest the idea of its having been made in a time of
disorder and misgovernment. 'The distant descendant' in the first stanza
is evidently the principal in the sacrifice of the last two
stanzas:--according to *K*û, a noble or great landholder in the royal
domain; according to others, some one of the kings of *K*âu. I incline
myself to this latter view. The three pieces,

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

of which this is the middle one, seem all to be royal odes. The mention
of 'the southern hill' strongly confirms this view.

Yes, (all about) that southern hill Was made manageable by Yü <span
id="fr_465"></span>[1](#fn_449.md). Its plains and marshes being opened up,
It was made into fields by the distant descendant. We define their
boundaries, We form their smaller divisions, And make the acres lie,
here to the south, there to the east.

The heavens overhead are one arch of clouds, Snowing in multitudinous
flakes; There is super-added the drizzling rain. When (the land) has
received the moistening, Soaking influence abundantly, It produces all
our kinds of grain.

The boundaries and smaller divisions are nicely adjusted, And the
millets yield abundant crops, The harvest of the distant descendant. We
proceed to make therewith spirits and food, To supply our
representatives of the departed, and our guests;--To obtain long life,
extending over myriads of years.

In the midst of the fields are the huts <span
id="fr_466"></span>[2](#fn_450.md), And

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

along the bounding divisions are gourds. The fruit is sliced and
pickled, To be presented to our great ancestors, That their distant
descendant may have long life, And receive the blessing of Heaven <span
id="fr_467"></span>[1](#fn_451.md).

We sacrifice (first) with clear spirits, And then follow with a red
bull; Offering them to our ancestors, (Our lord) holds the knife with
tinkling bells, To lay open the hair of the victim, And takes the blood
and fat <span id="fr_468"></span>[2](#fn_452.md).

Then we present, then we offer; All round the fragrance is diffused.
Complete and brilliant is the sacrificial service; Grandly come our
ancestors. They will reward (their descendant) with great blessing, Long
life, years without end.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_449"></span>[369:1](sbe03121.htm#fr_465.md) There is here a
recognition of the work of the great Yü, as the real founder of the
kingdom of China, extending the territory of former elective chiefs, and
opening up the country. 'The southern hill' bounded the prospect to the
south from the capital of *K*âu, and hence the writer makes mention of
it. He does not mean to confine the work of Yü to that part of the
country; but, on the other hand, there is nothing in his language to
afford a confirmation to the account given in the third Part of the Shû
of that hero's achievements.

<span id="fn_450"></span>[369:2](sbe03121.htm#fr_466.md) In every *K*ing,
or space of 900 Chinese acres or mâu, assigned to eight families, there
were in the Centre 100 mâu of 'public fields,' belonging to the
government, and cultivated by the husbandmen in common. In this space of
100 mâu, two mâu and a half were again assigned to each family, and on
them were <span id="page_370">p. 370</span> erected the huts in which
they lived, while they were actively engaged in their agricultural
labours.

<span id="fn_451"></span>[370:1](sbe03121.htm#fr_467.md) Here, as in so
many other places, the sovereign Power, ruling in the lots of men, is
referred to as Heaven.

<span id="fn_452"></span>[370:2](sbe03121.htm#fr_468.md) The fat was taken
from the victim, and then burnt along with fragrant herbs, so as to form
a cloud of incense. On the taking of the 'blood,' it is only said, that
it was done to enable the sacrificer to announce that a proper victim
had been slain.
