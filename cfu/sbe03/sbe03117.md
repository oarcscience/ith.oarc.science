#### ODE 6, STANZAS 5 AND 6. THE HSIANG PO.

#### A EUNUCH, HIMSELF THE VICTIM OF SLANDER, COMPLAINS OF HIS FATE, AND WARNS AND DENOUNCES HIS ENEMIES; APPEALING AGAINST THEM, AS HIS LAST RESORT, TO HEAVEN.

The proud are delighted, And the troubled are in sorrow. O azure Heaven!
O azure Heaven! Look on those proud men, Pity those who are troubled.

Those slanderers! Who devised their schemes for them? I would take those
slanderers, And throw them to wolves and tigers. If these refused to
devour them, I would cast them into the north <span

would throw them into the hands of great (Heaven) <span
id="fr_441"></span>[2](#fn_427.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_426"></span>[361:1](sbe03117.htm#fr_440.md) 'The north,' i.e.
the region where there are the rigours of winter and the barrenness of
the desert.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[361:2](sbe03117.htm#fr_441.md) 'Great Heaven;'
'Heaven' has to be supplied here, but there <span id="page_362">p.
362</span> is no doubt as to the propriety of doing so; and, moreover,
the peculiar phraseology of the line shows that the poet did not rest in
the thought of the material heavens.
