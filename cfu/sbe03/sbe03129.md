#### ODE 3. THE MIEN.

#### SMALL BEGINNINGS AND SUBSEQUENT GROWTH OF THE HOUSE OF *K*ÂU IN *K*ÂU. ITS REMOVAL FROM PIN UNDER THAN-FÛ, WITH ITS FIRST SETTLEMENT IN *K*ÂU, WITH THE PLACE THEN GIVEN TO THE BUILDING OF THE ANCESTRAL TEMPLE, AND THE ALTAR TO THE SPIRITS OF THE LAND. CONSOLIDATION OF ITS FORTUNES BY KING WĂN.

'The ancient duke Than-fû' was the grandfather of king Wăn, and was
canonized by the duke of *K*âu as 'king Thâi.' As mentioned in a note on
[p. 316](sbe03073.htm#page_316.md), he was the first of his family to
settle in Kâu, removing there from Pin. the site of their earlier
settlement, 'the country about the *Kh*ü and the *Kh*î.'

In long trains ever increasing grow the gourds <span
id="fr_503"></span>[2](#fn_486). When (our.md) people first sprang, From
the country about the *Kh*ü and the *Kh*î <span
id="fr_504"></span>[3](#fn_487.md), The ancient duke

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Than-fû Made for
them kiln-like huts and caves, Ere they had yet any houses <span
id="fr_505"></span>[1](#fn_488.md).

The ancient duke Than-fû Came in the morning, galloping his horses,
Along the banks of the western rivers, To the foot of mount *Kh*î <span
id="fr_506"></span>[2](#fn_489.md); And there he and the lady *K*iang <span
id="fr_507"></span>[3](#fn_490.md) Came and together looked out for a site.

The plain of *K*âu looked beautiful and rich, With its violets, and
sowthistles (sweet) as dumplings. There he began by consulting (with his
followers); There he singed the tortoise-shell, (and divined). The
responses were there to stay and then; And they proceeded there to
build <span id="fr_508"></span>[4](#fn_491.md).

He encouraged the people, and settled them; Here on the left, there on
the right. He divided the ground, and subdivided it; If he dug the
ditches; he defined the acres. From the east to the west, There was
nothing which he did not take in hand <span
id="fr_509"></span>[5](#fn_492.md).

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

He called his Superintendent of Works; He called his Minister of
Instruction; And charged them with the rearing of the houses. With the
line they made everything straight; They bound the frame-boards tight,
so that they should rise regularly uprose the ancestral temple in its
solemn grandeur <span id="fr_510"></span>[1](#fn_493.md).

Crowds brought the earth in baskets; They threw it with shouts into the
frames; They beat it with responsive blows. They pared the walls
repeatedly, till they sounded strong. Five thousand cubits of them arose
together, So that the roll of the great drums did not overpower (the
noise of the builders) <span id="fr_511"></span>[2](#fn_494.md).

They reared the outer gate (of the palace), Which rose in lofty state.
They set up the gate of audience, Which rose severe and exact. They
reared the great altar to the spirits of the land, From which all great
movements should proceed <span id="fr_512"></span>[3](#fn_495.md).

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

Thus though he could not prevent the rage of his foes <span
id="fr_513"></span>[1](#fn_496.md), He did not let fall his own fame. The
oaks and the buckthorns were (gradually) thinned, And roads for
travellers were opened. The hordes of the Khwăn disappeared, Startled
and panting.

(The chiefs of) Yü and *Z*ui <span id="fr_514"></span>[2](#fn_497.md) were
brought to an agreement By king Wăn's stimulating their natural virtue.
Then, I may say, some came to him, previously not knowing him; Some,
drawn the last by the first; Some, drawn by his rapid successes; And
some by his defence (of the weak) from insult.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_486"></span>[382:2](sbe03129.htm#fr_503.md) As a gourd grows
and extends, with a vast development of its tendrils and leaves, so had
the House of *K*âu increased.

<span id="fn_487"></span>[382:3](sbe03129.htm#fr_504.md) These were two
rivers in the territory of Pin, which name still <span id="page_383">p.
383</span> remains in the small department of Pin *K*âu, in Shen-hsî.
The *Kh*ü flows into the Lo, and the *Kh*î into the Wei.

<span id="fn_488"></span>[383:1](sbe03129.htm#fr_505.md) According to this
ode then, up to the time of Than-fû, the Kâu people had only had the
dwellings here described; but this is not easily reconciled with other
accounts, or even with other stanzas of this piece.

<span id="fn_489"></span>[383:2](sbe03129.htm#fr_506.md) See a graphic
account of the circumstances in which this migration took place, in the
fifteenth chapter of the second Part of the first Book of Mencius, very
much to the honour of the ancient duke.

<span id="fn_490"></span>[383:3](sbe03129.htm#fr_507.md) This lady is known
as Thâi-*k*iang, the worthy predecessor of Thâi-*z*ăn.

<span id="fn_491"></span>[383:4](sbe03129.htm#fr_508.md) This stanza has
reference to the choice--by council and divination--of a site for what
should be the chief town of the new settlement.

<span id="fn_492"></span>[383:5](sbe03129.htm#fr_509.md) This stanza
describes the general arrangements for the occupancy and cultivation of
the plain of *K*âu, and the distribution of the people over it.

<span id="fn_493"></span>[384:1](sbe03129.htm#fr_510.md) This stanza
describes the preparations and processes for erecting the buildings of
the new city. The whole took place under the direction of two officers,
in whom we have the germ probably of the Six Heads of the Boards or
Departments, whose functions are described in the Shû and the Official
Book of *K*âu. The materials of the buildings were earth and lime
pounded together in frames, as is still to be seen in many parts of the
country. The first great building taken in hand was the ancestral
temple. Than-fû would make a home for the spirits of his fathers, before
he made one for himself. However imperfectly directed, the religious
feeling asserted the supremacy which it ought to possess.

<span id="fn_494"></span>[384:2](sbe03129.htm#fr_511.md) The bustle and
order of the building all over the city is here graphically set forth.

<span id="fn_495"></span>[384:3](sbe03129.htm#fr_512.md) Than-fû was now at
leisure to build the palace for himself, which appears to have been not
a very large building, though the Chinese names of its gates are those
belonging to the two which <span id="page_385">p. 385</span> were
peculiar to the palaces of the kings of *K*âu in the subsequent times of
the dynasty. Outside the palace were the altars appropriate to the
spirits of the four quarters of the land, the 'great' or royal altar
being peculiar to the kings, though the one built by Than-fû is here so
named. All great undertakings, and such as required the co-operation of
all the people, were preceded by a solemn sacrifice at this altar.

<span id="fn_496"></span>[385:1](sbe03129.htm#fr_513.md) Referring to
Than-fû's relations with the wild hordes, described by Mencius, and
which obliged him to leave Pin. As the new settlement in *K*âu grew,
they did not dare to trouble it.

<span id="fn_497"></span>[385:2](sbe03129.htm#fr_514.md) The poet passes on
here to the time of king Wăn. The story of the chiefs of Yü and *Z*ui
(two states on the east of the Ho) is this:--They had a quarrel about a
strip of territory, to which each of them laid claim. Going to lay their
dispute before the lord of *K*âu, as soon as they entered his territory,
they saw the ploughers readily yielding the furrow, and travellers
yielding the path, while men and women avoided one another on the road,
and old people had no burdens to carry. At his court, they beheld the
officers of each inferior grade giving place to those above them. They
became ashamed of their own quarrel, agreed to let the disputed ground
be an open territory, and withdrew without presuming to appear before
Wăn. When this affair was noised abroad, more than forty states, it is
said, tendered their submission to *K*âu.
