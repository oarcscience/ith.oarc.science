### BOOK II. THE ODES OF SHÂO AND THE SOUTH.

THE Shû and previous portions of the Shih have made us familiar with
Shâo, the name of the appanage of Shih, one of the principal ministers
at the court of *K*âu in the first two reigns of the dynasty. The site
of the city of Shâo was in the present department of Făng-*kh*iang,
Shen-hsî. The first possessor of it, along with the still more famous
duke of *K*âu, remained at court, to watch over the fortunes of the new
dynasty. They were known as 'the highest dukes' and 'the two great
chiefs,' the duke of *K*âu having charge of the eastern portions of the
kingdom, and the other of the western. The pieces in this Book are
supposed to have been produced in Shâo, and the principalities south of
it within his jurisdiction, by the duke.
