## CHAPTER XIV. AMPLIFICATION OF 'MAKING OUR NAME FAMOUS' IN CHAPTER I.

The Master said, 'The filial piety with which the superior man serves
his parents may be transferred as loyalty to the ruler; the fraternal
duty with which he serves his elder brother may be transferred as
submissive deference to elders; his regulation of his family may be
transferred as good government in any official position. Therefore, when
his conduct is thus successful in his inner (private) circle, his name
will be established (and transmitted) to future generations.'
