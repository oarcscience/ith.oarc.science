##### ODE 7. THE WÛ KIANG.

##### APPROPRIATE TO A SACRIFICE TO KING WĂN, ASSOCIATED WITH HEAVEN, IN THE HALL OF AUDIENCE.

There is, happily, an agreement among the critics as to the occasion to
which this piece is referred. It took place in the last month of autumn,
in the Hall of Audience, called also 'the Brilliant Hall,' and 'the Hall
of Light.' We must suppose that the princes are all assembled at court,
and that the king receives them in this hall. A sacrifice is then
presented to God, with him is associated king Wăn, and the two being the
fountain from which, and the channel through which, the sovereignty had
come to Kâu.

I have brought my offerings, A ram and a bull. May Heaven accept
them <span id="fr_362"></span>[1](#fn_350)!

I imitate and follow and observe the statutes of king Wăn, Seeking daily
to secure the tranquillity of the kingdom. King Wăn, the Blesser, has
descended on the right, and accepted (the offerings).

Do I not, night and day, Revere the majesty of Heaven, Thus to preserve
(its favour).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_350"></span>[317:1](sbe03076.htm#fr_362) This is a prayer.
The worshipper, it is in view of the majesty of Heaven, shrank from
assuming that God would certainly accept his sacrifice. He assumes,
below, that king Wăn does so.
