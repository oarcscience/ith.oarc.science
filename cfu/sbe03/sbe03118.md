#### ODE 9. THE TÂ TUNG.

#### AN OFFICER OF ONE OF THE STATES OF THE EAST DEPLORES THE EXACTIONS MADE FROM THEM BY THE GOVERNMENT, COMPLAINS OF THE FAVOUR SHOWN TO THE WEST, CONTRASTS THE MISERY OF THE PRESENT WITH THE HAPPINESS OF THE PAST, AND APPEALS TO THE STARS OF HEAVEN IDLY BEHOLDING THEIR CONDITION.

I give the whole of this piece, because it is an interesting instance of
Sabian views. The writer, despairing of help from men, appeals to
Heaven; but he distributes the Power that could help him among many
heavenly bodies, supposing that there are spiritual beings in them,
taking account of human affairs.

Well loaded with millet were the dishes, And long and curved were the
spoons of thorn-wood. The way to *K*âu was like a whetstone, And
straight as an arrow. (So) the officers trod it, And the common people
looked on it. When I look back and think of it, My tears run down in
streams.

In the states of the east, large and small, The looms are empty. Then
shoes of dolichos fibre Are made to serve to walk on the hoar-frost.
Slight and elegant gentlemen <span id="fr_442"></span>[1](#fn_428.md) Walk
along that road to *K*âu. Their going and coming makes my heart sad.

Ye cold waters, issuing variously from the spring, Do not soak the
firewood I have cut. Sorrowful, I awake and sigh;--Alas for us toiled
people! The firewood has been cut;--Would that it were

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

conveyed home! Alas for us the toiled people! Would that we could have
rest <span id="fr_443"></span>[1](#fn_429.md)!

The sons of the east Are summoned only (to service), without
encouragement; While the sons of the west Shine in splendid dresses. The
sons of boatmen Have furs of the bear and grisly bear. The sons of the,
poorest families Form the officers in public employment.

If we present them with spirits, They regard them as not fit to be
called liquor. If we give them long girdle pendants with their stones,
They do not think them long enough.

There is the Milky Way in heaven <span id="fr_444"></span>[2](#fn_430.md),
Which looks down on us in light; And the three stars together are the
Weaving Sisters <span id="fr_445"></span>[3](#fn_431.md), Passing in a day
through seven stages (of the sky).

Although they go through their seven stages, They complete no bright
work for us. Brilliant Shine the Draught Oxen <span
id="fr_446"></span>[4](#fn_432.md), But they do not serve to draw our
carts. In the east there is Lucifer <span
id="fr_447"></span>[5](#fn_433.md); In the west there is Hesperus <span
id="fr_448"></span>[5](#fn_433.md); Long and curved

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

is the Rabbit Net of the sky <span id="fr_449"></span>[1](#fn_434.md);--But
they only occupy their places.

In the south is the Sieve <span id="fr_450"></span>[2](#fn_435.md), But it
is of no use to sift. In the north is the Ladle <span
id="fr_451"></span>[3](#fn_436.md), But it lades out no liquor. In the
south is the Sieve, Idly showing its mouth. In the north is the Ladle,
Raising its handle in the west.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_428"></span>[362:1](sbe03118.htm#fr_442.md) That is,
'slight-looking,' unfit for toil; and yet they are obliged to make their
journey on foot.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[363:1](sbe03118.htm#fr_443.md) This stanza
describes, directly or by symbol, the exactions from which the people of
the east were suffering.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[363:2](sbe03118.htm#fr_444.md) The Milky Way' is
here called simply the Han, = in the sky what the Han river is in China.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[363:3](sbe03118.htm#fr_445.md) 'The Weaving
Sisters, or Ladies,' are three stars in Lyra, that form a triangle. To
explain what is said of their passing through seven spaces, it is said:
'The stars seem to go round the circumference of the heavens, divided
into twelve spaces, in a day and night. They would accomplish six of
them in a day; but as their motion is rather in advance of that of the
sun, they have entered into the seventh space by the time it is up with
them again.'

<span id="fn_432"></span>[363:4](sbe03118.htm#fr_446.md) 'The Draught Oxen'
is the name of some stars in the neck of Aquila.

<span id="fn_433"></span>[363:5](sbe03118.htm#fr_448.md) Liû Î (Sung
dynasty) says: 'The metal star (Venus) is in the <span id="page_364">p.
364</span> east in the morning, thus "opening the brightness of the
day;" and it is in the west in the evening, thus "prolonging the day."'
The author of the piece, however, evidently took Lucifer and Hesperus to
be two stars.

<span id="fn_434"></span>[364:1](sbe03118.htm#fr_449.md) 'The Rabbit Net'
is the Hyades.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[364:2](sbe03118.htm#fr_450.md) 'The Sieve' is the
name of one of the twenty-eight constellations of the zodiac,--part of
Sagittarius.

<span id="fn_436"></span>[364:3](sbe03118.htm#fr_451.md) 'The Ladle' is the
constellation next to 'the Sieve,'--also part of Sagittarius.
