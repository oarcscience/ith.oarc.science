### CHAPTER III.

### ON THE CHRONOLOGY OF CHINA, AND THE PRINCIPAL ERAS IN THE SHÛ.

1\. I do not enter here on the subject of the chronology of China
further than is necessary to show that there is no chronological
difficulty in the way of our accepting the documents of the Shû, which I
have just specified, as being possessed of the antiquity ascribed to
them.

<span class="margnote">No detailed chronological system can be made out
from the Shû.</span>

The Shû itself does not supply the means of laying down any scheme of
chronology for the long period of time which it covers. We learn from it
that the dynasty of *K*âu succeeded to that of Shang (another name for
which was Yin), and the dynasty of Shang to that of Hsiâ, and that prior
to Yü, the founder of the Hsiâ, there were the reigns of Shun and Yâo.
As P. Gaubil has observed, 'If we had only the Shû King, we should have
but confused ideas of the time comprised in the different parts of the
book.' There is nothing in this to awaken our surprise. The chronology
of a nation comes to be cultivated as a science only when a necessity is
felt to arrange the events of its history in regular series on the
course of time.

<span class="margnote">Attempts at systematic chronology began in the
Han period.</span>

2\. It was under the Han dynasty that it was first attempted to
construct a chronological scheme of the history of the nation. For this
purpose its scholars employed the well-known cycle of sixty years, in
the fifteenth year of the seventy-sixth revolution of which I am now
writing. It was assumed that this cycle was first devised by Tâ-nâo, an
officer of Hwang Tî, in B.C. 637, which is the first year of the first
cycle. But all scholars in China, whether they call in question this
origin of the cycle or not, now agree in saying that the use of the
cyclic characters to chronicle years was not the ancient method, and did
not begin earlier than the time of the usurper Mang (A.D. 9-22).

In the Shû itself the current cycle is used to chronicle

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

days, and days only. Years are specified according to their order in the
reign of the sovereign to whom they are referred. Such specification of
years in it, however, is rare.

<span class="margnote">Ancient method of determining the length of
Chinese history.</span>

Before the Han dynasty a list of sovereigns, and of the length of their
several reigns, was the only method which the Chinese had of determining
the duration of their national history. And it would still be a
satisfactory method, if we had a list of sovereigns, and of the years
that each reigned, that was complete and reliable. But we do not have
this. Even in the early part of the Han dynasty, Sze-mâ *Kh*ien's father
and himself, in their Historical Records, completed about B.C. 100, were
obliged to content themselves with giving simply the names and order of
most of the rulers of Shang and Hsiâ. It is right to state also that in
A.D. 279, when the grave of king Hsiang of Wei (died in B.C. 295) was
opened, there were found a number of bamboo tablets in it, written in
the ancient. seal characters, among which the most valuable portion was
a book of annals, beginning with the reign of Hwang Tî, and coming down
to the sixteenth year of the last king of *K*âu, B.C. 299. This work is
still current under the name of the Annals of the Bamboo Books. The
chronology derived from it is shorter than the received system by rather
more than 200 years.

If in any of the classical books of the *K*âu dynasty we had a statement
of the length of the national history from any given era to the time of
the writer, the notice would be exceedingly valuable; or, if the length
of the reigns of the sovereigns of Shang and Hsiâ, cursorily mentioned
in it, were correctly given, we should be in a position to make an
approximate computation for ourselves. But there are only two passages
in all those books which are helpful to us in this point. The former of
them is in a narrative in Ȝo *Kh*iû-ming's supplement to the Spring and
Autumn, under the third year of duke Hsüan, where it is said that the
dynasty of Shang possessed the throne for 600 years. The other passage
is the last chapter of the works of Mencius, where that philosopher says
that 'from Yâo and Shun to Thang'--a period including all the dynasty of
Hsiâ--

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'there were 500
years and more; from Thang to king Wăn'--the period of the Shang
dynasty--'500 years and more; and from king Wăn to Confucius, 500 years
and more.' We know that Confucius was born in B.C. 551. Adding 551 to
the 1500 years 'and more,' given by Mencius, we have the era of Yâo and
Shun at 2100 years 'and more' before our Christian era. And the received
chronology places Yü's accession to the throne, as the successor of
Shun, in B.C. 2205. Vague as the language of Mencius is, I do not think
that with the most painstaking research, apart from conclusions based on
astronomical considerations, we can determine anything more precise and
definite concerning the length of Chinese history than it conveys.

<span class="margnote">The period of the *K*âu dynasty.</span>

3\. The Charge to the Marquis Wăn, which now forms the 28th Book of the
5th Part of the Shû, is understood to have been delivered by king Phing,
the thirteenth of his line. His place in historical time is well
ascertained. Confucius' chronicle of the Spring and Autumn commences in
B.C. 722. The first of the thirty-six solar eclipses mentioned in it
took place three years after, on the 14th February (N. S.) 719, and it
is recorded that in the month after king Phing died. Here therefore is a
point of time about which there can be no dispute. An earlier date in
the *K*âu dynasty is known with the same certainty. The Book of Poetry
mentions an eclipse of the sun which took place on the 29th August, B.C.
776, in the sixth year of king Yû, who preceded Phing. Yû reigned eleven
years, and his predecessor, Hsüan, forty-six, whose reign consequently
commenced B.C. 827. Up to this date Chinese chronologers agree. To the
ten reigns before king Hsüan, the received chronology assigns 295 years,
making the dynasty begin in B.C. 1122, which cannot be far from the
truth.

<span class="margnote">The period of the Shang dynasty.</span>

4\. In the period of the Shang dynasty we cannot fix a single reign by
means of astronomical facts. The received chronology assigns to it
twenty-eight reigns, extending over 644 years, so that its commencement
was in B.C. 1766. The scheme

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

derived from the bamboo books makes the sovereigns to be thirty, but the
aggregate of their reigns is only 508. Mencius says that between Thang,
the founder of the dynasty, and Wû-ting, the twentieth sovereign (in the
common scheme), 'there had been six or seven worthy and sage
rulers <span id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md),' leading to the conclusion
that the number of twenty-eight sovereigns in all is not beyond the
truth. In the fifteenth of the Books of *K*âu the names of three of the
Shang rulers are given, and the duration of their reigns,--to show how
Heaven is likely to crown a good king with length of sway. They are Thâi
Mâu, who reigned seventy-five years; Wû-ting, who reigned fifty-nine;
and Ȝû-*k*iâ, who reigned thirty-three. The two schemes agree in the
length of those reigns and of five others. From the statement in the
Ȝo-*k*wan, to which I have referred above, that the Shang dynasty
possessed the throne for 600 years, and Mencius' language that it lasted
'for 500 years and more,' we may believe that the 644 years of the
common scheme are more likely to be correct than the 508 of the shorter.

<span class="margnote">The period of Hsiâ.</span>

5\. The dynasty of Hsiâ lasted, according to the received chronology,
439 years, and according to the bamboo books, 431; so that the
difference here between the two schemes is small. The former estimate
carries us up to B.C. 2205, as the first year of Yü's reign.

I referred. on page 13 to an eclipse of the sun, mentioned in the fourth
of the Books of Hsiâ, as having occurred in the reign of *K*ung Khang, a
grandson of Yü, and stated that P. Gaubil had found by calculation that
on the day and month stated in the document, and in the quarter of the
heavens given, an eclipse did occur in the fifth year of *K*ung Khang,
that is, in B.C. 2156, and was visible at his capital at 6<sup>h</sup>
49´, A*M*. In 1840, J. B. Biot submitted a copy of Gaubil's calculations
to the younger Largeteau, a member, like himself, of the Institute of
France, who went over them with the lunar tables of Damoiseau and the
solar tables of Delambre, and brought out the result that

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

there was indeed an eclipse on the day stated, but before the rising of
the sun at the then. capital of China <span
id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md). My friend, the Rev. Dr. Chalmers of
Canton, not knowing anything of the examination made by Largeteau,
undertook to verify the eclipse in 1861, and found that while the year,
the month, and the day, as given by Gaubil, were correct, the eclipse
had taken place during the night, and could not have been seen by the
Chinese astronomers. The eclipse mentioned in the document of the Shû
cannot therefore be used at present to confirm the received chronology
of China; but I am unwilling to give it up entirely. M. Biot says that,
'Notwithstanding the failure of the attempt of Largeteau to verify the
eclipse, the hope of yet finding it in some one of the years of the
twenty-second century before our era is not entirely lost. We ought to
wait till the further perfecting of the lunar tables brings us new
lights, by means of which we can form a surer judgment'

<span class="margnote">The period of Yâo and Shun.</span>

6\. We come to the earliest Period of Chinese history of which the Shû
makes more than. a cursory mention,--that of Yâo and Shun. It says that
Shun was thirty years on the throne with Yâo, and that, fifty years
after, he died and went on high. We learn from it also that it was in
the seventieth year of his reign that Yâo sought for another to relieve
him of the toils of government. The period covered by the two therefore
is, 150 years, which both the schemes of chronology accept. Adding two
years of mourning between Shun's death and Yü's accession to the throne,
we have B.C. 2357 as the first year of Yâo.

In the Canon of Yâo, when that personage is giving directions to his
astronomers how to determine the equinoxes and solstices, he tells them
that at the vernal equinox they would find the star in Niâo, and at the
autumnal in Hsü; at the summer solstice, the star in Hwo, and at the
winter in Mâo. It has always been assumed by Chinese scholars that when
Yâo said, 'The star of mid-spring is in

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Niâo,' he meant
the star culminating at dusk at that season, at the point of
observation. And so of the other stars and seasons. A Chinese astronomer
at the present day would similarly express himself.

Further, the most common, and what was the earliest division of the
ecliptic in China, is that of the twenty-eight lunar mansions, forming
what we may call the Chinese zodiac. These mansions are grouped together
in four classes of seven each, assigned to the four quarters of the
heavens <span id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md). Of the celestial spaces
which Yâo specified, Niâo is the general name for the seven mansions or
constellations belonging to the southern quarter; Hwo is an old name of
what is now called Fang, the central constellation of the eastern
quarter; Hsü and Mâo are the central constellations of the northern and
southern quarters respectively. What Yâo meant therefore was, that his
astronomers could determine the solstices and the autumnal equinox by
the culmination of the stars in the mansions which he specified for
those seasons. And we may assume that he directed them, for the star of
the vernal equinox, to Hsing, the central mansion in the southern space
Niâo. Now, Hsing corresponds to α (Alphard) Hydræ, and small stars near
it, in our stellar nomenclature; Hwo, to β, δ in Scorpio; Hsü, to β
Aquarii; and Mâo, to Pleiades. When we wish to make the directions of
Yâo available for the purpose of chronological enquiry, the question
that arises is this:--When did the above-named stars culminate at dusk
in China at the equinoctial and solstitial seasons?

Bunsen tells us that Ideler, computing the places of the constellations
backwards, fixed the accession of Yâo at B.C., 2163, and that Freret was
of opinion that the observations left an uncertainty of 3º, leaving a
margin of 210

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

years <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md). On the other hand, J. B. Biot
found in the directions a sufficient confirmation of the received date
for Yâo's accession,--B.C. 2357 <span id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md).
Appended to this Introduction is a chart of the stars as they were
visible in China in B.C. 2300, which the Rev. C. Pritchard, Savilian
Professor of Astronomy in the University of Oxford, kindly prepared for
me. An inspection of it, in the manner directed by him, will show that
the phenomena indicated by Yâo to his astronomers were all apparent at
that date. This fact must be accepted as a strong proof of the
approximate correctness of the chronology, which places Yâo in the
twenty-fourth century B.C. The precession of the equinoxes, it has
already been observed, was not known in China till more than 2500 years
after the time assigned to Yâo, so that the culminating stars at the
equinoxes and solstices of his remote period could not have been
computed back scientifically in the time of the *K*âu dynasty, during
which the collection of the Shû existed. The form in which the
directions are given, and other things in the Canon, savour, indeed, of
legend, and I have not claimed for it that in its present form it be
received as a document contemporaneous with the reign of Yâo. I have
argued, however, that the compiler of it had before him ancient
documents, and one of them must have contained the facts about the
culminating of the stars, which I have now endeavoured to set in a clear
light.

The mention of these culminating stars does seem to fix Yâo's place in
chronology in the twenty-fourth century B.C., and to show that at that
remote era it was the custom to make and to record astronomical
observations of the heavenly bodies. Having respect to these things, my
claim to have the documents of the Shû from the Speech at Kan, nearly
two centuries later than Yâo, downwards, regarded as contemporaneous
with the events which they describe, cannot be considered extravagant.

7\. In the 27th Book of the 5th Part, the Marquis of

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lü on Punishments,
there is a historical reference which would carry us back four centuries
beyond the time of Yâo. It is said that, 'According to the teachings of
antiquity, *Kh*ih Yû was the first to create disorder.' There is no
intimation, however, of the time when this rebel disturbed the happy
order and innocence which had previously prevailed; and the very same
sentence brings the review of antiquity down to the time of Shun. But
the chronologers place him in the reign of Hwang Tî, towards the end of
the twenty-seventh century B.C. Other writers describe the struggle
between him and Hwang Tî, in which dragons, mists, and the invention of
the compass play conspicuous parts. It is to the credit of the Shû, and
an evidence of its being a genuine collection of historical memorials,
that this cursory reference to *Kh*ih Yû is the only mention in it of
any name older than that of Yâo.
