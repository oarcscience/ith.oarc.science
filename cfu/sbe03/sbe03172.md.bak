### BOOK XI. THE ODES OF KHIN.

THE state of *Kh*in took its name from its earliest principal city, in
the present district of *Kh*ing-shui, in *Kh*in *K*âu, Kan-sû. Its
chiefs claimed to be descended from Yî, who appears in the Shû as the
forester of Shun, and the assistant of the great Yü in his labours on
the flood of Yâo. The history of his descendants is very imperfectly
related till we come to a Fei-ȝze, who had charge of the herds of horses
belonging to king Hsiâo (B.C. 90989.5), and in consequence of his good
services. was invested with

the small territory of *Kh*in, as an attached state. A descendant of
his, known as duke Hsiang, in consequence of his loyal services, when
the capital was moved to the east in B.C. 770, was raised to the dignity
of an earl, and took his place among the great feudal princes of the
kingdom, receiving also a large portion of territory, which included the
ancient capital of the House of *K*âu. In course of time *Kh*in, as is
well known, superseded the dynasty of *K*âu, having gradually moved its
capital more and more to the east. The people of *Kh*in were, no doubt,
mainly composed of the wild tribes of the west.
