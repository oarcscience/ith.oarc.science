#### ODE 15, STANZA 1. THE PEI MĂN.

#### AN OFFICER OF WEI SETS FORTH HIS HARD LOT, THROUGH DISTRESSES AND THE BURDENS LAID UPON HIM, AND HIS SILENCE UNDER IT IN SUBMISSION TO HEAVEN.

I go out at the north gate, With my heart full of sorrow. Straitened am
I and poor, And no one takes knowledge of my distress. So it is! Heaven
has done it <span id="fr_619"></span>[1](#fn_599.md);--What then shall I
say?

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_599"></span>[434:1](sbe03160.htm#fr_619.md) The 'Complete
Digest of Comments on the Shih' warns its readers not to take 'Heaven'
here as synonymous with Ming, 'what is decreed or Commanded.' The writer
does not go on to define the precise idea which he understood the
character to convey. This appears to be what we often mean by
'Providence,' when we speak of anything permitted, rather than
appointed, by the supreme ruling Power.
