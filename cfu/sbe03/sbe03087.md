##### ODE 8. THE ȜÂI HSIEN.

##### APPROPRIATE TO AN OCCASION WHEN THE FEUDAL PRINCES HAD BEEN ASSISTING KING *KH*ĂNG AT A SACRIFICE TO HIS FATHER.

(they were to observe). With their dragon-emblazoned banners, flying

rings on the ends of the reins glittering, Admirable was their majesty
and splendour.

He led them to appear before his father shrined on the left <span

and presented his offerings;--That he might have granted to him long
life, And ever preserve (his dignity). Great and many are his blessings.
They are the brilliant and accomplished princes, Who cheer him with his
many sources of happiness,

the services of the ancestral temple, specified by Confucius and quoted

descent in the royal House. According to the rules for that purpose, the
characters here used enable us to determine the subject of this line as
king Wû, in opposition to his father Wan.
