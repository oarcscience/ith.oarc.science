#### ODE 2. THE *ZH*ÂI FAN.

#### CELEBRATING THE INDUSTRY AND REVERENCE OF A PRINCE'S WIFE, ASSISTING HIM IN SACRIFICING.

We must suppose the ladies of a harem, in one of the states of the
south, admiring and praising in these simple stanzas the way in which
their mistress discharged her duties. A view of the ode maintained by
many is that the lady gathered the southernwood, not to use it in
sacrificing, but in the nurture, of the silkworms under her care; but
the evidence of the characters in the text is, on the whole, in favour
of the more common view. Constant reference is made to the piece by
Chinese moralists, to show that the most trivial things are accepted in
sacrifice, when there are reverence and sincerity in the presenting of
them.

One critic asked *K*û Hsî whether it was conceivable that the wife of a
prince did herself what is here related, and he replied that the poet
said so. Another has observed that if the lady ordered and employed
others, it was still her own doing. But that the lady did it herself is
not incredible, when we consider the simplicity of those early times, in
the twelfth century B.C.

She gathers the white southernwood, By the ponds, on the islets. She
employs it, In the business of our prince.

She gathers the white southernwood, Along the streams in the valleys.
She employs it, In the temple <span id="fr_617"></span>[1](#fn_597.md) of
our prince.

<span id="page_432">p. 432</span>

With head-dress reverently rising aloft, Early, while yet it is night,
she is in the prince's (temple). In her head-dress, slowly retiring, She
returns (to her own apartments).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_597"></span>[431:1](sbe03156.htm#fr_617.md) If the character
here translated 'temple' had no other signification but that, there
would-be an end of the dispute about the meaning of the piece. But while
we find it often used of the ancestral temple, it may also mean any
building, especially one of a large and public character, such as a
palace or. mansion; and hence some contend that it should be interpreted
here of 'the silkworm house.' We are to conceive of the lady, after,
having gathered the materials for sacrificial use, then preparing them
according to rule, and while it is yet dark on the morning of the
sacrificial day, going with them into the temple, and setting them forth
in their proper vessels and places.
