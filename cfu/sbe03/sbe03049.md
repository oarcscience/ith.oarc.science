### BOOK XXII. THE TESTAMENTARY CHARGE.

THIS Book brings us to the closing act of the life of king *Kh*ăng,
whose reign, according to the current chronology, lasted thirty-seven
years, ending in B.C. 1079. From the appointment of *K*ün-*kh*ăn to his
death, the king's history is almost a blank. The only events chronicled
by Sze-mâ *Kh*ien are a coinage of round money with a square hole in the
centre,--the prototype of the present cash; and an enactment about the
width and length in which pieces of silk and cloth were to be
manufactured.

King *Kh*ăng, feeling that his end is near, calls his principal
ministers and other officers around his bed, and commits his son Kâo to
their care and guidance. The record of all these things and the dying
charge form a chapter that ends with the statement of the king's death.
The rest of the Book forms a second chapter, in which we have a detailed
account of the ceremonies connected with the publication of the charge,
and the accession of *K*âo to the throne. It is an interesting account
of the ways of that distant time on such occasions.

1\. In the fourth month, when the moon began to wane, the king was
indisposed. On the day Kiâ-ȝze,

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

he washed his hands and face; his attendants put on him his cap and
robes <span id="fr_265"></span>[1](#fn_255); (and he sat up.md), leaning on
a gem-adorned bench <span id="fr_266"></span>[2](#fn_256.md). He then
called together the Grand-Guardian Shih, the earls of *Z*ui and Thung,
the duke of Pî, the marquis of Wei, the duke of Mâo, the master of the
warders, the master of the guards, the heads of the various departments,
and the superintendents of affairs <span
id="fr_267"></span>[3](#fn_257.md).

The king said, 'Oh! my illness has greatly increased, and it will soon
be over with me. The malady comes on daily with more violence, and
maintains its hold. I am afraid I may not find (another opportunity) to
declare my wishes about my successor, and therefore I (now) lay my
charge upon you with special instructions. The former rulers, our kings
Wăn and Wû, displayed in succession their equal glory, making sure
provision for the support of the people, and setting forth their

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

instructions. (The people) accorded a practical submission, without any
opposition, and the influence (of their example and instructions)
extended to Yin, and the great appointment (of Heaven) was secured\*.
After them, I, the stupid one, received with reverence the dread
(decree) of Heaven, and continued to keep the great instructions of Wăn
and Wû, not daring blindly to transgress them.\*

'Now Heaven has laid affliction on me, and it seems as if I should not
again rise or be myself. Do you take clear note of these my words, and
in accordance with them watch reverently over my eldest son Kâo, and
greatly assist him in the difficulties of his position. Be kind to those
who are far off, and help those who are near. Promote the tranquillity
of the states, small and great, and encourage them (to well-doing). I
think how a man has to govern himself in dignity and with decorum;--do
not you allow *K*âo to proceed heedlessly on the impulse of improper
motives.' Immediately on receiving this charge, (the ministers and
others) withdrew. The tent <span id="fr_268"></span>[1](#fn_258.md) was
then carried out into

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

the court; and on the next day, (being) Yî-*kh*âu, the king died.

2\. The Grand-Guardian then ordered *K*ung Hwan <span
id="fr_269"></span>[1](#fn_259.md) and Nan-Kung Mâo <span
id="fr_270"></span>[2](#fn_260.md) to instruct Lü *K*i, the marquis of
*Kh*î <span id="fr_271"></span>[2](#fn_260.md), with two
shield-and-spearmen, and a hundred guards, to meet the prince *K*âo
outside the south gate <span id="fr_272"></span>[3](#fn_261.md), and
conduct him to (one of) the side-apartments (near to that where the king
lay), there to be as chief mourner <span
id="fr_273"></span>[4](#fn_262.md).

On the day Ting-mâo, (two days after the king's death), he ordered (the
charge) to be recorded on

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

tablets, and the forms (to be observed in publishing it). Seven days
after, on Kwei-yû, as chief (of the west) and premier, he ordered the
(proper) officers to prepare the wood (for all the requirements of the
funeral) <span id="fr_274"></span>[1](#fn_263.md).

The salvage men <span id="fr_275"></span>[2](#fn_264.md) set out the
screens <span id="fr_276"></span>[3](#fn_265.md), ornamented with figures
of axes, and the tents. Between the window (and the door), facing the
south, they placed the (three)fold mat of fine bamboo splints, with its
striped border of white and black silk, and the usual bench adorned with
different-coloured gems. In the side-space on the west, which faced the
east, they placed the threefold rush mat, with its variegated border,
and the usual bench adorned with beautiful shells. In the side-space on
the east, which faced the west, they placed the threefold mat of fine
grass, with its border of painted silk, and the usual bench carved, and
adorned with gems. Before the western side-chamber, and facing the
south, they placed the threefold mat of fine bamboo, with its dark mixed
border, and the usual lacquered bench <span
id="fr_277"></span>[4](#fn_266.md).

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

(They set forth) also the five pairs of gems (or jade), and the precious
things of display. There were the red knife, the great lessons, the
large round-and-convex symbol of jade, and the rounded and pointed
maces,--all in the side-space on the west; the large piece of jade, the
pieces contributed by the wild tribes of the east, the heavenly
sounding-stone, and the river-Plan,--all in the side-space on the east;
the dancing habits of Yin, the large . large tortoise-shell, and the
large drum,--all in the western apartment; the spear of Tûi, the bow of
Ho, and the bamboo arrows of *Kh*ui,--all in the eastern apartment <span
id="fr_278"></span>[1](#fn_267.md).

The grand carriage was by the guests' steps, facing (the south); the
next was by the eastern (or host' s) steps, facing (the south). The
front carriage was placed before the left lobby, and the one that
followed it before the right lobby <span
id="fr_279"></span>[2](#fn_268.md).

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

Two men in brownish leather caps, and holding three-cornered halberts,
stood inside the gate leading to the private apartments. Four men in
caps of spotted deer-skin, holding spears with blades upturned from the
base of the point, stood, one on each side of the steps east and west,
and near to the platform of the hall. One man in a great officer's cap,
and holding an axe, stood in the hall, (near the steps) at the east
(end). One man in a great officer's cap, and holding an axe of a
different pattern, stood in the hall, (near the steps) at the west end.
One man in a great officer's cap, and holding a lance, stood at the
front and east of the hall, close by the steps. One man in a great
officer's cap, and holding a lance of a different pattern, stood in the
corresponding place on the west. One man in a great officer's cap, and
holding a pointed weapon, stood by the steps on the north side of the
hall.

The king, in a linen cap and the variously figured, skirt, ascended by
the guests' steps, followed by the high ministers, (great) officers, and
princes of states, in linen caps and dark-coloured skirts <span
id="fr_280"></span>[1](#fn_269.md). Arrived in the hall, they all took
their (proper) places. The Grand-Guardian, the Grand-Historiographer,
and the Minister of Religion were all in

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

linen caps and red skirts. The Grand-Guardian bore the great mace. The
Minister of Religion bore the cup and the mace-cover. These two ascended
by the steps on the east <span id="fr_281"></span>[1](#fn_270.md). The
Grand Historiographer bore, the testamentary charge. He ascended by the
guests' steps (on the west), and advanced to the king with the tablets
containing the charge, and said, 'Our royal sovereign, leaning on the
gem-adorned bench, declared his last charge, and commanded you to
continue (the observance of) the lessons, and to take the rule of the
kingdom of Kin, complying with the great laws, and securing the harmony
of all under the sky, so as to respond to and display the bright
instructions of Wăn and Wû.'

The king twice bowed (low), and then arose, and replied, 'I am utterly
insignificant and but a child, how should I be able to govern the four
quarters (of the kingdom) with a corresponding reverent awe of the dread
majesty of Heaven!'\* He then received the cup and the mace-cover.
Thrice he slowly and reverently advanced with a cup of spirits (to the
east of the coffin); thrice he sacrificed (to the spirit of his
father);\* and thrice he put the cup down. The Minister of Religion
said, 'It is accepted <span id="fr_282"></span>[2](#fn_271.md).'\*

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

The Grand-Guardian received the cup, descended the steps, and washed his
hands <span id="fr_283"></span>[1](#fn_272.md). He then took another cup,
(placed it on) a half-mace which he carried, and repeated the
sacrifice <span id="fr_284"></span>[2](#fn_273.md).\* He then gave the cup
to one of the attendants of the Minister of Religion, and did obeisance.
The king returned the obeisance. The Grand-Guardian took a cup again,
and poured out the spirits in sacrifice.\* He then just tasted the
spirits, returned to his place, gave the cup to the attendant, and did
obeisance. The king returned the obeisance. The Grand Guardian descended
from the hall, after which the various (sacrificial) articles were
removed, and the princes all went out at the temple gate <span
id="fr_285"></span>[3](#fn_274.md) and waited.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_255"></span>[235:1](sbe03049.htm#fr_265.md) The king's caps or
crowns and robes were many, and for each there was the appropriate
occasion. His attendants, no doubt, now dressed king *Kh*ăng, as the
rules of court fashions required.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[235:2](sbe03049.htm#fr_266.md) In those days they
sat on the ground upon mats; and for the old or infirm benches or stools
were placed, in front of them, to lean forward on. The king had five
kinds of stools variously adorned. That with gems was the most
honourable.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[235:3](sbe03049.htm#fr_267.md) The Grand-Guardian
Shih, or the duke of Shâo, and the other five dignitaries were, no
doubt, the six ministers of the 20th Book. Zui is referred to the
present district of *K*âo-yî, department Hsî-an; and Thung to Hwâ *K*âu,
department Thung-*k*âu;--both in Shen-hsî. The earl of *Z*ui, it is
supposed, was Minister of Instruction, and he of Thung Minister of
Religion. Pi corresponded to the present district of *Kh*ang-an,
department Hsî-an. The duke of Pî was Minister of War, called Duke or
Kung, as Grand-Master. It is not known where Mâo was. The lord of it was
Minister of Works, and Grand-Assistant. The marquis of Wei,--see on Book
ix. He was now, it is supposed, Minister of Crime.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[236:1](sbe03049.htm#fr_268.md) The tent had been
prepared when the king sent for his ministers and officers to give them
his last charge, and set up outside his chamber in the hall where he was
accustomed to hold 'the audience of government.' He had walked or been
carried to it, and then returned to his apartment when he had expressed
his last wishes, while the tent--the curtains and canopy--was carried
out into the courtyard.

The palace was much more long or deep than wide, consisting of five
series of buildings continued one after another, so that, if all the
gates were thrown open, one could walk in a direct line from the first
gate to the last. The different parts of it were separated by courts
that embraced a large space of ground, and were partly open overhead.
The gates leading to the different parts had their particular names, and
were all fronting <span id="page_237">p. 237</span> the south. Outside
the second was held 'the outer levee,' where the king received the
princes and officers generally. Outside the fifth was held 'the audience
of government,' when he met his ministers to consult with them on the
business of the state. Inside this gate were the buildings which formed
the private apartments, in the hall leading to which was held 'the inner
audience,' and where the sovereign feasted those whom he designed
specially to honour. Such is the general idea of the ancient palace
given. by *K*û Hsî. The gateways included a large space, covered by a
roof, supported on pillars.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[237:1](sbe03049.htm#fr_269.md) We know nothing
more of these officers but what is here related.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[237:2](sbe03049.htm#fr_271.md) The marquis of
*Kh*î was the son of Thaî-kung, a friend and minister of king Wăn, who
had been enfeoffed by king Wû with the state of Khî, embracing the
present department of *Kh*ing-*k*âu, in Shan-tung, and other territory.
His place at court was that of master of the guards.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[237:3](sbe03049.htm#fr_272.md) All the gates
might be called 'south gates.' It is not certain whether that intended
here was the outer gate of all, or the last immediately in front of the
hall, where the king had given his charge. Whichever it was, the meeting
*K*âo in the way described was a public declaration that he had been
appointed successor to the throne.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[237:4](sbe03049.htm#fr_273.md) 'The mourning
shed,' spoken of in Part IV, viii, ch. 1, had not yet been set up, and
the apartment here indicated---on the east of the hall of audience--was
the proper one for the prince to occupy in the mean time.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[238:1](sbe03049.htm#fr_274.md) On the seventh day
after his death the king had been shrouded and put into his coffin. But
there were still the shell or outer coffin, &c., to be provided.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[238:2](sbe03049.htm#fr_275.md) These 'salvage
men' were, I suppose, natives of the wild Tî tribes, employed to perform
the more servile offices about the court. Some of them, we know, were
enrolled among the guards.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[238:3](sbe03049.htm#fr_276.md) The screens were
ornamented with figures of axe-heads, and placed behind the king, under
the canopy that overshadowed him.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[238:4](sbe03049.htm#fr_277.md) All these
arrangements seem to have been made in the hall where king *Kh*ăng had
delivered his charge. He had been accustomed to receive his guests at
all the places where the tents, screens, and mats were now set. It was
presumed he would be present in spirit at the ceremony of proclaiming
his son, and making known to him his dying charge; and as they could not
tell at what particular spot the spirit would be, they made all the
places ready for it.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[239:1](sbe03049.htm#fr_278.md) The western and
eastern apartments were two rooms, east and west of the hall, forming
part of the private apartments, behind the side rooms, and of large
dimensions. The various articles enumerated were precious relics, and
had been favourites with king *Kh*ăng. They were now displayed to keep
up the illusion of the king's still being present in spirit. 'They were
set forth,' it is said, 'at the ancestral sacrifices to show that the
king could preserve them, and at the ceremony of announcing a
testamentary charge to show that he could transmit them.' About the
articles themselves it is not necessary to append particular notes. They
perished thousands of years ago, and the accounts of them by the best
scholars are little more than conjectural.

<span id="fn_268"></span>[239:2](sbe03049.htm#fr_279.md) The royal
carriages were of five kinds, and four of them at least were now set
forth inside the last gate, that everything might again be done, as when
the king was alive. On the west side of the hall were the guests, steps
(or staircase), by which visitors <span id="page_240">p. 240</span>
ascended, and on the east were those used by the host himself. If one of
the royal carriages was absent on this occasion, it must, have been that
used in war, as not being appropriate at such a time.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[240:1](sbe03049.htm#fr_280.md) All was now ready
for the grand ceremony, and the performers, in their appropriate
mourning and sacrificial array, take their places in the hall. *K*âo is
here for the first time styled 'king;' but still he goes up by the
guests' steps, not presuming to ascend by the others, while his father's
corpse was in the hall.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[241:1](sbe03049.htm#fr_281.md) The Grand-Guardian
and the Minister of Religion ascended by the eastern steps, because the
authority of king *Kh*ăng was in their persons, to be conveyed by the
present ceremony to his son. 'The great mace' was one of the emblems of
the royal sovereignty, and 'the cup' also must have been one that only
the king could use. 'The mace-cover' was an instrument by which the
genuineness of the symbols of their rank conferred on the different
princes was tested.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[241:2](sbe03049.htm#fr_282.md) According to Khung
Ying-tâ, when the king received the record of the charge, he was
standing at the top of the eastern steps, a little eastwards, with his
face to the north. The Historiographer stood by king *Kh*ăng's coffin,
on the south-west of it, with his face <span id="page_242">p. 242</span>
to the east. There he read the charge, after which the king bowed twice,
and the Minister of Religion, on the south-west of the king, presented
the cup and mace-cover. The king took them, and, having given the cover
in charge to an attendant, advanced with the cup to the place between
the pillars where the sacrificial spirits were placed. Having filled a
cup, he advanced to the east of the coffin, and stood with his face to
the west; then going to the spot where his father's spirit was supposed
to be, he sacrificed, pouring out the spirits on the ground, and then he
put the cup on the bench appropriated for it. This he repeated three
times. At the conclusion the Minister of Religion conveyed to him a
message from the spirit of his father, that his offering was accepted.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[242:1](sbe03049.htm#fr_283.md) Preparatory, that
is, to his offering a sacrifice.

<span id="fn_273"></span>[242:2](sbe03049.htm#fr_284.md) That is, probably,
repeated the sacrifice to the spirit of king *Kh*ăng, as if to inform
him that his charge had been communicated to his son. The half-mace was
used as a handle for the sacrificial cup. This ceremony appears to have
been gone through twice. The Grand-Guardian's bowing was to the spirit
of king *Kh*ăng, and the new king returned the obeisance for his father.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[242:3](sbe03049.htm#fr_285.md) Meaning the fifth
or last gate of the palace. The private apartments had for the time,
through the presence of the coffin and by the sacrifices, been converted
into a sort of ancestral temple.
