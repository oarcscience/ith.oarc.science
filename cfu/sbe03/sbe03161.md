### BOOK IV. THE ODES OF YUNG.

See the preliminary note on [p. 433](sbe03158.htm#page_433).

#### ODE 1. THE PAI *K*ÂU.

#### PROTEST OF A WIDOW AGAINST BEING URGED TO MARRY AGAIN, AND HER APPEAL TO HER MOTHER AND TO HEAVEN.

THIS piece, it is said, was made by Kung *K*iang, the widow of Kung-po,
son of the marquis Hsî of Wei (B.C. 855-814). Kung-po having died an
early death, her parents (who must have been the marquis of *Kh*î and
his wife or one of the ladies of his harem) wanted to force her to a
second marriage, against which she protests. The ode was preserved, no
doubt, as an example of

what the Chinese have always considered a great virtue,--the refusal of
a, widow to marry again.

It floats about, that boat of cypress wood, There in the middle of the
Ho <span id="fr_620"></span>[1](#fn_600). With his two tufts of hair
falling over his forehead <span id="fr_621"></span>[2](#fn_601), He was
my mate; And I swear that till death I will have no other. O mother, O
Heavens <span id="fr_622"></span>[3](#fn_602), Why will you not
understand me?

It floats about, that boat of cypress wood, There by the side of the Ho.
With his two tufts of hair falling over his forehead, He was my only
one; And I swear that till death I will not do the evil thing. O mother,
O Heaven, Why will you not understand me?

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_600"></span>[435:1](sbe03161.htm#fr_620) These allusive
lines, probably, indicate the speaker's widowhood, Which left her like
'a boat floating about on the water.'

<span id="fn_601"></span>[435:2](sbe03161.htm#fr_621) Such was the mode
in which the hair was kept, while a boy or young man's parents were
alive, parted into two tufts from the pia mater, and brought down as low
as the eyebrows on either side of the forehead.

<span id="fn_602"></span>[435:3](sbe03161.htm#fr_622) Mâo, thought that
the lady intended her father by 'Heaven;' while *K*û held that her
father may have been dead, and that the mother is called Heaven, with
reference to the kindness and protection that she ought to show. There
seems rather to be in the term a wild, and not very intelligent, appeal
to the supreme Power in heaven.
