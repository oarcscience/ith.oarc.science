## CHAPTER V. FILIAL PIETY IN INFERIOR OFFICERS.

As they serve their fathers, so, they serve their mothers, and they love
them equally. As they serve their fathers, so they serve their rulers,
and they reverence them equally. Hence love is what is chiefly rendered
to the mother, and reverence is what is chiefly rendered to the ruler,
while both of these things are given to the father. Therefore when they
serve their ruler with filial piety they are loyal; when they serve
their superiors with reverence they are obedient. Not failing in this
loyalty

and obedience in serving those above them, they are then able to
preserve their emoluments and positions, and to maintain their
sacrifices <span id="fr_665"></span>[1](#fn_645.md):--this is the filial
piety of inferior officers <span id="fr_666"></span>[2](#fn_646.md).

It is said in the Book of Poetry <span id="fr_667"></span>[3](#fn_647.md),

'Rising early and going to sleep late,  
Do not disgrace those who gave you birth.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_645"></span>[471:1](sbe03185.htm#fr_665.md) These officers had
their 'positions' or places, and their pay. They had also their
sacrifices, but such as were private or personal to themselves, so that
we have not much information about them.

<span id="fn_646"></span>[471:2](sbe03185.htm#fr_666.md) The Chinese
Repository has here, 'Such is the influence of filial duty when
performed by scholars;' and P. Cibot, 'Voilà sommairement ce qui
caractérise la Piété Filiale du Lettré.' But to use the term 'scholar'
here is to translate from the standpoint of modern China, and not from
that of the time of Confucius. The Shih of feudal China were the younger
sons of the higher classes, and men that by their ability were rising
out of the lower, and who were all in inferior situations, and looking
forward to offices of trust in the service of the royal court, or of
their several states. Below the 'great officers' of ch. 4, three classes
of Shih-the highest, middle, lowest-were recognised, all intended in
this chapter. When the feudal system had passed away, the class of
'scholars' gradually took their place. Shih (<span
id="img_47100"></span> ![](img/47100.jpg)) is one of the oldest
characters in Chinese, but the idea expressed in its formation is not
known. Confucius is quoted in the Shwo Wăn as making, it to be from the
characters for one (<span id="img_47101"></span> ![](img/47101.jpg)) and
ten (<span id="img_47102"></span> ![](img/47102.jpg)). A very old
definition of it is--'The denomination of one entrusted with affairs.'

<span id="fn_647"></span>[471:3](sbe03185.htm#fr_667.md) See the Shih, II,
iii, ode 2, stanza 6.
