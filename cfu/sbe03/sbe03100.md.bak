##### ODE 11. THE PAN.

##### CELEBRATING THE GREATNESS OF *K*ÂU, AND ITS FIRM POSSESSION OF THE KINGDOM, AS SEEN IN THE PROGRESSES OF ITS REIGNING SOVEREIGN.

In the eighth piece of the first decade we have an ode akin to this,
relating a tentative progress of king Wû, to test the acceptance of his
sovereignty. This is of a later date, and should be referred, probably,
to the reign of king *Kh*ăng, when the dynasty was fully acknowledged.
Some critics, however, make it, like the three preceding, a portion of
what was sung at the Wû dance.

Oh! great now is Kâu. We ascend the high hills, Both those that are long
and narrow, and the lofty mountains. Yes, and (we travel) along the
regulated Ho, All under the sky, Assembling those who now respond to me.
Thus it is that the appointment belongs to *K*âu.
