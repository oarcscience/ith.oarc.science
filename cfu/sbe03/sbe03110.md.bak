#### ODE 8, STANZAS 4, 5, AND 7. THE *K*ĂNG YÜEH.

#### THE *K*ĂNG YÜEH IS, LIKE THE PRECEDING ODE, A LAMENTATION OVER THE MISERIES OF THE KINGDOM, AND THE RUIN COMING ON IT; WITH A SIMILAR, BUT MORE HOPEFULLY EXPRESSED, APPEAL TO HEAVEN, 'THE GREAT GOD.'

Look into the middle of the forest; There are (only) large faggots and
small branches in it <span id="fr_430"></span>[1](#fn_416.md). The people
now amidst their perils Look to Heaven, all dark; But let its
determination be fixed, And there is no one whom it will not overcome.
There is the great God,--Does he hate any one?

If one say of a hill that it is low, There are its ridges and its large
masses. The false calumnies of the people,--How is it that you do not
repress them <span id="fr_431"></span>[2](#fn_417.md)? You call those
experienced ancients, You consult the diviner of dreams. They all say,
'We are very wise, But who can distinguish the male and female
crow <span id="fr_432"></span>[3](#fn_418.md)?'

Look at the rugged and stony field;--Luxuriantly rises in it the
springing grain. (But) Heaven moves and shakes me, As if it could not
overcome me <span id="fr_433"></span>[4](#fn_419.md).

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They sought me (at
first) to be a pattern (to them), (Eagerly) as if they could not get me;
(Now) they regard me with great animosity, And will not use my strength.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_416"></span>[354:1](sbe03110.htm#fr_430.md) By introducing the
word 'only,' I have followed the view of the older interpreters, who
consider the forest, with merely some faggots and twigs left in it, to
be emblematic of the ravages of oppressive government in the court and
kingdom. Ka Hsî takes a different view of them:--'In a forest you can
easily distinguish the large faggots from the small branches, while
Heaven appears unable to distinguish between the good and bad.'

<span id="fn_417"></span>[354:2](sbe03110.htm#fr_431.md) The calumnies that
were abroad were as absurd as the assertion in line 1, and yet the king
could not, or would not, see through them and repress them.

<span id="fn_418"></span>[354:3](sbe03110.htm#fr_432.md) This reference to
the diviners of dreams is in derision of their pretensions.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[354:4](sbe03110.htm#fr_433.md) That is, the
productive energy of nature manifests itself in the most unlikely
places; how was it that 'the great God, who hates no one,' was
contending so with the writer?
