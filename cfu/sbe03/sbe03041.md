### BOOK XIV. THE NUMEROUS OFFICERS.

WE have in this Book another 'Announcement,' addressed to the people of
Yin or Shang, and especially to the higher classes among them,--'the
numerous officers,'--to reconcile them to their lot as subjects of the
new dynasty. From the preceding two Books it appears that many of the
people of Yin had been removed to the country about the Lo, before the
dukes of Shâo and Kâu commenced the building of the new city. Now that
the city was completed, another and larger migration of them, we may
suppose, was ordered; and the duke of *K*âu took occasion to issue the
announcement that is here preserved.

I have divided it into four chapters. The first vindicates the kings of
*K*âu for superseding the line of Shang, not from ambition, but in
obedience to the will of God. The second unfolds the causes why the
dynasty of Yin or Shang had been set aside. The third shows how it had
been necessary to remove them to Lo, and with what good intention the
new capital had been built. The fourth tells how comfort and prosperity
were open to their attainment at Lo, while by perseverance in
disaffection they would only bring misery and ruin upon themselves.

1\. In the third month, at the commencement (of the government) of the
duke of *K*âu in the new city of Lo, he announced (the royal will) to
the officers of the Shang dynasty, 'saying, 'The king speaks to this
effect:--"Ye numerous officers who remain from the dynasty of Yin, great
ruin came down on Yin from the cessation of forbearance in compassionate
Heaven, and we, the lords of *K*âu, received its favouring decree.\* We
felt charged with its bright terrors, carried out the punishments which
kings inflict, rightly disposed of the appointment of Yin, and finished
(the work of) God.\* Now, ye numerous officers, it was not our small
state that dared to aim at the appointment belonging to Yin. But Heaven
was not with (Yin), for indeed it would not

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

strengthen its misrule. It (therefore) helped us;--did we dare to seek
the throne of ourselves? God was not for (Yin), as appeared from the
mind and conduct of our inferior people, in which there is the brilliant
dreadfulness of Heaven."'\*

2\. 'I have heard the saying, "God leads men to tranquil security,"\*
but the sovereign of Hsiâ would not move to such security, whereupon God
sent down corrections, indicating his mind to him. (Kieh), however,
would not be warned by God, but proceeded to greater dissoluteness and
sloth and excuses for himself. Then Heaven no longer regarded nor heard
him, but disallowed his great appointment, and inflicted extreme
punishment. Then it charged your founder, Thang the Successful, to set
Hsiâ aside, and by means of able men to rule the kingdom. From Thang the
Successful down to Tî-yî, every sovereign sought to make his virtue
illustrious, and duly attended to the sacrifices.\* And thus it was
that, while Heaven exerted a great establishing influence, preserving
and regulating the House of Yin, its sovereigns on their part were
humbly careful not to lose (the favour of) God, and strove to manifest a
good-doing corresponding to that of Heaven.\* But in these times, their
successor showed himself greatly ignorant of (the ways of) Heaven, and
much less could it be expected of him that he would be regardful of the
earnest labours of his fathers for the country. Greatly abandoned to
dissolute idleness, he gave no thought to the bright principles of
Heaven, and the awfulness of the people.\* On this account God no longer
protected him, but sent down the great ruin which we have witnessed.
Heaven was not with him, because he

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

did not make his virtue illustrious.\* (Indeed), with regard to the
overthrow of all states, great and small, throughout the four quarters
of the kingdom, in every case reasons can be given for their
punishment.'

The king speaks to this effect:--"Ye numerous officers of Yin, the case
now is this, that the kings of our *K*âu, from their great goodness,
were charged with the work of God. There was the charge to them, 'Cut
off Yin.' (They proceeded to perform it), and announced the execution of
their service to God. In our affairs we have followed no double
aims;--ye of the royal House (of Yin) must (now simply) follow us."'\*

3\. '"May I not say that you have been very lawless? I did not (want to)
remove you. The thing came from your own city <span
id="fr_215"></span>[1](#fn_208.md). When I consider also how Heaven has
drawn near to Yin with so great tribulations, it must be that there was
(there) what was not right."

'The king says, "Ho! I declare to you, ye numerous officers, it is
simply on account of these things that I have removed you and settled
you here in the west <span id="fr_216"></span>[2](#fn_209.md);--it was not
that I, the One man, considered it a part of my virtue to interfere with
your tranquillity. The thing was from Heaven; do not offer resistance; I
shall not presume to have any subsequent (charge concerning you); do not
murmur against me. Ye know that your fathers of the Yin dynasty had
their archives and statutes, (showing

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

how) Yin superseded the appointment of Hsiâ. Now, indeed, ye say
further, '(The officers of) Hsiâ were chosen and employed in the royal
court (of Shang), and had their duties among the mass of its officers.'
(But) I, the One man, listen only to the virtuous, and employ them; and
it was with this view that I ventured to seek you in your capital of
Shang (once sanctioned by) Heaven, (and removed you here to Lo.) I
thereby follow (the ancient example), and have pity on you. (Your
present non-employment) is no fault of mine;--it is by the decree of
Heaven."\*

'The king says, "Ye numerous officers, formerly, when I came from
Yen <span id="fr_217"></span>[1](#fn_210.md), I greatly mitigated the
penalty and spared the lives of the people of your four states <span
id="fr_218"></span>[2](#fn_211.md). At the same time I made evident the
punishment appointed by Heaven, and removed you to this distant abode,
that you might be near the ministers who had served in our honoured
(capital) <span id="fr_219"></span>[3](#fn_212), and (learn.md) their much
obedience."

'The king says, "I declare to you, ye numerous officers of Yin, now I
have not put you to death, and therefore I reiterate the declaration of
my charge <span id="fr_220"></span>[4](#fn_213.md). I have now built this
great city here in

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lo, considering
that there was no (central) place in which to receive my guests from the
four quarters, and also that you, ye numerous officers, might here with
zealous activity perform the part of ministers to us, with the entire
obedience (ye would learn). Ye have still here, I may say, your grounds,
and May still rest in your duties and dwellings. If you can reverently
obey, Heaven will favour and compassionate you. If you do not reverently
obey, you shall not only not have your lands, but I will also carry to
the utmost Heaven's inflictions on. your persons. Now you may here dwell
in your villages, and perpetuate your families; you may pursue your
occupations and enjoy your years in this Lo; your children also will
prosper;--(all) from your being removed here."

'The king says------ <span id="fr_221"></span>[1](#fn_214.md); and again he
says, "Whatever I may now have spoken is on account of (my anxiety
about) your residence here."'

conduct in your own city.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[198:2](sbe03041.htm#fr_216.md) Lo is often called
'the eastern capital,' as being east from Hâo, the capital of king Wû;
but it was west from *K*âo-ko, the capital of Yin.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[199:1](sbe03041.htm#fr_217.md) Yen was the name
of a territory, corresponding to the present district of *Kh*ü-fâu, in
Shan-tung. The wild tribe inhabiting it, had joined with Wû-*k*ăng and
the king's uncles a few years before; and the crushing of the Yen had
been the last act in the suppression of their rebellion.

no doubt, at this time many ministers and officers from Hâo in Lo; but
