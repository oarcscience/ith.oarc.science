### BOOK X. THE ODES OF THANG.

THE odes of Thang were really the odes of Ȝin, the greatest of the fiefs
of *K*âu until the rise of *Kh*in. King *Kh*ăng, in B.C. 1107, invested
his younger brother, called Shû-yü, with the territory where Yâo was
supposed to have ruled anciently as the marquis of Thang, in the present
department of Thâi-yüan, Shan-hsî, the fief retaining that ancient name.
Subsequently the name of the state was changed to Ȝin, from the river
Ȝin in the southern part of it.
