## CHAPTER XI. FILIAL PIETY IN RELATION TO THE FIVE PUNISHMENTS.

The Master said, 'There are three thousand offences against which the
five punishments are directed <span id="fr_686"></span>[2](#fn_666), and
there is not one of them greater than being unfilial.

'When constraint is put upon a ruler, that is the disowning of his
superiority; when the authority of the sages is disallowed, that is the
disowning of (all) law; when filial piety is put aside, that is the
disowning of the principle of affection. These (three things) pave the
way to anarchy.'
