#### ODE 6, STANZAS 1 AND 7. THE *K*ĂNG MIN.

#### CELEBRATING THE VIRTUES OF *K*UNG SHAN-FÛ, WHO APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL MINISTERS OF KING HSÜAN, AND HIS DESPATCH TO THE EAST, TO FORTIFY THE CAPITAL OF THE STATE OF *KH*Î.

Heaven, in giving birth to the multitudes of the people, To every
faculty and relationship annexed its law. The people possess this normal
nature, And they (consequently) love its normal virtue <span

Brilliantly affecting it by his conduct below, And to maintain him, its
Son, Gave birth to *K*ung Shan-fû <span id="fr_609"></span>[2](#fn_589).

*K*ung Shan-fû went forth, having sacrificed to the spirit of the
road <span id="fr_610"></span>[3](#fn_590). His four steeds were strong;

alert, He was always anxious lest he should not be equal to his
commission; His steeds went on without stopping, To the tinkling of
their eight bells. The king had given charge to *K*ung Shan-fû, To
fortify the city there in the east.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_588"></span>[425:1](sbe03149.htm#fr_608) We get an idea of
the meaning which has been attached to these four lines from a very
early time by Mencius' quotation of them (VI, i, ch. 6) in support of
his doctrine of the goodness of human nature, and the remark on the
piece which he attributes to Confucius, that 'the maker of it knew
indeed the constitution (of our nature).' Every faculty, bodily or
mental, has its function to fulfil, and every relationship its duty to
be discharged. The function and the duty are the things which the human
being has to observe:--the seeing clearly, for instance, with the eyes,
and bearing distinctly with the ears; the maintenance of righteousness
between ruler and minister, and of affection between parent and child.
This is the 'normal nature,' and the 'normal virtue' is the nature
fulfilling the various laws of its constitution.

<span id="fn_589"></span>[425:2](sbe03149.htm#fr_609) The connexion
between these four lines and those that precede is this:--that while
Heaven produces all men with the good nature there described, on
occasions it produces others with virtue and powers in a super-eminent
degree. Such an occasion was presented by the case of king Hsüan, and
therefore, to mark its appreciation of him, and for his help,, it now
produced *K*ung Shan-fû.

<span id="fn_590"></span>[425:3](sbe03149.htm#fr_610) This was a special
sacrifice at the commencement of a journey, or of an expedition. See
note 2 on [p. 399](sbe03136.htm#page_399).
