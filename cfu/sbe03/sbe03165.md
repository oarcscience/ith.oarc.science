#### ODE 4, STANZAS 1 AND 2. THE MĂNG.

#### AN UNFORTUNATE WOMAN, WHO HAD BEEN SEDUCED INTO AN IMPROPER CONNEXION, NOW CAST OFF, RELATES AND BEMOANS HER SAD CASE.

An extract is given from the pathetic history here related, because it
shows how divination was used among the common people, and entered
generally into the ordinary affairs of life.

A simple-looking lad you were, Carrying cloth

to exchange it for silk. (But) you came not so to purchase silk;--You
came to make proposals to me. I convoyed you through the *Kh*î <span
id="fr_629"></span>[1](#fn_609), As far as Tun-*kh*iû <span
id="fr_630"></span>[2](#fn_610), 'It is not I,' (I said), 'who would
protract the time; But you have had no good go-between. I pray you be
not angry, And let autumn be the time.'

I ascended that ruinous wall, To look towards Fû-kwan <span
id="fr_631"></span>[3](#fn_611); And when I saw (you) not (coming from)
it, My tears flowed in streams. When I did see (you coming from)
Fû-kwan, I laughed and I spoke. You had consulted, (you said), the
tortoiseshell and the divining stalks, And there was nothing
unfavourable in their response <span id="fr_632"></span>[4](#fn_612).
'Then come,' (I said), 'with your carriage, And I will remove with my
goods.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_609"></span>[438:1](sbe03165.htm#fr_629) The *Kh*î was a
famous river of Wei.

<span id="fn_610"></span>[438:2](sbe03165.htm#fr_630) Tun-*kh*iû was a
well-known place--'the mound or height of Tun'-south of the Wei.

<span id="fn_611"></span>[438:3](sbe03165.htm#fr_631) Fû-kwan must have
been the place where the man lived, according to *K*û. Rather, it must
have been a pass (Fû-kwan may mean 'the gate or pass of Fû'), through
which he would come, and was visible from near the residence of the
woman.

<span id="fn_612"></span>[438:4](sbe03165.htm#fr_632) Ying tâ observes
that the man had never divined about the matter, and said that he had
done so only to complete the process of seduction. The critics dwell on
the inconsistency of divination being resorted to in such a
case:--'Divination is proper only if used in reference to what is right
and moral.'
