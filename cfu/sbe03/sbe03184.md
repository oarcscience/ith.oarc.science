## CHAPTER IV. FILIAL PIETY IN HIGH MINISTERS AND GREAT OFFICERS.

They do not presume to wear robes other than those appointed by the laws
of the ancient kings <span id="fr_662"></span>[2](#fn_642.md); nor to speak
words other than those sanctioned by their speech; nor to exhibit
conduct other than that exemplified by their virtuous ways. Thus none of
their words being contrary to those sanctions, and none of their actions
contrary to the (right) way,

<span id="page_470">p. 470</span>

from their mouths there comes no exceptionable speech, and in their
conduct there are found no exceptionable actions. Their 'words may fill
all under heaven, and no error of speech will be found in them. Their
actions may fill all under heaven, and no dissatisfaction or dislike
will be awakened by them. When these three things--(their robes, their
words, and their conduct)--are all complete as they should be, they can
then preserve their ancestral temples <span
id="fr_663"></span>[1](#fn_643.md):--this is the filial piety of high
ministers and great officers.

It is said in the Book of Poetry <span id="fr_664"></span>[2](#fn_644.md),

'He is never idle, day or night,  
In the service of the One man.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_642"></span>[469:2](sbe03184.htm#fr_662.md) The articles of
dress, to be worn by individuals according to their rank, from the
sovereign downwards, in their ordinary attire, and on special occasions,
were the subject of attention and enactment in China from the earliest
times. We find references to them in the earliest books of the Shû (Part
11, Books iii, iv). The words to be spoken, and conduct to be exhibited,
on every varying occasion, could not be so particularly described; but
the example of the ancient kings would suffice for these, as their
enactments for the dress.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[470:1](sbe03184.htm#fr_663.md) Their ancestral
temples were to the ministers and grand officers what the altars of
their land and grain were to the feudal lords. Every great officer had
three temples or shrines, in which he sacrificed to the first chief of
his family or clan; to his grandfather, and to his father. While these
remained, the family remained, and its honours were perpetuated.

<span id="fn_644"></span>[470:2](sbe03184.htm#fr_664.md) See the Shih, III,
iii, ode 6, stanza 4.
