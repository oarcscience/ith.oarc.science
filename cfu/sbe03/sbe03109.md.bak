#### ODE 7. THE KIEH NAN SHAN.

#### A LAMENTATION OVER THE UNSETTLED STATE OF THE KINGDOM DENOUNCING THE INJUSTICE AND NEGLECT OF THE CHIEF MINISTER, BLAMING ALSO THE CONDUCT OF THE KING, WITH APPEALS TO HEAVEN, AND SEEMINGLY CHARGING IT WITH CRUELTY AND INJUSTICE.

This piece is referred to-the time of king Yû (B.C. 781, to 771), the
unworthy son of king Hsüan. The 'Grand-Master' Yin must have been one of
the 'three Kung,' the highest ministers at the court of *K*âu, and was,
probably, the chief of the three, and administrator of the government
under Yû.

Lofty is that southern hill <span id="fr_427"></span>[2](#fn_413.md), With
its masses of rocks! Awe-inspiring are you, O (Grand-)Master

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Yin, And the
people all look to you! A fire burns in their grieving hearts; They do
not dare to speak of you even in jest. The kingdom is verging to
extinction;--How is it that you do not consider the state of things?

Lofty is that southern hill, And vigorously grows the vegetation on it!
Awe-inspiring are you,--O (Grand-)Master Yin, But how is it that you are
so unjust? Heaven is continually redoubling its inflictions; Deaths and
disorder increase and multiply; No words of satisfaction come from the
people; And yet you do not correct nor bemoan yourself

The Grand-Master Yin Is the foundation of our *K*âu, And the balance of
the kingdom is in his hands. He should be keeping its four quarters
together; He should be aiding the Son of Heaven, So as to preserve the
people from going astray. O unpitying great Heaven, It is not right he
should reduce us all to such misery!

He does nothing himself personally, And the people have no confidence in
him. Making no enquiry about them, and no trial of their services, He
should not deal deceitfully with superior men. If he dismissed them on
the requirement of justice, Mean men would not be endangering (the
commonweal); And his mean relatives Would not be in offices of
importance.

Great Heaven, unjust, Is sending down these exhausting disorders. Great
Heaven, unkind, Is sending down these great miseries. Let superior men
come (into office), And that would bring rest to the people's hearts.
Let superior men execute

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

their justice, And the animosities and angers would disappear <span
id="fr_428"></span>[1](#fn_414.md).

O unpitying great Heaven, There is no end to the disorder! With every
month it continues to grow, So that the people have no repose. I am as
if intoxicated with the grief of my heart. Who holds the ordering of the
kingdom? He attends not himself to the government, And the result is
toil and pain to the people.

I yoke my four steeds, My four steeds, long-necked. I look to the four
quarters (of the kingdom); Distress is everywhere; there is no place I
can drive to.

Now your evil is rampant <span id="fr_429"></span>[2](#fn_415.md), And I
can see your spears. Anon you are pacified and friendly as if you were
pledging one another.

From great Heaven is the injustice, And our king has no repose. (Yet) he
will not correct his heart, And goes on to resent endeavours to rectify
him,

I, *K*iâ-fû, have made this poem, To lay bare a the king's disorders. If
you would but change your heart, Then would the myriad regions be
nourished.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_413"></span>[351:2](sbe03109.htm#fr_427.md) 'The southern
hill' was also called the *K*ung-nan, and rose right to the south of the
western capital of *K*âu.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[353:1](sbe03109.htm#fr_428.md) In this stanza, as
in the next and the last but one, the writer complains of Heaven, and
charges it foolishly. He does so by way of appeal, however, and
indicates the true causes of the misery of the kingdom,--the reckless
conduct, namely, of the king and his minister.

<span id="fn_415"></span>[353:2](sbe03109.htm#fr_429.md) The parties spoken
of here are the followers of the minister, 'mean men,' however high in
place and great in power, now friendly, now hostile to one another.
