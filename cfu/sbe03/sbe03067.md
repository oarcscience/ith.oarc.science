#### ODE 3. THE HSÜAN NIÂO

#### APPROPRIATE TO A SACRIFICE IN THE ANCESTRAL TEMPLE OF SHANG;--INTENDED SPECIALLY TO DO HONOUR TO THE KING WÛ-TING.

If this ode were not intended to do honour to Wû-ting, the Kâo Ȝung of
Shang, we cannot account for the repeated mention of him in it. *K*û
Hsî, however, in his note on it, says nothing about Wû-ting, but simply
that the piece belonged to the sacrifices in the ancestral temple,
tracing back the line of the kings of Shang to its origin, and to its
attaining the sovereignty of the kingdom. Not at all unlikely is the
view of *K*ăng Hsüan, that the sacrifice was in the third year after the
death of Wû-ting and offered to him in the temple of Hsieh, the ancestor
of the Shang dynasty.

Heaven commissioned the swallow, To descend and give birth to (the
father of our) Shang <span id="fr_337"></span>[1](#fn_325). (His
descendants) dwelt in the land of Yin, and became great. (Then) long ago
God appointed the martial Thang, To regulate the boundaries throughout
the four quarters (of the kingdom).

(In those) quarters he appointed the princes, And grandly possessed the
nine regions <span id="fr_338"></span>[2](#fn_326). The

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

first sovereign of Shang <span id="fr_339"></span>[1](#fn_327) Received
the appointment without any element of instability in it, And it is
(now) held by the descendant of Wû-ting <span
id="fr_340"></span>[2](#fn_328).

The descendant of Wû-ting Is a martial sovereign, equal to every
emergency. Ten princes, (who came) with their dragon-emblazoned banners,
Bear the large dishes of millet.

The royal domain of a thousand lî Is where the people rest; But the
boundaries that reach to the four seas commence there.

From the four seas <span id="fr_341"></span>[3](#fn_329) they come (to
our sacrifices); They come in multitudes. *K*ing has the Ho for its
outer border <span id="fr_342"></span>[4](#fn_330). That Yin <span
id="fr_343"></span>[5](#fn_331) should have received the appointment (of
Heaven) was entirely right;--(Its sovereign) sustains all its dignities.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_325"></span>[307:1](sbe03067.htm#fr_337) The father of
Shang is Hsieh, who has already been mentioned. The mother of Hsieh was
a daughter of the House of the ancient state of Sung, and a concubine of
the ancient ruler Khû (B.C. 2435). According to Mâo, she accompanied
Khû, at the time of the vernal equinox, when the swallow made its
appearance, to sacrifice and pray to the first match-maker, and the
result was the birth of Hsieh. Sze-mâ *Kh*ien and *K*ăng make Hsieh's
birth more marvellous:--The lady was bathing in some open place, when a
swallow made its appearance, and dropt an egg, which she took and
swallowed; and from this came Hsieh. The editors of the imperial edition
of the Shih, of the present dynasty, say we need not believe the
legends;--the important point is to believe that the birth of Hsieh was
specially ordered by Heaven.

<span id="fn_326"></span>[307:2](sbe03067.htm#fr_338) 'The nine regions'
are the nine provinces into which Yü divided the kingdom.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[308:1](sbe03067.htm#fr_339) That is, Thang.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[308:2](sbe03067.htm#fr_340) If this ode were
used, as *K*ăng supposes, in the third year after Wû-ting's death, this
'descendant' would be his son Zû-kang, B.C. 1265 to 1259.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[308:3](sbe03067.htm#fr_341) This expression,
which occurs also in the Shû, indicates that the early Chinese believed
that their country extended to the sea, east, west, north, and south.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[308:4](sbe03067.htm#fr_342) *K*û Hsî Says he
did not understand this line; but there is ground in the Ȝo *K*wan for
our believing that *K*ing was the name of a hill in the region where the
capital of Shang was.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[308:5](sbe03067.htm#fr_343) We saw in the Shû
that the name Shang gave place to Yin after the time of Pan-kăng, B.C.
1401 to 1374. Wû-ting's reign was subsequent to that of Pan-kăng.
