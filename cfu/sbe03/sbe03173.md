#### ODE 6, STANZA 1. THE HWANG NIÂO.

#### LAMENT FOR THREE WORTHIES OF *KH*IN, WHO WERE BURIED IN THE SAME GRAVE WITH DUKE MÛ.

There is no difficulty or difference in the interpretation of this
piece; and it brings us down to B.C. 621. Then died duke Mû, after
playing an important part in the north-west of China for thirty-nine
years. The Ȝo *K*wan, under the sixth year of duke Wan, makes mention of
Mû's requiring that the three brothers here celebrated should be buried
with him, and of the composition of this piece in consequence. Sze-mâ
*Kh*ien says that this barbarous practice began with Mû's predecessor,
with whom sixty-six persons were buried alive, and that one hundred and
seventy-seven in all were buried with Mû. The death of the last
distinguished man of the House of *Kh*in, the emperor I, was
subsequently celebrated by the entombment with him of all the inmates of
his harem.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_621"></span>[443:1](sbe03173.htm#fr_641) It is difficult to
see the relation between these two allusive lines and the rest of the
stanza. Some say that it is this,--that the people loved the three
victims as they liked the birds; others that the birds among the trees
were in their proper place,--very different from the brothers in the
grave of duke Mû.

<span id="fn_622"></span>[444:1](sbe03173.htm#fr_642) This appeal to
Heaven is like what we met with in the first of the Odes of the Royal
Domain, and the eighth of those of Thang.
