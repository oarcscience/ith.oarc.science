#### ODE 3, STANZAS 1, 2, 3, 4, AND 7. THE SANG *Z*ÂU.

#### THE WRITER MOURNS OVER THE MISERY AND DISORDER OF THE TIMES, WITH A VIEW TO REPREHEND THE MISGOVERNMENT OF KING LÎ, APPEALING ALSO TO HEAVEN TO HAVE COMPASSION.

King Lî is not mentioned by name in the piece, but the second line of
stanza 7 can only be explained of him. He was driven from the throne, in
consequence of his misgovernment, in B.C. 842, and only saved his life
by flying to *K*ih, a place in the present Ho *K*âu, department
Phing-yang, Shan-hsî, where he remained till his death in B.C. 828. The
government in the meantime was carried on by the dukes of Shâo and
*K*âu, whose administration, called the period of 'Mutual Harmony,'
forms an important chronological era in Chinese history. On the
authority of a reference in the Ȝo *K*wan, the piece is ascribed to an
earl of *Z*ui.

Luxuriant is that young mulberry tree, And beneath it wide is the shade;
But they will pluck its leaves till it is quite destroyed <span
id="fr_586"></span>[1](#fn_566.md). The distress

<span id="page_418">p. 418</span>

inflicted on these (multitudes of the) people, Is an unceasing sorrow to
my heart; My commiseration fills (my breast). O thou bright and great
Heaven, Shouldest thou not have compassion on us?

The four steeds (gallop about), eager and strong <span
id="fr_587"></span>[1](#fn_567.md); The tortoise-and-serpent and the falcon
banners fly about. Disorder grows, and no peace can be secured. Every
state is being ruined; There are no black heads among the people <span
id="fr_588"></span>[2](#fn_568.md). Everything is reduced to ashes by
calamity. Oh! alas! The doom of the kingdom hurries on.

There is nothing to arrest the doom of the kingdom; Heaven does not
nourish us. There is no place in which to stop securely; There is no
place to which to go. Superior men are the bonds (Of the social
state) <span id="fr_589"></span>[3](#fn_569.md), Allowing no love of strife
in their hearts. Who reared the steps of the dissatisfaction <span
id="fr_590"></span>[4](#fn_570.md), Which has reached the present distress?

The grief of my heart is extreme, And I dwell on (the condition of) our
land. I was born at an unhappy time, To meet with the severe anger of
Heaven. From the west to the east, There is no quiet place of abiding.
Many are the distresses I meet with; Very urgent is the trouble on our
borders.

Heaven is sending down death and disorder, And}

<span id="page_419">p. 419</span>

has put an end to our king. It is (now) sending down those devourers of
the grain, So that the husbandry is all in evil case. Alas for our
middle states <span id="fr_591"></span>[1](#fn_571.md)! All is in peril and
going to ruin. I have no strength (to do anything), And think of (the
Power in) the azure vault.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_566"></span>[417:1](sbe03146.htm#fr_586.md) These three lines
are metaphorical of the once flourishing kingdom, which was now brought
to the verge of ruin.

<span id="fn_567"></span>[418:1](sbe03146.htm#fr_587.md) That is, the
war-chariots, each drawn by its team of four horses.

<span id="fn_568"></span>[418:2](sbe03146.htm#fr_588.md) The young and
able-bodied of the people were slain or absent on distant expeditions,
and only old and gray-headed men were to be seen.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[418:3](sbe03146.htm#fr_589.md) Intimating that no
such men were now to be found in office.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[418:4](sbe03146.htm#fr_590.md) Meaning the king
by his misgovernment and employment of bad men.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[419:1](sbe03146.htm#fr_591.md) We must translate
here in the plural, 'the middle states' meaning all the states subject
to the sovereign of *K*âu.
