## CHAPTER VIII. FILIAL PIETY IN GOVERNMENT.

The Master said, 'Anciently, when the intelligent kings by means of
filial piety ruled all under heaven, they did not dare to receive with
disrespect the ministers of small states;--how much less would they do
so to the dukes, marquises, counts, and barons!' Thus it was that they
got (the princes of) the-myriad states with joyful hearts (to assist
them) in-the (sacrificial) services to their royal predecessors <span

<span id="page_475">p. 475</span>

'The rulers of states did not dare to slight wifeless men and
widows;--how much less would they slight their officers and the people!
Thus it was that they got all their people with joyful hearts (to assist
them) in serving the rulers, their predecessors <span
id="fr_675"></span>[1](#fn_655.md).

'The heads of clans did not dare to slight their servants and
concubines;--how much less would they slight their wives and sons! Thus
it was that they got their men with joyful hearts (to assist them) in
the service of their parents.

'In such a state of things, while alive, parents reposed in (the glory
of) their sons; and, when sacrificed to, their disembodied spirits
enjoyed their offerings <span id="fr_676"></span>[2](#fn_656.md). Therefore
all under heaven peace and harmony prevailed; disasters and calamities
did not occur; misfortunes and rebellions did not arise.

'It is said in the Book of Poetry <span id="fr_677"></span>[3](#fn_657.md),

"To an upright, virtuous conduct  
All in the four quarters of the state render obedient homage."'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_654"></span>[474:3](sbe03188.htm#fr_674.md) Under the *K*âu
dynasty there were five orders of nobility, and the states belonging to
their rulers varied proportionally in size. There were besides many
smaller states attached to these. The feudal lords at stated times
appeared at the royal court, and one important duty which then devolved
on them was to take part in the sacrificial services of the sovereign in
the ancestral temple.

<span id="fn_655"></span>[475:1](sbe03188.htm#fr_675.md) These services
were also the sacrifices in the ancestral temples of the rulers of the
states and of the chiefs of clans,--the feudal princes and the ministers
and great officers of chapters 3 and 4.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[475:2](sbe03188.htm#fr_676.md) In the Chinese
Repository we read here:--'Parents enjoyed tranquillity while they
lived, and after their decease sacrifices were offered to their
disembodied spirits.' To the same effect P. Cibot:--'Les pères et mères
étoient heureux pendant la vie, et après leur mort leurs âmes étoient
consolées par des Tsî (sacrifices).' I believe that I have caught the
meaning more exactly.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[475:3](sbe03188.htm#fr_677.md) See the Shih, III,
iii, ode 2, stanza 2.
