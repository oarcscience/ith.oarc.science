### BOOK XV. THE ODES OF PIN.

DUKE Liû, an ancestor of the *K*âu family, made a settlement, according
to its traditions, in B.C. 1797, in Pin, the site of which is pointed
out, 90 lî to the west of the present district city of San-shui, in Pin
*K*âu, Shen-hsî, where the tribe remained till the movement eastwards of
Than-fû, celebrated in the first decade of the Major Odes of the
Kingdom, ode 3. The duke of *K*âu, during the minority of king *Kh*ăng,
made, it is supposed, the first of the pieces in this Book, describing
for the instruction of the young monarch, the ancient ways of their
fathers in Pin; and subsequently sonic one compiled other, odes made by
the duke, and others also about him, and brought them together under the
common name of 'the Odes of Pin.'
