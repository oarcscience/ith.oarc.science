## CHAPTER XV. FILIAL PIETY IN RELATION TO REPROOF AND REMONSTRANCE.

The disciple Ȝăng said, 'I have heard your instructions on the affection
of love, on respect and reverence, on giving repose to (the minds of)
our parents, and on making our name famous;--I would venture to ask if
(simple) obedience to the orders of one s father can be pronounced
filial piety.' The Master replied, 'What words are these! what words are
these! Anciently, if the Son of seven had seven ministers who would
remonstrate with him,

<span id="page_484">p. 484</span>

although he had not right methods of government, he would not lose his
possession of the kingdom; if the prince of a state had five such
ministers, though his measures might be equally wrong, he would not lose
his state; if a great officer had three, he would not, in a similar
case, lose (the headship of) his clan; if an inferior officer had a
friend who would remonstrate with him, a good name would not cease to be
connected with his character; and the father who had a son that would
remonstrate with him would, not sink into the gulf of unrighteous
deeds <span id="fr_690"></span>[1](#fn_670). Therefore when a case of
unrighteous conduct is concerned, a son must by no means keep from
remonstrating with his father, nor a minister from remonstrating with
his ruler. Hence, since remonstrance is required in the case of
unrighteous conduct, how can (simple) obedience to the orders of a
father be accounted filial piety <span id="fr_691"></span>[2](#fn_671)?'

3, 1 cannot be illustrated by examples, nor should they be insisted on.
The higher the dignity, the greater would be the risk, and the stronger
must be the support that was needed.
