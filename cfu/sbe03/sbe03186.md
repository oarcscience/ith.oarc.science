## CHAPTER VI.

## FILIAL PIETY IN THE COMMON PEOPLE.

They follow the course of heaven (in the revolving seasons); they
distinguish the advantages

afforded by (different) soils <span id="fr_668"></span>[1](#fn_648.md);
they are careful of their conduct and economical in their
expenditure;--in order to nourish their parents:--this is the filial
piety of the common people.

Therefore from the Son of Heaven down to the common people, there never
has been one whose filial piety was without its beginning and end on
whom calamity did not come.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_648"></span>[472:1](sbe03186.htm#fr_668.md) These two
sentences describe the attention of the people to the various processes
of agriculture, as conditioned by the seasons and the qualities of
different soils.

With this chapter there ends what *K*û Hsî regarded as the only portion
of the Hsiâo in which we can rest as having come from Confucius. So far,
it is with him a continuous discourse that proceeded from the sage. And
there is, in this portion, especially when we admit *K*û's expurgations,
a certain sequence and progress, without logical connexion, in the
exhibition of the subject which we fail to find in the chapters that
follow.
