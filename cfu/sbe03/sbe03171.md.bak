#### ODE 11. THE KO SHĂNG.

#### A WIFE MOURNS THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND, REFUSING TO BE COMFORTED, AND DECLARES THAT SHE WILL CHERISH HIS MEMORY TILL HER OWN DEATH.

It is supposed that the husband whose death is bewailed in this piece
had died in one of the military expeditions of which duke Hsien (B.C.
676-651) was fond. It may have been so, but there is nothing in the
piece to make us think of duke Hsien. I give it a place in the volume,
not because of the religious sentiment in it, but because of the absence
of that sentiment, Where we might expect it. The lady shows the grand
virtue of a Chinese widow, in that she will never marry again. And her
grief would not be assuaged. The days would all seem long summer days,
and the nights all long winter nights; so that a hundred long years
would seem to drag their slow course, But there is not any hope
expressed of a re-union with her husband in another state. The 'abode'
and the 'chamber' of which she speaks are to be understood of his grave;
and her thoughts do not appear to go beyond it.

The dolichos grows, covering the thorn trees; The convolvulus spreads
all over the waste <span id="fr_639"></span>[3](#fn_619.md). The

man of my admiration is no more here;--With whom can I dwell? I abide
alone.

The dolichos grows, covering the jujube trees; The convolvulus spreads
all over the tombs. The man of my admiration is no more here;--With whom
can I dwell? I rest alone.

How beautiful was the pillow of horn! How splendid was the embroidered
coverlet <span id="fr_640"></span>[1](#fn_620.md)! The man of my admiration
is no more here;--With whom can I dwell? Alone (I wait for) the morning.

Through the (long) days of summer, Through the (long) nights of winter
(shall I be alone), Till the lapse of a hundred years, When I shall go
home to his abode.

Through the (long) nights of winter, Through the (long) days of
summer(shall I be alone), Till the lapse of a hundred years, When I
shall go home to his chamber.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_619"></span>[441:3](sbe03171.htm#fr_639.md) These two lines
are taken as allusive, the speaker being led by the sight of the weak
plants supported by the trees, shrubs, and tombs, to think of her own
desolate, unsupported condition. But they may also be taken as
narrative, and descriptive of the battleground, where her husband had
met his death.

<span id="fn_620"></span>[442:1](sbe03171.htm#fr_640.md) These things had
been ornaments of the bridal chamber; and as the widow thinks of them,
her grief becomes more intense.
