### BOOK III. THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THANG.

THANG had made an end of the dynasty of Hsiâ, and returned to Po, when
he issued this Announcement, which may be considered as a solemn
inauguration of the new dynasty. He shows bow he had taken possession of
the throne in reverent submission to the will of Heaven, what
appreciation he had of the duties devolving on him, and the spirit in
which he would discharge them. In the end he calls on the princes and
the people to sympathize and co-operate with him.

1\. When the king returned from vanquishing Hsiâ and came to Po, he made
a grand announcement to the myriad regions.

2\. The king said, 'Ah! ye multitudes of the myriad regions, listen
clearly to the announcement of me, the One man <span
id="fr_103"></span>[1](#fn_99.md). The great God has conferred

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (even) on the
inferior people a moral sense, compliance with which would show their
nature invariably right.\* To make them tranquilly pursue the course
which it would indicate is the work of the sovereign.

'The king of Hsiâ extinguished his virtue, and played the tyrant,
extending his oppression over you, the people of the myriad regions.
Suffering from his cruel injuries, and unable to endure the wormwood and
poison, you protested with one accord your innocence to the spirits of
heaven and earth." The way of Heaven is to bless the good, and make the
bad miserable. It sent down calamities on (the House of) Hsiâ, to make
manifest its guilt. Therefore I, the little child, charged with the
decree of Heaven and its bright terrors, did not dare to forgive (the
criminal). I presumed to use a dark-coloured victim-bull, and, making
clear announcement to the Spiritual Sovereign in the high heavens <span
id="fr_104"></span>[1](#fn_100.md), requested leave to deal with the ruler
of Hsiâ as a criminal.\* Then I sought for the great Sage <span
id="fr_105"></span>[2](#fn_101.md), with whom I might unite my strength, to
request the favour (of Heaven) for you, my multitudes. High Heaven truly
showed its favour to the inferior people, and the criminal has been
degraded and subjected. What Heaven appoints is without
error;--brilliantly (now), like the blossoming of plants and trees, the
millions of the people show a true reviving.'\*

3\. 'It is given to me, the One man, to secure the

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

harmony and tranquillity of your states and clans and now I know not
whether I may not offend against (the Powers) above and below.\* I am
fearful and trembling, as if I were in danger of falling into a deep
abyss. Throughout all the regions that enter on a new life under me, do
not, (ye princes), follow lawless ways; make no approach to insolence
and dissoluteness; let every one be careful to keep his statutes;--that
so we may receive the favour of Heaven.\* The good in you I will not
dare to keep concealed; and for the evil in me I will not dare to
forgive myself. I will examine these things in harmony with the mind of
God.\* When guilt is found anywhere in you who occupy the myriad
regions, let it rest on me, the One man <span
id="fr_106"></span>[1](#fn_102.md). When guilt is found in me, the One man,
it shall not attach to you who occupy the myriad regions.

'Oh! let us attain to be sincere in these things, and so we shall
likewise have a (happy) consummation.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_99"></span>[89:1](sbe03019.htm#fr_103.md) 'The One man' has
occurred before, in the Songs of the Five Sons, as a designation of the
sovereign. It continues to be so to the present day.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[90:1](sbe03019.htm#fr_104.md) For 'the Spiritual
Sovereign in the high heavens,' we have in the Confucian Analects, XX,
1, professing to quote this passage, the most great and Sovereign God.'

<span id="fn_101"></span>[90:2](sbe03019.htm#fr_105.md) 'The great Sage'
must be Î Yin, Thang's chief adviser and minister, who appears
prominently in the next Book.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[91:1](sbe03019.htm#fr_106.md) There was a
tradition in the *K*âu dynasty, given with variations by Hsün-ȝze,
Sze-ma *Kh*ien, and others, which may be quoted to illustrate these
noble sentiments of Thang. For seven years after his accession to the
throne, B.C. 1766-1760, there was a great drought and famine. It was
suggested at last that some human being should be offered in sacrifice
to Heaven, and prayer made for rain. Thang said, 'If a man must be the
victim, I will be he.' He fasted; cut off his hair and nails, and in a
plain carriage, drawn by white horses, clad in rushes, in the guise of a
sacrificial victim, he proceeded to a forest of mulberry trees, and
there prayed, asking to what error or crime of his the calamity was
owing. He had not done speaking when a copious rain fell.
