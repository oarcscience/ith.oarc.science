### PIECES AND STANZAS ILLUSTRATING THE RELIGIOUS VIEWS AND PRACTICES OF THE WRITERS AND THEIR TIMES.

#### ODE 5, STANZA 1. THE FÂ MÛ.

#### THE FÂ MÛ IS A FESTAL ODE, WHICH WAS SUNG AT THE ENTERTAINMENT OF FRIENDS;--INTENDED TO CELEBRATE THE DUTY AND VALUE OF FRIENDSHIP, EVEN TO THE HIGHEST.

On the trees go the blows *k*ăng-*k*ăng; And the birds cry out
ying-ying. One issues from the dark valley, And removes to the lofty
tree. Ying goes its cry, Seeking with its voice its companion. Look at
the bird, Bird as it is, seeking with its. voice its companion; And
shall a man Not seek to have his friends? Spiritual beings will then
hearken to him <span id="fr_418"></span>[1](#fn_404.md); He shall have
harmony and peace.
