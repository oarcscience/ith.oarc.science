#### ODE 10, STANZAS 1, 5, 6, AND 7. THE KAN *Z*ANG.

#### THE WRITER DEPLORES, WITH AN APPEALING WAIL TO HEAVEN, THE MISERY AND OPPRESSION THAT PREVAILED, AND INTIMATES THAT THEY WERE CAUSED BY THE INTERFERENCE OF WOMEN AND EUNUCHS IN THE GOVERNMENT.

The king addressed in this piece was most probably Yû. It suits his
character and reign.

I look up to great Heaven, But it shows us no kindness. Very long have
we been disquieted, And these great calamities are sent down (upon us).
There is nothing settled in the country; Officers and people are in
distress. Through the insects from without and from within, There is no
peace or limit (to our misery). The net of crime is not taken up <span
id="fr_614"></span>[1](#fn_594), And there is no peace nor cure (for our
state).

Why is it that Heaven is (thus) reproving (you)? Why is it that Heaven
is not blessing (you)? You neglect your great barbarian (foes), And
regard me with hatred. You are regardless of the evil omens (that
abound <span id="fr_615"></span>[2](#fn_595)), And your demeanour is all
unseemly. (Good) men are going away, And the country is sure to go to
ruin.

Heaven is letting down its net, And many (are the calamities in it).
(Good) men are going away, And my heart is sorrowful. Heaven is letting
down

<span id="page_429">p. 429</span>

its net, And soon (all will be caught in it). (Good) men are going away,
And my heart is sad.

Right from the spring comes the water bubbling, Revealing its depth. The
sorrow of my heart,--Is it (only) of to-day? Why were these things not,
before me? Or why were they not after me? But mysteriously great Heaven
Is able to strengthen anything. Do not disgrace your great ancestors
This will save your posterity <span id="fr_616"></span>[1](#fn_596).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_594"></span>[428:1](sbe03152.htm#fr_614) By 'the net of
crime' we are to understand the multitude of penal laws, to whose doom
people were exposed. In stanza 6, Heaven is represented as letting it
down.

<span id="fn_595"></span>[428:2](sbe03152.htm#fr_615) Compare ode 9 of
the fourth decade in the former Part.

<span id="fn_596"></span>[429:1](sbe03152.htm#fr_616) The writer in
these concluding lines ventures to summon the king to repentance, and to
hold out a hope that there might come a change in their state. He does
this, believing that all things are possible with Heaven.
