#### ODE 4. THE *Z*ĂH YÜEH.

#### SUPPOSED TO BE THE COMPLAINT AND APPEAL OF *K*WANG *K*IANG, A MARCHIONESS OF WEI, AGAINST THE BAD TREATMENT SHE RECEIVED FROM HER HUSBAND.

All the Chinese critics give this interpretation of the piece. *K*wang
*K*iang was a daughter of the house of *Kh*î, about the middle of the
eighth century B.C., and was married to the marquis Yang, known in
history as 'duke *K*wang,' of Wei. She was a lady of admirable
character, and beautiful; but her husband proved faithless and unkind.
In this ode she makes her subdued moan, appealing to the sun and moon,
as if they could take cognizance of the way in which she was treated.
Possibly, however, the addressing those bodies may simply be an instance
of prosopopoeia.

O sun, O moon, Which enlighten this lower earth! Here is this man, Who
treats me not according to the ancient rule. How can he get his mind
settled? Would he then not regard me?

O sun, O moon, Which overshadow this lower earth! Here is this man, Who
will not be friendly with me. How can he get his mind settled? Would he
then not respond to me?

O sun, O moon, Which come forth from the east! Here is this man, With
virtuous words, but really not good. How can he get his mind settled?
Would he then allow me to be forgotten?

<span id="page_434">p. 434</span>

O sun, O moon, From the east that come forth! O father, O mother, There
is no sequel to your nourishing of me. How can he get his mind settled?
Would he then respond tome contrary to all reason?
