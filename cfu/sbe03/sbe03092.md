##### ODE 3. THE *K*ING *K*IH.

##### KING *KH*ĂNG SHOWS HIS SENSE OF WHAT WAS REQUIRED OF HIM TO PRESERVE THE FAVOUR OF HEAVEN, A CONSTANT JUDGE; INTIMATES HIS GOOD PURPOSES; AND ASKS THE HELP OF HIS MINISTERS TO BE ENABLED TO PERFORM THEM.

Let me be reverent! Let me be reverent! (The way of) Heaven is evident,
And its appointment

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

is not easily preserved <span id="fr_378"></span>[1](#fn_365). Let me
not say that it is high aloft above me. It ascends and descends about
our doings; It daily inspects us wherever we are.

I am a little child, Without intelligence to be reverently (attentive to
my duties); But by daily progress and monthly advance, I will learn to
hold fast the gleams (of knowledge), till I arrive at bright
intelligence. Assist me to bear the burden (of my position), And show me
how to display a virtuous conduct.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_365"></span>[330:1](sbe03092.htm#fr_378) The meaning is
this: 'The way of Heaven is very clear, to bless the good, namely, and
punish the bad. But its favour is thus dependent on men themselves, and
hard to preserve.'
