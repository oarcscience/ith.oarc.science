## CHAPTER X. AN ORDERLY DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTS OF FILIAL PIETY.

The Master said, 'The service which a filial son does to his parents is
as follows:--In his general conduct to them, he manifests the utmost
reverence; in his nourishing of them, his endeavour is to give them the
utmost pleasure; when they are ill, he feels the greatest anxiety; in
mourning for them (dead), he exhibits every demonstration of grief; in
sacrificing to them, he displays the utmost solemnity. When a son is
complete in these five things (he may be pronounced) able to serve his
parents.

'He who (thus) serves his parents, in a high situation, will be free
from pride; in a low situation, will be free from insubordination; and
among his equals, will not be quarrelsome. In a high situation pride
leads to ruin; in a low situation insubordination leads to punishment;
among equals quarrelsomeness leads to the wielding of weapons.

'If those three things be not put away, though a son every day
contribute beef, mutton, and pork <span id="fr_685"></span>[1](#fn_665.md)
to nourish his parents, he is not filial.'
