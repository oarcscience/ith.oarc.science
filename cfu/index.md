## The Chinese Classics

These are key texts of Confucianism, the traditional state religion of
feudal China. These are some of the few Chinese texts which survived a
disasterous book-burning in 213 B.C.E. by the Emperor Ch'in Shih Huang.

### <span id="cfucan">Confucian Canon.</span>

Although three of four of these books are traditionally attributed to
Confucius (K'ung-tzu, 551-479 B.C.E.) it has been established that he
did not write a single word of them; they were written down by his
students after his death. The Analects come closest to an actual
exposition of his philosophy. These works were put into their present
form by Chu Hsi in the late twelfth century C.E. These four books were
required reading in order to pass the civil service exminations,
(started in 1315), which were the gateway to employment in the Imperial
bureaucracy. The translations are by James Legge, from his 'Chinese
Classics' series. Works traditionally attributed to Confucius, but of
uncertain authorship, have an asterisk following his name.

### <span id="fivecla">The Five Classics</span>

Four of the 'Five Classics' of Chinese have survived to our day. These
are links into the above entries:

[The Shu Ching](sbe03/index.htm#section_000.md)  
The Book of Historical Records. This text describes events dating back
to the third millenium B.C.E., and was written down during the Han
dynasty (23-220 C.E.).

[The Shih Ching](sbe03/index.htm#section_007.md)  
The Book of Odes. This contains poems dating back to 1000-500 B.C.E.

[The I Ching](../ich/index.md)  
The Book of Changes. Dating to approximately 3000 B.C.E., this famous
oracular book is one of the oldest sacred texts in the world.

[The Li Ki Part I](liki/index.md)  
[The Li Ki Part II](liki2/index.md)  
The Book of Rites. This text describes Chinese religious practice from
the eighth to the fifth century B.C.E.

The fifth classic (which we don't currently have translation of at this
site) is the Spring and Autumn Annals, the Ch'un Ch'iu. There was also a
sixth classic, the Classic of Music (the Yüeh Ching), which was lost.
