#### THE MARINER'S COMPASS A CHINESE INVENTION.

The lo-pan or net tablet unquestionably serves superstitious purposes,
but we must bear in mind that much genuine science is incorporated in
many of its details, and the latter no doubt has given countenance to
the former. This again is according to the general law of the evolution
of mankind and finds its parallel in the history of European
civilisation. We must bear in mind that the great occultists of the
Middle Ages, Paracelsus. Albertus Magnus, and

men like them down to Agrippa of Nettesheim, were the most powerful
intellects of their day; and though they were deeply entangled in
mysticism, much of their life's work was devoted to the furtherance of
genuine scientific enquiry.

In the Chinese Middle Ages the leading thinkers were of the same stamp,
and so it is natural that much of genuine astronomy and the results of
accurate observation of the stars are incorporated in the lo-pan. The
most obvious part of it which must have appeared

extremely mystifying in former centuries was, as the Chinese call it,
the south-pointing needle—the mariner's compass—situated in the center
of the lo-pan.

The south-pointing needle is an ancient Chinese invention which for some
time seems to have been forgotten. Professor Friedrich Hirth of Columbia
University has privately communicated to me facts which prove that it
was employed in ancient times by travelers through the desert, that the
invention was lost and had to be rediscovered. We would add, too, that
the Chinese invention became known in Europe after the time of Marco
Polo where it was soon used as a mariner's compass. The incident is well
known and can easily be established on the testimony of literary
sources, but while sauntering through the National Museum at Washington,
the writer discovered a palpable evidence in the show cases there
exhibited, which displayed the Chinese pocket instruments containing
south-pointing needles presumably a few centuries old, side by side with
European compasses. They are of the same oblong shape and consist of two
tablets hinged in the same manner. The European instruments have
sun-dials in addition and are decidedly more serviceable for practical
use but we can not doubt that for the original idea our ancestors are
indebted to our Mongol fellow-men. <span
