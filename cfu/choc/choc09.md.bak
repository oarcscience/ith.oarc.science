#### LO-PAN.

Collectors of curios may have seen in Chinese stores the instrument
called *lo-pan* <span id="fr_35"></span>[\*](#fn_35) (net-tablet.md), or
*lo-king* <span id="fr_36"></span>[†](#fn_36) (net-standard.md), or
pan-shih <span id="fr_37"></span>[‡](#fn_37) (disk-norm.md). This is the
geomancer's compass which incorporates

the sum-total of feng-shui. The Chinese salesman who showed the
instrument at my request, a man who must have lived half his life or
more in the United States, expressed great respect for it and tried to
impress me with the fact that it contained the deepest wisdom of the
ages.

The *lo-pan* is a disk of lacquered wood, mostly of yellow color,

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

carrying in its center under glass, a small mariner's compass. Some of
the characters written in the surrounding circles are red, and some are
black. Different copies differ in details, but all are practically the
same in their general and most characteristic features. The concentric
circles of the net tablet are called *ts‘eng*, <span
id="fr_38"></span>[\*](#fn_38.md) i.e., "tiers," "stories," or "strata."

The mariner's compass in the center represents *t‘ai chih*, <span
id="fr_39"></span>[†](#fn_39.md) "the great origin." The first circle
contains the eight trigrams in the arrangement of Fuh-Hi, which denote
the eight directions of the compass and the virtues and properties
attributed to them.

The second circle contains the numerals from one to nine in the
arrangement of the magic square, the five being omitted as it belongs in
the center. Accordingly the sum of each two opposite figures always
makes ten.

The third row represents twenty-four celestial constellations, each
expressed in two characters, so that three names are registered in each
octant.

The fourth circle represents in occult terms twenty-four divisions of
the compass. Southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest are written
in their kwa names, while the rest are designated alternately by the ten
stems and twelve branches; two of the stems are omitted, however,
because referring to the element earth, they are supposed to belong in
the center. If we write the ten stems as numerals from one to ten, the
twelve branches in italic letters from a to m, and the four kwa names in
Roman capitals A to D, we have the following arrangement, beginning in
the southeast: A *f* 3 *g* 4 *h* B *i* 7 *k* 8 *l* C *m* 9 *a* 10 *b* D
*c* 1 *d* 2 *e*. This arrangement is ancient for it is quoted as an
established part of the divining method by Sze-Ma Ch‘ien in the
twenty-fifth chapter of his *Historical Records*, which is devoted to
the art of divination.

The fifth circle is divided into seventy-two parts each containing two
characters of the sexagenary cycle, written one above the other, and
arranged in groups of five divided by blank spaces. If we again express
the ten stems in figures and the twelve branches

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

in italics, the scheme (starting with the first branch *a* standing in
the north) reads as follows:

<div align="center">

In the sixth row each octant is divided into three sections, each having
five compartments in the second and fourth of which appear two
characters of the sexagenary cycle. Accordingly they are arranged in the
following order, the blanks being expressed by zeros:

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The third and
fourth stems refer to fire and the seventh and eighth to metal.

The seventh row is devoted to the eight stars of the Dipper, which in
Chinese folklore is regarded with much awe, because this most
conspicuous constellation revolves around the polar star and seems to
resemble the hand of a watch on the great celestial dial of the
universe. We must remember that the seventh star is double, its luminous
satellite being visible even without the assistance of a telescope. If
we represent the names of the eight stars by numbers from one to eight,
their arrangement beginning with the southwest is as follows: 1 8 5 7 4
4 6 2 3 1 5 7 8 1 3 2 6 6 4 7 5 8 3 2.

Beyond the seventh circle we have a double line which divides the seven
inner rows from the nine outer ones. The first of these, the eighth
circle, is divided into twelve sections each having three characters,
the central ones written in red being the sun and moon

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

together with the five elements twice repeated. Beginning in the south
with the character sun, and turning toward the left, they read as
follows: sun, moon, water, metal, fire, wood, earth, earth, wood, fire,
metal, water.

The ninth row, consisting of twelve sections, represents the twelve
branches in regular succession, beginning in the north with the first
and turning toward the right. They coincide in position with the twelve
branches as they appear in the fourth row.

The tenth row is a repetition of the fifth, with the exception that here
the characters are distributed evenly over the whole circle.

The eleventh row consists of numerals only. The circle is divided into
twelve sections, each being subdivided into five compartments which
contain the following scheme repeated twelve times:
\| 37 \| 1 \| 1 \| 5 \| 1 \| 1 \| 73 \|.

The twelfth row is inscribed with the names of the sub-divisions of the
four seasons, beginning with early spring above the unalloyed yin and
turning toward the right.

The thirteenth row is divided into seventy-two equal parts, which are
left blank.

The fifteenth row is divided into three hundred and sixty equal blanks
representing the degrees of a circle which method of division the
Chinese as well as we of the Occident have inherited from the
Babylonians.

The sixteenth row contains the names of the twenty-eight constellations
together with the number of degrees which each covers. These degrees are
specifically marked in the fourteenth circle in which the odd numbers
only are expressed. The series starting in the southeast and turning
toward the right, is as follows:
