#### DIVINATION.

An explanation of the universe which derives all distinctions between
things, conditions, relations, etc., from differences of mixture, must
have appeared very plausible to the ancient sages of China, and we
appreciate their acumen when we consider that even to-day advanced
Western scientists of reputation attempt to explain the universe as a
congeries of force-centers, acting either by attraction or repulsion in
analogy to positive and negative electricity. On the ground of this fact
the educated Chinese insist with more than a mere semblance of truth,
that the underlying idea of the Chinese world-conception is fully borne
out and justified by the results of Western science.

While it is obvious that the leading idea of the yih is quite
scientific, we observe that as soon as the Chinese thinkers tried to
apply it *a priori* without a proper investigation of cause and effect,
they abandoned more and more the abstract (and we may say, the purely
mathematical) conception of the yang and yin, fell victims to occultism,
and used the yih for divination purposes. When we compare the vagaries
of the occultism of the yih with the accomplishments

of Western science, we may feel very wise and superior, but we should
not forget that it was the same fallacious argument of wrong analogy
which produced in China the many superstitious practices of the yih, and
in the history of our civilisation, astrology, alchemy, and magic. These
pseudo-sciences were taken seriously in the world of thought throughout
the Middle Ages and began to be abolished only after the Reformation
with the rise of genuine astronomy, genuine chemistry, and genuine
nature science. If the

A DIVINATION OUTFIT.  
</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Chinese are wrong
we must remember that there was a time when we made the same mistake.

The Chinese outfit for divination consists of fifty stalks called
"divining-sticks" and six small oblong blocks to represent the
hexagrams. These blocks are not unlike children's building-blocks, but
they bear on two adjoining sides incisions dividing the oblong faces
into equal sections, so as to give the surface the appearance of a yin
figure. The sticks are made of stalks of the milfoil plant (*ptarmica
sibirica*) which is cultivated on the tomb of Confucius and regarded as
sacred.

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

Pious people consult the oracle on all important occasions. They are
first careful to make themselves clean, and then assume a calm and
reverential attitude of mind. The diviner then takes out one stick and
places it in a holder on the center of the table. This single stalk is
called "the grand limit" (*t‘ai chih*), the ultimate cause of existence.
He next lifts the forty-nine remaining sticks above his forehead with
his right hand, and divides them at random into two parts, at the same
time holding his breath and concentrating his thoughts on the question
to be answered. The sticks in the right hand are then placed on the
table, and one is taken out from them and placed between the fourth and
fifth fingers of the left hand. The three groups are now called heaven,
earth and man. The left-hand group is then counted with the right hand
in cycles of eight, and the number of the last group yields the lower
trigram of the answer, called the inner complement. This number is
counted after the oldest order of the eight trigrams, viz., that of
Fuh-Hi corresponding to the inverted binary arrangement. The upper
trigram, called the outer complement, is determined in the same way.

After the hexagram is determined, one special line is selected by the
aid of the divining-sticks in the same way as before, except that
instead of counting in cycles of eight, the diviner now counts in cycles
of six. Having thus established the hexagram and a special line in it,
he next consults the *Yih King* which contains a definite meaning for
each hexagram as a whole, and also for each single line; and this
meaning is made the basis of the divine answer.

It is obvious that this complicated process presupposes a simpler one
which, however, must have been in use in pre-historic times, for as far
as Chinese history dates back the divining stalks and the kwa system are
referred to in the oldest documents.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_13"></span>[34:21](choc02.htm#fr_13.md) Anu, Bel, and Ea are
the Sumerian trinity. The words Bel and Ea are illegible on the tablet
and have been restored by an unequivocal emendation. A doubtful word of
the tablet has been translated by "omen" which presupposes that the
translator regards the tablet as a means of divination.
