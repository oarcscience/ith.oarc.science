### LECTURE III

#### B.C. 500-300

<span class="smallcaps">Confucius</span> was born in the year 551 B.C.,
and died at the age of seventy-three, after a strenuous career, devoted
partly to politics, partly to teaching, and partly to literary research.
His own view of his life and achievements was that of a disappointed
man. On one occasion he cried out, "Alas! there is no one who knows me."
On another, he bewailed the non-appearance of the phœnix, a bird always
to be found in countries where right principles prevail; he also
complained that divine revelations, such as had occurred in the case of
the Eight Diagrams and the River Plan, were no longer vouchsafed. "It is
all over with me!" he cried in despair; for he probably believed in both
the above manifestations, and regretted that nothing of the kind had
been reserved for his own generation. Dr Legge's grand contributions to
our knowledge of the Canon are occasionally marred by comments which are
out of place in a purely exegetical work. In reference to the above, he
inserts four words: "Confucius endorses these fables"—words likely to
give great offence to a Confucianist. It is as though a Confucian
translator

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

of the Bible, when dealing with the story of Jonah and the whale, were
to add, quite unnecessarily, "Christ endorses this fable" (Matthew xii.
40). On a third occasion, Confucius said, "My doctrines make no way; I
will get upon a raft and float about on the sea."

Against these pessimistic utterances may be set the eulogy pronounced by
the historian, Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien (second and first centuries B.C.): "When
reading the works of Confucius, I have always fancied I could see the
man as he was in life; and when I went to Shantung I actually beheld his
carriage, his robes, and the instrumental parts of his ceremonial
usages. There were his descendants practising the old rites in their
ancestral home; and I lingered long, unable to tear myself away.
Countless are the princes and prophets that the world has seen in its
time; glorious in life, forgotten in death. But Confucius, though only a
humble member of the cotton-clothed masses, remains among us after many
generations. He is the model for such as would be wise. By all, from the
Son of Heaven down to the meanest student, the supremacy of his
principles is fully and freely admitted. He may indeed be pronounced the
divinest of men."

There is extant a collection of the sayings and doings of Confucius, as
recorded by his disciples, which may be compared with portions of the
four Gospels, inasmuch as we here find illustrated, sometimes vividly,
the chief points of interest in his daily life and teaching; and it is
from this source (the

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Lun Yü*) that
some of the quotations to follow have been taken.

Confucius is usually regarded as a teacher of morals only, and it is
considered wrong, therefore, to class his doctrines as a religion. This
is no doubt true, in the sense that he laid stress almost entirely upon
man's duty to his neighbour, thinking, perhaps without going so very far
astray, that the liver of a blameless life would not be far from the
kingdom of God. But it is certain that he believed firmly in a higher
Power—the God of his fathers, of whom we have already heard so much, and
who, so far as we can deduce from the ancient records, was satisfied
with right-doing on the part of mankind in reference to one another, and
in other ways was less exacting than the "jealous God" of the Old
Testament. Not only did Confucius, as we shall shortly see, believe in
the existence of this Deity, more vaguely perhaps than did the
anthropomorphic worshippers of early times; but he was conscious, and
expressed his consciousness openly, that in his teachings he was working
under divine guidance. Thus when, on his wanderings, he found himself in
danger of violence, and his disciples were afraid, he reassured them,
saying, "King Wên (see *ante*) being dead, has not his message been
confided to me? If God had wished to put an end to this message, then I,
King Wên's successor, should never have received it; but as God has not
yet put an end to this message, what harm can these people do to me?" In
another and similar case of danger, Confucius said, "God implanted

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

the virtue that is in me; what can this man do to me?" Again, in reply
to a disciple who asked what he meant by declaring, as just mentioned,
that nobody knew him, Confucius said, "I do not murmur against God, nor
do I grumble against man. My studies lie low, but they reach high; and
there is God—He knows me. If my doctrines are to prevail, it is so
ordered of God; if they are to fail, it is so ordered of God."

Nor was it only Confucius himself who held this view as to the divine
character of his mission. After throwing up high office in his own
native State of Lu, because his prince had accepted a present of eighty
(one writer says only six) beautiful dancing-girls and was neglecting
the administration of affairs, Confucius in a dejected mood set out on
his travels. On arriving at the frontier of the Wei State, the warden in
charge of the gate expressed a wish to meet the renowned sage, urging
that when men of mark passed that way he was never denied the privilege
of seeing them. He was accordingly introduced by the disciples; and when
he came out he said, "My friends, why are you distressed by your
Master's loss of office? The world has long been without right
doctrines; now God is going to use him as a bell."

On a different plane, but still suggestive of something unusual in the
personality of Confucius, is the following anecdote. Travelling along in
a carriage, with a disciple in attendance, he came to a river, and sent
the disciple to a couple of men working in the

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

fields, in order to inquire for the ford. One of the men asked the
disciple, "Who is that sitting in the carriage and holding the reins?"
"It is Confucius," answered the disciple. "What! Confucius of the Lu
State?" "Yes," replied the disciple. "Ah," said the man, speaking
figuratively, "he knows the ford."

We must now see how far it is possible, using only genuine and not
apocryphal utterances, to establish more conclusively the fact that
Confucius fully recognized the existence of a Supreme Being. This
recognition was indeed qualified by the maxim, already quoted, which he
laid down for the guidance of others, namely, "Hear much, and put aside
the points of which you are in doubt, while you also speak cautiously on
the rest"; for there were four special subjects on which he himself
would not willingly talk—uncanny manifestations, feats of strength,
rebellion, and spiritual beings. But although he would not discuss in a
familiar way the pros and cons of belief in an unseen world, probably
because of the solemnity of the subject, he did not hesitate to use the
name of the Deity in any suitable connexion. He does so when tracing the
stages of his own career:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">At fifteen, my mind was bent on learning.  
At thirty, I stood firm.  
At forty, I had no doubts.  
At fifty, I knew the will of God.  
At sixty, I could trust my ears.  
At seventy, I could follow my heart's desires, without
transgression.</span>

</div>

A disciple being stricken with leprosy, Confucius went to inquire after
him. He did not go into the

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

house, but grasped the sick man's hand through the window, saying,
"Alas! it is the will of God."

What was that which Confucius describes as the will of God, about which
we are told in one passage that he did not care to speak? The word
*ming*, here rendered by "will," or "command," also means "fate,
destiny"; and there would be a serious claim for some such translation
as "necessity" (Gr. ἀνάγκη), if ming were always found, as it is
sometimes found, used alone, without the prefix of "God" (*T‘ien ming*).
The "necessity" of Greek philosophers has been defined as "a constraint
conceived as a law prevailing throughout the material universe and
within the sphere of human action"; it is never associated with any
lawgiver, but proceeds from the natural constitution of things. It is
quite clear, however, that whenever ming stands by itself in the ancient
classical literature of China, it is elliptical for *T‘ien ming*, the
will, or decree, of God understood; just as, with us, the Word stands
for Christ, the Messiah, known to the Jews as the Word of God.

There is one example which seems, but only seems, to militate against
the above conclusion. A disciple mentions the following saying, which he
states that he has heard, as some conjecture, from the lips of
Confucius: "Life and death have their *ming*; riches and honours are in
the hands of God." Now the first sentence looks as though it were "Life
and death are matters of destiny"; that is, that they are events
predetermined by the mysterious power or agency, not God, which we call
Destiny or Fate. But here

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

allowance must be made for the peculiarities of Chinese style, in which
repetition is a common feature; not to mention that such a distribution
of functions is quite out of the question—that is, the power of life and
death being given to an abstraction, the disposition of such comparative
trifles as wealth and honours to God. Therefore here, too, *ming* must
stand for the will of God.

We will now pass on to the other frequent instances of the use by
Confucius of the term "God," the Chinese equivalent being in every case
*T‘ien*, and not *Shang Ti*. Confucius went to pay a visit to a lady
whose moral character did not stand high in public estimation. A
disciple ventured to remonstrate with him for having done so; whereupon
Confucius cried out with an oath, "If I have done anything wrong, may
God strike me dead, may God strike me dead!"

The Golden Age of China, with its perfectly virtuous, semi-divine
rulers, threw a lasting spell over the imagination of Confucius. It may
partly have been a case of distance lending enchantment, for some of the
great Emperors of antiquity lived as long before his date as Confucius
himself lived before ours; to us they are dimly seen, legendary beings,
but to him they were moving, sentient heroes, drawing inspiration from
on high. "Great indeed," he exclaims, "as a ruler, was the Emperor Yao;
how majestic was he!" Then, in an afterthought, comes the reverential
corrective: "It is only God who is really great: Yao took Him as his
model."

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

Confucius being very ill, one of the disciples, named Yu, wished his
colleagues to pretend to be officials in attendance, in order to create
a similitude of the state to which the Master had been accustomed in the
days when he held high office. But all Yu got for his trouble was to be
rated, so soon as Confucius could speak, as an arrant hypocrite. " By
pretending to have an official retinue," said Confucius, "when I have no
such thing, upon whom should I impose? Should I impose upon God?"

Confucius had one favourite disciple, named Hui, who leaned upon him
more than any of the others, and was never at any time a doubter or
questioner of his Master's wisdom and divine mission. Of him Confucius
said that for three months there would be nothing in his mind contrary
to perfect virtue; that with a coarse platter of food, a gourd to drink
out of, and a slum to live in—which would mean wretchedness to
others—Hui would still be contented and happy; that he never let the sun
go down upon his wrath (*cf*. Ephesians iv. 26); and was never twice
guilty of the same lapse in conduct. But Hui died young, and in his
grief Confucius cried out, "God is destroying me! God is destroying me!"
At this the disciples who were with him remonstrated, saying, "Master,
your grief is excessive." "My grief excessive?" cried Confucius. "If I
am not to mourn bitterly for this man, for whom should I mourn?"

"There are three things," said Confucius, of which the superior man
stands in awe. He stands in awe of the will of God. He stands in awe of
great

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

sages, and of the inspired words which have been uttered by such men."
It was the dream of Confucius that all mankind should be composed of
superior men, which makes it difficult for us to believe that he himself
was, as he has been called too often, a mere moral philosopher, a
materialist of the most pronounced type.

One more example of *T‘ien* as understood by Confucius. He was
protesting against the value of words as compared with deeds, and was
applying the rule to his own individual case, when a disciple objected,
saying, "If you, Master, do not speak, what shall we, your disciples,
have to record?" Confucius said, "Does God speak? The four seasons
pursue their courses, and all things are regularly produced; but does
God say anything?"

We will now transfer our attention more closely to the "spirits," which,
as we have already seen, play such an important part in the earlier
books of the Confucian Canon. From the sources available, it seems
impossible to decide whether the recognition of a Supreme Being preceded
or followed the belief that the souls of human beings enjoy continued
existence after death. In regard to the relative importance of serving
God and serving man, Confucius has often been blamed for setting man
before God; but it should always be remembered that his interpretation
of true service to God was embodied in right and proper performance of
duty to one's neighbour. The idea of personal service to God Himself, as
understood by the Jewish patriarchs, is

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

entirely foreign to the Chinese conception of a Supreme Being.

Thus, when asked what constituted wisdom, Confucius replied, "To
cultivate earnestly our duty towards our neighbour, and to reverence
spiritual beings while maintaining always a due reserve, <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md) may be called wisdom."

Again, when a disciple applied for guidance in serving the spirits of
the dead, Confucius said, "Until you are able to serve men, how can you
expect to serve their spirits?" The same questioner would have heard the
Master's views on death; but Confucius said, "Until you understand life,
how can you possibly understand death?"

We have, however, some interesting remarks on the supernatural world,
which Confucius himself volunteered, without any pressure from an
inquirer. "How abundantly," he said, "do spiritual beings make their
presence manifest among us! We look for them, but do not see them; we
listen for them, but do not hear them; yet they enter into all things,
and there is nowhere where they are not. They cause all the people in
the world to fast, and to put on their best clothes, in order to take
part in the sacrifices. Then they seem to pass in waves, now over the
heads, now at the very sides of the worshippers." In support of this,
Confucius here quotes three lines from the Odes, his hearers being, of
course,

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

able to supply the context from memory. They are taken from an ode which
was written about the close of the ninth century B.C., by one of the
feudal princes, and which was, quaintly enough, addressed to himself, as
a means of keeping before his eyes the right conduct expected from one
in his high station. Some of the lines which lead to the quotation used
by Confucius run as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Shall not those of whom Almighty God does not
approve,*  
*Surely as water flows down from a spring,*  
*Sink down together to ruin?*  
*Rise early and go to bed late;*  
*Sprinkle and sweep your courtyard,*  
*So as to be a pattern to your people.*  
*Have in good order your chariots and horses,*  
*Your bows and arrows, your weapons of war,*  
*So as to be prepared for warlike action.*  
*Be cautious in what you say;*  
*Be careful in what you do.*  
*A flaw in a piece of white jade*  
*May be ground away;*  
*But for a flaw in speech*  
*Nothing can be done.*  
*As seen in your friendship with good men,*  
*Your expression is conciliatory and kindly;*  
*You are anxious to do no wrong.*  
*As seen in your private chamber,*  
*You should also be free from shame.*  
*Do not say, "This place is not public;*  
*No one can see me here."</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And now come the
three lines quoted by Confucius:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The advent of spiritual beings  
Cannot be known beforehand;  
All the less, then, should they be slighted.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

If Confucius cannot be held to have spoken freely on the topic of
spirits, at any rate he expanded somewhat in reference to the sacrifices
of which spirits were the immediate object. We are told that he
sacrificed to his dead ancestors as though those ancestors were present,
and to spirits in general as though the spirits were present. He would
not allow himself to be represented by proxy. "I regard," he said, "my
absence from the ceremony as though I did not sacrifice." At the great
sacrifice to the founder of the dynasty, which must have been a
particularly solemn ceremony, Confucius said that after the pouring of
the libation he had no wish to look on. It was at that moment, when the
imagination of fervent worshippers was most powerfully stimulated, that
the surrounding atmosphere, laden with the fumes of incense, seemed to
be peopled, as it were, with spirits whose presence, if not seen, was
unmistakably felt. From this atmosphere Confucius, for reasons which
have not come down to us, wished to withdraw. Someone having asked him
what was the meaning of the great sacrifice, Confucius replied, "I do
not know. The man who knew its meaning would find it as easy to govern
the empire as to look upon the palm of his hand." After what has been
already quoted from his remarks on the influence of a spirit-world, it
is impossible that he can have been actuated, in his wish not to look
on, by unbelief. Perhaps he was overwhelmed by that same reverential
feeling which prevented him from speaking on death and cognate subjects;
that must remain for ever a matter

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

of speculation. But just as it is obvious that Confucius believed in a
God, so it is also obvious that he believed in the existence, and, on
occasions, in the presence of spirits of the departed dead.

To go back a little, chronologically. The ruler of a certain feudal
State, after petitioning God and receiving His sanction, determined
(B.C. 648) for political reasons to hand over his territory to another
State, and was explaining to a friend that the State about to absorb his
own would keep up the proper sacrifices to his spirit after death. The
friend remonstrated with him, saying, "I have heard that the spirits of
the dead do not enjoy the sacrifices of those who are not of their
kindred, and that people only sacrifice to those who are of the same
ancestry as themselves. Will not, then, the sacrifices to your spirit be
thus brought to an abrupt end?" This argument prevailed, and the
principle enunciated was accepted and emphasized by Confucius, who
declared that "for a man to sacrifice to a spirit which does not belong
to him is flattery," and not legitimate worship. Temptations, however,
are sometimes too strong for weak mortals. A Chinese merchant was
discovered, not long ago, worshipping, with all the paraphernalia of
eatables, wine, and paper money, at the grave of a recently deceased
foreigner, his partner in trade; and he explained in pidgin-English that
the dead man was an old friend, and that he hoped by the performance of
this "joss-pidgin" to enlist the aid of his spirit in business
transactions to come.

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

Among casual allusions by Confucius to sacrificial ceremonies, one or
two are of more than passing interest. We are told that "when a friend
sent him a present, though it might be a carriage and horses, he did not
bow." The only present for which he bowed was that of flesh which had
been used in sacrifice, and so consecrated by its dedication to the
ancestral spirits of the giver. If his prince sent him a gift of cooked
meat, he would straighten his mat before sitting down, and be the first
to taste it. If the gift was raw flesh, he would have it cooked, and
then offer it in sacrifice to the spirits of his own ancestors. The rule
was that the oxen used at the great sacrifice should be red, and have
good horns, qualifications which depended, we may take it, upon the
pedigree of the animal. Thus, in reference to one of his most ardent
disciples, who was the son of a bad father, Confucius pleaded as
follows: "If the calf of a brindled cow be itself red and well horned,
although men may not wish to use it, would the spirits of mountains and
rivers put it aside?" The sins of the fathers were not to be visited
upon the children.

It was customary in ancient China for the Emperor, at the end of each
year, to distribute among the princes calendars showing the first day of
each moon in the ensuing year. These were kept in the ancestral temple
of the State; and on the first of every one of the following twelve
moons they were brought out and the day was proclaimed, suggesting a
comparison with the Latin word *Kalendae*, which meant the day

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

when the order of days was proclaimed. To the ceremony of proclamation
was attached the sacrifice of a sheep; and as the ceremony was beginning
to be laxly observed, a disciple recommended that the sacrifice should
be done away with. "My son," said Confucius, "you grudge the sheep; I
grudge the sacrifice."

Confucius, when staying in the Wei State, was consulted by its ruler as
to a military expedition which was about to be undertaken. He replied,
"Matters which are concerned with sacrificial ceremonies are those with
which I am familiar; as to military affairs, I know nothing about them."
He then ordered his chariot and promptly quitted a territory where the
arts of peace were to be subordinated to the art of war. "A bird," he
exclaimed, "chooses the tree upon which it will roost; the tree does not
choose the bird."

In the intimate conversations of Confucius with his disciples we do not
come across any direct reference to divination; but from an essay
composed by his grandson and disciple we learn that the reeds and the
tortoise-shell were still employed, as we have already seen. We find
allusions to fasting, which is mentioned, together with war and
sickness, as one of three topics in regard to which Confucius exercised
the greatest caution. We are told that "when fasting, he made a point of
wearing clean clothes, always of linen cloth; he did not eat the same
food as usual, nor would he sit in his accustomed place." It appears
that fasting and purification were practised for about ten days before
the performance of the

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

sacrifices took place, but few reliable details of these rites have been
handed down to us.

A word or two as to prayer, and its importance in the eyes of Confucius.
Someone took occasion to ask him what was the interpretation of a vulgar
proverb, which may be paraphrased as follows: "It is better to make
friends with the kitchen than with the parlour," in allusion to the
prayers and sacrifices offered to the spirit of the kitchen, and the
greater likelihood of obtaining profit in that direction than from the
more dignified spirit of the parlour. There was a political background
to the question, which is of no consequence at the moment; all that we
need trouble about is the answer. Confucius swept these petty rites
aside, with the insignificant spirits, whom he evidently did not hold in
the highest esteem, and, falling back on an older and loftier conception
of man's guidance, replied, "He who has offended against God has none to
whom he can pray."

Confucius being at another time very ill, a disciple asked leave to pray
for him. "Is that usual?" he inquired. "It is," replied the disciple.
"The Book of Prayer says, 'Pray to the spirits in heaven above and earth
below.'" "In that case," said Confucius, "I have already been praying
for a long time."

The question of mourning, as a rite, received some attention from
Confucius. "Just as in festive ceremonies," he said, "it is better to be
sparing than extravagant, so in mourning ceremonies it is better to be
sincere than punctilious." Again: "Authority without mercy, ceremonial
without reverence, mourning

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

without sorrow—what have I to do with these?" His general attitude
towards mourning and mourners was one of awe at finding himself in
proximity to death and the unknown. We have it on record that "when the
Master was eating by the side of a mourner, he never ate to repletion."
Also: "When the Master saw a person in mourning garb, or a blind man,
even though they were younger than himself, he would rise up; and if he
had to pass them by, he would do so hastily." It was this same
reverential feeling, and not fear, which caused him to turn pale at a
clap of thunder, or in the presence of a hurricane. At that early date
the thunderbolt was not regarded as one of the means at the disposal of
the Almighty for punishing the derelictions of erring mortals. Time and
superstition have succeeded in developing the modern god of thunder who,
accompanied by a goddess, goes about dealing destruction to the wicked.
The goddess holds in her hand a bright mirror, with which she flashes a
ray of lightning on to the doomed man, so that the god of thunder may
see where to launch his bolt.

It has always been the rule in China to wear mourning for parents,
nominally for a space of three years, actually for twenty-seven months.
Attempts to shorten this trying period have been made, but without
success. An Emperor of the second century B.C. asked with his dying
breath that the people might not be forced to observe the very
inconvenient ceremonies of national mourning prescribed upon a demise of
the throne, but be allowed to marry and

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

give in marriage as usual, thus not wasting too much energy on such an
unworthy creature as himself. Only those who have witnessed a national
mourning under the Manchus can have any idea of the hardships entailed
on the masses by the death of an Emperor, although the length of time
imposed by regulation was nothing like three years in duration. Still,
for a hundred days no one might have his head shaved; and the barbers,
but for the patriarchal system, would have starved. No marriages could
be solemnized within a year; and during the same period large troupes of
actors were thrown out of employ, for all theatres were closed.
Festivities and music were altogether prohibited. On the death of a
parent, an official was compelled, except for a special dispensation
from the Emperor, to go into retirement for the full term of
twenty-seven months.

A disciple asked Confucius about the three years’ mourning for parents,
saying that one year was surely long enough. "If the superior man," he
argued, "abstains for three years from ceremonial observances, those
observances will be quite lost. If for three years he abstains from
music, there will be an end to music. Every year we have new grain
taking the place of the old grain which is exhausted, and once every
year (a ceremony at the winter solstice) we produce a fresh supply of
fire. One year, therefore, should be enough." On this Confucius said,
"If, after only a year's mourning, you were to eat good food and wear
embroidered clothes, would you feel happy?" "I should," replied the
disciple. "Well

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

then," said Confucius, "if you can feel happy, do it. But a superior
man, while in mourning, will not enjoy dainty food, nor take pleasure in
music, nor even rest in comfort; therefore he does not do it. Your case
is different." When the disciple had withdrawn, Confucius said, "He is
lacking in right feeling. It is not until a child is three years old
that it can do without the arms of its parents; therefore the three
years’ period of mourning is universally observed throughout the
empire."

A Confucian dogma, often attributed to Confucius, and also with more
reason to Mencius, who, as we shall see, was its chief exponent, asserts
that all men are born good. This is in direct antagonism to that
Christian dogma which is based upon the fall of man as related in the
book of Genesis, and teaches that the imagination of man's heart is evil
from his youth (ch. viii. 21). The germ, however, of the Chinese view is
much older than Confucius. It is found in the Odes; and the utmost we
can really claim is that Confucius accepted any and all of the doctrines
in the work which passed through his hands as editor. For he once said
to his disciples, "My children, why do you not study the Odes? They
stimulate the mind. They teach observation. They warn against hatred.
From them you learn, at home, to serve your father, abroad, to serve
your prince; from them you can also learn the names of many birds,
beasts, and plants." He one day asked his son, "Have you learnt the
Odes?" and on receiving the answer, "Not yet," proceeded to say that
until the young man had done so,

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

he would not be fit for polite society. On another occasion he said,
"The Odes consist of three hundred poems, and the gist of them all may
be summed up in a word: Have no impure thoughts." We therefore seem to
be justified in concluding that Confucius accepted the dogma, "Man is
born good." The particular verse in the Odes which bears out the
statement that Confucius was not the originator of the dogma in
question, runs as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">How great is God,  
The ruler of men below!  
How arrayed in terrors is God!  
Yet His will is often disregarded.  
God created the myriad people,  
Yet His ordinances are not relied upon.  
All men are good at birth,  
But not many remain so to the end.</span>

</div>

It is probable that few tasks will be found so impracticable as the
effort to wean the Chinese people, soaked, so to speak, in the authority
of centuries, from this belief in the natural goodness of mankind, to
another belief, in exactly opposite terms, which peoples this world with
successive generations of little children born in sin. <span
id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md)

This doctrine of original purity, coupled with the practice of ancestral
worship, together form an important cleavage, not easy to be bridged
over, between Christianity and Confucianism. Points of contact, however,
between these two religions, if I may now

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

be allowed to apply this term equally to both, are many and striking.
The two following examples can scarcely be ignored. (1) When asked by a
disciple for a rule of life, Confucius replied, "Do not unto others what
you would not they should do unto you." Attempts have been made to
minimize the value of this maxim, which is, of course, identical with
that enunciated by Christ and known as the Golden Rule, on the ground
that it is in a negative form, and therefore not of such direct force.
But the fallacy of this position may be shown in a few words. What you
would not wish men to do to you, would be to abstain from helping you
when in trouble. Do not therefore abstain from helping others when they
are in trouble; in other words, do help them. (2) Another disciple
having asked for an explanation of the Chinese term for "charity of
heart" (*cf*. 1 Cor. xiii.), Confucius replied, "Love one another!"

The more practical character of Confucianism as contrasted with
Christianity is abundantly manifest. Confucius was entirely in sympathy
with human weaknesses, and did not put man's faith to too severe a test.
He would have echoed such sentiments as "He that is without sin among
you, let him first cast a stone"; but such poetical commands as to turn
the other cheek to the smiter, or to give up your cloke to the enemy who
has just succeeded in obtaining your coat, would find no place in his
teachings. On the other hand, his concessions to humanity may be
regarded by some as stretching the gift of charity of heart to breaking
point. For instance, he declared

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

that a man who should be without reproach in regard to the main
principles of human conduct, might fairly be excused any lapses in
regard to smaller issues, which seems to traverse Christ's declaration,
"He that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much." Again, one of
the feudal princes was boasting to Confucius of the high level of
morality which prevailed in his own State. "Among us here," he said,
"you will find upright men. If a father has stolen a sheep, his son will
give evidence against him." "In my part of the country," replied
Confucius, there is a different standard from this. A father will shield
his son, and a son will shield his father. It is thus that uprightness
will be found."

There is in Chinese a word which is used of Confucius and of three or
four of the other great men of remote antiquity, such as the Emperors
Yao and Shun. It signifies a human being who, by the grace of God, is
divinely good and intuitively wise, and therefore an infallible exponent
of right and wrong. Our nearest English equivalent is perhaps
"inspired." Confucius himself discusses the term (*Chung Yung*, xx.) as
follows: "Truth is that which God is, and man attains to. He who is an
embodiment of truth hits his mark without taking aim, apprehends without
thought, and naturally and easily strikes the right path. Such a man is
inspired." Confucius disclaimed any right to this exalted title,
although, as we have seen, he did at times regard himself as an
instrument of the Almighty. He says in one passage (*Lun Yü*, vii.), "As
for the inspired

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

man and the man of perfect charity of heart, how dare I rank myself with
them? It may simply be said of me, that I strive to become such without
satiety, and to teach others without weariness." What his disciples
thought of their Master may be gathered from a few extracts which they
have left behind them. A spiteful man having said that a certain one of
the disciples was greater than Confucius, on the remark coming to his
ears, that disciple said, "Let us think in terms of houses with walls
round them. My wall reaches only to the shoulders. You can peep over it
and see the pleasant arrangement within. Now, my Master's wall is many
feet in height; and unless you go in by the door, you cannot see the
ancestral temple with all its beauties and the various officers in rich
array. But few are those," he added, "who find that door."

One more testimonial from a similar source (*Chung Yung*, xxxi.).
"All-embracing and vast, Confucius is like the sky. Deep-centred, he is
like the abyss. He appears, and the people all revere him; he speaks,
and the people all believe him. Therefore his fame overspreads the
Middle Kingdom, and extends to the barbarous tribes. Wherever ships and
carriages reach; wherever the strength of man penetrates; wherever the
sky covers and the earth supports; wherever the sun and moon shine;
wherever frosts and dews fall—all who have blood and breath unfeignedly
love and honour him. Hence it is said, He is the peer of God."

After the death of the Master, the torch of

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Confucianism was
handed on chiefly by his grandson and disciple, K‘ung Chi, whose famous
essay, known as the Doctrine of the Mean (*Chung Yung*), has been
already quoted. With this essay, which traces the ruling motives of
human conduct to a psychological source, we are not now concerned. It
contains, however, a couplet from the Odes, with the writer's own
exegesis, which may perhaps be worth recording.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The will of God is manifested  
In wondrous and ceaseless ways!</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This means, says
K‘ung Chi, that "what God does, that is God"—a remarkable statement with
which may be compared Aristotle's conception of God as ἐνέργεια,
existence in action, or *actus purus*. <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md)

While fully recognizing the sincerity and value of the efforts of the
earlier disciples to keep alight what was to them the sacred flame of
Confucianism, it must be freely admitted that the firm hold which these
doctrines took upon the imagination of the Chinese people, and which has
been maintained with extraordinary persistence through some twenty-three
centuries past, would never have been brought about but for the genius
and labours of Mencius, who now enjoys the title of the Second Inspired
One, bestowed upon him in A.D. 1330. Born almost exactly a century after
the death of Confucius, he devoted his life to the glorification of
Confucianism; and if he ventured to lead his hearers into new lines of
thought, the foundations on which these lines rested were always to be
found in the bed-rock laid by his

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Master. Confucius,
as we have seen, dealt principally with lofty moral precepts and their
practical application to everyday life. Mencius went further afield and
handled political and economical problems with the object of securing
national right conduct through the medium of national prosperity. No one
pretends that he reached the high level on which Confucianism was
established; but he is honoured for what he did towards consolidating
that establishment, by teaching and preaching throughout his life its
supremacy over all other forms of doctrine. He might indeed be regarded
as the St Paul of Confucianism, were it not that he handed on the creed
of the Founder in all its native simplicity and beauty, without addition
or garnish of any kind. There is no such thing as Mencian Confucianism,
to correspond to Pauline Christianity.

Let us see what Mencius has to say about God, omitting those references
which are merely quotations from the Odes or the Canon of History. One
of the feudal princes consulted him as to the best method of dealing
with neighbouring States, so as to ensure the continuance of friendly
intercourse. Mencius replied that if it was a case of furthering the
interests of a less powerful State, then perfect charity of heart would
be necessary to the ruler of the more powerful State, in order to secure
the proper treatment of his weaker neighbour. On the other hand, if it
was a case of furthering the interests of a more powerful State, then
perfect wisdom would be necessary to the ruler of the less powerful
State, in order to achieve a

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

satisfactory result. "For the ruler of a powerful State," said Mencius,
"who furthers the interests of a weaker State, is one who loves God
(*T‘ien*); and the ruler of a weak State who furthers the interests of a
more powerful State, is one who fears God. He who loves God will be a
protector of the whole empire; he who fears God will protect his own
State."

Allusions to the will of God are frequent. The capture of a city, or the
continuance of a princely line are alike dependent upon the will of God.
Calamities and blessings are traced to the same source. "When the empire
is well governed," says Mencius, "right prevails, and good men triumph
over the wicked; when it is badly governed, might prevails, and the
strong triumph over the weak. Such are the dispensations of God; but
those who obey God are saved, while those who disobey perish."

In one instance, Mencius quotes a statesman (I Yin) who flourished in
the eighteenth century before Christ, and who is reported to have said,
"When God created mankind, His plan was that those who possessed
intuitive wisdom should enlighten those who were capable only of
acquiring wisdom; and that those who possessed intuitive enlightenment
should enlighten those who were capable only of acquiring
enlightenment." This must mean that God conveyed His will by means of
chosen vessels, that is, inspired men, or prophets.

Mencius held that all earthly honours came not from man, but from God.
The prince was the

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

apparent source, but really only the agent of the Almighty, entrusted
with the task of discovering and rewarding virtuous men. Borrowing
examples from antiquity, such as Shun, the ploughman-Emperor, he further
shows that "when God is about to confer a great office on any man, He
first chastens that man's mind with suffering, and his sinews and bones
with toil. He exposes that man's body to hunger, and subjects him to
extreme poverty. He confounds that man's undertakings; and by these
methods stimulates his mind, softens his nature, and supplies his
deficiencies." Just so we read in Revelation iii. 19, "As many as I
love, I rebuke and chasten."

"Everything depends," says Mencius, "upon the will of God; therefore a
man should accept submissively whatever can properly be ascribed thereto
(*ut melius quicquid erit pati*). He who understands what is meant by
the will of God will not place himself under a tottering wall. Death in
the discharge of one's duties may properly be ascribed to the will of
God; but death in gyves and fetters cannot be so ascribed."

Still upholding the belief in an anthropomorphic God, as described in
our first lecture, Mencius taught that man was created in God's own
image. "Our physical bodies," he said, "in regard to shape and
appearance, are of the nature of God; but a man must be divinely
inspired before he can adequately sustain that nature." Man's mental and
moral qualifications, too, did not, according to Mencius, reach him by
chance, but were specially conferred.

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Confucius had said
that in choosing a dwelling-place, a wise man would be chiefly attracted
by the prevalence of a charitable spirit among those who would be his
immediate neighbours. On this, Mencius comments: "Charity of heart is
the noblest gift of God; it is a house, so to speak, in which a man may
live in peace. No one can prevent us from possessing this gift; if we
have it not, that is due to our own folly." Again, Mencius says, "There
are dignities of God, and there are dignities of man. Charity of heart,
duty towards one's neighbour, loyalty, and truth—these are the dignities
of God. To be a duke, a minister of State, or a high official—these are
the dignities of man. The men of old cultivated the dignities of God,
and the dignities of man followed. The men of to-day cultivate the
dignities of God in order to secure the dignities of man; and when they
have obtained the dignities of man, they cast aside all further thought
of the dignities of God. In this they greatly err, and the probability
is that they will lose their dignities of man as well." Referring again
to charity of heart, the first and most powerful of all the Confucian
virtues, Mencius gives an interesting similitude. "Charity of heart," he
says, "subdues uncharitableness just as water subdues fire. But people
nowadays employ charity of heart much in the same way as if they were to
try to put out a blazing cartload of firewood with a single cupful of
water; and then when they fail to put out the flames, they turn round
and blame the water."

The term used for God by Mencius is *T‘ien*; there

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

is only one instance of his use of the alternative *Shang Ti*. It occurs
in the following rather curious sentence: "If a great beauty were to
appear in a foul and filthy head-dress, people would all hold their
noses when passing her. If a leper were to fast, abstain from wine, and
purify himself by a bath, he might be allowed to sacrifice to God." In
every other case we find *T‘ien*, the term which supplies the
anthropomorphic figure of the Supreme Being. Thus, we have *T‘ien* when
Mencius declares it to be one of the joys of the superior man, that
looking up, he has no occasion for shame before God, and looking down,
he has no occasion to blush before men."

We have seen that the belief in the existence of spirits finds its first
expression in the worship of ancestors. In the presence of death,
primeval man in China must have sought for some explanation of the body,
just now full of life and movement, then, suddenly, an inert mass. Aided
by dreams, in which the dead so often reappear, he must gradually have
come to regard the body as matter informed by a vital essence, the
separation of which produced the phenomenon of death. As time went on, a
spirituality associated with thunder, wind, rain, rivers, trees, and
mountains, gradually crystallized into beings susceptible of
propitiation and able to confer benefits upon mankind.

"Wherever the superior man passes," says Mencius, "he civilizes; and he
leaves behind him an atmosphere of spirituality;" that is, an influence
of a divine character,

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

with a tendency to spread far and wide. In another passage we come
almost into touch with the unseen. After showing the steps which lead up
to real goodness, Mencius says, "A great and good man who exercises a
civilizing influence is called an inspired man. An inspired man whose
personality transcends our knowledge is a spirit." It is difficult to
say precisely what this last sentence means; the reference is apparently
to a class of celestial beings, inferior to the Deity, but possessed of
supernatural power; approximately, angels.

Among those spirits whose development seems to have followed most
closely upon the recognition by the people at large of a Supreme Being,
must be mentioned the tutelary spirits of the land and of grain. In this
connexion, there is a remarkable statement by Mencius, illustrating a
well-known attitude of primitive peoples towards their gods or fetishes,
which are so often discarded when found to be inefficient. "The people,"
said Mencius, "are of the first importance; the spirits of the land and
grain come next; the sovereign is of less account. If a prince abuses
his position in regard to the spirits of the land and grain (that is, if
he is a bad ruler), he is deposed and another is put in his place. On
the other hand, if the sacrificial victims have been perfect, the
sacrificial grain clean, and the sacrifices offered at the proper
season;—then, if a drought should follow, or a flood, the spirits of the
land and grain would be deposed and others put in their places."

No utterances of Mencius are of more importance,

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

or have been cherished with more reverence, than those arguments by
which he supported and finally established the Confucian dogma that the
nature of man at his birth is pure and free from evil. These arguments,
together with those of his opponents, I propose to submit in my next
lecture. There is, however, one statement on man's nature with which I
will now conclude. Mencius said, "He who brings all his intellect to
bear on the subject, will come to understand his own nature; he who
understands his own nature will understand God. To preserve one's
intellect, and to nourish one's nature—that is how to serve God. To
waste no thoughts upon length of life, but to cultivate rectitude—that
is to do the will of God." Confucianism has often been stigmatized as a
mere philosophy, inadequate to the spiritual needs of man; the last
words, however, of the above quotation go far to show that the
cultivation of rectitude is, according to Confucian teachings, broad
based upon the will of God.
