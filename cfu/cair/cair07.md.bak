### LECTURE V

#### B.C. 200-A.D. 100

<span class="smallcaps">Scattered</span> through the genuine remains of
certain Chinese philosophers who flourished in the fourth, third, and
second centuries B.C., we find a number of pithy sayings and maxims
attributed to a personage named Lao Tzŭ. Various accounts have been
given of the date, place, and manner of his birth, all of which bear the
stamp of legend. Some say that his mother was moved by a shooting star,
under which form he came down from heaven. Some say that he came into
being before the universe, and some that he was the quintessential
spirit of God. Others speak of a gestation of seventy-two years, at the
end of which he emerged from his mother's side; others again declare
that his was a case of virgin birth. The name Lao Tzŭ is usually
accepted as meaning Old Philosopher; it may also mean "old child," which
latter term has been adopted by some and explained by the fact that this
child's hair was white at birth, or alternatively, by a *lucus a non
lucendo* process, that he was called Old Boy because, although existing
before the universe, he never became old. All this does not by any means
prove that no such man as

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lao Tzŭ ever
existed. The conviction which must be forced upon the minds of all who
have given serious attention to the subject lies in an exactly contrary
direction; the real difficulty is with the date of Lao Tzŭ's birth, now
popularly, but not authoritatively, fixed at 604 B.C.

An effort has been made, by the usual trick of interpolation, to show
that Confucius paid a visit to Lao Tzŭ, and was astounded at the wisdom
of the Old Philosopher. In addition to the chronological difficulty,
those who favour this view have to explain away the awkward fact that
Confucius never once mentions the name of Lao Tzŭ; neither does the
writer of the commentary to the Confucian annals, whose record covers
Lao Tzŭ's lifetime; neither does Mencius, who made it the chief business
of his life to exalt Confucianism and to demolish the system of any
possible competitor. The first writer of real consequence who does
mention Lao Tzŭ's name, and the genuineness of whose work as a whole—for
chapters and paragraphs have been interpolated—is above suspicion, lived
in the fourth and third centuries B.C., and is known as Chuang Tzŭ, the
philosopher Chuang, already quoted in connexion with the impersonator of
the dead. He attempted to substitute Lao Tzŭ, as the spiritual guide of
the Chinese people, for Confucius, whose teachings he considered likely
to bring about the very evils they were intended to combat. Except in
passages where Lao Tzŭ is actually mentioned, it is often impossible to
say how far Chuang Tzŭ has drawn his inspiration

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

from the older philosopher, and how far his speculations are his own. He
had only tradition to help him; it was not until a much later date that
a book, said to be by Lao Tzŭ, appeared in literature. This book will be
dealt with in its place; meanwhile, we may consider a few passages from
the writings of Chuang Tzŭ himself, who strove to do for the doctrines
of Lao Tzŭ what Mencius did for Confucianism.

"Joy and anger," says Chuang Tzŭ, "sorrow and happiness, caution and
remorse, come upon us by turns, with ever-changing mood. They come like
music from hollowness, like mushrooms from damp. Daily and nightly they
alternate within us, but we cannot tell whence they spring. Can we then
hope in a moment to lay a finger upon their very Cause? But for these
emotions, *I* should not be. But for me, *they* would have no scope. So
far can we go; but we do not know what it is that brings them into play.
’Twould seem to be a soul; but the clue to its existence is wanting.
That some Power operates is credible enough, though we cannot see its
form. Perhaps it has functions without form. Take the human body with
all its manifold divisions. Which part of it does a man love best? Does
he not cherish all equally, or has he a preference? Do not all equally
serve him? And do these servitors then govern themselves, or are they
subdivided into rulers and subjects? Surely there is some soul that
sways them all. But whether or not we ascertain what are the functions
of this soul, it matters but little to the

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

soul itself. For coming into existence with this mortal coil of mine,
with the exhaustion of this mortal coil the mandate of the soul will be
exhausted. To be harassed by the wear and tear of life, and to pass
rapidly through it without the possibility of arresting one's course—is
not this pitiful indeed? To labour without ceasing, and then, without
living to enjoy the fruit, worn out, to depart suddenly, one knows not
whither—is not that a just cause for grief?"

Chuang Tzŭ conceived of the soul as an emanation from God, passing to
and from this earth through the portals of birth and death. Life was not
a boon, but rather a misfortune, banishing the recipient, for a longer
or shorter period, from partnership with God. Death was therefore a
release, enabling the wearied spirit to return whence it had come. But
the God of Chuang Tzŭ was no longer identical with the God of the Odes,
though here and there traces of the old conception remain.

We are sometimes confronted with a psychological Unity instead of a
concrete personality. With Chuang Tzŭ, all things are one, and that One
is God, in whose obliterating unity we are embraced. "What is it," he
asks, "to be embraced in the obliterating unity of God? It is this. With
reference to positive and negative, to that which is so and that which
is not so—if the positive is really positive, it must necessarily be
different from its negative: there is no room for argument. And if that
which is so really is so, it must necessarily be different from

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

that which is not so: there is no room for argument." Therefore we are
advised to take no heed of time, nor of right and wrong, but, passing
into the realm of the Infinite, that is, of God, to take our final rest
therein. Contraries, he explains, cannot but exist, but they should
exist independently of each other, without antagonism. Such a condition
is found only in the all-embracing unity of God; in other words, of the
Infinite Absolute. There, all distinctions of positive and negative, of
right and wrong, of this and that, are obliterated and merged in One.
But this still leaves us far from the desired goal. According to Herbert
Spencer (*Principles of Psychology*, i. p. 272), "The antithesis of
subject and object, never to be transcended while consciousness lasts,
renders impossible all knowledge of the Ultimate Reality in which
subject and object are united." Chuang Tzŭ, however, has an illustration
which, if it fails to prove that the antithesis of subject and object
may indeed be transcended, has had at any rate the merit of gaining for
its author the sobriquet of "Butterfly Chuang." It is brief, and to the
point. "Once upon a time, I dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither
and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. Suddenly I awaked,
and there I lay, myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a
man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly dreaming
I am a man."

"He who knows what God is," says Chuang Tzŭ, "and who knows what man is,
has attained. Knowing what God is, he knows that he himself proceeded

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

therefrom. Knowing what man is, he rests in the knowledge of the known,
waiting for the knowledge of the unknown. Herein, however, there is a
flaw. Knowledge is dependent upon fulfilment. And as this fulfilment is
uncertain, how can it be known that my divine is not really human, my
human really divine?" By these words Chuang Tzŭ means that not until
death lifts the veil can we truly know that this life is bounded at each
end by an immortality from which the soul originally came and to which
it finally reverts, thereby admitting that his dogma is no more than a
human speculation, and certainly not of the nature of a revelation from
God Himself. He goes on to say that it is all-important for us to have
men of transcendent knowledge, such indeed as were the men of old. "For
what they cared for could be reduced to One, and what they did not care
for to One also. That which was One was One, and that which was not One
was likewise One. In that which was One, they were of God; in that which
was not One, they were of man. And so between the human and the divine
no conflict ensued." Confucius, who is frequently introduced by Chuang
Tzŭ into imaginary conversations, is here made to confirm this view. The
occasion was an historical one, and is mentioned in the Analects (*Lun
Yü*). Confucius and his disciples were in danger, while travelling, and
had been some days—Chuang Tzŭ says seven days—without food. In the
Analects we have merely a complaint by one of the disciples, rebuked by
Confucius, that superior men should have to suffer

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

privations. Chuang Tzŭ represents Confucius as singing, to relieve the
tension, and stopping to say to one of the disciples, There is no
beginning and no end. Man and God are One. That being the case, who was
singing just now?" In another passage we read, "The ultimate end is God.
He is manifested in the laws of nature. He is the hidden spring. At the
beginning, He was. This, however," Chuang Tzŭ adds, "is inexplicable. It
is unknowable. But from the unknowable we reach the known."

After this, it may be a surprise to find that God was not the ultimate
Supreme Power recognized by Chuang Tzŭ, as an exponent of the doctrines
of Lao Tzŭ. In spite of the lofty position accorded, as we have seen, to
God, there was something—we cannot say someone—on which Chuang Tzŭ,
following Lao Tzŭ, made God Himself dependent, not only for power, but
even for His very existence. This something was called by Lao Tzŭ *Tao*,
meaning, as it means in common parlance to this day, a way, a road, a
path. In Confucianism it is used for the true path, like the ὁδός of the
New Testament, or the Buddhist *marga*, the path which leads to Nirvâna;
and it subsequently comes to mean doctrines, and even religion. Han Fei,
a philosopher of the third century B.C., tells us that matter which is
subject to structural changes cannot be regarded as eternal; it came
into being with heaven and earth, and with heaven and earth it will pass
away. But the eternal is unconditioned; and therefore it was that Lao
Tzŭ explained, in reference to *Tao*,

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "The way which can
be walked upon is not the eternal Way."

To translate the *Tao* of Lao Tzŭ and of Chuang Tzŭ by the Way, is, as
will be shown, a mere makeshift; the word is untranslatable. Chuang Tzŭ
says, "A man looks upon God as his father, and loves Him in like
measure. Shall he, then, not love that which is greater than
God?"—meaning Tao, the omnipresent, omnipotent, eternal something which
invests even God Himself with the power and attributes of divinity. In
the words of Chuang Tzŭ, "Tao has its laws, and its evidences. It is
devoid both of action and of form. It may be transmitted, but cannot be
taken. It may be obtained, but cannot be seen. Before heaven and earth
were, Tao was. It has existed without change from all time. Spiritual
beings drew their spirituality therefrom, while the universe became what
we see it now. To Tao, the zenith is not high, nor the nadir low; no
point in time is long ago, nor by lapse of ages has Tao itself grown
old."

Chuang Tzŭ proceeds to enumerate several famous sovereigns and others of
antiquity who, by virtue of *Tao*, succeeded in all their undertakings.
Among these he includes some striking and familiar objects in nature.
"The constellation of the Great Bear obtained *Tao*, and has never erred
from its course. The sun and moon obtained it, and have never ceased to
revolve." We have now to face the apparent paradox that although *Tao*
can be obtained, nevertheless it cannot be taught. Of this Chuang Tzŭ

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

gives several illustrative anecdotes. A man who was asked how in old age
he still managed to keep the complexion of a child, replied that it was
the result of *Tao*; and he went on to say that in a case in which he
had caused a pupil to become, so to speak, possessed by *Tao*, he had
succeeded, not by teaching but by not teaching. "I imparted," he
explained, "as though withholding; and within three days, for him, this
sublunary state (with all its paltry distinctions of sovereign and
subject, high and low, good and bad, etc.) had ceased to exist. When he
had attained to this, I withheld again; and in seven days more, for him,
the external world had ceased to be. And so again for another nine days,
when he became unconscious of his own self. He was first etherealized,
next possessed of perfect wisdom, then without past or present, and
finally able to enter there where life and death are no more, where
killing does not take away life, nor does the prolongation of life add
to the duration of existence."

Chuang Tzŭ is the greatest of the heterodox writers of China. His work
is highly esteemed for its trenchant and beautiful style, but it is none
the less under the ban of the orthodox. The reason for this is obvious.
Confucianism is satirized, and Confucius himself is held up to ridicule
as unable to refute the doctrine of *Tao*, and even becoming a convert
to its tenets. Chuang Tzŭ invents a story of three men who were
conversing together, when it was asked, "Who can be, and yet not be? Who
can do, and yet not do? Who can mount to heaven, and, roaming

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

through the clouds, pass beyond the limits of space, oblivious of
existence, for ever and ever without end?" The three looked at each
other and smiled; and as neither had any misgivings, they became friends
accordingly. Shortly afterwards, one of them, named Sang Hu, died;
whereupon Confucius sent a disciple to take part in the mourning. The
disciple found one of the two survivors playing on a psaltery, or
Chinese lute, and the other singing,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">La, la, la—come back to us, Sang Hu (*calling his
spirit*).  
Thou hast already returned to thy God,  
While we still remain here as men—alas!</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "How can you
sing," cried the disciple, "alongside of a corpse? Is this decorum?" The
two looked at each other and laughed, saying, What should this man know
of decorum indeed?" The disciple then hurried back and reported to
Confucius, who said, "These men travel beyond the rule of life. I travel
within it. Consequently our paths do not meet; and I was wrong in
sending you to mourn. They consider themselves as one with God,
recognizing no distinctions between human and divine. They look on life
as a huge tumour from which death sets them free. All the same, they
know not where they were before birth, nor where they will be after
death. Though admitting different elements, they take their stand upon
the unity of all things. They ignore their passions. They take no count
of their ears and eyes. Backward and forward through all eternity, they
do not admit a beginning or an end. They

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

stroll beyond the dust and dirt of mortality, to wander in the realms of
inaction. How should such men trouble themselves with the
conventionalities of this world, or care what people may think of them?"
"But if this is the case," said the disciple, "why should we stick to
the old rule?" "God has condemned me to this," replied Confucius;
"nevertheless you and I may perhaps escape from it."

This last sentiment, from the mouth of the Master, would be sufficiently
shocking to any devout Confucianist, but is as nothing compared with
another episode, to appreciate which a few preliminary remarks may be
necessary, to recall certain facts which bear upon the situation.
Confucius founded his teachings upon charity of heart, duty towards
one's neighbour, wisdom, and truth, with such adventitious aids to
morality as music and ceremonies. But Chuang Tzŭ, expounding the
doctrines of Lao Tzŭ, taught that all restrictions are artificial, and
therefore deceptive; only by shaking off such fetters, and reverting to
the natural, could man hope to attain. He maintained that distinctions
of right and wrong, of *meum* and *tuum*, and other ethical refinements,
were but the inventions of philosophers, and would have no place under
simple conditions of existence. To quote a single instance, he argued
that if all scales and measures were destroyed, the people would cease
at once to wrangle over quantities, and the result would be the victory
of *Tao*. We may now approach the episode.

"I am getting on," observed a favourite disciple to

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Confucius. "How
so?" asked the latter. "I have got rid of charity of heart and duty
towards my neighbour," replied the disciple. "Very good," said
Confucius, "but not perfect." Another day the disciple met Confucius
again and said, "I am getting on." "How so?" asked Confucius. "I have
got rid of music and ceremonies." "Very good," said Confucius, "but not
perfect." On a third occasion the two met once more, and the disciple
said, "I am getting on." "How so?" asked Confucius, as before. "I have
got rid of everything," replied the disciple. "Got rid of everything!"
cried Confucius eagerly, "what do you mean by that?" "I have freed
myself from my body," said the disciple. "I have discarded my reasoning
powers. And by thus getting rid of both body and mind, I have become One
with the Infinite." "In that case," said Confucius, "I trust to be
allowed to follow in your steps."

There is a rather fascinating chapter in which Chuang Tzŭ employs
allegory to aid in the elucidation of *Tao*. Knowledge set forth on his
travels, and meeting Do-nothing Say-nothing, thus addressed him: "Kindly
tell me by what thoughts, by what cogitations, may *Tao* be known? By
resting in what, by according with what, by pursuing what, may *Tao* be
attained?" Getting no answer, he went off, and by and by meeting
All-in-extremes, he put the same questions. "Ha!" cried All-in-extremes,
"I know; I will tell you. . . ." But just as he was about to speak, he
forgot what he wanted to say. So Knowledge proceeded to the Imperial
palace and

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

asked the Yellow Emperor (B.C. 2698), who is often associated with Lao
Tzŭ as an exponent of *Tao*, and even as a contemporary, though
separated, according to received chronology, by some two thousand years.
"By having no thoughts, by having no cogitations," answered the Yellow
Emperor, "*Tao* can be known. By resting in nothing, by according with
nothing, Tao can be approached. By following nothing, by pursuing
nothing, *Tao* can be obtained." And he added, "Those who understand, do
not speak; those who speak, do not understand. Therefore the inspired
man teaches a doctrine which does not find expression in words." These
last two sentences have been attributed to Lao Tzŭ, and constitute the
basis of his doctrine of Silence; but the authority of Chuang Tzŭ is too
great to be lightly brushed aside.

The still more famous doctrine of Inaction—Do nothing and all things
will be done—which is also attributed to Lao Tzŭ, appears in Chuang Tzŭ
as an actual utterance by the Yellow Emperor. The doctrine itself is
discussed in several passages. For instance: "I make true happiness
consist in inaction. Thus, perfect happiness is the absence of
happiness." This seems to mean that the non-existence of any state or
condition necessarily includes the non-existence of its correlate. If we
do not have happiness, we are at once exempt from misery; and such a
negative state is a state of perfect happiness. Again, "To act through
inaction is God," so excellent are the results achieved, especially, we
are told, in government. In an allegorical passage Chuang Tzŭ makes

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

the Vital Principle say, "That the scheme of empire is in confusion,
that the proper conditions of life are violated, that the will of God
does not triumph, that the beasts of the field are disorganized, that
the birds of the air cry at night, that blight reaches the trees and
herbs, that destruction spreads among creeping things—this, alas! is the
fault of governing. Rest in inaction, and the world will be good of
itself. Cast your slough. Spit forth intelligence. Ignore all
differences. Become one with the Infinite. Release your mind. Free your
soul. Be vacuous. Be nothing!"

We find a sudden transition to more practical politics in an answer
which Lao Tzŭ is supposed to have given to one who asked him, saying,
"If the empire is not to be governed, how are men's hearts to be kept in
order?" "Be careful," replied Lao Tzŭ, "not to interfere with the
natural goodness of the heart of man. Man's heart may be forced down or
stirred up; in each case the issue is fatal. By gentleness the hardest
heart may be softened. But try to cut and polish it;—’twill glow like
fire or freeze like ice. In the twinkling of an eye it will pass beyond
the Four Seas. In repose, profoundly still; in motion, far away in the
sky. No bolt can bar, no bond can bind;—such is the human heart."

Among other philosophers who quote sayings by Lao Tzŭ may be mentioned a
grandson of the founder of the Han dynasty, known as the. prince of
Huai-nan. He died in 122 B.C., leaving behind him a large work, the
first chapter of which is devoted to the origin of *Tao*, and the rest
to what we may now begin to

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

call the doctrines of Taoism. "*Tao*," he says, "covers the sky, and
supports the earth; it stretches to, and includes, the four quarters and
the eight boundaries of space; its height cannot be measured, nor its
depth fathomed;" and so on. Among the sayings of Lao Tzŭ he quotes these
words; "Follow diligently *Tao* in your own heart, but make no display
of it to the world," which may be compared with an almost identical
utterance by Christ: "Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before
men, to be seen of them." Another saying is, "He who, knowing himself to
be strong, is content to be weak—he shall be a cynosure of men." Again,
"The softest things in the world override the hardest; that which has no
substance enters where there is no crevice. And so I know that there is
advantage in Inaction." In illustration of this last, the prince of
Huai-nan borrowed, without acknowledgment, the following anecdote from
Chuang Tzŭ: "Light asked Nothing if it really existed or not. Nothing
did not answer, so Light set to work to watch it. All of a sudden, he
could not see it, or hear it, or touch it. 'Bravo!' cried Light. 'Who is
equal to that? I can get to be nothing, but I cannot get to be not
nothing.'" Chuang Tzŭ himself gives another short anecdote in which
"nothing'' is made to take the part of Inaction. The Yellow Emperor, he
tells us, having lost his magic pearl, employed Intelligence to find it,
but without success. He then employed Sight, and next Speech, but in
each case without success. Finally he employed Nothing, and Nothing got
it. The key

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

to this is that he did not employ Nothing *to find the pearl*. He simply
employed Nothing.

A miracle recorded by the prince of Huai-nan shows that good Taoists get
their rewards in this world as well as in the next, and also recalls the
famous miracle of the sun standing still upon Gibeon, and the moon upon
Ajalon. A duke of Lu-yang, described as a man of true and perfect
nature, whose being was in relationship with God, happened to be at war
with another State. Sunset was fast approaching, while a furious battle
was still raging; and the duke, in order to gain time, shook his spear
at the sun, which forthwith went back three out of the twenty-eight
Chinese divisions of the zodiac. Legend has, of course, been busy with
the name of the prince of Huai-nan. He is said to have discovered the
elixir of life, and to have gone up to heaven in consequence. He is
said, with more show of probability, to have dabbled in alchemy, the
first notions of which are thought to have reached China from the
province of Græco-Bactria. Alchemy is at any rate mentioned in the
Historical Record under the year 133 B.C. A certain magician, who was
able to do without food and possessed the art of putting off old age,
addressed the reigning Emperor as follows: "Sacrifice to the stove and
you will be able to summon spirits. With their aid, powdered cinnabar
can be transmuted into yellow gold. When you have obtained yellow gold,
you will be able to make vessels for holding food and drink; and by
using these, you will secure a great prolongation of life."

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

From this date we have no longer to deal with the original *Tao* of Lao
Tzŭ, as expounded by Chuang Tzŭ, Han Fei Tzŭ, Hsün Tzŭ, and to some
extent by the prince of Huai-nan. Alchemy and the search for the elixir
of life were both incorporated at an early date in the doctrines of the
religion henceforth to be known as Taoism; and various forms of magic,
incantations, and exorcism were soon added. A further and still greater
modification has yet to be dealt with in its proper place.

The Historical Record states, under the year 140 B.C., that the Empress
Dowager, grandmother of the reigning Emperor, "studied the words of the
Yellow Emperor and Lao Tzŭ, and did not care for the precepts of
Confucianism;" and in the history of the Han dynasty we are further told
that, under the preceding reign, "the Emperor and the all Empress
Dowager's family were obliged to study Tzŭ and follow his teachings."
What were these "words of the Yellow Emperor and Lao Tzŭ," this "Lao
Tzŭ" now to be studied by the Court in preference to Confucianism? So
far, we have only heard of sayings by Lao Tzŭ, embedded in the writings
of certain authors, to whom they had been handed down by tradition; we
have never heard of a book. Confucius, Tso-ch‘iu Ming, the writer of the
commentary, and Mencius, as we have already seen, never mention Lao Tzŭ
at all. Chuang Tzŭ, Han Fei Tzŭ, Hsün Tzŭ, and the prince of Huai-nan,
who devote so many chapters to Lao Tzŭ and *Tao*, make no mention of a
book. At the point where we\`

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

are now, that is, towards the middle of the second century B.C., we
gather that not only were the words of Lao Tzŭ brought together into
book form, but were canonized, in deference to the Dowager Empress, as a
sacred text. From that date, we are told, began the study of the *Tao*.
Official patronage however, was not just then of long duration; for in
the same year under which it is recorded that the Empress Dowager
"studied the words of the Yellow Emperor and Lao Tzŭ," her grandson, who
had but lately mounted the throne, put a stop to the glorification of
Lao Tzŭ, and reinstated Confucian doctrines.

The next stage in this inquiry into the rise and development of Taoism
carries us, in point of time, hardly any further down. Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien,
the father of Chinese history, must have been born about the middle of
the second century B.C. The date of his death has been fixed at 87 B.C.
He was the author of the Historical Record, in which, for the first time
in Chinese literature, we find Lao Tzŭ mentioned as the writer of a
book. The historian, after a few details as to Lao Tzŭ's birthplace and
profession, in which pious interpolations are not far to seek, proceeds
to relate the supposed, but impossible, interview of Confucius with Lao
Tzŭ. Then comes the following passage: "In his cultivation of *Tao* and
of *Tê* (which means the exemplification of *Tao*), Lao Tzŭ made
self-effacement and absence of reputation his chief aims. After a long
residence in Chow, he saw that the State was decaying; so he departed,
and reached the frontier-pass. The warden of the

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

pass said to him, 'Sir, as you are about to go into retirement, I
earnestly beg that you will write a book for me.' Thereupon Lao Tzŭ
wrote a book in two parts, on the meaning of *Tao* and *Tê*, containing
five thousand words and more. After this, he departed, and no one knows
what became of him."

We have such a book in "five thousand words and more," which answers,
except as regards date of authorship, to the book to which Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien
alludes, but which he does not appear to have seen. Different editions
contain varying numbers of words, the average being about five thousand
six hundred and fifty. It would be impossible to regard it as the work
of Lao Tzŭ, say five and a half centuries before Christ, even if we
could feel sure that Lao Tzŭ flourished at that date. For a long list of
critical reasons, which cannot be reproduced here, it is practically
certain that this book was pieced together, perhaps in the second
century B.C., by a not too skilful forger. Sayings attributed to Lao Tzŭ
were collected from all sources, and padded out with a supplementary
text, which when not unintelligible is absurd. A small volume was thus
produced, which, although it has not prevailed against the wit of native
critics, has been quite a happy hunting-ground for the foreign student,
ambitious to translate a Chinese text. Thus, it has been rendered many
times into English and other European languages, with one uniform
result. No two translators have ever agreed as to its meaning. Even the
modern title of the book, *Tao Tê Ching*, which dates only

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

from the sixth century A.D., has been interpreted in various senses. Po
Chü-i, a famous poet of the eighth and ninth centuries, hit off the
situation as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Who know, speak not; who speak, know naught"—  
   Are words from Lao Tzŭ's lore;  
 If Lao Tzŭ knew, why did he speak  
   Five thousand words and more?</span>

</div>

Assuming, as seems probable, that some such personage as Lao Tzŭ, even
though confused with the Yellow Emperor, did actually exist at some
remote period, and that he is responsible for the more intelligible
portions of the *Tao Tê Ching*, we can only conclude that he must have
been one of those men whom the Chinese call "inspired," a term now
reserved for the apostles of Confucianism.

The book has been divided into eighty-one chapters; and in chapter lxiii
we find a command, familiar enough to Christians, but remarkable as
occurring in Chinese literature at a very early date:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Recompense injury with kindness!</span>

</div>

with which we may compare the words of the New Testament, "Be not
overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good" (Rom. xii. 21). It has
already been stated that Confucius never made any allusion to Lao Tzŭ.
There is, however, one passage given in his discourses with his
disciples which proves that this famous doctrine, whatever may have been
its source, was already matter of common knowledge. Here are the actual
words: "Someone said to Confucius, 'Recompense injury with kindness.
What do

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

you think of that?' Confucius replied, 'With what then will you
recompense kindness? Injury must be recompensed with justice, kindness
with kindness.'" Another saying by Lao Tzŭ in the same strain runs thus:
"To the good I would be good; to the not-good I would also be good, in
order to make them good." At the same time it is elsewhere pointed out
that "the goodness of *doing* good is not (real) goodness."

Several advanced political maxims are to be found in the *Tao Tê Ching*;
for instance, "Govern a great nation as you would cook a small
fish"—don't overdo it; *pas trop gouverner*, as we say. Again, "The
empire is a divine trust, and may not be ruled. He who rules, ruins; he
who holds by force, loses." So also there are practical injunctions for
everyday life: "Put yourself behind, and the world will put you in
front," "If you would take, you must first give," and others.

There are some few references to the God of the ancient Chinese. In
chapter ix humility is described as the Way of God. In chapter xvi we
have the following weak climax, which has not been identified as a
genuine utterance, and seems, so far as one can venture to judge by the
style, to come from a modern source: "He who is tolerant is just; he who
is just is a king; he who is a king is God; he who is God is *Tao*; he
who is *Tao* is long lasting, and will be all his life free from
danger." In chapter xlvii we have, "Without going out of doors, we may
know all about the empire; without looking

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

out of window, we may behold the Way of God." Chapter lix opens with,
"In governing man and in serving God, there is nothing like
self-restraint."

All kinds of contentions were frowned upon by Lao Tzŭ, as we learn from
many passages in Chuang Tzŭ, some of which have already been quoted. In
chapter lxviii we are told that "the best soldiers do not fight," and
that anyone who can free himself from the desire for such contentions is
worthy to be "the peer of God," using the old phrase with which we are
familiar in the Odes. In chapter lxxiii we have two, if not three,
disconnected allusions, reminiscent of the Deity in ancient Chinese
literature. The first is in doggerel:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Which of us can truly state  
The cause of God Almighty's hate?</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The others are (1)
"The Way of God is, without contending, to win; without speaking, to get
an answer; without beckoning, to cause spontaneous coming; without
moving, to be skilful in planning"; and (2) "God's net is irresistible;
its meshes are large, but there is no escape." In chapter lxxvii there
is a curious passage which has not so far been discovered among the
genuine *Fragmenta*, as quoted by known writers, yet which bears upon
its face the stamp of authenticity: "The Way of God is like the drawing
of a bow, which brings down the high and exalts the low"—just as in Luke
i. 52 we read, "He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and
exalted them of low degree." "It takes from those who have too much, and
gives to those who have too

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

little"—a statement which is in direct opposition to Christ's
oft-repeated saying (Matt. xiii. 12), "Whosoever hath, to him shall be
given: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he
hath." Chapter lxxix is short and may be translated in full; it adds one
more to what may be styled the Christian sentiments of the Old
Philosopher: "When peace is made after great animosity, there is always
a surplus of animosity left behind. Is not this wrong? Accordingly, the
inspired man, when a creditor, does not exact his claim. An honest man
strives to fulfil his contracts; a dishonest man, to evade them. The Way
of God has no partialities; it is always on the side of the just."
Chapter lxxxi has one final allusion to God: "The Way of God is
profitable and not injurious." This conclusion is based upon a sentence
taken from Chuang Tzŭ, which states, with reference to those who
sincerely follow *Tao*, that "the more they give away, the more they
have for themselves."

Such is the *Tao Tê Ching*. As a whole, it does not help us to a more
intimate apprehension of the doctrines of Lao Tzŭ than we can obtain
from the isolated sayings embalmed in the writings of various
philosophers and attributed by them to him. One point especially to be
noticed is the persistence, even where cobwebs of mysticism hang most
thickly, of the old idea of a personal if not anthropomorphic God.

At this juncture, say the first century B.C., we must temporarily take
leave of Taoism. It was then, and

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

continued to be for some time, a mixture of philosophy and superstition
which interested a certain number of persons; but it was in no sense,
what it came to be at a later date, a serious rival to Confucianism. The
latter, meanwhile, held undisputed sway. The damage done by the Burning
of the Books had been to a great extent repaired; and the Canon, with
commentaries which satisfied the scholars of those days, was at the
disposition of all students. But neither did the text of the Canon,
still less the various commentaries, nor the doctrines as therein set
forth, continue, as time went on, to satisfy everybody. Between B.C. 53
and A.D. 18 there flourished a distinguished writer, named Yang Hsiung,
who, although he would have resented any attack upon his orthodoxy as a
Confucianist, was nevertheless unable to accept the dogma that the
nature of a man at birth is good. Neither would he follow Hsün Tzŭ and
accept his conclusion that the nature of man is evil. He propounded an
ethical criterion occupying a middle place between the two extremes,
teaching that the nature is neither good nor evil, but a mixture of
both, and that development in either direction depends wholly on
environment. Subsequently, there arose what nowadays we should call a
school of higher criticism. The chief exponent of this school was a
scholar named Wang Ch‘ung, who was born in A.D. 27. From his earliest
years he showed marked signs of great literary ability. It is recorded
that he used to stroll about the market-place, reading at bookstalls the
books he was too poor to buy, his

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

memory being so retentive that a single perusal was sufficient to fix
the contents of a volume. After a short spell of official life, he
retired dissatisfied to his home, and there composed his great work, the
*Lun Hêng* or "Animadversions," in which he criticizes freely the
teachings of Confucius and Mencius, and tilts generally against the
errors and superstitions of his day. Once again he took up official
life, but for two years only; after which he went back into private life
and occupied himself with literature, chiefly of a reforming character.
He memorialized the throne on the prevailing vice and extravagance; and
in the days of a drunken China, he pleaded for the prohibition of
alcohol; but in both cases without attracting the Emperor's attention.
He was ultimately summoned to Court. The summons, however, came too
late; he was already very ill, and died soon afterwards, aged about
seventy. He is justly ranked as a heterodox thinker, as some extracts
from his writings will speedily prove.

"The Confucianists of the present day," says Wang Ch‘ung, "have great
faith in their Master and accept antiquity as the standard of right.
They strain every nerve to explain and practise the words which are
attributed to their sages and inspired men. The writings, however, of
these sages and inspired men, over which much thought and research have
been spent, cannot be said to be infallibly true; how much less, then,
can their casual utterances be so? But although their utterances are not
true, people generally do not know how to convict them; and even if

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

their utterances were true, because of the difficulty of grasping
abstruse ideas, people generally would not know how to criticize them. I
find that the words of these sages and inspired men are often
contradictory, the value of one passage being frequently destroyed by
the language of a later passage; but the scholars of our day do not see
this. It is invariably said that the seventy disciples of Confucius were
superior in talent to the Confucian scholars of to-day; but this is
nonsense. According to that view, Confucius was a Master, and the
inspired men who preached his doctrines must have been exceptionally
gifted, and therefore different (from our scholars). The fact is that
there is no difference. Those whom we now call men of genius, the
ancients called inspired or divine beings; and therefore it has been
said that men like the seventy disciples have rarely been heard of since
that time."

The criticisms which Wang Ch‘ung passes on Confucius and his teachings
often seem to us trivial enough; as, for instance, when he takes
exception to the language used by Confucius on finding a disciple asleep
in the day-time. "Rotten wood cannot be carved," cried the angry Master;
"you cannot build a wall of manure. This fellow—what is the use of my
reproving him?" Wang Ch‘ung thinks that sleeping in the day-time is a
small fault after all, and should not entail comparison with things that
are useless or loathsome. If the disciple were no better than rotten
wood or manure, he should not have been admitted to an intimacy with
Confucius; if, on

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

the other hand, there was nothing else against him, then he was too
harshly treated.

Wang Ch‘ung is not always quite so trivial as in the above example.
There is a passage in the *Lun Yü* as follows: "Confucius was expressing
a wish to go and live among the nine wild tribes of the east. Someone
said, 'They are uncivilized; how could you do so?' Confucius replied,
'If a superior man dwelt among them, they would not be uncivilized.'"
Upon this, Wang Ch‘ung remarks that Confucius was obviously dissatisfied
with the progress of his doctrines in the Middle Kingdom, and therefore
wanted to go away among the wild tribes. "But," he asks, "if
Confucianism cannot prevail in the Middle Kingdom, how is it going to
prevail among savages?" He follows this up by the use of a deadly
weapon—refutation of a speaker by words from the speaker's own mouth:
"Did not Confucius himself say in another passage, 'The wild tribes of
the east, with their chiefs, are not equal to China with its anarchy.'
And if a doctrine cannot be made to prevail where the conditions are
satisfactory, how can this be effected where the conditions are
unsatisfactory?"

Whatever value Wang Ch‘ung's criticisms may have from the philosophic
point of view, they certainly help us to realize the vigorous domination
of Confucianism in the first century A.D., and the jealous guardianship
which branded as a heretic anyone who disputed its authority even in the
merest trifles. The Chinese have always been very tolerant of each
other's religious convictions, and it was not customary

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

in ancient China to burn persons alive for so-called errors of faith;
still, at no period of Chinese history would it have been quite safe to
denounce Confucius openly and in unmeasured terms as nothing better than
an impostor.

Turning now to a number of passages in which Wang Ch‘ung discusses the
existence and attributes of a Deity, it is noticeable how often he
confuses *T‘ien*, God, with *t‘ien*, the sky. In a few places he employs
the term *Shang Ti*, and then, of course, we can only understand a
personal God, a concept which, speaking generally, seems to be quite
familiar to him, and for which he is directly indebted to his knowledge
of the Confucian Canon. Thus, we read that *Shang Ti* granted extra
years of life to a virtuous ruler; in which connexion Wang Ch‘ung takes
occasion to point out that the ruler in question was not particularly
virtuous, and that other rulers of a more virtuous type had often died
young. "There are but few good men in the empire," he goes on to argue,
"and many bad ones. The good follow right principles, and the bad defy
the will of God. Yet the lives of bad men are not therefore shortened,
nor the lives of good men prolonged. How is it that God does not arrange
that the virtuous shall always enjoy a hundred years of life, and that
the wicked shall die young, as punishment for their guilt?"

There was a case of a young prince who had been unjustly done to death
and whose grave had been violated. His spirit appeared to a retainer and
told

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

him that God had promised to punish the guilty one. "But God," said Wang
Ch‘ung, denouncing the story, "is a public Spirit. Would a public Spirit
take heed of a complaint addressed to Him on a private grievance?" Other
stories of alleged visits to heaven, and interviews with God (*Shang
Ti*), are similarly dismissed by Wang Ch‘ung as preposterous. With
regard to *T‘ien*, the very character for which is, as we have already
seen, beyond doubt anthropomorphic, he has great difficulty in shaking
himself free from the idea of "sky," in spite of numerous quotations
from the Canon for which any other rendering than God would be
impossible. Speaking of heaven and earth as the alleged parents of all
things, he argues, to begin with, that heaven, meaning the sky, cannot
possess mouth and eyes because the earth has none. Then, that heaven and
earth cannot really be the authors of all creation, basing his argument
upon an old story told by several other writers, as follows: "A man of
the Sung State took a piece of ivory in order to carve a mulberry-leaf
for his prince. He spent three years over the work, and succeeded in
turning out a leaf so exact in every detail that if placed among other
real mulberry-leaves no one could tell the difference. A certain
philosopher, however, said, 'If God Almighty were to spend three years
over every leaf, there would not be much foliage on the trees.'" On this
Wang Ch‘ung further enlarges: "Look at the hair and feathers of animals
and birds, with their various colourings; can these have all been made?
At that

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

rate, animals and birds would never be finished. In spring we see plants
growing, and in autumn we see them full-grown. Can heaven and earth have
done this, or do things grow of themselves? If we say that heaven and
earth have done it, they must have used hands for the purpose. Do heaven
and earth possess many thousands or many myriads of hands, so that they
can produce many thousands and many myriads of things, all at the same
time?"

Altogether, it seems to be a mistake to regard *t‘ien*, the sky, as the
correlate of earth, except in the sense of ordinary phenomena. So soon
as we have any expression of power, or of action, the word loses its
meaning—after all, the later meaning—of sky, and reverts to what was its
original meaning, God. In one remarkable passage, Wang Ch‘ung
introduces, simultaneously, God, *T‘ien*, and God, *Shang Ti*, as though
they were distinct personages, and he makes *Shang Ti* subordinate to
*T‘ien*. The reference is to a drought which occurred during the reign
of T‘ang the Completer, who came to the throne in 1766 B.C., and which
had persisted for several years. The Emperor repaired alone to a grove
of mulberry-trees, and having first cut off his hair and bound his
hands, he offered up the following prayer: "If I alone am guilty, may my
guilt not affect the welfare of the people; and if the guilt be theirs,
may the punishment fall on me alone." Granting that the Emperor was in
fault, Wang Ch‘ung points out that "because of one man's folly, God,
*T‘ien*, employed God, *Shang Ti*, to injure the lives of the people."
Then, because

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

that man presented himself, with prayer, as a victim, "God, *Shang Ti*,
was so pleased that rain fell at once."

Throughout his work, Wang Ch‘ung sets his face steadily against all
forms of supernatural intervention; he will never allow that *post hoc*
is necessarily *propter hoc*. It is not surprising, therefore, to find
that he adds these words: "That the Emperor personally prayed in the
mulberry-grove, that his self-indictment was as mentioned, that he cut
off his hair and bound his hands, thus offering himself as a victim, and
that he implored God—all this may be true; but the statement that rain
fell in consequence seems to be a fable. . . . It is probable that, as
the drought had been lasting a long time, rain fell as a matter of
course, directly after the Emperor had been accusing himself of being
the cause of the drought; and that the people of that day, noticing the
coincidence, thought that the rain had come in answer to prayer." Belief
in divination is ridiculed by Wang Ch‘ung, who argues at length to show
that the will of God cannot be discovered through any arrangement of
reeds or grasses or manifestations on the shell of the tortoise. His
view is that people who are going to be lucky get favourable responses;
those who are going to be unlucky get the reverse.

Wang Ch‘ung's rather shadowy and inconsistent conception of God may be
roughly summed up in a few words. He rejects anthropomorphism pure and
simple: God cannot have mouth and eyes. At the same time, he gives his
Deity a body and locates

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Him in the sky; he
seems to favour the belief that the Deity lives in a palace, as a king
on earth, but from this seclusion he argues that God cannot have
intimate knowledge of human affairs. He does not believe that thunder is
the expression of God's anger, or, indeed, that God is ever angry with
mankind. "All creatures," he says, "are to God like children, and the
kindness and love of father and mother are the same to all their
children." But this fatherhood ceases to have significance in the face
of frequent statements that God is really an immaterial fluid, which
neither makes itself heard nor visible, nor does it act in any way,
except as a spontaneous informing influence which ceaselessly operates
throughout the universe.

If it is not easy to disentangle Wang Ch‘ung's beliefs as to the
existence of a God, there is no longer any difficulty when we come to
the question of a world of spirits. To the old question—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">When coldness wraps this suffering clay,  
Ah, whither strays the immortal mind?</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Wang Ch‘ung
returns a categorical answer. "The dead," he says, "do not become
disembodied spirits; neither have they consciousness, nor do they injure
anybody. Animals do not become spirits after death; why should man alone
undergo this change? That which informs man at his birth is a vital
fluid, or soul, and at death this vitality is extinguished, the body
decays and becomes dust. How can it become a spirit? Vitality becomes
humanity, just as water becomes ice. The ice melts and is water again;
man

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

dies and reverts to the condition of the vital fluid. Death is like the
extinction of fire. When a fire is extinguished, its light does not
shine any more; and when a man dies, his intellect does not perceive any
more. The nature of both is the same. If people, nevertheless, pretend
that the dead have knowledge, they are mistaken. The spirits which
people see are invariably in the form of human beings, and that very
fact is enough of itself to prove that these apparitions cannot be the
souls of dead men. If a sack is filled with grain, it will stand up, and
is obviously a sack of grain; but if the sack is burst and the grain
falls out, then it collapses and disappears from view. Now, man's soul
is enfolded in his body as grain in a sack. When the man dies, his body
decays and his vitality is dissipated. When the grain is taken away, the
sack loses its form; why then, when vitality is gone, should the body
obtain a new shape in which to appear again in the world?

"The number of persons who have died since the world began, old,
middle-aged, and young, must run into thousands of millions, far
exceeding the number of persons alive at the present day. If every one
of these has become a disembodied spirit, there must be at least one to
every yard as we walk along the road; and those who die now must
suddenly find themselves face to face with vast crowds of spirits,
filling every house and street. If these spirits are the souls of dead
men, they should always appear naked; for surely it is not contended
that clothes have souls as well as men. It can further be shown not only
that

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

dead men never become spirits, but also that they are without
consciousness, by the simple fact that before birth they are without
consciousness. Before birth man rests in God; when he dies he goes back
to God. God is vague and without form, and man's soul is there in a
state of unconsciousness. The universe is, indeed, full of disembodied
spirits, but these are not the souls of dead men. They are beings only
of the mind, conjured up for the most part in sickness, when the patient
is especially subject to fear. For sickness induces fear of spirits;
fear of spirits causes the mind to dwell upon them; and thus apparitions
are produced. Even if disembodied spirits did exist, they could not be
either pleased or angry with a sacrifice, for the following reason. We
must admit that spirits do not require man for their maintenance; for if
they did, they would hardly be spirits. If we believe that spirits only
smell the sacrifices, which sacrifices are supposed to bring either
happiness or misfortune, how do we picture to ourselves the habitations
of these spirits? Have they their own provisions stored up, or must they
use the food of man to appease their hunger? Should they possess stores
of their own, these would assuredly be other than human, and they would
not have to eat human food. If they have no provisions of their own,
then we should have to make offerings to them every morning and evening;
and according as we sacrificed to them or did not sacrifice, they would
be satiated or hungry, pleased or angry, respectively."

Wang Ch‘ung's attack was directed, not only

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

against the disembodied spirits of human beings, but against spirits of
all kinds. Belief in minor deities inhabiting mountains, rivers, and
trees, was shown to be absurd; the Spirit of Pestilence, and even the
Spirit of Heaven, used for God in the Odes, by which term he clearly
meant something more than the blue sky, were dismissed as mere figments
of the imagination. "The people of to-day," he says, "rely on
sacrifices. They do not improve their morals, but multiply their
prayers; they do not honour their superiors, but are afraid of spirits.
When they die, or when misfortune befalls them, these things are
ascribed to noxious influences which have not been properly dealt with.
When they have been properly dealt with, and offerings have been
prepared, and yet misfortunes continue to be as numerous as before, they
attribute it all to the sacrifices, declaring that they have not been
performed with sufficient reverence."

At Wang Ch‘ung's date, Taoism was spreading its wings. Its exponents
were known, in Wang Ch‘ung's words, "to vie with one another in
exhibiting strange tricks and all kinds of miracles," for which no
authority is to be found in any of the simple sayings of the Old
Philosopher. Wang Ch‘ung repeats the story—only to laugh at it—which
tells how the prince of Huai-nan did finally succeed in preparing the
elixir of life. Immediately on tasting the compound, he began to rise
from the ground into the air; and, in his excitement, he let fall the
bowl from which he had been drinking. The dogs and poultry of his
establishment, running to drink up the spilt dregs, at once

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

began to sail up after him, and the whole party was soon lost to sight
in the clouds. "Exorcism," says Wang Ch‘ung, "is of no use; sacrifices
are of no avail. Wizards and priests have no power, for it is plain that
all depends on man, and not on disembodied spirits; on his morality, and
not on his sacrifices."

Wang Ch‘ung has a place to himself as the first approach to a great
materialistic writer. His lettered countrymen, however, do not seem to
have fallen to any extent under his influence. Confucianism pursued the
even tenor of its way, and Taoism continued, through the agency of
magicians, charms, amulets, exorcism of evil spirits, and the like, to
satisfy the craving of the masses for a supernatural element in life.
Wang Ch‘ung failed, for two simple reasons. His logic was in many
instances anything but convincing. His attacks upon Confucius and his
doctrines outraged feelings that were already deep-set. The Chinese had
still to wait many centuries for a teacher who could use Confucianism as
a vehicle for the conveyance of materialistic doctrines, and all to the
greater glory of Confucius himself. Meanwhile, another rival was at
hand.
