### LECTURE IV

#### B.C. 300-200

<span class="smallcaps">We</span> now come to the arguments by which
Mencius sought to prove that the original nature of man is good, and
becomes corrupted only by environment. A philosopher of the day, named
Kao, said, "Man's nature may be likened to a willow-tree, and duty
towards one's neighbour to a bowl. You get charity of heart and duty
towards one's neighbour out of man's nature just as you get a wooden
bowl out of a willow-tree." "Sir," replied Mencius, "Can you get bowls
from willow-trees without injuring the original nature of the trees? In
order to get your bowl, you must first kill and rob the tree; and by
parity of reasoning, in order to get charity of heart and duty towards
one's neighbour, you must first kill and rob the man. The result would
be that all mankind would regard charity of heart and duty towards one's
neighbour as nothing better than calamities."

The philosopher Kao said, "Man's nature is like rushing water; make a
passage for it towards the east, and it will flow eastwards; make a
passage for it towards the west, and it will flow westward.

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Man's nature has
no particular bent towards good or evil, any more than water has a
particular bent towards east or west." "Water has indeed no bias,"
replied Mencius, "either east or west; but will it flow indifferently up
or down? Man's bent towards good may be likened to the tendency of water
to flow downwards. There are no men but have this bent towards good,
just as there is no water which does not flow downwards. Of course, by
striking it, you can make water jump up over your head, and you can
also, by proper management, force it up a hill (as by water-wheels); but
is this in accordance with the nature of water? It is simply a question
of force; and if men are caused to do what is not good, it is in
precisely the same way."

The philosopher Kao said, "What is reached at birth, that is the
nature." "Do you mean to say, then," inquired Mencius, "that, in a
similar way, all white is white?" "I do," replied Kao. "Do you mean,"
continued Mencius, "that the whiteness of a white feather is the same as
the whiteness of snow, and that the whiteness of white snow is the same
as the whiteness of white jade?" "I do," replied Kao. "Then," said
Mencius, "you evidently mean that the nature of a dog is the same as
that of an ox, and that the nature of an ox is the same as that of a
man."

Wishing for more direct instructions than can be found in the above, a
disciple said to Mencius, "There is the philosopher Kao; he declares
that the nature of man is neither good nor bad. Others say

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

that it may be trained to do either good or evil; others, again, say
that some natures are good and some bad; and now you say that man's
nature is good. Then are all those wrong?" "To judge by our feelings,"
replied Mencius, "man's nature is adapted for the practice of what is
good; and that is what I mean when I say it is good. if a man does what
is evil, the blame cannot be laid upon his natural powers." Mencius goes
on to show that certain feelings, such as pity, shame, respect, and
sense of right and wrong, belong to the four virtues, charity of heart,
duty towards one's neighbour, propriety, and wisdom respectively, all of
which, Mencius tells us, are certainly innate; but it is still more
difficult to see how this advances the position. His language is clearer
when he says, "In good years, the young men have the wherewithal to feed
themselves, but in bad years they become desperate. This is not because
God has given them different temperaments for different occasions, but
because their minds sink under the strain of exceptional circumstances."

Mencius proceeds to argue that crops of barley, for instance, if sown
under identical conditions, will yield identical results; and that if
there are any differences in results between the harvests of two crops,
this will be due to inequalities of soil, of rainfall, or of
cultivation, and not to any difference in the nature of the barley. Why,
then, should man form an exception to the rule? He quotes in support of
this an old philosopher who said, "If a man were to make sandals without
knowing the size required, I know that he

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

would not make them as big as clothes-baskets," the reason given for
this being that all sandals are alike and all feet much the same in
size. Again, Mencius says, "If men differed in their taste for food in
the same way that men differ in this respect from dogs and horses, how
could there ever have arisen a standard cookery which is generally
accepted? It must be, therefore, that men's palates are alike. And so
with regard to music, and even beauty, for which there are fixed
standards of taste; and this being the case, is it likely that men's
minds can be without some common standard? Where, then, do we find this
common standard? It is to be found in the eternal principles and
practice of right and wrong. The inspired sages of old were merely
beforehand in expressing feelings which I now share with all man- kind,
and of which I approve in the same way that my palate approves of such
food as is commonly approved of by all men."

"There is the Ox Mountain," said Mencius, "which was once overgrown with
beautiful trees. The mountain, however, was situated on the frontier
between two States; and in process of time all the trees were hacked
about until there was very little left of them. Even when the trees did
attempt to sprout again, cattle and goats came and browsed upon the
young shoots, and the mountain was stripped bare, so that nowadays
people do not understand that it was once finely wooded. But is bareness
the nature of that mountain? And can we then say that the human mind is
devoid of a sense of charity

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

and duty? No; a man's moral sense suffers loss just as trees suffer
under the axe. Day by day hacked about, how can they retain their
beauty? Then comes the restoring influence of night, when the moral
sense reasserts itself; still, the fetters and gyves of the day more
than counteract this influence, and men sink to the level of brutes, in
which condition it would seem that charity of heart and duty towards
one's neighbour had never had any place in their minds. Can this
condition be regarded as fitting for the human race? If it receive its
proper nourishment, there is nothing that will not grow; if this
nourishment is wanting, there is nothing which will not decay. Confucius
said, 'Hold fast to your moral sense, and it will remain with you; let
it go, and you will lose it.'"

It was thus that Mencius satisfied himself and others that Confucius was
not in error when he handed down the tradition that man is born good; a
dogma which has ever since been accepted by Confucianists as the
keystone of their arch. Its validity was disputed some few years later
by a philosopher, named Hsün (see *ante*), who wrote an essay to prove
that the nature of man at birth is evil. "A crooked stick," says Hsün
Tzŭ, "must be softened and bent, if you want to make it straight; a
blunt knife must be applied to the grindstone, if you want to make it
sharp; and the nature of man, being evil, must be submitted to teachers
and laws, if you want to make it correct. Our nature is from God; it
cannot be obtained by learning and striving. It is erroneous to

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

say that the nature of man is originally good, and that it becomes bad
by association and environment. If the nature of a man, with which he is
born, can diverge from its original purity, that nature is gone; and
this makes it clear that the nature must have been evil to start with.
Indeed, if it were really good, it would need no training to keep it so.
The nature of the eye is to see, and the nature of the ear is to hear;
if man's nature could be regarded as something which was so at the
beginning and remained so without assistance of any kind, then we might
say that the nature of man is good, in the same way that we say the eyes
see and the ears hear. If a man is good, that is an artificial result.
For, his condition being what it is, he is influenced first of all by a
desire for gain. Hence, he strives to get all he can without
consideration for his neighbour. Secondly, he is liable to envy and
hate. Hence, he seeks the ruin of others, and loyalty and truth are set
aside. Thirdly, he is a slave to his animal passions. Hence, he commits
excesses, and wanders from the path of duty and right. Thus, conformity
with man's natural disposition leads to all kinds of violence, disorder,
and ultimate barbarism. Only under the restraint of law and of lofty
moral influences does man eventually become fit to be a member of
regularly organized society. From these premises we must necessarily
conclude that by nature man is evil; and that if he becomes good, that
is an artificial result."

Apart from the question of man's nature at birth, Hsün Tzŭ has something
to say on man's relations

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

with the Deity. "God," he argues, "is consistent in His actions, but it
is not He who preserves the good man and destroys the bad. A ruler who
responds with good government is happy; whereas bad government leads to
his destruction. If a man is thrifty and economical, then God cannot
make him poor; if he takes care of himself at all seasons, then God
cannot make him sick; if he is single-minded in his pursuit of what is
right, then God cannot bring misfortune upon him. Therefore, floods and
drought will not cause him to hunger and thirst; heat and cold will not
be able to affect his health; nor will devils and bogies be able to
destroy him. So, too, if a man is extravagant, God cannot make him rich;
if he neglects his health, God cannot make him whole; and if he strays
from the true path, God cannot make him happy. Before floods and drought
can reach him, he will already hunger and thirst; before cold and heat
can attack him, he will already be sick; and before devils and bogies
can seize him, he will already be destroyed. For such calamities,"
continues Hsün Tzŭ, "God is not to be blamed; and whosoever can rightly
apportion the respective shares of God and man in the scheme of the
universe, such a one may be styled perfect indeed."

Hsün Tzŭ set his face against superstition. "When stars fall or trees
shriek, all cry out in fear, 'What's that?' I say, '’Tis nothing but
some natural process which we may marvel at, not fear.'" Again—a
favourite quotation—"God does not speak, yet the four seasons pursue
their regular course; and just so,

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

inspired men give spiritual guidance, and the whole world obeys them.
God is truth, and He expresses it by their help. He does not speak, yet
we trust Him; the spirits are not angry, yet we hold them in awe. The
inscrutableness of God constitutes His divinity; the unchangeableness of
this divinity constitutes God. God is immanent in all things; there is
nowhere where He is not. God takes cognizance of objective existences,
not by the senses of hearing and sight, nor by any working of the mind,
but through that principle to which all physical things and all moral
questions are subordinate, which is more effective than the senses or
the workings of the mind. God sees and hears through the medium of the
people, and is influenced accordingly; therefore it has been said that
God is the expression of the people's hearts. The spirits of nature have
their limitations, and cannot make themselves everywhere heard. The
spirit recognized by the inspired man is God alone, who can penetrate
and make Himself known through all things."

The Chinese people decided early not to allow the logic of Hsün Tzŭ to
displace the already accepted arguments of Mencius. Luckily for himself,
Mencius was no longer alive when the controversy broke out. He had had a
sufficient task, as it was, in combating other doctrines. "Master," said
a disciple to hire, "people all say that you are fond of disputing; I
venture to ask if that is so." "It is not," replied Mencius; "the fact
is that I cannot do otherwise." He then proceeds to give reasons.
"Unemployed

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

scholars," said Mencius, "are discussing unorthodox themes. The words of
Yang Chu and Mo Ti fill the empire, and those who are not on the side of
one will be found on the side of the other. Yang's doctrine is *Every
man for himself*, which means that he recognizes no ruler. Mo's doctrine
is *Love all equally*, which means that he does not recognize the
special claim of a parent. But to recognize neither parent nor ruler is
to be a brute beast. If these doctrines are not checked, and the
doctrines of Confucius are not put forward, heterodox teachings will
delude the people, and charity of heart and duty towards one's neighbour
will cease to prevail. Then, beasts will be led on to devour men, and
men will soon be devouring one another. I am alarmed by these things,
and address myself to the doctrines of the inspired men of old in order
to oppose Yang and Mo."

There is another passage where Mencius, alluding to the system of
ethical egoism preached by Yang Chu, has the following words: "Though he
might have benefited the whole world by plucking out a single hair, he
would not have done it." This is not quite fair to Yang Chu. The story
is that someone said to him, "If by plucking a single hair from your
body you could save the whole world, would you do it?" "The world could
not possibly be saved by a single hair," replied Yang. "But if it could
be so saved," said his questioner, "would you do it?" To this Yang made
no reply. For us, no reply is necessary; the mere fact of such a
question being

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

put to him is sufficient to disclose the general trend of his teachings.
He was an uncompromising pessimist, and answered the famous question "is
life worth living?" by an emphatic negative. He argued that even if a
man lived to a hundred, so many years would have to be deducted for
infancy, sleep, pain and sickness, anxiety and sorrow, and for the
dotage of old age, that barely ten years would be left for not
altogether unclouded enjoyment.

"What then," he asked, "can be the object of human existence? Wherein is
happiness to be found?—In the appointments of wealth and luxury? In the
enjoyment of the pleasures of sense? Alas! those will not always charm,
and these may not always be enjoyed. Besides, there is the stimulus of
good report, there is the restraint of law, in things we may do and in
things we may not do. And thus we struggle on for a breath of fame,
scheming to be remembered after death; ever on our guard against the
allurements of sense, ever on the watch over our hearts and actions. We
miss whatever of real happiness is to be got out of life, never being
able for a single moment to relax the vigilance of our heed. In what,
indeed, do we differ from the fettered captives of a gaol? The men of
old knew that with life they had come but for a while, and that with
death they would shortly depart. Therefore they followed the desires of
their own hearts, and did not deny themselves pleasures to which they
felt naturally inclined. Fame tempted them not; but led by their
instincts alone, they took such enjoyments as lay in their path,

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

not seeking for a name beyond the grave. They were thus out of the reach
of censure; while as for precedence among men, or length or shortness of
life, these gave them no concern whatever." To one who asked if speedy
death would not be preferable to length of years, and suggested suicide,
Yang Chu replied, "No; since you have got life, do not trouble about it,
but simply bear it; enjoy yourself as best you can while waiting for
death. When death is at hand, do not trouble about it, but simply face
it; take that which comes, and yield yourself up to annihilation."

The philosopher Mo, who suffered at the hands of Mencius a castigation
similar to that dealt out to Yang Chu, seems to have done no more than
propound, as a remedy for all manner of existing evils, the simple
doctrine above-mentioned—an equal love of one's fellow-creatures.

As a specimen of Mo Tzŭ's reasoning, we may take the following parable.
There are two men, one of whom discriminates in his love for his
fellows; the other, in accordance with the teaching of Mo Tzŭ, loves all
men equally. The former argues, "I cannot feel for my friend so strongly
as I feel for myself, neither can I feel for my friend's parents so
strongly as I feel for my own parents." As a consequence of this, he may
see his friend hungry, and will not feed him; he may see him cold, and
will not clothe him; he may see him sick, and will not nurse him; he may
see him dead, and will not bury him. The latter argues, "He who wishes
to play a

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

lofty part among men, will feel for his friend as he feels for himself,
and for his friend's parents as for his own." Therefore, when he sees
his friend hungry, he will feed him; cold, he will clothe him; sick, he
will nurse him; and dead, he will bury him. Such will be the language of
one who loves all men equally, and such will be his conduct. As a
counsel of perfection, there is doubtless little to say against this;
but Mencius was a Confucianist to the backbone, and jealous of what he
fancied might involve even the faintest deviation from the way of his
Master. Therefore Yang Chu and Mo Tzŭ had to go; and, in the striking
words of a native critic, "Mencius snuffed them out."

Between 332 and 295 B.C. there lived one Ch‘ü P‘ing, a famous statesman
and poet, whose name is still a household word in China. In despair at
the unsatisfactory political outlook, he committed suicide by drowning;
and the search for his body has ever since been commemorated at all
important centres by an annual regatta, known as the Dragon Festival.
His writings, which remain to us, contain many allusions to a
Deity—*the* Deity, in fact, with whom we became so familiar in the Odes.
"Man," he says, "sprang originally from God, just as the individual
comes from his parents. When the span of man is at an end, he goes back
to that from which he sprang. Thus it is that in the hour of bitter
trial and exhaustion, there is no man but calls to God, just as in his
hours of sickness and sorrow every one of us will turn to his parents."

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

Among his poems are some songs, written when in exile to replace the
coarse ditties used at sacrifices to God. They were sung to an
accompaniment of music and dancing, and a priest or augur seems to have
acted as a medium between the worshippers and the Deity. One of the
songs runs as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The day is propitious, and well-timed the hour;  
Let us begin to give pleasure to God.  
Let us grasp the hilts of our long swords,  
Let our jade ornaments tinkle and clang,  
Let us have jasper couches and jade ear-plugs.  
Why does not the augur seize the coral branch and diffuse fragrance?  
Let us cook the orchid to provide the food;  
Let us set forth offerings of cassia wine and pepper sauce;  
Let us raise the drumstick and strike the drums,  
At long intervals and slowly, with restrained song.  
Then arrange the pipes and the psaltery, and lift up your voices,  
And the medium will begin to dance in his grand vestments.  
Delicious perfumes fill the hall;  
The five notes <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5) break into harmonious
music,  
And God is happy and at peace.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The ear-plugs,
mentioned above, are held by some to have been mere ornaments, hanging
down from the cap in front of the ears; it seems, however, more
reasonable to regard them as used for stopping up the ear, not after the
fashion of Herbert Spencer to shut out conversation, but simply to keep
out the dust. The coral branch, with which the augur or medium diffused
fragrance, was a magical branch plucked from a coral tree in fairyland;
in fact, a kind of Chinese

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "golden bough."
The slow time of the music was arranged to suit the slow movements of
the dancer.

Another poem is addressed to "The Infinite One," whose presence is
invoked on behalf of worshippers:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Bathed in orchid water, washed with perfumes,  
Dressed in robes gay-coloured like the alpinia,  
The medium performs the ceremony of introducing the Spirit,  
Whose glory shines around, magnificent beyond conception.  
Ah, now it is at rest in our Hall of Longevity,  
Rivalling in brightness the sun and the moon!  
Now God, the Spirit, rides in His dragon chariot,  
And in His flight circles around hither and thither.  
When God has come down in all His glory,  
He rapidly returns to His home in the distant sky.  
He casts His eye over central China and all around,  
Across the boundless spaces of the Four Seas. . . .  
Longing to be with Thee, I sigh deeply,  
And am overwhelmed in my heart with grief.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> An attempt has
been made by some Chinese critics to show that this poem is an allegory,
and that the Deity with whom the writer longs to be at rest is his
prince, who has fallen into evil hands and will not listen to his
counsels. But it appears rather to be a general expression that he is
fatigued with life, and not loth to part, his ever perfervid imagination
being highly stimulated by the sacrificial ceremonies and consciousness
of the divine presence. He devoted another and much longer poem,
entitled "Sinking into Sadness," to chagrin at his ill-success with his
prince, describing with an extraordinary wealth of imagery a flight from
one end of the

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

universe to the other, in search of Truth and Honour, first with a
phœnix as his chariot, drawn by a dragon, and again in a jasper and
ivory car to which flying dragons were harnessed. But all in vain; for
he found himself back at his native place without having discovered the
objects of his search.

Ch‘ü P‘ing passed on the traditional belief in a spiritual survival
after death. At the end of a battle-piece he has the following lines:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">As evening fell, our ardour grew fiercer;  
Our best men were all killed; their bodies lay on the plain.  
They came out but did not go in, they went but did not return;  
The road home from the battle-field was too long.  
There they lay with their great swords, and grasping their bows;  
Heads were separated from bodies, yet hearts never quailed.  
Being thus brave, and soldiers to boot,  
Their vigorous resistance could not be broken.  
And now that their bodies are dead, their divine spirits  
Shall become leaders in the army of disembodied ghosts.</span>

</div>

In the words of a modern patriotic song—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Their souls go marching on.</span>

</div>

One of his longer poems consists of a string of questions addressed
direct to the Deity. It is strangely entitled "God Questions," and not,
as we should expect, "Questions to God," because, as the Chinese editor
tells us, "God is an object of reverence and cannot be questioned;
therefore the words are transposed." The poem opens as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">At the beginning of antiquity,  
Who was there to hand down the story?  
When heaven and earth were without form, <span id="page_111">p.
111</span>  
Who examined and found them so?  
The mysterious sequence of light and darkness,  
Who could penetrate it?  
In the confusion of chaos,  
How could matter be recognized as such?  
The changes of light and darkness,  
How were they periodically brought about?  
The male and female principles, our progenitors,  
What was their origin, and how did they develop?  
The nine layers of the round sky,  
Who has measured them,  
And by whose skill were they constructed?  
How was the turning-rope attached,  
And how was the pole fixed?  
How do the Eight Mountains support the sky,  
And why is the south-east (towards which rivers flow) low lying?  
What do they rest on?  
The nooks and corners of the universe,  
Who can count them?  
Where is the sky joined to the earth,  
And who divided the twelve signs of the zodiac?  
How are the sun and the moon fastened on,  
And how are the constellations laid out?  
From its rising to its setting,  
How many miles does the sun travel?  
What virtue is there in the moon  
By which it dies and is born again?  
What does the hare expect to get  
By sitting gazing in the body of the moon?  
The divine girl who had no husband,  
How did she bear nine sons?  
Where do the spirits of Pestilence and Peace abide?  
How does shutting bring darkness,  
And opening bring light?  
Before the dawn-star appears,  
Where does the sun hide its beams?  
If Kun could not deal with the Flood,  
Why did the people esteem him?</span>

</div>

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

Here follows a passage on the great inundation, which some, as already
mentioned, have sought to identify with the Noachian Deluge. An officer,
named Kun, was first instructed by the Emperor Yao to take it in hand;
but after nine years he had accomplished nothing, and the work was
entrusted by the next Emperor, Shun, to the Great Yü, who, as we have
before seen, carried it to a successful issue. Although it is quite out
of the question that this Chinese Flood and the Deluge of the Old
Testament can have had any connexion one with the other, still, it is a
curious coincidence that China should have suffered from an inundation
of such severity that it made quite as deep an impression upon the minds
of the Chinese people as was made by the Deluge upon the minds of the
Jewish people, and perhaps with equal exaggerations in both cases. Even
at the present day, the two catastrophes, embalmed as they are in the
sacred books of each nation, are equally familiar to both peoples. "All
the high hills," says the Jewish account, "that were under the whole
heaven, were covered." "The waters of the Flood," say the Chinese, "rose
to the sky."

The poem rambles on to a considerable length, with questions on the
myths and popular beliefs of ancient China, such as,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Where is the forest of stone trees,  
And the animals that can speak?  
Where is the country in which men do not die,  
And that in which the long-armed people live?  
How big is the serpent which can swallow elephants?  
When do the lives end of those who do not die?</span>

</div>

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In several places
God is mentioned; once as sending down a substitute for a wicked ruler,
and again as refusing to accept the fat of sacrifice, in view of the
irregular prayer with which it was accompanied. We are also told that

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The will of God is inconsistent,</span>

</div>

sometimes punishing the good, sometimes protecting the wicked, of which
statement the poet quotes several historical examples. For the word
"God," *Shang Ti* is used once; otherwise, *T‘ien* is employed, or Ti as
an abbreviation of *Shang Ti*.

This singular poem was dealt with by Liu Tsung-yüan, a distinguished
poet, who flourished in the eighth and ninth centuries of our era and
published a set of "God Answers" to the famous questions, "of which," as
a native critic has said, "he missed the real purport." For myself, I
freely confess to missing the purport of a great many of the replies,
which are wrapped up in exceedingly obscure language; while such as are
easily intelligible, seem to be trivial. For instance, in reply to the
question how it was that a divine girl who had no husband bore nine
sons, the answer simply amounts to "because she was divine"; and the
question how shutting brings darkness and opening brings light, meets
with a direct denial that such is the case. We may therefore dismiss
further reference to "God Answers," the author of which we shall meet
again later on.

Ch‘ü P‘ing believed in divination, and he has left

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

on record an account of his experiences when trying to probe the future.
Three years had elapsed since his dismissal from office, and still he
was unable to obtain an audience of his prince. His fervent loyalty had
been intercepted by the tongue of slander. He was broken in spirit, and
knew not whither to direct his steps. In his doubt he repaired to the
Chief Augur and asked for a response. Thereupon the Chief Augur arranged
the divining-reeds and wiped the tortoise-shell, saying, "What, sir, are
the points on which you desire to be enlightened?"

"Tell me," cried Ch‘ü P‘ing, "whether I should steadily pursue the path
of truth and loyalty, or follow in the wake of a corrupt generation.
Should I work in the fields with spade and hoe, or seek advancement in
the retinue of a grandee? Should I rest content in the cultivation of
virtue, or practise the art of wheedling women in order to secure
success? Should I be pure and clean-handed in my rectitude, or be an
oily-mouthed, slippery, timeserving sycophant? Should I hold on my
course like an impetuous charger, or oscillate to and fro, with the
indecision of a duck in a pool, as self-interest directs? Should I vie
with the wild goose in soaring to heaven, or scramble for food on a
dunghill with hens? Of these alternatives I would know which to choose.
The age is muddy and will not be made clean. The wing of the cicada
outweighs a thousand pounds. The priceless goblet is set aside for the
delf cup. Flatterers fill high places; men of worth are ignored. Alas!
who is there that knows my worth?"

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

The Chief Augur gathered up his divining apparatus and saluted Ch‘ü
P‘ing, saying, "A foot is ofttimes too short; an inch, too long. The
implements of my art are inadequate to your requirements. Think for
yourself, and translate your thoughts into action. The divining-reeds
and the tortoise-shell would avail you naught."

T‘an Kung, the writer of the fourth and third centuries B.C. from whom
we have already taken a note on the custom of burying people alive,
provides further sidelights upon such topics as ordinary burial and
mourning. "A certain man," he says, "travelled from afar to witness the
funeral obsequies of Confucius. He stayed at the house of a disciple,
who observed that a sage conducting a funeral is one thing, and that a
sage's funeral is another, and asked the visitor what he had expected to
see. 'Do you not remember,' said the disciple, 'that our Master once
said, "Some persons pile up the earth over graves into square, others
into long-shaped tumuli. Others are content with small heaps. I prefer
the small heaps"? So we have given him only a few handfuls of earth, and
he is already buried. Is not this as he would have wished it himself?'"

The question of mourning is treated by T‘an Kung as follows: "One day,
Yu-tzŭ and Tzŭ-yu, two of Confucius’ disciples, happened to see a child
weeping for the loss of its parents. Thereupon the former said, 'I never
could understand why mourners should necessarily jump about to show
their grief; I would long ago have got rid of the custom. Now here you

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

have an honest expression of feeling, and that is all there should ever
be.'

"'My friend,' replied Tzŭ-yu, 'the mourning ceremonial, with all its
material accompaniments, is at once a check upon undue emotion and a
guarantee against any lack of proper respect. Simply to give vent to the
feelings is the way of barbarians. That is not our way.

"'Consider. A man who is pleased will show it in his face. He will sing.
He will get excited. He will dance. So, too, a man who is vexed will
look sad. He will sigh. He will beat his breast. He will jump about. The
due regulation of these emotions is the function of a set ceremonial.

"'Further, a man dies and becomes an object of loathing. A dead body is
shunned. Therefore a shroud is prepared, and other paraphernalia of
burial, in order that the survivors may cease to loathe. At death there
is a sacrifice of wine and meat; when the funeral procession is about to
start there is another; and after burial there is yet a third sacrifice.
Yet no one has ever seen the spirit of the departed come to taste the
food.

"'These have been our customs from remote antiquity. They have not been
discarded, because, in consequence, men no more shun the dead. What you
may censure in those who perform the ceremonial is no blemish in the
ceremonial itself.'"

The same writer introduces into the same subject the question of a
divorced mother. He tells how the son of Tzŭ-ssŭ, the grandson of
Confucius, who

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

had divorced his wife, refused to attend the funeral of his divorced
mother, and how his father was interrogated by one of his own disciples,
saying, "Did not *your* father attend *his* divorced mother's funeral
(alluding to the divorced wife of Confucius), and if so, why cannot you
make your son do likewise?" "My grandfather," replied Tzŭ-ssŭ, "was a
man of complete virtue. With him, whatever was, was right. I cannot
aspire to his level. For me, so long as the deceased was my wife, she
was my son's mother. When she ceased to be my wife, she ceased also to
be his mother." From that time forth, it became the rule among the
descendants of Confucius not to attend the funeral of a divorced mother.

Three divorces in four generations of the same family might lead to the
inference that divorce has always been common in China; but whatever may
have been the case in ancient times, of which even the most meagre
statistics are wanting, it is quite certain that nowadays divorce, which
has always been justified under certain conditions, is of very rare
occurrence. The lady's family has to be reckoned with, and her relatives
and friends take care that justice is done. Premising that, in China,
the dog has always been regarded as an unclean animal, and is used as a
term of abuse, we read that a man, named Pao Yung, who lived about the
time of the Christian era, has ever since been lauded for his filial
piety, because he divorced his wife, somewhat harshly as we should
think, for calling her mother-in-law a bitch.

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

On the subject of mourning and funeral rites, there is a story told by
T‘an Kung of Confucius, generally stigmatized as a formalist and an
inveterate stickler for etiquette, which shows the Master in a somewhat
broader light. An old friend having lost his mother, Confucius went to
assist in varnishing the coffin. "Well, well," exclaimed the friend,
"’tis long since I have had any music." Thereupon he began to sing—a
grave breach of Chinese decorum. Confucius pretended not to hear, and
moved away; but one of his disciples cried out, "Master! should you not
have done with a fellow like this?" "It is certainly not right," replied
Confucius, "to disregard the duties we owe to our parents; but neither
is it right to disregard the duties we owe to our friends."

 

The last quarter of the third century B.C. witnessed the final
disappearance of the Feudal System, which had endured, with more or less
vigour, for the long period of over eight hundred years. China now
became an empire, under the self-named "First Emperor," whose successors
were to be called Second, Third, Fourth, and so on, for ever. We need
not here linger over the historical fact that the Second Emperor was
deposed and put to death, thus bringing the Chin dynasty, as it was
styled, to an early end; but it is necessary, in order to a full
understanding of the literature and religion of China, to mention an
extraordinary event which occurred under the preceding reign. The First
Emperor, about B.C. 212, issued instructions, at the suggestion of his
prime

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

minister, that all records of previous dynasties and all copies of
existing books, with the exception of those on medicine, divination, or
agriculture, should be forthwith burned. The advice was given partly out
of flattery to the Emperor, from whose reign literature and history
would take a fresh start, and partly with a view of strengthening the
recently established house. It was immediately put into force as law,
and subsequently several hundred scholars were buried alive for their
disobedience in concealing forbidden volumes. Thus perished many
valuable works; and it was only by stealth that others, including the
prohibited portions of the Confucian Canon—the Canon of Changes being
classified as a work on divination—were hidden away by devoted
enthusiasts, and subsequently discovered and preserved for future ages.
In fact, so soon after the catastrophe did the revival take place, that
scholars were still to be found who could repeat large portions of
certain books by heart. This was all as it should be; unfortunately,
however, the opportunity was seized by evil-disposed persons to
"recover" various works, some of which had actually been destroyed in
the great holocaust, or had already disappeared by mere efflux of time,
and others which had never previously existed at all. An era of forgery
set in, and of skilful forgery too, but not sufficiently skilful to defy
the acumen of critics of a later age. This is all that it is necessary
to say at the moment in reference to the Burning of the Books.

In our present connexion, this Emperor plays an

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

important part as having been the first monarch to ascend and worship
Mt. T‘ai in Shantung, which is one, and in a religious sense the most
important, of the five sacred mountains of China. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6) By this date, the old monotheism, with its
associated worship of spiritual ancestors, had become extensively
overlaid with various forms of nature worship. The sun, moon, and stars
had long shared with rivers, mountains, trees, thunder, the house-door,
the hearth, etc., etc., in the propitiatory sacrifices and prayers which
had once been offered to God and to ancestors alone. Great heights have
always had an attraction of their own, with perhaps a special appeal in
reference to supernatural phenomena. An old poet of the T‘ang dynasty
(Liu Yü-hsi, A.D. 772-842) says,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Hills are not famous for height alone;  
’Tis the Genius Loci that gives them their charm.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mt. T‘ai forms no
exception to the rule. It is, in fact, a divinity, manifesting itself
from time to time under human form. Five centuries before Christ, the
story goes that a prince of the Ch‘i State, that is, of modern Shantung,
saw in a dream two men who appeared to be violently enraged, and he was
told by an augur that they were the spirits of Mt. T‘ai, angry because
the prince's army had passed the mountain without offering the usual
sacrifice. No explanation is given of the two spirits, who ever
afterwards were content to be worshipped as a single being. The chief
favours sought from the mountain

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

were (1) rain and fine weather in due season, in order to produce
abundant crops for the farmer, and food for the people at large; (2)
protection from earthquakes, thunder-storms, and such dangers as were
supposed to be connected with the appearance of comets, eclipses, and
other natural phenomena. In addition to these occasions of entering into
communication with the spirit of the mountain, some Emperors thought it
advisable to announce their accession to the throne, as a policy of
conciliation in advance.

Approval and assistance were also invoked in the event of a campaign in
distant regions, with a view to the preservation of life as well from
the risks of disease as from death and wounds in the ordinary course of
war. Prayers, many of which are still extant, were addressed to the
mountain, not as an independent deity whose fiat was all that it was
necessary to obtain, but as a mediator between God and man, and one
especially well situated by virtue of elevation to convey human
entreaties to the far-off Supreme Ruler in the sky. On the other hand,
the mountain was saddled with full responsibility for the success of the
negotiations between God and man. One Emperor, so late as 1455, to
anticipate chronological order, made this quite clear in his address, as
follows: "If it is through my wrong-doings that I have drawn down these
calamities, I shall not indeed seek to escape from personal
responsibility; but in the matter of changing misfortune into happiness,
it is really you, O divine one, whose duty it is to attend

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

to that. If after my error you fail to bring about a satisfactory issue,
you will then he as guilty as I am; but if, on the contrary, you change
misfortune into happiness, whose merit will be equal to yours?" Again,
on the occasion of a disastrous flood, the same Emperor addresses the
mountain in similar terms: "Upon whom rests the responsibility?
Undoubtedly, this calamity is due to my lack of virtue; but you too, O
divine one, how can you escape from blame? It is your business to see
that, when the waters burst forth, profit may ensue, and that they may
be for the advantage and not for the distress of the people. Thus, both
you and I will have done our duty; in the eyes of God we shall have
committed no crime, and in the eyes of the people there will be nothing
for which we need blush."

The east is regarded by the Chinese as the source of life; it is from
that quarter that the sun daily renews its light, after being nightly
extinguished in the waves of the western sea. Mt. T‘ai dominates the
east; and consequently, when an Emperor desired a son, it was to this
mountain that he addressed his prayer: "From of old, your divine
influence has been concentrated upon the production of life. You
dominate one quarter of the empire, and secretly give assistance to the
State. I, with all my imperfections, have now for eleven years been the
respectful depositary of the will of God, and during this period I have
reverently served the spirits of heaven and earth without any neglect. I
have no heir, and this causes me constant anxiety. Therefore I have

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

specially prepared a fitting offering, to wit, a sacrificial animal,
silk, unfermented wine, and vegetables, and I have deputed an officer to
convey this humble prayer, hoping that by virtue of your supernatural
power you will obtain for me an heir, and thus prolong the happiness and
duration of my line, and at the same time secure to yourself the
blessing of sacrificial worship for ever and ever."

Some of the still extant prayers addressed to the mountain read more
like invocations of God Himself. For instance, one prayer opens thus: "O
Thou Spirit, who since the beginning of the world hast ruled with might
over the eastern quarter, who bringest the clouds and the rain, and dost
nourish in abundance all living creatures, etc., etc."

The functions of Mt. T‘ai have not been restricted to care for the
living; at a very early date the mountain came to be regarded as the
rendezvous of the dead, whose souls found their way thither after death,
and settled down on a small hill hard by, where relatives often put up
tablets to their memory. This connexion with the dead gave rise to the
belief that the mountain was in some way an arbiter of human existence,
in consequence of which it became customary to address to the spirit
prayers for the prolongation of life.

The ascent of Mt. T‘ai by the First Emperor seems to have been nothing
more than an incident, as compared with a similar ascent, B.C. 110, by
Wu Ti of the Han dynasty, one of China's most famous Emperors, whose
long reign extended from B.C. 140

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

down to B.C. 86. Wu Ti decided that the ceremony should not be a public
one, and he took with him to the summit of the mountain a single
official only. Why this secrecy should have been practised is not
actually known. It has been suggested that the Emperor's object was to
obtain for himself happiness and longevity, and to divert to his
attendant, as a scapegoat, any possible misfortunes in the future which
might otherwise fall to his own lot. The point in question will always
remain a mystery; within a few days the attendant was suddenly taken ill
and died, leaving no one behind, except the Emperor, who could say what
had actually taken place.

Upon four more occasions, at intervals of several years, this same
Emperor repeated his pilgrimage to the top of Mt. T‘ai; and his example
was followed by the Emperor Kuang Wu of the Later Han dynasty in A.D.
56; by the Emperors Kao Tsung and Hsüan Tsung, both of the T‘ang
dynasty, in A.D. 666 and 725 respectively; by the Emperor Chên Tsung of
the Sung dynasty in A.D. 1008, an account of which will be given in its
more chronological place; and finally by the vigorous Manchu Emperor
K‘ang Hsi in 1684. Gradually there grew up two definite services of
religious rites and ceremonies, known as *fêng* and *shan*, the former
consisting of sacrifices to God as father, and the latter of sacrifices
to Earth as mother, of all living things. On arrival at the foot of Mt.
T‘ai, the worshipper began by a preliminary sacrifice at a special altar
on a small hill, in order to

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

announce to the spirit that the ascent of the mountain was about to be
made. The more important sacrifice was reserved for the summit, on which
a second altar—both were round in shape—had been prepared on a larger
scale. A similar sacrifice to Mother Earth was also performed on the
summit, and a second sacrifice, after descending, on an octagonal altar
built on another small hill at the foot of Mt. T‘ai. For the *fêng*
ceremonial the offerings were burnt, as in ordinary sacrificial worship,
so that they might be carried up by fire and smoke into the presence of
God; for the *shan* ceremonial in honour of Mother Earth, the offerings
were buried. These rites were no longer personal on the part of the
Emperor concerned, that is, performed with an eye to individual
benefits, such as happiness and long life; their chief object was to
acknowledge to God and to Mother Earth, through the medium of the
mountain spirit, the blessings which had been vouchsafed to the reigning
house, and to render thanks for the same. This fact was recorded by
inscriptions on two tablets of jade, which were carefully enclosed in
two stone chests and then deposited, one on the summit of Mt. T‘ai, to
be communicated to God, and the other on the *shan* hill at the foot of
the mountain, to be communicated to Mother Earth.

The worship of Mt. T‘ai, to which we shall return in a future lecture,
has spread all over China, and temples dedicated to its spirit are to be
found in most large towns. Any worshipper may now approach these
shrines, and offer up his commonplace prayers.

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It was not always
so. When, in the days of Confucius, the head of a powerful clan proposed
to sacrifice to Mt. T‘ai, the Master was horrified that a vassal should
venture to usurp the rights of his suzerain. He consoled himself,
however, by reflecting that the spirit of the mountain would assuredly
resent the affront.

It will be convenient here to say a few words about another minor deity,
whose worship dates from early ages, and is still, with such
modifications as time brings about, in the forefront of Chinese
religious life. We need not accept too literally the native tradition
that agriculture was first taught to the Chinese by an inspired Emperor
who lived some thirty centuries before the Christian era; on the other
hand, we may take it for certain that so soon as it became a matter of
routine to extract from the earth a much more satisfactory livelihood
than could be obtained from berries and fruits, a desire to secure
regular supplies would naturally suggest to man's growing intelligence
the deification of the source of supply and some form of propitiatory
recognition. It was thus that the agriculturalist came to look upon the
earth—not the whole earth as contrasted with the sky, but his own
particular portion of the soil—as a conscious being, able to provide at
will for his daily necessities, and amenable to the soft flattery of
sacrifice and prayer. The soil, with its apparent powers of yielding or
withholding its vegetable products, became a god—a fifth among the
cluster of family deities, the gods of the kitchen-stove, of the

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

well, of the front door, and of the parlour. The god of the soil once
had his seat in every house, below a small hole in the roof which
admitted both light and especially rain, for the latter of which it was
necessary to preserve an uninterrupted line of communication with the
sky. We are told that this hole originated with underground dwellings
built in layers, one over another; but in such case it is more than
probable that the god of the soil had nothing to do with the matter,
even if he had ever been heard of by the inhabitants of such primitive
homes. However this may be, it was of paramount importance that the
altar of the god should be without roof or covering of any kind; and
thus these altars were always built, as by degrees the worship ceased to
be an individual rite and became a public rite, until first villages and
later large cities possessed altars which belonged to the people in
common. When, in 1766 B.C., T‘ang the Completer had destroyed the last
evil Emperor of the dynasty of Hsia, he wished to remove the altar of
the god of the soil who had been associated with the rulers of that
time; but he found that this plan would be undesirable, for technical
reasons. Being a man of resources, he speedily hit upon means to achieve
the end in view. He put a roof over the spot, and from that moment all
spirituality was gone. The roofed altar was preserved, as a reminder of
the justice of God.

Worship of the god of the soil may still be seen nightly in any Chinese
city. At the doors of shops and houses, lighted sticks of incense are
set before

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

small stone tablets which record the presence of the god, worshipped
here no longer for agricultural assistance, but for anything that can be
got out of him.

The attempt to deal chronologically with traces of the genuinely
religious feelings of the Chinese people has brought us, with some
necessary anticipations, down to the time of the Christian era, or
thereabouts. We must now break off what is meant to be the main thread
of these lectures in order to deal with other strands of thought, which
have for many centuries largely influenced, and do still largely
influence, the religious life of the Chinese.
