### LECTURE II

#### B.C. 1200-500

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Chows, of whom so much has already
been said, chiefly as a tribal community before they secured, under King
Wu (1122 B.C.), the hegemony of the feudal States, traced their line
back to a personage, called Hou Chi, deified, so soon as the Chows
obtained supreme power, as the Consort of God. His date was about 2500
B.C. His real name was Castaway, given to him because more than one
attempt was made to get rid of him, some say as a thing of ill omen. For
his was indeed a miraculous birth, even if not, as supposed by many, a
genuinely virgin birth, to dispose of which view it has been found
necessary to drag in an early Emperor as the putative husband of his
mother, Chiang Yüan. After these few introductory words, the ode now to
be quoted will be found to tell its own tale in sufficiently
intelligible terms:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The origin of our people  
Dates from Chiang Yüan.  
How did she accomplish this?  
She reverently offered up sacrifice  
That she might not be without children. <span id="page_34">p.
34</span>  
Then she stepped in a footprint made by God, and conceived,  
As there, all alone, she stood still.  
Pregnancy followed; in due season  
She gave birth to, and suckled,  
Him whom men now call Hou Chi.  
When she had fulfilled her months,  
Her first-born came like a lamb;  
There was no tearing, no rending,  
No injury, no pain,  
In order to emphasize his divinity.  
Did not God give her comfort?  
Had He not accepted her reverent sacrifice,  
So that thus easily she brought forth her son?</span>

</div>

After the above extraordinary incidents, in which it is competent to
anyone to detect or to denounce evidence of parthenogenesis and also of
supernatural manifestations, we may not be altogether astonished to find
that the babe, instead of being warmly received, was on the contrary
"despised and rejected of men." This would be entirely in keeping with
Chinese views on such subjects, ancient and modern alike; not that any
simple claim to divinity of origin would ever be seriously resented by
the Chinese people, who would simply believe or disbelieve according to
the temperament of each individual, but because, whether supernatural or
not, such a birth would at any rate be unnatural, and therefore
repugnant to the feelings of a nation to which uniformity of procedure,
especially as regards the operation of natural laws, is the criterion of
what is right. Several plots were directed against the life of Hou Chi,
as detailed in the ode:

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">He was exposed in a narrow lane,  
But sheep and oxen protected and suckled him.  
He was exposed in a forest,  
But some wood-cutters found him.  
He was exposed on cold ice,  
But a bird covered him with its wings.  
When the bird flew away,  
Hou Chi began to wail;  
He cried loud and long,  
So that he was heard all down the road.</span>

</div>

Hou Chi devoted himself, in the interests of his countrymen, to
agriculture, and at the date of this ode, which of course cannot be
older than the twelfth century B.C., was still worshipped as the Father
of Husbandry. At the same time, in view of the profound feelings of
veneration and affection which his personality aroused in the hearts of
his countrymen, it was specially laid down that his spirit was not to be
allowed to take precedence of God.

The concluding lines of this panegyric are important for their bearing
on sacrifice, a phase of religion on which, so far, we have but slightly
touched. Hou Chi himself, we are told, had established the custom of
offering up sacrifices of grain—a primitive form of the Harvest
Festival, or Thanksgiving; but now the writer of the ode asks,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">How shall we arrange our sacrifices to Hou Chi?  
Some rub grain in the mortar, others scoop it out,  
Some sift it, some tread it from the husk,  
Some wash it—*sou*, *sou* (suggesting noise),  
Some steam it *fou*, *fou* (suggesting steam).  
Now we divine, now we consider the ceremonial.  
We burn fragrant southernwood together with the fat of the victim; <span
id="page_36">p. 36</span>  
We take a ram, and offer it in sacrifice;  
We offer roast flesh and broiled;  
And thus welcome the New Year.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I must interrupt
these closing verses to say that the line which I have translated

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">We take a ram, and offer it in sacrifice,</span>

</div>

and which may be compared with "the ram of consecration" (Exodus xxix.
31), is declared by commentators to mean

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">We sacrifice a ram to the Spirit of the Path.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This is mere
guesswork on the part of Chinese scholars. The word, used here for the
first and only time in the genuinely ancient Canon, is said to mean a
sacrifice at starting on a journey, which would have no application in
the present connexion. By the time this ode was written, there may well
have been a God of the Road, invoked for safe journeys; but it seems
simpler here to keep the idea of sacrifice without insisting on a minor
deity. The panegyric ends with the following lines:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">We pile the wooden sacrificial vessels with meat,  
And fill the earthenware vessels with broth.  
At length the fragrance mounts on high,  
And God, well pleased, smells the sweet savour,  
Sweet indeed, and in due season.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The coincidence
between the last line but one and Genesis viii. 21, where "the Lord
smelled a sweet savour" arising from Noah's burnt offering, and promised
to curse the earth no more, is sufficiently remarkable; it is further
interesting to note the

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

comment on the words of the Old Testament by Dr Waterland, the
distinguished theologian and Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge,
from 1713 to 1740.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

This expression is used in great condescension to human thoughts and
human language; and is intended to signify that God was pleased with the
piety and devout services of Noah and others, sacrificing to Him from a
pure heart, as men are wont to be pleased with sweet odours. A
comparison taken from things human serves in some measure to illustrate
things divine; and though it is not exact, as none can be exact, yet it
helps to convey a more lively and more affecting idea of the thing than
could be given without it.

</div>

It remains to add that the Chinese term used is *Shang Ti* and not
*T‘ien*, bearing out a distinction I have attempted to establish between
these two expressions, which are beyond all doubt names for one and the
same Being. *T‘ien* may be regarded as God Passive, *Shang Ti* as God
Active; *T‘ien* as Jahveh, or Jehovah (in spite of Dr Pusey's
prohibition of these forms), *Shang Ti* as God. *T‘ien* is perhaps more
an abstract, *Shang Ti* a more personal Deity. Reference to *T‘ien* is
usually associated with fate or destiny, calamities, blessings, prayers
for help, and so forth. The commandments of *T‘ien* are hard to obey. He
is compassionate, as well as to be feared, unjust, and cruel. *Shang Ti*
is more definitely associated with a heaven for departed spirits, and He
walks, as God did in the Garden of Eden, leaves tracks on the ground,
enjoys, as we have seen, the sweet savour of

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

sacrifices, approves or disapproves of conduct, deals with rewards or
punishments in a more intimate way, and comes more actually into touch
with the human race. After all, these are but varying aspects of one
Deity, the two forming a Duality in Unity—two Persons in one God, each
of whom is Almighty, though there are not two Almighties; to borrow the
words attributed to Saint Athanasius, "neither afore, or after other:
neither greater, or less than another."

With the quotation of one more short ode, running only to eight lines,
we may take final leave of Hou Chi. This ode is noteworthy (1) for its
language as a prayer, and (2) for the varying interpretations which have
been discovered of its text.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">O thou divine one, Hou Chi,  
Fit peer of God,  
Establish our myriad people;  
There is none greater than thou.  
Give us this day our wheat and barley,  
Which God appointed for the nourishment of all;  
And without distinction of frontier or boundary,  
Diffuse all virtues throughout this great land.</span>

</div>

There is a singular passage in Chuang Tzŭ, the Taoist writer of the
fourth and third centuries B.C., who will shortly claim our attention,
which passage has nothing to do with Taoism, but has passed, like many
other sayings of the kind, into popular usage. The Emperor Yao, who, as
we have already seen, abdicated in favour of the peasant Shun, is said
to have previously wished to abdicate in favour of Hsü Yu, a worthy
hermit of the day, and to have addressed him accordingly. But the hermit
replied,

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "If a cook is
unable to dress his funeral sacrifices, the boy who impersonates the
dead may not step over the wines and meats and do it for him."

It is with the impersonator of the dead that we now have to deal,
references to whom go back to the very earliest ages. This impersonator
appears to have been a youth, who was introduced into ancestral worship,
not merely as a representative of the dead hero or ancestor in whose
honour the sacrifice was offered, but as a body in which the dead man's
spirit could find an abiding-place, enabling it to be present among the
worshippers. The illusion was enhanced by an absolute muteness and
immobility on the part of the boy; hence the appositeness of Chuang
Tzŭ's remark, If a cook is unable to dress his funeral sacrifices, the
boy who impersonates the dead may not step over the wines and meats and
do it for him."

The phrase "impersonator of the dead" occurs twice in the Canon of
History, both times as a term of contempt, suggesting indolence of an
extreme type. It is used of T‘ai K‘ang, third Emperor of the Hsia
dynasty, who came to the throne in 2188 B.C., as follows: "T‘ai K‘ang
occupied the throne like an impersonator of the dead. By idleness and
dissipation he extinguished his virtue, until the black-haired people
all began to waver in their allegiance." But it is to the Odes that we
must turn to find a fairly complete picture of this ancient ceremonial
worship. After storing up grain of various kinds, distilling
rice-whisky, and preparing various meats, the intending

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

worshippers, "seeking to increase their own bright happiness," induct
the impersonator, and

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">With correct and reverent deportment,  
The oxen and sheep all pure,  
Proceed to the winter or autumnal sacrifices.  
Some flay the victims, some boil the flesh;  
The celebrant (literally, the one who prays) sacrifices within the
temple gate,  
And the rites are brilliantly carried through.  
Now are present our glorious ancestors,  
Whose spirits quietly enjoy the offerings,  
While their filial descendants  
Will receive many blessings,  
And be rewarded, to their great happiness,  
With life everlasting, without end.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The next stage is
the banquet, reserved, with the exception of a loving-cup, for the
spirits only. There are large dishes of roast and broiled meats, and
many other smaller dishes, in the preparation of which the women of the
family are reverently employed. The loving-cup goes round, and all
drink.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Every form is according to rule;  
Every word and every smile are as they should be.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Finally, when the
worshippers and guests are thoroughly exhausted, every detail of the
ceremonial having been strictly performed, we are told that the
celebrant makes the following announcement:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Fragrant has been your filial sacrifice,  
And the spirits have enjoyed the wine and food;  
They confer on you all possible blessings,  
Such as you desire, in accordance with custom.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bells and drums
then warn the company that the

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

ceremony is at an end. The celebrant makes one last, and to our ears
strange announcement:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The Spirits are all drunk,</span>

</div>

upon which the impersonator of the dead rises from his seat, and, amid
the clash of bells and the roll of drums, withdraws from the scene.
Simultaneously. of course, the spirits cease to inform those temporary
tenements of clay; they evanesce, and are gone, no one knows whither.

The spiritual banquet being now over, worshippers and guests, together
with the impersonator of the dead, throw off restraint and proceed to
enjoy the more material banquet, at which the funeral baked meats amply
furnish forth the dining-tables. It is true that by a pleasant fiction
the spirits have extracted from these meats, for their own enjoyment,
most of their delicate flavour; still, to judge by the last verse of the
ode we have been quoting, enough, and to spare, has remained.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The musical instruments are brought in for
playing,  
In order to add a charm to this second feast;  
The dishes of food are set forth;  
There is no grumbling, but all feel happy.  
When drunk, and satiated with food,  
Great and small bow their heads, and the celebrant says,  
The spirits have enjoyed your wine and food,  
And will bestow on you long life;  
Your sacrifices, all in due season,  
Have been fully performed by you.  
May your sons and your grandsons  
Never fail to do likewise.</span>

</div>

We have now nearly done with the Odes, the chief source of all that we
really know, or can infer, of the

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

ancient religion of the Chinese. There still remains, however, a certain
attitude of man towards the Deity, already touched upon, which finds its
place in these early records, just as we can trace, more faintly
perhaps, the murmurings of the Jews in some of the books of the Old
Testament. This attitude is one of dissatisfaction with the
dispensations of Providence; a dissatisfaction often carried to open
resentment, and expressed in stronger language than was ever used, so
far as we can see, in the murmurings of the children of Israel. Thus we
have such lines as,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">God is sending down calamities,  
God is acting oppressively,  
God is getting angry.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">What wrong have we done now,  
That God sends down death and disorder?</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> There is indeed
one case in which an epithet applied to the Deity seems translatable
only by some such word as "hide-bound," in the sense of strict and
unnecessary adherence to the letter rather than to the spirit. The value
of the Chinese word in question may be gauged by its application to
blocks cut for printing, where it is the equivalent of our term
"stereotyped." In some of the Odes, however, a different note is struck;
one of obedience and resignation to the heavenly will. Thus we have,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Almighty God makes no mistakes,</span>

</div>

and then a whole verse, as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Revere the anger of God,  
And venture not to make light of it; <span id="page_43">p. 43</span>  
Revere the changing moods of God,  
And venture not to pursue your own course.  
Almighty God sees clearly,  
And is with you in your outgoings.  
Almighty God is discerning,  
And is with you in all your wanderings.</span>

</div>

The next important source of information on early religious sentiments
in China dates from about the beginning of the genuinely historical
period, and requires a brief introduction.

In addition to the works which Confucius edited, he undertook to write
up the annals of his native State from the year 721 B.C. These annals,
as they stand, consist entirely of bald entries of events, and would be
of little use or interest to anyone but for their association with a
famous commentary in which many of the events recorded are treated in
detail, showing the circumstances which led up to them, and the
consequences which distinguished them from mere everyday happenings.
This commentary is supposed to have been written by a disciple, named
Tso-ch‘iu Ming, some say under the guidance of Confucius, if even not
actually by Confucius himself. It would be impossible, in anything short
of a whole lecture, to deal with the literary question here involved; or
to give a faint idea of the dramatic incidents related, or of the
fascinating style of the writer—a blend of Tacitean terseness with
"Livy's picture page." It must suffice to say that Confucius wrote the
annals, entitled the "Springs and Autumns" in reference to the
arrangement of the entries under the four seasons of the year; and that
someone

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

wrote the commentary, to which I now ask your attention.

Throughout the annals and the commentary alike, the king of the Chow
State, who was suzerain as compared with the rulers of the vassal
States, is invariably spoken of in this connexion as God's king, or as
we should put it, king by the grace of God; in a more general sense, as
the delegated arbiter of human destinies, he was known as God's son, a
term which was still in existence until a couple of years ago, and which
for obvious reasons, as before stated, has been modified into the Son of
Heaven. The intervention of God Himself in the current affairs of men
was firmly believed in, and is alluded to again and again in terms of
the simplest faith. "God has rid them of that pestilent fellow," says
one; "God does not employ men who walk on tiptoe," meaning by this
strange figure of speech persons inclined to pass jauntily through the
gravest crisis. "Duplicity," we are told, "is contrary to the ordinances
of God"; but failing any revealed commandment to that effect, we have no
alternative but to class these utterances as intuitions of the writer.
They remind us, indeed, of similar remarks by our own bishops and
priests, who often declare, with a somewhat reprehensible familiarity,
that God likes, or dislikes, this, that, or the other.

The value of an oath was greatly enhanced by calling God to witness.
There would be a solemn sacrifice in a temple, and an oath would be
taken, of which this is an actual example: "If I am not loyal

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

to my prince and to those who are working for the good of our
country—may God deal with me!" At the conclusion of the oath it was
customary for the covenanter to smear his lips with the blood of the
victim. One example is given of a treaty which had been extracted by
force; and the commentary says that such a treaty might well have been
disregarded, at the same time eulogizing the man who would not repudiate
his oath, even though unfairly obtained. A further example, recorded in
the year 494, tells us of a man who promised to kill his prince's
mother, at a given signal from the prince. This plot he failed to carry
out; explaining that he only agreed to do so through fear for his own
life, and adding, in anticipation of Paley, that only such promises
should be kept as could be justly and rightly performed.

The life of Confucius furnishes us with another illustration. He had
been taken prisoner by rebels, and was released on condition of not
proceeding to the Wei State. Thither, notwithstanding, he continued his
route; and when asked by a disciple whether it was right to violate his
oath, he replied, "It was a forced oath; the spirits do not recognize
such." One more example of these old-world beliefs. A treaty of peace
having been concluded (B.C. 589) with the eastern tribes, a princelet
suggested attacking them while off their guard. To this the Grand Augur
said, "The violation of a treaty will bring you bad luck. Neither the
spirits nor man will help you; how, then, can you expect to succeed?"
The princelet went his own way, and suffered a severe defeat.

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

The fear of God seems to have been ever before the eyes of the Chinese
people during the period with which we are now occupied. Of one of the
feudal princes a speaker said, "He will not escape his doom. Himself
regardless of propriety, he punishes those who observe it. But to
practise propriety is to obey the laws of God; propriety is indeed the
will of God. A superior man is not harsh either to the young or to the
lowly, because he stands in awe of God." The Chinese character here
translated by "propriety" is a word of Protean possibilities; it
represents one of what we may call the five cardinal virtues of the
Confucian moral system, and the application of such a rendering as
"propriety" has met with not a little ridicule at the hands of the
hasty. For "propriety," according to Murray's New English Dictionary,
covers precisely the ground required; e.g., by such definitions of the
word as "conformity with rule or principle; rightness; justness;
correctness of behaviour or morals." In ordinary Chinese life the word
is used to express "politeness and etiquette," but in the classical
language its sense may be gathered from the above various meanings of
propriety, than which objectors have so far failed to provide a better
term.

With regard to any general fear of God, we learn from the earlier
records that such fear was limited to evil-doers, whose acts would be
contrary to the proper harmony of the universe. Given right conduct on
the part of man, there would be no further intervention on the part of
God. The

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

question of belief or disbelief in a God hardly seems to have arisen
until later ages. In the commentary, however, we do meet with a more
openly expressed desire on the part of the Deity to occupy in the hearts
of the people a similar position to that of the God of the Old Testament
in the hearts of His chosen race. Sacrifices, if duly performed, had
always been supposed to avert divine punishment for some irregular act;
but here we have references which tell in a different sense. A man
dreamed that God sent an angel to him, saying, "Sacrifice to Me, and I
will bless thee." This is a striking point, because it was always to the
spirits of deceased ancestors that sacrifices were regularly offered,
with a view to ensure assistance in time of need. "My sacrifices have
always been abundant and pure," said a reigning prince; "the spirits
will surely hold me up." To which his minister replied, "I have heard
that the spirits, good and evil alike, do not attach themselves to a
mere human personality, but are attracted only by the goodness of a
man's disposition."

When sacrifices are mentioned in the various records we have been using,
it is understood that the victim in each case would be one of the
domestic animals, variously enumerated, under B.C. 637, as six, and
under B.C. 529 as five. These animals, to adopt the larger number, would
be the horse (specially so mentioned under B.C. 563), ox, sheep, fowl,
dog, and pig. Under B.C. 637 we read that the ruler of one feudal State
insisted upon the ruler of another State offering up in sacrifice the
ruler of

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

a third State, in order, as we are told, to awe certain wild tribes
which had been giving trouble. A minister, too late to save the victim,
spoke as follows: "Of old, the six domestic animals were not sacrificed
indifferently, one for another; neither for small matters were large
animals used. How much less, then, would human beings have been taken as
victims? Sacrifices are offered for the benefit of men. Men are the
hosts, and spirits are the guests. If you sacrifice a man, who will
enjoy it? Our ruler, at his assembly of the feudal princes, has treated
with oppression the rulers of two other States, and has further used one
of them in sacrifice to a disgusting and unrecognized spirit. Will it
not be difficult to secure the hegemony of the States in this way? Our
ruler will be lucky if he dies in his bed."

A little more than one hundred years later, B.C. 529, we read that the
prince of the Ch‘u State succeeded in extinguishing the Ts‘ai State, and
sacrificed the eldest son of his vanquished rival. Even if the sacrifice
of human beings, in the usual acceptance of the term, was not widely
practised, we know that both men and women were often buried alive as
companions to the dead. Under B.C. 590 we have an account of the burial
of a feudal ruler, who had governed badly and had wasted the resources
of his State upon improper objects. His two chief ministers gave him an
extravagant funeral, using lime made from burnt oyster-shells (as
extracted at the present day) for lining the inside of the grave, and
having more than the usual number of carriages and horses,

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

for which they were duly censured by the "superior man," who is here
supposed to be none other than the writer of the commentary himself.
Then, as we are told, "for the first time men were buried alive with the
corpse." There must, however, be something wrong either with the text or
its interpretation; for under the year B.C. 618 we already have this
earlier allusion to the custom: "When the Duke Mu, the ruler of the Chin
State, died, three brothers were buried alive with him. They were all
good men, and their fellow-countrymen mourned their loss in the ode
called the Yellow Birds, which was specially composed to their memory."

Turning to the ode in question, we find it to consist of three stanzas,
all in exactly the same strain, but with a different brother
commemorated in each. It will suffice, therefore, to quote a single
stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">They flit about, those yellow birds,  
And rest upon the jujube tree.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I may explain that
it is customary, especially in Chinese lyrical poetry, to prefix some
such lines, the application of which is not always obvious. In the
present case, each stanza opens with the two lines given above, but no
two critics agree as to their right interpretation. The rest is simple
enough.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Who followed Duke Mu into the grave?  
Yen-hsi, the son of Tzŭ-chü.  
Ah, this Yen-hsi  
Was one in a hundred.  
When he came to the grave  
He looked terrified and trembled. <span id="page_50">p. 50</span>  
O God, Thou in the blue,  
Thou art destroying our good men.  
Could he have been ransomed,  
We would have given a hundred lives for his.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The line

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">O God, Thou in the blue,</span>

</div>

reminds me that at the present day, when the idea of God has faded in
China to little more than a name, He is still occasionally spoken of as
the Wearer of the Blue Clothes.

In another case, one of the feudal princes, seeing that some mess had
been made in his courtyard, fell down in a fit of passion upon a
charcoal brazier, and was so badly burnt that he died. Five chariots
with their teams of horses, together with five men, were buried alive in
his honour. The historian quaintly adds that his death was due, partly
to his violent temper and partly to his love of cleanliness.

A writer of the fourth century B.C. relates how and when the custom of
burying alive became unpopular with the Chinese people.

"A certain man having died, his wife and steward took counsel together
as to who should be buried with him. All was settled before the arrival
of his brother (a well-known disciple of Confucius); and then they
informed him, saying, 'We must ask you to go down with the body into the
grave.' 'Burial of the living with the dead,' replied the brother, 'is
not in accordance with established rites. Still, as you say that someone
is wanted to attend upon the deceased, who better fitted than his wife
and steward?

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> If this
contingency can be avoided altogether, I am willing; but if not, then
the duty will devolve upon you two.' From that time forth the custom
fell into desuetude."

In spite of this last statement, we know that at the grand funeral of
the so-called First Emperor, in B.C. 210, all his concubines were buried
alive in the magnificent mausoleum where his body was laid, as well as
all the workmen who had constructed it and knew the secret of its
treasures; the workmen, of course, not from any religious motive.

To return to natural phenomena, which have at all times entered very
largely into the religious beliefs of the Chinese, and may be said to do
so even at the present day, when gongs and cymbals are still beaten to
prevent a great dog from swallowing the sun or moon at eclipse time.
There is a passage in the Canon of History which is understood, no doubt
rightly, to refer to an eclipse. The two Grand Astronomers, appointed
under the Emperor Yao, had been neglecting their duties and giving way
to intemperance. Then there suddenly occurred what we may call a
"celestial failure"; the blind musicians beat their drums; officials and
people hurried wildly about; while the two Grand Astronomers behaved
like mere impersonators of the dead. Grand Astronomers had in those days
an uneasy billet; the penalty for antedating or postdating an eclipse
was, in both cases, death.

Eclipses are only mentioned once in the Odes, at a very early date,
which has been carefully verified.

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The term used was
then composed of the word "eat," and either "sun" or "moon," as
required. On the 29th of August, B.C. 775, says an ode,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The sun was eclipsed  
A thing of very evil omen.  
First the moon looked small,  
And then the sun looked small.  
Henceforth the people  
Will be pitiable indeed.  
The sun and moon presage evil  
By not keeping to their proper paths;  
All through the kingdom there is no government,  
Because good men are not employed.  
For the moon to be eclipsed Is a small matter;  
But now that the sun has been eclipsed,  
How dreadful is that!</span>

</div>

On the 20th April, B.C. 610, another eclipse of the sun took place. This
is not the first instance recorded in the "Springs and Autumns," but the
remarks of the commentary are more conveniently arranged for quotation.
The writer says, "On the occasion of an eclipse of the sun, the Son of
Heaven should not have his table spread so lavishly as usual, and should
have drums beaten at the altar to the spirits of the land, while the
feudal princes should present offerings of silk to the spirits of the
land and have drums beaten at their courts, thus manifesting their own
service of the spirits and so teaching the people to serve their rulers,
according to the respective rights of each, as was customary in ancient
days."

It is obvious that an eclipse was regarded as a threatening notification
from on high, vague though

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

the message may have been. Still more so was this the case with comets,
of which a large number have been recorded in Chinese history. In B.C.
524 a comet appeared, travelling eastward towards the Milky Way. An
official said, "This is a broom, to sweep away the old and give us new.
God often makes use of such signs. The feudal princes will suffer from
calamities by fire." It was then suggested to the Prime Minister of the
Chêng State that the danger should be averted, so far as Chêng was
concerned, by offering, presumably to God, valuable goblets of jade and
some other precious stone; but this proposal was rejected.

Drought had always been regarded as a divine visitation, and sacrifices
and prayers for rain were as common in ancient days as they are at
present. In B.C. 637 there was a serious drought in the Lu State. The
reigning prince wished to burn a witch as a propitiatory sacrifice; but
a minister said, "No, that is not a proper course to take. Rather put
your city walls into good repair; spend less on your table, and be
economical in your general expenditure. Exalt thrift and urge the people
to help one another. That is the right course to take. What has a witch
to do with the matter? If God now wishes her to die, why did He ever
give her life? If she can really produce drought, to burn her will only
increase the calamity." The witch's life was spared, and that year there
was not great scarcity of food.

Famines were divided into five classes of intensity, based upon the
number of the five kinds of grain

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

which happened to be affected. A famine of the worst kind, when all the
five grains were more or less ruined by drought, entailed various
inconveniences upon the prince. From another commentary by another
writer (Ku-liang) we learn that he should not be served with two dishes
at once, nor renew the plaster on his towers and terraces; that he
should discontinue his archery feasts, and leave the road to the archery
ground uncared for; that certain offices should be maintained, but
nothing done in them; and that the spirits should be prayed to, but no
sacrifices offered.

Floods, the result of too much rain, were naturally as much dreaded as
drought. In B.C. 681 there were bad floods in the Sung State. The prince
of Lu was sent to condole, saying, "God has visited cruel rains upon
you, which will lessen your supply of millet for sacrifice. I cannot but
offer you my sympathy." "I am an orphan," was the reply, "and wanting in
reverence; therefore God has sent this calamity upon me. For the sorrow
I have caused you, I beg to express my regrets." It is added that the
use of the term "orphan" is proper for the ruler of a State which is
overtaken by misfortune, but no further explanation is given. The
reference is probably to the alienation of God, his father.

Locusts have always been one of the plagues of China, and there is quite
a literature on the various methods for getting rid of this pest. In
B.C. 623 we are told that locusts fell from the sky like rain, being,
happily, killed by the fall. The annals of China contain

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

entries of many extraordinary rains, such as blood, gold, millet, hair,
grass, pieces of flesh, ashes, earth, pigs, fishes, beans, frogs, paper
money, iron, and other things. We know now that some of these entries
are anything but ridiculous, being easily explained by the action of
whirlwinds, which pick up at one spot and drop at another, too far off
for the limited communications available in early years. One night in
September 1912—I am quoting from the *London and China Telegraph*—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Hundreds of Chinese in Shanghai profoundly believed that a miracle was
happening before their eyes. It rained rice, which fell in little
showers, and from 10 o'clock until long after midnight groups of natives
were on hands and knees scraping over roadways and gutters for a grain
or two. The remarkable phenomenon is explained by the typhoon which has
just touched on Shanghai. It is suggested that the typhoon destroyed a
granary, the grains of rice being whirled high up in the heavens,
carried by strong currents to distant places, falling as the force of
the winds abated.

</div>

Raining blood, too, has been satisfactorily accounted for by the
presence of a red secretion, chiefly from the pupal chrysalis of a
certain butterfly (genus *Vanessa*); as to several of the other entries,
we may follow the Confucian maxim: "Hear much, and put aside those
points on which you are in doubt."

Earthquakes were very naturally supposed to proceed from supernatural
agencies. One writer says, "It is the way of the earth to be still; its
moving was accounted strange, and was therefore recorded."

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Another declares
that an earthquake is "nature's response to prevailing disorder in the
kingdom, the feudal princes disobedient to the Son of Heaven, and their
officers disobedient to them." When, therefore, in B.C. 518, a high
official perished in a severe shock, it was simply remarked that God had
done with him. He was killed, as he might equally well have been killed
for his misdeeds, at a later date, by thunder. I say "at a later date,"
for it does not appear from any of the older books of the Canon that
thunder, though dreaded, was used either by or on behalf of God as an
instrument of punishment for the wickedness of man. We shall return to
this in another connexion.

Among other natural phenomena which the Chinese regard with uncertainty
and fear, must be classed the rainbow. The literati of China have not
been able to make much out of it, and confine themselves to saying that
its appearance is due to some irregularity in nature. It is of evil
omen, and portends fighting. Two lines in the Odes say,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">There is a rainbow in the east;  
Do not venture to point at it.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> For pointing at a
rainbow is thought to produce sores on the hands. No one can say
precisely who is offended by the act of pointing; whether it be the
Deity Himself, or some spirit, good or evil, who may be appointed to the
stewardship of rainbows.

Here we may, perhaps opportunely, devote some attention to the term
"spirit," which has been so frequently used in reference to beings, if
not of another

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

world like ours, as the Chinese now believe, at any rate of an unseen
world. In all ages, spirits have been divided by the Chinese into two
classes, good and bad spirits, otherwise known as spirits and devils.
Departed heroes, and personal relatives and friends, supply the former
class, but it is not so easy to show how the latter came into existence.
It is a mere guess to say that they are the souls of wicked persons;
there is no authority for such a statement, except in the case of
wandering spirits from the unburied corpses of wicked persons. However
this may be, it has always been understood that diseases are brought
about by evil spirits; more than this, a disease is actually personified
as an evil spirit, and is exorcised from a patient, or driven from a
village, by incantations, clanging of gongs, and similar ceremonies. We
read in the commentary, B.C. 541, that when a certain feudal prince was
ill, the divining officer declared that his disease was caused by two
spirits, of whom the Grand Augur had never heard. However, the Prime
Minister of a friendly State, who had come with "kind inquiries," showed
that the two spirits in question presided over a star and a district
respectively, and were necessarily harmless. "The spirits of the hills
and streams," he explained, "are sacrificed to in times of flood,
drought, and pestilence. The spirits of the sun, moon, and stars are
sacrificed to on the unseasonable occurrence of snow, hoar-frost, wind,
or rain. Your Highness must be suffering from something connected with
your outgoings or incomings, with your food, with your

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

griefs or joys. What can these spirits of the mountains and stars have
to do with it?"

Nothing, indeed, as matters turned out; the disease was traced to the
fact that four of the ladies of the harem bore the same surname as the
prince himself. Marriage between persons of the same surname has always,
with certain special exceptions, been forbidden in China; in this case
it was held that the rule extended to relations with concubines as well.

Already, as we have seen, the worship of God and of the departed spirits
of human beings had been enlarged to include spirits assigned to such
inanimate objects as hills and trees. In B.C. 563 a feudal prince, bent,
as usual, upon a marauding expedition, had occasion to cross the Yellow
River. There was a pause; two pairs of jade tablets were bound together
by a thread of red silk, and a prayer was offered up, showing the
supposed righteousness of the campaign, and closing with these words:
"If the enterprise be crowned with success, there will be no disgrace
attaching to you, O ye spirits of the river. Do you, therefore, decide."
Then the jade was dropped into the stream, and the prince crossed over.

In all worship of spirits, faith was the essential. We have the record
of a minister explaining to his prince that a small State could only
contend against a large State if the former were governed according to
the rule of right, while the latter was abandoned to wild excesses.
"What I mean," he said, "by rule of right is a loyal care for the people
on the part of

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

the authorities, and faith in the spirits on the part of the priests and
augurs. Just now, our people are famishing; the prince gives way to his
passions, and the priests are but hypocrites in their performance of the
sacrifices." To this the prince replied that his sacrificial animals
were of the best kind and well fattened, and that the millet he used was
good and abundant. "Where," he inquired, "is there any lack of faith?"
"The spirits," rejoined the minister, "consider the welfare of the
people first, and religious ceremonial second. Consequently, when our
virtuous rulers of old offered up fat animals, it meant that their
people were fat also; the spirits showered blessings upon them, and they
were successful in all their undertakings."

Good spirits are usually regarded as invisible, though instances have
been known, in more modern times, of spirits mixing with ordinary
people, and being distinguishable only by the fact that their apparent
bodies cast no shadow. Evil spirits, in the form of horrid goblins, have
often been seen in China as elsewhere. In 660 B.C. a spirit actually
came down—"came down" are the words used—and settled in the Kuo State.
The suzerain, or king of the Chow State, asked his Grand Augur what this
arrival might portend; to which the Augur made the following reply: When
the prosperity of a State is increasing, good spirits come down to take
note of its virtuous administration; similarly, when a State is about to
perish, spirits also come down to watch its evil administration. So that
the arrival of spirits

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

has sometimes been followed by prosperity, sometimes by the reverse."
The king then commissioned his Augur to proceed to the Kuo State,
bearing the proper offerings to the spirit. There the Augur heard that
the prince of Kuo was trying to get the spirit to grant him an
enlargement of territory, of course at some other State's expense. The
spirit stayed in the Kuo State for six months; and after receiving many
prayers and sacrifices, finally promised the coveted accession of
territory. Thereupon, the Augur predicted the downfall of the Kuo State,
saying, "I have heard that when the prosperity of a country is
increasing, it is because the prince gives ear to the people; and that
when a State is about to perish, it is because the prince gives ear to
spirits."

It would be of surpassing interest to know exactly what was in the minds
of the ancient Chinese when they spoke of spirits, and especially what
was the exact connotation of the phrase "came down" as applied to
spirits. Where did they come down from, and what was the nature of the
place they left by so coming, and of its other inhabitants? Were they
attendants upon God, in a state of happiness, and subject to His
commandments? We know from a passage in the commentary, that under the
Chow dynasty, as already mentioned, God took precedence of all spirits,
including that of Hou Chi, the divine founder of the House of Chow. Let
us now see what more the commentary may have to divulge on the shadowy
question of the soul.

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

In B.C. 542 there died a wild, hard-drinking individual, named Po-yu,
who had been obliged to flee from his home for political reasons which
are of no importance here. Some few years later, a report spread about
that Po-yu was alive and had been seen by several persons, to whom he
had used threatening remarks about others. This created a small panic;
so that when people met together, if anyone said, "Here's Po-yu!" there
would be a general stampede in all directions, "no one quite knowing,"
as the commentary tells us, "where he was going to." The excitement
reached its climax when one of the threatened persons died; then the
Prime Minister intervened, and made arrangements by which the fears of
the populace were allayed. He explained that if a disembodied spirit has
a place to go to, it does not become an evil spirit," and that he had
now provided a proper refuge for Po-yu's spirit, thereby bringing the
manifestations to an end. Later on, he was asked if he really believed
that Po-yu could become a disembodied spirit; in other words, if he
believed in spirits at all. "It is quite possible," he replied. "When a
man is born, what he first develops is called *p‘o* (answering to what
is now known as the supraliminal soul); then follows the male, or
positive, of the *p‘o*, which is called *hun* (the subliminal soul). By
drawing from its environment what is essential, this joint soul becomes
strong, and finally active. With regard to the manifestations of
spirits, if an ordinary man or woman dies, this joint soul can still
keep hanging about in the form

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

of an evil apparition; still more would this be so in the case of such a
man as Po-yu."

Thus we have, five hundred years before Christ, a simple statement that
there was such a thing as a soul, that it was of a twofold character,
and could remain in the world after the death and disappearance of the
body to which it had belonged. How this view was further expanded in
scope as time went on, and overlaid with a variety of fantastic beliefs,
will be more appropriately dealt with when we come to a later period of
religious development in China.

In addition to the chief commentary on the "Springs and Autumns," from
which most of the above details have been gleaned, two other
commentaries of considerable, but not of such surpassing value have come
down to us. There is a short note on "Praying for Rain " by one of these
commentators (already mentioned), named Ku-Jiang, which is perhaps worth
quoting. "Prayers for rain should be offered up in spring and summer
only; not in autumn or winter. Why not in autumn or winter? Because the
moisture of growing things is not then exhausted; neither has man
reached the limit of his skill. Why in spring and summer? Because time
is then pressing, and man's skill is of no further avail. How so?
Because without rain just then, nothing could be made to grow; the crops
would fail, and famine would ensue. But why wait until time is pressing,
and man's skill is of no further avail? Because prayers for rain are the
same as asking a favour, and the ancients did not lightly ask favours.
Why so? Because they

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

held it more blessed to give than to receive; and as the latter excludes
the former, the main object of man's life is taken away. How is praying
for rain asking a favour? It is a request that God will do something for
us. The inspired men of old who had any request to make to God were
careful to prefer it in due season. At the head of all his high officers
of state, the prince would proceed in person to offer up his prayer. He
could not ask anyone else to go as his proxy." The idea here seems to
be, and this will be borne out by an example to be cited later on, that
improper or unseasonable requests are not to be preferred to God. A
native critic adds, "If we are not to ask favours of God, how much less
may we ask them of one another. Persons who recklessly ask favours
should not be treated with the consideration to which they would
otherwise be entitled."

So far we have reviewed in a desultory way—perhaps the only possible
way—two important ages in Chinese history: (1) the age of the early, and
more or less legendary Emperors, who first ruled, and finally misruled
the empire from the beginning of the third to nearly the end of the
second millennium B.C.; and (2) the feudal age, from 1122 B.C. down to,
roughly speaking, the middle of the sixth century B.C. The feudal age
did not, indeed, come to an end at that date; there were still a couple
of centuries and more to run before the Chow dynasty collapsed under the
overwhelming power of one of the feudal States, the ruler of which
became, as he styled himself, the First Emperor of a united China,
meaning that "the great

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

procession of the centuries was to begin again" from his reign. The
reason why our second period has to end when it does, is that the
continuance of the Chow dynasty, or feudal age, amid scenes of rivalry
and bloodshed which gained for its last century and a half the
distinctive title of the age of the "Fighting States," is of no account
whatever as compared with the appearance on the scene of a man who for
twenty-five centuries past has been the guiding star of the Chinese
people, and whose influence, temporarily obscured during the great
political crisis of recent days, is now likely to continue to mould the
lives and destinies of his countrymen.
