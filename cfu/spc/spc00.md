In the early centuries of the Christian Era, when Buddhism was well
established in China, the priests held a conference here and concluded
that the Old Patriarch should be appointed as the last of the
patriarchs, and they separated into the Provinces.

This historic spot is about five miles south of Kiukiang, near the foot
of the lofty *Lii* Mountains, close by the road that leads to Kuling.
