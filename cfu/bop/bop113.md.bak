<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>To the top of that
tree-clad hill I go,  
  And towards my father I gaze,  
Till with my mind's eye his form I espy,  
  And my mind's ear hears how he says:  
"Alas for my son on service abroad!  
  He rests not from morning till eve.  
May he careful be, and come back to me!  
  While he is away, how I grieve!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>To the top of that
barren hill. I climb,  
  And towards my mother I gaze,  
Till with my mind's eye her form I espy,  
  And my mind's ear hears how she says:  
"Alas for my child on service abroad!  
  He never in sleep shuts an eye.  
May he careful be, and come back to me!  
  In the wild may his body not lie!" <span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Up the lofty ridge
I, toiling, ascend,  
  And towards my brother I gaze,  
Till with my mind's eye his form I espy,  
  And my mind's ear hears how he says:  
"Alas! my young brother, serving abroad,  
  All day with his comrades must roam.  
May he careful be, and come back to me,  
  And die not away from his home!"
