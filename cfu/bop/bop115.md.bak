#### VI

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Fa T‘an;* allusive. Against the idle and greedy ministers of the
state. Contrast between them and a stalwart woodman.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>*K‘an-k‘an* upon
the sandal trees  
  The woodman's strokes resound.  
Then on the bank he lays the trunks  
  His ax brings to the ground;  
The while the stream goes rippling by,  
  Its waters cool and clear.  
You work not so, O Wei's great men,  
  From me the truth now hear.  
You sow no seed; no harvest tasks  
  Your soft hands take in charge;  
And yet each boasts three hundred farms,  
  And stores the produce large.  
You never join the hunt's halloo,  
  Nor dare to share its toils;  
Yet lo! your wide courtyards are seen  
  Hung round with badgers' spoils.  
I must conclude that woodman rude  
  A man of higher style.  
To eat the bread of idleness  
  He feels would stamp him vile. <span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>*K‘an-k‘an* upon
the sandalwood  
  The woodman's strokes resound,  
Then by the river's side he lays  
  What fit for spokes is found;  
The while the river onward flows,  
  Its waters clear and smooth.  
You work not so, O Wei's great men,  
  From me now hear the truth.—  
You sow no seed; no harvest tasks  
  Your dainty fingers stain;  
And yet each boasts three million sheaves;—  
  Whence gets he all that grain?  
You never join the hunt's halloo,  
  Nor brave its ventures bold;  
Yet lo! your wide courtyards display  
  Those boars of three years old.  
I must conclude that woodman rude  
  A man of higher style.  
To eat the bread of idleness  
  He feels would stamp him vile. <span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>*K‘an-k‘an*
resound the woodman's strokes  
  Upon the sandalwood;  
Then on the river's lip he lays  
  What for his wheels is good;  
The while the river onward flows,  
  Soft rippled by the wind.  
That you don't work, O Wei's great men,  
  Is thus brought to my mind.  
You sow no seed; no harvest tasks  
  Your soft hands undertake;  
Yet grain each boasts, three hundred bins;—  
  Who his that grain did make?  
You never join the hunt's halloo,  
  Your feeble courage fails;  
Yet lo! your wide courtyards display  
  Large strings of slaughtered quails.  
I must conclude that woodman rude  
  A man of higher style.  
To eat the bread of idleness  
  He feels would stamp him vile.
