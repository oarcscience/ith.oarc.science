#### XIX

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ch‘u Ch‘i Tung Mên;* narrative. A man's praise of his own poor
wife, contrasted with flaunting beauties.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>My path forth from
the east gate lay,  
Where cloudlike moved the girls at play.  
Numerous are they, as clouds so bright,  
But not on them my heart's thoughts light. <span id="page_102">p.
102</span>  
Dressed in a thin white silk, with coiffure gray,  
Is she, my wife, my joy in life's low way.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>  Forth by the
covering wall's high tower,  
  I went, and saw, like rush in flower,  
  Each flaunting girl. Brilliant are they,  
  But not with them my heart's thoughts stay.  
In thin white silk, with headdress madder-dyed,  
Is she, my sole delight, ’foretime my bride.

</div>
