#### VII

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Chieh Nan Shan;* allusive and narrative. A lamentation over the
miserable state of the kingdom, denouncing the injustice and
carelessness of Grand Master Yin as the cause of it, and the conduct of
the king.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>That southern
hill, sublime, uprears its craggy height;  
Such thou, Grand Master Yin, before the nation's sight!  
Burning with inward grief, none name thee even in jest;  
Ruin impends, but thou delay’st the needed quest. <span id="page_236">p.
236</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Sublime that
southern hill, with vegetation grand!  
More awful thou, great Yin, whom as unjust we brand.  
With pestilence and death, Heaven aids disorder's sway;  
A silent nation frowns;—*thou* changest not thy way!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>On Yin our Chou
depends. By justice he should bind  
Our many states in one, with no disloyal mind,  
And guide the people right, thus helpful to the king.  
O cruel Heaven, that he such woes on all should bring!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>In him, himself
inert, the people put no trust.  
He, treacherous, from place and council keeps the just. <span
id="page_237">p. 237</span>  
Mean men, unfairly screened, the common weal destroy,  
And his vile relatives the highest posts enjoy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>Great Heaven,
unjust, the land exhausts with all these pains.  
Great Heaven, unkind, these woes upon it ceaseless rains.  
Oh! were the good in power, men's hearts would be at peace!  
And ’neath impartial rule, our wranglings soon would cease.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>O great unpitying
Heaven, our troubles have no close!  
With every month they grow; men's minds know no repose.  
My heart with grief is drunk. What weak hand holds the reins? <span
id="page_238">p. 238</span>  
’Tis Yin's supineness that augments the people's pains.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7">7</span></span>I yoke my steeds
long-necked, and through the land I hie.  
From the distress on every side vain the attempt to fly!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8">8</span></span>Here evil rampant
bares the spear;—they fight with rage,  
Then pacified and friends, in revel they engage.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_9">9</span></span>This is from
Heaven unjust. Our king has no repose.  
Infatuate Yin rejects all counselors as foes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span>This song by me,
Chia-fu, the king's sad case relates.  
Would he but change his heart, and nurse the myriad states!
