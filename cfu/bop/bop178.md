<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>The fishers of the
south for barbel make  
Sharp search, and many with their baskets take.  
The host his noble guests has gathered here;  
They drink with him, and joyous share his cheer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The barbel of the
south are largely caught  
In wicker nets, which then to land are brought.  
The host has round him called each noble guest;  
They drink with him, delighted with the feast.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>The southern trees
with drooping branches grow,  
Round which the sweet gourds clasp and twine below.  
His noble guests around the host we see;  
They drink with him, and feast in cheerful glee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>About the filial
doves incessant fly;  
Flock follows flock, in wheeling circles high.  
The noble guests long at their cups remain;  
They freely drink, and then they drink again.

</div>
