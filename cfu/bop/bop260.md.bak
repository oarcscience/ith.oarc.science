#### VII

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Chiung Cho;* allusive. The most unlikely things may by human
ingenuity be made useful; how much more should a sovereign fulfill the
duties of his position!

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Bring water from
the distant pool,  
  And let it settle in a jar.  
Millet or rice ’twill steam—such use  
  May come from things that paltry are.  
You are our happy, courteous king;  
  On you a noble duty lies.  
Father and mother, joined in one,  
  With all the people sympathize!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Bring water from
the distant pool,  
  And let it settle in a jar.  
A spirit vase ’twill wash;—such use  
  May come from things that paltry are.  
You are our happy, courteous king,  
  Born subject to a noble law.  
Like center to which all should turn,  
  So you the people ever draw. <span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Bring water from
the distant pool,  
  And let it settle in a jar.  
All things ’twill serve to cleanse;—such use  
  May come from things that paltry are.  
You are our happy, courteous king,  
  Set to fulfill a noble end.  
The center in which all have rest,  
  The people's hearts to you should tend.

</div>
