<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_2">2</A></FONT></span>Our hunting cars were light and good,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Each with its team of noble steeds.<br> Still further east we took the way<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To Fu mere's grassy plains that leads.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_3">3</A></FONT></span>Loud-voiced, the masters of the chase<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Arranged the huntsmen, high and low. <a name="page_220"><font size="1" color="green">p. 220</font></A><br> While banners streamed, and oxtails flew,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;We sought the prey on distant Gaou.</p>
