<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Sweet was the
scene. The spreading dolichos  
Extended far, down to the valley's depths,  
With leaves luxuriant. The orioles  
Fluttered around, and on the bushy trees <span id="page_3">p. 3</span>  
In throngs collected,—whence their pleasant notes  
Resounded far in richest melody.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The spreading
dolichos extended far,  
Covering the valley's sides, down to its depths,  
With leaves luxuriant and dense. I cut  
It down, then boiled, and from the fibers span  
Of cloth, both fine and coarse, large store,  
To wear, unwearied of such simple dress.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Now back to my old
home, my parents dear  
To see, I go. The matron I have told,  
Who will announcement make. Meanwhile my clothes,  
My private clothes I wash, and rinse my robes.  
Which of them need be rinsed? and which need not?  
My parents dear to visit, back I go.
