#### IV

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Hsia Ch‘üan;* metaphorical and allusive. The misery and
misgovernment of Ts‘ao makes the writer think of Chou and of its former
vigor and prosperity.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Down from the
spring the chilling waters pass,  
And overflow the bushy wolf-tail grass;—  
  Fit emblem of our state unblest. <span id="page_167">p. 167</span>  
In the dark night, restless, I wake and sigh,  
And to my thoughts Chou's capital comes nigh,  
  When through its kings the land had rest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The bushy
southernwood is flooded o’er,  
By the cold waters from that spring which pour;—  
  Fit emblem of our state unblest.  
In the dark night, restless, I wake and sigh,  
And to my thoughts Chou's capital comes nigh,  
  When through its kings the land had rest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>The bushy plants,
whose stalks serve to divine  
Beneath the waters of that cold spring pine;—  
  Fit emblem of our state unblest.  
In the dark night, restless, I wake and sigh,  
And to my thoughts Chou's capital comes nigh,  
  When through its kings the land had rest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Of old there fell
the fertilizing rains,  
And brightly shone the millet on our plains;—  
  The land knew no oppression hard.  
The states the king's authority obeyed,  
And to each lord, for loyal service paid,  
  The chief of Hsün dispensed reward.
