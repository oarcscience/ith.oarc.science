<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>By the stream in
the vale his hut he has reared,  
  That man tall and stout, looking free from all cares.  
He lives all alone; he sleeps, wakes, and then talks;—  
  And ne’er to forget what he prizes, he swears.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>In the bend of the
mound his hut he has reared,  
  That man tall and stout, gay and lightsome of heart.  
He lives all alone; he sleeps, wakes, and then sings;—  
  He swears from this spot he will never depart.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>There on that
level height his hut he has reared,  
  That man tall and stout, who himself so contains.  
He lives all alone; he sleeps, wakes, sleeps again;—  
  He swears he'll ne’er tell what in his mind reigns.
