The *Pai Hua;* metaphorical. The wife of King Yu complains of being
degraded and forsaken.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>The fibers of the
white-flowered rush  
  Are with the white grass bound.  
So do the two together go,  
  In closest union found.  
And thus should man and wife abide,  
  The twain combined in one;  
But this bad man sends me away,  
  And bids me dwell alone.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Both rush and
grass from the bright clouds  
  The genial dew partake.  
Kind and impartial, nature's laws  
  No odious difference make.  
But providence appears unkind;  
  Events are often hard.  
This man, to principle untrue,  
  Denies me his regard.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Northward the
pools their waters send,  
  To flood each paddy field;  
So get the fields the sap they need,  
  Their store of rice to yield. <span id="page_323">p. 323</span>  
But that great man no deed of grace  
  Deigns to bestow on me.  
My songs are sighs. At thought of him  
  My heart aches wearily.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>The mulberry
branches they collect,  
  And use their food to cook.  
But I must use a furnace small,  
  That pot nor pan will brook.  
So me that great man badly treats,  
  Nor uses as his wife,  
Degrades me from my proper place,  
  And fills with grief my life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>The bells and
drums inside the court  
  Men stand without and hear;  
So should the feelings in my breast,  
  To him distinct appear.  
All-sorrowful, I think of him,  
  Longing to move his love;  
But he vouchsafes no kind response;  
  His thoughts far from me rove.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>The marabou stands
on the dam,  
  And to repletion feeds; <span id="page_324">p. 324</span>  
The crane deep in the forest cries,  
  Nor finds the food it needs.  
So in my room the concubine  
  By the great man is placed;  
While I with cruel banishment  
  Am cast out and disgraced.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7">7</span></span>The yellow ducks
sit on the dam,  
  With left wing gathered low;  
So on each other do they lean,  
  And their attachment show.  
And love should thus the man and wife  
  In closest concord bind;  
But that man turns away from me,  
  And shows a fickle mind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8">8</span></span>When one stands on
a slab of stone,  
  No higher than the ground,  
Nothing is added to his height;—  
  Low with the stone he's found.  
So does the favorite's mean estate  
  Render that great man mean,  
While I by him, to distance sent,  
  Am pierced with sorrow keen.
