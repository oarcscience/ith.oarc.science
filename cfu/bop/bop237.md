<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Where lies the
ground both wet and low,  
The mulberry trees in beauty grow;—  
’Tis sweet to see their clust’ring leaves.  
Such pleasure in my bosom heaves, <span id="page_321">p. 321</span>  
When I the princely men descry;—  
To tell the joy ’twere vain to try.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Where lies the
ground both wet and low,  
The mulberry trees in beauty grow;—  
’Tis sweet to see their glossy leaves.  
Such pleasure in my bosom heaves.  
When I the princely men behold;—  
Then does my heart its joy unfold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Where lies the
ground both wet and low,  
The mulberry trees in beauty grow;—  
’Tis sweet to see their dark green leaves.  
Such pleasure in my bosom heaves,  
When lights upon those men my eye;—  
At their grand fame my heart throbs high.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>I cherish those
men in my heart.—  
Might not my words my love impart?  
No;—if the words were once but spoken,  
The charm of love might then be broken.  
The men shall dwell within my heart,  
Nor thence with lapse of time depart.

</div>
