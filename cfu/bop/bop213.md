<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ssŭ Yüeh;* allusive and narrative. An officer bitterly deplores the
oppression and misery of the time.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>In the fourth
month summer shines;  
In the sixth the heat declines.  
Nature thus grants men relief;  
Tyranny gives only grief.  
Were not my forefathers men?  
Can my suffering ’scape their ken?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>In the cold of
autumn days,  
Each plant shrivels and decays.  
Nature then is hard and stern;  
Living things sad lessons learn.  
Friends dispersed, all order gone,  
Place of refuge have I none.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Winter days are
wild and fierce;  
Rapid gusts each crevice pierce.  
Such is my unhappy lot,  
Unbefriended and forgot!  
Others all can happy be;  
I from misery never am free.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>On the mountains
are fine trees;  
Chestnuts, plum trees, there one sees.  
All the year their forms they show;  
Stately more and more they grow. <span id="page_272">p. 272</span>  
Noble turned to ravening thief!  
What the cause? This stirs my grief.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>Waters from that
spring appear  
Sometimes foul, and sometimes clear,  
Changing oft, as falls the rain,  
Or the sky grows bright again.  
New misfortunes every day  
Still befall me, misery's prey.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>Aid from mighty
streams obtained,  
Southern states are shaped and drained.  
Thus the Chiang and Han are thanked,  
And as benefactors ranked.  
Weary toil my vigor drains;  
All unnoticed it remains!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7">7</span></span>Hawks and eagles
mount the sky;  
Sturgeons in deep waters lie.  
Out of reach, they safety get,  
Arrow fear not, nor the net.  
Hiding place for me there's none;  
Here I stay, and make my moan.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8">8</span></span>Ferns upon the
hills abound;  
*Ch‘i* and *i* in marshy ground.  
Each can boast its proper place,  
Where it grows for use or grace.  
I can only sing the woe,  
Which, ill-starred, I undergo.
