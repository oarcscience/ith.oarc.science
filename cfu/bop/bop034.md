#### VI

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The Chi Ku; narrative. Soldiers of Wei bewail their separation from
their families, and anticipate that it will be final.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>List to the
thunder and roll of the drum!  
  See how we spring and brandish the dart!  
Some raise Ts‘ao’s walls; some do field work at home;  
  But we to the southward lonely depart.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Our chief, Sun
Tzŭ-chung, agreement has made,  
  Our forces to join with Chen and with Sung.  
When shall we back from this service be led?  
  Our hearts are all sad, our courage unstrung. <span id="page_32">p.
32</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Here we are
halting, and there we delay;  
  Anon we soon lose our high-mettled steeds.  
The forest's gloom makes our steps go astray;  
  Each thicket of trees our searching misleads.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>For death as for
life, at home or abroad,  
  We pledged to our wives our faithfulest word.  
Their hands clasped in ours, together we vowed,  
  We'd live to old age in sweetest accord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>This march to the
south can end but in ill;  
  Oh! never shall we our wives again meet.  
The word that we pledged we cannot fulfill;  
  Us home returning they never will greet.

</div>
