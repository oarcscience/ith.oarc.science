<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Where the grounds
are wet and low,  
There the trees of goat-peach grow,  
With their branches small and smooth,  
Glossy in their tender youth.  
Joy it were to me, O tree,  
Consciousness to want like thee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Where the grounds
are wet and low,  
There the trees of goat-peach grow.  
Soft and fragrant are their flowers,  
Glossy from the vernal showers.  
Joy it were to me, O tree,  
Ties of home to want like thee. <span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Where the grounds

There the trees of goat-peach grow.  
What delicious fruits they bear,  
Glossy, soft, of beauty rare!  
Joy it were to me, O tree,  
Household cares to want like thee.?
