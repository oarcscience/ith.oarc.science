XI

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Chiang Yu Ssŭ;* allusive. Jealousy cured; the restoration of good
feeling in a harem.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>See how the
Chiang's great branches flow,  
Here leave its stream, and there back go!  
When first our lady came as bride,  
She would not have us by her side.  
She would not have us by her side;  
But soon a better course she tried. <span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The islets part
the Chiang's broad course,  
Which soon resumes its wonted force.  
When first as bride our lady came,  
To be with us she thought it shame.  
To be with us she thought it shame;  
Erelong she knew she was to blame.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>The T‘o streams,
from the river led,  
Flow devious, and rejoin its bed.  
When first we saw our lady here,  
She would not deign us to come near.  
She would not deign us to come near;  
But to a song she changed her sneer.

</div>
