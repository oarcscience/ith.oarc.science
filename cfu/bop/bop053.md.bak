#### VI

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ting Chih Fang Chung;* narrative. The praise of Duke Wên: his
diligence, foresight, sympathy with the people, and prosperity.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>At dusk the *Ting*
star passed on to the west,  
And field work for the year was laid to rest.  
At Ch‘u the duke his palace took in hand, <span id="page_54">p.
54</span>  
And by the sun fixed how its walls should stand.  
All round about he planted many a tree,—  
Hazels and chestnuts, *t‘ung* and *tzŭ*, and *i*,  
And varnish trees. The grove would yield erelong  
Abundant wood for lutes, to aid the voice of song.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>He climbed those
ruined walls, thence to inspect  
The site he wished for Ch‘u-ch‘iu to select.  
His glance the land from Ch‘u to T‘ang mapped out  
Noting the hills and smaller heights about,  
He then came down, the mulberry trees to view,  
And judged the soil, and learned its nature true.  
These things once done, he asked the tortoise shell,  
Answer auspicious got,—and all succeeded well.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Thereafter, when
there fell the copious showers,  
He often called his groom, and in the hours  
Of early dawn afield by starlight drove  
Among the laborers, and to cheer them strove.  
And many ways he had, not this alone,  
In which his character distinguished shone,  
To duty bound, assiduous in his cares;—  
And blessing came,—three thousand steeds and mares.
