<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ch‘i Ao;* allusive. The praise of Duke Wu—his assiduous cultivation
of himself; his dignity; his accomplishments.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>How rich the
clumps of green bamboo,  
  Around each cove of Ch‘i!  
They lead my thoughts to our Duke Wu;—  
  Of winning grace is he!  
As knife and file make smooth the bone,  
As jade by chisel wrought and stone,  
  Is stamp upon him set.  
Grave and of dignity serene;  
With force of will as plainly seen;  
Accomplished, elegant in mien;  
  Him we can ne’er forget.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Strong grow the
clumps of green bamboo,  
  Around each cove of Ch‘i.  
They lead my thoughts to our Duke Wu;—  
  Of winning grace is he!  
His ear plugs are of pebbles fine; <span id="page_61">p. 61</span>  
And gems like stars bright glittering shine,  
  All o’er his cap of state.  
Grave and of dignity serene;  
With force of will as plainly seen;  
Accomplished, elegant in mien;  
  Him we can ne’er forget.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>How thick the
clumps of green bamboo,  
  Around each cove of Ch‘i.  
They lead my thoughts to our Duke Wu;—  
  Of winning grace is he!  
Pure as the finest tin or gold,  
And as the scepter princes hold  
  So strong, while mild in mood!  
See him in car with lofty side,  
Magnanimous and free from pride.  
His words to jest are oft allied,  
  But never are they rude.
