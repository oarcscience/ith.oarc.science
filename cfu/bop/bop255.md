#### II

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Hsing Wei;* allusive and narrative. A festal ode, celebrating some
entertainment given by the king to his relatives, with the trial of
archery after the feast; celebrating especially the honor done on such
occasions to the aged.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>See how the rushes
spring  
  Thickly along the way!  
Ye browsing herds, no foot  
  Upon those rushes lay!  
Grown to their height erelong,  
  They soft and rich shall shine.  
Close as the rushes grow,  
  Should brethren all combine. <span id="page_363">p. 363</span>  
Let all at feast appear,  
  None absent, none thought mean.  
Mats for the young be spread!  
  On stools let elders lean!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Lo! double mats
are spread,  
  And stools are featly set.  
Servants in waiting stand;  
  See host and guests are met.  
He pledges them; they him;  
  He drinks; again they fill.  
Sauces and pickles come,  
  Roast meat and broiled; and still  
Palates and tripe are brought.  
  Then lutes and drums appear.  
Singers fine concord make;—  
  The joyous feasters hear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>The feasting o’er,
from bow,  
  Lacquered and strong and bright,  
Four well-poised shafts each sends,  
  That in the target light. <span id="page_364">p. 364</span>  
The guests are ranged as they  
  The mark have nearest hit.  
They shoot again; the shafts  
  Are fairly lodged in it.  
Their bearing then is judged;  
  Each takes his final place,  
As mild propriety  
  Has round him thrown its grace.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>The long-descended
king  
  Presides, and ends the feast.  
With spirits sweet and strong  
  From vase he cheers each guest.  
And for the old he prays,  
  While all with rapture glow,  
That they the wrinkled back  
  And whitening hair may show;  
Striving with mutual help  
  In virtue's onward ways,  
And brightest happiness  
  Thus crown their latest days.
