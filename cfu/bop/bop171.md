<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ch‘u Ch‘ê*; narrative. An ode of congratulation, on the return of
the troops from the expedition against the Hsien-yün.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>  Forth from the
city in our cars we drove,  
    Until we halted at the pasture ground.  
  The general came, and there with ardor strove  
    A note of zeal throughout the host to sound.  
    "Direct from court I come, by orders bound  
  The march to hasten;"—it was thus he spake.  
    Then with the carriage officers around,  
  He strictly charged them quick dispatch to make:—  
"Urgent the king's affairs, forthwith the field we take."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>  While there we
stopt, the second corps appeared,  
    And ’twixt us and the city took its place.  
  The guiding standard was on high upreared,  
    Where twining snakes the tortoises embrace,  
    While oxtails, crestlike, did the staff's top grace.  
  We watched the sheet unfolding grandly wave;  
    Each flag around showed falcons on its face.  
  With anxious care looked on our leader brave;  
Watchful the carriage officers appeared and grave. <span
id="page_199">p. 199</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>  Nan Chung, our
chief, had heard the royal call  
    To go where inroad by Hsien-yüns was made,  
  And ’cross the frontier build a barrier wall.  
    Numerous his chariots, splendidly arrayed!  
    The standards—this where dragons were displayed,  
  And that where snakes round tortoises were coiled  
    Terrific flew. "Northward our host," he said,  
  "Heaven's son sends forth to tame the Hsien-yün wild."  
Soon by this awful chief would all their tribes be foiled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>  When first we
took the field, and northward went,  
    The millets were in flower;—a prospect sweet.  
  Now when our weary steps are homeward bent,  
    The snow falls fast, the mire impedes our feet.  
    Many the hardships we were called to meet,  
  Ere the king's orders we had all fulfilled.  
    No rest we had; often our friends to greet  
  The longing came; but vain regrets we stilled;  
By tablets stern our hearts with fresh resolve were thrilled. <span
id="page_200">p. 200</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>  "Incessant chirp
the insects in the grass;  
    All round about the nimble hoppers spring.  
  From them our thoughts quick to our husbands pass,  
    Although those thoughts our hearts with anguish wring.  
    Oh! could we see them, what relief ’twould bring!  
  Our hearts, rejoiced, at once would feel at rest."  
    Thus did our wives, their case deploring, sing;  
  The while our leader farther on had pressed,  
And smitten with his power the wild Jung of the west.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>  The spring days
now are lengthening out their light;  
    The plants and trees are dressed in living green;  
  The orioles resting sing, or wing their flight;  
    Our wives amid the southernwood are seen,  
    Which white they bring, to feed their silkworms keen.  
  Our host, returned, sweeps onwards to the hall,  
    Where chiefs are questioned, shown the captives mean.  
  Nan Chung, majestic, draws the gaze of all,  
Proud o’er the barbarous foe his victories to recall.
