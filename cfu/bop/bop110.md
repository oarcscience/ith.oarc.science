### <span class="smallcaps">Book IX. The Odes of Wei</span>

#### I

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ko Chü;* narrative. The extreme parsimoniousness even of wealthy
men in Wei.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Thin cloth of
dolichos supplies the shoes,  
  In which some have to brave the frost and cold.  
A bride, when poor, her tender hands must use,  
  Her dress to make, and the sharp needle hold.  
This man is wealthy, yet he makes his bride  
Collars and waistbands for his robes provide.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Conscious of
wealth, he moves with easy mien;  
  Politely on the left he takes his place;  
The ivory pin is at his girdle seen;  
  His dress and gait show gentlemanly grace.  
Why do we brand him in our satire here?  
’Tis this,—his niggard soul provokes the sneer.
