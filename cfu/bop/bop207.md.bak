#### IV

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ch‘iao Yen;* narrative, and allusive, with the metaphorical element
perhaps here and there. Some one, suffering from the king through
slander, appeals to Heaven, dwells on the nature and evil of slander,
and expresses his detestation of and contempt for the slanderers.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>O vast and distant
Heaven, whom we  
Father and mother call, on thee  
I cry. Say why these ills on me  
        Excessive fall.  
Oppressive, vast, my misery,  
        Though guiltless all!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The first small
lie contains the rest.  
When slanders fill our monarch's breast,  
Ills grow, and never are redressed.  
        Would he but trust  
The good, wrongs soon must be redressed.  
        I know they must. <span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>His frequent
covenants show him weak.  
Wrongs grow from cozening words they speak.  
He trusts the rogues that lie and sneak,  
        And make things worse.  
Their duties shirked, their words so meek  
        Prove but a curse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>With the great
work of some great mind;—  
A temple by true king designed,  
Or plans by sagest men outlined,  
        I'm in a fog.  
Round common schemes my way I wind,  
        Like hare and dog.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>As timber soft in
carver's hand  
Assumes the shape he may command,  
So common speech to understand,  
        I well may claim.  
Those talkers, flowing, artful, grand,  
        Are sons of shame. <span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>And who are they?
On yonder stream  
They dwell; and void of strength they seem.  
From men so bloated who would dream  
        Of martial force?  
Both they and theirs may madly scheme,  
        And fare the worse!

</div>
