#### VII

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Hung Yen;* allusive. The people, regathered into communities under
King Hsüan, praise the officers by whom this had been accomplished.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>With rustling
wings the wild geese fly,  
  Round fields long strange to hand of toil.  
Called by the officers in charge,  
  We labor on the desert soil.  
Sad is our state, but sadder still  
The hearts no wedded love can fill.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The wild geese fly
about, and light  
  Amid the marsh, where grain once shone.  
We rear the walls as we are told;—  
  Five thousand feet are quickly done  
Great is the toil, and sore the pain,  
But peaceful homes will rise again.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>The wild geese fly
with plaintive note,  
  That sadly suits our weary sighs.  
But those whose orders we obey,—  
  They see our pain; and they are wise.  
If they had not been men of sense,  
They had rebuked our insolence.

</div>
