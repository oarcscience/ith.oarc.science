#### VII

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ch‘ên Fêng;* allusive. A wife tells her grief because of the
absence of her husband, and his forgetfulness of her.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>The falcon swiftly
seeks the north,  
And forest gloom that sent it forth.  
Since I no more my husband see,  
My heart from grief is never free.  
O how is it, I long to know,  
That he, my lord, forgets me so? <span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Bushy oaks on the
mountain grow,  
And six elms where the ground is low.  
But I, my husband seen no more,  
My sad and joyless fate deplore.  
O how is it, I long to know,  
That he, my lord, forgets me so?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>The hills the
bushy wild plums show,  
And pear trees grace the ground below.  
But, with my husband from me gone,  
As drunk with grief, I dwell alone.  
O how is it, I long to know,  
That he, my lord, forgets me so?

</div>
