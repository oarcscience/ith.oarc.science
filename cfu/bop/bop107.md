#### IX

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Pi Kou;* metaphorical. The bold licentious freedom of Wên Chiang in
returning to Ch‘i;—against Duke Chuang of Lu, her son.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Rent is the basket
at the dam,  
  Where bream and kuan abound;  
As useless is the prince of Lu,  
  In vigor wanting found.  
Ch‘i’s daughter now to Chi comes back,  
  Her followers as a cloud;  
Her son should hold her fast in Lu,  
  Her wickedness to shroud.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Rent is the basket
at the dam,  
  Where bream and tench abound;  
As useless is the prince of Lu,  
  In vigor wanting found.  
Back comes Ch‘i’s daughter, with a shower  
  Of followers at her side, <span id="page_113">p. 113</span>  
Her son should hold her fast in Lu,  
  Her wanton ways to hide.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Rent is the basket
at the dam;  
  Fish in and out can go;  
As useless is the prince of Lu,  
  And vigor fails to show.  
Back comes Ch‘i’s daughter, with a stream  
  Of followers behind;  
Her son should hold her fast in Lu,  
  From such lewd ways confined.

</div>
