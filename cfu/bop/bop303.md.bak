<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Huan;* narrative. Celebrating the merit and success of King Wu.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

Throughout our myriad regions there is peace;  
  Year after year the plenteous harvest brings.  
Great Heaven in showing favors does not cease,  
  And will with blessing crown Chou's line of kings.  
The martial sovereign, Wu, the confidence  
  He won from all his officers retained.  
Their service would he through the realm dispense,  
  And for his house security thus gained.  
Oh! glorious was he in the sight of Heaven,  
By which to him the throne of Shang was given.

</div>
