#### I

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ch‘ing Miao;* narrative. Celebrating the reverential manner in
which a sacrifice to King Wên was performed, and further praising him.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

Solemn and pure the ancestral temple stands.  
  The princes aiding in the service move  
With reverent harmony. The numerous bands  
  Of officers their rapt devotion prove.  
All these the virtues of King Wên pursue;  
  And while they think of him on high in heaven,  
With grace and dignity they haste to do  
  The duties to them in his temple given.  
Glory and honor follow Wên's great name,  
  And ne’er will men be weary of his fame.

</div>
