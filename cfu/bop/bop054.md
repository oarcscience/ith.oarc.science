The *Ti Tung;* metaphorical and narrative. Against lewd connections.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>A rainbow in the
east invites the gaze,  
But none a finger to it dares to raise.  
All view it with dislike; but viler she,  
Who hastes to marry ’gainst propriety!  
When from their early homes young women go,  
Parents and brothers they nigh cease to know.  
Important rules for step like this are made,  
And to surly rules obedience should be paid.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>When rainbows in
the west at morn appear,  
By morning's close the sky from rain is clear;  
So fleeting are the joys of lawless love;  
Licentious pleasures evanescent prove.  
When from their early homes young women go,  
Parents and brothers they nigh cease to know.  
Important rules for step like this are made,  
And to such rules obedience should be paid.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Ah! think of this
young girl whose willful heart  
Is bent on marriage as her only part.  
She wrongs herself, to the right course untrue,  
Which every virtuous woman should pursue. <span id="page_56">p.
56</span>  
She blames her lot, and, wanton, will not own  
Heaven's ordering of it on the parents thrown.  
For marriage ties the wisest rules are made,  
And to such rules obedience should be paid.
