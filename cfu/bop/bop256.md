<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Chi Tsui;* narrative. Responsive to the last;—the uncles and
brothers of the king express their sense of his kindness, and their
wishes for his happiness, mostly in the words in which the personators
of the dead had conveyed the satisfaction of his ancestors with the
sacrifice offered to them and promised to him their blessing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>You gave us of the
brimming cup,  
  And crowned us with your grace.  
Great king, forever may you live  
  With brightening happiness!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>You gave us of the
brimming cup,  
  And dainty viands spread.  
May you, great king, forever live!  
  Your splendor never fade!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Yea, perfect may
your wisdom be,  
  Achieving its high aim!  
"First ends in last; last springs from first;—  
  Revealed, that message came. <span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>What said the
message from your sires?  
  "Vessels and gifts are clean;  
And all your friends, assisting you,  
  Behave with reverent mien.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>"Most reverently
you did your part,  
  And reverent by your side  
Your son appeared. On you henceforth  
  Shall ceaseless blessings bide.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>"What shall the
ceaseless blessing be?  
  That in your palace high  
For myriad years you dwell in peace,  
  Rich in posterity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7">7</span></span>"What of the sons
shall from you flow?  
  Through you, thus blessed of Heaven,  
Those myriad years of royal sway  
  Shall to your sons be given.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8">8</span></span>"And whence shall
come that lustrous race?  
  From your heroic wife.  
From her shall come the line of sons  
  To live again your life."
