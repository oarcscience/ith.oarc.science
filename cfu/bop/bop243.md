<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ho Ts‘ao Pu Huang;* allusive and narrative. The misery and
murmuring of soldiers constantly employed on expeditionary services, and
treated without any consideration.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Yellow now is all
the grass;  
All the days in marching pass.  
On the move is every man;  
Hard work, far and near, they plan. <span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span> Black is every
plant become;  
Every man is torn from home.  
Kept on foot, our state is sad;—  
As if we no feelings had!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Not rhinoceroses
we!  
Tigers do we care to be?  
Fields like these so desolate  
Are to us a hateful fate.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Long-tailed foxes
pleased may hide  
’Mong the grass, where they abide.  
We, in box carts slowly borne,  
On the great roads plod and mourn.

</div>
