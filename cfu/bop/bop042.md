#### XIV

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ch‘üan Shui;* allusive and narrative. A daughter of the house of
Wei, married in another state, expresses her longing to revisit Wei.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>As the streamlet
from its spring  
  Flows into the river Ch‘i,  
So my daily thoughts on wing <span id="page_42">p. 42</span>  
  Fly, my native Wei, to thee;  
For I long with cousins there  
Counsel sweet and love to share.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>For a night, at
Tzu I stayed;  
  Drank the cup to Ni when come;  
Parents, brothers, farewell bade;—  
  Such the fate on leaving home.  
Parents are not now alive;  
Aunts and sister still survive.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Lo! I hasten home
again,  
  Let the rushing chariot wheel  
Pause at Kan, and part at Yen,  
  Pebbles flashing to its steel.  
Does my heart go far astray,  
Panting for its native Wei?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>By the
Fei-ch‘üan’s winding stream  
  Daily sighing thought will stray.  
Hsü and Ts‘ao in memory gleam,  
  Broken glints of childhood's day.  
Spring, my horses! Speed, my wheels!  
Gone the grief my bosom feels!

</div>
