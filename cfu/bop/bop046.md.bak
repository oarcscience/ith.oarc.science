<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>The New tower,
fresh and bright, they show,  
Where its vast volume rolls the Ho;—  
    For bride a palace rare.  
To Wei she came, a mate to find;  
She sought a husband young and kind,  
    But found this misshaped bear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>There stands the
New tower grand and high,  
Where with still stream the Ho flows by;—  
    For bride a palace rare.  
To Wei she came, a mate to find;  
She sought a husband young and kind,  
    But found this misshaped bear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>As when the net
for fish they set,  
And lo! a goose ensnared they get,  
    They stamp with sudden ire;  
So might she stamp who came to wed  
The genial son, and in his stead  
    Got but the humpbacked sire.

</div>
