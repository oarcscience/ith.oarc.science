<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Wu I;* narrative. The people of Ch‘in declare their readiness, and
stimulate one another, to fight in the king's cause.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Say you you have
no clothes to wear?  
My long robes let me with you share.  
The king his armies has called out;  
Then let us hail the battle shout.  
My lance and spear I will prepare,  
And as your comrade with you fare. <span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Say you you have
no clothes to wear?  
Come and my undergarments share.  
The king his armies has called out;  
Then let us hail the battle shout.  
My spear and lance I will prepare,  
And to the field with you will fare.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Say you you have
no clothes to wear?  
My lower clothing you shall share.  
The king his armies has called out;  
Then let us hail the battle shout.  
Buff coat I'll get, and weapons keen,  
And with you on the march be seen.

</div>
