#### VIII

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Pao Yü;* allusive or metaphorical. The men of Chin, called out to
warfare by the king's order, mourn over the consequent suffering of
their parents, and long for their return to their ordinary agricultural
pursuits.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>The wild geese fly
the bushy oaks around,  
With clamor loud. *Su-su* their wings resound,  
As for their feet poor resting place is found. <span id="page_134">p.

The king's affairs admit of no delay;  
Our millets still unsown, we haste away.  
No food is left our parents to supply;  
When we are gone, on whom can they rely?  
O azure Heaven, that shinest there afar,  
When shall our homes receive us from the war?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The wild geese on
the bushy jujube trees  
Attempt to settle, and are ill at ease;—  
*Su-su* their wings go flapping in the breeze.  
The king's affairs admit of no delay;  
Our millets still unsown, we haste away.  
How shall our parents their requirements get?  
How in our absence shall their wants be met?  
O azure Heaven, that shinest there afar,  
When shall our homes receive us from the war?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>The bushy mulberry
trees the geese in rows  
Seek eager, and to rest around them close,—  
With rustling loud, as disappointment grows.  
The king's affairs admit of no delay;  
To plant our rice and maize we cannot stay.  
How shall our parents find their wonted food?  
When we are gone, who will to them be good?  
O azure Heaven, that shinest there afar,  
When shall our homes receive us from the war?
