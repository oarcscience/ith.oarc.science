<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Ta-jên was pure,
of rev’rent life,  
    From whom our King Wên sprang.  
Fit was she for his father's wife,  
    And well she loved Chou Chiang.  
Ta-ssŭ inherited her fame;  
Through her an hundred sons there came.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Wên formed himself
upon his sires,  
    Nor gave their spirits pain.  
Well pleased were they. Next he inspires  
    His wife. His brethren fain  
To follow were. In every state  
The chiefs on his example wait. <span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>In palace see
him,—bland, serene;  
    In fane, with rev’rent fear.  
Unseen by man, he felt still seen  
    By spirits always near.  
Unweariedly did he maintain  
His virtue pure, and free from stain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Some great
calamities there came,  
    Which he could not control.  
But none his generous aim might blame,  
    Nought darken his bright soul.  
Untaught, the right he ever saw;  
Reproof he needed not, nor law.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>Grown men through
him in virtue grew;  
    Young men attainments made.  
Aye to himself our prince was true,  
    Nor weariness displayed.  
His officers acquired great fame;  
To him they owed their deathless name.
