#### VI

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Hsiang Pai;* metaphorical, narrative, and allusive. A eunuch,
suffering from slander, complains of his fate, and warns and denounces
his enemies.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>A few fine lines,
at random drawn,  
Like the shell pattern wrought in lawn  
  To hasty glance will seem.  
My trivial faults base slander's slime  
Distorted into foulest crime,  
  And men me worthless deem.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>A few small
points, pricked down on wood,  
May be made out a picture good  
  Of the bright southern Sieve.  
Who planned, and helped those slanderers vile,  
My name with base lies to defile?  
  Unpitied, here I grieve.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>With babbling
tongues you go about,  
And only scheme how to make out  
  The lies you scatter round.  
Hear me.—Be careful what you say;  
People erelong your words will weigh,  
  And liars you'll be found.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Clever you are,
with changeful schemes!  
How else could all your evil dreams <span id="page_264">p. 264</span>  
  And slanders work their way?  
Men now believe you; by and by,  
The truth found out, each vicious lie  
  Will ill for ill repay.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>The proud rejoice;
the sufferer weeps.  
O azure Heaven, from out thy deeps  
  Why look in silence down?  
Behold those proud men and rebuke;  
With pity on the sufferers look,  
  And on the evil frown.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>Those slanderers I
would gladly take,  
With all who help their schemes to make,  
  And to the tigers throw.  
If wolves and tigers such should spare,  
I'd hurl them ’midst the freezing air,  
  Where the keen north winds blow.  
And should the north compassion feel  
I'd fling them to great Heaven, to deal  
  On them its direst woe.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7">7</span></span>As on the acred
heights *you* dwell,  
My place is in the willow dell,  
  One is the other near.  
Before you, officers, I spread  
These lines by me, poor eunuch, made.  
  Think not Mêng-tzŭ severe.
