#### III

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Mien;* metaphorical and narrative. The small beginnings and
subsequent growth of the house of Chou. Its removal from Pin under
T‘an-f u, and settlement in Chou, down to the time of King Wên.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>As grow the
gourds, with ever length’ning stem.  
From elder sires sprang ours, as we from them.  
When first by Chü and Ch‘i our people grew,  
And o’er them ruled the ancient Duke T‘an-fu,  
There kilnlike huts and caves for them he made,  
Ere any house its walls and roof displayed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The ancient Duke
T‘an-fu came with the morn,  
In car along the western rivers borne,  
Nor stayed his steeds, until he reached Mount Ch‘i.  
The Lady Chiang came in his company. <span id="page_339">p. 339</span>  
With eager eyes they traveled o’er the ground,  
To find a site on which a town to found.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>The plain of Chou,
with violets o’erspread  
And sonchus plants found sweet on such a bed,  
Lay wide and rich. He asked his men their mind,  
And by the scorched tortoise shell divined.  
Both answer gave:—"Now is the time and here!"  
His followers straight their homes began to rear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>He cheered them
on, and placed them on the land,  
On left and right their different sites he planned.  
Divisions, large and small, soon marked the plain,  
And channels, or to irrigate or drain.  
From east to west the acres he defined;  
Nought that was needed ’scaped his active mind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>He named two
officers who should preside  
O’er all these labors, and the people guide.  
These to direct the building work he calls;  
True to the plummet rise the many walls. <span id="page_340">p.
340</span>  
They bind the frame boards, till they stand aright,  
And rear th’ ancestral temple in its might.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>With earth in
baskets crowding workmen came,  
Which then with shouts they cast into the frame.  
There with responsive blows the earth they pound,  
And trim and pare until the walls are sound.  
At once, five thousand cubits long, these rise,  
The drum unheard amidst the toilers’ cries.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7">7</span></span>The palace next
they built. Its outer gate  
Arose with lofty and imposing state.  
The inner portal of the court they reared,  
With massive pomp. Anon, hard by, appeared  
The altar for the spirits of the land,  
Where the state's greatest movements should be planned.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8">8</span></span>Thus though his
foeman's rage he could not tame,  
T‘an-fu preserved and left a noble fame. <span id="page_341">p.
341</span>  
In time the oaks and thorns were cleared away,  
And roads for travelers opened to the day.  
The savage hordes of Hun all disappeared,  
Panting, and trembling at the name they feared.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_9">9</span></span>Then came King
Wên, and stirred to nobler life  
The chiefs of Joo and Juy, who ceased their strife.  
Some sought our prince, whom yet they had not seen;  
Some, led by those who at his court had been;  
Some came who dreaded his avenging arm;  
And some, who knew he screened the weak from harm.
