#### VII

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Nan Shan Yu T‘ai;* allusive. A festal ode, where the ruler, as the
host, celebrates the virtues of his ministers, who are the guests, and
supplicates blessings on them.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>  The southern
hills the *t‘ai* plant show,  
    The northern yield the *lai*.  
  Your presence here, my noble guests,  
    Fills me with rapture high.  
’Tis on your strength that all my states depend;  
Myriads of years be yours, years without end!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>  On southern
hills are mulberry trees,  
    On northern willows grow.  
  Your presence here, my noble guests,  
    Makes my joy overflow.  
Your virtue's rays through all my regions shine;  
Myriads of years be yours in boundless line! <span id="page_207">p.
207</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>  On southern
hills the medlars thrive,  
    And plum trees in the north.  
  Your presence here, my noble guests,  
    The richest joy calls forth.  
Parental love ye for my people show,  
And may your virtuous fame decay ne’er know!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>  The southern
hills the *k‘ao* display,  
    The northern have the *niu*.  
  Here at our feast, my noble guests,  
    My heart rests glad in you.  
The eyebrows of long life your foreheads crown;  
Still wider be your virtuous fame's renown!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>  The honey trees
on southern hills,  
    The *yü* on northern rise.  
  Your presence here, my noble guests,  
    Rare happiness supplies.  
Gray hair and wrinkled face yours yet shall be:  
May future times your sons as prosperous see!

</div>
