<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ling T‘ai;* narrative. The joy of the people in the growing
opulence and dignity of King Wên.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>When Wên to build
his wondrous tower began,  
  Of all its plan a scheme he drew.  
To do the work, in crowds the people ran,  
  And as by magic, lo! it grew.  
"Be not in haste:"—so kindly said the king,  
But all as to a father help would bring.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The king was
walking in his wondrous park,  
  Where lay the does, all sleek and clean.  
’Twas sweet to him their restfulness to mark,  
  And see the white birds’ glistening sheen.  
Then to his wondrous pond he took his way,  
To view the fish their bounding life display.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Right in the
middle of a circling pool,  
  His hall, the place of joy, he reared.  
For music there he made provision full.  
  ’Twixt pillars finely carved appeared  
Face boards, with tops of finest tracery,  
’Neath which large drums and bells were hanging free. <span
id="page_353">p. 353</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>On these the blind
musicians did their part.  
  Of lizard skin the drums were made.  
The eyeless men displayed consummate art;  
  In perfect unison they played.  
The music loud resounded through the hall.  
What rapture did the festive throng enthrall!

</div>
