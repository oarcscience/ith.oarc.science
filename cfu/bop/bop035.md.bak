#### VII

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *K‘ai Fêng;* metaphorical and allusive. Seven sons of some family in
Wei blame themselves for the restless unhappiness of their mother.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>On that jujube
tree the wind,  
From the south, blows soft and kind,  
Till each twig, in inmost place,  
Swells with life, and shines with grace.  
O how great the toil and care  
’Twas our mother's lot to bear! <span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>On that jujube
tree the wind,  
From the south, blows soft and kind,  
Till its branches all are seen  
Bright and rich in living green.  
Wise our mother is and good;  
Goodness we have never showed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>See that cool and
crystal spring,  
How its waters comfort bring,  
Welling forth the city near,  
All who dwell in Chün to cheer!  
Pained our mother is and tried,  
As if help we seven denied.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>In their yellow
plumage bright,  
Lovely gleam those birds to sight,  
And their notes fall on the ear,  
Rich and, oh! so sweet to hear.  
Seven sons we, without the art  
To compose our mother's heart!

</div>
