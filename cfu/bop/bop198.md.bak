<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ssŭ Kan;* narrative. On the completion of a royal palace;
description of it, and good wishes for the builder and his posterity.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>On yonder banks a
palace, lo! upshoots,  
  The tender blue of southern hill behind;  
Firm-founded, like the bamboo's clamping roots;  
  Its roof made pinelike, to a point defined.  
Fraternal love here bear its precious fruits,  
  And unfraternal schemes be ne’er designed!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Ancestral sway is
his. The walls they rear,  
  Five thousand cubits long; and south and west  
The doors are placed. Here will the king appear,  
  Here laugh, here talk, here sit him down and rest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>To mold the walls,
the frames they firmly tie;  
  The toiling builders beat the earth and lime.  
The walls shall vermin, storm, and bird defy;—  
  Fit dwelling is it for his lordly prime. <span id="page_232">p.
232</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Grand is the hall
the noble lord ascends;—  
  In height, like human form most reverent, grand;  
And straight, as flies the shaft when bow unbends;  
  Its tints, like hues when pheasant's wings expand.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>High pillars rise
the level court around;  
  The pleasant light the open chamber steeps;  
And deep recesses, wide alcoves, are found,  
  Where our good king in perfect quiet sleeps.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>Laid is the bamboo
mat on rush mat square;—  
  Here shall he sleep, and, waking, say, "Divine,  
What dreams are good? For bear and grisly bear  
  And snakes and cobras, haunt this couch of mine."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7">7</span></span>Then shall the
chief diviner glad reply,  
  "The bears foreshow that Heaven will send you sons.  
The snakes and cobras daughters prophesy.  
  These auguries are all auspicious ones." <span id="page_233">p.
233</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8">8</span></span>Sons shall be
his,—on couches lulled to rest.  
  The little ones, enrobed, with scepters play;  
Their infant cries are loud as stern behest;  
  Their knees the vermeil covers shall display.  
As king hereafter one shall be addressed;  
  The rest, our princes, all the states shall sway.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_9">9</span></span>And daughters also
to him shall be born.  
  They shall be placed upon the ground to sleep;  
Their playthings tiles, their dress the simplest worn;  
  Their part alike from good and ill to keep,  
And ne’er their parents’ hearts to cause to mourn;  
  To cook the food, and spirit malt to steep.

</div>
