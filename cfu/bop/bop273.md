<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Chan Ang;* narrative, and allusive in the last stanza. The writer
deplores the misery and oppression that prevailed, and intimates that
they were caused by the interference of women and eunuchs in the
government.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>To Heaven I look
with longing eye,  
  But only meet its angry frown. <span id="page_427">p. 427</span>  
In restless trouble long we lie,  
  And great afflictions still come down.  
Throughout the realm is nothing firm;  
  Both high and low are in distress.  
In palace and in court they swarm,  
  Whose ravages the land oppress.  
Wrapt in the net of crime we groan;  
  Nor peace nor cure comes to our moan.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>You now, O king,
possess the lands,  
  Which as their own men once could claim;  
And chiefs, who led their faithful bands,  
  Are stript of wealth, and brought to shame.  
Men blameless, free from slightest taint,  
  Within that fearful net are snared;  
While others walk without restraint,  
  Whose guilt is openly declared.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>A wise man builds
the city wall;  
  But a wise woman throws it down.  
Wise is she? Good you may her call;—  
  She is an owl we should disown! <span id="page_428">p. 428</span>  
To woman's tongue let length be given,  
  And step by step to harm it leads.  
Disorder does not come from Heaven;  
  ’Tis woman's tongue disorder breeds.  
Women and eunuchs! Never came  
  Lesson or warning word from them!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Hurtful and false,
their spite they wreak;  
  And when exposed their falsehood lies,  
The wrong they do not own, but sneak,  
  And say, "No harm did we devise."  
Thrice cent. per cent! Why that is trade,  
  And would the wise man but disgrace.  
Public affairs to wife and maid  
  Must not silkworms and looms displace.

5 Why is it Heaven thus sends reproof?  
  Why have the spirits ceased to bless?  
From the wild Ti you keep aloof,  
  And me would in your wrath oppress.  
Omens of ill you slight, though rife;  
  Nor for your outward bearing care.  
The good fly from the scene of strife;  
  Ruin impends, and blank despair. <span id="page_429">p. 429</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>Heaven's awful net
o’erhangs the land,  
  Full of more woes than tongue can tell.  
The good retire on every hand.  
  What sorrows in my bosom swell!  
Near and more near the net of Heaven!  
  Soon will its meshes all enfold.  
Good men are from their duties driven,  
  And how can grief of mine be told?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7">7</span></span>The waters
bubbling up make known  
  How deep and strong the spring below;  
And long the inward grief has grown,  
  From which my words of sorrow flow.  
Why came not this ere I was born?  
  Why happened it ere I was dead?  
Yet still the sorrowing and forlorn  
  Great and mysterious Heaven can aid.  
O king, your sires no more disgrace!  
  So may you save your future race.
