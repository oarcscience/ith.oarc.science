<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Here grew the
tribulus around,  
Till of its thorns they cleared the ground;—  
      Of old this work was wrought.  
Our fathers labored for our good,  
That millet we might plant for food,  
And millet used in sacrifice,  
Both yielding to us large supplies;—  
      So for us took they thought.  
Now when our barns are filled with grain,  
And myriad stacks in field remain,  
Spirits and viands we prepare,  
To use on grand occasions rare,  
      In sacrificial rite.  
The dead cannot in form be there,  
But there are those their part who bear.  
We lead them to the highest seat,  
And beg that they will drink and eat.  
So shall our sires our service own,  
And deign our happiness to crown,  
      With blessings still more bright. <span id="page_282">p.
282</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>With reverent air,
in dress correct,  
With sheep and oxen pure, select,  
When autumn comes, and winter cold,  
Our temple services we hold,  
      And offer sacrifice.  
The victims slain some haste to flay;  
Some boil the flesh; on stands some lay  
The pieces boiled, which some dispose  
In order due, exact and close,  
      According to their size.  
The while, the priest, inside the gate,  
Lest elsewhere welcome be too late,  
      Our sires asks to descend.  
Complete and brilliant are our rites;  
They grandly come, as he invites.  
Though hid from us in shadowy veil,  
Our offerings with delight they hail,  
      And to our prayers attend.  
Their filial son, our honored lord,  
Great blessing gets. They will reward  
With myriad years his duty shown,  
And sure maintain upon the throne  
      His sons till time shall end. <span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Before the fires
some reverent stand;  
Some take the mighty trays in hand;  
These with the roasted flesh they fill,  
Those with the livers broiled. Then still  
And reverent, the queen presides,  
And every smaller dish provides,  
      The pious feast to grace.  
The guests and visitors draw near.  
Divined for, now they all appear,  
      And take an honored place.  
’Tween those who personate our sires,  
Our lord, and them, as rule requires,  
Once and again the cup goes round.  
Each word and smile just that is found,  
      Which word and smile should be.  
The spirits come in quiet state,  
And answer give with blessings great.  
Myriads of years—his due reward—  
Shall show how they our lord regard,  
      And keep from evil free. <span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Exhausted now we
feel, but see  
Our every rite from error free.  
The able priest has learned the will  
Of the great spirits. To fulfill  
His part he hastes, and to our lord,  
Standing before him, with grave word,  
      His message thus conveys:—  
"Your sacrifice has filled the air  
With fragrance. Both your spirits rare  
And viands rich your sires enjoy.  
Blessings not few, without alloy,  
They give;—each all that you could hope,  
Each sure as law's unerring scope,  
Exact in form, without delay,  
Due reverence you have striven to pay.  
From error free, discharged with care,  
Your ceremonies all declare  
Your filial heart. Your sires henceforth  
Will favors grant of greatest worth,  
For myriad years, and myriads more,  
Nor time exhaust the boundless store."  
      ’Tis this the wise priest says. <span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>The rites thus all
performed exact,  
The drums and bells announce the fact.  
Our lord withdraws, and takes his way  
Where parting guests their homage pay.  
      Then comes the wise priest's voice:—  
"The spirits all are satisfied."  
No longer in their seats abide  
Their representatives, but slow,  
’Mid warning bells and drums, withdraw;—  
      So ends the sacrifice.  
The spirits tranquilly ascend.  
The queen and who the queen attend,  
And all the servants, haste to clear  
The hall, that nothing may appear  
      Left from the sacred rites.  
Those who are of the royal kin,  
The old and young, abide within,  
The surname of the king they bear,  
And to the special feast repair,  
      To which his grace invites. <span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>All the musicians
follow fast,  
Their special aid at this repast  
      The feasters shall not fail.  
The mats the viands rich display;  
No face looks sad, but all are gay.  
They drink, they eat, with fullest zest;  
Dish after dish, well pleased they taste;  
      Great love and joy prevail.  
At last they rise, and to their lord  
First bow their heads with one accord;  
      Then him they thus address:—  
"Rich viands and your spirits rare,  
All testified your pious care.  
The spirits of our sires partook;  
On you benignantly they look.  
Your term of life they will extend,  
And favors give that ne’er shall end.  
As through the year the seasons move,  
Your pious feelings equal prove  
Fully each sacrifice to pay.  
So may it be in future day,  
And sons and grandsons of your line,  
Observant of these rites divine,  
      The ceremony bless!"
