The *Ho Ming;* metaphorical. Certain moral lessons from natural facts.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>All true words
fly, as from yon reedy marsh  
The crane rings o’er the wild its screaming harsh.  
Vainly you try reason in chains to keep;—  
Freely it moves as fish sweeps through the deep.  
Hate follows love, as ’neath those sandal trees  
The withered leaves the eager searcher sees.  
The hurtful ne’er without some good was born;—  
The stones that mar the hill will grind the corn. <span id="page_226">p.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>All true words
spread, as from the marsh's eye  
The crane's sonorous note ascends the sky.  
Goodness throughout the widest sphere abides,  
As fish round isle and through the ocean glides.  
And lesser good near greater you shall see,  
As grows the paper shrub ’neath sandal tree.  
And good emerges from what man condemns;—  
Those stones that mar the hill will polish gems.

</div>
