<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Yü Liu;* metaphorical and allusive. Some noble tells how impossible
it was to approach or do anything for the king, and warns the others
against doing so.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>The willow trees
luxuriant grow.  
Who is not glad himself to throw  
  Beneath their shade to rest?  
And so to our great sovereign's court  
The feudal lords should oft resort,  
  And feel supremely blessed.  
But he whom we all deemed a god  
Is so uncertain in his nod,  
  That they his presence shun.  
Near him alone I dare not go.  
Were I at court myself to show,  
And of his troubles take the charge,  
His calls on me would be so large,  
  That I should be undone. <span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Luxuriant grow the
willow trees;  
Beneath their shade one often sees  
  Large crowds at ease reclined.  
So should the king his grace extend,  
And to his court the princes bend  
  Their steps with willing mind.  
But he, whom as a god we viewed,  
Is so uncertain in his mood,  
  That they dare not appear.  
For me I should but court distress,  
If I alone were to address  
Myself to take his cares in hand;  
He would so much of me demand,  
  I'd live in constant fear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>The birds now on
the trees alight,  
Then spread their wings in sudden flight,  
  And soar aloft to heaven;  
So does the king his purpose change,  
From one thing to another range,  
  As by his fancies driven.  
His heart we cannot fathom well,  
Nor can we any moment tell  
  To what he will proceed.  
The task why should I undertake,  
And vainly the endeavor make,  
His grievous troubles to redress?  
’Twould only cause me sore distress,  
  And to my misery lead.

</div>
