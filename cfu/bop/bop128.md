#### XII

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ts‘ai Ling;* metaphorical. Against giving ear to slanderers.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>When told to
Shou-yang's top to go,  
  The *ling* plants there to take,  
The speaker false at once you'd know,  
  Nor heed the words he spake. <span id="page_138">p. 138</span>  
And so, when men their stories feign,  
  To credit them be slow.  
Put them aside, put them aside;  
  Belief should slowly grow.  
’Tis thus the stories told by men  
  Subside, nor farther go.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>When told to
search round Shou-yang's base,  
  Sow thistles there to find,  
The search you'd think a hopeless case,  
  Nor would the counsel mind.  
And so, when men their stories feign,  
  Do not approve in haste.  
Put them aside, put them aside;  
  Assent should be repressed.  
’Tis thus the stories told by men  
  Soon unregarded rest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>When told on th’
east of Shou-yang hill  
  For mustard plants to try,  
You'd know the quest would speed but ill,  
  And let the words pass by.  
And so, when men their stories feign,  
  No hearing to them lend.  
  Put them aside, put them aside,  
Your faith loth to extend.  
’Tis thus the stories told by men  
  Come shortly to an end.

</div>
