<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>When the sixth
month had come, the turmoil of war  
Burst suddenly forth, and each quick-harnessed car  
Stood ready to move, with its steeds keen and strong,  
While heavier cars bore the baggage along.  
Fierce blazing, the Hsien-yün had mustered their men;  
No recreant there, all was urgency then. <span id="page_214">p.
214</span>  
The king gave the word; we were mustered and gone,  
To rescue from foemen the kingdom and throne.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Well matched in
their strength were the horses, and black,  
And trained to the reins, as they tighten or slack.  
Ere the sixth month was o’er, the field we could take;  
No more preparation we needed to make.  
With all our accouterments fully complete,  
Each day thirty li went our hurrying feet.  
The king gave the word; we were mustered and gone,  
With courage all ardent to help Heaven's son.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Long and stout
were the steeds, attached to each car,  
With broad heads that scented the battle afar.  
We smote the Hsien-yün, and great merit obtained,  
Nor flagged in our efforts till triumph was gained.  
The eye of our leader was careful and stern,  
Discharging his service, bright glory to earn; <span id="page_215">p.
215</span>  
Determined the war to such issue to bring,  
As would firmly establish the throne of the king.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>For themselves
badly judging, the Hsien-yün go,  
Bold to occupy Chiao, and seize upon Ho.  
Hao and Fang they o’erran, still issuing forth,  
Till, crossing the King, they pressed onto the north.  
Our flags showed the falcons in blazonry bright,  
And gayly their streamers all fluttered in white.  
Ten chariots of war, all imposing and strong,  
Led proudly the van of our conquering throng.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>The workmen had
labored to perfect each car,  
Well balanced, before and behind, for the war.  
Its four steeds were mighty, unmatched in their strain,  
And yielding at once to each touch of the rein.  
We smote the Hsien-yün; ay, we conquered, and then  
We pursued them in flight to the far T‘a-yüan.  
As in peace, so in war, our Chi-fu is great,  
Affording a pattern to all in each state. <span id="page_216">p.
216</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>And now at the
banquet, forgotten all care,  
He feasts with his friends, feeling happiness rare.  
The tedious marches are all over now,—  
The marches we traveled, returning from Hao.  
To his friends the bright spirits his welcome convey;  
Minced carp and roast turtle the mats all display.  
And who are the guests? There above every other  
Sits Chang Chung, renowned as a son and a brother.
