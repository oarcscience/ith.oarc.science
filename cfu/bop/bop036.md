#### VIII

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Hsiung Chih;* allusive and narrative. A wife deplores the absence
of her husband, and celebrates his virtue.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Away the startled
pheasant flies,  
  With lazy movement of his wings.  
Borne was my heart's lord from my eyes;—  
  What pain the separation brings!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The pheasant,
though no more in view,  
  His cry, below, above, forth sends.  
Alas! my princely lord, ‘tis you,—  
  Your absence, that my bosom rends.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>At sun and moon I
sit and gaze,  
  In converse with my troubled heart.  
Far, far from me my husband stays!  
  When will he come to heal its smart?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Ye princely men,
who with him mate,  
  Say, mark ye not his virtuous way.  
His rule is—covet nought, none hate;—  
  How can his steps from goodness stray?

</div>
