<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>The gold thread to
gather I'm going,  
  Where in Wei it spreads over the tree;  
But my thoughts forever are flowing  
  To the beauty who captive holds me,— <span id="page_52">p. 52</span>  
To the eldest Chiang. Yes, it is she!  
  Freely did she agree in Sang-chung,  
  She would come to me here in Shang-kung,  
And then company keep with me on to the Ch‘i.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>For the wheat
about Wei I'm going  
  To the north where it grows in each part.  
But my thoughts forever are flowing  
  To the beauty who rules in my heart,—  
To the eldest I. Yes, it is she!  
  Freely did she agree in Sang-chung,  
  She would come to me here in Shang-kung,  
And then company keep with me on to the Ch‘i.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>For the mustard
plant I am going  
  Where in Wei it grows over the east.  
But my thoughts forever are flowing  
  To the beauty on whose love I feast,—  
To the eldest Yung. Yes, it is she!  
  Freely did she agree in Sang-chung,  
  She would come to me here in Shang-kung,  
And then company keep with me on to the Ch‘i.
