#### IX

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Yu Nü T‘ung Ch‘ê;* narrative. The praise of some lady.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>There by his side
in chariot rideth she,  
As lovely flower of the hibiscus tree,  
So fair her face; and when about they wheel,  
Her girdle gems of *chü* themselves reveal.  
For beauty all the house of Chiang have fame;  
Its eldest daughter,—she beseems her name.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>There on the path,
close by him, walketh she,  
Bright as the blossom of hibiscus tree  
And fair her face; and when around they flit,  
Her girdle gems a tinkling sound emit.  
Among the Chiang she has distinguished place,  
For virtuous fame renowned, and peerless grace.

</div>
