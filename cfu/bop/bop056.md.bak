<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Kan Mao;* narrative. The zeal of the officers of Wei to welcome men
of worth.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Where Chün's
suburbs lie remote,  
From the staffs the oxtails float.  
High the staffs, and each one bright  
With its silken bandlets white!  
Four cars drawn by steeds of fire  
Welcome guest whom. all desire.  
Admirable, what will he  
Give to meet such courtesy?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>In Chün's suburbs
near the town,  
Fly the falcon banners, blown  
From the staffs that rise around,  
All with bands of white silk bound.  
Five cars drawn by horses strong  
Wait the guest who comes along.  
Courteous, worthy,—what shall he  
Pay for all this courtesy?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Now the walls of
Chün we see;  
Feather’d streamers flutter free  
From the flagstaffs strong and stout,  
"Girt by silken bands about. <span id="page_58">p. 58</span>  
Six cars drawn by steeds of fame  
Well attest the guest's high name.  
Sage profound, what can he say  
That such welcome will repay?

</div>
