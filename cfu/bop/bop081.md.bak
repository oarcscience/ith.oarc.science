<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Our Shu a-hunting
forth has gone;  
In four-horsed chariot grand he shone.  
As ribbon in his grasp each rein;  
With measured steps, like dancers twain,  
  The outside horses flew.  
They now have reached the marshy ground;  
At once the flames break out around.  
With naked arm and chest Shu stands;  
A tiger fierce his nervous hands  
  Grapple and soon subdue.  
He then presents it to the duke,  
While all with wonder on him look.  
But, Shu, try not such sport again.  
What grief were ours if you were slain!  
  Your daring we should rue.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Our Shu a-hunting
drove away,  
His four steeds all of color bay.  
The outsides followed close behind <span id="page_90">p. 90</span>  
The insides, finest of their kind,  
  Like wild geese on the wing.  
They now have gained the marshy ground;  
At once the flames blaze all around.  
Few archers can with Shu compare;  
A charioteer of cunning rare,  
  The steeds before him spring.  
Now they dash on in course direct;  
Now they're brought up and quickly checkt.  
Forth flies the arrow, fleet and stark,  
Nor fails to hit its proper mark,  
  His left hand following.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Our Shu a-hunting
drove away,  
His four steeds all of color gray.  
With heads in line the insides sped;  
The outsides followed like the head  
  Succeeded by the arms.  
They now have reached the marshy ground;  
One blaze of flame wraps all around;  
  Soon cease the hunt's alarms.  
Shu's steeds before him slowly move;  
His skill the arrows cease to prove.  
Straightway the quiver's lid is closed,  
And in its case the bow reposed.  
  How his fine bearing charms!
