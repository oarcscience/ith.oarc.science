#### VIII

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *T‘ing Liao;* narrative. Describing the anxiety of some
king—supposed to be King Hsüan—not to be late at his morning levee.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>How goes the
night? For heavy morning sleep  
Ill suits the king who men would loyal keep.  
The courtyard, ruddy with the torch's light,  
Proclaims unspent the deepest hour of night.  
Already near the gate my lords appear;  
Their tinkling bells salute my wakeful ear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>How goes the
night? I may not slumber on.  
Although not yet the night is wholly gone,  
The paling torchlight in the court below  
Gives token that the hours swift-footed go.  
Already at the gate my lords appear;  
Their tinkling bells with measured sound draw near.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>How goes the
night? I may not slumber now.  
The darkness smiles with morning on its brow.  
The courtyard torch no more gives forth its ray,  
But heralds with its smoke the coming day.  
My princes pass the gate, and gather there;  
I see their banners floating in the air.

</div>
