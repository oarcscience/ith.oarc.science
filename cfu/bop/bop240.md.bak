<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Hu Yeh;* narrative. Where the provisions are most frugal, all the
rules of polite intercourse may yet be preserved.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>A few gourd leaves
that waved about  
  Cut down and boiled;—the feast how spare! <span id="page_327">p.
327</span>  
But the good host his spirits takes,  
  Pours out a cup, and proves them rare.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>A single rabbit on
the mat,  
  Or baked, or roast:—how small the feast!  
But the good host his spirits takes,  
  And fills the cup of every guest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>A single rabbit on
the mat,  
  Roasted or broiled:—how poor the meal!  
But the guests from the spirit vase  
  Fill their host's cup, and drink his weal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>A single rabbit on
the mat,  
  Roasted or baked:—no feast we think!  
But from the spirit vase they take,  
  Both host and guests, and joyous drink.

</div>
