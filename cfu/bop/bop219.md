<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Hsin Nan Shan;* narrative. Husbandry traced to its first author;
details about it, going on to the subject of sacrifices to ancestors.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Yes, all about
that southern hill,  
  Great Yü pursued his wondrous toil.  
He drained the plain, the marsh he dried;  
  Our lord in fields laid out the soil.  
Their boundaries we now define,  
As south, or east, the fields incline.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The wintry
heavens, one arch of clouds,  
  Send down the flakes that fill the sky.  
Then come the drizzling rains of spring,  
  That moisture, with the snow, supply,  
To soak and fit the ground for use,  
And in its season grain produce.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>The plots,
arranged in order fit,  
  The millets in abundance bear. <span id="page_288">p. 288</span>  
So shall our lord the harvest view;  
  While food and spirits we prepare,  
For those in whom our sires descend,  
And guests who at the feast attend.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>The central plot
the huts contains,  
  While gourds each path and boundary line.  
Their fruits preserved, aside we put,  
  Till ’mong the offerings they shall shine.  
So through his sires our lord shall gain  
Long life, and gifts from Heaven obtain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>The fragrant
spirits first are poured;  
  Then near the gate the bull is led;—  
So we invite our sires to come.  
  To show the victim pure and red,  
The knife with bells slides through the hair.  
Its blood and fat away we bear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>'Then all our
offerings we present,  
  Diffusing round a fragrance great.  
How brilliant is the sacrifice!  
  Our ancestors in kingly state  
Are there, unseen; but they shall send  
Blessing and life,—years without end!
