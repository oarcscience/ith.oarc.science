#### X

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ku Fêng;* metaphorical, allusive, and narrative. The plaint of a
wife supplanted by another, and rejected by her husband.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>    The east wind
gently blows,  
    With cloudy skies and rain.  
’Twixt man and wife should ne’er be strife,  
    But harmony obtain.  
    Radish and mustard plants  
    Are used, though some be poor;  
While my good name is free from blame,  
    Don't thrust me from your door.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>    I go along the
road,  
    Slow, with reluctant heart.  
Your escort lame to door but came,  
    There glad from me to part. <span id="page_37">p. 37</span>  
    Sow thistle, bitter called,  
    As shepherd's-purse is sweet;  
With your new mate you feast elate,  
    As joyous brothers meet.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>    Part clear,
the stream of Ching  
    Is foul beside the Wei.  
You feast elate with your new mate,  
    And take no heed of me.  
    Loose mate, avoid my dam,  
    Nor dare my basket move!  
Person slighted, life all blighted,  
    What can the future prove?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>    The water
deep, in boat,  
    Or raft-sustained, I'd go;  
And where the stream did narrow seem,  
    I dived or breasted through.  
    I labored to increase  
    Our means, or great or small;  
    When ’mong friends near, death did appear,  
On knees to help I'd crawl. <span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>    No cherishing
you give,  
    I'm hostile in your eyes.  
As peddler's wares for which none cares,  
    My virtues you despise.  
    When poverty was nigh,  
    I strove our means to spare;  
You, now rich grown, me scorn to own;  
    To poison me compare.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>    The stores for
winter piled.  
    Are all unprized in spring.  
So now, elate with your new mate,  
    Myself away you fling.  
    Your cool disdain for me  
    A bitter anguish hath.  
The early time, our love's sweet prime,  
    In you wakes only wrath.

</div>
