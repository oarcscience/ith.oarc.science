#### II

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *I;* narrative, excepting Stanza 9, which is allusive. Containing
various counsels which Duke Wu of Wei made to admonish himself, when he
was over his ninetieth year;—especially on the duty of a ruler to be
careful of his outward demeanor, and to receive with docility
instructions delivered to him.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Outward demeanor,
cool and grave,  
Reveals who inward virtue have.  
People in common parlance say,  
"Wise men stupidity display." <span id="page_390">p. 390</span>  
Not so. For dullness where you find,  
’Tis from defect within the mind;  
And if a wise man dull appear,  
He wrongs his native character.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>What's mightiest
is—the man to be.  
This powerful everywhere we see.  
Where from true virtue actions spring,  
All their obedient homage bring.  
Whose views are great, and fixed his aims;  
Who in due time his will proclaims;  
Whose plans reach far; whose reverent care  
His outward bearing shall declare:—  
Him a true chief the people call,  
And hailed his pattern is by all.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Look at the
present state of things!  
Your conduct only chaos brings.  
Low in the dust your virtue lies,  
A drunken sot whom men despise  
You seize the joy before you brought,  
And give not to the past a thought. <span id="page_391">p. 391</span>  
Oh! bear in mind the kings of old,  
And strive their statutes fast to hold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>See whom great
Heaven condemns! As flow  
The waters from their spring, they go  
To ruin all.—This lesson know.  
Rise early, and go late to sleep;  
Sprinkled and swept your courtyard keep;—  
Thus to your people pattern be.  
Well to your steeds and chariots see;  
And bows and shafts, and weapons all,  
Have ready at a moment's call.  
So shall you stand prepared for war,  
And keep the southern hordes afar.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>What officers and
people need,  
Give to them, both by word and deed.  
Your princely duties do with care;  
Of dangers unforeseen beware.  
Be circumspect in all you say,  
And reverent bearing still display,  
From censure free of man or child,  
Attractive ever, ever mild. <span id="page_392">p. 392</span>  
A flaw in mace of white jade may  
By patient toil be ground away  
But for a flaw we make in speech  
What can be done? ’Tis past our reach.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>Words are your
own. To speak be slow.  
Say not, "’Tis but a word." No, no!  
There's none for you your tongue can guard.  
O’er it yourself keep watch and ward.  
Answers to every word will leap;  
Good deeds their recompense shall reap  
If friends from you with kindness meet,  
And subjects as your sons you treat,  
Your line from age to age shall live,  
And subjects strict obedience give.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7">7</span></span>When mingling with
superior men,  
In friendly intercourse, oh! then  
How mild your face! What harmony!  
All wrong and error bow you flee!  
When in your chamber, ’neath its light,  
Your conscience keep as pure and bright. <span id="page_393">p.
393</span>  
Say not, "No one can see me here;  
The place is secret." Be in fear.  
The spirits come, but when and where  
No one beforehand can declare.  
The more should we not spirits slight,  
But ever feel as in their sight.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8">8</span></span>O prince, a
virtuous course pursue,  
In manner good, and fair, and true.  
Keep on your acts a watchful eye;  
Thus may you scrutiny defy!  
Exceed not, break not, virtue's law;—  
So shall you men's attention draw,  
Their pattern prized, and free from flaw.  
A peach one throws me; in return  
I give a plum. Please here discern  
Cause and effect together bound,  
In certain sequence ever found.  
Seek horns on lamb! It has not horns.  
Your sense, my son, such seeking scorns.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_9">9</span></span>When wood is
tough, and full of spring  
It makes the bow with silken string. <span id="page_394">p. 394</span>  
Mildness and reverence base supply  
For virtue's structure, broad and high.  
I tell the wise man what is good;—  
He does it straight in docile mood.  
I tell the fool, and forthwith he  
Denies its truth indignantly.  
Such differences in men we find;  
So wide apart is mind from mind!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span>Ere you knew
right from wrong, my son,  
I held your hand, and led you on,  
Showing what things were good, what bad;—  
Such lessons from my lips you had.  
And lest you should not clearly hear,  
I held you gently by the ear.  
A son since then your arms has filled;  
And have you still a mind unskilled?  
’Tis self-sufficiency doth hold  
The early taught still dark when old.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11">11</span></span>Before great
Heaven's clear piercing eye  
My life seems vain; its pleasures die. <span id="page_395">p.
395</span>  
Foolish and dark you still remain,  
Wringing my heart with constant pain.  
I taught you well; I never tired;—  
My teaching but contempt inspired.  
Your teacher? No, I was your bore;  
You only shrank from me the more.  
Ah! still the truth you do not know,  
Though years have made your hair like snow.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_12">12</span></span>My son, thus
plainly have I told  
What sages taught in days of old.  
Give to my counsels reverent heed;—  
So shall you shun each guilty deed.  
Lo! Heaven in anger seems to threat  
With utter overthrow our state.  
Not from a distance need we draw  
The proofs of Heaven's avenging law.  
Great Heaven is far too wise to err.  
If lower sink your character,  
And virtue still the less you show,  
Your people you will plunge in woe.
