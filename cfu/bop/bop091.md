#### XIV

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Fêng;* narrative. A woman regrets lost opportunities, and would
welcome a fresh suitor.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Handsome the
suitor was and stout,  
Who for me in the lane looked out:  
I should have gone with him I doubt. <span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Can I that
suitor's form forget,  
Who for me in the hall did wait?  
That I held off I now regret.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>I'm here, my
broidered upper robe  
  Concealed beneath a garment plain.  
As lovely is my lower robe,  
  With the same guard ’gainst travel stain.  
O sir, O sir, come and me hence convey;  
Your waiting chariot I shall not delay!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>I'm here, my
broidered lower robe  
  Concealed beneath a garment plain.  
As lovely is my upper robe,  
  With the same guard ’gainst travel stain.  
O sir, O sir, if you would only come,  
At once your chariot should convey me home!

</div>
