<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Shu Yü T‘ien;* narrative. The admiration with which *Shu Tuan* was
regarded.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>To the hunt Shu
has gone,  
And people there are none  
  Remaining in the street.  
Perhaps a few you'll find;  
But none like Shu so kind,  
  So graceful, will you meet.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>To the chase Shu
has gone,  
And people there are none  
  Left feasting in the street.  
If find a few you could,  
Yet none like Shu so good,  
  So graceful, would you meet.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>To the fields Shu
has gone,  
And people there are none  
  Careering through the street.  
Some riders though you told,  
Yet none like Shu so bold,  
  So graceful, would you meet.

</div>
