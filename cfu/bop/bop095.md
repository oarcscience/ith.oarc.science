#### XVIII

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Yang Chih Shui;* allusive. One party asserts good faith to another,
and protests against people who would make them doubt each other.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>    Fretted its
waters seem,  
  Yet gently flows the stream:—  
A bundle of thorns ’twill not bear. <span id="page_101">p. 101</span>  
    Our brethren are so few;  
    There are but I and you:—  
Let nothing our friendship impair.  
    People's words don't believe;  
    They are meant to deceive:—  
Their purpose is but to ensnare.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>    Fretted its
waters seem,  
    Yet gently flows the stream:—  
A bundle of wood ’twill not bear.  
    Our brethren are so few;  
    There are only we two:—  
Let nothing our friendship impair.  
    Trust not the people's breath;  
    They don't deserve your faith:—  
Their purpose is but to ensnare.

</div>
