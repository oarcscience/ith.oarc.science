#### VI

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *T‘ien Pao;* narrative. An ode responsive to any of the five
preceding. His officers and guests, feasted by the king, celebrate his
praises, and desire for him the blessing of Heaven and of his ancestors.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Heaven shields and
sets thee fast.  
It round thee fair has cast <span id="page_193">p. 193</span>  
    Thy virtue pure.  
Thus richest joy is thine;—  
Increase of corn and wine,  
And every gift divine,  
    Abundant, sure.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Heaven shields and
sets thee fast.  
From it thou goodness hast;  
    Right are thy ways.  
Its choicest gifts ’twill pour,  
That last forevermore,  
Nor time exhaust the store  
    Through endless days.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Heaven shields and
sets thee fast,  
Makes thine endeavor last,  
    And prosper well.  
Like hills and mountains high,  
Whose masses touch the sky;  
Like stream aye surging by;  
    Thine increase swell! <span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>With rite and
auspice fair,  
Thine offerings thou dost bear,  
    And sonlike give,  
The seasons round from spring,  
To olden duke and king,  
Whose words to thee we bring:—  
    "Forever live."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>The spirits of thy
dead  
Pour blessings on thy head,  
    Unnumbered, sweet.  
Thy subjects, simple, good,  
Enjoy their drink and food.  
Our tribes of every blood  
    Follow thy feet.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>Like moons that
wax in light;  
Or suns that scale the height;  
    Or ageless hill;  
Nor change, nor autumn know;  
As pine and cypress grow;  
The sons that from thee flow  
    Be lasting still!

</div>
