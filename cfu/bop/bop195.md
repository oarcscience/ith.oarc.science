#### II

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Pai Chü;* narrative. The writer expresses his regret at the
abandonment of public life by an officer whom he admired.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Free let the
brilliant white colt eat  
  The tenderest produce in my yard.  
Secure it by the neck and feet;  
  And this morn's pleasure safely guard.  
Its owner, cherished in my heart,  
  Shall then with me at ease abide.  
Alas that he should e’er depart.  
  And hermitlike his merit hide! <span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Free let the
brilliant white colt eat  
  The bean sprouts growing in my yard.  
Secure it by the neck and feet,  
  This evening's joy thus safely guard.  
Its owner, cherished in my heart,  
  Shall then be here, a guest admired.  
O could I wile him from the part  
  He wants to play, from men retired!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>O leave thy colt
of brilliant white!  
  If thou to me would’st blithely come,  
As duke or marquis, honors bright  
  Thou should’st obtain, and in thy home  
Find endless joy. Try to restrain,  
  With strictest curb, thy roaming mind:  
And from the hermit life refrain,  
  To which thou art so much inclined.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>’Tis vain. The
brilliant white colt view,  
  Deep in that empty valley stand,  
Before it placed a bundle new  
  Of grass plucked by its master's hand.  
That master as a gem I hold.  
  O that, relenting, he may send  
What I'll prize more than gems or gold,—  
  News that he still remains my friend!
