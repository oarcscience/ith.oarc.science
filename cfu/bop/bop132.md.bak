<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Chien Chia;* narrative. Some one tells how he sought another, whom
it seemed easy to find, and yet could not find him.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Reed and rush are
dark and green;  
As hoarfrost the white dew is seen.  
Him, the man I have in mind,  
By this water I should find.  
Searching, up the stream I haste,  
On a long and toilsome quest.  
Downwards then I turn, and see!  
In the midstream standeth he.  
He is there but far removed;  
Vain has all my searching proved.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Reed and rush
luxuriant rise;  
Still undried the white dew lies.  
Him, the man I have in mind,  
On the stream's edge I should find.  
Upwards first my course I keep,  
Though the way is rough and steep. <span id="page_144">p. 144</span>  
Downwards then, and what to see?  
In the midstream standeth he,  
On the islet, far removed;—  
Vain has all my searching proved.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Reed and rush grow
thick and tall;  
Ceases not the dew to fall.  
Him, the man I have in mind,  
On the stream's bank I should find.  
Upwards first I go along,  
But the hard path leads me wrong.  
Downwards then my steps I turn,  
And in midstream him discern,  
On the island, far removed;—  
Vain has all my searching proved.
