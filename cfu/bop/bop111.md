#### II

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Fên Chü Ju;* allusive. Against the parsimoniousness of the officers
of Wei.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>  Where near the
Fên damp is the ground,  
  The sorrel gatherers are found,  
    To eke their scanty food.  
  Such arts that officer displays,  
  (Whose elegance exceeds all praise;)  
    In him they are not good.  
Charged with the cars of state, we look to find  
His conduct show a higher style of mind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>  On the Fên's
banks the poor are found,  
  Who pluck the mulberry leaves around,  
    A little gain to make.  
  In grace and beauty like a flower,  
  That officer himself doth lower,  
    Such small mean ways to take.  
The cars of state to marshal is his charge;—  
Strange such high post his mind should not enlarge!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Where the Fên
bends to join the Ho,  
  For ox-lip leaves the people go,  
    Some nourishment to find. <span id="page_118">p. 118</span>  
  That officer we gemlike call,  
  Yet shrinks he not from ways as small,  
    To greed too much inclined.  
The ruler's kindred he has for his care;—  
Should he not show a loftier character?

</div>
