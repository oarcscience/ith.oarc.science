### <span class="smallcaps">Book XI. The Odes of Ch‘in</span>

#### I

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ch‘ê Lin;* narrative and allusive. Celebrating the growing opulence
and style of some lord of Ch‘in, and the pleasures and freedom of his
court.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>His many chariots
rush along,  
Drawn by white-fronted steeds and strong.  
When audience now we wish to gain,  
His eunuchs’ aid we must obtain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The varnish trees
on hillsides grow,  
And chestnuts on the lands below.  
When access to the prince we've found,  
We sit and hear the lutes’ sweet sound.  
If we seize not this joy to-day,  
Old age will have us for its prey.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>The mulberries on
the hillsides grow,  
And willows where the grounds are low.  
When to the prince our way we've made  
We sit and hear the organs played.  
If we pass by this joy to-day,  
Old age will bear us all away.

</div>
