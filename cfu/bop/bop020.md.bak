#### VI

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Hsing Lu;* narrative and allusive. A lady resists an attempt to
force her to marry, and argues her cause.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>The dew thick on
the wet paths lay;  
Thither at early dawn my way  
I might have ta’en; but I said, "Nay.  
The dew is thick, at home I'll stay."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>You say that
sparrow has a horn.—  
  How could it else bore through your house?  
You say this trial is a proof  
  That I exchanged betrothal vows.  
But though you've made me here appear in court,  
Yet at betrothal what you did fell short.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>You say the rat's
teeth are complete.—  
  How could it else bore through your wall?  
You say this trial proves my vows  
  Of plighted troth were perfect all.  
But though to court you've forced me here to come,  
My will is firm;—I'll not with you go home.

</div>
