#### II

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ch‘iang Yu T‘zŭ;* allusive. The things done in the harem of the
palace of Wei were too shameful to be told.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>As grows on wall
the Tribulus,  
  And ’gainst the brush retains its hold;  
So let what's in the harem done  
  By us without remain untold.  
What must be told would tongue defile  
With things unfit for speech, and vile.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>As grows on wall
the Tribulus,  
  Which vainly to remove we try;  
So let what's in the harem done  
  By us without unspoken lie.  
If on details we condescend,  
The narrative would have no end.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>As grows on wall
the Tribulus,  
  And cannot in the sheaf be tied;  
So let what's in the harem done  
  By us without untouched abide.  
If truth were in the tale laid bare,  
How foul a scene were painted there!

</div>
