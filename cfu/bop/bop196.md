#### III

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Huang Niao;* metaphorical. Some officer, who had withdrawn to
another state, finds his expectations of the people there disappointed,
and proposes to return to the royal domain.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Thou
yellow-plumaged bird, O spare  
  The paper shrubs and fields of grain!  
For me these people show no care;—  
  I long for kin and home again.  
That we judged ill, when we came here,  
Does from their cold neglect appear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The mulberry trees
and fields of maize,  
  Thou yellow-plumaged bird, eschew!  
These people are a dullard race;  
  I long my brethren's face to view.  
That we judged ill, when we came here,  
Does from their cold neglect appear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Thou
yellow-plumaged bird, O fly  
  Those oak trees, nor the millet eat!  
From this bad land I back must hie;—  
  I long my father's kin to greet.  
That we judged ill, when we came here,  
Does from their cold neglect appear.

</div>
