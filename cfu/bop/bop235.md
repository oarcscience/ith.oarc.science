<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ts‘ai Lu;* narrative. A wife tells her sorrow and incapability of
attending to anything, in the prolonged absence of her husband, to whom
she was fondly attached.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>So full am I of
anxious thought,  
Though all the morn king grass I've sought,  
     To fill my arms I fail.  
Like wisp all-tangled is my hair!  
To wash it let me home repair.  
     My lord soon may I hail!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Though ’mong the
indigo I've wrought  
The morning long, through anxious thought,  
     My skirt's filled but in part.  
Within five days he was to appear.  
The sixth has come, and he's not here.  
     Oh! how this racks my heart!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>When here we dwelt
in union sweet.  
If the hunt called his eager feet,  
     His bow I cased for him.  
Or if to fish he went away,  
And would be absent all the day,  
     His line I put in trim. <span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>What in his
angling did he catch?  
Well worth the time it was to watch  
     How bream and tench he took.  
Men thronged upon the banks and gazed;  
At bream and tench they looked amazed,  
     The triumphs of his hook.

</div>
