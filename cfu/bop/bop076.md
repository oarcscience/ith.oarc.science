*The Book of Poetry*, tr. by James Legge, \[1876\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

#### IX

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ta Ch‘ê;* narrative. The influence of a severe and virtuous
magistrate in repressing licentiousness.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>He rolls along in
carriage grand,  
  His robes are bright with green,—  
His robes of rank, as on the bank  
  The tender sedge is seen.  
Thinking I always am of thee,  
  Thinking with fond desire;  
But dreading his severity,  
  I must repress the fire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>With slow and
heavy sound his car,—  
  His car of state, moves on.  
O’er his dress spread, the colors red  
  Shine like carnation stone.  
Thinking I always am of thee;  
  The fondest thoughts have I.  
The fear of him alone holds me,  
  Or to thine arms I'd fly. <span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Our fate may be,
while still alive,  
  Always apart to dwell;  
But when we're dead, we shall be laid  
  In the same earthen cell.  
If haply thou should’st say that I  
  Am not in this sincere,  
I swear its truth by that day's eye,  
  Whose piercing glance I fear.

</div>
