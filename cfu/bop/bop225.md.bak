#### II

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Yüan Yang;* allusive. Responsive to the last ode;—the princes
express their prayers and wishes for the king.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>The Yellow ducks,
full grown, take wing and fly;  
For them the men both hand and spread nets ply;—  
  So greatly they their beauty prize. <span id="page_297">p.
297</span>  
May the king's life ten thousand years extend,  
While wealth and happiness that know no end  
  Heaven, as deserved, to him supplies!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The yellow ducks
upon the dam oft rest,  
Each with its left wing ’gainst its neighbor's pressed;—  
  Their mutual fondness thus they show.  
Heaven to the king ten thousand years assign!  
And blessings lasting in unbroken line  
  Upon his merit great bestow!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>The stables large
the teams of steeds contain;—  
In peace with forage, and in war with grain,  
  Abundantly they are supplied.  
May the king's life extend ten thousand years,  
While all that lengthened time no sign appears  
  Of wealth or happiness denied!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>The stables large
contain the numerous teams;—  
Forage they get in peace; in war there gleams  
  In every manger store of grain.  
Ten thousand years may our great sovereign live,  
And Heaven the wealth and blessing ever give,  
  Which shall his comforting maintain!

</div>
