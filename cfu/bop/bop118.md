#### II

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Shan Yu Ch‘u;* allusive. The folly of not enjoying the good things
which we have, and letting death put them into the hands of others.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>The thorny elms on
the mountains grow,  
And the white elms rise where the grounds are low.  
You have suits of robes which you never wear;  
You have steeds and cars you are fain to spare.  
All these another will have by and by,  
For the time will come when you shall die.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The *k‘ao* trees
thrive on the mountain's brow,  
And the *new* trees rise where the grounds are low.  
Unwatered your courts, your rooms are unwept;  
Your drums and your bells all silent are kept.  
All these another shall have by and by,  
For the time will come when you shall die.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>The varnish trees
on the mountains grow,  
And the chestnuts rise where the grounds are low.  
Why not, at the feast, your lute gayly play,  
To add to your joy, and lengthen the day.  
Another's your house will be by and by,  
For the time will come when you shall die.

</div>
