#### II

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Lieh Tsu;* narrative. Appropriate, probably, like the last piece,
to a sacrifice to Tang,—dwelling on the spirits, the soups, and the
gravity of the service, and on the assisting princes.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

Ah! from our sire, whose merit vast we own,  
What blessings ever upon us come down,  
Abiding, oft-repeated, deeds of grace!  
And you, O king, receive them in this place. <span id="page_480">p.
480</span>  
Here in our vessels shine the spirits clear,  
And Tang himself, much wished for, shall appear.  
Here too are set the soups of flavor rare,  
Tempered, and mixed, with cunning and with care.  
These offerings we set forth, without a word,  
Without contention, and with one accord,  
To beg the presence of the honored lord.  
He will the eyebrows of long life confer,  
And face of wrinkled age, and whitening hair.

With yokes adorned, and naves with leather bound,  
While at the bits the eight bells tinkling sound,  
The feudal princes come, to take their part  
In all the offerings made with rev'rent heart.  
To us the mighty sovereignty was given;  
And prosperous fortune long sent down from Heaven  
Our fruitful harvests clearly prove. And now  
Himself pleased with our service Tang will show,  
And on us blessings without end bestow.  
May Tang regard the rites his son thus pays,  
As round the summer comes, and autumn days!

</div>
