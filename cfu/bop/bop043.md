### XV

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Pei Mên;* metaphorical and narrative. An officer of Wei sets forth,
rather jestingly, his hard lot, and his silence under it in submission
to Heaven.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>My way leads forth
by the gate on the north;  
  My heart is full of woe.  
I hav’n’t a cent, begged, stolen, or lent,  
  And friends forget me so.  
So let it be! ‘tis Heaven's decree.  
What can I say,—a poor fellow like me?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The king has his
throne, sans sorrow or moan;  
  On me fall all his cares,  
And when I come home, resolved not to roam,  
  Each one indignant stares.  
So let it be! ‘tis Heaven's decree.  
What can I say,—a poor fellow like me?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Each thing of the
king, and the fate of the state,  
  On me come more and more.  
And when, sad and worn, I come back forlorn,  
  They thrust me from the door.  
So let it be! ‘tis Heaven's decree.  
What can I say,—a poor fellow like me?

</div>
