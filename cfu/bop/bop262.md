#### IX

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Min Lao;* narrative. In a time of disorder and suffering, some
officer of distinction calls upon his colleagues to join with him to
effect a reformation in the capital, and put away the parties,
especially flattering parasites, who were the cause of the prevailing
misery.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Yes, burdened
sore, the people live in grief,  
But we perchance may give them some relief.  
This is the nation's heart.—Show kindness here,  
And through our regions peace will reappear.  
On wily flatterers look with angry frown,  
Thus warning those who conscience do not own.  
With fierce oppressors deal by strictest law,  
Till of Heaven's will they learn to stand in awe.  
Gentle to men from far, assist those near;—  
So shall the king be strong, with nought to fear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Yes, burdened
sore, the people live in grief,  
But we perchance may give them some relief.  
This is the nation's heart.—Here kindness show,  
And hither all will come with constant flow.  
On wily flatterers look with angry scorn;—  
Lo! noisy braggarts of their pride are shorn. <span id="page_381">p.

The fierce oppressors with strong hand repress;—  
This course the people's sufferings shall redress.  
What service you have done, keep on to do;—  
So shall the king enjoy his rest through you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Yes, burdened
sore, the people live in grief,  
But we perchance may give them some relief.  
Show kindness here.—This is the nations’ heart;—  
Repose will spread from this to every part.  
The indignant face to wily flatterers show,  
Thus awing those whose deeds no limits know.  
The fierce oppressors check with firmest will,  
So hindering them from acting out their ill.  
Then let us keep ourselves with reverent care,  
And to the virtuous for their help repair.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Yes, burdened
sore, the people live in grief,  
But we perchance may give them some relief.  
This is the nation's heart.—Show kindness here,  
And thus dispel the people's anxious fear.  
To wily flatterers no indulgence give,  
Thus warning all who but for evil live.  
The fierce oppressors with strong hand keep down,  
That so the right no more be overthrown. <span id="page_382">p.

As children, for such trust unfit are you,  
But vast the service which you have to do!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>Yes, burdened
sore, the people live in grief,  
But we perchance may give them some relief,  
Show kindness here.— This is the nation's heart;—  
So shall you soothe and heal the people's smart.  
View wily flatterers with indignant eye,  
And from the court the parasites will fly.  
’Gainst fierce oppressors wage determined fight,  
And thus from vile reversal save the right.  
The king us all as priceless jade would prize;—  
Thus therefore I reprove you and advise.
