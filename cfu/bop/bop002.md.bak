## CHAPTER I.

THE EARLY HISTORY AND THE PRESENT TEXT OF THE BOOK OF POETRY.

### SECTION I.

THE BOOK BEFORE CONFUCIUS; AND WHAT, IF ANY, WERE HIS LABOURS UPON IT.

<span class="margnote">Statements of Chinese scholars.</span>1. <span
class="smallcaps">Sze-Ma Ts‘ën</span>, in his memoir of Confucius,
says:—The old poems amounted to more than 3000. Confucius removed those
which were only repetitions of others, and selected those which would be
serviceable for the inculcation of propriety and righteousness.
Ascending as high as Sëeh and How-tseih, and descending through the
prosperous eras of Yin and Chow to the times of decadence under kings
Yëw and Le, he selected in all 305 pieces, which he sang over to his
lute, to bring them into accordance with the musical style of the Shaou,
the Woo, the Ya, and the Sung." This is the first notice which we have
of any compilation of the ancient poems by Confucius, and from it mainly
are derived all the subsequent statements on the subject.

In the History of the Classical Books in the Records of the Suy dynasty
(A.D. 589--618), it is said:—"When odes ceased to be made and collected,
Che, the Grand Music-master of Loo, arranged in order those which were
existing, and made a copy of them. Then Confucius expurgated them; and
going up to the Shang dynasty, and coming down to the State of Loo, he
compiled altogether or 300 pieces."

Gow-yang Sëw (A.D. 1006-1071) endeavours to state particularly what the
work of expurgation performed by Confucius was. "Not only," says he,
"did the sage reject whole poems, but from others he rejected one or
more stanzas; from stanzas he rejected one or more lines; and from lines
he rejected one or more characters."

Choo He (A.D. 1130-1200), whose own classical Work on the Book of Poetry
appeared in A.D. 1178, declined to express himself positively on the
question of the expurgation of the odes, but summed up his view of what
Confucius did for them in the following words:—"Poems had ceased to be
made and collected, and those which were extant were full of errors and
wanting in arrangement. When Confucius returned from Wei to Loo, he
brought with him the odes which he had gotten in other States and
digested them, along with those which were to be found in Loo, into a
collection of 300 pieces."

<span class="margnote">These statements not supported by evidence. The
view of the author.</span>I have not been able to find evidence
sustaining these representations, and propose now to submit to the
reader the considerations which prevent me from concurring in them, and
have brought me to the conclusions that, before the birth of Confucius,
the Book of Poetry existed substantially the same as it was at his
death, and that, while he may have somewhat altered the arrangement of
its Books and odes, the principal service which he rendered to it was
not that of compilation, but the impulse to the study of it which he
communicated to his disciples. The discrepancy in the number of the odes
as given in the above statements will be touched on in a note.

<span class="margnote">The groundlessness of the above
representations.</span>2. If we place Ts‘ëen’s composition of the memoir
of Confucius in B.C. 100, nearly four hundred years will thus have
elapsed between the death of the sage and any statement to the effect
that he expurgated a collection of poems, or compiled previous that
which we now have, consisting of a few over 300 pieces; and no writer in
the interval, so far as we know, had affirmed or implied any such facts.
But independently of this consideration, there is ample evidence to
prove, first, that the poems current before Confucius were not by any
means so numerous as Sze-ma Ts‘ëen says, and, secondly, that the
collection of 300 pieces or thereabouts, digested under the same
divisions as in the present Classic, existed before the sage's time.

<span class="margnote">The old poems were not numerous.</span>3. \[i.\]
It would not be surprising, if, floating about and current among the
people of China, in the 6th century before Christ, there had been even
more than 3000 pieces of poetry. The marvel is that such was not the
case. But in the "Narratives of the States," a Work attributed by some
to Tso K‘ëw-ming, <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) there occur
quotations from 31 poems, made by statesmen and others, all anterior to
Confucius; and of those poems it cannot be pleaded that more than two
are not in the present Classic, while of those two one is an ode of it
quoted under another name. Further, in the Tso Chuen, certainly the work
of Tso K‘ëw-ming, and a most valuable supplement to Confucius’ own Work
of the Chun Ts‘ëw, we have quotations from not fewer than 219 poems; and
of these only thirteen are not found in the Classic. Thus of 250 poems
current in China before the supposed compilation of the Book of Poetry,
236 are found in it, and only 14 are absent. To use the words of Chaou
Yih, a scholar of the present dynasty, of the period K‘ëen-lung (A.D.
1736-1795), "If the poems existing in Confucius’ time had been more than
3000, the quotations found in these two Books of poems now lost should
have been ten times as numerous as the quotations from the 305 pieces
said to have been preserved by him, whereas they are only between a
twenty-first and twenty-second part of those from the existing pieces.
This is sufficient to show that Ts‘ëen’s statement is not worthy of
credit." I have made the widest possible induction from all existing
Records in which there are quotations of poems made anterior to
Confucius, and the conclusion to which I have been brought is altogether
confirmatory of that deduced from the Works of Tso K‘ëw-ming. If
Confucius did make any compilation of poems, he had no such work of
rejection and expurgation to do as is commonly imagined.

<span class="margnote">Proofs of the existence of the Book of Poetry
before the time of Confucius.</span>\[ii.\] But I believe myself that he
did no work at all to which the name of compilation can properly be
applied, but simply adopted an existing collection of poems consisting
of 305, or at most of 311 pieces. Of the existence

of the She, or Book of Poetry, before Confucius, digested under four
divisions, and much in the same order as at present, there may be
advanced the following proofs:—

First, in the "Official Book of Chow," we are told that it belonged to
the grand-master " to teach the six classes of poems,—the *Fung*, with
their descriptive, metaphorical, and allusive pieces, the *Ya*, and the
*Sung*." Mr. Wylie says that the question of the genuineness of the
Official Book may be considered as set at rest since the inquiry into it
by Choo He, and that it is to be accepted as a work of the duke of Chow,
or some other sage of the Chow dynasty. <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) Without committing myself to any opinion on
this point, as I find the passage just quoted in the Preface to the
*She* (of which I shall treat in the next chapter), I cannot but accept
*it* as having been current before Confucius; and thus we have a
distinct reference to a collection of poems, earlier than his time, with
the same division into Parts, and the same classification of the pieces
in those Parts.

Second, in Part II. of the *She*, Book vi., Ode IX.,—an ode assigned to
the time of king Yëw, B.C. 780-770, we have the words,

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

"They sing the *Ya* and the *Nan*,  
Dancing to their flutes without error."

</div>

So early then as the 8th century before our era, there was a collection
of poems, of which some bore the name of the *Nan*, which there is
nothing to forbid our supposing to have been the Chow-nan and the
Shaou-nan, forming the first two Books of the first Part of the present
classic, often spoken of together as the *Nan*; and of which others bore
the name of the *Ya*, being probably the earlier pieces which now
compose a large portion of the second and third Parts.

Third, in the narratives of Tso K‘ëw-ming, under the 29th year of duke
Sëang, B.C. 543, when Confucius was only 8 or 9 years old, we have an
account of a visit to the court of Loo by an envoy from Woo, an eminent
states man of the time, and of great learning. We are told that, as he
wished to hear the music of Chow, which he could do better in Loo than
in any other State, they sang to him the odes of the Chow-nan and the
Shaou-nan; those of P'ei, Yung, and Wei; of the Royal domain; of Ch'ing;
of Ts‘e; of Pin; of Ts‘in; of Wei; of Tang; of Ch'in; of Kwei; and of
Ts’aou. They sang to him also the odes of the Minor Ya and the Greater
Ya; and they sang finally the pieces of the Sung. We have here existing
in the boyhood of Confucius, before he had set his mind on
learning, <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) what we may call the present
Book of Poetry, with its Fung, its Ya, and its Sung. The odes of the
Fung were in 15 Books as now, with merely some slight differences in the
order of their arrangement;—the odes of Pin forming the 9th Book instead
of the 15th, those of Ts‘in the 10th instead of the 11th, those of Wei
the 11th instead of the 9th, and those of T'ang the 12th instead of the
10th. In other respects the *She*, existing in Loo when Confucius was a
mere boy, appears to have been the same as that of which the compilation
has been ascribed to him.

Fourth, in this matter we may appeal to the words of Confucius himself.
Twice in the Analects he speaks of the odes as a collection consisting
of 300 pieces, <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) That Work not being
made on any principle of chronological order, we cannot positively
assign those sayings to any particular periods of Confucius’ life; but
it is, I may say, the unanimous opinion of the critics that they were
spoken before the time to which Sze-ma Ts‘ëen and Choo He refer his
special labour on the Book of Poetry. The reader may be left, with the
evidence which has been set before him, to form his own opinion on the
questions discussed. To my own mind that evidence is decisive on the
points.

The Book of Poetry, arranged very much as we now have it, was current in
China long before the sage; and its pieces were in the mouths of
statesmen and scholars, constantly quoted by them on festive and other
occasions. Poems not included in it there doubtless were, but they were
comparatively few. Confucius may have made a copy for the use of himself
and his disciples; but it does not appear that he rejected any pieces
which had been previously received, or admitted any which had not
previously found a place in the collection.

 

<span class="margnote">Further errors in the statements in the first
Paragraph.</span>4. Having come to the above conclusions, it seems
superfluous to make any further observations on the statements adduced
in the first paragraph. If Confucius expurgated no previous Book, it is
vain to try and specify the nature of his ex purgation as Gow-yang Sëw
did. <span id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) From Sze-ma Ts‘ëen we should
suppose that there were no odes in the *She* later than the time of king
Le, whereas there are 12 of the time of king Hwuy, 13 of that of king
Sëang, and 2 of the time of king Ting. Even the Sung of Lee which are
referred to by the Suy writer and Choo He are not the latest pieces in
the Book. The statement of the former that the odes were arranged in
order and copied by Che, the music-master of Loo, <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) rests on no authority but his own;—more than
a thousand years after the time of Confucius. I shall refer to it again,
however, in the next chapter.

<span class="margnote">Did Confucius then do anything for the Book of
Poetry?</span>5. The question arises now of what Confucius really did
for the Book of Poetry, if, indeed, he did anything at all. The only
thing from which we can hazard the slightest opinion on the point we
have from his own lips. In the Analects, IX. xiv., he tells us:—"I
returned from Wei to Loo, and then the music was reformed, and the
pieces in the Ya and the Sung all found their proper places." The return
from Wei to Loo took place when the sage was in his 69th year, only five
years before his death. He ceased from that time to take active part in
political affairs, and solaced himself with music, the study of the
Classics, the writing of the Ch'un Ts‘ëw, and familiar intercourse with
those of his disciples who still kept about him. He reformed the
music,—that to which the poems were sung; but wherein the reformation
consisted we cannot tell. And he gave to the pieces of the Ya and the
Sung their proper places. The present order of the Books in the Fung,
slightly differing, we have seen, from that which was common in his
boyhood, may also have now been determined by him.

As to the arrangement of the odes in the other Parts of the Work, we
cannot say of what extent it was. What are now called the *correct* Ya
precede the pieces called the Ya *of a changed character* or of a
degenerate age; but there is no chronological order in their following
one an other, and it will be seen, from the notes on the separate odes,
that there are not a few of the latter class, which are illustrations of
a good reign and of the observance of propriety, as much as any of the
former. In the Books of the Sung again, the occurrence of the Praise
songs of Loo between the sacrificial odes of Chow and Shang is an
anomaly for which we try in vain to discover a reasonable explanation.

<span class="margnote">Confucius’ service to the *She* was in the
impulse which he gave to the study of it.</span>6. While we cannot
discover, therefore, any peculiar labours of Confucius on the Book of
Poetry, and we have it now, as will be shown in the next section,
substantially as he found it already compiled to his hand, the
subsequent preservation of it may reasonably be attributed to the
admiration which he expressed for it, and the enthusiasm for it with
which he sought to inspire his disciples. It was one of the themes on
which he delighted to converse with them. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) He taught that it is from the odes that the
mind receives its best stimulus. <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) A man
ignorant of them was, in his opinion, like one who stands with his face
to wards a wall, limited In his views, and unable to advance. <span
id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) Of the two things which his son could
specify as particularly enjoined on him by the sage, the first was that
be should learn the odes. <span id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md) In this way
Confucius, probably, contributed largely to the subsequent preservation
of the Book of Poetry;—the preservation of the tablets on which the odes
were inscribed, and the preservation of it in the memories of all who
venerated his authority, and looked up to him as their master.

### SECTION II.

THE BOOK OF POETRY FROM THE TIME OF CONFUCIUS TILL THE GENERAL
ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE PRESENT TEXT.

<span class="margnote">From Confucius to the dynasty of Ts‘in.</span>1.
<span class="smallcaps">Of</span> the attention paid to the study of the
Book of Poetry from the death of Confucius to the rise of the Ts‘in
dynasty, we have abundant evidence in the writings of his grandson
Tsze-sze, of Mencius, and of Seun K‘ing. One of the acknowledged
distinctions of Mencius is his acquaintance with the odes, of which his
canon for the study of them pre fixed to my larger volumes is a proof;
and Seun K‘ing survived the extinction of the Chow dynasty, and lived on
into the times of Ts‘in.

<span class="margnote">The Poems were all recovered after the fires of
Ts‘in.</span>2. The Poems shared in the calamity which all the other
classical Works, excepting the Yih, suffered, when the tyrant of Ts‘in
issued his edict for their destruction. But I have shown, in the
prolegomena to vol. I., that only a few years elapsed between the
execution of his decree and the establishment of the Han dynasty, which
distinguished itself by its labours to restore the monuments of ancient
literature. The odes were all, or very nearly all, recovered; <span
id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md) and the reason assigned for this is, that
their preservation depended on the memory of scholars more than on their
inscription upon tablets and silk. We shall find reason to accept this
statement.

<span class="margnote">Three different texts.</span>3. Three different
texts of the odes made their appearance early in the Han dynasty, known
as the She of Loo, of Ts‘e, and of Han; that is, the Book of Poetry was
recovered from three different quarters.

<span class="margnote">The Text of Loo.</span>\[i.\] Lëw Hin’s
catalogue <span id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md) of the Works in the
imperial library of the earlier Han dynasty commences, on the She King,
with a Collection of the three Texts in 28 chapters, which is followed
by two Works of commentary on the Text of Loo. The former of them was by
a Shin P‘ei, of whom we have some account in the Literary Biographies of
Han. He was a native of Loo, and had received his own knowledge of the
odes from a scholar of Ts‘e, called Fow K‘ëw-pih. He was resorted to by
many disciples, whom he taught to repeat the odes, but without entering
into discussion with them on their interpretation. When the first
emperor of the Han dynasty was passing through Loo, Shin followed him to
the capital of that State, and had an interview with him. The emperor
Woo, in the beginning of his reign (B.C. 139), sent for him to court
when he was more than 80 years old; and he appears to have survived a
considerable number of years beyond that advanced age. The Dames of ten
of his disciples are given, all men of eminence, and among them K‘ung
Gan-kwoh. A little later, the most noted adherent of the school of Loo
was a Wei Hëen, who arrived at the dignity of prime minister, and
published "the She of Loo in Stanzas and Lines." Up and down in the
Books of Han and Wei are to be found quotations of the odes, which must
have been taken from the professors of the Loo recension; but neither
the text nor the writings on it long survived. They are said to have
perished during the Tsin dynasty (A.D. 265-419). When the catalogue of
the Suy library was made, none of them were existing.

<span class="margnote">The Text of Ts‘e.</span>\[ii.\] The Han catalogue
mentions five different works on the She of Ts‘e. This text was from a
Yuen Koo, a native of Ts‘e, about whom we learn, from the same chapter
of Literary Biographies, that he was one of the Great scholars of the
court in the time of he emperor King (B.C. 155-142), a favourite with
him, and specially distinguished for his knowledge of the odes and his
advocacy of orthodox Confucian doctrine. He died in the next reign of
Woo, more than 90 years old; and we are told that all the scholars of
Ts‘e who got a name in those days for their acquaintance with the She
sprang from his school. Among his disciples is the well known name of
Hëa-how Ch‘e-ch‘ang, who communicated his acquisitions to How Ts‘ang, a
native of the present Shan-tung province, and author of two of the Works
in the Han catalogue. How had three disciples of eminence,—Yih Fung,
Sëaou Wang-che, and K‘wang Hang. From them the Text of Ts‘e was
transmitted to others, whose names, with quotations from their writings,
are scattered through the Books of Han. Neither text nor commentaries,
however, had a better fate than the She of Loo. There is no mention of
them in the catalogue of Suy. They are said to have perished even before
the rise of the Tsin dynasty.

<span class="margnote">The Text of Han Ying.</span>\[iii.\] The Text of
Han was somewhat more fortunate. The Han catalogue contains the titles
of four works, all by Han Ying, whose surname is thus perpetuated in the
text of the She which emanated from him. His biography follows that of
How Ts'ang. He was a native, we are told, of the province of Yen, and a
"Great scholar" in the time of the emperor Wan (B.C. 178-156), and on
into the reigns of King and Woo. "He laboured," it is said, "to unfold
the meaning of the odes, and published an 'Explanation of the Text' and
'Illustrations of the She,' containing several myriads of characters.
His text was somewhat different from the texts of the She of Loo and
Ts‘e, but substantially of the same meaning." Of course Han founded a
school; but while almost all the writings of his followers soon
perished, both the Works just mentioned continued on through the various
dynasties to the time of Sung. The Suy catalogue contains the titles of
his text and two Works on it; the Pang those of his text and his
Illustrations; but when we come to the catalogue of Sung, published in
the time of the Yuen dynasty, we find only the Illustrations, in 10
Books or chapters; and Gow-yang Sëw tells us that in his time this was
all of Han that remained. It continues, entire or nearly so, to the
present day.

<span class="margnote">A fourth Text; that of Maou.</span>4. But while
these three different recensions of the She all disappeared, with the
exception of a single fragment, their unhappy fate was owing not more to
the convulsions by which the empire was often rent, and the consequent
destruction of literary monuments, such as we have witnessed in our own
day in China, than to the appearance of a fourth Text which displaced
them by its superior correctness, and the ability with which it was
advocated and commented on. This was what is called the "Text of Maou.
It came into the field later than the others; but the Han catalogue
contains the She of Maou in 29 chapters, and a commentary on the text in
30. According to Ch‘ing K‘ang-shing, the author of this commentary was a
native of Lee, known as Maou Hang or the Greater Maou, who was a
disciple, we are told by Luh Tih-ming, of Seun K‘ing. The Work is lost.
He had communicated his knowledge of the She, however, to another
Maou,—Maou Chang, or the Lesser Maou,—who was "a Great scholar" at the
court of king Hëen of Ho-këen. <span id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md) This
king Hëen was one of the most diligent labourers in the recovery of the
ancient Books, and presented Maou's text and the Work of Hang at the
court of the emperor King,—probably in B.C. 129. Chang himself published
his "Explanations of the She," in 29 chapters, which still remain; but
it was not till the reign of the emperor P‘ing (A.D. 1-5) that Maou's
recension was received into the imperial college, and took its place
along with those of Lee, Ts‘e, and Han.

The Chinese critics have carefully traced the line of scholars who had
charge of Maou's text and explanations down to the reign of P'ing;—Kwan
Ch‘ang-k‘ing, Hëae Yen-nëen, and Seu Gaou. To Seu Gaou succeeded Ch‘in
Këah, who was in office at the court of the usurper Wang Mang (A.D.
9-22). He transmitted his treasures to Sëay Man-k‘ing, who himself
commented on the She; and from him they passed to the well-known Wei
King-chung or Wei Hwang, of whom I shall have to speak in the next
chapter. From this time the most famous scholars addicted themselves to
Maou's text. Këa Kwei (A.D. 25-101) published a Work on the "Meaning and
Difficulties of Maou's She," having previously compiled a digest of the
differences between its text and those of the other three recensions, at
the command of the emperor Ming (A.D. 58-75). Ma Yung (A.D. 69-165)
followed with another commentary;—and we arrive at Ch‘ing Heuen, or
Ching K‘ang-shing, who wrote his "Supplementary Commentary to the She of
Maou," and his "Chronological Introduction to the She." The former of
these two Works complete, and portions of the latter, are still extant.
That the former has great defects as well as great merits, there can be
no question; but it took possession of the literary world of China, and
after the time of Ch'ing the other three texts were little heard of,
while the names of the commentators on Maou's text and his explanations
of it speedily become very numerous. Maou's grave is still shown near
the village of Tsun-fuh, in the departmental district of Ho-këen.

<span class="margnote">The different texts guarantee the integrity of
the recovered She.</span>5. Returning now to what I said in the 2nd
paragraph, it will be granted that the appearance of three different and
independent texts, immediately after the rise of the Han dynasty,
affords the most satisfactory evidence of the recovery of the Book of
Poetry, as it had continued from the time of Confucius. Unfortunately
only fragments of them remain now; but we have seen that they were
diligently compared by competent scholars with one another, and with the
fourth text of Maou, which subsequently got the field to itself. In the
body of the larger Work attention is called to many of their peculiar
readings; and it is clear to me that their variations from one another
and from Maou's text arose from the alleged fact that the preservation
of the odes was owing to their being transmitted by recitation.<span
class="margnote">The texts were all taken down at, from
recitation.</span> The rhyme helped the memory to retain them, and while
wood, bamboo, and silk were all consumed by the flames of Ts‘in, when
the time of repression ceased scholars would be eager to rehearse their
stores. it was inevitable that the same sounds, when taken down by
different writers, should in many cases be represented by different
characters. Accepting the text as it exists, we have no reason to doubt
that it is a near approximation to that which was current in the time of
Confucius.…

to say that they were 305 or 311. The Classic now contains the text of
305 pieces, and the titles of other 6. It is contended by Choo and many
other scholars, that in Confucius’ time the text of those six was
already lost, or rather that the titles were names of tunes only. More
likely is the view that the text of these pieces was lost after
Confucius’ death.
