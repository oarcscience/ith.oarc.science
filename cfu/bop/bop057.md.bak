<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Tsai Ch‘ih;* narrative. The baroness Mu of Hsü complains of not
being allowed to go to Wei to condole with the marquis on the desolation
of his state, and appeal to some great Powers on its behalf.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>  I wished to urge
my steeds, and drive  
    To Wei, to share my brother's grief,  
  Not slacking till we should arrive  
    And halt at Ts‘ao, and find relief.  
Another went, o’er hill, through stream, cross plain;  
Here in deep sorrow I must still remain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>What I wished for
you denied;  
Here in Hsü I must abide.  
And in your decision's spite  
I must hold my purpose right. <span id="page_59">p. 59</span>  
You, unkind, my purpose spurn;—  
Not to Wei can I return.  
I must slight your views as nought,  
For I cannot quench my thought.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>  I'll climb the
sides of that steep mound,  
    And pluck the lilies growing there.  
  Thoughts in my woman's heart abound,  
    And every thought might blossom bear.  
In Hsü the people all my purpose blame;  
Their childish, hasty thoughts cause me no shame.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>I would through
the land have gone,  
Passed where fields of rich wheat shone,  
Prayer have made to Ch‘i’s great state,  
Help have sought for Wei's sore strait.  
Nobles who o’er Wei preside,  
Zeal like this you should not chide.  
Hundreds are the plans you make;  
Best the course I wished to take!

</div>
