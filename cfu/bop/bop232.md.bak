#### IV

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Chio Kung;* allusive, narrative, and metaphorical. Against the
king's cold treatment of his relatives by consanguinity and affinity;
the extensive and baneful influence of his example; the encouragement
given by him to calumniators.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Whene’er we
strongly bend a bow,  
  Both string and ends we near us bring;  
And when we let the tension go,  
  From us with quick recoil they spring.  
So when we show affection deep,  
  Our kith and kin to us we draw;  
But when from them aloof we keep,  
  They shrink from us by nature's law.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>When you, O king,
to kin are cold,  
  Such coldness rules throughout the land.  
You for their teacher all men hold;  
  To learn your ways needs no command.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Brethren whose
virtue stands the test,  
  By bad example still unchanged,  
Their generous feelings manifest,  
  Nor grow among themselves estranged.  
But if their virtue weakly fails  
  The evil influence to withstand,  
Then selfishness o’er love prevails,  
  And troubles rise on every hand. <span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>When men in
disputations fine  
  To hear their consciences refuse,  
Then ’gainst each other they repine,  
  And each maintains his special views.  
If one a place of rank obtain,  
  And scorn humility to show,  
The others view him with disdain,  
  And, wrangling, all to ruin go.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>A colt the old
horse deems himself,  
  And vainly hastens to the race;  
So thinks the mean man, bent on pelf,  
  Himself fit for the highest place:  
Stuffed to the full, he still shall feed,  
  Nor own that he has had enough.  
He drinks, and with insatiate greed,  
  Knows not the time for leaving off.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>The monkeys by
their nature know  
  The way to climb a tree, untaught.  
We need no mud on him to throw,  
  Whom lying in the mud we've caught.  
The nature of all meaner men  
  Leads them to follow and obey.  
Nor right, nor wrong the millions ken,  
  But imitate the sovereign's way.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7">7</span></span>The snow falls
fast, and all the ground  
  Hides with its masses, white and clear;  
But when the sunbeams play around,  
  It soon will melt and disappear. <span id="page_314">p. 314</span>  
This fact, O king, you don't perceive;  
  Those men who calumnies diffuse,  
Not heeding, to themselves you leave,  
  And your indulgence they abuse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8">8</span></span>Yes, though the
snow lie drifted deep,  
  Away before the heat ’twill flow.  
I for the king's neglect must weep;—  
  Like Man or Mao those men will grow.
