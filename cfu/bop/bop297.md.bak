#### III

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ching Chih;* narrative. The young king shows his sense of what was
required of him to preserve the favor of Heaven, a constant judge;
intimates his good purposes; and asks the help of his ministers to be
enabled to fulfill them.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

With reverence I will go  
  Where duty's path is plain.  
Heaven's will I clearly know;  
  Its favor to retain <span id="page_453">p. 453</span>  
Is hard. Let me not say  
  Heaven is remote on high,  
Nor notices men's way.  
  There in the starlit sky  
It round about us moves,  
  Inspecting all we do,  
And daily disapproves  
  What is not just and true.

Only a child am I.  
  Treading in duty's way,  
With effort vain I try  
  Due reverence to display.  
Each day throughout the year,  
  How slight the progress seems!  
But to the vision clear  
  I'll pass from broken gleams.  
Aid then my feeble youth  
  To bear the heavy crown.  
Teach me the right and truth  
  Through all my life to own.

</div>
