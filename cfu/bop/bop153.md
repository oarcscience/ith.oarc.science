The *Fou Yu;* metaphorical. Against some parties in the state, occupied
with frivolous pursuits, and oblivious of important matters.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Like splendid
robes appear the wings  
  Of the ephemeral fly;  
And such the pomp of those great men,  
  Which soon in dust shall lie!  
I grieve! Would they but come to me!  
  To teach them I should try.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The wings of the
ephemeral fly  
  Are robes of colors gay;  
And such the glory of those men,  
  Soon crumbling to decay!  
I grieve! Would they but rest with me,  
  They’d learn a better way!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>The ephemeral fly
bursts from its hole,  
  With gauzy wings like snow;  
So quick the rise, so quick the fall,  
  Of those great men we know!  
I grieve! Would they but lodge with me,  
  Forth they would wiser go.
