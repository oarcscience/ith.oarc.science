#### VI

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Nan Shan;* allusive. On the disgraceful connection between Wên
Chiang, the marchioness of Lu, and her brother;—against Hsiang of Ch'i
and Huan of Lu.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>There where the
south hill rises high and great  
  A male fox sits, suspicious and alone.  
Ch‘i’s daughter went to Lu, to wed her mate;  
  The pathway, plain and easy, is well known.  
From you, her brother, thus away she went;  
Why further think of her, like fox intent?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The dolichos five
kinds of shoes supplies,  
  Made always so that two shall form a pair.  
On caps they match the strings that serve for ties,  
  The same in length, not differing a hair. <span id="page_110">p.
110</span>  
The road to Lu all plain and easy lies,  
  By which Ch‘i’s daughter joined her husband there.  
Since she has traveled that way leaving you,  
Why do you her continue to pursue?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Hemp seed to sow,
this is the course we take,—  
  The acres lengthwise and across we dress.  
Taking a wife, the thing at once we make  
  Known to our parents, and their leave possess.  
Since, prince of Lu, Ch‘i’s daughter thus you took;—  
Why on her evil ways indulgent look?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>How do we act when
firewood we would split?  
  ’Tis through the ax in hand that we succeed.  
Taking a wife, this form we must admit,—  
  Without the go-between we cannot speed.  
When you brought home your wife, all this was done;—  
Why let her now to such excesses run?
