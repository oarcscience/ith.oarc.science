*The Book of Poetry*, tr. by James Legge, \[1876\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

#### VIII

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Liao O;* metaphorical, narrative, and allusive. A son deplores his
hard fate in being prevented from rendering the last services to his
parents, and enlarges on the parental claim.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Long and large the
*O* plants grow.  
*Hao* plants surely I should know!  
How can I confound them so?  
Grief has robbed my eyes of sight,  
Almost plunging me in night.  
Others' hands laid in the grave,  
Those whose pain my being gave.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Long and large the
*O* plants grow.  
*Wei* plants surely I should know!  
How can I confound them so?  
Grief has robbed my eyes of sight,  
Almost plunging me in night.  
Others’ hands laid in the earth,  
Those whose suffering gave me birth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Pitcher should be
filled from vase;  
Where this fails, ‘tis reckoned base.  
Than to live as orphan left,  
Better be of life bereft! <span id="page_267">p. 267</span>  
Father dead, on whom depend?  
Mother dead, where find a friend?  
I, abroad, this sad case know,  
And, at home, can nowhere go.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Father, from whose
loins I sprung,  
Mother, on whose breast I hung,  
Tender were ye, and ye fed,  
Now upheld, now gently led.  
Eyes untiring watched my way;  
Often in your arms I lay.  
How could I repay your love,  
Vast as arch of heaven above?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>Cold and bleak
that southern hill!  
Tempest fierce with terror thrill.  
All around is dark, but more  
Dark the lot which I deplore!  
Others all can happy be;—  
Why from grief am I not free?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>Hill so steep what
foot can brave?  
Blustering winds around it rave.  
Fierce the winds! As fierce the fate,  
Which pursues me desolate!  
Happy all save me alone,  
Thinking aye of dues undone!

</div>
