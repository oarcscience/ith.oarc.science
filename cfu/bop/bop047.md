<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>The two youths
went into their boats,  
Whose shadow on the water floats.  
    What evil to them came?  
Anxious and wondering, long we muse;  
Our hearts are tossed with tossing views.  
    Some one must be to blame.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Into their boats
the two youths passed,  
And on the stream were carried fast.  
    What was there to alarm?  
With longing thought we fain would trace,  
The secret of their ill-starred race.  
    Did they not come to harm?

</div>
