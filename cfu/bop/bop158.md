<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ch‘ih Hsiao;* metaphorical. The duke of Chou, in the person of a
bird, whose young ones have been destroyed by an owl, vindicates the
decisive course he had taken with rebellion.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Owl, O owl, hear
my request,  
And do not, owl, destroy my nest.  
  You have taken my young,  
  Though I over them hung,  
With the nursing of love and of care.  
Pity me, pity me! Hear my prayer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Ere the clouds the
sky had obscured,  
The mulberry roots I secured.  
  Door and window around,  
  Them so firmly I bound,  
That I said, casting downward my eyes,  
"Dare any of you my house despise?"

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>I tugged with my
claws and I tore,  
And my mouth and my claws were sore.  
  So the rushes I sought,  
  And all other things brought;  
For to perfect the house I was bent,  
And I grudged no toil with this intent. <span id="page_175">p.
175</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>My wings are
deplorably torn,  
And my tail is much injured and worn.  
  Tossed about by the wind,  
  While the rain beats unkind,  
Oh! my house is in peril of harm,  
And this note I scream out in alarm.

</div>
