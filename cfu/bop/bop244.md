## PART III

## GREATER ODES OF THE KINGDOM

### <span class="smallcaps">Book I. Decade of King Wên</span>

#### I

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Wên Wang;* narrative. Celebrating King Wên, dead and alive, as the
founder of the dynasty of Chou, showing how his virtues drew to him the
favoring regard of Heaven, and made him a bright pattern to his
descendants and their ministers.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>The royal Wên now
rests on high,  
Enshrined in brightness of the sky.  
Chou as a state had long been known,  
And Heaven's decree at last was shown.  
Its lords had borne a glorious name;  
God kinged them when the season came.  
King Wên ruled well when earth he trod;  
Now moves his spirit near to God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>A strong-willed,
earnest king was Wên,  
And still his fame rolls widening on. <span id="page_332">p.
332</span>  
The gifts that God bestowed on Chou  
Belong to Wên's descendants now.  
Heaven blesses still with gifts divine  
The hundred scions of his line;  
And all the officers of Chou  
From age to age more lustrous grow.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>More lustrous
still-from age to age,  
All reverent plans their zeal engage;  
And brilliant statesmen owe their birth  
To this much.-favored spot of earth.  
They spring like products of the land,—  
The men by whom the realm doth stand.  
Such aid their numerous bands supply,  
That Wan, rests tranquilly on high.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Deep were Wên's
thoughts, sustained his ways;  
His reverence lit its trembling rays.  
Resistless came great Heaven's decree;  
The sons of Shang must bend the knee;— <span id="page_333">p.
333</span>  
The sons of Shang, each one a king,  
In numbers beyond numbering.  
Yet as God spoke, so must it be:—  
The sons of Shang all bent the knee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>Now each to Chou
his homage pays,—  
So dark and changing are Heaven's ways.  
When we pour our libations here,  
The officers of Shang appear,  
Quick and alert to give their aid;—  
Such is the service by them paid,  
While still, they do not cast aside  
The cap and broidered ax,—their pride.  
Ye servants of our line of kings,  
Remember him from whom it springs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>Remember him from
whom it springs;—  
Let this give to your virtue wings.  
Seek harmony with Heaven's great mind;—  
So shall you surest blessing find.  
Ere Shang had lost the nation's heart,  
Its monarchs all with God had part  
In sacrifice. From them you see  
’Tis hard to keep high Heaven's decree. <span id="page_334">p.
334</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7">7</span></span>’Tis hard to keep
high Heaven's decree!  
O sin not, or you cease to be.  
To add true luster to your name,  
See Shang expire in Heaven's dread flame.  
For Heaven's high dealings are profound,  
And far transcend all sense and sound.  
From Wên your pattern you must draw,  
And all the states will own your law.
