#### III

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Hsiao Pien;* allusive and narrative. The eldest son and heir
apparent of King Yu bewails his degradation, and the ease with which the
king was led away by slanderers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>To the trees that
are their home,  
Flying slow, the crows all come.  
Other men can happy be;  
Ne’er am I from misery free. <span id="page_255">p. 255</span>  
Have I Heaven offended sore?  
Surely guilt lies at my door.  
Homeless thus, oppressed with grief,  
Nowhere can I find relief.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Once the road was
clear to Chou,  
O’er it the rank grass grows now.  
On my heart is sorrow's blight;  
Ache my limbs as after fight.  
Through the night, still dressed, I sigh;  
Ere its time, old age comes nigh.  
Homeless thus, I find no rest,  
Head and heart alike distressed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Men with reverence
always view  
Trees that round their homesteads grew.  
On their fathers all depend,  
In their mothers have a friend.  
From my father's loins I sprung,  
On my mother's breast I hung;  
Yet did Heaven my being give,  
’Neath a baleful star to live. <span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Where cicadas’
voices ring,  
Willow trees luxuriant spring.  
Deep the waters of that pool,  
Fringed with reeds and rushes cool!  
But like boat adrift I'm borne,  
Aimless, tossed about, forlorn.  
Sad my heart! I try in vain  
Briefest rest from thought to gain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>Mark the stag's
reluctant feet  
Slowly from the herd retreat.  
Crows the pheasant at the dawn,  
And his mate is to him drawn.  
Stript of branch and lea, that tree  
Is the image true of me.  
Sad my heart! I'm left alone,  
Unbefriended and unknown.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>See the hare for
mercy crave!  
One steps in its life to save.  
When a corpse unburied lies,  
Some one straight a grave supplies. <span id="page_257">p. 257</span>  
Callous monarch, all our woes  
Ne’er wake thy compunction's throes.  
Sad my heart beneath thy frown,  
And my tears fall ceaseless down!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7">7</span></span>Slanders vile the
king believes;  
Them as pledge cup he receives.  
Truthful judgment he denies,  
And to stifle kindness tries.  
Trees are felled where helps the strain,  
Fagots cleft along the grain.  
Leaves our king the guilty free,  
While he guilt imputes to me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8">8</span></span>Men will climb the
greatest height;  
Deepest springs their search invite.  
O’er his words the king should watch;  
Ears are set each word to catch.  
Leave my dam, ye slanderers base;  
Move not basket from its place.  
Vainly thus, despised, I moan;  
Dark my future, though unknown!
