#### IV

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Yü Po;* allusive and narrative. In praise of King Wên, celebrating
his activity, influence, and capacity to rule.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Abundant grow the
oaks, and round them rise  
A mass of shrubs, both yielding large supplies  
  Of firewood, or to burn or store.  
In grace and grandeur shone our prince and king;  
From left and right all haste, and to him cling,  
  As bent from him to part no more. <span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>In grace and
grandeur shone our prince and king.  
At sacrifice his ministers all bring  
  Their cups, each handle half a mace.  
Solemn and grave, on left and right they stand,  
And pour libations with a reverent hand;—  
  Well do such men the service grace!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Upon the king the
boats are borne along,  
As to their oars the rowers bend, and strong  
  Impel them to their utmost speed.  
So marched our king in his avenging wrath,  
His six hosts swiftly following on his path;—  
  How could his plans fail to succeed?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>The Milky Way
reveals its span on high,  
With light and beauty bright’ning all the sky;—  
  Men view it with admiring gaze.  
Long lived the king, and lasting influence shed  
Throughout the land, where his great son displayed  
  The glorious issues of his ways.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>The vessels,
formed of metal and of jade,  
By graver's tools are still more precious made;—  
  With grace their worth is thus combined. <span id="page_343">p.
343</span>  
Unceasing were the labors of our king;  
East, west, north, south, his laws and rules shall bring  
  The reverent homage of each mind.

</div>
