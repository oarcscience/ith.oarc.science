<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Chang Ti;* allusive and narrative. Setting forth the close relation
and affection that ought to obtain between brothers.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>      With mass of
gorgeous flowers  
      The cherry trees are crowned,  
But none within this world of ours  
      Like brothers can be found.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>      When awful
death comes near,  
      ’Tis brothers sympathize.  
When headlong flight fills plain and height,  
      To brother brother flies. <span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>      See how the
wagtail's head  
      Quick answers to its tail!  
When hardships great befall our state,  
      Friends, are of no avail.  
      In times of urgent need,  
      We brothers’ help receive.  
Then friends, though good, of different blood,  
      Long sighs will only heave.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>      Brothers
indoors may fight;  
      But insults from without  
Join them at once, and they unite  
      The common foe to rout.  
      In cases such as this,  
      In vain to friends we turn.  
They may be true, but they'll eschew  
      The danger they discern.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>      Deaths and
disorder o’er,  
      ’Mid peace and rest now cold,  
Some men, alas! their brothers pass,  
      Nor them as friends will hold. <span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>      With dishes
in array,  
      The cup may oft go round;  
But only where brothers are there,  
      The feast is truly found.  
      ’Tis when they all appear,  
      And each is in his place,  
That childlike joy, without alloy,  
      Crowns harmony with grace.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7">7</span></span>      Children and
wife we love;  
      Union with them is sweet  
As lute's soft strain that soothes our pain.  
      How joyous do we meet!  
      But brothers, more than they,  
      Can satisfy the heart.  
’Tis *their* accord does peace afford,  
      And lasting joy impart.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8">8</span></span>      For ordering
of your homes,  
      For joy with child and wife,  
Consider well the truth I tell;—  
      This is the charm of life!
