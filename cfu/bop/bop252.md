#### IX

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Hsia Wu;* narrative. In praise of King Wu, walking in the ways of
his forefathers, and by his filial piety securing the throne to himself
and his posterity.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Kings die in Chou,
and others rise,  
  And in their footsteps tread.  
Three had there been, and all were wise;  
  And still they ruled, though dead.  
Ta, Chi, and Wên were all in heaven,  
When Wu to follow them was given.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Yes, Wu to follow
them was given.  
  To imitate his sires,  
And to obey the will of Heaven,  
  He ardently desires.  
Through all his course this aim endured,  
And this the people's trust secured. <span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Yes, Wu secured
the people's faith,  
  And gave to all the law  
Of filial duty, which till death  
  Shining in him they saw.  
Such piety possessed his mind;  
Such pattern did he leave behind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Thus the one man
was Wu—the one,  
  The king, whom all did love.  
They saw in him the pattern son;  
  Such sons to be they strove.  
The filial aim in him bright shone;  
In him were seen the dead and gone.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>In Wu his sires
were thus brought back.  
  The kings that from him spring,  
Continuing in his steps to walk,  
  Upon themselves shall bring,  
Through myriad years, to Chou still given,  
The blessing of impartial Heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>Ah! yes, Heaven's
blessing will descend,  
  And men their names shall bless.  
Thousands from Chou's remotest end,  
  Their praises shall express.  
Their sway through myriad years shall last,  
Nor helpers fail, strong friends and fast.

</div>
