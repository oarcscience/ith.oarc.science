#### VI

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Chi Jih;* narrative. Celebrating a hunting expedition by King Hsüan
on a smaller scale, attended by the officers of the court, and within
the royal domain.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>The day *Mow-shin*
was lucky found;  
  Then to the sire of steeds we prayed.  
Our cars and teams and gear were good;  
  We scour the heights where wild game strayed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>And *Keng-wu* also
lucky proved;  
  We picked our steeds, and chose our ground,—  
Where stags and does by Ts‘eih and Ts‘eu  
  Made sport for him whom Heaven had crowned.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>We viewed the
plain where teeming game  
  Now shivering stand, now frantic run;  
Here two, there three. We charged along,  
  Pleasure to yield to Heaven's great son.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>We bend our bows;
our shafts we grasp;  
  There lies the huge behemoth low,  
And boars are pierced:—spoil for the guests,  
  At court, when wine cups overflow.

</div>
