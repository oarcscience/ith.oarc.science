<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>How glossy is the
lambkin's fur,  
  Smooth to the touch, and fair to view!  
In it arrayed, that officer  
  Rests in his lot, to virtue true.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>With leopard
cuffs, the lambkin's fur  
  Seems made for wearer strong in fight.  
It well becomes that officer,  
  Whom none will see swerve from the right.

of lambkin's fur,  
  With its three decorations grand!  
It well beseems that officer,  
  The pride and glory of our land.
