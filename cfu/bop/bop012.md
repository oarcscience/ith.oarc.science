*The Book of Poetry*, tr. by James Legge, \[1876\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### IX

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Han Kuang;* allusive and metaphorical. The virtuous manners of the
young women about the Han and Kiang rivers.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>High and
compressed, the southern trees  
  No shelter from the sun afford.  
The girls free ramble by the Han,  
  But will not hear enticing word. <span id="page_9">p. 9</span>  
    Like the broad Han are they,  
      Through which one cannot dive;  
    And like the Kiang's long stream,  
      Wherewith no raft can strive.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Many the fagots
bound and piled;  
  The thorns I'd hew still more to make.  
As brides, those girls their new homes seek;  
  Their colts to feed I'd undertake.  
    Like the broad Han are they,  
      Through which one cannot dive;  
    And like the Kiang's long stream,  
      Wherewith no raft can strive.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Many the fagots
bound and piled;  
  The southernwood I'd cut for more.  
As brides, those girls their new homes seek;  
  Food for their colts I'd bring large store.  
    Like the broad Han are they,  
      Through which one cannot dive;  
    And like the Kiang's long stream,  
      Wherewith no raft can strive.

</div>
