The *Yu Ti Chih Tu;* metaphorical. Some one regrets the poverty of his
circumstances, which prevented him from gathering around him companions
whom he admired.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>On the left of the
way, a russet pear tree  
Stands there all alone,—a fit image of me.  
There is that princely man! O that he would come,  
And in my poor dwelling with me be at home!  
In the core of my heart do I love him, but say,  
Whence shall I procure him the wants of the day. <span id="page_136">p.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>At the bend in the
way a russet pear tree  
Stands there all alone,—a fit image of me.  
There is that princely man! O that he would come.  
And rambling with me be himself here at home!  
In the core of my heart I love him, but say,  
Whence shall I procure him the wants of the day.
