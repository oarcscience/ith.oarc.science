#### IX

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Liao Hsiao;* allusive. A festal ode, on occasion of the king's
entertaining the feudal princes who have come to his court.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>  Tall grows the
fragrant southernwood,  
    On which the dew shines bright.  
  Now that my noble men I see,  
    My anxious heart feels light.  
We feast, while smiles and chat our joy proclaim;  
Such guests deserve prosperity and fame.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>  Tall grows the
fragrant southernwood,  
    On which thick lies the dew.  
  The presence of these noble men  
    Gives grace and glory too.  
From error's taint is their pure virtue free;  
Long may they live, and ne’er forgotten be! <span id="page_209">p.
209</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>  Tall grows the
fragrant southernwood,  
    With dew all over wet.  
  Joyful and unconstrained these guests  
    Share the rich feast here set.  
In concord with their brothers may they dwell,  
And happy age their virtue's praises tell!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>  Tall grows the
fragrant southernwood,  
    On which rich lies the dew.  
  The rein ends of these noble men  
    At once engaged my view.  
At dawn they hung, while the bells tinkled sweet  
From bar and bit. All good upon them meet!

</div>
