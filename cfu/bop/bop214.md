### <span class="smallcaps">Book VI. The Decade of Pei Shan</span>

#### I

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Pei Shan;* narrative. An officer complains of the arduous and
continual duties unequally imposed upon him, and keeping him away from
his parents, while others were left to enjoy their ease.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>I climb that hill
upon the north,  
  And gather medlars on its side.  
Active and vigorous, I go forth,  
  And morn and night I walk or ride.  
I serve the king with eager will;  
But great the grief my parents feel!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Where’er their
arch the heavens expand,  
  The king can claim the land below.  
Within the seabounds of the land,  
  All at his summons come or go.  
His ministers unfairly act;  
They praise me, but with toils distract. <span id="page_274">p.
274</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Four ceaseless
steeds my care engage;  
  The king's affairs no rest allow.  
They say I bear no trace of age,  
  While few, they think, such vigor show.  
While my backbone remains unbent,  
In work my life must still be spent.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Some rest in
careless ease, supine;  
  Some for the state themselves wear out.  
On softest couches some recline;  
  Others, unhalting, march about.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>Some never hear a
clamorous sound;  
  Others toil on ’midst rude alarms.  
Some idle on their backs are found;  
  And some bear loads with head and arms.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>Some feast, and
fearless seek new joys;  
  Some live in constant dread of blame.  
Some the harsh critic's work employs;  
  Others their numerous duties claim.
