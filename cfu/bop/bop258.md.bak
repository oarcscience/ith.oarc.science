<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Chia Lo;* narrative. In praise of some king,—perhaps King
Ch‘êng,—whose virtue secured to him the favor of Heaven; presaging for
him all happiness, and especially a line of distinguished posterity.
Probably the response of the personators of the departed to the
preceding piece.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>What brilliant
virtue does our king,  
  Whom all admire and love, display!  
People and officers all sing  
  The praise of his impartial sway.  
Heaven to his sires the kingdom gave,  
  And him with equal favor views.  
Heaven's strength and aid will ever save  
  The throne whose grant it oft renews.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>By virtue sought,
fresh honors shine;  
  All other blessings follow sure. <span id="page_370">p. 370</span>  
Admired and reverent, lo! his line  
  Through myriad ages shall endure.  
From error free, to duty true,  
  They rule the states, they fill the throne.  
Nor shall they fail with homage due  
  The olden statutes aye to own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>A bearing high and
self-restrained  
  May they in all their conduct show!  
And thus their virtuous fame unstained  
  With lapse of time still brighter grow!  
From jealousies and envies free,  
  May they advance the good to place!  
And blessings, boundless in degree,  
  Their rule through all our regions grace!

4 When so those sons of Heaven shall sway,  
  Nor greater cares their care withdraw  
From smallest things, friends shall obey,  
  And find repose beneath their law.  
  Love shall around them cast its chain,  
Kings who not idly fill their seat.  
  The people restful peace shall gain,  
And each king with their praises greet.

</div>
