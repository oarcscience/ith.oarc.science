*The Book of Poetry*, tr. by James Legge, \[1876\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

#### XI

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Chao Min;* narrative, all but Stanza 6, which is metaphorical. The
writer bemoans the misery and ruin which were going on, and shows how
they were owing to the king's employment of mean and worthless
characters.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>O pitying Heaven,
why see we thee  
  In terrors thus arrayed?  
Famine has come. The people flee,  
  And homeless roam, dismayed.  
In settled spots, and far and near,  
  Our regions all lie waste and drear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>See o’er the land
Heaven's net of crime!  
  And lo! in place appear  
Men idle, knowing not the time,  
  Locusts looked at with fear,  
Oppressive, perverse, fond of strife!—  
  Can such as these bring peace and life?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Slanderers and
insolent, the king  
  Yet sees in them no ill.  
Us to dread peril's brink they bring;  
  Our minds with care they fill. <span id="page_431">p. 431</span>  
Not for a moment dare we rest,  
  Degraded oft, and sore opprest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>As when the dry
parched grass we see  
  Wither for want of rain;  
As water plants graft on a tree  
  Cannot their life retain;  
So all things now to ruin haste.  
  Who can their fatal course arrest?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>’Twas merit once
that riches gained;  
  The case how different now!  
Troubles through all our time have reigned,  
  And greater still they grow.  
Like grain unhulled those men in place!  
Like fine rice these who find no grace!  
Ye villains, of yourselves retire!  
Why thus prolong my grief and ire?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>Now empty stands
and dry the pool;—  
  No streams into it flow.  
The spring is idle, once so full;—  
  Unfed now from below!  
So for those evils all around  
Sufficient causes could be found; <span id="page_432">p. 432</span>  
But they increase my anxious care,  
Lest I be caught in evil snare.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7">7</span></span>When our first
kings the throne received,  
  Such ministers they had  
As Chao's great chief, whom all believed.  
  In one day he would add  
A thousand li, from states which came  
Our king's protecting care to claim.  
Now in one day that space is lost!  
Can none the ancient virtue boast?
