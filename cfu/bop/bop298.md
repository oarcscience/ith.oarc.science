#### IV

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Hsiao Pi;* narrative. King Chêng acknowledges that he had erred,
and states his purpose to be careful in the future; he will guard
against the slight beginnings of evil, and is penetrated with a sense of
his own incompetences.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

When of the past I think, myself I blame;  
I'll guard in future ’gainst what caused me shame  
I'll shun the wasp, nor do the foolish thing  
By which I seemed to invite its painful sting.  
It looked a wren, that I could hold unharmed;  
It grew to a fierce bird, with talons armed!  
Uneasy is my head which wears the crown,  
And bitter trials press me sorely down.

</div>
