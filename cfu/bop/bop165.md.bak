of loyal duty and filial feeling.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>On dashed my four
steeds, without halt, without stay,  
Though toilsome and winding from Chou was the way.  
I wished to return,—but the monarch's command  
Forbade that his business be done with slack hand;  
And my heart was with sadness oppressed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>On dashed my four
steeds; I ne’er slackened the reins.  
They snorted and panted,—all white, with black manes.  
I wished to return, but our sovereign's command  
Forbade that his business be done with slack hand;  
And I dared not to pause or to rest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Unresting the
filial doves speed in their flight,  
Ascending, then sweeping swift down from the height,  
Now grouped on the oaks. The king's high command  
Forbade that his business be done with slack hand;  
And my father I left, sore distressed. <span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Unresting the
filial doves speed in their flight,  
Now fanning the air, and anon they alight  
On the medlars thick grouped. But our monarch's command  
Forbade that his business be done with slack hand;—  
Of my mother I thought with sad breast.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>My four steeds I
harnessed, all white and black-maned,  
Which straight on their way, fleet and emulous, strained.  
I wished to return; and now venture in song  
The wish to express, and announce how I long  
For my mother my care to attest.
