The *Chün Tzŭ Chieh Lao;* narrative. Contrast between the beauty and
splendor of Hsüan Chiang and her viciousness.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Pledged to her
husband, his alone to be;  
  With headdress high, cross pins, and jewels rare;  
Her movements graceful, elegant, and free;  
  As mountain stately, with imposing air;  
  Majestic as a river, large and fair;  
Her robes the various figured forms display.  
  Fit seems it she such pictured robes should wear!  
But, lady, vain is all your grand array;  
No claim to it can you, in virtue wanting, lay.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Her
pheasant-figured robe resplendent shines,  
  Her hair, jet-black, cloudlike surmounts her head;  
Her own, no false locks with it she entwines.  
  Then see her ear plugs, of the precious jade;  
  Her comb pin, of the finest ivory made;  
And her high forehead, shining pure and white. <span id="page_51">p.
51</span>  
  Like visitant come down from heaven, arrayed  
In fashion thus, for sacrificial rite,—  
Well may we goddess call her, and no earthly wight.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>At court now see
her, on occasions great,  
  To meet the ruler, or guests entertain!  
As rich and splendid is her robe of state,  
  With muslin ’neath it of the finest grain,  
  Which takes the place of warmer garment plain.  
Her eyes are clear, with forehead broad and high,  
  Which the full temples on each side sustain.  
With woman such as this how few can vie!  
The beauty of the land, she charms the gazing eye!
