The *T‘ung Kung;* narrative. A festal ode, on occasion of a feast given
by the king to some prince for the merit he had achieved, and the

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>The red bows
unbent were received, and are kept  
  In store,—to reward service done for our land.  
Lo! here is a prince whose great merit we own;  
  To him one I give from my heart with glad hand.  
The bells and the drums all in order are placed;—  
I'll feast the whole morning with this noble guest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The red bows
unbent were received, and are fixed  
  On frames,—to await service done for our states.  
Lo! here is a prince who well merits the prize;  
  With joy my whole heart in his presence dilates.  
The bells and the drums in good order all stand;—  
And this morning his place shall be on my right hand. <span

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>The red bows
unbent were received, and are placed  
  In cases,—to show how we merit revere.  
Lo! here is a prince such reward who deserves;  
  For him in my heart's core the love is sincere.  
With our bells and our drums the court shall resound,  
While for him all the morning the pledge cup goes round.

</div>
