<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>His lady to the
marquis says,  
  "The cock has crowed; ‘tis late.  
Get up, my lord, and haste to court.  
  ’Tis full; for you they wait."  
She did not hear the cock's shrill sound,  
Only the blue flies buzzing round.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Again she wakes
him with the words,  
  "The east, my lord, is bright.  
A crowded court your presence seeks;  
  Get up, and hail the light."  
’Twas not the dawning light which shone,  
But that which by the moon was thrown.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>He sleeping still,
once more she says,  
  "The flies are buzzing loud.  
To lie and dream here by your side  
  Were pleasant, but the crowd  
Of officers will soon retire;  
Draw not on you and me their ire!"
