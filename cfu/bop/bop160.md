<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *P‘o Fu;* narrative. Responsive to the last ode. His soldiers praise
the duke of Chou for his magnanimity and sympathy with the people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>  We splintered
our axes, and brought  
  Our hatchets all to the same plight.  
But the duke of Chou meant, when eastward he went,  
  What was wrong in those, four 'states to right.  
    Oh! the pity was great  
    Which he felt for their state!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>  Our axes and
chisels we broke  
  To pieces, and splintered and rent.  
But the duke of Chou meant, when eastward he went,  
  The four states all reformed to present.  
    Oh! the pity was good  
    That on them he bestowed!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>  Our axes we
broke, and our clubs  
  To fragments were splintered and split. <span id="page_179">p.
179</span>  
But the duke of Chou meant, when eastward he went,  
  The four states in close union to knit.  
    Oh! the pity was rare  
    That he showed for them there!
