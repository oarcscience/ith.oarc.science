#### II

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Lü I*, metaphorical and allusive. The complaint, sad but resigned,
of a neglected wife.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>When the upper
robe is green,  
With a yellow lining seen,  
There we have a certain token  
Right is wronged and order broken.  
How can sorrow from my heart  
In a case like this depart?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Color green the
robe displays;  
Lower garment yellow's blaze.  
Thus it is that favorite mean  
In the place of wife is seen.  
Vain the conflict with my grief;  
Memory denies relief.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Yes, ’twas you the
green who dyed,  
You who fed the favorite's pride.  
Anger rises in my heart,  
Pierces it as with a dart.  
But on ancient rules lean I,  
Lest to wrong my thoughts should fly. <span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Fine or coarse, if
thin the dress,  
Cold winds always cause distress.  
Hard my lot, my sorrow deep,  
But my thoughts in check I keep.  
Ancient story brings to mind  
Sufferers who were resigned.

</div>
