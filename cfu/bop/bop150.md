#### II

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Su Kuan;* narrative. Some one deplores the decay of filial feeling,
as seen in the neglect of the mourning habit.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>O that I saw the
mourning robe of white,  
  Assumed when two years from the death are o’er,  
And earnest mourner's form, to leanness worn!  
  Not seeing this, my heart with grief is sore.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>O that I saw the
lower robe to match  
  This cap of white! I'd with the wearer go,  
And live with him, my heart eased of its smart,—  
  Its sadness gone, such mourner true to know. <span id="page_161">p.
161</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>O that I saw the
white knee covers worn,  
  Suiting the cap and skirt! I should feel bound  
To him whose lasting grief so sought relief.  
  The sympathy would heal my heart's deep wound.

</div>
