<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Fu T‘ien;* narrative. Pictures of husbandry and sacrifices
connected with it. Happy understanding between the people and their
superiors.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Bright shine my
widespread fields before the eye,  
That yearly to the king a tithe supply.  
From olden times the crops have plenteous been;  
Each year has left to feed my husbandmen  
Sufficient store. Now to the ground I go,  
Where their rich soil the southern acres show.  
Some weed; some gather earth around the roots;  
Each millet plant luxuriantly upshoots.  
There I call round me in a spacious place  
The brightest youths, with cheering words to grace.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Heaped in the
vessels, bright the millet shone;  
Pure were the victim rams. Last harvest done,  
We thanked the spirits of the land and air,  
From whom the joyous husbandmen declare  
The copious produce of the year had come.  
Now without lutes and the resounding drum,  
To him who taught men tillage first we cry,  
And ask for rain to help our husbandry. <span id="page_290">p.
290</span>  
So shall our millets grow. Each field now thrives,  
To bless our laborers, and bless their wives.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Our lord of long
descent now comes this way,  
Just as their wives and children food convey  
To those who on the southern acres toil.  
The inspector of the fields appears meanwhile  
Glad he looks on, and of the simple food  
The dishes tastes, to see if it be good.  
The hand of skill appears in every field;  
’Tis sure erelong luxuriant crop to yield.  
Our lord complacent looks, and in his view  
The toilers feel their zeal inspired anew.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>The reapers soon
the crops will take in hand,  
Which curving down, and thick as thatch, shall stand.  
Lo! numerous stacks are built all o’er the grounds,  
Rising like islands, seen from far like mounds.  
Thousands of granaries must our lord prepare,  
And carts in myriads home their loads shall bear.  
With radiant joy each husbandman surveys  
The millets stored, the rice crop and the maize.  
Then all shall pray for blessing on our lord,  
For myriad years.—Such shall be his reward!
