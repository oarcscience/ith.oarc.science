#### VIII

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ts’ai Shu;* allusive and narrative. Responsive to the
former;—celebrating the appearance of the feudal princes at the court,
the splendor of their array, the propriety of their demeanor, and the
favor conferred on them by the king.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>They pull the
beans all o’er the ground,  
To place in baskets square, and round. <span id="page_309">p.
309</span>  
So reap they what the fields produce,  
For present and for future use.  
When now themselves the princes show  
No stores have I gifts to bestow,  
      Befitting their great worth.  
Yet a state carriage and its team  
Will well a feudal prince beseem;—  
      Let such be all brought forth.  
And from the chambers let them bring  
      The robes that princes wear.  
From duke to baron, I, the king,  
      On them will these confer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The water bubbles
from the spring,  
      And round it grows the cress.  
So when the princes see the king,  
      Their coming they express  
In various ways. Now here I see  
Their flags, with dragon blazonry,  
      All waving in the wind.  
The gentle tinkling of their bells  
Comes to my ear, and surely tells  
They in their chariots, grandly drawn  
By the four steeds of mighty brawn,  
      Cannot be far behind. <span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>The king soon gets
a nearer view.  
      The covers red he sees  
Upon their knees, of brilliant hue,  
      And buskins ’neath the knees.  
A grave demeanor all display;  
      The Son of Heaven approves.  
What to such princes can he say,  
      Whose presence rapture moves?  
In admiration and delight,  
      No grace can he withhold.  
To some he grants new honors bright,  
      To some confirms the old.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>The oaks their
branches wide extend,  
      With leaves thick covered o’er,  
Which thus the roots and trunk defend,  
      And make them thrive the more.  
So do these princes service do,  
Throughout the land, while they pursue  
      The charges to them given.  
The various regions well they guard, <span id="page_311">p. 311</span>  
Nor think they any labor hard,  
      To aid the Son of Heaven.  
All blessings on their heads collect.  
      And now to court they've brought  
Their ministers who nought neglect,  
      Strong both in act and thought.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>The boat is by the
rope held fast,  
      Lest it should float away;  
So round the princes there is cast  
      The king's protective stay.  
He looks on them with joy intense;  
He scans their merits to dispense  
      His favors and rewards.  
He makes their happiness his charge;  
Their territories to enlarge,  
      As duty he regards.  
To them it is a pleasure rare,  
      A happy, joyous time,  
When from their states they here repair,  
      To see his court sublime.
