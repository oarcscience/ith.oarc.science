#### XI

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *I Chieh;* narrative. Lament over Duke Chuang of Lu, notwithstanding
his beauty of person, elegance of manners, and skill in archery.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>A grand man is the
prince of Lu,  
  With person large and high.  
Lofty his front, and suited to  
  The fine glance of his eye! <span id="page_115">p. 115</span>  
Swift are his feet. In archery  
  What man with him can vie?  
With all these goodly qualities,  
  We see him and we sigh!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Renowned through
all the land is he,  
  The nephew of our lord.  
With clear and lovely eyes, his grace  
  May not be told by word.  
All day at target practice,  
  He'll never miss the bird.  
Such is the prince of Lu, and yet  
  With grief for him we're stirred!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>All grace and
beauty he displays,  
  High forehead, and eyes bright.  
And dancing choice! His arrows all  
  The target hit aright.  
Straight through they go, and every one  
  Lights on the selfsame spot.  
Rebellion he could well withstand,  
  And yet we mourn his lot!

</div>
