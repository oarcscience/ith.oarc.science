#### VI

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ti Tu;* allusive. Lament of an individual bereaved of his brothers
and relatives, or forsaken by them.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>A russet pear tree
rises all alone,  
But rich the growth of leaves upon it shown?  
I walk alone, without one brother left,  
And thus of natural aid am I bereft.  
Plenty of people there are all around,  
But none like my own father's sons are found.  
Ye travelers, who forever hurry by,  
Why on me turn the unsympathizing eye?  
No brother lives with whom my cause to plead;—  
Why not perform for me the helping deed?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>A russet pear tree
rises all alone,  
But rich with verdant foliage o’ergrown.  
I walk alone, without one brother's care,  
To whom I might, amid my straits, repair.  
Plenty of people there are all around,  
But none like those of my own name are found.  
Ye travelers, who forever hurry by,  
Why on me turn the unsympathizing eye?  
No brother lives with whom my cause to plead;—  
Why not perform for me the helping deed?

</div>
