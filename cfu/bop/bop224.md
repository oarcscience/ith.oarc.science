### <span class="smallcaps">Book VII. Decade of Sang Hu</span>

#### I

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Sang Hu;* allusive and narrative. The king, entertaining the chief
among the feudal princes, expresses his admiration of them, and good
wishes for them.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Flitting round the
greenbeaks see,  
With their wings of brilliancy!  
Birds they are that men admire;  
More those lords my soul inspire  
With admiring joy and love.  
Heaven will bless them from above!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Here and there the
greenbeaks light,  
Showing necks with feathers bright. <span id="page_296">p. 296</span>  
Who but must the creatures prize?  
But it more delights my eyes,  
When these noble lords are seen,  
Who my states from danger screen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Screens they are,
and bulwarks strong;  
All the chiefs around them throng,  
And on them as patterns gaze.  
Self-restraint each hero lays  
On himself,—from folly free;—  
Great their happiness must be!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>See the mighty cup
of horn,  
Round their ranks in order borne!  
Full of spirits soft and good,  
It excites no conduct rude.  
Surely blessings haste to greet  
Lords of virtue so complete!

</div>
