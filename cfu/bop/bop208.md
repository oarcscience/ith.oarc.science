Textual Heritage

#### V

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ho Jên Ssŭ;* narrative. Some noble suffering from slander, and
suspecting that the slanderer was an old friend, intimates the grounds
of his suspicion, and laments his case, while he would welcome the
restoration of their former relations.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>      I ask what
man came here.  
With treacherous schemes his mind o’erflows.  
Why to my dam came he so close,  
      Nor to the gate drew near?  
Whom does he follow as his lord?  
It must be Pao, I'll pledge my word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>      Companions
close are they.  
Which was it caused me my disgrace?  
Why shunned he at the dam my face,  
      Nor kindly word would say? <span id="page_261">p. 261</span>  
Once were we bound with friendship's ties,  
While now to stand aloof he tries.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>      I ask what
man is he.  
Inside my gate, before my hall,  
He stood. I heard his footsteps’s fall,  
      Though him I could not see.  
Unblushingly he breaks man's law,  
Nor yet of Heaven stands he in awe.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>      What man
behaved so ill?  
Wild as a hurricane his ways!  
Or north, or south, he comes as sways  
      The impulse of his will.  
Why to my dam approached he so,  
My mind is such distress to throw?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>      "Too slow!"
is your appeal.  
"Too slow,"—and yet you could not stop  
"In haste," you say.—I saw you drop  
      The reins, and grease your wheel. <span id="page_262">p.
262</span>  
If you would come to me but once!  
Why keep me waiting, eyes askance?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>      Then upon
your return  
You came not. If you had done so,  
My strong desire would no more glow;  
      My heart would cease to burn.  
O come but once! Vain your excuse!  
Why to relieve me thus refuse?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7">7</span></span>      Beads on one
string we bung.  
If you the earthen whistle blew,  
I played the flute of pierced bamboo.  
      If still you doubt my tongue,  
Here are the creatures three, whose blood  
Shall seal the oath I take as good!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8">8</span></span>      Were you an
imp of air,  
Or water, you'd be out of reach.  
But face to face we stand, and each  
      Is to the other bare.  
In this good song I've freely told  
Your changeful ways, now hot, now cold.
