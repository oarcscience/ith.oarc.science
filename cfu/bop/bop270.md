<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Han Yi*; narrative. Celebrating the marquis of Han:—his investitute
and the king's charge to him; the gifts he received, and the parting
feast; his marriage; the excellence of his territory; and his sway over
the regions of the north.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Grand is the
guardian hill of Han!  
There the Great Yü his work began,  
  The land from wreck to save.  
Thence to the capital there leads  
A noble road. See there the steeds  
That draw Han's lord, as he proceeds  
  Investitute to crave. <span id="page_416">p. 416</span>  
Called now his father's seat to fill,  
He goes to hear the royal will.  
  To him the king thus said:  
"As served your fathers, so serve you.  
Be careful my commands to do.  
Early and late show active zeal;  
With reverence seek the kingdom's weal.  
  And thus your fealty paid  
Shall strengthen the great fief I give;—  
Marquis of Han you long shall live.  
What princes come not to my court  
Deal with, until they here resort,  
  And thus your sovereign aid."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Oh! noble was the
marquis’ team.  
Both long and large, the steeds beseem  
  His youthful state and port.  
His mace of rank he with him brought,  
When audience of the king he sought,  
  And bowed within his court.  
The king his royal favor showed.  
And on him princely gifts bestowed. <span id="page_417">p. 417</span>  
Those were—the dragon flag, whence streamed  
Its pennon that with plumelets gleamed;  
The brilliant yoke; the bamboo screen;  
The robe with dragon on it seen;  
Red slippers; and the hooks to shine  
On his steeds’ breasts; the frontlets fine,  
Whose carvings should their foreheads grace;  
The board across his car to place;  
The tiger's skin, to throw around  
That leaning board with leather bound.  
Then last there came the rein ends bright,  
Tipt with gilt rings,—a splendid sight.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>The court now
leaving, home he hies;  
But first he offers sacrifice,  
And prays the spirit of the way  
Guidance to give. That night to stay  
At Too he planned. The parting feast  
Hsien-fu there gives to speed the guest.  
The court sends forth its many lords,  
To taste the cheer the king affords.  
An hundred vases stand around,  
All with the choicest spirits crowned.  
The mats roast turtle and fresh fish  
Present, and many a lordly dish. <span id="page_418">p. 418</span>  
And bamboo sprouts, and tender shoots,  
And sauces fine, and fragrant fruits,  
With their rich perfume fill the air.  
Oh! but it was a banquet rare!  
It closed, and lo! before the gate,  
With mighty steeds, a car of state!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Now back in Han,
its lord must wed,  
  And home a wife shall bring.  
To Chüeh-fu's child his suit he paid,  
  The niece of Fên, our king.  
The union fixed, in grand array,  
To Chüeh-fu's house he takes his way;  
  An hundred cars attend.  
The tinkling music falls and swells,  
Emitted by their numerous bells,  
As on their course they wend.  
The glory of that day was great.  
Lo! round the bride in fairest state,  
The virgins, her companions, stand,  
Close following her on either hand.  
As lovely clouds that slowly sail,  
And the moon's greater glory veil, <span id="page_419">p. 419</span>  
  So beautiful were they.  
The marquis looked, with rapture thrilled.  
Never was gate with splendor filled,  
  As Chüeh-fu's gate that day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>Great fame
Chüeh-fu bas got in war,  
And every state has seen his car;  
But through the land, where’er he went,  
To settle his dear child intent,  
  No state like Han he saw.  
Oh! pleasant is the state of Han!  
Chüeh saw the mighty streams that ran  
Through all its length, and then the lakes,  
With forests girt and tangled brakes,  
  That admiration draw.  
Big bream and tench the waters fill,  
And in the glades on every hill  
  Are multitudes of deer.  
In wilder parts the grisly bear,  
Tigers and wild eats, make their lair.  
  Hunters their prey find here.  
Chüeh saw, and pleasure filled his breast,  
And here his child found joy and rest. <span id="page_420">p. 420</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>The multitudes of
Yen had reared  
  Han's walls, and made them strong.  
Its rulers then no foeman feared;  
There had they dwelt for long.  
The first of them a charge had got,  
From Han, as from a central spot,  
  To rule the tribes around.  
The marquis now got wider charge,  
His jurisdiction to enlarge  
  O’er all the northern ground.  
The Chuy and Mih to curb and awe,  
And bring to own Chou's sovereign law,  
  Would his first care require.  
Then stronger walls and deeper moat  
Would silence each rebellious note,  
  And all with fear inspire.  
The fields too he must now define,  
And the fixed revenue assign,  
  As in the king's domain.  
His bearers shall to court repair,  
With skins stript from the tawny bear,  
The white fox and the panther red,  
In yearly course a tribute paid,  
  The king's trust to maintain.
