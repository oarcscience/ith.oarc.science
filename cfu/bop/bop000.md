Scanned, proofed and formatted by John Bruno Hare at Intangible Textual
Heritage, August 2008. This text is in the public domain in the US
because it was originally published prior to 1923. The Shanghai edition
contains all of the poetry verbatim from the 1876 edition, which has
much additional apparatus not included here. The Chinese text is also
omitted in this etext for technical reasons.
