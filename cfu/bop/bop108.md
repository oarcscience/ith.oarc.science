<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Tsai Ch‘ü;* narrative. The open shamelessness of Wan Chiang in her
meeting with her brother.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>  On comes her
chariot, fast and loud,  
    With screen of bamboos finely wove,  
  And leather bright, vermilion-hued—  
    Ch‘i’s daughter hastes to lawless love.  
To this from Lu the road is smooth and plain;—  
’Twas but last night she started with her train.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>  Her four black
steeds are beautiful;  
    Soft are the reins the driver holds. <span id="page_114">p.

  The road from Lu is smooth and plain;—  
    Ch‘i’s daughter's heart its joy unfolds.  
Full of complacency is she; nor shame  
Abashes her, nor fear of evil name.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>  Broad flow the
waters of the Wên,  
    And crowds of travelers go by.  
  The road from Lu is smooth and plain;—  
    She looks around with careless eye.  
That many see her gives her no concern;  
Her thoughts to her licentious fancy turn.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>  On sweep the
waters of the Wên;  
    More numerous are the travelers now.  
  The road from Lu is smooth and plain;—  
    Ch‘i’s daughter shows her brazen brow.  
At ease and proud, she holds her onward way,  
Careless of what all think of her display.
