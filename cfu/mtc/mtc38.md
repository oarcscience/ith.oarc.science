### \[37\] INVITATION TO HSIAO CHÜ-SHIH <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_24)

#### *(Written when Governor of Chung-Chou)*

<span class="smallcaps">Within</span> the Gorges there is no lack of
men;  
They are people one meets, not people one cares for.  
At my front door guests also arrive;  
They are people one sits with, not people one knows.  
When I look up, there are only clouds and trees;  
When I look down—only my wife and child.  
I sleep, eat, get up or sit still;  
Apart from that, nothing happens at all.  
But beyond the city Hsiao the hermit dwells;  
And with *him* at least I find myself at ease.  
For *he* can drink a full flagon of wine  
And is good at reciting long-line poems.  
Some afternoon, when the clerks have all gone home,  
At a season when the path by the river bank is dry,  
I beg you, take up your staff of bamboo-wood  
And find your way to the parlour of the Government House.
