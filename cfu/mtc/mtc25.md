### \[24\] ILLNESS AND IDLENESS

#### (*Circa* A.D. *812*)

<span class="smallcaps">Illness</span> and idleness give me much
leisure.  
What do I do with my leisure, when it comes?  
I cannot bring myself to discard inkstone and brush;  
Now and then I make a new poem.  
When the poem is made, it is slight and flavourless,  
A thing of derision to almost every one.  
Superior people will be pained at the flatness of the metre;  
Common people will hate the plainness of the words.  
I sing it to myself, then stop and think about it…

The Prefects of Soochow and P’ēng-tsē <span

Would perhaps have praised it, but they died long ago.  
Who else would care to hear it?  
No one to-day except Yüan Chēn,  
And *he* is banished to the City of Chiang-ling,  
For three years an usher in the Penal Court.  
Parted from me by three thousand leagues  
He will never know even that the poem was made.
