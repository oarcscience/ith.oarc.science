### \[23\] LAZY MAN'S SONG

#### (A.D. *811*)

<span class="smallcaps">I have</span> got patronage, but am too lazy to
use it;  
I have got land, but am too lazy to farm it.  
My house leaks; I am too lazy to mend it.  
My clothes are torn; I am too lazy to darn them.  
I have got wine, but am too lazy to drink;  
So it's just the same as if my cellar were empty.  
I have got a harp, but am too lazy to play;  
So it's just the same as if it had no strings.  
My wife tells me there is no more bread in the house;  
I want to bake, but am too lazy to grind.  
My friends and relatives write me long letters;  
I should like to read them, but they're such a bother to open.  
I have always been told that Chi Shu-yeh <span
id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_10.md)  
Passed his whole life in absolute idleness.  
But he played the harp and sometimes transmuted metals,  
So even *he* was not so lazy as I.
