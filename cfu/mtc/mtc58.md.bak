### \[57\] TO LIU YU-HSI

#### (A.D. *838*)

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> length of days and soundness of limb
you and I are one;  
Our eyes are not wholly blind, nor our ears quite deaf.  
Deep drinking we lie together, fellows of a spring day;  
Or gay-hearted boldly break into gatherings of young men.  
When, seeking flowers, we borrowed his horse, the river-keeper was
vexed;  
When, to play on the water, we stole his boat, the Duke Ling was sore.  
I hear it said that in Lo-yang, people are all shocked,  
And call us by the name of "Liu and Po, those two mad old men."
