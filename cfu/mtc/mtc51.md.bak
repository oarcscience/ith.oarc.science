### \[50\] THE GRAND HOUSES AT LO-YANG

#### (*Circa* A.D. *829*)

<span class="smallcaps">By</span> woods and water, whose houses are
these  
With high gates and wide-stretching lands?  
From their blue gables gilded fishes hang;  
By their red pillars carven coursers run.  
Their spring arbours, warm with caged mist;  
Their autumn yards with locked moonlight cold.  
To the stem of the pine-tree amber beads cling;  
The bamboo-branches ooze ruby-drops.  
Of lake and terrace who may the masters be?  
Staff-officers, Councillors-of-State.  
All their lives they have never come to see,  
But know their houses only from the bailiff's map !
