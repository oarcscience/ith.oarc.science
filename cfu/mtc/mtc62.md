### \[61\] ILLNESS

#### *(Written circa 842, when he was paralyzed)*

<span class="smallcaps">Dear</span> friends, there is no cause for so
much sympathy.  
I shall certainly manage from time to time to take my walks abroad.  
All that matters is an active mind, what is the use of feet?  
By land one can ride in a carrying-chair; by water, be rowed in a boat.
