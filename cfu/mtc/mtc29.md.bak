### \[28\] TO HIS BROTHER HSING-CHIEN, WHO WAS SERVING IN TUNG-CH‘UAN

#### (A.D. *815*)

<span class="smallcaps">Sullen</span>, sullen, my brows are ever knit;  
Silent, silent, my lips will not move.  
It is not indeed that I choose to sorrow thus;  
If I lift my eyes, who would share my joy?  
Last Spring *you* were called to the West  
To carry arms in the lands of Pa and Shu;  
And this Spring *I* was banished to the South  
To nurse my sickness on the River's oozy banks.  
You are parted from me by six thousand leagues;  
In another world, under another sky.  
Of ten letters, nine do not reach;  
What can I do to open my sad face?  
Thirsty men often dream of drink;  
Hungry men often dream of food.  
Since Spring came, where do my dreams lodge?  
Ere my eyes are closed, I have travelled to Tung-ch‘uan.
