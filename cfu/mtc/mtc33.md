### \[32\] VISITING THE HSI-LIN TEMPLE

#### *(Written during his exile)*

<span class="smallcaps">I dismount</span> from my horse at the Hsi-lin
Temple;  
I throw the porter my slender riding-whip.  
In the morning I work at a Government office-desk;  
In the evening I become a dweller in the Sacred Hills.  
In the second month to the north of Kuang-lu  
The ice breaks and the snow begins to melt.  
On the southern plantation the tea-plant thrusts its sprouts;  
Through the northern sluice the veins of the spring ooze.

This year there is war in An-hui,  
In every place soldiers are rushing to arms.  
Men of learning have been summoned to the Council Board;  
Men of action are marching to the battle-line.  
Only I, who have no talents at all,  
Am left in the mountains to play with the pebbles of the stream.
