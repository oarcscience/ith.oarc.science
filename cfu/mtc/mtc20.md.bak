### \[19\] AT THE END OF SPRING

#### *To Yüan Chēn.* <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_7) (A.D. *810*.md)

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> flower of the pear-tree gathers and
turns to fruit;  
The swallows' eggs have hatched into young birds.  
When the Seasons' changes thus confront the mind  
What comfort can the Doctrine of Tao give?  
It will teach me to watch the days and months fly  
Without grieving that Youth slips away;  
If the Fleeting World is but a long dream,  
It does not matter whether one is young or old.  
But ever since the day that my friend left my side  
And has lived an exile in the City of Chiang-ling,  
There is one wish I cannot quite destroy:  
That from time to time we may chance to meet again.
