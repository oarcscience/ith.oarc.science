### \[51\] THE CRANES

#### (A.D. *830*)

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> western wind has blown but a few
days;  
Yet the first leaf already flies from the bough.  
On the drying paths I walk in my thin shoes;  
In the first cold I have donned my quilted coat.  
Through shallow ditches the floods are clearing away;  
Through sparse bamboos trickles a slanting light.  
In the early dusk, down an alley of green moss,  
The garden-boy is leading the cranes home.
