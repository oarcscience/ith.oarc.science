<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Worldly</span> matters again draw my steps;<br> Worldly things again seduce my heart.<br> Whenever for long I part from Li Chien<br> Gradually my thoughts grow narrow and covetous.<br> I remember how once I used to visit you;<br> I stopped my horse and tapped at the garden-gate.<br> Often when I came you were still lying in bed;<br> Your little children were sent to let me in.<br> And you, laughing, ran to the front-door<br> With coat-tails flying and cap all awry.<br> On the swept terrace, green patterns of moss;<br> On the dusted bench, clean shadows of leaves.<br> To gaze at the hills we sat in the eastern lodge;<br> To wait for the moon we walked to the southern moor.<br> At your quiet gate only birds spoke;<br> In your distant street few drums were heard.<br> Opposite each other all day we talked,<br> And never once spoke of profit or fame.<br> Since we parted hands, how long has passed?<br> Thrice and again the full moon has shone.<br> For when we parted the last flowers were falling,<br> And to-day I hear new cicadas sing.<br> The scented year suddenly draws to its close,<br> Yet the sorrow of parting is still unsubdued.</p>
