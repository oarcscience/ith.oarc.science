### \[42\] TO HIS BROTHER HSING-CHIEN

#### (A.D. *820*)

    <span class="smallcaps">Can</span> the single cup of wine  
We drank this morning have made my heart so glad?  
This is a joy that comes only from within,  
Which those who witness will never understand.  
    I have but two brothers  
And bitterly grieved that both were far away;  
This Spring, back through the Gorges of Pa,  
I have come to them safely, ten thousand leagues.  
    Two sisters I had  
Who had put up their hair, but not twined the sash; <span
id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_26)  
Yesterday both were married and taken away  
By good husbands in whom I may well trust.  
I am freed at last from the thoughts that made me grieve,  
As though a sword had cut a rope from my neck.  
And limbs grow light when the heart sheds its care:  
Suddenly I seem to be flying up to the sky!

Hsing-chien, drink your cup of wine  
Then set it down and listen to what I say.  
Do not sigh that your home is far away;  
Do not mind if your salary is small.  
Only pray that as long as life lasts,  
You and I may never be forced to part.
