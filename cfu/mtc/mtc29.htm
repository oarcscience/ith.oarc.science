<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sullen</span>, sullen, my brows are ever knit;<br> Silent, silent, my lips will not move.<br> It is not indeed that I choose to sorrow thus;<br> If I lift my eyes, who would share my joy?<br> Last Spring <i>you</i> were called to the West<br> To carry arms in the lands of Pa and Shu;<br> And this Spring <i>I</i> was banished to the South<br> To nurse my sickness on the River's oozy banks.<br> You are parted from me by six thousand leagues;<br> In another world, under another sky.<br> Of ten letters, nine do not reach;<br> What can I do to open my sad face?<br> Thirsty men often dream of drink;<br> Hungry men often dream of food.<br> Since Spring came, where do my dreams lodge?<br> Ere my eyes are closed, I have travelled to Tung-ch&#8216;uan.</p>
