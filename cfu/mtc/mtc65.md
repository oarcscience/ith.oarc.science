### \[64\] THE PITCHER

#### (A.D. *779-831*)

<span class="smallcaps">I dreamt</span> I climbed to a high, high
plain;  
And on the plain I found a deep well.  
My throat was dry with climbing and I longed to drink;  
And my eyes were eager to look into the cool shaft.  
I walked round it; I looked right down;  
I saw my image mirrored on the face of the pool.  
An earthen pitcher was sinking into the black depths;  
There was no rope to pull it to the well-head.  
I was strangely troubled lest the pitcher should be lost,  
And started wildly running to look for help.  
From village to village I scoured that high plain;  
The men were gone: the dogs leapt at my throat.  
I came back and walked weeping round the well;  
Faster and faster the blinding tears flowed—  
Till my own sobbing suddenly woke me up;  
My room was silent; no one in the house stirred;  
The flame of my candle flickered with a green smoke;  
The tears I had shed glittered in the candle-light.  
A bell sounded; I knew it was the midnight-chime;  
I sat up in bed and tried to arrange my thoughts:  
The plain in my dream was the graveyard at Ch‘ang-an,  
Those hundred acres of untilled land.  
The soil heavy and the mounds heaped high;  
And the dead below them laid in deep troughs.  
Deep are the troughs, yet sometimes dead men

Find their way to the world above the grave.  
And to-night my love who died long ago  
Came into my dream as the pitcher sunk in the well.  
That was why the tears suddenly streamed from my eyes,  
Streamed from my eyes and fell on the collar of my dress.
