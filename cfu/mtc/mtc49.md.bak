### \[48\] GETTING UP EARLY ON A SPRING MORNING

#### *(Part of a poem written when Governor of Soochow in 825)*

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> early light of the rising sun shines
on the beams of my house;  
The first banging of opened doors echoes like the roll of a drum.  
The dog lies curled on the stone step, for the earth is wet with dew;  
The birds come near to the window and chatter, telling that the day is
fine.  
With the lingering fumes of yesterday's wine my head is still heavy;  
With new doffing of winter clothes my body has grown light.
