### \[45\] PARTING FROM THE WINTER STOVE

#### (A.D. *822*)

<span class="smallcaps">On</span> the fifth day after the rise of
Spring,  
Everywhere the season's gracious altitudes!  
The white sun gradually lengthening its course,  
The blue-grey clouds hanging as though they would fall;  
The last icicle breaking into splinters of jade;  
The new stems marshalling red sprouts.  
The things I meet are all full of gladness;  
It is not only *I* who love the Spring.  
To welcome the flowers I stand in the back garden;  
To enjoy the sunlight I sit under the front eaves.  
Yet still in my heart there lingers one regret;  
Soon I shall part with the flame of my red stove!
