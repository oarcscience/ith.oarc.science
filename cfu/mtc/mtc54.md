### \[53\] THINKING OF THE PAST

#### (A.D. *833*)

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> an idle hour I thought of former
days;  
And former friends seemed to be standing in the room.  
And then I wondered "Where are they now?"  
Like fallen leaves they have tumbled to the Nether Springs.  
Han Yü <span id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_30) swallowed his sulphur
pills,  
Yet a single illness carried him straight to the grave.  
Yüan Chēn smelted autumn stone <span id="fr_33"></span>[2](#fn_31)  
But before he was old, his strength crumbled away.  
Master Tu possessed the "Secret of Health":  
All day long he fasted from meat and spice.  
The Lord Ts‘ui, trusting a strong drug,  
Through the whole winter wore his summer coat.  
Yet some by illness and some by sudden death…  
All vanished ere their middle years were passed.

Only I, who have never dieted myself  
Have thus protracted a tedious span of age,  
    I who in young days  
Yielded lightly to every lust and greed;  
Whose palate craved only for the richest meat  
And knew nothing of bismuth or calomel.  
When hunger came, I gulped steaming food;  
When thirst came, I drank from the frozen stream.

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

With verse I served the spirits of my Five Guts; <span
id="fr_34"></span>[3](#fn_32)  
With wine I watered the three Vital Spots.  
Day by day joining the broken clod  
I have lived till now almost sound and whole.  
There is no gap in my two rows of teeth;  
Limbs and body still serve me well.  
Already I have opened the seventh book of years;  
Yet I eat my fill and sleep quietly;  
I drink, while I may, the wine that lies in my cup,  
And all else commit to Heaven's care.
