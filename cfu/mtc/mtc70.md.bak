### APPENDIX

<span class="smallcaps">An</span> essay on Po Chü-i, whose poems occupy
most of this book, will be found in "170 Chinese Poems." The fullest
account of Li Po's life (with translations) is given in a paper read by
me to the China Society, and published in the *Asiatic Review,* July,
1919. Notices of Ch‘ü Yüan, Wang Wei, Yüan Chēn, Wang Chien and Ou-yang
Hsiu will be found in Giles's "Biographical Dictionary." To Wang Chien,
Po Chü-i addressed several poems.

Of the 68 pieces in this book, 55 are now translated for the first time.
Of the eight poems by Li Po, all but Number 6 have been translated
before, some of them by several hands.

Among the poems by Po Chü-i, three (Nos. 11,12, and 44) have been
translated by Woitsch <span id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_58.md) and one, (No.
43), very incorrectly, by Pfizmaier. Another (No. 21) was translated
into rhymed verse by Prof. Giles in "Adversaria Sinica " (1914) , p.
323. Ou-yang Hsiu's "Autumn" was translated by Giles (with great freedom
in many places) in his "Chinese Literature," p. 215.
