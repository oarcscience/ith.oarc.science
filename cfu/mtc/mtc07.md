### \[7\] WAKING FROM DRUNKENNESS ON A SPRING DAY

"<span class="smallcaps">Life</span> in the World is but a big dream;  
I will not spoil it by any labour or care."  
So saying, I was drunk all the day,  
Lying helpless at the porch in front of my door.  
When I woke up, I blinked at the garden-lawn;  
A lonely bird was singing amid the flowers.  
I asked myself, had the day been wet or fine?  
The Spring wind was telling the mango-bird.  
Moved by its song I soon began to sigh,  
And as wine was there I filled my own cup.  
Wildly singing I waited for the moon to rise;  
When my song was over, all my senses had gone.
