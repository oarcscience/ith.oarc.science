<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">At</span> night I dreamt I was back in Ch&#8216;ang-an;<br> I saw again the faces of old friends.<br> And in my dreams, under an April sky,<br> They led me by the hand to wander in the spring winds.<br> Together we came to the village of Peace and Quiet;<br> We stopped our horses at the gate of Y&uuml;an Ch&#275;n.<br> Y&uuml;an Ch&#275;n was sitting all alone;<br> When he saw me coming, a smile came to his face.<br> He pointed back at the flowers in the western court;<br> Then opened wine in the northern summer-house.<br> He seemed to be saying that neither of us had changed;<br> He seemed to be regretting that joy will not stay;<br> That our souls had met only for a little while,<br> To part again with hardly time for greeting.<br> I woke up and thought him still at my side;<br> I put out my hand; there was nothing there at all.</p>
