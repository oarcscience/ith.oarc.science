### \[21\] CHU CH‘ËN VILLAGE

#### (A.D. *811*)

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> Hsü-chou, in the District of Ku-fēng  
There lies a village whose name is Chu-ch‘ēn—  
A hundred miles away from the county-town,  
Amid fields of hemp and green of mulberry-trees.  
Click, click goes the sound of the spinning-wheel;  
Mules and oxen pack the village-streets.  
The girls go drawing the water from the brook;  
The men go gathering fire-wood on the hill.  
So far from the town Government affairs are few;  
So deep in the hills, man's ways are simple.  
Though they have wealth, they do not traffic with it;  
Though they reach the age, they do not enter the Army.  
Each family keeps to its village trade;  
Grey-headed, they have never left the gates.

Alive, they are the people of Ch‘ēn Village;  
Dead, they become the dust of Ch‘ēn Village.  
Out in the fields old men and young  
Gaze gladly, each in the other's face.  
In the whole village there are only two clans;  
Age after age Chus have married Ch‘ēns.  
Near or distant, they have kinsmen in every house;  
Young or old, they have friends wherever they go.  
On white wine and roasted fowl they fare  
At joyful meetings more than "once a week."

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

While they are alive, they have no distant partings;  
To choose a wife they go to a neighbour's house.  
When they are dead,—no distant burial;  
Round the village graves lie thick.  
They are not troubled either about life or death;  
They have no anguish either of body or soul.  
And so it happens that they live to a ripe age  
And great-great-grandsons are often seen.

*I* was born in the Realms of Etiquette;  
In early years, unprotected and poor.  
Alone, I learnt to distinguish between Evil and Good;  
Untutored, I toiled at bitter tasks.  
The World's Law honours Learning and Fame;  
Scholars prize marriages and Caps.  
With these fetters I gyved my own hands;  
Truly I became a much-deceived man.  
At ten years old I learnt to read books;  
At fifteen, I knew how to write prose.  
At twenty I was made a Bachelor of Arts;  
At thirty I became a Censor at the Court.  
Above, the duty I owe to Prince and parents;  
Below, the ties that bind me to wife and child.  
The support of my family, the service of my country—  
For these tasks my nature is not apt.  
I reckon the time that I first left my home;  
From then till now,—fifteen Springs!

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

My lonely boat has thrice sailed to Ch‘u;  
Four times through Ch‘in my lean horse has passed.  
I have walked in the morning with hunger in my face;  
I have lain at night with a soul that could not rest.  
East and West I have wandered without pause,  
Hither and thither like a cloud astray in the sky.  
In the civil-war my old home was destroyed;  
Of my flesh and blood many are scattered and lost.  
North of the River, and South of the River—  
In both lands are the friends of all my life;  
Life-friends whom I never see at all,  
Whose deaths I hear of only after the lapse of years.  
Sad at morning, I lie on my bed till dusk;  
Weeping at night, I sit and wait for dawn.  
The fire of sorrow has burnt my heart's core;  
The frost of trouble has seized my hair's roots.  
In such anguish has my whole life passed;  
Long I have envied the people of Ch‘ēn Village.
