### \[54\] A MAD POEM ADDRESSED TO MY NEPHEWS AND NIECES

#### (A.D. *835*)

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> World cheats those who cannot read;  
*I,* happily, have mastered script and pen.  
The World cheats those who hold no office;  
*I* am blessed with high official rank.  
    The old are often ill;  
*I,* at this day have not an ache or pain.  
    They are often burdened with ties;  
But *I* have finished with marriage and giving in marriage.  
No changes happen to disturb the quiet of my mind;  
No business comes to impair the vigour of my limbs.  
Hence it is that now for ten years  
Body and soul have rested in hermit peace.  
And all the more, in the last lingering years  
What I shall need are very few things.  
A single rug to warm me through the winter;  
One meal to last me the whole day.  
It does not matter that my house is rather small;  
One cannot sleep in more than one room!  
It does not matter that I have not many horses;  
One cannot ride in two coaches at once!  
As fortunate as me among the people of the world  
Possibly one would find seven out of ten.  
As contented as me among a hundred men  
Look as you may, you will not find one.

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

In the affairs of others even fools are wise;  
In their own business even sages err.  
To no one else would I dare to speak my heart,  
So my wild words are addressed to my nephews and nieces.
