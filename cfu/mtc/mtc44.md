### \[43\] THE PINE-TREES IN THE COURTYARD

#### (A.D. *820*)

    <span class="smallcaps">Below</span> the hall  
The pine-trees grow in front of the steps,  
Irregularly scattered,—not in ordered lines.  
    Some are tall and some are low:  
The tallest of them is six roods high;  
    The lowest but ten feet.  
    They are like wild things  
    And no one knows who planted them.  
They touch the walls of my blue-tiled house;  
Their roots are sunk in the terrace of white sand.  
Morning and evening they are visited by the wind and moon;  
Rain or fine,—they are free from dust and mud.  
In the gales of autumn they whisper a vague tune;  
From the suns of summer they yield a cool shade.  
At the height of spring the fine evening, rain  
Fills their leaves with a load of hanging pearls.  
At the year's end the time of great snow  
Stamps their branches with a fret of glittering jade.  
Of the Four Seasons each has its own mood;  
Among all the trees none is like another.  
Last year, when they heard I had bought this house,  
Neighbours mocked and the World called me mad—  
That a whole family of twice ten souls  
Should move house for the sake of a few pines!  
Now that I have come to them, what have they given me?

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

They have only loosened the buckles of my care.  
Yet even so, they are "profitable friends," <span
id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_27)  
And fill my need of "converse with wise men."  
Yet when I consider how, still a man of the world,  
In belt and cap I scurry through dirt and dust,  
From time to time my heart twinges with shame  
That I am not fit to be master of my pines!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_27"></span>[75:1](mtc44.htm#fr_29) See "Analects of
Confucius" 4 and 5, where three kinds of "profitable friends" and three
kinds of "profitable pleasures" are described; the third of the latter
being "plenty of intelligent companions."
