### \[47\] WRITTEN WHEN GOVERNOR OF SOOCHOW

#### (A.D. *825*)

<span class="smallcaps">A government</span> building, not my own home.  
A Government garden, not my own trees.  
But at Lo-yang I have a small house  
And on Wei River I have built a thatched hut.  
I am free from the ties of marrying and giving in marriage;  
If I choose to retire, I have somewhere to end my days.  
And though I have lingered long beyond my time,  
To retire now would be better than not at all!
