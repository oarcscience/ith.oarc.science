### \[17\] PLANTING BAMBOOS

#### (A.D. *806*)

<span class="smallcaps">Unrewarded</span>, my will to serve the State;  
At my closed door autumn grasses grow.  
What could I do to ease a rustic heart?  
I planted bamboos, more than a hundred shoots.  
When I see their beauty, as they grow by the stream-side,  
I feel again as though I lived in the hills,  
And many a time on public holidays  
Round their railing I walk till night comes.  
Do not say that their roots are still weak,  
Do not say that their shade is still small;  
Already I feel that both in garden and house  
Day by day a fresher air moves.  
But most I love, lying near the window-side,  
To hear in their branches the sound of the autumn-wind.
