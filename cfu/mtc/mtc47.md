### \[46\] GOOD-BYE TO THE PEOPLE OF HANGCHOW

#### (A.D. *824*)

<span class="smallcaps">Elders</span> and officers line the returning
road;  
Wine and soup load the parting table.  
I have not ruled you with the wisdom of Shao Kung; <span
id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_28)  
What is the reason your tears should fall so fast?  
My taxes were heavy, though many of the people were poor;  
The farmers were hungry, for often their fields were dry.  
All I did was to dam the water of the Lake <span
id="fr_31"></span>[2](#fn_29)  
And help a little in a year when things were bad.
