This is not really a sequel to One Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems
\[1916\], Waley's first book. This, his second work, which stands by
itself, includes such famous poets as Ch'u Yüan, Wang Wei, Li Po, Po
Chü-i and others. Arthur Waley, a life-long Londoner, was one of the
leading Chinese scholars of the 20th century. He was close to the
Bloomsbury group, lectured at the School of Oriental and African
Studies, and was known for his numerous translations of such works as
the Tale of Genji, the Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon, and Monkey (Journey
to the West).
