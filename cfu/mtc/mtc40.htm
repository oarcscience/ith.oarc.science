<p>"Through my closed doors I hear nothing but the morning and evening drum;<br> From my upper windows in the distance I see ships that come and go."</p>  
<p>Takamura, thinking these were the Emperor's own verses, said: "If I may venture to criticize an august composition, I would suggest that the phrase "in the distance" be altered." The Emperor was delighted, for he had purposely changed "all I see" to "in the distance I see." At that time there was only one copy of Po Ch&uuml;-i's poems in Japan and the Emperor, to whom it belonged, had allowed no one to see it."&#8212;From the <i>K&#333;dansh&#333;</i> (twelfth century).</P>
