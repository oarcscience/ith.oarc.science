### \[39\] THE SPRING RIVER

#### (A.D. *820*)

<span class="smallcaps">Heat</span> and cold, dusk and dawn have crowded
one upon the other;  
Suddenly I find it is two years since I came to Chung-chou.  
Through my closed doors I hear nothing but the morning and evening
drum;  
From my upper windows all I see is the ships that come and go <span
id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_25.md)  
In vain the orioles tempt me with their song to stray beneath the
flowering trees;  
In vain the grasses lure me by their colour to sit beside the pond.  
There is one thing and one alone I never tire of watching—  
The spring river as it trickles over the stones and babbles past the
rocks.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_25"></span>[70:1](mtc40.htm#fr_27.md) "The Emperor Saga of
Japan (reigned A. D. 810-23) one day quoted to his Minister, Ono no
Takamura, the couplet:

"Through my closed doors I hear nothing but the morning and evening
drum;  
From my upper windows in the distance I see ships that come and go."

Takamura, thinking these were the Emperor's own verses, said: "If I may
venture to criticize an august composition, I would suggest that the
phrase "in the distance" be altered." The Emperor was delighted, for he
had purposely changed "all I see" to "in the distance I see." At that
time there was only one copy of Po Chü-i's poems in Japan and the
Emperor, to whom it belonged, had allowed no one to see it."—From the
*Kōdanshō* (twelfth century).
