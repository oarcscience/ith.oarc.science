### \[30\] RAIN

#### (A.D. *815*)

<span class="smallcaps">Since</span> I lived a stranger in the City of
Hsün-yang  
Hour by hour bitter rain has poured.  
On few days has the dark sky cleared;  
In listless sleep I have spent much time.  
The lake has widened till it almost joins the sky;  
The clouds sink till they touch the water's face.  
Beyond my hedge I hear the boatmen's talk;  
At the street-end I hear the fisher's song.  
Misty birds are lost in yellow air;  
Windy sails kick the white waves.  
In front of my gate the horse and carriage-way  
In a single night has turned into a river-bed.
