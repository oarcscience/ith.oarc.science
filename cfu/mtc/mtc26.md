### \[25\] WINTER NIGHT

#### *(Written during his retirement in 812)*

<span class="smallcaps">My</span> house is poor; those that I love have
left me;  
My body is sick; I cannot join the feast.  
There is not a living soul before my eyes  
As I lie alone locked in my cottage room.  
My broken lamp burns with a feeble flame;  
My tattered curtains are crooked and do not meet.  
"Tsek, tsek" on the door-step and window-sill  
Again I hear the new snow fall.  
As I grow older, gradually I sleep less;  
I wake at midnight and sit up straight in bed.  
If I had not learned the "art of sitting and forgetting," <span
id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_12.md)  
How could I bear this utter loneliness?  
Stiff and stark my body cleaves to the earth;  
Unimpeded my soul yields to Change. <span
id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_13.md)  
So has it been for four hateful years,  
Through one thousand and three hundred nights!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_12"></span>[53:1](mtc26.htm#fr_14.md) Yen Hui told Confucius
that he had acquired the "art of sitting and forgetting." Asked what
that meant, Yen Hui replied, "I have learnt to discard my body and
obliterate my intelligence; to abandon matter and be impervious to
sense-perception. By this method I become one with the
All-Pervading."—*Chuang Tzŭ,* chap. vi.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[53:2](mtc26.htm#fr_15.md) "Change" is the
principle of endless mutation which governs the Universe.
