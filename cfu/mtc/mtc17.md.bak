### \[16\] GOING ALONE TO SPEND A NIGHT AT THE HSIEN–YU TEMPLE

#### (A.D. *806*)

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> crane from the shore standing at the
top of the steps;  
The moon on the pool seen at the open door;  
Where these are, I made my lodging-place  
And for two nights could not turn away.  
I am glad I chanced on a place so lonely and still  
With no companion to drag me early home.  
Now that I have tasted the joy of being alone  
I will never again come with a friend at my side.
