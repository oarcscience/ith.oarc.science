### \[66\] HEARING THAT HIS FRIEND WAS COMING BACK FROM THE WAR

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> old days those who went to fight  
In three years had one year's leave.  
But in *this* war the soldiers are never changed;  
They must go on fighting till they die on the battle-field.  
I thought of you, so weak and indolent,  
Hopelessly trying to learn to march and drill.  
That a young man should ever come home again  
Seemed about as likely as that the sky should fall.  
Since I got the news that you were coming back,  
Twice I have mounted to the high hall of your home.  
I found your brother mending your horse's stall;  
I found your mother sewing your new clothes.  
I am half afraid; perhaps it is not true;  
Yet I never weary of watching for you on the road.  
Each day I go out at the City Gate  
With a flask of wine, lest you should come thirsty.  
Oh that I could shrink the surface of the World,  
So that suddenly I might find you standing at my side.
