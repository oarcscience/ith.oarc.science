### \[41\] LODGING WITH THE OLD MAN OF THE STREAM

#### (A.D. *820*)

<span class="smallcaps">Men's</span> hearts love gold and jade;  
Men's mouths covet wine and flesh.  
Not so the old man of the stream;  
He drinks from his gourd and asks nothing more.  
South of the stream he cuts firewood and grass;  
North of the stream he has built wall and roof.  
Yearly he sows a single acre of land;  
In spring he drives two yellow calves.  
In these things he finds great repose;  
Beyond these he has no wish or care.  
By chance I met him walking by the water-side;  
He took me home and lodged me in his thatched hut.  
When I parted from him, to seek market and Court,  
This old man asked my rank and pay.  
Doubting my tale, he laughed loud and long:  
"Privy Councillors do not sleep in barns."
