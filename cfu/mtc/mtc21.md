### \[20\] THE POEM ON THE WALL

#### (A.D. *810*)

#### *(Yüan Chēn wrote that on his way to exile he had discovered a poem inscribed by Po Chü-i, on the wall of the Lo-k‘ou Inn.)*

<span class="smallcaps">My</span> clumsy poem on the inn-wall none cared
to see.  
With bird-droppings and moss's growth the letters were blotched away.  
There came a guest with heart so full, that though a page to the
Throne,  
He did not grudge with his broidered coat to wipe off the dust, and
read.
