### \[18\] TO LI CHIEN

##### *(Part of a Poem)*

#### (A.D. *807*)

<span class="smallcaps">Worldly</span> matters again draw my steps;  
Worldly things again seduce my heart.  
Whenever for long I part from Li Chien  
Gradually my thoughts grow narrow and covetous.  
I remember how once I used to visit you;  
I stopped my horse and tapped at the garden-gate.  
Often when I came you were still lying in bed;  
Your little children were sent to let me in.  
And you, laughing, ran to the front-door  
With coat-tails flying and cap all awry.  
On the swept terrace, green patterns of moss;  
On the dusted bench, clean shadows of leaves.  
To gaze at the hills we sat in the eastern lodge;  
To wait for the moon we walked to the southern moor.  
At your quiet gate only birds spoke;  
In your distant street few drums were heard.  
Opposite each other all day we talked,  
And never once spoke of profit or fame.  
Since we parted hands, how long has passed?  
Thrice and again the full moon has shone.  
For when we parted the last flowers were falling,  
And to-day I hear new cicadas sing.  
The scented year suddenly draws to its close,  
Yet the sorrow of parting is still unsubdued.
