### \[27\] POEMS IN DEPRESSION, AT WEI VILLAGE

#### (A.D. *812*)

#### \[1\]

<span class="smallcaps">I hug</span> my pillow and do not speak a
word;  
In my empty room no sound stirs.  
Who knows that, all day a-bed,  
I am not ill and am not even asleep?

#### \[2\]

<span class="smallcaps">Turned</span> to jade are the boy's rosy
cheeks;  
To his sick temples the frost of winter clings…  
Do not wonder that my body sinks to decay;  
Though my limbs are old, my heart is older yet.
