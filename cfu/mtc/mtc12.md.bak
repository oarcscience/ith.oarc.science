### \[11\] AFTER PASSING THE EXAMINATION

#### (A.D. *800*)

<span class="smallcaps">For</span> ten years I never left my books;  
I went up… and won unmerited praise.  
My high place I do not much prize;  
The joy of my parents will first make me proud.  
Fellow students, six or seven men,  
See me off as I leave the City gate.  
My covered couch is ready to drive away;  
Flutes and strings blend their parting tune.  
Hopes achieved dull the pains of parting;  
Fumes of wine shorten the long road…  
Shod with wings is the horse of him who rides  
On a Spring day the road that leads to home.
