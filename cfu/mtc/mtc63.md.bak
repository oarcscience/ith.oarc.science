### \[62\] RESIGNATION

<span class="smallcaps">Keep</span> off your thoughts from things that
are past and done;  
For thinking of the past wakes regret and pain.  
Keep off your thoughts from thinking what will happen;  
To think of the future fills one with dismay.  
Better by day to sit like a sack in your chair;  
Better by night to lie a stone in your bed.  
When food comes, then open your mouth;  
When sleep comes, then close your eyes.
