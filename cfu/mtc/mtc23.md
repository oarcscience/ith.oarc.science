### \[22\] FISHING IN THE WEI RIVER

#### (A.D. *811*)

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> waters still as a burnished mirror's
face,  
In the depths of Wei, carp and grayling swim.  
Idly I come with my bamboo fishing-rod  
And hang my hook by the banks of Wei stream.  
A gentle wind blows on my fishing-gear  
Softly shaking my ten feet of line.  
Though my body sits waiting for fish to come,  
My heart has wandered to the Land of Nothingness. <span
id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_8.md)  
Long ago a white-headed man <span id="fr_10"></span>[2](#fn_9.md)  
Also fished at the same river's side;  
A hooker of men, not a hooker of fish,  
At seventy years, he caught Wēn Wang. <span
id="fr_11"></span>[2](#fn_9.md)  
But *I,* when I come to cast my hook in the stream,  
Have no thought either of fish or men.  
Lacking the skill to capture either prey,  
I can only bask in the autumn water's light.  
When I tire of this, my fishing also stops;  
I go to my home and drink my cup of wine.

still till he was seventy, apparently fishing, but really waiting for a
Prince who would employ him. At last Wēn Wang, Prince of Chou, happened
to come that way and at once made him his counsellor.
