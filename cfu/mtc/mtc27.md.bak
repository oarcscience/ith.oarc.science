### \[26\] THE CHRYSANTHEMUMS IN THE EASTERN GARDEN

#### (A.D. *812*)

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> days of my youth left me long ago;  
And now in their turn dwindle my years of prime.  
With what thoughts of sadness and loneliness  
I walk again in this cold, deserted place!  
In the midst of the garden long I stand alone;  
The sunshine, faint; the wind and dew chill.  
The autumn lettuce is tangled and turned to seed;  
The fair trees are blighted and withered away.  
All that is left are a few chrysanthemum-flowers  
That have newly opened beneath the wattled fence.  
I had brought wine and meant to fill my cup,  
When the sight of these made me stay my hand.  
    I remember, when I was young,  
How easily my mood changed from sad to gay.  
If I saw wine, no matter at what season,  
Before I drank it, my heart was already glad.  
    But now that age comes,  
A moment of joy is harder and harder to get.  
And always I fear that when I am quite old  
The strongest liquor will leave me comfortless.  
Therefore I ask you, late chrysanthemum-flower  
At this sad season why do you bloom alone?  
Though well I know that it was not for my sake,  
Taught by you, for a while I will open my face.
