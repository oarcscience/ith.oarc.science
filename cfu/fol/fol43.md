<span class="small"><span class="smallcaps">Social</span> reformer,
politician, and literary man, Wang An-Shih has often been called the
Father of Chinese Socialism. For many years he enjoyed supreme power as
Prime Minister of the Emperor Shen Tsung, during whose reign he
introduced a system of state doles to agriculturalists and organised a
universal militia for safeguarding the country. He lived long enough to
see the whole of his legislation repealed by his successor and rival
Ssü-ma Kuang, the historian.</span>

### AT THE PARTING WAYS

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The west wind ruffles the water

Is stirred by the lute's serenade.  
East of the world-piled hills  
Our song of parting thrills.
