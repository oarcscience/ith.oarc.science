### SAILING ACROSS LAKE MEI-PEI

Tsen-tsan and his brother delighted to dream in  
   grand horizons,  
They drew me down to the water's edge, their  
   fellow wanderer.  
Veiled was the sky and sombre the land, and  
   sudden the change from daylight,  
The wind rose and the storm-waves seemed to be  
   rolling pale gems in the foam.

Our boat shot forth from its moorings and rippled  
   into the movement,  
Great was the scene, inspiring to song, but the  
   dominant note was fear.

How should I not be stirred with danger surging  
   around me?  
Treacherous wind and crested wave, is there no  
   escaping you?

Lo now the captain unfurls the silken sail to the  
   breezes  
And the boatmen begin to rejoice as the last cloud  
   flags away.  
The wild-fowl rise with a roaring of wings, scared  
   by the chant of oarsmen;  
Lute and flute are astir; faint harmonies drip  
   from the sky.

Bright are the water-lily's leaves as though the  
   rains had burnished them.  
The slack line slips through my hands that would  
   fathom the soundless lake.  
My gaze falls on the vast expanse of the limitless  
   void before me,  
Rearward menacing, dark, Chong-Nan towers out  
   of sight.

Southward the mountains brood above the restless  
   waters,  
Their grim reflections, trembling, sink in deeps of  
   darkening blue.  
The sun sets, the boat glides by the  
   cloud-pavilioned pagoda,  
And soon the moon is mirrored in the dun dusk of  
   the lake.

’Tis then the black dragon, breathing pearls, looms  
   out of the darkness.  
’Tis then the river-god beats the drum, and the  
   shoaling monsters rise.  
The naiads leave their dim retreats, faintly their  
   revels find us,  
And the pale streamers of their quickened lutes  
   gleam for an instant far away.
