### CH‘ANG CH‘IEN

### CIRCA A.D. 720

<span class="small"><span class="smallcaps">The</span> story of the
beautiful Chao-Chün is a favourite theme of Chinese poets and
ballad-mongers. The Emperor Kaotsu, the founder of the glorious Han
dynasty, made a treaty with a certain Prince of the Huns, who as a
pledge of its fulfilment demanded the hand of "a flower from the palace
of the Hans." Kaotsu sent a messenger to the capital with orders that
all the girls in the palace apartments awaiting a summons from the
Emperor should have their portraits painted. When this was done he chose
from the number the dullest and most insipid, and commanded the original
to be brought into his presence before sending her to the Prince. The
astonished Court then beheld a girl whose beauty enchanted all eyes, a
vision of loveliness unsurpassed. But the Emperor's word was final, and
Chao-Chün crossed the border to her lifelong exile. The Emperor wreaked
his vengeance on the faithless painter whose lying portrait was the
cause of her sacrifice, but her lost charms obsessed him, and he could
never forget. Vainly the caravan of a hundred camels, laden with gold,
the ransom for an Empress, set out for the country of the Huns. Their
Prince refused all offers for her while she lived, and when she died
even the last honour of burial in her native land was rejected.</span>
