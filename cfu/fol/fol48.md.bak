### LISTENING TO THE HARP

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="smallcaps">Night</span> and the midway moon. Some hidden
lute  
Sounds from a silken alcove. As the wind  
Swells and recedes the lutany now swells,  
Now falters. Now commingled with the clouds  
It throbs betwixt the earth and moon. Almost  
Like gentle mockery the echoes fall  
As laughter breaks on tears. The hand that sways

The crowded chords I see not, but the heart  
Made visible by music far away  
Spells me her dreams. Ah! mourns she not the tryst  
New made and newly broken, but the old  
Lost love of long ago. Her melodies  
Are secret sorrows welling through the lute—  
Are captive nightingales escaped in song.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

One touch of the chords, and snow-flakes scatter round  
One, and the flowing brightness of the sun  
Passes. Perchance she grieves that few may hear  
And understand. The floating dust collects  
Beneath her silver nail-tips. Lone is she  
As orphan phœnix calling, with whose plaint  
The songs of all birds fail to harmonise.
