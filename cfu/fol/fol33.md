### MYSELF

What of myself?  
I am like unto the sere chrysanthemum  
That is shorn by the frost-blade, and, torn from its roots,  
Whirled away on the wind.  
Once in the valleys of Ch‘in and Yung I rambled at will,  
Now ring me round the unfriendly plains of the wild folk of Pa.  
O galloping dawns with Youth and Ambition riding knee to knee!  
Ride on, Youth, with the galloping dawns and dappled days!  
I am unhorsed, outventured—  
I, who crouch by the crumbling embers, old, and grey, and alone.  
One great hour of noon with the sky-faring Rukh  
I clanged on the golden dome of Heaven.  
Now in the long dusk of adversity  
I have found my palace of contentment my dream pavilion;  
Even the tiny twig of the little humble wren.
