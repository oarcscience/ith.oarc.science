### YANG CHI

#### CIRCA A.D. 1400

<span class="small"><span class="smallcaps">A native</span> of the
province of Kiang-su, Yang Chi became a district magistrate and
afterwards secretary to the Minister of War, by whom he was sent into
the province of Shansi as Treasurer-General to the Forces. He suffered
the fate of so many Chinese officials, being impeached and falsely
accused and finally condemned to life-long exile, during which the
following suggestive little poem was written.</span>

### LINES WRITTEN IN EXILE

As pure as autumn water falls the dew;  
And cool of night is born when faintly sighs  
The wind, that outcast of the twilight, dies,  
And the green gloom of random grass anew  
Covers the undulating shores. I see  
Far out upon the lake an island gleaming  
With a girdle of red nenuphar, and, dreaming,  
I fill my sail o’ dreams in search of thee.  
Cold eyes of strangers follow me, and fears  
Start with the trumpet from the ramparts blown.  
And on my darkened robes are sown  
Two pearls, my tears.
