### <span class="smallcaps">Moon</span>

The moon hangs low over the old continent of Chinese poetry. Chang O,
Moon-goddess, is the beautiful pale watcher of the human drama, and all
that she has known of secret things, of passion and pleasure, swift ruin
and slow decay, she records in music. Through her great palaces of cold
drift the broken melodies of unrecorded lives. She is the Goddess alike
of sorrow and love—of Po Chü-i who in exile hears only the lurking
cuckoo's blood-stained note, the gibbon's mournful wail, and Chang Jo Hu
who rides triumphant on a moonbeam into the darkened chamber of his
lady's sleep. Her rays are more persistent than water; you may draw the
curtains and think you have shut out night with all its whispering of
leaves, but a tiny crevice will let her in.

Best of all the poets loved her when she lingered above the broken
courts and roofless halls of vanished kings.

Time and nemesis wrote large upon their walls, but moonlight brought
them a glamour unknown to history, and cast a silver mantle lightly upon
their dust. They were what Tu Fu and Meng Hao Jan willed—bright shadows
in the rose alleys of romance; Gods of War and builders of their

dreams in stone. At least one singer prayed the Moon that his passionate
heart might haunt the ruins of Chang-An, a nightingale. All sacred
intimacies and desires that dare not clothe themselves in words have her
confidence, and because she is goddess as well as woman she will never
betray them. She links together the thoughts of lovers separated by a
hundred hills and the lonely places of despair are steeped in her
kindness. On the fifteenth of the eighth month she graciously descends
from her "domain, vast, cold, pure, unsubstantial," and grants the
desires of all who await her coming.

Lastly, she is the link between the present and the past, binding us in
the solemn hours to the men or women who have lived and wrought beneath
her spell. One Chinese poet, remembering in moonlight the lovers of long
ago, prayed that lovers yet to come might also remember him. Two hundred
years had flown, and after a night of splendour some woodman passing at
dawn found a double lotus on a broken tomb. And Kyuso Muro, the Japanese
philosopher, has written: "It is the moon which lights generation after
generation, and now shines in the sky. So may we call it the Memento of
the Generations. As we look upon it, and think of the things of old, we
seem to see the reflections of the forms and faces of the past. Though
the moon says not a word, yet it speaks. If we have forgotten them it

recalls the ages gone by… The present is the past to the future, and in
that age some one like me will grieve as he looks upon the moon."
