I am indebted to the editors of *The Nation, The English Review,* and
*The Poetry Review,* for their kind permission to reproduce several of
the poems included in the book. My thanks are also due to Dr. Lionel
Giles for the great help and assistance he has given me, notably in
translations from Li Po and Po Chü-i, also to Mr. H. H. Harding for his
valuable translations of many selections from the Sung poets. I owe the
inclusion of Yuan Mei's last poem on the last page to the late Mr. Ken
Hoshino, translator of Kaibara Ekkens *Way of Contentment* in this
series.

L. C.-B.
