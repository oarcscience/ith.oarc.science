### WANG WEI

#### A.D. 699-759

<span class="small"><span class="smallcaps">A celebrated</span> poet and
doctor who served two masters, the Emperor Ming Huang and the rebel
general An Lu-Shan, and was eventually appointed governor of a province
by the Emperor Su-tsung. It is recorded of An Lu-Shan that he once asked
him what kind of animal a poet was, and what purpose he served. Wang Wei
shortly afterwards had his revenge when, called upon to sing at a rebel
banquet, he improvised verses in honour of his former patron Ming
Huang.</span>

### WHILE ROSES FALL

Dawn after dawn the last doth nearer bring.  
Ah! what avails the shy return of spring?  
Then fill the wine-cup of to-day and let  
Night and the roses fall, while we forget.
