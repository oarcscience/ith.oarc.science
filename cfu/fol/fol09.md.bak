### <span class="smallcaps">Epochs In Chinese Poetry</span>

Great dynasties in China made for great art and literature largely under
the influence of a national awakening. Expeditions and embassies to
distant lands brought back new ideas; and, above

all, the fusion of two widely different types of mind, the Northern or
Confucian type and the Southern or Taoist, prevented thought from
becoming too formalised and gave a new impetus to creative imagination.
Small kingdoms meant perpetual warfare and militarism; hence few names
famous in literature will be found in the annals of dynasties like the
Ch‘i and early Sung.

The poetical metres of each age vary according to the requirements of
the period. In the beginning we find the short metre of the Odes well
adapted to the needs of a simpler civilisation. Gradually, as society
becomes more complex, the verse needs grow until finally the five and
seven-character line of the T‘ang dynasty appears, and after that the
form has become stereotyped. The great Sung poets continued the T‘ang
tradition, but added little to it, and after them only a few flashes of
original genius illumine here and there a dark horizon.

The oldest period of all, that of the Odes, has a range of nearly 1,200
years, from 1765 to 585 B.C.

Towards the close of the Chou dynasty, in the fourth century B.C., Ch‘u
Yuan wrote his celebrated Li Sao, or "Falling into Error." He may be
called the father of the Chinese nature poets.

The Han dynasty, B.C. 206 to A.D. 221, contains very little poetry of
the first rank.

T‘ao Ch‘ien belongs to the eastern Tsin dynasty, which lasted about one
hundred years, from 317

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

to 419 A.D. This author has been comparatively neglected as yet by
Western scholars. Many of his poems would be well worth translating.

The T‘ang dynasty, 618 to 905 A. D., is the golden age of Chinese
poetry. Most of the famous poets belonged to this period. Li Po, Tu Fu,
Po Chü-i, Han Yu, are only a few names mentioned at random.

From 907 to 960 A.D. came the period of the Five Dynasties, with no
great name outstanding.

The Sung dynasty, from 960 to 1206 A.D., ranks after the T‘ang as the
second greatest epoch in Chinese literature. The most celebrated poets
of this age were Ou-Yang Hsiu and Su Tung-p‘o.

The Mongol, or Yuan dynasty, lasted from 1206 to 1368 A.D., and produced
one great poet, Liu Chi.

During the Ming dynasty, A.D. 1368-1644, novel-writing was greatly in
vogue, but there is nothing in the poetry of this period that would
challenge comparison with the masterpieces of an earlier date.

The Manchu dynasty, which began in A.D. 1644 and only recently ended,
contains the names of Yuan Mei and Chiu Tsy-Yung, whose Cantonese *Love
Songs,* translated by Mr. Cecil Clementi, are fast becoming a classic.
