### *II. Sadness*

The east wind has returned. The green of the  
      grass renews and I know that spring is here.  
Streams unbound awake into the dance of life.  
Softly the weeping willow waves its long slim  
      boughs.  
What sorrow is there in its movement!

Light of the sky, most fair, most tender blue!  
Air of the sea, sweet-scented, fresh, green-tinged!  
Bright colours on the emerald, dreaming off into  
      the distance in a half-seen veil—such was the  
      earth.  
The little clouds hover lightly in the heights, each  
      melting into the more radiant beyond.  
Headlong waters are gathered in headlong streams.  
My glance falls on the moss by the river-bend.  
      How delicate and swift its movements in the  
      wind!  
Gauze of the wandering threads whirled here and  
      there, my spirit is minded to escape and whirl  
      along with you.  
O air and light! I am drunk with you! I am  
      dazed—and I am plunged in sorrow.

One who has hearkened to the waters roaring  
      down from the heights of Lung, and faint  
      voices from the land of Ch‘in; one who has  
      listened to the cries of monkeys on the shores

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

      of the Yang-tse-Kiang, and the songs of the  
      land of Pa; that renowned beauty Wang  
      Chao-Chün, who saw before her the last  
      jasper gate of her native land; that renowned  
      Ch‘u poet singing the glories of the tinted  
      maple wood—ah! these knew sorrow.  
And if I ascend, and, mindful of them, look out  
      across the blue horizon, I feel the keen pang  
      of grief that, piercing through me, finds my  
      heart.

The soul of man swells like a wave at the coming  
      of spring.  
But there is also the sadness of spring-time, which,  
      like falling snow, distracts us.  
Both sorrow and joy throbbing and pulsing—a  
      countless crowd of feelings are stirred and  
      mingle together in this festival of perfume.  
What if I have a friend far away on the shores of  
      the Hsiang! Clouds part us and hide us  
      from each other.  
Upon a little wave I shed the tears of separation,  
      and—little wave going eastward, take to  
      my friend my soul-felt love.  
Oh! that I could grasp this golden light of  
      spring, keep it and horde it—a treasure-trove  
      of days for my fairest far-off friend.
