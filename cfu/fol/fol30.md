### HAN YÜ

#### A.D. 768-824

<span class="small"><span class="smallcaps">One</span> of the wittiest
and most brilliant of the Tang statesmen and philosophers, Han Yü's
poetry has been overshadowed by his prose essays, which have been upheld
as models of Chinese literature. He attempted to found a new school of
Confucianism, being a bitter opponent of the Buddhist tendencies of his
day, and was banished to a semi-barbarous region which he set to work to
civilise. Su Tung-p‘o, the great Sung poet, wrote a magnificent poem to
his memory which has been translated by Professor Giles (cf. *Chinese
Literature,* p. 161).</span>

### DISAPPOINTMENT

Still moonlight floods the inner gallery,  
Where the japonica sets fluttering  
Her silvered petals. Languidly  
I rise, and let my absent glance  
Fall where the shadows of the swing  
Over the door-step dance.

I am possessed  
By spring's rough humid winds that penetrate  
The silken curtains of my lonely state,  
And cannot rest,

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

For all my sorrow.  
During the night I hear the heavy rain  
Crash on the lotus pool afar.  
To-morrow! ah to-morrow!  
The little boat lies swamped that I would fain  
Have steered in search of the golden nenuphar.
