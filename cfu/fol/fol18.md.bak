### THE TWO VISITS

#### *Visit to the Cold Clear Spring*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ah! when the darkness blinds the orb of day  
This cold clear spring chatters my grief away,  
And, as the current whirls along,  
She lilts a little wordless song;  
This little wizard, clear and cold,  
Echoes the thoughts I left untold,  
And for music I have the sound  
Of the tall pines surging round.

</div>

#### *Visit to the White Stream Rapids*

I crossed the White Stream at its slender source  
When Dawn first cleft the tangle of the stars  
And shook the darkness from her. And I saw,  
Passing a while from the worn tracks of men,  
Islands innumerable environèd  
In Nature's colours gold and green. The sky  
Laid the blue mirror of eternity  
Upon the shining waters. One by one  
The clouds sailed out to sea. My random thoughts  
Went wandering where monsters silver-mailed  
Flash down their native streams. I sang the songs  
That swelled with noon and faltered with the dusk  
And failed in the twilight. Then I sought the gleam  
Of cottage eaves amid the moonlit fields.
