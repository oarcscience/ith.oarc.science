### THE PALACE OF CHAO-YANG

No more the peach-tree droops beneath the snow;  
   Spring draws her breath the willow boughs among.  
   The mango-bird now maddens into song,  
And the swift-building swallows come and go.  
’Tis the time of the long daydreams, when laughing maybeams,  
   On the mats of slothful revellers play;  
’Tis the time of glancing wings, and the dancing  
   Of moon-moths whirling the hours away;  
When the golden armoured guardians are withdrawn,  
And pleasure haunts the rustling woods till dawn.

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

A warm and perfumed wind  
   Strays through the palace blind  
And wandering prys into some dim retreat  
   Where every whisper stirs the heart to beat.  
Now all the gay parterres  
   Are rivals for the sun  
That drains their jewelled goblets one by one  
   From dimpled terrace and green dewy stairs.  
And the water-lily renders to the spring  
The wonder of her white unbosoming.  
   Far away in the tall woods there is an oriole calling;  
There are shadows in the blue pavilion of dancers,  
      and music rising and falling,  
In the month of peach-bloom and plum-bloom,  
      in the silken-screened recess  
Love is the burden of sweet voices, and the brief  
      night melting, and the long caress.
