### SPRING RHAPSODIES

#### *I. Delight*

Once more Heaven bids the plough-star drive  
      before the spring, and turn its handle to the east,  
Spring—the blue harmonies of tumultuous waters!  
The fair fragrance of orchid sprays.  
Climb and look out and beyond. At once the eye  
      retains the whole immeasurable expanse of  
      the sea, and the slenderest film of the clouds.  
The soul streams out in ecstasy.  
Tears! my tears are falling.  
Of the gentle pure breeze I sing—of the waves  
      of Chang-lang are my songs  
Of lake Duntkhin are my dreams, and my sighs  
      for the river-lands of Oyas and Oyan.  
What a lightness of health is in my soul! One  
      with the spring-wafting of the wind, it soars  
      away and flies I know not where. Yes! it  
      soars, but whither I know not. And my  
      thoughts are boundless.  
I am whelmed in a dream of this fairest of seasons,  
      in a mood that dispels not.  
The whole plain heaves into bloom—what flowers!  
      what sceneries!  
Ah! fragrance of sweet herbs, my love and grief  
      are for you.  
Sorrow, a sharp-edged knife, is sheathed in my  
      heart,

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

For these are the last of spring—the ending of  
      spring's last days.  
Sadness of heart takes hold of me, and no light  
      weariness.

Away my thoughts! By the winding Khang, by  
      the roaring rapids of Syan my plunging  
      hands are hidden with fairy flowers—and  
      still my thoughts have mastered me…

Each year this picture is the same. Spring comes  
      —the flowers bloom. But lo, there is an  
      end of them—and change comes over spring.

Swiftly, swiftly the long river speeds away its  
      waters.  
I follow with my gaze the flowing waves and in  
      thought  
I pass with them to the east, to the very sea.  
Alas! ’tis even so with spring—it stays not with  
      us once its time has come.  
Soon, too soon will Destiny send forth the breath  
      of tottering age.  
Ah! that I cannot fling a long, long rope over the  
      blue sky and bind with it the white orb of  
      light as it rushes on to its setting!
