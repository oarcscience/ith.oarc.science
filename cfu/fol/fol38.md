### OU-YANG HSIU

#### A.D. 1007-1072

<span class="small"><span class="smallcaps">Ou-Yang Hsiu</span>, Chief
Minister of State 1061 A.D., was one of the two foremost poets of the
Sung dynasty. His poems, which have been all too little translated, are
remarkable both for their exquisite imagery and colouring. Together with
Sung Ch‘i, he produced the history of the T‘ang period. Cf. *A. Lute of
Jade*, p. 111.</span>

### RETURN

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

You far away—you know  
That when the wine-cup reddens o’er the lake  
I call to you a thousand leagues apart,  
From the sheer confines of the world, and lo,  
All golden for your sake,  
Spring dimples through the doorway of my heart.

</div>
