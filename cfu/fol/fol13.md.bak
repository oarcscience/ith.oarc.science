### WANG PO

#### A.D. 648-670

<span class="small"><span class="smallcaps">One</span> of the earliest
of the T‘ang poets. He was famous for his power of improvising, and
seldom required to re-write a single line. His career, begun at the
precocious age of six, was cut short by drowning when he was only
twenty-nine. During this brief period, however, his influence was very
great, and many students came to him for instruction in philosophy and
literature.</span>

### A KING OF TANG

There looms a lordly pleasure-tower o’er yon dim shore,  
Raised by some King of Tang.  
Jade pendants at his girdle clashed, and golden bells  
Around his chariot rang.

Strange guests through sounding halls at dawn go trailing by,  
Grey mists and mocking winds;  
And sullen brooding twilights break in rain on rain,  
To lash the ragged blinds.

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

The slow, sun-dappled clouds lean down o’er waters blue,  
Clear mirrored one by one;  
Then drift as all the world shall drift. The very stars  
Their timeless courses run.

How many autumn moons have steeped those palace walls!  
And paled the shattered beams!  
What is their royal builder now? A Lord of dust?  
An Emperor of dreams?
