# Fox Legends

## The Fox

Among the many animals worshipped by the Chinese, those at times seen
emerging from coffins or graves naturally hold a prominent place. They
are supposed to be the transmigrated souls of deceased human beings. We
should therefore expect such animals as the fox, stoat, weasel, etc., to
be closely associated with the worship of ghosts, spirits, and suchlike
creatures, and that they should be the subjects of, or included in, a
large number of Chinese legends. This we find. Of these animals the fox
is mentioned in Chinese legendary lore perhaps more often than any
other.

The subject of fox-lore has been dealt with exhaustively by my respected
colleague, the late Mr Thomas Watters (formerly H.B.M. Consul-General at
Canton, a man of vast learning and extreme modesty, insufficiently
appreciated in his generation), in the *Journal of the North China
Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society*, viii, 45–65, to which the reader
is referred for details. Generally, the fox is a creature of ill omen,
long-lived (living to eight hundred or even a thousand years), with a
peculiar virtue in every part of his body, able to produce fire by
striking the ground with his tail, cunning, cautious, sceptical, able to
see into the future, to transform himself (usually into old men, or
scholars, or pretty young maidens), and fond of playing pranks and
tormenting mankind.

## Fox Legends

Many interesting fox legends are to be found in a collection of stories
entitled *Liao chai chih i*, by P’u Sung-ling (seventeenth century
A.D.), part of which was translated <span id="page_371">p.
371</span> into English many years ago by Professor H.A. Giles and
appeared in two fascinating volumes called *Strange Stories from a
Chinese Studio*. These legends were related to the Chinese writer by
various people as their own experiences.

## Friendship with Foxes

A certain man had an enormous stack of straw, as big as a hill, in which
his servants, taking what was daily required for use, had made quite a
large hole. In this hole a fox fixed his abode, and would often show
himself to the master of the house under the form of an old man. One day
the latter invited the master to walk into his abode; he at first
declined, but accepted on being pressed; and when he got inside, lo! he
saw a long suite of handsome apartments. They then sat down, and
exquisitely perfumed tea and wine were brought; but the place was so
gloomy that there was no difference between night and day. By and by,
the entertainment being over, the guest took his leave; and on looking
back the beautiful rooms and their contents had all disappeared. The old
man himself was in the habit of going away in the evening and returning
with the first streaks of morning; and as no one was able to follow him,
the master of the house asked him one day whither he went. To this he
replied that a friend invited him to take wine; and then the master
begged to be allowed to accompany him, a proposal to which the old man
very reluctantly consented. However, he seized the master by the arm,
and away they went as though riding on the wings of the wind; and in
about the time it takes to cook a pot of millet they reached a city and
walked into a restaurant, where there were a number of people drinking
together and making a great noise. The old man led his companion to a
gallery above, from which <span id="page_372">p. 372</span> they could
look down on the feasters below; and he himself went down and brought
away from the tables all kinds of nice food and wine, without appearing
to be seen or noticed by any of the company. After a while a man dressed
in red garments came forward and laid upon the table some dishes of
cumquats;  <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md) the master at once
requested the old man to go down and get him some of these. “Ah,”
replied the latter, “that is an upright man: I cannot approach him.”
Thereupon the master said to himself, “By thus seeking the companionship
of a fox, I then am deflected from the true course. Henceforth I too
will be an upright man.” No sooner had he formed this resolution than he
suddenly lost all control over his body, and fell from the gallery down
among the revellers below. These gentlemen were much astonished by his
unexpected descent; and he himself, looking up, saw there was no gallery
to the house, but only a large beam upon which he had been sitting. He
now detailed the whole of the circumstances, and those present made up a
purse for him to pay his travelling expenses; for he was at Yü-t’ai—a
thousand *li* from home.

## The Marriage Lottery

A certain labourer, named Ma T’ien-jung, lost his wife when he was only
about twenty years of age, and was too poor to take another. One day,
when out hoeing in the fields, he beheld a nice-looking young lady leave
the path and come tripping across the furrows toward him. Her face was
well painted,  <span id="fr_36"></span>[2](#fn_36.md) and she had
altogether such a <span id="page_373">p. 373</span> refined look that Ma
concluded she must have lost her way, and began to make some playful
remarks in consequence. “You go along home,” cried the young lady, “and
I’ll be with you by and by.” Ma doubted this rather extraordinary
promise, but she vowed and declared she would not break her word; and
then Ma went off, telling her that his front door faced the north, etc.
At midnight the young lady arrived, and then Ma saw that her hands and
face were covered with fine hair, which made him suspect at once that
she was a fox. She did not deny the accusation; and accordingly Ma said
to her, “If you really are one of those wonderful creatures you will be
able to get me anything I want; and I should be much obliged if you
would begin by giving me some money to relieve my poverty.” The young
lady said she would; and next evening, when she came again, Ma asked her
where the money was. “Dear me!” replied she, “I quite forgot it.” When
she was going away Ma reminded her of what he wanted, but on the
following evening she made precisely the same excuse, promising to bring
it another day. A few nights afterward Ma asked her once more for the
money, and then she drew from her sleeve two pieces of silver, each
weighing about five or six ounces. They were both of fine quality, with
turned-up edges,  <span id="fr_37"></span>[3](#fn_37.md) and Ma was very
pleased, and stored them away in a cupboard. Some months after this he
happened to require some money for use, and took out these pieces; but
the person to whom he showed them said they were only pewter, and easily
bit off a portion of one of them with his teeth. Ma was much alarmed,
and put the pieces away directly, taking the opportunity when evening
came of abusing the young lady roundly. “It’s all your bad luck,”
retorted she. <span id="page_374">p. 374</span> “Real gold would be too
much for your inferior destiny.” There was an end of that; but Ma went
on to say, “I always heard that fox-girls were of surpassing beauty; how
is it you are not?” “Oh,” replied the young lady, “we always adapt
ourselves to our company. Now you haven’t the luck of an ounce of silver
to call your own; and what would you do, for instance, with a beautiful
princess? My beauty may not be good enough for the aristocracy; but
among your big-footed, bent-backed rustics,  <span
id="fr_38"></span>[4](#fn_38.md) why, it may safely be called
‘surpassing’!”

A few months passed away, and then one day the young lady came and gave
Ma three ounces of silver, saying, “You have often asked me for money,
but in consequence of your bad luck I have always refrained from giving
you any. Now, however, your marriage is at hand, and I here give you the
cost of a wife, which you may also regard as a parting gift from me.” Ma
replied that he was not engaged, to which the young lady answered that
in a few days a go-between would visit him to arrange the affair. “And
what will she be like?” asked Ma. “Why, as your aspirations are for
‘surpassing’ beauty,” replied the young lady, “of course she will be
possessed of surpassing beauty.” “I hardly expect that,” said Ma; “at
any rate, three ounces of silver will not be enough to get a wife.”
“Marriages,” explained the young lady, “are made in the moon;  <span
id="fr_39"></span>[5](#fn_39.md) mortals have nothing to do with them.”
“And why must you be going away like this?” inquired Ma. “Because,”
answered she, “for us to meet only by night is not the proper thing. I
had <span id="page_375">p. 375</span> better get you another wife and
have done with you.” Then when morning came she departed, giving Ma a
pinch of yellow powder, saying, “In case you are ill after we are
separated, this will cure you.” Next day, sure enough, a go-between did
come, and Ma at once asked what the proposed bride was like; to which
the former replied that she was very passable-looking. Four or five
ounces of silver was fixed as the marriage present, Ma making no
difficulty on that score, but declaring he must have a peep at the young
lady.  <span id="fr_40"></span>[6](#fn_40.md) The go-between said she was a
respectable girl, and would never allow herself to be seen; however, it
was arranged that they should go to the house together, and await a good
opportunity. So off they went, Ma remaining outside while the go-between
went in, returning in a little while to tell him it was all right. “A
relative of mine lives in the same court, and just now I saw the young
lady sitting in the hall. We have only got to pretend we are going to
see my relative, and you will be able to get a glimpse of her.” Ma
consented, and they accordingly passed through the hall, where he saw
the young lady sitting down with her head bent forward while some one
was scratching her back. She seemed to be all that the go-between had
said; but when they came to discuss the money it appeared that the young
lady wanted only one or two ounces of silver, just to buy herself a few
clothes, etc., which Ma thought was a very small amount; so he gave the
go-between a present for her trouble, which just finished up the three
ounces his fox-friend had provided. An auspicious day was chosen, and
the young lady came over to his house; when lo! she was humpbacked and
pigeon-breasted, with a short neck like <span id="page_376">p.
376</span> a tortoise, and feet which were fully ten inches long. The
meaning of his fox-friend’s remarks then flashed upon him.

## The Magnanimous Girl

At Chin-ling there lived a young man named Ku, who had considerable
ability, but was very poor; and having an old mother, he was very loth
to leave home. So he employed himself in writing or painting  <span
id="fr_41"></span>[7](#fn_41.md) for people, and gave his mother the
proceeds, going on thus till he was twenty-five years of age without
taking a wife. Opposite to their house was another building, which had
long been untenanted; and one day an old woman and a young girl came to
occupy it, but there being no gentleman with them young Ku did not make
any inquiries as to who they were or whence they hailed. Shortly
afterward it chanced that just as Ku was entering the house he observed
a young lady come out of his mother’s door. She was about eighteen or
nineteen, very clever and refined-looking, and altogether such a girl as
one rarely sets eyes on; and when she noticed Mr Ku she did not run
away, but seemed quite self-possessed. “It was the young lady over the
way; she came to borrow my scissors and measure,” said his mother, “and
she told me that there is only her mother and herself. They don’t seem
to belong to the lower classes. I asked her why she didn’t get married,
to which she replied that her mother was old. I must go and call on
<span id="page_377">p. 377</span> her to-morrow, and find out how the
land lies. If she doesn’t expect too much, you could take care of her
mother for her.” So next day Ku’s mother went, and found that the girl’s
mother was deaf, and that they were evidently poor, apparently not
having a day’s food in the house. Ku’s mother asked what their
employment was, and the old lady said they trusted for food to her
daughter’s ten fingers. She then threw out some hints about uniting the
two families, to which the old lady seemed to agree; but, on
consultation with her daughter, the latter would not consent. Mrs Ku
returned home and told her son, saying, “Perhaps she thinks we are too
poor. She doesn’t speak or laugh, is very nice-looking, and as pure as
snow; truly no ordinary girl.” There ended that; until one day, as Ku
was sitting in his study, up came a very agreeable young fellow, who
said he was from a neighbouring village, and engaged Ku to draw a
picture for him. The two youths soon struck up a firm friendship and met
constantly, and later it happened that the stranger chanced to see the
young lady of over the way. “Who is that?” said he, following her with
his eyes. Ku told him, and then he said, “She is certainly pretty, but
rather stern in her appearance.” By and by Ku went in, and his mother
told him the girl had come to beg a little rice, as they had had nothing
to eat all day. “She’s a good daughter,” said his mother, “and I’m very
sorry for her. We must try and help them a little.” Ku thereupon
shouldered a peck of rice, and, knocking at their door, presented it
with his mother’s compliments. The young lady received the rice, but
said nothing; and then she got into the habit of coming over and helping
Ku’s mother with her work and household affairs, almost as if she had
been her daughter-in-law, for which Ku was very grateful to her, <span
id="page_378">p. 378</span> and whenever he had anything nice he always
sent some of it in to her mother, though the young lady herself never
once took the trouble to thank him. So things went on until Ku’s mother
got an abscess on her leg, and lay writhing in agony day and night. Then
the young lady devoted herself to the invalid, waiting on her and giving
her medicine with such care and attention that at last the sick woman
cried out, “O that I could secure such a daughter-in-law as you to see
this old body into its grave!” The young lady soothed her, and replied,
“Your son is a hundred times more filial than I, a poor widow’s only
daughter.” “But even a filial son makes a bad nurse,” answered the
patient; “besides, I am now drawing toward the evening of my life, when
my body will be exposed to the mists and the dews, and I am vexed in
spirit about our ancestral worship and the continuance of our line.” As
she was speaking Ku walked in; and his mother, weeping, said, “I am
deeply indebted to this young lady; do not forget to repay her
goodness.” Ku made a low bow, but the young lady said, “Sir, when you
were kind to my mother, I did not thank you; why then thank me?” Ku
thereupon became more than ever attached to her; but could never get her
to depart in the slightest degree from her cold demeanour toward
himself. One day, however, he managed to squeeze her hand, upon which
she told him never to do so again; and then for some time he neither saw
nor heard anything of her. She had conceived a violent dislike to the
young stranger above mentioned; and one evening, when he was sitting
talking with Ku, the young lady appeared. After a while she got angry at
something he said, and drew from her robe a glittering knife about a
foot long. The young man, seeing her do this, ran out in a fright <span
id="page_379">p. 379</span> and she after him, only to find that he had
vanished. She then threw her dagger up into the air, and *whish!* a
streak of light like a rainbow, and something came tumbling down with a
flop. Ku got a light, and ran to see what it was; and lo! there lay a
white fox, head in one place and body in another. “There is your
*friend*,” cried the girl; “I knew he would cause me to destroy him
sooner or later.” Ku dragged it into the house, and said, “Let us wait
till to-morrow to talk it over; we shall then be more calm.” Next day
the young lady arrived, and Ku inquired about her knowledge of the black
art; but she told Ku not to trouble himself about such affairs, and to
keep it secret or it might be prejudicial to his happiness. Ku then
entreated her to consent to their union, to which she replied that she
had already been as it were a daughter-in-law to his mother, and there
was no need to push the thing further. “Is it because I am poor?” asked
Ku. “Well, I am not rich,” answered she, “but the fact is I had rather
not.” She then took her leave, and the next evening when Ku went across
to their house to try once more to persuade her the young lady had
disappeared, and was never seen again.

## The Boon-companion

Once upon a time there was a young man named Ch’ê, who was not
particularly well off, but at the same time very fond of his wine; so
much so that without his three stoups of liquor every night he was quite
unable to sleep, and bottles were seldom absent from the head of his
bed. One night he had waked up and was turning over and over, when he
fancied some one was in the bed with him; but then, thinking it was only
the clothes which had slipped off, he put out his hand to feel, and in
doing so touched <span id="page_380">p. 380</span> something silky like
a cat. Striking a light, he found it was a fox, lying in a drunken sleep
like a dog; and then looking at his wine bottle he saw that it had been
emptied. “A boon-companion,” said he, laughing, as he avoided startling
the animal, and, covering it up, lay down to sleep with his arm across
it, and the candle alight so as to see what transformation it might
undergo. About midnight the fox stretched itself, and Ch’ê cried, “Well,
to be sure, you’ve had a nice sleep!” He then drew off the clothes, and
beheld an elegant young man in a scholar’s dress; but the young man
jumped up, and, making a low obeisance, returned his host many thanks
for not cutting off his head. “Oh,” replied Ch’ê, “I am not averse to
liquor myself; in fact they say I’m too much given to it. If you have no
objection, we’ll be a pair of bottle-and-glass chums.” So they lay down
and went to sleep again, Ch’ê urging the young man to visit him often,
and saying that they must have faith in each other. The fox agreed to
this, but when Ch’ê awoke in the morning his bedfellow had already
disappeared. So he prepared a goblet of first-rate wine in expectation
of his friend’s arrival, and at nightfall sure enough he came. They then
sat together drinking, and the fox cracked so many jokes that Ch’ê said
he regretted he had not known him before. “And truly I don’t know how to
repay your kindness,” replied the former, “in preparing all this nice
wine for me.” “Oh,” said Ch’ê, “what’s a pint or so of wine?—nothing
worth speaking of.” “Well,” rejoined the fox, “you are only a poor
scholar, and money isn’t so easily to be got. I must see if I can’t
secure a little wine capital for you.” Next evening, when he arrived, he
said to Ch’ê, “Two miles down toward the south-east you will find some
silver lying by the wayside. Go early in the morning and get it.” So on
the morrow <span id="page_381">p. 381</span> Ch’ê set off, and actually
obtained two lumps of silver, with which he bought some choice morsels
to help them out with their wine that evening. The fox now told him that
there was a vault in his backyard which he ought to open; and when he
did so he found therein more than a hundred strings of cash.  <span
id="fr_42"></span>[8](#fn_42.md) “Now then,” cried Ch’ê, delighted, “I
shall have no more anxiety about funds for buying wine with all this in
my purse!” “Ah,” replied the fox, “the water in a puddle is not
inexhaustible. I must do something further for you.” Some days afterward
the fox said to Ch’ê, “Buckwheat is very cheap in the market just now.
Something is to be done in that line.” Accordingly Ch’ê bought over
forty tons, and thereby incurred general ridicule; but by and by there
was a bad drought, and all kinds of grain and beans were spoilt. Only
buckwheat would grow, and Ch’ê sold off his stock at a profit of 1000
per cent. His wealth thus began to increase; he bought two hundred acres
of rich land, and always planted his crops, corn, millet, or what not,
upon the advice of the fox secretly given him beforehand. The fox looked
on Ch’ê’s wife as a sister, and on Ch’ê’s children as his own; but when
subsequently Ch’ê died it never came to the house again.

Chia Tzŭ-lung Finds the Stone

## The Alchemist  <span id="fr_43"></span>[9](#fn_43.md)

At Ch’ang-an there lived a scholar named Chia Tzŭ-lung, who one day
noticed a very refined-looking stranger; and, on making inquiries about
him, learned that he was a Mr Chên who had taken lodgings hard by.
Accordingly, Chia called next day and sent in his card, but did not see
<span id="page_382">p. 382</span> Chên, who happened to be out at the
time. The same thing occurred thrice; and at length Chia engaged some
one to watch and let him know when Mr Chên was at home. However, even
then the latter would not come forth to receive his guest, and Chia had
to go in and rout him out. The two now entered into conversation, and
soon became mutually charmed with each other; and by and by Chia sent
off a servant to bring wine from a neighbouring wine-shop. Mr Chên
proved himself a pleasant boon-companion, and when the wine was nearly
finished he went to a box and took from it some wine-cups and a large
and beautiful jade tankard; into the latter he poured a single cup of
wine, and immediately it was filled to the brim. They then proceeded to
help themselves from the tankard; but however much they took out, the
contents never seemed to diminish. Chia was astonished at this, and
begged Mr Chên to tell him how it was done. “Ah,” replied Mr Chên, “I
tried to avoid making your acquaintance solely because of your one bad
quality—avarice. The art I practise is a secret known to the Immortals
only: how can I divulge it to you?” “You do me wrong,” rejoined Chia,
“in thus attributing avarice to me. The avaricious, indeed, are always
poor.” Mr Chên laughed, and they separated for that day; but from that
time they were constantly together, and all ceremony was laid aside
between them. Whenever Chia wanted money Mr Chên would bring out a black
stone, and, muttering a charm, would rub it on a tile or a brick, which
was forthwith changed into a lump of silver. This silver he would give
to Chia, and it was always just as much as he actually required, neither
more nor less; and if ever the latter asked for more Mr Chên would rally
him on the subject of avarice. Finally Chia determined to <span
id="page_383">p. 383</span> try to get possession of this stone; and one
day, when Mr Chên was sleeping off the fumes of a drinking-bout, he
tried to extract it from his clothes. However, Chên detected him at
once, and declared that they could be friends no more, and next day he
left the place altogether. About a year afterward Chia was one day
wandering by the river-bank, when he saw a handsome-looking stone,
marvellously like that in the possession of Mr Chên; and he picked it up
at once and carried it home with him. A few days passed away, and
suddenly Mr Chên presented himself at Chia’s house, and explained that
the stone in question possessed the property of changing anything into
gold, and had been bestowed upon him long before by a certain Taoist
priest whom he had followed as a disciple. “Alas!” added he, “I got
tipsy and lost it; but divination told me where it was, and if you will
now restore it to me I will take care to repay your kindness.” “You have
divined rightly,” replied Chia; “the stone is with me; but recollect, if
you please, that the indigent Kuan Chung  <span
id="fr_44"></span>[10](#fn_44.md) shared the wealth of his friend Pao Shu.”
At this hint Mr Chên said he would give Chia one hundred ounces of
silver; to which the latter replied that one hundred ounces was a fair
offer, but that he would far sooner have Mr Chên teach him the formula
to utter when rubbing the stone on anything, so that he might try the
thing once himself. Mr Chên was afraid to do this; whereupon Chia cried
out, “You are an Immortal yourself; you must know well enough that I
would never deceive a friend.” So Mr Chên was prevailed upon to teach
him the formula, and then Chia would have tried the art upon the immense
stone <span id="page_384">p. 384</span> washing-block  <span
id="fr_45"></span>[11](#fn_45.md) which was lying near at hand had not Mr
Chên seized his arm and begged him not to do anything so outrageous.
Chia then picked up half a brick and laid it on the washing-block,
saying to Mr Chên, “This little piece is not too much, surely?”
Accordingly Mr Chên relaxed his hold and let Chia proceed; which he did
by promptly ignoring the half-brick and quickly rubbing the stone on the
washing-block. Mr Chên turned pale when he saw him do this, and made a
dash forward to get hold of the stone, but it was too late; the
washing-block was already a solid mass of silver, and Chia quietly
handed him back the stone. “Alas! alas!” cried Mr Chên in despair, “what
is to be done now? For, having thus irregularly conferred wealth upon a
mortal, Heaven will surely punish me. Oh, if you would save me, give
away one hundred coffins  <span id="fr_46"></span>[12](#fn_46.md) and one
hundred suits of wadded clothes.” “My friend,” replied Chia, “my object
in getting money was not to hoard it up like a miser.” Mr Chên was
delighted at this; and during the next three years Chia engaged in
trade, taking care to fulfil always his promise to Mr Chên. At the
expiration of that time Mr Chên himself reappeared, and, grasping Chia’s
hand, said to him, “Trustworthy and noble friend, when we last parted
the Spirit of Happiness impeached me before God,  <span
id="fr_47"></span>[13](#fn_47.md) and my name was erased from the list of
<span id="page_385">p. 385</span> angels. But now that you have carried
out my request that sentence has been rescinded. Go on as you have
begun, without ceasing.” Chia asked Mr Chên what office he filled in
Heaven; to which the latter replied that he was only a fox who, by a
sinless life, had finally attained to that clear perception of the truth
which leads to immortality. Wine was then brought, and the two friends
enjoyed themselves together as of old; and even when Chia had passed the
age of ninety years the fox still used to visit him from time to time.
