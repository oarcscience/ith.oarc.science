*Mais cet Orient, cette Asie, quelles en sont, enfin, les frontières
réelles?... Ces frontières sont d’une netteté qui ne permet aucune
erreur. L’Asie est là où cesse la vulgarité, où naît la dignité, et où
commence l’élégance intellectuelle. Et l’Orient est là où sont les
sources débordantes de poésie.*

## Chapter I

# The Sociology of the Chinese

## Racial Origin

In spite of much research and conjecture, the origin of the Chinese
people remains undetermined. We do not know who they were nor whence
they came. Such evidence as there is points to their immigration from
elsewhere; the Chinese themselves have a tradition of a Western origin.
The first picture we have of their actual history shows us, not a people
behaving as if long settled in a land which was their home and that of
their forefathers, but an alien race fighting with wild beasts, clearing
dense forests, and driving back the aboriginal inhabitants.

Setting aside several theories (including the one that the Chinese are
autochthonous and their civilization indigenous) now regarded by the
best authorities as untenable, the researches of sinologists seem to
indicate an origin (1) in early Akkadia; or (2) in Khotan, the Tarim
valley (generally what is now known as Eastern Turkestan), or the
K’un-lun Mountains (concerning which more presently). The second
hypothesis may relate only to a sojourn of longer or shorter duration on
the way from Akkadia to the ultimate settlement in China, especially
since the Khotan civilization has been shown to have been imported from
the Punjab in the third century B.C. The fact that serious mistakes have
been made regarding the identifications of early Chinese rulers with
Babylonian kings, and of the Chinese *po-hsing* (Cantonese *bak-sing*)
‘people’ with the Bak Sing or Bak tribes, does not exclude the
possibility of an Akkadian origin. But in either case the immigration
into China was probably <span id="page_14">p. 14</span> gradual, and may
have taken the route from Western or Central Asia direct to the banks of
the Yellow River, or may possibly have followed that to the south-east
through Burma and then to the north-east through what is now China—the
settlement of the latter country having thus spread from south-west to
north-east, or in a north-easterly direction along the Yangtzŭ River,
and so north, instead of, as is generally supposed, from north to south.

## Southern Origin Improbable

But this latter route would present many difficulties; it would seem to
have been put forward merely as ancillary to the theory that the Chinese
originated in the Indo-Chinese peninsula. This theory is based upon the
assumptions that the ancient Chinese ideograms include representations
of tropical animals and plants; that the oldest and purest forms of the
language are found in the south; and that the Chinese and the
Indo-Chinese groups of languages are both tonal. But all of these facts
or alleged facts are as easily or better accounted for by the
supposition that the Chinese arrived from the north or north-west in
successive waves of migration, the later arrivals pushing the earlier
farther and farther toward the south, so that the oldest and purest
forms of Chinese would be found just where they are, the tonal languages
of the Indo-Chinese peninsula being in that case regarded as the
languages of the vanguard of the migration. Also, the ideograms referred
to represent animals and plants of the temperate zone rather than of the
tropics, but even if it could be shown, which it cannot, that these
animals and plants now belong exclusively to the tropics, that would be
no proof of the tropical origin of the Chinese, for in the earliest
times the climate of North China was <span id="page_15">p.
15</span> much milder than it is now, and animals such as tigers and
elephants existed in the dense jungles which are later found only in
more southern latitudes.

## Expansion of Races from North to South

The theory of a southern origin (to which a further serious objection
will be stated presently) implies a gradual infiltration of Chinese
immigrants through South or Mid-China (as above indicated) toward the
north, but there is little doubt that the movement of the races has been
from north to south and not *vice versa*. In what are now the provinces
of Western Kansu and Ssŭch’uan there lived a people related to the
Chinese (as proved by the study of Indo-Chinese comparative philology)
who moved into the present territory of Tibet and are known as Tibetans;
in what is now the province of Yünnan were the Shan or Ai-lao (modern
Laos), who, forced by Mongol invasions, emigrated to the peninsula in
the south and became the Siamese; and in Indo-China, not related to the
Chinese, were the Annamese, Khmer, Mon, Khasi, Colarains (whose remnants
are dispersed over the hill tracts of Central India), and other tribes,
extending in prehistoric times into Southern China, but subsequently
driven back by the expansion of the Chinese in that direction.

## Arrival of the Chinese in China

Taking into consideration all the existing evidence, the objections to
all other theories of the origin of the Chinese seem to be greater than
any yet raised to the theory that immigrants from the Tarim valley or
beyond (*i.e.* from Elam or Akkadia, either direct or *via* Eastern
Turkestan) struck the banks of the Yellow River in their eastward
journey and followed its course until they <span id="page_16">p.
16</span> reached the localities where we first find them settled,
namely, in the region covered by parts of the three modern provinces of
Shansi, Shensi, and Honan where their frontiers join. They were then
(about 2500 or 3000 B.C.) in a relatively advanced state of
civilization. The country east and south of this district was inhabited
by aboriginal tribes, with whom the Chinese fought, as they did with the
wild animals and the dense vegetation, but with whom they also
commingled and intermarried, and among whom they planted colonies as
centres from which to spread their civilization.

## The K’un-lun Mountains

With reference to the K’un-lun Mountains, designated in Chinese
mythology as the abode of the gods—the ancestors of the Chinese race—it
should be noted that these are identified not with the range dividing
Tibet from Chinese Turkestan, but with the Hindu Kush. That brings us
somewhat nearer to Babylon, and the apparent convergence of the two
theories, the Central Asian and the Western Asian, would seem to point
to a possible solution of the problem. Nü Kua, one of the alleged
creators of human beings, and Nü and Kua, the first two human beings
(according to a variation of the legend), are placed in the K’un-lun
Mountains. That looks hopeful. Unfortunately, the K’un-lun legend is
proved to be of Taoist origin. K’un-lun is the central mountain of the
world, and 3000 miles in height. There is the fountain of immortality,
and thence flow the four great rivers of the world. In other words, it
is the Sumêru of Hindu mythology transplanted into Chinese legend, and
for our present purpose without historical value. <span id="page_17">p.
17</span>

It would take up too much space to go into details of this interesting
problem of the origin of the Chinese and their civilization, the
cultural connexions or similarities of China and Western Asia in
pre-Babylonian times, the origin of the two distinct culture-areas so
marked throughout the greater part of Chinese history, etc., and it will
be sufficient for our present purpose to state the conclusion to which
the evidence points.

## Provisional Conclusion

Pending the discovery of decisive evidence, the following provisional
conclusion has much to recommend it—namely, that the ancestors of the
Chinese people came from the west, from Akkadia or Elam, or from Khotan,
or (more probably) from Akkadia or Elam *via* Khotan, as one nomad or
pastoral tribe or group of nomad or pastoral tribes, or as successive
waves of immigrants, reached what is now China Proper at its north-west
corner, settled round the elbow of the Yellow River, spread
north-eastward, eastward, and southward, conquering, absorbing, or
pushing before them the aborigines into what is now South and South-west
China. These aboriginal races, who represent a wave or waves of
neolithic immigrants from Western Asia earlier than the relatively
high-headed immigrants into North China (who arrived about the
twenty-fifth or twenty-fourth century B.C.), and who have left so deep
an impress on the Japanese, mixed and intermarried with the Chinese in
the south, eventually producing the pronounced differences, in physical,
mental, and emotional traits, in sentiments, ideas, languages,
processes, and products, from the Northern Chinese which are so
conspicuous at the present day. <span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

## Inorganic Environment

At the beginning of their known history the country occupied by the
Chinese was the comparatively small region above mentioned. It was then
a tract of an irregular oblong shape, lying between latitude 34° and 40°
N. and longitude 107° and 114° E. This territory round the elbow of the
Yellow River had an area of about 50,000 square miles, and was gradually
extended to the sea-coast on the north-east as far as longitude 119°,
when its area was about doubled. It had a population of perhaps a
million, increasing with the expansion to two millions. This may be
called infant China. Its period (the Feudal Period) was in the two
thousand years between the twenty-fourth and third centuries B.C. During
the first centuries of the Monarchical Period, which lasted from 221
B.C. to A.D. 1912, it had expanded to the south to such an extent that
it included all of the Eighteen Provinces constituting what is known as
China Proper of modern times, with the exception of a portion of the
west of Kansu and the greater portions of Ssŭch’uan and Yünnan. At the
time of the Manchu conquest at the beginning of the seventeenth century
A.D. it embraced all the territory lying between latitude 18° and 40° N.
and longitude 98° and 122° E. (the Eighteen Provinces or China Proper),
with the addition of the vast outlying territories of Manchuria,
Mongolia, Ili, Koko-nor, Tibet, and Corea, with suzerainty over Burma
and Annam—an area of more than 5,000,000 square miles, including the
2,000,000 square miles covered by the Eighteen Provinces. Generally,
this territory is mountainous in the west, sloping gradually down toward
the sea on the east. It contains three chief ranges of mountains and
large alluvial plains in the north, east, and south. Three great <span
id="page_19">p. 19</span> and about thirty large rivers intersect the
country, their numerous tributaries reaching every part of it.

As regards geological features, the great alluvial plains rest upon
granite, new red sandstone, or limestone. In the north is found the
peculiar loess formation, having its origin probably in the accumulated
dust of ages blown from the Mongolian plateau. The passage from north to
south is generally from the older to the newer rocks; from east to west
a similar series is found, with some volcanic features in the west and
south. Coal and iron are the chief minerals, gold, silver, copper, lead,
tin, jade, etc., being also mined.

The climate of this vast area is not uniform. In the north the winter is
long and rigorous, the summer hot and dry, with a short rainy season in
July and August; in the south the summer is long, hot, and moist, the
winter short. The mean temperature is 50.3° F. and 70° F. in the north
and south respectively. Generally, the thermometer is low for the
latitude, though perhaps it is more correct to say that the Gulf Stream
raises the temperature of the west coast of Europe above the average.
The mean rainfall in the north is 16, in the south 70 inches, with
variations in other parts. Typhoons blow in the south between July and
October.

## Organic Environment

The vegetal productions are abundant and most varied. The rice-zone
(significant in relation to the cultural distinctions above noted)
embraces the southern half of the country. Tea, first cultivated for its
infusion in A.D. 350, is grown in the southern and central provinces
between the twenty-third and thirty-fifth degrees of latitude, though it
is also found as far north as Shantung, the chief ‘tea <span
id="page_20">p. 20</span> district,’ however, being the large area south
of the Yangtzŭ River, east of the Tungting Lake and great Siang River,
and north of the Kuangtung Province. The other chief vegetal products
are wheat, barley, maize, millet, the bean, yam, sweet and common
potato, tomato, eggplant, ginseng, cabbage, bamboo, indigo, pepper,
tobacco, camphor, tallow, ground-nut, poppy, water-melon, sugar, cotton,
hemp, and silk. Among the fruits grown are the date, mulberry, orange,
lemon, pumelo, persimmon, lichi, pomegranate, pineapple, fig, coconut,
mango, and banana, besides the usual kinds common in Western countries.

The wild animals include the tiger, panther, leopard, bear, sable,
otter, monkey, wolf, fox, twenty-seven or more species of ruminants, and
numerous species of rodents. The rhinoceros, elephant, and tapir still
exist in Yünnan. The domestic animals include the camel and the
water-buffalo. There are about 700 species of birds, and innumerable
species of fishes and insects.

## Sociological Environment

On their arrival in what is now known as China the Chinese, as already
noted, fought with the aboriginal tribes. The latter were exterminated,
absorbed, or driven south with the spread of Chinese rule. The Chinese
“picked out the eyes of the land,” and consequently the non-Chinese
tribes now live in the unhealthy forests or marshes of the south, or in
mountain regions difficult of access, some even in trees (a voluntary,
not compulsory promotion), though several, such as the Dog Jung in
Fukien, retain settlements like islands among the ruling race.

In the third century B.C. began the hostile relations of <span
id="page_21">p. 21</span> the Chinese with the northern nomads, which
continued throughout the greater part of their history. During the first
six centuries A.D. there was intercourse with Rome, Parthia, Turkey,
Mesopotamia, Ceylon, India, and Indo-China, and in the seventh century
with the Arabs. Europe was brought within the sociological environment
by Christian travellers. From the tenth to the thirteenth century the
north was occupied by Kitans and Nüchêns, and the whole Empire was under
Mongol sway for eighty-eight years in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries. Relations of a commercial and religious nature were held with
neighbours during the following four hundred years. Regular diplomatic
intercourse with Western nations was established as a result of a series
of wars in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Until recently the
nation held aloof from alliances and was generally averse to foreign
intercourse. From 1537 onward, as a sequel of war or treaty,
concessions, settlements, etc., were obtained by foreign Powers. China
has now lost some of her border countries and large adjacent islands,
the military and commercial pressure of Western nations and Japan having
taken the place of the military pressure of the Tartars already referred
to. The great problem for her, an agricultural nation, is how to find
means and the military spirit to maintain her integrity, the further
violation of which could not but be regarded by the student of
sociological history as a great tragedy and a world-wide calamity.

## Physical, Emotional, and Intellectual Characters

The physical characters of the Chinese are too well known to need
detailed recital. The original immigrants into North China all belonged
to blond races, but the <span id="page_22">p. 22</span> modern Chinese
have little left of the immigrant stock. The oblique, almond-shaped
eyes, with black iris and the orbits far apart, have a vertical fold of
skin over the inner canthus, concealing a part of the iris, a
peculiarity distinguishing the eastern races of Asia from all other
families of man. The stature and weight of brain are generally below the
average. The hair is black, coarse, and cylindrical; the beard scanty or
absent. The colour of the skin is darker in the south than in the north.

Emotionally the Chinese are sober, industrious, of remarkable endurance,
grateful, courteous, and ceremonious, with a high sense of mercantile
honour, but timorous, cruel, unsympathetic, mendacious, and libidinous.

Intellectually they were until recently, and to a large extent still
are, non-progressive, in bondage to uniformity and mechanism in culture,
imitative, unimaginative, torpid, indirect, suspicious, and
superstitious.

The character is being modified by intercourse with other peoples of the
earth and by the strong force of physical, intellectual, and moral
education.

## Marriage in Early Times

Certain parts of the marriage ceremonial of China as now existing
indicate that the original form of marriage was by capture—of which,
indeed, there is evidence in the classical *Book of Odes*. But a regular
form of marriage (in reality a contract of sale) is shown to have
existed in the earliest historical times. The form was not monogamous,
though it seems soon to have assumed that of a qualified monogamy
consisting of one wife and one or more concubines, the number of the
latter being as a rule limited only by the means of the husband. The
higher the rank the larger was the number of concubines <span
id="page_23">p. 23</span> and handmaids in addition to the wife proper,
the palaces of the kings and princes containing several hundreds of
them. This form it has retained to the present day, though associations
now exist for the abolition of concubinage. In early times, as well as
throughout the whole of Chinese history, concubinage was in fact
universal, and there is some evidence also of polyandry (which, however,
cannot have prevailed to any great extent). The age for marriage was
twenty for the man and fifteen for the girl, celibacy after thirty and
twenty respectively being officially discouraged. In the province of
Shantung it was usual for the wives to be older than their husbands. The
parents’ consent to the betrothal was sought through the intervention of
a matchmaker, the proposal originating with the parents, and the wishes
of the future bride and bridegroom not being taken into consideration.
The conclusion of the marriage was the progress of the bride from the
house of her parents to that of the bridegroom, where after various
ceremonies she and he worshipped his ancestors together, the worship
amounting to little more than an announcement of the union to the
ancestral spirits. After a short sojourn with her husband the bride
revisited her parents, and the marriage was not considered as finally
consummated until after this visit had taken place.

The status of women was low, and the power of the husband great—so great
that he could kill his wife with impunity. Divorce was common, and all
in favour of the husband, who, while he could not be divorced by her,
could put his wife away for disobedience or even for loquaciousness. A
widower remarried immediately, but refusal to remarry by a widow was
esteemed an act of chastity. She often mutilated herself or even
committed <span id="page_24">p. 24</span> suicide to prevent remarriage,
and was posthumously honoured for doing so. Being her husband’s as much
in the Otherworld as in this, remarriage would partake of the character
of unchastity and insubordination; the argument, of course, not applying
to the case of the husband, who by remarriage simply adds another member
to his clan without infringing on anyone’s rights.

## Marriage in Monarchical and Republican Periods

The marital system of the early classical times, of which the above were
the essentials, changed but little during the long period of monarchical
rule lasting from 221 B.C. to A.D. 1912. The principal object, as
before, was to secure an heir to sacrifice to the spirits of deceased
progenitors. Marriage was not compulsory, but old bachelors and old
maids were very scarce. The concubines were subject to the wife, who was
considered to be the mother of their children as well as her own. Her
status, however, was not greatly superior. Implicit obedience was
exacted from her. She could not possess property, but could not be hired
out for prostitution. The latter vice was common, in spite of the early
age at which marriage took place and in spite of the system of
concubinage—which is after all but a legalized transfer of
prostitutional cohabitation to the domestic circle.

Since the establishment of the Republic in 1912 the ‘landslide’ in the
direction of Western progress has had its effect also on the domestic
institutions. But while the essentials of the marriage contract remain
practically the same as before, the most conspicuous changes have been
in the accompanying ceremonial—now sometimes quite foreign, but in a
very large, perhaps the greatest, number of cases that odious thing,
half foreign, half <span id="page_25">p. 25</span> Chinese; as, for
instance, when the procession, otherwise native, includes foreign
glass-panelled carriages, or the bridegroom wears a ‘bowler’ or top-hat
with his Chinese dress—and in the greater freedom allowed to women, who
are seen out of doors much more than formerly, sit at table with their
husbands, attend public functions and dinners, dress largely in foreign
fashion, and play tennis and other games, instead of being prisoners of
the ‘inner apartment’ and household drudges little better than slaves.

One unexpected result of this increased freedom is certainly remarkable,
and is one not likely to have been predicted by the most far-sighted
sociologist. Many of the ‘progressive’ Chinese, now that it is the
fashion for Chinese wives to be seen in public with their husbands,
finding the uneducated, *gauche*, small-footed household drudge unable
to compete with the smarter foreign-educated wives of their neighbours,
have actually repudiated them and taken unto themselves spouses whom
they can exhibit in public without ‘loss of face’! It is, however, only
fair to add that the total number of these cases, though by no means
inconsiderable, appears to be proportionately small.

## Parents and Children

As was the power of the husband over the wife, so was that of the father
over his children. Infanticide (due chiefly to poverty, and varying with
it) was frequent, especially in the case of female children, who were
but slightly esteemed; the practice prevailing extensively in three or
four provinces, less extensively in others, and being practically absent
in a large number. Beyond the fact that some penalties were enacted
against it by the Emperor Ch’ien Lung (A.D. 1736–96), and that by
statute <span id="page_26">p. 26</span> it was a capital offence to
murder children in order to use parts of their bodies for medicine, it
was not legally prohibited. When the abuse became too scandalous in any
district proclamations condemning it would be issued by the local
officials. A man might, by purchase and contract, adopt a person as son,
daughter, or grandchild, such person acquiring thereby all the rights of
a son or daughter. Descent, both of real and personal property, was to
all the sons of wives and concubines as joint heirs, irrespective of
seniority. Bastards received half shares. Estates were not divisible by
the children during the lifetime of their parents or grandparents.

The head of the family being but the life-renter of the family property,
bound by fixed rules, wills were superfluous, and were used only where
the customary respect for the parents gave them a voice in arranging the
details of the succession. For this purpose verbal or written
instructions were commonly given.

In the absence of the father, the male relatives of the same surname
assumed the guardianship of the young. The guardian exercised full
authority and enjoyed the surplus revenues of his ward’s estate, but
might not alienate the property.

There are many instances in Chinese history of extreme devotion of
children to parents taking the form of self-wounding and even of suicide
in the hope of curing parents’ illnesses or saving their lives.

## Political History

The country inhabited by the Chinese on their arrival from the West was,
as we saw, the district where the modern provinces of Shansi, Shensi,
and Honan join. This they extended in an easterly direction to the
shores <span id="page_27">p. 27</span> of the Gulf of Chihli—a stretch
of territory about 600 miles long by 300 broad. The population, as
already stated, was between one and two millions. During the first two
thousand years of their known history the boundaries of this region were
not greatly enlarged, but beyond the more or less undefined borderland
to the south were *chou* or colonies, nuclei of Chinese population,
which continually increased in size through conquest of the neighbouring
territory. In 221 B.C. all the feudal states into which this territory
had been parcelled out, and which fought with one another, were
subjugated and absorbed by the state of Ch’in, which in that year
instituted the monarchical form of government—the form which obtained in
China for the next twenty-one centuries.

Though the origin of the name ‘China’ has not yet been finally decided,
the best authorities regard it as derived from the name of this feudal
state of Ch’in.

Under this short-lived dynasty of Ch’in and the famous Han dynasty (221
B.C. to A.D. 221) which followed it, the Empire expanded until it
embraced almost all the territory now known as China Proper (the
Eighteen Provinces of Manchu times). To these were added in order
between 194 B.C. and A.D. 1414: Corea, Sinkiang (the New Territory or
Eastern Turkestan), Manchuria, Formosa, Tibet, and Mongolia—Formosa and
Corea being annexed by Japan in 1895 and 1910 respectively. Numerous
other extra-China countries and islands, acquired and lost during the
long course of Chinese history (at one time, from 73 to 48 B.C., “all
Asia from Japan to the Caspian Sea was tributary to the Middle Kingdom,”
*i.e.* China), it is not necessary to mention here. During the Southern
Sung dynasty (1127–1280) the Tartars owned the northern half of China,
as far <span id="page_28">p. 28</span> down as the Yangtzŭ River, and in
the Yüan dynasty (1280–1368) they conquered the whole country. During
the period 1644–1912 it was in the possession of the Manchus. At present
the five chief component peoples of China are represented in the striped
national flag (from the top downward) by red (Manchus), yellow
(Chinese), blue (Mongolians), white (Mohammedans), and black (Tibetans).
This flag was adopted on the establishment of the Republic in 1912, and
supplanted the triangular Dragon flag previously in use. By this time
the population—which had varied considerably at different periods owing
to war, famine, and pestilence—had increased to about 400,000,000.

## General Government

The general division of the nation was into the King and the People, The
former was regarded as appointed by the will of Heaven and as the parent
of the latter. Besides being king, he was also law-giver,
commander-in-chief of the armies, high priest, and master of ceremonies.
The people were divided into four classes: (1) *Shih*, Officers (later
Scholars), consisting of *Ch’ên*, Officials (a few of whom were
ennobled), and *Shên Shih*, Gentry; (2) *Nung*, Agriculturists; (3)
*Kung*, Artisans; and (4) *Shang*, Merchants.

For administrative purposes there were at the seat of central government
(which, first at P’ing-yang—in modern Shansi—was moved eleven times
during the Feudal Period, and was finally at Yin) ministers, or
ministers and a hierarchy of officials, the country being divided into
provinces, varying in number from nine in the earliest times to
thirty-six under the First Emperor, 221 B.C., and finally twenty-two at
the present day. At first these <span id="page_29">p.
29</span> provinces contained states, which were models of the central
state, the ruler’s ‘Middle Kingdom.’ The provincial administration was
in the hands of twelve Pastors or Lord-Lieutenants. They were the chiefs
of all the nobles in a province. Civil and military offices were not
differentiated. The feudal lords or princes of states often resided at
the king’s court, officers of that court being also sent forth as
princes of states. The king was the source of legislation and
administered justice. The princes in their several states had the power
of rewards and punishments. Revenue was derived from a tithe on the
land, from the income of artisans, merchants, fishermen, foresters, and
from the tribute brought by savage tribes.

The general structure and principles of this system of administration
remained the same, with few variations, down to the end of the
Monarchical Period in 1912. At the end of that period we find the
emperor still considered as of divine descent, still the head of the
civil, legislative, military, ecclesiastical, and ceremonial
administration, with the nation still divided into the same four
classes. The chief ministries at the capital, Peking, could in most
cases trace their descent from their prototypes of feudal times, and the
principal provincial administrative officials—the Governor-General or
Viceroy, governor, provincial treasurer, judge, etc.—had similarly a
pedigree running back to offices then existing—a continuous duration of
adherence to type which is probably unique.

Appointment to office was at first by selection, followed by an
examination to test proficiency; later was introduced the system of
public competitive literary examinations for office, fully organized in
the seventeenth century, and abolished in 1903, when official positions
were thrown open to the graduates of colleges established on a modern
basis. <span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

In 1912, on the overthrow of the Manchu monarchy, China became a
republic, with an elected President, and a Parliament consisting of a
Senate and House of Representatives. The various government departments
were reorganized on Western lines, and a large number of new offices
instituted. Up to the present year the Law of the Constitution, owing to
political dissension between the North and the South, has not been put
into force.

## Laws

Chinese law, like primitive law generally, was not instituted in order
to ensure justice between man and man; its object was to enforce
subordination of the ruled to the ruler. The laws were punitive and
vindictive rather than reformatory or remedial, criminal rather than
civil. Punishments were cruel: branding, cutting off the nose, the legs
at the knees, castration, and death, the latter not necessarily, or
indeed ordinarily, for taking life. They included in some cases
punishment of the family, the clan, and the neighbours of the offender.
The *lex talionis* was in full force.

Nevertheless, in spite of the harsh nature of the punishments, possibly
adapted, more or less, to a harsh state of society, though the “proper
end of punishments”—to “make an end of punishing”—was missed, the
Chinese evolved a series of excellent legal codes. This series began
with the revision of King Mu’s *Punishments* in 950 B.C., the first
regular code being issued in 650 B.C., and ended with the well-known *Ta
Ch’ing lü li* (*Laws and Statutes of the Great Ch’ing Dynasty*), issued
in A.D. 1647. Of these codes the great exemplar was the *Law Classic*
drawn up by Li K’uei (*Li K’uei fa ching*), a statesman in the service
of the first ruler of the Wei <span id="page_31">p. 31</span> State, in
the fourth century B.C. The *Ta Ch’ing lü li* has been highly praised by
competent judges. Originally it sanctioned only two kinds of punishment,
death and flogging, but others were in use, and the barbarous *ling
ch’ih*, ‘lingering death’ or ‘slicing to pieces,’ invented about A.D.
1000 and abolished in 1905, was inflicted for high treason, parricide,
on women who killed their husbands, and murderers of three persons of
one family. In fact, until some first-hand knowledge of Western systems
and procedure was obtained, the vindictive as opposed to the reformatory
idea of punishments continued to obtain in China down to quite recent
years, and has not yet entirely disappeared. Though the crueller forms
of punishment had been legally abolished, they continued to be used in
many parts. Having been joint judge at Chinese trials at which, in spite
of my protests, prisoners were hung up by their thumbs and made to kneel
on chains in order to extort confession (without which no accused person
could be punished), I can testify that the true meaning of the “proper
end of punishments” had no more entered into the Chinese mind at the
close of the monarchical *régime* than it had 4000 years before.

As a result of the reform movement into which China was forced as an
alternative to foreign domination toward the end of the Manchu Period,
but chiefly owing to the bait held out by Western Powers, that
extraterritoriality would be abolished when China had reformed her
judicial system, a new Provisional Criminal Code was published. It
substituted death by hanging or strangulation for decapitation, and
imprisonment for various lengths of time for bambooing. It was adopted
in large measure by the Republican *régime*, and is the chief legal
<span id="page_32">p. 32</span> instrument in use at the present time.
But close examination reveals the fact that it is almost an exact copy
of the Japanese penal code, which in turn was modelled upon that of
Germany. It is, in fact, a Western code imitated, and as it stands is
quite out of harmony with present conditions in China. It will have to
be modified and recast to be a suitable, just, and practicable national
legal instrument for the Chinese people. Moreover, it is frequently
overridden in a high-handed manner by the police, who often keep a
person acquitted by the Courts of Justice in custody until they have
‘squeezed’ him of all they can hope to get out of him. And it is
noteworthy that, though provision was made in the Draft Code for trial
by jury, this provision never went into effect; and the slavish
imitation of alien methods is shown by the curiously inconsistent reason
given—that “the fact that jury trials have been abolished in Japan is
indicative of the inadvisability of transplanting this Western
institution into China!”

## Local Government

The central administration being a far-flung network of officialdom,
there was hardly any room for local government apart from it. We find it
only in the village elder and those associated with him, who took up
what government was necessary where the jurisdiction of the unit of the
central administration—the district magistracy—ceased, or at least did
not concern itself in meddling much.

## Military System

The peace-loving agricultural settlers in early China had at first no
army. When occasion arose, all the <span id="page_33">p.
33</span> farmers exchanged their ploughshares for swords and bows and
arrows, and went forth to fight. In the intervals between the harvests,
when the fields were clear, they held manoeuvres and practised the arts
of warfare. The king, who had his Six Armies, under the Six High Nobles,
forming the royal military force, led the troops in person, accompanied
by the spirit-tablets of his ancestors and of the gods of the land and
grain. Chariots, drawn by four horses and containing soldiers armed with
spears and javelins and archers, were much in use. A thousand chariots
was the regular force. Warriors wore buskins on their legs, and were
sometimes gagged in order to prevent the alarm being given to the enemy.
In action the chariots occupied the centre, the bowmen the left, the
spearmen the right flank. Elephants were sometimes used in attack.
Spy-kites, signal-flags, hook-ladders, horns, cymbals, drums, and
beacon-fires were in use. The ears of the vanquished were taken to the
king, quarter being rarely if ever given.

After the establishment of absolute monarchical government standing
armies became the rule. Military science was taught, and soldiers
sometimes trained for seven years. Chariots with upper storeys or
spy-towers were used for fighting in narrow defiles, and hollow squares
were formed of mixed chariots, infantry, and dragoons. The weakness of
disunion of forces was well understood. In the sixth century A.D. the
massed troops numbered about a million and a quarter. In A.D. 627 there
was an efficient standing army of 900,000 men, the term of service being
from the ages of twenty to sixty. During the Mongol dynasty (1280–1368)
there was a navy of 5000 ships manned by 70,000 trained fighters. The
Mongols completely revolutionized tactics and improved <span
id="page_34">p. 34</span> on all the military knowledge of the time. In
1614 the Manchu ‘Eight Banners,’ composed of Manchus, Mongolians, and
Chinese, were instituted. The provincial forces, designated the Army of
the Green Standard, were divided into land forces and marine forces,
superseded on active service by ‘braves’ (*yung*), or irregulars,
enlisted and discharged according to circumstances. After the war with
Japan in 1894 reforms were seriously undertaken, with the result that
the army has now been modernized in dress, weapons, tactics, etc., and
is by no means a negligible quantity in the world’s fighting forces. A
modern navy is also being acquired by building and purchase. For many
centuries the soldier, being, like the priest, unproductive, was
regarded with disdain, and now that his indispensableness for defensive
purposes is recognized he has to fight not only any actual enemy who may
attack him, but those far subtler forces from over the sea which seem
likely to obtain supremacy in his military councils, if not actual
control of his whole military system. It is, in my view, the duty of
Western nations to take steps before it is too late to avert this great
disaster.

## Ecclesiastical Institutions

The dancing and chanting exorcists called *wu* were the first Chinese
priests, with temples containing gods worshipped and sacrificed to, but
there was no special sacerdotal class. Worship of Heaven could only be
performed by the king or emperor. Ecclesiastical and political functions
were not completely separated. The king was *pontifex maximus*, the
nobles, statesmen, and civil and military officers acted as priests, the
ranks being similar to those of the political hierarchy. Worship took
place in the ‘Hall of Light,’ which was also a palace and <span
id="page_35">p. 35</span> audience and council chamber. Sacrifices were
offered to Heaven, the hills and rivers, ancestors, and all the spirits.
Dancing held a conspicuous place in worship. Idols are spoken of in the
earliest times.

Of course, each religion, as it formed itself out of the original
ancestor-worship, had its own sacred places, functionaries, observances,
ceremonial. Thus, at the State worship of Heaven, Nature, etc., there
were the ‘Great,’ ‘Medium,’ and ‘Inferior’ sacrifices, consisting of
animals, silk, grain, jade, etc. Panegyrics were sung, and robes of
appropriate colour worn. In spring, summer, autumn, and winter there
were the seasonal sacrifices at the appropriate altars. Taoism and
Buddhism had their temples, monasteries, priests, sacrifices, and
ritual; and there were village and wayside temples and shrines to
ancestors, the gods of thunder, rain, wind, grain, agriculture, and many
others. Now encouraged, now tolerated, now persecuted, the
ecclesiastical *personnel* and structure of Taoism and Buddhism survived
into modern times, when we find complete schemes of ecclesiastical
gradations of rank and authority grafted upon these two priestly
hierarchies, and their temples, priests, etc., fulfilling generally,
with worship of ancestors, State or official (Confucianism) and private
or unofficial, and the observance of various annual festivals, such as
‘All Souls’ Day’ for wandering and hungry ghosts, the spiritual needs of
the people as the ‘Three Religions’ (*San Chiao*). The emperor, as high
priest, took the responsibility for calamities, etc., making confession
to Heaven and praying that as a punishment the evil be diverted from the
people to his own person. Statesmen, nobles, and officials discharged,
as already noted, priestly functions in connexion with the State
religion in addition to their ordinary <span id="page_36">p.
36</span> duties. As a rule, priests proper, frowned upon as
non-producers, were recruited from the lower classes, were celibate,
unintellectual, idle, and immoral. There was nothing, even in the
elaborate ceremonies on special occasions in the Buddhist temples, which
could be likened to what is known as ‘public worship’ and ‘common
prayer’ in the West. Worship had for its sole object either the
attainment of some good or the prevention of some evil.

Generally this represents the state of things under the Republican
*régime*; the chief differences being greater neglect of ecclesiastical
matters and the conversion of a large number of temples into schools.

## Professional Institutions

We read of physicians, blind musicians, poets, teachers, prayer-makers,
architects, scribes, painters, diviners, ceremonialists, orators, and
others during the Feudal Period, These professions were of
ecclesiastical origin, not yet completely differentiated from the
‘Church,’ and both in earlier and later times not always or often
differentiated from each other. Thus the historiographers combined the
duties of statesmen, scholars, authors, and generals. The professions of
authors and teachers, musicians and poets, were united in one person.
And so it continued to the present day. Priests discharge medical
functions, poets still sing their verses. But experienced medical
specialists, though few, are to be found, as well as women doctors;
there are veterinary surgeons, musicians (chiefly belonging to the
poorest classes and often blind), actors, teachers, attorneys, diviners,
artists, letter-writers, and many others, men of letters being perhaps
the most prominent and most esteemed. <span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

## Accessory Institutions

A system of schools, academies, colleges, and universities obtained in
villages, districts, departments, and principalities. The instruction
was divided into ‘Primary Learning’ and ‘Great Learning.’ There were
special schools of dancing and music. Libraries and almshouses for old
men are mentioned. Associations of scholars for literary purposes seem
to have been numerous.

Whatever form and direction education might have taken, it became
stereotyped at an early age by the road to office being made to lead
through a knowledge of the classical writings of the ancient sages. It
became not only ‘the thing’ to be well versed in the sayings of
Confucius, Mencius; etc., and to be able to compose good essays on them
containing not a single wrongly written character, but useless for
aspirants to office—who constituted practically the whole of the
literary class—to acquire any other knowledge. So obsessed was the
national mind by this literary mania that even infants’ spines were made
to bend so as to produce when adult the ‘scholarly stoop.’ And from the
fact that besides the scholar class the rest of the community consisted
of agriculturists, artisans, and merchants, whose knowledge was that of
their fathers and grandfathers, inculcated in the sons and grandsons as
it had been in them, showing them how to carry on in the same groove the
calling to which Fate had assigned them, a departure from which would
have been considered ‘unfilial’—unless, of course (as it very rarely
did), it went the length of attaining through study of the classics a
place in the official class, and thus shedding eternal lustre on the
family—it will readily be seen that there was nothing to cause education
to be concerned with any but one or two of the subjects <span
id="page_38">p. 38</span> which are included by Western peoples under
that designation. It became at an early age, and remained for many
centuries, a rote-learning of the elementary text-books, followed by a
similar acquisition by heart of the texts of the works of Confucius and
other classical writers. And so it remained until the abolition, in
1905, of the old competitive examination system, and the substitution of
all that is included in the term ‘modern education’ at schools,
colleges, and universities all over the country, in which there is
rapidly growing up a force that is regenerating the Chinese people, and
will make itself felt throughout the whole world.

It is this keen and shrewd appreciation of the learned, and this lust
for knowledge, which, barring the tragedy of foreign domination, will
make China, in the truest and best sense of the word, a great nation,
where, as in the United States of America, the rigid class status and
undervaluation, if not disdaining, of knowledge which are proving so
disastrous in England and other European countries will be avoided, and
the aristocracy of learning established in its place.

Besides educational institutions, we find institutions for poor relief,
hospitals, foundling hospitals, orphan asylums, banking, insurance, and
loan associations, travellers’ clubs, mercantile corporations,
anti-opium societies, co-operative burial societies, as well as many
others, some imitated from Western models.

## Bodily Mutilations

Compared with the practices found to exist among most primitive races,
the mutilations the Chinese were in the habit of inflicting were but
few. They flattened the skulls of their babies by means of stones, so as
to <span id="page_39">p. 39</span> cause them to taper at the top, and
we have already seen what they did to their spines; also the mutilations
in warfare, and the punishments inflicted both within and without the
law; and how filial children and loyal wives mutilated themselves for
the sake of their parents and to prevent remarriage. Eunuchs, of course,
existed in great numbers. People bit, cut, or marked their arms to
pledge oaths. But the practices which are more peculiarly associated
with the Chinese are the compressing of women’s feet and the wearing of
the queue, misnamed ‘pigtail.’ The former is known to have been in force
about A.D. 934, though it may have been introduced as early as 583. It
did not, however, become firmly established for more than a century.
This ‘extremely painful mutilation,’ begun in infancy, illustrates the
tyranny of fashion, for it is supposed to have arisen in the imitation
by the women generally of the small feet of an imperial concubine
admired by one of the emperors from ten to fifteen centuries ago (the
books differ as to his identity). The second was a badge of servitude
inflicted by the Manchus on the Chinese when they conquered China at the
beginning of the seventeenth century. Discountenanced by governmental
edicts, both of these practices are now tending toward extinction,
though, of course, compressed feet and ‘pigtails’ are still to be seen
in every town and village. Legally, the queue was abolished when the
Chinese rid themselves of the Manchu yoke in 1912.

## Funeral Rites

Not understanding the real nature of death, the Chinese believed it was
merely a state of suspended animation, in which the soul had failed to
return to the body, though <span id="page_40">p. 40</span> it might yet
do so, even after long intervals. Consequently they delayed burial, and
fed the corpse, and went on to the house-tops and called aloud to the
spirit to return. When at length they were convinced that the absent
spirit could not be induced to re-enter the body, they placed the latter
in a coffin and buried it—providing it, however, with all that it had
found necessary in this life (food, clothing, wives, servants, etc.),
which it would require also in the next (in their view rather a
continuation of the present existence than the beginning of
another)—and, having inducted or persuaded the spirit to enter the
‘soul-tablet’ which accompanied the funeral procession (which took place
the moment the tablet was ‘dotted,’ *i.e.* when the character *wang*,
‘prince,’ was changed into *chu*, ‘lord’), carried it back home again,
set it up in a shrine in the main hall, and fell down and worshipped it.
Thus was the spirit propitiated, and as long as occasional offerings
were not overlooked the power for evil possessed by it would not be
exerted against the surviving inmates of the house, whom it had so
thoughtlessly deserted.

The latter mourned by screaming, wailing, stamping their feet, and
beating their breasts, renouncing (in the earliest times) even their
clothes, dwelling, and belongings to the dead, removing to
mourning-sheds of clay, fasting, or eating only rice gruel, sleeping on
straw with a clod for a pillow, and speaking only on subjects of death
and burial. Office and public duties were resigned, and marriage, music,
and separation from the clan prohibited.

During the lapse of the long ages of monarchical rule funeral rites
became more elaborate and magnificent, but, though less rigid and
ceremonious since the institution of <span id="page_41">p. 41</span> the
Republic, they have retained their essential character down to the
present day.

Funeral ceremonial was more exacting than that connected with most other
observances, including those of marriage. Invitations or notifications
were sent to friends, and after receipt of these *fu*, on the various
days appointed therein, the guest was obliged to send presents, such as
money, paper horses, slaves, etc., and go and join in the lamentations
of the hired mourners and attend at the prayers recited by the priests.
Funeral etiquette could not be *pu’d, i.e.* made good, if overlooked or
neglected at the right time, as it could in the case of the marriage
ceremonial.

Instead of symmetrical public graveyards, as in the West, the Chinese
cemeteries belong to the family or clan of the deceased, and are
generally beautiful and peaceful places planted with trees and
surrounded by artistic walls enclosing the grave-mounds and monumental
tablets. The cemeteries themselves are the metonyms of the villages, and
the graves of the houses. In the north especially the grave is very
often surmounted by a huge marble tortoise bearing the inscribed tablet,
or what we call the gravestone, on its back. The tombs of the last two
lines of emperors, the Ming and the Manchu, are magnificent structures,
spread over enormous areas, and always artistically situated on
hillsides facing natural or artificial lakes or seas. Contrary to the
practice in Egypt, with the two exceptions above mentioned the
conquering dynasties have always destroyed the tombs of their
predecessors. But for this savage vandalism, China would probably
possess the most magnificent assembly of imperial tombs in the world’s
records. <span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

## Laws of Intercourse

Throughout the whole course of their existence as a social aggregate the
Chinese have pushed ceremonial observances to an extreme limit.
“Ceremonies,” says the *Li chi*, the great classic of ceremonial usages,
“are the greatest of all things by which men live.” Ranks were
distinguished by different headdresses, garments, badges, weapons,
writing-tablets, number of attendants, carriages, horses, height of
walls, etc. Daily as well as official life was regulated by minute
observances. There were written codes embracing almost every attitude
and act of inferiors toward superiors, of superiors toward inferiors,
and of equals toward equals. Visits, forms of address, and giving of
presents had each their set of formulae, known and observed by every one
as strictly and regularly as each child in China learned by heart and
repeated aloud the three-word sentences of the elementary *Trimetrical
Classic*. But while the school text-book was extremely simple,
ceremonial observances were extremely elaborate. A Chinese was in this
respect as much a slave to the living as in his funeral rites he was a
slave to the dead. Only now, in the rush of ‘modern progress,’ is the
doffing of the hat taking the place of the ‘kowtow’ (*k’o-t’ou*).

It is in this matter of ceremonial observances that the East and the
West have misunderstood each other perhaps more than in all others.
Where rules of etiquette are not only different, but are diametrically
opposed, there is every opportunity for misunderstanding, if not
estrangement. The points at issue in such questions as ‘kowtowing’ to
the emperor and the worshipping of ancestors are generally known, but
the Westerner, as a rule, is ignorant of the fact that if he wishes to
conform <span id="page_43">p. 43</span> to Chinese etiquette when in
China (instead of to those Western customs which are in many cases
unfortunately taking their place) he should not, for instance, take off
his hat when entering a house or a temple, should not shake hands with
his host, nor, if he wishes to express approval, should he clap his
hands. Clapping of hands in China (*i.e.* non-Europeanized China) is
used to drive away the *sha ch’i*, or deathly influence of evil spirits,
and to clap the hands at the close of the remarks of a Chinese host (as
I have seen prominent, well-meaning, but ill-guided men of the West do)
is equivalent to disapproval, if not insult. Had our diplomatists been
sociologists instead of only commercial agents, more than one war might
have been avoided.

## Habits and Customs

At intervals during the year the Chinese make holiday. Their public
festivals begin with the celebration of the advent of the new year. They
let off innumerable firecrackers, and make much merriment in their
homes, drinking and feasting, and visiting their friends for several
days. Accounts are squared, houses cleaned, fresh paper ‘door-gods’
pasted on the front doors, strips of red paper with characters implying
happiness, wealth, good fortune, longevity, etc., stuck on the doorposts
or the lintel, tables, etc., covered with red cloth, and flowers and
decorations displayed everywhere. Business is suspended, and the
merriment, dressing in new clothes, feasting, visiting, offerings to
gods and ancestors, and idling continue pretty consistently during the
first half of the first moon, the vacation ending with the Feast of
Lanterns, which occupies the last three days. It originated in the Han
dynasty 2000 years ago. Innumerable <span id="page_44">p.
44</span> lanterns of all sizes, shapes, colours (except wholly white,
or rather undyed material, the colour of mourning), and designs are lit
in front of public and private buildings, but the use of these was an
addition about 800 years later, *i.e.* about 1200 years ago. Paper
dragons, hundreds of yards long, are moved along the streets at a slow
pace, supported on the heads of men whose legs only are visible, giving
the impression of huge serpents winding through the thoroughfares.

Of the other chief festivals, about eight in number (not counting the
festivals of the four seasons with their equinoxes and solstices), four
are specially concerned with the propitiation of the spirits—namely, the
Earlier Spirit Festival (fifteenth day of second moon), the Festival of
the Tombs (about the third day of the third moon), when graves are put
in order and special offerings made to the dead, the Middle Spirit
Festival (fifteenth day of seventh moon), and the Later Spirit Festival
(fifteenth day of tenth moon). The Dragon-boat Festival (fifth day of
fifth moon) is said to have originated as a commemoration of the death
of the poet Ch’ü Yüan, who drowned himself in disgust at the official
intrigue and corruption of which he was the victim, but the object is
the procuring of sufficient rain to ensure a good harvest. It is
celebrated by racing with long narrow boats shaped to represent dragons
and propelled by scores of rowers, pasting of charms on the doors of
dwellings, and eating a special kind of rice-cake, with a liquor as a
beverage.

<span id="img_p044"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![The Spirit That
Clears the Way](tn/p044.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/p044.jpg.md)  
The Spirit That Clears the Way  
</span>

The fifteenth day of the eighth moon is the Mid-autumn Festival, known
by foreigners as All Souls’ Day. On this occasion the women worship the
moon, offering cakes, fruit, etc. The gates of Purgatory are opened, and
the <span id="page_45">p. 45</span> hungry ghosts troop forth to enjoy
themselves for a month on the good things provided for them by the
pious. The ninth day of the ninth moon is the Chung Yang Festival, when
every one who possibly can ascends to a high place—a hill or
temple-tower. This inaugurates the kite-flying season, and is supposed
to promote longevity. During that season, which lasts several months,
the Chinese people the sky with dragons, centipedes, frogs, butterflies,
and hundreds of other cleverly devised creatures, which, by means of
simple mechanisms worked by the wind, roll their eyes, make appropriate
sounds, and move their paws, wings, tails, etc., in a most realistic
manner. The festival originated in a warning received by a scholar named
Huan Ching from his master Fei Ch’ang-fang, a native of Ju-nan in Honan,
who lived during the Han dynasty, that a terrible calamity was about to
happen, and enjoining him to escape with his family to a high place. On
his return he found all his domestic animals dead, and was told that
they had died instead of himself and his relatives. On New Year’s Eve
(*Tuan Nien* or *Chu Hsi*) the Kitchen-god ascends to Heaven to make his
annual report, the wise feasting him with honey and other sticky food
before his departure, so that his lips may be sealed and he be unable to
‘let on’ too much to the powers that be in the regions above!

## Sports and Games

The first sports of the Chinese were festival gatherings for purposes of
archery, to which succeeded exercises partaking of a military character.
Hunting was a favourite amusement. They played games of calculation,
chess (or the ‘game of war’), shuttlecock with the feet, pitch-pot
(throwing arrows from a distance into a narrow-necked <span
id="page_46">p. 46</span> jar), and ‘horn-goring’ (fighting on the
shoulders of others with horned masks on their heads). Stilts, football,
dice-throwing, boat-racing, dog-racing, cock-fighting, kite-flying, as
well as singing and dancing marionettes, afforded recreation and
amusement.

Many of these games became obsolete in course of time, and new ones were
invented. At the end of the Monarchical Period, during the Manchu
dynasty, we find those most in use to be foot-shuttlecock, lifting of
beams headed with heavy stones—dumb-bells four feet long and weighing
thirty or forty pounds—kite-flying, quail-fighting, cricket-fighting,
sending birds after seeds thrown into the air, sauntering through
fields, playing chess or ‘morra,’ or gambling with cards, dice, or over
the cricket- and quail-fights or seed-catching birds. There were
numerous and varied children’s games tending to develop strength, skill,
quickness of action, parental instinct, accuracy, and sagacity.
Theatricals were performed by strolling troupes on stages erected
opposite temples, though permanent theatres also existed, female parts
until recently being taken by male actors. Peep-shows, conjurers,
ventriloquists, acrobats, fortune-tellers, and story-tellers kept crowds
amused or interested. Generally, ‘young China’ of the present day,
identified with the party of progress, seems to have adopted most of the
outdoor but very few of the indoor games of Western nations.

## Domestic Life

In domestic or private life, observances at birth, betrothal, and
marriage were elaborate, and retained superstitious elements. Early
rising was general. Shaving of the head and beard, as well as cleaning
of the ears and massage, was done by barbers. There were public baths
<span id="page_47">p. 47</span> in all cities and towns. Shops were
closed at nightfall, and, the streets being until recent times ill-lit
or unlit, passengers or their attendants carried lanterns. Most houses,
except the poorest, had private watchmen. Generally two meals a day were
taken. Dinners to friends were served at inns or restaurants,
accompanied or followed by musical or theatrical performances. The place
of honour is stated in Western books on China to be on the left, but the
fact is that the place of honour is the one which shows the utmost
solicitude for the safety of the guest. It is therefore not necessarily
one fixed place, but would usually be the one facing the door, so that
the guest might be in a position to see an enemy enter, and take
measures accordingly.

Lap-dogs and cage-birds were kept as pets; ‘wonks,’ the *huang kou*, or
‘yellow dog,’ were guards of houses and street scavengers. Aquaria with
goldfish were often to be seen in the houses of the upper and middle
classes, the gardens and courtyards of which usually contained rockeries
and artistic shrubs and flowers.

Whiskers were never worn, and moustaches and beards only after forty,
before which age the hair grew, if at all, very scantily. Full, thick
beards, as in the West, were practically never seen, even on the aged.
Snuff-bottles, tobacco-pipes, and fans were carried by both sexes. Nails
were worn long by members of the literary and leisured classes.
Non-Manchu women and girls had cramped feet, and both Manchu and Chinese
women used cosmetics freely.

## Industrial Institutions

While the men attended to farm-work, women took care of the
mulberry-orchards and silkworms, and did <span id="page_48">p.
48</span> spinning, weaving, and embroidery. This, the primitive
division of labour, held throughout, though added to on both sides, so
that eventually the men did most of the agriculture, arts, production,
distribution, fighting, etc., and the women, besides the duties above
named and some field-labour, mended old clothes, drilled and sharpened
needles, pasted tin-foil, made shoes, and gathered and sorted the leaves
of the tea-plant. In course of time trades became highly
specialized—their number being legion—and localized, bankers, for
instance, congregating in Shansi, carpenters in Chi Chou, and
porcelain-manufacturers in Jao Chou, in Kiangsi.

As to land, it became at an early age the property of the sovereign, who
farmed it out to his relatives or favourites. It was arranged on the
*ching*, or ‘well’ system—eight private squares round a ninth public
square cultivated by the eight farmer families in common for the benefit
of the State. From the beginning to the end of the Monarchical Period
tenure continued to be of the Crown, land being unallodial, and mostly
held in clans or families, and not entailed, the conditions of tenure
being payment of an annual tax, a fee for alienation, and money
compensation for personal services to the Government, generally
incorporated into the direct tax as scutage. Slavery, unknown in the
earliest times, existed as a recognized institution during the whole of
the Monarchical Period.

Production was chiefly confined to human and animal labour, machinery
being only now in use on a large scale. Internal distribution was
carried on from numerous centres and at fairs, shops, markets, etc. With
few exceptions, the great trade-routes by land and sea have remained the
same during the last two thousand years. <span id="page_49">p.
49</span> Foreign trade was with Western Asia, Greece, Rome, Carthage,
Arabia, etc., and from the seventeenth century A.D. more generally with
European countries. The usual primitive means of conveyance, such as
human beings, animals, carts, boats, etc., were partly displaced by
steam-vessels from 1861 onward.

Exchange was effected by barter, cowries of different values being the
prototype of coins, which were cast in greater or less quantity under
each reign. But until within recent years there was only one coin, the
copper cash, in use, bullion and paper notes being the other media of
exchange. Silver Mexican dollars and subsidiary coins came into use with
the advent of foreign commerce. Weights and measures (which generally
decreased from north to south), officially arranged partly on the
decimal system, were discarded by the people in ordinary commercial
transactions for the more convenient duodecimal subdivision.

## Arts

Hunting, fishing, cooking, weaving, dyeing, carpentry, metallurgy,
glass-, brick-, and paper-making, printing, and book-binding were in a
more or less primitive stage, the mechanical arts showing much servile
imitation and simplicity in design; but pottery, carving, and
lacquer-work were in an exceptionally high state of development, the
articles produced being surpassed in quality and beauty by no others in
the world.

## Agriculture and Rearing of Livestock

From the earliest times the greater portion of the available land was
under cultivation. Except when the country has been devastated by war,
the Chinese have devoted <span id="page_50">p. 50</span> close attention
to the cultivation of the soil continuously for forty centuries. Even
the hills are terraced for extra growing-room. But poverty and
governmental inaction caused much to lie idle. There were two annual
crops in the north, and five in two years in the south. Perhaps
two-thirds of the population cultivated the soil. The methods, however,
remained primitive; but the great fertility of the soil and the great
industry of the farmer, with generous but careful use of fertilizers,
enabled the vast territory to support an enormous population. Rice,
wheat, barley, buckwheat, maize, kaoliang, several millets, and oats
were the chief grains cultivated. Beans, peas, oil-bearing seeds
(sesame, rape, etc.), fibre-plants (hemp, ramie, jute, cotton, etc.),
starch-roots (taros, yams, sweet potatoes, etc.), tobacco, indigo, tea,
sugar, fruits, were among the more important crops produced.
Fruit-growing, however, lacked scientific method. The rotation of crops
was not a usual practice, but grafting, pruning, dwarfing, enlarging,
selecting, and varying species were well understood. Vegetable-culture
had reached a high state of perfection, the smallest patches of land
being made to bring forth abundantly. This is the more creditable
inasmuch as most small farmers could not afford to purchase expensive
foreign machinery, which, in many cases, would be too large or
complicated for their purposes.

The principal animals, birds, etc., reared were the pig, ass, horse,
mule, cow, sheep, goat, buffalo, yak, fowl, duck, goose, pigeon,
silkworm, and bee.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the successor to the Board of
Agriculture, Manufactures, and Commerce, instituted during recent years,
is now adapting Western methods to the cultivation of the fertile soil
of <span id="page_51">p. 51</span> China, and even greater results than
in the past may be expected in the future.

## Sentiments and Moral Ideas

The Chinese have always shown a keen delight in the beautiful—in
flowers, music, poetry, literature, embroidery, paintings, porcelain.
They cultivated ornamental plants, almost every house, as we saw, having
its garden, large or small, and tables were often decorated with flowers
in vases or ornamental wire baskets or fruits or sweetmeats. Confucius
made music an instrument of government. Paper bearing the written
character was so respected that it might not be thrown on the ground or
trodden on. Delight was always shown in beautiful scenery or tales of
the marvellous. Commanding or agreeable situations were chosen for
temples. But until within the last few years streets and houses were
generally unclean, and decency in public frequently absent.

Morality was favoured by public opinion, but in spite of early marriages
and concubinage there was much laxity. Cruelty both to human beings and
animals has always been a marked trait in the Chinese character.
Savagery in warfare, cannibalism, luxury, drunkenness, and corruption
prevailed in the earliest times. The attitude toward women was despotic.
But moral principles pervaded the classical writings, and formed the
basis of law. In spite of these, the inferior sentiment of revenge was,
as we have seen, approved and preached as a sacred duty. As a result of
the universal *yin-yang* dualistic doctrines, immorality was leniently
regarded. In modern times, at least, mercantile honour was high, “a
merchant’s word is as good as his bond” being truer in China than in
many <span id="page_52">p. 52</span> other countries. Intemperance was
rare. Opium-smoking was much indulged in until the use of the drug was
forcibly suppressed (1906–16). Even now much is smuggled into the
country, or its growth overlooked by bribed officials. Clan quarrels and
fights were common, vendettas sometimes continuing for generations.
Suicide under depressing circumstances was approved and honoured; it was
frequently resorted to under the sting of great injustice. There was a
deep reverence for parents and superiors. Disregard of the truth, when
useful, was universal, and unattended by a sense of shame, even on
detection. Thieving was common. The illegal exactions of rulers were
burdensome. In times of prosperity pride and satisfaction in material
matters was not concealed, and was often short-sighted. Politeness was
practically universal, though said to be often superficial; but
gratitude was a marked characteristic, and was heartfelt. Mutual
conjugal affection was strong. The love of gambling was universal.

But little has occurred in recent years to modify the above characters.
Nevertheless the inferior traits are certainly being changed by
education and by the formation of societies whose members bind
themselves against immorality, concubinage, gambling, drinking, smoking,
etc.

## Religious Ideas

Chinese religion is inherently an attitude toward the spirits or gods
with the object of obtaining a benefit or averting a calamity. We shall
deal with it more fully in another chapter. Suffice it to say here that
it originated in ancestor-worship, and that the greater part of it
remains ancestor-worship to the present day. The State religion, which
was Confucianism, was ancestor-worship. Taoism, <span id="page_53">p.
53</span> originally a philosophy, became a worship of spirits—of the
souls of dead men supposed to have taken up their abode in animals,
reptiles, insects, trees, stones, etc.—borrowed the cloak of religion
from Buddhism, which eventually outshone it, and degenerated into a
system of exorcism and magic. Buddhism, a religion originating in India,
in which Buddha, once a man, is worshipped, in which no beings are known
with greater power than can be attained to by man, and according to
which at death the soul migrates into anything from a deified human
being to an elephant, a bird, a plant, a wall, a broom, or any piece of
inorganic matter, was imported ready made into China and took the side
of popular superstition and Taoism against the orthodox belief, finding
that its power lay in the influence on the popular mind of its doctrine
respecting a future state, in contrast to the indifference of
Confucianism. Its pleading for compassion and preservation of life met a
crying need, and but for it the state of things in this respect would be
worse than it is.

Religion, apart from ancestor-worship, does not enter largely into
Chinese life. There is none of the real ‘love of God’ found, for
example, in the fervent as distinguished from the conventional
Christian. And as ancestor-worship gradually loses its hold and dies out
agnosticism will take its place.

## Superstitions

An almost infinite variety of superstitious practices, due to the belief
in the good or evil influences of departed spirits, exists in all parts
of China. Days are lucky or unlucky. Eclipses are due to a dragon trying
to eat the sun or the moon. The rainbow is supposed to be the result of
a meeting between the impure vapours of the <span id="page_54">p.
54</span> sun and the earth. Amulets are worn, and charms hung up,
sprigs of artemisia or of peach-blossom are placed near beds and over
lintels respectively, children and adults are ‘locked to life’ by means
of locks on chains or cords worn round the neck, old brass mirrors are
supposed to cure insanity, figures of gourds, tigers’ claws, or the
unicorn are worn to ensure good fortune or ward off sickness, fire,
etc., spells of many kinds, composed mostly of the written characters
for happiness and longevity, are worn, or written on paper, cloth,
leaves, etc., and burned, the ashes being made into a decoction and
drunk by the young or sick.

Divination by means of the divining stalks (the divining plant, milfoil
or yarrow) and the tortoiseshell has been carried on from time
immemorial, but was not originally practised with the object of
ascertaining future events, but in order to decide doubts, much as lots
are drawn or a coin tossed in the West. *Fêng-shui*, “the art of
adapting the residence of the living and the dead so as to co-operate
and harmonize with the local currents of the cosmic breath” (the *yin*
and the *yang*: see Chapter III), a doctrine which had its root in
ancestor-worship, has exercised an enormous influence on Chinese thought
and life from the earliest times, and especially from those of Chu Hsi
and other philosophers of the Sung dynasty.

## Knowledge

Having noted that Chinese education was mainly literary, and why it was
so, it is easy to see that there would be little or no demand for the
kind of knowledge classified in the West under the head of science. In
so far as any demand existed, it did so, at any rate at first, only
because it subserved vital needs. Thus, astronomy, <span id="page_55">p.
55</span> or more properly astrology, was studied in order that the
calendar might be regulated, and so the routine of agriculture correctly
followed, for on that depended the people’s daily rice, or rather, in
the beginning, the various fruits and kinds of flesh which constituted
their means of sustentation before their now universal food was known.
In philosophy they have had two periods of great activity, the first
beginning with Lao Tzŭ and Confucius in the sixth century B.C. and
ending with the Burning of the Books by the First Emperor, Shih Huang
Ti, in 213 B.C.; the second beginning with Chou Tzŭ (A.D. 1017–73) and
ending with Chu Hsi (1130–1200). The department of philosophy in the
imperial library contained in 190 B.C. 2705 volumes by 137 authors.
There can be no doubt that this zeal for the orthodox learning, combined
with the literary test for office, was the reason why scientific
knowledge was prevented from developing; so much so, that after four
thousand or more years of national life we find, during the Manchu
Period, which ended the monarchical *régime*, few of the educated class,
giants though they were in knowledge of all departments of their
literature and history (the continuity of their traditions laid down in
their twenty-four Dynastic Annals has been described as one of the great
wonders of the world), with even the elementary scientific learning of a
schoolboy in the West. ‘Crude,’ ‘primitive,’ ‘mediocre,’ ‘vague,’
‘inaccurate,’ ‘want of analysis and generalization,’ are terms we find
applied to their knowledge of such leading sciences as geography,
mathematics, chemistry, botany, and geology. Their medicine was much
hampered by superstition, and perhaps more so by such beliefs as that
the seat of the intellect is in the stomach, that thoughts proceed from
the heart, that the pit of the stomach is the seat of <span
id="page_56">p. 56</span> the breath, that the soul resides in the
liver, etc.—the result partly of the idea that dissection of the body
would maim it permanently during its existence in the Otherworld. What
progress was made was due to European instruction; and this again is the
*causa causans* of the great wave of progress in scientific and
philosophical knowledge which is rolling over the whole country and will
have marked effects on the history of the world during the coming
century.

## Language

Originally polysyllabic, the Chinese language later assumed a
monosyllabic, isolating, uninflected form, grammatical relations being
indicated by position. From the earliest forms of speech several
subordinate vernacular languages arose in various districts, and from
these sprang local dialects, etc. Tone-distinctions arose—*i.e.* the
same words pronounced with a different intonation came to mean different
things. Development of these distinctions led to carelessness of
articulation, and multiplication of what would be homonyms but for these
tones. It is incorrect to assume that the tones were invented to
distinguish similar sounds. So that, at the present day, anyone who says
*ma* will mean either an exclamation, hemp, horse, or curse according to
the quality he gives to the sound. The language remains in a primitive
state, without inflexion, declension, or distinction of parts of speech.
The order in a sentence is: subject, verb, complement direct, complement
indirect. Gender is formed by distinctive particles; number by prefixing
numerals, etc.; cases by position or appropriate prepositions.
Adjectives precede nouns; position determines comparison; and absence of
punctuation causes ambiguity. The latter is <span id="page_57">p.
57</span> now introduced into most newly published works. The new
education is bringing with it innumerable words and phrases not found in
the old literature or dictionaries. Japanese idioms which are now being
imported into the language are making it less pure.

The written language, too well known to need detailed description, a
thing of beauty and a joy for ever to those able to appreciate it, said
to have taken originally the form of knotted cords and then of notches
on wood (though this was more probably the origin of numeration than of
writing proper), took later that of rude outlines of natural objects,
and then went on to the phonetic system, under which each character is
composed of two parts, the radical, indicating the meaning, and the
phonetic, indicating the sound. They were symbols, non-agglutinative and
non-inflexional, and were written in vertical columns, probably from
having in early times been painted or cut on strips of bark.

## Achievements of the Chinese

As the result of all this fitful fever during so many centuries, we find
that the Chinese, after having lived in nests “in order to avoid the
animals,” and then in caves, have built themselves houses and palaces
which are still made after the pattern of their prototype, with a flat
wall behind, the openings in front, the walls put in after the pillars
and roof-tree have been fixed, and out-buildings added on as side
extensions. The *k’ang*, or ‘stove-bed’ (now a platform made of bricks),
found all over the northern provinces, was a place scooped out of the
side of the cave, with an opening underneath in which (as now) a fire
was lit in winter. Windows and shutters opened upward, being a survival
of the mat or shade <span id="page_58">p. 58</span> hung in front of the
apertures in the walls of the primitive cave-dwelling. Four of these
buildings facing each other round a square made the courtyard, and one
or more courtyards made the compound. They have fed themselves on almost
everything edible to be found on, under, or above land or water, except
milk, but live chiefly on rice, chicken, fish, vegetables, including
garlic, and tea, though at one time they ate flesh and drank wine,
sometimes to excess, before tea was cultivated. They have clothed
themselves in skins and feathers, and then in silks and satins, but
mostly in cotton, and hardly ever in wool. Under the Manchu *régime* the
type of dress adopted was that of this horse-riding race, showing the
chief characteristics of that noble animal, the broad sleeves
representing the hoofs, the queue the mane, etc. This queue was formed
of the hair growing from the back part of the scalp, the front of which
was shaved. Unlike the Egyptians, they did not wear wigs. They have
nearly always had the decency to wear their coats long, and have
despised the Westerner for wearing his too short. They are now
paradoxical enough to make the mistake of adopting the Westerner’s
costume.

They have made to themselves great canals, bridges, aqueducts, and the
longest wall there has ever been on the face of the earth (which could
not be seen from the moon, as some sinologists have erroneously
supposed, any more than a hair, however long, could be seen at a
distance of a hundred yards). They have made long and wide roads, but
failed to keep them in repair during the last few centuries, though much
zeal, possibly due to commerce on oil- or electricity-driven wheels, is
now being shown in this direction. They have built honorary portals to
chaste widows, pagodas, and arched bridges of great <span
id="page_59">p. 59</span> beauty, not forgetting to surround each city
with a high and substantial wall to keep out unfriendly people. They
have made innumerable implements and weapons, from pens and fans and
chopsticks to ploughs and carts and ships; from fiery darts, ‘flame
elephants,’ bows and spears, spiked chariots, battering-rams, and
hurling-engines to mangonels, trebuchets, matchlocks of wrought iron and
plain bore with long barrels resting on a stock, and gingals fourteen
feet long resting on a tripod, cuirasses of quilted cotton cloth covered
with brass knobs, and helmets of iron or polished steel, sometimes
inlaid, with neck- and ear-lappets. And they have been content not to
improve upon these to any appreciable extent; but have lately shown a
tendency to make the later patterns imported from the West in their own
factories.

They have produced one of the greatest and most remarkable accumulations
of literature the world has ever seen, and the finest porcelain; some
music, not very fine; and some magnificent painting, though hardly any
sculpture, and little architecture that will live.
