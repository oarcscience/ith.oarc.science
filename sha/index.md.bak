------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section has texts about Shamanism and Animism. These are
traditional belief systems which consider the entire universe to be
alive and interconnected. Shamanism in practice is used to heal and
enlighten, using ceremonials which can include rhythmic music, mind
altering drugs and mythic journeys into the subconscious. There are also
numerous descriptions of Shamanism and related topics in the [Native
American](../nam/index), the [Traditional Asian](../asia/index.md),
[Australian](../aus/index), [Pacific](../pac/index.md), and
[African](../afr/index.md) sections.

*About the photo:* Ainu Bear-Festival. The matting wall is hung with
various implements and fetishes used at the festival. The men are eating
the flesh of the slain bear. They are supposed to be the guests of the
bear. See also [an episode from the Kalevala](../neu/kveng/kvrune46.md) for
a curious episode with a bear who gets invited to a feast....Perhaps the
book titled 'To Serve Bear' should have been a giveaway. (photo from
