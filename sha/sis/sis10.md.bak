# CHAPTER XIV

### SOME CEREMONIES

#### I. THE CHUKCHEE.

CHUKCHEE ceremonials have as the only object of their performance the
material welfare of the community, and incantations are the main
substance of their rites.

The Reindeer Chukchee's only regular ceremonials are those connected
with the herd; these they call 'sacrifices' or 'genuine sacrifices '.
'Strictly speaking,' says Bogoras, 'every slaughtering of reindeer is a
sacrifice and is performed according to certain rules. After the animal
is stabbed the Chukchee watch carefully to see on whieh side it falls.
To fall on the wounded side is a less favourable omen than to fall on
the other; and to fall backwards is still worse, and forebodes
misfortune.'\[1\]

Besides reindeer, dogs are also slaughtered, and sometimes substitute
sacrifices are offered, of reindeer made of willow-leaves or even of
snow. Most sacrifices are offered to the good spirits. Evil spirits are
also sacrificed to, but the offerings to these are made at midnight, in
darkness, and are never spoken of.\[2\]

The most regular sacrifices are the Autumn Slaughtering,\[3\] Winter
Slaughtering,\[4\] the Ceremonial of Antlers,\[5\] the Sacrifice to the
New Moon, the Sacrifice to the Fire, the Sacrifice for Luck in Hunting,"
and a ceremonial connected with the killing of wild reindeer bucks.\[7\]
Besides these seasonal ceremonials there is also a Thanksgiving
Ceremonial, which each family must perform once or twice a year, on
different occasions.\[8\]

Bogoras gives a summary account of the ceremonials of the Maritime
Chukchee as follows: 'The cycle of the ceremonials with the Maritime
Chukchee opens with two short ceremonials in the beginning of the
autumn, which are often joined together. One of them is a commemorative
sacrifice to the dead. The

other is a sacrifice to the sea, in order to ensure good fortune in
subsequent sealing on the sea-ice in winter.

'Late in the autumn, or rather in the beginning of the winter, the chief
ceremonial of the year is performed. It is consecrated to Keretkim, or
is made a thanksgiving ceremonial to the spirits of sea-mammals killed
since the fall. Early in spring there follows the ceremonial of boats,
which are made ready for the approaching season. In the middle of summer
the ceremonial of heads is performed. This is for thanksgiving to the
spirits of sea-animals killed since early in the spring.  
'These four ceremonials are performed with varying similarity by both
the Maritime Chukchee and the Asiatic Eskimo. To these must be added
some slight ceremonials effected while moving from the winter lodging to
the summer tent.

'Most of the Maritime Chukchee offer sacrifice also in midwinter to the
star Pehittin, and perform in the middle of spring a ceremonial
analogous to the ceremonial of antlers of the reindeer. breeders, which
is called by the same name, Kilvei. The sacrifice to the whale is
performed, in addition, each time after a whale has been killed or has
drifted ashore.

'Bloody and bloodless sacrifices are offered during these ceremonials.
The Maritime Chukchee, of course, can slaughter only dogs for their
bloody sacrifices. In comparison with the Koryak, however, they are
merciful to their dogs and kill them in no very great numbers. In this,
as in other respects, they occupy a middle ground between the American
Eskimo, who do not sacrifice dogs, and the Koryak, who often kill almost
all the animals of their single team.'\[1\]

The ceremonial dedicated to Keretkun,\[2\] the sea-god, is especially
important among the Maritime Chukchee. When the seal-gut overcoats for
the family (which are said to be similar to those worn by Keretkun and
his family), the ceremonial head-dresses and the incantation-paddle, on
which there are pictorial representations of prayers, are ready, a net
is suspended overhead, and various images of birds and small paddles are
hung from it. On each side of the hearth is placed a reindeer-skin, the
two skins representing the inner rooms of the house. Keretkun, who is
represented by a small wooden image, enters the house and is placed on a
lamp, which is put either on one of the skins or

\[1. Op. cit., pp. 385-6.

2\. Op. cit., pp. 892-401.\]

in a sleeping-room. Here he remains until the end of the ceremony. A
fire is made before him and kept burning throughout the three days of
the ceremonial. Among those people, like the Asiatic Eskimo, who have no
wood, a second lamp is kept burning before that on which Keretkun is
placed. Puddings made of various roots mixed with oil and liver are
sacrificed to the god. On the first day the household enjoys the
festival alone, singing and dancing and beating the drum.

'The second day belongs to the guests and particularly to the shamans,
who have to show, in turn, their skill in drumming and singing.'\[1\] It
is on this day that, in many villages, the so-called 'exchanging of
presents' takes place. Usually, the guests assemble at the entrance of
the sleeping-room, bringing various household articles, which they
thrust under the partition, loudly demanding what they wish in exchange.
The mistress takes whatever is offered and must give in exchange
whatever is demanded.

In some cases the exchange is made between relatives only, and
especially between those who are partners in the marriages called by
Bogoras 'group-marriage'. A man will send his wife to one of his
marriage-partners to ask for certain articles, and afterwards the donor
sends his wife to ask for an equivalent.

Another variety of ceremonial exchange, which also forms a part of the
second day's ceremonies, is what is called by Bogoras the
'trading-dance'.\[2\] It takes place between the members of a 'compound
marriage', beginning with a dance in which a male member of the group
has one of the women for his partner. 'Frequently the man looks on only,
while the woman dances before him. He must provide a reindeer-skin,
however, to spread on the ground under her feet while she is dancing.
While the dance is being Performed the other dancers remain quiet, and
look on together with the other spectators. After the dance, the man
must give some present to the woman; and the following night they sleep
together, leaving their respective mates to arrange matters between
themselves. On the next day the husband of the woman and the wife of the
man perform a similar dance, in which the man gives an equivalent of the
present of the day before, and each newly mated couple sleeps together
for another night. Such dances are

\[1 Ibid.

2 A special meaning of 'trade' in the U.S.A. is the exchange of
commodities in business; trading=bartering, swapping'.\]

arranged chiefly among cousins or other relatives, who, among the
Chukchee, frequently assume the bond of compound marriage. Conversely, a
new bond of compound marriage may be concluded through a trading-dance.'

The third day of the Keretkun ceremonial is the women's day. This time
it is they who act as drummers and dancers. 'A new\[1\] detail is that
of a night-watch, which must be kept for the sake of Keretkun, who is
supposed to stay in the house all the time, This watch is kept by an old
man or woman', who is often a shaman, invited specially for this
purpose. The shaman sits on  
a stool made of a whale's vertebra, and 'sings and beats the drum in a
subdued key, in order not to awaken the supernatural guest'. The keeper
of the watch on the last night must be a woman.

On the evening of the last day a reindeer is cooked, and the meat
distributed among the guests, who carry their shares home with them on
departing.

Finally, the image of Keretkun is burned over his lamp. Then all the
refuse of the sacrificed reindeer is gathered up and cast into the sea,
to symbolize the returning to the sea of all game killed since the last
ceremonial. This same symbolic act is performed at almost all of the
Maritime ceremonials.

#### II. THE KORYAK.

The Koryak offer sacrifices to their Supreme Being to secure prosperity
for the future. At these sacrifices, some blood from the wounds of the
victim, dog or reindeer, are sprinkled on the ground as an offering to
the *kala*, with the words: 'This blood is for thee, kala!'\[2\] Thus we
see that bloody sacrifices among these people are offered to malevolent
as well as to benevolent beings.

Besides occasional sacrifices, the Koryak have several sacrificial
ceremonies which are regular or seasonal, and all connected with the
cult of the animals on -which their livelihood depends. Thus the
Maritime Koryak worship sea-animals, and the Reindeer

\[1. Differing that is, from the custom of the Reindeer Chukchee, whose
procedure at the autumn ceremonial and the 'thanksgiving' is in most
other respects similar to that described here.

2\. Jochelson, The Koryak, p. 93. 'Otherwise the *kala* might intercept
the sacrifice and prevent its reaching the Supreme Being' (ibid.).\]

Koryak their herd. This is illustrated by the following list of
festivals:

Maritime Koryak:\[1\]  
1. Whale-festival.  
2. The putting away of the skin-boat for the winter.  
3. Launching the skin-boat.  
4. Wearing of masks.

Reindeer Koryak: \[2\]  
1. Ceremony on the return of the herd from summer pastures.  
2. The fawn-festival.

Ceremonies common to both: \[3\]  
1. Bear-festival.  
2. Wolf-festival.  
3. Practices in connexion with fox-hunting.

Jochelson's description\[4\] of the wolf-festival is here quoted as
being typical of the ritual practices common to both Reindeer and
Maritime Koryak:

'After having killed a wolf, the Maritime Koryak take off its skin,
together with the head, just as they proceed with the bear; then they
place near the hearth a pointed stick, and tie an arrow, called *ilhun*
or *elgoi*, to it, or drive an arrow into the ground at its butt end.
One of the men puts on the wolf-skin and walks around the hearth, while
another member of the family beats the drum. The wolf-festival is called
*elhogicnin*, i. e. 'wolf-stick festival'.

'The meaning of this ceremony is obscure. I have been unable to get any
explanation from the Koryak with reference to it. "Our forefathers did
this way", is all they say. I have found no direct indications of the
existence of totemism among the Koryak; but the wearing of the skin of
the wolf and of the bear during these festivals may be compared to
certain features of totemistic festivals, in which some members of the
family or clan represent the totem by putting on its skin.

'The wolf-festival differs from the bear-festival in the absence of the
equipment for the home journey.' The reason is this, that

\[1. Jochelson, op. cit., p. 65.

2\. Op. cit., pp. 86-7.

3\. Op. cit., pp. 88-90.

4 op. Cit., pp. 89-90.

5\. The essential part of the whale-festival is based on the conception
that the whale killed has come on a visit to the village; . . . that it
will return to the sea to repeat its visit the following year'; and
that, if hospitably received, it will bring its relatives with it when
it comes again. Hence it is symbolically equipped with grass travelling
bags filled with puddings for its return to the sea. (Op. cit., pp. 66,
74, 76'.) A similar procedure is followed at the bear festival. (Op.
cit., p. 89.)\]

the bear is sent home with much ceremony, to secure successful
bear-hunting in the future, bear's meat being considered a delicacy,
while the festival serves at the same time to protect the people from
the wrath of the slain animal and its relatives. The wolf, on the other
band, does not serve as food, but is only a danger to the traveller in
the desert. He is dangerous, not in his visible, animal state-for the
northern wolves, as a rule, are afraid of men -but in his invisible,
anthropomorphic form. According to the Koryak conception, the wolf is a
rich reindeer-owner and the powerful master of the tundra . . . \[and\]
avenges \[himself\] particularly on those that hunt \[wolves\].' The
Reindeer Koryak, who have special reason to fear the wolf on account of
their berds, regard this animal as a powerful shaman and an evil spirit.

'After having killed a wolf, the Reindeer Koryak slaughter a reindeer,
cut off its head, and put its body, together with that of the killed
wolf, on a platform raised on posts. The reindeer-head is placed so as
to face eastward. It is a sacrifice to The-One-on-High, who is thus
asked not to permit the wolf to attack the herd. Special food is
prepared in the evening, and the wolf is fed. The night is spent without
sleep, in beating the drum, and dancing to entertain the wolf, lest his
relatives come and take revenge. Beating the drum and addressing
themselves to the wolf, the people say, "Be well!" (*Nimeleu
gatvanvota!*), and addressing The-One-on-High, they say, "Be good, do
not make the wolf bad!"'\[1\]

#### III. THE AINU.

Although the bear-festival is common to all the Palaeo-Siberians and is
celebrated also by some of the Neo-Siberians, it has reached its highest
development among the Ainu. We give here a short description of the
principal features of this festival, following Kharuzin's account.\[2\]

Towards the end of winter the Ainu catch a bear-cub and bring it into
the village, where it is reared and fed by a woman. When it is
sufficiently grown to break out of its wooden cage, which usually
happens some time in September or October, this marks

\[1. Op. cit., p. 89.

2\. N. Kharuzin, *Ethnography*, 1905, vol. iv, pp. 371-2. For a more
detailed description see B. Pilsudski's *Niedzwiedzie Swieto u Ainow*
(in *Sphinx*, Warsaw, 1905).\]

the time for the holding of the festival. Before the ceremonies,
apologies are made to the spirits for the capture and detention of the
bear, assurances are given that the treatment of the bear has been
marked with the greatest tenderness, and it is explained that, as they
cannot feed the animal any longer, they are obliged to kill it. The
person entrusted with the conduct of the festival invites all relations
and friends, usually practically the whole village. Before the
ceremonies are begun, libations are made to the family hearth-fire by
the host and all his guests. Sacrifices are made to the spirit-'owner'
of the dwelling in a corner of the house sacred to him. The woman who
has reared the bear weeps to show her sorrow at its approaching fate.
The company approach the cage of the bear, libations are made, and some
wine is given to the animal in a special cup. The women and girls dance
round the cage, clapping their hands and singing. Then the foster-mother
of the bear, and women who have reared other bears for former festivals,
perform a dance of their own before the cage, with tears in their eyes,
stretching out their hands towards the animal, and uttering endearing
words. After some other ritual observances, the bear is taken out of its
cage, a cord is fastened round its neck, and a stick is thrust down its
throat by the united force of several people, so that the animal is
choked to death. With much solemnity the body is laid out, -and
surrounded with various embellishments, which are more numerous and
elaborate if the animal is a female. Food and drink are offered to the
spirit of the victim, and then follow much feasting and merriment, which
is intended to render the bear spirit joyous and gay. The body is flayed
and disembowelled, and the head cut off, the blood being collected in a
pot and drunk by the men only among the guests. The liver is also
consumed, and of this each woman and girl present receives a small
portion. The rest of the meal is preserved for the next day's feast, and
all the guests of both sexes partake of this.

#### IV. THE TURKIC TRIBES.

#### (1) THE YAKUT.

There are among the Yakut two kinds of sacrificial ceremonies -bloody
and bloodless. The former is that made to *abassylars*, the latter to
aïy and ichchi;\[1\] so that if one does not know beforehand

\[1. Sieroszewski (*12 Lat w Kraju Yakatów*, p. 389) says that to only
one *aïy*, Bay-Baynay, the god of hunting are bloody sacrifices
offered.\]

whether the sacrifice is being offered to black or to white spirits,
this can be ascertained from the nature of the ceremony. Although bloody
sacrifices are not made to Urun-Aïy-Toyon, yet it is customary to
dedicate certain animals to him, i. e. such animals are not to be used
for work, and mares so dedicated are not to be milked. Formerly it was
the custom to dedicate in this manner all mares which had foals: they
were let loose to wander on the steppes.

There are some *aïy*, which although they have this name, yet are of the
class of *abassy*.\[1\] Sacrifices of the choicest meat and drink are
made to them through the fire. The offerings to *abassylars* have the
character of a compromise or bargain. The evil spirit wishes to have the
*kut* (one of the souls) of a man, and the shaman gives instead the
*kut* of an animal.

There are two tribal festivals of the Yakut: a spring festival,
*aïy-ysyakh*, and an autumn festival, *abassy-ysyakh*. As the name
shows, the first is celebrated for the good spirits in general, and for
Urun-Aïy-Toyon in particular.\[2\] After the sacrifice, which is
followed by certain sports or games, a dramatic representation of the
struggle between spring and winter is given. One man, called the
*aïy-uola*, is dressed in white and mounted on a white horse to
represent the spring, while another, *abassy-uola*, represents winter by
being dressed in black or reddish garments and mounted on a horse of
corresponding colour.

The *abassy-ysgakh* is held in autumn, and in the open air like the
first festival, but at night. It is dedicated to the black spirits, and
especially to Ulu-Toyon. While the first festival is conducted by the
clan-father, the second is under the direction of nine shamans and nine
shamanesses.\[3\]

#### (2) THE ALTAIANS.

Sacrifice to Bai-Yulgen. The description of this ceremony, as given by
Mikhailowski,\[4\] is compiled from the works of the

\[1. Troshchanski, *The Evolution of the Black Faith*, 1902,p. 103.

2\. Op. cit., pp. 105-6.

Sieroszewaski (op. cit., p. 388) calls the highest good spirit, or god,
Art-Toyon-Aga (Uyun-Artoyen), which literally means
'Master-Father-Sovereign'. He lives in the ninth heaven, and is great
and powerful, but indifferent towards human affairs. The spring *ysyakh*
is primarily in his honour, says Sieroszewski, while Urun-Aïy-Toyon,
'White-Master-Creator', is next to him in dignity.

3\. Ibid.

4 Mikhailowski, Shamanism, pp. 63-7.\]

missionary Wierbicki and the well-known linguist and traveller, Radloff.
The ceremony lasts for two or three days, or rather, evenings, the first
evening being occupied by the preparatory ritual. A spot is chosen in a
thicket of birch-trees in a meadow, and there the *kam* (shaman) erects
a decorative *yurta*. In this is planted a young birch, crowned with a
flag, and having its lower branches lopped off, and nine notches cut in
its trunk to represent steps (*tapty*). The *yurta* is surrounded by a
penfold, and by the entramce to this is set a birch-stick with a noose
of horsehair. A holder of the head (*Bash-tutkan-kiski*) of the
sacrificial horse is chosen from among those present. The kam flourishes
a birch-twig over the horse to indicate that its soul is being driven to
Bai-Yulgen's abode, whither the soul of the *Bash-tutkan* accompanies
it. He then collects spirits in his tambourine, calling each one by
name, and answering for each as it arrives: 'I also am here, Kam!' As he
speaks he makes motions with his tambourine as if taking the spirits
into it. When he has secured his assistants, the *kam* goes out of the
*yurta*, mounts upon a scarecrow made to resemble a goose, and flapping
his arms as if they were wings, chants loudly and slowly:'

Beneath the white sky,  
Above the white cloud,  
Beneath the blue sky,  
Above the blue cloud,  
Skyward ascend, O bird!

The goose replies (through the shaman himself, of course) in a series of
quacks-'Ungaigak, ungaigak, kaigaigak gak, kaigai gak.' The *kam*, still
on his feathered steed, pursues the *pura* (soul) of the sacrificial
horse, neighing in imitation of the unwilling victim, until, with the
help of the spectators, he drives it into the penfold to the stick with
the horsehair noose, the guardian of the *pura*. After violent efforts,
to the accompaniment of neighings and other noises produced by the
shaman to imitate the struggles of the *pura*, the latter frees itself
and runs away. It is at last recaptured, and fumigated with juniper by
the shaman, who has now dismounted from his goose. Then the real
sacrificial horse is brought and blessed by the *kam*, who thereafter
kills it by opening the aorta. The bones and skin form the actual
sacrifice. The flesh is consumed by those present at the ceremony, the
choicest portion falling to the *kam*.

\[1. Op. cit., p. 63.\]

'The most important part of the performance takes place oil the second
day after sunset; it is then that the *kam* must display all his power
and all his dramatic art. A whole religious drama is performed,
descriptive of the *kam's* pilgrimage to Bai-Yulgen in heaven. A fire
burns in the *yurta*, the shaman feeds the lords of the tambourine, i.e.
the spirits personifying the shamanistic power of his family, with the
meat of the offering and sings:\[1\]

Accept this, O Kaira Khan!  
Master of the tambourine with six horns,  
Draw near with the sound of the bell!  
When I cry 'Chokk'! make obeisance!  
When I cry 'Mé'! accept this!

The 'owner' of the fire, representing the power of the family of the
master of the *yurta*, who has organized the festival, is addressed in a
similar invocation. Then the *kam* takes a cup and makes noises with his
lips to imitate the sounds of drinking made by an assemblage of
invisible guests. He distributes morsels of meat to the company, who
devour them as representatives of the unseen spirits. Nine garments, on
a rope decked with ribbons, the offering of the host to Yulgen, are
fumigated with juniper by the shaman, who sings:

Gifts that no horse can carry  
     Alás! Alás! Alás!  
Gifts that no man can lift  
     Alás! Alás! Alás!  
Garments with triple collar-  
Turn them thrice before thine eyes,  
Let them be a cover for the steed,  
     Alás! Alás! Alás!  
Prince Yulgen full of gladness!  
     Alás! Alás! Alás!

The *kam* next invokes many spirits, primary and secondary, having first
donned his shaman's garment, and fumigated his tambourine, which he
strikes to summon the spirits, answering for each, as it arrives, 'Here
am I, *kam*!' Merkyut, the Bird of Heaven, is invoked as follows:

Birds of Heaven, the five Merkyuts!  
Ye with mighty talons of brass,  
Of copper is the moon's claw,  
And of ice its beak;  
Mightily flap the spreading wings,  
Like to a fan is the long tail.  
The left wing veils the moon  
And the right obscures the sun,  
Thou, mother of nine eagles,  
Turning not aside, thou fliest over Yaik,  
Over Edil thou weariest not!  
Draw nigh with song!  
Lightly draw nigh to my right eye,  
Of my right shoulder make thou thy resting-place

\[1. Op. cit., p. 64.\]

The answering cry of the bird comes from the lips of the shaman: 'Kagak,
kak, kak! Kain, here I come!' The *kam* seems to bend beneath the weight
of the huge bird. His tambourine sounds louder and louder, and he
staggers under the burden of the vast number of spirit-protectors
collected in it. Having walked several times round the birch placed in
the *yurta*, the shaman kneels at the door and asks the porter-spirit
for a guide. His request granted, he comes out to the middle of the
*yurta*, and with convulsive movements of the upper part of his body and
inarticulate mutterings, beats violently upon the tambourine. Now he
purifies the host, hostess, their children, and relatives by embracing
them in such a way that the tambourine with the spirits collected in it
touches the breast and the drum-stick the back of each. This is done
after he has scraped from the back of the host with the drum-stick all
that is unclean, for the back is the seat of the soul. Thus all are
liberated from the malign influence of the wicked Erlik. Then the people
return to their places and the shaman 'drives all potential misfortunes
out of doors',\[1\] and, beating his tambourine close to the ear of his
host, drives into him the spirit and power of his ancestors that he may
understand the prophecies of the shaman. In pantomime he invests each
member of the family with breastplates and hats, and then falls into an
ecstasy. He beats his tambourine furiously, rushes about as if
possessed, and, after mounting the first step cut in the birch-trunk,
runs round the fire and the birch, imitating the sound of thunder. Next
he mounts a bench covered with a horse-cloth, which represents the
pitra, and cries: \[2\]

One step have I ascended,  
    Aikhai! Aikhai!  
One zone I have attained.  
    Shagarbata!  
To the topmost *tapty* \[the birch steps\] I have mounted.  
    Shagarbata!  
I have risen to the full moon.  
    Shagarbata!

\[1. Ibid.

2\. Op. cit, p. 65.\]

Hurrying on the *Bash-tutkan*, the *kam* passes from one zone of heaven
to another. The goose once more takes the place of the wearied *pura*,
affording temporary relief to the *Bash-tutkan*, who relates his woes
vicariously by means of the shaman. In the third zone a halt is made,
the shaman prophesies impending misfortunes, and declares what
sacrifices are to be offered by the district. If he foretells rainy
weather he sings:

Kara Shurlu of the six rods  
Drips on the low ground,  
No hoofed beast can protect itself,  
No creature with claws can uphold itself.

Similar prophecies may be made in other regions of the sky.

When the *Bash-tutkan* is rested the journey is continued, progress
being indicated by mounting one step higher on the birch for every new
zone attained. Variety is given to the performance by the introduction
of various episodes. 'In the sixth sphere of heaven takes place the last
episodical scene, and this has a comic tinge. The shaman sends his
servant Kuruldak to track and catch a hare that has hidden itself. For a
time the chase is unsuccessful, now personages are introduced, and one
of them, Kereldei, mocks Kuruldak, who, however, at last succeeds in
catching the hare.'\[1\]

Previously, in the fifth heaven, the *kam* has interviewed Yayuchi
('Supreme-Creator'), and learned many secrets of the future, some of
which he communicates aloud. In the sixth heaven he makes obeisance to
the moon, and in the seventh to the sun, for these heavens are the
abodes of these luminaries. Only a few shamans are powerful enough to
mount beyond the ninth heaven. Having reached the highest zone
attainable by his powers, the *kam* drops his tambourine, and beating
gently with the drum-stick, makes a humble petition to Yulgen:

Lord, to whom three stairways lead,  
Bai-Yulgen, possessor of three flocks,  
The blue vault which has appeared,  
The blue sky that shows itself,  
The blue cloud that whirls along,  
The blue sky so hard to reach,  
Land a year's journey distant from water,  
Father Yulgen thrice exalted,  
Shunned by the edge of the moon's axe,  
Thou who usest the hoof of the horse  
O Yulgen, thou hast created all men  
Who are stirring round about us.  
Thou, Yulgen, hast bestowed all cattle upon us,  
Let us not fall into sorrow!  
Grant that we may withstand the evil one!  
Let us not behold Kermes \[the evil spirit that attends man\],  
Deliver us not into his hands!  
Thou who a thousand thousand times  
The starry shy hast turned,  
Condemn me not for sin!

\[1. Op. cit., p. 65

2\. Op. cit., p. 66.\]

'From Yulgen the shaman learns whether the sacrifice is accepted or not,
and receives the most authentic information concerning the wealth and
the character of the coming harvest; he also finds out what sacrifices
are expected by the deity. On such an occasion the shaman designates the
neighbour who is bound to furnish a sacrifice, and even describes the
colour and appearance of the animal. After his conversation with Yulgen,
the ecstasy of the shaman reaches its highest point, and he falls down
completely exhausted. Then the Bash-tutkan goes up to him, and takes the
tambourine and drum-stick out of his bands. After a short time, during
which quiet reigns in the *yurta*, the shaman seems to awake, rubs his
eyes, stretches himself, wrings out the perspiration from his shirt, and
salutes all those present as if after a long absence.'\[1\]

This sometimes concludes the festival, but more often, especially among
the wealthy, a third day is spent in feasting and libations to the
gods\[2\]

#### V. THE MONGOLIC TRIBES.

Sacrifices among the Mongols are either: (a) regular or public
(*tailgan*), or (b) occasional or private (*kirik*).

Banzaroff says that Georgi, as long ago as the latter part of the
eighteenth century, observed three regular sacrificial ceremonies among
the Mongols: the spring, summer, and autumn festivals. Banzaroffs traces
the origin of these festivals to a period long

antedating the Christian era. The festival which has been best described
in recent times is that called *urus-sara* ('the month of sara'), which
is intended to celebrate and symbolize the renewing of all things. When
the earth is green again, the flocks increase, and milk is abundant, the
Kalmuk make sacrifice of all these gifts in the form of *kumys*, herbs,
and horses. The sacrificial horses are tied to a rope, which is
stretched between two poles. A man on horseback, accompanied by another
riding a colt, passes along the row of victims, pours over them *kumys*,
and fastens to their manes pieces of pink cloth. Then the sacrifice is
offered.\[1\]

The autumn festival of the Mongols, like the *urus-sara*, is very
ancient. Banzaroff finds mention of it in writers of pre-Christian
times, and in the Middle Ages it is referred to by Marco Polo, who says
it was celebrated on August 28th. This ceremony is known as *sagan-sara*
('white month'), and the Mongols used to date their New Year from the
time of its celebration. The majority of these people nowadays celebrate
the beginning of the year in winter, but they, like the few who adhere
to the old date, still call the New Year and the festival which is held
then *sagan-sara*.\[2\]

An English traveller of the middle of the nineteenth century, who
witnessed the celebration of the spring festival in the valley of
Ichurish in the Altai, describes it as follows:

'In the spring the Kalmucks offer up sacrifices to their deity; the rich
give horses, those who are poor sacrifice sheep or goats. I was present
at one of the ceremonies. A ram was led up by the owner, who wished for
a large increase to his herds and flocks. It was handed to an assistant
of the priest, who killed it in the usual manner. His superior stood
near, looking to the east, and began chanting a prayer, and beating on
his large tambourine to rouse up his god, and then made his request for
multitudes of sheep and cattle. The ram was being flayed; and when the
operation was completed, the skin was put on a pole, raised above the,
framework, and placed with its head to the east. The tambourine
thundered forth its sound, and the performer continued his wild chant.
The flesh was cooked in a large cauldron, and the tribe held a great
festival.'\[3\]

mentions about thirty such, and says that these are by no means all, and
that years of further investigation would be necessary to render it
possible to give a complete list.

Among the Balagansk Buryat every male child must offer certain
sacrifices to the western *khats* to ensure their protection while the
children are still in infancy as well as during their future adult life.
These sacrifices, viz. (i) *morto-ulan-khurgan*, (ii)
*erkhindkhi-ulan-khurgan*, (iii) *Charga-tekhe*, (iv)
*yaman-khonin-khoer*, must, without fail, be offered by all boys, but
upon girls they are not obligatory. Besides these sacrifices there are
others which are made on behalf of all young children, irrespective of
their sex, to certain *zayans* and *zayanesses*, termed *ukhan-khata*.
These are called *ukhan-budla*, *oshkin-budla*. We shall quote here
Khangaloff's description of the ceremony *ukhan-budla*:

'Some time after having a child born to him, a Buryat, either fit the
instance of a shaman or on his own initiative, will make preparation for
the performance of the ceremony called *ukhan-budla*. A shaman is
invited to perform the ceremony. When the shaman appears, water is
brought from a spring, or sometimes from a lake or river. Before drawing
the water, some copper coins are dropped into the place from which it is
taken. A bundle of coarse grass of the steppes, another of rushes, and
nine silken threads are prepared. When everything is ready, the shaman
makes libation to the *zayans* and *zayanesses*, pronouncing the
following words:

The boys, like the rushes,  
The maids, like mushrooms;  
From the grass of the steppe  
They have made a scourge;  
With the water of the spring  
They have made *budla* (ablution);  
With the nine silken threads  
They have made a scourge.

After this the water is poured into a pot and heated. Then they put into
the pot the grass also, and a broom is made of the rushes. The child is
placed in a shallow vessel surrounded by nine stones, and the shaman
says: "The black stone is the door, the tawny stone is the courtyard."
He then takes the broom, dips it into the water, and striking the child
lightly with it, tells him tells him that he must not cry, but grow
quickly. Now nine knots are made in the nine threads, and they are
placed around the child's neck. The water is spilled on the floor of the
*yurta*, and the broom is placed over the door to prevent the entrance
of evil spirits. Thus ends the *ukhan-budla*.'\[1\]

As a rule Buryat ceremonies are performed by the shamans; but some of
the minor ones, such, for instance, as the 'feeding' of the *ongons*,
are conducted by the master of the house. Women's *ongons* are made and
fed by women. Frequently animals are dedicated to *ongons*, either for
some shorter or longer period or for life. Such an animal must not be
used for any heavy, work, and no married woman must touch it. The
Mongols call this custom *setertey*, which denotes both the dedication
and the taboo.\[2\]

Another case of the dedication of animals is that which is some times
practised with regard to a horse whose master has died. The animal is
taboo, and must not be used for heavy work. Under  
ordinary circumstances, when a Buryat dies, his horse is either killed
or set loose to wander at large upon the steppes.\[3\]
