# PART III. RELIGION

## CHAPTER VII

### SHAMANISM \[1\]

SHAMANISM is understood by some people to be a primitive form of
religion or religio-magic practised by the aborigines of northern Asia
as well as by all other aborigines in other parts of the world. This
opinion is held by Mikhailowski, Kharuzin, and some other Russian
scientists. Others hold that Shamanism was only one form of expression
of the religious cult of northern Asia, practised in order to avert the
evil spirits. This opinion is found in the writings of Jochelson and
Bogoras. There is still another view put forward, which it is well for
us to consider. This view we find expressed very clearly in the
following extract from Klementz:

'One must not lose sight of the fact that in the various beliefs of the
Siberian tribes a very close connexion is noticeable, and, likewise,
there can be observed an uninterrupted identity in the foundations of
their mythology, and in their rites, even extending as far as the
nomenclature-all of which gives one the right to suppose that these
beliefs are the result of the joint work of the intellectual activity of
the whole north of Asia.'\[2\]

In the writings of the Buryat scientist Banzaroff we find a very similar
statement: 'The old national religion of the Mongols and the
neighbouring nations is known in Europe as "Shamanism", whereas among
those who are not its followers it has no special name.

'After the introduction of Buddhism among the Mongolic nations, they
called their old religion "The Black Faith" (*Khara Shadjin*), in
contradistinction to Buddhism, which they called "Yellow Faith" (*Shira
Shadjin*). According to Father Jakiuv, the Chinese call Shamanism
*Tao-Shen* (gambolling before the spirits).

Those names, however, do not give any idea of the true character of
shamanism. Some are of opinion that it originated alongside with
Brahminism and Buddhism, while others find in it some elements in common
with the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Lao-Tze. . . . Finally
some hold that Shamanism is nothing but Nature-worship, likening it to
the faith of the followers of Zoroaster. Careful study of the subject
shows that the Shamanistic religion … did not arise out of Buddhism or
any other religion, but originated among the Mongolic nations, and
consists not only in superstitious and shamanistic ceremonies . . ., but
in a certain primitive way of observing the outer world-Nature-and the
inner world-the soul.'\[1\]

Of course, Banzaroff speaks especially of the Shamanism of the Mongols.
We cannot agree with him that Shamanism is limited to these people. We
find it all over northern and part of central Asia.

As we see them now the Palaeo-Siberians may be considered as possessing
the simplest, and the Neo-Siberians the most complex, form of Shamanism.
Thus among the former we see more 'Family' than 'Professional'
Shamanism; that is, the ceremonials, beliefs, and shamans are
practically limited to the family. Professional Shamanism, that is,
ceremonies of a communal kind performed by a specialized or professional
shaman, is here only in its infancy, and, being weaker, has been more
affected by Christianity.

Among the Neo-Siberians, where professional Shamanism is strongly
developed (for example, the Yakut), family Shamanism has been more
affected by European influences. We cannot, however, argue from this
that the Palaeo-Siberian form is the more primitive. Professional
Shamanism may be a development of family Shamanism, or it may be a
degenerate form, where environment is such that communal life is no
longer possible.

That the dissimilarity between the Shamanism of the Palaeo and
Neo-Siberians is no doubt due to the differences in the geographical
conditions of northern and southern Siberia seems to be proved by the
result of a careful study of certain Neo-Siberian tribes (Yakut) who
migrated to the north, and of certain Palaeo-Siberians (Gilyak) who
migrated to the south. The ease with which they absorbed the customs and
beliefs appertaining to

\[1. Banzaroff, The Black Faith, pp. 4-5.\]

their new surroundings shows that there was no fundamental difference
between their shamanistic practices. The differences, being due to
environment, disappear in migration. It cannot be said that the change
is due to contact, since this, in many cases, is very slight. Indeed,
Shamanism seems to be such a natural product of the Continental climate
with its extremes of cold and heat, of the violent *burgas* and
*burans*, \[1\] of the hunger and fear which attend the long winters,
that not only the Palaeo-Siberians and the more highly cultivated
Neo-Siberians, but even Europeans, have sometimes fallen under the
influence of certain shamanistic superstitions. Such is the case with
the Russian peasants and officials who settle in Siberia, and with the
Russian Creoles.\[2\].

According to the official census, only a small part of the aborigines
are 'true Shamanists', but, as a matter of fact, we see that though they
are registered as Orthodox Catholics and Buddhists, they are in reality
nearly all faithful to the practice of their old religion.

In psychological terminology, Shamanism consists of animistic and
preanimistic conceptions; although most of the people at present engaged
in research work on Siberia have been so much influenced by the Tylor
theory of Animism that they misuse the word 'soul', and the phenomena
that they describe as animistic are very often in a different category
altogether.

The reader must decide for himself whether Shamanism appeals to him as a
cult peculiar to this region, or whether it is part of a very general
primitive magico-religion. It appears to the author personally to be as
difficult to speak in general terms of primitive religions as it would
be to speak of Christian religious. This might be the task of a separate
work-to determine whether Shamanism in its conception of the deities,
nature, man, and in its rites, forms a special 'sect ' in the Animistic
Religion.
