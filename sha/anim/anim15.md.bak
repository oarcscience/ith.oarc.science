### THE HOME OF THE SOUL

WE have seen that to the discarnate spirit is attributed much of
fondness for things to which it had become accustomed in its earthly
life. The idea of preference or liking comes out frequently in
connection with its *post-mortem* habitat. Of course, it is to be
remembered that the eschatology of primitive peoples is vague and by no
means consistent. Indeed, when it is recalled that Christian eschatology
is still in a confused state, when orthodox theologians are at odds as
to the location of the soul between death and the judgment, even as to
the time of the judgment, whether immediately after death or at some
indefinitely distant time; when these doctors of the faith disagree as
to the conscious existence or the "sleep" of the soul after death, as to
its removal to heaven or hell on dissolution, and whether that heaven or
hell is final or, only temporary--one can hardly expect primitive
peoples, whose memory for history is short and their outlook and
forecast vague and brief, to have a consecutive and sharply defined
eschatology. Consequently we find variations innumerable in the
conceptions of the soul's location, and a sort of warfare between the
poor ghost's supposed preference and the desires of survivors.

It is quite normal that the spirit is credited with lingering affection
for the home and the environment that so long harbored it, and makes the
grave, which is, of course, in the immediate neighborhood, its favorite
haunt and the body in the grave still its home. How persistent this
primitive notion is may be verified in almost any rural community, where
few indeed care to pass God's acre after dark without company. The
prehistoric Mycenæans left in graves a groove by which evidently to pour
the offerings to the ghosts; Egyptian tombs had channels by which *ka*
or *ba* could have access to and egress from the embalmed body. Even in
Mongolia these apertures are found in the graves, though there they are
placed at the sides, showing that they were intended for the spirit's
exit and entrance and not to facilitate the placing of provisions--food
and drink.\[1\] Many primitive peoples entertain beliefs parallel to
those indicated by these customs. Such are African tribes like the
Baganda, certain Australians, and many others.\[2\] From this conception
may arise the thought that souls wander around their old haunts and even
make them impossible for dwellings, at least for a time; or they may
frequent places having peculiar topographical features, where their
clans foregather.\[3\] Sometimes this return is only temporary, limited
to certain hours of the night, as for example, the case of some African
ghosts, who are released between twelve and three in the
morning--remember the ghost of Hamlet's father!\[4\] In other cases
there is alleged to be a time when the ghosts must quit finally their
earthly haunts for a permanent abode elsewhere. Thus in New Guinea\[5\]
it seems that the spirit does not find its way at once to its home; but
wanders for some

time about the places it was familiar with during the period it was
connected with the body. It may be possible that the spirit does not
finally leave its own haunts until the death feasts are finished, or at
least that the people believe the spirit may be about, and likely to
injure them, until they think a sufficient time has elapsed, and a
sufficient number of death feasts have been held, and that then it is
safe to close the series, to remove the tabu, and to give over the
mourning."\[5\]

There is, however, in this conception left open the possibility of
securing a brief visit from them for purposes that are supposed to serve
the living. How easily out of this could develop the idea and practice
of necromancy!

On the other hand one may support with abundant evidence the thesis that
there is a quite general consensus to the effect that it is unseemly for
departed spirits to inhabit the land where the living pass their earthly
existence. It is widely believed that ghosts have their own land whither
living mortals may not go, whence, also, spirits may not

\[1. Newton, *In Far New Guinea*, p. 220; cf Neuhass, *Deutsch
Neu-Guinea*, iii. 149 ff.\]

usually return, unless under highly exceptional circumstances. Still it
must not be forgotten that a whole group of festivals and a host of folk
customs, centering in mid-winter for the most part, have as their basis
the idea that ghosts return annually and must be treated with respect,
kindness, and hospitality. All Souls' Day is the survival in Christian
custom of this belief.\[6\]

To the questions where and what the region of the dead is many tribes
give various answers. Naturally man's wildest flights of imagination and
fancy have played with this theme. Of course, much depends, in the
answer that is given by any particular group of peoples, upon the
geography of the region and the cosmography of the group. It is most
natural, from the usual custom of burial, that a region beneath the
earth should be in the thoughts of very diverse tribes and nations.
There was placed the Babylonian "Land-of-no-Return," for the most part
the Egyptian home of the dead, the Greek Hades, the resting place of
natives of Hood Peninsula and other places in New Guinea, in Oceanica

\[6. For convenient collections of cases, cf. Harrison, *Prolegomena*,
passim, and Miles, *Christmas*, iii. pp. 161 ff.\]

(Samoa)--to name only a few representative peoples.\[7\] On the other
hand, it frequently happens that the place of souls is otherwise
located: on a distant mountain, as with some natives of British New
Guinea;\[8\] or where the sun sets (compare Egyptian ideas); or on an
island far away;\[9\] or under the sea;\[10\] or in the heavens, either
in some defintitely designated luminary or in some indefinite locality
(Omahas regard the Milky Way as the path to this home by which spirits
pass in turn to and through seven spirit worlds).\[11\] At times the
information is quite definite, as for example in parts of New Guinea.

"About Wedau and Wamira the spirits of the dead go eventually to some
place to the eastward of Cape Frere, in a valley in the mountains called
Iola, the approach to the abode of the spirits being through a hole in
the ground. When the spirit arrives it is questioned at once, 'Where
have you come

from?' 'What have you come for?' just as every time you go into a
village every one you meet asks you, 'Where are you going?' 'What are
you after?' The newly arrived one says, 'I have come from Wedau'or
'Wamira,' as the case may be, or the answer may state more explicitly
the section of the village, and 'Where else should I go except to my own
people?' Then the question is asked, 'Who sent you?' and for answer the
name of some sorcerer or witch is given, the one responsible for the
death. The spirit is admitted to its new home, where it finds feasting
and dancing, plenty of food, and apparently also some fighting, and
should the spirit be killed, as some seem to think possible, during such
fighting, then it is the end, there is no more life of such."\[12\]

It would be expected that ideas differ greatly as to the character of
the spirit world. A wide group of unrelated peoples have looked on the
place of the soul as melancholy and mournful, fitting the soul's
unsubstantial character. The saying of Hezekiah, king of Israel, after
he had recovered from a dangerous illness, here leaps into the mind:

\[12. Newton, *In Far New Guinea*, p.219.\]

"For the grave cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee:  
They that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.  
The living, the living, he shall praise thee, As I do this day."\[13\]

Such were the conceptions of Babylonians, Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans. A
noted Greek hero is made to declare that he would rather be a lowly
laborer on earth than have an exalted station among the dead. Adversely
to this, not a few peoples patterned their ideas of future life on the
present world. Such is the content of the notion in cases already
cited\[14\] where primitive tribes mutilated foes to prevent the shades
from taking revenge in the other world. And in many other instances the
imagination has compassed only similar conceptions.\[15\] The Thay of
Indo-China look on the next life as the counterpart of this.\[16\] The
African Bakongo bury their dead late in the day so that the spirits may

arrive when the ghosts who preceded the present dead are home from their
labor in the fields and may welcome the newcomer.\[17\] Other Africans
know of ghost towns where the dead live and congregate as they did while
on earth.\[18\] The Hausa ghosts have a city of their own, which has at
least once been seen by a man who returned to tell the tale. A traveler
saw four caravans crossing the desert in different directions, and
followed one which seemed to him best. Suddenly he saw the ghost city in
front of him, and in some way became cognizant of its nature. He
hurriedly turned about and escaped. This was almost miraculous, for the
spirits summon travelers from a caravan, and he who follows them to the
ghost city never returns.\[19\] The ancient Egyptians conceived the land
of the departed and their life as duplicating under happier conditions
life on the Nile; indeed there was a celestial Nile land, where the
social conditions which environed life on earth continued, even to the
institution of slavery and subjection of the peasant to the noble. And
exactly on a par with this state of expectation

\[17. Weeks, *Primitive Bakongo*, p. 270.

18\. Talbot, *In the Shadow of the Bush*, passim.

19\. Tremearne, *Ban of The Bori*, pp. 155-156.\]

is the set of ideas regarding the "other side" entertained by South Sea
people.\[20\] The custom in old Egypt, Japan, and elsewhere, and in
modern Africa, of slaughtering wives, servants, slaves, and cattle to
provide a retinue and a living for the dead in the spirit world is too
well known to need substantiation here. We have already had before
us\[21\] the curious custom of providing Ushabtiu in Egypt, and have
seen the record of the institution of a similar custom in Japan, while
the explanation given in China and Korea of the figures around the
grave-mounds in those countries has also been cited. We have to remember
in taking note of these customs in the Far East that the practice of
magic there has for ages been almost as common and as inveterate as in
Egypt.

We may further note that in parts of Fiji and New Guinea the souls of
the departed are supposed to dwell in a great community, and the puberty
ceremonies are by some construed as having reference to introduction to
ancestral spirits in preparation for final union with them.\[22\]

\[20. Williamson, *South Sea Savage*, p. 75.

21\. Above, pp. 130 ff.

22\. Frazer, *Belief in Immortality*, i. 434.\]

In some regions the golden age of man is placed beyond the grave. Some
British New Guinea tribes think of the future life as a paradise, with
no old age, sickness, crime, fighting, death, or evil spirits; where
first marriages are reëstablished and children are born who reach
maturity and maintain that condition with unabated strength and
virility; and so it is with other South Sea islanders.\[23\]

The means of approach to this final abode varies, of course, with the
grade of civilization, the location of the soul's home, and many other
circumstances usually dependent on local conditions. If the home is on
an island or across a river, a ferry may be conceived--thus Melanesians
reproduce in part the ideas of the Greeks with their Charon and the
Styx.\[24\] Others conceive the entrance to be through well-known caves
or holes, and exploration of these by the reckless or foolhardy is
discouraged by the belief that attempts at entrance will be punished by
severe earthquakes.\[25\] Or a chasm is believed to separate

\[23. Brown, *Melanesians and Polynesians*, pp. 443 ff.; Frazer, *Belief
in Immortality*, i. 192; Seligmann, *Melanesians*, p. 192.

24\. Codrington, *Melanesians*, pp. 255 ff.

25\. Newton, *In Far New Guinea*, p. 219; Turner, *Samoa*, pp.
257-258.\]

the two worlds, spanned by a tree trunk, as among American Indians or
some Melanesians (the latter must carry the figure of a frigate bird to
ensure safe passage),\[26\] or with a higher development of culture the
tree trunk becomes a bridge, the chasm hell, and the passage the trial
of the soul.

While by far the preponderating belief among primitive peoples is that
the dead, especially their ghosts, are to be gotten out of the way, and
while the general feeling is one of fear, in occasional situations an
enduring connection with them is desired, and especial efforts are made
to bring this about. Thus some peoples in Africa, where nearly all
shades of primitive thought may be discovered, are so anxious to secure
this abiding presence of their dead that they cut off the head of the
deceased and preserve it in the home. This is thought to secure the
continuance of the presence of the favor of the dead patron, as he now
becomes by this means."
