<P>
This section has texts about Shamanism and Animism.
These are traditional belief systems which consider the entire
universe to be alive and interconnected.
Shamanism in practice is used to heal and enlighten, using ceremonials
which can include rhythmic music, mind altering drugs and mythic journeys into
the subconscious.

There are also numerous descriptions of Shamanism and related topics in
the <A HREF="../nam/index.htm">Native American</A>,
the <A HREF="../asia/index.htm">Traditional Asian</A>,
<A HREF="../aus/index.htm">Australian</A>,
<A HREF="../pac/index.htm">Pacific</A>,

<I>About the photo:</I>
Ainu Bear-Festival.  The matting wall is hung with
various implements and fetishes used at the festival.
The men are eating the flesh of the slain bear.
They are supposed to be the guests of the bear.
See also <A HREF="../neu/kveng/kvrune46.htm">
an episode from the Kalevala</A> for a curious episode with a bear
who gets invited to a feast....Perhaps the book titled
'To Serve Bear' should have been a giveaway.
