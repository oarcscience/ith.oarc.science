# VI. THE RITUAL OF THE RICE-FIELD

IN the magic safe-guarding rice from seed-time to harvest survives the
primitive ritual of the Indonesian race. Strip away the obvious
accretions, the names of Hindu deities, the thin Muslim veneer, and the
essence of the ritual remains intact in Malaya to-day. It deals with the
soul-substance, human, animal, vegetable, with the spirits of dead
magicians, nature-spirits and Father Sky and Mother Earth. Except for
Sky and Earth the spirits invoked lack the omnipresence and
individuality of gods, bear generic names and are indefinite in number.
Their sphere is a particular district. They inhabit the rice-field, the
thick jungle, the rays of the setting sun. No temples are erected in
their honour. The customary and symbolic rites that persuade them to
friendly relations with man can be enacted in a forest clearing, in the
corner of a rice swamp, on the floor of a village barn. No shaman or
priest of Siva or Muslim elder presides. The magician has the narrow
scope of the spirits he serves. He belongs to one small village or
humble district. Often the rites controlling the growth of rice are
conducted by an old Malay woman, relic of the far distant past when man
hunted and killed, and woman, the bearer of young, delved, lending the
benign influence of her motherhood to make crops prolific. Among many
aborigines this older custom is observed and the rites are celebrated
not by a man but by a woman, fitting midwife for the rice-baby. Still in
parts of the country agricultural implements are given by the Malay
groom to his bride as a wedding present.

Before starting to fell a clearing for rice, the farmer takes a lump of
benzoin on a plate wrapped in a white cloth as a present to the local
magician, a survivor in Malay culture whose trust is "first in God, next
in His Prophet, and then in the magicians of old, the ancestral spirits
who own the clumps and clods " of the locality.\[1\] This expert recites
charms over the benzoin and returns it to the planter with traditional
instructions. First he is to burn the benzoin in a bamboo conch and
fumigate his adzes and choppers, praying to the guardian spirits, male
and female, newly dead and dead long since, to be cool and propitious.
Then he is to stand erect facing eastward and look round at the four
quarters of the heavens; he is to notice at which quarter his breath
feels least faint and begin to fell in that

\[1. Except where acknowledgment is made to other sources, the following
account is based on two manuscripts written for me by Perak Malay
headmen twelve years ago. It contains certain interesting details
hitherto not noted in the Peninsula.\]

direction. After one or two hacks at the trees he must cease work for
the day.

When the time comes to burn the clearing, the man gets more benzoin from
the magician, furnigates his torches, lights them and cries thrice to
spirits of all sorts, Indonesian, Indian, Persian, Arabian, to goblins
with a Sanskrit name, to indigenous vampires, and goblins of the soil,
saying that the magician has duly informed them of his desire to burn,
that he himself has paid them due respect, and that trusting to the luck
of his instructor he hopes for a favourable breeze. Very early in the
morning after the burn he and his wife and children must hurry to
mitigate the smart of the half-burnt clearing with water in which are
steeped cold rice from last night's meal, a slice from the cool heart of
a gourd, and other vegetable products chosen for their natural frigidity
or appropriately cool names. Also a little maize should be planted. All
this must be done before Grannie Kemang can get up and sow rank weeds
that will flourish and provide hiding places for goblin pests. Before
quitting the clearing, one should pile and singe three rows of the
unburnt brushwood. Then one must go home and wait three days before
completing the burn.

The next important occasion is the planting of the rice-seed. In Perak
and Kedah the time for this is taken from observation of the Pleiades.
"When at 4.30 a.m. or thereabouts a few grains of rice slip off the palm
of the hand, the arm being outstretched and pointed at the
constellation, or when, the arm being so directed, the bracelet slides
down the wrist, it is considered to be time to put down the rice
nursery." In some places the planter is guided by observation of the
sun, calculating from the time when it is thought to be exactly overhead
at noon. Others "keep the seed-grain in store for a certain definite
period, that varies with the character of the grain and may be anything
between four and seven months.... This period of rest is vital to the
productive power of the seed." The flooding of some stream, the fruiting
of certain trees also afford rough local indications to supply the
defect of the misleading Muhammadan lunar calendar.

A seed plot is chosen where the soil smells sweet. It is partitioned off
by four sticks into a square of a prescribed size. Here both Sakai and
Malays sometimes practise a method of divination. Water in a coconut
shell and leaves are placed within the square. If the next morning finds
the leaves undisturbed, the water unspilt and the frame unmoved, the
spot is auspicious; it remains only to plant rice-seed in seven holes
within the square as custom ordains.

A stick, if possible of a special kind of wood (termed the "tortoise's
chest") which has grown on an anthill, must be cut fresh on the morning
of the ceremony to make the "mother dibble." It must be in length thrice
the span between a woman's thumb and ring-finger and it must be peeled.
A match or "twin" for the mother dibble must also be prepared, of any
wood, unpecled, three cubits and three ring-fingers long. Another dibble
is selected by the magician from the heap of dibbles brought by the
planters. A pretty leafy shrub is got ready to make a " plaything " for
the seed. The leader of the village mosque chants prayers for all souls.
Then those present feast.

Next, with a white cloth about his head the magician squats, facing the
east. The big toe of his right foot is above the big toe of his left,
and he recites charms over benzoin. He fumigates the mother dibble, her
"match" and the other dibble, and sprinkles them with rice-paste, does
the same to the other tools, and the same thrice to the earth in the
middle of the chosen square. He holds out to the four quarters of heaven
seven packets of sweet rice, seven sugar-canes, seven bamboos containing
rice cooked in them, the Malay's most primitive cooking-pot, and rice
parched, yellow and white. He lifts the mother dibble in both hands,
holds it across his head, its point towards the right. After reciting
charms he holds it above his shoulder point to earth, and digs it into
the middle of the square, withdraws it and then plants it firm and erect
in the hole. Next he plants the twin or duplicate, and then the leafy
shrub. He ties the mother dibble, her "twin" and the shrub together with
bark, and decorates the mother dibble with a creeper whose name denotes
increase. At the foot of the mother dibble he sets a bamboo containing
rice from the freak ears most favoured for the rice-baby as certain to
contain the rice soul, a rod of iron, a stone worn smooth in a
waterfall, and three quids of betel. On the shrub he hangs seven packets
of sweet rice, seven sugar canes, seven kinds of banana, seven sorts of
jungle fruit, apparently to attract and keep the seven souls of the
rice. He charms the third dibble and, before planting it also by the
side of the mother dibble, uses it to make seven holes, saying as he
makes them: "Peace be unto thee, Solomon, Prophet of Allah, prince of
all the earth! I would sow rice for seed. I pray thee protect it from
all danger and mischance."

After fumigating two handfuls of rice he holds it with his right hand
above his left and sprinkles it with cool rice-water of the kind made
for his burnt clearing and with the rice-paste used in all magical
ceremonies. (In Negri Sembilan as he does this he recites a verse

Rice-paste without speck!  
I'll get gold by the peck!  
I charm my rice crushed and in ear!  
I'll get full grain within the year.)

The rice-paste is taken from a coconut shell (or in modern days from a
soap-dish!), in which there have also been steeped a nail and husked
rice. It is applied with a brush of herbs whose vigorous growth or lucky
names ("the reviver", "the full one") are calculated to benefit the
seed, body and soul. Going to the first hole the magician cries: "Peace
be unto thee, Solomon, Prophet of God, prince of all the earth! Peace be
unto you, genies and goblins of the soil! Peace be unto my father the
Sky and my mother the Earth! Peace be unto you, guardian father,
guardian mother! I would send my child, daughter of Princess Splendid to
her mother. I would bid her sail on the sea that is black, the sea that
is green, the sea that is blue, the sea that is purple. For six months I
send her, and in the seventh I will welcome her back. It is not seed I
plant: it is rice-grain." Holding his breath, he puts the seed into the
seven holes. When he releases his breath, he does it gently and with
averted face.

The rice-paste he buries beside the mother dibble and turns the coconut
shell, its receptacle, upside down on the surface of the ground,
fumigating it and passing a censer three times round it. Then he rises
from his task.

Children rush to pick the sweet offerings from the shrub, though one
offering at least must be left on its branches. The leader of the mosque
intones prayers in honour of the Prophet. Men seize the dibbles, women
the seed. With shouts and laughter the sexes strive to outdo one another
in speed at their respective tasks. Before he goes home the owner of the
field removes from the square the bamboo filled with rice. This cereal
is eaten for the evening meal by himself and his family, but no stranger
may partake of it.

If it is dry hill rice, the seed has been sown over the field from the
first and no transplanting is required. If the rice is to be planted in
an irrigated field, the seed is sown in a nursery and forty-four days
later the young shoots are transplanted. That wet rice cultivation is
less primitive is perhaps shown by the omission in many districts of all
charms at this function, though again seven bunches are planted first,
along with a banana plant and three stems of the Clinogyne grandis, and
a fence is built round them. (In Negri Sembilan the following invocation
is addressed to spirits:--

O Langkesa! O Langkesi!  
Spirits of the field ye are four!  
Counting me we are five!  
Hurt not nor harm my child!  
Break faith and ye shall be stricken  
By the iron that is strong,  
By the majesty of Pagar Ruyong  
(Home of our royal house),  
By the thirty chapters of the Quran.  
Allah fulfil my curse!)

After this preliminary rite no work is done for the rest of the day. On
the morrow the seedlings are planted out by women, who must neither drop
the young plants nor speak. A wooden dibble is used in remote districts;
elsewhere a dibble with a steel point that bears the euphemistic name of
"the goat's hoof." "This instrument carries from five to nine seedlings
at once and is used seven times in quick succession." While each of
seven bunches of seedlings are being planted the tongue must be "pressed
against the roof of the mouth." At this season a propitiatory sacrifice
is sometimes offered to the earth spirits. If dry rice is being
cultivated, this is done about the time the rice begins to swell. From
about the fourth month of its growth no stranger may enter the field.

As soon as the ear has swollen large, the farmer cooks sweet rice in a
bamboo and invites the magician, the leader of the mosque, and other
worthies to the feast of "splitting the bamboo." Nightly now rubbish and
stinking herbs are burnt to scare evil spirits.

When the crop is ripe for harvest, the magician has to "take the souls
of the rice." For two evenings he walks round the edge of the field,
coaxing and collecting them. On the third he enters the field to search
for their host, looking about for ears of royal yellow, certain types of
freak ear reminding one of a veiled or laughing princess, ears on stalks
interlaced, ears from stalks with a lucky bird's nest at the root. When
he has found a suitable host, he ties seven stalks with bark and fibre
and many coloured thread having a nail attached to it, and slips the
nail into the middle of the bunch. Thrice before the cutting of the
seven stalks is performed the magician walks round them bidding
malicious earth spirits avaunt:--

"Goblins of latter days! Goblins of the beginning! Goblins one hundred
and ninety! Goblins under my feet and subjection! Goblins that creep
into baskets and round stalks! Goblins of hill and mountain and plain!
Goblins mine! Get ye back and aside or I will curse ye."

Early the next morning the leader of the mosque mounts a covered shelter
in the field and intones prayers in honour of the Prophet. A feast
follows. When evening is about to fall, the magician and an assistant
and the farmer walk up to the plant chosen the day before. A puzzle ring
is carried to hang on the stalks. The magician, his head covered with a
white cloth, draws near. Taking care lest his shadow fall on the seven
stalks, he fumigates them and, sprinkling rice-paste, grasps them
gingerly, hiding in his palm a tiny blade, whose handle is carved in the
shape of a bird for disguise. He bows his head to the ground and mutters
a traditional invocation:--

Soul of my child, Princess Splendid!  
I sent you to your mother for six months, to receive you growing tall in
the seventh month.  
The time is fulfilled, and I receive you.  
I told you to sail to the sea that is black, the sea that is green, the
sea that is blue, and the sea that is purple,  
To the land of Rome, to India, China, and Siam.  
Now I would welcome you up into a palace hall, To a broidered mat and
carpet.  
I would summon nurses and followers,  
Subjects and soldiers and court dignitaries for your service;  
I would assemble horses and elephants, ducks and geese, buffaloes and
goats and sheep with all their din.  
Come, for all is ready I would call you hither,  
Soul of my child, Princess Splendid!  
Come., my crown and my garland, flower of my delight!  
I welcome you up to a palace-hall,  
To a broidered mat and carpet.  
Soul of my child, Princess Splendid!  
Come! I would welcome you!  
Forget your mother and wet-nurse.  
White and black and green and blue and purple get ye aside!  
Brightness of genie and devil begone!  
The real brightness is the brightness of my child.

Clearly the four seas must symbolize the black earth of the newly-tilled
fields, and the carpet of green rice-plants changing tint from light to
dark until the harvest.

The magician lifts his head. Skyward and all around he gazes for the
advent of the rice-soul. With the sound of a breeze it appears either in
the form of a grasshopper or other insect or in the shape of a girl,
Grannie Kemang. If it fails at first to come, the repetition of the most
coaxing lines of the invocation three times is certain to fetch it. The
magician holds his breath, shuts his eyes, sets his teeth, and with one
cut severs the ears from the seven stalks. Like a midwife holding a
new-born child, he puts the ears in his lap and swaddles them in a white
cloth. This rice baby he hands to the owner of the land to hold. He cuts
seven more clusters of grain from round the plant whence "she" was taken
and puts them along with an egg and a golden banana into the basket
prepared for the baby. The rice-baby is cradled among brinjal leaves, a
stone and a piece of iron, and under a canopy of cool creepers and bark
and fibre and coloured thread. The magician smears the seven stalks from
which the ears were cut with clay, "as medicine for their hurt from the
knife," and hides them under neighbour stalks that are whole. Then
facing the east, he touches the maimed stalks and cries:--

Ho ancestresses whose rice-fields shone at the coming of our first
king!  
Grow here, maidens, in clumps!  
Establish your home here!  
If the seven tiers of heaven are shaken,  
Then only shall my child, Princess Splendid, be shaken;  
If the seven layers of earth are shaken,  
Then only shall my child, Princess Splendid, be shaken;  
Else shall she be established as rock, firm as iron  
From this world unto the world hereafter,  
Established in limbs and body with father and mother.  
Only if the Prophet be parted from Allah  
Shall you be parted from me.

The magician kisses the rice-stalks and heads the procession carrying
the rice-baby home. The farmer is addressed as the father of the baby
and his wife as the mother. She and her children are waiting and, as she
takes the basket from her husband, the woman exclaims:--"Dear heart! My
life! My child! How I have longed for your return from your voyage!
Every day of your absence, every month, all the year I've missed you.
Now you've returned safe and sound! Come! Your room is ready." She
kisses the rice-baby three times. The magician fumigates and sprinkles a
spot for the cradle. Then he takes the egg out of the cradle and breaks
it. If there is an empty space at the top of the egg, it is a poor omen;
if at either side of it, a good; but if the shell is quite full, the
omen is so good that it must be greeted with an offering of yellow rice
and a spatchcock. The egg and the golden banana must be eaten by the
farmer and his family, and no one else may taste them. For three days
the household must keep vigil, the fire may not be quenched, the food in
the cooking-pots may not be finished, no one may go down from the house
or ascend to it. Thus all the precautions fitting for a new-born child
must be observed. During the three days following these birth tabus, one
small basket of ears a day may be reaped, and the reaper must work
silently, not gaze around, and guard against his shadow falling on the
plants as he would guard against another's shadow falling on his own. On
the seventh day reaping may begin in earnest, but the yield for that day
is devoted to a feast in honour of the spirits of dead magicians, the
forebears who have charge of the district.

The rice won on the seventh day is trodden out on a mat, and winnowed in
a sieve. Then the grain is placed on a mat in the middle of the garden
along with brinjal leaves, a stone from a waterfall, an iron nail, a
candle-nut, three cockle-shells, a creeper and the inverted rattan stand
of a cooking-pot on which is put a coconut shell full of water (to
quench the thirst of the parching grain). Around this stand the grain is
spread, nor may it be left unwatched until the sun has dried it.

In some parts of the Peninsula there is a "harvest dance that forms part
of the procedure of gathering in the rice. The performers are a band of
some fifteen or twenty young children, both boys and girls, who carry
winnowing-sieves and other tools of the harvester. The troop is invited
forward by an old woman taking up her position on the threshing screen
and singing to the children, who respond by dancing and putting
questions for the old lady to answer in verse. When the spectators are
weary of the dancing and singing the performance is brought to an end in
the following very curious way. The girl-leader of the children's chorus
sings a verse that purports to be a charm ' making all things brittle.'
Having done so (doubtless with the idea of making the threshing easier)
she leads her band of dancers to the screen by way of testing the
efficacy of the magic. The children tramp and stamp on the screen; and
when a lath has shown its brittleness by breaking, the charm is supposed
to have done its work and the dance ends."

The next process is to pound the rice in a wooden mortar. Again the
mortar must be hung with bark, black fibre, coloured thread and
cool-named leaves. Allah and the Prophet are invoked. The pestle crushes
the grain slowly three, five or seven times, and then may work at
ordinary speed. The rice crushed, the "eldest child of the year," is
cooked in a spray-hung pot and eaten at a feast.

The last and biggest feast of the rice year is "the Malay harvest home.
Each planter keeps open house in turn, when all his friends come to help
him tread out his grain. Even the reverend elders assume for the time
the manner of children and verses are bandied with the gentle licence
characteristic of Malay junketings." Games, theatricals (and formerly
buffalo-fights) formed part of the celebrations. Tithes are paid to the
mosque and fees to the magician.

The magician presides over the first storing of the grain in the barn.
Again, brinjal leaves, a stone from a waterfall, a piece of iron, a
candle-nut or better three candle-nuts, a plant with a fine healthy
name, three cockle-shells, a piece of torch, all covered with the
ancestral rice-measure and the measure covered with the rattan stand of
a cooking-pot hung with bark and fibre and coloured thread-on these
solid soul-strengthening foundations he pours the grain from the three
basketfuls of rice cut near the sheaf whence the rice-baby was taken.
The shepherd of souls has performed his final task and the remainder of
the grain is left for the farmer to pile.

Some of the ears that go to make up the rice-baby will be mixed with
next year's seed and some with next year's magic rice-paste used at all
functions by the Malay magician.

This account of the ritual of the rice-year in the Malay Peninsula can
be supplemented from other sources. Nearly a century ago in Province
Wellesley the seed was twice measured before being sown in the nursery
"in order to ascertain that none had escaped preternaturally." There,
too, sometimes seven stalks were cut for the rice-baby, sometimes two
only, a male and a female, on each side of which a gold or silver ring
was tied before they were wrapped together in a white cloth. The most
notable point in the Perak account is that the farmer and his wife are
regarded as the father and mother of the rice-soul. In Malacca the sheaf
from which the baby is cut is called the mother, treated like a woman
after childbirth and reaped by the farmer's wife. In ancient Greece
there was confusion as to the moment when Demeter, the corn-mother,
changed into Persephone, the corn-daughter, and in many other countries
the bucolic mind has glozed over this difficulty.

The charming of hatchets, the dibble cut from a special tree likely by
sympathetic magic to influence the quality of the rice-plant, the
dibbling of seven holes in a special plot, the holidays prescribed after
felling and sowing and reaping, the seven ears for the rice-soul, the
various communal feasts throughout the rice-year, all these are found
among the Proto-Malay tribes of Malaya.

In Negri Sembilan, where matrilineal custom laughs at the proscriptions
of Islam, girls and men bandy Malay *pantun*, half verse half riddle,
one with another as they work in the fields. Comparison with planting
rites in other lands has suggested that riddles are a survival of a tabu
language, employed not to frighten the soul of a cereal by direct
reference to the processes of agriculture.

The symbolism of the ritual will be clear to any one who has grasped the
primitive Malay notion of the soul. The soul of the rice in the field is
of the same stuff that villagers' are made of and, figured in
anthropomorphic form, is treated with the care lavished on a new-born
child.

The recognition by the animist of souls that may inhabit stock or stone,
man or plant, and quit its host to assume the shape of tiger,
grasshopper or girl, leads naturally to belief in disembodied spirits
that may enter man and make him sick, enter drum or stone and make it a
fetish, and act as capriciously as animals or human beings. The idea of
the survival of the soul apart from the body leads also to the worship
of ancestors. So in the ritual of the rice-field there is continual
reference to ancestral spirits and goblins of the soil, the hill, the
plain. Accordingly, every three or four years before clearing their
fields for planting Malay husbandmen have a mock-combat to expel evil
spirits. Sometimes banana stems are the weapons wielded. Sometimes the
two opposing parties hurl thin rods with pared flat ends like that of an
old-fashioned stethoscope across a gully until a blow makes the face of
one of the combatants bleed and ends the fray. It has been suggested
that originally one of the parties in such mimic battles represented the
forces of evil. In Negri Sembilan the magician opens the proceedings
with this conjuration:--

In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate!  
Ancestors that inhabit the layers of the earth!  
Genies of the soil! Idols of iron!  
Get ye aside, genies and devils!  
Make way for the might of Allah!  
You who thrust up to peer  
Bow down, for as a tiger I pass by.  
Genies and devils and goblins!  
Trespass not where Allah hath forbidden,  
Else are ye traitors to Him whose Being exists of necessity.  
I know the origin whence ye sprang:  
From the soil of Mount Meru ye were born,  
In the clouds, called the Beautiful Billowy Ones!  
In the sky, the Pendent Ones!  
In the fig-tree, the Peerers!  
In the water, the Crawlers!  
In the paths, the Up-Stickers!  
I have Allah's mandate!  
His Prophet is my prop:  
The recording angels fight for me;  
The four archangels are my brethren;  
I live in a fort with seven walls of steel.  
Descend angels and protect me.  
And cause my enemies to bow down;  
Locked be the teeth and heart and spleen  
Of all who purpose evil against me.  
I know the origin of ye spirits of evil:  
Ye were sprung from the serpent Sakti-muna!  
May ye be afflicted and distressed;  
When ye gaze, may your eyes be blinded,  
And may your going be shameful and grovelling.  
Grandsire! thou who dwellest in bay and reaches, upstream and down,  
Dwellest on mountain and in forest and on mound,  
In ravine and valley and spring and tree and rock!  
Take thy soldiery, thy people and thy children  
To the shady tree at the land's end  
At the foot of Mount Kaf.  
Keep me from harm and destruction  
Or thou shalt be smitten by the majesty of God's word.  
For God and Muhammad and His saints and Prophets  
And the angels forty-and-four and the four archangels  
Are with me.  
Noah, guardian of earth!  
Jacob, guardian of rock!  
Luqman, guardian of iron!  
Solomon, guardian of all living things!  
I crave earth, water, wood and stone,  
A place to build houses and hamlets and a country.  
Ho! all living creatures,  
We are all of one origin, all servants of God!  
If ye harm or destroy me,  
Ye shall be smitten by the word of God,  
The miraculous power of Muhammad,  
The sanctity of His saints and prophets,  
By the four-and-forty angels,  
The four archangels and the thirty chapters of the Quran!  
Grandsire, save me from harm!  
If thy eye offend me, God shall blind thee;  
If thy hand molest me, God shall break it;  
If thy heart purpose evil towards me,  
It shall be crushed by the Apostle of God.

Another incantation follows to open the doors of the seven heavens and
the seven earths:--

Genies infidel and Muslim!  
You and I are of one origin, both servants of God.  
But ye are born of hell-fire,  
And I of the light of the Prophet  
Ye are children of Sakti-muna the serpent,  
I am descended from the Prophet Adam;  
Ye are followers of the Prophet Solomon,  
I am a follower of the Prophet Muhammad.  
You and I are servants of God.  
Plague not the followers of Muhammad,  
Else ye will be traitors to God,  
To His Prophet and the four archangels  
And the angels forty-and-four.  
Genies and devils and goblins!  
Get hence to the big leafy tree at the land's end  
At the foot of Mount Kaf,  
Else ye will be traitors to Him who was from the beginning  
To God's house at Jerusalem, the primal land.  
My altar is strewn with clods red and black:  
Jinn! goblins! hence! and come ye not back.

This expulsion of demons, these incantations, this reference to an altar
introduces the shaman with his confident control of the spirit world,
his *séance*s and periodical sacrifices for the public welfare.
