### VII.

### LITERATURE--POLEMICAL.

IT can hardly be said that inverted sexuality received a serious and
sympathetic treatment until a German jurist, named Karl Heinrich
Ulrichs, began his long warfare against what he considered to be
prejudice and ignorance upon a topic of the greatest moment to himself.
A native of Hanover, and writing at first under the assumed name of Numa
Numantius, he kept pouring out a series of polemical, analytical,
theoretical, and apologetical pamphlets between the years 1864 and 1870.
The most important of these works is a lengthy and comprehensive Essay
entitled "Memnon. Die Geschlechtsnatur des mannliebenden Urnings. Eine
naturwissenschaftliche Darstellung. Schleiz, 1868." Memnon may be used
as the text-book of its author's theories; but it is also necessary to
study earlier and later treatises--Inclusa, Formatrix, Vindex, Ara Spei,
Gladius Furens, Incubus, Argonauticus, Prometheus, Araxes, Kritische
Pfeile--in order to obtain a complete knowledge of his opinions, and to
master the whole mass of information he has brought together.

The object of Ulrichs in these miscellaneous writings is twofold. He
seeks to establish a theory of sexual

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

inversion upon the basis of natural science, proving that abnormal
instincts are inborn and healthy in a considerable percentage of human
beings; that they do not owe their origin to bad habits of any kind, to
hereditary disease, or to wilful depravity; that they are incapable in
the majority of cases of being extirpated or converted into normal
channels; and that the men subject to them are neither physically,
intellectually, nor morally inferior to normally constituted
individuals. Having demonstrated these points to his own satisfaction,
and supported his views with a large induction of instances and a
respectable show of erudition, he proceeds to argue that the present
state of the law in many states of Europe is flagrantly unjust to a
class of innocent persons, who may indeed be regarded as unfortunate and
inconvenient, but who are guilty of nothing which deserves reprobation
and punishment. In this second and polemical branch of his exposition,
Ulrichs assumes, for his juristic starting-point, that each human being
is born with natural rights which legislation ought not to infringe but
protect. He does not attempt to confute the utilitarian theory of
jurisprudence, which regards laws as regulations made by the majority in
the supposed interests of society. Yet a large amount of his reasoning
is designed to invalidate utilitarian arguments in favour of repression,
by showing that no social evil ensues in those countries which have
placed abnormal sexuality upon the same footing as the normal, and that
the toleration of inverted passion threatens no danger to the wellbeing
of nations.

After this prelude, an abstract of Ulrichs' theory and

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

his pleading may be given, deduced from the comparative study of his
numerous essays.

The right key to the solution of the problem is to be found in
physiology, in that obscure department of natural science which deals
with the evolution of sex. The embryo, as we are now aware, contains an
undetermined element of sex during the first months of pregnancy. This
is gradually worked up into male and female organs of procreation; and
these, when the age of puberty arrives, are generally accompanied by
corresponding male and female appetites. That is to say, the man in an
immense majority of cases desires the woman, and the woman desires the
man. Nature, so to speak, aims at differentiating the undecided fœtus
into a human being of one or the other sex, the propagation of the
species being the main object of life. Still, as Aristotle puts it, and
as we observe in many of her operations, "Nature wishes, but has not
always the power": ἡ φύσις βόυλεται μὲν ἀλλ᾽ ού δύναται. Consequently,
in respect of physical structure, there come to light imperfect
individuals, so-called hermaphrodites, whose sexual apparatus is so far
undetermined that many a real male has passed a portion of his life
under a mistake, has worn female clothes, and has cohabited by
preference with men. Likewise, in respect of spiritual nature, their
appear males who, notwithstanding their marked masculine organisation,
feel from the earliest childhood a sexual proclivity toward men, with a
corresponding indifference for women. In some of these abnormal, but
natural, beings, the appetite for men resembles the normal appetite of
men for women; in others it resembles the normal appetite of women for

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

men. That is to say, some prefer effeminate males, dressed in feminine
clothes and addicted to female occupations. Others prefer powerful
adults of an ultra-masculine stamp. A third class manifest their
predilection for healthy young men in the bloom of adolescence, between
nineteen and twenty. The attitude of such persons towards women also
varies. In genuine cases of inborn sexual inversion a positive horror is
felt when the woman has to be carnally known; and this horror is of the
same sort as that which normal men experience when they think of
cohabitation with a male. <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md) In others
the disinclination does not amount to repugnance; but the abnormal man
finds considerable difficulty in stimulating himself to the sexual act
with females, and derives a very imperfect satisfaction from the same. A
certain type of man, in the last place, seems to be indifferent,
desiring males at one time and females at another.

In order to gain clearness in his exposition, Ulrichs has invented names
for these several species. The so-called hermaphrodite he dismisses with
the German designation of *Zwitter*. Imperfect individuals of this type
are not to be considered, because it is well known that the male or
female organs are never developed in one and the same body. It is also,
as we shall presently discover, an essential part of his theory to
regard the problem of inversion psychologically.

The normal man he calls *Dioning*, the abnormal man *Urning*. Among
Urnings, those who prefer effeminate males are christened by the name of
*Mannling*; those

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

who prefer powerful and masculine adults receive the name of *Weibling*;
the Urning who cares for adolescents is styled a *Zwischen-Urning*. Men
who seemed to be indifferently attracted by both sexes, he calls
*Uranodioninge*. A genuine Dioning, who, from lack of women, or under
the influence of special circumstances, consorts with persons of his own
sex, is denominated *Uraniaster*. A genuine Urning, who has put
restraint upon his inborn impulse, who has forced himself to cohabit
with women, or has perhaps contracted marriage, is said to be
*Vivilisirt*--a virilised Urning.

These outlandish names, though seemingly pedantic and superfluous, have
their technical value, and are necessary to the understanding of
Ulrichs' system. He is dealing exclusively with individuals classified
by common parlance as males without distinction. Ulrichs believes that
he can establish a real natural division between men proper, whom he
calls *Dioninge*, and males of an anomalous sexual development, whom he
calls *Urninge*. Having proceeded so far, he finds the necessity of
distinguishing three broad types of the Urning, and of making out the
crosses between Urning and Dioning, of which he also find three species.
It will appear in the sequel that whatever may be thought about his
psychological hypothesis, the nomenclature he has adopted is useful in
discussion, and corresponds to well-defined phenomena, of which we have
abundant information. The following table will make his analysis
sufficiently plain:--

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

<span id="img_08900"></span> ![](img/08900.jpg)

Broadly speaking, the male includes two main species: Dioning and
Urning, men with normal and men with abnormal instincts. What, then,
constitutes the distinction between them? How are we justified in
regarding them as radically divergent?

Ulrichs replies that the phenomenon of sexual [inversion](errata.htm#1.md)
is to be explained by physiology, and particularly by the evolution of
the embryo. <span id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55.md) Nature fails to

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

complete her work regularly and in every instance. Having succeeded in
differentiating a male with full-formed sexual organs from the undecided
fœtus, she does not always effect the proper differentiation of that
portion of the psychical being in which resides the sexual appetite.
There remains a female soul in a male body. *Anima muliebris virili
corpore inclusa*, is the formula adopted by Ulrichs; and he quotes a
passage from the "Vestiges of Creation," which suggests that a male is a
more advanced product of sexual evolution than the female. The male
instinct of sex is a more advanced product than the female instinct.
Consequently men appear whose body has been differentiated as masculine,
but whose sexual instinct has not progressed beyond the feminine stage.

Ulrichs' own words ought to be cited upon this fundamental part of his
hypothesis, since he does not adopt

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

the opinion that the Urning is a Dioning arrested at a certain point of
development; but rather that there is an element of uncertainty
attending the simultaneous evolution of physical and psychical factors
from the indeterminate ground-stuff. "Sex," says he, "is only an affair
of development. Up to a certain stage of embryonic existence all living
mammals are hermaphroditic. A certain number of them advance to the
condition of what I call man (Doining), others to what I call woman
(Dioningin), a third class become what I call *Urning* (including
*Urningin*). It ensues therefrom that between these three sexes there
are no primary, but only secondary differences. And yet true
differences, constituting sexual species, exist as facts." <span
id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56.md) Man, Woman, and Urning--the third being
either a male or a female in whom we observe a real and inborn, not an
acquired or a spurious, inversion of appetite-are consequently regarded
by him as the three main divisions of humanity viewed from the point of
view of sex. The embryonic ground-stuff in the case of each was
homologous; but while the two former, Man and Woman, have been normally
differentiated, the Urning's sexual instinct, owing to some imperfection
in the process of development, does not correspond to his or her sexual
organs.

The line of division between the sexes, even in adult life, is a subtle
one; and the physical structure of men and women yields indubitable
signs of their emergence from a common ground-stuff. Perfect men have
rudimentary breasts. Perfect women carry a rudimentary

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

penis in their clitoris. The raphé of the scrotum shows where the
aperture, common at first to masculine and feminine beings, but
afterwards only retained in the female vulva, was closed up to form a
male. Other anatomical details of the same sort might be adduced. But
these will suffice to make thinking persons reflect upon the mysterious
dubiety of what we call sex. That gradual development, which ends in
normal differentiation, goes on very slowly. It is only at the age of
puberty that a boy distinguishes himself abruptly from a girl, by
changing his voice and growing hair on parts of the body where it is not
usually found in women. This being so, it is surely not surprising that
the sexual appetite should sometimes fail to be normally determined, or
in other words should be inverted.

Ulrichs maintains that the body of an Urning is masculine, his soul
feminine, so far as sex is concerned. Accordingly, though physically
unfitted for coition with men, he is imperatively drawn towards them by
a natural impulse. Opponents meet him with this objection: "Your
position is untenable. Body and soul constitute one inseparable entity."
So they do, replies Ulrichs; but the way in which these factors of the
person are combined in human beings differs extremely, as I can prove by
indisputable facts. The body of a male is visible to the eyes, is
mensurable and ponderable, is clearly marked in its specific organs. But
what we call his soul--his passions, inclinations, sensibilities,
emotional characteristics, sexual desires--eludes the observation of the
senses. This second factor, like the first, existed in the undetermined
stages of the fœtus. And when I find that the soul, this element of
instinct

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

and emotion and desire existing in a male, had been directed in its
sexual appetite from earliest boyhood towards persons of the male sex, I
have the right to qualify it with the attribute of femininity. You
assume that soul-sex is indissolubly connected and inevitably derived
from body-sex. The facts contradict you, as I can prove by referring to
the veracious autobiographies of Urnings and to known phenomena
regarding them.

Such is the theory of Ulrichs; and though we may not incline to. his
peculiar mode of explaining the want of harmony between sexual organs
and sexual appetite in Urnings, there can be no doubt that in some way
or other their eccentric diathesis must be referred to the obscure
process of [sexual](errata.htm#2.md) differentiation. <span
id="fr_57"></span>[1](#fn_57.md) Perhaps he antedates the moment at which
the aberration sometimes takes its origin, not accounting sufficiently
for imperative impressions made on the imagination or the senses of boys
during the years which precede puberty.

However this may be, the tendency to such inversion is certainly inborn
in an extremely large percentage of cases. That can be demonstrated from
the reports of persons whose instincts were directed to the male before
they knew what sex meant. It is worth extracting passages from. these
confessions. <span id="fr_58"></span>[2](#fn_58) (1.md) "As a schoolboy

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

of eight years, I sat near a comrade rather older than myself; and how
happy was I, when he touched me. That was the first indefinite
perception of an inclination which remained a secret for me till my
nineteenth year." (2) "Going back to my seventh year, I had a lively
feeling for a schoolfellow, two years older than myself; I was happy
when I could be as close as possible to him, and in our games could
place my head near to his private parts." (3) "At ten years of age he
had a romantic attachment for a comrade; and the passion for people of
his own sex became always more and more marked." (4) Another confessed
that "already at the age of four he used to dream of handsome grooms."
(5) A fifth said: "My passion for people of my own sex awoke at the age
of eight. I used to enjoy my brother's nakedness; while bathing with
other children, I took no interest at all in girls, but felt the
liveliest attraction toward boys." (6) A sixth dates his experience from
his sixth or seventh year. (7) A seventh remembers that "while yet a
boy, before the age of puberty, sleeping in the company of a male
agitated him to such an extent that he lay for hours awake." (8) An
eighth relates that "while three years old, I got possession of a
fashion book, cut out the pictures of men, and kissed them to tatters.
The pictures of women I did not care to look at." (9) A ninth goes back
to his thirteenth year, and a school friendship. (10) A tenth records
the same about his seventh year. (11) An eleventh says that his inverted
instincts awoke in early childhood, and that from his ninth year onward
he fell over and over again in love with adult men. (12) A twelfth spoke
as follows: "So

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

far back as I can remember, I was always subject to this passion. Quite
as a child, young men made deeper impression on me than women or girls.
The earliest sensual [perturbation](errata.htm#3.md) of which I have any
recollection was excited by a tutor, when I was nine or ten, and my
greatest pleasure was to be allowed to ride astride upon his leg." (13)
A thirteenth: "From the earliest childhood I have been haunted by
visions of men, and only of men; never has a woman exercised the least
influence over me. At school I kept these instincts to myself, and lived
quite retired." (14) A fourteenth can recollect receiving a distinctly
sensual impression at the age of four, when the man-servants caressed
him." (15) A fifteenth says that at the age of thirteen, together with
puberty, the inversion of appetite awoke in him. (16) A sixteenth
confesses that he felt an unconquerable desire for soldiers in his
thirteenth year. (17) A seventeenth remembers having always dreamed only
of men; and at school, he says, "when my comrades looked at pretty girls
and criticised them during our daily promenades, I could not comprehend
how they found anything to admire in such creatures." On the other hand,
the sight and touch of soldiers and strong fellows excited him
enormously. (18) An eighteenth dates the awakening of passion in him at
the age of eleven, when he saw a handsome man in church; and from that
time forward his instinct never altered. (19) A nineteenth fell in love
with an officer at the age of thirteen, and since then always desired
vigorous adult males. (20) A twentieth confessed to have begun to love
boys of his own age, sensually, while only eight years of age. (21) A
twenty-first

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

records that, when he was eight, he began to crave after the sight of
naked men.

In addition to these cases a great many might be culled from the
writings of Ulrichs, who has published a full account from his own early
experience. <span id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_59.md) "I was fifteen years and
ten and a half months old," he says, "when the first erotic dream
announced the arrival of puberty. Never before that period had I known
sexual gratification of any kind whatever. The occurrence was therefore
wholly normal. From a much earlier time, however, I had been subject to
emotions, partly romantic, partly sensual, without any definite desire,
and never for one and the same young man. These aimless yearnings of the
senses plagued me in my solitary hours, and I could not overcome them.
During my fifteenth year, while at school at Detmold, the vague longing
took a twofold shape. First, I came across Norman's 'Säulenordnungen,'
and there I was vehemently attracted by the figure of a Greek god or
hero, standing in naked beauty. Secondly, while studying in my little
room, or before going to sleep, the thought used suddenly and
irresistibly to rise up in my mind--If only a soldier would clamber
through the window and come into my room! I then painted in my fancy the
picture of a splendid soldier of twenty to twenty-two years old. And yet
I had no definite idea of why I wanted him; nor had I ever come in
contact with soldiers. About two years after this, I happened to sit
next a soldier in a post-carriage. The contact with his thigh excited me
to the highest degree."

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Ulrichs also relates that in his tenth year he
conceived an enthusiastic and romantic friendship for a boy two years
his senior.

That experiences of the kind are very common, every one who has at all
conversed with Urnings knows well. From private sources of
unquestionable veracity, these may be added. *A* relates that, before
eight years old, reverie occurred to him during the day, and dreams at
night, of naked sailors. When he began to study Latin and Greek, he
dreamed of young gods, and at the age of fourteen, became deeply
enamoured of the photograph of the Praxitelian Erôs in the Vatican. He
had a great dislike for physical contact with girls; and with boys was
shy and reserved, indulging in no acts of sense. *B* says that during
his tenderest boyhood, long before the age of puberty, he fell in love
with a young shepherd on one of his father's farms, for whom he was so
enthusiastic that the man had to he sent to a distant moor. *C* at the
same early age, conceived a violent affection for a footman; *D* for an
officer, who came to stay at his home; *E* for the bridegroom of his
eldest sister.

In nearly all the cases here cited, the inverted sexual instinct sprang
up spontaneously. Only a few of the autobiographies record seduction by
an elder man as the origin of the affection. In none of them was it ever
wholly overcome. Only five out of the twenty-seven men married. Twenty
declare that, tortured by the sense of their dissimilarity to other
males, haunted by shame and fear, they forced themselves to frequent
public women soon after the age of puberty. Some found themselves
impotent. Others succeeded in accomplishing

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

their object with difficulty, or by means of evoking the images of men
on whom their affections were set. All, except one, concur in
emphatically asserting the superior attraction which men have always
exercised for them over women. Women leave them, if not altogether
disgusted, yet cold and indifferent. Men rouse their strongest
sympathies and instincts. The one exception just alluded to is what
Ulrichs would call an Uranodioning. The others are capable of friendship
with women, some even of aesthetic admiration, and the tenderest regard
for them, but not of genuine sexual desire. Their case is literally an
inversion of the ordinary.

Some observations may be made on Ulrichs' theory. It is now recognised
by the leading authorities, medical and medico-juristic, in Germany, by
writers like Casper-Liman and Krafft-Ebing, that sexual inversion is
more often than not innate. So far, without discussing the physiological
or metaphysical explanations of this phenomenon, without considering
whether Ulrichs is right in his theory of *anima muliebris inclusa in
corpore virili*, or whether heredity, insanity, and similar general
conditions are to be held responsible for the fact, it may be taken as
admitted on all sides that the sexual diathesis in question is in a very
large number of instances congenital. But Ulrichs seems to claim too
much for the position he has won. He ignores the frequency of acquired
habits. He shuts his eyes to the force of fashion and depravity. He
reckons men like Horace and Ovid and Catullus, among the ancients, who
were clearly indifferent in their tastes (as indifferent as the modern
Turks) to the account of Uranodionings.

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

\[paragraph continues\] In one word, he is so enthusiastic for his
physiological theory that he overlooks all other aspects of the
question. Nevertheless, he has acquired the right to an impartial
hearing, while pleading in defence of those who are acknowledged by all
investigators of the problem to be the subjects of an inborn
misplacement of the sexual appetite.

Let us turn, then, to the consideration of his arguments in favour of
freeing Urnings from the terrible legal penalties to which they are at
present subject, and, if this were possible, from the no less terrible
social condemnation to which they are exposed by the repugnance they
engender in the normally constituted majority. Dealing with these
exceptions to the kindly race of men and women, these unfortunates who
have no family ties knotted by bonds by mutual love, no children to
expect, no reciprocity of passion to enjoy, mankind, says Ulrichs, has
hitherto acted just in the same way as a herd of deer acts when it
drives the sickly and the weakly out to die in solitude, burdened with
contumely, and cut off from common sympathy.

From the point of view of morality and law, he argues, it does not
signify whether we regard the sexual inversion of an Urning as morbid or
as natural. He has become what he is in the dawn and first emergence of
emotional existence. You may contend that he derives perverted instincts
from his ancestry, that he is the subject of a psychical disorder, that
from the cradle he is predestined by atavism or disease to misery. I
maintain that he is one of nature's sports, a creature healthy and well
organised, evolved in her superb indifference to aberrations from the
normal type. We need not

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

quarrel over our solutions of the problem. The fact that he is there,
among us, and that he constitutes an ever-present factor in our social
system, has to be faced. How are we to deal with him? Has society the
right to punish individuals sent into the world with homosexual
instincts? Putting the question at its lowest point, admitting that
these persons are the victims of congenital morbidity, ought they to be
treated as criminals? It is established that their appetites, being
innate, are *to them* at least natural and undepraved, the common
appetites, being excluded from their sexual scheme, are *to them*
unnatural and abhorrent. Ought not such beings, instead of being hunted
down and persecuted by legal bloodhounds, to be regarded with pitying
solicitude as among the most unfortunate of human beings, doomed as they
are to inextinguishable longings and life-long deprivation of that which
is the chief prize of man's existence on this planet, a reciprocated
love? As your laws at present stand, you include all cases of sexual
inversion under the one domination of crime. You make exceptions in some
special instances, and treat the men involved as lunatics. But the
Urning is neither criminal nor insane. He is only less fortunate than
you are, through an accident of birth, which is at present obscure to
our imperfect science of sexual determination.

So far Ulrichs is justified in his pleading. When it has been admitted
that sexual inversion is usually a fact of congenital diathesis, the
criminal law stands in no logical relation to the phenomenon. It is
monstrous to punish people as wilfully wicked because, having been born
with the same organs and the same

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

appetites as their neighbours, they are doomed to suffer under the
frightful disability of not being able to use their organs or to gratify
their appetites in the ordinary way.

But here arises a difficulty, which cannot be ignored, since upon it is
based the only valid excuse for the position taken up by society in
dealing with this matter. Not all men and women possessed by abnormal
sexual desires can claim that these are innate. It is certain that the
habits of sodomy are frequently acquired under conditions of exclusion
from the company of persons of the other sex--as in public schools,
barracks, prisons, convents, ships. In some cases they are deliberately
adopted by natures tired of normal sexual pleasure. They may even become
fashionable and epidemic. Lastly, it is probable that curiosity and
imitation communicate them to otherwise normal individuals at a
susceptible moment of development. Therefore society has the right to
say: Those who are the unfortunate subjects of inborn sexual inversion
shall not be allowed to indulge their passions, lest the mischief should
spread, and a vicious habit should contaminate our youth. From the
utilitarian point of view, society is justified in protecting itself
against a minority of exceptional beings whom it regards as pernicious
to the general welfare. From any point of view, the majority is strong
enough to coerce to inborn instincts and to trample on the anguish of a
few unfortunates. But, asks Ulrichs, is this consistent with humanity,
is it consistent with the august ideal of impartial equity? Are people,
sound in body, vigorous in mind, wholesome in habit, capable of generous
affections, good servants of the state, trustworthy

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

in all the ordinary relations of life, to be condemned at law as
criminals because they cannot feel sexually as the majority feel,
because they find some satisfaction for their inborn want in ways which
the majority dislike?

Seeking a solution of the difficulty stated in the foregoing paragraph,
Ulrichs finds it in fact. and history. His answer is that if society
leaves nature to take her course, with the abnormal as well as with the
normal subjects of sexual inclination, society will not suffer. In
countries where legal penalties have been removed from inverted
sexuality, where this is placed upon the same footing as the normal--in
France, Bavaria (?), the Netherlands (?)--no inconvenience has hitherto
arisen. <span id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_60.md) There has ensued no sudden
and flagrant outburst of a depraved habit, no dissemination of a
spreading moral poison. On the other hand, in countries where these
penalties exist and are enforced--in England, for example, and in the
metropolis of England, London--inverted sexuality runs riot, despite of
legal prohibitions, despite of threats of prison, dread of exposure, and
the intolerable pest of organised *chantage*. In the eyes of Ulrichs,
society is engaged in sitting on a safety-valve, which if nature were
allowed to operate unhindered would do society no harm, but rather good.
The majority, he thinks, are not going to become Urnings, for the simple
reason that they have not the

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

unhappy constitution of the Urning. Cease to persecute Urnings, accept
them as inconsiderable, yet real, factors, in the social commonwealth,
leave them to themselves, and you will not be the worse for it, and will
also not carry on your conscience the burden of intolerant
vindictiveness.

Substantiating this position, Ulrichs demonstrates that acquired habits
of sexual inversion are almost invariably thrown off by normal natures.
Your boys at public schools, he says, behave as though they were
Urnings. In the lack of women, at the time when their passions are
predominant, they yield themselves up together to mutual indulgences
which would bring your laws down with terrible effect upon adults. You
are aware of this. You send your sons to Eton and to Harrow. and you
know very well what goes on there. Yet you remain untroubled in your
minds. And why? Because you feel convinced that they will return to
their congenital instincts.

When the school, the barrack, the prison, the ship has been abandoned,
the male reverts to the female. This is the truth about Dionings. The
large majority of men and women remain normal, simply because they were
made normal. They cannot find the satisfaction of their nature in those
inverted practices to which they yielded for a time through want of
normal outlet. Society risks little by the occasional caprice of the
school, the barrack, the prison, and the ship. Some genuine Urnings may,
indeed, discover their inborn inclination by means of the process to
which you subject them. But you are quite right in supposing that a
Dioning, though you have forced him to become for a

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

time an Uraniaster, will never in the long run appear as an Urning. The
extensive experience which English people possess regarding such
matters, owing to the notorious condition of their public schools, goes
to confirm Ulrichs' position. Headmasters know how many Uraniasters they
have dealt with, what excellent Dionings they become, and how
comparatively rare, and yet how incorrigibly steadfast, are the genuine
Urnings in their flock.

The upshot of this matter is that we are continually forcing our young
men into conditions under which, if sexual inversion were an acquired
attribute, it would become stereotyped in their natures. Yet it does not
do so. Provisionally, because they are shut off from girls, because they
find no other outlet for their sex at the moment of its most imperious
claims, they turn toward males, and treat their younger school-fellows
in ways which would consign an adult to penal servitude. They are
Uraniasters by necessity and *faute de mieux*. But no sooner are they
let loose upon the world than the majority revert to normal channels.
They pick up women in the streets, And form connections, as the phrase
goes. Some undoubtedly, in this fiery furnace through which they have
been passed, discover their inborn sexual inversion. Then, when they
cannot resist the ply of their proclivity, you condemn them as criminals
in their later years. Is that just? Would it not be better to revert
from our civilisation to the manners of the savage man--to initiate
youths into the mysteries of sex, and to give each in his turn the
chance of developing a normal instinct by putting him during his time of
puberty freely and frankly to the female? If

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

you abhor Urnings, as you surely do, you are at least responsible for
their mishap by the extraordinary way in which you bring them up. At all
events, when they develop into the eccentric beings which they are, you
are the last people in the world who have any right to punish them with
legal penalties and social obloquy.

Considering the present state of the law in most countries to be
inequitable toward a respectable minority of citizens, Ulrichs proposes
that Urnings should be placed upon the same footing as other men. That
is to say, sexual relations between males and males should not be
treated as criminal, unless they be attended with violence (as in the
case of rape), or be carried on in such a way as to offend the public
sense of decency (in places of general resort or on the open street), or
thirdly be entertained between an adult and a boy under age (the
protected age to be decided as in the case of girls). What he demands is
that when an adult male, freely and of his own consent, complies with
the proposals of an adult person of his own sex, and their intercourse
takes place with due regard for public decency, neither party shall be
liable to prosecution and punishment at law. In fact he would be
satisfied with the same conditions as those prevalent in France, and
since June, 1889, in Italy.

If so much were conceded by the majority of normal people to the
abnormal minority, continues Ulrichs, an immense amount of misery and
furtive vice would be at once abolished. And it is difficult to conceive
what evil results would follow. A defender of the present laws of
England, Prussia, &c., might indeed reply: "This is opening a free way
to the seduction and corruption of young

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

men." But young men are surely at least as capable of defending
themselves against seduction and corruption as young women are. Nay,
they are far more able, not merely because they are stronger, but
because they are not usually weakened by an overpowering sexual instinct
on which the seducer plays. Yet the seduction and corruption of young
women is tolerated, in spite of the attendant consequences of
illegitimate childbirth, and all which that involves. This toleration of
the seduction of women by men springs from the assumption that only the
normal sexual appetite is natural. The seduction of a man by a male
passes for criminal, because the inverted sexual instinct is regarded as
unnatural, depraved, and wilfully perverse. On the hypothesis that
individuals subject to. perverted instincts can suppress them at
pleasure or convert them into normal appetite, it is argued that they
must be punished. But when the real facts come to be studied, it will be
found: first, that these instincts are inborn in Urnings, and are
therefore in their case natural; secondly, that the suppression of them
is tantamount to life-long abstinence under the constant torture of
sexual solicitation; thirdly, that the conversion of them into normal
channels is in a large percentage of cases totally impossible, in nearly
all where it has been attempted is only partially successful, and where
marriage ensues has generally ended in misery for both parties. Ulrichs,
it will be noticed, does not distinguish between Urnings, in whom the
inversion is admitted to be congenital, and Uraniasters, in whom it has
been acquired or deliberately adopted. And it would be very difficult to
frame laws which should take cognisance of these two classes. The Code

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Napoleon legalises the position of both,
theoretically at any rate. The English code treats both as criminal,
doing thereby, it must be admitted, marked injustice to recognised
Urnings, who at the worst are morbid or insane, or sexually deformed,
through no fault of their own.

In the present state of things, adds Ulrichs, the men who yield their
bodies to abnormal lovers, do not merely do so out of compliance,
sympathy, or the desire for reasonable reward. Too often they speculate
upon the illegality of the connection, and have their main object in the
extortion of money by threats of exposure. Thus the very basest of all
trades, that of *chantage*, is encouraged by the law. Alter the law, and
instead of increasing vice, you will diminish it; for a man who should
then meet the advances of an Urning, would do so out of compliance, or,
as is the case with female prostitutes, upon the expectation of a
reasonable gain. The temptation to ply a disgraceful profession with the
object of extorting money would be removed. More over, as regards
individuals alike abnormally constituted, voluntary and mutually
satisfying relations, free from degrading risks, and possibly permanent,
might be formed between responsible agents. Finally, if it be feared
that the removal of legal disabilities would turn the whole male
population into Urnings, consider whether London is now so much purer in
this respect than Paris?

One serious objection to recognising and tolerating sexual inversion has
always been that it tends to check the population. This was a sound
political and social argument in the time of Moses, when a small and

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

militant tribe needed to multiply to the full extent of its procreative
capacity. It is by no means so valid in our age, when the habitable
portions of the globe are rapidly becoming overcrowded. <span
id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_61.md) Moreover, we must bear in mind that
society, under the existing order, sanctions female prostitution,
whereby men and women, the normally procreative, are sterilised to an
indefinite extent. Logic, in these circumstances, renders it equitable
and ridiculous to deny a sterile exercise of sex to abnormal men and
women, who are by instinct and congenital diathesis non-procreative.

As the result of these considerations, Ulrichs concludes that there is
no real ground for the persecution of Urnings except as may be found in
the repugnance by the vast numerical majority for an insignificant
minority. The majority encourages matrimony, condones seduction,
sanctions prostitution, legalises divorce in the interests of its own
sexual proclivities. It makes

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

temporary or permanent unions illegal for the minority whose inversion
of instinct it abhors. And this persecution, in the popular mind at any
rate, is justified, like many other inequitable acts of prejudice or
ignorance, by theological assumptions and the so-called mandates of
revelation.

In the next place it is objected that inversed sexuality is demoralising
to the manhood of a nation, that it degrades the dignity of a man, and
that it is incapable of moral elevation. Each of these points may be
taken separately. They are all of them at once and together contradicted
by the history of ancient Greece. There the most warlike sections of the
race, the Dorians of Crete and Sparta, and the Thebans, organised the
love of male for male because of the social and military advantages they
found in it. Their annals abound in eminent instances of heroic
enthusiasm, patriotic devotion, and high living, inspired by homosexual
passion.

The fighting peoples of the world, Kelts in ancient story, Normans,
Turks, Afghans, Albanians, Tartars, have been distinguished by the
frequency among them of what popular prejudice regards as an effeminate
vice. With regard to the dignity of man, is there, asks Ulrichs,
anything more degrading to humanity in sexual acts performed between
male and male than in similar acts performed between male and female, In
a certain sense all sex has an element of grossness which inspires
repugnance. The gods, says Swinburne,

"Have strewed one marriage-bed with tears and fire,  
For extreme loathing and supreme desire."

\[paragraph continues\] It would not be easy to maintain that a curate
begetting his fourteenth baby on the body of a worn-out wife, is

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

a more elevating object of mental contemplation than Harmodius in the
embrace of Aristogeiton, or that a young man sleeping with a prostitute
picked up in the Haymarket is cleaner than his brother sleeping with a
soldier picked up in the Park. Much of this talk about the dignity of
man, says Ulrichs, proceeds from a vulgar misconception as to the nature
of inverted sexual desire. People assume that Urnings seek their
pleasure only or mainly in an act of unmentionable indecency. The exact
opposite, he assures them, is the truth. The act in question is no
commoner between men and men than it is between men and women. Ulrichs,
upon this point, may be suspected, perhaps, as an untrustworthy witness.
His testimony, however, is confirmed by Krafft-Ebing, who, as we have
seen, has studied sexual inversion long and minutely from the point of
view of psychical pathology. "As regards the nature of their sexual
gratification," he writes, "it must be established at the outset that
the majority of them are contented with reciprocal embraces; the act
commonly ascribed to them they generally abhor as much as normal men do;
and, inasmuch as they always prefer adults, they are in no sense
specially, dangerous to boys." <span id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_62.md) This
author proceeds to draw a distinction between Urnings in whom sexual
inversion is congenital, and old debauchees or half-idiotic individuals,
who are in the habit of misusing boys. The vulgar have confounded two
different classes; and everybody who

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

studies the psychology of Urnings is aware that this involves a grave
injustice to the latter.

"But, after all," continues the objector, "you cannot show that inverted
sexuality is capable of any moral elevation." Without appealing to
antiquity, the records of which confute this objection overwhelmingly,
one might refer to the numerous passages in Ulrich's writings where he
relates the fidelity, [loyalty](errata.htm#4.md), self-sacrifice, and
romantic enthusiasm which frequently accompany such loves, and raises
them above baseness. But, since here again he may be considered a
suspicious witness, it will suffice, as before, to translate a brief
passage from Krafft-Ebing. "The Urning loves, idolizes his friend, quite
as much as the normal man loves and idolizes his girl. He is capable of
making for him the greatest sacrifices. He suffers the pangs of unhappy,
often unreturned, affection; feels jealousy, mourns under the fear of
his friend's infidelity." <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63.md) When the
time comes for speaking about Walt Whitman's treatment of this topic, it
will appear that the passion of a man for his comrade has been idealised
in fact and deed, as well as in poetry. For the present it is enough to
remark that a kind of love, however spontaneous and powerful, which is
scouted, despised, tabooed, banned, punished, relegated to holes and
corners, cannot be expected to show its best side to the world. The
sense of sin and crime and danger, the humiliation and repression and
distress to which the unfortunate pariahs of inverted sexuality are
daily and hourly exposed must inevitably deteriorate the nobler elements
in their emotion. Give

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

abnormal love the same chance as normal love, subject it to the
wholesome control of public opinion, allow it to be self-respecting,
draw it from dark slums into the light of day, strike off its chains and
set it free--and I am confident, says Ulrichs, that it will exhibit
analogous virtues, checkered, of course, by analogous vices, to those
with which you are familiar in the mutual love of male and female. The
slave has of necessity a slavish soul. The way to elevate is to
emancipate him.

"All that may be true," replies the objector it is even possible that
society will take the hard case of your Urnings into consideration, and
listen to their bitter cry. But, in the meanwhile, supposing these
inverted instincts to be inborn, supposing them to be irrepressible and
inconvertible, supposing them to be less dirty and nasty than they are
commonly considered, is it not the plain duty of the individual to
suppress them, so long as the law of his country condemns them? "No,
rejoins Ulrichs, a thousand times no! It is only the ignorant antipathy
of the majority which renders such law as you speak of possible. Go to
the best books of medical jurisprudence, go to the best authorities on
psychical deviations from the normal [type](errata.htm#5.md). You will find
that these support me in my main contention. These, though hostile in
their sentiments and chilled by natural repugnance, have a respect for
science, and they agree with me in saying that the Urning came into this
world an Urning, and must remain till the end of his life an Urning
still. To deal with him according to your code is no less monstrous than
if you were to punish the colour-blind, or the deaf and dumb, or
albinoes, or crooked-back cripples. "Very well," answers the

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

objector: "But I will quote the words of an eloquent living writer, and
appeal to your generous instincts and your patriotism. Professor Dowden
observes that 'self-surrender is at times sternly enjoined, and if the
egoistic desires are brought into conflict with social duties, the
individual life and joy within us, at whatever cost of personal
suffering, must be sacrificed to the just claims of our fellows.' <span
id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64.md) What have you to say to that?" In the
first place, replies Ulrichs, I demur in this case to the phrases
*egoistic desires, social duties, just claims of our fellows*. I
maintain that in trying to rehabilitate men of' my own stamp and to
justify their natural right to toleration I am not egoistic. It is
begging the question to. stigmatise their inborn desire as selfish. The
social duties of which you speak are not duties, but compliances to law
framed in blindness and prejudice. The claims of our fellows, to which
you appeal, are not just, but cruelly inequitous. My insurgence against
all these things makes me act indeed as an innovator; and I may be
condemned, as a consequence of my rashness, to persecution, exile,
defamation, proscription. But let me remind you that Christ was
crucified, and that he is now regarded as a benefactor. "Stop," breaks
in the objector: "We need not bring most sacred names into this
discussion. I admit that innovators have done the greatest service to
society. But you have not proved that you are working for the salvation
of humanity at large. Would it not be better to remain quiet, and to
sacrifice your life and joy, the life and joy of an avowed minority, for
the sake of the immense majority who

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

cannot tolerate you, and who dread your innovation? The Catholic
priesthood is vowed to celibacy; and unquestionably there are some adult
men in that order who have trampled out the imperious appetite of the
male for the female. What they do for the sake of their vow will not you
accomplish, when you have so much of good to gain, of evil to escape?"
What good, what evil? rejoins Ulrichs. You are again begging the
question; and now you are making appeals to my selfishness, my personal
desire for tranquillity, my wish to avoid persecution and shame. I have
taken no vow of celibacy. If I have taken any vow at all, it is to fight
for the rights of an innocent, harmless, downtrodden group of outraged
personalities. The cross of a Crusade is sewn upon the sleeve of my
right arm. To expect from me and from my fellows the renouncement
voluntarily undertaken by a Catholic priest is an absurdity, when we
join no order, have no faith to uphold, no ecclesiastical system to
support. We maintain that we have the right to exist after the fashion
in which nature made us. And if we cannot alter your laws, we shall go
on breaking them. You may condemn us to infamy, exile, prison--as you
formerly burned witches. You may degrade our emotional instincts and
drive us into vice and misery. But you will not eradicate inverted
sexuality. Expel nature with a fork, and you know what happens. "That is
enough," says the objector: "We had better close this conversation. I am
sorry for you, sorry that you will not yield to sense and force. The
Urning must be punished."

<span id="fn_55"></span>[89:1](pme10.htm#fr_55.md) The notion that human
beings were originally hermaphrodite is both ancient and widespread. We
find it in the Book of Genesis, unless, indeed, there be a confusion
here between two separate theories of creation. God is said to have
first made man in his own image, male and female in one body, and to
have bidden them multiply. Later on he created the woman out of part of
the primitive man. The myth related by Aristophanes in Plato's
*Symposium* has a curious bearing upon Ulrichs' speculations. There were
originally human beings of three sexes: men, the children of the sun;
women, the children of the earth; and hermaphrodites, the children of
the moon. They were round, with two faces, four hands, four feet and two
sets of reproductive organs apiece. In the case of the third sex, one
set was male, the other female. Zeus, on account of their strength and
insolence, sliced them into halves. Since that time the halves of each
sort have always striven to unite with their <span id="page_90">p.
90</span> corresponding halves, and have found some satisfaction in
carnal congress--males with males, females with females, and males and
females with each other: "They who are a section of the male follow the
male, and while they are young, being slices of the original man, they
hang about men and embrace them, and they are themselves the best of
boys and youths, because they have the most manly nature. And when they
reach manhood, they are lovers of youth, and are not naturally inclined
to marry or beget children, which they do, if at all, only in obedience
to the law, but they are satisfied if they may be allowed to live with
one another unwedded; and such a nature is prone to love and ready to
return love, always embracing that which is akin to him." (Symp. 191-2,
Jowett's translation.) Then follows a glowing description of Greek Love,
the whole reminding us very closely of the confessions made by Urnings
in modern times, and preserved by medical or forensic writers on sexual
inversion.

is not the result of an evolutionary process arriving through heredity
and casual selection at an abnormal, but not of necessity a morbid,

<span id="fn_60"></span>[102:1](pme10.htm#fr_60.md) Since Ulrichs left off
writing, Italy (by the "Nuove Codice Penale" of 1889) has adopted the
principles of the Code Napoleon, and has placed sexual inversion under
the same legal limitations as the normal sexual instinct.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[108:1](pme10.htm#fr_61.md) Dr. W. Ogle, on the
18th March, 1890, read a paper before the Statistical Society upon
"Marriage Rates and Ages." The conclusion he arrived at, with regard to
the rapidly-advancing overpopulation of England, was that, in order to
equalise the death-rate with the birth-rate (or in other words, to
maintain the population at its present level), we must look forward
either to (1) an increase of emigration which would involve social
revolution, or (2) to the advance of the average age at which women
marry to the point of thirty years, or (3) to an exclusion of 45 per
cent. of those who now marry from matrimony at any period of life. In
the face of these calculations, after admitting their possible
exaggeration, it seems illogical to punish with severe legal penalties
those members of the male sex who do not want to marry, and who can
satisfy their natural desires in ways which involve no detriment to the
State and no violation of the rights of individuals.
