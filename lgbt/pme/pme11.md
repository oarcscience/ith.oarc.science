### VIII.

### LITERATURE--IDEALISTIC.

To speak of Walt Whitman at all in connection with Ulrichs and sexual
inversion seems paradoxical. At the outset it must be definitely stated
that he has nothing to do with anomalous, abnormal, vicious, or diseased
forms of the emotion which males entertain for males. Yet no man in the
modern world has expressed so strong a conviction that "manly
attachment," "athletic love," "the high towering love of comrades," is a
main factor in human life, a virtue upon which society will have to
rest, and a passion equal in its permanence and intensity to sexual
affection.

He assumes, without raising the question, that the love of man for man
co-exists with the love of man for woman in one and the same individual.
The relation of the two modes of feeling is clearly stated in this
poem:--

"Fast-anchored, eternal, O love! O woman I love  
O bride! O wife! More resistless than I can tell, the thought of you

Then separate, as disembodied, or another born,  
Ethereal, the last athletic reality, my consolation  
I ascend--I float in the regions of your love, O man,  
O sharer of my roving life."

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

Neuropathical Urnings are not hinted at in any passage of his works. As
his friend and commentator Mr. Burroughs puts it: "The sentiment is
primitive, athletic, taking form in all manner of large and homely
out-of-door images, and springs, as anyone may see, directly from the
heart and experience of the poet."

This being so, Whitman never suggests that comradeship may occasion the
development of physical desires. But then he does not in set terms
condemn these desires, or warn his disciples against them. To a Western
boy he says:--

"If you be not silently selected by lovers, and do not silently seek
lovers,  
Of what use is it that you seek to become eleve of mine."

Like Plato, in the Phædrus, Whitman describes an enthusiastic type of
masculine emotion, leaving its private details to the moral sense and
special inclination of the person concerned. <span
id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65.md)

The language of "Calamus" (that section of "Leaves of Grass" which is
devoted to the gospel of comradeship) has a passionate glow, a warmth of
emotional

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

tone, beyond anything to which the modern world is used in the
celebration of the love of friends. It recalls to our mind the early
Greek enthusiasm--that fellowship in arms which flourished among Dorian
tribes, and made a chivalry for prehistoric Hellas. Nor does the poet
himself appear to be unconscious that there are dangers and difficulties
involved in the highly-pitched emotions he is praising. The whole tenor
of two mysterious compositions, entitled "Whoever you are, Holding me
now in Hand," and "Trickle, Drops," suggests an underlying sense of
spiritual conflict. The following poem, again, is sufficiently
significant and typical to call for literal transcription:--

"Earth, my likeness!  
Though you look so impressive, ample and spheric here,  
I now suspect that is not all;  
I now suspect there is something fierce in you, eligible to burst
forth;  
For an athletic is enamoured of me--and I of him,  
But toward him there is something fierce and terrible in me, eligible to
burst forth,  
I dare not tell it in words--not even in these songs."

\[paragraph continues\] The reality of Whitman's feeling, the intense
delight which he derives from the personal presence and physical contact
of a beloved man, find expression in "A Glimpse," "Recorders ages
hence," "When I heard at the Close of Day," "I saw in Louisiana a Live
Oak growing," "Long I thought that Knowledge alone would content
me," <span id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_66.md) "O Tan-faced Prairie Boy," and
"Vigil Strange I kept on the Field one Night." <span
id="fr_67"></span>[2](#fn_67.md)

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

It is clear, then, that in his treatment of comradeship, or the
impassioned love of man for man, Whitman has struck a keynote, to the
emotional intensity of which the modern world is unaccustomed. It
therefore becomes of much importance to discover the poet-prophet's
*Stimmung*--his radical instinct with regard to the moral quality of the
feeling he encourages. Studying his works by their own light, and by the
light of their author's character, interpreting each part by reference
to the whole and in the spirit of the whole, an impartial critic will, I
think, be drawn to the conclusion that what he calls the "adhesiveness"
of comradeship is meant to have no interblending with the "amativeness"
of sexual love. Personally, it is undeniable that Whitman possesses a
specially keen sense of the fine restraint and continence, the
cleanliness and chastity, that are inseparable from the perfectly virile
and physically complete nature of healthy manhood. Still, we may
predicate the same ground-qualities in the early Dorians, those martial
founders of the institution of Greek Love; and it is notorious to
students of Greek civilisation that the lofty sentiment of their
chivalry was intertwined with singular anomalies in its historical
development.

To remove all doubt about Whitman's own intentions when he composed
"Calamus," and promulgated his doctrine of impassioned comradeship, I
wrote to him, frankly posing the questions which perplexed my mind. The
answer I received, dated Camden, New Jersey, U.S.A., August 19, 1890,
and which he permits me to make use of, puts the matter beyond all
debate, and confirms the conclusions to which I had been led by
criticism. He writes as follows: "About the questions

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

on 'Calamus,' &c., they quite daze me. 'Leaves of Grass' is only to be
rightly construed by and within its own atmosphere and essential
character--all its pages and pieces so coming strictly under. That the
Calamus part has ever allowed the possibility of such construction as
mentioned is terrible. I am fain to hope the pages themselves are not to
be even mentioned for such gratuitous and quite at the time undreamed
and unwished possibility of morbid inferences--which are disavowed by me
and seem damnable."

No one who knows anything about Wait Whitman will for a moment doubt his
candour and sincerity. Therefore the man who wrote "Calamus," and
preached the gospel of comradeship, entertains feelings at least as
hostile to sexual inversion as any law-abiding humdrum Anglo-Saxon could
desire. It is obvious that he has not even taken the phenomena of
abnormal instinct into account. Else he must have foreseen that, human
nature being what it is, we cannot expect to eliminate all sexual alloy
from emotions raised to a high pitch of passionate intensity, and that
permanent elements within the midst of our society will emperil the
absolute purity of the ideal he attempts to establish.

These considerations do not, however, affect the spiritual nature of
that ideal. After acknowledging, what Whitman has omitted to perceive,
that there are inevitable points of contact between sexual inversion and
his doctrine of comradeship, the question now remains whether he has not
suggested the way whereby abnormal instincts may be moralised and raised
to higher value. In other words, are those instincts provided in
"Calamus" with the means of their salvation

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

from the filth and mire of brutal appetite? It is difficult to answer
this question; for the issue involved is nothing less momentous than the
possibility of evoking a new chivalrous enthusiasm, analogous to that of
primitive Hellenic society, from emotions which are at present
classified among the turpitudes of human nature.

Let us look a little closer at the expression which Whitman has given to
his own feelings about friendship. The first thing that strikes us is
the mystic emblem he has chosen for masculine love. That is the
water-plant, or scented rush, called Calamus, which springs in wild
places, "in paths untrodden, in the growth by margins of pond-waters" He
has chosen these "emblematic and capricious blades" because of their
shyness, their aromatic perfume, their aloofness from the patent life of
the world. He calls them "sweet leaves, pink-tinged roots, timid
leaves," scented herbage of my breast." Finally, he says:-- <span
id="fr_68"></span>[1](#fn_68.md)

"Here my last words, and the most baffling,  
Here the frailest leaves of me, and yet my strongest-lasting,  
Here I shade down and hide my thoughts--I do not expose them,  
And yet they expose me more than all my other poems."

The manliness of the emotion, which is thus so shyly, mystically
indicated, appears in the magnificent address to soldiers at the close
of the great war: "Over the Carnage rose Prophetic a Voice." <span
id="fr_69"></span>[2](#fn_69.md) Its tenderness emerges in the elegy on a
slain comrade:-- <span id="fr_70"></span>[3](#fn_70.md)

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

Vigil for boy of responding kisses (never again on earth responding)  
Vigil for comrade swiftly slain-vigil I never forget, how as day
brightened,  
I rose from the chill ground, and folded my soldier well in his
blanket,  
And buried him where he fell."

Its pathos and clinging intensity transpire through the first lines of
the following piece, which may have been suggested by the legends of
David and Jonathan, Achilles and Patroclus, Oretes and Pylades:-- <span
id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_71.md)

"When I pursue the conquered fame of heroes, and the victories of mighty
generals,  
I do not envy the generals,  
Nor the president in his Presidency, nor the rich in his great house;  
But when I read of the brotherhood of lovers, how it was with them,  
How through life, through dangers, odium, unchanging, long and long.  
Through youth, and through middle and old age, how unfaltering, how
affectionate and faithful they were,  
Then I am pensive--I hastily put down the book, and walk away, filled
with the bitterest envy."

But Whitman does not conceive of comradeship as a merely personal
possession, delightful to the friends it links in bonds of amity. He
regards it essentially as a social and political virtue. This human
emotion is destined to cement society and to render commonwealths
inviolable. Reading some of his poems, we are carried back to ancient
Greece--to Plato's Symposium, to

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Philip gazing on the Sacred Band of Thebans
after the fight at Chaeronea. <span id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_72.md)

"I dream'd in a dream, I saw a city invincible to the attacks of the
whole of the rest of the earth  
I dream'd that was the new City of Friends;  
Nothing was greater there than the quality of robust love--it led the
rest  
It was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city, And in
all their looks and words."

And again:-- <span id="fr_73"></span>[2](#fn_73.md)

"I believe the main purport of these States is to found a superb
friendship, exalté, previously unknown,  
Because I perceive it waits, and has been always waiting, latent in all
men."

And once again:-- <span id="fr_74"></span>[3](#fn_74.md)

"Come, I will make the continent indissoluble;  
I will make the most splendid race the sun ever yet shone upon;  
I will make divine magnetic lands,  
              With the love of comrades,  
           With the life-long love of comrades.  
I will plant companionship thick as trees all along the shores of
America, and along the shores of the great lakes, and all over the
prairies;  
I will make inseparable cities, with their arms about each other's
necks  
                   By the love of comrades,  
                By the manly love of comrades.  
For you these from me, O Democracy, to serve you ma femme!  
For you, for you I am thrilling these songs."

In the company of Walt Whitman we are very far away from Gibbon and
Carlier, from Tardieux and

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Casper-Liman, from Krafft-Ebing and Ulrichs.
What indeed has this "superb friendship, exalté, previously unknown,"
which "waits. and has been always waiting, latent in all men," that
"something fierce in me, eligible to burst forth," "ethereal
comradeship," "the last athletic reality"--what has all this in common
with the painful topic of the preceding sections of my Essay?

It has this in common with it. Whitman recognises among the sacred
emotions and social virtues, destined to regenerate political life and
to cement nations, an intense, jealous, throbbing, sensitive, expectant
love of man for man: a love which yearns in absence, droops under the
sense of neglect, revives at the return of the beloved; a love that
finds honest delight in hand-touch, meeting lips, hours of privacy,
close personal contact. He proclaims this love to be not only a daily
fact in the present, but also a saving and ennobling aspiration. While
he expressly repudiates, disowns, and brands as "damnable" all "morbid
inferences" which may be drawn by malevolence or vicious cunning from
his doctrine, he is prepared to extend the gospel of comradeship to the
whole human race. He expects Democracy, the new social and political
medium, the new religious ideal of mankind, to develop and extend "that
fervid comradeship," and by its means to counterbalance and to
spiritualise what is vulgar and materialistic in the modern world.
"Democracy," he maintains, "infers such loving comradeship, as its most
inevitable twin or counterpart, without which it will be incomplete, in
vain, and incapable of perpetuating itself." <span
id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75.md)

If this be not a dream, if he is right in believing that

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "threads of manly friendship, fond and loving,
pure and sweet, strong and life-long, carried to degrees hitherto
unknown," will penetrate the organism of society, "not only giving tone
to individual character, and making it unprecedentedly emotional,
muscular, heroic, and refined, but having deepest relations to general
politics"--then are we perhaps justified in foreseeing here the advent
of an enthusiasm which shall rehabilitate those outcast instincts, by
giving them a spiritual atmosphere, an environment of recognised and
healthy emotions, wherein to expand at liberty and purge away the
grossness and the madness of their pariahdom?

This prospect, like all ideals, until they are realised in experience,
may seem fantastically visionary. Moreover, the substance of human
nature is so mixed that it would perhaps be fanatical to expect from
Whitman's chivalry of "adhesiveness" a more immaculate purity than was
attained by the mediæval chivalry of "amativeness." Still that mediæval
chivalry, the great emotional product of feudalism, though it fell short
of its own aspiration, bequeathed incalculable good to modern society by
refining. and clarifying the crudest of male appetites. In like manner,
the democratic chivalry, announced by Whitman, may be destined to
absorb, control, and elevate those darker, more mysterious, apparently
abnormal appetites, which we have seen to be widely diffused and
ineradicable in the ground-work of human nature.

Returning from the dream, the vision of a future possibility, it will at
any rate be conceded that Whitman has founded comradeship, the
enthusiasm which binds man to man in fervent love, upon a natural basis.
Eliminating classical associations of corruption,

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

ignoring the perplexed questions of a guilty passion doomed by law and
popular antipathy to failure, he begins anew with sound and primitive
humanity. There he discovers "a superb friendship, exalté, previously
unknown." He perceives that "it waits, and has been always waiting,
latent in all men." His method of treatment, fearless and uncowed by any
thought of evil, his touch upon the matter, chaste and wholesome and
aspiring, reveal the possibility of restoring in all innocence to human
life a portion of its alienated or unclaimed moral birthright. The
aberrations we have been discussing in this treatise are perhaps the
morbid symptoms of suppression, of hypertrophy, of ignorant
misregulation, in a genuine emotion capable of being raised to good by
sympathetic treatment.

It were well to close upon this note. The half, as the Greeks said, is
more than the whole; and the time has not yet come to raise the question
whether the love of man for man shall be elevated through a hitherto
unapprehended chivalry to nobler powers, even as the barbarous love of
man for woman once was. This question at the present moment is deficient
in actuality. The world cannot be invited to entertain it. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_65"></span>[116:1](pme11.htm#fr_65.md) In this relation it is
curious to note what one of Casper-Liman's correspondents says about the
morals of North America (*op. cit.*, vol. i. p. 173). "Half a year after
my return I went to North America, to try my fortune. There the
unnatural vice in question is more ordinary than it is here; and I was
able to indulge my passions with less fear of punishment or persecution.
The American's tastes in this matter resemble my own; and I discovered,
in the United States, that I was always immediately recognised as a
member of the confraternity." The date of this man's visit to America
was the year 1871-72 He had just returned from serving as a volunteer in
the great Franco-German war of 1870-71.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[125:1](pme11.htm#fr_76.md) While these sheets were
going through the press, I communicated Whitman's reply to a judicious
friend, whose remarks upon it express my own opinion more clearly and
succinctly than I have done above: "I do not feel that this answer
throws light on the really interesting question; does the sentiment of
'Calamus' represent, in its own way, the ideal which we should aim at
impressing on passionate affections between men, as certainly liable to
take other objectionable forms? Is there sufficient affinity between the
actual and the ideal for this to be practicable? That is what I have
never felt sure about when we have discussed these matters. But I do not
feel that my doubts have been resolved in any negative direction by Wait
Whitman."
