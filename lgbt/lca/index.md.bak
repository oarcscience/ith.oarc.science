This short book of essays by Edward Carpenter is a look at gender roles
at the start of the 20th century, and his prescient vision of how those
roles might evolve. In the past century many of his then-utopian
predictions have come to pass, such as rational sexual education,
greater equality for women, recognition of a spectrum of sexual
identities, widespread acceptance of trial and open relationships, and
the amelioration of the stifling nature of traditional marriage. Some of
these predictions, inevitably, such as the use of 'Karezza' (extended
coitus without ejaculation) for contraception, and a communist society
leading to the liberation of women from the drudgery of housework, have
fallen flat.

One becomes aware of some peculiar facts that don't usually emerge from
studies of social history, *e.g.*, women of a century ago spent a *lot*
of time baking bread and mending clothes. Carpenter occasionally draws
on some dubious science, tainted by 19th century prudery and attitudes
about women. However, for the most part, he scores some very good points
which are still relevant.

Carpenter is primarily known as a pioneering writer on gay liberation.
While the focus of this work is not primarily on gay issues, Carpenter
wrote several other books which dealt with this subject, including
[Intermediate Types Among Primitive Folk](../itp/index.md) and [Ioläus, An
Anthology of Friendship](../iol/index.md), both also available at this
website. This particular book appears for the first time on the Internet
here at Intangible Textual Heritage.
