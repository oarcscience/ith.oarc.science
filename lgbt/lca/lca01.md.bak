\[*The little god of Love is general represented as a child; and rightly
perhaps, considering the erratic character of his ways among the human
race. There are signs however of a new order in the relations of the

indicate the inner laws which, rather than the outer, may guide Love
when--some day--he shall have come to his full estate*.\]
