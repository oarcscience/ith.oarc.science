# ON PREVENTIVE CHECKS TO POPULATION

This is no doubt a complex and difficult subject. Nature from far back
time has provided in the most determined and obstinate way for the
perpetuation of organic life, and has endowed animals, and even plants,
with a strong sexual instinct. By natural selection this instinct tends,
it would seem, to be accentuated; and in the higher animals and man it
sometimes attains a pitch almost of ferocity. In civilised man this
effect is further increased by the intensity of consciousness, which
reflects desire on itself, as well as by collateral conditions of life
and luxury.

In the animal and plant world generally, and up to the realm of Man,
Nature appears to be perfectly lavish in the matter, and careless of the
waste of seed and of life that may ensue, provided her object of
race-propagation is attained; and naturally when the time arrives that
Man, objecting to this waste, faces up to the problem, he finds it no
easy one to solve.

And not only Man (the male) objects to lower

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Nature's method of producing superfluous
individuals only to kill them off again in the struggle for existence;
but Woman objects to being a mere machine for perpetual reproduction.

For meeting this difficulty, the only way commonly proposed--short of a
continence and self-control almost amounting to total abstinence--is the
adoption of some kind of artificial preventatives to conception. But it
must be acknowledged that artificial checks to population are for the
most part very unsatisfactory. Their uncertainty, their desperate
matter-of-factness, so fatal to real feeling, the probability that they
are in one way or another dangerous or harmful, and then their
one-sidedness, since here-as so often in matters of sex--the man's
satisfaction is largely at the cost of the woman: all these things are
against them. One method however--that which consists in selecting, for
sexual congress, a certain part of the woman's monthly cycle, can hardly
be called artificial, and is altogether the least open to the objections
cited. Its success truly is not absolutely certain, but is perhaps
sufficiently nearly so for the general purpose of regulating the family;
and if the method involves some self-control, it does not at any rate
make an impracticable demand in that direction.

There is also another method which, while it may

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

seem at first to demand considerable self-control, does really perhaps
in the end yield fuller satisfaction than any. Late authors have pointed
out that a distinction can and should be made between sexual intercourse
for the definite purpose of race-propagation and sexual intercourse for
simple union--that, in fact, the methods are different. Mrs. A. B.
Stockham, in her little book "Karezza" (Stockham Publishing Co.,
Chicago), dwells on this subject. She indicates that for the latter
purpose, *i.e.*, union, there may be complete and indeed prolonged
bodily conjunction; but the whole process being kept (by the use of a
certain amount of physical control) on the emotional plane and the plane
of endearment and affection, there need be no actual emission, and the
final orgasm may be avoided. "Given abundant time and mutual
reciprocity, the interchange becomes satisfactory and complete without
emission or crisis by either party." The result of this is really a more
complete *soul-union*, a strange and intoxicating exchange of life, and
transmutation of elements. "The whole being of each is submerged in the
other, and an exquisite exaltation experienced. . . . In the course of
an hour the physical tension subsides, the spiritual exaltation
increases, and not uncommonly visions of a transcendent life are seen,
and consciousness of new powers

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

experienced." This "gives to the sexual relation an office entirely
distinct from the propagative act--it is a union on the affectional
plane, but at the same time it is a preparation for best possible
conditions for procreation."

The importance of this distinction of the generative act from the act of
union or conjunction can hardly be overrated. The two things have
hitherto been undifferentiated. Though it may not be easy at once to
establish the mental and other conditions necessary for the latter, yet
they can be established; and the result is an avoidance of waste, and a
great economy of vital forces--on the one side a more profound, helpful
and satisfying union, and on the other a greater energy for procreation,
when that is desired. We cannot help thinking that it is along this line
that the solution of the marriage and population problem will, in time,
be found. The overhanging dread of undesired child-birth, which so
oppresses the life of many a young mother, will be removed; and marriage
will be liberated at last from the tyranny of a brute need into the free
and pleasurable exercise of a human and intelligent relationship.

# APPENDIX

PAGE <span id="xref_1">1</span>.--"*Natural reticence*."

SEX belongs to the Unconscious or universal-conscious regions of our
nature (which is the meaning perhaps of Modesty), and will resume its
place there some day. Meanwhile, having crept into the Conscious, it
must for the time being be sincerely faced there.

PAGE <span id="xref_9">9</span>.--"*To teach the child first, quite
openly, its physical relation to its own mother*."

"IT was not without much anxiety that I took the first step on a road I
intended to explore alone. Chance favoured me. I was in Java, and
amongst my servants was a dressmaker, married to the groom. This woman
had a dear little baby with a velvety brown skin and bright black eyes,
the admiration of my little daughter, whom I took with me to see mother
and child. when the baby was a few days old. While she admired and
petted it wonderingly, I said to her: 'This pretty little baby came out
of Djahid like the beautiful butterfly came out of the chrysalis, it lay
close to Djahid's heart, she made it, and kept it there till it grew.
She loved It so much that she made it grow.' Lilly looked at me with her
large, intelligent eyes in astonishment. 'Djahid is very happy to have
this pretty baby. Djahid's blood made it strong while it lay close to
her heart; now Djahid will give it milk, and make it strong, till it
will grow as big as my Lilly.

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

\[paragraph continues\] It made Djahid ill and made her suffer when it
was born, but she soon got well. and she is so glad.' Lilly listened,
very much interested, and when she got home, she told her father the
story, forgetting nothing. But beyond that, she did not refer again to
the matter, and soon forgot all about it. The birth of Djahid's second
baby gave me the opportunity of repeating the little lesson. This time
she asked some questions. I explained many things to the eager little
listener, very simply, and told her that the mother kept the child
within her. and took great care of it until it was old enough to endure
the changes of temperature, etc., and showed her how a mother's joy and
love made her forget her pain. The little creature, suddenly remembering
that she must have given *her* mother pain, kissed me tenderly. That was
a flower of love and gratitude, which it was my happiness to see develop
on the fruitful soil of truth . . . . . I analysed a flower, I pointed
out to her the beauty of colouring, the gracefulness of shape, the
tender shades, the difference between the parts composing the flowers.
Gradually, I told her what these parts were called. I showed her the
pollen, which clung like a beautiful golden powder to her little rosy
fingers. I showed her through the microscope that this beautiful powder
was composed of an infinite number of small grains. I made her examine
the pistil more closely, and I showed her, at the end of the tube, the
ovary, which I called a 'little house full of very tiny children.' I
showed her the pollen glued to the pistil, and I told her that when the
pollen of one flower, carried away by the wind, or by the insects, fell
on the pistil of another flower, the small grains died, and a tiny drop
of moisture passed through the tube and entered into the little house
where the very tiny children dwelt; that

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

these tiny children were like. small eggs, that in each small egg there
was an almost invisible opening, through which a little of the small
drop passed; that when this drop of pollen mixed with some other
wonderful power in the ovary, that both joined together to give life,
and the eggs developed and became grains or fruit. I have shown her
flowers which had only a pistil and others which had only stamens. I
said to her, smiling, that the pistils were like little mothers, and the
stamens like little fathers of the fruit . . . . . . Thus I sowed in
this innocent heart and searching mind the seeds of that delicate
science, which degenerates into obscenity, if the mother, through false
shame, leaves the instruction of her child to its schoolfellows. Let my
little girl ask me, if she likes, the much dreaded question; I will only
have to remind her of the botany lessons, simply adding, 'the same thing
happens to human beings, with this difference, that what is done
unconsciously by the plants, is done consciously by us; that in a
properly arranged society one only unites one's self to the person one
loves.'"--(Translated from "*La Revendication des Droits Féminins*,"
*Shafts*, *April*, *1894*, p. 237)

PAGE <span id="xref_11">11</span>.--"*The vulgarisation of love*."

"I HAVE found in my experience that those who seek to draw into the
selfish confines of their own breasts the electric current of Love are
withered by its force and passion. The energy degrades to sensualism if
it has only the Individual channel for expression. The sexual expression
of Love is good and beautiful if normal, but it is not so infallible as
the subtler intercourse of the soul and the affections, or so satisfying
as a comradeship in work for Humanity, and a mental and spiritual
affinity."-MIRIAM W. NICOL.

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

PAGE <span id="xref_20">20</span>.--"*In the beauty and openness of
their own bodies*,"

"ALL the loves--if they be heroic and not purely animal, or what is
called natural, and slaves to generation as instruments in some way of
nature--have for object the divinity, and tend towards divine beauty,
which first is communicated to, and shines in, souls; and from them or
rather through them is communicated to bodies; whence it is that
well-ordered affection loves the body or corporeal beauty, insomuch as
it is an indication of beauty of spirit."--GIORDANO BRUNO. "Gli Eroici
Furori" (dial. iii. 13), trans. by L. Williams.

"In Sparta the spectacle of the naked human body and the natural
treatment of natural things were the best safeguard against the sensual
excitement artificially produced by the modern plan of separating the
sexes from the earliest childhood. The forms of one sex and the
functions of its specific organs were no secret to the other. There was
no possibility of trifling with ambiguities."--BEBEL'S "Woman," Bellamy
Library, p. 70

PAGE <span id="xref_22">22</span>.--*Generation and nutrition*.

"IT is in the almost homogeneous fabrics of the cellular plants that we
find the closest connection between the function of nutrition and that
of reproduction; for every one of the vesicles which compose their
fabric is endowed with the power of generating others similar to itself;
and these may extend the parent structure or separate into new and
distinct organisms. Hence it is scarcely possible to draw a line in
these cases, between the nutrition of the individual and the
reproduction of the species."--W. B. CARPENTER,--Principles of Human
Physiology," sec. 281.

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

PAGE <span id="xref_40">40</span>.--*Secondary Differences, between the
Sexes*.

THE following are some of the points of difference given by H. Ellis in
"Man and Woman" (Contemporary Science Series):--

The average cranial capacity of men is greater than that of women (as
would be expected from the general proportions of the sexes), but the
*difference* in this respect between men and women is greater in the
higher civilised races than in the lower and more primitive.

Evidence points on the whole to the *cerebellum* being, relatively.
distinctly larger in women than in men.

Intellectually, women tend to the personal and concrete, men to the
general and abstract.

Women endure pain, operations, etc., better than men, and show greater
tenacity of life; men are superior in motor perfection, skill, and
muscle. In delicacy of sense -perceptions the two sexes are about equal.

Women show in some respects a greater affectability than men, which is
encouraged by their slight tendency to anæmia, by the greater
development of their vaso-motor system, and by the periodicity of their
functions. They are more hypnotic; the lower--that is, the more
primitive and fundamental--nerve-centres preponderate and are more
excitable; hysteria, ecstasy, and suggestibility, more marked.

Men show a greater tendency to race-variation than women; abnormalities
of various kinds, idiots and geniuses, are commoner amongst males. Man
represents the radical or experimental element in the life of the race.

Woman represents the conservative element. She remains nearer to the
child, but for that very reason is in some respects

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

more advanced than man, who, as he grows older, is farther off from
heaven than when he was a boy."

PAGE <span id="xref_50">50</span>.--*Finesse in woman*.

"THE method of attaining results by ruses (common among all the weaker
lower animals) is so habitual among women that, as Lombroso and Ferrero
remark, in women deception is ' almost physiological.' . . . But to
regard the caution and indirectness of women as due to innate
wickedness, would, it need scarcely be said, be utterly irrational. It
is inevitable, and results from the constitution of women, acting in the
conditions under which they are generally placed. There is at present no
country in the world, certainly no civilised country, in which a woman
may safely state openly her wishes and desires, and proceed openly to
seek their satisfaction.'--H. ELLIS, "Man and Woman," p. 174.

PAGE <span id="xref_54">54</span> (note).--"*The freedom of Woman must
ultimately rest on the Communism of society*."

THE reproduction of the race is a social function, and we are compelled
to conclude that it is the duty of the community, as a community, to
provide for the child-bearer when in the exercise of her social function
she is unable to provide for herself. The woman engaged in producing a
new member, who maybe a source of incalculable profit or danger to the
whole community, cannot fail to be a source of the liveliest solicitude
to everyone in the community, and it was a sane and beautiful instinct
that found expression of old in the permission accorded to the pregnant
woman to enter gardens and orchards, and freely help herself."--HAVELOCK
ELLIS, Pamphlet on "Evolution in Sex," p. 15.

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

"She held it just that women should be so provided for, because the
mothers of the community fulfil in the State as important and necessary
a function as the men themselves do."--GRANT ALLEN, "The Woman who Did,"
p. 73.

PAGE <span id="xref_56">56</span>.--"*Menstrual troubles and
disturbances*."

THERE is little doubt that menstruation, as it occurs to-day in the vast
majority of cases, is somehow pathological and out of the order of
nature. In animals the periodic loss is so small as to be scarcely
noticeable, and among primitive races of mankind it is as a rule
markedly less than among the higher and later races. We may therefore
suppose that its present excess is attributable to certain conditions of
life which have prevailed for a number of centuries, and which, have
continuously acted to bring about a feverish disposition of the sexual
apparatus, and an hereditary tendency to recurrent manifestations of a
diseased character, Among conditions of life which in all probability
*would* act in this way may be counted (1) the indoor life and
occupations of women, leading to degeneration of the neuro-muscular
system, weakness, and inflammability; (2) the heightening of the
sex-passion in both men and women with the increase of luxury and
artificialism in life; (3) the subjection of the woman to the
unrestrained use and even abuse of the man, which inevitably took place
as soon as she--with the changes in the old tribal life--became his
chattel and slave; and which has continued practically ever since. These
three causes; acting together over so long a period may well seem
sufficient to have induced a morbid and excessive habit in the female
organism; and if so we may hope that with their removal the excess
itself and a vast amount of concomitant human misery and waste of
life-power will disappear.

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

PAGE <span id="xref_60">60</span>.--"*Natural desires*."

ALTHOUGH I agree with Malthus as to the value of virtuous abstinence,
the sad conviction is forced upon me as a physician that the chaste
morality of women--which though it is certainly a high virtue in our
modern states is none the less a crime against nature--not unfrequently
revenges itself in the cruellest forms of disease."--DR. HEGERISCH,
translator of Malthus.

PAGE <span id="xref_63">63</span>.--"*They must learn to fight*."

WOMEN have as little to hope from men as workmen from the middle
classes."--BEBEL, "Woman," p. 72.

PAGE <span id="xref_65">65</span>.--*Sexual selection exercised by the
female*.

"HUNGER--that is to say, what we call economic causes--has, because it
is the more widespread and constant, though not necessarily the more
imperious instinct, produced nearly all the great zoological
revolutions. . . . Yet love has, in the form of sexual selection, even
before we reach the vertebrates, moulded races to the *ideal* of the
female; and reproduction is always the chief end of nutrition which
hunger waits on, the supreme aim of life everywhere."--Evolution in
Sex," p. 12.

PAGE <span id="xref_71">71</span>.--"*The features of a grander type*."

"TOWARDS the Future I look and see a greater race to come--of beautiful
women, athletic, free, able in mind and logic, great in love and in
maternal instincts, unashamed of their bodies and of the sexual parts of
them, calm in nerve, and with a chronic recognition of Spiritual
qualities--a race of men, gentle, strong, courageous, continent,
affectionate, unselfish, large in body and mind, full of pluck and
brawn,

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

able to suffer, clean and honest in their animal necessities,
self-confident, with no king or overseer."--MIRIAM WHEELER NICOL.

PAGE <span id="xref_77">77</span>.--"*The search for a fitting mate*."

WITH the disappearance of the artificial barriers in the way of
friendship between the sexes, and of the economic motive to sexual
relationships--which are perhaps the two chief forces now tending to
produce promiscuous sexual intercourse. whether dignified or not with
the name of marriage-men and women will be free to engage, unhampered,
in the search, so complicated in a highly civilised condition of
society, for a fitting mate."--"Evolution in Sex," p. 13.

PAGE <span id="xref_78">78</span> (note).--*Desire of congress less
strong in woman*.

"I WILL mention here that from various late sources of information I
conclude that *sexual insensibility* in women is much commoner than
usually assumed. Of course I mean by this, insensibility as from the
sexual standpoint: of the sense of pleasure and satisfaction in
congress, as well as the desire for congress. This desire is much less
frequent in woman than generally supposed. But the soul-side of love on
the other hand is often more prominent in females than in males."--A.
MOLL, "*Conträre Sexual-empfindung*, 2nd edn., p. 325.

PAGE <span id="xref_83">83</span>.--"*In this serf-life their very
matures have been blunted*."

"NOT so the wife; however brutal a tyrant she may be chained to . . . he
can claim from her and enforce the lowest degradation of a human being,
that of being made the instrument of an animal function contrary to her
inclinations. . . No amount of ill-usage, without adultery superadded,
will in England free a wife from her tormentor. "-MILL'S -Subjection of
Women," 1869

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

Clitheroe Case, 1891.--After the refusal of the wife to cohabit, the
husband said ---"I therefore *took* my wife, and have since detained her
in my house, using no more force or restraint than necessary to take her
and keep her."

The Lord Chancellor said "I am of opinion that no such right or power
exists in law"--and ordered the lady to be restored to her
liberty.--"Woman Free," by ELLIS ETHELMER, p. 144.

PAGE <span id="xref_96">96</span>.--*The Monogamic Marriage*.

IN attempting to estimate the moral worth of a people, a race, or a
civilisation, we are much more enlightened by the position given to
woman than by the legal type of the conjugal union. This type, besides,
is usually more apparent than real. In many civilisations, both dead and
living, legal monogamy has for its chief object the regulation of
succession and the division of property."--LETOURNEAU, "Evolution of
Marriage," p. 186.

Conjugal unions among the animals.--"Among many of the animal species
the sexual union induces a durable association, having for its object
the rearing of young. In nobility, delicacy, and devotion these unions
do not yield precedence to many human unions."--*Ibid*., p. 19.

"It is especially interesting to study the various modes of conjugal and
familial association among birds. This may be easily inferred from the
ardour, the variety and delicacy they bring to their amours. . . . There
are some birds absolutely fickle and even debauched--as, for example,
the little American starling (*Icterus pecoris*), which changes its
female from day to day. . . . Other species, while they have renounced
promiscuity, are still determined polygamists. The gallinacae are
particularly addicted to this form of

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

conjugal union, which is so common in fan with mankind, highly civilised
and boasting of their practice of even when monogamy. Our barndoor cock,
vain and sensual, courageous and jealous, is a perfect type of the
polygamous bird." . . .--*Ibid*, p. 26.

"Nearly all the rapacious animals, even the stupid vultures, are
monogamous. The conjugal union of the bald-headed eagle appears even to
last till the death of one of the partners." . . .

"With the female Illinois parrot (*Psittacus pertinax*) widowhood and
death are synonymous, a circumstance rare enough in the human species.
yet of which the birds give us more than one example. When, after some
years of conjugal life, a Wheat-ear happens to die, his companion hardly
survives him a month."--*Ibid*, p. 27.

"Bad fathers are rare among birds. Often on the contrary the male rivals
the female in love for the young, he guards and feeds her during
incubation, and sometimes even sits on the eggs with her. The carrier
pigeon feeds his female while she is sitting; the Canadian goose and the
crow do the same; more than that the latter takes his companion's place
at times, to give her some relaxation. The blue marten behaves in the
same manner. Among many species male and female combine their efforts
without distinction of sex; they sit in turn, and the one who is free
takes the duty of feeding the one who is occupied. This is the custom of
the black-coated gull, the booby of Bassan, the great blue heron, and of
the black vulture."--*Ibid*, p. 30.

"In regard to mammals, there is no strict relation between the degree of
intellectual development and the form of sexual union. The carnivorous
animals often live in couples; but

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

this is not an absolute rule, for the South African lion is frequently
accompanied by four or five females. Bears, weasels, whales, etc.,
generally go in couples. Sometimes species that are very nearly allied
have different conjugal customs; thus the white-checked peccary lives in
troops, whilst the white-ringed peccary lives in couples. There is the
same diversity in the habits of monkeys. Some are polygamous and others
monogamous. The Wanderoo (*Macacus Silenus*) of India has only one
female and is faithful to her until death. The *Cebus Capucinus*, on the
contrary is polygamous. "--*Ibid*, p. 33.

PAGE <span id="xref_102">102</span>.--"*The destinies of a life-time*."

"UNLIKE the Catholic Church in its dealings with novices, Society
demands \[in marriage\] the ring, the parchment, and the vow as a
preliminary to the knowledge and experience; hence adulteries, the
divorce court, home-prisons, and the increase of cant and pruriency in
the community. Unless a woman knows what a man's body is like, with its
virile needs, and realises to the full her own adult necessities, how is
it possible that she can have the faintest conception as to whether the
romantic passionate impulse a man awakens in her is the trinity of love,
trust and reverence, which alone lays the foundations of real
marriage?"--EDITH M. ELLIS, "A Noviciate for Marriage," p. 13.

PAGE <span id="xref_107">107</span>.--"*Contracts of some kind will
still be made*."

"IT is therefore probable that a future more or less distant will
inaugurate the régime of monogamic unions, freely contracted, and, at
need, freely dissolved by simple mutual consent, as is already the case
with divorces in various European countries--at Geneva, in Belgium, in
Roumania,

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

etc.--and with separation in Italy. In these divorces of the future, the
community will only intervene in order to safeguard that which is of
vital interest to it--the fate and the education of the children. But
this evolution in the manner of understanding and practising marriage
will operate slowly, for it supposes an entire corresponding revolution
in public opinion; moreover, it requires as a corollary profound
modifications in the social organism."--LETOURNEAU, "Evolution of
Marriage," p. 358.

"The antique morals which hold woman as a servile property belonging to
her husband still live in many minds. They will he extinguished by
degrees. The matrimonial contract will end by being the same kind of
contract as any other, freely accepted, freely maintained, freely
dissolved; but where constraint has disappeared deception becomes an
unworthy offence. Such will be the opinion of a future humanity, more
elevated morally than ours. Doubtless it will no longer have any tender
indulgence for conveniently dissimulated adultery, but, on the other
hand, it will no longer excuse the avenging husband."--*Ibid*, p. 148.

PAGE <span id="xref_108">108</span>.--*Contracts preliminary to a
permanent alliance*.

THE custom of hand-fasting, rare now anywhere else, still prevails to
some extent in Iceland. A man and woman contract to live together for a
year. If at the end of the year the parties agree thereto, they are
married; if not, they separate without stigma on either side, The
contract may be made conditionally binding from the first. It may bind
the parties to marry in the event of issue, or in the event of no issue,
as the case may be."--PROF. MAVOR, "Iceland: Some sociological and other
notes," Proceedings Philosophical Society, Glasgow, 1890-91.

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

PAGE <span id="xref_114">114</span>.--*The Intermediate Sex*.

"Urning men and women, on whose book of life Nature has written her new
word which sounds so strange to us, bear such storm and stress within
them, such ferment and fluctuation, so much complex material having its
outlet only towards the future; their individualities are so rich and
many-sided, and withal so little understood, that it is impossible to
characterise them adequately in a few sentences."--*Otto de Joux*.

PAGE <span id="xref_141">141</span>.--*A certain amount of animalism*.

"The Saviours of this, as of every corrupt and stupid generation, must
feel the pulse of the adulterer as well as that of his victim, and stand
clear-eyed and honest as pioneers of the new sexual renaissance, which
will probably combine a healthy temperate animalism with Browning's
vision of that rare mating when soul lies by soul."--EDITH M. ELLIS, "A
Noviciate for Marriage," p. 4.

"She gave him comprehension of the meaning of love: a word in many
mouths, not often explained. With her, wound in his idea of her, he
perceived it to signify a new start in our existence, a finer shoot of
the tree stoutly planted in good gross earth; the senses running their
live sap, and the minds companioned, and the spirits made one by the
whole-natured conjunction. In sooth, a happy prospect for the sons and
daughters of Earth, divinely indicating more than happiness: the
speeding of us, compact of what we are, between the ascetic rocks and
the sensual whirlpools, to the creation of certain nobler races, now
very dimly imagined."--GEORGE MEREDITH'S "Diana of the Crossways," ch.
37.
