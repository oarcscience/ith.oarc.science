# THE FREE SOCIETY

TAKING, finally, a somewhat wider outlook over the whole subject of the
most intimate human relations than was feasible in the foregoing
chapters, we may make a few general remarks.

One of the great difficulties in the way of arriving at any general
understanding on questions of sex--and one which we have already had
occasion to note--is the extraordinary diversity of feeling and
temperament which exists in these matters. Needless to say, this is
increased by the reserve, natural or artificial, which so seldom allows
people to express their sentiments quite freely. In the great ocean
there are so many currents, cold and warm, fresh, and salt, and
brackish; and each one thinks that the current in which he lives is the
whole ocean. The man of the world hardly understands, certainly does not
sympathise with, the recluse or ascetic--and the want of appreciation is
generally returned; the maternal, the sexual, and the philanthropic
woman, are all somewhat unintelligible to each other; the average male
and

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

the average female approach the great passion from totally different
sides, and are continually at odds over it; and again both of these
great sections of humanity fail entirely to understand that other and
well-marked class of persons whose love-attraction is (inborn) towards
their own sex, and indeed hardly recognise the existence of such a
class, although as a matter of fact it is a large and important one in
every community. In fad, all these differences have hitherto been so
little the subject of impartial study that we are still amazingly in the
dark about them.

When we look back to History, and the various customs of the world in
different races and tribes and at different periods of time, we seem to
see these natural divergencies of human temperament reflected in the
extraordinary diversity of practices that have obtained and been
recognised. We see that, in some cases, the worship of sex took its
place beside the worship of the gods; and--what appears equally
strange--that the orgiastic rites and saturnalia of the early world were
intimately connected with religious feeling; we find that, in other
cases, asceticism and chastity and every denial of the flesh were
glorified and looked upon as providing the only way to the heavenly
kingdom; we discover that marriage has been instituted and defined and

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

sanctioned in endless forms, each looked upon as the only moral and
possible form in its own time and country; and that the position of
women under these different conditions has varied in the most remarkable
way--that in some of the primitive societies where group-marriages <span
id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md) of one kind or another prevailed their
dignity and influence were of the highest, that under some forms of
Monogamy, as among the Nagas of Bengal, <span
id="fr_28"></span>[2](#fn_28.md) women have been abjectly degraded, while
under other forms, as in Ancient Egypt and the later Roman Empire, they
have been treated with respect; and so forth. We cannot fail, I say, to
recognise the enormous diversity of practice which has existed over the
world in this matter of the relations of the sexes; nor, I may add, can
we venture--if we possess any sense of humanity--to put our finger down
finally on any one custom or institution, and say, Here alone is the
right way.

On the contrary, it seems to me probable that, broadly speaking, a
really free Society will accept and make use of all that has gone
before. If, as

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

we have suggested, historical forms and customs are the indication of
tendencies and instincts which still exist among us, then the question
is, not the extinction of these tendencies, but the finding of the right
place and really rational expression for them. That the various customs
of past social life do subsist on beneath the surface of modern society,
we know well enough; and it seems likely that society in the future will
have to recognise and to a certain extent transform these. In fact, in
recognising it will inevitably transform, for it will bring them out
from darkness into light, and from the old conditions and surroundings
of the past societies into the new conditions of the modern. Polygamy,
for instance, or some related form of union, supposing it really did
spontaneously and naturally arise in a society which gave perfect
freedom and independence to women in their relation to men, would be
completely different in character from the old-world polygamy, and would
cease to act as a degrading influence on women, since it would be the
spontaneous expression of their attachment to each other and to a common
husband; Monogamy, under similar circumstances, would lose its
narrowness and stuffiness; and the life of the Hetaira, that is of the
woman who chooses to be the companion of more than one man

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

might not be without dignity, honor, and sincere attachment.

Again it is easy to see, if the sense of cleanness in sex ever does come
in, if the physical body ever becomes clean (which it certainly is not
now-a-days), clean and beautiful and accepted, within and without--and
this of course it can only be through a totally changed method of life,
through pure and clean food, nakedness to a large extent, and a kind of
saturation with the free air and light of heaven; and if the mental and
moral relation ever becomes clean, which can only be with the freedom of
woman and the sincerity of man, and so forth; it is easy to see how
entirely all this would alter our criticism of the various
sex-relations, and our estimate of their place and fitness.

In the wild and even bacchanalian festivals of all the earlier nations,
there was an element of Nature--sex-mysticism which has become lost in
modern times, or quite unclean and depraved; yet we cannot but see that
this element is a vital and deep-lying one in humanity, and in some form
or other will probably reassert itself. On the other hand, in the
Monkish and other ascetic movements of Christian or pre-Christian times,
with their efforts towards a proud ascendancy over the body, there was
(commonly sneered at though it may be in the

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

modern West) an equally vital and important truth <span
id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md), which will have to be rehabilitated. The
practices of former races and times, however anomalous they may
sometimes appear to us, were after all in the main the expression of
needs and desires which *had* their place in human nature, and which
still for the most part have their place there, even though overlaid and
suppressed beneath existing convention; and who knows, in all the
stifled longings of thousands and thousands of hearts, how the great
broad soul of Humanity--which reaches to and accepts all times and
races--is still ever asserting herself and swelling against the petty
bonds of this or that age? The nearer Society comes to its freedom and
majority the more lovingly will it embrace this great soul within it,
and recognising in all the customs of the past the partial efforts of
that soul to its own fulfilment will refuse to deny them, but rather
seek, by acceptance and reunion, to transform and illumine them all.

Possibly, to some, these remarks will only suggest a return to genera\[
confusion and promiscuity; and of course to such people they will seem
inconsistent with what has been said before on the subject of the real
Marriage and the tendency of human beings, as society evolves, to seek
more and more sincerely a

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

life-long union with their chosen mate; but no one who thinks twice
about the matter could well make this mistake. For the latter tendency,
that namely "from confusion to distinction," is in reality the tendency
of all evolution, and cannot be set aside. It is in the very nature of
Love that as it realises its own aim it should rivet always more and
more towards a durable and distinct relationship, nor rest till the
permanent mate and equal is found. As human beings progress their
relations to each other must become much *more* definite and distinct
instead of less so--and there is no likelihood of society in its onward
march lapsing backward, so to speak, to formlessness again.

But it is just the advantage of this onward movement towards
definiteness that it allows-as in the evolution of all organic life--of
more and more *differentiation* as the life rises higher in the scale of
existence. If society should at any future time recognise--as we think
likely it will do--the variety of needs of the human heart and of human
beings, it will not therefore confuse them, but will see that these
different needs indicate different functions, all of which may have
their place and purpose. If it has the good sense to tolerate a
Nature-festival now and then, and a certain amount of
animalism [141](lca15.htm#xref_141.md) let loose, it will not be so foolish
as to be unable to

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

distinguish this from the deep delight and happiness of a permanent
spiritual mating; or if it recognises in some case, a woman's temporary
alliance with a man for the sake of obtaining a much-needed child, it
will not therefore be so silly as to mark her down for life as a common
harlot. It will allow in fact that there are different forms and
functions of the love-sentiment, and while really believing that a
life-long comradeship (possibly with little of the sexual in it) is the
most satisfying form, will see that a cast-iron Marriage-custom which,
as to-day, expects two people either to live eternally in the same house
and sit on opposite sides of the same table, or else to be strangers to
each other--and which only recognises two sorts of intimacy, orthodox
and criminal, wedded and adulterous--is itself the source of perpetual
confusion and misapprehension.

No doubt the Freedom of Society in this sense, and the possibility of a
human life which shall be the fluid and ever-responsive embodiment of
true Love in all its variety of manifestation, goes with the Freedom of
Society in the economic sense. When mankind has solved the industrial
problem so far that the products of our huge mechanical forces have
become a common heritage, and no man or woman is the property-slave of
another, then some of the causes which compel prostitution,

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

property-marriage, and other perversions of affection, will have
disappeared; and in such economically free society human unions may at
last take place according to their own inner and true laws.

Hitherto we have hardly thought whether there were any inner laws or
not; our thoughts have been fixed on the outer; and the Science of Love,
if it may so be called, has been strangely neglected. Yet if, putting
aside for a moment all convention and custom, one will look quietly
within himself, he will perceive that there are most distinct and
inviolable inner forces, binding him by different ties to different
people, and with different and inevitable results according to the
quality and the nature of the affection bestowed--that there is in fact
in that world of the heart a kind of cosmical harmony and variety, and
an order almost astronomical.

This is noticeably true of what may be called the planetary law of
distances in the relation of people to one another. For of some of the
circle of one's acquaintance it may be said that one loves them
cordially at a hundred miles' distance; of others that they are dear
friends at a mile; while others again are indispensable far nearer than
that. If by any chance the friend whose planetary distance is a mile is
forced into closer quarters, the only result is a

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

violent development of repulsion and centrifugal force, by which
probably he is carried even beyond his normal distance, till such time
as he settles down into his right place; while on the other hand if we
are separated for a season from one who by right is very near and who we
know belongs to us, we can bids our time, knowing that the forces of
return will increase with the separation. How marked and definite these
personal distances are may be gathered from considering how largely the
art of life consists in finding and keeping them, and how much trouble
arises from their confusion, and from the way in which we often only
find them out after much blundering and suffering and mutual
recrimination.

So marked indeed are these and other such laws that they sometimes
suggest that there really is a cosmic world of souls, to which we all
belong--a world of souls whose relations are eternal and
clearly-defined; and that our terrestrial relations are merely the
working-out and expression of far antecedent and unmodifiable facts--an
idea which for many people is corroborated by the curious way in which,
often at the very first sight, they become aware of their exact relation
to a new-comer. In some cases this brings with it a strange sense of
previous intimacy, hard to explain; and in other cases, not

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

so intimate, it still will seem to fix almost instantaneously the exact
propinquity of the relation--so that though in succeeding years, or even
decades of years, the mutual acquaintanceship may work itself out with
all sorts of interesting and even unexpected developments and episodes,
yet this *mean distance* does not vary during the whole time, so to
speak, by a single hair's breadth.

Is it possible, we may ask (in the light of such experiences), that
there really is a Free Society in another and deeper sense than that
hitherto suggested--a society to which we all in our inmost selves
consciously or unconsciously belong--the Rose of souls that Dante beheld
in Paradise, whose every petal is an individual, and an individual only
through its union with all the rest--the early Church's dream, of an
eternal Fellowship in heaven and on earth--the Prototype of all the
brotherhoods and communities that exist on this or any planet; and that
the innumerable selves of men, united in the one Self, members of it and
of one another (like the members of the body) stand in eternal and
glorious relationship bound indissolubly together? We know of course
that the reality of things cannot be adequately expressed by such
phrases as these, or by any phrases, yet possibly some such conception
comes as near the truth as any *one* 

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

conception can; and, making use of it, we may think that our earthly
relations are a continual attempt--through much blindness and
ineffectualness and failure--to feel after and to find these true and
permanent relations to others.

Surely in some subtle way if one person sincerely love another, heart
and soul, that other becomes a part of the lover, indissolubly wrought
into his being <span id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md) Mentally the two grow
and become compact together. No thought that the lover thinks, no scene
that he looks on, but the impress of his loved one in some way is on
it--so that as long as he exists (here or anywhere) with his most
intimate self that other is threaded and twined inseparable. So clinging
is the relation. Perhaps in the outer world we do not always see such
relations quite clear, and we think when death or other cause removes
the visible form from us that the hour of parting has come. But in the
inner world it is clear enough, and we divine that we and our mate are
only two little petals that grow near each other on the great Flower of
Eternity; and that it is because we are near each other in that

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

unchanging world, that in the world of change our mortal selves are
drawn together, and will be drawn always, wherever and whenever they may
meet.

But since the petals of the immortal Flower are by myriads and myriads,
so have we endless lessons of soul-relationship to learn--some most
intimate, others doubtless less so, but all fair and perfect--so soon as
we have discovered what these relationships really are, and are in no
confusion of mind about them. For even those that are most distant are
desirable, and have the germ of love in them, so soon as they are
touched by the spirit of Truth (which means the fearless statement of
the life which is in us, in poise against the similar statement of life
in others); since, indeed, the spirit of Truth is the life of the whole,
and only the other side of that Love which binds the whole together.

Looking at things in this light it would seem to us that the ideal of
terrestrial society for which we naturally strive is that which would
embody best these enduring and deep-seated relations of human souls; and
that every society, as far as it is human and capable of holding
together, is in its degree a reflection of the celestial City. Never is
the essential, real, Society quite embodied in any mundane Utopia, but
ever through human history is it

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

working unconsciously in the midst of mortal affairs and impelling
towards an expression of itself.

At any rate, and however all this may be, the conclusion is that the
*inner* laws in these matters--the inner laws of the sex-passion, of
love, and of all human relationship--must gradually appear and take the
lead, since they alone are the powers which can create and uphold a
rational society; and that the outer laws--since they are dead and
lifeless things--must inevitably disappear. Real love is only possible
in the freedom of society; and freedom is only possible when love is a
reality. The subjection of sex-relations to legal conventions is an
intolerable bondage, but of course it is a bondage inescapable as long
as people are slaves to a merely physical desire. The two slaveries in
fact form a sort of natural counterpoise, the one to the other. When
love becomes sufficient of a reality to hold the sex-passion as its
powerful yet willing servant, the absurdity of Law will be at an end.

Surely it is not too much to suppose that a reasonable society will be
capable of seeing these and other such things; that it will neither on
the one hand submit to a cast-iron system depriving it of all grace and
freedom of movement, nor on the other hand be in danger of falling into
swamps of promiscuity; but that it will have the sense to

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

recognise and establish the innumerable and delicate distinctions of
relation which build up the fabric of a complex social organism. It will
understand perhaps that sincere Love is, as we have said, a real fact
and its own justification, and that however various or anomalous or
unusual may be the circumstances and combinations under which it
appears, it demands and has to be treated by society with the utmost
respect and reverence--as a law unto itself, probably the deepest and
most intimate law of human life, which only in the most exceptional
cases, if at all, may public institutions venture to interfere with.

In all these matters it is surprising to-day what children we are--how
we take the innumerable flowers and try to snip and shape all their
petals and leaves to one sorry pattern, or how with a kind of grossness
we snatch at and destroy in a few moments the bloom and beauty which are
rightfully undying. Perhaps it will only be for a society more fully
grown than ours to understand the wealth and variety of affectional
possibilities which it has within itself, and the full enchantment of
the many relations in which the romance of love by a tender
discrimination and æsthetic continence is preserved for years and
decades of years in, as it were, a state of evergrowing perfection.
