### CHAPTER IV.

### Hermaphrodism among Gods and Mortals

IN chapter ii. above, reference is made by one of the writers quoted to
"the numerous stories of hermaphrodites related by all the old writers
on America." That there are such numerous stories is quite correct.
Jacobus Le Moyne, who travelled as artist with a French Expedition to
Florida in 1564, left some very interesting drawings <span
id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33.md) representing the Indians of that region
and their customs; and among them one representing the
"Hermaphrodites"--tall and powerful men, beardless, but with long and
abundant hair, and naked except for a loin-cloth, engaged in carrying
wounded or dying fellow-Indians on their backs or on litters to a place
of safety. He says of them that in Florida such folk of double nature
are frequent, and that

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

being robust and powerful, they are made use of in the place of animals
for the carrying of burdens. For when their chiefs go to war the
hermaphrodites carry the food; and when any of the tribe die of wounds
or disease they construct litters . . . of wood and rushes . . . and so
carry the dead to the place of burial. And indeed those who are stricken
with any infectious disease are borne by the hermaphrodites to certain
appointed places, and nursed and cared for by them, until they may be
restored to full health."

Similar stories are told by Charlevoix, <span
id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34.md) de Pauw, <span
id="fr_35"></span>[2](#fn_35.md) and others; and one seems to get a glimpse
in them of an intermediate class of human beings who made themselves
useful to the community not only by their muscular strength, but by
their ability and willingness to act as nurses and attendants on the
sick and dying.

It is needless, of course, to say that these were *not* hermaphrodites
in the strict sense of the term--*i.e.*, human beings uniting in one
person the functions both of male and female--since such beings do
practically not exist. But it is evident that they *were* intermediate
types--in the sense of being men with much of the psychologic character
of women,

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

or in some cases women with the mentality of men; and the early
travellers, who had less concrete and reliable information on such
subjects than we have, and who were already prepossessed by the belief
in the prevalence of hermaphroditism, leapt easily to the conclusion
that these strange beings were indeed of that nature. De Pauw, indeed,
just mentioned, positively refuses to believe in the explanation that
they were men dressed as women, and insists that they *were*
hermaphrodites!

In 1889, a certain Dr. A. B. Holder, anxious to settle positively the
existence or non-existence of hermaphrodites, made some investigations
among the Crow-Indians of Montana--among whom the Bardaches were called
"Boté." <span id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md) And Dr. Karsch, summarising
his report, says <span id="fr_37"></span>[2](#fn_37.md):--"This word,
bo-té, means literally 'not man, not woman.' A corresponding
Tulalip-word which the Indians of the Washington region make use of is,
according to Holder, 'burdash,' which means 'half man, half woman'--and
that without necessarily implying any anomalous structure of the
sex-organs. . . The Crow-tribe, in 1889, included five such Boté, and
possessed about the same number before. They form a class in every
tribe, are well-known to each

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

other, and knit friendly relations with their likes in other tribes, so
that they become well acquainted with the Uranian relationships also in
the neighbour tribes. They wear female attire, part their hair in the
middle, and plait it in womanly style; they possess or cultivate
feminine voices and gestures, and live continually in association with
the women, just as if they belonged to that sex. All the same their
voices, features, and figure never lose their masculine quality so
completely as to make it hard for a careful observer to distinguish. a
Boté from a woman. Such a Boté among the: Crows carried on women's work,
like sweeping, scrubbing, dish-washing, with such neatness and
willingness that he would often obtain employment among the white folk.
Usually the feminine attire is adopted in childhood, and the
corresponding ways of life at an early age, but his special calling is
not exercised by the Boté till the age of puberty. A young scholar of an
educational establishment--a boys' school in an Indian Agency--was often
caught dressing himself in secret in women's clothes; and although
punished on each occasion, he nevertheless, after leaving school,
transformed himself into a Boté--to which calling he has ever since
remained true. A certain Boté, well accredited among the Crow-tribe, who
belonged to the scouting-party of Dr. Holder, was

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

a Dakota Indian; he is described as a splendidly built young man of
pleasing features, perfect health, brisk alertness, and the happiest
disposition. Holder attached him to his own service, and finally
persuaded him--though only after much unwillingness on his part--to
allow himself to be personally examined." The result of the examination
was to prove him to be physically a complete man--and, moreover, an
exceedingly modest one!

The Père Lafitau, whom I have quoted before and who was a keen observer
and a broad-minded man, says, in one passage of his *Sauvages
Américains*: "The spectacle of the men disguised as women surprised the
Europeans who first landed in America. And, as they did not at all
understand the motives of this sort of metamorphosis, they concluded
that these were folk in whom the two sexes were conjoined: as a matter
of fact our old records always term them hermaphrodites." He goes on to
say that though the spirit of religion which made these men embrace this
mode of life caused them to be regarded as extraordinary beings, yet the
suspicions which the Europeans entertained concerning them took such
hold upon the latter "that they invented every possible charge against
them, and these imaginations inflamed the zeal of Vasco Nugnes de Vabra,
the Spanish captain who first discovered the Southern Sea (*la mer* 

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

du Sud), to such an extent that he destroyed numbers of them by letting
loose upon them those savage dogs, of whom his compatriots indeed made
use for the purpose of exterminating a large proportion of the Indians."

On the cruelties of the Spanish conquerors among the Indian tribes--only
paralleled apparently by those of modern Commercialism among the
same--we need not dwell. What interests us here is the evidence of the
wide-spread belief in hermaphroditism current among the early European
travellers. That a similar belief has ruled also among most primitive
peoples is evident from a consideration of their gods. *Why* it should
so have ruled is a question which I shall touch on towards the
conclusion of this chapter. The whole matter, anyhow, belongs to the
subjects we are discussing in this book. For clearly bisexuality links
on to homosexuality, and the fact that this characteristic was ascribed
to the gods suggests that in the popular mind it must have played a
profound and important part in human life. I will, therefore, in
concluding this portion of the book, give some instances of this divine
bisexuality.

Brahm, in the Hindu mythology, is often represented as two-sexed.
Originally he was the sole Being. But, "delighting not to be alone he
wished for the existence of another, and at once he became

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

such, as male and female embraced (united). He caused this his one self
to fall in twain." <span id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_38.md) Siva, also, the
most popular of the Hindu divinities, is originally bi-sexual. In the
interior of the great rockhewn Temple at Elephanta the career of Siva is
carved in successive panels. And on the first he appears as a complete
full-length human being conjoining the two sexes in one--the left side
of the figure (which represents the female portion) projecting into a
huge breast and hip, while the right side is man-like in outline, and in
the centre (though now much defaced) the organs of both sexes. In the
second panel, however, his evolution or differentiation is complete, and
he is portrayed as complete male with his consort Sakti or Parvati
standing as perfect female beside him. <span
id="fr_39"></span>[2](#fn_39.md) There are many such illustrations in Hindu
literature and art, representing the gods in their double or bi-sexual
role--*e.g.*, as Brahma Ardhanarisa, Siva Ardhanarisa (half male and
half female). <span id="fr_40"></span>[3](#fn_40.md) And these again are
interesting in connection with the account of Elohim in the 1st chapter
of Genesis, and the supposition that he was such an androgynous

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

deity. For we find (v. 27) that "Elohim created man in his own image, in
the image of Elohim created he him, *male and female* created he them."
And many commentators have maintained that this not only meant that the
first man was hermaphrodite, but that the Creator also was of that
nature. In the Midrasch we find that Rabbi Samuel-bar-Nachman said that
"Adam, when God had created him, was a man-woman (androgyne);" and the
great and learned Maimonides supported this, saying that "Adam and Eve
were created together, conjoined by their backs, but God divided this
double being, and taking one half (Eve), gave her to the other half
(Adam) for a mate." And the Rabbi Manasseh-ben-Israel, following this
up, explained that when "God took one of Adam's ribs to make Eve with,"
it should rather be rendered "one of his sides"--that is, that he
divided the double Adam, and one half was Eve. <span
id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md)

In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (I Adhyaya, 4th Brahmana) the evolution
of Brahm is thus described <span id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_42.md)t--"In the
beginning of this \[world\] was Self alone, in the shape of a person. .
. . But he

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

felt no delight. . . . He wished for a second. He was so large as man
and wife together \[*i.e.*, he included male and female\]. He then made
this his Self to fall in two; and thence arose husband and wife.
Therefore, Yagnavalkya said: We two are thus (each of us) like half a
shell \[or as some translate, like a split pea\]." The singular
resemblance of this account to what has been said above about the
creation of Adam certainly suggests the idea that Jehovah, like Brahm
(and like Baal and other Syrian gods), was conceived of as double-sexed,
and that primitive man was also conceived as of like nature. The author
(Ralston Skinner) of *The Source of Measures* says (p. 159) "The two
words of which Jehovah is composed make up the original idea of
male-female of the birth-originator. For the Hebrew letter Jod (or J)
was the *membrum virile*, and Hovah was Eve, the mother of all living,
or the procreatrix Earth and Nature." <span
id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43.md)

The tradition that mankind was anciently hermaphrodite is world-old. It
is referred to in Plato's *Banquet*, where Aristophanes
says:--"Anciently the nature of mankind was not the same as now, but
different. For at first there were three sexes of human beings, not two
only, namely male and female, as at present, but a third besides, common

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

to both the others--of which the name remains, though the sex itself has
vanished. For the androgynous sex then existed, both male and female;
but now it only exists as a name of reproach." He then describes how all
these three sorts of human beings were originally double, and conjoined
(as above) back to back; until Jupiter, jealous of his supremacy,
divided them vertically "as people cut apples before they preserve them,
or as they cut eggs with hairs"--after which, of course, these divided
and imperfect folk ran about over the earth, ever seeking their lost
halves, to be joined to them again.

I have mentioned the Syrian Baal as being sometimes represented as
double-sexed (apparently in combination with Astarte). In the Septuagint
(Hos. ii. 8, and Zeph. i. 4) he is called ἡ Baal (feminine) and Arnobius
tells us that his worshippers invoked him thus <span
id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44.md) "Hear us, Baal! whether thou be a god or
goddess." Similarly Bel and other Babylonian gods were often represented
as androgyne. <span id="fr_45"></span>[2](#fn_45.md) Mithras among the
Persians is spoken of by the Christian controversialist Firmicus as
two-sexed, and by Herodotus (Bk. i., c. 131) as identified with a
goddess, while there are innumerable Mithraic

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

monuments on which appear the symbols of two deities, male and female
combined. <span id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_46.md) Even Venus or Aphrodite
was sometimes worshipped in the double form. "In Cyprus," says Dr.
Frazer in his *Adonis, etc*. (p. 432, note), "there was a bearded and
masculine image of Venus (probably Astarte) in female attire: according
to Philochorus the deity thus represented was the moon, and sacrifices
were offered to him or her by men clad as women, and by women clad as
men (see Macrobius *Saturn* iii. 7, 2)." This bearded female deity is
sometimes also spoken of as Aphroditus, or as Venus Mylitta. Richard
Burton says <span id="fr_47"></span>[2](#fn_47.md):--"The Phoenicians
spread their androgynic worship over Greece. We find the consecrated
servants and votaries of Corinthian Aphrodite called Hierodouloi
(Strabo, viii. 6), who aided the 10,000 courtesans in gracing the
Venus-temple. . . . One of the headquarters of the cult was Cyprus,
where, as Servius relates (Ad. Aen. ii. 632), stood the simulacre of a
bearded Aphrodite with feminine body and costume, sceptred and mitred
like a man. The sexes when worshiping it exchanged habits, and here the
virginity was offered in sacrifice."

The worship of this bearded goddess was mainly in Syria and Cyprus. But
in Egypt also a representation of a bearded Isis has been found,--with

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

infant Horus in her lap; <span id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48.md) while again
there are a number of representations (from papyri) of the goddess Neith
in androgyne form, with a male member (erected). And again, curiously
enough, the Norse Freya, or Friga, corresponding to Venus, was similarly
figured. Dr. von Römer says: <span id="fr_49"></span>[2](#fn_49.md)--"just
as the Greeks had their Aphroditos as well as Aphrodite so the
Scandinavians had their Friggo as well as their Friga. This divinity,
too, was androgyne. Friga, to whom the sixth day of the week was
dedicated, was sometimes thought of as hermaphrodite. She was
represented as having the members of both sexes, standing by a column
with a sword in her right hand, and in her left a bow."

In the Orphic hymns we have:--

<span class="small">"Zeus was the first of all, Zeus last, the lord of
the lightning;  
Zeus was the head, the middle, from him all things were created;  
Zeus was Man, and again Zeus was the Virgin Eternal."</span>

And in another passage, speaking of Adonis:--

<span class="small">"Hear me, who pray to thee, hear me O many-named and
best of deities,  
Thou, with thy gracious hair . . . both maiden and youth,
Adonis."</span>

Again, with regard to the latter, Ptolemaeus Hephaestius (according to
Photius) writes:--"They

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

say that the androgyne Adonis fulfilled the part of a man for Aphrodite,
but for Apollo the part of a wife." <span id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md)

Dionysus, one of the most remarkable figures in the Greek Mythology, is
frequently represented as androgyne. Euripides in his *Bacchae* calls
him "feminine-formed" (Θηλύμορφος) or thelumorphos, and the Orphic hymns
"double-sexed" (διφύης) or diphues; and Aristides in his discourse on
Dionysus says:--"Thus the God is both male and female. His form
corresponds to his nature, since everywhere in himself he is like a
double being; for among young men he is a maiden, and among maidens a
young man, and among men a beardless youth overflowing with vitality."
In the museum at Naples there is a very fine sculptured head of
Dionysus, which though bearded has a very feminine expression, and is
remindful of the traditional head of Christ. "In legend and art," says
Dr. Frazer, <span id="fr_51"></span>[2](#fn_51.md) "there are clear traces
of an effeminate Dionysus, and in some of his rites and processions men
wore female attire. Similar things are reported of Bacchus, who was, of
course, another form of Dionysus. Even Hercules, that most masculine
figure, was said to have dressed as a woman for three years, during
which he was the

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

slave of Omphale, queen of Lydia. "If we suppose," says Dr.
Frazer, <span id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md)" that queen Omphale, like
queen Semiramis, was nothing but the great Asiatic goddess, or one of
her Avatars, it becomes probable that the story of the womanish Hercules
of Lydia preserves a reminiscence of a line or college of effeminate
priests who, like the eunuch priests of the Syrian goddess, dressed as
women in imitation of their goddess, and were supposed to be inspired by
her. The probability is increased by the practice of the priests of
Heracles at Antimachia in Cos, who, as we have just seen, actually wore
female attire when they were engaged in their sacred duties. Similarly
at the vernal mysteries of Hercules in Rome the men were draped in the
garments of women."

Such instances could be rather indefinitely multiplied. Apollo is
generally represented with a feminine--sometimes with an extremely
feminine--bust and figure. The great hero Achilles passed his youth
among women, and in female disguise. Every one knows the recumbent
marble Hermaphrodite in the Louvre. There are also in the same
collection two or three elegant bronzes of Aphrodite-like female figures
in the standing position--but of masculine sex. What is the explanation
of all this?

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

It is evident that the conception of a double sex, or of a sex combining
the characters of male and female, haunted the minds of early peoples.
Yet we have no reason for supposing that such a combination, in any
complete and literal sense, ever existed. Modern physiological
investigation has never produced a single case of a human being
furnished with the complete organs of both sexes, and capable of
fulfilling the functions of both. And the unfortunate malformations
which do exist in this direction are too obviously abortive and
exceptional to admit of their being generalised or exalted into any kind
of norm or ideal. All we can say is that--though in the literal sense no
double forms exist--certainly a. vast number of intermediate forms of
male and female are actually found, which are double in the sense that
the complete organs of one sex are conjoined with some or nearly all of
the (secondary) characters of the other sex; and that we have every
reason to believe that these intermediate types have existed in
considerable numbers from the remotest antiquity. That being so, it is
possible that the observation or influence of these intermediate types
led to a tentative and confused idealisation of a double type.

Anyhow the fact remains--that these idealisations of the double type are
so numerous. And it

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

is interesting to notice that while they begin in early times with being
merely grotesque and symbolical, they end in the later periods by
becoming artistic and gracious and approximated to the real and actual.
The Indian Siva, with his right side masculine and his left side
feminine, is in no way beautiful or attractive; any more than Brahma
with twenty arms and twenty legs. And the same may be said of the
bearded Egyptian Isis or the bearded Syrian Aphrodite. These were only
rude and inartistic methods of conveying an idea. The later spirit,
however, found a better way of expression. It took its cue from the
variations of type to be seen every day in the actual world; and instead
of representing the Persian Mithra as a two-sexed monster, it made him a
young *man*, but of very feminine outline. The same with the Greek
Apollo; while on the other hand, the female who is verging toward the
male type is represented by Artemis or even by the Amazons.

It may be said:--we can understand this representation of intermediate
forms from actual life, but we do not see why such mingling of the sexes
should be ascribed to the gods, unless it might be from a merely
fanciful tendency to personify the two great powers of nature in one
being--in which case it is strange that the tendency should have been so
universal. To this we may reply that

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

probably the reason or reasons for this tendency must be accounted quite
deep-rooted and anything but fanciful. One reason, it seems to me, is
the psychological fact that in the deeps of human nature (as represented
by Brahm and Siva in the Hindu philosophy, by Zeus in the Orphic Hymns,
by Mithra in the Zend-avesta, etc.) the sex-temperament *is*
undifferentiated; <span id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53.md) and it is only in
its later and more external and partial manifestations that it branches
decidedly into male and female; and that, therefore, in endeavoring
through religion to represent the root facts of life, there was always a
tendency to cultivate and honor hermaphroditism, and to ascribe some
degree of this quality to heroes and divinities. The other possible
reason is that as a matter of fact the great leaders and heroes *did*
often exhibit this blending of masculine and feminine qualities and
habits in their actual lives, and that therefore at some later period,
when exalted to divinities, this blending of qualities was strongly
ascribed to them and was celebrated in the rites and ceremonies of their
religion and their temples. The feminine traits in genius (as in a
Shelley or a Byron) are well marked in the present day. We have only to
go back to the Persian Bâb

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

of the last century <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md) or to a St.
Francis or even to a Jesus of Nazareth, to find the same traits present
in founders and leaders of religious movements in historical times. And
it becomes easy to suppose the same again of those early figures--who
once probably were men--those Apollos, Buddhas, Dionysus, Osiris, and so
forth--to suppose that they too were somewhat bi-sexual in temperament,
and that it was really largely owing to that fact that they were endowed
with far-reaching powers and became leaders of mankind. In either
case--whichever reason is adopted--it corroborates the general thesis
and argument of this paper.
