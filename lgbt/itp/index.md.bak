In this ground-breaking study of homosexuality, Edward Carpenter reviews
an extensive body of literature, including accounts of Shamans and
Bedarches (transgenders) in tribal society, and same-sex unions in
ancient Greece and feudal Japan. This book includes much that has a
direct bearing on issues of gay spirituality, including a discussion of
the *Kedushim*, the priests of the ancient Near Eastern Goddess
religion, and target of the Levitical anti-sodomy and
anti-cross-dressing regulations. There is also a mention of the
sanctioned Christian male same-sex unions in the Balkans, which gives a
new dimension to recent controversies. The chapter on same-sex unions in
feudal Japan is also of particular interest, as it deals with a topic
very rarely dealt with by western writers.
