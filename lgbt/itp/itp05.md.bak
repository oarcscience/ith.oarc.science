### CHAPTER II.

### As Wizard or Witch

PERHAPS--as it is now generally considered that the belief in Magic
preceded what we call religion, and that the wizard came in order of
development before the priest--I ought to have placed the present
chapter first; but for some reasons the order adopted seems the better.
Anyhow it is certain that among primitive folk the prophet, the priest,
the wizard, and the witch-doctor largely unite their functions, and are
not easily distinguishable from one another; and therefore, from what
has already been said, we may naturally expect to find an association
between homosexuality and sorcery.

Westermarck (vol. i., p. 477) mentions the ancient Scandinavians as
regarding passive homosexuals in the light of sorcerers; and refers (p.
484 note) to Thomas Falkner, who, in his *Description of Patagonia*
(1775), p. 117, says that among the Patagonians "the wizards are of both
sexes. The

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

male wizards are obliged (as it were) to leave their sex, and to dress
themselves in female apparel, and are not permitted to marry, though the
female ones or witches may. They are generally chosen for this office
when they are children, and a preference is always shown to those who at
that early time of life discover an effeminate disposition. They are
clothed very early in female attire, and presented with the drum and
rattles belonging to the profession they are to follow."

The following is an account given by Dawydow, the Russian
traveller, <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) of the quite similar
custom prevalent in his time (about 1800) among the Konyagas in the
Alaska region:--"There are here (in the island of Kadiak) men with
tatooed chins, who work only as women, who always live with the
women-kind, and like the latter, have husbands;--not infrequently even
two. Such men are called Achnutschik. They are not by any means
despised, but, on the contrary, are respected in the settlements, and
are for the most part *wizards*. The Konyaga, who possesses an
Achnutschik instead of a wife, is even thought fortunate. When father or
mother regard their son as feminine in his bearing they will often
dedicate him in earliest childhood to the vocation of Achnutschik.
Sometimes

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

it will happen that the parents have in mind beforehand to have a
daughter, and when they find themselves disappointed they make their
new-born son an Achnutschik."

Here we have the association between homosexuality and sorcery clearly
indicated for the very extremes, South and North, of the American
continent; and, as a matter of fact, and as appears from various other
passages in the present work, the same association may be traced among
countless tribes of the middle regions of the same continent, and all
over the world. There was a legend current among the North American
Indians at one time <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) about a
Bardache, or man of this kind, who was shot at by an enraged warrior of
his own tribe; but when the onlookers ran to the place where the
transfixed man fell they found only an arrow sticking in a heap of
stones. The man had disappeared!

With regard to the attribution of homosexuality also to female wizards,
or witches, I believe that, rightly or wrongly, this was very common in
Europe a few centuries ago. Leo Africanus (1492) in his description of
Morocco <span id="fr_24"></span>[2](#fn_24.md) says, "The third kind of
diviners are women-witches, which are affirmed to

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

have familiarity with divels. Changing their voices they fain the divell
to speak within them: then they which come to enquire ought with greate
feare and trembling (to) aske these vile and abominable witches such
questions as they mean to propound, and lastly, offering some fee unto
the divell, they depart. But the wiser and honester sort of people call
these women *Sahacat*, which in Latin signifieth *Fricatrices*, because
they have a damnable custom to commit unlawful venerie among themselves,
which I cannot express in any modester terms." He then goes on to say
that these witches, carnally desiring some of the young women who come
to "enquire," entrap them and corrupt them so far as actually to cause
them in some cases to "desire the companie of those witches" (and to
that end, he explains, deceive their husbands). Whether this is all true
or not--and probably it is quite vulgarly exaggerated--it shows the kind
of thing that was believed at that time about witches.

In some cases the adoption of the life of priest or sorcerer is
accompanied by a change of dress (as we have seen), but this is by no
means always so. Speaking of the Pelew Islanders, Dr. Frazer <span
id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md) attributes the adoption by the priests of
female attire to the fact that "it often happens that a goddess chooses
a man, not a woman, for her

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

minister and inspired mouthpiece. When that is so, the favoured man is
thenceforth regarded and treated as a woman." And he continues--"This
pretended change of sex under the inspiration of a female spirit perhaps
explains a custom widely spread among savages, in accordance with which
some men dress as women and act as women through life."

This explanation is certainly not very convincing--though it is just
possible that in certain cases of men of this kind in early times, the
feminine part of their natures may have personified itself, and
presented itself to them as a vision of a female spirit or goddess; and
thus the explanation might be justified. But anyhow it should not be
overlooked that the same impulse (for men to dress as women, and women
to dress as men) perseveres to-day in quite a large percentage of our
modern civilised populations; and whatever its explanations, the impulse
is often enormously powerful, and its satisfaction a source of great
delight. It must also not be overlooked, in dealing with this complex
and difficult subject, that the mere fact of a person delighting to
adopt the garb of the opposite sex does not in. itself prove that his or
her love-tendency is abnormal--*i.e.*, cross-dressing does not prove
homosexuality. There are not a few cases of men in the present day (and
presumably

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

the same in past times) who love to dress as women and yet are perfectly
normal in their sex-relations; and therefore too sweeping
generalisations on this subject must be avoided. <span
id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md)

On the whole, however, cross-dressing must be taken as a general
indication of, and a cognate phenomenon to, homosexuality; and its wide
prevalence in early times, especially in connection with the priesthood,
must give us much matter for thought. Dr. Frazer, in his *Adonis, Attis,
and Osiris*, continuing the passage I have just quoted, says:--"These
unsexed creatures often, perhaps generally, profess the arts of sorcery
and healing, they communicate with spirits and are regarded sometimes
with awe and sometimes with contempt, as beings of a higher or lower
order than common folk. Often they are dedicated or trained to their
vocation from childhood. Effeminate sorcerers or priests of this sort
are found among the Sea Dyaks of Borneo, the Bugis of South Celebes, the
Patagonians of South America. . . . In Madagascar we hear of effeminate
men who wore female attire and acted as women, thinking thereby to do
God service. In the kingdom of Congo there was a sacrificial priest who
commonly dressed as a woman and gloried in the title of the
grandmother."

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

And Dr. Karsch, in his *Uranismus bei den Natur: völkern*, after
enumerating the above and many other instances, says that among many or
most of these tribes the main object of the cross-dressing seems to be
something of a religious or mystical character, since the persons
concerned are accounted as beings of a higher order, priests or
sorcerers; but that fact does not stand in the way of the homosexual
relationship, which certainly prevails in many cases.

An important point in all this matter, and one which on the one hand
gives an air of sincerity to the phenomenon, and on the other may easily
have connected it with magic and sorcery in the primitive mind, is the
rapidity and decisiveness with which the sexual transformation sometimes
seems to take place. This is indicated in Dr. Frazer's just-quoted
passage on the Pelew Islanders; and in such cases we seem to be
witnessing a veritable metamorphosis, and cannot help wondering whether
a real psychological or physiological transmutation may not be in
progress. For though sometimes, as we have seen, children are brought up
from an early age to play this exchanged or inverted part in life, yet
often they take it up themselves, and cannot be persuaded to abandon it;
and often they quite suddenly adopt it as young men (or women) or in
mature age--as the result of some supposed

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

dream or inspiration. Wied, lately quoted, says concerning the
Bardaches:--"These generally assert that a dream or some high impulse
has commanded them to adopt this state as their 'medicine' or salvation,
and nothing then can turn them away from their purpose. Many a father
has sought even by force to divert his child from this object, has
reasoned with him at first, offered him fine weapons and masculine
articles of dress in order to inspire him with a taste for manly
occupations; and when this proved useless, has handled him sternly,
punished and beaten him, yet all in vain." <span
id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md)

John T. Irving, in his *Indian Sketches* (1835)--a description of the
Pawnee and other American Indians-has a whole chapter (ch. xxii.)
entitled "The Metamorphosis" and dealing with this subject. He there
describes how among a group of female Indians occupied in drying shelled
corn in the sun, he one day noticed what seemed a particularly tall and
powerful woman--who, on enquiry, turned out to be a man. This man's
story was as follows. Once an Otoe brave of the highest renown, he on
one occasion, after a desperate fight with the Osages, returned home,
and refusing to speak to anyone, threw himself on his bed for the night.
In the morning he rose up an

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

altered man. "He collected his family round him, and informed them that
the Great Spirit had visited him in a dream, and had told him he had now
reached the zenith of his reputation; that no voice had more weight in
the Council; no arm was heavier in battle. But that he must thenceforth
relinquish all claim to the rank of a warrior and assume the dress and
avocations of a female." His friends heard him in sorrow, but did not
attempt to dissuade him, "for they listened to the communications of the
deity with a veneration equal to his own." So he snapped his bow in
twain, buried his tomahawk and rifle, washed off his war paint,
discarded the eagle plume from his scalp-lock, and ceased to be numbered
among the warriors, relinquishing all "for the lowly and servile duties
of a female."

Years had elapsed, says the author, since that act of renunciation, but
the man had kept to his resolve.

These strange changes, induced in childhood, or spontaneously adopted in
youth, maturity, and even old age, have been observed amongst almost all
the North American Indian tribes. Wied mentions the Sauks, Foxes,
Mandans, Crows, Blackfeet, Dakotas, Assimboins, and others. And their
connection with the Moon seems to be frequently believed in. W. H.
Keating, in his *Expedition to* 

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

Lake Winnipeck (2 vols., 1824), says that the Sun among the Winnebagos
is held to be propitious to man; but "the Moon, on the contrary, they
held to be inhabited by an adverse female deity, whose delight is to
cross man in all his pursuits. If, during their sleep, this deity should
present herself to them in their dreams, the Indians consider it
enjoined on them by duty to become *cinædi*; and they ever after assume
the female garb. It is not impossible (continues Keating) that this may
have been the source of the numerous stories of hermaphrodites related
by all the old writers on America."

Whatever may be the truth about the connection between these strange
changes of sexual habit and visionary appearances of the deities (a
subject on which I shall touch again later on), we cannot help seeing,
as I say, that the fervent belief in such connection is a testimony to
the sincerity and actuality of the transformations, as well as a partial
explanation of why sorcerous and miraculous powers were credited to the
transformed persons. At any rate, the total mass of facts connecting
homosexualism in general with religion and divination, or with unusual
psychic powers, and on the same lines as those already presented in this
and the preceding chapter, is enormously large; and we need delay no
longer on their further accumulation.

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> We may, however,
venture to say a few words in possible explanation of the connection.

Dr. Iwan Bloch, in his monumental work, *Die Prostitution*, <span
id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md) leans to the general explanation that
homosexuality, just on account of its strange and inexplicable
character, was by primitive people accounted as something divine and
miraculous, and the homosexual man or woman therefore credited with
supernatural powers. He says (vol. i., p. 101), "This riddle, which
despite all our efforts, present-day science has not yet satisfactorily
solved, must to the primitive intelligence have appeared even more
inexplicable than to us; and a man born with the inclination towards his
own sex must have been regarded as something extraordinary, as one of
those strange freaks of Nature which among Primitives are so easily
accounted divine marvels and honored as such. The by no means scanty
supply of ethnological facts on this subject which we possess confirms
the above view, and shows in what odour of sanctity homosexual
individuals have often stood among Nature-folk-for which reason they
frequently played an important part in religious rituals and festivals."

Bloch also quotes a theory of Adolf Bastian, who, in his great work,
*Der Mensch in der Geschichte*, supposes that the priests among early

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

peoples, as representatives of the *bisexual* principle in Nature,
encouraged homosexual rites in the temples on the same footing as
heterosexual rites. "The men," says Bastian, "prayed to the active
powers of Nature, and the women, in privacy and retirement, to the
feminine powers; while the priests, who had to satisfy the demands of
both parties, learned the idea of sex-changes from the Moon, and served
the masculine gods in masculine attire, and the goddesses in feminine
garments, or set up images of a bearded Venus and of a Herkules spinning
at the wheel."

Neither of these explanations seems to me to be quite adequate. That of
Bloch is hardly sufficient; for though it is true that freaks of Nature
are often regarded with superstitious awe by savages, that fact does not
quite suffice to explain the world-wide attribution of magic powers to
homosexuals, nor the systematic adoption of the services of such folk in
the temples. The theory of Bastian, on the other band, is quite opposed
to that of Bloch, for it pre-supposes a very wide original prevalence of
homosexuality in the human race, which was only preserved (and not
instituted) by the priests in the tradition of the religious rituals;
and therefore it cuts away the speculation that the homosexual man was
divinised on account of his rarity. Moreover, the theory of Bastian
suffers from the fact

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

that the supposed wide prevalence of bisexuality in aboriginal times is
by no means proved, or indeed easily provable--although, of course, it
may have existed. However, on the subject of bisexuality I shall touch
in a later chapter.

For myself, I think that there are two quite possible and not
unreasonable theories on the whole matter. The first and most important
is that there really is a connection between the homosexual temperament
and divinatory or unusual psychic powers; the second is (that there is
no such particular connection, but) that the idea of sorcery or
witchcraft naturally and commonly springs up round the ceremonials of an
old religion or morality when that religion is being superseded by a new
one. This is, of course, a well-recognised fact. The gods of one
religion become the devils of its successor; the poetic rites of one age
become the black magic of the next. But in the case of the primitive
religions of the earth their ceremonials were, without doubt, very
largely sexual, and even homosexual. Consequently, when new religious
developments set in, the homosexual rites, which were most foreign to
the later religionists and most disturbing to their ideas, associated
themselves *most* strongly with the notion of sorcery and occult powers.

For myself I am inclined to accept both explanations,

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

and--leaving out, of course, the clause in brackets in the second--to
combine them. I think there *is* an organic connection between the
homosexual temperament and unusual psychic or divinatory powers; but I
think also that the causes mentioned in the second explanation have in
many cases led to an exaggerated belief in such connection, and have
given it a sorcerous or demonic aspect.

To take the second point first. just as, according to Darwin, the
sharpest rivalry occurs between a species and the closely allied species
from which it has sprung, so in any religion there is the fiercest
theological hatred against the form which has immediately preceded it.
Early Christianity could never say enough against the Pagan cults of the
old world (partly for the very reason that it embodied so much of their
ceremonial and was in many respects their lineal descendant). They were
the work and inspiration of the devil. Their Eucharists and baptismal
rites and initiations--so strangely and diabolically similar to the
Christian rites--were sheer black magic; their belief in the sacredness
of sex mere filthiness. Similarly the early Protestants could never say
malignant things enough against the Roman Catholics; or the Secularists
in their turn against the Protestants. In all these cases there is an
element of fear--fear because

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

the thing supposed to have been left behind lies after all so close, and
is always waiting to reassert itself--and this fear invests the hated
symbol or person with a halo of devilish potency. Think, for instance,
what sinister and magical powers and influence have been commonly
ascribed to the Roman Catholic priests in the ordinary Protestant
parlours and circles!

It is easy, therefore, to understand that when the Jews established
their worship of Jehovah as a great reaction against the primitive
nature-cults of Syria--and in that way to become in time the germ of
Christianity--the first thing they did was to denounce the priests and
satellites of Baal-Peor and Ashtoreth as wizards and sorcerers, and
wielders of devilish faculties. These cults were frankly
sexual--probably the most intimate meaning of them, as religions, being
the glory and sacredness of sex; but the Jews (like the later
Christians) blinding themselves to this aspect, were constrained to see
in sex only filthiness, and in its religious devotees persons in league
with Beelzebub and the powers of darkness. And, of course, the
homosexual elements in these cults, being the most foreign to the new
religion, stood out as the *most* sorcerous and the most magical part of
them. Westermarck points out ("Moral Ideas," ii. 489) that the Mediaeval
Christianity constantly associated

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

homosexuality with heresy--to such a degree in fact that the French word
*herite* or *heretique* was sometimes used in both connections; and that
*bougre* or *Bulgarian* was commonly used in both, though to begin with
it only denoted a sect of religious heretics who came from Bulgaria. And
he thinks that the violent reprobation and punishment of homosexuality
arose more from its connection in the general mind with heresy than from
direct aversion in the matter--more in fact from religious motives than
from secular ones.

But connecting with all this, we must not neglect the theory so ably
worked out by Prof. Karl Pearson among others--namely that the primitive
religions were not only sexual in character but that they were largely
founded on an early matriarchal order of society, in which women had the
predominant sway--descent being traced through them, and tribal affairs
largely managed by them, and in which the chief deities were goddesses,
and the priests and prophets mainly females. Exactly how far such an
order of society really extended in the past is apparently a doubtful
question; but that there are distinct traces of such matriarchal
institutions in certain localities and among some peoples seems to be
quite established. Karl Pearson, assuming the real prevalence of these
institutions in early times points out, reasonably enough,

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

that when Christianity became fairly established matriarchal rites and
festivals, lingering on in out-of-the-way places and among the
peasantry, would at once be interpreted as being devilish and sorcerous
in character, and the women (formerly priestesses) who conducted them
and perhaps recited snatches of ancient half-forgotten rituals, would be
accounted witches. "We have, therefore," he says, <span
id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md) "to look upon the witch as essentially the
degraded form of the old priestess, cunning in the knowledge of herbs
and medicine, jealous of the rites of the goddess she serves, and
preserving in spells and incantations such wisdom as early civilisation
possessed." This civilisation, he explains, included the "observing of
times and seasons," the knowledge of weather-lore, the invention of the
broom, the distaff, the cauldron, the pitchfork, the domestication of
the goat, the pig, the cock and the hen, and so forth-all which things
became symbols of the witch in later times, simply because originally
they were the inventions of woman and the insignia of her office, and so
the religious symbols of the Mother-goddess and her cult.

The connection of all this with homosexual customs is not at once clear;
but it has been suggested

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> --though I am not
sure that Karl Pearson himself supports this--that the primitive
religions of the Matriarchate may have ultimately led to men-priests
dressing in female attire. For when the matriarchal days were passing
away, and men were beginning to assert their predominance, it still may
have happened that the old religious customs lingering on may have
induced men to simulate the part of women and to dress as priestesses,
or at least have afforded them an excuse for so doing. <span
id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md) In this way it seems just possible that
the pendulum-swing of society from the matriarchate to the patriarchate
may have been accompanied by some degree of crasis and confusion between
the functions of the sexes, homosexual customs and tendencies may have
come to the fore, and the connection of homosexuality with the
priesthood may seem to be accounted for.

This explanation, however, though it certainly has a claim to be
mentioned, seems to me too risky and insecure for very much stress to be
laid upon it. In the first place the extent and prevalence of the
matriarchal order of society is a matter still very much disputed, and
to assume that at any early period of human history the same was
practically universal would be unjustified. In the second place,
granting the existence of the matriarchal

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

order and its transmutation into the patriarchal, the connection of this
change with the development of homosexual customs is still only a
speculation and a theory, supported by little direct evidence. On the
other hand, the facts to be explained--namely, the connection of
homosexuality with priesthood and divination--seem to be world-wide and
universal. Therefore, though we admit that the causes mentioned--namely
the attribution of magical qualities to old religious rites, and the
introduction of feminine inversions and disguises through the old
matriarchal custom--may account in part for the facts, and in particular
may in certain localities have given them a devilish or sorcerous
complexion, yet I think we must look deeper for the root-explanations of
the whole matter, and consider whether there may not be some fundamental
causes in human nature itself.
