# PREFACE.

THE following treatise on Greek Love was written in the year 1873, when
my mind was occupied with my *Studies of Greek Poets*. I printed ten
copies of it privately in 1883. It was only when I read the Terminal
Essay appended by Sir Richard Burton to his translation of the *Arabian
Nights* in 1886, that I became aware of M. H. E. Meier's article on
*Pæderastie* (Ersch and Gruber's *Encyclopædie*, Leipzig, Brockhaus,
1837). My treatise, therefore, is a wholly independent production. This
makes Meier's agreement (in Section 7 of his article) with the theory I
have set forth in Section X, regarding the North Hellenic origin of
Greek Love, and its Dorian character, the more remarkable. That two
students, working separately upon the same mass of material, should have
arrived at similar conclusions upon this point strongly confirms the
probability of the hypothesis.
