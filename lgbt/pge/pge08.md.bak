### VI.

Resuming the results of the last four sections, we find two separate
forms of masculine passion clearly marked in early Hellas--a noble and a
base, a spiritual and a sensual. To the distinction between them the
Greek conscience was acutely sensitive; and this distinction, in theory
at least, subsisted throughout their history. They worshipped Erôs, as
they worshipped Aphrodite, under the twofold titles of Ouranios
(celestial) and Pandemos (vulgar, or *volvivaga*); and, while they
regarded the one love with the highest approval, as the source of
courage and greatness of soul, they never publicly approved the other.
It is true, as will appear in the sequel of this essay, that boy-love in
its grossest form was tolerated in historic Hellas with an indulgence
which it never found in any Christian country, while heroic comradeship
remained an ideal hard to realise, and scarcely possible beyond the
limits of the strictest Dorian sect. Yet the language of philosophers,
historians, poets and orators is unmistakable. All testify alike to the
discrimination between vulgar and heroic love in the Greek mind. I
purpose to devote a separate section of this inquiry to the
investigation of these ethical distinctions. For the present, a

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

quotation from one of the most eloquent of the later rhetoricians will
sufficiently set forth the contrast, which the Greek race never wholly
forgot: <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md)--

"The one love is mad for pleasure; the other loves beauty. The one is an
involuntary sickness; the other is a sought enthusiasm. The one tends to
the good of the beloved; the other to the ruin of both. The one is
virtuous; the other incontinent in all its acts. The one has its end in
friendship; the other in hate. The one is freely given; the other is
bought and sold. The one brings praise; the other blame. The one is
Greek; the other is barbarous. The one is virile; the other effeminate.
The one is firm and constant; the other light and variable. The man who
loves the one love is a friend of God, a friend of law, fulfilled of
modesty, and free of speech. He dares to court his friend in daylight,
and rejoices in his love. He wrestles with him in the playground and
runs with him in the race, goes afield with him to the hunt, and in
battle fights for glory at his side. In his misfortune he suffers, and
at his death he dies with him. He needs no gloom of night, no desert
place, for this society. The other lover is a foe to heaven, for he is
out of tune and criminal; a foe to law, for he transgresses law.
Cowardly, despairing, shameless, haunting the dusk, lurking in desert
places and secret dens, he would fain be never seen consorting with his
friend, but shuns the light of day, and follows after night and
darkness, which the shepherd hates, but the thief loves."

And again, in the same dissertation, Maximus Tyrius speaks to like
purpose, clothing his precepts in imagery:--

"You see a fair body in bloom and full of promise of fruit. Spoil not,
defile not, touch not the blossom. Praise it, as some wayfarer may
praise a plant-even so by Phœbus' altar have I seen a young palm
shooting toward the sun. Refrain from Zeus' and Phœbus? tree; wait for
the fruit-season, and thou shalt love more righteously."

With the baser form of paiderastia I shall have little to do in this
essay. Vice of this kind does not vary to any great extent, whether we
observe it in Athens or in Rome, in Florence of the sixteenth or in
Paris of the nineteenth century; <span id="fr_8"></span>[2](#fn_8.md) nor
in Hellas was it more noticeable than elsewhere, except for its
comparative publicity. The nobler type of masculine love developed by
the Greeks is, on the contrary, almost unique <span
id="fr_9"></span>[3](#fn_9.md) in the history of the human race. It is that
which more than anything else distinguishes, the Greeks from the
barbarians of their own time, from the Romans, and from modern men in
all that appertains to the emotions. The immediate subject of the
ensuing inquiry

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

will, therefore, be that mixed form of paiderastia upon which the Greeks
prided themselves, which had for its heroic ideal the friendship of
Achilles and Patroclus, but which in historic times exhibited a
sensuality unknown to Homer. <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md) In
treating of this unique product of their civilisation I shall use the
terms *Greek Love*, understanding thereby a passionate and enthusiastic
attachment subsisting between man and youth, recognised by society and
protected by opinion, which, though it was not free from sensuality, did
not degenerate into mere licentiousness.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[8:1](pge08.htm#fr_10.md) Plato, in the *Phædrus*,
the *Symposium*, and the *Laws*, is decisive on the mixed nature of
paiderastia.
