<P>The treatment of paiderastia upon the Attic stage requires separate considerations. Nothing proves the popular acceptance and national approval of Greek love more forcibly to modern minds than the fact that tragedians like &AElig;schylus and Sophocles made it the subject of their dramas. From a notice in Athen&aelig;us it appears that Stesichorus, who first gave dramatic form to lyric poetry, composed interludes upon paiderastic subjects.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> But of these it is impossible to speak, since their very titles have been lost. What immediately follows, in the narrative of Athen&aelig;us, will serve as text for what I have to say upon this topic. "And Aeschylus, that mighty poet, and Sophocles brought masculine loves into the theatre through their tragedies. Wherefore some are wont to call tragedy a paiderast; and the spectators welcome such." Nothing, unfortunately, remains of the plays which justified this language but a few fragments cited by Aristophanes, Plutarch, Lucian, and Athen&aelig;us. To examine these will be the business of this section.</P>
<P>The tragedy of the <I>Myrmidones</I>, which formed part of a trilogy by &AElig;schylus upon the legend of Achilles, must have been popular at Athens, for Aristophanes quotes it no less than four times--twice in the <I>Frogs</I>, once in the <I>Birds</I>, and once in the <I>Ecclesiazus&aelig;</I>. We can reconstruct its general plan from the lines which have come down to us on the authority of the writers above mentioned.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_79"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> The play opened with an</P>

<P>anap&aelig;stic speech of the chorus, composed of the clansmen of Achilles, who upbraided him for staying idle in his tent while the Achaians suffered at the hands of Hector. Achilles replied with the metaphor of the eagle stricken by an arrow winged from one of his own feathers. Then the embassy of Phoenix arrived, and Patroclus was sent forth to battle. Achilles, meanwhile, engaged in a game of dice; and while he was thus employed Antilochus entered with the news of the death of Patroclus. The next fragment brings the whole scene vividly before our eves.</P>
<P>"Wail for me, Antilochus, rather than for the dead man--for me, Achilles, who still live." After this, the corpse of Patroclus was brought upon the stage, and the son of Peleus poured forth a lamentation over his friend. The <I>Threnos</I> of Achilles on this occasion was very celebrated among the ancients. One passage of unmeasured passion, which described the love which subsisted between the two heroes, has been quoted with varieties of reading by Lucian, Plutarch, and Athen&aelig;us.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_80"></A><A HREF="#fn_80"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Lucian says: "Achilles, bewailing the death of Patroclus with unhusbanded passion, broke forth into the truth in self-abandonment to woe." Athen&aelig;us gives the text as follows:--</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">"Hadst thou no reverence for the unsullied holiness of thighs, O thou ungrateful for the showers of kisses given."</FONT></P>
<P>What we have here chiefly to notice is the change which the tale of Achilles had undergone since Homer.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_81"></A><A HREF="#fn_81"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Homer represented Patroclus as older in years than the son of Peleus, but inferior to him in station; nor did he hint which of the friends was the <I>Erastes</I> of the other. That view of their comradeship had not occurred to him. &AElig;schylus makes Achilles the lover; and for this distortion of the Homeric legend he was severely criticised by Plato.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> At the same time, as the two lines quoted from the <I>Threnos</I> prove, he treated their affection from the point of view of post-Homeric paiderastia.</P>
<P>Sophocles also wrote a play upon the legend of Achilles, which bears for its title <I>Achilles' Loves</I>. Very little is left of this drama; but Hesychius has preserved one phrase which illustrates</P>
<P>

<P>the Greek notion that love was an effluence from the beloved person through the eyes into the lover's soul,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_83"></A><A HREF="#fn_83"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> while Stob&aelig;us quotes the beautiful simile by which love is compared to a piece of ice held in the hand by children.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Another play of Sophocles, the <I>Niobe</I>, is alluded to by Plutarch and by Athen&aelig;us for the paiderastia which it contained. Plutarch's words are these:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_85"></A><A HREF="#fn_85"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> "When the children of Niobe, in Sophocles, are being pierced and dying, one of them cries out, appealing to no other rescuer or ally than his lover: Ho! comrade, up and aid me!" Finally, Athen&aelig;us quotes a single line from the <I>Colchian Women</I> of Sophocles, which alludes to Ganymede, and runs as follows:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> "Inflaming with his thighs the royalty of Zeus."</P>
<P>Whether Euripides treated paiderastia directly in any of his plays is not quite certain, though the title <I>Chrysippus</I> and one fragment preserved from that tragedy--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">"Nature constrains me though I have sound judgment"--</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>justify us in believing that he made the crime of Laius his subject. It may be added that a passage in Cicero confirms this belief.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> The title of another tragedy, <I>Peirithous</I>, seems in like manner to point at friendship; while a beautiful quotation from the <I>Dictys</I> sufficiently indicates the high moral tone assumed by Euripides in treating of Greek love. It runs as follows:--"He was my friend; and never may love lead me to folly, nor to Kupris. There is, in truth, another kind of love--love for the soul, righteous, temperate., and good. Surely men ought to have made this law, that only the temperate and chaste should love, and send Kupris, daughter of Zeus, a-begging." The philosophic ideal of comradeship is here vitalised by the dramatic vigour of the poet; nor has the Hellenic conception of pure affection for "a soul, just, upright, temperate and good," been elsewhere more pithily expressed. The Euripidean conception of friendship, it may further be observed, is nobly personified in Pylades, who plays a generous and self-devoted part in the three tragedies of <I>Electra</I>, <I>Orestes</I>, and <I>Iphigenia in Tauris</I>.</P>
<P>Having collected these notices of tragedies which dealt with boy-love, it may be well to add a word upon comedies in the same relation. We hear of a <I>Paidika</I> by Sophron, a <I>Malthakoi</I> by the older Cratinus, a <I>Bapt&aelig;e</I> by Empolis, in which Alcibiades and his society were satirised. <I>Paiderastes</I> is the title of plays</P>

<P>by Diphilus and Antiphanes; <I>Ganymedes</I> of plays of Alkaeus, Antiphanes and Eubulus.</P>
<P>What has been quoted from &AElig;schylus and Sophocles sufficiently establishes the fact that paiderastia was publicly received with approbation on the tragic stage. This should make us cautious in rejecting the stories which are told about the love adventures of Sophocles.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Athen&aelig;us calls him a lover of lads, nor is it strange if, in the age of Pericles, and while he was producing the <I>Achilles' Loves</I>, he should have shared the tastes of which his race approved.</P>
<P>At this point it may be as well to mention a few illustrious names, which to the student of Greek art and literature are indissolubly connected with paiderastia. Parmenides, whose life, like that of Pythagoras, was accounted peculiarly holy, loved his pupil Zeno.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_89"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Pheidias loved Pantarkes, a youth of Elis, and carved his portrait in the figure of a victorious athlete at the foot of the Olympian Zeus.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_90"></A><A HREF="#fn_90"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Euripides is said to have loved the adult Agathon. Lysias, Demosthenes, and &AElig;schines, orators whose conduct was open to the most searching censure of malicious criticism, did not scruple to avow their love. Socrates described his philosophy as the science of erotics. Plato defined the highest form of human existence to be "philosophy together with paiderastia," and composed the celebrated epigrams on Aster and on Agathon. This list might be indefinitely lengthened.</P>
