This book is a ground-breaking study of the Greek institution of
*paiderastia*. This was a custom by which adolescent men made alliances
with older men of a romantic and sexual nature. The young men in
question were the same age as contemporary teen pop stars (aproximately
from puberty to the Athenian age of majority, 21). And they were treated
similarly, as celebrities, showered with gifts and attention, and fought
over by lovers. Philosophers such as Plato considered these same-sex
unions as a remedy for tyranny, the bedrock of a cultured society, and
the purest form of love.

The point of this essay is never made explicit, but it is still very
relevant. The ancient Greek civilization lasted for hundreds of years,
invented democracy, built amazing monumental buildings, developed
advanced philosophy, drama and literature, and defeated the Persian
empire. And no small part of this success was due to the openly
acknowledged contribution of gay people. This proves specious the
argument (most recently advanced by a certain President of the United
States) that homosexuals achieving parity in a society means the end of
civilization "as we know it".

Symonds, who also wrote [A Problem in Modern Ethics](../pme/index), was
an accomplished classicist, and a pioneering (if closeted) self-realized
gay person. This book was originally published privately for the use of
'Medical Psychologists and Jurists'; this figleaf was neccesary in the
repressive climate of Victorian England. The number of copies supposedly
was not to exceed 100; however, if the number of used 'first edition'
copies available is any indication the print run far exceeded that
number, or possibly this sensational tract had a number of pirate
editions.
