### IX.

Passing from myth to semi-legendary history, we find frequent mention
made of lovers in connection with the great achievements of the earliest
age of Hellas. What Pausanias and Phædrus are reported to have said in
the *Symposium* of Plato, is fully borne out by the records of the
numerous tyrannicides and self-devoted patriots who helped to establish
the liberties of the Greek cities. When Epimenides of Crete required a
human victim in his purification of Athens from the *Musos* of the
Megacleidæ, two lovers, Cratinus and Aristodemus, offered themselves as
a voluntary sacrifice for the city. <span id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md)
The youth died to propitiate the gods; the lover refused to live without
him. Chariton and Melanippus, who attempted to assassinate Phalaris of
Agrigentum, were lovers. <span id="fr_21"></span>[3](#fn_21.md) So were
Diocles and Philolaus, natives of Corinth, who removed to Thebes, and
after giving laws to their adopted city, died and were buried in one
grave. <span id="fr_22"></span>[4](#fn_22.md) Not less celebrated was
another Diocles, the Athenian exile, who fell near Megara in battle,
fighting for the boy he loved. <span id="fr_23"></span>[5](#fn_23.md) His
tomb was honoured with the rites and sacrifices specially reserved for
heroes. A similar story is told of the Thessalian horseman
Cleomachus. <span id="fr_24"></span>[6](#fn_24.md) This soldier rode into a
battle which was being fought between the people of Eretria and Chalkis,
inflamed with such enthusiasm for the youth he beloved, that he broke
the foemen's ranks and won the victory for the Chalkidians. After the
fight was over Cleomachus was found among the slain, but his corpse was
nobly buried; and from that time forward love was honoured by the men of
Chalkis. These stories might be paralleled from actual Greek history.
Plutarch, commenting upon the courage of the sacred band of
Thebans, <span id="fr_25"></span>[7](#fn_25.md) tells of a man "who, when
his enemy was going to kill him, earnestly requested him to run

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

him through the breast, that his lover might not blush to see him
wounded in the back." In order to illustrate the haughty temper of Greek
lovers, the same author, in his *Erotic Dialogue*, records the names of
Antileon of Metapontum, who braved a tyrant in the cause of a boy he
loved; <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md) of Crateas, who punished
Archelaus with death for an insult offered to him; of Pytholaus, who
treated Alexander of Pheræ in like manner; and of another youth who
killed the Ambracian tyrant Periander for a similar affront. <span
id="fr_27"></span>[2](#fn_27.md) To these tales we might add another told
by Plutarch in his Life of Demetrius Poliorketes. This man insulted a
boy called Damocles, who, finding no other way to save his honour,
jumped into a cauldron of boiling water and was killed upon the
spot. <span id="fr_28"></span>[3](#fn_28.md) A curious legend belonging to
semi-mythical romance related by Pausanias, <span
id="fr_29"></span>[4](#fn_29.md) deserves a place here, since it proves to
what extent the popular imagination was impregnated by notions of Greek
love. The city of Thespia was at one time infested by a dragon, and
young men were offered to appease its fury every year. They all died
unnamed and unremembered except one, Cleostratus. To clothe this youth,
his lover, Menestratus, forged a brazen coat of mail, thick set with
hooks turned upwards. The dragon swallowed Cleostratus and killed him,
but died by reason of the hooks. Thus love was the salvation of the city
and the source of immortality to the two friends.

It would not be difficult to multiply romances of this kind the
rhetoricians and moralists of later Greece abound in them. <span
id="fr_30"></span>[5](#fn_30.md) But the most famous of all remains to be
recorded. This is the story of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, who freed
Athens from the tyrant Hipparchus. There is not a speech, a poem, an
essay, a panegyrical oration in praise of either Athenian liberty or
Greek love which does not tell the tale of this heroic friendship.
Herodotus and Thucydides treat the event as matter of serious history.
Plato refers to it as the beginning of freedom for the Athenians. "The
drinking-song in honour of these lovers is one of the most precious
fragments of popular Greek poetry which we possess. As in the cases of
Lucretia and Virginia, so here a tyrant's intemperance was the occasion,
if not the

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

cause, of a great nation's rising. Harmodius and Aristogeiton were
reverenced as martyrs and saviours of their country. Their names gave
consecration to the love which made them bold against the despot, and
they became at Athens eponyms of "paiderastia." <span
