### VIII.

Among the myths to which Greek lovers referred with pride, besides that
of Achilles, were the legends of Theseus and Peirithous, of Orestes and
Pylades, of Talos and Rhadamanthus, of Damon and Pythias. Nearly all the
Greek gods, except, I think, oddly enough, Ares, were famous for their
love. Poseidon, according to Pindar, loved Pelops; Zeus, besides
Ganymede, was said to have carried off Chrysippus. Apollo loved
Hyacinth, and numbered among his favourites Branchos and Claros. Pan
loved Cyparissus, and the spirit of the evening star loved Hymenæus.
Hypnos, the God of slumber, loved Endymion, and sent him to sleep with
open eyes, in order that he might always gaze upon their beauty. (Ath.
xiii. 564). The myths of Phœbus, Pan, and Hesperus, it may be said in
passing, are paiderastic parallels to the tales of Adonis and Daphine.
They do not represent the specific quality of national Greek love at all
in the same way as the legends of Achilles, Theseus, Pylades, and
Pythias. We find in them merely a beautiful and romantic play of the
mythopœic fancy, after paiderastic had taken hold on the imagination of
the race. The case is different with Herakles, the patron, eponym, and
ancestor of Dorian Hellas. He was a boy-lover of the true heroic type.
In the innumerable amours ascribed to him we always discern the note of
martial comradeship. His passion for Iolaus was so famous that lovers
swore their oaths upon the Theban's tomb; <span

supplied Greek poets with one of their most charming subjects. From the
idyll of Theocritus called *Hylas* we learn some details about the
relation between lover and beloved, according to the heroic ideal.

"Nay, but the son of Amphitryon, that heart of bronze, he that abode the
wild lion's onset, loved a lad, beautiful Hylas--Hylas of the braided
locks,

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

and he taught him all things as a father teaches his child, all whereby
himself became a mighty man and renowned in minstrelsy. Never was he
apart from Hylas, . . . . and all this that the lad might be fashioned
to his mind, and might drive a straight furrow, and come to the true
measure of man." <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md)
