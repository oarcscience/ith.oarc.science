### IV.

Thus the tale of Achilles and Patroclus sanctioned among the Greeks a
form of masculine love, which, though afterwards connected with
paiderastia properly so called, we are justified in describing as
heroic, and in regarding as one of the highest products of their
emotional life. It will be seen, when we come to deal with the
historical manifestations of this passion,

that the heroic love which took its name from Homer's Achilles existed
as an ideal rather than an actual reality. This, however, is equally the
case with Christianity and chivalry. The facts of feudal history fall
below the high conception which hovered like a dream above the knights
and ladies of the Middle Ages; nor has the spirit of the Gospel been
realised, in fact, by the most Christian nations. Still we are not on
that account debarred from speaking of both chivalry and Christianity as
potent and effective forces.
