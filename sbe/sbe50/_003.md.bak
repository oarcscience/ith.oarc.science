### INTRODUCTORY NOTE

#### BY THE AUTHOR

*Habent sua fata libelli*—not only after they have been published, but
sometimes even before they are printed. It was in the spring of 1894
that the late Professor Max Müller first suggested to me that I should
compile a General Index of the names and subject-matter for the complete
series of the *Sacred Books of the East*. Such an Index, he thought,
would be a great help to all students of the *Sacred Books of the East*,
and of the greatest value for the study of the history of religions. The
matter was frequently discussed between us, and we both agreed that if
the Index was to be of any use it would have to be, not a bare list of
names and important words, with strings of references which no one would
have the patience to read through, but an *analytical* Index with
*extracts* and even *verbal quotations*, from which the student, with
the least possible trouble, might see to which volume and page he had to
refer for any information he might want. It was many weeks before the
plan took any definite shape: in June, 1894, I laid my proposal of
preparing the Index before the Delegates of the University Press, who
were from the beginning favourably inclined to it. But as I had to work
out a specimen from which the scale and the plan of the Index could be
seen more definitely, it was not until March, 1895, that the Delegates
could give their final sanction to the work.

Though some of the volumes of the series were still unpublished in
1895—vol. xliv appeared in 1900, and vol. xlviii not until 1904—it was
then thought possible to finish the Index volume within two years. When
I set to work, and began reading through volume after volume, making
notes and extracts for the Index, I certainly hoped that Professor Max
Müller would live to see it finished. But, alas, Fate had destined
otherwise. Only too soon I found that I had entirely miscalculated the
time and labour involved in

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

the compilation of the Index. By the spring of 1898 I had indeed read,
and made extracts from, all the volumes that had been published; I had
written some 70,000 slips, and these had been sorted and arranged
alphabetically. But in 1898 I left Oxford to return to my own country
and to a new sphere of work, and the preparation of the Index had to be
interrupted for nearly two years. When I took it up again in 1900 I soon
found that the huge mass of slips before me represented only the raw
material from which the building had to be constructed.

From the beginning it had been clear to me—and this was also Professor
Max Miller's view—that this Index volume could not be made like any
other Index, but must resemble a Manual of the History of Eastern
Religions. For it would have been of little use to collect, under such
headings as Ancestor Worship, Animals, Brahman, Buddha, Fire, Funeral
Rites, Future Life, God, Gods, Prayer, Sacrifice, Soul, &c., all the
passages bearing on these subjects as they occur in the volumes of the
*Sacred Books of the East*. It was necessary to make *sub-divisions* in
such articles, and to arrange the passages under different
*sub-headings*. It was this work of arranging and condensing the raw
material that caused so much delay. Many slips had to be rewritten, and
the volumes of the *Sacred Books* had constantly to be referred to, and
numerous passages to be verified.

These sub-divisions and sub-headings required most careful
consideration. It was not possible to make them according to one uniform
scheme; they had to be chosen in each case differently as seemed most
suitable for practical purposes. Sometimes it was advisable to make them
according to the different religions, sometimes according to the
subject-matter. Consistency could not be aimed at—the chief aim was
practical usefulness. Sometimes it seemed more practical to arrange the
passages under several sub-headings, sometimes it seemed preferable to
collect them under one heading, indicating subdivision by dashes (—).
But it is hardly necessary to enumerate all the devices by which the
compiler has tried to make the Index as handy as possible. The reader
will

<span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span>

easily find them out for himself. There was a time when German scholars
scouted the idea of writing or using an Index to learned books. It was
thought unworthy of a scholar to look to an Index for reference: he had
to read the whole book and all the books on any given subject. But
nowadays even German scholars have found out that life is short, and not
only art, but in an even greater degree, science is getting very long.
It has become impossible to get on without some time-saving machinery.
To make this Index supply as far as possible a contrivance of such a
kind has been the one and constant aim of the compiler.

*Verbal quotations* have been given—they are marked as such by the use
of *italics*—from passages that seemed especially characteristic and
important. That the Index should also include such verbal quotations,
was one of the very first suggestions made by Professor Max Muller.

The compiler of an Index to forty-nine volumes of translations from
seven different languages, belonging to as many religions, had to
grapple with peculiar difficulties. He had not only to make himself
acquainted with the terminologies of the different religions represented
in the *Sacred Books of the East*, but also to take into account the
different translations of the same terms by different translators,
sometimes also different spellings of the same names in different
volumes. I have tried, as far as was practicable, to collect all things
belonging together under one heading, but I must apologize for any
inconsistencies that will be found, especially under the letter A.
There, e. g. 'Ahura-Mazda' and 'Aûha*r*ma*zd*' are given as two separate
articles, while later on in such cases all the passages would have been
collected under *one* heading. While apologizing for such and other
inconsistencies (which could only have been avoided if the whole
manuscript of the Index had been rewritten and its publication delayed
still longer), I hope to have given so many *cross-references* that
these inconsistencies will not be felt as any serious inconvenience.

When I venture to claim for this volume the title of a sort of Manual of
the History of Eastern Religions, I hope I may not be misunderstood.
Many books on the History and

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Science of
Religion have been written during the last twenty years. But most of
these books are more concerned with theories on the origin and
development of religion than with what, in my humble opinion, should be
the foundation of all such theories—a *scientific classification of
religious phenomena*. Is it too presumptuous to hope that this Index may
prove to be of some help for the fulfilment of this *desideratum* of the
Science of Religion? The Index may prove useful, not only for what it
contains, but also for what it does *not* contain. The student of
religion will look in vain in this Index for such terms as Animism,
Fetishism, Tabu, Totemism, and the like. May not this be a useful
warning that these terms refer only to the theories and not to the facts
of religion? On the other hand, the student will be assured that
everything he finds in this Index is a religious fact. Moreover, many
things will be found in the Index that, from our point of view, do not
refer to religion at all, but to all kinds of matters of importance for
the Antiquarian—the student of ancient law, customs, manners, art, and
economic life. For there is hardly any phase of human life that is not
in some way or other touched upon in the *Sacred Books of the East*—for
the simple reason that in ancient religion almost anything and
everything has some religious aspect. This is in itself an important
lesson to learn. Besides, it shows how useful the Index, and of course
still more the *Sacred Books* themselves, must be for all students of
the ancient civilizations of India, Persia, China, and Arabia. And if
the Index should do nothing else but help to promote the study of the
*Sacred Books of the East*, the time and labour devoted to its
compilation will not be thrown away.

In conclusion. I have to express my sincere thanks to the Delegates of
the University Press for the sacrifices incurred in the publication of
this volume, and for the patience they have shown with the many delays
that have retarded the completion of the work.
