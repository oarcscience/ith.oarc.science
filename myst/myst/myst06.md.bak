### III. Mysticism and Psychology

<span id="an_iii.iii"></span>

<span id="an_iii.iii-p1"></span>We<span id="an_iii.iii-p1.1"></span>
come now to consider the mental apparatus which is at the disposal of
the self: to ask what it can tell us of the method by which she may
escape from the prison of the sense-world, transcend its rhythm, and
attain knowledge of—or conscious contact with—a supra-sensible Reality.
We have seen the normal self shut within that prison, and making, by the
help of science and of philosophy, a survey of the premises and
furniture: testing the thickness of the walls and speculating on the
possibility of trustworthy news from without penetrating to her cell.
Shut with her in that cell, two forces, the desire to know more and the
desire to love more, are ceaselessly at work. Where the first of these
cravings predominates, we call the result a philosophical or a
scientific temperament; where it is overpowered by the ardour of
unsatisfied love, the self’s reaction upon things becomes poetic,
artistic, and characteristically—though not always explicitly—religious.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p2"></span>We have seen further that a certain
number of persons declare that they have escaped from the prison. Have
they done so, it can only be in order to satisfy these two hungry
desires, for these, and these only, make that a prison which might
otherwise be a comfortable hotel; and since, in varying degrees, these
desires are in all of us, active or latent, it is clearly worth while to
discover, if we can, the weak point in the walls, and method of
achieving this one possible way of escape. <span id="page_45">p.
45</span> <span id="an_iii.iii-Page_45"></span>

<span id="an_iii.iii-p3"></span>Before we try to define in psychological
language the way in which the mystic slips the fetters of sense, sets
out upon his journey towards home, it seems well to examine the
machinery which is at the disposal of the normal, conscious self: the
creature, or part of a creature, which we recognize as “ourselves.” The
older psychologists were accustomed to say that the messages from the
outer world awaken in that self three main forms of activity. (1) They
arouse movements of attraction or repulsion, of desire or distaste;
which vary in intensity from the semi-conscious cravings of the hungry
infant to the passions of the lover, artist, or fanatic. (2) They
stimulate a sort of digestive process, in which she combines and
cogitates upon the material presented to her; finally absorbing a
certain number of the resulting concepts and making them part of herself
or of her world, (3) The movements of desire, or the action of reason,
or both in varying combinations, awaken in her a determination by which
percept and concept issue in action; bodily, mental, or spiritual.
Hence, the main aspects of the self were classified as Emotion,
Intellect, and Will: and the individual temperament was regarded as
emotional, intellectual, or volitional, according to whether feeling,
thought, or will assumed the reins.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p4"></span>Modern psychologists have moved away
from this diagrammatic conception, and incline more and more to dwell
upon the unity of the psyche—that hypothetical self which none have ever
seen—and on some aspect of its energetic desire, its *libido,* or
“hormic drive” as the ruling factor of its life. These conceptions are
useful to the student of mysticism, though they cannot be accepted
uncritically or regarded as complete.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p5"></span>Now the unsatisfied psyche in her
emotional aspect wants, as we have said, to love more; her curious
intellect wants to know more. The awakened human creature suspects that
both appetites are being kept on a low diet; that there really is more
to love, and more to know, somewhere in the mysterious world without,
and further that its powers of affection and understanding are worthy of
some greater and more durable objective than that provided by the
illusions of sense. Urged therefore by the cravings of feeling or of
thought, consciousness is always trying to run out to the encounter of
the Absolute, and always being forced to return. The neat philosophical
system, the diagrams of science, the “sunset-touch,” are tried in turn.
Art and life, the accidents of our humanity, may foster an emotional
outlook; till the moment in which the neglected intellect arises and
pronounces such an outlook to have no validity. Metaphysics and science
seem to offer to the intellect an open window towards truth; till the
heart looks out and declares this landscape to be a chill desert in
which <span id="page_46">p. 46</span> <span
id="an_iii.iii-Page_46"></span> she can find no nourishment. These
diverse aspects of things must be either fused or transcended if the
whole self is to be satisfied; for the reality which she seeks has got
to meet both claims and pay in full.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p6"></span>When Dionysius the Areopagite divided
those angels who stand nearest God into the Seraphs who are aflame with
perfect love, and the Cherubs who are filled with perfect knowledge, he
only gave expression to the two most intense aspirations of the human
soul, and described under an image the two-fold condition of that
Beatific Vision which is her goal.  <span id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md)

<span id="an_iii.iii-p8"></span>There is a sense in which it may be
said, that the desire of knowledge is a part of the desire of perfect
love: since one aspect of that all inclusive passion is clearly a
longing to know, in the deepest, fullest, closest sense, the thing
adored. Love’s characteristic activity—for Love, all wings, is
inherently active, and “cannot be lazy,” as the mystics say—is a quest,
an outgoing towards an object desired, which only when possessed will be
fully known, and only when fully known can be perfectly adored.  <span
id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md) Intimate communion, no less than worship,
is of its essence. Joyous fruition is its proper end. This is true of
all Love’s quests, whether the Beloved be human or divine—the bride, the
Grail, the Mystic Rose, the Plenitude of God. But there is no sense in
which it can be said that the desire of love is merely a part of the
desire of perfect knowledge: for that strictly intellectual ambition
includes no adoration, no self-spending, no reciprocity of feeling
between Knower and Known. Mere knowledge, taken alone, is a matter of
receiving, not of acting: of eyes, not wings: a dead alive business at
the best. There is thus a sharp distinction to be drawn between these
two great expressions of life: the energetic love, the passive
knowledge. One is related to the eager, outgoing activity, the dynamic
impulse to *do* somewhat, physical, mental, or spiritual, which is
inherent in all living things and which psychologists call *conation:*
the other to the indwelling consciousness, the passive knowing somewhat,
which they call *cognition.*

<span id="an_iii.iii-p10"></span>Now “conation” is almost wholly the
business of will, but of will stimulated by emotion: for wilful action
of every kind, however intellectual it may seem, is always the result of
interest, and <span id="page_47">p. 47</span> <span
id="an_iii.iii-Page_47"></span> interest involves feeling. We act
because we feel we want to; feel we must. Whether the inspiring force be
a mere preference or an overwhelming urge, our impulse to “do” is a
synthesis of determination and desire. All man’s achievements are the
result of conation, never of mere thought. “The intellect by itself
moves nothing,” said Aristotle, and modern psychology has but affirmed
this law. Hence his quest of Reality is never caused, though it may be
greatly assisted, by the intellectual aspect of his consciousness; for
the reasoning powers as such have little initiative. Their province is
analytic, not exploratory. They stay at home, dissecting and arranging
matter that comes to hand; and do not adventure beyond their own region
in search of food. Thought does not penetrate far into an object in
which the self feels no interest— *i.e.* , towards which she does not
experience a “conative” movement of attraction, of desire—for interest
is the only method known to us of arousing the will, and securing the
fixity of attention necessary to any intellectual process. None think
for long about anything for which they do not care; that is to say,
which does not touch some aspect of their emotional life. They may hate
it, love it, fear it, want it; but they must have some feeling about it.
Feeling is the tentacle we stretch out to the world of things.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p11"></span>Here the lesson of psychology is the
same as that which Dante brought back from his pilgrimage; the supreme
importance and harmonious movement of <span
id="an_iii.iii-p11.1"></span> *il desiro* and *<span
id="an_iii.iii-p11.2"></span> il velle. Si come rota ch’egualmente è
mossa ,*  <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md) these move together to
fulfil the Cosmic Plan. In all human life, in so far as it is not merely
a condition of passive “awareness,” the law which he found implicit in
the universe is the law of the individual mind. Not logic, not “common
sense,”but *<span id="an_iii.iii-p12.1"></span> l’amor che move il sole
e le altre stelle* the motive force of the spirit of man: in the
inventors, the philosophers, and the artists, no less than in the heroes
and in the saints.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p13"></span>The vindication of the importance of
feeling in our life, and in particular its primacy over reason in all
that has to do with man’s contact with the transcendental world, has
been one of the great achievements of modern psychology. In the sphere
of religion it is now acknowledged that “God known of the heart” gives a
better account of the character of our spiritual experience than “God
guessed at by the brain”; that the loving intuition is more fruitful and
more trustworthy than the dialectic proof. One by one the commonplaces
of mysticism are thus rediscovered by official science, and given their
proper place in the psychology of the spiritual life. Thus Leuba, hardly
a friendly witness, is found to agree with the Fourth Evangelist that
“Life, more life, a larger, richer, more satisfying life, is in the last
analysis the end of <span id="page_48">p. 48</span> <span
id="an_iii.iii-Page_48"></span> religion,”  <span
id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md) and we have seen that life, as we know
it, has the character of a purposive striving, more directly dependent
on will and feeling then on thought. Of this drive, this urge, thought
indeed is but the servant; a skilled and often arrogant servant, with a
constant tendency to usurpation. Some form of feeling—interest, desire,
fear, appetite—must supply the motive power. Without this, the will
would be dormant, and the intellect lapse into a calculating machine.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p15"></span>Further, “the heart has its reasons
which the mind knows not of.” It is a matter of experience that in our
moments of deep emotion, transitory though they be, we plunge deeper
into the reality of things than we can hope to do in hours of the most
brilliant argument. At the touch of passion doors fly open which logic
has battered on in vain: for passion rouses to activity not merely the
mind, but the whole vitality of man. It is the lover, the poet, the
mourner, the convert, who shares for a moment the mystic’s privilege of
lifting that Veil of Isis which science handles so helplessly, leaving
only her dirty fingermarks behind. The heart, eager and restless, goes
out into the unknown, and brings home, literally and actually, “fresh
food for thought.” Hence those who “feel to think” are likely to possess
a richer, more real, if less orderly, experience than those who “think
to feel.”

<span id="an_iii.iii-p16"></span>This psychological law, easily proved
in regard to earthly matters, holds good also upon the supersensual
plane. It was expressed once for all by the author of “The Cloud of
Unknowing” when he said of God, “By love He may be gotten and holden,
but by thought of understanding, never.”  <span
id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md) That exalted feeling, that “secret blind
love pressing,” not the neat deductions of logic, the apologist’s
“proofs” of the existence of the Absolute, unseals the eyes to things
unseen before. “Therefore,” says the same mystic “what time that thou
purposest thee to this work, and feelest by grace that thou art called
of God, lift then up thine heart unto God with a meek stirring of love;
and mean God that made thee and bought thee, and that graciously hath
called thee to thy degree and receive none other thought of God. And yet
not all these but if thou list; for it sufficeth thee enough, a naked
intent direct unto God without any other cause than Himself.”  <span
id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md) Here we see emotion at its proper work;
the movement of desire passing over at once into the act of
concentration, the gathering up of all the powers of the self into a
state of determined attention, which is the business of the Will. “This
driving and drawing,” says Ruysbroeck, “we feel in the heart and in the
unity of all our bodily powers, and especially in the desirous powers.”
 <span id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md) This act of perfect concentration,
<span id="page_49">p. 49</span> <span id="an_iii.iii-Page_49"></span>
the passionate focussing of the self upon one point, when it is applied
“with a naked intent” to real and transcendental things, constitutes in
the technical language of mysticism the state of recollection:  <span
id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md) a condition which is peculiarly
characteristic of the mystical consciousness, and is the necessary
prelude of pure contemplation, that state in which the mystic enters
into communion with Reality.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p21"></span>We have then arrived so far in our
description of the mechanism of the mystic. Possessed like other men of
powers of feeling, thought, and will, it is essential that his love and
his determination, even more than his thought, should be set upon
Transcendent Reality. He must feel a strong emotional attraction toward
the supersensual Object of his quest: that love which scholastic
philosophy defined as the force or power which causes every creature to
follow out the trend of its own nature. Of this must be born the will to
attain communion with that Absolute Object. This will, this burning and
active desire, must crystallize into and express itself by that definite
and conscious concentration of the whole self upon the Object, which
precedes the contemplative state. We see already how far astray are
those who look upon the mystical temperament as passive in type.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p22"></span>Our next concern, then, would seem to
be with this condition of contemplation: what it does and whither it
leads. What is (a) its psychological explanation and (b) its empirical
value? Now, in dealing with this, and other rare mental conditions, we
are of course trying to describe from without that which can only
adequately be described from within; which is as much as to say that
only mystics can really write about mysticism. Fortunately, many mystics
have so written; and we, from their experiences and from the
explorations of psychology upon another plane, are able to make certain
elementary deductions. It appears generally from these that the act of
contemplation is for the mystic a psychic gateway; a method of going
from one level of consciousness to another. In technical language it is
the condition under which he shifts his “field of perception” and
obtains his characteristic outlook on the universe. That there is such a
characteristic outlook, peculiar to no creed or race, is proved by the
history of mysticism; which demonstrates plainly enough that in some men
another sort of consciousness, another “sense,” may be liberated beyond
the normal powers we have discussed. This “sense” has attachments at
each point to emotion, to intellect, and to will. It can express itself
under each of the aspects which these terms connote. Yet it differs from
and transcends the emotional, intellectual, and volitional life of
ordinary men. It was recognized by <span id="page_50">p. 50</span> <span
id="an_iii.iii-Page_50"></span> Plato as that consciousness which could
apprehend the real world of the Ideas. Its development is the final
object of that education which his “Republic” describes. It is called by
Plotinus “Another intellect, different from that which reasons and is
denominated rational.”  <span id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md) Its
business, he says, is the perception of the supersensual—or, in
Neoplatonic language, the *intelligible* world. It is the sense which,
in the words of the “Theologia Germanica,” has “the power of seeing into
eternity,”  <span id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65.md) the “mysterious eye of
the soul” by which St. Augustine saw “the light that never changes.”
 <span id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66.md) It is, says Al Ghazzali, a Persian
mystic of the eleventh century, “like an immediate perception, as if one
touched its object with one’s hand.”  <span
id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67.md) In the words of his great Christian
successor, St. Bernard, “it may be defined as the soul’s true unerring
intuition, the unhesitating apprehension of truth”:  <span
id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68.md) which “simple vision of truth,” says St.
Thomas Aquinas, “ends in a movement of desire.”  <span
id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69.md)

<span id="an_iii.iii-p29"></span>It is infused with burning love, for it
seems to its possessors to be primarily a movement of the heart: with
intellectual subtlety, for its ardour is wholly spent upon the most
sublime object of thought: with unflinching will, for its adventures are
undertaken in the teeth of the natural doubts, prejudices, languors, and
self-indulgence of man. These adventures, looked upon by those who stay
at home as a form of the Higher Laziness, are in reality the last and
most arduous labours which the human spirit is called to perform. They
are the only known methods by which we can come into conscious
possession of all our powers; and, rising from the lower to the higher
levels of consciousness, become aware of that larger life in which we
are immersed, attain communion with the transcendent Personality in Whom
that life is resumed.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p30"></span>Mary has chosen the better, not the
idler part; for her gaze is directed towards those First Principles
without which the activity of Martha would have no meaning at all. In
vain does sardonic common sense, confronted with the contemplative type,
reiterate the sneer of Mucius, “Encore sont-ils heureux que la pauvre
Marthe leur fasse la cuisine.” It remains a paradox of the mystics that
the passivity at which they appear to aim is really a state of the most
intense activity: more, that where it is wholly absent no great creative
action can take place. In it, the superficial self compels itself to be
still, in order that it may liberate another <span id="page_51">p.
51</span> <span id="an_iii.iii-Page_51"></span> more deep-seated power
which is, in the ecstasy of the contemplative genius, raised to the
highest pitch of efficiency.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p31"></span>“This restful travail,” said Walter
Hilton, “is full far from fleshly idleness and from blind security. It
is full of ghostly work but it is called rest, for grace looseth the
heavy yoke of fleshly love from the soul and maketh it mighty and free
through the gift of the holy ghostly love for to work gladly, softly,
and delectably. . . . Therefore is it called an holy idleness and a rest
most busy; and so is it in *stillness* from the great crying and the
beastly noise of fleshly desires.”  <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md)

<span id="an_iii.iii-p33"></span>If those who have cultivated this
latent power be correct in their statements, the self was mistaken in
supposing herself to be entirely shut off from the true external
universe. She has, it seems certain tentacles which, once she learns to
uncurl them, will stretch sensitive fingers far beyond that limiting
envelope in which her normal consciousness is contained, and give her
news of a higher reality than that which can be deduced from the reports
of the senses. The fully developed and completely conscious human soul
can open as an anemone does, and *know* the ocean in which she is
bathed. This act, this condition of consciousness, in which barriers are
obliterated, the Absolute flows in on us, and we, rushing out to its
embrace, “find and feel the Infinite above all reason and above all
knowledge,”  <span id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md) is the true “mystical
state.” The value of contemplation is that it tends to produce this
state, release this transcendental sense; and so turns the “lower
servitude” in which the natural man lives under the sway of his earthly
environment to the “higher servitude” of fully conscious dependence on
that Reality “in Whom we live and move and have our being.”

<span id="an_iii.iii-p35"></span>What then, we ask, is the nature of
this special sense—this transcendental consciousness—and how does
contemplation liberate it?

<span id="an_iii.iii-p36"></span>Any attempt to answer this question
brings upon the scene another aspect of man’s psychic life: an aspect of
paramount importance to the student of the mystic type. We have reviewed
the chief ways in which our surface consciousness reacts upon
experience: a surface consciousness which has been trained through long
ages to deal with the universe of sense. We know, however, that the
personality of man is a far deeper and more mysterious thing than the
sum of his conscious feeling, thought and will: that this superficial
self—this Ego of which each of us is aware—hardly counts in comparison
with the deeps of being which it hides. “There is a root or depth in
thee,” says Law, “from whence all these faculties come forth as lines
from a centre, <span id="page_52">p. 52</span> <span
id="an_iii.iii-Page_52"></span> or as branches from the body of a tree.
This depth is called the centre, the fund, or bottom, of the soul. This
depth is the unity, the Eternity, I had almost said the infinity of thy
soul, for it is so infinite that nothing can satisfy it, or give it any
rest, but the infinity of God.”  <span id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md)

<span id="an_iii.iii-p38"></span>Since normal man is utterly unable to
set up relations with spiritual reality by means of his feeling,
thought, and will, it is clearly in this depth of being—in these
unplumbed levels of personality—that we must search, if we would find
the organ, the power, by which he is to achieve the mystic quest. That
alteration of consciousness which takes place in contemplation can only
mean the emergence from this “fund or bottom of the soul” of some
faculty which diurnal life keeps hidden “in the deeps.”

<span id="an_iii.iii-p39"></span>Modern psychology, in its doctrine of
the unconscious or subliminal personality, has acknowledged this fact of
a range of psychic life lying below and beyond the conscious field.
Indeed, it has so dwelt upon and defined this shadowy region—which is
really less a “region” than a useful name—that it sometimes seems to
know more about the unconscious than about the conscious life of man.
There it finds, side by side, the sources of his most animal instincts,
his least explicable powers, his most spiritual intuitions: the “ape and
tiger,” and the “soul.” Genius and prophecy, insomnia and infatuation,
clairvoyance, hypnotism, hysteria, and “Christian” science—all are
explained by the “unconscious mind.” In his destructive moods the
psychologist has little apparent difficulty in reducing the chief
phenomena of religious and mystical experience to activities of the
“unconscious,” seeking an oblique satisfaction of repressed desires.
Where he undertakes the more dangerous duties of apologetic, he explains
the same phenomena by saying that “God speaks to man in the
subconsciousness,”  <span id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md) by which he can
only mean that our apprehensions of the eternal have the character of
intuition rather than of thought. Yet the “unconscious” after all is
merely a convenient name for the aggregate of those powers, parts, or
qualities of the whole self which at any given moment are not conscious,
or that the Ego is not conscious of. Included in the unconscious region
of an average healthy man are all those automatic activities by which
the life of the body is carried on: all those “uncivilized” instincts
and vices, those remains of the ancestral savage, which education has
<span id="page_53">p. 53</span> <span id="an_iii.iii-Page_53"></span>
forced out of the stream of consciousness and which now only send their
messages to the surface in a carefully disguised form. There too work in
the hiddenness those longings for which the busy life of the world
leaves no place; and there lies that deep pool, that heart of
personality, from which in moments of lucidity a message may reach the
conscious field. Hence in normal men the best and worst, most savage and
most spiritual parts of character, are bottled up “below the threshold.”
Often the partisans of the “unconscious” forget to mention this.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p41"></span>It follows, then, that whilst we may
find it convenient and indeed necessary to avail ourselves of the
symbols and diagrams of psychology in tracking out the mystic way, we
must not forget the large and vague significance which attaches to these
symbols, and the hypothetical character of many of the entities they
represent. Nor must we allow ourselves to use the “unconscious” as the
equivalent of man’s transcendental sense. Here the mystics have surely
displayed a more scientific spirit, a more delicate power of analysis,
than the psychologists. They, too, were aware that in normal men the
spiritual sense lies below the threshold of consciousness. Though they
had not at their command the spatial metaphors of the modern school, and
could not describe man’s ascent toward God in those picturesque terms of
levels and uprushes, margins and fields, projection, repression, and
sublimation, which now come so naturally to investigators of the
spiritual life, they leave us in no doubt as to their view of the facts.
Further, man’s spiritual history primarily meant for them, as it means
for us, the emergence of this transcendental sense; its capture of the
field of consciousness, and the opening up of those paths which permit
the inflow of a larger spiritual life, the perception of a higher
reality. This, in so far as it was an isolated act, was “contemplation.”
When it was part of the general life process, and had permanent results,
they called it the New Birth, which “maketh alive.” The faculty or
personality concerned in the “New Birth”—the “spiritual man,” capable of
the spiritual vision and life, which was dissociated from the “earthly
man” adapted only to the natural life—was always sharply distinguished
by them from the total personality, conscious or unconscious. It was
something definite; a bit or spot of man which, belonging not to Time
but to Eternity, was different in kind from the rest of his human
nature, framed in all respects to meet the demands of the merely natural
world.  <span id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) The business of the mystic
in the eyes of these old specialists was to remake, transmute, his total
personality in the interest <span id="page_54">p. 54</span> <span
id="an_iii.iii-Page_54"></span> of his spiritual self; to bring it out
of the hiddenness, and unify himself about it as a centre, thus “putting
on divine humanity.”

<span id="an_iii.iii-p43"></span>The divine nucleus, the point of
contact between man’s life and the divine life in which it is immersed
and sustained, has been given many names in course of the development of
mystical doctrine. All clearly mean the same thing, though emphasizing
different aspects of its life. Sometimes it is called the Synteresis,
 <span id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) the keeper or preserver of his
being: sometimes the Spark of the Soul, the <span
id="an_iii.iii-p44.1"></span> *Fünklein* of the German mystics:
sometimes its Apex the point at which it touches the heavens. Then, with
a sudden flight to the other end of the symbolic scale, and in order to
emphasize its participation in pure Being, rather than its difference
from mere nature, it is called the Ground of the Soul, the foundation or
basal stuff indwelt by God, whence springs all spiritual life. Clearly
all these guesses and suggestions aim at one goal and are all to be
understood in a symbolic sense; for, as Malaval observed in answer to
his disciples’ anxious inquiries on this subject, “since the soul of man
is a spiritual thing and thus cannot have divisions or parts,
consequently it cannot have height or depth, summit or surface. But
because we judge spiritual things by the help of material things, since
we know these better and they are more familiar to us, we call the
highest of all forms of conception the summit, and the easier way of
comprehending things the surface, of the understanding.”  <span
id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md)

<span id="an_iii.iii-p46"></span>Here at any rate, whatever name we may
choose to give it, is the organ of man’s spiritual consciousness; the
place where he meets the Absolute, the germ of his real life. Here is
the seat of that deep “Transcendental Feeling,” the “beginning and end
of metaphysics” which is, says Professor Stewart, “at once the solemn
sense of Timeless Being—of ‘That which was and is and ever shall be’
overshadowing us—and the conviction that Life is good.” “I hold,” says
the same writer, “that it is in Transcendental Feeling, manifested
normally as Faith in the Value of Life, and ecstatically as sense of
Timeless Being, and not in Thought proceeding by way of speculative
construction, that Consciousness comes nearest to the object of
metaphysics, Ultimate Reality.”  <span id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md)
<span id="page_55">p. 55</span> <span id="an_iii.iii-Page_55"></span>

<span id="an_iii.iii-p48"></span>The existence of such a “sense,” such
an integral part or function of the complete human being, has been
affirmed and dwelt upon not only by the mystics, but by seers and
teachers of all times and creeds: by Egypt, Greece, and India, the
poets, the fakirs, the philosophers, and the saints. A belief in its
actuality is the pivot of the Christian position; indeed of every
religion worthy of the name. It is the justification of mysticism,
asceticism, the whole machinery of the self-renouncing life. That there
is an extreme point at which man’s nature touches the Absolute: that his
ground, or substance, his true being, is penetrated by the Divine Life
which constitutes the underlying reality of things; this is the basis on
which the whole mystic claim of possible union with God must rest. Here,
they say, is our link with reality; and in this place alone can be
celebrated the “marriage from which the Lord comes.”  <span
id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md)

<span id="an_iii.iii-p50"></span>To use another of their diagrams, it is
thanks to the existence within him of this immortal spark from the
central fire, that man is implicitly a “child of the infinite.” The
mystic way must therefore be a life, a discipline, which will so alter
the constituents of his mental life as to include this spark within the
conscious field; bring it out of the hiddenness, from those deep levels
where it sustains and guides his normal existence, and make it the
dominant element round which his personality is arranged.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p51"></span>It is clear that under ordinary
conditions, and save for sudden gusts of “Transcendental Feeling”
induced by some saving madness such as Religion, Art, or Love, the
superficial self knows nothing of the attitude of this silent
watcher—this “Dweller in the Innermost”—towards the incoming messages of
the external world: nor of the activities which they awake in it.
Concentrated on the sense-world, and the messages she receives from it,
she knows nothing of the relations which exist between this subject and
the unattainable Object of all thought. But by a deliberate inattention
to the messages of the senses, such as that which is induced by
contemplation, the mystic can bring the ground of the soul, the seat of
“Transcendental Feeling,” within the area of consciousness: making it
amenable to the activity of the will. Thus becoming unaware of his usual
and largely fictitious “external world,” another and more substantial
set of perceptions, which never have their chance under normal
conditions, rise to the surface. Sometimes these unite with the normal
reasoning faculties. More often, they supersede them. Some such
exchange, such “losing to find,” appears to be necessary, if man’s
transcendental powers are to have their full chance.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p52"></span>“The two eyes of the soul of man,” says
the “Theologia <span id="page_56">p. 56</span> <span
id="an_iii.iii-Page_56"></span> Germanica,” here developing a profound
Platonic image, “cannot both perform their work at once: but if the soul
shall see with the right eye into eternity, then the left eye must close
itself and refrain from working, and be as though it were dead. For if
the left eye be fulfilling its office toward outward things, that is
holding converse with time and the creatures; then must the right eye be
hindered in its working; that is, in its contemplation. Therefore,
whosoever will have the one must let the other go; for ‘no man can serve
two masters.’“  <span id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md)

<span id="an_iii.iii-p54"></span>There is within us an immense capacity
for perception, for the receiving of messages from outside; and a very
little consciousness which deals with them. It is as if one telegraph
operator were placed in charge of a multitude of lines: all may be in
action, but he can only attend to one at a time. In popular language,
there is not enough consciousness to go round. Even upon the sensual
plane, no one can be aware of more than a few things at once. These fill
the centre of our field of consciousness: as the object on which we
happen to have focussed our vision dominates our field of sight. The
other matters within that field retreat to the margin. We know, dimly,
that they are there; but we pay them no attention and should hardly miss
them if they ceased to exist.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p55"></span>Transcendental matters are, for most of
us, always beyond the margin; because most of us have given up our whole
consciousness to the occupation of the senses, and permitted them to
construct there a universe in which we are contented to remain. Only in
certain states—recollection, contemplation, ecstasy and their allied
conditions—does the self contrive to turn out the usual tenants, shut
the “gateways of the flesh,” and let those submerged powers which are
capable of picking up messages from another plane of being have their
turn. Then it is the sense-world which retreats beyond the margin, and
another landscape that rushes in. At last, then, we begin to see
something of what contemplation does for its initiates. It is one of the
many names applied to that chain of processes which have for their
object this alteration of the mental equilibrium: the putting to sleep
of that “Normal Self” which usually wakes, and the awakening of that
“Transcendental Self” which usually sleeps. To man, “meeting-point of
various stages of reality,” is given—though he seldom considers it—this
unique power of choosing his universe.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p56"></span>The phenomenon known as double or
disintegrated personality may perhaps give us a hint as to the
mechanical nature of the change which contemplation effects. In this
psychic malady the total character of the patient is split up; a certain
group of qualities <span id="page_57">p. 57</span> <span
id="an_iii.iii-Page_57"></span> are, as it were, abstracted from the
surface-consciousness and so closely associated as to form in themselves
a complete “character” or “personality”—necessarily poles asunder from
the “character” which the self usually shows to the world, since it
consists exclusively of those elements which are omitted from it. Thus
in the classical case of Miss Beauchamp, the investigator, Dr. Morton
Prince, called the three chief “personalities,” from their ruling
characteristics, “the Saint,” “the Woman,” and “the Devil.”  <span
id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md) The totality of character which composed
the “real Miss Beauchamp” had split up into these contrasting types;
each of which was excessive, because withdrawn from the control of the
rest. When, voluntarily or involuntarily, the personality which had
possession of the field of consciousness was lulled to sleep, one of the
others emerged. Hypnotism was one of the means which most easily
effected this change.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p58"></span>Now in persons of mystical genius, the
qualities which the stress of normal life tends to keep below the
threshold of consciousness are of enormous strength. In these natural
explorers of Eternity the “transcendental faculty,” the “eye of the
soul,” is not merely present in embryo, but is highly developed; and is
combined with great emotional and volitional power. The result of the
segregation of such qualities below the threshold of consciousness is to
remove from them the friction of those counterbalancing traits in the
surface mind with which they might collide. They are “in the
hiddenness,” as Jacob Boehme would say. There they develop unchecked,
until a point is reached at which their strength is such that they break
their bounds and emerge into the conscious field: either temporarily
dominating the subject as in ecstasy, or permanently transmuting the old
self, as in the “unitive life.” The attainment of this point may be
accelerated by processes which have always been known and valued by the
mystics; and which tend to produce a state of consciousness classed by
psychologists with dreams, reverie, and the results of hypnosis. In all
these the normal surface-consciousness is deliberately or involuntarily
lulled, the images and ideas connected with normal life are excluded,
and images or faculties from “beyond the threshold” are able to take
their place.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p59"></span>Of course these images or faculties may
or may not be more valuable than those already present in the
surface-consciousness. In the ordinary subject, often enough, they are
but the odds and ends for which the superficial mind has found no use.
In the mystic, they are of a very different order: and this fact
justifies the means which he instinctively employs to secure their
emergence. Indian mysticism founds its external system almost wholly
<span id="page_58">p. 58</span> <span id="an_iii.iii-Page_58"></span> on
( *a* ) Asceticism, the domination of the senses, and ( *b* ) the
deliberate practice of self-hypnotization; either by fixing the eyes on
a near object, or by the rhythmic repetition of the *mantra* or sacred
word. By these complementary forms of discipline, the pull of the
phenomenal world is diminished and the mind is placed at the disposal of
the subconscious powers. Dancing, music, and other exaggerations of
natural rhythm have been pressed into the same service by the Greek
initiates of Dionysus, by the Gnostics, by innumerable other mystic
cults. That these proceedings do effect a remarkable change in the human
consciousness is proved by experience: though how and why they do it is
as yet little understood. Such artificial and deliberate production of
ecstasy is against the whole instinct of the Christian contemplatives;
but here and there amongst them also we find instances in which ecstatic
trance or lucidity, the liberation of the “transcendental sense,” was
inadvertently produced by purely physical means. Thus Jacob Boehme, the
“Teutonic theosopher,” having one day as he sat in his room “gazed
fixedly upon a burnished pewter dish which reflected the sunshine with
great brilliance,” fell into an inward ecstasy, and it seemed to him as
if he could look into the principles and deepest foundations of things.
 <span id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md) The contemplation of running water
had the same effect on St. Ignatius Loyola. Sitting on the bank of a
river one day, and facing the stream, which was running deep, “the eyes
of his mind were opened, not so as to see any kind of vision, but so as
to understand and comprehend spiritual things . . . and this with such
clearness that for him all these things were made new.”  <span
id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82.md) This method of attaining to mental
lucidity by a narrowing and simplification of the conscious field, finds
an apt parallel in the practice of Immanuel Kant, who “found that he
could better engage in philosophical thought while *gazing steadily* at
a neighbouring church steeple.”  <span id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83.md)

<span id="an_iii.iii-p63"></span>It need hardly be said that
rationalistic writers, ignoring the parallels offered by the artistic
and philosophic temperaments, have seized eagerly upon the evidence
afforded by such instances of apparent mono-ideism and
self-hypnotization in the lives of the mystics, and by the physical
disturbances which accompany the ecstatic trance, and sought by its
application to attribute all the abnormal perceptions of contemplative
genius to hysteria or other disease. They have not hesitated to call St.
Paul an epileptic. St. Teresa the “patron saint of hysterics”; and have
found room for most of their spiritual kindred in various departments of
the pathological museum. They have been helped in this grateful task by
the acknowledged fact that the great contemplatives, though <span
id="page_59">p. 59</span> <span id="an_iii.iii-Page_59"></span> almost
always persons of robust intelligence and marked practical or
intellectual ability—Plotinus, St. Bernard, the two Ss. Catherine, St.
Teresa, St. John of the Cross, and the Sufi poets Jàmi and Jalalu ‘ddin
are cases in point—have often suffered from bad physical health. More,
their mystical activities have generally reacted upon their bodies in a
definite and special way; producing in several cases a particular kind
of illness and of physical disability, accompanied by pains and
functional disturbances for which no organic cause could be discovered,
unless that cause were the immense strain which exalted spirit puts upon
a body which is adapted to a very different form of life.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p64"></span>It is certain that the abnormal and
highly sensitized type of mind which we call mystical does frequently,
but not always, produce or accompany strange and inexplicable
modifications of the physical organism with which it is linked. The
supernatural is not here in question, except in so far as we are
inclined to give that name to natural phenomena which we do not
understand. Such instances of psycho-physical parallelism as the
stigmatizations of the saints—and indeed of other suggestible subjects
hardly to be ranked as saints—will occur to anyone.  <span
id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84.md) I here offer to the reader another less
discussed and more extraordinary example of the modifying influence of
the spirit on the supposed “laws” of bodily life.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p66"></span>We know, as a historical fact,
unusually well attested by contemporary evidence and quite outside the
sphere of hagiographic romance, that both St. Catherine of Siena and her
namesake St. Catherine of Genoa—active women as well as ecstatics, the
first a philanthropist, reformer, and politician, the second an original
theologian and for many years the highly efficient matron of a large
hospital—lived, in the first case for years, in the second for
constantly repeated periods of many weeks, without other food than the
consecrated Host which they received at Holy Communion. They did this,
not by way of difficult obedience to a pious vow, but because they could
not live in any other way. Whilst fasting, they were well and active,
capable of dealing with the innumerable responsibilities which filled
their lives. But the attempt to eat even a few mouthfuls—and this
attempt was constantly repeated, for, like all true saints, they
detested eccentricity  <span id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85.md) —at once
made them ill and had to be abandoned as useless.  <span
id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86.md) <span id="page_60">p. 60</span> <span
id="an_iii.iii-Page_60"></span>

<span id="an_iii.iii-p69"></span>In spite of the researches of Murisier,
 <span id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87.md) Janet,  <span
id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88.md) Ribot,  <span
id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md) and other psychologists, and their
persevering attempts to find a pathological explanation which will fit
all mystic facts, this and other marked physical peculiarities which
accompany the mystical temperament belong as yet to the unsolved
problems of humanity. They need to be removed both from the sphere of
marvel and from that of disease—into which enthusiastic friends and foes
force them by turn—to the sphere of pure psychology; and there studied
dispassionately with the attention which we so willingly bestow on the
less interesting eccentricities of degeneracy and vice. Their existence
no more discredits the sanity of mysticism or the validity of its
results than the unstable nervous condition usually noticed in
artists—who share to some extent the mystic’s apprehension of the
Real—discredits art. “In such cases as Kant and Beethoven,” says Von
Hügel justly, “a classifier of humanity according to its psycho-physical
phenomena alone would put these great discoverers and creators, without
hesitation, amongst hopeless and useless hypochondriacs.”  <span
id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md)

<span id="an_iii.iii-p74"></span>In the case of the mystics the disease
of hysteria, with its astounding variety of mental symptoms, its strange
power of disintegrating, rearranging and enhancing the elements of
consciousness, its tendencies to automatism and ecstasy, has been most
often invoked to provide an explanation of the observed phenomena. This
is as if one sought the source of the genius of Taglioni in the symptoms
of St. Vitus’s dance. Both the art and the disease have to do with
bodily movements. So too both mysticism and hysteria have to do with the
domination of consciousness by one fixed and intense idea or intuition,
which rules the life and is able to produce amazing physical and
psychical results. In the hysteric patient this idea is often trivial or
morbid  <span id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md) but has become—thanks to
the self’s unstable mental condition—an obsession. In the mystic the
dominant idea is a great one: so great in fact, that when it is received
in its completeness by the human consciousness, almost of necessity it
ousts all else. It is nothing less than the idea or perception of the
transcendent reality and presence of God. Hence the mono-ideism of the
mystic is rational, whilst that of the hysteric patient is invariably
irrational.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p76"></span>On the whole then, whilst
psycho-physical relations remain so little understood, it would seem
more prudent, and certainly more scientific, to withhold our judgment on
the meaning of the psychophysical <span id="page_61">p. 61</span> <span
id="an_iii.iii-Page_61"></span> phenomena which accompany the mystic
life; instead of basing destructive criticism on facts which are
avowedly mysterious and at least capable of more than one
interpretation. To deduce the nature of a compound from the character of
its byproducts is notoriously unsafe.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p77"></span>Our bodies are animal things, made for
animal activities. When a spirit of unusual ardour insists on using its
nerve-cells for other activities, they kick against the pricks; and
inflict, as the mystics themselves acknowledge, the penalty of “mystical
ill-health.” “Believe me, children,” says Tauler, “one who would know
much about these high matters would often have to keep his bed, for his
bodily frame could not support it.”  <span
id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92.md) “I cause thee extreme pain of body,” says
the voice of Love to Mechthild of Magdeburg. “If I gave myself to thee
as often as thou wouldst have me, I should deprive myself of the sweet
shelter I have of thee in this world, for a thousand bodies could not
protect a loving soul from her desire. Therefore the higher the love the
greater the pain.”  <span id="fr_93"></span>[94](#fn_93.md)

<span id="an_iii.iii-p80"></span>On the other hand the exalted
personality of the mystic—his self-discipline, his heroic acceptance of
labour and suffering, and his inflexible will—raises to a higher term
that normal power of mind over body which all possess. Also the
contemplative state—like the hypnotic state in a healthy person—seems to
enhance life by throwing open deeper levels of personality. The self
then drinks at a fountain which is fed by the Universal Life. True
ecstasy is notoriously life-enhancing. In it a bracing contact with
Reality seems to take place, and as a result the subject is himself more
real. Often, says St. Teresa, even the sick come forth from ecstasy
healthy and with new strength; for something great is then given to the
soul.  <span id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94.md) Contact has been set up with
levels of being which the daily routine of existence leaves untouched.
Hence the extraordinary powers of endurance, and independence of
external conditions, which the great ecstatics so often display.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p82"></span>If we see in the mystics, as some have
done, the sporadic beginning of a power, a higher consciousness, towards
which the race slowly tends; then it seems likely enough that where it
appears nerves and organs should suffer under a stress to which they
have not yet become adapted, and that a spirit more highly organized
than its bodily home should be able to impose strange conditions on the
flesh. When man first stood upright, a body long accustomed to go on all
fours, legs which had adjusted themselves to bearing but half his
weight, must have rebelled against this <span id="page_62">p. 62</span>
<span id="an_iii.iii-Page_62"></span> unnatural proceeding; inflicting
upon its author much pain and discomfort if not absolute illness. It is
at least permissible to look upon the strange “psycho-physical” state
common amongst the mystics as just such a rebellion on the part of a
normal nervous and vascular system against the exigencies of a way of
life to which it has not yet adjusted itself.  <span
id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95.md)

<span id="an_iii.iii-p84"></span>In spite of such rebellion, and of the
tortures to which it has subjected them, the mystics, oddly enough, are
a long-lived race: an awkward fact for critics of the physiological
school. To take only a few instances from amongst marked ecstatics, St.
Hildegarde lived to be eighty-one, Mechthild of Magdeburg to
eighty-seven, Ruysbroeck to eighty-eight, Suso to seventy, St. Teresa to
sixty-seven, St. Catherine of Genoa and St. Peter of Alcantara to
sixty-three. It seems as though that enhanced life which is the reward
of mystical surrender enabled them to triumph over their bodily
disabilities: and to live and do the work demanded of them under
conditions which would have incapacitated ordinary men.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p85"></span>Such triumphs, which take heroic rank
in the history of the human mind, have been accomplished as a rule in
the same way. Like all intuitive persons, all possessors of genius, all
potential artists—with whom in fact they are closely related—the mystics
have, in psychological language, “thresholds of exceptional mobility.”
That is to say, a slight effort, a slight departure from normal
conditions, will permit their latent or “subliminal” powers to emerge
and occupy the mental field. A “mobile threshold” may make a man a
genius, a lunatic, or a saint. All depends upon the character of the
emerging powers. In the great mystic, these powers, these tracts of
personality lying below the level of normal consciousness, are of
unusual richness; and cannot be accounted for in terms of pathology. “If
it be true,” says Delacroix, “that the great mystics have not wholly
escaped those nervous blemishes which mark nearly all exceptional
organizations, there is in them a vital and creative power, a
constructive logic, an extended scale of realization—in a word, a
genius—which is, in truth, their essential quality. . . . The great
mystics, creators and inventors who have found a new form of life and
have justified it . . . join, upon the highest summits of the human
spirit, the great simplifiers of the world.”  <span
id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md)

<span id="an_iii.iii-p87"></span>The truth, then, so far as we know it
at present, seems to be <span id="page_63">p. 63</span> <span
id="an_iii.iii-Page_63"></span> that those powers which are in contact
with the Transcendental Order, and which constitute at the lowest
estimate half the self, are dormant in ordinary men; whose time and
interest are wholly occupied in responding to the stimuli of the world
of sense. With those latent powers sleeps the landscape which they alone
can apprehend. In mystics none of the self is always dormant. They have
roused the Dweller in the Innermost from its slumbers, and round it have
unified their life. Heart, Reason, Will are there in full action,
drawing their incentive not from the shadow-show of sense, but from the
deeps of true Being; where a lamp is lit, and a consciousness awake, of
which the sleepy crowd remains oblivious. He who says the mystic is but
half a man, states the exact opposite of the truth. Only the mystic can
be called a whole man, since in others half the powers of the self
always sleep. This wholeness of experience is much insisted on by the
mystics. Thus the Divine Voice says to St. Catherine of Siena, “I have
also shown thee the Bridge and the three general steps, placed there for
the three powers of the soul; and I have told thee how no one can attain
to the life of grace unless he has mounted all three steps, that is,
gathered together all the three powers of the soul in My Name.”  <span
id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md)

<span id="an_iii.iii-p89"></span>In those abnormal types of personality
to which we give the name of genius, we seem to detect a hint of the
relations which may exist between these deep levels of being and the
crust of consciousness. In the poet, the musician, the great
mathematician or inventor, powers lying below the threshold, and hardly
controllable by their owner’s conscious will, clearly take a major part
in the business of perception and conception. In all creative acts, the
larger share of the work is done subconsciously: its emergence is in a
sense automatic. This is equally true of mystics, artists, philosophers,
discoverers, and rulers of men. The great religion, invention, work of
art, always owes its inception to some sudden uprush of intuitions or
ideas for which the superficial self cannot account; its execution to
powers so far beyond the control of that self, that they seem, as their
owner sometimes says, to “come from beyond.” This is “inspiration”; the
opening of the sluices, so that those waters of truth in which all life
is bathed may rise to the level of consciousness.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p90"></span>The great teacher, poet, artist,
inventor, never aims deliberately at his effects. He obtains them he
knows not how: perhaps from a contact of which he is unconscious with
that creative plane of being which the Sufis call the Constructive
Spirit, and the Kabalists Yesod, and which both postulate as lying next
behind the world of sense. “Sometimes,” said the great Alexandrian Jew
Philo, <span id="page_64">p. 64</span> <span
id="an_iii.iii-Page_64"></span> “when I have come to my work empty, I
have suddenly become full; ideas being in an invisible manner showered
upon me, and implanted in me from on high; so that through the influence
of divine inspiration, I have become greatly excited, and have known
neither the place in which I was, nor those who were present, nor
myself, nor what I was saying, nor what I was writing; for then I have
been conscious of a richness of interpretation, an enjoyment of light, a
most penetrating insight, a most manifest energy in all that was to be
done; having such an effect on my mind as the clearest ocular
demonstration would have on the eyes.”  <span
id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md) This is a true creative ecstasy, strictly
parallel to the state in which the mystic performs his mighty works.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p92"></span>To let oneself go, be quiet, receptive,
appears to be the condition under which such contact with the Cosmic
Life may be obtained. “I have noticed that when one paints one should
think of nothing: everything then comes better,” says the young Raphael
to Leonardo da Vinci.  <span id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md) The
superficial self must here acknowledge its own insufficiency, must
become the humble servant of a more profound and vital consciousness.
The mystics are of the same opinion. “Let the will quietly and wisely
understand,” says St. Teresa, “that it is not by dint of labour on our
part that we can converse to any good purpose with God.”  <span
id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md) “The best and noblest way in which
thou mayst come into this Life,” says Eckhart, “is by keeping silence
and letting God work and speak. Where all the powers are withdrawn from
their work and images, there is this word spoken . . . the more thou
canst draw in all thy powers and forget the creature the nearer art thou
to this, and the more receptive.”  <span
id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101.md)

<span id="an_iii.iii-p96"></span>Thus Boehme says to the neophyte,
 <span id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md) “When both thy intellect and
will are quiet and passive to the expressions of the eternal Word and
Spirit, and when thy soul is winged up above that which is temporal, the
outward senses and the imagination being locked up by holy abstraction,
*then* the eternal Hearing, Seeing, and Speaking will be revealed in
thee. Blessed art thou therefore if thou canst stand still from self
thinking and self willing, and canst stop the wheel of thy imagination
and senses.” Then, the conscious mind being passive, the more divine
mind below the threshold—organ of our free creative life—can emerge and
present its reports. In the words of an older mystic, “The soul, leaving
all things and forgetting herself, is immersed in the ocean <span
id="page_65">p. 65</span> <span id="an_iii.iii-Page_65"></span> of
Divine Splendour, and illuminated by the Sublime Abyss of the
Unfathomable Wisdom.”  <span id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md)

<span id="an_iii.iii-p99"></span>The “passivity” of contemplation, then,
is a necessary preliminary of spiritual energy: an essential clearing of
the ground. It withdraws the tide of consciousness from the shores of
sense, stops the “wheel of the imagination.” “The Soul,” says Eckhart
again, “is created in a place between Time and Eternity: with its
highest powers it touches Eternity, with its lower Time.”  <span
id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104.md) These, the worlds of Being and
Becoming, are the two “stages of reality” which meet in the spirit of
man. By cutting us off from the temporal plane, the lower kind of
reality, Contemplation gives the eternal plane, and the powers which can
communicate with that plane, their chance. In the born mystic these
powers are great, and lie very near the normal threshold of
consciousness. He has a genius for transcendental—or as he would say,
divine—discovery in much the same way as his cousins, the born musician
and poet, have a genius for musical or poetic discovery. In all three
cases, the emergence of these higher powers is mysterious, and not least
so to those who experience it. Psychology on the one hand, theology on
the other, may offer us diagrams and theories of this proceeding: of the
strange oscillations of the developing consciousness, the fitful
visitations of a lucidity and creative power over which the self has
little or no control, the raptures and griefs of a vision by turns
granted and withdrawn. But the secret of genius still eludes us, as the
secret of life eludes the biologist.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p101"></span>The utmost we can say of such persons
is, that reality presents itself to them under abnormal conditions and
in abnormal terms, and that subject to these conditions and in these
terms they are bound to deal with it. Thanks to their peculiar mental
make up, one aspect of the universe is for them focussed so sharply that
in comparison with it all other images are blurred, vague, and unreal.
Hence the sacrifice which men of genius—mystics, artists, inventors—make
of their whole lives to this one Object, this one vision of truth, is
not self-denial, but rather self-fulfilment. They gather themselves up
from the unreal, in order to concentrate on the real. The whole
personality then absorbs or enters into communion with certain rhythms
or harmonies existent in the universe, which the receiving apparatus of
other selves cannot take up. “Here is the finger of God, a flash of the
Will that can!” exclaims Abt Vogler, as the sounds grow under his hand.
“The numbers <span id="page_66">p. 66</span> <span
id="an_iii.iii-Page_66"></span> *came!“* says the poet. He knows not
how, certainly not by deliberate intellection.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p102"></span>So it is with the mystic. Madame Guyon
states in her autobiography, that when she was composing her works she
would experience a sudden and irresistible inclination to take up her
pen; though feeling wholly incapable of literary composition, and not
even knowing the subject on which she would be impelled to write. If she
resisted this impulse it was at the cost of the most intense discomfort.
She would then begin to write with extraordinary swiftness; words,
elaborate arguments, and appropriate quotations coming to her without
reflection, and so quickly that one of her longest books was written in
one and a half days. “In writing I saw that I was writing of things
which I had never seen: and during the time of this manifestation, I was
given light to perceive that I had in me treasures of knowledge and
understanding which I did not know that I possessed.”  <span
id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md)

<span id="an_iii.iii-p104"></span>Similar statements are made of St.
Teresa, who declared that in writing her books she was powerless to set
down anything but that which her Master put into her mind.  <span
id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md) So Blake said of “Milton” and
“Jerusalem,” “I have written the poems from immediate dictation, twelve
or sometimes twenty or thirty lines at a time, without premeditation and
even against my will. The time it has taken in writing was thus rendered
non-existent, and an immense poem exists which seems to be the labour of
a long life, all produced without labour or study.”  <span
id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md)

<span id="an_iii.iii-p107"></span>These are, of course, extreme forms of
that strange power of automatic composition, in which words and
characters arrive and arrange themselves in defiance of their authors’
will, of which most poets and novelists possess a trace. Such
composition is probably related to the automatic writing of “mediums”
and other sensitives; in which the often disorderly and incoherent
subliminal mind seizes upon this channel of expression. The subliminal
mind of the great mystic, however, is not disorderly. It is abnormally
sensitive, richly endowed and keenly observant—a treasure house, not a
lumber room—and becomes in the course of its education, a highly
disciplined and skilled instrument of knowledge. When, therefore, its
contents emerge, and are presented to the normal consciousness in the
form of lucidity, “auditions,” visions, automatic writing, or any other
translations of the supersensible <span id="page_67">p. 67</span> <span
id="an_iii.iii-Page_67"></span> into the terms of sensible perception,
they cannot be discredited because the worthless unconscious region of
feebler natures sometimes manifests itself in the same way. Idiots are
often voluble: but many orators are sane.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p108"></span>Now, to sum up: what are the chief
characteristics which we have found to concern us in this sketch-map of
the mental life of man?

<span id="an_iii.iii-p109"></span>(1) We have divided that life,
arbitrarily enough, along the fluctuating line which psychologists call
the “threshold of his consciousness” into the surface life and the
unconscious deeps.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p110"></span>(2) In the surface life, though we
recognized its essential wholeness, we distinguished three outstanding
and ever-present aspects: the Trinity in Unity of feeling, thought, and
will. Amongst these we were obliged to give the primacy to feeling, as
the power which set the machinery of thought and will to work.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p111"></span>(3) We have seen that the expression
of this life takes the two complementary forms of *conation,* or
outgoing action and *cognition,* or indwelling knowledge; and that the
first, which is dynamic in type, is largely the work of the will
stimulated by the emotions; whilst the second, which is passive in type,
is the business of the intellect. They answer to the two main aspects
which man discerns in the universal life: Being and Becoming.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p112"></span>(4) Neither conation nor
cognition—action nor thought—as performed by this surface mind,
concerned as it is with natural existence and dominated by spatial
conceptions, is able to set up any relations with the Absolute or
transcendental world. Such action and thought deal wholly with material
supplied directly or indirectly by the world of sense. The testimony of
the mystics, however, and of all persons possessing an “instinct for the
Absolute,” points to the existence of a further faculty—indeed, a deeper
self—in man; a self which the circumstances of diurnal life usually keep
“below the threshold” of his consciousness, and which thus becomes one
of the factors of his “subliminal life.” This hidden self is the primary
agent of mysticism, and lives a “substantial” life in touch with the
real or transcendental world.  <span id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md)

<span id="an_iii.iii-p114"></span>(5) Certain processes, of which
contemplation has been taken as a type, can so alter the state of
consciousness as to permit the emergence of this deeper self; which,
according as it enters more or less into the conscious life, makes man
more or less a mystic. <span id="page_68">p. 68</span> <span
id="an_iii.iii-Page_68"></span>

<span id="an_iii.iii-p115"></span>The mystic life, therefore, involves
the emergence from deep levels of man’s transcendental self; its capture
of the field of consciousness; and the “conversion” or rearrangement of
his feeling, thought, and will—his character—about this new centre of
life.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p116"></span>We state, then, as the conclusion of
this chapter, that the object of the mystic’s adventure, seen from
within, is the apprehension of, or direct communion with, that
transcendental Reality which we tried in the last section to define from
without. Here, as in the fulfilment of the highest earthly love,
knowledge and communion are the same thing; we must be “oned with bliss”
if we are to be aware of it. That aspect of our being by which we may
attain this communion—that “marrow of the Soul,” as Ruysbroeck calls
it—usually lies below the threshold of our consciousness; but in certain
natures of abnormal richness and vitality, and under certain favourable
conditions, it may be liberated by various devices, such as
contemplation. Once it has emerged, however, it takes up, to help it in
the work, aspects of the conscious self. The surface must co-operate
with the deeps, and at last merge with those deeps to produce that
unification of consciousness upon high levels which alone can put a term
to man’s unrest. The heart that longs for the All, the mind that
conceives it, the will that concentrates the whole self upon it, must
all be called into play. The self must be surrendered: but it must not
be annihilated, as some Quietists have supposed. It only dies that it
may live again. Supreme success,—the permanent assurance of the mystic
that “we are more verily in heaven than in earth,”—says the Lady Julian,
in a passage which anticipates the classification of modern psychology,
“cometh of the natural Love of our soul, and of the clear light of our
Reason, and of the steadfast Mind.”  <span
id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md)

<span id="an_iii.iii-p118"></span>But what is the order of precedence
which these three activities are to assume in the work which is *one*
?All, as we have seen, must do their part; for we are concerned with the
response of man in his wholeness to the overwhelming attraction of God.
But which shall predominate? The ultimate nature of the self’s
experience of reality will depend on the answer she gives to this
question. What, here, are the relative values of Mind and Heart? Which
will bring her closest to the Thought of God; the real life in which she
is bathed? Which, fostered and made dominant, is most likely to put her
in harmony with the Absolute? The Love of God, which is ever in the
heart and often on the lips of the Saints, is the passionate desire for
this harmony; the “malady of thought” is its intellectual equivalent.
Though we may seem to escape God, we cannot escape some form of this
craving; except at the price of utter stagnation. <span id="page_69">p.
69</span> <span id="an_iii.iii-Page_69"></span> We go back, therefore,
to the statement with which this chapter opened: that of the two
governing desires which share the prison of the self. We see them now as
representing the cravings of the intellect and the emotions for the only
end of all quests. The disciplined will—the “conative power”—with all
the dormant faculties which it can wake and utilize, can come to the
assistance of one of them. Which? The question is a crucial one, for the
destiny of the self depends on the partner which the will selects.

<span id="an_iii.iii-p7"></span> The wise Cherubs, according to the
beautiful imagery of Dionysius, are “all eyes,” but the loving Seraphs
are “all wings.” Whilst the Seraphs, the figure of intensest Love, “
*move* perpetually towards things divine,” ardour and energy being their
characteristics, the characteristic of the Cherubs is receptiveness
their power of absorbing the rays of the Supernal Light. (Dionysius the
Areopagite, “De Caelesti Ierarchia,” vi. 2, and vii. 1.)

<span id="an_iii.iii-p42"></span> *Note to the 12th Edition.* During the
eighteen years which have elapsed since this chapter was written, much
work has been done on the psychology of mysticism. After suffering
severely at the hands of the “new psychologists” the contemplative
faculty is once more taken seriously; and there is even some disposition
to accept or restate the account of it given by the mystics. Thus
Bremond (“Prière et Poésie” and “Introduction à la Philosophie de la
Prière”) insists on the capital distinction between the surface-mind,
capable of rational knowledge, and the deeper mind, organ of mystical
knowledge, and operative in varying degrees in religion poetic, and
Esthetic apprehensions.

applicable to the drastic rearrangement of personality which takes place
in the case of the mystic, whose spiritual life is more intense than

Bremond, “the fundamental dogma of mystical psychology—the distinction
between the two selves: *Animus,* the surface self; *Anima* , the deep
self; *Animus* , rational knowledge; and *Anima* , mystical or poetic
knowledge . . . the I, who feeds on notions and words, and enchants
himself by doing so; the Me, who is united to realities” (Bremond
