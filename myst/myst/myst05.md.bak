### II. Mysticism and Vitalism

<span id="an_iii.ii"></span>

<span id="an_iii.ii-p1"></span>We<span id="an_iii.ii-p1.1"></span>
glanced, at the beginning of this inquiry, at the universes which result
from the various forms of credulity practised by the materialist, the
idealist, and the sceptic. We saw the mystic denying by word and act the
validity of the foundations on which those universes are built:
substituting his living experience for their conceptual schemes. But
there is another way of seeing reality or, more correctly, one aspect of
reality. This scheme of things possesses the merit of accepting and
harmonizing many different forms of experience; even those supreme
experiences and intuitions peculiar to the mystics. The first distinct
contribution of the twentieth century to man’s quest of the Real, it
entered the philosophic arena from several different directions;
penetrating and modifying current conceptions not only of philosophy but
of religion, science, art and practical life. It was applied by Driesch
 <span id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) and other biologists in the sphere
of organic life. Bergson,  <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md) starting
from psychology, developed its intellectual and metaphysical
implications; whilst Rudolph Eucken  <span
id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) constructed from, or beside it, a
philosophy of the Spirit, of man’s relations to the Real. <span
id="page_27">p. 27</span> <span id="an_iii.ii-Page_27"></span>

<span id="an_iii.ii-p5"></span>In all these we find the same principle;
the principle of a free spontaneous and creative life as the essence of
Reality. Not law but aliveness, incalculable and indomitable, is their
subject-matter: not human logic, but actual living experience is their
criterion of truth. Vitalists, whether the sphere of their explorations
be biology, psychology or ethics, see the whole Cosmos, the physical and
spiritual worlds, as instinct with initiative and spontaneity: as above
all things free. For them, nature, though conditioned by the matter with
which she works, is stronger than her chains. Pushing out from within,
ever seeking expression, she buds and breaks forth into original
creation.  <span id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md) The iron “laws” of the
determinists are merely her observed habits, not her fetters: and man,
seeing nature in the terms of “cause and effect,” has been the dupe of
his own limitations and prejudices.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p7"></span>Bergson, Nietzsche, Eucken, differing in
their opinion as to life’s meaning, are alike in this vision: in the
stress which they lay on the supreme importance and value of life—a
great Cosmic life transcending and including our own. This is
materialism inside out: for here what we call the universe is presented
as an expression of life, not life as an expression or by-product of the
universe. The strange passionate philosophy of Nietzsche is really built
upon an intense belief in this supernal nature and value of Life, Action
and Strength: and spoilt by the one-sided individualism which prevented
him from holding a just balance between the great and significant life
of the Ego and the greater and more significant life of the All.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p8"></span>Obviously, the merit of vitalistic
philosophy lies in its ability to satisfy so many different thinkers,
starting from such diverse points in our common experience. On the
phenomenal side it can accept and transfigure the statements of physical
science. In its metaphysical aspect it leaves place for those
ontological speculations which seem to take their rise in psychology. It
is friendly to those who demand an important place for moral and
spiritual activity in the universe. Finally—though here we must be
content with deduction rather than declaration—it leaves in the hands of
the mystics that power of attaining to Absolute Reality which they have
always claimed: shows them as the true possessors of freedom, the
torch-bearers of the race.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p9"></span>Did it acknowledge its ancestors with
that reverence which is their due, Vitalism would identify itself with
the mystic philosopher, <span id="page_28">p. 28</span> <span
id="an_iii.ii-Page_28"></span> Heracleitus; who, in the fifth century
B.C., introduced its central idea to the European world  <span
id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) : for his “Logos” or Energizing Fire is
but another symbol for that free and living Spirit of Becoming, that
indwelling creative power, which Vitalism acknowledges as the very soul
or immanent reality of things. It is in essence both a Hellenic and a
Christian system of thought. In its view of the proper function of the
intellect it has some unexpected affinities with Aristotle, and after
him with St. Thomas Aquinas; regarding it as a departmental affair, not
the organ of ultimate knowledge. Its theory of knowledge is close to
that of the mystics: or would be, if those gazers on reality had
interested themselves in any psychological theory of their own
experiences.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p11"></span>A philosophy which can harmonize such
diverse elements as these, and make its influence felt in so many fields
of thought, may be useful in our present attempt towards an
understanding of mysticism: for it illustrates certain aspects of
perceived reality which other systems ignore. It has the further
recommendation of involving not a mere diagram of metaphysical
possibilities, but a genuine theory of knowledge. Its scope includes
psychology as well as philosophy: the consideration, not only of the
nature of Reality but also of the self’s power of knowing it—the
machinery of contact between the mind and the flux of things. Thus it
has an inclusive quality lacking in the tidy ring-fenced systems of
other schools of thought. It has no edges, and if it be true to itself
should have no negations. It is a vision, not a map.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p12"></span>The primary difference between Vitalism
and the classic philosophic schools is this. Its focal point is not
Being but Becoming.  <span id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md) Translated
into Platonic language, not the changeless One, the Absolute,
transcending all succession, but rather His energizing Thought—the Son,
the Creative Logos—is the supreme reality which it proposes as
accessible to human consciousness.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p14"></span>“All things,” said Heracleitus, “are in
a state of flux.” “Everything happens through strife.” “Reality is a
condition of unrest.”  <span id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md) Such is also
the opinion of Bergson and Alexander; who, agreeing in this with the
conclusions of physical science, look upon the Real as dynamic rather
than static, as *becoming* rather than *being* <span id="page_29">p.
29</span> <span id="an_iii.ii-Page_29"></span> perfect, and invite us to
see in Time—the precession or flux of things—the very stuff of reality—

> <span id="an_iii.ii-p15.1"></span> “From the fixed lull of Heaven she
> saw  
> Time like a pulse shake fierce  
> Through all the worlds”—  <span id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md)  

<span id="an_iii.ii-p17"></span>said Rossetti of the Blessed Damozel. So
Bergson, while ignoring if he does not deny the existence of the “fixed
lull,” the still Eternity, the point of rest, finds everywhere the pulse
of Time, the vast unending storm of life and love. Reality, says
Bergson, is pure creative Life; a definition which excludes those ideas
of perfection and finality involved in the idealist’s concept of Pure
Being as the Absolute and Unchanging One.  <span
id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md) This life, as he sees it, is fed from
within rather than upheld from without. It evolves by means of its own
inherent and spontaneous creative power. The biologist’s Nature “so
careful of the type”; the theologian’s Creator transcending His
universe, and “holding all things in the hollow of His hand”: these are
gone, and in their place we have a universe teeming with free
individuals, each self-creative, each evolving eternally, yet towards no
term.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p19"></span>Here, then, the deep instinct of the
human mind that there must be a unity, an orderly plan in the universe,
that the strung-along beads of experience do really form a rosary,
though it be one which we cannot repeat, is deliberately thwarted.
Creation, Activity, Movement; this, says Vitalism, rather than any
merely apparent law and order, any wholeness, is the essential quality
of the Realms the Real: and life is an eternal Becoming, a ceaseless
changefulness. At its highest it may be conceived as “the universe
flowering into deity,”  <span id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) As the
Hermetic philosophers found in the principle of analogy, <span
id="an_iii.ii-p20.1"></span> *“Quod inferius sicut quod superius,”*
 <span id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) the Key of Creation, so we are
invited to see in that uninterrupted change which is the condition of
our normal consciousness, a true image, a microcosm of the living
universe as a part of which that consciousness has been evolved.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p22"></span>If we accept this theory, we must then
impute to life in its fullness—the huge, many levelled, many coloured
life, the innumerable worlds which escape the rhythm of our senses; not
merely that patch of physical life which those senses perceive—a
divinity, a greatness of destiny far beyond that with which it is
credited by those who hold to a physico-chemical theory of the <span
id="page_30">p. 30</span> <span id="an_iii.ii-Page_30"></span> universe.
We must perceive in it, as some mystics have done, “the beating of the
Heart of God”; and agree with Heracleitus that “there is but one wisdom,
to understand the knowledge by which all things are steered through the
All.”  <span id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md) Union with
reality—apprehension of it—will upon this hypothesis be union with life
at its most intense point: in its most dynamic aspect. It will be a
deliberate harmony set up with the Logos which that same philosopher
described as “man’s most constant companion.” *Ergo,* says the mystic,
union with a Personal and Conscious spiritual existence, immanent in the
world—one form, one half of the union which I have always sought, since
this is clearly life in its highest manifestation. Beauty, Goodness,
Splendour, Love, all those shining words which exhilarate the soul, are
but the names of aspects or qualities picked out by human intuition as
characteristic of this intense and eternal Life in which is the life of
men.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p24"></span>How, then, may we knew this Life, this
creative and original soul of things, in which we are bathed; in which,
as in a river, swept along? Not, says Bergson bluntly, by any
intellectual means. The mind which thinks it knows Reality because it
has made a diagram of Reality, is merely the dupe of its own categories.
The intellect is a specialized aspect of the self, a form of
consciousness: but specialized for very different purposes than those of
metaphysical speculation. Life has evolved it in the interests of life;
has made it capable of dealing with “solids,” with concrete things. With
these it is at home. Outside of them it becomes dazed, uncertain of
itself; for it is no longer doing its natural work, which is to *help*
life, not to *know* it. In the interests of experience, and in order to
grasp perceptions, the intellect breaks up experience, which is in
reality a continuous stream, an incessant process of change and response
with no separate parts, into purely conventional “moments,” “periods,”
or psychic “states.” It picks out from the flow of reality those bits
which are significant for human life; which “interest” it, catch its
attention. From these it makes up a mechanical world in which it dwells,
and which seems quite real until it is subjected to criticism. It does,
says Bergson, the work of a cinematograph: takes snapshots of something
which is always moving, and by means of these successive static
representations—none of which are real, because Life, the object
photographed, never was at rest—it recreates a picture of life, of
motion. This rather jerky representation of divine harmony, from which
innumerable moments are left out, is useful for practical purposes: but
it is not reality, because it is not alive.  <span
id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) <span id="page_31">p. 31</span> <span
id="an_iii.ii-Page_31"></span>

<span id="an_iii.ii-p26"></span>This “real world,” then, is the result
of your selective activity, and the nature of your selection is largely
outside your control. Your cinematograph machine goes at a certain pace,
takes its snapshots at certain intervals. Anything which goes too
quickly for these intervals, it either fails to catch, or merges with
preceding and succeeding movements to form a picture with which it can
deal. Thus we treat, for instance, the storm of vibrations which we
convert into “sound” and “light.” Slacken or accelerate its clock-time,
change its rhythmic activity, and at once you take a different series of
snapshots, and have as a result a different picture of the world. Thanks
to the time at which the normal human machine is set, it registers for
us what we call, in our simple way, “the natural world.” A slight
accession of humility or common sense might teach us that a better title
would be “ *our* natural world.”

<span id="an_iii.ii-p27"></span>Let human consciousness change or
transcend its rhythm, and any other aspect of any other world may be
ours as a result. Hence the mystics’ claim that in their ecstasies they
change the conditions of consciousness, and apprehend a deeper reality
which is unrelated to human speech, cannot be dismissed as unreasonable.
Do not then confuse that surface-consciousness which man has trained to
be an organ of utility and nothing more—and which therefore can only
deal adequately with the “given” world of sense—with that mysterious
something in you, that ground of personality, inarticulate but
inextinguishable, by which you are aware that a greater truth exists.
This truth, whose neighbourhood you feel, and for which you long, is
Life. You are in it all the while, “like a fish in the sea, like a bird
in the air,” as St. Mechthild of Hackborn said many centuries ago.
 <span id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md)

<span id="an_iii.ii-p29"></span>Give yourself, then, to this divine and
infinite life, this mysterious Cosmic activity in which you are
immersed, of which you are born. Trust it. Let it surge in on you. Cast
off, as the mystics are always begging you to do, the fetters of the
senses, the “remora of desire”; and making your interests identical with
those of the All, rise to freedom, to that spontaneous, creative life
which, inherent in every individual self, is our share of the life of
the Universe. You are yourself *vital* —a free centre of energy—did you
but know it. You can move to higher levels, to greater reality, truer
self-fulfilment, if you will. Though you be, as Plato said, like an
oyster in your shell, you can open that shell to the living waters
without, draw from the “Immortal Vitality.” Thus only—by contact with
the real—shall you *know* reality. <span id="an_iii.ii-p29.1"></span>
*Cot ad cot loquitur.*

<span id="an_iii.ii-p30"></span>The Indian mystics declare substantially
the same truth when they say that the illusion of finitude is only to be
escaped by <span id="page_32">p. 32</span> <span
id="an_iii.ii-Page_32"></span> relapsing into the substantial and
universal life, abolishing individuality. So too, by a deliberate
self-abandonment to that which Plato calls the “saving madness” of
ecstasy, did the initiates of Dionysus “draw near to God.” So their
Christian cousins assert that “self-surrender” is the only way: that
they must die to live, must lose to find: that knowing implies being:
that the method and secret which they have always practiced consists
merely in a meek and loving union—the synthesis of passion and
self-sacrifice—with that divine and unseparated life, that larger
consciousness in which the soul is grounded, and which they hold to be
an aspect of the life of God. In their hours of contemplation, they
deliberately empty themselves of the false images of the intellect,
neglect the cinematograph of sense. Then only are they capable of
transcending the merely intellectual levels of consciousness, and
perceiving that Reality which “hath no image.”

<span id="an_iii.ii-p31"></span>“Pilgrimage to the place of the wise,”
said Jalalu ‘ddin, “is to find escape from the flame of separation.” It
is the mystics’ secret in a nutshell. “When I stand empty *in* God’s
will and empty *of* God’s will and of all His works and of God Himself,”
cries Eckhart with his usual violence of language, *“then* am I above
all creatures and am neither God nor creature, but I am what I was and
evermore shall be.”  <span id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) He attains,
that is to say, by this escape from a narrow selfhood, not to identity
with God—that were only conceivable upon a basis of pantheism—but to an
identity with his own substantial life, and through it with the life of
a real and living universe; in symbolic language, with “the thought of
the Divine Mind” whereby union with that Mind in the essence or ground
of the soul becomes possible. The first great message of Vitalistic
philosophy is then seen to be—Cease to identify your intellect and your
self: a primary lesson which none who purpose the study of mysticism may
neglect. Become at least aware of, if you cannot “know,” the larger,
truer self: that root and depth of spirit, as St. François de Sales
calls it, from which intellect and feeling grow as fingers from the palm
of the hand—that free creative self which constitutes your true life, as
distinguished from the scrap of consciousness which is its servant.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p33"></span>How then, asks the small
consciously-seeking personality of the normal man, am I to become aware
of this, my larger self, and of the free, eternal, spiritual life which
it lives?

<span id="an_iii.ii-p34"></span>Here philosophy, emerging from the
water-tight compartment in which metaphysics have lived too long
retired, calls in psychology; and tells us that in intuition, in a bold
reliance on contact between the totality of the self and the external
world—perhaps too in those strange states of lucidity which accompany
<span id="page_33">p. 33</span> <span id="an_iii.ii-Page_33"></span>
great emotion and defy analysis—lies the normal man’s best chance of
attaining, as it were, a swift and sidelong knowledge of this real.
Smothered in daily life by the fretful activities of our surface-mind,
reality emerges in our great moments; and, seeing ourselves in its
radiance, we know, for good or evil, what we are. “We are not pure
intellects . . . around our conceptional and logical thought there
remains a vague, nebulous Somewhat, the substance at whose expense the
luminous nucleus we call the intellect is formed.”  <span
id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) In this aura, this diffused
sensitiveness, we are asked to find man’s medium of communication with
the Universal Life.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p36"></span>Such fragmentary, dim and unverifiable
perceptions of the Real, however, such “excursions into the Absolute,”
cannot be looked upon as a satisfaction of man’s hunger for Truth. He
does not want to peep, but to live. Hence he cannot be satisfied with
anything less than a total and permanent adjustment of his being to the
greater life of reality. This alone can resolve the disharmonies between
the self and the world, and give meaning and value to human life.  <span
id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) The possibility of this adjustment—of
union between man’s life and that “independent spiritual life” which is
the stuff of reality—is the theme alike of mysticism and of Eucken’s
spiritual vitalism or Activistic Philosophy.  <span
id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md) Reality, says Eucken, is an independent
spiritual world, unconditioned by the apparent world of sense. To know
it and to live in it is man’s true destiny. His point of contact with it
is personality: the inward fount of his being: his heart, not his head.
Man is real, and in the deepest sense alive, in virtue of this free
personal life-principle within him; but he is bound and blinded by the
ties set up between his surface-intelligence and the sense-world. The
struggle for reality must be a struggle on man’s part to transcend the
sense-world, escape its bondage. He must renounce it, and be “re-born”
to a higher level of consciousness; shifting his centre of interest from
the natural to the spiritual plane. According to the thoroughness with
which he does this, will be the amount of real life he enjoys. The
initial break with the “world,” the refusal to spend one’s life
communing with one’s own cinematograph picture, is essential <span
id="page_34">p. 34</span> <span id="an_iii.ii-Page_34"></span> if the
freedom of the infinite is to be attained. We are amphibious creatures:
our life moves upon two levels at once—the natural and the spiritual.
The key to the puzzle of man lies in the fact that he is “the meeting
point of various stages of Reality.”  <span
id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39.md) All his difficulties and triumphs are
grounded in this. The whole question for him is, which world shall be
central for him—the real, vital, all-embracing life we call spirit, or
the lower life of sense? Shall “Existence,” the superficial obvious
thing, or “Substance,” the underlying verity, be his home? Shall he
remain the slave of the senses with their habits and customs, or rise to
a plane of consciousness, of heroic endeavour, in which—participating in
the life of spirit—he knows reality because he is real?

<span id="an_iii.ii-p40"></span>The mystics, one and all, have answered
this question in the same sense, and proved in their own experience that
the premises of “Activism” are true. This application of the vitalistic
idea to the transcendental world, does in fact fit the observed facts of
mysticism far more closely even than it fits the observed facts of man’s
ordinary mental life.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p41"></span>(1) The primary break with the
sense-world. (2) The “new” birth and development of the spiritual
consciousness on high levels—in Eucken’s eyes an essential factor in the
attainment of reality. (3) That ever closer and deeper dependence on and
appropriation of the fullness of the Divine Life; a conscious
participation, and active union with the infinite and eternal. These
three imperatives, as we shall see later, form an exact description of
the psychological process through which the mystics pass. If then this
transcendence is the highest destiny of the race, mysticism becomes the
crown of man’s ascent towards Reality; the orderly completion of the
universal plan.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p42"></span>The mystics show us this independent
spiritual life, this fruition of the Absolute, enjoyed with a fullness
to which others cannot attain. They are the heroic examples of the life
of spirit; as the great artists, the great discoverers, are the heroic
examples of the life of beauty and the life of truth. Directly
participating, like all artists, in the Divine Life, they are usually
persons of great vitality: but this vitality expresses itself in unusual
forms, hard of understanding for ordinary men. When we see a picture or
a poem, hear a musical composition, we accept it as an expression of
life, an earnest of the power which brought it forth. But the deep
contemplations of the great mystic, his visionary reconstructions of
reality, and the fragments of them which he is able to report, do not
seem to us—as they are—the equivalents, or more often the superiors of
the artistic and scientific achievements of other great men. <span
id="page_35">p. 35</span> <span id="an_iii.ii-Page_35"></span>

<span id="an_iii.ii-p43"></span>Mysticism, then, offers us the history,
as old as civilization, of a race of adventurers who have carried to its
term the process of a deliberate and active return to the divine fount
of things. They have surrendered themselves to the life-movement of the
universe, hence have lived with an intenser life than other men can ever
know; have transcended the “sense-world” in order to live on high levels
the spiritual life. Therefore they witness to all that our latent
spiritual consciousness, which shows itself in the “hunger for the
Absolute,” can be made to mean to us if we develop it; and have in this
respect a unique importance for the race. It is the mystics, too, who
have perfected that method of intuition, that knowledge by union, the
existence of which philosophy has been driven to acknowledge. But where
the metaphysician obtains at best a sidelong glance at that Being
“unchanging yet elusive,” whom he has so often defined but never
discovered, the artist a brief and dazzling vision of the Beauty which
is Truth, they gaze with confidence into the very eyes of the Beloved.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p44"></span>The mystics, again, are, by their very
constitution, acutely conscious of the free and active “World of
Becoming,” the Divine Immanence and its travail. It is in them and they
are in it: or, as they put it in their blunt theological way, “the
Spirit of God is within you.” But they are not satisfied with this
statement and this knowledge; and here it is that they part company with
vitalism. It is, they think, but half a truth. To know Reality in this
way, to know it in its dynamic aspect, enter into “the great life of the
All”: this is indeed, in the last resort, to know it supremely from the
point of view of man—to liberate from selfhood the human
consciousness—but it is not to know it from the point of view of God.
There are planes of being beyond this; countries dark to the intellect,
deeps into which only the very greatest contemplatives have looked.
These, coming forth, have declared with Ruysbroeck that “God according
to the Persons is Eternal Work, but according to the Essence and Its
perpetual stillness He is Eternal Rest.”  <span
id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md)

<span id="an_iii.ii-p46"></span>The full spiritual consciousness of the
true mystic is developed not in one, but in two apparently opposite but
really complementary directions:—

> <span id="an_iii.ii-p46.1"></span> “. . . io vidi  
> Ambo le corte del ciel manifeste.”  <span
> id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md)  

<span id="an_iii.ii-p48"></span>On the one hand he is intensely aware
of, and knows himself to be at one with that active World of Becoming,
that immanent Life, from which his own life takes its rise. Hence,
though he has broken <span id="page_36">p. 36</span> <span
id="an_iii.ii-Page_36"></span> for ever with the bondage of the senses,
he perceives in every manifestation of life a sacramental meaning; a
loveliness, a wonder, a heightened significance, which is hidden from
other men. He may, with St. Francis, call the Sun and the Moon, Water
and Fire, his brothers and his sisters: or receive, with Blake, the
message of the trees. Because of his cultivation of disinterested love,
because his outlook is not conditioned by “the exclusive action of the
will-to-live,” he has attained the power of communion with the living
reality of the universe; and in this respect can truly say that he finds
“God in all and all in God.” Thus, the skilled spiritual vision of Lady
Julian, transcending the limitations of human perception, entering into
harmony with a larger world whose rhythms cannot be received by common
men, *saw* the all-enfolding Divine Life, the mesh of reality. “For as
the body is clad in the cloth,” she said, “and the flesh in the skin and
the bones in the flesh and the heart in the whole, so are we, soul and
body, clad in the Goodness of God and enclosed. Yea, and more homely:
for all these may waste and wear away, but the Goodness of God is ever
whole.”  <span id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md) Many mystical poets and
pantheistic mystics never pass beyond this degree of lucidity.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p50"></span>On the other hand, the full mystic
consciousness also attains to what is, I think, its really
characteristic quality. It develops the power of apprehending the
Absolute, Pure Being, the utterly Transcendent: or, as its possessor
would say, can experience “passive union with God.” This all-round
expansion of consciousness, with its dual power of knowing by communion
the temporal and eternal, immanent and transcendent aspects of
reality—the life of the All, vivid, flowing and changing, and the
changeless, conditionless life of the One—is the peculiar mark, the
<span id="an_iii.ii-p50.1"></span> *ultimo sigillo* of the great mystic,
and must never be forgotten in studying his life and work.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p51"></span>As the ordinary man is the meeting-place
between two stages of reality—the sense-world and the world of spiritual
life—so the mystic, standing head and shoulders above ordinary men, is
again the meeting-place between two orders. Or, if you like it better,
he is able to perceive and react to reality under two modes. On the one
hand he knows, and rests in, the eternal world of Pure Being, the “Sea
Pacific” of the Godhead, indubitably present to him in his ecstasies,
attained by him in the union of love. On the other, he knows—and works
in—that “stormy sea,” the vital World of Becoming which is the
expression of Its will. “Illuminated men,” says Ruysbroeck, “are caught
up, above the reason, into naked vision. There the Divine Unity dwells
and calls them. Hence their bare vision, cleansed and free, penetrates
the activity <span id="page_37">p. 37</span> <span
id="an_iii.ii-Page_37"></span> of all created things, and pursues it to
search it out even to its height.”  <span id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md)

<span id="an_iii.ii-p53"></span>Though philosophy has striven since
thought began—and striven in vain—to resolve the paradox of Being and
Becoming, of Eternity and Time, she has failed strangely enough to
perceive that a certain type of personality has substituted experience
for her guesses at truth; and achieved its solution, not by the dubious
processes of thought, but by direct perception. To the great mystic the
“problem of the Absolute” presents itself in terms of life, not in terms
of dialectic. He solves it in terms of life: by a change or growth of
consciousness which—thanks to his peculiar genius—enables him to
apprehend that two-fold Vision of Reality which eludes the perceptive
powers of other men. It is extraordinary that this fact of experience a
central fact for the understanding of the contemplative type—has
received so little attention from writers upon mysticism. As we proceed
with our inquiry, its importance, its far-reaching implications in the
domains of psychology, of theology, of action, will become more and more
evident. It provides the reason why the mystics could never accept the
diagram of the Vitalists or Evolutionists as a complete statement of the
nature of Reality. “Whatever be the limits of your knowledge, we
know”—they would say—“that the world has another aspect than this: the
aspect which is present to the Mind of God.” “Tranquillity according to
His essence, activity according to His nature: perfect stillness,
perfect fecundity,”  <span id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md) says
Ruysbroeck again, this is the two-fold character of the Absolute. That
which to us is action, to Him, they declare, is rest, “His very peace
and stillness coming from the brimming fullness of His infinite life.”
 <span id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md) That which to us is Many, to that
Transcendent Knower is One. Our World of Becoming rests on the bosom of
that Pure Being which has ever been the final Object of man’s quest: the
“river in which we cannot bathe twice” is the stormy flood of life
flowing toward that divine sea. “How glorious,” says the Voice of the
Eternal to St. Catherine of Siena, “is that soul which has indeed been
able to pass from the stormy ocean to Me, the Sea Pacific, and in that
Sea, which is Myself, to fill the pitcher of her heart.”  <span
id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md)

<span id="an_iii.ii-p57"></span>The evolution of the mystic
consciousness, then, brings its possessors to this transcendent point of
view: their secret is this unity in diversity, this stillness in strife.
Here they are in harmony with Heracleitus rather than with his modern
interpreters. That <span id="page_38">p. 38</span> <span
id="an_iii.ii-Page_38"></span> most mystical of philosophers discerned a
hidden unity beneath the battle, transcending all created opposites, and
taught his disciples that “Having hearkened not unto me but unto the
Logos, it is wise to confess that all things are *one.”*  <span
id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md) This is the secret at which the
idealists’ and concept of Pure Being has tried, so timidly, to hint: and
which the Vitalists’ more intimate, more actual concept of Becoming has
tried, so unnecessarily, to destroy. We shall see the glorious raiment
in which the Christian mystics deck it when we come to consider their
theological map of the quest.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p59"></span>If it be objected—and this objection has
been made by advocates of each school of thought—that the existence of
the idealists’ and mystics’ “Absolute” is utterly inconsistent with the
deeply alive, striving life which the Vitalists identify with reality, I
reply that both concepts at bottom are but symbols of realities which
the human mind can never reach: and that the idea of stillness, unity
and peace is and has ever been humanity’s best translation of its
intuition of the achieved Perfection of God. “‘In the midst of silence a
hidden word was spoken to me.’ Where is this Silence, and where is the
place in which this word is spoken? It is in the purest that the soul
can produce, in her noblest part, in the Ground, even the Being of the
Soul.”  <span id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md) So Eckhart: and here he
does but subscribe to a universal tradition. The mystics have always
insisted that “Be still, be still, and *know* ” is the condition of
man’s purest and most direct apprehensions of reality: that he
experiences in quiet the truest and deepest activity: and Christianity
when she formulated her philosophy made haste to adopt and express this
paradox.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p61"></span><span id="an_iii.ii-p61.1"></span>
*“Quid es ergo, Deus meus?”* said St. Augustine, and gave an answer in
which the vision of the mystic, the genius of the philosopher, combined
to hint something at least of the paradox of intimacy and majesty in
that all-embracing, all-transcending One. “Summe, optime, potentissime,
omnipotentissime, misericordissime et justissime, secretissime et
presentissime, pulcherrime et fortissime; stabilis et
incomprehensibilis; immutabilis, mutans omnia. Numquam novus, nunquam
vetus. . . . Semper agens, semper quietus: colligens et non egens:
portans et implens et protegens; creans et nutriens et perficiens:
quaerens cum nihil desit tibi. . . . Quid dicimus, Deus meus, vita mea,
dulcedo mea sancta? Aut quid dicit aliquis, cum de te dicit?”  <span
id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md) <span id="page_39">p. 39</span> <span
id="an_iii.ii-Page_39"></span>

<span id="an_iii.ii-p63"></span>It has been said that “Whatever we may
do, our hunger for the Absolute will never cease.” This hunger—that
innate craving for, and intuition of, a final Unity, an unchanging
good—will go on, however heartily we may feed on those fashionable
systems which offer us a dynamic or empirical universe. If, now, we
admit in all living creatures—as Vitalists must do—an instinct of
self-preservation, a free directive force which may be trusted and which
makes for life: is it just to deny such an instinct to the human soul?
The “entelechy” of the Vitalists, the “hidden steersman,” drives the
phenomenal world on and up. What about that other sure instinct embedded
in the race, breaking out again and again, which drives the spirit on
and up; spurs it eternally towards an end which it feels to be definite
yet cannot define? Shall we distrust this instinct for the Absolute, as
living and ineradicable as any other of our powers, merely because
philosophy finds it difficult to accommodate and to describe?

<span id="an_iii.ii-p64"></span>“We must,” says Plato in the “Timaeus,”
“make a distinction of the two great forms of being, and ask, ‘What is
that which Is and has no Becoming, and what is that which is always
becoming and never Is?’“  <span id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md) Without
necessarily subscribing to the Platonic answer to this question, we may
surely acknowledge that the question itself is sound and worth asking;
that it expresses a perennial demand of human nature; and that the
analogy of man’s other instincts and cravings assures us that these his
fundamental demands always indicate the existence of a supply.  <span
id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md) The great defect of Vitalism, considered
as a system, is that it only answers half the question; the half which
Absolute Idealism disdained to answer at all.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p67"></span>We have seen that the mystical
experience, the fullest all-round experience in regard to the
transcendental world which humanity has attained, declares that there
are two aspects, two planes of discoverable Reality. We have seen also
that hints of these two planes—often clear statements concerning
them—abound in mystical literature of the personal first-hand type.
 <span id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md) Pure Being, <span id="page_40">p.
40</span> <span id="an_iii.ii-Page_40"></span> says Boutroux in the
course of his exposition of Boehme,  <span
id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md) has two characteristic manifestations. It
shows itself to us as Power, by means of strife, of the struggle and
opposition of its own qualities. But it shows itself to us as Reality,
in harmonizing and reconciling within itself these discordant opposites.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p70"></span>Its manifestation as Power, then, is for
us in the dynamic World of Becoming, amidst the thud and surge of that
life which is compounded of paradox, of good and evil, joy and sorrow,
life and death. Here, Boehme declares that the Absolute God is
voluntarily self-revealing. But each revelation has as its condition the
appearance of its opposite: light can only be recognized at the price of
knowing darkness, life needs death, love needs wrath. Hence if Pure
Being—the Good, Beautiful and True—is to reveal itself, it must do so by
evoking and opposing its contrary: as in the Hegelian dialectic no idea
is complete without its negative. Such a revelation by strife, however,
is rightly felt by man to be incomplete. Absolute Reality, the Player
whose sublime music is expressed at the cost of this everlasting
friction between bow and lyre, is present, it is true, in His music. But
He is best known in that “light behind,” that unity where all these
opposites are lifted up into harmony, into a higher synthesis; and the
melody is perceived, not as a difficult progress of sound, but as a
whole.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p71"></span>We have, then, ( *a* ) The achieved
Reality which the Greeks, and every one after them, meant by that
seemingly chill abstraction which they called Pure Being: that Absolute
One, unconditioned and undiscoverable, in Whom all is resumed. In the
undifferentiated Godhead of Eckhart, the Transcendent Father of orthodox
Christian theology, we see the mind’s attempt to conceive that “wholly
other” Reality, unchanging yet changer of all. It is the great
contribution of the mystics to humanity’s knowledge of the real that
they find in this Absolute, in defiance of the metaphysicians, a
personal object of love, the goal of their quest, a “Living One who
lives first and lives perfectly, and Who, touching me, the inferior,
derivative life, can cause me to live by Him and for His sake”  <span
id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54.md) .

<span id="an_iii.ii-p73"></span>( *b* ) But, contradicting the nihilism
of Eastern contemplatives, they see also a reality in the dynamic side
of things: in the seething pot of appearance. They are aware of an
eternal Becoming, a striving, free, evolving life; not merely as a
shadow-show, but as an implicit of their Cosmos felt also in the travail
of their own souls—God’s manifestation or showing, in which He is
immanent, in which His Spirit truly works and strives. It is in *this*
plane of <span id="page_41">p. 41</span> <span
id="an_iii.ii-Page_41"></span> reality that all individual life is
immersed: this is the stream which set out from the Heart of God and
“turns again home.”

<span id="an_iii.ii-p74"></span>The mystic knows his task to be the
attainment of Being, Eternal Life, union with the One, the “return to
the Father’s heart”: for the parable of the Prodigal Son is to him the
history of the universe. This union is to be attained, first by
cooperation in that Life which bears him up, in which he is immersed. He
must become conscious of this “great life of the All,” merge himself in
it, if he would find his way back whence he came. <span
id="an_iii.ii-p74.1"></span> *Vae soli* . Hence there are really two
distinct acts of “divine union,” two distinct kinds of illumination
involved in the Mystic Way: the dual character of the spiritual
consciousness brings a dual responsibility in its train. First, there is
the union with Life, with the World of Becoming: and parallel with it,
the illumination by which the mystic “gazes upon a more veritable
world.” Secondly, there is the union with Being, with the One: and that
final, ineffable illumination of pure love which is called the
“knowledge of God.” It is through the development of the third factor,
the free, creative “spirit,” the scrap of Absolute Life which is the
ground of his soul, that the mystic can (a) conceive and (b) accomplish
these transcendent acts. Only Being can know Being: we “behold that
which we are, and are that which we behold.” But there is a spark in
man’s soul, say the mystics, which is real—which in fact is—and by its
cultivation we may know reality. “Thus,” says Von Hügel “a real
succession, real efforts, and the continuous sense of limitation and
inadequacy are the very means in and through which man apprehends
increasingly (if only he thus loves and wills) the contrasting yet
sustaining Simultaneity, Spontaneity, Infinity, and pure action of the
Eternal Life of God.”  <span id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55.md)

<span id="an_iii.ii-p76"></span>Over and over again—as Being and
Becoming, as Eternity and Time, as Transcendence and Immanence, Reality
and Appearance, the One and the Many—these two dominant ideas, demands,
imperious instincts of man’s self will reappear; the warp and woof of
his completed universe. On the one hand is his intuition of a remote,
unchanging Somewhat calling him: on the other there is his longing for
and as clear intuition of an intimate, adorable Somewhat, companioning
him. Man’s true Real, his only adequate God, must be great enough to
embrace this sublime paradox, to take up these apparent negations into a
higher synthesis. Neither the utter transcendence of extreme Absolutism,
nor the utter immanence of the Vitalists will do. Both these, taken
alone, are declared by the mystics to be incomplete. They conceive that
Absolute Being who is the goal of their quest as manifesting Himself in
a World of Becoming: working in it, at one with it <span id="page_42">p.
42</span> <span id="an_iii.ii-Page_42"></span> yet though <span
id="an_iii.ii-p76.1"></span> *semper agens,* also <span
id="an_iii.ii-p76.2"></span> *semper quietus* .The Divine spirit which
they know to be immanent in the heart and in the universe comes forth
from and returns to the Transcendent One; and this division of persons
in unity of substance completes the “Eternal Circle, from Goodness,
through Goodness, to Goodness.”

<span id="an_iii.ii-p77"></span>Absolute Being and Becoming, the All and
the One, are found to be alike inadequate to their definition of this
discovered Real; the “triple star of Goodness, Truth, and Beauty.”
Speaking always from experience—the most complete experience achieved by
man—they assure us of an Absolute which overpasses and includes the
Absolute of philosophy, far transcends that Cosmic life which it fills
and sustains, and is best defined in terms of Transcendent Personality;
which because of its unspeakable richness and of the poverty of human
speech, they have sometimes been driven to define only by negations. At
once static and dynamic, above life and in it, “all love yet all law,”
eternal in essence though working in time, this vision resolves the
contraries which tease those who study it from without, and swallows up
whilst it kindles to life all the partial interpretations of metaphysics
and of science.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p78"></span>Here then stands the mystic. By the help
of two types of philosophy, eked out by the resources of symbolic
expression and suggestion, he has contrived to tell us something of his
vision and his claim. Confronted by that vision—that sublime intuition
of eternity—we may surely ask, indeed are bound to ask, “What is the
machinery by which this self, akin to the imprisoned and sense-fed self
of our daily experience, has contrived to slip its fetters and rise to
those levels of spiritual perception on which alone such vision can be
possible to man? How has it brought within the field of consciousness
those deep intuitions which fringe upon Absolute Life; how developed
powers by which it is enabled to arrive at this amazing, this superhuman
concept of the nature of Reality?” Psychology will do something,
perhaps, to help us to an answer to this question; and it is her
evidence which we must examine next. But for the fullest and most
satisfying answer we must go to the mystics; and they reply to our
questions, when we ask them, in the direct and uncompromising terms of
action, not in the refined and elusive periods of speculative thought.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p79"></span>“Come with us,” they say to the
bewildered and entangled self, craving for finality and peace, “and we
will show you a way out that shall not only be an issue from your
prison, but also a pathway to your Home. True, you are immersed, fold
upon fold, in the World of Becoming; worse, you are besieged on all
sides by the persistent illusions of sense. But you too are a child of
the Absolute. You bear within you the earnest of your inheritance. At
the apex of <span id="page_43">p. 43</span> <span
id="an_iii.ii-Page_43"></span> your spirit there is a little door, so
high up that only by hard climbing can you reach it. There the Object of
your craving stands and knocks; thence came those persistent
messages—faint echoes from the Truth eternally hammering at your
gates—which disturbed the comfortable life of sense. Come up then by
this pathway, to those higher levels of reality to which, in virtue of
the eternal spark in you, you belong. Leave your ignoble ease, your
clever prattle, your absurd attempts to solve the apparent
contradictions of a Whole too great for your useful little mind to
grasp. Trust your deep instincts: use your latent powers. Appropriate
that divine, creative life which is the very substance of your being.
Remake yourself in its interest, if you would know its beauty and its
truth. You can only behold that which you *are.* Only the Real can know
Reality.”

#### <span id="an_iii.ii-p79.1"></span>NOTE TO THE TWELFTH EDITION

<span id="an_iii.ii-p80"></span>THE changed philosophic outlook since
this chapter was first written, eighteen years ago, has now given to it
a somewhat old-fashioned air. The ideas of Bergson and Eucken no longer
occupy the intellectual foreground. Were I now writing it for the first
time, my examples would be chosen from other philosophers, and
especially from those who are bringing back into modern thought the
critical realism of the scholastics. But the position which is here
defended—that a limited dualism, a “Two-step philosophy,” is the only
type of metaphysic adequate to the facts of mystical experience remains
in my own mind as true as before. Now that mysticism enjoys the
patronage of many pious monists and philosophic naturalists, this view
seems more than ever in need of strong and definite statement.

most just, most deeply hid and yet most near. Fairest, yet strongest:
steadfast, yet unseizable; unchangeable yet changing all things: never
new, yet never old. . . . Ever busy, yet ever at rest; gathering yet
needing not: bearing, filling, guarding: creating, nourishing and
perfecting; seeking though Thou hast no wants. . . . What can I say, my
God, my life, my holy joy? or what can any say who speaks of Thee?”
Compare the strikingly similar Sufi definition of the Nature of God, as
given in Palmer’s “Oriental Mysticism,” pp. 22,23. “First and last, End
and Limit of all things, incomparable and unchangeable, always near yet
always far,” &c. This probably owes something to Platonic influence.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p66"></span> “A natural craving,” said Aquinas,
“cannot be in vain.” Philosophy is creeping back to this “mediaeval’
point of view. Compare “Summa Contra Gentiles,” I. ii. cap. lxxix.

<span id="an_iii.ii-p68"></span> Compare Dante’s vision in Par. xxx.,
where he sees Reality first as the streaming River of Light, the flux of
things; and then, when his sight has been purged, as achieved
Perfection, the Sempiternal Rose.
