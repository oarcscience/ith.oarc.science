### VI. Introversion. Part I: Recollection and Qui

<span id="an_iv.vi"></span>

<span id="an_iv.vi-p1"></span>In<span id="an_iv.vi-p1.1"></span> our
study of the First Mystic Life, its purification and illumination, we
have been analysing and considering a process of organic development; an
evolution of personality. We may treat this either as a movement of
consciousness towards higher levels, or as a remaking of consciousness
consequent on the emergence and growth of a factor which is dormant in
ordinary man, but destined to be supreme in the full-grown mystic type.
We have seen the awakening of this factor—this spark of the soul—with
its innate capacity for apprehending the Absolute. We have seen it
attack and conquer the old sense-fed and self-centred life of the normal
self, and introduce it into a new universe, lit up by the Uncreated
Light. These were the events which, taken together, constituted the
“First Mystic Life”; a complete round upon the spiral road which leads
from man to God.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p2"></span>What we have been looking at, then, is a
life-process, the establishment of a certain harmony between the created
self and that Reality whose invitation it has heard: and we have
discussed this life-process rather as if it contained no elements which
were not referable to natural and spontaneous growth, to the involuntary
<span id="page_299">p. 299</span> <span id="an_iv.vi-Page_299"></span>
adjustments of the organism to that extended or transcendental universe
of which it gradually becomes aware. But side by side with this organic
growth there always goes a specific kind of activity which is
characteristic of the mystic: an education which he is called to
undertake, that his consciousness of the Infinite may be stabilized,
enriched and defined. Already once or twice we have been in the presence
of this activity, have been obliged to take its influence into account:
as, were we studying other artistic types, we could not leave on one
side the medium in which they work.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p3"></span> *Contemplation* is the mystic’s medium.
It is an extreme form of that withdrawal of attention from the external
world and total dedication of the mind which also, in various degrees
and ways, conditions the creative activity of musician, painter and
poet: releasing the faculty by which he can apprehend the Good and
Beautiful, enter into communion with the Real. As “voice” or “vision” is
often the way in which the mystical consciousness presents its
discoveries to the surface-mind, so contemplation is the way in which it
makes those discoveries, perceives the suprasensible over against
itself. The growth of the mystic’s effective genius, therefore, is
connected with his growth in this art: and that growth is largely
conditioned by education.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p4"></span>The painter, however great his natural
powers, can hardly dispense with some technical training; the musician
is wise if he acquaint himself at least with the elements of
counterpoint. So too the mystic. It is true that he sometimes seems to
spring abruptly to the heights, to be caught into ecstasy without
previous preparation: as a poet may startle the world by a sudden
masterpiece. But unless they be backed by discipline, these sudden and
isolated flashes of inspiration will not long avail for the production
of great works. <span id="an_iv.vi-p4.1"></span>“Ordina quest’ amore, o
tu che m’ami” is the imperative demand made by Goodness, Truth, and
Beauty, by every aspect of Reality, upon the human soul. Lover and
philosopher, saint, artist, and scientist, must alike obey or fail.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p5"></span>Transcendental genius, then, obeys the
laws which govern all other forms of genius, in being susceptible of
culture: and, indeed, cannot develop its full powers without an
educative process of some kind. This strange art of contemplation, which
the mystic tends to practise during the whole of his career—which
develops step by step with his vision and his love—demands of the self
which undertakes it the same hard dull work, the same slow training of
the will, which lies behind all supreme achievement, and is the price of
all true liberty. It is the want of such training—such “supersensual
drill”—which is responsible for the mass of vague, ineffectual, and
sometimes harmful mysticism which has <span id="page_300">p. 300</span>
<span id="an_iv.vi-Page_300"></span> always existed: the dilute cosmic
emotion and limp spirituality which hang, as it were, on the skirts of
the true seekers of the Absolute, and bring discredit upon their
science.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p6"></span>In this, as in all the other and lesser
arts which have been developed by the race, education consists largely
in a humble willingness to submit to the discipline, and profit by the
lessons, of the past. Tradition runs side by side with experience; the
past collaborates with the present. Each new and eager soul rushing out
towards the only end of Love passes on its way the landmarks left by
others upon the pathway to Reality. If it be wise it observes them: and
finds in them rather helps towards attainment than hindrances to that
freedom which is of the essence of the mystic act. This act, it is true,
is in the last resort a solitary experience, “the flight of the Alone to
the Alone”; even though no achievement of the soul truly takes place
*in* *vacao,* or leaves the universe of souls unchanged. At the same
time, here as elsewhere, man cannot safely divorce his personal history
from that of the race. The best and truest experience does not come to
the eccentric and individual pilgrim whose intuitions are his only law:
but rather to him who is willing to profit by the culture of the
spiritual society in which he finds himself, and submit personal
intuition to the guidance afforded by the general history of the mystic
type. Those who refuse this guidance expose themselves to all the
dangers which crowd about the individualist: from heresy at one end of
the scale to madness at the other. *Vae Soli!* Nowhere more clearly than
in the history of mysticism do we observe the essential solidarity of
mankind, the penalty paid by those who will not acknowledge it.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p7"></span>The education which tradition has ever
prescribed for the mystic, consists in the gradual development of an
extraordinary faculty of concentration, a power of spiritual attention.
It is not enough that he should naturally be “aware of the Absolute,”
unless he be able to contemplate it: just as the mere possession of
eyesight or hearing, however acute, needs to be supplemented by trained
powers of perception and reception, if we are really to appreciate—see
or hear to any purpose—the masterpieces of Music or of Art. More, Nature
herself reveals little of her secret to those who only look and listen
with the outward ear and eye. The condition of all valid seeing and
hearing, upon every plane of consciousness, lies not in the sharpening
of the senses, but in a peculiar attitude of the whole personality: in a
self-forgetting attentiveness, a profound concentration, a self-merging,
which operates a real communion between the seer and the seen—in a word,
in *Contemplation.*

<span id="an_iv.vi-p8"></span>Contemplation, then, in the most general
sense is a power which we may—and often must—apply to the perception,
not <span id="page_301">p. 301</span> <span
id="an_iv.vi-Page_301"></span> only of Divine Reality, but of anything.
It is a mental attitude under which all things give up to us the secret
of their life. All artists are of necessity in some measure
contemplative. In so far as they surrender themselves without selfish
preoccupation, they see Creation from the point of view of God.  <span
id="fr_629"></span>[630](#fn_629.md) “Innocence of eye” is little else than
this: and only by its means can they see truly those things which they
desire to show the world. I invite those to whom these statements seem a
compound of cheap psychology and cheaper metaphysics to clear their
minds of prejudice and submit this matter to an experimental test. If
they will be patient and honest—and unless they belong to that minority
which is temperamentally incapable of the simplest contemplative
act—they will emerge from the experiment possessed of a little new
knowledge as to the nature of the relation between the human mind and
the outer world.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p10"></span>All that is asked is that we shall look
for a little time, in a special and undivided manner, at some simple,
concrete, and external thing. This object of our contemplation may be
almost anything we please: a picture, a statue, a tree, a distant
hillside, a growing plant, running water, little living things. We need
not, with Kant, go to the starry heavens. “A little thing the quantity
of an hazel nut” will do for us, as it did for Lady Julian long ago.
 <span id="fr_630"></span>[631](#fn_630.md) Remember, it is a practical
experiment on which we are set; not an opportunity of pretty and
pantheistic meditation.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p12"></span>Look, then, at this thing which you have
chosen. Wilfully yet tranquilly refuse the messages which countless
other aspects of the world are sending; and so concentrate your whole
attention on this one act of loving sight that all other objects are
excluded from the conscious field. Do not think, but as it were pour out
your personality towards it: let your soul be in your eyes. Almost at
once, this new method of perception will reveal unsuspected qualities in
the external world. First, you will perceive about you a strange and
deepening quietness; a slowing down of our feverish mental time. Next,
you will become aware of a heightened significance, an intensified
existence in the thing at which you look. As you, with all your
consciousness, lean out towards it, an answering current will meet
yours. It seems as though the barrier between its life and your own,
between subject and object, had melted away. <span id="page_302">p.
302</span> <span id="an_iv.vi-Page_302"></span> You are merged with it,
in an act of true communion: and you *know* the secret of its being
deeply and unforgettably, yet in a way which you can never hope to
express.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p13"></span>Seen thus, a thistle has celestial
qualities: a speckled hen a touch of the sublime. Our greater comrades,
the trees, the clouds, the rivers, initiate us into mighty secrets,
flame out at us “like shining from shook foil.” The “eye which looks
upon Eternity” has been given its opportunity. We have been immersed for
a moment in the “life of the All”: a deep and peaceful love unites us
with the substance of all things, a “Mystic Marriage” has taken place
between the mind and some aspect of the external world. <span
id="an_iv.vi-p13.1"></span> *Cor ad cor loquitur* :Life has spoken to
life, but not to the surface-intelligence. That surface-intelligence
knows only that the message was true and beautiful: no more.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p14"></span>The price of this experience has been a
stilling of that surface-mind, a calling in of all our scattered
interests: an entire giving of ourselves to this one activity, without
self-consciousness, without reflective thought. To reflect is always to
distort: our minds are not good mirrors. The contemplative, on whatever
level his faculty may operate, is contented to absorb and be absorbed:
and by this humble access he attains to a plane of knowledge which no
intellectual process can come near.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p15"></span>I do not suggest that this simple
experiment is in any sense to be equated with the transcendental
contemplation of the mystic. Yet it exercises on a small scale, and in
regard to visible Nature, the same natural faculties which are taken up
and used—it is true upon other levels, and in subjection to the
transcendental sense—in his apprehension of the Invisible Real. Though
it is one thing to see truthfully for an instant the flower in the
crannied wall, another to be lifted up to the apprehension of “eternal
Truth, true Love and loved Eternity,” yet both according to their
measure are functions of the inward eye, operating in the “suspension of
the mind.”

<span id="an_iv.vi-p16"></span>This humble receptiveness, this still and
steady gazing, in which emotion, will, and thought are lost and fused,
is the secret of the great contemplative on fire with love of that which
he has been allowed to see. But whilst the contemplation of Nature
entails an outgoing towards somewhat indubitably external to us, and has
as its material the world of sensible experience: the contemplation of
Spirit, as it seems to those who practise it, requires a deliberate
refusal of the messages of the senses, an ingoing or “introversion” of
our faculties, a “journey towards the centre.” The Kingdom of God, they
say, is within you: seek it, then, in the most secret habitations of the
soul. The mystic must learn so to concentrate all his faculties, his
very self, upon the invisible and intangible, <span id="page_303">p.
303</span> <span id="an_iv.vi-Page_303"></span> that all visible things
are forgot: to bring it so sharply into focus that everything else is
blurred. He must call in his scattered faculties by a deliberate
exercise of the will, empty his mind of its swarm of images, its riot of
thought. In mystical language he must “sink into his nothingness”: into
that blank abiding place where busy, clever Reason cannot come. The
whole of this process, this gathering up and turning “inwards” of the
powers of the self, this gazing into the ground of the soul, is that
which is called *Introversion.*

<span id="an_iv.vi-p17"></span>Introversion is an art which can be
acquired, as gradually and as certainly, by the born mystic, as the art
of piano-playing can be acquired by the born musician. In both cases it
is the genius of the artist which makes his use of the instrument
effective: but it is also his education in the use of the instrument
which enables that genius to express itself in an adequate way. Such
mystical education, of course, presumes a something that can be
educated: the “New Birth,” the awakening of the deeper self, must have
taken place before it can begin. It is a psychological process, and
obeys psychological laws. There is in it no element of the unexpected or
the abnormal. In technical language, we are here concerned with
“ordinary” not “extraordinary” contemplation.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p18"></span>In its early stages the practice of
introversion is voluntary, difficult, and deliberate; as are the early
stages of learning to read or write. But as reading or writing finally
becomes automatic, so as the mystic’s training in introversion proceeds,
habits are formed: and those contemplative powers which he is educating
establish themselves amongst his normal faculties. Sometimes they wholly
dominate these faculties, escape the control of the will, and appear
spontaneously, seizing upon the conscious field. Such violent and
involuntary invasions of the transcendental powers, when they utterly
swamp the surface-consciousness and the subject is therefore cut off
from his ordinary “external world,” constitute the typical experience of
*rapture* or *ecstasy.* It is under the expansive formula of such abrupt
ecstatic perception, “not by gradual steps, but by sudden ecstatic
flights soaring aloft to the glorious things on high,”  <span
id="fr_631"></span>[632](#fn_631.md) that the mystical consciousness of
Divine Transcendence is most clearly expressed. Those wide, exalted
apprehensions of the Godhead which we owe to the mystics have usually
been obtained, not by industrious meditation, but by “a transcending of
all creatures, a perfect going forth from oneself: by standing in an
ecstasy of mind.”  <span id="fr_632"></span>[633](#fn_632.md) Hence the
experiences peculiar to these ecstatic states have a great value for the
student of mysticism. It will be our duty to consider them in detail in
a <span id="page_304">p. 304</span> <span id="an_iv.vi-Page_304"></span>
later section of this book. The normal and deliberate practice of
introversion, on the contrary, is bound up with the sense of Divine
Immanence. Its emphasis is on the indwelling God Who may be found “by a
journey towards the centre”: on the conviction indeed that “angels and
archangels are with us, but He is more truly our own who is not only
*with us* but *in us* .”  <span id="fr_633"></span>[634](#fn_633.md)

<span id="an_iv.vi-p22"></span>Contemplation—taking that term in its
widest sense, as embracing all the degrees and kinds of mystical
prayer—establishes communion between the soul and the Absolute by way of
these complementary modes of apprehending that which is One. A. The
usually uncontrollable, definitely outgoing, ecstatic experience; the
attainment of Pure Being, or “flight to God.” B. The more controllable
ingoing experience; the breaking down of the barrier between the
surface-self and those deeper levels of personality where God is met and
known “in our nothingness,” and a mysterious fusion of divine and human
life takes place. The one, says the Christian mystic, is the “going
forth to the Father”; the other is the “marriage with the Son.” Both are
operated by the Spirit whose dwelling is in the “spark of the soul.” Yet
it is probable, in spite of the spatial language which the mystics
always use concerning them, that these two experiences, in their most
sublime forms, are but opposite aspects of one whole: the complementary
terms of a higher synthesis beyond our span. In that consummation of
love which Ruysbroeck has called “the peace of the summits” they meet:
then distinctions between inward and outward, near and far, cease to
have any meaning, in “the dim silence where lovers lose themselves.” “To
mount to God,” says the writer of “De Adhaerando Deo,” “is to enter into
one’s self. For he who inwardly entereth and intimately penetrateth into
himself, gets above and beyond himself and truly mounts up to God.”
 <span id="fr_634"></span>[635](#fn_634.md)

<span id="an_iv.vi-p24"></span>Says Tauler of this ineffable
meeting-place, which is to the intellect an emptiness, and to the heart
a fulfillment of all desire, “All there is so still and mysterious and
so desolate: for there is nothing there but God only, and nothing
strange. . . . This Wilderness is the Quiet Desert of the Godhead, into
which He leads all who are to receive this inspiration of God, now or in
Eternity.”  <span id="fr_635"></span>[636](#fn_635.md) From this “quiet
desert,” this still plane of being, so near to her though she is far
from it, the normal self is separated by all the “unquiet desert” of
sensual existence. Yet it stretches through and in her, the stuff of
Reality, the very Ground of her being, since it is, in Julian’s words,
“the Substance of all that is”: linking that <span id="page_305">p.
305</span> <span id="an_iv.vi-Page_305"></span> being at once with the
universe and with God. “God is near us, but we are far from Him, God is
within, we are without, God is at home, we are in the far country,” said
Meister Eckhart, struggling to express the nature of this “intelligible
where.”  <span id="fr_636"></span>[637](#fn_636.md) Clearly, if the self is
ever to become aware of it, definite work must be undertaken, definite
powers of perception must be trained: and the consciousness which has
been evolved to meet the exigencies of the World of Becoming must be
initiated into that World of Being from which it came forth.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p27"></span>Plato long ago defined the necessity of
such a perception, and the nature of that art of contemplation by which
the soul can feed upon the Real, when he said in one of his most purely
mystical passages, “When the soul returns into itself and reflects, it
passes into . . . the region of that which is pure and everlasting,
immortal and unchangeable: and, feeling itself kindred thereto, it
dwells there under its own control, and has rest from its wanderings.”
 <span id="fr_637"></span>[638](#fn_637.md) In the “contemplation” of Plato
and of the Platonic Schools generally, however, the emphasis lies at
least as much on intellect as on intuition: with him the head and not
the heart is the meeting-place between man and the Real. “Anciently,”
says Augustine Baker, “there was a certain kind of false contemplation,
which we may call philosophical, practised by some learned heathens of
old, and imitated by some in these days, which hath for its last and
best end only the perfection of knowledge, and a delightful complacency
in it. . . . To this rank of philosophical contemplations may be
referred those scholastic wits which spend much time in the study and
subtle examination of the mysteries of faith, and have not for their end
the increasing of divine love in their hearts.”  <span
id="fr_638"></span>[639](#fn_638.md)

<span id="an_iv.vi-p30"></span>We cannot long read the works of the
mystics without coming across descriptions—often first-hand descriptions
of great psychological interest—of the processes through which the self
must pass, the discipline which it must undertake, in the course of
acquiring the art of contemplation. Most of these descriptions differ in
detail; in the divisions adopted, the emotions experienced, the number
of “degrees” through which the subject passes, from the first painful
attempt to gather up its faculties to the supreme point at which it
feels itself to be “lost in God.” In each there is that quality of
uniqueness which is inherent in every expression of life: in each the
temperamental bias and analytical powers of the writer have exerted a
further modifying influence. All, however, describe a connected
experience, the progressive concentration of the entire self under the
spur of love upon the contemplation <span id="page_306">p. 306</span>
<span id="an_iv.vi-Page_306"></span> of transcendental reality. As the
Mystic Way involves transcendence of character, the sublimation of the
instinctive life and movement of the whole man to higher levels of
vitality, his attainment of freedom, so the ascent of the ladder of
contemplation involves such a transcendence, or movement to high levels
of liberty, of his perceptive powers.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p31"></span>The steps of the ladder, the substance of
the progressive exercises undertaken by the developing self, its
education in the art of contemplation, are usually know by the Christian
mystics as the “degrees of prayer” or “orison.” But the common
implications of the word “prayer,” with its suggestions of formal
devotion, detailed petition—a definite something asked for, and a
definite duty done, by means of extemporary or traditional
allocutions—do not really suggest the nature of those supersensual
activities which the mystics mean to express in their use of this term.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p32"></span>Mystical prayer, or “orison”—the term
which I propose for the sake of clearness to use here—has nothing in
common with petition. It is not articulate; it has no forms. “It is,”
says “The Mirror of St. Edmund,” “naught else but yearning of soul.”
 <span id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639.md) —the expression of man’s
metaphysical thirst. In it, says Grou, “the soul is united to God in its
ground, the created intelligence to the Intelligence Increate, without
the intervention of imagination or reason, or of anything but a very
simple attention of the mind and an equally simple application of the
will.”  <span id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640.md) On the psychological
side its development involves a steady discipline of the mystic’s rich
subliminal mind, slowly preparing the channels in which the deeper
consciousness is to flow. This discipline reduces to some sort of order,
makes effective for life, those involuntary states of passivity, rapture
and intuition which are the characteristic ways in which an
uncontrolled, uncultivated genius for the Absolute breaks out. To the
subject himself, however, his orison seems rather a free and mutual act
of love; a supernatural intercourse between the soul and the divine, or
some aspect of the divine, sometimes full of light and joy, sometimes
dark and bare.  <span id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641.md) In some of its
degrees it is a placid, trustful waiting upon messages from without. In
others, it is an inarticulate communion, a wordless rapture, a silent
gazing upon God. The mystics have exhausted all the resources of all
tongues in their efforts to tell us of the rewards <span
id="page_307">p. 307</span> <span id="an_iv.vi-Page_307"></span> which
await those who will undertake this most sublime and difficult of arts.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p36"></span>As we come to know our friends better by
having intercourse with them, so by this deliberate intercourse the self
enters more and more deeply into the Heart of Reality. Climbing like
Dante step by step up the ladder of contemplation, it comes at last to
the Empyrean, <span id="an_iv.vi-p36.1"></span>“ivi è perfetta, matura
ed intera ciascuna disianza.”  <span id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642.md)
The true end of orison, like the true end of that mystical life within
which it flowers, is the supreme meeting between Lover and Beloved,
between God and the soul. Its method is the method of the mystic life,
transcendence: a gradual elimination of sensible image, and bit by bit
approximation of the contemplative self to reality, gradually producing
within it those conditions in which union can take place. This entails a
concentration, a turning inwards, of all those faculties which the
normal self has been accustomed to turn outwards, and fritter upon the
manifold illusions of daily life. It means, during the hours of
introversion, a retreat from and refusal of the Many, in order that the
mind may be able to apprehend the One. “Behold,” says Boehme, “if thou
desirest to see God’s Light in thy Soul, and be divinely illuminated and
conducted, this is the short way that thou art to take; not to let the
Eye of thy Spirit enter into Matter or fill itself with any Thing
whatever, either in Heaven or Earth, but to let it enter by a naked
faith into the Light of the Majesty.”  <span
id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643.md)

<span id="an_iv.vi-p39"></span>“What this opening of the ghostly eye
is,” says Hilton, “the greatest clerk on earth could not imagine by his
wit, nor show fully by his tongue. For it may not be got by study nor
through man’s travail only, but principally by grace of the Holy Ghost
and with travail of man. I dread mickle to speak aught of it, for me
thinketh I cannot; it passeth mine assay, and my lips are unclean.
Nevertheless, for I expect love asketh and love biddeth, therefore I
shall say a little more of it as I hope love teacheth. This opening of
the ghostly eye is that lighty murkness and rich nought that I spake of
before, and it may be called: *Purity of spirit and ghostly rest, inward
stillness and peace of conscience, highness of thought and onlyness of
soul, a lively feeling of grace and privily of heart, the waking sleep
of the spouse and tasting of heavenly savour burning in love and shining
in light, entry of contemplation and reforming in feeling . . .* they
are divers in showing of words, nevertheless they are all one in sense
of soothfastness.”  <span id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644.md)

<span id="an_iv.vi-p41"></span>“Human industry,” says Hilton here, must
be joined to “grace.” If the spiritual eye is to be opened, definite
work must be done. So long as the “eye which looks upon Time” fills
itself with things <span id="page_308">p. 308</span> <span
id="an_iv.vi-Page_308"></span> and usurps the conscious field, that
spiritual eye which “looks upon Eternity” can hardly act at all: and
this eye must not only be opened, it must be trained, so that it may
endure to gaze steadfastly at the Uncreated Light. This training and
purging of the transcendental sight is described under many images;
“diverse in showing of words, one in sense and soothfastness.” Its
essence is a progressive cleaning of the mirror, a progressive
self-emptying of all that is not real the attainment of that unified
state of consciousness which will permit a pure, imageless apprehension
of the final Reality which “hath no image” to be received by the self.
“Naked orison,” “emptiness,” “nothingness,” “entire surrender,”
“peaceful love in life naughted,” say the mystics again and again. Where
apprehension of the divine comes by way of vision or audition, this is
but a concession to human weakness; a sign, they think, that “sensitive
nature” is not yet wholly transcended. It is a translation of the true
tongue of angels into a dialect that the normal mind can understand. A
steady abolition of sense imagery, a cutting off of all possible sources
of illusion, all possible encouragements of selfhood and pride—the most
fertile of all sources of deception—this is the condition of pure sight;
and the “degrees of orison,” the “steep stairs of love” which they climb
so painfully, are based upon this necessity.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p42"></span>The terms used by individual mystics, the
divisions which they adopt in describing the self’s progress in
contemplation, are bewildering in their variety. Here, more than
elsewhere, the mania for classification has obsessed them. We find, too,
when we come to compare one with another, that the language which they
employ is not always so exact as it seems: nor are traditional terms
always used in the same sense. Sometimes by the word “contemplation”
they intend to describe the whole process of introversion: sometimes
they reserve it for the “orison of union,” sometimes identify it with
ecstasy. It has been pointed out by Delacroix that even St. Teresa’s
classification of her own states is far from lucid, and varies in each
of her principal works.  <span id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645.md) Thus in
the “Life” she appears to treat Recollection and Quiet as synonymous,
whilst in “The Way of Perfection” these conditions are sharply
differentiated. In “The Interior Castle” she adopts an entirely
different system; the prayer of quiet being there called “tasting of
God.”  <span id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646.md) Finally, Augustine Baker,
in treating of the “Prayer of Interior Silence and Quiet,” insists that
by the term “Quiet” St. Teresa did not mean this at all, but a form of
“supernatural contemplation.”  <span id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647.md)
<span id="page_309">p. 309</span> <span id="an_iv.vi-Page_309"></span>

<span id="an_iv.vi-p46"></span>Thus we are gradually forced to the
conclusion that the so-called “degrees of orison” so neatly tabulated by
ascetic writers are largely artificial and symbolic: that the process
which they profess to describe is really, like life itself, one and
continuous—not a stairway but a slope—and the parts into which they
break it up are diagrammatic. Nearly every mystic makes these breaks in
a different place, though continuing to use the language of his
predecessors. In his efforts towards self-analysis he divides and
subdivides, combines and differentiates his individual moods. Hence the
confusion of mind which falls upon those who try to harmonize different
systems of contemplation: to identify St. Teresa’s “Four Degrees”  <span
id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648.md) with Hugh of St. Victor’s other four,
 <span id="fr_649"></span>[650](#fn_649.md) and with Richard of St.
Victor’s “four steps of ardent love”:  <span
id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650.md) or to accommodate upon this diagram
Hilton’s simple and poetic “three steps of contemplations—Knowing,
Loving, and Knowing-and-Loving—where the adventurer rather than the
map-maker speaks. Such fine shades, says Augustine Baker in this
connection, are “nicely distinguished” by the author “rather out of a
particular experience of the effects passing in his own soul  <span
id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651.md) which perhaps are not the same in all”
than for any more general reason.  <span
id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652.md)

<span id="an_iv.vi-p52"></span>Some diagram, however, some set scheme,
the writer on introversion must have, if he is to describe with lucidity
the normal development of the contemplative consciousness: and so long
as the methodological nature of this diagram is kept in mind, there can
be little objection to the use of it. I propose then to examine under
three divisions that continuous and orderly growth, that gradual process
of change, by which the mystical consciousness matures, and develops its
apprehension of God. We will give to these three divisions names
familiar to all readers of ascetic literature: Recollection, Quiet, and
Contemplation. Each of these three parts of the introversive experience
may be discerned in embryo in that little experiment at which the reader
has been invited to assist: the act of concentration, the silence, the
new perception which results. Each has a characteristic beginning which
links it with its predecessor, and a characteristic end which shades off
into the next state. Thus Recollection commonly begins in Meditation and
develops into the “Orison of Inward Silence or Simplicity,” which again
melts into the true “Quiet.” “Quiet” as it becomes deeper passes into
Ordinary Contemplation: and this <span id="page_310">p. 310</span> <span
id="an_iv.vi-Page_310"></span> grows through Contemplation proper to
that Orison of Passive Union which is the highest of the non-ecstatic
introversive states. Merely to state the fact thus is to remind
ourselves how smoothly continuous is this life-process of the soul.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p53"></span>It is the object of contemplative prayer,
as it is the object of all education, to discipline and develop certain
growing faculties. Here, the faculties are those of the “transcendental
self,” the “new man”—all those powers which we associate with the
“spiritual consciousness.” The “Sons of God,” however, like the sons of
men, begin as babies; and their first lessons must not be too hard.
Therefore the educative process conforms to and takes advantage of every
step of the natural process of growth: as we, in the education of our
children, make the natural order in which their faculties develop the
basis of our scheme of cultivation. Recollection, Quiet, and
Contemplation, then, answer to the order in which the mystic’s powers
unfold. Roughly speaking, we shall find that the form of spiritual
attention which is called “Meditative” or “Recollective” goes side by
side with the Purification of the Self; that “Quiet” tends to be
characteristic of Illumination; that Contemplation proper—at any rate in
its higher forms—is most fully experienced by those who have attained,
or nearly attained, the Unitive Way. At the same time, just as the self
in its “first mystic life,” before it has passed through the dark night
of the spirit, often seems to run through the whole gamut of spiritual
states, and attain that immediate experience of the Absolute which it
seeks—though as a fact it has not reached those higher levels of
consciousness on which true and permanent union takes place—so too in
its orison. At any point in its growth it may experience for brief
periods that imageless and overpowering sense of identity with the
Absolute Life—that loving and exalted absorption in God—which is called
“passive union,” and anticipates the consciousness which is
characteristic of the unitive life. Over and over again in its
“prayerful process” it recapitulates in little the whole great process
of its life. It runs up for an instant to levels where it is not yet
strong enough to dwell: “seeks God in its ground” and finds that which
it seeks. Therefore we must not be too strict in our identification of
the grades of education with the stages of growth.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p54"></span>This education, rightly understood, is
one coherent process: it consists in a steady and voluntary surrender of
the awakened consciousness, its feeling, thought, and will, to the play
of those transcendental influences, that inflowing vitality, which it
conceives of as divine. In the preparative process of Recollection, the
unruly mind is brought into subjection. In “Quiet” the eager will is
silenced, the “wheel of imagination” is stilled. In Contemplation, <span
id="page_311">p. 311</span> <span id="an_iv.vi-Page_311"></span> the
heart at last comes to its own—<span id="an_iv.vi-p54.1"></span> *Cor ad
cor loquitur* . In their simplest forms, these three states involve the
deliberate concentration upon, the meek resting in, the joyous communing
with, the ineffable Object of man’s quest. They require a progressive
concentration of the mystic’s powers, a gradual handing over of the
reins from the surface intelligence to the deeper mind; that essential
self which alone is capable of God. In Recollection the surface-mind
still holds, so to speak, the leading strings: but in “Quiet” it
surrenders them wholly, allowing consciousness to sink into that
“blissful silence in which God works and speaks.” This act of surrender,
this deliberate negation of thought, is an essential preliminary of the
contemplative state. “Lovers put out the candles and draw the curtains
when they wish to see the god and the goddess; and in the higher
communion the night of thought is the light of perception.”  <span
id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653.md)

<span id="an_iv.vi-p56"></span>The education of the self in the
successive degrees of orison has been compared by St. Teresa, in a
celebrated passage in her Life, to four ways of watering the garden of
the soul so that it may bring forth its flowers and fruits.  <span
id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654.md) The first and most primitive of these
ways is meditation. This, she says, is like drawing water by hand from a
deep well: the slowest and most laborious of all means of irrigation.
Next to this is the orison of quiet, which is a little better and
easier: for here soul seems to receive some help, *i.e.* , with the
stilling of the senses the subliminal faculties are brought into play.
The well has now been fitted with a windlass—that little Moorish
water-wheel possessed by every Castilian farm. Hence we get more water
for the energy we expend: more sense of reality in exchange for our
abstraction from the unreal. Also “the water is higher, and accordingly
the labour is much less than it was when the water had to be drawn out
of the depths of the well. I mean that the water is nearer to it, for
grace now reveals itself more distinctly to the soul.” In the third
stage, or orison of union, we leave all voluntary activities of the
mind: the gardener no longer depends on his own exertions, contact
between subject and object is established, there is no more stress and
strain. It is as if a little river now ran through our garden and
watered it. We have but to direct the stream. In the fourth and highest
stage, God Himself waters our garden with rain from heaven “drop by
drop.” The attitude of the self is now that of perfect receptivity,
“passive contemplation,” loving trust. Individual activity is sunk in
the “great life of the All.”  <span id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655.md)

<span id="an_iv.vi-p59"></span>The measure of the mystic’s real progress
is and must always <span id="page_312">p. 312</span> <span
id="an_iv.vi-Page_312"></span> be his progress in love; for his
apprehension is an apprehension of the heart. His education, his
watering of the garden of the soul, is a cultivation of this one
flower—this Rosa Mystica which has its root in God. His advance in
contemplation, then, will be accompanied step by step by those exalted
feeling-states which Richard of St. Victor called the Degrees of Ardent
Love. Without their presence, all the drill in the world will not bring
him to the time contemplative state; though it may easily produce
abnormal powers of perception of the kind familiar to students of the
occult.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p60"></span>Thus our theory of mystic education is in
close accord with our theory of mystic life. In both, there is a
progressive surrender of selfhood under the steady advance of conquering
love; a stilling of that “I, Me, and Mine,” which is linked by all the
senses, and by all its own desires, to the busy world of visible things.
This progressive surrender usually appears in the practice of orison as
a progressive inward retreat from circumference to centre, to that
ground of the soul, that substantial *somewhat* in man, deep buried for
most of us beneath the great rubbish heap of our surface-interests,
where human life and divine life meet. To clear away the rubbish-heap so
that he may get down to this treasure-house is from one point of view
the initial task of the contemplative. This clearing away is the first
part of “introversion”: that journey inwards to his own centre where,
stripped of all his cleverness and merit, reduced to his “nothingness,”
he can “meet God without intermediary.” This ground of the soul, this
strange inward sanctuary to which the normal man so seldom penetrates,
is, says Eckhart, “immediately receptive of the Divine Being,” and “no
one can move it but God alone.”  <span id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656.md)
There the finite self encounters the Infinite; and, by a close and
loving communion with and feeding on the attributes of the Divine
Substance, is remade in the interests of the Absolute Life. This
encounter, the consummation of mystical culture, is what we mean by
contemplation in its highest form. Here we are on the verge of that
great self-merging act which is of the essence of pure love: which
Reality has sought of us, and we have unknowingly desired of It. Here
contemplation and union are one. “Thus do we grow,” says Ruysbroeck,
“and, carried above ourselves, above reason, into the very heart of
love, there do we feed according to the spirit; and taking flight for
the Godhead by naked love, we go to the encounter of the Bridegroom, to
the encounter of His Spirit, which is His love; and thus we are brought
forth by God, out of <span id="page_313">p. 313</span> <span
id="an_iv.vi-Page_313"></span> our selfhood, into the immersion of love,
in which we possess blessedness and are one with God.”  <span
id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657.md)

#### <span id="an_iv.vi-p62.1"></span>Recollection

<span id="an_iv.vi-p63"></span>The beginning of the process of
introversion, the first deliberate act in which the self turns towards
the inward path, will not merely be the yielding to an instinct, the
indulgence of a natural taste for reverie; it will be a voluntary and
purposeful undertaking. Like conversion, it entails a break with the
obvious, which must, of necessity, involve and affect the whole normal
consciousness. It will be evoked by the mystic’s love, and directed by
his reason; but can only be accomplished by the strenuous exercise of
his will. These preparatory labours of the contemplative life—these
first steps upon the ladder—are, says St. Teresa, very hard, and require
greater courage than all the rest.  <span
id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658.md) All the scattered interests of the
self have here to be collected; there must be a deliberate and unnatural
act of attention, a deliberate expelling of all discordant images from
the consciousness a hard and ungrateful task. Since the transcendental
faculties are still young and weak, the senses not wholly mortified, it
needs a stern determination, a “wilful choice,” if we are to succeed in
concentrating our attention upon the whispered messages from within,
undistracted by the loud voices which besiege us from without.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p65"></span>“How,” says the Disciple to the Master in
one of Boehme’s “Dialogues,” “am I to seek in the Centre this Fountain
of Light which may enlighten me throughout and bring my properties into
perfect harmony? I am in Nature, as I said before, and which way shall I
pass through Nature and the light thereof, so that I may come into the
supernatural and supersensual ground whence this true Light, which is
the Light of Minds, doth arise; and this without the destruction of my
nature, or quenching the Light of it, which is my reason?

<span id="an_iv.vi-p66"></span> *“Master.* Cease but from thine own
activity, steadfastly fixing thine Eye upon *one Point. . . .* For this
end, gather in all thy thoughts, and by faith press into the Centre,
laying hold upon the Word of God, which is infallible and which hath
called thee. Be thou obedient to this call, and be silent before the
Lord, sitting alone with Him in thy inmost and most hidden cell, thy
mind being centrally united in itself, and attending His Will in the
patience of hope. So shall thy Light break forth as the morning, and
after the redness thereof is passed, the Sun himself, which thou waitest
for, shall arise unto thee, and under his most healing wings thou shalt
greatly rejoice: ascending and descending in <span id="page_314">p.
314</span> <span id="an_iv.vi-Page_314"></span> his bright and
health-giving beams. Behold, this is the true Supersensual Ground of
Life.”  <span id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659.md)

<span id="an_iv.vi-p68"></span>In this short paragraph Boehme has caught
and described the psychological state in which all introversion must
begin: the primary simplification of consciousness, steadfastly fixing
the soul’s eye upon *one point,* and the turning inwards of the whole
conative powers for a purpose rather believed in than known, “by faith
pressing into the centre.”

<span id="an_iv.vi-p69"></span>The unfortunate word *Recollection,*
which the hasty reader is apt to connect with remembrance, is the
traditional term by which mystical writers define just such a voluntary
concentration, such a first collecting or gathering in of the attention
of the self to its “most hidden cell.” That self is as yet unacquainted
with the strange plane of silence which so soon becomes familiar to
those who attempt even the lowest activities of the contemplative life,
where the self is released from succession, the noises of the world are
never heard, and the great adventures of the spirit take place. It
stands here between the two planes of its being; the Eye of Time is
still awake. It knows that it wants to enter the inner world, that
“interior palace where the King of Kings is guest”:  <span
id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660.md) but it must find some device to help
it over the threshold—rather, in the language of psychology, to shift
that threshold and permit its subliminal intuition of the Absolute to
emerge.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p71"></span>This device is as a rule the practice of
meditation, in which the state of Recollection usually begins: that is
to say, the deliberate consideration of and dwelling upon some one
aspect of Reality—an aspect most usually chosen from amongst the
religious beliefs of the self. Thus Hindu mystics will brood upon a
sacred word, whilst Christian contemplatives set before their minds one
of the names or attributes of God, a fragment of Scripture, an incident
of the life of Christ; and allow—indeed encourage—this consideration and
the ideas and feelings which flow from it, to occupy the whole mental
field. This powerful suggestion, kept before the consciousness by an act
of will, overpowers the stream of small suggestions which the outer
world pours incessantly upon the mind. The self, concentrated upon this
image or idea, dwelling on it more than thinking about it—as one may
gaze upon a picture that one loves—falls gradually and insensibly into
the condition of reverie; and, protected by this holy day-dream from the
more distracting dream of life, sinks into itself, and becomes in the
language of asceticism “recollected” or gathered together. Although it
is deliberately ignoring the whole of its usual “external universe,” its
faculties are wide awake: all have had their part in <span
id="page_315">p. 315</span> <span id="an_iv.vi-Page_315"></span> the
wilful production of this state of consciousness: and this it is which
marks off meditation and recollection from the higher or “infused”
degrees of orison.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p72"></span>Such meditation as this, says Richard of
St. Victor, is the activity proper to one who has attained the first
degree of ardent love. By it, “God enters into the mind,” and “the mind
also enters into itself”; and thus receives in its inmost cell the
“first visit of the Beloved.” It is a kind of half-way house between the
perception of Appearance and the perception of Reality. To one in whom
this state is established consciousness seems like a blank field, save
for the “one point” in its centre, the subject of the meditation.
Towards this focus the introversive self seems to press inwards from
every side; still faintly conscious of the buzz of the external world
outside its ramparts, but refusing to respond to its appeals. Presently
the subject of meditation begins to take on a new significance; to glow
with life and light. The contemplative suddenly feels that he knows it;
in the complete, vital, but indescribable way in which one knows a
friend. More, through it hints are coming to him of mightier, nameless
things. It ceases to be a picture, and becomes a window through which
the mystic peers out into the spiritual universe, and apprehends to some
extent—though how, he knows not—the veritable presence of God.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p73"></span>In these meditative and recollective
states, the self still feels very clearly the edge of its own
personality: its separateness from the Somewhat Other, the divine
reality set over against the soul. It is aware of that reality: the
subject of its meditation becomes a symbol through which it receives a
distinct message from the transcendental world. But it is still
operating in a natural way—as mystical writers would say, “by means of
the faculties.” There is yet no conscious fusion with a greater Life; no
resting in the divine atmosphere, as in the “Quiet”; no involuntary and
ecstatic lifting up of the soul to direct apprehension of truth, as in
contemplation. Recollection is a definite psychic condition, which has
logical psychic results. Originally induced by meditation, or absorbed
brooding upon certain aspects of the Real, it develops in the Self, by
way of the strenuous control exercised by the will over the
understanding, a power of cutting its connection with the external
world, and retreating to the inner world of the spirit.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p74"></span>“True recollection,” says St. Teresa,
“has characteristics by which it can be easily recognized. It produces a
certain effect which I do not know how to explain, but which is well
understood by those who have experienced it. . . . It is true that
recollection has several degrees, and that in the beginning these great
effects <span id="page_316">p. 316</span> <span
id="an_iv.vi-Page_316"></span> are not felt, because it is not yet
profound enough. But support the pain which you first feel in
recollecting yourself, despise the rebellion of nature, overcome the
resistance of the body, which loves a liberty which is its ruin, learn
self-conquest, persevere thus for a time, and you will perceive very
clearly the advantages which you gain from it. As soon as you apply
yourself to orison, you will at once feel your senses gather themselves
together: they seem like bees which return to the hive and there shut
themselves up to work at the making of honey: and this will take place
without effort or care on your part. God thus rewards the violence which
your soul has been doing to itself; and gives to it such a domination
over the senses that a sign is enough when it desires to recollect
itself, for them to obey and so gather themselves together. At the first
call of the will, they come back more and more quickly. At last, after
countless exercises of this kind, God disposes them to a state of utter
rest and of perfect contemplation.”  <span
id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md)

<span id="an_iv.vi-p76"></span>This description makes it clear that
“recollection” is a form of spiritual gymnastics; less valuable for
itself than for the training which it gives, the powers which it
develops. In it, says St. Teresa again, the soul enters with its God
into that Paradise which is within itself, and shuts the door behind it
upon all the things of the world. “You should know, my daughters,” she
continues, “that this is no supernatural act, but depends upon our will,
and that therefore we can do it with that ordinary assistance of God
which we need for all our acts and even for our good thoughts. For here
we are not concerned with the silence of the faculties, but with a
simple retreat of these powers into the ground of the soul. There are
various ways of arriving at it, and these ways are described in
different books. There it is said that we must abstract the mind from
exterior things, in order that we may inwardly approach God: that even
in our work we ought to retire within ourselves, though it be only for a
moment: that this remembrance of a God who companions us within, is a
great help to us; finally, that we ought little by little to habituate
ourselves to gentle and silent converse with Him, so that He may make us
feel His presence in the soul.”  <span id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md)

#### <span id="an_iv.vi-p77.1"></span>Quiet

<span id="an_iv.vi-p78"></span>More important for us, because more
characteristically mystical, is the next great stage of orison: that
curious and extremely definite mental state which mystics call the
Prayer of Quiet or Simplicity, or sometimes the Interior Silence. This
represents <span id="page_317">p. 317</span> <span
id="an_iv.vi-Page_317"></span> the result for consciousness of a further
degree of that inward retreat which Recollection began.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p79"></span>Out of the deep, slow brooding and
pondering on some mystery, some incomprehensible link between himself
and the Real, or the deliberate practice of loving attention to God, the
contemplative—perhaps by way of a series of moods and acts which his
analytic powers may cause him “nicely to distinguish”—glides, almost
insensibly, on to a plane of perception for which human speech has few
equivalents. It is a plane which is apparently characterized by an
immense increase in the receptivity of the self and by an almost
complete suspension of the reflective powers. The strange silence which
is the outstanding quality of this state—almost the only note in regard
to it which the surface-intelligence can secure—is not describable.
Here, as Samuel Rutherford said of another of life’s secrets, *“Come and
see* willtell you much: *come nearer* will say more.” Here the self
passes beyond the stage at which its perceptions are capable of being
dealt with by thought. It can no longer “take notes”: can only surrender
itself to the stream of an inflowing life, and to the direction of a
larger will. Discursive thought would only interfere with this process:
as it interferes with the vital processes of the body if it once gets
them under its control. That thought, then, already disciplined by
Recollection, gathered up, and forced to work in the interests of the
transcendental mind, is now to be entirely inhibited.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p80"></span>As Recollection becomes deeper, the self
slides into a certain dim yet vivid consciousness of the Infinite. The
door tight shut on the sensual world, it becomes aware that it is
immersed in a more real world which it cannot define. It rests quietly
in this awareness: quite silent, utterly at peace. In the place of the
struggles for complete concentration which mark the beginning of
Recollection, there is now “a living, somehow self-acting
recollection—with God, His peace, power, and presence, right in the
midst of this rose of spiritual fragrance.”  <span
id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md) With this surrender to something
bigger, as with the surrender of conversion, comes an immense relief of
strain. This is “Quiet” in its most perfect form: this sinking, as it
were, of the little child of the Infinite into its Father’s arms. The
giving up of I-hood, the process of self-stripping, which we have seen
to be the essence of the purification of the self, finds its parallel in
this phase of the contemplative experience. Here, in this complete
cessation of man’s proud effort to do somewhat of himself, Humility, who
rules the Fourth Degree of Love, begins to be known in her paradoxical
beauty and power. Consciousness loses to find, and dies that it may
live. No longer, in Rolle’s pungent phrase, is it a “Raunsaker of the
myghte <span id="page_318">p. 318</span> <span
id="an_iv.vi-Page_318"></span> of Godd and of His Majeste.”  <span
id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664.md) Thus the act by which it passes into
the Quiet is a sacrament of the whole mystic quest: of the turning from
doing to being, the abolition of separateness in the interests of the
Absolute Life.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p83"></span>The state of “Quiet,” we have said,
entails suspension of the surface-consciousness: yet consciousness of
the subject’s personality remains. It follows, generally, on a period of
deliberate and loving recollection, of a slow and steady withdrawal of
the attention from the channels of sense. To one who is entering this
state, the external world seems to get further and further away: till at
last nothing but the paramount fact of his own existence remains. So
startling, very often, is the deprivation of all his accustomed mental
furniture, of the noise and flashing of the transmitting instruments of
sense, that the negative aspect of his condition dominates
consciousness; and he can but describe it as a nothingness, a pure
passivity, an emptiness, a “naked” orison. He is there, as it were
poised, resting, waiting, he does not know for what: only he is
conscious that all, even in this utter emptiness, is well. Presently,
however, he becomes aware that *Something* fills this emptiness;
something omnipresent, intangible, like sunny air. Ceasing to attend to
the messages from without, he begins to notice That which has always
been within. His whole being is thrown open to its influence: it
permeates his consciousness.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p84"></span>There are, then, two aspects of the
Orison of Quiet: the aspect of deprivation, of emptiness which begins
it, and the aspect of acquisition, of something found, in which it is
complete. In its description, all mystics will be found to lean to one
side or the other, to the affirmative or negative element which it
contains. The austere mysticism of Eckhart and his followers, their
temperamental sympathy with the Neoplatonic language of Dionysius the
Areopagite, caused them to describe it and also very often the higher
state of contemplation to which it leads—as above all things an
emptiness, a divine dark, an ecstatic deprivation. They will not profane
its deep satisfactions by the inadequate terms proper to earthly peace
and joy: and, true to their school, fall back on the paradoxically
suggestive powers of negation. To St. Teresa, and mystics of her type,
on the other hand, even a little and inadequate image of its joy seems
better than none. To them it is a sweet calm, a gentle silence, in which
the lover apprehends the presence of the Beloved: a God-given state over
which the self has little control.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p85"></span>In Eckhart’s writings enthusiastic
descriptions of the Quiet, of inward silence and passivity as the fruit
of a deliberate recollection, abound. In his view, the psychical state
of Quiet is preeminently <span id="page_319">p. 319</span> <span
id="an_iv.vi-Page_319"></span> that in which the soul of man begins to
be united with its “ground,” Pure Being. It marks the transition from
“natural” to “supernatural” prayer. The emptying of the field of
consciousness, its cleansing of all images—even of those symbols of
Reality which are the objects of meditation—is the necessary condition
under which alone this encounter can take place.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p86"></span>“The soul,” he says, “with all its
powers, has divided and scattered itself in outward things, each
according to its functions: the power of sight in the eye, the power of
hearing in the ear, the power of taste in the tongue, and thus they are
the less able to work inwardly, for every power which is divided is
imperfect. So the soul, if she would work inwardly, must call home all
her powers and collect them from all divided things to one inward work.
. . . If a man will work an inward work, he must pour all his powers
into himself as into a corner of the soul, and must hide himself from
all images and forms, and then he can work. Then he must come into a
forgetting and a not-knowing. He must be in a stillness and silence,
where the Word may be heard. One cannot draw near to this Word better
than by stillness and silence: then it is heard and understood in utter
ignorance. When one knows nothing, it is opened and revealed. Then we
shall become aware of the Divine Ignorance, and our ignorance will be
ennobled and adorned with supernatural knowledge. And when we simply
keep ourselves receptive, we are more perfect than when at work.”  <span
id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665.md)

<span id="an_iv.vi-p88"></span>The psychic state of Quiet has a further
value for the mystic, as being the intellectual complement and
expression of the moral state of humility and receptivity: the very
condition, says Eckhart, of the New Birth. “It may be asked whether this
Birth is best accomplished in Man when he does the work and *forms and
thinks himself into God,* or when he keeps himself in Silence, stillness
and peace, so that God may speak and work in him; . . . the best and
noblest way in which thou mayst come into this work and life is by
keeping silence, and letting God work and speak. When all the powers are
withdrawn from their work and images, there is this word spoken.”  <span
id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666.md)

<span id="an_iv.vi-p90"></span>Eckhart’s view of the primary importance
of “Quiet” as essentially the introverted state is shared by all those
mediaeval mystics who lay stress on the psychological rather than the
objective aspect of the spiritual life. They regard it as the necessary
preliminary of all contemplation; and describe it as a normal phase of
the inner experience, possible of attainment by all those who have
sufficiently disciplined themselves in patience, recollection, and
humility.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p91"></span>In an old English mystical tract by the
author of “The Cloud <span id="page_320">p. 320</span> <span
id="an_iv.vi-Page_320"></span> of Unknowing” there is a curious and
detailed instruction on the disposition of mind proper to this orison of
silence. It clearly owes much to the teaching of the Areopagite, and
something surely—if we may judge by its vivid and exact instructions—to
personal experience. “When thou comest by thyself,” says the master to
the disciple for whom this “pystle” was composed, “think not before what
thou shalt do after: but forsake as well good thoughts as evil thoughts,
and pray not with thy mouth, but lift thee right well. . . . And look
that nothing live in thy working mind but a naked intent stretching unto
God, not clothed in any special thought of God in thyself, how He is in
Himself or in any of His works, but only that He is as He is. Let Him be
so, I pray thee, and make Him on none otherwise speech, nor search in
Him by subtilty of wit: but *believe by thy ground.* This naked intent
freely fastened and grounded by very belief, shall be nought else to thy
thought and thy feeling but a naked thought and a blind feeling of thine
own being. . . . That darkness be thy mirror and thy mind whole. Think
no further of thyself than I bid thee do of thy God, so that thou be
oned with Him in spirit as in thought, without departing and scattering,
for He is thy being and in Him thou art that thou art: not only by cause
and by being, but also He is in thee both thy cause and thy being. And
therefore think on God as in this work as thou dost on thyself, and on
thyself as thou dost on God, that He is as He is, and thou art as thou
art, and that thy thought be not scattered nor departed but privied in
Him that is All.”  <span id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667.md)

<span id="an_iv.vi-p93"></span>“Let Him be so, I pray thee!” It is an
admonition against spiritual worry, an entreaty to the individual,
already at work twisting experience to meet his own conceptions, to let
things be as they are, to receive and be content. Leave off doing, that
you may be. Leave off analysis, that you may know. “That meek darkness
be thy mirror”—humble receptivity is the watchword of this state. “In
this,” says Eckhart finely, “the soul is of equal capacity with God. As
God is boundless in giving, so the soul is boundless in receiving. And
as God is almighty in His work, se the soul is an abyss of receptivity:
and so she is formed anew with God and in God. . . . The disciples of
St. Dionysius asked him why Timotheus surpassed them all in perfection.
Then said Dionysius, ‘Timotheus is receptive of God.’ And thus thine
ignorance is not a defect but thy highest perfection, and thine
inactivity thy highest work. And so in this work thou must bring all thy
works to nought and all thy powers into silence, if thou wilt in truth
experience this birth within thyself.”  <span
id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668.md) <span id="page_321">p. 321</span>
<span id="an_iv.vi-Page_321"></span>

<span id="an_iv.vi-p95"></span>It is interesting to contrast these
descriptions of the Quiet with St. Teresa’s subjective account of the
same psychological state. Where the English mystic’s teaching is full of
an implied appeal to the will, the Spanish saint is all for the
involuntary, or, as she would call it, the “supernatural” actions of the
soul. “This true orison of quiet,” she says, “has in it an element of
the supernatural. We cannot, in spite of all our efforts, procure it for
ourselves. It is a sort of peace in which the soul establishes herself,
or rather in which God establishes the soul, as He did the righteous
Simeon. All her powers are at rest. She understands, but otherwise than
by the senses, that she is already near her God, and that if she draws a
little nearer, she will become by union one with Him. She does not see
this with the eyes of the body, nor with the eyes of the soul. . . . It
is like the repose of a traveller who, within sight of the goal stops to
take breath, and then continues with new strength upon his way. One
feels a great bodily comfort, a great satisfaction of soul: such is the
happiness of the soul in seeing herself close to the spring, that even
without drinking of the waters she finds herself refreshed. It seems to
her that she wants nothing more: the faculties which are at rest would
like always to remain still, for the least of their movements is able to
trouble or prevent her love. Those who are in this orison wish their
bodies to remain motionless, for it seems to them that at the least
movement they will lose this sweet peace . . . they are in the palace
close to their King, and they see that He begins to give them His
kingdom. It seems to them that they are no longer in the world, and they
wish neither to hear nor to see it, but only God. . . . There is this
difference between the orison of quiet and that in which the whole soul
is united to God; that in this last the soul has not to absorb the
Divine Food. God deposits it with her, she knows not how. The orison of
quiet, on the other hand, demands, it seems to me, a slight effort; but
it is accompanied by so much sweetness that one hardly feels it.”  <span
id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669.md)

<span id="an_iv.vi-p97"></span>“A slight effort,” says St. Teresa. “A
naked intent stretching,” says the “Pystle of Private Counsel.” These
words mark the frontier between the true and healthy mystic state of
“Quiet” and its morbid perversion in “Quietism”: the difference between
the tense stillness of the athlete and the limp passivity of the
sluggard, who is really lazy, though he looks resigned. True “Quiet” is
a means, not an end: is actively embraced, not passively endured. It is
a phase in the self’s growth in contemplation; a bridge which leads from
its old and uncoordinated life of activity to its new unified life of
deep action—the real “mystic life” of man. This <span id="page_322">p.
322</span> <span id="an_iv.vi-Page_322"></span> state is desired by the
mystic, not in order that consciousness may remain a blank, but in order
that the “Word which is Alive” may be written thereon. Too often,
however, this fact has been ignored; and the Interior Silence has been
put by wayward transcendentalists to other and less admirable use.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p98"></span>“Quiet” is the danger-zone of
introversion. Of all forms of mystical activity, perhaps this has been
the most abused, the least understood. Its theory, seized upon, divorced
from its context, and developed to excess, produced the foolish and
dangerous exaggerations of Quietism: and these, in their turn, caused a
wholesale condemnation of the principle of passivity, and made many
superficial persons regard “naked orison” as an essentially heretical
act.  <span id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670.md) The accusation of Quietism
has been hurled at mystics whose only fault was a looseness of language
which laid them open to misapprehension. Others, however, have certainly
contrived, by a perversion and isolation of the teachings of great
contemplatives on this point, to justify the deliberate production of a
half-hypnotic state of passivity. With this meaningless state of
“absorption in nothing at all” they were content; claiming that in it
they were in touch with the divine life, and therefore exempt from the
usual duties and limitations of human existence. “Quietism,” usually,
and rather unfairly, regarded as the special folly of Madame Guyon and
her disciples, already existed in a far more dangerous form in the
Middle Ages: and was described and denounced by Ruysbroeck, one of the
greatest masters of true introversion whom the Christian world has
known.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p100"></span>“Such quietude,” he says, “is nought
else but idleness, into which a man has fallen, and in which he forgets
himself and God and all things in all that has to do with activity. This
repose is wholly contrary to the supernatural repose one possesses in
God; for that is a loving self-mergence and simple gazing at the
Incomprehensible Brightness; actively sought with inward desire, and
found in fruitive inclination. . . . When a man possesses this rest in
false idleness, and all loving adherence seems a hindrance to him, he
clings to himself in his quietude and lives contrary to the first way in
which man is united with God; and this is the beginning of all ghostly
error.”  <span id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671.md)

<span id="an_iv.vi-p102"></span>There can be no doubt that for selves of
a certain psychical constitution, such a “false idleness” is only too
easy of attainment. They can by wilful self-suggestion deliberately
produce this emptiness, this inward silence, and luxuriate in its
peaceful effects. To do this from self-regarding motives, or to do it to
excess—to let <span id="page_323">p. 323</span> <span
id="an_iv.vi-Page_323"></span> “peaceful enjoyment” swamp “active
love”—is a mystical vice: and this perversion of the spiritual
faculties, like perversion of the natural faculties, brings degeneration
in its train. It leads to the absurdities of “holy indifference,” and
ends in the complete stultification of the mental and moral life. The
true mystic never tries deliberately to enter the orison of quiet: with
St. Teresa, he regards it as a supernatural gift, beyond his control,
though fed by his will and love. That is to say, where it exists in a
healthy form, it appears spontaneously, as a phase in normal
development; not as a self-induced condition, a psychic trick.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p103"></span>The balance to be struck in this stage
of introversion can only be expressed, it seems, in paradox. The true
condition of quiet according to the great mystics, is at once active and
passive: it is pure surrender, but a surrender which is not limp
self-abandonment, but rather the free and constantly renewed self-giving
and self-emptying of a burning love. The departmental intellect is
silenced, but the totality of character is flung open to the influence
of the Real. Personality is not lost: only its hard edge is gone. A
“rest most busy,” says Hilton. Like the soaring of an eagle, says
Augustine Baker, when “the flight is continued for a good space with a
great swiftness, but withal with great stillness, quietness and ease,
without any waving of the wings at all, or the least force used in any
member, being in as much ease and stillness as if she were reposing in
her nest.”  <span id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672.md)

<span id="an_iv.vi-p105"></span>“According to the unanimous teaching of
the most experienced and explicit of the specifically Theistic and
Christian mystics,” says Von Hügel, “the appearance, the soul’s own
impression, of a cessation of life and energy of the soul in periods of
special union with God, or of great advance in spirituality, is an
appearance only. Indeed this, at such times strong, impression of rest
springs most certainly from an unusually large amount of actualized
energy, an energy which is now penetrating, and finding expression by
ever pore and fibre of the soul. The whole moral and spiritual creature
expands and rests, yes; but this very rest is produced by Action,
‘unperceived because so fleet, so near, so all-fulfilling.’”  <span
id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673.md)

<span id="an_iv.vi-p107"></span>The great teachers of Quietism, having
arrived at and experienced the psychological state of “quiet”: having
known the ineffable peace and certainty, the bliss which follows on its
act of complete surrender, its utter and speechless resting in the
Absolute Life, believed themselves to have discovered in this halfway
house the goal of the mystic quest. Therefore, whilst much of their
teaching remains true, as a real description of a real and valid state
experienced by almost all contemplatives in the course <span
id="page_324">p. 324</span> <span id="an_iv.vi-Page_324"></span> of
their development, the inference which they drew from it, that in this
mere blank abiding in the deeps the soul had reached the end of her
course, was untrue and bad for life.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p108"></span>Thus Molinos gives in the “Spiritual
Guide” many unexceptional maxims upon Interior Silence: “By not speaking
nor desiring, and not thinking,” he says justly enough of the
contemplative spirit, “she arrives at the true and perfect mystical
silence wherein God speaks with the soul, communicates Himself to it,
and in the abyss of its own depth teaches it the most perfect and
exalted wisdom. He calls and guides it to this inward solitude and
mystical silence, when He says that He will speak to it alone in the
most secret and hidden part of the heart.” Here Molinos speaks the
language of all mystics, yet the total result of his teaching was to
suggest to the ordinary mind that there was a peculiar virtue in doing
nothing at all, and that all deliberate spiritual activities were bad.
 <span id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674.md)

<span id="an_iv.vi-p110"></span>Much of the teaching of modern
“mystical” cults is thus crudely quietistic. It insists on the necessity
of “going into the silence,” and even, with a strange temerity, gives
preparatory lessons in subconscious meditation: a proceeding which might
well provoke the laughter of the saints. The faithful, being gathered
together, are taught by simple exercises in recollection the way to
attain the “Quiet.” By this mental trick the modern transcendentalist
naturally attains to a state of vacant placidity, in which he rests: and
“remaining in a distracted idleness and misspending the time in
expectation of extraordinary visits,” believes—with a faith which many
of the orthodox might envy—that he is here “united with his Principle.”
But, though the psychological state which contemplatives call the prayer
of quiet is a common condition of mystical attainment, it is not by
itself mystical at all. It is a state of preparation: a way of opening
the door. That which comes in when the door is opened will be that which
we truly and passionately desire. The will makes plain the way: the
heart—the whole man—conditions the guest. The true contemplative, coming
to this plane of utter stillness, does not desire “extraordinary favours
and visitations,” but the privilege of breathing for a little while the
atmosphere of Love. He is about that which St. Bernard called “the
business of all businesses”: goes, in perfect simplicity, to the
encounter of Perfection, not to the development of himself.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p111"></span>So, even at this apparently “passive”
stage of his progress, the mystic’s operations are found on analysis to
have a dynamic and purposive character: his very repose is the result of
stress. He is a pilgrim that still seeks his country. Urged by his
innate tendency to transcendence, he is on his way to higher levels,
more <span id="page_325">p. 325</span> <span
id="an_iv.vi-Page_325"></span> sublime fulfilments, greater self-giving
acts. Though he may have forsaken all superficial activity, deep, urgent
action still remains. “The possession of God,” says Ruysbroeck, “demands
and supposes active love. He who thinks or feels otherwise is deceived.
All our life as it is in God is immersed in blessedness: all our life as
it is in ourselves is immersed in active love. And though we live wholly
in ourselves and wholly in God, it is but one life, but it is twofold
and opposite according to our feeling—rich and poor hungry and
fulfilled, active and quiet.”  <span id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675.md)
The essential difference between this true “active” Quiet and Quietism
of all kinds has been admirably expressed by Baron von Hügel. “Quietism,
the doctrine of the One Act; passivity in a literal sense, as the
absence or imperfection of the power or use of initiative on the soul’s
part, in any and every state; these doctrines were finally condemned,
and most rightly and necessarily condemned, the Prayer of Quiet and the
various states and degrees of an ever-increasing predominance of Action
over Activity—an action which is all the more the soul’s very own,
because the more occasioned, directed and informed by God’s action and
stimulation—these and the other chief lines of the ancient experience
and practice remain as true, correct, and necessary as ever.”  <span
id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md)

<span id="an_iv.vi-p114"></span>The “ever-increasing predominance of
Action over Activity”—the deep and vital movement of the whole self, too
utterly absorbed for self-consciousness, set over against its fussy
surface-energies—here is the true ideal of orison. This must inform all
the soul’s aspiration towards union with the absolute Life and Love
which waits at the door. It is an ideal which includes Quiet, as surely
as it excludes Quietism.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p115"></span>As for that doctrine of the One Act here
mentioned, which was preached by the more extreme quietists; it, like
all else in this movement, was the perversion of a great mystical truth.
It taught that the turning of the soul towards Reality, the merging of
the will in God, which is the very heart of the mystic life, was *One
Act,* never to be repeated. This done, the self had nothing more to do
but to rest in the Divine Life, be its unresisting instrument. Pure
passivity and indifference were its ideal. All activity was forbidden
it, all choice was a negation of its surrender, all striving was
unnecessary and wrong. It needed only to rest for evermore and “let God
work and speak in the silence.” This doctrine is so utterly at variance
with all that we know of the laws of life and growth, that it hardly
seems to stand in need of condemnation. Such a state of
indifference—which the quietists strove in vain to identify with that
state of Pure Love which “seeketh not its own” <span id="page_326">p.
326</span> <span id="an_iv.vi-Page_326"></span> in spiritual
things—cannot coexist with any of those “degrees of ardent charity”
through which man’s spirit must pass on its journey to the One: and this
alone is enough to prove its non-mystical character.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p116"></span>It is only fair to Madame Guyon to say
that she cannot justly be charged with preaching this exaggeration of
passivity, though a loose and fluid style has allowed many unfortunate
inferences to be drawn from her works. “Some persons,” she says, “when
they hear of the prayer of quiet, falsely imagine that the soul remains
stupid, dead, and inactive. But unquestionably it acteth therein, more
nobly and more extensively than it had ever done before, for God Himself
is the Mover and the soul now acteth by the agency of His Spirit. . . .
Instead, then, of promoting idleness we promote the highest activity, by
inculcating a total dependence on the Spirit of God as our moving
principle, for in Him we live and move and have our being. . . . Our
activity should therefore consist in endeavouring to acquire and
maintain such a state as may be most susceptible of divine impressions,
most flexile to all the operations of the Eternal Word. Whilst a tablet
is unsteady, the painter is unable to delineate a true copy: so every
act of our own selfish and proper spirit is productive of false and
erroneous lineaments, it interrupts the work and defeats the design of
this Adorable Artist.”  <span id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md)

<span id="an_iv.vi-p118"></span>The true mystics, in whom the Orison of
Quiet develops to this state of receptivity, seldom use in describing it
the language of “holy indifference.” Their love and enthusiasm will not
let them do that. It is true, of course, that they are indifferent to
all else save the supreme claims of love: but then, it is of love that
they speak. <span id="an_iv.vi-p118.1"></span> *Ego dormio et cor meum
vigilat* . “This,” says St. Teresa, “is a sleep of the powers of the
soul, which are not wholly lost, nor yet understanding how they are at
work. . . . To me it seems to be nothing else than a death, as it were,
to all the things of this world, and a fruition of God. I know of no
other words whereby to describe it or explain it; neither does the soul
then know what to do—for it knows not whether to speak or be silent,
whether it should laugh or weep. It is a glorious folly, a heavenly
madness wherein true wisdom is acquired; and to the soul a kind of
fruition most full of delight. . . . The faculties of the soul now
retain only the power of occupying themselves wholly with God; not one
of them ventures to stir, neither can we move one of them without making
great efforts to distract ourselves—and, indeed, I do not think we can
do it at all at this time.”  <span id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678.md)
<span id="page_327">p. 327</span> <span id="an_iv.vi-Page_327"></span>

<span id="an_iv.vi-p120"></span>Here, then, we see the Orison of Silence
melting into true contemplation: its stillness is ruffled by its joy.
The Quiet reveals itself as an essentially transitional state,
introducing the self into a new sphere of activity.

<span id="an_iv.vi-p121"></span>The second degree of ardent love, says
Richard of St. Victor, *binds* , sothat the soul which is possessed by
it is unable to think of anything else: it is not only “insuperable,”
but also “inseparable.”  <span id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679.md) He
compares it to the soul’s bridal; the irrevocable act, by which
permanent union is initiated. The feeling-state which is the equivalent
of the Quiet is just such a passive and joyous yielding-up of the virgin
soul to its Bridegroom; a silent marriage-vow. It is ready for all that
may happen to it, all that may be asked of it—to give itself and lose
itself, to wait upon the pleasure of its Love. From this inward
surrender the self emerges to the new life, the new knowledge which is
mediated to it under the innumerable forms of Contemplation.

having for object the *causa altissima* from which all else depends,
knows the place and value of art, and understands the artist. The artist
as such, cannot judge the contemplative, but he can divine his

chain his heart to dulness, going over to the side of the contemplative
he will recognize Love and Beauty” (J. Maritain, “Art et Scholastique,”

absoluteness, expressed under a multitude of different symbols, is the

careful to steer clear of this danger.
