### IX. The Dark Night of the Soul

<span id="an_iv.ix"></span>

<span id="an_iv.ix-p1"></span>We<span id="an_iv.ix-p1.1"></span> have
wandered during the last few chapters from our study of the mystical
life-process in man, the organic growth of his transcendental
consciousness, in order to examine the byproducts of that process, its
characteristic forms of self-expression: the development of its normal
art of contemplation, and the visions and voices, ecstasies and raptures
which are frequent—though not essential—accompaniments of its activity.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p2"></span>But the mystic, like other persons of
genius, is man first and artist afterwards. We shall make a grave though
common mistake if we forget this and allow ourselves to be deflected
from our study of his growth in personality by the wonder and interest
of his art. Being, not Doing, is the first aim of the mystic; and hence
should be the first interest of the student of mysticism. We have
considered for convenience’ sake all the chief forms of mystical
activity at the half-way house of the transcendental life: but these
activities are not, of course, peculiar to any one stage of that life.
Ecstasy, for instance, is as common a feature of mystical conversion
<span id="page_381">p. 381</span> <span id="an_iv.ix-Page_381"></span>
as of the last crisis, or “mystic marriage” of the soul:  <span
id="fr_782"></span>[783](#fn_782.md) whilst visions and voices—in selves of
a visionary or auditive type—accompany and illustrate every phase of the
inward development. They lighten and explain the trials of Purgation as
often as they express the joys of Illumination, and frequently mark the
crisis of transition from one mystic state to the next.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p4"></span>One exception, however, must be made to
this rule. The most intense period of that great swing-back into
darkness which usually divides the “first mystic life,” or Illuminative
Way, from the “second mystic life,” or Unitive Way, is generally a
period of utter blankness and stagnation, so far as mystical activity is
concerned. The “Dark Night of the Soul,” once fully established, is
seldom lit by visions or made homely by voices. It is of the essence of
its miseries that the once-possessed power of orison or contemplation
now seems wholly lost. The self is tossed back from its hard-won point
of vantage. Impotence, blankness, solitude, are the epithets by which
those immersed in this dark fire of purification describe their pains.
It is this episode in the life-history of the mystic type to which we
have now come.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p5"></span>We have already noticed  <span
id="fr_783"></span>[784](#fn_783.md) the chief psychological
characteristics of all normal mystical development. We have seen that
its essence consists in the effort to establish a new equilibrium, to
get, as it were, a firm foothold upon transcendent levels of reality;
and that in its path towards this consummation the self experiences a
series of oscillations between “states of pleasure” and “states of
pain.” Put in another way, it is an orderly movement of the whole
consciousness towards higher centres, in which each intense and
progressive affirmation fatigues the immature transcendental powers, and
is paid for by a negation; a swing-back of the whole consciousness, a
stagnation of intellect, a reaction of the emotions, or an inhibition of
the will.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p7"></span>Thus the exalted consciousness of Divine
Perfection which the self acquired in its “mystical awakening” was
balanced by a depressed and bitter consciousness of its own inherent
imperfection, and the clash of these two perceptions spurred it to that
laborious effort of accommodation which constitutes the “Purgative Way.”
The renewed and ecstatic awareness of the Absolute which resulted, and
which was the governing characteristic of Illumination, brought its own
proper negation: the awareness, that is to say, of the self’s continued
separation from and incompatibility with that Absolute which it has
perceived. During the time in which the illuminated consciousness is
fully established, the self, as a rule, is perfectly content: believing
that in its vision <span id="page_382">p. 382</span> <span
id="an_iv.ix-Page_382"></span> of Eternity, its intense and loving
consciousness of God, it has reached the goal of its quest. Sooner or
later, however, psychic fatigue sets in; the state of illumination
begins to break up, the complementary negative consciousness appears,
and shows itself as an overwhelming sense of darkness and deprivation.
This sense is so deep and strong that it inhibits all consciousness of
the Transcendent; and plunges the self into the state of negation and
misery which is called the Dark Night.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p8"></span>We may look at the Dark Night, as at most
other incidents of the Mystic Way, from two points of view: (1) We may
see it, with the psychologist, as a moment in the history of mental
development, governed by the more or less mechanical laws which so
conveniently explain to him the psychic life of man: or (2) with the
mystic himself, we may see it in its spiritual aspect as contributing to
the remaking of character, the growth of the “New Man”; his
“transmutation in God.”

<span id="an_iv.ix-p9"></span>(1) Psychologically considered, the Dark
Night is an example of the operation of the law of reaction from stress.
It is a period of fatigue and lassitude following a period of sustained
mystical activity. “It is one of the best established laws of the
nervous system,” says Starbuck, “that it has periods of exhaustion if
exercised continuously in one direction, and can only recuperate by
having a period of rest.”  <span id="fr_784"></span>[785](#fn_784.md)
However spiritual he may be, the mystic—so long as he is in the
body—cannot help using the machinery of his nervous and cerebral system
in the course of his adventures. His development, on its psychic side,
consists in the taking over of this machinery, the capture of its
centres of consciousness, in the interests of his growing transcendental
life. In so far, then, as this is so, that transcendental life will be
partly conditioned by psychic necessities, and amenable to the laws of
reaction and of fatigue. Each great step forward will entail lassitude
and exhaustion for that mental machinery which he has pressed unto
service and probably overworked. When the higher centres have been
submitted to the continuous strain of a developed illuminated life, with
its accompanying periods of intense fervour, lucidity, deep
contemplation—perhaps of visionary and auditive phenomena—the swing-back
into the negative state occurs almost of necessity.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p11"></span>This is the psychological explanation of
those strange and painful episodes in the lives of great saints—indeed,
of many spiritual persons hardly to be classed as saints—when, perhaps
after a long life passed in faithful correspondence with the
transcendental order, growing consciousness of the “presence of God,”
the whole inner experience is suddenly swept away, and only a <span
id="page_383">p. 383</span> <span id="an_iv.ix-Page_383"></span> blind
reliance on past convictions saves them from unbelief.  <span
id="fr_785"></span>[786](#fn_785.md) The great contemplatives, those
destined to attain the full stature of the mystic, emerge from this
period of destitution, however long and drastic it may be, as from a new
purification. It is for them the gateway to a higher state. But persons
of a less heroic spirituality, if they enter the Night at all may
succumb to its dangers and pains. This “great negation” is the
sorting-house of the spiritual life. Here we part from the “nature
mystics,” the mystic poets, and all who shared in and were contented
with the illuminated vision of reality. Those who go on are the great
and strong spirits, who do not seek to *know,* but are driven to *be.*

<span id="an_iv.ix-p13"></span>We are to expect, then, as a part of the
conditions under which human consciousness appears to work that for
every affirmation of the mystic life there will be a negation waiting
for the unstable self. Progress in contemplation, for instance, is
marked by just such an alternation of light and shade: at first between
“consolation” and “aridity”; then between “dark contemplation” and sharp
intuitions of Reality. So too in selves of extreme nervous instability,
each joyous ecstasy entails a painful or negative ecstasy. The states of
darkness and illumination coexist over a long period, alternating
sharply and rapidly. Many seers and artists pay in this way, by
agonizing periods of impotence and depression, for each violent outburst
of creative energy.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p14"></span>Rapid oscillations between a joyous and a
painful consciousness seem to occur most often at the beginning of a new
period of the Mystic Way: between Purgation and Illumination, and again
between Illumination and the Dark Night: for these mental states are, as
a rule, gradually not abruptly established. Mystics call such
oscillations the “Game of Love” in which God plays, as it were, “hide
and seek” with the questing soul. I have already quoted a characteristic
instance from the life of Rulman Merswin,  <span
id="fr_786"></span>[787](#fn_786.md) who passed the whole intervening
period between his conversion and entrance on the Dark Night, or “school
of suffering love” in such a state of disequilibrium. Thus too Madame
Guyon, who has described with much elaboration of detail her symptoms
and sufferings during the oncoming and duration of the Night—or, as she
calls its intensest period the Mystic Death—traces its beginning in
short recurrent states of privation, or dullness of feeling, such as
ascetic writers call “aridity”: in which the self loses all interest in
and affection for those divine realities which had <span
id="page_384">p. 384</span> <span id="an_iv.ix-Page_384"></span>
previously filled its life. This privation followed upon, or was the
reaction from, an “illuminated” period of extreme joy and security, in
which, as she says, “the presence of God never left me for an instant.
But how dear I paid for this time of happiness! For this possession,
which seemed to me entire and perfect—and the more perfect the more it
was secret, and foreign to the senses, steadfast and exempt from
change—was but the preparation for a total deprivation, lasting many
years, without any support or hope of its return.”  <span
id="fr_787"></span>[788](#fn_787.md) As Madame Guyon never attempted to
control her states, but made a point of conforming to her own
description of the “resigned soul” as “God’s weathercock,” we have in
her an unequalled opportunity of study.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p17"></span>“I endured,” she says, “long periods of
privation, towards the end almost continual: but still I had from time
to time inflowings of Thy Divinity so deep and intimate, so vivid and so
penetrating, that it was easy for me to judge that Thou wast but hidden
from me and not lost. For although during the times of privation it
seemed to me that I had utterly lost Thee, a certain deep support
remained, though the soul knew it not: and she only became aware of that
support by her subsequent total deprivation thereof. Every time that
Thou didst return with more goodness and strength, Thou didst return
also with greater splendour; so that in a few hours Thou didst rebuild
all the ruins of my unfaithfulness and didst make good to me with
profusion all my loss.”  <span id="fr_788"></span>[789](#fn_788.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p19"></span>Here we have, from the psychological
point of view, a perfect example of the oscillations of consciousness on
the threshold of a new state. The old equilibrium, the old grouping
round a centre characterized by pleasure-affirmation, has been lost; the
new grouping round a centre characterized by pain-negation is not yet
established. Madame Guyon is standing, or rather swinging, between two
worlds, the helpless prey of her own shifting and uncontrollable psychic
and spiritual states. But slowly the pendulum approaches its limit: the
states of privation, “become almost continual,” the reactions to
illumination, become less. At last they cease entirely, the new state is
established, and the Dark Night has really set in.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p20"></span>The theory here advanced that the “Dark
Night” is, on its psychic side, partly a condition of fatigue, partly a
state of transition, is borne out by the mental and moral disorder which
seems, in many subjects, to be its dominant character. When they are in
it everything seems to “go wrong” with them. They are tormented by evil
thoughts and abrupt temptations, lose grasp not only of their spiritual
but also of their worldly affairs. Thus Lucie-Christine says: “Often
during my great temptations to <span id="page_385">p. 385</span> <span
id="an_iv.ix-Page_385"></span> sadness I am plunged in such spiritual
darkness that I think myself utterly lost in falsehood and illusion;
deceiving both myself and others. This temptation is the most terrible
of all.”  <span id="fr_789"></span>[790](#fn_789.md) The health of those
passing through this phase often suffers, they become “odd” and their
friends forsake them; their intellectual life is at a low ebb. In their
own words “trials of every kind,” “exterior and interior crosses,”
abound.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p22"></span>Now “trials,” taken<span
id="an_iv.ix-p22.1"></span> *en bloc* *,* mean a disharmony between the
self and the world with which it has to deal. Nothing is a trial when we
are able to cope with it efficiently. Things try us when we are not
adequate to them: when they are abnormally hard or we abnormally weak.
This aspect of the matter becomes prominent when we look further into
the history of Madame Guyon’s experiences. Thanks to the unctuous and
detailed manner in which she has analysed her spiritual griefs, this
part of her autobiography is a psychological document of unique
importance for the study of the “Dark Night” as it appears in a devout
but somewhat self-occupied soul.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p23"></span>As her consciousness of God was gradually
extinguished, a mental and moral chaos seems to have invaded Madame
Guyon and accompanied the more spiritual miseries of her state. “So soon
as I perceived the happiness of any state, or its beauty, or the
necessity of a virtue, it seemed to me that I fell incessantly into the
contrary vice: as if this perception, which though very rapid was always
accompanied by love, were only given to me that I might experience its
opposite. I was given an intense perception of the purity of God; and so
far as my feelings went, I myself became more and more impure: for in
reality this state is very purifying, but I was far from understanding
this. . . . My imagination was in a state of appalling confusion, and
gave me no rest. I could not speak of Thee, oh my God, for I became
utterly stupid; nor could I even grasp what was said when I heard Thee
spoken of. . . . I found myself hard towards God, insensible to His
mercies; I could not perceive any good thing that I had done in my whole
life. The good appeared to me evil; and—that which is terrible—it seemed
to me that this state must last for ever.”  <span
id="fr_790"></span>[791](#fn_790.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p25"></span>This world as well as the next seemed
leagued against her. Loss of health and friendship, domestic vexations,
increased and kept pace with her interior griefs. Self-control and power
of attention were diminished. She seemed stupefied and impotent, unable
to follow or understand even the services of the Church, incapable of
all prayer and all good works; perpetually attracted by those worldly
things which she had renounced, yet quickly wearied by them. The neat
edifice of her first mystic life was in <span id="page_386">p.
386</span> <span id="an_iv.ix-Page_386"></span> ruins, the state of
consciousness which accompanied it was disintegrated, but nothing arose
to take its place.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p26"></span>“It is an amazing thing,” says Madame
Guyon naively, “for a soul that believed herself to be advanced in the
way of perfection, when she sees herself thus go to pieces all at once.”
 <span id="fr_791"></span>[792](#fn_791.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p28"></span>So, too, Suso, when he had entered the
“upper school” of the spiritual life, was tormented not only by
temptations and desolations, but by outward trials and disabilities of
every kind: calumnies, misunderstandings, difficulties, pains. “It
seemed at this time as if God had given permission both to men and
demons to torment the Servitor,” he says.  <span
id="fr_792"></span>[793](#fn_792.md) This sense of a generally inimical
atmosphere, and of the dimness and helplessness of the Ego oppressed by
circumstances, is like the vague distress and nervous sensibility of
adolescence, and comes in part from the same cause: the intervening
period of chaos between the break-up of an old state of equilibrium and
the establishment of the new. The self, in its necessary movement
towards higher levels of reality, loses and leaves behind certain
elements of its world, long loved but now outgrown: as children must
make the hard transition from nursery to school. Destruction and
construction here go together: the exhaustion and ruin of the
illuminated consciousness is the signal for the onward movement of the
self towards other centres: the feeling of deprivation and inadequacy
which comes from the loss of that consciousness is an indirect stimulus
to new growth. The self is being pushed into a new world where it does
not feel at home; has not yet reached the point at which it enters into
conscious possession of its second or adult life.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p30"></span>“Thou hast been a child at the breast, a
spoiled child,” said the Eternal Wisdom to Suso. “Now I will withdraw
all this.” In the resulting darkness and confusion, when the old and
known supports are thus withdrawn, the self can do little but surrender
itself to the inevitable process of things: to the operation of that
unresting Spirit of Life which is pressing it on towards a new and
higher state, in which it shall not only see Reality but *be* real.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p31"></span>Psychologically, then, the “Dark Night of
the Soul” is due to the double fact of the exhaustion of an old state,
and the growth towards a new state of consciousness. It is a “growing
pain” in the organic process of the self’s attainment of the Absolute.
The great mystics, creative geniuses in the realm of character, have
known instinctively how to turn these psychic disturbances to spiritual
profit. Parallel with the mental oscillations, upheavals and
readjustments, through which an unstable psycho-physical type moves to
new centres of consciousness, run the spiritual oscillations of a
striving and ascending spiritual type. <span id="an_iv.ix-p31.1"></span>
*Gyrans* <span id="page_387">p. 387</span> <span
id="an_iv.ix-Page_387"></span> *gyrando vadit spiritus* . The machinery
of consciousness, over-stretched, breaks up, and seems to toss the self
back to an old and lower level, where it loses its apprehensions of the
transcendental world; as the child, when first it is forced to stand
alone, feels weaker than it did in its mother’s arms.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p32"></span>“For first He not only withdraws all
comfortable observable infusions of light and grace, but also deprives
her of a power to exercise any perceptible operations of her superior
spirit, and of all comfortable reflections upon His love, plunging her
into the depth of her inferior powers,” says Augustine Baker, the
skilled director of souls, here anticipating the modern psychologist.
“Here consequently,” he continues, “her former calmness of passions is
quite lost, neither can she introvert herself; sinful motions and
suggestions do violently assault her, and she finds as great difficulty
(if not greater) to surmount them as at the beginning of a spiritual
course. . . . If she would elevate her spirit, she sees nothing but
clouds and darkness. She seeks God, and cannot find the least marks or
footsteps of His Presence; something there is that hinders her from
executing the sinful suggestions within her but what that is she knows
not, for to her thinking she has no spirit at all, and, indeed, she is
now in a region of all other most distant from spirit and spiritual
operations—I mean, such as are perceptible.”  <span
id="fr_793"></span>[794](#fn_793.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p34"></span>Such an interval of chaos and misery may
last for months, or even for years, before the consciousness again
unifies itself and a new centre is formed. Moreover, the negative side
of this new centre, this new consciousness of the Absolute, often
discloses itself first. The self realizes, that is to say, the
inadequacy of its old state, long before it grasps the possibility of a
new and higher state. This realization will take two forms; ( *a* )
Objective: the distance or absence of the Absolute which the self seeks,
( *b* ) Subjective: the self’s weakness and imperfection. Both
apprehensions constitute a direct incentive to action. They present, as
it were, a Divine Negation which the self must probe, combat, resolve.
The Dark Night, therefore, largely the product of natural causes, is the
producer in its turn of mystical energy; and hence of supernatural
effects.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p35"></span>(2) So much for psychology. We have next
to consider the mystical or transcendental aspects of the Dark Night:
see what it has meant for those mystics who have endured it and for
those spiritual specialists who have studied it in the interests of
other men.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p36"></span>As in other phases of the Mystic Way, so
here, we must beware of any generalization which reduces the “Dark
Night” to a uniform <span id="page_388">p. 388</span> <span
id="an_iv.ix-Page_388"></span> experience; a neatly defined state which
appears under the same conditions, and attended by the same symptoms, in
all the selves who have passed through its pains. It is a name for the
painful and negative state which normally intervenes between the
Illuminative and the Unitive Life—no more. Different types of
contemplatives have interpreted it to themselves and to us in different
ways; each type of illumination being in fact balanced by its own
appropriate type of “dark.”

<span id="an_iv.ix-p37"></span>In some temperaments it is the emotional
aspect—the anguish of the lover who has suddenly lost the Beloved—which
predominates: in others, the intellectual darkness and confusion
overwhelms everything else. Some have felt it, with St. John of the
Cross, as a “passive purification,” a state of helpless misery, in which
the self does nothing, but lets Life have its way with her. Others, with
Suso and the virile mysticism of the German school, have experienced it
rather as a period of strenuous activity and moral conflict directed to
that “total self-abandonment” which is the essential preparation of the
unitive life. Those elements of character which were unaffected by the
first purification of the self—left as it were in a corner when the
consciousness moved to the level of the illuminated life—are here roused
from their sleep, purged of illusion, and forced to join the grooving
stream.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p38"></span>The Dark Night, then, is really a deeply
human process, in which the self which thought itself so spiritual, so
firmly established upon the supersensual plane, is forced to turn back,
to leave the Light, and pick up those qualities which it had left
behind. Only thus, by the transmutation of the *whole man,* not by a
careful and departmental cultivation of that which we like to call his
“spiritual” side, can Divine Humanity be formed: and the formation of
Divine Humanity—the remaking of man “according to the pattern showed him
in the mount”—is the mystic’s only certain ladder to the Real. “My
humanity,” said the Eternal Wisdom to Suso, “is the road which all must
tread who would come to that which thou seekest.”  <span
id="fr_794"></span>[795](#fn_794.md) This “hard saying” might almost be
used as a test by which to distinguish the genuine mystic life from its
many and specious imitations. The self in its first purgation has
cleansed the mirror of perception; hence, in its illuminated life, has
seen Reality. In so doing it has transcended the normal perceptive
powers of “natural” man, immersed in the illusions of sense. Now, it has
got to *be* reality: a very different thing. For this a new and more
drastic purgation is needed—not of the organs of perception, but of the
very shrine of self: that “heart” which is the seat of personality, the
source of its love and will. In the stress and anguish of the Night,
when it turns back from the vision <span id="page_389">p. 389</span>
<span id="an_iv.ix-Page_389"></span> of the Infinite to feel again the
limitations of the finite the self loses the power to Do; and learns to
surrender its will to the operation of a larger Life, that it may Be.
“At the end of such a long and cruel transition,” says Lucie Christine,
“how much more supple the soul feels itself to be in the Hand of God,
how much more detached from all that is not God! She sees clearly in
herself the fruits of humility and patience, and feels her love
ascending more purely and directly to God in proportion as she has
realized the Nothingness of herself and all things.”  <span
id="fr_795"></span>[796](#fn_795.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p41"></span>We must remember in the midst of our
analysis, that the mystic life is a life of love: that the Object of the
mystic’s final quest and of his constant intuition is an object of
adoration and supreme desire. “With Thee, a prison would be a rose
garden, oh Thou ravisher of hearts: with Thee, Hell would be Paradise,
oh Thou cheerer of souls,” said Jalalu ‘d Din.  <span
id="fr_796"></span>[797](#fn_796.md) Hence for the mystic who has once
known the Beatific Vision there can be no greater grief than the
withdrawal of this Object from his field of consciousness; the loss of
this companionship, the extinction of this Light. Therefore, whatever
form the “Dark Night” assumes, it must entail bitter suffering: far
worse than that endured in the Purgative Way. Then the self was forcibly
detached from the imperfect. Now the Perfect is withdrawn, leaving
behind an overwhelming yet impotent conviction of something supremely
wrong, some final Treasure lost. We will now look at a few of the
characteristic forms under which this conviction is translated to the
surface-consciousness.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p43"></span>A. To those temperaments in which
consciousness of the Absolute took the form of a sense of divine
companionship, and for whom the objective idea “God” had become the
central fact of life, it seems as though that God, having shown Himself,
has now deliberately withdrawn His Presence, never perhaps to manifest
Himself again. “He acts,” says Eckhart, “as if there were a wall erected
between Him and us.”  <span id="fr_797"></span>[798](#fn_797.md) The “eye
which looked upon Eternity” has closed, the old dear sense of intimacy
and mutual love has given place to a terrible blank.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p45"></span>“That which this anguished soul feels
most deeply,” says St. John of the Cross, “is the conviction that God
has abandoned it, *of* *which it has no doubt;* that He has cast it away
into darkness as an abominable thing . . . the shadow of death and the
pains and torments of hell are most acutely felt, and this comes from
the sense of being abandoned by God, being chastised and cast <span
id="page_390">p. 390</span> <span id="an_iv.ix-Page_390"></span> out by
His wrath and heavy displeasure. All this and even more the soul feels
now, for a terrible apprehension has come upon it that thus it will be
with it for ever. It has also the same sense of abandonment with respect
to all creatures, and that it is an object of contempt to all,
especially to its friends.”  <span id="fr_798"></span>[799](#fn_798.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p47"></span>So, too, Madame Guyon felt this loss of
her intuitive apprehension of God as one of the most terrible
characteristics of the “night.” “After Thou hadst wounded me so deeply
as I have described, Thou didst begin, oh my God, to withdraw Thyself
from me: and the pain of Thy absence was the more bitter to me, because
Thy presence had been so sweet to me, Thy love so strong in me. . . .
Thy way, oh my God, before Thou didst make me enter into the state of
death, was the way of the dying life: sometimes to hide Thyself and
leave me to myself in a hundred weaknesses, sometimes to show Thyself
with more sweetness and love. The nearer the soul drew to the state of
death, the more her desolations were long and weary, her weaknesses
increased, and also her joys became shorter, but purer and more
intimate, until the time in which she fell into total privation.”  <span
id="fr_799"></span>[800](#fn_799.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p49"></span>When this total privation or “mystic
death” is fully established, it involves not only the personal “Absence
of God,” but the apparent withdrawal or loss of that impersonal support,
that transcendent Ground or Spark of the soul, on which the self has
long felt its whole real life to be based. Hence, its very means of
contact with the spiritual world vanishes; and as regards all that
matters, it does indeed seem to be “dead.” “When we have reached this
total deprivation,” says De Caussade, “what shall we do? Abide in
simplicity and peace, as Job on his ash heap, repeating, ‘Blessed are
the poor in spirit; those who have nothing have all, since they have
God.’ ‘Quit all, strip yourself of all,’ says the great Gerson, ‘and you
will have all in God.’ ‘God felt, God tasted and enjoyed,’ says Fénelon,
‘is indeed God, but God with those gifts which flatter the soul. God in
darkness, in privation, in forsakenness, in insensibility, is so much
God, that He is so to speak God bare and alone. . . .’ Shall we fear
this death, which is to produce in us the true divine life of grace?”
 <span id="fr_800"></span>[801](#fn_800.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p51"></span>B. In those selves for whom the
subjective idea “Sanctity”—the need of conformity between the individual
character and the Transcendent—has been central, the pain of the Night
is less a deprivation than a new and dreadful kind of lucidity. The
vision of the Good brings to the self an abrupt sense of her own
hopeless and helpless imperfection: a black “conviction of sin,” far
more bitter than that endured in the Way of Purgation, which swamps
<span id="page_391">p. 391</span> <span id="an_iv.ix-Page_391"></span>
everything else. “That which makes her pain so terrible is that she is,
as it were, overwhelmed by the purity of God, and this purity makes her
see the least atoms of her imperfections as if they were enormous sins,
because of the infinite distance there is between the purity of God and
the creature.”  <span id="fr_801"></span>[802](#fn_801.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p53"></span>“This,” says St. John of the Cross again,
“is one of the most bitter sufferings of this purgation. The soul is
conscious of a profound emptiness in itself, a cruel destitution of the
three kinds of goods, natural, temporal, and spiritual, which are
ordained for its comfort. It sees itself in the midst of the opposite
evils, miserable imperfections, dryness and emptiness of the
understanding, and abandonment of the spirit in darkness.”  <span
id="fr_802"></span>[803](#fn_802.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p55"></span>C. Often combined with the sense of sin
and the “absence of God” is another negation, not the least distressing
part of the sufferings of the self suddenly plunged into the Night. This
is a complete emotional lassitude: the disappearance of all the old
ardours, now replaced by a callousness, a boredom, which the self
detests but cannot overcome. It is the dismal condition of spiritual
*ennui* which ascetic writers know so well under the name of “aridity,”
and which psychologists look upon as the result of emotional fatigue.
 <span id="fr_803"></span>[804](#fn_803.md) It seems incredible that the
eager love of a Divine Companion, so long the focus of the self’s whole
being should have vanished: that not only the transcendent vision should
be withdrawn, but her very desire for, and interest in, that vision
should grow cold. Yet the mystics are unanimous in declaring that this
is a necessary stage in the growth of the spiritual consciousness.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p57"></span>“When the sun begins to decline in the
heavens,” says Ruysbroeck, “it enters the sign Virgo; which is so called
because this period of the year is sterile as a virgin.” This is the
autumn season in the cycle of the soul, when the summer heat grows less.
“It perfects and fulfils the yearly travail of the Sun. In the same
manner, when Christ, that glorious sun, has risen to His zenith in the
heart of man, as I have taught in the Third degree, and afterwards
begins to decline, to hide the radiance of His divine sunbeams, and to
forsake the man; then the heat and impatience of love grow less. Now
that occultation of Christ, and the withdrawal of His light and heat,
are the first work and the new coming of this degree. Now Christ says
inwardly to this man, *Go ye out in the manner which I now show you:*
and the man goes out and finds himself to be poor, miserable, and
abandoned. Here all the storm, the fury, the impatience of his love,
grow cool: glowing summer <span id="page_392">p. 392</span> <span
id="an_iv.ix-Page_392"></span> turns to autumn, all its riches are
transformed into a great poverty. And the man begins to complain because
of his wretchedness: for where now are the ardours of love, the
intimacy, the gratitude, the joyful praise, and the interior
consolation, the secret joy, the sensible sweetness? How have all these
things failed him? And the burning violence of his love, and all the
gifts which he felt before. How has all this died in him? And he feels
like some ignorant man who has lost all his learning and his works . . .
and of this misery there is born the fear of being lost, and as it were
a sort of half-doubt: and this is the lowest point at which a man can
hold his ground without falling into despair.”  <span
id="fr_804"></span>[805](#fn_804.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p59"></span>D. This stagnation of the emotions has
its counterpart in the stagnation of the will and intelligence, which
has been experienced by some contemplatives as a part of their negative
state. As regards the will, there is a sort of moral dereliction: the
self cannot control its inclinations and thoughts. In the general
psychic turmoil, all the unpurified part of man’s inheritance, the lower
impulses and unworthy ideas which have long been imprisoned below the
threshold, force their way into the field of consciousness. “Every vice
was re-awakened within me,” says Angela of Foligno, “I would have chosen
rather to be roasted than to endure such pains.”  <span
id="fr_805"></span>[806](#fn_805.md) Where visual and auditory automatism
is established, these irruptions from the subliminal region often take
the form of evil visions, or of voices making coarse or sinful
suggestions to the self. Thus St. Catherine of Siena, in the interval
between her period of joyous illumination and her “spiritual marriage,”
was tormented by visions of fiends, who filled her cell and “with
obscene words and gestures invited her to lust.” She fled from her cell
to the church to escape them, but they pursued her there: and she
obtained no relief from this obsession until she ceased to oppose it.
She cried, “I have chosen suffering for my consolation, and will gladly
bear these and all other torments in the name of the Saviour, for as
long as it shall please His Majesty.” With this act of surrender, the
evil vision fled: Catherine swung back to a state of affirmation, and
was comforted by a vision of the Cross.  <span
id="fr_806"></span>[807](#fn_806.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p62"></span>An analogous psychological state was
experienced by St. Teresa; though she fails to recognize it as an
episode in her normal development, and attributes it, with other
spiritual adventures for which she can find no other explanation, to the
action of the Devil. “The soul,” she says, “laid in fetters, loses all
control over itself, and all power of thinking of anything but the
absurdities he puts before it, which, being more or less unsubstantial,
inconsistent, and <span id="page_393">p. 393</span> <span
id="an_iv.ix-Page_393"></span> disconnected, serve only to stifle the
soul, so that it has no power over itself; and accordingly—so it seems
to me—the devils make a football of it, and the soul is unable to escape
out of their hands. It is impossible to describe the sufferings of the
soul in this state. It goes about in quest of relief, and God suffers it
to find none. The light of reason, in the freedom of its will, remains,
but it is not clear; it seems to me as if its eyes were covered with a
veil. . . . Temptations seem to press it down, and make it dull, so that
its knowledge of God becomes to it as that of something which it hears
of far away.” This dullness and dimness extends to ordinary mental
activity, which shares in the lassitude and disorder of the inner life.
“If it seeks relief from the fire by spiritual reading, it cannot find
any, just as if it could not read at all. On one occasion it occurred to
me to read the life of a saint, that I might forget myself and be
refreshed with the recital of what he had suffered. Four or five times,
I read as many lines, and though they were written in Spanish, I
understood them less at the end than I did when I began: so I gave it
up. It so happened to me on more occasions than one.”  <span
id="fr_807"></span>[808](#fn_807.md) If we are reminded of anything here,
it is of the phenomenon of “dark contemplation.” That dimness of mind
which we there studied, is here extended to the normal activities of the
surface intelligence. The Cloud of Unknowing, rolling up, seems to
envelop the whole self. Contemplation, the “way within the way,” has
epitomized the greater process of the mystic life. In both, the path to
Light lies through a meek surrender to the confusion and ignorance of
the “Dark.” The stress and exasperation felt in this dark, this state of
vague helplessness, by selves of an active and self-reliant type, is
exhibited by Teresa in one of her half-humorous self-revealing flashes.
“The Devil,” she says of it, “then sends so offensive a spirit of bad
temper that I think I could eat people up!”  <span
id="fr_808"></span>[809](#fn_808.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p65"></span>All these types of “darkness,” with their
accompanying and overwhelming sensations of impotence and distress, are
common in the lives of the mystics. Suso and Rulman Merswin experienced
them: Tauler constantly refers to them: Angela of Foligno speaks of a
“privation worse than hell.” It is clear that even the joyous spirit of
Mechthild of Magdeburg knew the sufferings of the loss and absence of
God. “Lord,” she says in one place, “since Thou hast taken from me all
that I had of Thee, yet of Thy grace leave me the gift which every dog
has by nature: that of being true to Thee in my distress; when I am
deprived of all consolation. This I desire more fervently than Thy
heavenly Kingdom!”  <span id="fr_809"></span>[810](#fn_809.md) In such a
saying as this, the whole “value for life” of the Dark Night is <span
id="page_394">p. 394</span> <span id="an_iv.ix-Page_394"></span>
revealed to us: as an education in selfless constancy, a “school of
suffering love.”

<span id="an_iv.ix-p67"></span>E. There is, however, another way in
which the self’s sense of a continued imperfection in its relation with
the Absolute—of work yet remaining to be done—expresses itself. In
persons of a very highly strung and mobile type, who tend to rapid
oscillations between pain and pleasure states, rather than to the long,
slow movements of an ascending consciousness, attainment of the Unitive
Life is sometimes preceded by the abrupt invasion of a wild and
unendurable desire to “see God,” apprehend the Transcendent in Its
fullness: which can only, they think, be satisfied by death. As they
begin to outgrow their illuminated consciousness, these selves begin
also to realize how partial and symbolic that consciousness—even at its
best—has been: and their movement to union with God is foreshadowed by a
passionate and uncontrollable longing for ultimate Reality. This passion
is so intense, that it causes acute anguish in those who feel it. It
brings with it all the helpless and desolate feelings of the Dark Night;
and sometimes rises to the heights of a negative rapture, an ecstasy of
deprivation. St. Teresa is perhaps the best instance of this rare method
of apprehending the self’s essential separation from its home; which is
also the subject of a celebrated chapter in the <span
id="an_iv.ix-p67.1"></span>“Traité de l’Amour de Dieu” of St. François
de Sales.  <span id="fr_810"></span>[811](#fn_810.md) Thanks to her
exceptionally mobile temperament, her tendency to rush up and down the
scale of feeling, Teresa’s states of joyous rapture were often paid for
by such a “great desolation”—a dark ecstasy or “pain of God.” “As long
as this pain lasts,” she says, “we cannot even remember our own
existence; for in an instant all the faculties of the soul are so
fettered as to lie incapable of any action save that of increasing our
torture. Do not think I am exaggerating; on the contrary, that which I
say is less than the truth, for lack of words in which it may be
expressed. This is a trance of the senses and the faculties, save as
regards all which helps to make the agony more intense. The
understanding realizes acutely what cause there is for grief in
separation from God: and our Lord increases this sorrow by a vivid
manifestation of Himself. The pain thus grows to such a degree that in
spite of herself the sufferer gives vent to loud cries, which she cannot
stifle, however patient and accustomed to pain she may be, because this
is not a pain which is felt in the body, but in the depths of the soul.
The person I speak of learned from this how much more acutely the spirit
is capable of suffering than the body.  <span
id="fr_811"></span>[812](#fn_811.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p70"></span>The intense and painful concentration
upon the Divine Absence which takes place in this “dark rapture” often
induces all the <span id="page_395">p. 395</span> <span
id="an_iv.ix-Page_395"></span> psycho-physical marks of ecstasy.
“Although this state lasts but a short time, the limbs seem to be
disjointed by it. The pulse is as feeble as if one were at the point of
death; which is indeed the case, for whilst the natural heat of the body
fails, that which is supernatural so burns the frame that with a few
more degrees God would satisfy the soul’s desire for death. . . . You
will say perhaps, that there is imperfection in this desire to see God:
and ask why this soul does not conform herself to His will, since she
has so completely surrendered herself to it. Hitherto she could do this,
and consecrated her life to it; but now she cannot, for her reason is
reduced to such a state that she is no longer mistress of herself and
can think of nothing but her affliction. Far from her Sovereign Good,
why should she desire to live? She feels an extraordinary loneliness,
finds no companionship in any earthly creature; nor could she I believe
among those who dwell in heaven, since they are not her Beloved.
Meanwhile all company is torture to her. She is like a person suspended
in mid-air, who can neither touch the earth, nor mount to heaven. She
burns with a consuming thirst, and cannot reach the water. And this is a
thirst which cannot be borne, but one which nothing will quench: nor
would she have it quenched with any other water than that of which our
Lord spoke to the Samaritan woman; and this water is denied her.”  <span
id="fr_812"></span>[813](#fn_812.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p72"></span>All these forms of the Dark Night—the
“Absence of God,” the sense of sin, the dark ecstasy, the loss of the
self’s old passion, peace, and joy, and its apparent relapse to lower
spiritual and mental levels—are considered by the mystics themselves to
constitute aspects or parts of one and the same process: the final
purification of the will or stronghold of personality, that it may be
merged without any reserve “in God where it was first.” The function of
this episode of the Mystic Way is to cure the soul of the innate
tendency to seek and rest in spiritual joys; to confuse Reality with the
joy given by the contemplation of Reality. It is the completion of that
ordering of disordered loves, that trans-valuation of values, which the
Way of Purgation began. The ascending self must leave these childish
satisfactions; make its love absolutely disinterested, strong, and
courageous, abolish all taint of spiritual gluttony. A total abandonment
of the individualistic standpoint, of that trivial and egotistic quest
of personal satisfaction which thwarts the great movement of the Flowing
Light, is the supreme condition of man’s participation in Reality. Thus
is true not only of the complete participation which is possible to the
great mystic, but of those unselfish labours in which the initiates of
science or of art become to the Eternal Goodness <span id="page_396">p.
396</span> <span id="an_iv.ix-Page_396"></span> “what his own hand is to
a man.” “Think not,” says Tauler, “that God will be always caressing His
children, or shine upon their head, or kindle their hearts as He does at
the first. He does so only to lure us to Himself, as the falconer lures
the falcon with its gay hood. . . . We must stir up and rouse ourselves
and be content to leave off learning, and no more enjoy feeling and
warmth, and must now serve the Lord with strenuous industry and at our
own cost.”  <span id="fr_813"></span>[814](#fn_813.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p74"></span>This manly view of the Dark Night, as a
growth in responsibility—an episode of character-building—in which, as
“The Mirror of Simple Souls” has it, “the soul leaves that pride and
play wherein it was full gladsome and jolly,” is characteristic of the
German mystics. We find it again in Suso, to whom the angel of his
tribulation gave no sentimental consolations; but only the stern
command, <span id="an_iv.ix-p74.1"></span> *“Viriliter agite* ”—“Be a
man!” “Then first,” says Tauler again, “do we attain to the fullness of
God’s love as His children, when it is no longer happiness or misery,
prosperity or adversity, that draws us to Him or keeps us back from Him.
What we should then experience none can utter; but it would be something
far better than when we were burning with the first flame of love, and
had great emotion, but less true submission.”  <span
id="fr_814"></span>[815](#fn_814.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p76"></span>In Illumination, the soul, basking in the
Uncreated Light, identified the Divine Nature with the divine light and
sweetness which it then enjoyed. Its consciousness of the transcendent
was chiefly felt as an increase of personal vision and personal joy.
Thus, in that apparently selfless state, the “I, the Me, the Mine,”
though spiritualized, still remained intact. The mortification of the
senses was more than repaid by the rich and happy life which this
mortification conferred upon the soul. But before real and permanent
union with the Absolute can take place: before the whole self can learn
to live on those high levels where—its being utterly surrendered to the
Infinite Will—it can be wholly transmuted in God, merged in the great
life of the All, this dependence on personal joys must be done away. The
spark of the soul, the fast-growing germ of divine humanity, must so
invade every corner of character that the self can only say with St.
Catherine of Genoa, “My *me* is God: nor do I know my selfhood except in
God.”  <span id="fr_815"></span>[816](#fn_815.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p78"></span>The various torments and desolations of
the Dark Night constitute this last and drastic purgation of the spirit;
the doing away of separateness, the annihilation of selfhood, even
though all that self now claims for its own be the Love of God. Such a
claim—which is really a claim to entire felicity, since the soul which
possesses it needs nothing more—is felt by these great spirits to <span
id="page_397">p. 397</span> <span id="an_iv.ix-Page_397"></span> sully
the radiance of their self-giving love. “All that I would here say of
these inward delights and enjoyments,” says William Law, “is only this;
they are not holiness, they are not piety, they are not perfection; but
they are God’s gracious allurements and calls to seek after holiness and
spiritual perfection . . . and ought rather to convince us that we are
as yet but *babes,* than that we are ready *men* of God. . . . This
alone is the true Kingdom of God opened in the soul when, stripped of
all selfishness, it has only one love and one will in it; when it has no
motion or desire but what branches from the Love of God, and resigns
itself wholly to the Will of God. . . . To sum up all in a word: Nothing
hath separated us from God but our own will, or rather our own will is
our separation from God. All the disorder and corruption and malady of
our nature lies in a certain fixedness of our own will, imagination, and
desire, wherein we live to ourselves, are our own centre and
circumference, act wholly from ourselves, according to our own will,
imagination, and desires. There is not the smallest degree of evil in us
but what arises from this selfishness because we are thus all in all to
ourselves. . . . To be humble, mortified, devout, patient in a certain
degree, and to be persecuted for our virtues, is no hurt to this
selfishness; nay, *spiritual-self* must have all these virtues to
subsist upon, and his life consists in seeing, knowing and feeling the
bulk, strength, and reality of them. But still, in all this show and
glitter of virtue, there is an unpurified bottom on which they stand,
there is a selfishness which can no more enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven than the grossness of flesh and blood can enter into it. What we
are to feel and undergo in these last purifications, when the deepest
root of all selfishness, as well spiritual as natural, is to be plucked
up and torn from us, or how we shall be able to stand in that trial, are
both of them equally impossible to be known by us beforehand.”  <span
id="fr_816"></span>[817](#fn_816.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p80"></span>The self, then, has got to learn to cease
to be its “own centre and circumference”: to make that final surrender
which is the price of final peace. In the Dark Night the starved and
tortured spirit learns through an anguish which is “itself an orison” to
accept lovelessness for the sake of Love, Nothingness for the sake of
the All; dies without any sure promise of life, loses when it hardly
hopes to find. It sees with amazement the most sure foundations of its
transcendental life crumble beneath it, dwells in a darkness which seems
to hold no promise of a dawn. This is what the German mystics call the
“upper school of true resignation” or of “suffering love”; the last test
of heroic detachment, of manliness, of spiritual courage. Though such an
experience is <span id="page_398">p. 398</span> <span
id="an_iv.ix-Page_398"></span> “passive” in the sense that the self can
neither enter nor leave it at will it is a direct invitation to active
endurance, a condition of stress in which work is done. Thus, when St.
Catherine of Siena was tormented by hideous visions of sin, she was
being led by her deeper self to the heroic acceptance of this subtle
form of torture, almost unendurable to her chaste and delicate mind.
When these trials had brought her to the point at which she ceased to
resist them, but exclaimed, “I have chosen suffering for my
consolation,” their business was done. They ceased. More significant
still, when she asked, “Where wast Thou, Lord, when I was tormented by
this foulness?” the Divine Voice answered, “I was in thy heart.”  <span
id="fr_817"></span>[818](#fn_817.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p82"></span>“In order to raise the soul from
imperfection,” said the Voice of God to St. Catherine in her Dialogue,
“I withdraw Myself from her sentiment, depriving her of former
consolations . . . which I do in order to humiliate her, and cause her
to seek Me in truth, and to prove her in the light of faith, so that she
come to prudence. Then, if she love Me without thought of self, and with
lively faith and with hatred of her own sensuality, she rejoices in the
time of trouble, deeming herself unworthy of peace and quietness of
mind. Now comes the second of the three things of which I told thee,
that is to say: how the soul arrives at perfection, and what she does
when she is perfect. That is what she does. Though she perceives that I
have withdrawn Myself, she does not, on that account, look back; but
perseveres with humility in her exercises, remaining barred in the house
of self-knowledge, and, continuing to dwell therein, awaits with lively
faith the coming of the Holy Spirit, that is of Me, who am the Fire of
Love. . . . This is what the soul does in order to rise from
imperfection and arrive at perfection, and it is to this end, namely,
that she may arrive at perfection, that I withdraw from her, not by
grace, but by sentiment. Once more do I leave her so that she may see
and know her defects, so that feeling herself deprived of consolation
and afflicted by pain, she may recognize her own weakness, and learn how
incapable she is of stability or perseverance, thus cutting down to the
very root of spiritual self-love: for this should be the end and purpose
of all her self-knowledge, to rise above herself, mounting the throne of
conscience, and not permitting the sentiment of imperfect love to turn
again in its death-struggle, but with correction and reproof digging up
the root of self-love with the knife of self-hatred and the love of
virtue.”  <span id="fr_818"></span>[819](#fn_818.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p84"></span>“Digging up the root of self-love with
the knife of self-hatred”—here we see the mystical reason of that bitter
self-contempt and sense of helplessness which overwhelms the soul in the
Dark Night.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p85"></span>Such a sense of helplessness is really,
the mystics say, a mark of <span id="page_399">p. 399</span> <span
id="an_iv.ix-Page_399"></span> progress: of deeper initiation into that
sphere of reality to which it is not yet acclimatized, and which brings
with it a growing consciousness of the appalling disparity between that
Reality, that Perfection, and the imperfect soul.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p86"></span>The self is in the dark because it is
blinded by a Light greater than it can bear—that “Divine Wisdom which is
not only night and darkness to the soul, but pain and torment too.” “The
more clear the light, the more does it blind the eyes of the owl, and
the more we try to look at the sun the feebler grows our sight and the
more our weak eyes are darkened. So the divine light of contemplation,
when it beats on the soul not yet perfectly purified, fills it with
spiritual darkness, not only because of its brilliance, but because it
paralyses the natural perception of the soul. The pain suffered by the
soul is like that endured by weak or diseased eyes when suddenly struck
by a strong light. Such suffering is intense when the yet unpurified
soul finds itself invaded by this cleansing light. For in this pure
light, which attacks its impurities to expel them, the soul perceives
itself to be so unclean and miserable that it seems as if God had set
Himself against it. . . . Wonderful and piteous sight! so great are the
weakness and imperfection of the soul that the hand of God, so soft and
so gentle, is felt to be so heavy and oppressive, though merely touching
it, and that, too, most mercifully; for He touches the soul, not to
chastise it, but to load it with His graces.”  <span
id="fr_819"></span>[820](#fn_819.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p88"></span>The Dark Night then, whichever way we
look at it, is a state of disharmony; of imperfect adaptation to
environment. The self, unaccustomed to that direct contact of the
Absolute which is destined to become the Source of its vitality and its
joy, feels the “soft and gentle touch” of the Following Love as
unbearable in its weight. The “self-naughting” or “purification of the
will,” which here takes place, is the struggle to resolve that
disharmony; to purge away the somewhat which still sets itself up in the
soul as separate from the Divine, and makes the clear light of reality a
torment instead of a joy. So deeply has the soul now entered into the
great stream of spiritual life, so dominant has her transcendental
faculty become, that this process is accomplished in her whether she
will or no: and in this sense it is, as ascetic writers sometimes call
it, a “passive purgation.” So long as the subject still feels himself to
be *somewhat,* he has not yet annihilated selfhood and come to that
ground where his being can be united with the Being of God.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p89"></span>Only when he learns to cease thinking of
himself at all, in however depreciatory a sense; when he abolishes even
such selfhood as lies in a desire for the sensible presence of God, will
that <span id="page_400">p. 400</span> <span
id="an_iv.ix-Page_400"></span> harmony be attained. This is the
“naughting of the soul,” the utter surrender to the great movement of
the Absolute Life, which is insisted upon at such length by all writers
upon mysticism. Here, as in purgation, the condition of access to higher
levels of vitality is a death: a deprivation, a detachment, a clearing
of the ground. Poverty leaps to the Cross: and finds there an utter
desolation, without promise of spiritual reward. The satisfactions of
the spirit must now go the same way as the satisfactions of the senses.
Even the power of voluntary sacrifice and self-discipline is taken away.
A dreadful *ennui,* a dull helplessness, takes its place. The mystic
motto, *I am nothing, I have nothing, I desire nothing,* must now
express not only the detachment of the senses, but the whole being’s
surrender to the All.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p90"></span>The moral condition towards which the
interior travail is directed is that of an utter humility. “Everything
depends,” says Tauler, on “a fathomless sinking in a fathomless
nothingness.” He continues, “If a man were to say, ‘Lord, who art Thou,
that I must follow Thee through such deep, gloomy, miserable paths?’ the
Lord would reply, ‘I am God and Man, and far more God.’ If a man could
answer then, really and consciously from the bottom of his heart. ‘Then
I am nothing and less than nothing’; all would be accomplished, for the
Godhead has really no place to work in, but ground where all has been
annihilated.  <span id="fr_820"></span>[821](#fn_820.md) As the schoolmen
say, when a new form is to come into existence, the old must of
necessity be destroyed. . . . And so I say: ‘If a man is to be thus
clothed upon with this Being, all the forms must of necessity be done
away that were ever received by him in all his powers—of perception,
knowledge, will, work, of subjection, sensibility and self-seeking.’
When St. Paul saw nothing, he saw God. So also when Elias wrapped his
face in his mantle, God came. All strong rocks are broken here, all on
which the spirit can rest must be done away. Then, when all forms have
ceased to exist, in the twinkling of an eye the man is transformed.
Therefore thou must make an entrance. Thereupon speaks the Heavenly
Father to him: “Thou shalt call Me Father, and shalt never cease to
enter in; entering ever further in, ever nearer, so as to sink the
deeper in an unknown and unnamed abyss; and, above all ways, images and
forms, and above all powers, to lose thyself, deny thyself, and even
unform thyself.’ In this lost condition nothing is to be seen but a
ground which rests upon itself, everywhere one Being, one Life. It is
thus, man may say, that he becomes unknowing, unloving, and senseless.”
 <span id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p93"></span>It is clear that so drastic a process of
unselfing is not likely <span id="page_401">p. 401</span> <span
id="an_iv.ix-Page_401"></span> to take place without stress. It is the
negative aspect of “deification”: in which the self, deprived of
“perception, knowledge, will, work, self-seeking”—the I, the Me, the
Mine—loses itself, denies itself, unforms itself, drawing “ever nearer”
to the One, till “nothing is to be seen but a ground which rests upon
itself”—the ground of the soul, in which it has union with God.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p94"></span>“Everywhere one Being, one Life”—this is
the goal of mystical activity; the final state of equilibrium towards
which the self is moving, or rather struggling, in the dimness and
anguish of the Dark Night. “The soul,” says Madame Guyon in a passage of
unusual beauty, “after many a redoubled death, expires at last in the
arms of Love; but she is unable to perceive these arms. . . . Then,
reduced to Nought, there is found in her ashes a seed of immortality,
which is preserved in these ashes and will germinate in its season. But
she knows not this; and does not expect ever to see herself living
again.” Moreover, “the soul which is reduced to the Nothing, ought to
dwell therein; without wishing, since she is now but dust, to issue from
this state, nor, as before, desiring to live again. She must remain as
something which no longer exists: and this, in order that the Torrent
may drown itself and lose itself in the Sea, never to find itself in its
selfhood again: that it may become one and the same thing with the Sea.”
 <span id="fr_822"></span>[823](#fn_822.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p96"></span>So Hilton says of the “naughted soul,”
“the less it thinketh that it loveth or seeth God, the nearer it nigheth
for to perceive the gift of the blessed love. For then is love master,
and worketh in the soul, and maketh it for to forget itself, and for to
see and behold only how love doth. And then is the soul more suffering
than doing, and that is clean love.”  <span
id="fr_823"></span>[824](#fn_823.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p98"></span>The “mystic death” or Dark Night is
therefore an aspect or incident of the transition from multiplicity to
Unity, of that mergence and union of the soul with the Absolute which is
the whole object of the mystical evolution of man. It is the last
painful break with the life of illusion, the tearing away of the self
from that World of Becoming in which all its natural affections and
desires are rooted, to which its intellect and senses correspond; and
the thrusting of it into that World of Being where at first, weak and
blinded, it can but find a wilderness, a “dark.” No transmutation
without fire, say the alchemists: No cross, no crown, says the
Christian. All the great experts of the spiritual life agree—whatever
their creeds, their symbols, their explanations—in describing this
stress, tribulation, and loneliness, as an essential part of the way
from the Many to the One; bringing the self to the threshold of that
completed life which is to be lived in intimate union with <span
id="page_402">p. 402</span> <span id="an_iv.ix-Page_402"></span>
Reality. It is the Entombment which precedes the Resurrection, say the
Christian mystics; ever ready to describe their life-process in the
language of their faith. Here as elsewhere—but nowhere else in so
drastic a sense—the self must “lose to find and die to live.”

<span id="an_iv.ix-p99"></span>The Dark Night, as we have seen, tends to
establish itself gradually; the powers and intuitions of the self being
withdrawn one after another, the intervals of lucidity becoming rarer,
until the “mystic death” or state of total deprivation is reached. So,
too, when the night begins to break down before the advance of the new
or Unitive Life, the process is generally slow, though it may be
marked—as for instance in Rulman Merswin’s case—by visions and
ecstasies.  <span id="fr_824"></span>[825](#fn_824.md) One after another,
the miseries and disharmonies of the Dark Night give way: affirmation
takes the place of negation: the Cloud of Unknowing is pierced by rays
of light.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p101"></span>The act of complete surrender then,
which is the term of the Dark Night, has given the self its footing in
Eternity: its abandonment of the old centres of consciousness has
permitted movement towards the new. In each such forward movement, the
Transcendental Self, that spark of the soul which is united to the
Absolute Life, has invaded more and more the seat of personality; stage
by stage the remaking of the self in conformity with the Eternal World
has gone on. In the misery and apparent stagnation of the Dark
Night—that dimness of the spiritual consciousness, that dullness of its
will and love—work has been done, and the last great phase of the inward
transmutation accomplished. The self which comes forth from the night is
no separated self, conscious of the illumination of the Uncreated Light,
but the New Man, the transmuted humanity, whose life is *one* with the
Absolute Life of God. “As soon as the two houses of the soul \[the
sensual and the spiritual\],” says St. John of the Cross, “are tranquil
and confirmed and merged in one by this peace, and their servants the
powers, appetites and passions are sunk in deep tranquillity, neither
troubled by things above nor things below, the Divine Wisdom immediately
unites itself to the soul in a new bond of loving possession, and that
is fulfilled which is written in the Book of Wisdom: ‘While all things
were immersed in quiet silence, and the night was in the midway of her
course, Thy omnipotent Word sallied out of heaven from the royal seats’
(<span id="an_iv.ix-p101.1"></span>[Wisdom xviii.
14](../../bib/apo/wis018.htm#014)<span id="an_iv.ix-p101.1"></span>.md).
The same truth is set before us in the Canticle, where the Bride, after
passing by those who took her veil away and wounded her, saith, ‘When I
had a little passed by them I found Him Whom my soul loveth’ (<span
id="an_iv.ix-p101.2"></span>[Cant. iii.
4](../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#004)<span id="an_iv.ix-p101.2"></span>.md).”
 <span id="fr_825"></span>[826](#fn_825.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p103"></span>\* \* \* \* \*

<span id="an_iv.ix-p104"></span><span id="page_403">p. 403</span> <span
id="an_iv.ix-Page_403"></span> So far, we have considered the Dark Night
of the Soul from a somewhat academic point of view. We have tried to
dissect and describe it: have seen it through the medium of literature
rather than life. Such a method has obvious disadvantages when dealing
with any organic process: and when it is applied to the spiritual life
of man, these disadvantages are increased. Moreover, our chief example,
“from the life,” Madame Guyon, valuable as her passion for self analysis
makes her to the student of mystic states cannot be looked upon as a
satisfactory witness. Her morbid sentimentalism, her absurd “spiritual
self-importance” have to be taken into account and constantly remembered
in estimating the value of her psychological descriptions. If we want to
get a true idea of the Dark Night, as an episode in the history of a
living soul, we must see it in its context, as part of that soul’s total
experience. We must study the reactions of a self which is passing
through this stage of development upon its normal environment the
content of its diurnal existence; not only on its intuition of the
Divine.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p105"></span>As a pendant to this chapter, then, we
will look at this “state of pain” as it expressed itself in the life of
a mystic whose ardent, impressionable, and poetic nature reacted to
every aspect of the contemplative experience, every mood and fluctuation
of the soul. I choose this particular case—the case of Suso—(1) because
it contains many interesting and unconventional elements; showing us the
Dark Night not as a series of specific moods and events, but as a phase
of growth largely conditioned by individual temperament: (2) because,
being told at first hand, in the pages of his singularly ingenuous
autobiography, the record is comparatively free from the reverent and
corrupting emendations of the hagiographer.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p106"></span>From the 22nd chapter onwards, Suso’s
“Life” is one of the most valuable documents we possess for the study of
this period of the Mystic Way. We see in it—more clearly perhaps than
its author can have done—the remaking of his consciousness, his
temperamental reactions to the ceaseless travail of his deeper self: so
different in type from those of St. Teresa and Madame Guyon. There is a
note of virile activity about these trials and purifications, an
insistence upon the heroic aspect of the spiritual life, far more
attractive than Madame Guyon’s elaborate discourses on resignation and
holy passivity, or even St. Teresa’s “dark ecstasies” of insatiable
desire.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p107"></span>The chapter in which Suso’s entrance
into this “Second Mystic Life” of deprivation is described is called
“How the Servitor was led into the School of True Resignation.”
Characteristically, this inward experience expressed itself in a series
of dramatic visions; <span id="page_404">p. 404</span> <span
id="an_iv.ix-Page_404"></span> visions of that “dynamic” kind which we
have noticed as a frequent accompaniment of the crisis in which the
mystic self moves to a new level of consciousness.  <span
id="fr_826"></span>[827](#fn_826.md) It followed the long period of
constant mortification and intermittent illumination which lasted, as he
tells us, from his eighteenth to his fortieth year: and constituted the
first cycle of his spiritual life. At the end of that time, “God showed
him that all this severity and these penances were but a good beginning,
that by these he had triumphed over the unruly sensual man: but that now
he must exert himself in another manner if he desired to advance in the
Way.”  <span id="fr_827"></span>[828](#fn_827.md) In two of these
visions—these vivid interior dramas—we seem to see Suso’s developed
mystical consciousness running ahead of its experience, reading the
hidden book of its own future, probing its own spiritual necessities;
and presenting the results to the backward and unwilling surface-mind.
This growing mystic consciousness is already aware of fetters which the
normal Suso does not feel. Its eyes open upon the soul’s true country,
it sees the path which it must tread to perfect freedom; the difference
between the quality of that freedom, and the spirituality which Suso
thinks that he has attained. The first of these visions is that of the
Upper School; the second is that in which he is called to put upon him
the armour of a knight.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p110"></span>“One night after matins, the Servitor
being seated in his chair, and plunged in deep thought, he was rapt from
his senses. And it seemed to him that he saw in a vision a magnificent
young man descend from Heaven before him, and say, “thou hast been long
enough in the Lower School, and hast there sufficiently applied thyself.
Come, then, with me; and I will introduce thee into the highest school
that exists in this world.  <span id="fr_828"></span>[829](#fn_828.md)
There, thou shalt apply thyself to the study of that science which will
procure thee the veritable peace of God; and which will bring thy holy
beginning to a happy end.’ Then the Servitor rose, full of joy; and it
seemed to him that the young man took him by the hand and led him into a
spiritual country, wherein there was a fair house inhabited by spiritual
men: for here lived those who applied themselves to the study of this
science. As soon as he entered it, these received him kindly, and
amiably saluted him. And at once they went to the supreme Master, and
told him that a man was come, who desired to be his disciple and to
learn his science. And he said, ‘Let him <span id="page_405">p.
405</span> <span id="an_iv.ix-Page_405"></span> come before me, that I
may see whether he please me.’ And when the supreme Master saw the
Servitor, he smiled on him very kindly, and said, ‘Know that this guest
is able to become a good disciple of our high science, if he will bear
with patience the hard probation: for it is necessary that he be tried
inwardly.’

<span id="an_iv.ix-p112"></span>“The Servitor did not then understand
these enigmatic words. He turned toward the young man who had brought
him and asked, ‘Well, my dear comrade, what then is this Upper School
and this science of which you have spoken to me?’ The young man replied
thus: ‘In this Upper School they teach the science of Perfect
Self-abandonment; that is to say, that a man is here taught to renounce
himself so utterly that, in all those circumstances in which God is
manifested, either by Himself or in His creatures, the man applies
himself only to remaining calm and unmoved renouncing so far as is
possible all human frailty.’ And shortly after this discourse, the
Servitor came to himself . . . and, talking to himself, he said,
‘Examine thyself inwardly and thou wilt see that thou hast still much
self-will: thou wilt observe, that with all thy mortifications which
thou hast inflicted on thyself, thou canst not yet endure external
vexations. Thou art like a hare hiding in a bush, who is frightened by
the whispering of the leaves. Thou also art frightened every day by the
griefs that come to thee: thou dost turn pale at the sight of those who
speak against thee: when thou doest fear to succumb, thou takest flight;
when thou oughtest to present thyself with simplicity, thou dost hide
thyself. When they praise thee, thou art happy: when they blame thee,
thou art sad. Truly is it very needful for thee that thou shouldst go to
an Upper School.”  <span id="fr_829"></span>[830](#fn_829.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p114"></span>Some weeks later, when he had been
rejoicing in the new bodily comfort which resulted from his
relinquishment of all outward mortifications, Suso received a still more
pointed lesson on his need of moral courage. He was sitting on his bed
and meditating on the words of Job <span id="an_iv.ix-p114.1"></span>
*“Militia est.”* “The life of man upon the earth is like unto that of a
knight”:  <span id="fr_830"></span>[831](#fn_830.md) “and during this
meditation, he was once more rapt from his senses, and it seemed to him
that he saw coming towards him a fair youth of manly bearing, who held
in his hands the spurs and the other apparel which knights are
accustomed to wear. And he drew near to the Servitor, and clothed him in
a coat of mail, and said to him, ‘Oh, knight! hitherto thou hast been
but a squire, but now it is God’s will that thou be raised to
knighthood.’ And the Servitor gazed at his spurs, and said with much
amazement in his heart, ‘Alas, my God! what has befallen me? what have I
become? must I indeed be a knight? I had far rather remain in peace.’
Then he <span id="page_406">p. 406</span> <span
id="an_iv.ix-Page_406"></span> said to the young man, ‘Since it is God’s
will that I should be a knight I had rather have won my spurs in battle;
for this would have been more glorious.’ The young man turned away and
began to laugh: and said to him, ‘Have no fear! thou shalt have battles
enough. He who would play a valiant part in the spiritual chivalry of
God must endure more numerous and more dreadful combats than any which
were encountered by the proud heroes of ancient days, of whom the world
tells and sings the knightly deeds. It is not that God desires to free
thee from thy burdens; He would only change them and make them far
heavier than they have ever been.’ Then the Servitor said, ‘Oh, Lord,
show me my pains in advance, in order that I may know them.’ The Lord
replied, ‘No, it is better that thou know nothing, lest thou shouldst
hesitate. But amongst the innumerable pains which thou wilt have to
support, I will tell thee three. The first is this. Hitherto it is thou
who hast scourged thyself, with thine own hands: thou didst cease when
it seemed good to thee, and thou hadst compassion on thyself. Now, I
would take thee from thyself, and cast thee without defence into the
hands of strangers who shall scourge thee. Thou shalt see the ruin of
thy reputation. Thou shalt be an object of contempt to blinded men; and
thou shalt suffer more from this than from the wounds made by the points
of thy cross.  <span id="fr_831"></span>[832](#fn_831.md) When thou didst
give thyself up to thy penances thou wert exalted and admired. Now thou
shalt be abased and annihilated. The second pain is this: Although thou
didst inflict on thyself many cruel tortures, still by God’s grace there
remained to thee a tender and loving disposition. It shall befall thee,
that there where thou hadst thought to find a special and a faithful
love, thou shalt find nought but unfaithfulness, great sufferings, and
great griefs. Thy trials shall be so many that those men who have any
love for thee shall suffer with thee by compassion. The third pain is
this: hitherto thou hast been but a child at the breast, a spoiled
child. Thou hast been immersed in the divine sweetness like a fish in
the sea. Now I will withdraw all this. It is my will that thou shouldst
be deprived of it, and that thou suffer from this privation, that thou
shouldst be abandoned of God and of man, that thou shouldst be publicly
persecuted by the friends of thine enemies. I will tell it thee in a
word: all thou shalt undertake, that might bring thee joy and
consolation, shall come to nothing, and all that might make thee suffer
and be vexatious to thee shall succeed.’”  <span
id="fr_832"></span>[833](#fn_832.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p118"></span>Observe here, under a highly poetic and
visionary method of presentation, the characteristic pains of the Dark
Night as <span id="page_407">p. 407</span> <span
id="an_iv.ix-Page_407"></span> described by St. John of the Cross,
Madame Guyon, De Caussade and almost every expert who has written upon
this state of consciousness. Desolation and loneliness, abandonment by
God and by man, a tendency of everything to “go wrong,” a profusion of
unsought trials and griefs—all are here. Suso, naturally highly strung,
sensitive and poetic, suffered acutely in this mental chaos and
multiplication of woes. He was tormented by a deep depression so that
“it seemed as though a mountain weighed on his heart” by doubts against
faith: by temptations to despair.  <span
id="fr_833"></span>[834](#fn_833.md) These miseries lasted for about ten
years. They were diversified and intensified by external trials, such as
illnesses and false accusations; and relieved, as the years of purgation
had been, by occasional visions and revelations.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p120"></span>Suso’s natural tendency was to an
enclosed life: to secret asceticism, reverie, outbursts of fervent
devotion, long hours of rapt communion with the Eternal Wisdom whom he
loved. At once artist and recluse, utterly unpractical, he had all the
dreamer’s dread of the world of men. His deeper self now ran counter to
all these preferences. Like the angel which said to him in the hour of
his utmost prostration and misery, <span id="an_iv.ix-p120.1"></span>“
*Viriliter agite!”*  <span id="fr_834"></span>[835](#fn_834.md) it pressed
him inexorably towards the more manly part; pushing him to action,
sending him out from his peaceful if uncomfortable cell to the
rough-and-tumble of the world. Poor Suso was little fitted by nature for
that rough-and-tumble: and a large part of his autobiography is
concerned with the description of all that he endured therein. The Dark
Night for him was emphatically an “active night”; and the more active he
was forced to be, the darker and more painful it became. Chapter after
chapter is filled with the troubles of the unhappy Servitor; who, once
he began to meddle with practical life, soon disclosed his native
simplicity and lost the reputation for wisdom and piety which he had
gained during his years of seclusion.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p122"></span>There was not in Suso that high-hearted
gaiety, that child-like courage, which made the early Franciscans
delight to call themselves God’s fools. The bewildered lover of the
Eternal Wisdom suffered acutely from his loss of dignity; from the
unfriendliness and contempt of other men. He gives a long and dismal
catalogue of the enemies that he made, the slanders which he endured, in
the slow acquirement of that disinterested and knightly valour which had
been revealed to him as the essential virtue of the squire who would
“ride with the Eternal Wisdom in the lists.”  <span
id="fr_835"></span>[836](#fn_835.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p124"></span>Suso was a born romantic. This dream of
a spiritual chivalry <span id="page_408">p. 408</span> <span
id="an_iv.ix-Page_408"></span> haunts him: again and again he uses the
language of the tournament in his description of the mystic life. Yet
perhaps few ideals seem less appropriate to this timid, highly-strung,
unpractical Dominican friar: this ecstatic “minnesinger of the Holy
Ghost,” half-poet, half-metaphysician, racked by ill-health, exalted by
mystical ardours, instinctively fearing the harsh contact of his
fellow-men.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p125"></span>There is no grim endurance about Suso:
he feels every hard knock, and all the instincts of his nature are in
favour of telling his griefs. A more human transcendentalist has never
lived. Thanks to the candour and completeness with which he takes his
readers into his confidence, we know him far more intimately than we do
any of the other great contemplatives. There is one chapter in his life
in which he describes with the utmost ingenuousness how he met a
magnificent knight whilst crossing the Lake of Constance; and was deeply
impressed by his enthusiastic descriptions of the glories and dangers of
the lists. The conversation between the tough man at arms and the
hypersensitive mystic is full of revealing touches. Suso is exalted and
amazed by the stories of hard combats, the courage of the knights, and
the ring for which they contend: but most astounded by the fortitude
which pays no attention to its wounds.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p126"></span>“And may not one weep, and show that one
is hurt, when one is hit very hard?” he says.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p127"></span>The knight replies, “No, even though
one’s heart fails, as happens to many, one must never show that one is
distressed. One must appear gay and happy; otherwise one is dishonoured,
and loses at the same time one’s reputation and the Ring.”

<span id="an_iv.ix-p128"></span>“These words made the Servitor
thoughtful; and he was greatly moved, and inwardly sighing he said, ‘Oh
Lord, if the knights of this world must suffer so much to obtain so
small a prize, how just it is that we should suffer far more if we are
to obtain an eternal recompense! Oh, my sweet Lord, if only I were
worthy of being Thy spiritual knight!”

<span id="an_iv.ix-p129"></span>Arrived at his destination, however,
Suso was visited by fresh trials: and soon forgetting his valiant
declarations, he began as usual to complain of his griefs. The result
was a visionary ecstasy, in which he heard the voice of that deeper self
to which he always attributed a divine validity, inquiring with
ill-concealed irony, “Well, what has become of that noble chivalry? Who
is this knight of straw, this rag-made man? It is not by making rash
promises and drawing back when suffering comes, that men win the Ring of
Eternity which you desire.”

<span id="an_iv.ix-p130"></span>“Alas! Lord,” said Suso plaintively,
“the tournaments in which one must suffer for Thee last such a very long
time!” <span id="page_409">p. 409</span> <span
id="an_iv.ix-Page_409"></span>

<span id="an_iv.ix-p131"></span>The voice replied, “But the reward, the
honour, and the Ring which I give to My knights endure for ever.”  <span
id="fr_836"></span>[837](#fn_836.md)

<span id="an_iv.ix-p140"></span>As his mystic consciousness grew, the
instinct pressing him towards action and endurance grew with it. The
inner voice and its visionary expression urged him on remorselessly. It
mocked his weakness, encouraged him to more active suffering, more
complete self-renunciation: more contact with the unfriendly world.
*Viriliter agile!* He must be a complete personality; a whole man.
Instead of the quiet cell, the secret mortifications, his selfhood was
to be stripped from him, and the reality of his renunciation tested,
under the unsympathetic and often inimical gaze of other men. The case
of Suso is one that may well give pause to those who regard the mystic
life as a progress in passivity, withdrawal from the actual world: and
the “Dark Night” as one of its most morbid manifestations.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p141"></span>It is interesting to observe how
completely human and apparently “unmystical” was the culminating trial
by which Suso was “perfected in the school of true resignation.” “None
can come to the sublime heights of the divinity,” said the Eternal
Wisdom to him in one of his visions, “or taste its ineffable sweetness,
if first they have not experienced the bitterness and lowliness of My
humanity. The higher they climb without passing by My humanity, the
lower afterward shall be their fall. My humanity is the road which all
must tread who would come to that which thou seekest: My sufferings are
the door by which all must come in.”  <span
id="fr_837"></span>[838](#fn_837.md) It was by the path of humanity; by
some of the darkest and most bitter trials of human experience, the
hardest tests of its patience and love, that Suso “came in” to that
sustained peace of heart and union with the divine will which marked his
last state. The whole tendency of these trials in the “path of humanity”
seems, as we look at them, to be directed towards the awakening of those
elements of character left dormant by the rather specialized disciplines
and purifications of his cloistered life. We seem to see the “new man”
invading all the resistant or inactive corners of personality: the
Servitor of Wisdom being pressed against his will to a deeply and widely
human life in the interests of Eternal <span id="page_410">p. 410</span>
<span id="an_iv.ix-Page_410"></span> Love. The absence of God whom he
loved, the enmity of man whom he feared, were the chief forces brought
to play upon him: and we watch his slow growth, under their tonic
influence, in courage, humility, and fraternal love.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p143"></span>Few chapters in the history of the
mystics are more touching than that passage in Suso’s Life.  <span
id="fr_838"></span>[839](#fn_838.md) “Where we speak of an extraordinary
Trial which the Servitor had to bear.” It tells how a malicious woman
accused him of being the father of her child, and succeeded for the time
in entirely destroying his reputation. “And the scandal was all the
greater,” says the Servitor with his customary simplicity “because the
rumour of that brother’s sanctity had spread so far.” Poor Suso was
utterly crushed by this calumny, “wounded to the depths of his heart.”
“Lord, Lord!” he cried, “every day of my life I have worshipped Thy holy
Name in many places, and have helped to cause it to be loved and
honoured by many men: and now Thou wouldst drag my name through the
mud!” When the scandal was at its height, a woman of the neighbourhood
came to him in secret; and offered to destroy the child which was the
cause of this gossip, in order that the tale might be more quickly
forgotten and his reputation restored. She said further that unless the
baby were somehow disposed of, he would certainly be forced by public
opinion to accept it, and provide for its upbringing. Suso, writhing as
he was under the contempt of the whole neighbourhood, the apparent ruin
of his career—knowing, too, that this slander of one of their leaders
must gravely injure the reputation of the Friends of God—was able to
meet the temptation with a noble expression of trust. “I have confidence
in the God of Heaven, Who is rich, and Who has given me until now all
that which was needful unto me. He will help me to keep, if need be,
another beside myself.” And then he said to his temptress, “Go, fetch
the little child that I may see it.”

<span id="an_iv.ix-p145"></span>“And when he had the baby, he put it on
his knees and looked at it: and the baby began to smile at him. And
sighing deeply, he said, ‘Could I kill a pretty baby that smiled at me?
No, no, I had rather suffer every trial that could come upon me!” And
turning his face to the unfortunate little creature, he said to it, ‘Oh
my poor, poor little one! Thou art but an unhappy orphan, for thy
unnatural father hath denied thee, thy wicked mother would cast thee
off, as one casts off a little dog that has ceased to please! The
providence of God hath given thee to me, in order that I may be thy
father. I wilt accept thee, then, from Him and from none else. Ah, dear
child of my heart, thou liest on my knees; thou dost gaze at me, thou
canst not yet speak! As for me, I contemplate <span id="page_411">p.
411</span> <span id="an_iv.ix-Page_411"></span> thee with a broken
heart; with weeping eyes, and lips that kiss, I bedew thy little face
with my burning tears! . . . Thou shalt be my son, and the child of the
good God; and as long as heaven gives me a mouthful, I shall share it
with thee, for the greater glory of God; and will patiently support all
the trials that may come to me, my darling son!’” How different is this
from the early Suso; interested in little but his own safe spirituality,
and with more than a touch of the religious aesthete!

<span id="an_iv.ix-p146"></span>The story goes on: “And when the
hard-hearted woman who had wished to kill the little one saw these
tears, when she heard these tender words, she was greatly moved: and her
heart was filled with pity, and she too began to weep and cry aloud. The
Servitor was obliged to calm her, for fear that, attracted by the noise,
some one should come and see what was going on. And when she had
finished weeping the Brother gave her back the baby and blessed it, and
said to it, ‘Now may God in His goodness bless thee, and may the saints
protect thee against all evil that may be!’ And he enjoined the woman to
care for it well at his expense.”

<span id="an_iv.ix-p147"></span>Small wonder that after this heroic act
of charity Suso’s reputation went from bad to worse; that even his
dearest friends forsook him, and he narrowly escaped expulsion from the
religious life. His torments and miseries, his fears for the future,
continued to grow until they at last came to their term in a sort of
mental crisis. “His feeble nature broken by the pains which he had to
endure, he went forth raving like one who has lost his sense and hid
himself in a place far from men, where none could see or hear him . . .
and whilst he suffered thus, several times something which came from God
said within his soul, ‘Where then is your resignation? Where is that
equal humour in joy and in tribulation which you have so lightly taught
other men to love? In what manner is it, then, that one should rest in
God and have confidence only in Him?’ He replied weeping, ‘You ask where
is my resignation? But tell me first, where is the infinite pity of God
for His friends? . . . Oh Fathomless Abyss! come to my help, for without
Thee I am lost. Thou knowest that Thou art my only consolation, that all
my trust is only in Thee. Oh hear me, for the love of God, all you whose
hearts are wounded! Behold! let none be scandalized by my insane
behaviour. So long as it was only a question of preaching resignation,
that was easy: but now that my heart is pierced, now that I am wounded
to the marrow . . . how can I be resigned?’ And after thus suffering
half a day, his brain was exhausted, and at last he became calmer, and
sitting down he came to himself: and turning to God, and abandoning
himself to His Will, he said, ‘If it cannot be otherwise, <span
id="an_iv.ix-p147.1"></span> *fiat* <span id="page_412">p. 412</span>
<span id="an_iv.ix-Page_412"></span> *voluntas tua* *.’”* <span
id="an_iv.ix-p147.3"></span> *<span id="an_iv.ix-p147.4"></span> <span
id="an_iv.ix-p147.5"></span> **<span
id="an_iv.ix-p147.6"></span>\[840\]*** The act of submission was at once
followed by an ecstasy and vision, in which the approaching end of his
troubles was announced to him. “And in the event, God came to the help
of the Servitor, and little by little that terrible tempest died away.”

<span id="an_iv.ix-p148"></span>Thus with Suso, as with St. Catherine of
Siena and other mystics whom we have considered, the travail of the Dark
Night is all directed towards the essential mystic act of utter
self-surrender; that <span id="an_iv.ix-p148.1"></span> *fiat voluntas
tua* which marks the death of selfhood in the interests of a new and
deeper life. He has learned the lesson of “the school of true
resignation”: has moved to a new stage of reality: a complete
self-naughting, an utter acquiescence in the large and hidden purposes
of the Divine Will.

> <span id="an_iv.ix-p148.2"></span> “Anzi è formale ad esto beato
> *esse*  
> tenersi dentro alla divina voglia  
> per ch’ una fansi nostre voglie stesse,”  <span
> id="fr_839"></span>[840](#fn_839.md)  

<span id="an_iv.ix-p150"></span>says Piccarda, announcing the primary
law of Paradise. Suso has passed through the fire to the state in which
he too can say, *“La sua voluntate è nostre pace.”* The old grouping of
his consciousness round “spiritual self” has come to its head and at
last broken down. In the midst of a psychic storm parallel to the
upheavals of conversion, “mercenary love” is for ever disestablished,
the new state of Pure Love is abruptly established in its place. Human
pain is the price: the infinite joy peculiar to “free souls” is the
reward. We may study the pain, but the nature of the joy is beyond us:
as, in the Absolute Type of all mystic achievement, we see the cross
clearly but can hardly guess at the true nature of the resurrection
life.

<span id="an_iv.ix-p151"></span>Hence Suso’s description of his
establishment in the Unitive Way seems meagre, an anti-climax, after all
that went before. “And later,” he says simply, “when God judged that it
was time, He rewarded the poor martyr for all his suffering. And he
enjoyed peace of heart, and received in tranquillity and quietness many
precious graces. And he praised the Lord from the very depths of his
soul, and thanked Him for those same sufferings: which, for all the
world, he would not now have been spared. And God caused him to
understand that by this complete abasement he had gained more, and was
made the more worthy to be raised up to God, than by all the pains which
he had suffered from his youth up to that time.”  <span
