## <span id="an_i_1-p0.1"></span>PREFACE TO THE TWELFTH EDITION

<span id="an_i_1-p1"></span> <span id="an_i_1-p1.1"></span>Since this
book first appeared, nineteen years ago, the study of mysticism—not only
in England, but also in France, Germany and Italy—has been almost
completely transformed. From being regarded, whether critically or
favourably, as a byway of religion, it is now more and more generally
accepted by theologians, philosophers and psychologists, as representing
in its intensive form the essential religious experience of man. The
labours of a generation of religious psychologists—following, and to
some extent superseding the pioneer work of William James—have already
done much to disentangle its substance from the psycho-physical
accidents which often accompany mystical apprehension. Whilst we are
less eager than our predecessors to dismiss all accounts of abnormal
experience as the fruit of superstition or disease, no responsible
student now identifies the mystic and the ecstatic; or looks upon
visionary and other “extraordinary phenomena” as either guaranteeing or
discrediting the witness of the mystical saints. Even the remorseless
explorations and destructive criticisms of the psycho-analytic school
are now seen to have effected a useful work; throwing into relief the
genuine spiritual activities of the psyche, while explaining in a
naturalistic sense some of their less fortunate psycho-physical
accompaniments. The philosophic and theological landscape also, with its
increasing emphasis on Transcendence, its new friendliness to the
concept of the Supernatural, is becoming ever more favourable to the
metaphysical claims of the mystics. On one hand the prompt welcome given
to the work of Rudolf Otto and Karl Barth, on the other the renewed
interest in Thomist philosophy, seem to indicate a growing recognition
of the distinctness and independence of the Spiritual Order. and a
revival <span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span> <span
id="an_i_1-Page_xiv"></span> of the creaturely sense, strongly
contrasting with the temper of late nineteenth-century thought.

<span id="an_i_1-p2"></span>Were I, then, now planning this book for the
first time, its arguments would be differently stated. More emphasis
would be given (a) to the concrete, richly living yet unchanging
character of the Reality over against the mystic, as the first term,
cause and incentive of his experience; (b) to that paradox of utter
contrast yet profound relation between the Creator and the creature, God
and the soul, which makes possible his development; (c) to the
predominant part played in that development by the free and prevenient
action of the Supernatural—in theological language, by “grace”—as
against all merely evolutionary or emergent theories of spiritual
transcendence. I feel more and more that no psychological or
evolutionary treatment of man’s spiritual history can be adequate which
ignores the element of “given-ness” in all genuine mystical knowledge.
Though the mystic Life means organic growth, its first term must be
sought in ontology; in the Vision of the Principle, as St. Gregory the
Great taught long ago. For the real sanction of that life does not
inhere in the fugitive experiences or even the transformed personality
of the subject; but in the metaphysical Object which that subject
apprehends.

<span id="an_i_1-p3"></span>Again, it now seems to me that a critical
realism, which found room for the duality of our full human
experience—the Eternal and the Successive, supernatural and natural
reality—would provide a better philosophic background to the experience
of the mystics than the vitalism which appeared, twenty years ago, to
offer so promising a way of escape from scientific determinism.
Determinism—more and more abandoned by its old friends the physicists—is
no longer the chief enemy to such a spiritual interpretation of life as
is required by the experience of the mystics. It is rather a
naturalistic monism, a shallow doctrine of immanence unbalanced by any
adequate sense of transcendence, which now threatens to re-model
theology in a sense which leaves no room for the noblest and purest
reaches of the spiritual life.

<span id="an_i_1-p4"></span>Yet in spite of the adjustments required by
such a shifting at the philosophic outlook, and by nearly twenty years
of further <span id="page_xv">p. xv</span> <span
id="an_i_1-Page_xv"></span> study and meditation, the final positions
which seem to me to be required by the existence of mysticism remain
substantially unchanged. Twenty years ago, I was already convinced that
the facts of man’s spiritual experience pointed to a limited dualism; a
diagram which found place for his contrasting apprehension of Absolute
and Contingent, Being and Becoming, Simultaneous and Successive.
Further, that these facts involved the existence in him too of a certain
doubleness, a higher and lower, natural and transcendental
self—something equivalent to that “Funklein” spark, or apex of the soul
on which the mystics have always insisted as the instrument of their
special experience. Both these opinions were then unpopular. The second,
in particular, has been severely criticized by Professor Pratt and other
authorities on the psychology of religion. Yet the constructive work
which has since been done on the metaphysical implications of mystical
experience has tended more and more to establish their necessity, at
least as a basis of analysis; and they can now claim the most
distinguished support.

<span id="an_i_1-p5"></span>The recovery of the concept of the
Supernatural—a word which no respectable theologian of the last
generation cared to use—is closely linked with the great name of
Friedrich von Hügel. His persistent opposition to all merely monistic,
pantheist and immanental philosophies of religion, and his insistence on
the need of a “two-step diagram” of the Reality accessible to man,
though little heeded in his life-time, are now bearing fruit. This
re-instatement of the Transcendent, the “Wholly Other,” as *the*
religious fact, is perhaps the most fundamental of the philosophic
changes which have directly affected the study of mysticism. It thus
obtains a metaphysical background which harmonizes with its greatest
declarations, and supports its claim to empirical knowledge of the Truth
on which all religion rests. Closely connected with the transcendence of
its Object, are the twin doctrines emphasized in all Von Hügel’s work.
First, that while mysticism is an essential element in full human
religion, it can never be the whole content of such religion. It
requires to be embodied in some degree in history, dogma and
institutions if it is to reach the sense-conditioned human mind.
Secondly, that the antithesis between the religions of “authority” and
of <span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span> <span id="an_i_1-Page_xvi"></span>
“spirit,” the “Church” and the “mystic,” is false. Each requires the
other. The “exclusive” mystic, who condemns all outward forms and
rejects the support of the religious complex, is an abnormality. He
inevitably tends towards pantheism, and seldom exhibits in its richness
the Unitive Life. It is the “inclusive” mystic, whose freedom and
originality are fed but not hampered by the spiritual tradition within
which he appears, who accepts the incarnational status of the human
spirit, and can “find the inward in the outward as well as the inward in
the inward,” who shows us in their fullness and beauty the life-giving
possibilities of the soul transfigured in God.

<span id="an_i_1-p6"></span>Second in importance among the changes which
have come over the study of mysticism, I should reckon the work done
during the last decade upon the psychology of prayer and contemplation.
I cannot comment here upon the highly technical discussions between
experts as to the place where the line is to be drawn between “natural”
and “supernatural,” “active” and “infused” operations of the soul in
communion with God; or the exact distinction between “ordinary” and
“extraordinary” contemplation. But the fact that these discussions have
taken place is itself significant; and requires from religious
psychology the acknowledgement of a genuine two-foldness in human
nature—the difference in kind between *Animus* the surface-self and
*Anima* the transcendental self, in touch with supernatural realities.
Here, the most important work has been done in France; and especially by
the Abbé Bremond, whose “Prière et Poésie” and “Introduction a la
Philosophie de la Prière”—based on a vast acquaintance with mystical
literature—mark, I believe, the beginning of a new understanding of the
character of contemplation. The Thomist philosophy of Maritain, and the
psychological researches of Maréchal, tend to support this developing
view of the mystical experience, even in its elementary forms, as an
activity of the transcendental self; genuinely supernatural, yet not
necessarily involving any abnormal manifestations, and linked by the
ascending “degrees of prayer” with the subject’s “ordinary” religious
life. This disentangling of the substance of mysticism from the
psycho-physical accidents of trance, ecstasy, vision and other abnormal
phenomena which often <span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span> <span
id="an_i_1-Page_xvii"></span> accompany it, and its vindication as
something which gives the self a genuine knowledge of transcendental
Reality—with its accompanying demonstration of the soberness and sanity
of the greatest contemplative saints—is the last of the beneficent
changes which have transformed our study of the mystics. In this country
it is identified with the work of two Benedictine scholars; Abbot
Chapman of Downside and Dom Cuthbert Butler, whose “Western Mysticism”
is a masterly exhibition of the religious and psychological normality of
the Christian contemplative life, as developed by its noblest
representatives.

<span id="an_i_1-p7"></span>Since this book was written, our knowledge
of the mystics has been much extended by the appearance of critical
texts of many writings which had only been known to us in garbled
versions; or in translations made with an eye to edification rather than
accuracy. Thus the publication of the authentic revelations of Angela of
Foligno—one of the most interesting discoveries of recent years—has
disclosed the unsuspected splendour of her mystical experience. The
critical texts of St. Teresa and St. John of the Cross which are now
available amend previous versions in many important respects. We have
reliable editions of Tauler and Ruysbroeck; of “The Cloud of Unknowing,”
and of Walter Hilton’s works. The renewed interest in
seventeenth-century mysticism, due in part to the Abbé Bremond’s great
work, has resulted in the publication of many of its documents. So too
the literary, social and historical links between the mystics, the
influence of environment, the great part played by forgotten spiritual
movements and inarticulate saints, are beginning to be better
understood. Advantage has been taken of these facts in preparing the
present edition. All quotations from the mystics have been revised by
comparison with the best available texts. The increased size of the
historical appendix and bibliography is some indication of the mass of
fresh material which is now at the disposal of students; material which
must be examined with truth-loving patience, with sympathy, and above
all with humility, by those who desire to make valid additions to our
knowledge of the conditions under which the human spirit has communion
with God.
