Evelyn Underhill (b. 6 Dec. 1875, d. 15 Jun 1941) was an English
Anglo-Catholic writer who wrote extensively on Christian mysticism. A
pacifist, novelist, and philosopher, she was widely read during the
first half of the 20th century. This work, Mysticism, is not a textbook
of the subject. She disagrees with William James' [The Varieties of
Religious Experience](../../etc/vre/index.md) with his four-part division
of the mystic state (ineffability, noetic quality, transcience, and
passivity). She sees Bucke's [Cosmic Consciousness](../../eso/cc/index.md)
as only the gateway to Unitative Living, about halfway there by her view
(p. 193).

Underhill maps out her own view of the mystic's journey into five parts:
"Awakening of Self," "Purgation of Self," "Illumination," "the Dark
Night of the Soul," and "the Unitative life." Underhill is focussed on
mysticism in Christianity but she also mentions Sufism, Hinduism,
Buddhism, and other belief systems. This has long been considered a
crucial work on the subject of Mysticism, and continues to guide seekers
a century later.--J.B. Hare
