<HR><CENTER><H1>Shri Guru Granth Sahib: Shalok, Ninth Mehl</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><H2>Section 44 - Shalok, Ninth Mehl - Part 001</H2></CENTER>
 Those whom He saves, meditate in remembrance on the Creator Lord. ||15||<BR>
 Forsake duality and the ways of evil; focus your consciousness on the One Lord.<BR>
 In the love of duality, O Nanak, the mortals are being washed downstream. ||16||<BR>
 In the markets and bazaars of the three qualities, the merchants make their deals.<BR>
 Those who load the true merchandise are the true traders. ||17||<BR>
 Those who do not know the way of love are foolish; they wander lost and confused.<BR>
 O Nanak, forgetting the Lord, they fall into the deep, dark pit of hell. ||18||<BR>
 In his mind, the mortal does not forget Maya; he begs for more and more wealth.<BR>
 That God does not even come into his consciousness; O Nanak, it is not in his karma. ||19||<BR>
 The mortal does not run out of capital, as long as the Lord Himself is merciful.<BR>
 The Word of the Shabad is Guru Nanak's inexhaustible treasure; this wealth and capital never runs out, no matter how much it is spent and consumed. ||20||<BR>
 If I could find wings for sale, I would buy them with an equal weight of my flesh.<BR>
 I would attach them to my body, and seek out and find my Friend. ||21||<BR>
 My Friend is the True Supreme King, the King over the heads of kings.<BR>
 Sitting by His side, we are exalted and beautified; He is the Support of all. ||22||<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Shalok, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 If you do not sing the Praises of the Lord, your life is rendered useless.<BR>
 Says Nanak, meditate, vibrate upon the Lord; immerse your mind in Him, like the fish in the water. ||1||<BR>
 Why are you engrossed in sin and corruption? You are not detached, even for a moment!<BR>
 Says Nanak, meditate, vibrate upon the Lord, and you shall not be caught in the noose of death. ||2||<BR>
 Your youth has passed away like this, and old age has overtaken your body.<BR>
 Says Nanak, meditate, vibrate upon the Lord; your life is fleeting away! ||3||<BR>
 You have become old, and you do not understand that death is overtaking you.<BR>
 Says Nanak, you are insane! Why do you not remember and meditate on God? ||4||<BR>
 Your wealth, spouse, and all the possessions which you claim as your own<BR>
 - none of these shall go along with you in the end. O Nanak, know this as true. ||5||<BR>
 He is the Saving Grace of sinners, the Destroyer of fear, the Master of the masterless.<BR>
 Says Nanak, realize and know Him, who is always with you. ||6||<BR>
 He has given you your body and wealth, but you are not in love with Him.<BR>
 Says Nanak, you are insane! Why do you now shake and tremble so helplessly? ||7||<BR>
 He has given you your body, wealth, property, peace and beautiful mansions.<BR>
 Says Nanak, listen, mind: why don't you remember the Lord in meditation? ||8||<BR>
 The Lord is the Giver of all peace and comfort. There is no other at all.<BR>
 Says Nanak, listen, mind: meditating in remembrance on Him, salvation is attained. ||9||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 44 - Shalok, Ninth Mehl - Part 002</H2></CENTER>
 Remembering Him in meditation, salvation is attained; vibrate and meditate on Him, O my friend.<BR>
 Says Nanak, listen, mind: your life is passing away! ||10||<BR>
 Your body is made up of the five elements; you are clever and wise - know this well.<BR>
 Believe it - you shall merge once again into the One, O Nanak, from whom you originated. ||11||<BR>
 The Dear Lord abides in each and every heart; the Saints proclaim this as true.<BR>
 Says Nanak, meditate and vibrate upon Him, and you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||12||<BR>
 One who is not touched by pleasure or pain, greed, emotional attachment and egotistical pride<BR>
 - says Nanak, listen, mind: he is the very image of God. ||13||<BR>
 One who is beyond praise and slander, who looks upon gold and iron alike<BR>
 - says Nanak, listen, mind: know that such a person is liberated. ||14||<BR>
 One who is not affected by pleasure or pain, who looks upon friend and enemy alike<BR>
 - says Nanak, listen, mind: know that such a person is liberated. ||15||<BR>
 One who does not frighten anyone, and who is not afraid of anyone else<BR>
 - says Nanak, listen, mind: call him spiritually wise. ||16||<BR>
 One who has forsaken all sin and corruption, who wears the robes of neutral detachment<BR>
 - says Nanak, listen, mind: good destiny is written on his forehead. ||17||<BR>
 One who renounces Maya and possessiveness and is detached from everything<BR>
 - says Nanak, listen, mind: God abides in his heart. ||18||<BR>
 That mortal, who forsakes egotism, and realizes the Creator Lord<BR>
 - says Nanak, that person is liberated; O mind, know this as true. ||19||<BR>
 In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Name of the Lord is the Destroyer of fear, the Eradicator of evil-mindedness.<BR>
 Night and day, O Nanak, whoever vibrates and meditates on the Lord's Name, sees all of his works brought to fruition. ||20||<BR>
 Vibrate with your tongue the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe; with your ears, hear the Lord's Name.<BR>
 Says Nanak, listen, man: you shall not have to go to the house of Death. ||21||<BR>
 That mortal who renounces possessiveness, greed, emotional attachment and egotism<BR>
 - says Nanak, he himself is saved, and he saves many others as well. ||22||<BR>
 Like a dream and a show, so is this world, you must know.<BR>
 None of this is true, O Nanak, without God. ||23||<BR>
 Night and day, for the sake of Maya, the mortal wanders constantly.<BR>
 Among millions, O Nanak, there is scarcely anyone, who keeps the Lord in his consciousness. ||24||<BR>
 As the bubbles in the water well up and disappear again,<BR>
 so is the universe created; says Nanak, listen, O my friend! ||25||<BR>
 The mortal does not remember the Lord, even for a moment; he is blinded by the wine of Maya.<BR>
 Says Nanak, without meditating on the Lord, he is caught by the noose of Death. ||26||<BR>
 If you yearn for eternal peace, then seek the Sanctuary of the Lord.<BR>
 Says Nanak, listen, mind: this human body is difficult to obtain. ||27||<BR>
 For the sake of Maya, the fools and ignorant people run all around.<BR>
 Says Nanak, without meditating on the Lord, life passes away uselessly. ||28||<BR>
 That mortal who meditates and vibrates upon the Lord night and day - know him to be the embodiment of the Lord.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 44 - Shalok, Ninth Mehl - Part 003</H2></CENTER>
 There is no difference between the Lord and the humble servant of the Lord; O Nanak, know this as true. ||29||<BR>
 The mortal is entangled in Maya; he has forgotten the Name of the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 Says Nanak, without meditating on the Lord, what is the use of this human life? ||30||<BR>
 The mortal does not think of the Lord; he is blinded by the wine of Maya.<BR>
 Says Nanak, without meditating on the Lord, he is caught in the noose of Death. ||31||<BR>
 In good times, there are many companions around, but in bad times, there is no one at all.<BR>
 Says Nanak, vibrate, and meditate on the Lord; He shall be your only Help and Support in the end. ||32||<BR>
 Mortals wander lost and confused through countless lifetimes; their fear of death is never removed.<BR>
 Says Nanak, vibrate and meditate on the Lord, and you shall dwell in the Fearless Lord. ||33||<BR>
 I have tried so many things, but the pride of my mind has not been dispelled.<BR>
 I am engrossed in evil-mindedness, Nanak. O God, please save me! ||34||<BR>
 Childhood, youth and old age - know these as the three stages of life.<BR>
 Says Nanak, without meditating on the Lord, everything is useless; you must appreciate this. ||35||<BR>
 You have not done what you should have done; you are entangled in the web of greed.<BR>
 Nanak, your time is past and gone; why are you crying now, you blind fool? ||36||<BR>
 The mind is absorbed in Maya - it cannot escape it, my friend.<BR>
 Nanak, it is like a picture painted on the wall - it cannot leave it. ||37||<BR>
 The man wishes for something, but something different happens.<BR>
 He plots to deceive others, O Nanak, but he places the noose around his own neck instead. ||38||<BR>
 People make all sorts of efforts to find peace and pleasure, but no one tries to earn pain.<BR>
 Says Nanak, listen, mind: whatever pleases God comes to pass. ||39||<BR>
 The world wanders around begging, but the Lord is the Giver of all.<BR>
 Says Nanak, meditate in remembrance on Him, and all your works will be successful. ||40||<BR>
 Why do you take such false pride in yourself? You must know that the world is just a dream.<BR>
 None of this is yours; Nanak proclaims this truth. ||41||<BR>
 You are so proud of your body; it shall perish in an instant, my friend.<BR>
 That mortal who chants the Praises of the Lord, O Nanak, conquers the world. ||42||<BR>
 That person, who meditates in remembrance on the Lord in his heart, is liberated - know this well.<BR>
 There is no difference between that person and the Lord: O Nanak, accept this as the Truth. ||43||<BR>
 That person, who does not feel devotion to God in his mind<BR>
 - O Nanak, know that his body is like that of a pig, or a dog. ||44||<BR>
 A dog never abandons the home of his master.<BR>
 O Nanak, in just the same way, vibrate, and meditate on the Lord, single-mindedly, with one-pointed consciousness. ||45||<BR>
 Those who make pilgrimages to sacred shrines, observe ritualistic fasts and make donations to charity while still taking pride in their minds<BR>
 - O Nanak, their actions are useless, like the elephant, who takes a bath, and then rolls in the dust. ||46||<BR>
 The head shakes, the feet stagger, and the eyes become dull and weak.<BR>
 Says Nanak, this is your condition. And even now, you have not savored the sublime essence of the Lord. ||47||<BR>
