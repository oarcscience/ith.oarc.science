<HR><CENTER><H1>Shri Guru Granth Sahib: Raag Bhairao</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 001</H2></CENTER>
 Raag Bhairao, First Mehl, First House, Chau-Padas:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<BR>
 Without You, nothing happens.<BR>
 You create the creatures, and gazing on them, you know them. ||1||<BR>
 What can I say? I cannot say anything.<BR>
 Whatever exists, is by Your Will. ||Pause||<BR>
 Whatever is to be done, rests with You.<BR>
 Unto whom should I offer my prayer? ||2||<BR>
 I speak and hear the Bani of Your Word.<BR>
 You Yourself know all Your Wondrous Play. ||3||<BR>
 You Yourself act, and inspire all to act; only You Yourself know.<BR>
 Says Nanak, You, Lord, see, establish and disestablish. ||4||1||<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Raag Bhairao, First Mehl, Second House:<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, so many silent sages have been saved; Indra and Brahma have also been saved.<BR>
 Sanak, Sanandan and many humble men of austerity, by Guru's Grace, have been carried across to the other side. ||1||<BR>
 Without the Word of the Shabad, how can anyone cross over the terrifying world-ocean?<BR>
 Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the world is entangled in the disease of duality, and is drowned, drowned, and dies. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Guru is Divine; the Guru is Inscrutable and Mysterious. Serving the Guru, the three worlds are known and understood.<BR>
 The Guru, the Giver, has Himself given me the Gift; I have obtained the Inscrutable, Mysterious Lord. ||2||<BR>
 The mind is the king; the mind is appeased and satisfied through the mind itself, and desire is stilled in the mind.<BR>
 The mind is the Yogi, the mind wastes away in separation from the Lord; singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the mind is instructed and reformed. ||3||<BR>
 How very rare are those in this world who, through the Guru, subdue their minds, and contemplate the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 O Nanak, our Lord and Master is All-pervading; through the True Word of the Shabad, we are emancipated. ||4||1||2||<BR>
 Bhairao, First Mehl:<BR>
 The eyes lose their sight, and the body withers away; old age overtakes the mortal, and death hangs over his head.<BR>
 Beauty, loving attachment and the pleasures of life are not permanent. How can anyone escape from the noose of death? ||1||<BR>
 O mortal, meditate on the Lord - your life is passing away!<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 002</H2></CENTER>
 Without the True Word of the Shabad, you shall never be released, and your life shall be totally useless. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Within the body are sexual desire, anger, egotism and attachment. This pain is so great, and so difficult to endure.<BR>
 As Gurmukh, chant the Lord's Name, and savor it with your tongue; in this way, you shall cross over to the other side. ||2||<BR>
 Your ears are deaf, and your intellect is worthless, and still, you do not intuitively understand the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh wastes this priceless human life and loses it. Without the Guru, the blind person cannot see. ||3||<BR>
 Whoever remains detached and free of desire in the midst of desire - and whoever, unattached, intuitively meditates on the Celestial Lord<BR>
 - prays Nanak, as Gurmukh, he is released. He is lovingly attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||||2||3||<BR>
 Bhairao, First Mehl:<BR>
 His walk becomes weak and clumsy, his feet and hands shake, and the skin of his body is withered and wrinkled.<BR>
 His eyes are dim, his ears are deaf, and yet, the self-willed manmukh does not know the Naam. ||1||<BR>
 O blind man, what have you obtained by coming into the world?<BR>
 The Lord is not in your heart, and you do not serve the Guru. After wasting your capital, you shall have to depart. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Your tongue is not imbued with the Love of the Lord; whatever you say is tasteless and insipid.<BR>
 You indulge in slander of the Saints; becoming a beast, you shall never be noble. ||2||<BR>
 Only a few obtain the sublime essence of the Ambrosial Amrit, united in Union with the True Guru.<BR>
 As long as the mortal does not come to understand the mystery of the Shabad, the Word of God, he shall continue to be tormented by death. ||3||<BR>
 Whoever finds the door of the One True Lord, does not know any other house or door.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, I have obtained the supreme status; so says poor Nanak. ||4||3||4||<BR>
 Bhairao, First Mehl:<BR>
 He spends the entire night in sleep; the noose is tied around his neck. His day is wasted in worldly entanglements.<BR>
 He does not know God, who created this world, for a moment, for even an instant. ||1||<BR>
 O mortal, how will you escape this terrible disaster?<BR>
 What did you bring with you, and what will you take away? Meditate on the Lord, the Most Worthy and Generous Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The heart-lotus of the self-willed manmukh is upside-down; his intellect is shallow; his mind is blind, and his head is entangled in worldly affairs.<BR>
 Death and re-birth constantly hang over your head; without the Name, your neck shall be caught in the noose. ||2||<BR>
 Your steps are unsteady, and your eyes are blind; you are not aware of the Word of the Shabad, O Sibling of Destiny.<BR>
 The Shaastras and the Vedas keep the mortal bound to the three modes of Maya, and so he performs his deeds blindly. ||3||<BR>
 He loses his capital - how can he earn any profit? The evil-minded person has no spiritual wisdom at all.<BR>
 Contemplating the Shabad, he drinks in the sublime essence of the Lord; O Nanak, his faith is confirmed in the Truth. ||4||4||5||<BR>
 Bhairao, First Mehl:<BR>
 He remains with the Guru, day and night, and his tongue savors the savory taste of the Lord's Love.<BR>
 He does not know any other; he realizes the Word of the Shabad. He knows and realizes the Lord deep within his own being. ||1||<BR>
 Such a humble person is pleasing to my mind.<BR>
 He conquers his self-conceit, and is imbued with the Infinite Lord. He serves the Guru. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Deep within my being, and outside as well, is the Immaculate Lord God. I bow humbly before that Primal Lord God.<BR>
 Deep within each and every heart, and amidst all, the Embodiment of Truth is permeating and pervading. ||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 003</H2></CENTER>
 Those who are imbued with Truth - their tongues are tinged with Truth; they do not have even an iota of the filth of falsehood.<BR>
 They taste the sweet Ambrosial Nectar of the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord; imbued with the Shabad, they are blessed with honor. ||3||<BR>
 The virtuous meet with the virtuous, and earn the profit; as Gurmukh, they obtain the glorious greatness of the Naam.<BR>
 All sorrows are erased, by serving the Guru; O Nanak, the Naam is our only Friend and Companion. ||4||5||6||<BR>
 Bhairao, First Mehl:<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the wealth and support of all; It is enshrined in the heart, by Guru's Grace.<BR>
 One who gathers this imperishable wealth is fulfilled, and through intuitive meditation, is lovingly focused on the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O mortal, focus your consciousness on devotional worship of the Lord.<BR>
 As Gurmukh, meditate on the Name of the Lord in your heart, and you shall return to your home with intuitive ease. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Doubt, separation and fear are never eradicated, and the mortal continues coming and going in reincarnation, as long as he does not know the Lord.<BR>
 Without the Name of the Lord, no one is liberated; they drown and die without water. ||2||<BR>
 Busy with his worldly affairs, all honor is lost; the ignorant one is not rid of his doubts.<BR>
 Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the mortal is never liberated; he remains blindly entangled in the expanse of worldly affairs. ||3||<BR>
 My mind is pleased and appeased with the Immaculate Lord, who has no ancestry. Through the mind itself, the mind is subdued.<BR>
 Deep within my being, and outside as well, I know only the One Lord. O Nanak, there is no other at all. ||4||6||7||<BR>
 Bhairao, First Mehl:<BR>
 You may give feasts, make burnt offerings, donate to charity, perform austere penance and worship, and endure pain and suffering in the body.<BR>
 But without the Lord's Name, liberation is not obtained. As Gurmukh, obtain the Naam and liberation. ||1||<BR>
 Without the Lord's Name, birth into the world is useless.<BR>
 Without the Name, the mortal eats poison and speaks poisonous words; he dies fruitlessly, and wanders in reincarnation. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The mortal may read scriptures, study grammar and say his prayers three times a day.<BR>
 Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, where is liberation, O mortal? Without the Lord's Name, the mortal is entangled and dies. ||2||<BR>
 Walking sticks, begging bowls, hair tufts, sacred threads, loin cloths, pilgrimages to sacred shrines and wandering all around<BR>
 - without the Lord's Name, peace and tranquility are not obtained. One who chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, crosses over to the other side. ||3||<BR>
 The mortal's hair may be matted and tangled upon his head, and he may smear his body with ashes; he may take off his clothes and go naked.<BR>
 But without the Lord's Name, he is not satisfied; he wears religious robes, but he is bound by the karma of the actions he committed in past lives. ||4||<BR>
 As many beings and creatures as there are in the water, on the land and in the sky - wherever they are, You are with them all, O Lord.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, please preserve Your humble servant; O Lord, Nanak stirs up this juice, and drinks it in. ||5||7||8||<BR>
 Raag Bhairao, Third Mehl, Chaupadas, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 No one should be proud of his social class and status.<BR>
 He alone is a Brahmin, who knows God. ||1||<BR>
 Do not be proud of your social class and status, you ignorant fool!<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 004</H2></CENTER>
 So much sin and corruption comes from this pride. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Everyone says that there are four castes, four social classes.<BR>
 They all emanate from the drop of God's Seed. ||2||<BR>
 The entire universe is made of the same clay.<BR>
 The Potter has shaped it into all sorts of vessels. ||3||<BR>
 The five elements join together, to make up the form of the human body.<BR>
 Who can say which is less, and which is more? ||4||<BR>
 Says Nanak, this soul is bound by its actions.<BR>
 Without meeting the True Guru, it is not liberated. ||5||1||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The Yogis, the householders, the Pandits, the religious scholars, and the beggars in religious robes<BR>
 - they are all asleep in egotism. ||1||<BR>
 They are asleep, intoxicated with the wine of Maya.<BR>
 Only those who remain awake and aware are not robbed. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 One who has met the True Guru, remains awake and aware.<BR>
 Such a person overpowers the five thieves. ||2||<BR>
 One who contemplates the essence of reality remains awake and aware.<BR>
 He kills his self-conceit, and does not kill anyone else. ||3||<BR>
 One who knows the One Lord remains awake and aware.<BR>
 He abandons the service of others, and realizes the essence of reality. ||4||<BR>
 Of the four castes, whoever remains awake and aware<BR>
 is released from birth and death. ||5||<BR>
 Says Nanak, that humble being remains awake and aware,<BR>
 who applies the ointment of spiritual wisdom to his eyes. ||6||2||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Whoever the Lord keeps in His Sanctuary,<BR>
 is attached to the Truth, and receives the fruit of Truth. ||1||<BR>
 O mortal, unto whom will you complain?<BR>
 The Hukam of the Lord's Command is pervasive; by the Hukam of His Command, all things happen. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 This Creation was established by You.<BR>
 In an instant You destroy it, and You create it again without a moment's delay. ||2||<BR>
 By His Grace, He has staged this Play.<BR>
 By the Guru's Merciful Grace, I have obtained the supreme status. ||3||<BR>
 Says Nanak, He alone kills and revives.<BR>
 Understand this well - do not be confused by doubt. ||4||3||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl:<BR>
 I am the bride; the Creator is my Husband Lord.<BR>
 As He inspires me, I adorn myself. ||1||<BR>
 When it pleases Him, He enjoys me.<BR>
 I am joined, body and mind, to my True Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 How can anyone praise or slander anyone else?<BR>
 The One Lord Himself is pervading and permeating all. ||2||<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, I am attracted by His Love.<BR>
 I shall meet with my Merciful Lord, and vibrate the Panch Shabad, the Five Primal Sounds. ||3||<BR>
 Prays Nanak, what can anyone do?<BR>
 He alone meets with the Lord, whom the Lord Himself meets. ||4||4||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl:<BR>
 He alone is a silent sage, who subdues his mind's duality.<BR>
 Subduing his duality, he contemplates God. ||1||<BR>
 Let each person examine his own mind, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 Examine your mind, and you shall obtain the nine treasures of the Naam. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Creator created the world, upon the foundation of worldly love and attachment.<BR>
 Attaching it to possessiveness, He has led it into confusion with doubt. ||2||<BR>
 From this Mind come all bodies, and the breath of life.<BR>
 By mental contemplation, the mortal realizes the Hukam of the Lord's Command, and merges in Him. ||3||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 005</H2></CENTER>
 When the mortal has good karma, the Guru grants His Grace.<BR>
 Then this mind is awakened, and the duality of this mind is subdued. ||4||<BR>
 It is the innate nature of the mind to remain forever detached.<BR>
 The Detached, Dispassionate Lord dwells within all. ||5||<BR>
 Says Nanak, one who understands this mystery,<BR>
 becomes the embodiment of the Primal, Immaculate, Divine Lord God. ||6||5||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The world is saved through Name of the Lord.<BR>
 It carries the mortal across the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, dwell upon the Lord's Name.<BR>
 It shall stand by you forever. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The foolish self-willed manmukhs do not remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Without the Name, how will they cross over? ||2||<BR>
 The Lord, the Great Giver, Himself gives His Gifts.<BR>
 Celebrate and praise the Great Giver! ||3||<BR>
 Granting His Grace, the Lord unites the mortals with the True Guru.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Naam is enshrined within the heart. ||4||6||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl:<BR>
 All people are saved through the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Those who become Gurmukh are blessed to receive It. ||1||<BR>
 When the Dear Lord showers His Mercy,<BR>
 He blesses the Gurmukh with the glorious greatness of the Naam. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Those who love the Beloved Name of the Lord<BR>
 save themselves, and save all their ancestors. ||2||<BR>
 Without the Name, the self-willed manmukhs go to the City of Death.<BR>
 They suffer in pain and endure beatings. ||3||<BR>
 When the Creator Himself gives,<BR>
 O Nanak, then the mortals receive the Naam. ||4||7||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Love of the Lord of the Universe saved Sanak and his brother, the sons of Brahma.<BR>
 They contemplated the Word of the Shabad, and the Name of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O Dear Lord, please shower me with Your Mercy,<BR>
 that as Gurmukh, I may embrace love for Your Name. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Whoever has true loving devotional worship deep within his being<BR>
 meets the Lord, through the Perfect Guru. ||2||<BR>
 He naturally, intuitively dwells within the home of his own inner being.<BR>
 The Naam abides within the mind of the Gurmukh. ||3||<BR>
 The Lord, the Seer, Himself sees.<BR>
 O Nanak, enshrine the Naam within your heart. ||4||8||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl:<BR>
 In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, enshrine the Lord's Name within your heart.<BR>
 Without the Name, ashes will be blown in your face. ||1||<BR>
 The Lord's Name is so difficult to obtain, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, it comes to dwell in the mind. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 That humble being who seeks the Lord's Name,<BR>
 receives it from the Perfect Guru. ||2||<BR>
 Those humble beings who accept the Will of the Lord, are approved and accepted.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they bear the insignia of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 So serve the One, whose power supports the Universe.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh loves the Naam. ||4||9||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl:<BR>
 In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, many rituals are performed.<BR>
 But it is not the time for them, and so they are of no use. ||1||<BR>
 In Kali Yuga, the Lord's Name is the most sublime.<BR>
 As Gurmukh, be lovingly attached to Truth. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Searching my body and mind, I found Him within the home of my own heart.<BR>
 The Gurmukh centers his consciousness on the Lord's Name. ||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 006</H2></CENTER>
 The ointment of spiritual wisdom is obtained from the True Guru.<BR>
 The Lord's Name is pervading the three worlds. ||3||<BR>
 In Kali Yuga, it is the time for the One Dear Lord; it is not the time for anything else.<BR>
 O Nanak, as Gurmukh, let the Lord's Name grow within your heart. ||4||10||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs are afflicted with the disease of duality; they are burnt by the intense fire of desire.<BR>
 They die and die again, and are reborn; they find no place of rest. They waste their lives uselessly. ||1||<BR>
 O my Beloved, grant Your Grace, and give me understanding.<BR>
 The world was created in the disease of egotism; without the Word of the Shabad, the disease is not cured. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 There are so many silent sages, who read the Simritees and the Shaastras; without the Shabad, they have no clear awareness.<BR>
 All those under the influence of the three qualities are afflicted with the disease; through possessiveness, they lose their awareness. ||2||<BR>
 O God, you save some, and you enjoin others to serve the Guru.<BR>
 They obtain the treasure of the Name of the Lord; peace comes to abide within their minds. ||3||<BR>
 The Gurmukhs dwell in the fourth state; they obtain a dwelling in the home of their own inner being.<BR>
 The Perfect True Guru shows His Mercy to them; they eradicate their self-conceit from within. ||4||<BR>
 Everyone must serve the One Lord, who created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.<BR>
 O Nanak, the One True Lord is permanent and stable. He does not die, and He is not born. ||5||1||11||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh is afflicted with the disease of duality forever; the entire universe is diseased.<BR>
 The Gurmukh understands, and is cured of the disease, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||<BR>
 O Dear Lord, please let me join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Lord blesses with glorious greatness, those who focus their consciousness on the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Death takes all those who are afflicted with the disease of possessiveness. They are subject to the Messenger of Death.<BR>
 The Messenger of Death does not even approach that mortal who, as Gurmukh, enshrines the Lord within his heart. ||2||<BR>
 One who does not know the Lord's Name, and who does not become Gurmukh - why did he even come into the world?<BR>
 He never serves the Guru; he wastes his life uselessly. ||3||<BR>
 O Nanak, those whom the True Guru enjoins to His service, have perfect good fortune.<BR>
 They obtain the fruits of their desires, and find peace in the Word of the Guru's Bani. ||4||2||12||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl:<BR>
 In pain he is born, in pain he dies, and in pain he does his deeds.<BR>
 He is never released from the womb of reincarnation; he rots away in manure. ||1||<BR>
 Cursed, cursed is the self-willed manmukh, who wastes his life away.<BR>
 He does not serve the Perfect Guru; he does not love the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Word of the Guru's Shabad cures all diseases; he alone is attached to it, whom the Dear Lord attaches.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 007</H2></CENTER>
 Through the Naam, glorious greatness is obtained; he alone obtains it, whose mind is filled with the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Meeting the True Guru, the fruitful rewards are obtained. This true lifestyle beings sublime peace.<BR>
 Those humble beings who are attached to the Lord are immaculate; they enshrine love for the Lord's Name. ||3||<BR>
 If I obtain the dust of their feet, I apply it to my forehead. They meditate on the Perfect True Guru.<BR>
 O Nanak, this dust is obtained only by perfect destiny. They focus their consciousness on the Lord's Name. ||4||3||13||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl:<BR>
 That humble being who contemplates the Word of the Shabad is true; the True Lord is within his heart.<BR>
 If someone performs true devotional worship day and night, then his body will not feel pain. ||1||<BR>
 Everyone calls him, "Devotee, devotee."<BR>
 But without serving the True Guru, devotional worship is not obtained. Only through perfect destiny does one meet God. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs lose their capital, and still, they demand profits. How can they earn any profit?<BR>
 The Messenger of Death is always hovering above their heads. In the love of duality, they lose their honor. ||2||<BR>
 Trying on all sorts of religious robes, they wander around day and night, but the disease of their egotism is not cured.<BR>
 Reading and studying, they argue and debate; attached to Maya, they lose their awareness. ||3||<BR>
 Those who serve the True Guru are blessed with the supreme status; through the Naam, they are blessed with glorious greatness.<BR>
 O Nanak, those whose minds are filled with the Naam, are honored in the Court of the True Lord. ||4||4||14||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh cannot escape false hope. In the love of duality, he is ruined.<BR>
 His belly is like a river - it is never filled up. He is consumed by the fire of desire. ||1||<BR>
 Eternally blissful are those who are imbued with the sublime essence of the Lord.<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord, fills their hearts, and duality runs away from their minds. Drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord, Har, Har, they are satisfied. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Supreme Lord God Himself created the Universe; He links each and every person to their tasks.<BR>
 He Himself created love and attachment to Maya; He Himself attaches the mortals to duality. ||2||<BR>
 If there were any other, then I would speak to him; all will be merged in You.<BR>
 The Gurmukh contemplates the essence of spiritual wisdom; his light merges into the Light. ||3||<BR>
 God is True, Forever True, and all His Creation is True.<BR>
 O Nanak, the True Guru has given me this understanding; the True Name brings emancipation. ||4||5||15||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl:<BR>
 In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, those who do not realize the Lord are goblins. In the Golden Age of Sat Yuga, the supreme soul-swans contemplated the Lord.<BR>
 In the Silver Age of Dwaapur Yuga, and the Brass Age of Traytaa Yuga, mankind prevailed, but only a rare few subdued their egos. ||1||<BR>
 In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, glorious greatness is obtained through the Lord's Name.<BR>
 In each and every age, the Gurmukhs know the One Lord; without the Name, liberation is not attained. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is revealed in the heart of the True Lord's humble servant. It dwells in the mind of the Gurmukh.<BR>
 Those who are lovingly focused on the Lord's Name save themselves; they save all their ancestors as well. ||2||<BR>
 My Lord God is the Giver of virtue. The Word of the Shabad burns away all faults and demerits.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 008</H2></CENTER>
 Those whose minds are filled with the Naam are beautiful; they enshrine the Naam within their hearts. ||3||<BR>
 The True Guru has revealed to me the Lord's Home and His Court, and the Mansion of His Presence. I joyfully enjoy His Love.<BR>
 Whatever He says, I accept as good; Nanak chants the Naam. ||4||6||16||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The desires of the mind are absorbed in the mind, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 Understanding is obtained from the Perfect Guru, and then the mortal does not die over and over again. ||1||<BR>
 My mind takes the Support of the Lord's Name.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, I have obtained the supreme status; the Lord is the Fulfiller of all desires. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The One Lord is permeating and pervading amongst all; without the Guru, this understanding is not obtained.<BR>
 My Lord God has been revealed to me, and I have become Gurmukh. Night and day, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 The One Lord is the Giver of peace; peace is not found anywhere else.<BR>
 Those who do not serve the Giver, the True Guru, depart regretfully in the end. ||3||<BR>
 Serving the True Guru, lasting peace is obtained, and the mortal does not suffer in pain any longer.<BR>
 Nanak has been blessed with devotional worship of the Lord; his light has merged into the Light. ||4||7||17||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Without the Guru, the world is insane; confused and deluded, it is beaten, and it suffers.<BR>
 It dies and dies again, and is reborn, always in pain, but it is unaware of the Lord's Gate. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, remain always in the Protection of the True Guru's Sanctuary.<BR>
 Those people, to whose hearts the Lord's Name seems sweet, are carried across the terrifying world-ocean by the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The mortal wears various religious robes, but his consciousness is unsteady; deep within, he is filled with sexual desire, anger and egotism.<BR>
 Deep within is the great thirst and immense hunger; he wanders from door to door. ||2||<BR>
 Those who die in the Word of the Guru's Shabad are reborn; they find the door of liberation.<BR>
 With constant peace and tranquility deep within, they enshrine the Lord within their hearts. ||3||<BR>
 As it pleases Him, He inspires us to act. Nothing else can be done.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh contemplates the Word of the Shabad, and is blessed with the glorious greatness of the Lord's Name. ||4||8||18||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Lost in egotism, Maya and attachment, the mortal earns pain, and eats pain.<BR>
 The great disease, the rabid disease of greed, is deep within him; he wanders around indiscriminately. ||1||<BR>
 The life of the self-willed manmukh in this world is cursed.<BR>
 He does not remember the Lord's Name, even in his dreams. He is never in love with the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He acts like a beast, and does not understand anything. Practicing falsehood, he becomes false.<BR>
 But when the mortal meets the True Guru, his way of looking at the world changes. How rare are those humble beings who seek and find the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 That person, whose heart is forever filled with the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, obtains the Lord, the Treasure of Virtue.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, he finds the Perfect Lord; the egotistical pride of his mind is eradicated. ||3||<BR>
 The Creator Himself acts, and causes all to act. He Himself places us on the path.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 009</H2></CENTER>
 He Himself blesses the Gurmukh with glorious greatness; O Nanak, he merges in the Naam. ||4||9||19||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Upon my writing tablet, I write the Name of the Lord, the Lord of the Universe, the Lord of the World.<BR>
 In the love of duality, the mortals are caught in the noose of the Messenger of Death.<BR>
 The True Guru nurtures and sustains me.<BR>
 The Lord, the Giver of peace, is always with me. ||1||<BR>
 Following his Guru's instructions, Prahlaad chanted the Lord's Name;<BR>
 he was a child, but he was not afraid when his teacher yelled at him. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Prahlaad's mother gave her beloved son some advice:<BR>
 "My son, you must abandon the Lord's Name, and save your life!"<BR>
 Prahlaad said: "Listen, O my mother;<BR>
 I shall never give up the Lord's Name. My Guru has taught me this."||2||<BR>
 Sandaa and Markaa, his teachers, went to his father the king, and complained:<BR>
 "Prahlaad himself has gone astray, and he leads all the other pupils astray."<BR>
 In the court of the wicked king, a plan was hatched.<BR>
 God is the Savior of Prahlaad. ||3||<BR>
 With sword in hand, and with great egotistical pride, Prahlaad's father ran up to him.<BR>
 "Where is your Lord, who will save you?"<BR>
 In an instant, the Lord appeared in a dreadful form, and shattered the pillar.<BR>
 Harnaakhash was torn apart by His claws, and Prahlaad was saved. ||4||<BR>
 The Dear Lord completes the tasks of the Saints.<BR>
 He saved twenty-one generations of Prahlaad's descendents.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the poison of egotism is neutralized.<BR>
 O Nanak, through the Name of the Lord, the Saints are emancipated. ||5||10||20||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The Lord Himself makes demons pursue the Saints, and He Himself saves them.<BR>
 Those who remain forever in Your Sanctuary, O Lord - their minds are never touched by sorrow. ||1||<BR>
 In each and every age, the Lord saves the honor of His devotees.<BR>
 Prahlaad, the demon's son, knew nothing of the Hindu morning prayer, the Gayatri, and nothing about ceremonial water-offerings to his ancestors; but through the Word of the Shabad, he was united in the Lord's Union. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Night and day, he performed devotional worship service, day and night, and through the Shabad, his duality was eradicated.<BR>
 Those who are imbued with Truth are immaculate and pure; the True Lord abides within their minds. ||2||<BR>
 The fools in duality read, but they do not understand anything; they waste their lives uselessly.<BR>
 The wicked demon slandered the Saint, and stirred up trouble. ||3||<BR>
 Prahlaad did not read in duality, and he did not abandon the Lord's Name; he was not afraid of any fear.<BR>
 The Dear Lord became the Savior of the Saint, and the demonic Death could not even approach him. ||4||<BR>
 The Lord Himself saved his honor, and blessed his devotee with glorious greatness.<BR>
 O Nanak, Harnaakhash was torn apart by the Lord with His claws; the blind demon knew nothing of the Lord's Court. ||5||11||21||<BR>
 Raag Bhairao, Fourth Mehl, Chaupadas, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The Lord, in His Mercy, attaches mortals to the feet of the Saints.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 010</H2></CENTER>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, vibrate and meditate on the Lord; let your awareness be absorbed in Him. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, vibrate and meditate on the Lord and the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 The Lord, Har, Har, the Giver of Peace, grants His Grace; the Gurmukh crosses over the terrifying world-ocean through the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, sing of the Lord.<BR>
 Follow the Guru's Teachings, and you shall obtain the Lord, the Source of Nectar. ||2||<BR>
 Bathe in the pool of ambrosial nectar, the spiritual wisdom of the Holy Guru.<BR>
 All sins will be eliminated and eradicated. ||3||<BR>
 You Yourself are the Creator, the Support of the Universe.<BR>
 Please unite servant Nanak with Yourself; he is the slave of Your slaves. ||4||1||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 Fruitful is that moment when the Lord's Name is spoken.<BR>
 Following the Guru's Teachings, all pains are taken away. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, vibrate the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 O Lord, be merciful, and unite me with the Perfect Guru. Joining with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Meditate on the Life of the World; remember the Lord in your mind.<BR>
 Millions upon millions of your sins shall be taken away. ||2||<BR>
 In the Sat Sangat, apply the dust of the feet of the holy to your face;<BR>
 this is how to bathe in the sixty-eight sacred shrines, and the Ganges. ||3||<BR>
 I am a fool; the Lord has shown mercy to me.<BR>
 The Savior Lord has saved servant Nanak. ||4||2||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 To do good deeds is the best rosary.<BR>
 Chant on the beads within your heart, and it shall go along with you. ||1||<BR>
 Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the Lord of the forest.<BR>
 Have mercy on me, Lord, and unite me with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, so that I may be released from Maya's noose of death. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Whoever, as Gurmukh, serves and works hard,<BR>
 is molded and shaped in the true mint of the Shabad, the Word of God. ||2||<BR>
 The Guru has revealed to me the Inaccessible and Unfathomable Lord.<BR>
 Searching within the body-village, I have found the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 I am just a child; the Lord is my Father, who nurtures and cherishes me.<BR>
 Please save servant Nanak, Lord; bless him with Your Glance of Grace. ||4||3||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 All hearts are Yours, Lord; You are in all.<BR>
 There is nothing at all except You. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, meditate on the Lord, the Giver of peace.<BR>
 I praise You, O Lord God, You are my Father. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Wherever I look, I see only the Lord God.<BR>
 All are under Your control; there is no other at all. ||2||<BR>
 O Lord, when it is Your Will to save someone,<BR>
 then nothing can threaten him. ||3||<BR>
 You are totally pervading and permeating the waters, the lands, the skies and all places.<BR>
 Servant Nanak meditates on the Ever-present Lord. ||4||4||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fourth Mehl, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The Lord's Saint is the embodiment of the Lord; within his heart is the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 One who has such destiny inscribed on his forehead, follows the Guru's Teachings, and contemplates the Name of the Lord within his heart. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 011</H2></CENTER>
 Enshrine Him in your heart, and meditate on the Lord.<BR>
 The five plundering thieves are in the body-village; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord has beaten them and driven them out. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Those whose minds are satisfied with the Lord - the Lord Himself resolves their affairs.<BR>
 Their subservience and their dependence on other people is ended; the Creator Lord is on their side. ||2||<BR>
 If something were beyond the realm of the Lord's Power, only then would we have recourse to consult someone else.<BR>
 Whatever the Lord does is good. Meditate on the Name of the Lord, night and day. ||3||<BR>
 Whatever the Lord does, He does by Himself. He does not ask or consult anyone else.<BR>
 O Nanak, meditate forever on God; granting His Grace, He unites us with the True Guru. ||4||1||5||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 O my Lord and Master, please unite me with the Holy people; meditating on You, I am saved.<BR>
 Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of their Darshan, my mind blossoms forth. Each and every moment, I am a sacrifice to them. ||1||<BR>
 Meditate within your heart on the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Show Mercy, Mercy to me, O Father of the World, O my Lord and Master; make me the water-carrier of the slave of Your slaves. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Their intellect is sublime and exalted, and so is their honor; the Lord, the Lord of the forest, abides within their hearts.<BR>
 O my Lord and Master, please link me to the service of those who meditate in remembrance on You, and are saved. ||2||<BR>
 Those who do not find such a Holy True Guru are beaten, and driven out of the Court of the Lord.<BR>
 These slanderous people have no honor or reputation; their noses are cut by the Creator Lord. ||3||<BR>
 The Lord Himself speaks, and the Lord Himself inspires all to speak; He is Immaculate and Formless, and needs no sustenance.<BR>
 O Lord, he alone meets You, whom You cause to meet. Says servant Nanak, I am a wretched creature. What can I do? ||4||2||6||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 That is Your True Congregation, Lord, where the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises are heard.<BR>
 The minds of those who listen to the Lord's Name are drenched with bliss; I worship their feet continually. ||1||<BR>
 Meditating on the Lord, the Life of the World, the mortals cross over.<BR>
 Your Names are so many, they are countless, O Lord. This tongue of mine cannot even count them. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 O Gursikhs, chant the Lord's Name, and sing the Praises of the Lord. Take the Guru's Teachings, and meditate on the Lord.<BR>
 Whoever listens to the Guru's Teachings - that humble being receives countless comforts and pleasures from the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Blessed is the ancestry, blessed is the father, and blessed is that mother who gave birth to this humble servant.<BR>
 Those who meditate on my Lord, Har, Har, with every breath and morsel of food - those humble servants of the Lord look beautiful in the True Court of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 O Lord, Har, Har, Your Names are profound and infinite; Your devotees cherish them deep within.<BR>
 Servant Nanak has obained the wisdom of the Guru's Teachings; meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, he crosses over to the other side. ||4||3||7||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 012</H2></CENTER>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Setting aside all other days, it is said that the Lord was born on the eighth lunar day. ||1||<BR>
 Deluded and confused by doubt, the mortal practices falsehood.<BR>
 The Lord is beyond birth and death. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You prepare sweet treats and feed them to your stone god.<BR>
 God is not born, and He does not die, you foolish, faithless cynic! ||2||<BR>
 You sing lullabyes to your stone god - this is the source of all your mistakes.<BR>
 Let that mouth be burnt, which says that our Lord and Master is subject to birth. ||3||<BR>
 He is not born, and He does not die; He does not come and go in reincarnation.<BR>
 The God of Nanak is pervading and permeating everywhere. ||4||1||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Standing up, I am at peace; sitting down, I am at peace.<BR>
 I feel no fear, because this is what I understand. ||1||<BR>
 The One Lord, my Lord and Master, is my Protector.<BR>
 He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of Hearts. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I sleep without worry, and I awake without worry.<BR>
 You, O God, are pervading everywhere. ||2||<BR>
 I dwell in peace in my home, and I am at peace outside.<BR>
 Says Nanak, the Guru has implanted His Mantra within me. ||3||2||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I do not keep fasts, nor do I observe the month of Ramadaan.<BR>
 I serve only the One, who will protect me in the end. ||1||<BR>
 The One Lord, the Lord of the World, is my God Allah.<BR>
 He adminsters justice to both Hindus and Muslims. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I do not make pilgrimages to Mecca, nor do I worship at Hindu sacred shrines.<BR>
 I serve the One Lord, and not any other. ||2||<BR>
 I do not perform Hindu worship services, nor do I offer the Muslim prayers.<BR>
 I have taken the One Formless Lord into my heart; I humbly worship Him there. ||3||<BR>
 I am not a Hindu, nor am I a Muslim.<BR>
 My body and breath of life belong to Allah - to Raam - the God of both. ||4||<BR>
 Says Kabeer, this is what I say:<BR>
 meeting with the Guru, my Spiritual Teacher, I realize God, my Lord and Master. ||5||3||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I easily tied up the deer - the ten sensory organs.<BR>
 I shot five of the desires with the Word of the Lord's Bani. ||1||<BR>
 I go out hunting with the Saints,<BR>
 and we capture the deer without horses or weapons. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 My mind used to run around outside hunting.<BR>
 But now, I have found the game within the home of my body-village. ||2||<BR>
 I caught the deer and brought them home.<BR>
 Dividing them up, I shared them, bit by bit. ||3||<BR>
 God has given this gift.<BR>
 Nanak's home is filled with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||4||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Even though he may be fed with hundreds of longings and yearnings,<BR>
 still the faithless cynic does not remember the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||<BR>
 Take in the teachings of the humble Saints.<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you shall obtain the supreme status. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Stones may be kept under water for a long time.<BR>
 Even so, they do not absorb the water; they remain hard and dry. ||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 013</H2></CENTER>
 The six Shaastras may be read to a fool,<BR>
 but it is like the wind blowing in the ten directions. ||3||<BR>
 It is like threshing a crop without any corn - nothing is gained.<BR>
 In the same way, no benefit comes from the faithless cynic. ||4||<BR>
 As the Lord attaches them, so are all attached.<BR>
 Says Nanak, God has formed such a form. ||5||5||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 He created the soul, the breath of life and the body.<BR>
 He created all beings, and knows their pains. ||1||<BR>
 The Guru, the Lord of the Universe, is the Helper of the soul.<BR>
 Here and herafter, He always provides shade. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Worship and adoration of God is the pure way of life.<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the love of duality vanishes. ||2||<BR>
 Friends, well-wishers and wealth will not support you.<BR>
 Blessed, blessed is my Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Nanak utters the Ambrosial Bani of the Lord.<BR>
 Except the One Lord, he does not know any other at all. ||4||6||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The Lord is in front of me, and the Lord is behind me.<BR>
 My Beloved Lord, the Source of Nectar, is in the middle as well. ||1||<BR>
 God is my Shaastra and my favorable omen.<BR>
 In His Home and Mansion, I find peace, poise and bliss. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, with my tongue, and hearing it with my ears, I live.<BR>
 Meditating, meditating in remembrance on God, I have become eternal, permanent and stable. ||2||<BR>
 The pains of countless lifetimes have been erased.<BR>
 The Unstruck Sound-current of the Shabad, the Word of God, vibrates in the Court of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Granting His Grace, God has blended me with Himself.<BR>
 Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of God. ||4||7||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 It brings millions of desires to fulfillment.<BR>
 On the Path of Death, It will go with you and help you. ||1||<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord of the Universe, is the holy water of the Ganges.<BR>
 Whoever meditates on it, is saved; drinking it in, the mortal does not wander in reincarnation again. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 It is my worship, meditation, austerity and cleansing bath.<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, I have become free of desire. ||2||<BR>
 It is my domain and empire, wealth, mansion and court.<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on the Naam brings perfect conduct. ||3||<BR>
 Slave Nanak has deliberated, and has come to this conclusion:<BR>
 Without the Lord's Name, everything is false and worthless, like ashes. ||4||8||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The poison had absolutely no harmful effect.<BR>
 But the wicked Brahmin died in pain. ||1||<BR>
 The Supreme Lord God Himself has saved His humble servant.<BR>
 The sinner died through the Power of the Guru. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The humble servant of the Lord and Master meditates on Him.<BR>
 He Himself has destroyed the ignorant sinner. ||2||<BR>
 God is the Mother, the Father and the Protector of His slave.<BR>
 The face of the slanderer, here and hereafter, is blackened. ||3||<BR>
 The Transcendent Lord has heard the prayer of servant Nanak.<BR>
 The filthy sinner lost hope and died. ||4||9||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent is Your Name.<BR>
 False, false, false, false is pride in the world. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The glorious vision of Your slaves, O Infinite Lord, is wonderful and beauteous.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 014</H2></CENTER>
 Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the whole world is just ashes. ||1||<BR>
 Your Creative Power is marvellous, and Your Lotus Feet are admirable.<BR>
 Your Praise is priceless, O True King. ||2||<BR>
 God is the Support of the unsupported.<BR>
 Meditate day and night on the Cherisher of the meek and humble. ||3||<BR>
 God has been merciful to Nanak.<BR>
 May I never forget God; He is my heart, my soul, my breath of life. ||4||10||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 As Gurmukh, obtain the true wealth.<BR>
 Accept the Will of God as True. ||1||<BR>
 Live, live, live forever.<BR>
 Rise early each day, and drink in the Nectar of the Lord.<BR>
 With your tongue, chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the One Name alone shall save you.<BR>
 Nanak speaks the wisdom of God. ||2||11||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Serving the True Guru, all fruits and rewards are obtained.<BR>
 The filth of so many lifetimes is washed away. ||1||<BR>
 Your Name, God, is the Purifier of sinners.<BR>
 Because of the karma of my past deeds, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I am saved.<BR>
 I am blessed with honor in God's Court. ||2||<BR>
 Serving at God's Feet, all comforts are obtained.<BR>
 All the angels and demi-gods long for the dust of the feet of such beings. ||3||<BR>
 Nanak has obtained the treasure of the Naam.<BR>
 Chanting and meditating on the Lord, the whole world is saved. ||4||12||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 God hugs His slave close in His Embrace.<BR>
 He throws the slanderer into the fire. ||1||<BR>
 The Lord saves His servants from the sinners.<BR>
 No one can save the sinner. The sinner is destroyed by his own actions. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Lord's slave is in love with the Dear Lord.<BR>
 The slanderer loves something else. ||2||<BR>
 The Supreme Lord God has revealed His Innate Nature.<BR>
 The evil-doer obtains the fruits of his own actions. ||3||<BR>
 God does not come or go; He is All-pervading and permeating.<BR>
 Slave Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord. ||4||13||<BR>
 Raag Bhairao, Fifth Mehl, Chaupadas, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The Fascinating Lord, the Creator of all, the Formless Lord, is the Giver of Peace.<BR>
 You have abandoned this Lord, and you serve another. Why are you intoxicated with the pleasures of corruption? ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, meditate on the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 I have seen all other sorts of efforts; whatever you can think of, will only bring failure. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The blind, ignorant, self-willed manmukhs forsake their Lord and Master, and dwell on His slave Maya.<BR>
 They slander those who worship their Lord; they are like beasts, without a Guru. ||2||<BR>
 Soul, life, body and wealth all belong to God, but the faithless cynics claim that they own them.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 015</H2></CENTER>
 They are proud and arrogant, evil-minded and filthy; without the Guru, they are reincarnated into the terrifying world-ocean. ||3||<BR>
 Through burnt offerings, charitable feasts, ritualistic chants, penance, all sorts of austere self-discipline and pilgrimages to sacred shrines and rivers, they do not find God.<BR>
 Self-conceit is only erased when one seeks the Lord's Sanctuary and becomes Gurmukh; O Nanak, he crosses over the world-ocean. ||4||1||14||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I have seen Him in the woods, and I have seen Him in the fields. I have seen Him in the household, and in renunciation.<BR>
 I have seen Him as a Yogi carrying His staff, as a Yogi with matted hair, fasting, making vows, and visiting sacred shrines of pilgrimage. ||1||<BR>
 I have seen Him in the Society of the Saints, and within my own mind.<BR>
 In the sky, in the nether regions of the underworld, and in everything, He is pervading and permeating. With love and joy, I sing His Glorious Praises. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I have seen Him among the Yogis, the Sannyaasees, the celibates, the wandering hermits and the wearers of patched coats.<BR>
 I have seen Him among the men of severe self-discipline, the silent sages, the actors, dramas and dances. ||2||<BR>
 I have seen Him in the four Vedas, I have seen Him in the six Shaastras, in the eighteen Puraanas and the Simritees as well.<BR>
 All together, they declare that there is only the One Lord. So tell me, from whom is He hidden? ||3||<BR>
 Unfathomable and Inaccessible, He is our Infinite Lord and Master; His Value is beyond valuation.<BR>
 Servant Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to those, within whose heart He is revealed. ||4||2||15||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 How can anyone do evil, if he realizes that the Lord is near?<BR>
 One who gathers corruption, constantly feels fear.<BR>
 He is near, but this mystery is not understood.<BR>
 Without the True Guru, all are enticed by Maya. ||1||<BR>
 Everyone says that He is near, near at hand.<BR>
 But rare is that person, who, as Gurmukh, understands this mystery. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The mortal does not see the Lord near at hand; instead, he goes to the homes of others.<BR>
 He steals their wealth and lives in falsehood.<BR>
 Under the influence of the drug of illusion, he does not know that the Lord is with him.<BR>
 Without the Guru, he is confused and deluded by doubt. ||2||<BR>
 Not understanding that the Lord is near, he tells lies.<BR>
 In love and attachment to Maya, the fool is plundered.<BR>
 That which he seeks is within his own self, but he looks for it outside.<BR>
 Without the Guru, he is confused and deluded by doubt. ||3||<BR>
 One whose good karma is recorded on his forehead<BR>
 serves the True Guru; thus the hard and heavy shutters of his mind are opened wide.<BR>
 Within his own being and beyond, he sees the Lord near at hand.<BR>
 O servant Nanak, he does not come and go in reincarnation. ||4||3||16||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Who can kill that person whom You protect, O Lord?<BR>
 All beings, and the entire universe, is within You.<BR>
 The mortal thinks up millions of plans,<BR>
 but that alone happens, which the Lord of wondrous plays does. ||1||<BR>
 Save me, save me, O Lord; shower me with Your Mercy.<BR>
 I seek Your Sanctuary, and Your Court. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Whoever serves the Fearless Lord, the Giver of Peace,<BR>
 is rid of all his fears; he knows the One Lord.<BR>
 Whatever You do, that alone comes to pass in the end.<BR>
 There is no other who can kill or protect us. ||2||<BR>
 What do you think, with your human understanding?<BR>
 The All-knowing Lord is the Searcher of Hearts.<BR>
 The One and only Lord is my Support and Protection.<BR>
 The Creator Lord knows everything. ||3||<BR>
 That person who is blessed by the Creator's Glance of Grace<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 016</H2></CENTER>
 - all his affairs are resolved.<BR>
 The One Lord is his Protector.<BR>
 O servant Nanak, no one can equal him. ||4||4||17||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 We should feel sad, if God were beyond us.<BR>
 We should feel sad, if we forget the Lord.<BR>
 We should feel sad, if we are in love with duality.<BR>
 But why should we feel sad? The Lord is pervading everywhere. ||1||<BR>
 In love and attachment to Maya, the mortals are sad, and are consumed by sadness.<BR>
 Without the Name, they wander and wander and wander, and waste away. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 We should feel sad, if there were another Creator Lord.<BR>
 We should feel sad, if someone dies by injustice.<BR>
 We should feel sad, if something were not known to the Lord.<BR>
 But why should we feel sad? The Lord is totally permeating everywhere. ||2||<BR>
 We should feel sad, if God were a tyrant.<BR>
 We should feel sad, if He made us suffer by mistake.<BR>
 The Guru says that whatever happens is all by God's Will.<BR>
 So I have abandoned sadness, and I now sleep without anxiety. ||3||<BR>
 O God, You alone are my Lord and Master; all belong to You.<BR>
 According to Your Will, You pass judgement.<BR>
 There is no other at all; the One Lord is permeating and pervading everywhere.<BR>
 Please save Nanak's honor; I have come to Your Sanctuary. ||4||5||18||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Without music, how is one to dance?<BR>
 Without a voice, how is one to sing?<BR>
 Without strings, how is a guitar to be played?<BR>
 Without the Naam, all affairs are useless. ||1||<BR>
 Without the Naam - tell me: who has ever been saved?<BR>
 Without the True Guru, how can anyone cross over to the other side? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Without a tongue, how can anyone speak?<BR>
 Without ears, how can anyone hear?<BR>
 Without eyes, how can anyone see?<BR>
 Without the Naam, the mortal is of no account at all. ||2||<BR>
 Without learning, how can one be a Pandit - a religious scholar?<BR>
 Without power, what is the glory of an empire?<BR>
 Without understanding, how can the mind become steady?<BR>
 Without the Naam, the whole world is insane. ||3||<BR>
 Without detachment, how can one be a detached hermit?<BR>
 Without renouncing egotism, how can anyone be a renunciate?<BR>
 Without overcoming the five thieves, how can the mind be subdued?<BR>
 Without the Naam, the mortal regrets and repents forever and ever. ||4||<BR>
 Without the Guru's Teachings, how can anyone obtain spiritual wisdom?<BR>
 Without seeing - tell me: how can anyone visualize in meditation?<BR>
 Without the Fear of God, all speech in useless.<BR>
 Says Nanak, this is the wisdom of the Lord's Court. ||5||6||19||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Mankind is afflicted with the disease of egotism.<BR>
 The disease of sexual desire overwhelms the elephant.<BR>
 Because of the disease of vision, the moth is burnt to death.<BR>
 Because of the disease of the sound of the bell, the deer is lured to its death. ||1||<BR>
 Whoever I see is diseased.<BR>
 Only my True Guru, the True Yogi, is free of disease. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Because of the disease of taste, the fish is caught.<BR>
 Because of the disease of smell, the bumble bee is destroyed.<BR>
 The whole world is caught in the disease of attachment.<BR>
 In the disease of the three qualities, corruption is multiplied. ||2||<BR>
 In disease the mortals die, and in disease they are born.<BR>
 In disease they wander in reincarnation again and again.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 017</H2></CENTER>
 Entangled in disease, they cannot stay still, even for an instant.<BR>
 Without the True Guru, the disease is never cured. ||3||<BR>
 When the Supreme Lord God grants His Mercy,<BR>
 He grabs hold of the mortal's arm, and pulls him up and out of the disease.<BR>
 Reaching the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the mortal's bonds are broken.<BR>
 Says Nanak, the Guru cures him of the disease. ||4||7||20||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 When He comes to mind, then I am in supreme bliss.<BR>
 When He comes to mind, then all my pains are shattered.<BR>
 When He comes to mind, my hopes are fulfilled.<BR>
 When He comes to mind, I never feel sadness. ||1||<BR>

 The filth of countless incarnations shall be washed away. Breaking your bonds, you shall be united with the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 How can a stone be purified by bathing at a sacred shrine of pilgrimage?<BR>
 The filth of egotism clings to the mind.<BR>
 Millions of rituals and actions taken are the root of entanglements.<BR>
 Without meditating and vibrating on the Lord, the mortal gathers only worthless bundles of straw. ||2||<BR>
 Without eating, hunger is not satisfied.<BR>
 When the disease is cured, then the pain goes away.<BR>
 The mortal is engrossed in sexual desire, anger, greed and attachment.<BR>
 He does not meditate on God, that God who created him. ||3||<BR>
 Blessed, blessed is the Holy Saint, and blessed is the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Twenty-four hours a day, sing the Kirtan, the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<BR>
 Blessed is the devotee of the Lord, and blessed is the Creator Lord.<BR>
 Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of God, the Primal, the Infinite. ||4||32||45||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 When the Guru was totally pleased, my fear was taken away.<BR>
 I enshrine the Name of the Immaculate Lord within my mind.<BR>
 He is Merciful to the meek, forever Compassionate.<BR>
 All my entanglements are finished. ||1||<BR>
 I have found peace, poise, and myriads of pleasures.<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, fear and doubt are dispelled. My tongue chants the Ambrosial Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I have fallen in love with the Lord's Lotus Feet.<BR>
 In an instant, the terrible demons are destroyed.<BR>
 Twenty-four hours a day, I meditate and chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 The Guru is Himself the Savior Lord, the Lord of the Universe. ||2||<BR>
 He Himself cherishes His servant forever.<BR>
 He watches over every breath of His humble devotee.<BR>
 Tell me, what is the nature of human beings?<BR>
 The Lord extends His Hand, and saves them from the Messenger of Death. ||3||<BR>
 Immaculate is the Glory, and Immaculate is the way of life,<BR>
 of those who remember the Supreme Lord God in their minds.<BR>
 The Guru, in His Mercy, has granted this Gift.<BR>
 Nanak has obtained the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||33||46||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 My Guru is the All-powerful Lord, the Creator, the Cause of causes.<BR>
 He is the Soul, the Breath of Life, the Giver of Peace, always near.<BR>
 He is the Destroyer of fear, the Eternal, Unchanging, Sovereign Lord King.<BR>
 Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, all fear is dispelled. ||1||<BR>
 Wherever I look, is the Protection of Your Sanctuary.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Feet of the True Guru. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 My tasks are perfectly accomplished, meeting the Divine Guru.<BR>
 He is the Giver of all rewards. Serving Him, I am immaculate.<BR>
 He reaches out with His Hand to His slaves.<BR>
 The Name of the Lord abides in their hearts. ||2||<BR>
 They are forever in bliss, and do not suffer at all.<BR>
 No pain, sorrow or disease afflicts them.<BR>
 Everything is Yours, O Creator Lord.<BR>
 The Guru is the Supreme Lord God, the Inaccessible and Infinite. ||3||<BR>
 His Glorious Grandeur is immaculate, and the Bani of His Word is wonderful!<BR>
 The Perfect Supreme Lord God is pleasing to my mind.<BR>
 He is permeating the waters, the lands and the skies.<BR>
 O Nanak, everything comes from God. ||4||34||47||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 My mind and body are imbued with the Love of the Lord's Feet.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 026</H2></CENTER>
 All the desires of my mind have been perfectly fulfilled.<BR>
 Twenty-four hours a day, I sing of the Lord God.<BR>
 The True Guru has imparted this perfect wisdom. ||1||<BR>
 Very fortunate are those who love the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Associating with them, we cross over the world-ocean. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 They are spiritual teachers, who meditate in remembrance on the One Lord.<BR>
 Wealthy are those who have a discriminating intellect.<BR>
 Noble are those who remember their Lord and Master in meditation.<BR>
 Honorable are those who understand their own selves. ||2||<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, I have obtained the supreme status.<BR>
 Day and night I meditate on the Glories of God.<BR>
 My bonds are broken, and my hopes are fulfilled.<BR>
 The Feet of the Lord now abide in my heart. ||3||<BR>
 Says Nanak, one whose karma is perfect<BR>
 - that humble being enters the Sanctuary of God.<BR>
 He himself is pure, and he sanctifies all.<BR>
 His tongue chants the Name of the Lord, the Source of Nectar. ||4||35||48||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Repeating the Naam, the Name of the Lord, no obstacles block the way.<BR>
 Listening to the Naam, the Messenger of Death runs far away.<BR>
 Repeating the Naam, all pains vanish.<BR>
 Chanting the Naam, the Lord's Lotus Feet dwell within. ||1||<BR>
 Meditating, vibrating the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is unobstructed devotional worship.<BR>
 Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord with loving affection and energy. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, the Eye of Death cannot see you.<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, demons and ghosts shall not touch you.<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, attachment and pride shall not bind you.<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, you shall not be consigned to the womb of reincarnation. ||2||<BR>
 Any time is a good time to meditate in remembrance on the Lord.<BR>
 Among the masses, only a few meditate in remembrance on the Lord.<BR>
 Social class or no social class, anyone may meditate on the Lord.<BR>
 Whoever meditates on Him is emancipated. ||3||<BR>
 Chant the Name of the Lord in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<BR>
 Perfect is the Love of the Lord's Name.<BR>
 O God, shower Your Mercy on Nanak,<BR>
 that he may think of you with each and every breath. ||4||36||49||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 He Himself is the Shaastras, and He Himself is the Vedas.<BR>
 He knows the secrets of each and every heart.<BR>
 He is the Embodiment of Light; all beings belong to Him.<BR>
 The Creator, the Cause of causes, the Perfect All-powerful Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Grab hold of the Support of God, O my mind.<BR>
 As Gurmukh, worship and adore His Lotus Feet; enemies and pains shall not even approach you. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He Himself is the Essence of the forests and fields, and all the three worlds.<BR>
 The universe is strung on His Thread.<BR>
 He is the Uniter of Shiva and Shakti - mind and matter.<BR>
 He Himself is in the detachment of Nirvaanaa, and He Himself is the Enjoyer. ||2||<BR>
 Wherever I look, there He is.<BR>
 Without Him, there is no one at all.<BR>
 In the Love of the Naam, the world-ocean is crossed.<BR>
 Nanak sings His Glorious Praises in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||3||<BR>
 Liberation, the ways and means of enjoyment and union are under His Control.<BR>
 His humble servant lacks nothing.<BR>
 That person, with whom the Lord, in His Mercy, is pleased<BR>
 - O slave Nanak, that humble servant is blessed. ||4||37||50||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The minds of the Lord's devotee are filled with bliss.<BR>
 They become stable and permanent, and all their anxiety is gone.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 027</H2></CENTER>
 Their fears and doubts are dispelled in an instant.<BR>
 The Supreme Lord God comes to dwell in their minds. ||1||<BR>
 The Lord is forever the Help and Support of the Saints.<BR>
 Inside the home of the heart, and outside as well, the Transcendent Lord is always with us, permeating and pervading all places. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Lord of the World is my wealth, property, youth and ways and means.<BR>
 He continually cherishes and brings peace to my soul and breath of life.<BR>
 He reaches out with His Hand and saves His slave.<BR>
 He does not abandon us, even for an instant; He is always with us. ||2||<BR>
 There is no other Beloved like the Lord.<BR>
 The True Lord takes care of all.<BR>
 The Lord is our Mother, Father, Son and Relation.<BR>
 Since the beginning of time, and throughout the ages, His devotees sing His Glorious Praises. ||3||<BR>
 My mind is filled with the Support and the Power of the Lord.<BR>
 Without the Lord, there is no other at all.<BR>
 Nanak's mind is encouraged by this hope,<BR>
 that God will accomplish my objectives in life. ||4||38||51||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Fear itself becomes afraid, when the mortal remembers the Lord's Name in meditation.<BR>
 All the diseases of the three gunas - the three qualities - are cured, and tasks of the Lord's slaves are perfectly accomplished. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The people of the Lord always sing His Glorious Praises; they attain His Perfect Mansion.<BR>
 Even the Righteous Judge of Dharma and the Messenger of Death yearn, day and night, to be sanctified by the Blessed Vision of the Lord's humble servant. ||1||<BR>
 Sexual desire, anger, intoxication, egotism, slander and egotistical pride are eradicted in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<BR>
 By great good fortune, such Saints are met. Nanak is forever a sacrifice to them. ||2||39||52||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One who harbors the five thieves, becomes the embodiment of these five.<BR>
 He gets up each day and tells lies.<BR>
 He applies ceremonial religious marks to his body, but practices hypocrisy.<BR>
 He wastes away in sadness and pain, like a lonely widow. ||1||<BR>
 Without the Name of the Lord, everything is false.<BR>
 Without the Perfect Guru, liberation is not obtained. In the Court of the True Lord, the faithless cynic is plundered. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 One who does not know the Lord's Creative Power is polluted.<BR>
 Ritualistically plastering one's kitchen square does not make it pure in the Eyes of the Lord.<BR>
 If a person is polluted within, he may wash himself everyday on the outside,<BR>
 but in the Court of the True Lord, he forfeits his honor. ||2||<BR>
 He works for the sake of Maya,<BR>
 but he never places his feet on the right path.<BR>
 He never even remembers the One who created him.<BR>
 He speaks falsehood, only falsehood, with his mouth. ||3||<BR>
 That person, unto whom the Creator Lord shows Mercy,<BR>
 deals with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<BR>
 One who lovingly worships the Lord's Name,<BR>
 says Nanak - no obstacles ever block his way. ||4||40||53||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The entire universe curses the slanderer.<BR>
 False are the dealings of the slanderer.<BR>
 The slanderer's lifestyle is filthy and polluted.<BR>
 The Lord is the Saving Grace and the Protector of His slave. ||1||<BR>
 The slanderer dies with the rest of the slanderers.<BR>
 The Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord, protects and saves His humble servant. Death roars and thunders over the head of the slanderer. ||1||Pause||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 028</H2></CENTER>
 No one belives what the slanderer says.<BR>
 The slanderer tells lies, and later regrets and repents.<BR>
 He wrings his hands, and hits his head against the ground.<BR>
 The Lord does not forgive the slanderer. ||2||<BR>
 The Lord's slave does not wish anyone ill.<BR>
 The slanderer suffers, as if stabbed by a spear.<BR>
 Like a crane, he spreads his feathers, to look like a swan.<BR>
 When he speaks with his mouth, then he is exposed and driven out. ||3||<BR>
 The Creator is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.<BR>
 That person, whom the Lord makes His Own, becomes stable and steady.<BR>
 The Lord's slave is true in the Court of the Lord.<BR>
 Servant Nanak speaks, after contemplating the essence of reality. ||4||41||54||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 With my palms pressed together, I offer this prayer.<BR>
 My soul, body and wealth are His property.<BR>
 He is the Creator, my Lord and Master.<BR>
 Millions of times, I am a sacrifice to Him. ||1||<BR>
 The dust of the feet of the Holy brings purity.<BR>
 Remembering God in meditation, the mind's corruption is eradicated, and the filth of countless incarnations is washed away. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 All treasures are in His household.<BR>
 Serving Him, the mortal attains honor.<BR>
 He is the Fulfiller of the mind's desires.<BR>
 He is the Support of the soul and the breath of life of His devotees. ||2||<BR>
 His Light shines in each and every heart.<BR>
 Chanting and meditating on God, the Treasure of Virtue, His devotees live.<BR>
 Service to Him does not go in vain.<BR>
 Deep within your mind and body, meditate on the One Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Following the Guru's Teachings, compassion and contentment are found.<BR>
 This Treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the immaculate object.<BR>
 Please grant Your Grace, O Lord, and attach me to the hem of Your robe.<BR>
 Nanak meditates continually on the Lord's Lotus Feet. ||4||42||55||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The True Guru has listened to my prayer.<BR>
 All my affairs have been resolved.<BR>
 Deep within my mind and body, I meditate on God.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru has dispelled all my fears. ||1||<BR>
 The All-powerful Divine Guru is the Greatest of all.<BR>
 Serving Him, I obtain all comforts. ||Pause||<BR>
 Everything is done by Him.<BR>
 No one can erase His Eternal Decree.<BR>
 The Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord, is incomparably beautiful.<BR>
 The Guru is the Image of Fulfillment, the Embodiment of the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 The Name of the Lord abides deep within him.<BR>
 Wherever he looks, he sees the Wisdom of God.<BR>
 His mind is totally enlightened and illuminated.<BR>
 Within that person, the Supreme Lord God abides. ||3||<BR>
 I humbly bow to that Guru forever.<BR>
 I am forever a sacrifice to that Guru.<BR>
 I wash the feet of the Guru, and drink in this water.<BR>
 Chanting and meditating forever on Guru Nanak, I live. ||4||43||56||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 029</H2></CENTER>
 Raag Bhairao, Fifth Mehl, Partaal, Third House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 God is the Compassionate Cherisher. Who can count His Glorious Virtues?<BR>
 Countless colors, and countless waves of joy; He is the Master of all. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Endless spiritual wisdom, endless meditations, endless chants, intense meditations and austere self-disciplines.<BR>
 Countless virtues, musical notes and playful sports; countless silent sages enshrine Him in their hearts. ||1||<BR>
 Countless melodies, countless instruments, countless tastes, each and every instant. Countless mistakes and countless diseases are removed by hearing His Praise.<BR>
 O Nanak, serving the Infinite, Divine Lord, one earns all the rewards and merits of performing the six rituals, fasts, worship services, pilgrimages to sacred rivers, and journeys to sacred shrines. ||2||1||57||8||21||7||57||93||<BR>
 Bhairao, Ashtapadees, First Mehl, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The Lord is in the soul, and the soul is in the Lord. This is realized through the Guru's Teachings.<BR>
 The Ambrosial Word of the Guru's Bani is realized through the Word of the Shabad. Sorrow is dispelled, and egotism is eliminated. ||1||<BR>
 O Nanak, the disease of egotism is so very deadly.<BR>
 Wherever I look, I see the pain of the same disease. The Primal Lord Himself bestows the Shabad of His Word. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 When the Appraiser Himself appraises the mortal, then he is not tested again.<BR>
 Those who are blessed with His Grace meet with the Guru. They alone are true, who are pleasing to God. ||2||<BR>
 Air, water and fire are diseased; the world with its enjoyments is diseased.<BR>
 Mother, father, Maya and the body are diseased; those united with their relatives are diseased. ||3||<BR>
 Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are diseased; the whole world is diseased.<BR>
 Those who remember the Lord's Feet and contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad are liberated. ||4||<BR>
 The seven seas are diseased, along with the rivers; the continents and the nether regions of the underworlds are full of disease.<BR>
 The people of the Lord dwell in Truth and peace; He blesses them with His Grace everywhere. ||5||<BR>
 The six Shaastras are diseased, as are the many who follow the different religious orders.<BR>
 What can the poor Vedas and Bibles do? People do not understand the One and Only Lord. ||6||<BR>
 Eating sweet treats, the mortal is filled with disease; he finds no peace at all.<BR>
 Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they walk on other paths, and at the very last moment, they regret and repent. ||7||<BR>
 Wandering around at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, the mortal is not cured of his disease. Reading scripture, he gets involved in useless arguments.<BR>
 The disease of duality is so very deadly; it causes dependence on Maya. ||8||<BR>
 One who becomes Gurmukh and praises the True Shabad with the True Lord in his mind is cured of his disease.<BR>
 O Nanak, the humble servant of the Lord is immaculate, night and day; he bears the insignia of the Lord's Grace. ||9||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 030</H2></CENTER>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The Creator has staged His Wondrous Play.<BR>
 I listen to the Unstruck Sound-current of the Shabad, and the Bani of His Word.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs are deluded and confused, while the Gurmukhs understand.<BR>
 The Creator creates the Cause that causes. ||1||<BR>
 Deep within my being, I meditate on the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 I shall never forsake the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Prahlaad's father sent him to school, to learn to read.<BR>
 He took his writing tablet and went to the teacher.<BR>
 He said, "I shall not read anything except the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Write the Lord's Name on my tablet."||2||<BR>
 Prahlaad's mother said to her son,<BR>
 "I advise you not to read anything except what you are taught."<BR>
 He answered, "The Great Giver, my Fearless Lord God is always with me.<BR>
 If I were to forsake the Lord, then my family would be disgraced."||3||<BR>
 "Prahlaad has corrupted all the other students.<BR>
 He does not listen to what I say, and he does his own thing.<BR>
 He instigated devotional worship in the townspeople."<BR>
 The gathering of the wicked people could not do anything against him. ||4||<BR>
 Sanda and Marka, his teachers, made the complaint.<BR>
 All the demons kept trying in vain.<BR>
 The Lord protected His humble devotee, and preserved his honor.<BR>
 What can be done by mere created beings? ||5||<BR>
 Because of his past karma, the demon ruled over his kingdom.<BR>
 He did not realize the Lord; the Lord Himself confused him.<BR>
 He started an argument with his son Prahlaad.<BR>
 The blind one did not understand that his death was approaching. ||6||<BR>
 Prahlaad was placed in a cell, and the door was locked.<BR>
 The fearless child was not afraid at all. He said, "Within my being, is the Guru, the Lord of the World."<BR>
 The created being tried to compete with his Creator, but he assumed this name in vain.<BR>
 That which was predestined for him has come to pass; he started an argument with the Lord's humble servant. ||7||<BR>
 The father raised the club to strike down Prahlaad, saying,<BR>
 "Where is your God, the Lord of the Universe, now?"<BR>
 He replied, "The Life of the World, the Great Giver, is my Help and Support in the end.<BR>
 Wherever I look, I see Him permeating and prevailing."||8||<BR>
 Tearing down the pillars, the Lord Himself appeared.<BR>
 The egotistical demon was killed and destroyed.<BR>
 The minds of the devotees were filled with bliss, and congratulations poured in.<BR>
 He blessed His servant with glorious greatness. ||9||<BR>
 He created birth, death and attachment.<BR>
 The Creator has ordained coming and going in reincarnation.<BR>
 For the sake of Prahlaad, the Lord Himself appeared.<BR>
 The word of the devotee came true. ||10||<BR>
 The gods proclaimed the victory of Lakshmi, and said,<BR>
 "O mother, make this form of the Man-lion disappear!"<BR>
 Lakshmi was afraid, and did not approach.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 031</H2></CENTER>
 The humble servant Prahlaad came and fell at the Lord's Feet. ||11||<BR>
 The True Guru implanted the treasure of the Naam within.<BR>
 Power, property and all Maya is false.<BR>
 But still, the greedy people continue clinging to them.<BR>
 Without the Name of the Lord, the mortals are punished in His Court. ||12||<BR>
 Says Nanak, everyone acts as the Lord makes them act.<BR>
 They alone are approved and accepted, who focus their consciousness on the Lord.<BR>
 He has made His devotees His Own.<BR>
 The Creator has appeared in His Own Form. ||13||1||2||<BR>
 Bhairao, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Serving the Guru, I obtain the Ambrosial Fruit; my egotism and desire have been quenched.<BR>
 The Name of the Lord dwells within my heart and mind, and the desires of my mind are quieted. ||1||<BR>
 O Dear Lord, my Beloved, please bless me with Your Mercy.<BR>
 Night and day, Your humble servant begs for Your Glorious Praises; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he is saved. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Messenger of Death cannot even touch the humble Saints; it does not cause them even an iota of suffering or pain.<BR>
 Those who enter Your Sanctuary, Lord, save themselves, and save all their ancestors as well. ||2||<BR>
 You Yourself save the honor of Your devotees; this is Your Glory, O Lord.<BR>
 You cleanse them of the sins and the pains of countless incarnations; You love them without even an iota of duality. ||3||<BR>
 I am foolish and ignorant, and understand nothing. You Yourself bless me with understanding.<BR>
 You do whatever You please; nothing else can be done at all. ||4||<BR>
 Creating the world, You have linked all to their tasks - even the evil deeds which men do.<BR>
 They lose this precious human life in the gamble, and do not understand the Word of the Shabad. ||5||<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs die, understanding nothing; they are enveloped by the darkness of evil-mindedness and ignorance.<BR>
 They do not cross over the terrible world-ocean; without the Guru, they drown and die. ||6||<BR>
 True are those humble beings who are imbued with the True Shabad; the Lord God unites them with Himself.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Bani, they come to understand the Shabad. They remain lovingly focused on the True Lord. ||7||<BR>
 You Yourself are Immaculate and Pure, and pure are Your humble servants who contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 Nanak is forever a sacrifice to those, who enshrine the Lord's Name within their hearts. ||8||2||3||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl, Ashtapadees, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 He alone is a great king, who keeps the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within his heart.<BR>
 One who keeps the Naam in his heart - his tasks are perfectly accomplished.<BR>
 One who keeps the Naam in his heart, obtains millions of treasures.<BR>
 Without the Naam, life is useless. ||1||<BR>
 I praise that person, who has the capital of the Lord's Wealth.<BR>
 He is very fortunate, on whose forehead the Guru has placed His Hand. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 One who keeps the Naam in his heart, has many millions of armies on his side.<BR>
 One who keeps the Naam in his heart, enjoys peace and poise.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 032</H2></CENTER>
 One who keeps the Naam in his heart becomes cool and calm.<BR>
 Without the Naam, both life and death are cursed. ||2||<BR>
 One who keeps the Naam in his heart is Jivan-mukta, liberated while yet alive.<BR>
 One who keeps the Naam in his heart knows all ways and means.<BR>
 One who keeps the Naam in his heart obtains the nine treasures.<BR>
 Without the Naam, the mortal wanders, coming and going in reincarnation. ||3||<BR>
 One who keeps the Naam in his heart is carefree and independent.<BR>
 One who keeps the Naam in his heart always earns a profit.<BR>
 One who keeps the Naam in his heart has a large family.<BR>
 Without the Naam, the mortal is just an ignorant, self-willed manmukh. ||4||<BR>
 One who keeps the Naam in his heart has a permanent position.<BR>
 One who keeps the Naam in his heart is seated on the throne.<BR>
 One who keeps the Naam in his heart is the true king.<BR>
 Without the Naam, no one has any honor or respect. ||5||<BR>
 One who keeps the Naam in his heart is famous everywhere.<BR>
 One who keeps the Naam in his heart is the Embodiment of the Creator Lord.<BR>
 One who keeps the Naam in his heart is the highest of all.<BR>
 Without the Naam, the mortal wanders in reincarnation. ||6||<BR>
 One who keeps the Naam in his heart sees the Lord manifested in His Creation.<BR>
 One who keeps the Naam in his heart - his darkness is dispelled.<BR>
 One who keeps the Naam in his heart is approved and accepted.<BR>
 Without the Naam, the mortal continues coming and going in reincarnation. ||7||<BR>
 He alone receives the Naam, who is blessed by the Lord's Mercy.<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the Lord of the World is understood.<BR>
 Coming and going in reincarnation ends, and peace is found.<BR>
 Says Nanak, my essence has merged in the Essence of the Lord. ||8||1||4||<BR>
 Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 He created millions of incarnations of Vishnu.<BR>
 He created millions of universes as places to practice righteousness.<BR>
 He created and destroyed millions of Shivas.<BR>
 He employed millions of Brahmas to create the worlds. ||1||<BR>
 Such is my Lord and Master, the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 I cannot even describe His Many Virtues. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Millions of Mayas are His maid-servants.<BR>
 Millions of souls are His beds.<BR>
 Millions of universes are the limbs of His Being.<BR>
 Millions of devotees abide with the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Millions of kings with their crowns and canopies bow before Him.<BR>

 Millions of swan-souls sing His Immaculate Praises.<BR>

 He has given me the Priceless Jewel of the Lord's Name.<BR>
 Now, I intuitively enjoy endless pleasures and wondrous play.<BR>
 God has spontaneously met with Nanak. ||1||<BR>

 Spontaneously, I behold God in each and every heart. ||5||<BR>
 Spontaneously, all my doubts have been dispelled.<BR>
 Spontaneously, peace and celestial harmony fill my mind.<BR>
 Spontaneously, the Unstruck Melody of the Sound-current resounds within me.<BR>
 Spontaneously, the Lord of the Universe has revealed Himself to me. ||6||<BR>
 Spontaneously, my mind has been pleased and appeased.<BR>
 I have spontaneously realized the Eternal, Unchanging Lord.<BR>
 Spontaneously, all wisdom and knowledge has welled up within me.<BR>
 Spontaneously, the Support of the Lord, Har, Har, has come into my hands. ||7||<BR>
 Spontaneously, God has recorded my pre-ordained destiny.<BR>
 Spontaneously, the One Lord and Master God has met me.<BR>
 Spontaneously, all my cares and worries have been taken away.<BR>
 Nanak, Nanak, Nanak, has merged into the Image of God. ||8||3||6||<BR>
 Bhairao, The Word Of The Devotees, Kabeer Jee, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The Name of the Lord - this alone is my wealth.<BR>
 I do not tie it up to hide it, nor do I sell it to make my living. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Name is my crop, and the Name is my field.<BR>
 As Your humble servant, I perform devotional worship to You; I seek Your Sanctuary. ||1||<BR>
 The Name is Maya and wealth for me; the Name is my capital.<BR>
 I do not forsake You; I do not know any other at all. ||2||<BR>
 The Name is my family, the Name is my brother.<BR>
 The Name is my companion, who will help me in the end. ||3||<BR>
 One whom the Lord keeps detached from Maya<BR>
 - says Kabeer, I am his slave. ||4||1||<BR>
 Naked we come, and naked we go.<BR>
 No one, not even the kings and queens, shall remain. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 034</H2></CENTER>
 The Sovereign Lord is the nine treasures for me.<BR>
 The possessions and the spouse to which the mortal is lovingly attached, are Your wealth, O Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 They do not come with the mortal, and they do not go with him.<BR>
 What good does it do him, if he has elephants tied up at his doorway? ||2||<BR>
 The fortress of Sri Lanka was made out of gold,<BR>
 but what could the foolish Raawan take with him when he left? ||3||<BR>
 Says Kabeer, think of doing some good deeds.<BR>
 In the end, the gambler shall depart empty-handed. ||4||2||<BR>
 Brahma is polluted, and Indra is polluted.<BR>
 The sun is polluted, and the moon is polluted. ||1||<BR>
 This world is polluted with pollution.<BR>
 Only the One Lord is Immaculate; He has no end or limitation. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The rulers of kingdoms are polluted.<BR>
 Nights and days, and the days of the month are polluted. ||2||<BR>
 The pearl is polluted, the diamond is polluted.<BR>
 Wind, fire and water are polluted. ||3||<BR>
 Shiva, Shankara and Mahaysh are polluted.<BR>
 The Siddhas, seekers and strivers, and those who wear religious robes, are polluted. ||4||<BR>
 The Yogis and wandering hermits with their matted hair are polluted.<BR>
 The body, along with the swan-soul, is polluted. ||5||<BR>
 Says Kabeer, those humble beings are approved and pure, who know the Lord. ||6||3||<BR>
 Let your mind be Mecca, and your body the temple of worship.<BR>
 Let the Supreme Guru be the One who speaks. ||1||<BR>
 O Mullah, utter the call to prayer.<BR>
 The one mosque has ten doors. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 So slaughter your evil nature, doubt and cruelty;<BR>
 consume the five demons and you shall be blessed with contentment. ||2||<BR>
 Hindus and Muslims have the same One Lord and Master.<BR>
 What can the Mullah do, and what can the Shaykh do? ||3||<BR>
 Says Kabeer, I have gone insane.<BR>
 Slaughtering, slaughtering my mind, I have merged into the Celestial Lord. ||4||4||<BR>
 When the stream flows into the Ganges, then it becomes the Ganges. ||1||<BR>
 Just so, Kabeer has changed.<BR>
 He has become the Embodiment of Truth, and he does not go anywhere else. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Associating with the sandalwood tree, the tree nearby is changed;<BR>
 that tree begins to smell just like the sandalwood tree. ||2||<BR>
 Coming into contact with the philosophers' stone, copper is transformed;<BR>
 that copper is transformed into gold. ||3||<BR>
 In the Society of the Saints, Kabeer is transformed;<BR>
 that Kabeer is transformed into the Lord. ||4||5||<BR>
 Some apply ceremonial marks to their foreheads, hold malas in their hands, and wear religious robes.<BR>
 Some people think that the Lord is a play-thing. ||1||<BR>
 If I am insane, then I am Yours, O Lord.<BR>
 How can people know my secret? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I do not pick leaves as offerings, and I do not worship idols.<BR>
 Without devotional worship of the Lord, service is useless. ||2||<BR>
 I worship the True Guru; forever and ever, I surrender to Him.<BR>
 By such service, I find peace in the Court of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 People say that Kabeer has gone insane.<BR>
 Only the Lord realizes the secret of Kabeer. ||4||6||<BR>
 Turning away from the world, I have forgotten both my social class and ancestry.<BR>
 My weaving now is in the most profound celestial stillness. ||1||<BR>
 I have no quarrel with anyone.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 035</H2></CENTER>
 I have abandoned both the Pandits, the Hindu religious scholars, and the Mullahs, the Muslim priests. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I weave and weave, and wear what I weave.<BR>
 Where egotism does not exist, there I sing God's Praises. ||2||<BR>
 Whatever the Pandits and Mullahs have written,<BR>
 I reject; I do not accept any of it. ||3||<BR>
 My heart is pure, and so I have seen the Lord within.<BR>
 Searching, searching within the self, Kabeer has met the Lord. ||4||7||<BR>
 No one respects the poor man.<BR>
 He may make thousands of efforts, but no one pays any attention to him. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 When the poor man goes to the rich man,<BR>
 and sits right in front of him, the rich man turns his back on him. ||1||<BR>
 But when the rich man goes to the poor man,<BR>
 the poor man welcomes him with respect. ||2||<BR>
 The poor man and the rich man are both brothers.<BR>
 God's pre-ordained plan cannot be erased. ||3||<BR>
 Says Kabeer, he alone is poor,<BR>
 who does not have the Naam, the Name of the Lord, in his heart. ||4||8||<BR>
 Serving the Guru, devotional worship is practiced.<BR>
 Then, this human body is obtained.<BR>
 Even the gods long for this human body.<BR>
 So vibrate that human body, and think of serving the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Vibrate, and meditate on the Lord of the Universe, and never forget Him.<BR>
 This is the blessed opportunity of this human incarnation. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 As long as the disease of old age has not come to the body,<BR>
 and as long as death has not come and seized the body,<BR>
 and as long as your voice has not lost its power,<BR>
 O mortal being, vibrate and meditate on the Lord of the World. ||2||<BR>
 If you do not vibrate and meditate on Him now, when will you, O Sibing of Destiny?<BR>
 When the end comes, you will not be able to vibrate and meditate on Him.<BR>
 Whatever you have to do - now is the best time to do it.<BR>
 Otherwise, you shall regret and repent afterwards, and you shall not be carried across to the other side. ||3||<BR>
 He alone is a servant, whom the Lord enjoins to His service.<BR>
 He alone attains the Immaculate Divine Lord.<BR>
 Meeting with the Guru, his doors are opened wide,<BR>
 and he does not have to journey again on the path of reincarnation. ||4||<BR>
 This is your chance, and this is your time.<BR>
 Look deep into your own heart, and reflect on this.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, you can win or lose.<BR>
 In so many ways, I have proclaimed this out loud. ||5||1||9||<BR>
 In the City of God, sublime understanding prevails.<BR>
 There, you shall meet with the Lord, and reflect on Him.<BR>
 Thus, you shall understand this world and the next.<BR>
 What is the use of claiming that you own everything, if you only die in the end? ||1||<BR>
 I focus my meditation on my inner self, deep within.<BR>
 The Name of the Sovereign Lord is my spiritual wisdom. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 In the first chakra, the root chakra, I have grasped the reins and tied them.<BR>
 I have firmly placed the moon above the sun.<BR>
 The sun blazes forth at the western gate.<BR>
 Through the central channel of the Shushmanaa, it rises up above my head. ||2||<BR>
 There is a stone at that western gate,<BR>
 and above that stone, is another window.<BR>
 Above that window is the Tenth Gate.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, it has no end or limitation. ||3||2||10||<BR>
 He alone is a Mullah, who struggles with his mind,<BR>
 and through the Guru's Teachings, fights with death.<BR>
 He crushes the pride of the Messenger of Death.<BR>
 Unto that Mullah, I ever offer greetings of respect. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 036</H2></CENTER>
 God is present, right here at hand; why do you say that He is far away?<BR>
 Tie up your disturbing passions, and find the Beauteous Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He alone is a Qazi, who contemplates the human body,<BR>
 and through the fire of the body, is illumined by God.<BR>
 He does not lose his semen, even in his dreams;<BR>
 for such a Qazi, there is no old age or death. ||2||<BR>
 He alone is a sultan and a king, who shoots the two arrows,<BR>
 gathers in his outgoing mind,<BR>
 and assembles his army in the realm of the mind's sky, the Tenth Gate.<BR>
 The canopy of royalty waves over such a sultan. ||3||<BR>
 The Yogi cries out, "Gorakh, Gorakh".<BR>
 The Hindu utters the Name of Raam.<BR>
 The Muslim has only One God.<BR>
 The Lord and Master of Kabeer is all-pervading. ||4||3||11||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Those who call a stone their god<BR>
 - their service is useless.<BR>
 Those who fall at the feet of a stone god<BR>
 - their work is wasted in vain. ||1||<BR>
 My Lord and Master speaks forever.<BR>
 God gives His gifts to all living beings. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Divine Lord is within the self, but the spiritually blind one does not know this.<BR>
 Deluded by doubt, he is caught in the noose.<BR>
 The stone does not speak; it does not give anything to anyone.<BR>
 Such religious rituals are useless; such service is fruitless. ||2||<BR>
 If a corpse is anointed with sandalwood oil,<BR>
 what good does it do?<BR>
 If a corpse is rolled in manure,<BR>
 what does it lose from this? ||3||<BR>
 Says Kabeer, I proclaim this out loud<BR>
 - behold, and understand, you ignorant, faithless cynic.<BR>
 The love of duality has ruined countless homes.<BR>
 The Lord's devotees are forever in bliss. ||4||4||12||<BR>
 The fish in the water is attached to Maya.<BR>
 The moth fluttering around the lamp is pierced through by Maya.<BR>
 The sexual desire of Maya afflicts the elephant.<BR>
 The snakes and bumble bees are destroyed through Maya. ||1||<BR>
 Such are the enticements of Maya, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 As many living beings are there are, have been deceived. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The birds and the deer are imbued with Maya.<BR>
 Sugar is a deadly trap for the flies.<BR>
 Horses and camels are absorbed in Maya.<BR>
 The eighty-four Siddhas, the beings of miraculous spiritual powers, play in Maya. ||2||<BR>
 The six celibates are slaves of Maya.<BR>
 So are the nine masters of Yoga, and the sun and the moon.<BR>
 The austere disciplinarians and the Rishis are asleep in Maya.<BR>
 Death and the five demons are in Maya. ||3||<BR>
 Dogs and jackals are imbued with Maya.<BR>
 Monkeys, leopards and lions,<BR>
 cats, sheep, foxes,<BR>
 trees and roots are planted in Maya. ||4||<BR>
 Even the gods are drenched with Maya,<BR>
 as are the oceans, the sky and the earth.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, whoever has a belly to fill, is under the spell of Maya.<BR>
 The mortal is emancipated only when he meets the Holy Saint. ||5||5||13||<BR>
 As long as he cries out, "Mine! Mine!",<BR>
 none of his tasks is accomplished.<BR>
 When such possessiveness is erased and removed,<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 037</H2></CENTER>
 then God comes and resolves his affairs. ||1||<BR>
 Contemplate such spiritual wisdom, O mortal man.<BR>
 Why not meditate in remembrance on the Lord, the Destroyer of pain? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 As long as the tiger lives in the forest,<BR>
 the forest does not flower.<BR>
 But when the jackal eats the tiger,<BR>
 then the entire forest flowers. ||2||<BR>
 The victorious are drowned, while the defeated swim across.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, one crosses over and is saved.<BR>
 Slave Kabeer speaks and teaches:<BR>
 remain lovingly absorbed, attuned to the Lord alone. ||3||6||14||<BR>
 He has 7,000 commanders,<BR>
 and hundreds of thousands of prophets;<BR>
 He is said to have 88,000,000 shaykhs,<BR>
 and 56,000,000 attendants. ||1||<BR>
 I am meek and poor - what chance do I have of being heard there?<BR>
 His Court is so far away; only a rare few attain the Mansion of His Presence. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He has 33,000,000 play-houses.<BR>
 His beings wander insanely through 8.4 million incarnations.<BR>
 He bestowed His Grace on Adam, the father of mankind,<BR>
 who then lived in paradise for a long time. ||2||<BR>
 Pale are the faces of those whose hearts are disturbed.<BR>
 They have forsaken their Bible, and practice Satanic evil.<BR>
 One who blames the world, and is angry with people,<BR>
 shall receive the fruits of his own actions. ||3||<BR>
 You are the Great Giver, O Lord; I am forever a beggar at Your Door.<BR>
 If I were to deny You, then I would be a wretched sinner.<BR>
 Slave Kabeer has entered Your Shelter.<BR>
 Keep me near You, O Merciful Lord God - that is heaven for me. ||4||7||15||<BR>
 Everyone speaks of going there,<BR>
 but I do not even know where heaven is. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 One who does not even know the mystery of his own self,<BR>
 speaks of heaven, but it is only talk. ||1||<BR>
 As long as the mortal hopes for heaven,<BR>
 he will not dwell at the Lord's Feet. ||2||<BR>
 Heaven is not a fort with moats and ramparts, and walls plastered with mud;<BR>
 I do not know what heaven's gate is like. ||3||<BR>
 Says Kabeer, now what more can I say?<BR>
 The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is heaven itself. ||4||8||16||<BR>
 How can the beautiful fortress be conquered, O Siblings of Destiny?<BR>
 It has double walls and triple moats. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 It is defended by the five elements, the twenty-five categories, attachment, pride, jealousy and the awesomely powerful Maya.<BR>
 The poor mortal being does not have the strength to conquer it; what should I do now, O Lord? ||1||<BR>
 Sexual desire is the window, pain and pleasure are the gate-keepers, virtue and sin are the gates.<BR>
 Anger is the great supreme commander, full of argument and strife, and the mind is the rebel king there. ||2||<BR>
 Their armor is the pleasure of tastes and flavors, their helmets are worldly attachments; they take aim with their bows of corrupt intellect.<BR>
 The greed that fills their hearts is the arrow; with these things, their fortress is impregnable. ||3||<BR>
 But I have made divine love the fuse, and deep meditation the bomb; I have launched the rocket of spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 The fire of God is lit by intuition, and with one shot, the fortress is taken. ||4||<BR>
 Taking truth and contentment with me, I begin the battle and storm both the gates.<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and by Guru's Grace, I have captured the king of the fortress. ||5||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 038</H2></CENTER>
 With the army of God's devotees, and Shakti, the power of meditation, I have snapped the noose of the fear of death.<BR>
 Slave Kabeer has climbed to the top of the fortress; I have obtained the eternal, imperishable domain. ||6||9||17||<BR>
 The mother Ganges is deep and profound.<BR>
 Tied up in chains, they took Kabeer there. ||1||<BR>
 My mind was not shaken; why should my body be afraid?<BR>
 My consciousness remained immersed in the Lotus Feet of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The waves of the Ganges broke the chains,<BR>
 and Kabeer was seated on a deer skin. ||2||<BR>
 Says Kabeer, I have no friend or companion.<BR>
 On the water, and on the land, the Lord is my Protector. ||3||10||18||<BR>
 Bhairao, Kabeer Jee, Ashtapadees, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 God constructed a fortress, inaccessible and unreachable, in which He dwells.<BR>
 There, His Divine Light radiates forth.<BR>
 Lightning blazes, and bliss prevails there,<BR>
 where the Eternally Young Lord God abides. ||1||<BR>
 This soul is lovingly attuned to the Lord's Name.<BR>
 It is saved from old age and death, and its doubt runs away. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Those who believe in high and low social classes,<BR>
 only sing songs and chants of egotism.<BR>
 The Unstruck Sound-current of the Shabad, the Word of God, resounds in that place,<BR>
 where the Supreme Lord God abides. ||2||<BR>
 He creates planets, solar systems and galaxies;<BR>
 He destroys the three worlds, the three gods and the three qualities.<BR>
 The Inaccessible and Unfathomable Lord God dwells in the heart.<BR>
 No one can find the limits or the secrets of the Lord of the World. ||3||<BR>
 The Lord shines forth in the plantain flower and the sunshine.<BR>
 He dwells in the pollen of the lotus flower.<BR>
 The Lord's secret is within the twelve petals of the heart-lotus.<BR>
 The Supreme Lord, the Lord of Lakshmi dwells there. ||4||<BR>
 He is like the sky, stretching across the lower, upper and middle realms.<BR>
 In the profoundly silent celestial realm, He radiates forth.<BR>
 Neither the sun nor the moon are there,<BR>
 but the Primal Immaculate Lord celebrates there. ||5||<BR>
 Know that He is in the universe, and in the body as well.<BR>
 Take your cleansing bath in the Mansarovar Lake.<BR>
 Chant "Sohang" - "He is me."<BR>
 He is not affected by either virtue or vice. ||6||<BR>
 He is not affected by either high or low social class, sunshine or shade.<BR>
 He is in the Guru's Sanctuary, and nowhere else.<BR>
 He is not diverted by diversions, comings or goings.<BR>
 Remain intuitively absorbed in the celestial void. ||7||<BR>
 One who knows the Lord in the mind<BR>
 - whatever he says, comes to pass.<BR>
 One who firmly implants the Lord's Divine Light, and His Mantra within the mind<BR>
 - says Kabeer, such a mortal crosses over to the other side. ||8||1||<BR>
 Millions of suns shine for Him,<BR>
 millions of Shivas and Kailash mountains.<BR>
 Millions of Durga goddesses massage His Feet.<BR>
 Millions of Brahmas chant the Vedas for Him. ||1||<BR>
 When I beg, I beg only from the Lord.<BR>
 I have nothing to do with any other deities. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Millions of moons twinkle in the sky.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 039</H2></CENTER>
 Three hundred thirty million gods eat the Lord's offerings.<BR>
 The nine stars, a million times over, stand at His Door.<BR>
 Millions of Righteous Judges of Dharma are His gate-keepers. ||2||<BR>
 Millions of winds blow around Him in the four directions.<BR>
 Millions of serpents prepare His bed.<BR>
 Millions of oceans are His water-carriers.<BR>
 The eighteen million loads of vegetation are His Hair. ||3||<BR>
 Millions of treasurers fill His Treasury.<BR>
 Millions of Lakshmis adorn themselves for Him.<BR>
 Many millions of vices and virtues look up to Him.<BR>
 Millions of Indras serve Him. ||4||<BR>
 Fifty-six million clouds are His.<BR>
 In each and every village, His infinite fame has spread.<BR>
 Wild demons with dishevelled hair move about.<BR>
 The Lord plays in countless ways. ||5||<BR>
 Millions of charitable feasts are held in His Court,<BR>
 and millions of celestial singers celebrate His victory.<BR>
 Millions of sciences all sing His Praises.<BR>
 Even so, the limits of the Supreme Lord God cannot be found. ||6||<BR>
 Rama, with millions of monkeys, conquered Raawan's army.<BR>
 Billions of Puraanas greatly praise Him;<BR>
 He humbled the pride of Duyodhan. ||7||<BR>
 Millions of gods of love cannot compete with Him.<BR>
 He steals the hearts of mortal beings.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, please hear me, O Lord of the World.<BR>
 I beg for the blessing of fearless dignity. ||8||2||18||20||<BR>
 Bhairao, The Word Of Naam Dayv Jee, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 O my tongue, I will cut you into a hundred pieces,<BR>
 if you do not chant the Name of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O my tongue, be imbued with the Lord's Name.<BR>
 Meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and imbue yourself with this most excellent color. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 O my tongue, other occupations are false.<BR>
 The state of Nirvaanaa comes only through the Lord's Name. ||2||<BR>
 The performance of countless millions of other devotions<BR>
 is not equal to even one devotion to the Name of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Prays Naam Dayv, this is my occupation.<BR>
 O Lord, Your Forms are endless. ||4||1||<BR>
 One who stays away from others' wealth and others' spouses<BR>
 - the Lord abides near that person. ||1||<BR>
 Those who do not meditate and vibrate on the Lord<BR>
 - I do not even want to see them. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Those whose inner beings are not in harmony with the Lord,<BR>
 are nothing more than beasts. ||2||<BR>
 Prays Naam Dayv, a man without a nose<BR>
 does not look handsome, even if he has the thirty-two beauty marks. ||3||2||<BR>
 Naam Dayv milked the brown cow, and brought a cup of milk and a jug of water to his family god. ||1||<BR>
 "Please drink this milk, O my Sovereign Lord God.<BR>
 Drink this milk and my mind will be happy.<BR>
 Otherwise, my father will be angry with me."||1||Pause||<BR>
 Taking the golden cup, Naam Dayv filled it with the ambrosial milk,<BR>
 and placed it before the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 The Lord looked upon Naam Dayv and smiled. "This one devotee abides within my heart."||3||<BR>
 The Lord drank the milk, and the devotee returned home.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 040</H2></CENTER>
 Thus did Naam Dayv come to receive the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||4||3||<BR>
 I am crazy - the Lord is my Husband.<BR>
 I decorate and adorn myself for Him. ||1||<BR>
 Slander me well, slander me well, slander me well, O people.<BR>
 My body and mind are united with my Beloved Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Do not engage in any arguments or debates with anyone.<BR>
 With your tongue, savor the Lord's sublime essence. ||2||<BR>
 Now, I know within my soul, that such an arrangement has been made;<BR>
 I will meet with my Lord by the beat of the drum. ||3||<BR>
 Anyone can praise or slander me.<BR>
 Naam Dayv has met the Lord. ||4||4||<BR>
 Sometimes, people do not appreciate milk, sugar and ghee.<BR>
 Sometimes, they have to beg for bread from door to door.<BR>
 Sometimes, they have to pick out the grain from the chaff. ||1||<BR>
 As the Lord keeps us, so do we live, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 The Lord's Glory cannot even be described. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Sometimes, people prance around on horses.<BR>
 Sometimes, they do not even have shoes for their feet. ||2||<BR>
 Sometimes, people sleep on cozy beds with white sheets.<BR>
 Sometimes, they do not even have straw to put down on the ground. ||3||<BR>
 Naam Dayv prays, only the Naam, the Name of the Lord, can save us.<BR>
 One who meets the Guru, is carried across to the other side. ||4||5||<BR>
 Laughing and playing, I came to Your Temple, O Lord.<BR>
 While Naam Dayv was worshipping, he was grabbed and driven out. ||1||<BR>
 I am of a low social class, O Lord;<BR>
 why was I born into a family of fabric dyers? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I picked up my blanket and went back,<BR>
 to sit behind the temple. ||2||<BR>
 As Naam Dayv uttered the Glorious Praises of the Lord,<BR>
 the temple turned around to face the Lord's humble devotee. ||3||6||<BR>
 Bhairao, Naam Dayv Jee, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 As the hungry person loves food,<BR>
 and the thirsty person is obsessed with water,<BR>
 and as the fool is attached to his family<BR>
 - just so, the Lord is very dear to Naam Dayv. ||1||<BR>
 Naam Dayv is in love with the Lord.<BR>
 He has naturally and intuitively become detached from the world. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Like the woman who falls in love with another man,<BR>
 and the greedy man who loves only wealth,<BR>
 and the sexually promiscuous man who loves women and sex,<BR>
 just so, Naam Dayv is in love with the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 But that alone is real love, which the Lord Himself inspires;<BR>
 by Guru's Grace, duality is eradicated.<BR>
 Such love never breaks; through it, the mortal remains merged in the Lord.<BR>
 Naam Dayv has focused his consciousness on the True Name. ||3||<BR>
 Like the love between the child and its mother,<BR>
 so is my mind imbued with the Lord.<BR>
 Prays Naam Dayv, I am in love with the Lord.<BR>
 The Lord of the Universe abides within my consciousness. ||4||1||7||<BR>
 The blind fool abandons the wife of his own home,<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 041</H2></CENTER>
 and has an affair with another woman.<BR>
 He is like the parrot, who is pleased to see the simbal tree;<BR>
 but in the end, he dies, stuck to it. ||1||<BR>
 The home of the sinner is on fire.<BR>
 It keeps burning, and the fire cannot be extinguished. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He does not go to see where the Lord is being worshipped.<BR>
 He abandons the Lord's Path, and takes the wrong path.<BR>
 He forgets the Primal Lord God, and is caught in the cycle of reincarnation.<BR>
 He throws away the Ambrosial Nectar, and gathers poison to eat. ||2||<BR>
 He is like the prostitute, who comes to dance,<BR>
 wearing beautiful clothes, decorated and adorned.<BR>
 She dances to the beat, exciting the breath of those who watch her.<BR>
 But the noose of the Messenger of Death is around her neck. ||3||<BR>
 One who has good karma recorded on his forehead,<BR>
 hurries to enter the Guru's Sanctuary.<BR>
 Says Naam Dayv, consider this:<BR>
 O Saints, this is the way to cross over to the other side. ||4||2||8||<BR>
 Sanda and Marka went and complained to Harnaakhash,<BR>
 "Your son does not read his lessons. We are tired of trying to teach him.<BR>
 He chants the Lord's Name, clapping his hands to keep the beat; he has spoiled all the other students. ||1||<BR>
 He chants the Lord's Name,<BR>
 and he has enshrined meditative remembrance of the Lord within his heart."||1||Pause||<BR>
 "Your father the king has conquered the whole world", said his mother the queen.<BR>
 "O Prahlad my son, you do not obey him, so he has decided to deal with you in another way."||2||<BR>
 The council of villians met and resolved to send Prahlaad into the life hereafter.<BR>
 Prahlaad was thrown off a mountain, into the water, and into a fire, but the Sovereign Lord God saved him, by changing the laws of nature. ||3||<BR>
 Harnaakhash thundered with rage and threatened to kill Prahlaad. "Tell me, who can save you?"<BR>
 Prahlaad answered, "The Lord, the Master of the three worlds, is contained even in this pillar to which I am tied."||4||<BR>
 The Lord who tore Harnaakhash apart with His nails proclaimed Himself the Lord of gods and men.<BR>
 Says Naam Dayv, I meditate on the Lord, the Man-lion, the Giver of fearless dignity. ||5||3||9||<BR>
 The Sultan said, "Listen, Naam Dayv:<BR>
 let me see the actions of your Lord."||1||<BR>
 The Sultan arrested Naam Dayv,<BR>
 and said, "Let me see your Beloved Lord."||1||Pause||<BR>
 "Bring this dead cow back to life.<BR>
 Otherwise, I shall cut off your head here and now."||2||<BR>
 Naam Dayv answered, "O king, how can this happen?<BR>
 No one can bring the dead back to life. ||3||<BR>
 I cannot do anything by my own actions.<BR>
 Whatever the Lord does, that alone happens."||4||<BR>
 The arrogant king was enraged at this reply.<BR>
 He incited an elephant to attack. ||5||<BR>
 Naam Dayv's mother began to cry,<BR>
 and she said, "Why don't you abandon your Lord Raam, and worship his Lord Allah?"||6||<BR>
 Naam Dayv answered, "I am not your son, and you are not my mother.<BR>
 Even if my body dies, I will still sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord."||7||<BR>
 The elephant attacked him with his trunk,<BR>
 but Naam Dayv was saved, protected by the Lord. ||8||<BR>
 The king said, "The Qazis and the Mullahs bow down to me,<BR>
 but this Hindu has trampled my honor."||9||<BR>
 The people pleaded with the king, "Hear our prayer, O king.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 28 - Raag Bhairao - Part 042</H2></CENTER>
 Here, take Naam Dayv's weight in gold, and release him."||10||<BR>
 The king replied, "If I take the gold, then I will be consigned to hell,<BR>
 by forsaking my faith and gathering worldly wealth."||11||<BR>
 With his feet in chains, Naam Dayv kept the beat with his hands,<BR>
 singing the Praises of the Lord. ||12||<BR>
 "Even if the Ganges and the Jamunaa rivers flow backwards,<BR>
 I will still continue singing the Praises of the Lord."||13||<BR>
 Three hours passed,<BR>
 and even then, the Lord of the three worlds had not come. ||14||<BR>
 Playing on the instrument of the feathered wings,<BR>
 the Lord of the Universe came, mounted on the eagle garura. ||15||<BR>
 He cherished His devotee,<BR>
 and the Lord came, mounted on the eagle garura. ||16||<BR>
 The Lord said to him, "If you wish, I shall turn the earth sideways.<BR>
 If you wish, I shall turn it upside down. ||17||<BR>
 If you wish, I shall bring the dead cow back to life.<BR>
 Everyone will see and be convinced."||18||<BR>
 Naam Dayv prayed, and milked the cow.<BR>
 He brought the calf to the cow, and milked her. ||19||<BR>
 When the pitcher was filled with milk,<BR>
 Naam Dayv took it and placed it before the king. ||20||<BR>
 The king went into his palace,<BR>
 and his heart was troubled. ||21||<BR>
 Through the Qazis and the Mullahs, the king offered his prayer,<BR>
 "Forgive me, please, O Hindu; I am just a cow before you."||22||<BR>
 Naam Dayv said, "Listen, O king:<BR>
 have I done this miracle? ||23||<BR>
 The purpose of this miracle is<BR>
 that you, O king, should walk on the path of truth and humility."||24||<BR>
 Naam Dayv became famous everywhere for this.<BR>
 The Hindus all went together to Naam Dayv. ||25||<BR>
 If the cow had not been revived,<BR>
 people would have lost faith in Naam Dayv. ||26||<BR>
 The fame of Naam Dayv spread throughout the world.<BR>
 The humble devotees were saved and carried across with him. ||27||<BR>
 All sorts of troubles and pains afflicted the slanderer.<BR>
 There is no difference between Naam Dayv and the Lord. ||28||1||10||<BR>
