 Is there any such friend, who can untie this difficult knot?<BR>
 O Nanak, the One Supreme Lord and Master of the earth reunites the separated ones. ||15||<BR>
 I run around in all directions, searching for the love of God.<BR>
 The five evil enemies are tormenting me; how can I destroy them?<BR>
 Shoot them with the sharp arrows of meditation on the Name of God.<BR>
 O Lord! The way to slaughter these terrible sadistic enemies is obtained from the Perfect Guru. ||16||<BR>
 The True Guru has blessed me with the bounty which shall never be exhausted.<BR>
 Eating and consuming it, all the Gurmukhs are emancipated.<BR>
 The Lord, in His Mercy, has blessed me with the treasure of the Ambrosial Naam.<BR>
 O Nanak, worship and adore the Lord, who never dies. ||17||<BR>
 Wherever the Lord's devotee goes is a blessed, beautiful place.<BR>
 All comforts are obtained, meditating on the Lord's Name.<BR>
 People praise and congratulate the devotee of the Lord, while the slanderers rot and die.<BR>
 Says Nanak, O friend, chant the Naam, and your mind shall be filled with bliss. ||18||<BR>
 The mortal never serves the Immaculate Lord, the Purifier of sinners.<BR>
 The mortal wastes away in false pleasures. How long can this go on?<BR>
 Why do you take such pleasure, looking at this mirage?<BR>
 O Lord! I am a sacrifice to those who are known and approved in the Court of the Lord. ||19||<BR>
 The fool commits countless foolish actions and so many sinful mistakes.<BR>
 The fool's body smells rotten, and turns to dust.<BR>
 He wanders lost in the darkness of pride, and never thinks of dying.<BR>
 O Lord! The mortal gazes upon the mirage; why does he think it is true? ||20||<BR>
 When someone's days are over, who can save him?<BR>
 How long can the physicians go on, suggesting various therapies?<BR>
 You fool, remember the One Lord; only He shall be of use to you in the end.<BR>
 O Lord! Without the Name, the body turns to dust, and everything goes to waste. ||21||<BR>
 Drink in the medicine of the Incomparable, Priceless Name.<BR>
 Meeting and joining together, the Saints drink it in, and give it to everyone.<BR>
 He alone is blessed with it, who is destined to receive it.<BR>
 O Lord! I am a sacrifice to those who enjoy the Love of the Lord. ||22||<BR>
 The physicians meet together in their assembly.<BR>
 The medicines are effective, when the Lord Himself stands in their midst.<BR>
 Their good deeds and karma become apparent.<BR>
 O Lord! Pains, diseases and sins all vanish from their bodies. ||23||<BR>
 Chaubolas, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 O Samman, if one could buy this love with money,<BR>
 then consider Raawan the king. He was not poor, but he could not buy it, even though he offered his head to Shiva. ||1||<BR>
 My body is drenched in love and affection for the Lord; there is no distance at all between us.<BR>
 My mind is pierced through by the Lotus Feet of the Lord. He is realized when one's intuitive consciousness is attuned to Him. ||2||<BR>
