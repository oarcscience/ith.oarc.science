<CENTER><H2>Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 001</H2></CENTER>
 One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<BR>
 Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 O Primal Lord God, You Yourself are the Creator, the Cause of all causes.<BR>
 You are All-pervading everywhere, totally filling all hearts.<BR>
 You are seen pervading the world; who can know Your State? You protect all; You are our Lord and Master.<BR>
 O my Imperishable and Formless Lord, You formed Yourself.<BR>
 You are the One and Only; no one else is like You.<BR>
 O Lord, You have no end or limitation. Who can contemplate You? You are the Father of the world, the Support of all life.<BR>
 Your devotees are at Your Door, O God - they are just like You. How can servant Nanak describe them with only one tongue?<BR>
 I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever a sacrifice to them. ||1||<BR>
 Streams of Ambrosial Nectar flow; Your Treasures are unweighable and overflowing in abundance. You are the Farthest of the far, Infinite and Incomparably Beautiful.<BR>
 You do whatever You please; You do not take advice from anyone else. In Your Home, creation and destruction happen in an instant.<BR>
 No one else is equal to You; Your Light is Immaculate and Pure. Millions of sins are washed away, chanting Your Name, Har, Har.<BR>
 Your devotees are at Your Door, God - they are just like You. How can servant Nanak describe them with only one tongue?<BR>
 I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever a sacrifice to them. ||2||<BR>
 You established all the worlds from within Yourself, and extended them outward. You are All-pervading amongst all, and yet You Yourself remain detached.<BR>
 O Lord, there is no end or limit to Your Glorious Virtues; all beings and creatures are Yours. You are the Giver of all, the One Invisible Lord.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 002</H2></CENTER>
 He Himself supports the Universe, revealing His All-powerful Creative Potency. He has no color, form, mouth or beard.<BR>
 Your devotees are at Your Door, O God - they are just like You. How can servant Nanak describe them with only one tongue?<BR>
 I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever a sacrifice to them. ||3||<BR>
 You are the Treasure of all virtue; who can know the value of Your spiritual wisdom and meditation? O God, Your Place is known as the highest of the high.<BR>
 Mind, wealth and the breath of life belong to You alone, Lord. The world is strung upon Your Thread. What praises can I give to You? You are the Greatest of the great.<BR>
 Who can know Your Mystery? O Unfathomable, Infinite, Divine Lord, Your Power is unstoppable. O God, You are the Support of all.<BR>
 Your devotees are at Your Door, O God - they are just like You. How can servant Nanak describe them with only one tongue?<BR>
 I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever a sacrifice to them. ||4||<BR>
 O Formless, Formed, Undeceivable, Perfect, Imperishable,<BR>
 Blissful, Unlimited, Beautiful, Immaculate, Blossoming Lord:<BR>
 Countless are those who sing Your Glorious Praises, but they do not know even a tiny bit of Your extent.<BR>
 That humble being upon whom You shower Your Mercy meets with You, O God.<BR>
 Blessed, blessed, blessed are those humble beings, upon whom the Lord, Har, Har, showers His Mercy.<BR>
 Whoever meets with the Lord through Guru Nanak is rid of both birth and death. ||5||<BR>
 The Lord is said to be True, True, True, True, the Truest of the True.<BR>
 There is no other like Him. He is the Primal Being, the Primal Soul.<BR>
 Chanting the Ambrosial Name of the Lord, the mortal is blessed with all comforts.<BR>
 Those who taste it with their tongues, those humble beings are satisfied and fulfilled.<BR>
 That person who becomes pleasing to his Lord and Master, loves the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.<BR>
 Whoever meets with the Lord through Guru Nanak, saves all his generations. ||6||<BR>
 True is His Congregation and His Court. The True Lord has established Truth.<BR>
 Sitting upon His Throne of Truth, He administers True Justice.<BR>
 The True Lord Himself fashioned the Universe. He is Infallible, and does not make mistakes.<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Infinite Lord, is the jewel. Its value cannot be appraised - it is priceless.<BR>
 That person, upon whom the Lord of the Universe showers His Mercy obtains all comforts.<BR>
 Those who touch the Feet of the Lord through Guru Nanak, do not have to enter the cycle of reincarnation ever again. ||7||<BR>
 What is the Yoga, what is the spiritual wisdom and meditation, and what is the way, to praise the Lord?<BR>
 The Siddhas and seekers and the three hundred thirty million gods cannot find even a tiny bit of the Lord's Value.<BR>
 Neither Brahma, nor Sanak, nor the thousand-headed serpent king can find the limits of His Glorious Virtues.<BR>
 The Inapprehensible Lord cannot be apprehended. He is pervading and permeating amongst all.<BR>
 Those whom God has mercifully freed from their nooses - those humble beings are attached to His devotional worship.<BR>
 Those who meet with the Lord through Guru Nanak are liberated forever, here and hereafter. ||8||<BR>
 I am a beggar; I seek the Sanctuary of God, the Giver of givers.<BR>
 Please bless me with the gift of the dust of the feet of the Saints; grasping them, I cross over the terrifying world-ocean.<BR>
 Please listen to my prayer, if it pleases You, O my Lord and Master.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 003</H2></CENTER>
 My mind yearns for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. This mind abides in devotional worship.<BR>
 The lamp is lit in the darkness; all are saved in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, through the One Name and faith in the Dharma.<BR>
 The Lord is revealed in all the worlds. O servant Nanak, the Guru is the Supreme Lord God. ||9||<BR>
 Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 This body is frail and transitory, and bound to emotional attachment. I am foolish, stone-hearted, filthy and unwise.<BR>
 My mind wanders and wobbles, and will not hold steady. It does not know the state of the Supreme Lord God.<BR>
 I am intoxicated with the wine of youth, beauty and the riches of Maya. I wander around perplexed, in excessive egotistical pride.<BR>
 The wealth and women of others, arguments and slander, are sweet and dear to my soul.<BR>
 I try to hide my deception, but God, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of Hearts, sees and hears all.<BR>
 I have no humility, faith, compassion or purity, but I seek Your Sanctuary, O Giver of life.<BR>
 The All-powerful Lord is the Cause of causes. O Lord and Master of Nanak, please save me! ||1||<BR>
 The Praises of the Creator, the Enticer of the mind, are potent to destroy sins.<BR>
 The All-powerful Lord is the boat, to carry us across; He saves all our generations.<BR>
 O my unconscious mind, contemplate and remember Him in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. Why are you wandering around, enticed by the darkness of doubt?<BR>
 Remember Him in meditation, for an hour, for a moment, even for an instant. Chant the Name of the Lord with your tongue.<BR>
 You are bound to worthless deeds and shallow pleasures; why do you spend millions of lifetimes wandering in such pain?<BR>
 Chant and vibrate the Name of the Lord, O Nanak, through the Teachings of the Saints. Meditate on the Lord with love in your soul. ||2||<BR>
 The little sperm is planted in the body-field of the mother, and the human body, so difficult to obtain, is formed.<BR>
 He eats and drinks, and enjoys pleasures; his pains are taken away, and his suffering is gone.<BR>
 He is given the understanding to recognize mother, father, siblings and relatives.<BR>
 He grows day by day, as the horrible specter of old age comes closer and closer.<BR>
 You worthless, petty worm of Maya - remember your Lord and Master, at least for an instant!<BR>
 Please take Nanak's hand, O Merciful Ocean of Mercy, and take away this heavy load of doubt. ||3||<BR>
 O mind, you are a mouse, living in the mousehole of the body; you are so proud of yourself, but you act like an absolute fool.<BR>
 You swing in the swing of wealth, intoxicated with Maya, and you wander around like an owl.<BR>
 You take pleasure in your children, spouse, friends and relatives; your emotional attachment to them is increasing.<BR>
 You have planted the seeds of egotism, and the sprout of possessiveness has come up. You pass your life making sinful mistakes.<BR>
 The cat of death, with his mouth wide-open, is watching you. You eat food, but you are still hungry.<BR>
 Meditate in remembrance on the Merciful Lord of the World, O Nanak, in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. Know that the world is just a dream. ||4||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 004</H2></CENTER>
 Neither body, nor house, nor love last forever. You are intoxicated with Maya; how long will you be proud of them?<BR>
 Neither crown, nor canopy, nor servants last forever. You do not consider in your heart that your life is passing away.<BR>
 Neither chariots, nor horses, nor elephants or royal thrones shall last forever. In an instant, you will have to leave them, and depart naked.<BR>
 Neither warrior, nor hero, nor king or ruler last forever; see this with your eyes.<BR>
 Neither fortress, nor shelter, nor treasure will save you; doing evil deeds, you shall depart empty-handed.<BR>
 Friends, children, spouses and friends - none of them last forever; they change like the shade of a tree.<BR>
 God is the Perfect Primal Being, Merciful to the meek; each and every instant, meditate in remembrance on Him, the Inaccessible and Infinite.<BR>
 O Great Lord and Master, servant Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary; please shower him with Your Mercy, and carry him across. ||5||<BR>
 I have used up my breath of life, sold my self-respect, begged for charity, committed highway robbery, and dedicated my consciousness to the love and pursuit of acquiring wealth.<BR>
 I have kept it secretly hidden from my friends, relatives, companions, children and siblings.<BR>
 I ran around practicing falsehood, burning up my body and growing old.<BR>
 I gave up good deeds, righteousness and Dharma, self-discipline, purity, religious vows and all good ways; I associated with the fickle Maya.<BR>
 Beasts and birds, trees and mountains - in so many ways, I wandered lost in reincarnation.<BR>
 I did not remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord, for a moment, or even an instant. He is the Master of the meek, the Lord of all life.<BR>
 The food and drink, and the sweet and tasty dishes became totally bitter at the last moment.<BR>
 O Nanak, I was saved in the Society of the Saints, at their feet; the others, intoxicated with Maya, have gone, leaving everything behind. ||6||<BR>
 Brahma, Shiva, the Vedas and the silent sages sing the Glorious Praises of their Lord and Master with love and delight.<BR>
 Indra, Vishnu and Gorakh, who come to earth and then go to heaven again, seek the Lord.<BR>
 The Siddhas, human beings, gods and demons cannot find even a tiny bit of His Mystery.<BR>
 The Lord's humble servants are imbued with love and affection for God their Beloved; in the delight of devotional worship, they are absorbed in the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.<BR>
 But those who forsake Him, and beg from another, shall see their mouths, teeth and tongues wear away.<BR>
 O my foolish mind, meditate in remembrance on the Lord, the Giver of peace. Slave Nanak imparts these teachings. ||7||<BR>
 The pleasures of Maya shall fade away. In doubt, the mortal falls into the deep dark pit of emotional attachment.<BR>
 He is so proud, even the sky cannot contain him. His belly is filled with manure, bones and worms.<BR>
 He runs around in the ten directions, for the sake of the great poison of corruption. He steals the wealth of others, and in the end, he is destroyed by his own ignorance.<BR>
 His youth passes away, the illnesses of old age seize him, and the Messenger of Death punishes him; such is the death he dies.<BR>
 He suffers the agony of hell in countless incarnations; he rots away in the pit of pain and condemnation.<BR>
 O Nanak, those whom the Saint mercifully takes as his own, are carried across by their loving devotional worship. ||8||<BR>
 All virtues are obtained, all fruits and rewards, and the desires of the mind; my hopes have been totally fulfilled.<BR>
 The Medicine, the Mantra, the Magic Charm, will cure all illnesses and totally take away all pain.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 005</H2></CENTER>
 Lust, anger, egotism, jealousy and desire are eliminated by chanting the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 The merits of cleansing baths, charity, penance, purity and good deeds, are obtained by enshrining the Lotus Feet of God within the heart.<BR>
 The Lord is my Friend, my Very Best Friend, Companion and Relative. God is the Sustenance of the soul, the Support of the breath of life.<BR>
 I have grasped the Shelter and Support of my All-powerful Lord and Master; slave Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him. ||9||<BR>
 Weapons cannot cut that person who delights in the love of the Lord's Lotus Feet.<BR>
 Ropes cannot bind that person whose mind is pierced through by the Vision of the Lord's Way.<BR>
 Fire cannot burn that person who is attached to the dust of the feet of the Lord's humble servant.<BR>
 Water cannot drown that person whose feet walk on the Lord's Path.<BR>
 O Nanak, diseases, faults, sinful mistakes and emotional attachment are pierced by the Arrow of the Name. ||1||10||<BR>
 People are engaged in making all sorts of efforts; they contemplate the various aspects of the six Shaastras.<BR>
 Rubbing ashes all over their bodies, they wander around at the various sacred shrines of pilgrimage; they fast until their bodies are emaciated, and braid their hair into tangled messes.<BR>
 Without devotional worship of the Lord, they all suffer in pain, caught in the tangled web of their love.<BR>
 They perform worship ceremonies, draw ritual marks on their bodies, cook their own food fanatically, and make pompous shows of themselves in all sorts of ways. ||2||11||20||<BR>

 Blessed is the Primal Lord God, the Creator, the All-powerful Cause of causes.<BR>
 Blessed is the True Guru Nanak, who placed His hand upon Your forehead.<BR>
 When He placed His hand upon Your forehead, then the celestial nectar began to rain down in torrents; the gods and human beings, heavenly heralds and sages were drenched in its fragrance.<BR>
 You challenged and subdued the cruel demon of death; You restrained Your wandering mind; You overpowered the five demons and You keep them in one home.<BR>

 Whoever accomplishes this most difficult task of contemplating the most sublime Word of the Shabad - those people cross over the terrifying world-ocean, and cast off their loads of sin.<BR>
 The Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, is celestial and sublime; whoever remains awake and aware, contemplating the Guru, embodies humility, and is imbued forever with the Supreme Love of the Lord.<BR>
 O KAL SAHAAR, chant the Praises of Lehnaa throughout the seven continents; He met with the Lord, and became Guru of the World. ||2||<BR>
 You hold tight to the Naam, the Name of the Infinite Lord; Your expanse is immaculate. You are the Support of the Siddhas and seekers, and the good and humble beings.<BR>
 You are the incarnation of King Janak; the contemplation of Your Shabad is sublime throughout the universe. You abide in the world like the lotus on the water.<BR>

 So speaks KALL: fruitful is the life of one who meets with Guru Amar Daas, radiant with the Light of God. ||8||<BR>
 On His right hand is the sign of the lotus; the Siddhis, the supernatural spiritual powers, await His Command.<BR>
 On His left are worldly powers, which fascinate the three worlds.<BR>
 The Inexpressible Lord abides in His Heart; He alone knows this joy.<BR>
 Guru Amar Daas utters the words of devotion, imbued with the Love of the Lord.<BR>
 On His forehead is the true insignia of the Lord's Mercy; with his palms pressed together, KALL meditates on Him.<BR>
 Whoever meets with the Guru, the certified True Guru, has all his desires fulfilled. ||9||<BR>
 Supremely fruitful are the feet which walk upon the path of Guru Amar Daas.<BR>
 Supremely fruitful are the hands which touch the feet of Guru Amar Daas.<BR>
 Supremely fruitful is the tongue which utters the praises of Guru Amar Daas.<BR>
 Supremely fruitful are the eyes which behold Guru Amar Daas.<BR>
 Supremely fruitful are the ears which hear the Praises of Guru Amar Daas.<BR>
 Fruitful is the heart in which Guru Amar Daas, the Father of the world, Himself abides.<BR>
 Fruitful is the head, says JAALAP, which bows forever before Guru Amar Daas. ||1||10||<BR>
 They do not suffer pain or hunger, and they cannot be called poor.<BR>
 They do not grieve, and their limits cannot be found.<BR>
 They do not serve anyone else, but they give gifts to hundreds and thousands.<BR>
 They sit on beautiful carpets; they establish and disestablish at will.<BR>
 They find peace in this world, and live fearlessly amidst their enemies.<BR>
 They are fruitful and prosperous, says JAALAP. Guru Amar Daas is pleased with them. ||2||11||<BR>
 You read about the One Lord, and enshrine Him in Your mind; You realize the One and Only Lord.<BR>
 With Your eyes and the words You speak, You dwell upon the One Lord; You do not know any other place of rest.<BR>
 You know the One Lord while dreaming, and the One Lord while awake. You are absorbed in the One.<BR>
 At the age of seventy-one, You began to march towards the Indestructible Lord.<BR>
 The One Lord, who takes hundreds of thousands of forms, cannot be seen. He can only be described as One.<BR>
 So speaks JAALAP: O Guru Amar Daas, You long for the One Lord, and believe in the One Lord alone. ||3||12||<BR>
 The understanding which Jai Dayv grasped, the understanding which permeated Naam Dayv,<BR>
 the understanding which was in the consciousness of Trilochan and known by the devotee Kabeer,<BR>
 by which Rukmaangad constantly meditated on the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny,<BR>
 which brought Ambreek and Prahlaad to seek the Sanctuary of the Lord of the Universe, and which brought them to salvation<BR>
 -says JALL that sublime understanding has brought You to renounce greed, anger and desire, and to know the way.<BR>
 Guru Amar Daas is the Lord's own devotee; gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, one is liberated. ||4||13||<BR>
 Meeting with Guru Amar Daas, the earth is purged of its sin.<BR>
 The Siddhas and seekers long to meet with Guru Amar Daas.<BR>
 Meeting with Guru Amar Daas, the mortal meditates on the Lord, and his journey comes to its end.<BR>
 Meeting with Guru Amar Daas, the Fearless Lord is obtained, and the cycle of reincarnation is brought to an end.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 011</H2></CENTER>
 Realizing the One Lord, love of duality ceases, and one comes to accept the Sublime Mantra of the Guru.<BR>
 So speaks JAALAP: countless treasures are obtained, by the sight of Guru Amar Daas. ||5||14||<BR>
 Guru Nanak gathered up the True Name of the Creator Lord, and implanted it within.<BR>
 Through Him, Lehnaa became manifest in the form of Guru Angad, who remained lovingly attuned to His Feet.<BR>
 Guru Amar Daas of that dynasty is the home of hope. How can I express His Glorious Virtues?<BR>
 His Virtues are unknowable and unfathomable. I do not know the limits of His Virtues.<BR>
 The Creator, the Architect of Destiny, has made Him a boat to carry all His generations across, along with the Sangat, the Holy Congregation.<BR>
 So speaks KEERAT: O Guru Amar Daas, please protect me and save me; I seek the Sanctuary of Your Feet. ||1||15||<BR>
 The Lord Himself wielded His Power and entered the world.<BR>
 The Formless Lord took form, and with His Light He illuminated the realms of the world.<BR>
 He is All-pervading everywhere; the Lamp of the Shabad, the Word, has been lit.<BR>
 Whoever gathers in the essence of the teachings shall be absorbed in the Feet of the Lord.<BR>
 Lehnaa, who became Guru Angad, and Guru Amar Daas, have been reincarnated into the pure house of Guru Nanak.<BR>
 Guru Amar Daas is our Saving Grace, who carries us across; in lifetime after lifetime, I seek the Sanctuary of Your Feet. ||2||16||<BR>
 Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, the Gursikh is blessed with chanting and deep meditation, truth and contentment.<BR>
 Whoever seeks His Sanctuary is saved; his account is cleared in the City of Death.<BR>
 His heart is totally filled with loving devotion; he chants to the Creator Lord.<BR>
 The Guru is the river of pearls; in an instant, he carries the drowning ones across.<BR>
 He was reincarnated into the House of Guru Nanak; He chants the Glorious Praises of the Creator Lord.<BR>
 Those who serve Guru Amar Daas - their pains and poverty are taken away, far away. ||3||17||<BR>
 I consciously pray within my consciousness, but I cannot express it in words.<BR>
 I place all my worries and anxieties before You; I look to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, for help.<BR>
 By the Hukam of Your Command, I am blessed with Your Insignia; I serve my Lord and Master.<BR>
 When You, O Guru, gaze at me with Your Glance of Grace, the fruit of the Naam, the Name of the Creator, is placed within my mouth.<BR>
 The Unfathomable and Unseen Primal Lord God, the Cause of causes - as He orders, so do I speak.<BR>
 O Guru Amar Daas, Doer of deeds, Cause of causes, as You keep me, I remain; as You protect me, I survive. ||4||18||<BR>
 OF BHIKHAA:<BR>
 In deep meditation, and the spiritual wisdom of the Guru, one's essence merges with the essence of reality.<BR>
 In truth, the True Lord is recognized and realized, when one is lovingly attuned to Him, with one-pointed consciousness.<BR>
 Lust and anger are brought under control, when the breath does not fly around, wandering restlessly.<BR>
 Dwelling in the land of the Formless Lord, realizing the Hukam of His Command, His contemplative wisdom is attained.<BR>
 In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Guru is the Form of the Creator, the Primal Lord God; he alone knows, who has tried it.<BR>
 So speaks BHIKHAA: I have met the Guru. With love and intuitive affection, He has bestowed the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. ||1||19||<BR>
 I have been searching for the Saints; I have seen so many Holy and spiritual people.<BR>
 The hermits, Sannyaasees, ascetics, penitents, fanatics and Pandits all speak sweetly.<BR>
 I wandered around lost for a year, but no one touched my soul.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 012</H2></CENTER>
 I listened to preachers and teachers, but I could not be happy with their lifestyles.<BR>
 Those who have abandoned the Lord's Name, and become attached to duality - why should I speak in praise of them?<BR>
 So speaks BHIKHAA: the Lord has led me to meet the Guru. As You keep me, I remain; as You protect me, I survive. ||2||20||<BR>
 Wearing the armor of Samaadhi, the Guru has mounted the saddled horse of spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 Holding the bow of Dharma in His Hands, He has shot the arrows of devotion and humility.<BR>
 He is fearless in the Fear of the Eternal Lord God; He has thrust the spear of the Word of the Guru's Shabad into the mind.<BR>
 He has cut down the five demons of unfulfilled sexual desire, unresolved anger, unsatisfied greed, emotional attachment and self-conceit.<BR>
 Guru Amar Daas, the son of Tayj Bhaan, of the noble Bhalla dynasty, blessed by Guru Nanak, is the Master of kings.<BR>
 SALL speaks the truth; O Guru Amar Daas, you have conquered the army of evil, fighting the battle this way. ||1||21||<BR>
 The raindrops of the clouds, the plants of the earth, and the flowers of the spring cannot be counted.<BR>
 Who can know the limits of the rays of the sun and the moon, the waves of the ocean and the Ganges?<BR>
 With Shiva's meditation and the spiritual wisdom of the True Guru, says BHALL the poet, these may be counted.<BR>
 O Guru Amar Daas, Your Glorious Virtues are so sublime; Your Praises belong only to You. ||1||22||<BR>
 Swaiyas In Praise Of The Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Meditate single-mindedly on the Immaculate Primal Lord God.<BR>

 Meditate on the Imperishable, Formless Lord God.<BR>
 Meeting with Him, one escapes poverty.<BR>
 KAL SAHAAR chants His Glorious Praises.<BR>
 I chant the pure praises of that humble being who has been blessed with the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 He served the True Guru and was blessed with the sublime essence of the Shabad, the Word of God. The Immaculate Naam has been enshrined in his heart.<BR>
 He enjoys and savors the Lord's Name, and purchases the Glorious Virtues of the Lord of the Universe. He seeks the essence of reality; he is the Fountain of even-handed justice.<BR>
 So speaks KALL the poet: Guru Raam Daas, the son of Har Daas, fills the empty pools to overflowing. ||1||<BR>
 The stream of ambrosial nectar flows and the immortal status is obtained; the pool is forever overflowing with Ambrosial Nectar.<BR>
 Those Saints who have served the Lord in the past drink in this Nectar, and bathe their minds in it.<BR>
 God takes their fears away, and blesses them with the state of fearless dignity. Through the Word of His Shabad, He has saved them.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 013</H2></CENTER>
 The Merciful True Guru has implanted the Lord's Name within me, and by His Grace, I have overpowered the five thieves.<BR>
 So speaks KALL the poet: Guru Raam Daas, the son of Har Daas, fills the empty pools to overflowing. ||3||<BR>

 The Creator Lord certified the True Guru, and now the world blows the trumpet of His Praises.<BR>
 So speaks KALL: O Guru Raam Daas, You have attained the state of fearless immortality. ||6||<BR>
 O certified True Guru, You have conquered the world; You meditate single-mindedly on the One Lord.<BR>
 Blessed, blessed is Guru Amar Daas, the True Guru, who implanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord, deep within.<BR>
 The Naam is the wealth of the nine treasures; prosperity and supernatural spiritual powers are His slaves.<BR>
 He is blessed with the ocean of intuitive wisdom; He has met with the Imperishable Lord God.<BR>
 The Guru has implanted the Naam deep within; attached to the Naam, the devotees have been carried across since ancient times.<BR>
 So speaks KALL: O Guru Raam Daas, You have obtained the wealth of the Lord's Love. ||7||<BR>
 The flow of loving devotion and primal love does not stop.<BR>

 The Guru has pitched the tent; under it, all the ages are gathered.<BR>
 He carries the spear of intuition, and takes the Support of Naam, the Name of the Lord, through which the devotees are fulfilled.<BR>
 Guru Nanak, Guru Angad and Guru Amar Daas, through devotional worship, have merged into the Lord.<BR>
 O Guru Raam Daas, You alone know the taste of this Raja Yoga. ||12||<BR>
 He alone is enlightened like Janaka, who links the chariot of his mind to the state of ecstatic realization.<BR>
 He gathers in truth and contentment, and fills up the empty pool within.<BR>
 He speaks the Unspoken Speech of the eternal city. He alone obtains it, unto whom God gives it.<BR>
 O Guru Raam Daas, Your sovereign rule, like that of Janak, is Yours alone. ||13||<BR>
 Tell me, how can sin and suffering cling to that humble being who chants the Naam, given by the Guru, with single-minded love and firm faith?<BR>
 When the Lord, the Boat to carry us across, bestows His Glance of Grace, even for an instant, the mortal contemplates the Shabad within his heart; unfulfilled sexual desire and unresolved anger are eradicated.<BR>

 Dharmic faith and the karma of good deeds are obtained from the Perfect True Guru.<BR>
 The Siddhas and Holy Saadhus, the silent sages and angelic beings, yearn to serve Him; through the most excellent Word of the Shabad, they are lovingly attuned to the One Lord.<BR>
 Who can know Your limits? You are the Embodiment of the Fearless, Formless Lord. You are the Speaker of the Unspoken Speech; You alone understand this.<BR>

 You foolish mortal being, reflect on this in your mind; chant and meditate day and night. Dharmic faith and the karma of good deeds are obtained from the Perfect True Guru. ||2||<BR>
 I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, to the True Name, O my True Guru.<BR>
 What Praises can I offer to You? What service can I do for You? I have only one mouth and tongue; with my palms pressed together, I chant to You with joy and delight.<BR>
 In thought, word and deed, I know the Lord; I do not worship any other. The Guru has enshrined the most excellent Name of the Infinite Lord within my heart.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 015</H2></CENTER>
 So speaks NALL the poet: touching the Philosopher's Stone, glass is transformed into gold, and the sandalwood tree imparts its fragrance to other trees; meditating in remembrance on the Lord, I am transformed.<BR>
 Seeing His Door, I am rid of sexual desire and anger. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, to the True Name, O my True Guru. ||3||<BR>
 Guru Raam Daas was blessed with the Throne of Raja Yoga.<BR>
 First, Guru Nanak illuminated the world, like the full moon, and filled it with bliss. To carry humanity across, He bestowed His Radiance.<BR>
 He blessed Guru Angad with the treasure of spiritual wisdom, and the Unspoken Speech; He overcame the five demons and the fear of the Messenger of Death.<BR>
 The Great and True Guru, Guru Amar Daas, has preserved honor in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. Seeing His Lotus Feet, sin and evil are destroyed.<BR>
 When His mind was totally satisfied in every way, when He was totally pleased, He bestowed upon Guru Raam Daas the Throne of Raja Yoga. ||4||<BR>
 RADD:<BR>
 He established the earth, the sky and the air, the water of the oceans, fire and food.<BR>
 He created the moon, the starts and the sun, night and day and mountains; he blessed the trees with flowers and fruits.<BR>
 He created the gods, human beings and the seven seas; He established the three worlds.<BR>
 Guru Amar Daas was blessed with the Light of the One Name, the True Name of the Lord. ||1||5||<BR>

 The True Guru transforms ordinary wood into sandalwood, eradicating the pains of poverty.<BR>
 Whoever touches the Feet of the True Guru, is transformed from a beast and a ghost into an angelic being. ||2||6||<BR>
 One who has the Guru on his side - how could he be proud of his wealth?<BR>
 One who has the Guru on his side - what would hundreds of thousands of supporters do for him?<BR>
 One who has the Guru on his side, does not depend on anyone else for spiritual wisdom and meditation.<BR>
 One who has the Guru on his side contemplates the Shabad and the Teachings, and abides in the Home of Truth.<BR>
 The Lord's humble slave and poet utters this prayer: whoever chants to the Guru night and day,<BR>
 whoever enshrines the Name of the Guru within his heart, is rid of both birth and death. ||3||7||<BR>
 Without the Guru, there is utter darkness; without the Guru, understanding does not come.<BR>
 Without the Guru, there is no intuitive awareness or success; without the Guru, there is no liberation.<BR>
 So make Him your Guru, and contemplate the Truth; make Him your Guru, O my mind.<BR>
 Make Him your Guru, who is embellished and exalted in the Word of the Shabad; all your sins shall be washed away.<BR>
 So speaks NALL the poet: with your eyes, make Him your Guru; with the words you speak, make Him your Guru, your True Guru.<BR>
 Those who have not seen the Guru, who have not made Him their Guru, are useless in this world. ||4||8||<BR>
 Dwell upon the Guru, the Guru, the Guru, O my mind.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 016</H2></CENTER>
 The All-powerful Guru is the Boat to carry us across in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. Hearing the Word of His Shabad, we are transported into Samaadhi.<BR>
 He is the Spiritual Hero who destroys pain and brings peace. Whoever meditates on Him, dwells near Him.<BR>
 He is the Perfect Primal Being, who meditates in remembrance on the Lord within his heart; seeing His Face, sins run away.<BR>
 If you long for wisdom, wealth, spiritual perfection and properity, O my mind, dwell upon the Guru, the Guru, the Guru. ||5||9||<BR>
 Gazing upon the Face of the Guru, I find peace.<BR>
 I was thirsty, yearning to drink in the Nectar; to fulfill that wish, the Guru laid out the way.<BR>
 My mind has become perfect; it dwells in the Lord's Place; it had been wandering in all directions, in its desire for tastes and pleasures.<BR>
 Goindwal is the City of God, built on the bank of the Beas River.<BR>
 The pains of so many years have been taken away; gazing upon the Face of the Guru, I find peace. ||6||10||<BR>
 The All-powerful Guru placed His hand upon my head.<BR>
 The Guru was kind, and blessed me with the Lord's Name. Gazing upon His Feet, my sins were dispelled.<BR>
 Night and day, the Guru meditates on the One Lord; hearing His Name, the Messenger of Death is scared away.<BR>
 So speaks the Lord's slave: Guru Raam Daas placed His Faith in Guru Amar Daas, the Guru of the World; touching the Philosopher's Stone, He was transformed into the Philosopher's Stone.<BR>
 Guru Raam Daas recognized the Lord as True; the All-powerful Guru placed His hand upon His head. ||7||11||<BR>
 Now, please preserve the honor of Your humble slave.<BR>
 God saved the honor of the devotee Prahlaad, when Harnaakhash tore him apart with his claws.<BR>
 And the Dear Lord God saved the honor of Dropadi; when her clothes were stripped from her, she was blessed with even more.<BR>
 Sudaamaa was saved from misfortune; and Ganikaa the prostitute - when she chanted Your Name, her affairs were perfectly resolved.<BR>
 O Great True Guru, if it pleases You, please save the honor of Your slave in this Dark Age of kali Yuga. ||8||12||<BR>
 JHOLNAA:<BR>
 Chant Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, O mortal beings.<BR>
 Chant the Shabad, the Word of the Lord, Har, Har; the Naam, the Name of the Lord, brings the nine treasures. With your tongue, taste it, day and night, and know it as true.<BR>
 Then, you shall obtain His Love and Affection; become Gurmukh, and meditate on Him. Give up all other ways; vibrate and meditate on Him, O spiritual people.<BR>
 Enshrine the Word of the Guru's Teachings within your heart, and overpower the five passions. Your life, and your generations, shall be saved, and you shall be honored at the Lord's Door.<BR>

 The Guru is an Ocean, deep and profound, infinite and unfathomable. Lovingly attuned to the Lord's Name, you shall be blessed with jewels, diamonds and emeralds.<BR>
 And, the Guru makes us fragrant and fruitful, and His Touch transforms us into gold. The filth of evil-mindedness is washed away, meditating on the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 The Stream of Ambrosial Nectar flows constantly from His Door. The Saints and Sikhs bathe in the immaculate pool of the Guru's spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 Enshrine the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within your heart, and dwell in Nirvaanaa. Chant Guru, Guru, Guru; through the Guru, the Lord is obtained. ||3||15||<BR>
 Chant Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, O my mind.<BR>
 Serving Him, Shiva and the Siddhas, the angels and demons and servants of the gods, and the thrity-three million gods cross over, listening to the Word of the Guru's Teachings.<BR>
 And, the Saints and loving devotees are carried across, chanting Guru, Guru. Prahlaad and the silent sages met the Guru, and were carried across.<BR>
 Naarad and Sanak and those men of God who became Gurmukh were carried across; attached to the One Name, they abandoned other tastes and pleasures, and were carried across.<BR>
 This is the prayer of the Lord's humble slave: the Gurmukh obtains the Naam, the Name of the Lord, chanting Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, O my mind. ||4||16||29||<BR>
 The Great, Supreme Guru showered His Mercy upon all;<BR>

 The Guru is the Boat, and the Guru is the Boatman. Without the Guru, no one can cross over.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, God is obtained. Without the Guru, no one is liberated.<BR>
 Guru Nanak dwells near the Creator Lord.<BR>
 He established Lehnaa as Guru, and enshrined His Light in the world.<BR>
 Lehnaa established the path of righteousness and Dharma,<BR>
 which He passed on to Guru Amar Daas, of the Bhalla dynasty.<BR>
 Then, He firmly established the Great Raam Daas of the Sodhi dynasty.<BR>
 He was blessed with the inexhaustible treasure of the Lord's Name.<BR>
 He was blessed with the treasure of the Lord's Name; throughout the four ages, it is inexhaustible. Serving the Guru, He received His reward.<BR>
 Those who bow at His Feet and seek His Sanctuary, are blessed with peace; those Gurmukhs are blessed with supreme bliss.<BR>

 For His Sake, the Yogis, celibates, Siddhas and seekers, the countless sects of fanatics with matted hair wear religious robes, wandering as detached renunciates.<BR>

 Nanak, the True Guru, worships God single-mindedly; He surrenders His body, mind and wealth to the Lord of the Universe.<BR>

 Guru Amar Daas brought the Creator Lord under His control. Waaho! Waaho! Meditate on Him!<BR>

 Naarad, Dhroo, Prahlaad and Sudaamaa are accounted among the Lord's devotees of the past.<BR>
 Ambreek, Jai Dayv, Trilochan, Naam Dayv and Kabeer are also remembered.<BR>
 They were incarnated in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga; their praises have spread over all the world.<BR>
 O Great and Supreme Guru Raam Daas, Your Victory resounds across the universe. You have attained the supreme status of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Those who meditate in remembrance on You within their minds - their sexual desire and anger are taken away.<BR>
 Those who remember You in meditation with their words, are rid of their poverty and pain in an instant.<BR>
 Those who obtain the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, by the karma of their good deeds, touch the Philosopher's Stone, and like BALL the poet, sing Your Praises.<BR>

 Living the Word of the Shabad, He attained the supreme status; while performing selfless service, He did not leave the side of Guru Amar Daas.<BR>
 From that service, the light from the jewel of spiritual wisdom shines forth, radiant and bright; it has destroyed pain, poverty and darkness.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 022</H2></CENTER>
 So speaks KEERAT the poet: those who grasp hold of the feet of the Saints, are not afraid of death, sexual desire or anger.<BR>
 Just as Guru Nanak was part and parcel, life and limb with Guru Angad, so is Guru Amar Daas one with Guru Raam Daas. ||1||<BR>
 Whoever serves the True Guru obtains the treasure; night and day, he dwells at the Lord's Feet.<BR>
 And so, the entire Sangat loves, fears and respects You. You are the sandalwood tree; Your fragrance spreads gloriously far and wide.<BR>
 Dhroo, Prahlaad, Kabeer and Trilochan chanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and His Illumination radiantly shines forth.<BR>
 Seeing Him, the mind is totally delighted; Guru Raam Daas is the Helper and Support of the Saints. ||2||<BR>
 Guru Nanak realized the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord. He was lovingly attuned to loving devotional worship of the Lord.<BR>
 Gur Angad was with Him, life and limb, like the ocean; He showered His consciousness with the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 The Unspoken Speech of Guru Amar Daas cannot be expressed with only one tongue.<BR>
 Guru Raam Daas of the Sodhi dynasty has now been blessed with Glorious Greatness, to carry the whole world across. ||3||<BR>
 I am overflowing with sins and demerits; I have no merits or virtues at all. I abandoned the Ambrosial Nectar, and I drank poison instead.<BR>
 I am attached to Maya, and deluded by doubt; I have fallen in love with my children and spouse.<BR>
 I have heard that the most exalted Path of all is the Sangat, the Guru's Congregation. Joining it, the fear of death is taken away.<BR>
 KEERAT the poet offers this one prayer: O Guru Raam Daas, save me! Take me into Your Sanctuary! ||4||58||<BR>
 He has crushed and overpowered emotional attachment. He seized sexual desire by the hair, and threw it down.<BR>
 With His Power, He cut anger into pieces, and sent greed away in disgrace.<BR>
 Life and death, with palms pressed together, respect and obey the Hukam of His Command.<BR>
 He brought the terrifying world-ocean under His Control; by His Pleasure, He carried His Sikhs across.<BR>
 He is seated upon the Throne of Truth, with the canopy above His Head; He is embellished with the powers of Yoga and the enjoyment of pleasures.<BR>
 So speaks SALL the poet: O Guru Raam Daas, Your sovereign power is eternal and unbreakable; Your army is invincible. ||1||<BR>
 You are the True Guru, throughout the four ages; You Yourself are the Transcendent Lord.<BR>
 The angelic beings, seekers, Siddhas and Sikhs have served You, since the very beginning of time.<BR>
 You are the Primal Lord God, from the very beginning, and throughout the ages; Your Power supports the three worlds.<BR>
 You are Inaccessible; You are the Saving Grace of the Vedas. You have conquered old age and death.<BR>
 Guru Amar Daas has permanently established You; You are the Emancipator, to carry all across to the other side.<BR>
 So speaks SALL the poet: O Guru Raam Daas, You are the Destroyer of sins; I seek Your Sanctuary. ||2||60||<BR>

 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Meditate in remembrance on the Primal Lord God, Eternal and Imperishable.<BR>
 Remembering Him in meditation, the filth of evil-mindedness is eradicated.<BR>
 I enshrine the Lotus Feet of the True Guru within my heart.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 023</H2></CENTER>
 With intuitive peace and poise, I contemplate the Glorious Virtues of Guru Arjun.<BR>
 He was revealed in the House of Guru Raam Daas,<BR>
 and all hopes and desires were fulfilled.<BR>
 From birth, He realized God through the Guru's Teachings.<BR>
 With palms pressed together, KALL the poet speaks His praises.<BR>
 The Lord brought Him into the world, to practice the Yoga of devotional worship.<BR>
 The Word of the Guru's Shabad has been revealed, and the Lord dwells on His tongue.<BR>
 Attached to Guru Nanak, Guru Angad and Guru Amar Daas, He attained the supreme status.<BR>
 In the House of Guru Raam Daas, the devotee of the Lord, Guru Arjun was born. ||1||<BR>

 The Inaccessible and Unfathomable, Supreme Lord God is revealed through the True Guru.<BR>

 Guru Nanak laid the foundation of Truth; He is blended with the True Guru.<BR>
 In the House of Guru Raam Daas, Guru Arjun has appeared as the Embodiment of the Infinite Lord. ||3||<BR>
 The Sovereign Lord King has staged this wondrous play; contentment was gathered together, and pure understanding was infused in the True Guru.<BR>
 KALL the poet utters the Praises of the Unborn, Self-existent Lord.<BR>
 Guru Nanak blessed Guru Angad, and Guru Angad blessed Guru Amar Daas with the treasure.<BR>
 Guru Raam Daas blessed Guru Arjun, who touched the Philosopher's Stone, and was certified. ||4||<BR>
 O Guru Arjun, You are Eternal, Invaluable, Unborn, Self-existent,<BR>
 the Destroyer of fear, the Dispeller of pain, Infinite and Fearless.<BR>
 You have grasped the Ungraspable, and burnt away doubt and skepticism. You bestow cooling and soothing peace.<BR>
 The Self-existent, Perfect Primal Lord God Creator has taken birth.<BR>
 First, Guru Nanak, then Guru Angad and Guru Amar Daas, the True Guru, have been absorbed into the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 Blessed, blessed is Guru Raam Daas, the Philosopher's Stone, who transformed Guru Arjun unto Himself. ||5||<BR>
 His victory is proclaimed all over the world; His Home is blessed with good fortune; He remains united with the Lord.<BR>
 By great good fortune, He has found the Perfect Guru; He remains lovingly attuned to Him, and endures the load of the earth.<BR>
 He is the Destroyer of fear, the Eradicator of the pains of others. KALL SAHAAR the poet utters Your Praise, O Guru.<BR>
 In the Sodhi family, is born Arjun, the son of Guru Raam Daas, the holder of the banner of Dharma and the devotee of God. ||6||<BR>
 The Support of the Dharma, immersed in the deep and profound Teachings of the Guru, the Remover of the pains of others.<BR>
 The Shabad is excellent and sublime, kind and generous like the Lord, the Destroyer of egotism.<BR>
 The Great Giver, the spiritual wisdom of the True Guru, His mind does not grow weary of its yearning for the Lord.<BR>
 The Embodiment of Truth, the Mantra of the Lord's Name, the nine treasures are never exhausted.<BR>
 O Son of Guru Raam Daas, You are contained amidst all; the canopy of intuitive wisdom is spread above You.<BR>
 So speaks KALL the poet: O Guru Arjun, You know the sublime essence of Raja Yoga, the Yoga of meditation and success. ||7||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 024</H2></CENTER>
 In the Fear of God, You enjoy the Fearless Lord; among the thousands of beings, You see the Unseen Lord.<BR>

 Meeting with the Guru, You are certified and approved; You practice Yoga in the midst of wealth and power.<BR>

 Attached to the Lord's Name, the world is saved; enshrine the True Guru within your heart.<BR>
 So speaks KALL: O Guru Arjun, You have illliminated the highest pinnacle of wisdom. ||9||<BR>
 SORAT'H<BR>
 : Guru Arjun is the certified Primal Person; like Arjuna, He never leaves the field of battle.<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is His spear and insignia. He is embellished with the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru. ||1||<BR>
 The Lord's Name is the Boat, the Bridge to cross over the terrifying world-ocean.<BR>
 You are in love with the True Guru; attached to the Naam, You have saved the world. ||2||<BR>
 The Naam is the Saving Grace of the world; by the Pleasure of the True Guru, it is obtained.<BR>
 Now, I am not concerned with anything else; at Your Door, I am fulfilled. ||3||12||<BR>
 The Embodiment of Light, the Lord Himself is called Guru Nanak.<BR>
 From Him, came Guru Angad; His essence was absorbed into the essence.<BR>
 Guru Angad showed His Mercy, and established Amar Daas as the True Guru.<BR>
 Guru Amar Daas blessed Guru Raam Daas with the umbrella of immortality.<BR>
 So speaks MAT'HURAA: gazing upon the Blessed Vision, the Darshan of Guru Raam Daas, His speech became as sweet as nectar.<BR>
 With your eyes, see the certified Primal Person, Guru Arjun, the Fifth Manifestation of the Guru. ||1||<BR>
 He is the Embodiment of Truth; He has enshrined the True Name, Sat Naam, Truth and contentment within His heart.<BR>
 From the very beginning, the Primal Being has written this destiny upon His forehead.<BR>
 His Divine Light shines forth, dazzling and radiant; His Glorious Grandeur pervades the realms of the world.<BR>
 Meeting the Guru, touching the Philosopher's Stone, He was acclaimed as Guru.<BR>
 So speaks MAT'HURAA: I constantly focus my consciousness on Him; as sunmukh, I look to Him.<BR>
 In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, Guru Arjun is the Boat; attached to him, the entire universe is safely carried across. ||2||<BR>
 I beg from that humble being who is known all over the world, who lives in, and loves the Name, night and day.<BR>
 He is supremely unattached, and imbued with the Love of the Transcendent Lord; he is free of desire, but he lives as a family man.<BR>
 He is dedicated to the Love of the Infinite, Limitless Primal Lord God; he has no concerns for any other pleasure, except for the Lord God.<BR>
 Guru Arjun is the All-pervading Lord God of MAT'HURAA. Devoted to His Worship, he remains attached to the Lord's Feet. ||3||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 025</H2></CENTER>
 All the gods, silent sages, Indra, Shiva and Yogis have not found the Lord's limits<BR>
 - not even Brahma who contemplates the Vedas. I shall not give up meditating on the Lord, even for an instant.<BR>
 The God of MAT'HURAA is Merciful to the meek; He blesses and uplifts the Sangats throughout the Universe.<BR>
 Guru Raam Daas, to save the world, enshrined the Guru's Light into Guru Arjun. ||4||<BR>
 In the great darkness of this world, the Lord revealed Himself, incarnated as Guru Arjun.<BR>
 Millions of pains are taken away, from those who drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, says MAT'HURAA.<BR>
 O mortal being, do not leave this path; do not think that there is any difference between God and Guru.<BR>
 The Perfect Lord God has manifested Himself; He dwells in the heart of Guru Arjun. ||5||<BR>
 As long as the destiny written upon my forehead was not activated, I wandered around lost, running in all directions.<BR>
 I was drowning in the horrible world-ocean of this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, and my remorse would never have ended.<BR>
 O MAT'HURAA, consider this essential truth: to save the world, the Lord incarnated Himself.<BR>
 Whoever meditates on Guru Arjun Dayv, shall not have to pass through the painful womb of reincarnation ever again. ||6||<BR>
 In the ocean of this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Lord's Name has been revealed in the Form of Guru Arjun, to save the world.<BR>
 Pain and poverty are taken away from that person, within whose heart the Saint abides.<BR>
 He is the Pure, Immaculate Form of the Infinite Lord; except for Him, there is no other at all.<BR>
 Whoever knows Him in thought, word and deed, becomes just like Him.<BR>
 He is totally pervading the earth, the sky and the nine regions of the planet. He is the Embodiment of the Light of God.<BR>
 So speaks MAT'HURAA: there is no difference between God and Guru; Guru Arjun is the Personification of the Lord Himself. ||7||19||<BR>
 The stream of the Lord's Name flows like the Ganges, invincible and unstoppable. The Sikhs of the Sangat all bathe in it.<BR>
 It appears as if the holy texts like the Puraanaas are being recited there and Brahma himself sings the Vedas.<BR>
 The invincible chauri, the fly-brush, waves over His head; with His mouth, He drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam.<BR>
 The Transcendent Lord Himself has placed the royal canopy over the head of Guru Arjun.<BR>
 Guru Nanak, Guru Angad, Guru Amar Daas and Guru Raam Daas met together before the Lord.<BR>
 So speaks HARBANS: Their Praises echo and resound all over the world; who can possibly say that the Great Gurus are dead? ||1||<BR>
 When it was the Will of the Transcendent Lord Himself, Guru Raam Daas went to the City of God.<BR>
 The Lord offered Him His Royal Throne, and seated the Guru upon it.<BR>
 The angels and gods were delighted; they proclaimed and celebrated Your victory, O Guru.<BR>
 The demons ran away; their sins made them shake and tremble inside.<BR>
 Those people who found Guru Raam Daas were rid of their sins.<BR>
 He gave the Royal Canopy and Throne to Guru Arjun, and came home. ||2||21||9||11||10||10||22||60||143||<BR>
