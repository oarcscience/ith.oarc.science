<CENTER><H2>Section 45 - Mundaavanee, Fifth Mehl & Raag Maalaa - Part 001</H2></CENTER>
 I had looked upon the world as my own, but no one belongs to anyone else.<BR>
 O Nanak, only devotional worship of the Lord is permanent; enshrine this in your mind. ||48||<BR>
 The world and its affairs are totally false; know this well, my friend.<BR>
 Says Nanak, it is like a wall of sand; it shall not endure. ||49||<BR>
 Raam Chand passed away, as did Raawan, even though he had lots of relatives.<BR>
 Says Nanak, nothing lasts forever; the world is like a dream. ||50||<BR>
 People become anxious, when something unexpected happens.<BR>
 This is the way of the world, O Nanak; nothing is stable or permanent. ||51||<BR>
 Whatever has been created shall be destroyed; everyone shall perish, today or tomorrow.<BR>
 O Nanak, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and give up all other entanglements. ||52||<BR>
 DOHRAA:<BR>
 My strength is exhausted, and I am in bondage; I cannot do anything at all.<BR>
 Says Nanak, now, the Lord is my Support; He will help me, as He did the elephant. ||53||<BR>
 My strength has been restored, and my bonds have been broken; now, I can do everything.<BR>
 Nanak: everything is in Your hands, Lord; You are my Helper and Support. ||54||<BR>
 My associates and companions have all deserted me; no one remains with me.<BR>
 Says Nanak, in this tragedy, the Lord alone is my Support. ||55||<BR>
 The Naam remains; the Holy Saints remain; the Guru, the Lord of the Universe, remains.<BR>
 Says Nanak, how rare are those who chant the Guru's Mantra in this world. ||56||<BR>
 I have enshrined the Lord's Name within my heart; there is nothing equal to it.<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on it, my troubles are taken away; I have received the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||57||1||<BR>
 Mundaavanee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Upon this Plate, three things have been placed: Truth, Contentment and Contemplation.<BR>
 The Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of our Lord and Master, has been placed upon it as well; it is the Support of all.<BR>
 One who eats it and enjoys it shall be saved.<BR>
 This thing can never be forsaken; keep this always and forever in your mind.<BR>
 The dark world-ocean is crossed over, by grasping the Feet of the Lord; O Nanak, it is all the extension of God. ||1||<BR>
 Shalok, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I have not appreciated what You have done for me, Lord; only You can make me worthy.<BR>
 I am unworthy - I have no worth or virtues at all. You have taken pity on me.<BR>
 You took pity on me, and blessed me with Your Mercy, and I have met the True Guru, my Friend.<BR>
 O Nanak, if I am blessed with the Naam, I live, and my body and mind blossom forth. ||1||<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Raag Maalaa:<BR>
 Each Raga has five wives,<BR>
 and eight sons, who emit distinctive notes.<BR>
 In the first place is Raag Bhairao.<BR>
