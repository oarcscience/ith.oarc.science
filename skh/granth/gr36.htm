<CENTER><H2>Section 36 - Shalok Sehskritee, First Mehl & Fifth Mehl - Part 001</H2></CENTER>
 You believed that this body was permanent, but it shall turn to dust.<BR>
 Why don't you chant the Name of the Lord, you shameless fool? ||1||<BR>
 Let devotional worship of the Lord enter into your heart, and abandon the intellectualism of your mind.<BR>
 O Servant Nanak, this is the way to live in the world. ||2||4||<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<BR>
 Shalok Sehskritee, First Mehl:<BR>
 You study the scriptures, say your prayers and argue;<BR>
 you worship stones and sit like a crane, pretending to meditate.<BR>
 You speak lies and well-ornamented falsehood,<BR>
 and recite your daily prayers three times a day.<BR>
 The mala is around your neck, and the sacred tilak mark is on your forehead.<BR>
 You wear two loin cloths, and keep your head covered.<BR>
 If you know God and the nature of karma,<BR>
 you know that all these rituals and beliefs are useless.<BR>
 Says Nanak, meditate on the Lord with faith.<BR>
 Without the True Guru, no one finds the Way. ||1||<BR>
 The mortal's life is fruitless, as long as he does not know God.<BR>
 Only a few, by Guru's Grace, cross over the world-ocean.<BR>
 The Creator, the Cause of causes, is All-powerful. Thus speaks Nanak, after deep deliberation.<BR>
 The Creation is under the control of the Creator. By His Power, He sustains and supports it. ||2||<BR>
 The Shabad is Yoga, the Shabad is spiritual wisdom; the Shabad is the Vedas for the Brahmin.<BR>
 The Shabad is heroic bravery for the Khshaatriya; the Shabad is service to others for the Soodra.<BR>
 The Shabad for all is the Shabad, the Word of the One God, for one who knows this secret.<BR>
 Nanak is the slave of the Divine, Immaculate Lord. ||3||<BR>
 The One Lord is the Divinity of all divinities. He is the Divinity of the soul.<BR>
 Nanak is the slave of that one who knows the Secrets of the soul and the Supreme Lord God. He is the Divine Immaculate Lord Himself. ||4||<BR>
 Shalok Sehskritee , Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<BR>
 Who is the mother, and who is the father? Who is the son, and what is the pleasure of marriage?<BR>
 Who is the brother, friend, companion and relative? Who is emotionally attached to the family?<BR>
 Who is restlessly attached to beauty? It leaves, as soon as we see it.<BR>
 Only the meditative remembrance of God remains with us. O Nanak, it brings the blessings of the Saints, the sons of the Imperishable Lord. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 36 - Shalok Sehskritee, First Mehl & Fifth Mehl - Part 002</H2></CENTER>
 Cursed is loving attachment to one's mother and father; cursed is loving attachment to one's siblings and relatives.<BR>
 Cursed is attachment to the joys of family life with one's spouse and children.<BR>
 Cursed is attachment to household affairs.<BR>
 Only loving attachment to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is True. Nanak dwells there in peace. ||2||<BR>
 The body is false; its power is temporary.<BR>
 It grows old; its love for Maya increases greatly.<BR>
 The human is only a temporary guest in the home of the body, but he has high hopes.<BR>
 The Righteous Judge of Dharma is relentless; he counts each and every breath.<BR>
 The human body, so difficult to obtain, has fallen into the deep dark pit of emotional attachment. O Nanak, its only support is God, the Essence of Reality.<BR>
 O God, Lord of the World, Lord of the Universe, Master of the Universe, please be kind to me. ||3||<BR>
 This fragile body-fortress is made up of water, plastered with blood and wrapped in skin.<BR>
 It has nine gates, but no doors; it is supported by pillars of wind, the channels of the breath.<BR>
 The ignorant person does not meditate in remembrance on the Lord of the Universe; he thinks that this body is permanent.<BR>
 This precious body is saved and redeemed in the Sanctuary of the Holy, O Nanak,<BR>
 chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har, Har, Haray. ||4||<BR>
 O Glorious, Eternal and Imperishable, Perfect and Abundantly Compassionate,<BR>
 Profound and Unfathomable, Lofty and Exalted, All-knowing and Infinite Lord God.<BR>
 O Lover of Your devoted servants, Your Feet are a Sanctuary of Peace.<BR>
 O Master of the masterless, Helper of the helpless, Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary. ||5||<BR>
 Seeing the deer, the hunter aims his weapons.<BR>
 But if one is protected by the Lord of the World, O Nanak, not a hair on his head will be touched. ||6||<BR>
 He may be surrounded on all four sides by servants and powerful warriors;<BR>
 he may dwell in a lofty place, difficult to approach, and never even think of death.<BR>
 But when the Order comes from the Primal Lord God, O Nanak, even an ant can take away his breath of life. ||7||<BR>
 To be imbued and attuned to the Word of the Shabad; to be kind and compassionate; to sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises - these are the most worthwhile actions in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.<BR>
 In this way, one's inner doubts and emotional attachments are dispelled.<BR>
 God is pervading and permeating all places.<BR>
 So obtain the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; He dwells upon the tongues of the Holy.<BR>
 O Nanak, meditate and chant the Name of the Beloved Lord, Har, Har, Har, Haray. ||8||<BR>
 Beauty fades away, islands fade away, the sun, moon, stars and sky fade away.<BR>
 The earth, mountains, forests and lands fade away.<BR>
 One's spouse, children, siblings and loved friends fade away.<BR>
 Gold and jewels and the incomparable beauty of Maya fade away.<BR>
 Only the Eternal, Unchanging Lord does not fade away.<BR>
 O Nanak, only the humble Saints are steady and stable forever. ||9||<BR>
 Do not delay in practicing righteousness; delay in committing sins.<BR>
 Implant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within yourself, and abandon greed.<BR>
 In the Sanctuary of the Saints, the sins are erased. The character of righteousness is received by that person,<BR>
 O Nanak, with whom the Lord is pleased and satisfied. ||10||<BR>
 The person of shallow understanding is dying in emotional attachment; he is engrossed in pursuits of pleasure with his wife.<BR>
 With youthful beauty and golden earrings,<BR>
 wondrous mansions, decorations and clothes - this is how Maya clings to him.<BR>
 O Eternal, Unchanging, Benevolent Lord God, O Sanctuary of the Saints, Nanak humbly bows to You. ||11||<BR>
 If there is birth, then there is death. If there is pleasure, then there is pain. If there is enjoyment, then there is disease.<BR>
 If there is high, then there is low. If there is small, then there is great.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 36 - Shalok Sehskritee, First Mehl & Fifth Mehl - Part 003</H2></CENTER>
 If there is power, then there is pride. If there is egotistical pride, then there will be a fall.<BR>
 Engrossed in worldly ways, one is ruined.<BR>
 Meditating and vibrating on the Lord of the Universe in the Company of the Holy, you shall become steady and stable. Nanak vibrates and meditates on the Lord God. ||12||<BR>
 By the Grace of God, genuine understanding comes to the mind.<BR>
 The intellect blossoms forth, and one finds a place in the realm of celestial bliss.<BR>
 The senses are brought under control, and pride is abandoned.<BR>
 The heart is cooled and soothed, and the wisdom of the Saints is implanted within.<BR>
 Reincarnation is ended, and the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan is obtained.<BR>
 O Nanak, the musical instrument of the Word of the Shabad vibrates and resounds within. ||13||<BR>
 The Vedas preach and recount God's Glories; people hear them by various ways and means.<BR>
 The Merciful Lord, Har, Har, implants spiritual wisdom within.<BR>
 Nanak begs for the Gift of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The Guru is the Great Giver, the Lord of the World. ||14||<BR>
 Do not worry so much about your mother, father and siblings. Do not worry so much about other people.<BR>
 Do not worry about your spouse, children and friends. You are obsessed with your involvements in Maya.<BR>
 The One Lord God is Kind and Compassionate, O Nanak. He is the Cherisher and Nurturer of all living beings. ||15||<BR>
 Wealth is temporary; conscious existence is temporary; hopes of all sorts are temporary.<BR>
 The bonds of love, attachment, egotism, doubt, Maya and the pollution of corruption are temporary.<BR>
 The mortal passes through the fire of the womb of reincarnation countless times. He does not remember the Lord in meditation; his understanding is polluted.<BR>
 O Lord of the Universe, when You grant Your Grace, even sinners are saved. Nanak dwells in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||16||<BR>
 You may drop down from the mountains, and fall into the nether regions of the underworld, or be burnt in the blazing fire,<BR>
 or swept away by the unfathomable waves of water; but the worst pain of all is household anxiety, which is the source of the cycle of death and rebirth.<BR>
 No matter what you do, you cannot break its bonds, O Nanak. Man's only Support, Anchor and Mainstay is the Word of the Shabad, and the Holy, Friendly Saints. ||17||<BR>
 Excruciating pain, countless killings, reincarnation, poverty and terrible misery<BR>
 are all destroyed by meditating in remembrance on the Lord's Name, O Nanak, just as fire reduces piles of wood to ashes. ||18||<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, the darkness is illuminated. Dwelling on His Glorious Praises, the ugly sins are destroyed.<BR>
 Enshrining the Lord deep within the heart, and with the immaculate karma of doing good deeds, one strikes fear into the demons.<BR>
 The cycle of coming and going in reincarnation is ended, absolute peace is obtained, and the Fruitful Vision of the Lord's Darshan.<BR>
 He is Potent to give Protection, He is the Lover of His Saints. O Nanak, the Lord God blesses all with bliss. ||19||<BR>
 Those who were left behind - the Lord brings them to the front. He fulfills the hopes of the hopeless.<BR>
 He makes the poor rich, and cures the illnesses of the ill.<BR>
 He blesses His devotees with devotion. They sing the Kirtan of the Praises of the Lord's Name.<BR>
 O Nanak, those who serve the Guru find the Supreme Lord God, the Great Giver||20||<BR>
 He gives Support to the unsupported. The Name of the Lord is the Wealth of the poor.<BR>
 The Lord of the Universe is the Master of the masterless; the Beautiful-haired Lord is the Power of the weak.<BR>
 The Lord is Merciful to all beings, Eternal and Unchanging, the Family of the meek and humble.<BR>
 The All-knowing, Perfect, Primal Lord God is the Lover of His devotees, the Embodiment of Mercy.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 36 - Shalok Sehskritee, First Mehl & Fifth Mehl - Part 004</H2></CENTER>
 The Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent, Luminous Lord, dwells in each and every heart.<BR>
 Nanak begs for this blessing from the Merciful Lord, that he may never forget Him, never forget Him. ||21||<BR>
 I have no power; I do not serve You, and I do not love You, O Supreme Sublime Lord God.<BR>
 By Your Grace, Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Merciful Lord, Har, Har. ||22||<BR>
 The Lord feeds and sustains all living beings; He blesses them gifts of restful peace and fine clothes.<BR>
 He created the jewel of human life, with all its cleverness and intelligence.<BR>
 By His Grace, mortals abide in peace and bliss.<BR>
 O Nanak, meditating in remembrance on the Lord, Har, Har, Haray,<BR>
 the mortal is released from attachment to the world. ||23||<BR>
 The kings of the earth are eating up the blessings of the good karma of their past lives.<BR>
 Those cruel-minded rulers who oppress the people, O Nanak, shall suffer in pain for a very long time. ||24||<BR>
 Those who meditate in remembrance on the Lord in their hearts, look upon even pain as God's Grace.<BR>
 The healthy person is very sick, if he does not remember the Lord, the Embodiment of Mercy. ||25||<BR>
 To sing the Kirtan of God's Praises is the righteous duty incurred by taking birth in this human body.<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is Ambrosial Nectar, O Nanak. The Saints drink it in, and never have enough of it. ||26||<BR>
 The Saints are tolerant and good-natured; friends and enemies are the same to them.<BR>
 O Nanak, it is all the same to them, whether someone offers them all sorts of foods, or slanders them, or draws weapons to kill them. ||27||<BR>
 They pay no attention to dishonor or disrespect.<BR>
 They are not bothered by gossip; the miseries of the world do not touch them.<BR>
 Those who join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and chant the Name of the Lord of the Universe - O Nanak, those mortals abide in peace. ||28||<BR>
 The Holy people are an invincible army of spiritual warriors; their bodies are protected by the armor of humility.<BR>
 Their weapons are the Glorious Praises of the Lord which they chant; their Shelter and Shield is the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 The horses, chariots and elephants they ride are their way to realize God's Path.<BR>
 They walk fearlessly through the armies of their enemies; they attack them with the Kirtan of God's Praises.<BR>
 They conquer the entire world, O Nanak, and overpower the five thieves. ||29||<BR>
 Misled by evil-mindedness, mortals are engrossed in the mirage of the illusory world, like the passing shade of a tree.<BR>
 Emotional attachment to family is false, so Nanak meditates in remembrance on the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam. ||30||<BR>
 I do not possess the treasure of the wisdom of the Vedas, nor do I possess the merits of the Praises of the Naam.<BR>
 I do not have a beautiful voice to sing jewelled melodies; I am not clever, wise or shrewd.<BR>
 By destiny and hard work, the wealth of Maya is obtained. O Nanak, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, even fools become religious scholars. ||31||<BR>
 The mala around my neck is the chanting of the Lord's Name. The Love of the Lord is my silent chanting.<BR>
 Chanting this most Sublime Word brings salvation and joy to the eyes. ||32||<BR>
 That mortal who lacks the Guru's Mantra - cursed and contaminated is his life.<BR>
 That blockhead is just a dog, a pig, a jackass, a crow, a snake. ||33||<BR>
 Whoever contemplates the Lord's Lotus Feet, and enshrines His Name within the heart,<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 36 - Shalok Sehskritee, First Mehl & Fifth Mehl - Part 005</H2></CENTER>
 and sings the Kirtan of His Praises in the Saadh Sangat, O Nanak, shall never see the Messenger of Death. ||34||<BR>
 Wealth and beauty are not so difficult to obtain. Paradise and royal power are not so difficult to obtain.<BR>
 Foods and delicacies are not so difficult to obtain. Elegant clothes are not so difficuilt to obtain.<BR>
 Children, friends, siblings and relatives are not so difficult to obtain. The pleasures of woman are not so difficult to obtain.<BR>
 Knowledge and wisdom are not so difficult to obtain. Cleverness and trickery are not so difficult to obtain.<BR>
 Only the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is difficult to obtain. O Nanak, it is only obtained by God's Grace, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||35||<BR>
 Wherever I look, I see the Lord, whether in this world, in paradise, or the nether regions of the underworld.<BR>
 The Lord of the Universe is All-pervading everywhere. O Nanak, no blame or stain sticks to Him. ||36||<BR>
 Poison is transformed into nectar, and enemies into friends and companions.<BR>
 Pain is changed into pleasure, and the fearful become fearless.<BR>
 Those who have no home or place find their place of rest in the Naam, O Nanak, when the Guru, the Lord, becomes Merciful. ||37||<BR>
 He blesses all with humility; He has blessed me with humility as well. He purifies all, and He has purified me as well.<BR>
 The Creator of all is the Creator of me as well. O Nanak, no blame or stain sticks to Him. ||38||<BR>
 The moon-god is not cool and calm, nor is the white sandalwood tree.<BR>
 The winter season is not cool; O Nanak, only the Holy friends, the Saints, are cool and calm. ||39||<BR>
 Through the Mantra of the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, one meditates on the All-pervading Lord.<BR>
 Those who have the wisdom to look alike upon pleasure and pain, live the immaculate lifestyle, free of vengeance.<BR>
 They are kind to all beings; they have overpowered the five thieves.<BR>
 They take the Kirtan of the Lord's Praise as their food; they remain untouched by Maya, like the lotus in the water.<BR>
 They share the Teachings with friend and enemy alike; they love the devotional worship of God.<BR>
 They do not listen to slander; renouncing self-conceit, they become the dust of all.<BR>
 Whoever has these six qualities, O Nanak, is called a Holy friend. ||40||<BR>
 The goat enjoys eating fruits and roots, but if it lives near a tiger, it is always anxious.<BR>
 This is the condition of the world, O Nanak; it is afflicted by pleasure and pain. ||41||<BR>
 Fraud, false accusations, millions of diseases, sins and the filthy residues of evil mistakes;<BR>
 doubt, emotional attachment, pride, dishonor and intoxication with Maya<BR>
 - these lead mortals to death and rebirth, wandering lost in hell. In spite of all sorts of efforts, salvation is not found.<BR>
 Chanting and meditating on the Name of the Lord in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, mortals become immaculate and pure.<BR>
 They continually dwell upon the Glorious Praises of God. ||42||<BR>
 In the Sanctuary of the Kind-hearted Lord, our Transcendent Lord and Master, we are carried across.<BR>
 God is the Perfect, All-powerful Cause of causes; He is the Giver of gifts.<BR>
 He gives hope to the hopeless. He is the Source of all riches.<BR>
 Nanak meditates in remembrance on the Treasure of Virtue; we are all beggars, begging at His Door. ||43||<BR>
 The most difficult place becomes easy, and the worst pain turns into pleasure.<BR>
 Evil words, differences and doubts are obliterated, and even faithless cynics and malicious gossips become good people.<BR>
 They become steady and stable, whether happy or sad; their fears are taken away, and they are fearless.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 36 - Shalok Sehskritee, First Mehl & Fifth Mehl - Part 006</H2></CENTER>
 The dreadful woods become a well-populated city; such are the merits of the righteous life of Dharma, given by God's Grace.<BR>
 Chanting the Lord's Name in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, the Lotus Feet of the Merciful Lord are found. ||44||<BR>
 O emotional attachment, you are the invincible warrior of the battlefield of life; you totally crush and destroy even the most powerful.<BR>
 You entice and fascinate even the heavenly heralds, celestial singers, gods, mortals, beasts and birds.<BR>
 Nanak bows in humble surrender to the Lord; he seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord of the Universe. ||45||<BR>
 O sexual desire, you lead the mortals to hell; you make them wander in reincarnation through countless species.<BR>
 You cheat the consciousness, and pervade the three worlds. You destroy meditation, penance and virtue.<BR>
 But you give only shallow pleasure, while you make the mortals weak and unsteady; you pervade the high and the low.<BR>
 Your fear is dispelled in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, through the Protection and Support of the Lord. ||46||<BR>
 O anger, you are the root of conflict; compassion never rises up in you.<BR>
 You take the corrupt, sinful beings in your power, and make them dance like monkeys.<BR>
 Associating with you, mortals are debased and punished by the Messenger of Death in so many ways.<BR>
 O Destroyer of the pains of the poor, O Merciful God, Nanak prays for You to protect all begins from such anger. ||47||<BR>
 O greed, you cling to even the great, assaulting them with countless waves.<BR>
 You cause them to run around wildly in all directions, wobbling and wavering unsteadily.<BR>
 You have no respect for friends, ideals, relations, mother or father.<BR>
 You make them do what they should not do. You make them eat what they should not eat. You make them accomplish what they should not accomplish.<BR>
 Save me, save me - I have come to Your Sanctuary, O my Lord and Master; Nanak prays to the Lord. ||48||<BR>
 O egotism, you are the root of birth and death and the cycle of reincarnation; you are the very soul of sin.<BR>
 You forsake friends, and hold tight to enemies. You spread out countless illusions of Maya.<BR>
 You cause the living beings to come and go until they are exhausted. You lead them to experience pain and pleasure.<BR>
 You lead them to wander lost in the terrible wilderness of doubt; you lead them to contract the most horrible, incurable diseases.<BR>
 The only Physician is the Supreme Lord, the Transcendent Lord God. Nanak worships and adores the Lord, Har, Har, Haray. ||49||<BR>
 O Lord of the Universe, Master of the Breath of life, Treasure of Mercy, Guru of the World.<BR>
 O Destroyer of the fever of the world, Embodiment of Compassion, please take away all my pain.<BR>
 O Merciful Lord, Potent to give Sanctuary, Master of the meek and humble, please be kind to me.<BR>
 Whether his body is healthy or sick, let Nanak meditate in remembrance on You, Lord. ||50||<BR>
 I have come to the Sanctuary of the Lord's Lotus Feet, where I sing the Kirtan of His Praises.<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, Nanak is carried across the utterly terrifying, difficult world-ocean. ||51||<BR>
 The Supreme Lord God has procted my head and forehead; the Transcendent Lord has protected my hands and body.<BR>
 God, my Lord and Master, has saved my soul; the Lord of the Universe has saved my wealth and feet.<BR>
 The Merciful Guru has protected everything, and destroyed my fear and suffering.<BR>
 God is the Lover of His devotees, the Master of the masterless. Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Imperishable Primal Lord God. ||52||<BR>
 His Power supports the sky, and locks fire within wood.<BR>
 His Power supports the moon, the sun and the stars, and infuses light and breath into the body.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 36 - Shalok Sehskritee, First Mehl & Fifth Mehl - Part 007</H2></CENTER>
 His Power provides nourishment in the womb of the mother, and does not let disease strike.<BR>
 His Power holds back the ocean, O Nanak, and does not allow the waves of water to destroy the land. ||53||<BR>
 The Lord of the World is Supremely Beautiful; His Meditation is the Life of all.<BR>
 In the Society of the Saints, O Nanak, He is found on the path of devotional worship of the Lord. ||54||<BR>
 The mosquito pierces the stone, the ant crosses the swamp,<BR>
 the cripple crosses the ocean, and the blind sees in the darkness,<BR>
 meditating on the Lord of the Universe in the Saadh Sangat. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord, Har, Har, Haray. ||55||<BR>
 Like a Brahmin without a sacred mark on his forehead, or a king without the power of command,<BR>
 or a warrior without weapons, so is the devotee of God without Dharmic Faith. ||56||<BR>
 God has no conch-shell, no religious mark, no paraphernalia; he does not have blue skin.<BR>
 His Form is Wondrous and Amazing. He is beyond incarnation.<BR>
 The Vedas say that He is not this, and not that.<BR>
 The Lord of the Universe is Lofty and High, Great and Infinite.<BR>
 The Imperishable Lord abides in the hearts of the Holy. He is understood, O Nanak, by those who are very fortunate. ||57||<BR>
 Living in the world, it is like a wild jungle. One's relatives are like dogs, jackals and donkeys.<BR>
 In this difficult place, the mind is intoxicated with the wine of emotional attachment; the five unconquered thieves lurk there.<BR>
 The mortals wander lost in love and emotional attachment, fear and doubt; they are caught in the sharp, strong noose of egotism.<BR>
 The ocean of fire is terrifying and impassable. The distant shore is so far away; it cannot be reached.<BR>
 Vibrate and meditate on the Lord of the World, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; O Nanak, by His Grace, we are saved at the Lotus Feet of the Lord. ||58||<BR>
 When the Lord of the Universe grants His Grace, all illnesses are cured.<BR>
 Nanak chants His Glorious Praises in the Saadh Sangat, in the Sanctuary of the Perfect Transcendent Lord God. ||59||<BR>
 The mortal is beautiful and speaks sweet words, but in the farm of his heart, he harbors cruel vengeance.<BR>
 He pretends to bow in worship, but he is false. Beware of him, O friendly Saints. ||60||<BR>
 The thoughtless fool does not know that each day, his breaths are being used up.<BR>
 His most beautiful body is wearing away; old age, the daughter of death, has seized it.<BR>
 He is engrossed in family play; placing his hopes in transitory things, he indulges in corrupt pleasures.<BR>
 Wandering lost in countless incarnations, he is exhausted. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Embodiment of Mercy. ||61||<BR>
 O tongue, you love to enjoy the sweet delicacies.<BR>
 You are dead to the Truth, and involved in great disputes. Instead, repeat the holy words:<BR>
 Gobind, Daamodar, Maadhav. ||62||<BR>
 Those who are proud, and intoxicated with the pleasures of sex,<BR>
 and asserting their power over others,<BR>
 never contemplate the Lord's Lotus Feet. Their lives are cursed, and as worthless as straw.<BR>
 You are as tiny and insignificant as an ant, but you shall become great, by the Wealth of the Lord's Meditation.<BR>
 Nanak bows in humble worship, countless times, over and over again. ||63||<BR>
 The blade of grass becomes a mountain, and the barren land becomes green.<BR>
 The drowning one swims across, and the empty is filled to overflowing.<BR>
 Millions of suns illuminate the darkness,<BR>
 prays Nanak, when the Guru, the Lord, becomes Merciful. ||64||<BR>
