<p><a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="green">p. 63</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">CHAPTER IV</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center">HYMNS FROM THE GRANTH S&#256;HIB, AND FROM THE GRANTH OF THE TENTH GURU</h3>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> Granth S&#257;hib contains the hymns of the first five Gurus, of the ninth Guru, and a couplet of Gobind Singh; also hymns from certain Indian religious reformers previous to the Sikhs. There were originally three editions of the Granth S&#257;hib. The first was compiled by Guru Arjan, the second by Bh&#257;i Banno, and the third under the auspices of the tenth Guru, who added the hymns of Teg Bah&#257;dur and a couplet of his own. This is the usually accepted form. The hymns are not arranged according to authors, but by the thirty-two "r&#257;gs," or musical measures to which they are composed. The name N&#257;nak is used as a <i>nom-de-guerre</i> by the eight succeeding Gurus, who, however, are distinguished from one another by numbers. The Granth S&#257;hib is compared to a vast building, and the compositions of the Gurus to various wards. Thus, Guru N&#257;nak's hymns are known as Ward I, Guru Angad's as Ward II, and so forth.</p>  
<p><a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="green">p. 64</font></A></p>  
<p>The quotations given here include, firstly, selections from the hymns used as special services by the Sikhs, followed by miscellaneous examples from the Gurus, and the saints and reformers who preceded them.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">From the J&#257;pji</span></p>  
<p>The J&#257;pji is considered by the Sikhs to be an epitome of the doctrines contained in the Granth S&#257;hib. It is silently repeated by them early in the morning. Every Sikh must know it by heart, otherwise he is not deemed orthodox. It is the duty of all, even if they cannot read, to have themselves taught this great morning divine service. The composition appears to have been the work of Guru N&#257;nak in advanced age. The greater part is here given.</p>  
<p>There is but one God whose name is true, the Creator, [the Powerful,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>] devoid of fear and enmity, immortal, unborn, self-existent; by the favour of the Guru.</p>  
<p align="center">Repeat His name</p>  
<p>The True One was in the beginning; the True One was in the primal age.</p>  
<p>

<p>The True One is now also, O N&#257;nak;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the True One also shall be.</p>  
<p align="center">I</p>  
<p>By thinking I cannot obtain a conception <i>of Him</i>, even though I think hundreds of thousands of times.</p>  
<p>Even though I be silent and keep my attention firmly fixed on Him, I cannot preserve silence.</p>  
<p>The hunger of the hungry <i>for God</i> subsideth not, though they obtain the load of the worlds.</p>  
<p>If man should have thousands and hundreds of thousands of devices, even one would not assist him in obtaining God.</p>  
<p>How shall <i>man</i> become true before God? How shall the veil of falsehood be rent?</p>  
<p>By walking, O N&#257;nak, according to the will of the Commander as preordained.</p>  
<p align="center">II</p>  
<p>By His orders bodies are produced; His order cannot be described.</p>  
<p>By His order souls are infused into them; by His order greatness is obtained.</p>

<p>By His order some obtain their reward; by</p>

<p>All are subject to His order; none is exempt from it.</p>  
<p>He who understandeth God's order, O N&#257;nak, is never guilty of egotism.</p>  
<p align="center">III</p>  
<p>Who can sing His power? Who hath power to <i>sing it</i>?</p>  
<p>Who can sing His gifts or know His signs?</p>  
<p>Who can sing His attributes, His greatness, and His deeds?</p>  
<p>Who can sing His knowledge, whose study is arduous?</p>  
<p>Who can sing Hine, who fashioneth the body and <i>again</i> destroyeth it?</p>  
<p>Who can sing Him, who taketh away life and again restoreth it?</p>  
<p>Who can sing Him, who appeareth to be far, <i>but</i> is known <i>to be near</i>?</p>  
<p>Who can sing Him, who is <i>all</i>-seeing and omnipresent?</p>  
<p>In describing Him there would never be an end.</p>  
<p>Millions of men give millions upon millions of descriptions of Him, <i>but they fail to describe Him</i>.</p>  
<p>The Giver giveth; the receiver groweth weary of receiving.</p>  
<p>In every age man subsisteth by His bounty.</p>  
<p><a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="green">p. 67</font></A></p>  
<p>The Commander by His order hath laid out the way <i>of the world</i>.</p>  
<p>N&#257;nak, God the unconcerned is happy.</p>

<p>He is not established, nor is He created.</p>  
<p>The pure one existeth by Himself,</p>  
<p>They who worshipped Him have obtained honour.</p>  
<p>N&#257;nak, sing His <i>praises</i> who is the Treasury of excellences.</p>  
<p>Sing and hear and put His love into your hearts.</p>  
<p><i>Thus</i> shall your sorrows be removed, and you shall be absorbed in Him who is the abode of happiness.</p>  
<p>Under the Guru's instruction <i>God's</i> word <i>is heard</i>; under the Guru's instruction its knowledge <i>is acquired</i>; under the Guru's instruction <i>man learns that God</i> is everywhere contained.</p>

<p>If I knew Him, should I not describe Him? He cannot be described by words,</p>  
<p>My Guru hath explained one thing to me&#8212;</p>  
<p>That there is <i>but</i> one Bestower on all living beings; may I not forget Him!</p>  
<p align="center">VI</p>  
<p>If I please Him, that is my place of pilgrimage to bathe in; if I please Him not, what ablutions shall I make?</p>  
<p>What can all the created beings I behold obtain without <i>previous</i> good acts?</p>  
<p>Precious stones, jewels, and gems <i>shall be treasured up</i> in thy heart if thou hearken to even one word of the Guru.</p>  
<p>The Guru hath explained one thing to me. That there is <i>but</i> one Bestower on all living beings; may I not forget Him!</p>

<p>Were he to obtain a great name and praise and renown in the world;</p>  
<p>If God's look of favour fell not on him, no one would notice him.</p>  
<p>He would be accounted a worm among worms, and even sinners would impute sin to him.</p>  
<p>N&#257;nak, God may bestow virtue on those who are devoid of it, as well as on those who already possess it;</p>  
<p>But no such person is seen as can bestow virtue upon Him.</p>

<p>We insects and worms seek Thy protection, O true Guru; mercifully enlighten us with the Name;</p>  
<p>My friend and divine Guru, enlighten me with God's name.</p>  
<p>Under the Guru's instruction, the Name is the helper of my soul; singing God's praises is my occupation.</p>  
<p>Exceedingly fortunate are the men of God who have faith in Him and thirst for Him:</p>  
<p>On obtaining the name of God, they are satisfied; when men meet the company of the saints, God's attributes are known.</p>  
<p>They who obtain not the relish of God's name are unfortunate, and shall go to the god of death.</p>

<p>O my God, they who meet the society of the saints are saved.</p>  
<p>Through the favour of the Guru they obtain the highest rank; though they be as dry wood, they are made green.</p>  
<p>No one can rely on mother, father, friends, children, or wives.</p>  
<p>God provideth every one with his daily food; why, O man, art thou afraid?</p>  
<p>The <i>kulang</i> flieth away hundreds of miles, leaving her young behind her.</p>

<p>The Guru of gurus is but one, though He hath various forms.</p>

<p align="center"><i>Guru N&#257;nak</i></p>  
<p>The sun and moon, <i>O Lord</i>, are Thy lamps; the firmament Thy salver; the orbs of the stars the pearls <i>enchased</i> in it.</p>  
<p>The perfume of the sandal is Thine incense, the wind is Thy fan, all the forests are Thy flowers, O Lord of light.</p>  
<p>What worship is this, O Thou Destroyer of birth? Unbeaten strains of ecstasy are the trumpets of Thy worship.</p>  
<p>Thou hast a thousand eyes and yet not one eye; Thou hast a thousand forms and yet not one form;</p>  
<p>Thou hast a thousand stainless feet and yet not one foot; Thou hast a thousand organs of smell and yet not one organ. I am fascinated by this play of Thine.</p>  
<p>The light which is in everything is Thine, O Lord of light.</p>  
<p>From its brilliancy everything is brilliant;</p>  
<p><a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="green">p. 88</font></A></p>  
<p>By the Guru's teaching the light becometh manifest.</p>

<p>Salute the saint with clasped hands&#8212;this is a greatly meritorious act.</p>  
<p>Prostrate thyself before him&#8212;this is a greatly religious act.</p>  
<p>The infidel knoweth not the taste of God's essence; he beareth the thorn of pride in his heart.</p>  
<p>The more he moveth, the more it pricketh him, and the more pain he feeleth: his head shall feel death's mace.</p>  
<p>The saints of God are absorbed in God's name, and have destroyed the pain and fear of transmigration.</p>

<p>I was perverse and low, but my evil understanding which hath caused me pain of mind and body hath left me.</p>  
<p>Since I began to love the joyous God, my mind hath been consoled by repeating His name.</p>  
<p>Having forgotten pride, I have abandoned the world, and true wisdom hath entered my heart.</p>  
<p>Since I have become reconciled with Him who is without enmity or stain, I have lost all regard for men's opinion.</p>  
<p>O my Beloved, Support of my soul, there has been none like Thee in the past, and there shall be none like Thee in the future.</p>

<p>The sixth, seventh, and eighth Gurus left no hymns, but relied on the Granth S&#257;hib for the means of conveying their instructions. Teg Bah&#257;dur, the ninth Guru, however, left a large number of sacred writings, which were incorporated into the Granth S&#257;hib by his son Gobind Singh. The following is typical of his rather melancholy manner:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Adore God, adore God; thy life passeth away.</p>  
<p>Why should I warn thee every moment? why understandest thou not, O fool? The body is like hail, it vanisheth in a moment.</p>  
<p>Reject all doubt and repeat God's name; at the last moment this alone will depart with thee.</p>  
<p>Forsake sensual pleasures as poison; take the praise of God to thy heart; N&#257;nak proclaimeth, the opportunity is passing away.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Associate with holy men, remember God, and thou shalt be cleansed from sin.</p>  
<p>Death wandereth about, O friend, like a serpent with protruding fangs.</p>  
<p>And it will seize thee sooner or later; understand this in thy heart,</p>  
<p>Saith N&#257;nak, worship God; thine opportunity is passing away.</p>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Guru Gobind Singh</span></p>  
<p>This couplet is the only composition of the tenth Guru found in the Granth S&#257;hib, and was sent by Gobind Singh to his father just before the martyrdom of the latter:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Strength is thine; thy fetters are loosed; thou hast every resource.</p>  
<p>N&#257;nak, everything is in thy power; it is only thou who canst assist thyself.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>There are in the Granth S&#257;hib a large number of hymns by saints and hermits who preceded N&#257;nak. Guru Arjan, when editing the volume, did not hesitate to include such works, showing how Sikhism had borrowed from previous thinkers, principally, perhaps, from Kab&#299;r. Among the authors who are represented there are at least two Muhammadan saints, Farid and Bhikan, and very many of the others, though nominally Hindu, were influenced by Muhammadanism. Kab&#299;r,</p>  
<p><a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="green">p. 98</font></A></p>  
<p>who was brought up by Muhammadans, contributes a large number of hymns; Ram&#257;nand, a disciple of R&#257;m&#257;nuj and Guru to Kab&#299;r, contributes a hymn; and one version of the Granth, preserved at Mangat, contains a hymn composed by Mir&#257; B&#257;i, Queen of Chitaur. Guru Arjan did not originally include this work, owing to the fact that in his opinion the lady did not wholly escape from the influence of idolatry.</p>  
<p>From the fifteen saints whose hymns are found in the Granth, the following extracts from Kab&#299;r and Shaikh Farid are chosen. Mira B&#257;i's hymn is also included.</p>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Kab&#299;r</span></p>  
<p>Long not for a dwelling in heaven, and fear not to dwell in hell;</p>  
<p>What will be, will be; O my soul, hope not at all.</p>  
<p>Sing the praises of God from whom the supreme reward is obtained.</p>  
<p>What is devotion, what penance and austerities, what fasting and ablutions,</p>  
<p>Unless thou know the way to love and serve God?</p>  
<p>Be not glad at the sight of prosperity and grieve not at the sight of adversity;</p>  
<p>As is prosperity so is adversity; what God proposeth shall be accomplished,</p>  
<p><a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="green">p. 99</font></A></p>  
<p>Saith Kab&#299;r, through the saints I now know in my heart</p>  
<p>That the worshipper in whose heart God dwelleth, <i>performeth</i> the best worship.</p>  
<p align="center">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>  
<p>I was in immobile and mobile creatures, in worms and in moths;</p>  
<p>I passed through many births of various kinds.</p>  
<p>In this way I occupied many bodies,</p>  
<p>But when, O God, I assumed <i>human</i> birth,</p>  
<p>I was a Jogi, a Jati, a penitent, a Brahmachari,</p>  
<p>Sometimes a king, an emperor, and sometimes a beggar.</p>  
<p>The apostates shall die, but the saints shall all live,</p>  
<p>And drink the elixir of God with their tongues.</p>  
<p>Saith Kab&#299;r, O God, have mercy on us;</p>  
<p>We have grown weary; make us now whole!</p>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Shaikh Farid</span></p>  
<p>Humility is the word, forbearance the virtue, virility the priceless spell;</p>  
<p>Make these three thy dress, O sister, and the Spouse shall come into thy power.</p>  
<p>There are few saints,</p>  
<p>Who, though wise, are simple,</p>  
<p>Though strong, are weak,</p>  
<p><a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="green">p. 100</font></A></p>  
<p>And, though having not, divide what they have.</p>  
<p>Utter not one disagreeable word, since the true Lord is in all men.</p>  
<p>Distress no one's heart; every heart is a priceless jewel.</p>  
<p>All men's hearts are jewels; to distress them is by no means good;</p>  
<p>If thou desire the Beloved, distress no one's heart.</p>

<p>God hath entwined my soul, O mother,</p>

<p>The sharp arrow of His love hath pierced my body through and through, O mother.</p>  
<p>When it struck me I knew it not; now it cannot be endured, O mother.</p>  
<p>Though I use charms, incantations, and drugs; the pain will not depart.</p>  
<p>Is there any one who will treat me? Intense is the agony, O mother.</p>  
<p>Thou, O God, art near; Thou art not distant; come quickly to meet me.</p>  
<p>Saith Mir&#257;, the Lord, the mountain-wielder, who is compassionate, hath quenched the fire of my body, O mother.</p>

<p align="center">FROM THE GRANTH OF THE TENTH GURU</p>  
<p>After the death of Gobind Singh&#8212;the tenth Guru&#8212;a new Granth was compiled in his honour, which is known as the <i>Granth of the Tenth Guru</i>, in order to distinguish it from the Granth of Guru Arjan&#8212;the <i>Adi</i>, or First Granth. This volume contains Gobind Singh's <i>J&#257;pji</i>, the <i>Akal Ustat</i>, or Praise of the Creator, hymns in praise of the sword, and an interesting and elaborate account of the Guru's own history and that of his predecessors, which is called the <i>Wonderful Drama</i>.</p>

<p>The tenth Guru spoke with his holy mouth&#8212;</p>  
<p>God hath no quoit or marks, no colour, no caste, no lineage,</p>  
<p>No form, no complexion, no outline, no costume; none can in any way describe Him.</p>  
<p>He is immovable, fearless, luminous, and measureless in might;</p>  
<p>He is accounted King of kings, Lord of millions of Indars.</p>  
<p>He is Sovereign of the three worlds, demigods,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="green">p. 102</font></A></p>  
<p>men, and demons; the woods and dales declare Him indescribable.</p>  
<p>O Lord, who can tell all Thy names? the wise call Thee <i>special</i> names according to Thy deeds.</p>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">From the Akal Ustat</span></p>

<p>May we have the protection of All-steel!</p>  
<p>May we have the protection of All-death!</p>  
<p>May we have the protection of All-steel!</p>  
<p>(Ten Sawaiyas, or quatrains, which occur in the Akal Ustat are recited at the Pahul, or baptism of the tenth Guru. The following are extracts: )</p>  
<p>Trained soldiers, powerful, irresistible, well accoutred with coats of mail crush their enemies;</p>  
<p>Filled with high martial spirit they would put mountains to flight, themselves unshaken;</p>  
<p>They would shatter their enemies, destroy rebels, crush the pride of furious elephants;</p>  
<p>Yet without the favour of God, the Lord of wealth, they should all depart at last and leave the world.</p>  
<p>Even the demons, gods, serpents, and ghosts who repeat God's name in the past, future, and present;</p>  
<p><a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="green">p. 103</font></A></p>  
<p>All the beings which in sea and land every moment set up God in their hearts,</p>  
<p>Shall find their good deeds and glory increase; they shall hear the voices of gratulation and the multitude of their sins shall depart.</p>  
<p>The congregations of saints wander happy in the world; all their enemies on beholding them are cowed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Thou art in the tree, Thou art in its leaves,</p>

<p>(The following hymn is one of those recited while the baptismal water is being prepared;)</p>  
<p>O man, practise asceticism in this way:</p>  
<p>Consider thy house altogether as the forest, and remain an anchoret at heart.</p>  
<p>Make continence thy matted hair, union with God thine ablutions, thy daily religious duties the growth of thy nails,</p>  
<p>Divine knowledge thy spiritual guide; admonish thy heart and apply God's name as ashes to thy body.</p>  
<p>Eat little, sleep little, love mercy and forbearance.</p>  
<p>Ever practise mildness and patience, and thou shalt be freed from the three qualities.</p>  
<p>Attach not to thy heart lust, wrath, covetousness, obstinacy, and worldly love.</p>  
<p>Thus shalt thou behold the Real Soul of this world, and obtain the Supreme Being.</p>

<p>Thine arm is infrangible, Thy brightness refulgent, Thy radiance and splendour dazzle like the sun.</p>

<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">From the Wonderful Drama</span></p>  
<p>He (N&#257;nak) established religion in the Kal age,</p>  
<p>And showed the way unto all holy men. &#8230;</p>  
<p>[The narrative continues:]</p>  
<p>N&#257;nak assumed the body of Angad,</p>  
<p>And made his religion current in the world.</p>  
<p>Afterwards <i>N&#257;nak</i> was called Amar D&#257;s,</p>  
<p>As one lamp is lit from another.</p>  
<p>When the time for the fulfilment of the blessing came,</p>  
<p>Then R&#257;m D&#257;s became Guru.</p>  
<p>Amar D&#257;s gave him the Guruship according to the ancient blessing,</p>  
<p>And took the road to paradise himself.</p>  
<p>The holy N&#257;nak was revered as Angad,</p>  
<p>Angad was recognised as Amar D&#257;s,</p>  
<p>And Amar D&#257;s became R&#257;m D&#257;s.</p>  
<p>The pious saw this, but not the fools,</p>  
<p>Who thought them all distinct;</p>  
<p>But some rare person recognised that they were all one.</p>  
<p>They who understood this obtained perfection&#8212;</p>  
<p>Without understanding perfection cannot be obtained.</p>  
<p>When R&#257;m D&#257;s was blended with God,</p>  
<p>He gave the Guruship to Arjan.</p>  
<p>When Arjan was going to God's city</p>  
<p>He appointed Har Gobind in his place.</p>  
<p>When Har Gobind was going to God's city,</p>  
<p><a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="green">p. 110</font></A></p>  
<p>He seated Har R&#257;i in his place.</p>  
<p>Har Krishan, his son, afterwards became Guru.</p>  
<p>After him came Teg Bah&#257;dur,</p>  
<p>Who protected the frontal marks and sacrificial threads <i>of the Hindus</i>,</p>  
<p>And displayed great bravery in the Kal age.</p>  
<p>When he put an end to his life for the sake of holy men,</p>  
<p>He gave his head but uttered not a groan.</p>  
<p>He suffered martyrdom for the sake of his religion;</p>  
<p>He gave his head but swerved not from his determination.</p>  
<p>I shall now tell my own history,</p>  
<p>How God brought me into the world as I was performing penance</p>  
<p>On the mountain of Hem Kunt,</p>  
<p>There I performed very great austerities</p>  
<p>And worshipped Great-death.</p>  
<p>I performed such penance</p>  
<p>That I became blended with God.</p>  
<p>When God gave me the order,</p>  
<p>I assumed birth in this Kal age.</p>  
<p>I did not desire to come,</p>  
<p>As my attention was fixed on God's feet.</p>  
<p>God remonstrated earnestly with me,</p>  
<p>And sent me into this world with the following orders &#8230;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>[God then tells the Guru how He had created the demi-gods and the various prophets, but how</p>  
<p><a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="green">p. 111</font></A></p>  
<p>they had all been false to their religion, and had attracted glory to themselves.]</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>"None of them recognized Me, the Supreme Being.</p>  
<p>I have cherished thee as My son,</p>  
<p>And created thee to extend My religion.</p>  
<p>Go and spread My religion there,</p>  
<p>And restrain the world from senseless acts."</p>  
<p>I stood up, clasped my hands, bowed my head, and replied:</p>  
<p>"Thy religion shall prevail in the world when Thou vouchsafest assistance."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>On this account God sent me.</p>  
<p>Then I took birth and came into the world.</p>  
<p>As He spoke to me so I speak unto men:</p>  
<p>I bear no enmity to any one.</p>  
<p>All who call me the Supreme Being</p>  
<p>Shall fall into the pit of hell.</p>  
<p>Recognise me as God's servant only</p>  
<p>Have no doubt whatever of this.</p>  
<p>I and the slave of the Supreme Being,</p>  
<p>And have come to behold the wonders of the world.</p>  
<p>I tell the world what God told. me,</p>  
<p>And will not remain silent through fear of mortals.</p>  
<p>[The Guru then continues his teaching and finally utters this prayer:]</p>  
<p><a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="green">p. 112</font></A></p>  
<p>Great-death, be Thou my protector;</p>  
<p>All-steel, I am Thy slave,</p>  
<p>Deeming me Thine own, preserve me;</p>  
<p>Think of mine honour, whose arm Thou hast taken.</p>  
<p>Preserve me and let none trample on me;</p>  
<p>Be Thou ever my cherisher!</p>  
<p>Thou art the Lord, I am Thy slave.</p>  
<p>Deeming me Thine own, be gracious unto me;</p>  
<p>Perform everything for me Thyself;</p>  
<p>Thou art the King of kings;</p>  
<p>It is Thou alone who cherisheth the poor;</p>  
<p>I have arrived and am lying weary at Thy door.</p>  
<p>Thou art my Lord, I am Thy slave.</p>  
<p>Deeming me Thy slave, reach me Thy hand and save me</p>  
<p>Destroy all mine enemies.</p>

Show us such favour that we may by word and deed be Thine, and that in all things we may obtain Thine assistance and support.</p>  
<p>Grant to Thy Sikhs the gift of Sikhism, the gift of the Guru's instruction, the gift of faith, the gift of confidence in Thee, and the gift of reading and understanding the holy Granth S&#257;hib.</p>  
<p>May the Sikh choirs, mansions, and banners ever abide! Victory to the faith! May the minds of the Sikhs be humble but their intellects exalted! Utter W&#257;hguru! W&#257;hguru!! W&#257;hguru!!!</p>  
<p>We offer this Ardas in Thy presence and at Thy lotus feet. Pardon our errors and mistakes. May all Sikhs who read and hear the Gurus&#8217; hymns be profited!</p>  
<p>Through N&#257;nak, may Thy name, O God, be exalted,</p>  
<p>And all prosper by Thy grace!</p>  
<p>Sri W&#257;hguru ji ka Khalsa! Sri W&#257;hguru ji ki Fatah!</p>
