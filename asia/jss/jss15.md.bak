### CHAPTER XI

### MYTHS CONNECTED WITH MONGOL RELIGION

#### GESIR BOGDO. No. I

##### (TOLD BY SCKRETARYOFF)

AT first—in the beginning of the world—there was confusion here below,
and great disorder. There were also various vile creatures, especially
Mangathais. Then a council was held in the sky at which Qurmus Tengeri,
one of the forty-four Eastern gods, said, "A middle son can pacify and
set aside all this evil."

Esege Malan had nine sons. He called the middle one, whose son, Gesir
Bogdo, said: "If I get what I need I will go to the earth and destroy
the evil creatures there. But the ninety-nine Tengeris must give me all
their tricks."

The Tengeris delivered their tricks, one hundred thousand in number, and
Gesir Bogdo swallowed them. Then, turning to Esege Malan, he said:

"Now it is thy turn. Give me thy black steed and a hero's outfit." Esege
gave the black steed and the outfit. "Give me thy lasso and thy dart."
Esege gave the lasso and dart. Then Gesir asked for a wife and got her.
He said to his wife, "Thou hast three daughters, give those three
daughters to me." At first the woman refused. "It is bad down there,"
said she, "they cannot stay there. I will not give them."

"If I cannot get all that I need I shall not go," declared Gesir Bogdo.

Then Esege Malan commanded Otqon Tengeri to soothsay and find out what
to do, to give or not to give. Otqon obeyed and said: "They will be of
use to Gesir Bogdo. It is necessary to give them."

The mother gave her three daughters, and Gesir Bogdo swallowed them, as
he had swallowed all that Esege Malan gave him. Then he took farewell,
but he did not come down to earth at once; he traveled around in heaven
for three years, looking down always. And during those three years he
saw all the evil-doers everywhere,—all the bad spirits and vile
creatures. Then he said, "I cannot go down as I am, I must be born in
that country." He saw a woman sixty years of age; her name was Tumún
Yarigûl, and her husband's name was Sindlei U!gu!gun. And he said, "I
wish to enter that woman's head."

That year Sindlei U!gu!gun was very prosperous, his herds increased, and
his grass grew wonderfully well. One day Tumún said: "I feel that I am
to be the mother of many. I hear children talking."

Many children were soon born to her, each in a different way, but all
flew to the sky. At last one was born who said, "As I am born all people
will be born hereafter." And so it has been. This infant was thin, and
very ugly to look at; but it changed quickly and at once grew to a man's
stature. This man, who was Gesir Bogdo, cleaned away all vile things,
destroyed evil spirits and bad people. Lusugúi Mangathai was the last
evil spirit he killed, and when Gesir Bogdo had him by the legs he
scratched the earth with his fingers and ten streams gushed out. They
form the river Aqa, which falls into the Angara on the left side. Then
Gesir said:

"Now I will lie down and sleep. Let no one waken me. I will sleep till
again there will be many harmful things, evil spirits, and bad people in
the world; then I will waken and destroy them."

Gesir Bogdo had three sons and six grandsons before he came down from
the sky. Of each of his nine descendants there were in the old time nine
tales, in all eighty-one. They had to be told in groups of nine, and the
relator could neither eat, drink, nor sleep while telling them, and when
each group of nine was told an unseen person said, "Thou hast forgotten
where thou placed thy Pfu!"

Gesir Bogdo was born in Qonyin Qotoí. He sleeps at the

great taigà (a marshy forest of Siberia). When, to rest easy, he turns
from one side to the other, the earth trembles. The Russians call this
trembling an "earthquake," but the Buriats know that it is Gesir Bogdo
turning over.
