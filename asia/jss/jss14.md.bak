#### CHAPTER X

#### THE GODS OF THE BURIATS

DELQUEN Sagán Burkan, World White God, is the highest existence in the
Universe. He is also called Esege Malan. In him are three spirits:
Baronyé Tabin Tabung Tengeri, Zúm Dishín Dirlún Tengeri, and Sagadé
U!gu!gun.

From the first spirit came the fifty-five Tengeris, from the second the
forty-four Tengeris; the third has seven sons and seven daughters. Of
the seven sons the eldest is Golói Qûn Shara Qúbun. The eldest daughter
is Golói Qûn Shara Basagán.

Prayers are offered and sacrifices made to all the Heavenly Burkans as
well as to the Highest Existence. People ask the World White Burkan for
cattle, for grass, and for health. They ask the three other spirits,
especially Sagadé U!gu!gun, far rain, good crops, and children.

When they ask the gods for children they offer Sagadé U!gu!gun twenty
pots of tarasun; they pray in the yurta, tie a hair rope around the four
posts, and hang wooden rattles (playthings) on them. These playthings
are to persuade the child to come. They bring from the forest and place
in the middle of the yurta a tall birch tree, the top of which comes out
through the smoke hole. At the roots of the tree they put three sods of
earth taken from a swamp. Up this birch tree prayers are supposed to go
to the Heavenly Burkans. After the offering and prayers a cradle is
made, and all its belongings prepared for the coming of the new child.

No pictures are ever made of the Highest Being, or of the first and
second spirit. Pictures are made of the third spirit, Sagadé U!gu!gun,
of his wife, Sanqali\`n Qatĕ\`n, of their eldest son, Golói Qûn Shara
Qúbun, and of their eldest daughter, Goloi Qûn Shara Basagán.

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

To the fifty-five Tengeris a sacrifice should be made three times in his
life by every man who has the means. These sacrifices are as follows:
the first sacrifice is fifty-five pots of tarasun, and five beasts,—one
virgin mare, three virgin ewes, and one goat; the second sacrifice,
fifty-five pots of tarasun, one virgin mare, five virgin ewes, and one
goat; the third, fifty-five pots of tarasun, one virgin mare, seven
virgin ewes, and one goat.

To Qoqodai Mĕgûn Qubi\`n, the eldest of the fifty-five Tengeris,
sacrifices are made frequently; the other fifty-four are simply
mentioned with him.

Qoqodai Mĕgûn Qubi\`n has nine sons and nine daughters. His eldest son
is Qurĕndé Buqú Qubûn; the second, Qugén Mergĭn; the third, Qorsa!gái
Mergĭn, the fourth, Boroldái Buqú. The eighteen sons and daughters have
eighteen gray steeds. On these gray steeds they race and gallop over the
sky, and make the awful thunder which we hear.

Of the forty-four Tengeris who are from Zúni Dishi\`n, the second spirit
of Delquen Sagan Burkan, the Highest Existence, seven are very
important. These are Gutár Bai\`n Tengeri, the eldest; Qap Sagán
Tengeri; Togóto Bain Tengeri; Qásan Burún Qui Tengeri; Galta Ulan
Tengeri; Qûng Germa Tengeri; Qair Qur Tengeri.

To the third spirit, Sagadé U!gu!gun, his wife, Sanqali\`n Qatĕ\`n, and
their eldest son and eldest daughter, the sacrifice of a "fat, harmless
ram" is made, and prayers are offered with libations of tarasun.

Buriats worship a heavenly spirit, a son of Bulage Iji\`n, one of the
fifty-five Tengeris. His name is Búir Sagán U!gu!gun. To this spirit and
his wife, Qwir Sagán Qamagan, they make an offering of twenty-seven pots
of tarasun, and two, or sometimes three, virgin ewes.

To the forty-four Tengeris offerings are made of tarasun, and thirty
skins of various small animals,—three rabbit skins, five skunk skins,
three ermine skins, seven squirrel skins, six small kid skins, and the
skins of six small he-goats.

Irlik Namun Qûn, a descendant of the forty-four Tengeris, had three
sons, Uqûr Qara Bisheshi, Selmendé Saga Bisheshi, and Shandá Bukqû
Bisheshi; each of these sons came to earth,

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

and each has his dwelling-place in a mountain of the Buriat country.

At springs Buriats worship a heavenly power, a son of one of the
fifty-five Tengeris, Bulage Iji\`n, Buir Sagán U!gu!gun, and his wife,
Qwir Sagan Hamagan. They make sacrifices at such springs,—twenty-seven
pots of tarasun, two virgin ewes, and sometimes three.

### HOUSE ONGONS

*First*. The wheel, with an image inside representing Tumúr Shi\`n
Qulain Seji\`n Bará, who was a holy Shaman of ancient times. People boil
meat for him and in important cases sacrifice a goat. At marriage the
bridegroom sacrifices a he-goat to this divinity, and a small pot of
meal pudding as well as eight pots of tarasun, asking for health,
happiness, prosperity, and children. The wheel is made of birch; from
the bottom hangs a bunch of hair taken from under the belly of a
he-goat. The figure is metallic and represents the sacred Shaman
himself. The garment he wears is of red cloth, and is supposed to be a
shuba or mantle. Two coral beads answer for eyes.

*Second*. On a square piece of black felt are represented the third
spirit of the World White God, Sagadé U!gu!gun, his wife, Sanqali\`n
Qatĕ\`n, and their eldest son and eldest daughter, as well as a tiny
infant which represents the infant that people ask for in their prayers.
In the pockets below the little tin pieces which portray these spirits
meat is placed as an offering.

*Third*. A long piece of felt containing three virgin sisters (little
tin figures on blue cloth), Munqugshin Basagán, Munqoden Basagán, and
Boryúntēn Basagán. When these are consecrated the ceremony is performed
by a Shaman. Three virgin ewes are offered, thirty pots of tarasun, and
one big pot of meal pudding. Through these sisters the people ask of the
World White God, or Esege Malan, land, cattle, and all that is necessary
for prosperity.

### OUTSIDE ONGONS

In the first bag is the skin of an ermine. The skin is so dried and
shrivelled as to be unrecognizable, and two little tin images

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

represent Ugin Xubun and his wife. They were Shamans. People turn to
them as to gods, begging for anything they wish for,—good crops, rain,
etc.

In the second bag are two figures representing Qulebo and his wife. Both
were Shamans. They are petitioned to intercede in all affairs pertaining
to cattle-raising, buying and selling, etc.

In the largest gray bag are seven figures on two pieces of cloth; on one
piece are five, on the other two. These represent Yûn Yiqé Qóta and his
wife, Qazagar, and their two sons and one daughter. On the second piece
of cloth are the son-in-law and one daughter-in-law. These have about
the same attributes as those in the other bags, and are petitioned for
similar things.

The long skin is that of a skunk, and represents the god who came down
in the form of hail and entering a girl of thirteen was born and named
Mindiú Qubun Iryil (see Origin of Shamans). All things are asked of him.
He is very kindly and grants many prayers.

The two little beasts are ermines—two sisters who are represented in
little metallic figures. The names of these sisters are Búlai and
Budraganá; to them must be offered horse meat and two salmon as well as
nine pots of tarasun. They are invoked in sickness, especially in cases
of scrofula.

### THE CREATION—ESEGE MALAN

In the beginning there were Esege Malan, the highest god, and his wife,
Ehé Ureng Ibi.

At first it was dark and silent; there was nothing to be heard or seen.
Esege took up a handful of earth, squeezed moisture out of it, and made
the sun of the water; he made the moon in the same way.

Next he made all living things and plants. He divided the world into
East and West, and gave it to the highest order of gods. These gods are
very strict, and people must sacrifice horses and rams to them. If
angered, they punish by bringing sickness, especially to children. Some
of the higher gods punish with disease or misfortune people who offend
local gods. For instance, if a man calls to witness or swears by a local
god,

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

either he is punished by that local god, or judgment is rendered by one
of the superior gods, for it is a great sin to swear by any Burkan,
whether the man swears truly or falsely.

Among these principal gods are the bird gods of the South-west. Many of
them take the form of swans. They are very kind to good people. To these
bird gods offerings are made twice each year. In the autumn a wether is
offered, and in the spring mare's milk, tea, millet, and tobacco.
Between these two higher orders and the Ongon gods there is a secondary
order of Burkans of both sexes. Some of these descended from the higher
Burkans, and others were in the old, old time people who by the favor of
the divinities were made Shamans.

#### ESEGE MALAN AND GESIR BOGDO

##### (TOLD BY ARHOKOFF)

Our great story is from the sky,—the story of Gesir Bogdo. There are, as
you know, people in the sky as well as here. They existed long before we
did—no one knows how long. The oldest and chief of those people is Esege
Malan.

Esege Malan had nine sons. The four elder sons said: "We will succeed
our father." The four younger said: "No, we will succeed him." The
fifth, or middle, son, a hero and very powerful, was on the side of the
four younger brothers. His name was Mahai Danjin.

The four older brothers and the four younger began a dispute, and nobody
knows how long it might have lasted had not Mahai Danjin interfered and
sent the four older brothers down to the earth, to some place beyond the
Frozen Ocean (Arctic), where they created wicked creatures, Mangathais,
and vile serpents, some of which could fly around and swallow people.
They also made immense and savage dogs to destroy things. This they did
to spite their brothers who were ruling in the sky. They would allow no
one to approach them, and to this day no man has been able to reach
their dwelling-place.

As a result of the action of these four brothers, the earth became full
of evil and great disorder, and continued so for many thousands of
years—no man knows how long.

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

Meanwhile Esege Malan, having ceased to rule, had built for himself a
great, splendid fortress around the sky. One day while walking about and
looking at the fortress he found a place broken. He immediately called a
meeting to discover who was trying to destroy his work.

In the heavens there are ninety-nine Tengeri provinces, and this meeting
was formed of one Tengeri from each province. They debated long, but
were unable to find out who or what had made the breach in the wall of
the fortress. At last Esege Malan sent for Zarya Azergesha, "Esh," who
was a very wise man, but he was footless. He refused to come to the
meeting because, having no feet, he was afraid of being laughed at. Then
Esege Malan sent two Shalmos (invisible spirits), to hear what Zarya
Azergesha (hedgehog) might say to himself.

They found him sitting at home, and he was talking, thinking that no one
could overhear him.

"That Esege Malan," said he, "does not understand. He has ninety-nine
Tengeris, and still he could not control his four sons, and they went
down to the earth and are making so much trouble there that the tears of
people have risen to the sky and are weakening the walls of the
fortress. The people have prayed and made libations, have sprinkled
their own blood toward heaven, and when that did no good they sprinkled
their tears. How is it that Esege Malan does not know this? Why send for
me to give him information? All this trouble comes from his four sons.
They are to blame for the tears and the broken battlements."

When the Shalmos heard this they waited no longer, but went quickly to
Esege Malan and told him what Zarya Azergesha had said. Then Esege sent
down to the earth his grand-son, Gesir Bogdo, the son of Mahai Danjin
the hero, sent him as a bird, and he flew over the earth three years,
unable to alight, because of the dreadful odor from dead bodies of every
kind.

At last Esege Malan sent flies which created maggots, and the maggots
ate the dead flesh and purified the earth, and it was sweet and clean.
Then the bird alighted on a broad steppe called Urundashéi, turned
itself into a blue bull, and bellowed

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

loudly in challenge. The four brothers in their home beyond the Frozen
Sea heard the voice and said, "That is the voice of one of our
relatives, one of our own people!"

Then one of the four turned himself into a pied bull and went to the
steppe. The two bulls fought until the pied bull threw the blue bull,
caught him on his horns and tossed him through the air so furiously that
he fell to the earth on the other side of the Altai mountains. Then the
pied bull raced after the blue bull to kill him, but the blue bull
turned himself into stone and stood in his road. The pied bull rushed at
the stone bull, but broke one of his own horns. Then, finding he could
do the blue bull no further harm, he roared:

"Thou hast deceived me! Hereafter I shall be the enemy of all horned
cattle!" And, defeated, he went back to his brothers.

Beyond the Altai that stone bull stands to this day. But Gesir Bogdo,
its spirit, went back to Esege Malan and created heroes to fight the
Mangathais, the evil animals, and the serpents of the North. He had a
son named Buqû Noyon. Buqû Noyon had seven sons and one daughter, whose
name was Irgí Súban. Irgí Súban married Shandu Buqú Besbesh, the
grand-son of Irlik Nomun, the eldest of the four brothers of the North,
and thus the family of Esege Malan was at last pacified.

Solobung Yubún, the Morning Star, is a great personage. He is the
favorite son of Esege Malan. If Buriats want many cattle they sacrifice
a ram at dawn of day, pray to Solobung Yubún, and for three successive
nights dance till daybreak.

### ESEGE MALAN AND MOTHER EARTH

After Esege Malan had straightened out all things, Ehé Tazar, Mother
Earth, went to visit him, and they spent several days very pleasantly.
When Ehé Tazar's visit was ended and she was ready to go, she asked
Esege Malan to give her the sun and the moon, and he gave them gladly;
but he soon found that it was very difficult to get them for her. He
called a thousand Burkans together and asked how he was to accomplish
the feat, and though they studied long and seriously over it they could
not tell him. Then Esege Malan sent for Esh (the hedgehog),

 

<span id="img_12400"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![FIELD
ONGONS.](tn/12400.jpg)

FIELD ONGONS.  
</span>

*Page* [41](jss07.htm#page_41.md)

 

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

and Esh went up to the sky to the dwelling of Esege Malan.

Esege Malan had three daughters who often came down to the earth,
removed their clothing, turned themselves into swans, and sported in the
sea. It happened that the three were at home when Esh came.

Esege had told his daughters that Esh was a queer fellow, that he was
lame and hairy, but he was very wise, and they must not laugh at him.
Notwithstanding this, when Esh walked in Esege's daughters looked
sidewise and laughed; they could not help it, he was so droll. He saw
them laugh and said to himself, "Esege Malan has called me up here for
his daughters to laugh at and ridicule!" He was terribly angry, and left
so quickly that Esege had not time to say a word. Esh knew, however,
what Esege wanted, for the messenger had told him. He came down from the
sky very quickly, but two Shalmos (invisible spirits) followed, sent by
Esege Malan to listen and hear what Esh said as he traveled. For Esege
knew that Esh was raging, and he thought that he might say something
about the sun and the moon.

The first thing Esh saw as he came to earth was a herd of cows and
bulls. When they caught sight of him they were frightened, put up their
tails and ran. Esh, angry that they should be frightened at him, cursed
them, saying:

"May the hair rope never leave your nostrils, and the yoke never leave
your necks!" And so it has been.

He went farther and came to a herd of horses. They were frightened also,
raised their tails, and ran away. Zarya, terribly angry, cursed them,
saying:

"May the bit never leave your mouths and the saddle never leave your
backs!" And so it has been.

The Shalmos followed him always, listening to what he said. After a time
Esh began to talk to himself and abuse Esege Malan. "What sort of a
ruler is that Esege Malan?" asked he. "What sort of a master of the
world? He manages everything, fixes everything. He has given away the
sun and the moon, but does not know how to get them! If he is so wise,
why does he not come to visit Mother Earth, and when the

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

visit is ended and he is ready to go, ask her for the hot dancing air of
summer and the echo, habra yirligin and darbon. She would give them to
him gladly, but how could she get them for him?"

When the Shalmos heard this they followed no farther, but went to the
sky very quickly and told Esege Malan all that Esh had said.

Esege waited until a sufficient time had passed; then he came to return
Mother Earth's visit, and while they were walking around he said: "When
you came to visit me I gave you the sun and the moon, now I ask for a
present. Give me the hot dancing air of summer and echo." She gave them,
but try as she would she could not get them for him.

When she found that it was impossible to get them, and no one could tell
her how to do it, Esege said:

"Let the sun and the moon remain where they are and the hot dancing air
of summer and echo stay here!" And so it is that though the sun and the
moon belong to the earth, they are in the sky, and the hot dancing air
and the echo, though they belong to Esege Malan, remain with Mother
Earth.
