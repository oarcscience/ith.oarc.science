#### YERENTE KHAN AND HIS SON SOKTO

YERENTE was ninety-five years of age, and his wife, Untun Duryai, sixty.
Though they lived in an immense stone yurta, they had neither son nor
daughter.

Yerente owned thousands and thousands of cattle, but for fourteen years
he had not thought to number them. At last he went to count all his
herds, and on counting found that he had lost one light bay stallion and
eighty-five mares with colts and without colts. When he learned this he
began to shed tears.

"I am old, I have no children," lamented he, "and now I have lost my
best horses. At Dalantai lives a Mangathai of seventy-seven heads. He is
the thief; he it is who has stolen my horses." And Yerente went home
weeping.

"Why art thou weeping?" asked his wife, Untun Duryai.

"I am not weeping," replied Yerente. "The wind made my eyes smart and
made the tears flow."

They sat down to eat and drink.

"Though I was not weeping," said Yerente, "I have lost many mares and a
stallion. I must look for those horses at once, I must find them."

"Why do that to-day?" asked Untun Duryai. "You must not go now, you must
stay with me."

"I will go without delay," said he; "soon I shall be too old to go, I
shall not have the strength to travel."

He made ready immediately, put on his trousers of bull-skin (there were
seventy-five skins in that one pair of trousers); then he drew on boots
of fish-skin, put a silver belt around his body, a silk shuba over his
shoulders, and a sable-skin cap on his head. Next he took a quiver and
all that belonged to it, ninety-five arrows. Then he drank spider oil.
He had no need of food for ten years after drinking that oil. When
ready, he opened his iron storehouse and led forth a red bull with horns
sixty fathoms long, took a rope of rawhide, put it through the bull's
nose, sat on the beast's back, and rode away westward.

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

Yerente rode far, rode to a certain mountain beyond the boundary of his
land, and there found his mares and his stallion. The right eye of the
stallion had been dug out, his right front leg had been broken. Yerente
cured the stallion and sent the beast home; with him went the
eighty-five mares with colts and without colts. Then the old man rode
farther on the red bull to find the Mangathai and take vengeance.

After a time he met two young men on horseback; they had iron staffs in
their hands and were looking for a herd of lost horses. He called to
them and said, "I can tell ye where that herd is."

"How couldst thou know, old man? Thou art lying." And the two laughed at
him as he sat on the long-horned red bull.

Yerente was enraged at their ridicule. He sprang from the bull, seized
the young men, tied each to the tail of the horse which he had been
riding, lashed the horses, and sent them rushing homeward over the sandy
steppe.

Then he rode farther on his red bull. When he reached the top of the
mountain he stopped there and looked around on all sides very sharply,
thinking where it was best to go. He saw on the horizon a yurta which
seemed to touch the blue sky; it was shining and splendid. Near the
yurta stood the Mangathai's stallion. This stallion was black, except a
white spot on the right side of his rump.

"Rise up!" called the stallion to his master. "Some one is on Onhoy
Undir Ushin; it must be that an enemy is coming."

The Mangathai came out in one shirt to look; then he sprang on the
stallion and rushed to the mountain.

"Why didst thou take a herd of horses from me in my old age?" asked
Yerente.

"Thou art old; so I was free to take them and keep them, and now I will
tear thee into small bits!" said the Mangathai, springing from his black
stallion and rushing toward the red bull.

Yerente slipped off the bull and went toward the Mangathai. They
approached each other sidewise and came together fiercely. Each with all
his ten fingers tore bits of flesh from the other. The stallion ran at
the bull and bit his spine. The bull drew

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

back, freed himself, and rushed with his long horns at the stallion,
fought with him, pierced him through the breast. Then the bull rushed at
the Mangathai, pierced him, raised him on his horns, and killed him.

On the bull's back was the horse's head. The horse had bitten into the
bull so fiercely that he could not let go, and when he died his head was
torn from his body. Yerente took the head away now.

"The Mangathai's property is of no use to me," said he, and he rode home
on the back of his red bull.

All were well at his coming, but two days afterward Untun Duryai gave
birth to a son and a daughter. Yerente summoned the people. He put
tarasun and meat before them on the first day; on the second day he
placed the infants in a cradle and asked for men to name them.

A gray-haired old man from the North named the boy, called him Sokto
Khan. A gray-haired old man from the South named the girl Agüi.

Yerente sent home the first old man with honor, gave him trousers and a
shuba, gave him the marrow bone of an ox. The gray old man gave Sokto a
cane. The second gray old man received trousers, a shuba, and a marrow
bone, and he gave Agüi a magic stick. Each of the midwives got a silk
shuba and a carcass of beef. To the woman who received his son he gave a
gold ring; to the woman who received his daughter he gave a silver ring.
The two women gave each child a silver ring. All the people went home
then, well satisfied and happy.

When ten days had passed the children were as if ten years old, and a
ram's skin was too small as a coat for the boy to wear. At this time
Duryai said to her husband:

"Go and get for me the flesh of a wild goat. I am tired of common meat."

The old man had a red stallion ninety fathoms long. This stallion was
far from the yurta, pasturing, with thirteen wild deer, in the
mountains. Yerente took his flute and played on it very sweetly; with
this music he summoned the red stallion, and it ran home quickly.
Yerente put a silk saddle-cloth on the stallion, then a saddle of
silver; he put a silver bit in its mouth

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

and silver trinkets on the saddle. Then he mounted, took bow and quiver,
and went to hunt.

The first day he found nothing, the second day no more. That evening he
prepared to spend the night in the forest. "I am old," said he to
himself; "that is why I see no game!"

The third day he killed many goats, took fifteen of them on his red
stallion, and started homeward. When halfway to the yurta the horse sank
to the earth on his knees and began to listen. The old man grew angry at
the stallion; he thought he was lazy and began to beat him. "Why stop
half-way?" cried he.

"Thou hast lived to old age without gaining wit or wisdom," said the
stallion. "Why beat thy horse?"

"Why dost thou stop?"

"I stopped for a reason, and now I will tell it. While thou wert away
hunting game thy wife went to Orhoy, raised the Mangathai to life, and
brought him with her to thy yurta. At this moment he is hidden there
behind seventy-seven closed doors. They have pots of poisoned tarasun to
give thee. Thou art to drink first of good tarasun; in the second pot
will be poison. Thou wilt be drunk from the first pot and poisoned from
the second. The moment thou art home let me out, take off the bridle,
saddle, and all that is on me. Let not thy wife touch my bridle. Thy
wife wants to kill thee and me. Drink not what thy wife gives. If thou
drink thou art dead. More good I cannot do thee. Thy fate is told. Later
on I will help thy son and daughter."

When they reached the yurta Untun Duryai came out to meet Yerente. "How
long thou wert gone! Thou hast wearied thyself for nothing. Give me the
horse. I will help thee, I will tie him to the hitching-post."

"I have never let any one tie my horse; I will do that myself," said
Yerente.

He unsaddled the horse quickly and let him out. "Be as fat as possible,"
said he to the stallion. Yerente went into the yurta. Duryai took him by
the hand, commanded to skin the goats and dress them. All things were
made ready; tarasun was brought in quickly. Duryai gave Yerente one cup
after

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

another, and soon he was drunk. "Let me have more drink!" said he.

"I do not know that there is more tarasun," said the woman. "If there is
I will bring it."

Duryai was in high spirits; she brought another pot of tarasun. Yerente
drank all from the pot and was senseless. The poison came out in blue
and red flames through his mouth and his nostrils. As her husband lay
there, Duryai called to the Mangathai: "Thy enemy is dead now, come out
to me!"

The Mangathai came out, but Yerente was not dead. He sprang up, and the
two fought; the old man fought his false wife and the Mangathai as well.
They struggled for three days and three nights. Yerente was beginning to
overcome the Mangathai.

"Why didst thou raise me?" cried he to Duryai. "Better lie where I was
if I must suffer a second time. Better lie dead in peace than be
punished in this way."

Duryai took blue grains of barley and threw them at the feet of the
Mangathai, chanting words while she scattered them. The Mangathai grew
stronger; then she threw red barley grains at the old man's feet and
chanted; he grew weak and stumbled.

On the fourth day Yerente was very feeble, and the Mangathai finished
him, choked him, killed him. The two put his body in a cask with
ninety-five iron hoops on it and rolled the cask into the Hara Dalai
(Black Sea); then they feasted.

"Thou must kill thy son and daughter," said the Mangathai; "they may
avenge their father's death on me."

"I cannot kill my own children," said Duryai. "If thou wish thou mayst
kill them."

"I have not the strength in me to do it, I have fought so many days with
thy husband. I will rest, and then I will see to them."

In the night the red stallion broke into the yurta, stole Yerente's son
and daughter, and ran away southward to the flat top of a high mountain.

The Mangathai and Duryai went in pursuit.

The red stallion galloped far and very fast. They could not overtake
him, and he saved the two children. On the top of that mountain was the
Water of Life.

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

"Let us go back," said the Mangathai. "What can that horse do alone?
What good is a horse without a master? What good is a knife without a
handle?"

The red stallion gave living water to the children. He found there by
the spring an iron horn, from which they drank. He kept them three whole
years on the mountain. From the north came rain in summer, and for that
reason the right side of the stallion was covered with moss; on his left
side the hair fell off from heat. For three years the children played;
after that the horse said to them. "Ye are large enough now, I may take
you down to the valley. If ye are lucky ye will prosper."

They went down the mountain, and then hand in hand wandered farther.
Soon they came to a large open place, where there were eighty-five
immense pine trees. Beyond the trees was a splendid yurta which shone
like silver. Near the pine trees Sokto made a shelter for his sister.
"Stay here," said he, "till I come"; and he went to the high silver
yurta. Inside he saw a Mangathai with a hundred and eight heads, and his
wife, a very tall woman.

"Whence dost thou come? From what country?" asked the Mangathai. "Thou
must be some khan's son."

"People say, I know not if truly, that I am the son of Yerente Khan,
that I was taken from my father when an infant."

"Thy father was my great enemy. I am glad that thou hast come. I have
need of thee."

Straightway the Mangathai struck Sokto twenty-five strong blows; then he
shut him up in a stone storehouse and gave him a little strip of black
bread to eat. Sokto had passed many days in that storehouse, when some
khan, a friend of the Mangathai, was taking home seventy-five casks of
tarasun. The khan gave tarasun to the Mangathai. He drank and grew
talkative.

"I have the son of Yerente Khan shut up here. I gave him twenty-five
blows of a rod and a bit of black bread. This will do for him daily till
I kill him."

"I have no sons; better give him to me," said the khan. "Such a little
fellow can do no harm."

"If I do not kill him he may become my enemy."

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

The khan gave the Mangathai half a cask of tarasun to drink and begged
again for the boy.

"Let me have all thy casks of tarasun and take him," said the Mangathai
at last.

The khan took the boy home and shouted at the gate, "I have brought a
son with me!" His wife was very glad; she took the boy into the yurta
and said:

"I will summon the people to a feast and adopt him."

All the people came, and while the feast was going on the boy began to
cry. They fondled him and tried to quiet him. On one side stood the new
father, and on the other the new mother. "Why cry?" asked they.

"There were two of us," said the boy, "I and my sister. I left my sister
in a shelter; I know not whether she is dead or alive."

The khan had four black horses brought, and he went with men to find the
sister. Sokto went with them. They rode swiftly, and never stopped till
they reached the shelter. Agüi was not there. They found ashes which
were warm, and Sokto cried, "She must be alive, and not far from here."

They looked for tracks and found them. The time was early morning. The
tracks led to a valley near by. There was dew on the grass, and they
found Agüi drinking dew, which she gathered on her palms. Her face and
body were covered with sores from the bites of insects; she had no
clothing whatever. They gave her milk from home, one spoonful. The khan
took her in his arms and carried her; when half-way to his yurta he gave
her a spoonful and a half of milk. At the gate he cried out:

"I have brought thee a daughter!"

The khan's wife was very glad. She ran out, took the child in her arms,
and carried her into the yurta. Then they called all the people and had
a new feast, which lasted nine days and nine nights. During that time
the brother and sister grew large and beautiful.

In the stable was a splendid gray colt. "This colt will do for my son,"
said the khan; and he made a bridle of red cloth, and reins of the same
stuff. Sokto cared for the colt; he was fond of horses. When a year had
passed he said to his new father:

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

"Show me thy shuba and trousers; I want to see thy clothing and
weapons."

The khan brought his trousers made of seventy elk skins, and boots made
of fish-skin. Sokto was two inches thinner than his father, but the
boots just fitted. Next they brought a splendid silk shuba, a silver
girdle, and a sable-skin cap, as big as a haycock.

"Now bring my bow and all my weapons," said the khan.

Sokto put on the clothes and stood there in his father's splendid
outfit. "Be not angry," said he to the khan. "I must go to see the place
where I was born; after that I will come back."

"Thou art too young," replied his mother. "Thy years are not many. Thy
steed is young also. Better wait one year, even."

"Once he has planned to go, let him go," said his father. "We should not
stop him."

Sokto mounted, and started on his journey. He rode far; at last he let
his horse out to graze. Then he prayed to the thousand Burkans. "Why
create a man and leave him without a proper steed?" asked he.

Immediately the Burkans gave him a steed ninety fathoms long, with ears
nine ells high, an outfit of arms, and a splendid dress. He turned out
his little horse, put his father's dress and weapons under a rock, and
mounting the great new steed, went straight to the hundred and eight
headed Mangathai who had flogged him.

Sokto was now a hero, and the Mangathai was terrified when he saw him.

'Thou hadst power and didst flog me," said Sokto. And he caught the
Mangathai by his waist and throat and pushed him toward the pine trees.
He took ninety-nine spikes and spiked him to the biggest pine; then he
took ninety-nine hoops and bound him to the pine with them.

"Thou wilt neither die nor be free. Thou canst never free thyself, and
another will not free thee. Thou wilt stay here forever," said Sokto.
Then he left him and went toward the yurta; when one verst from the
place he sent an arrow at it, saying to the arrow:

"Destroy the yurta and kill the wife of the Mangathai." The

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

arrow went through the center of the yurta and hit the woman. She gave
premature birth to a son and died. The child sat on the floor and cried,
"Only three days from now was the time for my birth."

Sokto threw the boy into a furnace and made a big fire there. The next
morning he was playing with live coals. "In what a nice, warm
sleeping-place thou didst put me," said he.

Sokto got more wood, made a bigger fire. The child was alive the
following morning. The third night Sokto watched and saw water flowing
into the furnace on to the infant and keeping him cool. A tube came from
the sky to the furnace.

"Three days were left me to be born," complained the boy, "and nine days
later I was to be ready for battle."

The fourth night Sokto cut the tube and the child was consumed by the
fire.

The young hero then took the Mangathai's property and went home to his
father's yurta. All was silent there. He left everything he had brought
and went off to the great house where his mother and the seventy-five
headed Mangathai lived. He called to them from outside.
[Untun](errata.htm#4.md) Duryai recognized his voice.

"Whoever has a son," said she, "will never perish! My son has come!"

She touched the Mangathai with her cane, and both went out. "Which do
you prefer," asked Sokto, "a sharp stake or a square stone?"

"We want nothing of either," replied they. "We wish thee for our son to
take care of us."

"Come," said he. "Walk out here before me. I will find a good place for
you." He took them to where three roads met; on one side was a great
pine, on the other an immense larch tree. He nailed the Mangathai to the
larch tree with ninety-five spikes, and his mother to the pine tree with
ninety-five other spikes. He left two great casks near them; by one cask
was a dull knife, and by the other a blunt pair of scissors, and on the
trees he wrote these words: "With the dull knife every man who passes
must cut a piece of flesh from each of these two who hang here, with the
blunt scissors every woman who passes must

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

cut a piece of flesh from them also. If not they will be treated like
this Mangathai, and this woman."

He turned the Mangathai's yurta bottom upward, and drove away all the
cattle. When he reached his father's yurta he saw no one. He went
straight to his birthplace. The snow that had fallen there was untouched
and unmelted. No living thing was in sight. An iron storehouse stood
near the great yurta. "What can be in there?" thought Sokto, the hero.

The red bull was in that iron building; he had lived on his cud all the
time he had been confined there.

"Thanks to thee," said the bull. "But for the son of my master I should
have perished."

Sokto let the bull out to graze; then he went to Hara Dalai, the Black
Sea, where his father's body was in a cask. He turned himself into a
large fish, and soon he met a still larger one and asked: "Why is this
water so muddy, and why does it smell of blood? If thou wilt not clear
the water Abérga Zgohun will summon thee."

"Whence art thou?" asked the larger fish.

"I live near the Gazada Dalai," replied Sokto.

"Go home; when thou art gone I will cleanse this sea."

Sokto took his own form again. Near the seashore was a mountain. He went
to that mountain and waited. The sea stormed thrice in three days; the
third time it hurled the cask out, threw it a whole verst from the
water.

Sokto came to the shore and beat the cask open, but found nothing in it
save bones. He brought water from nine springs, washed the bones with
nine waters. From nine places he got juniper and burned it for incense.
Next he took Water of Life from the spring on the mountain and washed
the bones three nights with that water; then Yerente became alive and as
well as ever. On the way home they met the red stallion.

"Through thee," said the red stallion, "I have suffered much, and thy
son and daughter have also suffered greatly. Though I advised thou
wouldst not listen; from this came all the trouble."

The stallion seized Yerente by the neck, and shook him three times
fiercely. Then they went to the khan's yurta.

"I never thought that thou wouldst be such a hero," said

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

the khan's wife to Sokto. The next morning all came together,—two
fathers, one mother, one sister, and one brother.

"If I say a word will ye be willing that I accomplish it?" inquired
Sokto.

"We will listen to all that thou sayest," answered his mother.

"Once my father was a khan. I should like to have all my buildings on
the boundary between the lands of both my fathers."

"It is difficult to do that," said the khan. "The buildings on both
dominions are large and numerous. Thou wilt be old before thou canst
move them all."

"No, I can do it in one night if ye say so."

"Do what may please thee," said the mother.

That night Sokto sat at home, went nowhere. From evening until midnight
he prayed to the Heavenly Burkans. At midnight he fell asleep. When he
woke the next morning every building was on the boundary. The khan
assembled all the people at the new place and feasted.

"Now I wish to find a bride," said Sokto.

"Without a wife it is impossible to be," replied the people.

"Thou shouldst read thy book of life," said his mother.

He opened his midriff and found the book in his liver. He read this book
for three days and nights,—at night by torch-light, in the day by
sunlight. At times he cried, at times he sang songs.

"In the south country lives Gul Khan, and he has a daughter, Goye Gohûn
Duhe; she is thy bride," said the book.

Sokto began preparations for the journey. He kept his horse, the red
stallion, standing on ice for three days and three nights, gave him hay
and a little water. This was to make his hoofs strong. Then during three
days and three nights the horse stood on sand. "Now we may go!" thought
Sokto.

"Brother," said Agüi, "thou art going far away; give me some sign by
which I may know how thou art, whether dead or living, slain or in
health."

"I will give you this sign," said he. "Outside, at the southeast corner
of the yurta, grows a golden-trunked aspen tree with silver leaves. On
the twigs of that aspen tree thousands of little birds will be
twittering. These birds will speak in their own

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

way; from them news may be heard through knowledge of their speech. If I
die the tree will rot and fall, and the birds will fly away. If I am
well the tree will be green and beautiful, and the birds will increase
in it. Here is another sign," said he, taking; an arrow and putting it
by his sister's bed: "if I am well this arrow will be red and increase
in beauty; if I die it will fade and grow ugly."

"Thou hast done well," said Agüi. "By these signs I shall know all about
thee. I will give thee a sign." She handed him her gold ring. "If I am
alive and well, this ring will glitter; if dead or ill, or married in
spite of my wishes, the ring will be ugly and dim."

Sokto assembled all the people, placed before them drink and meat in
plenty, and asked them to wish him success and remember him. "I will
bring a bride home to you," said he, in parting.

An old man, gray bearded to the knees, wished him good health and
success on his journey.

Sokto set out on a gallop, rode till he reached another kingdom, then
halted, for right before him was a spring. He took out his pipe and
burned tobacco to the spring; then he threw tobacco into the water. He
named all the thousand Burkans and asked for a favoring journey.

Then he rode farther, rode beyond the boundary of the kingdom. Soon he
heard the tramp of ten horses and the voices of ten riders. He reined in
his steed. "Are those enemies or good people? A man should accomplish
his purpose," said he to himself. "Why should I fear? Those are people
like me!"

He hurried on, turned himself into eleven young heroes on horseback,
made just such a tramping and sound of voices as that which he heard,
only greater.

Soon after he met a big red-faced man. Each tooth in his head was as
large as a spade, and in his ears were rings as big as a cart-wheel. He
was riding on a light bay horse, whose body was eighty fathoms long and
ears sixteen inches high. When they drew near they gave greeting and
passed; then they halted and turned toward each other.

"From what place art thou?" inquired Sokto.

"I am going to Yerente Khan," said the big man. "I have heard that he
has a daughter, Agüi Nogun Duhe; I want her for a wife, but though I
have heard of her, I know not where to find her. I have been told that a
hero is her brother. Whence art thou, and what is thy name?"

"I am Nashin Huimer Hubun. I have also started to find my bride, Geye
Gohûn Duhe, but she is far away."

They took a friendly farewell. "Go thy way; I go mine," said each to the
other. "May we succeed, and our wishes be accomplished."

The big man found Yerente's yurta at last, and declared his wish without
waiting.

"I am not willing to marry thee," said Agüi. "My brother has gone for
his bride. I will not marry before he does. I will marry thee when the
time comes, if thou wilt do one thing that my brother does. Off in the
field is a stone the size of a bullock; throw that stone over thy
shoulder, from the place where it lies to this yurta. If thou do that, I
will marry thee; if not, I will never be thy wife."

He went straight to that stone, raised it to his waist, but could raise
it no farther, and let it fall, then he mounted his steed and went home
without speaking to any man.

Sokto rode on till he came to a great iron yurta. In front of the yurta
were twenty-five horse skulls on stakes; crows had eaten the flesh from
each one of them. Outfits, weapons, and dress were fastened there also.
He stopped, changed his horse into a flint chip, put the chip in his
pocket, changed himself to a weasel, burrowed under the house, passed
through the floor, and came up to see who lived in that great iron
yurta. He saw a hundred and eight headed Mangathai sleeping; near his
principal head lay an axe, his feet were fixed against the wall firmly;
from his mouth blue and red flames were quivering.

The weasel stole up, hid the axe, sprang at the throat of the Mangathai
and cut it through; he crept out, then became Sokto again and the flint
chip became the red stallion.

"Boast not of killing the Mangathai," said the stallion, "no blood is
sold cheaply by any man. This will be a great Shaman place hereafter."

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

Sokto mounted his steed, rode farther and met a twenty-five headed
Mangathai on a gray stallion.

"How didst thou ride by my father's yurta, which no man ever passes on
foot or on horseback?" asked the Mangathai.

"As I rode past I saw twenty-five horse skulls on stakes. A black raven
was croaking, and a young fox was walking about there. The place is
deserted."

"Is it long since you left your father's yurta?"

"Three years ago I had the first wish to marry. I am going for my bride,
Geye Gohun Duhe."

"I should like to know who killed my father. I will find him wherever he
may be," said the Mangathai as he rode away.

Sokto took an arrow and shot it behind himself saying: "As sure as I am
alive and well do thou slay this twenty-five headed Mangathai and his
horse." The arrow killed the Mangathai and his horse and came back to
the quiver.

Sokto went farther, and saw three roads. Between two of them was a shed
and in it a terribly wrinkled old woman. She had but one eye and one
tooth in her head.

"If thou art the son of a good father," said she, "stop. If the son of
an evil father pass on without stopping."

Sokto halted, looked in, and saw tarasun in a silver goblet. "I am
tired, O my grandmother, give me tarasun to drink. I am on a long
journey, I am weary and thirsty."

She gave the tarasun. He saw worms in the goblet, hundreds of them, but
did not like to refuse the tarasun given him. "What good tarasun!" said
he, "but give me more, O my grandmother. There is not enough for a drink
here, give a good large gobletful. Be generous. Why so stingy? O my
grandmother, give me more, give me a plenty."

She smiled and went to the rear of the shed. This time she brought out
three gallons in a strong roomy vessel. He placed the vessel on the
saddle. "I am at fault," said he. "Before I drink bring your pipe, I
will give you tobacco." When she turned to go for the pipe he threw all
the tarasun on her, then galloped off very swiftly.

She hurled after him a scraper twenty fathoms long which was used in
tanning leather. Then she fell down and that

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

moment seven acres of land were covered with foul worms. All the land
covered by the tarasun was burned up immediately. The scraper followed
Sokto; he felt it coming. He made a great stone mountain behind him and
waited on the other side of that mountain to see what would happen.

He waited three days and nights, then the scraper pierced through the
mountain and came out on the other side. Sokto seized it and broke it.
Then he traveled on till he came to a light bay stallion eighty fathoms
long and ears eight ells high; near the stallion lay a young man whose
flesh was almost eaten off by worms from his body. The horse had dug the
earth deeply and was very lean. Sokto let out the horse to graze. The
rider lay still and motionless, though he was not dead yet.

"Thou art my comrade," said the stranger, "thou wilt bury me. I passed
an old witch at the roadside, drank of her tarasun, and the worms from
it have almost devoured me. I am the son of Shur Galgûn Khan. I set out
to find a bride. My name is Shurak Taiji Hubun."

Sokto brought water from nine springs, washed the young man, burned
juniper from nine places, and cured him. The two were great friends now.
Sokto went farther and came to a meadow. In that meadow was a multitude
of frogs, some of them as large as a three-year-old bullock.

"Do not let that traveler pass," said one of the frogs to another. Sokto
turned his horse into a flint chip and himself into a black frog as big
as a young bullock, so that the others should not know him; then he
moved forward slowly. He moved for nine days and nights through that
frog-covered meadow. When he was on the other side he took his own form
again. "Why did ye let him pass?" asked some of the frogs when they saw
him safe beyond their boundary, and they were very angry.

Farther on was a second meadow covered with snakes of many kinds. "Let
not that traveler pass," said the snakes to one another. "If he crosses
this meadow we will kill those snakes which let him pass."

Sokto went back some distance, made his horse a flint chip and himself a
snake like the snakes of that meadow. He spent seven days and nights
among those hostile, [venomous](errata.htm#5.md) snakes,

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

passed by them unobserved and then became a man again. The snakes were
terribly angry and had a furious battle when they found that Sokto had
crossed the meadow.

He went farther till he saw a mountain which touched the sky. He rode to
the foot of it and found many bones there and skeletons. He measured the
horse bones; they were three times as large as the bones of his own
steed. He measured men's bones; they were three times the size of his
own. He wept for nine days and nine nights. The mountain was so steep
that no man could climb it. At last his stallion said:

"Be calm, there is no use in weeping! Go back one day's journey and
tighten my saddle girth. There is a hair on the end of my tail from
which three hairs grow. Take that hair and put it under thy arm. It has
magic power in it. Hold to me firmly."

Sokto went back one day's journey. "Now," said the horse, "I will rush
with all the might in me, and spring to the top of that mountain."

He did so. On the top, at the very edge, was a stone as big as an ox.
The horse's forelegs were beyond that stone and he held to the edge of
it. It was easy to fall and hard to hold. "Throw that hair out in front
of me," said the horse.

Sokto threw the hair. That moment the stone disappeared; out in front
was a good level road through a valley and farther on a broad forest.
They passed the valley and were soon on the mountain top, where there
was a golden-trunked, silver-leafed aspen tree. At the foot of the tree
was the Water of Life, and a silver cup was hanging from a branch of the
tree. Without the cup no man could drink at the spring or take water out
of it. Sokto drank and gave water to his horse. Then the horse began to
graze, and Sokto kindled a fire, made a bed of the saddle-cloth, a
pillow of the saddle, lay down and slept soundly.

The next morning when he rose his horse had changed greatly; he was fat
and strong. Sokto himself felt stronger and better and planned how he
was to finish his journey. Beyond the mountain were the lands of his
father-in-law. He mounted and rode toward them.

On the boundary Sokto made his horse gray and lean, made

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

himself decrepit, white bearded to the knees, old, and wretched. Then he
rode toward the yurta. Five horses of various colors were tied to the
hitching-post. Five splendid young men had come to get brides and had
entered the beautiful yurta. Sokto tied his poor, miserable, gray horse
to the hitching-post, and walked into the yurta.

"A greeting, father-in-law!" said the wretched old man.

The five young heroes laughed as he said this. "What sort of bridegroom
art thou, poor old fellow?" asked they.

"Who art thou, old man?" asked the khan.

"Why talk to me in this way? What a strange father-in-law! Thou hast
five daughters, they should choose their own bride-grooms. Assemble the
people to-morrow, let each daughter choose the man who pleases her."

The daughters were behind seventy-seven doors at this time. The next day
the khan assembled the people and entertained them. He gave his
daughters five marrow bones. "Choose thy bridegroom," said he to each
daughter. Each was to give a marrow bone to the man whom she selected.

The five sisters went out together and four gave bones to four of the
five young strangers. The fifth, who was the youngest sister, would not
give hers to the fifth stranger, but threw it toward the old man, and
ran away quickly. All wondered at this and were sorry for the fifth
young man who was left without a bride.

The khan gave four fine yurtas to the four young strangers, to the fifth
bridegroom, the old man, he gave a shed made of hay. "Ye will live
here," said the father-in-law.

The next morning he called out the four sons-in-law and said: "I am
tired of eating common meat, kill some wild goats for me." To the old
man he said nothing. The old man's bride went to her father:

"I will send my husband to hunt," said she.

"Why send that old fool?" asked her father, "he will knock against a
tree and kill himself."

"Let him kill himself if he wishes, I am ashamed to be the bride of that
old man."

The four went out to hunt wild goats, and the old man went

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

also. He made his horse lame. The beast could hardly move he was so
crippled and wretched. They reached the forest. The four young strangers
hunted all day, but found no game. The old man killed only one goat;
when he shot it he said: "Let the whole body be poison except the
entrails; let the entrails be the cure." Then he sat down in the forest
by a fire which he had made. The four came to him. "Have ye killed
anything?" asked he. "No, hast thou?"

"One small goat and I don't know how to skin it." They skinned it for
him. "Divide the meat into five parts," said they. He divided it; gave
them the clear meat, and kept the skin and entrails. They carried the
flesh to their father-in-law. The old man's bride cooked the entrails
and took them to her father. She found him sick, swollen, very ill, and
complaining:

"I ate meat and am sick from it. Why bring entrails? Dost thou wish to
kill me?" cried the khan in anger.

"Thou mightst even taste, even catch the odor!" urged the daughter.

He took a spoonful; found it good, took a cupful, was cured, became well
altogether.

The next morning he called the four bridegrooms and said: "Go again to
hunt but bring me the entrails this time." Before they left the youngest
daughter came to her father. "I will send the old man to hunt," said
she.

"Do not send him, his horse is lame. That old fellow can kill nothing."

"Let him go," begged the daughter; "if something happens to him I shall
not be sorry."

The four young bridegrooms laughed, ridiculed the old man.

He grew angry at their laughter and jokes and when they reached the
forest he kindled a fire and sat down by it. "Go ye to hunt," said he.
"I will stay here by the fire." He killed another goat. When he sent the
arrow he said: "Let the entrails be poison and the meat the cure."

"What have ye killed?" asked he of the four when they came in the
evening. "Nothing," said they.

"Though I have killed one big goat I will not divide this time," said
the old man. They insisted on division till at last

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

he said: "I will divide if each of you will give me a finger's width of
skin from his neck to the end of his back." They agreed to this. The old
man cut the strap, then they took the entrails and left him the clean
meat.

The four daughters cooked the entrails and gave them to their father. He
ate them, and grew very sick; was swollen to the size of a
three-year-old bullock and began to cry: "My end is coming, my end is
near! I must die this time!"

The old man's bride cooked clean meat and brought it to her sick father.
"Why bring me meat?" asked he. "I do not want it." She bowed down to
him, entreated: "Try a little." The meat was very savory. The moment the
khan ate a mouthful he was well again.

On the third morning he called the four bridegrooms and said:

"To-night my big gray mare will have a colt. Will ye watch her? She has
had three colts in three years and each one was stolen from me."

The four agreed to watch. The old man's bride heard of this and said: "I
will send my husband to watch with them."

"No need of him," said the father. "Why send that fool?"

"I can spare him," answered the wife. "I am not sorry for him. Let him
kill himself if he wishes." "Send him then," said the father.

The herd was in a valley, and the five bridegrooms went there. A heavy
frost came down in the night and the air was very cold. They built a
fire and the four sat by it shivering. The old man was not cold.

"Warm yourselves," said he to the four, "I will go to the other side of
the valley." He went, found the gray mare, turned himself into a reed
and watched to see who it was that stole the colt each year.

At midnight a fifty-five headed and fifty horned Mangathai came. The
mare had her colt. The reed shot the Mangathai with an arrow, killed
him, took the colt and placed it with the mother. Then he collected
sticks, made a fire and burned the Mangathai. The ashes from his bones
filled ninety-seven bags. Then the old man made a windmill, ground all
the ashes in the ninety-seven bags and let the wind bear the ashes away.
All

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

was finished by morning. The four bridegrooms knew nothing of what had
happened. At dawn the old man was by their fire. They were nearly
frozen, almost dead from cold. Ile gathered wood, warmed them, then
asked:

"What have ye seen during the night? What have ye been doing?"

"We have seen nothing. What hast thou seen?"

"I have seen a fine thing. I have seen who it is that steals the colts,
but I will not tell you." They urged and begged. At last he said: "Give
me four straps from the flesh of your thighs, then I will tell."

They looked at one another. "We must give the straps," said they. They
cut the straps and gave them. "I saw," said the old man, "only this—that
a shadow, a bird or something, I know not exactly what, took the colt
and swallowed it. That is all I saw."

The four returned, appeared before their father-in-law and said: "At
midnight came a shadow, or a bird, or something of that sort, we are not
sure what, and swallowed the colt. We could not shoot it."

"For three years the same thing has happened," said the khan. "Go home
now and eat." When the four had gone the old man came.

"What are thy four sons-in-law doing?" asked he. "Are they shooting? Do
they kill anything?"

"My four sons-in-law saw last night how a shadow swallowed the gray
mare's colt. But thou, old man, what art thou doing?" "Nothing, but
getting straps."

"Let me have them," said the father-in-law. "What kind of straps are
these?" asked he, as he looked at them.

"I got those straps from thy four sons-in-law. They went to kill goats,
killed none. I gave them clear meat, and kept the entrails. Thou wert
sick from the meat, and wert cured by the entrails. Then I gave them
entrails for straps from their backs; thou wert sick from entrails, and
wert cured by the clear meat."

"Thou art wiser, it seems, than the four, and have better understanding
than any one of them. How didst thou get the other four straps from the
bridegrooms?"

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

"For telling them that a shadow, or bird, seized the colt. I did not
tell them what really happened. I will tell thee the whole truth. A
Mangathai came in the night; I shot that Mangathai, and killed him. The
colt is alive now, and any one may see it at the place where I killed
the Mangathai."

"Thou art the son of a khan, and thou art young," said the
father-in-law. "Be kind and take thy own shape." The father-in-law bowed
down a whole day, and begged: "Tell the truth. Tell what thy name is."
At last the old man said:

"My name is Khan Sokto, and I am the son of Yerente Khan."

"Why didst thou not tell me thy name?"

Sokto gave no answer. The father-in-law summoned the four bridegrooms,
made them show their backs and thighs, tried the straps and saw that
they fitted.

"Ye cannot be my sons-in-law," said he. "Ye cut up your own bodies, and
might cut up my daughters." And he drove them away that same evening.

The next day a splendid feast was given and it lasted nine days and
nights, for Sokto was young now and had his own form.

"Prepare the wedding quickly," said Sokto. "I must go home to my father,
my mother, and my sister."

"Near the Gazada Dalai," said the khan, "is Yellow Dog. Get that dog for
me, and we will have the wedding immediately. If not we will not have it
at any time."

Sokto went to his bride and told her all. "What does thy father wish to
do with me?" asked he.

"No hero can get Yellow Dog," said the bride. "Better go home than try.
It is impossible to get it. Though many men have gone for it no man has
ever come back. Find some other bride; there are many maidens in other
lands."

"I will not go home," said Sokto. "I will go for Yellow Dog. It is
unknown whether I shall die on the way, or come back, but I will make
the trial." Then he went to consult with his horse.

"Thou must go to the sky," said the horse, "and tell Esege Malan; take
advice of him. The seven heavenly smiths may help thee."

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

Sokto made his horse into a flint chip, and went to the sky as a gray
falcon.

"What hast thou to do?" asked Esege Malan. Sokto told what the task was.

Esege Malan ordered the seven smiths to make an immense chain for the
dog's neck, heavy fetters for his feet, and two iron hoops to confine
his mouth.

Sokto went to the smiths and they made all that was needed. While they
were forging Sokto chanted: "As I live and am well this chain is to give
Yellow Dog to me." He went through the heavens to where Yellow Dog was;
he could not go on the earth, could not find him. He saw the dog from
the sky. When above the shore of the Frozen Ocean he threw the chain,
fetters, and hoops, and chanted: "If I am victorious let this chain
fasten around Yellow Dog's neck, let the fetters fasten on his feet, and
these two hoops confine his mouth. If I am not victorious let them drop
to the earth and be harmless." As he spoke they fell on the dog and
captured him. Sokto then rushed down to the earth. The dog whined,
dashed about, but could do nothing. Then he stopped, and said:

"In all the world there was no magic that could harm me. I have heard
that Khan Sokto is born; a great hero must he be, for no other could
bind me in this way. O Sokto, if thou wish to conquer, conquer quickly.
If to kill, kill me now. If to help, help this minute."

That moment the chain became laxer, the fetters dropped off, the hoops
loosened. Sokto sat on his horse; led the dog to his father-in-law's
yurta, and tied him to the hitching-post.

"Such a dog is not needed here!" screamed the khan. "Take him back to
where you found him!"

"I cannot take him back," said Sokto. "He eats a whole bullock at a
meal."

The dog heard the conversation and said to Sokto:

"Give me enough to eat, and I will go back to my own place alone. I fear
nothing on earth. For ten years I shall be a great friend to thee. If
any trouble happens between thee and thy father-in-law I will be on thy
side."

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

Yellow Dog ate much; he ate a whole ox and went home to the edge of the
Frozen Ocean.

At Sokto's wedding all the people feasted nine days and nine nights.
"What will you give me as a present?" asked the bride of her father. He
gave her a bay horse, ninety fathoms long, his ears nine ells high, with
a saddle of silver and housings of silk. They mounted, and the people
followed them. Sokto showed the road to the company. He tied to his
horse's tail a larch tree so thick that nine men could not encircle it.
"When I halt on the road," said he, "it means that we are to smoke, when
I make a circuit with the tree it means a night camp.

He traveled swiftly and in nine days was at home. All were well there,
and they were waiting for him. He summoned the people; meat and drink
were set out for all; but they waited for those who followed. In three
days they arrived and then every one feasted for nine days and nine
nights. At the end of that time the guests went home, and Sokto and his
wife lived on as people live usually.

Now Narin Huimer Hubun, the big man, who could not hurl the great stone,
came a second time for Sokto's sister.

"What is thy business, and why hast thou come?" inquired Sokto.

"I have come to ask for thy sister."

"What is thy reason for thinking to get her?"

"Esege Malan said that I was to have her as wife."

"I believe thee," said Sokto. "But thou must remain three years with me,
help me in making lists of my people, and counting my herds and cattle.
I am terribly tired. For twelve years I have been traveling and
struggling. I need thy assistance."

Narin Hubun agreed to this, and aided in counting the herds. At the end
of three years Sokto said to him, "It is time for thee to have thy own
yurta." Then he invited the people and the next day began a wedding
which lasted nine days and nine nights; at it ravens and magpies ate all
they wanted. The whole world ate, and was glad.

"I took care of thy yurta for twelve years," said the sister, "what wilt
thou give me for a present?"

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

Sokto had a bay horse eighty fathoms long, which had been trained for
eight days.

"Take this horse," said he, "and ask nothing of another person. I thank
thee for thy care of my yurta while I was struggling with Mangathais,
and winning my bride."

Sokto's sister mounted and rode away with her bridegroom, contented and
happy.
