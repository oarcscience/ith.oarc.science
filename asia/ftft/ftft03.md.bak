LLAH, the most gracious God, whose dwelling, place is the seventh
heaven, completed the work of creation. Seven planes has the heaven and
seven planes also the earth--the abode of evil spirits. In the heavenly
ways reside the peris, or good spirits; in the earthly darkness the
dews, or evil spirits. The light of heaven is in conflict with the
darkness of earth--the peris with the dews. The peris soar to heaven,
high above the earth; but the dews sink down into the darkness under the
earth. Mountains bar the road to heaven, and only the good spirits can
reach the Copper Range, whence the way is open to the Silver Mountains
and the Hills of Gold. Evil spirits are blinded by the ineffable
radiance of heaven. Their dwelling place is the depths of the earth, the
entrance to which is at the spring of waters. There tarry the white and
the black sheep, into whose wool the evil spirits penetrate, and are so
conveyed to their realm on the seventh plane. On the white sheep they
return to the earth's surface. Peris and dews are powerful, and both
were witnesses of the creation of earth's original inhabitant, the First
Man.

Allah created the First Man, and appointed him the earth for his
dwelling-place. And when the First Mortal appeared upon the earth and
the peris rejoiced over Allah's wonderful work, the Father of Evil
beheld it, and envy overcame his soul. Straightway he conceived a plan
whereby to bring to nought that beneficent work,

He would implant the deadly seed of sin in this favoured creature of the
Almighty; and soon the First Man, all unsuspecting, received on his pure
body the damnable spittle of the Evil One, who struck him therewith in
the region of the stomach. But Allah, the all-merciful, the overcomer of
all things, hastened to tear out the contaminated flesh, and flung it to
the ground. Thus originated the human navel. The piece of flesh, unclean
by reason of the Evil One's spittle having defiled it, obtained new life
from the dust, and thus, almost simultaneously with man, was the dog
created--half from the human body and half from the Devil's spittle.

Thus it is that no Mahometan will harm a dog, though he refuses to
tolerate him in his house. The animal's faithfulness is its human
inheritance, its wildness and savagery are from the Evil One. In the
Orient the dog does not increase, for while the Moslem is its protector,
he is at the same time its implacable enemy.
