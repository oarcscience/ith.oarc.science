E were three brothers; two of us were silly, and neither of us had a bit
of sense. We went to the bow-maker's and bought three bows, two of which
were broken, and the third had no string. <span id="img_35801"></span>

In a stream without a drop of water swam three ducks, two of which were
dead, while the third hadn't a spark of life. We shot one with an arrow,
and taking it in our hand, set off up hill and down dale, drinking
coffee and smoking tobacco, gathering tulips and hyacinths, until we had
travelled the length of a barleycorn.

On and on we went, until we came to three houses, two of which were in
ruins, while the third had no foundation. There lay three men, two dead
and one without life. We asked the dead men to give us a vessel to cook
our duck in. They showed us three cupboards, two of which were broken
and the third had no sides. In them we found three plates, two full of
holes and the third without bottom. In the plate with out bottom we
cooked the duck. One of us said, "I have eaten sufficient;" the other,
"I've no appetite," and I said, "No more, thank you." He who said he had
eaten sufficient ate up

the whole duck, he who said he had no appetite ate up the bones; at
which I became angry and ran away to a melon-field.

Taking my knife from my girdle I cut a melon. Where my knife was, there
was I. Meeting a caravan, I asked where my knife was. They answered me:
"For forty years we have been looking for twelve camels we have lost. As
we have not been able to find them, how do you think we could find your
knife?"

At this I went away in anger and came to a tree. Close by was a basket
in which some one had put a murdered man. As I looked at him I saw forty
thieves approaching; so I took to my heels, they after me. Running till
I was out of breath I reached an old tumbledown djami, in the court of
which I sat down to rest. The thieves followed and chased me round and
round the court, until in my despair I sought to escape them by climbing
to the pinnacle of the minaret. One of the thieves drew his knife and
came at me, when with a loud shriek I loosed my hold and fell to earth.

In mortal terror I suddenly opened my eyes--to discover that I had been
dreaming!
