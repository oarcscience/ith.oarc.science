T the time when Allah had many servants and mankind much sorrow, there
was a poor woman who had three sons and a daughter. The youngest son was
somewhat simple and lay all day by the fireside.<span

One day the two elder sons went into the fields to work, and before
leaving requested their mother to cook them something to eat and send it
to them by their sister. In the neighbourhood a Dew with three heads had
erected his dwelling, and the brothers instructed their sister which way
to take in order to avoid him.

When the dinner was ready the maiden set out to take it to her brothers,
but she mistook her way and strayed into the path leading to the Dew's
house. She had walked but a few steps when the wife of the three-headed
Dew stood before her and asked her how she came there. She chatted with
the trembling girl until she had enticed her into the house, promising
to hide her from her husband.

But the Dew with the three heads was there waiting for the maiden. As
she entered the woman said that she would soon have a meal ready. "I
will knead the dough," she

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

said, "but you, my daughter, must make the fire." Scarcely had the girl
begun to build up the fire than the Dew stole in, opened his mouth, and
swallowed her just as she was.

In the meantime the men were expecting their dinner; they waited and
waited, but neither girl nor dinner were forthcoming. Evening fell, and
when the two brothers, arriving home, learnt that their sister had set
out in the fore noon, they suspected what had befallen her. She must
have strayed into the Dew's locality. The eldest brother, after a little
reflection, resolved to go to the Dew and demand the girl.

<span id="img_07800"></span> ![O my stomach! O my stomach! cried the
youth](img/07800.jpg.md)

Walking along, smoking his chibouque and smelling the flowers, he came
to a baking-oven by the roadside. By the oven stood a grey-bearded man,
who asked him where he was going. The brother told him of the misfortune
which he feared had overtaken his sister, and added that he was seeking
the Dew with the three heads, in order to kill him.

"You cannot kill the Dew," rejoined the old man, "until you have eaten
of the bread baking in this oven." The youth thought that would be no
great feat. Taking a loaf out of the oven, he bit it, then commenced to
run until he had left man, oven, and bread far behind.

Stopping to take breath, he saw a man carrying a vessel filled with
wine. To this man the brother spoke of his business with the Dew, "You
can

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

do nothing to the Dew," said the man, "until you have drunk some of this
wine." The youth accordingly attempted to drink, but crying, "Oh, my
stomach! Oh, my stomach!" he ran from the spot and never paused until he
reached two bridges. One bridge was of wood, the other of iron; on the
opposite side thereof stood two apple-trees, one bearing sour, the other
sweet apples.

<span id="img_tinit"></span>

HE Dew with the three faces was waiting on the road to see which bridge
the youth would choose, the wooden or the iron one; which apples he
would eat, the sweet or the sour. Fearing the wooden bridge might break
down, the youth crossed by the iron one; as the sour apples were not
ripe, he plucked the sweet ones. The Dew had now learnt enough. He sent
his wife to meet the youth, and she enticed him into the house. Very
shortly he found himself in the Dew's stomach beside his sister.

Now the second son set out in quest of his brother and sister. He also
could not eat the bread, and the wine gave him stomachache. He also
crossed over the iron bridge, ate the sweet apples, and arrived
eventually in the Dew's stomach.

We will now turn our attention to the youngest son. The mother observing
the simpleton get up from the fireside, begged him not to forsake her in
her old age. The others had done so, but he at least should remain with
her. But the youth would not listen. "No," said he, "till my sister and
my brothers are rescued, and the Dew killed, I cannot rest."

Rising from his corner, he shook the ashes from him, and at that moment
such a storm arose that all the farmhands ran home, leaving their
ploughshares in the fields. The simpleton collected all these shares
together and took them to a blacksmith, requesting him to make of them a
spear which, when thrown into the air, should fall on his finger without
breaking. When the smith had made the spear, the youth threw it up in
the air, and as it fell back on his little finger, it broke in
fragments.

Again the simpleton shook the ashes from him and another storm arose

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

which sent all the field labourers hurrying home. Again he collected the
ploughshares and took them to the smith. The second spear was made, but
this also was shattered at the trial.

<span id="img_finit"></span>

OR the third time the youth raised a storm, after which he collected all
the remaining ploughshares and had them made into a spear. This time it
did not break when it fell back on his finger. "That will do," said the
simpleton, and went his way.

Before long he arrived at the baking-oven. The baker greeted him, and
learning that he was on his way to kill the Dew, informed him that he
could accomplish his purpose only after eating the bread, and drinking
wine out of the vessel that he would find farther on. The simpleton
accepted his task, ate up all the bread, drank all the wine, and as he
journeyed further he came to the wooden and iron bridges, with the
apple-trees beside them.

The Dew was watching anxiously, and his courage sank when he saw the
youth's actions. "Any child of man can go over the iron bridge," thought
the simpleton to himself, and so he chose the wooden one. "There is also
no art in eating sweet apples," he said, and chose those that were sour.
"With this fellow we must deal in a different manner," called the
affrighted Dew to his wife. "Get ready my spear; we must fight it out"

The simpleton had already seen the Dew afar off; he walked directly up
to him and greeted him civilly. "If thou hadst not greeted me," said the
Dew, "I should have swallowed thee." "And for my part," retorted the
youth, "I should have killed thee with a spear-thrust hadst thou not
returned my greeting."

"If thou art so valiant," said the Dew with the three heads, "have at
thee with the spear!"

The Dew, taking his spear in hand, threw it with all his might at the
youth, who caught it on his little finger, where it was shattered to
pieces. "Now it is my turn," said the simpleton. He threw his spear with
such

force that, as it struck the Dew, the latter's spirit departed through
his nose. "Strike once more, if thou art a good fellow," gasped the Dew;
but as the youth answered "Never! " the Dew breathed his last. Now the
youth sought the Dew's wife. When they opened the body of the wizard,
the two brothers and their sister came out. With the simpleton they now
wended their way homeward.

The Dew's spirit departed through his nose.  

While in the stomach of the Dew the brothers and sister had become very
thirsty; coming to a well they requested their younger brother's help in
procuring water to drink. All took off their girdles, fastened them
together, and let the eldest down the well. He was scarcely half, way
down when he began to bellow with fear: "Oh, draw me up, I am burning!"

He was pulled up immediately, and the second brother next essayed the
task, but the same thing happened also with him.

"Now it is my turn," said the simpleton, "but mind you do not draw me up
however much I may beg you to do so." So they let him down, and though
they heard his cries of fear

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

they took no heed, but lowered him to the bottom of the well. Here he
found a room, and entering, he beheld three maidens, beautiful as the
full moon. They were very much alarmed at sight of the youth, and
implored him with tears to leave the Dew's cave, but he would not
listen.

<span id="img_tinit"></span>

O be brief he killed the Dew and delivered the three maidens, whom the
wizard had robbed from their father, the Sultan, seven years before. The
simpleton intended to give the two eldest in marriage to his brothers
and wed the youngest himself. Having filled his jug with water he led
the maidens to where the rope still hung. The eldest was the first to be
drawn up, and the eldest brother took her under his care, as his
youngest brother requested; then ascended the second, who was to be
protected by the second brother; lastly, the third maiden was helped up.
She advised the youth to ascend first and allow her to follow him. "Thy
brothers will be angry that thou hast chosen the most beautiful maiden
for thyself," she said, "and from envy they will not draw thee out of
the well."

"Then will I find my own way out," answered the youth.

Seeing that she could not persuade him, she took a box and gave it to
him, saying: "When thou art in danger, open this box. If thou strikest
the flint it contains, an Arab will appear and execute all thy commands.
If thy brothers should abandon thee here in the well, go to the Dew's
palace and stand by the pond there. Two sheep come daily, a black one
and a white one; if thou shouldst seize the skin of the white one, thou
wouldst be conveyed to the surface of the earth; but if thou shouldst
seize that of the black sheep, thou wouldst go down into the under
ground regions."

On this she was drawn up to the top of the well. Hardly had the brothers
set eyes on her than they both fell in love with her, and as she had
foretold, they left the simpleton down the well.

What was he to do now? He went back to the palace, stood by the pond,
and awaited the coming of the sheep. Presently a white and a

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

black sheep sprang in. The youth seized the black one instead of the
white, and in a trice found himself in the underground country. "I will
take a stroll about this territory," he thought to himself, and began to
walk on.

He walked day and night, up hill and down dale, till, unable to go
farther, he stopped to rest by a tall tree. His eyes beheld a long snake
creeping up the tree. The creature would have swallowed a nest of young
birds if the youth had not rescued them just in time.

Grasping his spear firmly in his hand, he severed the snake in two, Then
he stretched himself out under the tree, where, overcome by fatigue and
the great heat, he fell sound asleep.

<span id="img_08400"></span> ![He seized the black one](img/08400.jpg.md)

Meanwhile came the little birds' mother, who was the emerald anka, queen
of the Peris. Seeing the sleeping youth, she mistook him for the enemy
that year by year killed her children, and would have torn him to pieces
had not the little birds cried to her to do him no harm. They told her
how he had killed their enemy the snake, and looking round, the anka saw
the severed body of the reptile.

She flicked the flies from the sleeper, and spread her wings to shield
him from the sun, so that when he awoke he saw the bird's wings over him
like a tent. The anka told him she wished to reward him for his generous

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

deed, and inquired what he would like. "Transport me to the surface of
the earth," was his answer.

"I will take you up," said the emerald-bird, "if you have forty
hundredweight of mutton and forty bottles of water. Put them on my back
and then get up yourself. When I say 'Gik!' feed me, and when I say
'Gak!' give me drink."

The youth thought of the box. He opened it, took out the flint and
struck it. "What is thy command, my sultan?" exclaimed the Arab of the
monstrous lips, who instantly appeared. "Forty hundredweight of mutton
and forty bottles of water." In a few minutes the meat and the water
were on the bird's back; the youth also mounted, and when the anka cried
"Gik!" he gave her meat and when she cried "Gak!" he gave her drink. She
flew from one plane of the earth to the other, and ere long reached the
surface, where the youth alighted. The bird promised to wait until he
returned.

The youth now took out the box and commanded the Arab to bring him news
of the three sisters. In a short time the Arab brought the maidens
themselves. They all mounted on the bird's back, loaded her with meat
and water, and flew away to the native land of the three maidens,

"Gik!" cried the anka, and they gave her meat; "Gak!" and they gave her
water. But as there were now four human beings to be fed also, there was
not sufficient meat to last throughout the journey and there was no more
wherewith to supply the bird. When the anka cried "Gik!" the youth took
his sword, cut a piece from his leg and stuck it in the bird's beak. The
anka, perceiving it was the flesh of a mortal, ate it not, but held it
fast in her beak. When they reached the land of the three sisters, she
told him that it was impossible for her to go farther.

His leg was so painful that the youth could not walk a step. "Go," said
he to the bird, "I will rest here a little."

"Oh, you foolish youth!" answered the emerald-bird, and taking the flesh
from her beak she pressed it into its place. Instantly the leg was
healed.

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

Great was the astonishment in the town at the homecoming of the Sultan's
daughters. The old Padishah could scarce believe his eyes. He embraced
and kissed them, heard their story, and gave his kingdom as well as his
youngest daughter to the simpleton.

The youth invited his mother and sister to the wedding, and his sister
was given in marriage to the son of the Vezir. The rejoicings lasted
forty days and forty nights, but happiness until the end of their days.
