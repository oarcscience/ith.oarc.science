HERE was once a Padishah who one day found a little insect.<span

The Padishah called his lala and they both examined the tiny creature.
What could it be? What could it feed on? Every day an animal was killed
for its sustenance, and by thus living it grew and grew until it was as
big as a cat. Then they killed it and skinned it, hanging up the skin on
the palace gate. The Padishah now issued a proclamation that who ever
could guess correctly to what animal the skin belonged should receive
the Sultan's daughter in marriage.

A great crowd collected and examined the skin from all sides, but no one
was found wise enough to answer the question. The story of the skin
spread far and wide until it reached the ears of a Dew. "That is
exceedingly fortunate for me," thought he to himself, "I have had
nothing to eat for three days; now I shall be able to satisfy myself
with the Princess." So he went to the Padishah, told him the name of the
creature, and immediately demanded the maiden.

"Woe is me" groaned the Padishah, "how can I give this Dew my

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

only daughter?" He offered him, in ransom for her, as many slaves as he
liked, but all in vain! The Dew insisted on having the Sultan's
daughter. Therefore the Padishah called the maiden and told her to
prepare for the journey, as her kismet was the Dew. All weeping and
wailing were fruitless. The maiden put on her clothes, while the Dew
waited for her outside the palace.

The Padishah had a horse that drank attar of roses and ate grapes;
Kamer-taj, or Moon-horse, was its name. This was the creature on which
the Sultan's daughter was to accompany the Dew to his abode. A cavalcade
escorted her a portion of the way and then, turning, rode back. Now the
maiden offered up a prayer to Allah to deliver her from the fiend.

Suddenly the Moon-horse began to speak: "Lady, fear not! shut both your
eyes and hold my mane firmly." Hardly had she shut her eyes when she
felt the horse rise with her, and when she opened her eyes again she
found herself in the garden of a lovely palace on an island in the midst
of the sea.

The Dew was very angry at the disappearance of the maid. "Still, never
mind!" he said, "I will soon find her," and went his way home alone. Not
far from the island a Prince sat in a canoe with

his lala. The Prince, seeing on the calm surface of the water the
reflection of the golden-hued steed, said to his lala that perhaps some
one had arrived at his palace. They rode to the island, got out of the
canoe, and entered the garden. Here the youth saw the beautiful
Princess, who, however much she essayed to veil her face, could not
succeed in hiding from him her loveliness.

"Oh, Peri!" said the Prince, "fear me not; I am not an enemy!" "I am
only a Sultan's daughter, a child of man and no Peri," announced the
Princess, and told the Prince how she had been delivered from the Dew.
The Prince assured her that she could not have come to a better place.
His father also was a Padishah; with her permission he would take her to
him, and by the grace of Allah he would make her his wife. So they went
to the Padishah, the Prince told him of the maiden's adventure, and in
the end they were married, merriment and feasting lasting forty days and
forty nights.

For a time they lived in undisturbed bliss, but war broke out with a
neighbouring kingdom and, in accordance with the custom of that period,
the Padishah also must set out for the campaign. Hearing of this the
Prince went to his father and asked permission to go to the war. The
Padishah was unwilling to consent, saying: "you are young, also you have
a wife whom you must not forsake." But the son begged so assiduously
that in the end the Padishah agreed to stay at home and let Prince go in
his stead.

The Dew discovered that the Prince would be on the battlefield, and he
also made the further discovery that during his absence a son and a
daughter had been born to him.

At that time Tartars were employed as messengers and carried letters
between the Padishah at home and the Prince at the seat of war. One of
these messengers was intercepted by the Dew and invited into a coffee.
house. There the Dew entertained him so long that night came on. The
messenger now wished to be off, but was persuaded that it would be

| ![The Dew searched his letter bag](img/14500.jpg.md) |

better to remain till morning. At midnight, while he was asleep, the Dew
searched his letter-bag and found a letter from the Padishah to the
Prince informing the latter that a baby son and daughter had come to the
palace during his absence. Tearing up this letter, the Dew wrote another
to the effect that a couple of dogs had been born. "Shall we destroy
them or keep them till your return?" wrote the Dew in the false letter.
This missive he placed in the original envelope, and in the morning the
Tartar arose, took his sack of letters, and went into the Prince's camp.

When the Prince had read his father's letter he wrote the following
answer: "Shah and father, do not destroy the young dogs, but keep them
until I return." This was given to the Tartar, who set out on his return
journey.

He was again met by the Dew, who enticed him into a coffeehouse and
detained him till next morning. During the night the Dew abstracted the
letter and wrote another, which said: "Shah and father, take my wife and
her two children and throw them down a precipice, and bind the
Moon-horse with a fifty-ton chain."

In the evening of the day following the Tartar delivered the letter to
the Padishah. When the Princess saw the Tartar she hastened joyfully to
the monarch that he might show her her husband's letter. The Padishah,
having read it, was astonished and dared not show it to the Princess, so
he denied that any letter had arrived. The woman answered: "I have

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

indeed seen the letter with my own eyes; perchance some misfortune has
happened to him and you are keeping it from me." Then catching a glimpse
of the letter she put forth her hand quickly and took it. Having read it
the poor woman wept bitterly. The monarch did his best to comfort her,
but she refused to remain longer in the palace. Taking her children she
left the city and went forth into the wide world.

Days and weeks passed away and she was without food to appease her
hunger or bed on which to rest her tired body, until worn out with
fatigue she could go no step farther. "Let not my children die of
hunger!" she prayed. Behold! instantly water gushed forth from the earth
and flour fell from the skies, and making bread with these she fed her
children.

In the meantime the Dew heard of the woman's fate and set out
immediately to destroy the children. The Princess saw the Dew coming and
in her terrible agony she cried: "Hasten, my Kamer-taj, or I die!" In
the far-off land the magic horse heard this cry for help; he strained at
his fifty-ton fetters but could not break them. The nearer the Dew came
the more the poor Princess's anguish increased. Clasping her children to
her breast, she sent up another despairing cry to the Moon-horse. The
fettered steed strained still more at his chain, but it was of no avail.
The Dew was now quite close upon her, and for the last time the poor
mother shrieked with all her remaining strength. Kamer-taj, hearing it,
put forth all the force he could muster, broke his chain, and appeared
before the Princess. "Fear not, lady! " he said, "shut your eyes and
grasp my mane," and immediately they were on the other side of the
ocean. Thus the Dew went away hungry once more.

The Moon-horse took the Princess to his own country. He felt that his
last hour had now come, and told his beloved mistress that he must die.
She implored him not to leave her alone with her children. If he did,
who would protect them from the evil designs of the Dew? "Fear not," the
horse comforted her, "no evil will befall you here. When I am dead, off
my head and set it in the earth. Slit up my stomach, and having

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

done this, lay yourself and your children within it." Saying these words
the magic horse breathed his last.

The Princess now cut off his head and stuck it in the ground, then
opened his stomach and laid herself and her children in it. Here they
fell fast asleep. When she awoke she saw that she was in a beautiful
palace; one finer than either her father's or her husband's. She was
lying in a lovely bed, and hardly had she risen when slaves appeared
with water: one bathed her, others clothed her. The twins lay in a
golden cradle, and nurses stood around them, soothing them with sweet
songs. At dinnertime, gold and silver dishes appeared laden with
delicious food. It was like a dream; but days and weeks passed away,
weeks passed into months, and the months into a year, and still the
dream--if dream it was--did not come to an end.

EANWHILE the war was over and the Prince hastened home. Seeing nothing
of his wife he asked his father what had become of her and her children.
The Padishah was astonished at this strange question. The letters were
produced, and the Tartar messenger was sent for. Being closely
questioned he related the account of his meeting with the Dew on both
occasions. They now realized that the Dew had tampered with the
messenger and the correspondence. There was no more thought of peace for
the Prince until he had discovered his wife. With that intention he set
out in the company of his lala.

They wandered on and on unceasingly. Six months had passed already, yet
they-continued their way-over hill and down dale, never stopping to
rest. One day they reached the foot of a mountain, whence they could see
the palace of the Moon-horse. The Prince was entirely exhausted and said
to his lala: "Go to that palace and beg a crust of bread and a little
water, that we may-continue our journey.

When he reached the palace gate, the lala was met by two little
children, who invited him in to rest. Entering, he found the floor of
the apartment so beautiful that he hardly dared set his foot upon it.
But the children

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

pulled him to the divan and made him sit down while food and drink were
set before him. The lala excused himself, saying that outside waited his
tired son, to whom he wished to take the refreshment.

"Father Dervish," said the children, "eat first yourself, then you can
take food to your son." So the lala ate, drank coffee, and smoked, and
while he was preparing to return to the Prince, the children went to
tell their mother about their guest.

Looking out of the window, the Princess recognised the Prince her
husband. She took food with her own hands, and putting it in golden
vessels sent it out by the lala. On receiving it the Prince was struck
with the richness of the service. He lifted the cover of one of the
dishes, set it on the ground, and it rolled back to the palace of its
own accord. The same happened with the other dishes, and when the last
had disappeared, a slave came to invite the stranger to take coffee in
the palace.

While this was happening the Princess gave each of her children a wooden
horse, and sent them to the gate to receive the guests. "When the
dervish comes with his son," said their mother, "take them to such and
such an apartment." The dervish and his son came up, the

<span id="img_14800"></span> ![The two children on their wooden horses
greeted them](img/14800.jpg.md)

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

two children on their wooden horses greeted them with a salaam and
escorted them to their apartments. Again the Princess took dishes of
food and said to the children: "Take these to our guests and press them
to eat. If they say they have already had sufficient and ask you to
partake of the food, answer that you also are satisfied, but perhaps
your horses are hungry, and put them to the table. They will then
probably ask, how can wooden horses eat? And you must reply" (here she
whispered something into the children's ears).

The children did as their mother had commanded them. The food was so
delicious that the guests tried to eat a second time, but becoming
satisfied very soon, they asked: "Will you not eat also, children?" "We
cannot eat," answered the children, "but perhaps our horses are hungry,"
so saying they drew them up to the table. "Children," remonstrated the
Prince, "wooden horses cannot eat." "That you seem to know," answered
the children, "but apparently you do not know that it is impossible for
little dogs to become human children such as we are." The Prince sprang
up with a cry of joy, kissed and embraced both his children. His wife
entering at the moment, he humbly begged her pardon for the suffering
she had experienced. They related to each other all that had befallen
them during the time of their separation, and their joy knew no bounds.
Now the Princess and her children prepared to accompany the Prince back
to his own kingdom. After they had gone some distance, they turned to
take a farewell look at the palace, and lo! the wind swept over the
place as though no building had ever been there.

The Dew was lurking on the wayside, but the Prince caught him and killed
him, and after that they arrived home without further adventure. Soon
afterwards the old Padishah died, and the Prince became chief of the
land.

Three apples have fallen from the sky. One belongs to the storyteller,
the second to the listener, the third to me.
