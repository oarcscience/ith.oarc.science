HERE was once a Padishah who had a son of incomparable beauty. Whoever
saw him was struck with the handsome young Prince, and his father could
hardly endure to be away from his son for a single half-hour.

Unhappily, however, the Padishah was taken ill and died, in spite of the
attention of the most skilful physicians and learned hodjas of the
kingdom. Bitter lamentations ascended from the whole serai, but they
availed nothing. A stately mausoleum was built and the remains of the
late ruler laid to rest within; then the Shahzada, who was in his
twenty-fifth year, ascended the throne.

Years passed away, and being one day somewhat indisposed he resolved to
seek change of air by making a tour with his lala. Not overburdening
themselves with luggage, they mounted their horses, halting not until
they had accomplished a day's journey. They continued their onward
course until they reached a spring in the midst of a wide plain. The
bubbling water was partly hidden by trees; the meadows around them were
covered by sweet-smelling flowers. It was like a smiling garden, and the
ice-cold water of the spring was refreshing and reviving. When the
Padishah, who since his father's death had grieved continually, saw
this, he said to his lala: "I am charmed with this place; let us sit
down that I may lave my feet in this cooling stream and afterwards
rest." The lala was encouraged to hope that the loveliness of this spot
would assuage his master's grief. They sat down, drank coffee, and
lighted their chibouques. Throughout the evening they heard the songs of
nightingales, and so agreeable was the spot that they found it hard to
leave it. "I must stop here some days longer," said the young Padishah,
"for surely this delightful place is without compare in all the world."
The lala agreed that it was indeed delightful, yet as it was in the
desert they could not well remain there at night. "Then for the present
we will remain tonight only," said the Padishah; "but in a few days we
will come here again."

After they had been sitting some time, the Shah arose and walked to and
fro. "Inshallah," he said, "I will have a kiosk built here, where I may
pass my summers." While speaking, they saw in the distance an old man
approaching with a jug in his hand. Presently he came up and filled his
jug at the spring. The Padishah's curiosity being excited he exclaimed:
"O father, who are you and whence do you come?" The old man answered:
"At half an hour's distance is a kiosk belonging to a maiden called
'Little Hyacinth.' This spring also is hers. She comes here every year
to spend three days. Forty Dews guard her. How did you dare to come
here? I advise you to depart quickly before you are observed, or you
will be put to death."

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

Though alarmed, the Padishah was also curious, and asked the old man who
this maiden was to live in such a place, guarded by forty Dews. The old
man smiled, and repeated his warning. "I am sorry for you," he said,
"but you must hasten away from this neighbourhood." The Shah, however,
would not give in. The old man observed the remarkable beauty of the
youth. Surely there could not be a handsomer man in the world? He was as
beautiful as their Hyacinth as like as one half. apple is to its
corresponding half. Therefore he now said: "young man, at one hour's
distance, behind a high mountain, dwells the mother of the Dews that
guard the maiden. Go there and seek her protection, and ask her how you
may see Hyacinth."

The Shah determined to follow the advice of the old man, and set off
with his lala. In due time they crossed the mountain, and there saw a
sight that might cause the stoutest heart to quail. A Dew woman, tall as
a minaret, sat in the valley, one leg upon the mountain and the other
stretched out before her. She chewed a piece

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

of resin as large as a house, and the sound made thereby could be heard
two miles off. When she breathed she caused a whirlwind which blew up
sand and earth; and her arms were eight yards long. The two men were so
frightened and bewildered that they were hardly able to greet her as
"Mother," and embrace her as they had been instructed. They managed the
feat, however, and the old woman answered: "I should have crushed you
like flies if you had not embraced me and called me Mother. Who sent you
here?" Trembling from head to foot the Prince replied: "O Mother, at a
well we met an old man, one of the servants of Little Hyacinth, who
warned us to come to you if we would escape death. O Mother, how looks
Little Hyacinth? Since first I heard her name I have had no peace, and I
must see her."

"Little Hyacinth is of wonderful beauty," answered the woman. "Her equal
does not exist on earth. Many have attempted to see her, but none have
succeeded, though nearly all of them have died for her. I have forty
sons who guard her kiosk by day and by night. They never allow so much
as a bird to approach her. Put the idea out of your mind; otherwise you
will die, and that would be a pity."

Nevertheless the Shah implored: "Deign to help us, Mother, and I will
repay you." He begged so long and so humbly that the Dew-woman softened
at length, and changing the lala into a broom and the Padishah into a
tobacco-box, which she put in her belt, she set forth and in three
strides was at the kiosk. She now took from her pocket a handful of
sand, strewed it about the floor, and said to the transformed Shah:
"Fear nothing. At present the Dews are all asleep. Go straight to the
chamber wherein the maiden lies sleeping. Do nothing more, however, than
take the ring from her finger and bring it to me." The Padishah took
courage and entered the chamber where the maiden was sleeping. What a
sight met his gaze! The choicest words could not accurately describe the
maiden. Her arms glistened like turquoises, and as she lay in bed she
looked truly like a houri from Paradise. His

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

eyes were dazzled by the sight of her, and he almost lost his presence
of mind. However, remembering the words of the Dew-mother, he drew the
ring from her finger and hastened back to the giantess. She picked him
up, and in three strides they were back at her house, where she changed
him into a jug and set him beside her. Waking from sleep next morning
the maiden observed that her ring was missing from her finger. "Where
can I have put it? she mused. "Perhaps it has fallen down somewhere."
She searched the kiosk, but in vain she sought it in the garden, equally
in vain. Then she called the Dews and questioned them, but they did not
know. The maiden was angry and scolded them; so they went in forty
different directions to seek the missing ring, but failed to find it.
After, wards they went to their mother and asked her whether

she knew anything about it; but their mother answered them: "Have you
lost your wits? Can anyone enter the kiosk so long as we are here? Who
knows? Probably the frivolous girl has dropped it somewhere." And she
sent her sons away.

<span id="img_ninit"></span>

EXT evening the Shah begged the Dew-mother to let him see the maiden
once more. The woman took him again to the kiosk, strewed sand as
before, and said: "Now go to the maiden, but beware of doing anything
save what I tell you. Take one of her earrings and come back quickly."
The Shah, going straight to the maiden's chamber, took one of the rings
out of her ear, and, though he found it hard to leave her, he ran
quickly back to the Dew-woman. Changing him again into a jug, the woman
went home and set it on the floor.

When she awoke next morning, Hyacinth observed that now one of her
earrings was missing, Very angry at this second outrage, she sent for
the old man, who, though he well knew what had happened, answered: "My
daughter, no bird flies over here, no caravan passes, no snake crawls
here. That you have been robbed is impossible; perchance the rings fell
in the grass when you were walking. I will seek, and if I find either or
both I will bring them to you."

With such words he attempted to calm the maiden. She was not so easily
satisfied, however, and said: "Those are mere words. It is certain that
some one has entered my chamber and stolen my jewellery." She then made
the Dews understand that if anything further happened to her she would
know what to do. Throughout the day she was exceedingly angry.

At the Shah's earnest supplication the Dew-mother took him again to the
kiosk, but forbade him to do more than kiss both cheeks of the maiden
and return quickly to her. Full of joy, the youth entered the chamber.
But the maiden, owing to her excitement, could not sleep and was gazing
round her. As soon as her eyes lit on the handsome youth she was
overcome with rapture. He, however, thinking she slept, kissed her

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

cheeks, and was about to depart when she clasped him in her arms,
saying: "Darling of my heart, how came you here? Fear not; I am yours. I
have now found that which I have long sought." The Shah could hardly
believe his good fortune, and overcome by the maiden's loveliness, he
swooned away. She brought him to consciousness with rose-water, and they
talked with one another until daybreak.

Then said the maiden: "Henceforth I am yours and you are mine. I will
never part from you although I cannot leave this place. If you love me,
remain here." The Padishah replied: "O my Sultana, I am a king. When
travelling one day I saw a spring in this neighbourhood and resolved to
build a summer residence near it." Then he told her all his adventures.
"If that is the case," said the maiden, "let us go to your capital city
for our marriage and afterwards divide our time between your country and
mine." Calling the Dews, they all went together to the Dew-mother, and
the maiden said: "O Mother, we have found each other, and we go hence.
May Allah bless and protect you"

The Dew-woman replied: "Go safe and sound; but send me forty sheep daily
or you will not prosper." "We owe you so much," said the Padishah, "
that I will gladly send the forty sheep daily, and your sons shall
continue to guard this place."

Thus they departed, and in due time arrived in the Padishah's capital.
The whole serai turned out to welcome them home. The Grand Vezir was
summoned, and the betrothal took place. Then followed forty days and
forty nights of revelry and rejoicing, and on the forty-first their
union was solemnized.

They lived together in perfect harmony and bliss to the end of their
long lives, partly in the Padishah's realm and partly in Hyacinth's
kiosk; and never once did they forget the daily toll of forty sheep to
the Dew-mother.
