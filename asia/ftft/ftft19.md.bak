HERE was once a Padishah who had forty sons, and they spent the whole
day in the forest, hunting and snaring birds.<span

When the youngest had completed his fourteenth year their father thought
it was time they were getting married, so he called them together and
spoke to them about the matter, "We are willing to marry," said the
forty brothers, "but only if we can meet with forty sisters all having
the same father and mother." The Padishah therefore sought throughout
his dominions for such a family, but in vain: the greatest number of
sisters in all the land was thirty-nine. "The fortieth will have to take
another," said the Padishah to his sons. But they refused to agree to
that, and begged their father to allow them to travel in

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

foreign countries to seek the desired brides. What was the Padishah to
do? As he could not dissuade them, he grudgingly granted their request.
Before they set out, however, the Padishah said to them: "There are
three things which you must bear well in mind. When you reach a large
spring, do not spend the night anywhere near it. Farther on is a hân; do
not spend the night there, either. Beyond the hân is a great plain; do
not linger there a moment." The sons, promising to remember their
father's advice, mounted their steeds and rode away.

Smoking and talking, they wended their forward course, and as evening
drew on they came to the spring.

"Now we take not a single step farther," observed the eldest. "We are
fatigued and it is night. Besides, what have forty men to fear?"

So they alighted, ate their supper, and lay down to rest. The youngest,
the fourteen-year-old brother, kept watch, however. Towards midnight he
heard a rustling sound. Cautiously he drew his weapon, and as the sound
came nearer he saw a seven-headed dragon. Both beast and youth rushed to
attack one another. Three times the dragon wrestled with the youth, but
could obtain no advantage over him.

"Now it is my turn," cried the Prince, and with these words he struck
the dragon such a powerful blow that six heads fell from his body.

<span id="img_13400"></span> ![One of his heads began to

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

"Strike once more," gasped the dragon. "Not I," returned the youth. The
dragon sank to the earth, and behold! one of his heads began to roll,
and it rolled and rolled till it reached a well. "Let him who has taken
my life, take also my treasure," said the head as it fell down the well.

The youth now took a rope, bound one end to a rock, and with it let
himself down the well. At the bottom he found an iron gate. Opening it
and entering, he saw a palace even more beautiful than that of his
father. In the palace were forty apartments, and in each apartment sat a
maiden at an embroidery table, near which immense treasures were piled
up.

"Are you a man or a jin?" asked the terror-stricken maidens.
"[I](errata.htm#2.md) am a human being," answered the Prince. "I killed the
seven-headed dragon and came to this place by following one of his
rolling heads." Now the forty maidens rejoiced. They all embraced him
and begged him to remain with them. Incidentally they informed him that
they were forty sisters whom the dragon had stolen. He had killed their
parents, and now they had not a single friend or relation in the wide
world.

"We are forty brothers," said the Prince, "and seek forty maidens." Then
he told them he must ascend to his brothers, but that soon he would come
again to fetch them away. He came up from the well and went to the
spring, where he lay down and fell asleep.

Early next morning when the forty brothers awoke, they began to laugh at
their father's attempt to frighten them about the spring. They set off
again and continued their way until evening, when behold! the hân their
father had mentioned stood before them. "We go no farther tonight " said
the elder Princes. The youngest, however, expressed the opinion that it
might be well to follow their father's advice, but the others would not
listen to him. They ate their supper, said their prayers, and lay down,
but the youngest kept watch as before.

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

Towards midnight he again heard a noise. With his drawn sword in hand,
the young Prince found himself confronting another seven-headed dragon,
larger and more frightful than the one he had slain the day before. The
dragon straightway attacked the youth, but without effect; then the
youth fell on the dragon so furiously that six of his seven heads fell.
The monster begged for another blow as a coup de grâce, but the Prince
declined. As on the previous occasion one of the heads rolled into a
well. The youth followed it and discovered a larger palace and greater
treasures. Noting the place, he returned to his brothers, lay down, and
fell asleep so soundly after the fatigues of his combat that his
brothers had to rouse him next morning.

Mounting their horses again they pursued their journey up hill and down
dale until by sunset they had reached a great plain. They ate and drank,
and were just going to lie down when suddenly an awful shriek was heard
and the mountains seemed to quake. Terror seized every one as they
caught sight of a gigantic seven-headed dragon, spitting fire and
roaring: "Who has killed my two brothers? Bring him to me that I may
slay him!"

The youngest saw plainly that all his brothers were paralysed with fear
and unable to do anything. He delivered to them the keys of both wells,
telling them to take home the forty maidens and the treasure. He
promised that when he had killed the dragon he would follow them. The
thirty-nine sprang on their horses and rode away.

Now we will return to the youngest.

The conflict between the Prince and the dragon was a stern one, and they
fought a long time without either overcoming the other. When the dragon
realized that the struggle was in vain he said to the Prince: "If you
will go to the land of Chinimatchin and bring me the Padishah's
daughter, I will spare your life." The Prince consented to the
condition, for he was too exhausted to continue the combat any longer.

Champalak--as the dragon was called--gave the Prince a bridle and

<span id="img_13600"></span>

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

instructed him as follows: "Every day a magic horse, Ajgyr, grazes here:
Catch him, put this bridle on him, and command him to take you to the
land of Chinimatchin." <span id="img_13700"></span>

|------------------------------------------------|
| ![She called him to the window](img/13700.jpg.md) |

So the youth took the bridle and waited for the magic horse. The
golden-hued steed came flying through the air, and no sooner was the
bridle laid upon him than he said: "Command me, little Sultan! Shut your
eyes--open your eyes!" and behold there was the youngest Prince in the
far-off land of Chinimatchin! He alighted from the horse, took off the
bridle, and walked into the city.

Entering an old woman's hut, he asked whether she could find him
lodgings. "Willingly," answered the old woman. She offered him a seat,
and prepared some coffee. While he was drinking he made inquiries as to
the condition of the country.

"A seven-headed dragon," said the old woman, "has fallen violently in
love with our Sultan's daughter. For years there has been war on her
account and we cannot get rid of the monster." "And the Sultan's
daughter?" questioned the Prince. "She inhabits a kiosk in the
Padishah's garden," answered the old woman, "and away from it she dares
not stir a step."

Next day the Prince went to the Padishah's garden and asked the gardener
to take him into his service. He begged so earnestly

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

<span id="img_13800"></span>

|                                                                         |

| ![''What happiness that you have come'' said the dragon](img/13800.jpg.md) |

that at length the man took pity upon him. "you have no other duty but
to water the flowers," said the gardener. The Sultan's daughter saw the
young man, and she called him to the window, asking him how he came to
be in that land. The young man told her that his father was a Padishah,
and then he described his fight with Champalak, and how he had promised
to bring him the Sultan's daughter. "But fear not," continued the
Prince, "my love is much greater than that of the dragon, and if you
will come with me, I know how to destroy him."

The maiden had herself fallen in love with the handsome Prince, and
moreover wished to escape from her constant imprisonment. Her trust in
the Prince was so great that one night they left the kiosk together in
secret and repaired to Champalak's plain. On the way they discussed what
the maiden might do to discover the dragon's talisman, for through that
talisman the Prince meant to destroy the monster.

We may imagine Champalak's joy when he saw the Sultan's daughter before
him. "What happiness that you have come! What happiness that you have
come!" he repeated again and again, as he caressed the Princess, who was
weeping all the time. Days and weeks elapsed, but

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

<span id="img_13900"></span> ![The Magic Horse flew after the
dove](img/13900.jpg.md)

the Princess never dried her tears. "If you would at least tell me what
your talisman is," she said one day to the dragon, "perhaps my days
would not be quite so wearisome." "My darling," replied the dragon, "it
is guarded in a place impossible of access. In a certain country there
is a large palace and whoever gets into it never gets out again." This
was all the Prince needed to know. He took his bridle, threw it in the
sea, and the golden-hued steed appeared.

"What is your command, little Sultan?"

"To the palace of the dragon's talisman!"

"Shut your eyes--open your eyes!" and there he was at the palace. As the
Prince dismounted, the magic horse said to him:

"Fasten my bridle to the iron rings at the palace gate. When I neigh
once, knock the rings together and the gate will open. The gate is a
lion's jaw, and if you can cut it asunder with a single blow of your
sword, you are safe. Otherwise your last hour has come."

Accordingly the Prince fastened the magic horse to the rings, and when
it neighed the gate opened. The Prince struck the gaping jaws of the
lion a stout blow and split the creature asunder. This done he cut open
its stomach, and took therefrom a cage containing three doves, so
beautiful that their equals had never been seen before. Taking one in
his hand he stroked its

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

plumage, caressed it, and p-r-rr! it suddenly flew away. If the magic
horse had not quickly flown after it, caught it, and wrung its neck, the
Prince would never have met his ladylove again.

Now he remounted his magic horse. "Shut your eyes--open your eyes!" and
he found himself once more at Champalak's palace. At the gate the youth
killed the other two doves, and as he went in the dragon fell an inert
mass to the floor. Seeing the dead doves in the Prince's hand he
implored him to let him stroke them once more before he died. The youth,
seized with pity, was about to offer the birds to the dragon when the
Sultan's daughter ran in and tore them away. Upon this the dragon
perished miserably. "Fortunate it was for you," said the magic horse,
"that you did not give him the birds; new life for him was in their
touch." As there was no further use for it, the bridle now disappeared,
and with it the magic horse.

The Prince and the Sultan's daughter gathered together all the Dragon's
treasures and bore them to the land of Chinimatchin.

The Padishah had become quite ill through worrying about the
disappearance of his daughter. Search had been made for her throughout
the length and breadth of his dominions, but as she could not be found
the Padishah had come to the conclusion that she had fallen into the
power of the dragon. When the Princess appeared again safe and sound, he
gladly gave her in marriage to the Prince, and the wedding was
celebrated with great rejoicings. After the honeymoon they set out, with
a brilliant retinue of soldiers, for the palace of the Prince's father.
The Prince was thought to have died long ago, and his claim to be indeed
the Prince would hardly have been accepted, had he not related the story
of the three dragons and the forty sisters. His thirty-nine brothers
married thirty-nine of the sisters, the fortieth becoming the wife of
the Princess of Chinimatchin's brother, and henceforth they all lived in
the greatest happiness.
