### AVT’HANDIL'S DISCOURSE WITH SHERMADIN WHEN HE STOLE AWAY

<span class="margnote"><span id="755">755</span></span>The sun-faced,
dispenser of light, speaks to Shermadin and says: "This day is hope, the
comforter of my heart, that thou wilt show what thou canst do for me."
It needs a reader and a listener for the praise of this story of them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="756">756</span></span>He says: "Rosten
did not grant me leave, he hearkened not even to a word from me; he
knows not wherein one's being lies and how one's life is in another.
Without him (Tariel) in truth I live not, neither abroad nor at home.
What unrighteous deed has God ever forgiven to anyone?

<span class="margnote"><span id="757">757</span></span>"Though I
resolved not to forsake him, and my decision is final--every liar and
traitor insults God and thus lies--the heart seeing not him weeps and
sighs, moans

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

and groans, it comes not near to any joy, it shudders, grows sullen,
cries clack! and alas!

<span class="margnote"><span id="758">758</span></span>"Three are the
ways of showing friendship by a friend: First, the wish for nearness,
impatience of distance; then giving and not grudging, unweariedness in
liberality; and attention and aid, roaming in the fields td help him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="759">759</span></span>"But why should I
lengthen speech; it is time to shorten it. Now to steal away is the
healing of this bruised heart. Hearken to what I shall entreat so long
as thou hast time in my company, and fortify thyself in observance of
what I have already taught thee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="760">760</span></span>"Now prepare as
first leader to serve the sovereigns, manifest thy valour and integrity
in all things. Take care of my household, command my troops, repeat anew
the service, the attention thou hast hitherto shown.

<span class="margnote"><span id="761">761</span></span>"Keep my foes out
of the marches, let not thy might fail in aught, grudge no good to the
loyal, may they that are false-hearted towards thee be slain; if I
return, well shall thy due be repaid to thee by me; service to a master
is never lost."

<span class="margnote"><span id="762">762</span></span>When he heard
this, the hot tear flowed from Shermadin's eyes. Quoth he: "Wherefore
should I be affrighted by sorrow in loneliness! But what shall I do
without thee--twilight will fall on my heart! Take me with thee to serve
thee; I will help thee however thou wishest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="763">763</span></span>"Who has heard of
so great wandering by one alone! Who has heard of a knight holding back
from his lord in trouble! Thinking thee lost, what shall I, useless, do
here?" The knight answered: "I cannot take thee, however many tears thou
sheddest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="764">764</span></span>"How can I
disbelieve thy love for me! But the thing cannot be; thus Fate has taken
up arms against me. To whom can I entrust my house; save thee, who is
fit?

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Calm thy heart,
believe me, I cannot take thee! I cannot! I cannot!

<span class="margnote"><span id="765">765</span></span>"Since I am a
lover I must run mad alone in the fields. Should not one with
blood-stained tears roam alone! Errantry is the business of lovers; how
can one wait till he is grown old? This world is such, be thou assured
thereof and submit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="766">766</span></span>"When I am far
from thee, think of me, love me. I fear not my foes; I shall take care
of myself. A brave man must be of good cheer, he must not mope in grief;
I hate when a man hesitates at no shameful deed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="767">767</span></span>"I am such an one
as will not gather cucumbers in this world as an old man, one to whom
death for a friend seems a sport and a play. I have left my sun, she
grants me leave, why should I linger! Then, if I can bear to go from
mine own home, whose can I not bear (to leave)?

<span class="margnote"><span id="768">768</span></span>"Now I give thee
my testament addressed to Rosten. I will confide thee to him, and
entreat him to care for thee as befits one brought up by me. Should I
die, slay not thyself; do not the deed of Satan; weep thereupon, fill
the channel <span id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md) of the eyes."
