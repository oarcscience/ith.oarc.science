### XXXII

### THE LETTER OF LOVE WRITTEN BY P’HATMAN TO AVT’HANDIL

<span class="margnote"><span id="1063">1063</span></span>"O sun, since
it pleased God to create thee a sun, thus a joy and not a desirer of
woes to them removed from thee, a burner of those near united, a
consumer of them with fire, thy glance seems sweet to the planets, a
thing to be boasted of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1064">1064</span></span>"They that gaze
on thee become enamoured of thee; for thy sake piteously they faint.
Thou art the rose I marvel why nightingales quiver not on thee. Thy
beauty withers the flowers, and mine too are fading. If the sunbeams
reach me not timely I am quite scorched.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1065">1065</span></span>"God is my
witness that I fear to tell you this, but, luckless, what can I do for
myself? I am quite parted from patience; the heart cannot constantly
endure the piercing of the black lashes! If by any means thou canst help
me, then help, lest I lose my wits.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1066">1066</span></span>"Till an answer
to this letter reaches me, till I know if thou wilt slay me or reassure
me--till then shall I endure life, however much my heart pains me. Oh
for the time when life or death will be decided for me!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="1067">1067</span></span>Dame P’hatman
wrote and sent the letter to the knight. The knight read it as if it
were from a sister or kinswoman; he said: "She knows not my heart. Who
is she who courts the lover of her whose I am? The beloved I have--how
can I compare her (beauty) to this one's?"

<span class="margnote"><span id="1068">1068</span></span>Said he: "What
hath the raven to do with the

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

rose, or what have they in common? But upon it the nightingale has not
yet sweetly sung. Every unfitting deed is brief, and then it is
fruitless. What says she? What nonsense she talks! What a letter she has
written!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="1069">1069</span></span>This kind of
thought he thought in his heart. Then said he to himself: "Save thee I
have no helper. For the sake of that for which I am a wanderer, since I
wish to seek her (Nestan) I will do everything by which I can find her;
what else should my heart heed!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1070">1070</span></span>"This woman
sits here seeing many men, a keeper of open house and a friend to
travellers coming hither from all parts. I will consent, she will tell
me all; however much the fire burns me with its flames, perchance she
will be of some use to me; I shall know how to pay my debt to her."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1071">1071</span></span>He said: "When
a woman loves anyone, becomes intimate with him and gives him her heart,
shame and dishonour she weighs not, being wholly accursed; whatever she
knows she declares, she tells every secret. It is better for me, I will
consent; perchance I shall somewhere find out the hidden thing."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1072">1072</span></span>Again he said:
"None can do aught if his planet favour him not; so what I want I have
not, what I have I want not. The world is a kind of twilight, so here
all is dusky. Whatever is in the pitcher, the same flows forth."
