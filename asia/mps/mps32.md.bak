### THE STORY OF AVT’HANDIL'S ARRIVAL IN GULANSHARO

<span class="margnote"><span id="1039">1039</span></span>Avt’handil
crossed the sea; with stately form went he. They saw a city engirt by a
thicket of garden, with wondrous kinds of flowers of many and many a
hue. In

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

what way canst thou understand the loveliness of that land!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1040">1040</span></span>With three
ropes they moored the ship to the shore of those gardens. Avt’handil
clad his form in a cloak and sat on a bench. They brought out men that
were porters, provided with drachmas. That knight bargains, acts as
chief (of the caravan), and thereby conceals himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1041">1041</span></span>Thither came
the gardener of him at whose garden they had landed; with ecstasy he
gazes at the knight's face flashing like lightning. Avt’handil hailed
him, he spoke to the man with faultless words: "Whose men are ye, who
are ye? how call they the king reigning here?

<span class="margnote"><span id="1042">1042</span></span>"Tell me all in
detail," quoth the knight to that man; "what stuff is dearer, or what is
bought up cheap?" He said: "I see, thy face seems to me like the face of
the sun. Whatever I know I will tell thee truly; I will by no means
inform thee crookedly.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1043">1043</span></span>"The Sea Realm
is this, ten months’ (travel) in extent, this is the city of
Gulansharo <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md), full of much loveliness.
Hither everything fair cometh by ships sailing from sea to sea. Melik
Surkhavi rules, perfect in good fortune and wealth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1044">1044</span></span>"Even if he be
old, a man is rejuvenated by coming hither; drinking, rejoicing, tilting
and songs are unceasing; summer and winter alike we have many-hued
flowers; whoever knoweth us envieth us, even they who are our foes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1045">1045</span></span>"Great
merchants can find nought more profitable than this: They buy, they
sell, they gain, they lose; a poor man will be enriched in a month; from
all quarters they gather merchandise; the penniless by the end of the
year have money laid by.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1046">1046</span></span>"I am gardener
to Usen, chief of the merchants. I shall tell thee somewhat of the
manner of his ordinance:

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This is his
garden, your resting-place for the day; first it is necessary to show
him all the fairest of your goods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1047">1047</span></span>"When great
merchants arrive they see him and give him gifts, they show him what
they have, elsewhere they cannot unpack their goods; for the king they
set aside the best, they straightway count out the price; thereupon he
frees them to sell as they please.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1048">1048</span></span>"His duty it is
to receive such honourable folk as you, he orders the caterers how to
entertain them fitly; he is not now here, what avails it me to speak of
him To meet you and carry you away with him, pressing you politely, is
the way he should treat you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1049">1049</span></span>"P’hatman
Khat’hun, the lady, his wife, is at home, a hospitable hostess, amiable,
not rough. I shall inform her of your arrival, she will take you in as
one of her own folk, she will send a man to meet you, you shall enter
the city by daylight."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1050">1050</span></span>Avt’handil
said: "Go, do whatever thou desirest." The gardener runs, he rejoices,
sweat pours down to his breast. He tells his tidings to the lady: "I
boast of this: a youth comes, to them that look on him his rays seem
like the sun.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1051">1051</span></span>"He is some
merchant, chief of a great caravan, well-grown like a cypress, a moon of
seven days, his coat and the fold of his coral-hued turban become him;
he called me, asked me tidings and the tariff for the purchase of
goods."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1052">1052</span></span>Dame P’hatman
rejoiced; she sent ten slaves to meet him; they prepared the
caravanserais, she stored their wares. The rose-cheeked, crystal and
ruby, glass, jet, entered; they who looked on him compared his feet to
the panther's, his palms to the lion's (paws).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1053">1053</span></span>There was a
hubbub, the hosts of the town all

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

assembled; they pressed on this side and on that, saying: "We will gaze
on him till sleeptime." Some were carried away by desire, some had their
souls reft from them; their wives grew weary of them, their husbands
were left contemned.
