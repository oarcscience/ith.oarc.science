### XXI

### THE TESTAMENT OF AVT’HANDIL TO KING ROSTEVAN WHEN HE STOLE AWAY

<span class="margnote"><span id="769">769</span></span>He sat down to
write the will, thus piteously inditing: "O king! I have stolen away in
quest of him I must seek. I cannot remain sundered from him, the

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

kindler of my fires. Forgive me and be merciful to me like as God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="770">770</span></span>"I know that in
the end thou wilt not blame this my resolve. A wise man cannot abandon
his beloved friend. I venture to remind thee of the teaching of a
certain discourse made by Plato: 'Falsehood, and two-facedness injure
the body and then the soul.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="771">771</span></span>"Since lying is
the source of all misfortunes, why should I abandon my friend, a
-brother by a stronger tie than born brotherhood? I will not do it! What
avails me the knowledge of the philosophizing of the philosophers!
Therefore are we taught that we may be united with the choir of the
heavenly hosts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="772">772</span></span>"Thou hast read
how the apostles write of love, how they speak of it, how they praise
it; know thou it and harmonize thy knowledge: 'love exalteth us,' this
is as it were the tinkling burden of their song: if thou conceive not
this how can I convince ignorant men?

<span class="margnote"><span id="773">773</span></span>"He who created
me, even He gave me power to overcome foes; He who is the invisible
Might, the Aid of every earthly being, who fixes the bounds of the
finite, sits immortal God as God, He can in one moment change a hundred
into one and one into a hundred.

<span class="margnote"><span id="774">774</span></span>"What God wills
not will not become fact. The violet fades, the rose withers, if they
cannot gaze on the sunbeams; every lovely thing is desirable for the eye
to gaze on. How can I endure the lack of him, or how can life please me!

<span class="margnote"><span id="775">775</span></span>"However angry
thou art, forgive me that I have not kept your command; enthralled, I
had no power to fulfil it. No! to go was the remedy for the flaming of

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

my furnaces. Wherever I may be, what matters it to me if I have but my
freewill?

<span class="margnote"><span id="776">776</span></span>"Sadness avails
thee not, nor useless flow of tears. The deed which is inevitably
decreed above cannot be avoided. It is a law with men that they should
struggle and suffer woes, and no creature of flesh hath power to thwart
Providence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="777">777</span></span>Whatever God has
predestined to come to pass upon me let it be fulfilled, and when I
return my heart will no longer remain ashes. May I see you also joyful
in majesty and manifold wealth. What I can do for him is my glory, and
this is sufficient booty for me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="778">778</span></span>"O king, this is
my decision. Slay me! if anyone can disapprove! O king, can it be that
my going grieves thee! I cannot be false, I cannot do a cowardly deed;
he would shame me when we meet face to face in that eternity whereto we
both shall come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="779">779</span></span>"Mindfulness of a
friend ne’er doeth us harm. I despise the man who is shameless, false
and treacherous. I cannot be false; I cannot do it for a mighty king.
What is worse than a hesitant, tardy-going man!

<span class="margnote"><span id="780">780</span></span>"What is worse
than a man in the fight with a frowning face, shirking, affrighted and
thinking of death! In what is a cowardly man better than a woman weaving
a web! It is better to get glory than all goods!

<span class="margnote"><span id="781">781</span></span>"A narrow road
cannot keep back Death, nor a rocky one; by him all are levelled, weak
and strong-hearted; in the end the earth unites in one place youth and
greybeard. Better a glorious death than shameful life!

<span class="margnote"><span id="782">782</span></span>"And now I fear,
O king, to make this request to

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

you: mistaken, mistaken is he who expects not death momentarily; it
which unites us all comes alike by day and by night. If I see thee not
living, life will be fleeting for me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="783">783</span></span>"If Fate, the
destroyer of all, destroy me, an orphan I shall die travelling,
unmourned by parent, nor will those who brought me up, nor the friend
whom I trust, enshroud me; then indeed will your merciful, tender heart
have pity on me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="784">784</span></span>"I have countless
possessions weighed by none: Give the treasure to the poor, free the
slaves; enrich every orphan without means; they will be grateful to me,
remember me, bless me; I shall be thought of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="785">785</span></span>"Whatever is not
worthy of being kept in your treasury, give part to build orphan homes,
part to build bridges; be not sparing in the spending of mine estate for
me; I have none save thee to quench the hot fires. <span
id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="786">786</span></span>"Henceforth thou
shalt learn no more news from me, herewith I commit my soul to thee;
this letter tells thee so, without flattering thee; the devil's deeds
shall not seduce (my soul), it will prevail; forgive me and pray for me;
what can be exacted from me dead?

<span class="margnote"><span id="787">787</span></span>"I entreat thee,
O king, for Shermadin my chosen servant. This year he hath an added day
of grief. Comfort him with the favour I was wont to favour him withal;
make not the tears to flow from his eyes welling with blood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="788">788</span></span>"My testament is
ended, written by mine own hand. Behold, mine upbringer, I have parted
from thee; I am gone away with maddened heart. Let not the

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

sovereigns be grieved for my sake, be ye not clad in gloom, but be ye in
your sovereignty feared by foes."

<span class="margnote"><span id="789">789</span></span>When he had made
an end of writing he gave the will to Shermadin. He said: "Convey this
to the king discreetly; none can excel thee in any service." He embraced
him and wept over him bloody-hued tears.
