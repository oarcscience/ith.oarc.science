### XLVI

### TARIEL GOES AGAIN TO THE CAVE AND SEES THE TREASURE

<span class="margnote"><span id="1468">1468</span></span>This hidden
thing Divnos the sage reveals: "God sends good, He creates no evil, He
shortens the bad to a moment, He renews (? repeats) the good
continuously (? for a long time), His perfect self He makes more
perfect, He degrades not Himself."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1469">1469</span></span>Those lions,
those suns, set out from P’hridon's (country). They lead with them the
sun-faced, the maiden, the amazing to beholders; the raven's tail (of
her hair), ordered, hangs coiled by the crystal (of her brow or cheek);
beauty, tenderness, there adorned the (fine) ruby.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1470">1470</span></span>That sun sat in
a palanquin, and thus they made her fare. They followed the chase; there
caused they blood to flow. Wherever they came upon a land they were

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

the joy of beholders, they went forth to meet them, gave gifts,
eulogized, reviled them not.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1471">1471</span></span>It was as if
the sun sat in the firmament amid moons. Many days they journeyed,
merry, sagely discoursing, within those great plains on all sides
unattained of men. They reached the neighbourhood of that rock where
Tariel had been.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1472">1472</span></span>Tariel said:
"It is seemly that I should be your host this day. Thither will I go
where I was while madness afflicted me. There will Asmat’h entertain us;
she hath (store of) smoked meat. When I give you fair gifts you shall
praise the variety of the treasure."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1473">1473</span></span>They went in;
they dismounted in that cave of the great rocks. Asmat’h had venison;
she carves it for the guests. They were merry, they joked at the passing
of those deeds; they thanked God that He had turned their. days of woe
to joy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1474">1474</span></span>They explored
the hollow hill, merry they played; they found those treasures sealed up
by Taria, uncounted by any, apprehended by none; they say not with
dissatisfied hearts: "We lack!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="1475">1475</span></span>He gave many
fair gifts, to each what was fitting; then he enriched P’hridon's
people, army and generals alike; every man was enriched, (all) those who
came with them, but there lay so much treasure it seemed still untouched
by man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1476">1476</span></span>He said to
P’hridon: "Hard will it be for me to pay the debt I owe thee; but it is
said: 'A man who is a doer of good loseth not in the end.' Now the
treasure, as much as lieth here or is to be found, let it all be thine,
take it away, as it belongs to thee." so

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1477">1477</span></span>P’hridon humbly
did homage, he expressed exceeding gratitude: "O king, why thinkest thou
me stupid and thus mazed? Every enemy seems to thee as straw, however
much he may be like a thick cudgel. My joy lasts but so long as I shall
be a gazer on thee."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1478">1478</span></span>P’hridon made
men go back to bring camels to take away all this treasure to his home.
Now they set out thence on the road leading to Arabia. Avt’handil is a
minished moon (by longing) to be united with the sun (T’hinat’hin).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1479">1479</span></span>When many days
were passed they reached the boundaries of Arabia; they saw villages,
castles, frequent, uninterrupted; those dwelling therein had clothed
their forms in blue and green, all are bathed in tears for Avt’handil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1480">1480</span></span>Tariel sent a
man to the presence of King Rosten to say: "I venture, O king, to
approach thee full of desire; I, King of the Indians, come to your royal
court; I will show thee the rosebud, unfaded, unplucked.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1481">1481</span></span>"Formerly my
sight of thy ground made you angry; thou didst ill in attempting to
capture me, to urge thy horse against me; I showed thine armies some
sign of anger, I massacred many slaves, servants of your palace.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1482">1482</span></span>"Now therefore
I come before you, I have gone out of my way; you will pardon me that in
which I sinned against thee, let thy wrath be sufficient. We have no
offerings, as P’hridon and his knights can testify; the only gift I have
brought you is your Avt’handil."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1483">1483</span></span>Tongue cannot
shortly tell how they rejoiced when the messenger of these good tidings
came to the king; the brilliancy of three rays was added to
T’hinat’hin's cheeks, the shadow of eyebrows and lashes makes fairer the
crystal and ruby.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1484">1484</span></span>They beat the
kettledrums and peals of joyous

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

laughter were heard, the soldiers ran hither and thither, they desired
to run to meet them, they began to lead out the horses and to bring out
saddles, a multitude of knights, swift-armed, stout-hearted, mounted.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1485">1485</span></span>The king
mounted, the princes and the armies entire go to meet them; whoever
hears, others from divers parts come to his presence; all give thanks to
God, they raise their voices, they say: "Evil hath no existence; good
things (or, the good) are ever ready for thee!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="1486">1486</span></span>When they met
and the meeters perceived each other, Avt’handil said with tender words
to Tariel: "Behold, seest thou the dust-dyed plains? Therefore a furnace
consumes me, my heart is fevered and sad.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1487">1487</span></span>"There is my
foster-father; he is come to meet you. I cannot go thither, I am
ashamed, a furnace consumes my heart; living man hath never been shamed
as I am. What you intend to do for me you know, also P’hridon who is
beside you."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1488">1488</span></span>Tariel said:
"Thou dost well to show respect to thy lord. Now stay, come not thither,
stay alone without me. I will go; I will tell the king of thy hiding.
With God's help I think I shall soon unite thee to that sun with the
figure of an aloe."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1489">1489</span></span>The lion
Avt’handil tarried there; a little tent was put up. Nestan-Daredjan also
stayed there, the amazer of beholders; the zephyr of her eyelashes is
wafted like a north-east wind. The King of the Indians departed,
straight, not secretly.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1490">1490</span></span>P’hridon went
with him; of a truth they were a long time crossing the field. The king
knew (of their coming). Tariel went forward alone, his figure swayed; he
dismounted and did homage to the bold one strong as a lion; he does
honour to the King of the Indians as a father.

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1491">1491</span></span>Tariel also did
homage; he goes to kiss, to greet. The king kissed his neck to give
pleasure to his lips; in wonder he speaks, in order to embolden him:
"Thou art the sun; separation from thee turns day into night."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1492">1492</span></span>The king
marvelled at his beauty and good looks, he gazes with wonder on his
face, he praises the hardihood of his arms. Then P’hridon also greeted
him; he did homage to the king, to the king eager for the sight of
Avt’handil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1493">1493</span></span>The king
shrinks from praising Taria, and is discouraged. Tariel says: "O king,
hereby is my heart subjected to thee; I marvel how you can think thus of
my worth; since Avt’handil is thine, how can any other please thee!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1494">1494</span></span>"Dost thou not
wonder at not seeing him, and at his tarrying! Come and let us sit down,
O king, pleasant is this meadow of verdure; I will venture to tell you
the reason why I could not bring him before you; I have a favour to ask
of you, now I must beg leave of you."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1495">1495</span></span>The kings sat
down; the multitude of the host stood round. A smile brighter than a
lamps flits over Tariel's face; the sight maddens the beholders of his
bearing and gestures. He began to relate to the king a speech wisely
chosen:

<span class="margnote"><span id="1496">1496</span></span>"O king, I hold
myself unworthy to mention this, but I am come before you to entreat, to
beg; he himself beseeches who seems a sun-like shedder of rays, he who
is my light and enlightener.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1497">1497</span></span>"Now we both
venture to approach thee with prayer and entreaty. Avt’handil gave me
balm befitting him; he forgot that woes quite equal to ours afflicted

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

him. I will not weary thee; a long story is beyond our powers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1498">1498</span></span>"Your
(children) love each other, the maid loves him and he the maid;
therefore I think on him pitiful, tearful and wan, on bended knee I
entreat thee, let them no longer be consumed by flame, but give your
daughter to the strong-armed, stout-hearted one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1499">1499</span></span>"No more than
this will I ask of thee, neither short nor long." He drew forth his
handkerchief, tied it round his neck, rose up, bent his knee, besought
him like a (pupil) before a teacher. It astonished all men who heard
this story.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1500">1500</span></span>When he saw
Tariel on his bended knees, the king was dismayed; he went back a long
way, he did homage, he fell down to the earth. He said: "O monarch, all
my joy is blown away from me; this abasement of you thus has saddened
for me the sight of you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1501">1501</span></span>"How could it
be that man should not grant thee whatever thou desirest, or that I
should grudge my daughter if thou didst wish (to devote her) to death or
slavery even! If you had even ordered it from your home, not even then
would my tears flow; none other can she find like him if she fly up even
to heaven!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1502">1502</span></span>"I could not
find a better son-in-law than Avt’handil. Myself I have given the realm
to my daughter, she has it and it befits her; the rose blooms anew, my
flower is blown. What objection can I make? Only let him be satisfied!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1503">1503</span></span>"If thou wert
to marry her to some slave, even then I would not grudge her to thee.
Who could refuse thee, how could any save a madman quarrel with thee! If
I loved not Avt’handil, why did I thus yearn for him? Verily, O God, I
am in Thy presence, this is confirmed by me."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1504">1504</span></span>When Tariel
heard this speech from the king, he

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

bowed himself, humbly did homage, fell on his face. Then the king did
homage to him, he came forward, he stood before him. They thanked each
other, nor were they at all annoyed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1505">1505</span></span>P’hridon
mounted, he galloped as herald of good tidings to Avt’handil--indeed, he
also rejoiced at this great joy--he went and took him, led him and
accompanied him; but he is abashed before the king, darkly he shed (his)
beam.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1506">1506</span></span>The king arose,
met him; the knight dismounted when (the king) came; in his hands he had
a handkerchief, therewith he hid his face. The sun was concealed by a
cloud, it grew gloomy, the rose was chilled; but how could anything hide
his beauty!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1507">1507</span></span>The king would
have kissed him, tears no longer flow, Avt’handil embraced his feet, the
ray streams down; (the king) said: "Arise, be not ashamed, thou has
revealed thy prowess; since thou art loyal to me, be not ashamed; why
shouldst thou be ashamed before me?"

<span class="margnote"><span id="1508">1508</span></span>He embraced
him, he kissed him all over his face; he said: "Thou hast quenched my
hot fire, though tardily hast thou appeared to me as water; to her who
has herded in the jet and the vicinity (?realm) of the eyelashes
to-morrow I shall unite thee, O lion, with the sun, come quickly to
her."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1509">1509</span></span>The king
embraced the neck of that lion and hero-like one, he seats him close, he
speaks to him, kisses him, gazes on his face. That sun so met royalty,
as he was worthy of it. Then is joy pleasant, when a man hath passed
through grief.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1510">1510</span></span>The knight says
to the king: "I marvel that thou speakest of something else, why thou
desirest not to see the sun, or why thou delayest! Meet her gaily,
conduct her

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

to your house; be clothed in her rays, set them around as a light."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1511">1511</span></span>He told Tariel
also; they mounted and went to meet the lady. The cheeks of those three
Goliaths were dyed to sun colour (*i.e.*, shone like the sun); they met
what they desired, they found what they sought; they had handled their
swords, not girded them idly on their loins.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1512">1512</span></span>Dismounting
afar off, the king greeted the lady, the lightning flashing from her
cheeks blinded his eyes; she met him, sitting in the palanquin she
kissed him. The king began a eulogy; he was wholly bereft of his wits.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1513">1513</span></span>He said: "O
sun, how shall I praise thee, O light, and maker of good weather! For
thy sake understandings are mad, and not for nought. O sun-like and
moon-like, to what planet do they liken thee! No longer do I wish to
look on you, O ye roses and violets!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="1514">1514</span></span>All they that
saw her marvelled at the shedding of her rays. Like a sun she blinded
the eyes of the onlookers by the sight of her light; burned by her they
found the comfort of their hearts in gazing; wheresoever she appeared
crowds came running towards her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1515">1515</span></span>They mounted,
they all went homewards, they have the seven planets to compare with
that sun; her beauty is incomprehensible, it is beyond their
understanding. Soon they came to the place of the king's dwelling-house.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1516">1516</span></span>They came in,
they saw T’hinat’hin, the bestower of woe on them that look on her; the
wearing of the purple? beautified the sceptre and crowns bearer; the
radiance of

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

her face rested on the faces of the new-comers. The King of the Indians
entered, that hero-like sun.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1517">1517</span></span>Tariel and his
wife humbly saluted the maid, they met, kissed and held pleasant
converse, they illumined that house (hall), they made not the light to
fade; they turned crystal and ruby into cheeks, jet into eyelashes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1518">1518</span></span>T’hinat’hin
invited them up to the lofty royal throne. Tariel said: "Sit thou; it is
desired by the Supreme Judge; this day more than all days thy throne
befits thee, I seat the lion of lions beside thee the sun of suns."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1519">1519</span></span>Both (? Tariel
and Rostevan) took him by the hand and set him on her throne; they
placed Avt’handil by the side of her for desire of whom he was slain;
she is better than the seen and the unseen, (better) than all sights.
Think not any were like them in love, not even Ramin and Vis.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1520">1520</span></span>The maiden was
bashful and astonished to have Avt’handil seated by her side; her colour
paled and her heart shot forth a tremor from within. The king said:
"Child, why art thou so bashful before me? the sages say that love in
its end will not fail.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1521">1521</span></span>"Now, children,
God grant you a thousand years’ length of life, happiness, prosperity,
glory, and, moreover, freedoms from ills; may heaven not make you
fickle, may it fall to your lot to be steadfast like it, may my fate be
to have the earth heaped over me by your hands."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1522">1522</span></span>Then the king
commanded the armies to do homage to Avt’handil: "This is your king,"
quoth he, "such was God's will. This day he hath my throne, I

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

have old age like an infection. Serve him as well as you have served me,
keep my command."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1523">1523</span></span>The soldiers
and the magnates bent, humbly they did homage; they said: "Let us be as
the earth to them that dispose of our lives; them who magnify those of
us who are obedient, who liken the disobedient unto corpses, who make
the arms of foes to fail (and) encourage our hearts!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="1524">1524</span></span>Tariel too
spoke with a eulogy the glorification of hope; he said to the maiden:
"You are united, no longer the heat of fires burns thee, thy husband is
my brother, I desire too that you be my sister, I will bring to nought
those who are false and opposed to thee."
