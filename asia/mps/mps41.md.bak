### XXXVIII

### THE LETTER WRITTEN BY NESTAN-DAREDJAN TO P’HATMAN

<span class="margnote"><span id="1262">1262</span></span>"I, the
sun-faced, write: O dame, O mother, better than a mother to me! See what
the world (Fate) hath done to me its thrall! Alas! there is added to
those griefs of mine still another! Now that I have seen thy missive it
hath greatly encouraged me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1263">1263</span></span>"Thou didst
save me from two sorcerers; thou didst alleviate my woes. Now I am thus
held here by the whole force of the Kadjis; a whole realm, many thousand
heroes, guard me alone. Ill befell my counsels and resolves (to flee
from P’hatman).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1264">1264</span></span>"What other
tidings hence can I write to thee? The king (*i.e.*, queen) of the
Kadjis is not come, nor will the Kadjis yet come; but countless hosts
guard me, and with what bravery! (?) What! the quest for me! It is not
possible, believe me!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1265">1265</span></span>"Whoever is
come seeking me is wearied in vain he suffers, he is consumed, he is
kindled for me, a flame like fire burns him. But I envy him, he hath
seen the sun, thus is he not frozen. Without him, alas! what great pity
my life is

<span class="margnote"><span id="1266">1266</span></span>"Formerly I
told thee not my story, I hid it from thee for that my tongue could not
speak it; I spared myself woes. I entreat thee, beg my beloved to have
pity and not come in search of me, write to him, send him a message.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1267">1267</span></span>"What afflicts
me is enough, let him not slay me with (a woe) equal to this: I should
see him a corpse, I should die a double death. None can help me, I know
this for a truth; this is no gossip. If he (Tariel) will

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

not hearken to thee, stone me with a heap of black stone!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1268">1268</span></span>"Thou didst ask
me to send a token, show this: I send a cutting from the veils he gave
me; these (veils) for his sake are a fair sight to me, though in colour
they are black, like my fate."
