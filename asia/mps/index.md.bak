Georgia is a central Asian region which is situated in the mountains
between the Black and Caspian seas. This, the 'Man in the Panther Skin'
(also known as 'the Knight in the Panther Skin') is a 12th century
medieval epic poem. It is considered one of the masterpieces of Georgian
literature, and has been called the Georgian national epic. The author,
Prince Shota Rustaveli, was a noble in the court of Queen Tamar, and
served as her treasurer. He was also a painter who created frescoes in
the Georgian monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem. We do not know
specific birth and death dates for Rustaveli. The poem was first printed
in 1712 in Tblisi. This translation is, thankfully, into clearly written
prose, unlike some of the awful 19th century attempts to versify
translated poetry. Wardrop's translation, which she modestly called an
attempt, makes enjoyable reading.

The poem, strangely enough, is not set in Georgia, but in fictionalized
versions of Arabia, Persia, India and fairy-tale lands set in the
environs of the Indian Ocean. (However the characters are at one point
described as speaking fluent Georgian!) There are two chief male
protagonists, Avt'handil and Tariel. Tariel, the eponymous 'Knight in
the Panther's Skin' is made heir to all India, but tragically falls in
love with his adoptive sister, Nestan. Driven mad by this love, he ends
up killing the man she is to marry and fleeing India. Nestan is also
spirited away to parts unknown. The search for Nestan, described as
radiant as the sun, so beautiful that everyone she meets falls in love
with her, is the central thread of the story. Avt'handil, the suitor of
the Queen of Arabia T'hinat'hin, sees Tariel wandering disconsolate one
day and goes in quest of this mysterious knight. Eventually they meet up
and after a long quest end up finding Nestan. Nestan and Tariel marry,
and Avt'handil marries T'hinat'hin. I have appended a short [synopis of
the story](synopsis.md) to this etext, based on my reading notes.

The narrative and characterizations are remarkable for a work of this
period. Rustaveli had great psychological insight, providing backstory
and motivations for his cast. The women characters are well written and
memorable (particularly the merchant P'hatman). Rustaveli's female
characters are not just props as in some of the medieval romances.
Emotional relationships between characters of the same sex (both male
and female), like the Biblical David and Jonathan, are portrayed as
tender and sensual, shedding light on how our conventional sex roles are
modern cultural constructs.

For technical reasons, I had to omit most of the footnotes from the body
of the text. However, I did type in some of these footnotes by hand
where they clear up obscure passages. Since a facsimile of this
particular translation is in print and the footnotes are mostly of
interest to scholars, this should not present a problem.
