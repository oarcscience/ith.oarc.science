### THE STORY OF THE CAPTURE OF NESTAN-DAREDJAN BY THE KADJIS, TOLD BY P’HATMAN TO AVT’HANDIL

<span class="margnote"><span id="1191">1191</span></span>Woe, O Fate, in
falsehood thou art like Satan, none can know aught of thine, where thy
treachery is. That face apparent as a sun--where hast thou it hidden?
Whither hast thou taken it? Therefore I see that in the end all seems
vain (desolate), wherever anything may be.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1192">1192</span></span>P’hatman said:
"The sun was departed from me, the light of all the world, life and
existence, the gain of my hands; from that time unceasingly the burning
of hot fires.

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

afflicted me, I could not dry the spring of tears flowing forth from
mine eyes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1193">1193</span></span>"House and
child became hateful to me, I sat with cheerless heart; waking I thought
of her, when I fell asleep (I thought of her) in my drowsiness. The
oath-breaker Usen seems to me of the infidels in faith; the accursed one
cannot approach me, to be near me with his cursed face.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1194">1194</span></span>"One day at
eventide, just at sunset, I passed the guards, the door of the asylum
caught mine eye; I was in a reverie, sadness at the thought of her was
slaying me; I said: 'Cursed is the vow of every man!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1195">1195</span></span>"From somewhere
there came a wandering slave with three companions, the slave clad as a
slave, the others in coarse travelling garb; they brought food and drink
which they had bought in the city for a *drama*. They drank, they ate,
they chattered, thus they sat merry.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1196">1196</span></span>"I hearkened to
them, I watched them. They said: 'Pleasantly we rejoiced, but (though)
here we are joined as comrades, (yet) are we strangers, none of us knows
who another is or whence we are come; we must at least tell one another
our stories with our tongues.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1197">1197</span></span>"Those others
told their tales as is the wont of wayfarers. The slave said: 'O
brothers, providence is a celestial thing; I harvest for you pearls, you
sowed but millet; my story is better than your stories:

<span class="margnote"><span id="1198">1198</span></span>"'I am the
slave of the exalted king, the ruler of the Kadjis. It chanced that he
was struck by a sickness which prevailed over him; the helper of the
widow, the comforter of the orphan, was dead to us; now his sister,
better than a parent, rears his children.

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1199">1199</span></span>"'Dulardukht is
a woman, but a rock, like a cliff, her slave is wounded by none, but he
wounds others. She had little nephews: Rosan and Rodia; now she is
seated as sovereign of Kadjet’hi, "the Mighty" is she called.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1200">1200</span></span>"'We heard news
of the death overseas of her sister. The viziers were distressed, they
refrained from assembling a privy council: "How can we venture to report
the extinction of a face which was the light of the lands?"--Roshak is a
slave, the chief of many thousand slaves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1201">1201</span></span>"'Roshak said:
"Even if I be killed (for mine absence), I shall not be at the mourning!
I go into the plain, I will reive, I will fill myself with booty; I
shall come home enriched, I shall be back in good time. When the
sovereigns goes forth to bewail her sister, I too will accompany her."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1202">1202</span></span>"'He said to
us, his underlings: "I will go, come with me!" He took of us a hundred
slaves, all chosen by him. By day in the sunlight we reived, by night
also we watched; many a caravan we broke up, we unloaded the treasure
for ourselves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1203">1203</span></span>"'One very dark
night we were wandering over the plains; there appeared to us certain
great lights in the midst of the field; we said: "Is it the sun strayed
down from heaven to earth!" Perplexed, we gave our minds to torturing
thought.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1204">1204</span></span>"'Some said:
"It is the dawn!" others said: "It is the moon!" We, drawn up in
fighting array, moved towards it--I saw it from very near--we made a
wide circuit round it, we came and surrounded it. From that light came a
voice speaking to us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1205">1205</span></span>"'It said to
us: "Who are you, O cavaliers? tell

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

me your names! From Gulansharo I go, a messenger to Kadjet’hi; have a
care of me." When we heard this we approached, we formed a circle round
about. A certain sun-faced rider appeared before our eyes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1206">1206</span></span>"'We gazed at
the brilliant face flashing out lightning, its glittering spread itself
over the surroundings like the sun; rarely she spoke to us with some
gentle discourse, (then) from her teeth the ray lighted up her jetty
lashes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1207">1207</span></span>"'Again we
addressed that sun with sweet-discoursing tongue; she was not a slave,
she spoke falsely, this we perceived. Roshak discovered that it was a
damsel; he rode by her side; we did not let her go, we made bold to keep
her in our hands.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1208">1208</span></span>"'Again we
asked: "Tell us the true story of that sun-like light of thine. Whose
art thou, who art thou, whence comest thou, enlightener of darkness?"
She told us nought; she shed a stream of hot tears. How pitiable is the
full moon swallowed by the serpent!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1209">1209</span></span>"'Neither plain
tale nor secret, she told us nought, neither who she was, nor by whom
she had been treacherously treated; angrily she spoke with us, sullen,
on the defensive, like an asp attacking onlookers with her eye.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1210">1210</span></span>"'Roshak
ordered us: "Ask not, it seems nought is to be said now; her business is
a strange one and difficult to be told. The good fortune of our
sovereign is to be desired by creatures, for God giveth her whatever is
most marvellous.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1211">1211</span></span>"'"This
(damsel) has been destined to us by God that we might bring her; we will
take her as a gift, she (Dulardukht) will render us very great thanks;
if we conceal it, we shall be found out, (and) our sovereign is.

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

proud: first, it is an offence to her, then it is a great disgrace."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1212">1212</span></span>"'We agreed, we
prolonged not the discussion. We returned, we made for Kadjet’hi,
leading her with us; we ventured not to speak directly to her, nor did
we annoy her. She weeps; with embittered heart she laves her cheeks in
flowing tears.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1213">1213</span></span>"'I said to
Roshak: "Give me leave; soon again shall I attend you. At present I have
some business in the city of Gulansharo." He granted me leave. Hereabout
I have some stuff to be carried off, I will take it with me, I will go
and overtake them.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1214">1214</span></span>"This story of
the slave greatly pleased those men. I heard it; the stream from the
pool of tears dried up in me. I guessed, I recognized every sign of (her
who is my) life this gave me a little comfort, like a *drama's* weight.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1215">1215</span></span>"I laid hold of
that slave and set him close before me. I asked him: 'Tell me what thou
wert saying; I, too, wish to hear.' He told me again the same as I had
heard thence (*i.e.*, from my hiding-place). This story enlivened me;
me, struggling in soul (with death), it preserved alive.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1216">1216</span></span>"I had two
black slaves full of sorcery, by their art they go and come invisible; I
brought them out, I despatched them to Kadjet’hi, I said: 'Tarry not;
give me tidings of her by your deeds.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1217">1217</span></span>"In three days
they came and told me, swiftly had they trod the road: 'The queen, who
was ready to go over the sea, has taken her. None can fix his eyes to
gaze upon her, as upon the sun. She (the queen) has betrothed? her
(Nestan) as wife to the little boy Rosan.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1218">1218</span></span>"'"We shall wed
her to Rosan," this is the decree of Queen Dulardukht, "at present I
have not leisure for the wedding, now is my heart consumed with fire;
when I

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

return home I will make a daughter-in-law of her who is praised as
heaven's sun." She has set her in the castle; one eunuch attends her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1219">1219</span></span>"'She
(Dulardukht) took with her all those skilled in sorcery, for perilous is
the road, her foes are ready for the fray; she has left at home all her
bravest knights. She will tarry; but little time has already passed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1220">1220</span></span>"'The city of
the Kadjis has hitherto been unassailable by foes; within the city is a
strong rock, high and long; inside that rock is hollowed out a passage
for climbing up. Alone there is that star, the consumer of those who
come in touch with her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1221">1221</span></span>"At the gate of
the passage are continually on guard knights not ill-favoured, there
stand ten thousand heroes all of the household, at each of the three
city gates three thousand.' O heart, the world hath condemned thee; I
know not, alas! what binds thee."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1222">1222</span></span>When Avt’handil
the sun-faced but woeful (?) heard these tidings he was pleased, he
showed nothing else. The lovely creature rendered thanks to God:
"Somebody's sister has told me joyful news!" (?)

<span class="margnote"><span id="1223">1223</span></span>He said to
P’hatman: "Beloved, thou art worthy to be loved by me, thou hast let me
hear a welcome story, not with louring looks; but let me hear more fully
about Kadjet’hi <span id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_33.md); every Kadj is
fleshless, how can it become human?

<span class="margnote"><span id="1224">1224</span></span>"Pity for that
maiden kindles me and burns me with flame; but I marvel what the
fleshless Kadjis can do with a woman!" P’hatman said: "Harken to me!
Truly I see thee here perplexed (? timorous). They are not

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Kadjis, but men
(who) put their trust in steep rocks," quoth she.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1225">1225</span></span>"Their name is
called Kadji because they are banded together, men skilled in sorcery,
exceeding cunning in the art, harmers of all men, themselves unable to
be harmed by any; they that go out to join battle with them come back
blinded and shamed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1226">1226</span></span>"They do
something wondrous, they blind the eyes of their foes, they raise
fearful winds, they make the ship to founder midst the seas, they run as
on dry land, (for) they clean dry up the water; if they wish they make
the day dark, if they wish they enlighten the darkness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1227">1227</span></span>"For this
reason all those that dwell round about call them Kadjis, though they,
too, are men fleshly like us." Avt’handil thanked her: "Thou hast
extinguished my hot flames; the tidings just told me have pleased me
greatly."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1228">1228</span></span>Avt’handil,
shedding tears, magnifies God with his heart; he said: "O God, I thank
Thee, for Thou art the Comforter of my woes, who wast and art,
Unspeakable, Unheard by ears: Your mercy is suddenly spread forth over
us!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="1229">1229</span></span>For the
knowledge of this story he magnified God with tears. P’hatman thought of
herself; therefore she was again burned up. The knight kept his secret,
he lent himself to love; P’hatman embraced his neck, she kissed his
sun-like face.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1230">1230</span></span>That night
P’hatman enjoyed lying with Avt’handil; the knight unwillingly embraces
her neck with his crystal neck; remembrance of T’hinat’hin slays him, he
quakes with secret fear, his maddened heart raced away to the wild
beasts and ran with them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1231">1231</span></span>Avt’handil
secretly rains tears, they flow to mingle with the sea; in an inky eddy
floats a jetty ship. <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_34.md) He

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

says: "Behold me, O lovers, me who have a rose for mine own! Away from
her, I, the nightingale, like a carrion-crow, sit on the dungheap!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="1232">1232</span></span>The tears which
flowed there from him would have melted a stone, the thicket of jet
dammed them up there is a pool on the rose-field. P’hatman rejoiced in
him as if she were a nightingale; if a crow find a rose it think itself
a nightingale.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1233">1233</span></span>Day dawned; the
sun (Avt’handil) whose rays were soiled by the world went forth to
bathe. The woman gave him many coats, cloaks, turbans, many kinds of
perfumes, fair clean shirts. "Whatsoever thou desirest," said she, "put
on; be not shy of me!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="1234">1234</span></span>Avt’handil
said: "This day will I declare mine affair." The wearing of merchant
garb had hitherto been his resolve. That day wholly in knightly raiment
he apparelled his brave form; he increased his beauty, the lion
resembled the sun.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1235">1235</span></span>P’hatman
prepared a meal, to which she invited Avt’handil. The knight came in
adorned, gaily, not with louring looks. P’hatman looked, she was
astonished that he was not in merchant garb; she smiled at him: "Thus is
it better for the pleasure of them that are mad for thee."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1236">1236</span></span>P’hatman
exceedingly admired his beauty. He made no answer, he smiled to himself:
"It seems she does not recognize me!" How foolishly he behaved, how he
invited (her)! Though he took some liberty he did not go farther.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1237">1237</span></span>When they had
eaten they separated, the knight went home; having drunk wine, he lay
down merry, pleasantly he fell asleep. At eventide he awoke; he shed his
rays across the fields. He invited P’hatman: "Come, see me, I am alone,
quite alone!"

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1238">1238</span></span>P’hatman went,
Avt’handil heard her voice making moan; she said: "Undoubtedly I am
slain by him whose form is like an aloe-tree." He set her at his side;
he gave her a pillow from his carpet. The shade from the eaves of the
eyelashes overshadows the rose-garden (of the cheeks).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1239">1239</span></span>Avt’handil
said: "O P’hatman, I know thee; thou wilt tremble at these tidings like
one bitten by a serpent; but hitherto thou hast not heard the truth
concerning me: my slayers are black lashes, trees of jet.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1240">1240</span></span>"Thou thinkest
me some merchant, master of a caravan; I am the Commander-in-Chief of
the exalted king Rostevan, chief of the great host befitting him; I have
the mastery over many treasuries and arsenals.--

<span class="margnote"><span id="1241">1241</span></span>"I know thee to
be a good friend, faithful, trusty.--He has one daughter, a sun the
enlightener of lands; she it is who consumes me and melts me; she sent
me, I forsook my master, her father.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1242">1242</span></span>"That damsel
thou hadst--to seek that same damsel, that substitute for the sun, I
have gone over the whole world; I have seen him who roves for her sake,
where he, pale lion, lies wasting himself, his heart and strength."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1243">1243</span></span>Avt’handil told
all his own tale to P’hatman, the story of the donning of the panther
hide by Tariel. He said: "Thou art the balm of him thou hast not yet
seen, the resource of (him of) frequent eyelash, ruffled like a raven's
wing.

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1244">1244</span></span>"Come,
P’hatman, and aid me, let us try to be of use to him, let us help them,
perchance those stars shall receive joy. All men who shall know it, all
will begin to praise us. Surely again will it befall the lovers to meet.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1245">1245</span></span>"Bring me that
same sorcerer slave, I will send him to Kadjet’hi, we will make known to
the maiden all the tidings known to us, she also will inform us of the
truth, we will do what she chooses. God grant you may hear that the
kingdom of the Kadjis is vanquished by us."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1246">1246</span></span>P’hatman said:
"Glory to God, what things have befallen me! This day I have heard
tidings equal to immortality!" She brought the sorcerer slave, black as
a raven, and said: "I send thee to Kadjet’hi; go, thou hast a long
journey.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1247">1247</span></span>"Now will
appear advantage for me from thy witchcraft, speedily quench the furnace
of the burning of my fires, tell that sun the means for her cure." He
said: "To-morrow I shall give you full news of what you wish."
