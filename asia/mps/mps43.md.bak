### AVT’HANDIL'S LETTER TO P’HRIDON

<span class="margnote"><span id="1294">1294</span></span>He wrote:
"Exalted P’hridon, supremely blest, king of kings, lion-like in
stout-heartedness, O sun, recklessly shedding rays, mighty, joyous,
spiller of the blood of foes--thy youngest brother from far, far away
barks thee a greeting.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1295">1295</span></span>"I have seen
troubles, and I have, too, received recompense for what pains I have
suffered. Well hath fallen out the matter planned by me: I have truly
learned the story of that face likened to a sun, the sustainer of that
lion who was buried under the earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1296">1296</span></span>"The sovereign
of the Kadjis has that sun; she is captive in Kadjet’hi. To go thither
seems to me sport,

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

though the road is one of battle. From the narcissi a rain of crystal
falls; the rose is wet with rain. The Kadjis are not yet with the maid,
but countless is their host.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1297">1297</span></span>"Glad in heart
I rejoice, for this my tear will not flow in channels. Wherever thou and
thy brother (Tariel) are the difficult will be made easy; whatever you
may desire you will certainly do it, you shall not fail; not only no man
can stand against you, I trow that even a rock will soften before you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1298">1298</span></span>"Now pardon me,
I cannot see thee, so I have passed afar off; I have no leisure to
linger on the road, for that moon is captive. Soon shall we come merry;
rejoice at the sight of us! What more than this can I say to thee: help
thy brother in brotherly fashion?

<span class="margnote"><span id="1299">1299</span></span>"The attachment
of these slaves is beyond reward; pleasantly have they served me, and
your heart, too, will be pleased at this. Why should he be praised who
hath sojourned long with you? Every like gives birth to like; this is a
saying of the sages."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1300">1300</span></span>He wrote this
letter, he tied it up and rolled its; the rose, the violet-haired, gave
it to P’hridon's slaves; he communicated through them by word of mouth
all that was needful, how he should do; the open door of coral showed
its pearls to them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1301">1301</span></span>Avt’handil
searched; he found a ship of that region (where Tariel was). That sun
with the face of a full moon prepared to set out; but to leave the
woeful-hearted P’hatman was a heaviness to him; those who parted from
him shed a rivulet of blood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1302">1302</span></span>P’hatman, Usen
and the slaves weep with hot tears. They said: "O sun, what hast thou
done to us? Thou didst burn us with hot fires, why darkenest thou us

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

with the gloom of thine absence? Bury us with thy hands which have
(already) buried us! (*i.e.*, by thy departure)."
