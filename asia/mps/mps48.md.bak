### XLV

### THE WEDDING OF TARIEL AND NESTAN BY P’HRIDON

<span class="margnote"><span id="1439">1439</span></span>He placed for
the maid and the youth a throne white and coral-hued, prettily sprinkled
with red and yellow gems; for Avt’handil one of mingled yellow and
black; they came, they sat down. The spectators, I ween, were impatient
for them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1440">1440</span></span>The minstrels
came forth; the sound of sweet singing was heard. They made the wedding;
the presentation of soft silk stuffs was multiplied by P’hridon, the
good entertainer, not an abashed host. A smile, a tooth-glimpse,
beautifies Nestan-Daredjan.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1441">1441</span></span>They brought
out incomparable gifts from the wealthy P’hridon: nine pearls in size
like a goose's egg; also one gem like to the sun with augmented ray;
before it at night a painter could have painted a picture.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1442">1442</span></span>Likewise he
presented to each a necklace to throw over the neck, of gems cut into
spheres, of whole jacinths. He also brought a tray scarcely to be held
in the hand, a gift for the lion Avt’handil from the generous P’hridon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1443">1443</span></span>That tray is
full of plump pearls; he gave all to Avt’handil, with not unseemly
words. The house was filled with brocade and soft cloth of gold; Tariel
the proud gave thanks with sweet words.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1444">1444</span></span>For eight days
P’hridon made measureless wedding festivities, every day they offer
priceless presents prepared; day and night lute and harp ceased not to
sound. Behold a youth and a maiden worthy each of other have attained
each other.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1445">1445</span></span>Tariel one day
spake to P’hridon words of the

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

heart: "Your heart is more mine than that of a complete (*i.e.*, born)
brother; my life would not be a fitting return, nor the gift of my soul;
dying I found from you the balm for my wound.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1446">1446</span></span>"Thou knowest
of Avt’handil's self-sacrifice for my sake; now I would serve him in
return; go, ask, he will reveal what he wants; as he hath quenched my
furnace, even so hath his burned enough.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1447">1447</span></span>"Say to him: 'O
brother, what will repay thee for the grief thou hast seen for my sake?
God will grant thee His grace imaged forth from on high. If I cannot do
something desirable for thee, contrived for thy sake, I will not see my
house, nor hall, not hut.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1448">1448</span></span>"'Now tell me
what thou wishest of me, or in what I can help thee. I choose that we go
to Arabia; be thou my guide. Let us bring to reason the sweet with
words, the warlike with swords. If thou be not united to thy wife I will
be no husband to mine.'"

<span class="margnote"><span id="1449">1449</span></span>When P’hridon
told Avt’handil Taria's message, he laughed, he smiled, mirth beautified
him. He said: "Why want I a helper? I am not hurt by a wound from any.
The Kadjis possess not my sun, nor doth lack of joy afflict her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1450">1450</span></span>"My sun sits
upon a throne, powerful by the will of God, respected and honoured,
proud, harmed by none, she is by no means oppressed by Kadjis, nor by
the sorcery of wizards. Why should I want help with regard to her?
Expect me not to speak flattering words.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1451">1451</span></span>"When
Providence shall come for me, heavenly beings from above, (if) God
wills, shall visit my heart, consolations for the furnace; then indeed
the radiances of the flashing of the sun will be my lot (when I am)
dying; till that time be come, vain are my runnings to and fro.

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1452">1452</span></span>"Go and report
to Tariel the answer spoken by me: 'What thanks are needed, O king,
however great is thy compassion; even from my mother's womb am I born to
be your servant, and, by God, let me be but earth till thou be
recognized as king.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1453">1453</span></span>"Thou hast
said: 'I desire thy union to thy beloved!' This is like your
compassionate heart. There my sword cuts not, nor breadth of tongue. It
is better for me to await the deed of yon celestial Providence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1454">1454</span></span>"This is my
wish and my desire, that I may see thee powerful in India, enthroned
upon the thrones, the heavenly light (Nestan), too, sitting by thy side,
the face flashing lightning; that your foes be exterminated, that no
adversary appear there.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1455">1455</span></span>"When these the
desires of my heart have been fulfilled to me, then indeed shall I go to
Arabia, it will befall me to be near that sun; when she wills she shall
quench the burnings of this fire for me. Nought else do I wish from you;
I hate all kinds of flattery."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1456">1456</span></span>When P’hridon
reported to Tariel these words of the knight, he said: "That will I not
do; for that it needs no wizard. As he found the cause of the existence
of my life (Nestan), even so he too shall see the valour of a brother
(used) in his favour.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1457">1457</span></span>"Go, speak on
my behalf words not of adulation: I will not remain without seeing thy
foster-father. I suspect I slew many servants beloved by him. I will
only beg forgiveness, and so I shall return.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1458">1458</span></span>"Speak thus:
'Send me no more messages. Tomorrow I shall not fail to set out; I shall
have no more of the word "if"; the King of the Arabs will not make my
words to be of no avail; pleasantly shall I beg his daughter, I shall
entreat of him, I shall persuade him."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1459">1459</span></span>P’hridon told
Avt’handil Taria's message: "He

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

will not stay," quoth he; "vain is it for thee to speak of waiting!" It
oppressed him; again the smoke and glow burned his heart. Thus respect
is due to kings, devotion from knights.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1460">1460</span></span>Avt’handil went
to beseech Taria on bonded knee; he embraces his feet, he kisses them,
he no longer looks up to his waist. He says: "What I have sinned against
Rosten this year is enough; make me not again to be a breaker, a
shatterer of loyalty.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1461">1461</span></span>"What thou
desirest God's justice will not give thee. How can I dare do a
treacherous deed to my foster-father, how can I undertake aught against
him who for my sake is become pale, how can the servant use his sword
upon his master!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1462">1462</span></span>"Such a deed
will make discord between me and my beloved. Woe is me if she become
angry, displeased, if wrath compel her heart! (Then) will she even stint
me of tidings, and make me languish for a sight of her. No man of flesh
can exact forgiveness for me."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1463">1463</span></span>Tariel, that
radiant sun, spake laughing. He took Avt’handil's hand, raised him, set
him on his feet: "Thy help hath done me every good, but it is better
that thou also shouldst rejoice my joy with thine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1464">1464</span></span>"I greatly hate
too much fear, respect and ceremony in a friend, I hate unbroken
sternness, gloominess, majesty; if one be a hearty friend let him tend
towards me; if not, I for myself, he for himself, separation is much
better.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1465">1465</span></span>"I know the
heart of thy beloved with regard to thee; the visit of me who have met
thee will not displease her. Now I can venture to speak somewhat
plausibly to the king: I only desire to see the desirable sight of them.

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1466">1466</span></span>"This only will
I say to him entreatingly and respectfully: that he should give thee his
daughter of his free will. Since the end is union, how can you endure
separation? Beautify each other; fade not apart."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1467">1467</span></span>When Avt’handil
knew from Taria that he would not be hindered from going, he ventured
not to dispute, he added thereto assent. P’hridon counted over select
men as a convoy; he set out with them, of course he travelled the road
with them.
