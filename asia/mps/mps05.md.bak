### HOW THE KING OF THE ARABIANS SAW THE KNIGHT CLAD IN THE PANTHER'S SKIN

<span class="margnote"><span id="84">84</span></span> They saw a certain
stranger knight; he sat weeping on the bank of the stream, he held his
black horse by the rein, he looked like a lion and a hero; his bridle,
armour and saddle were thickly bedight with pearls; the rose (of his
cheek) was frozen in tears that welled up from his woe-stricken heart.

<span class="margnote"><span id="85">85</span></span> His form was clad
in a long coat over which was thrown a panther's skin, his head, too,
was covered with a cap of panther's skins; in his hand he held a whip
thicker

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

than a man's arm. They looked and liked to look at that wondrous sight.

<span class="margnote"><span id="86">86</span></span> A slave went forth
to speak to the knight of the woestricken heart, who, weeping with
downcast head, seems not a spectacle for jesting; from a channel of jet
(his eyelashes) rains a crystal shower. When (the slave) approached, he
could by no means bring himself to speak a word (to Tariel).

<span class="margnote"><span id="87">87</span></span> The slave was much
perturbed; he dared not address him. A long time he gazed in wonder till
his heart was strengthened; then he said: "(The king) commands thee (to
attend him)." He (the slave) came near, (and) greeted him gently; he
(Tariel) wept on and heard not, he knew not that (the slave) was there.

<span class="margnote"><span id="88">88</span></span> He heard not a
word of the slave, nor what he said; he was wholly unconscious of the
shouting of the soldiers, he was sobbing strangely, his heart burnt up
with fires; tears were mingled with blood, and flowed forth as from
floodgates.

<span class="margnote"><span id="89">89</span></span> Elsewhither his
mind was wafted, by the weight of his head! Once again the slave uttered
the king's message, but (Tariel) ceased not from weeping and heard him
not, nor was the rose-bouquet (of speech) plucked from his lips.

<span class="margnote"><span id="90">90</span></span> Since he answered
not, the slave went back and said to Rosten: "I have told him what you
said, but he will not listen. Mine eyes were dazzled as by the sun; my
heart was sorely troubled. I could not make him hear a word though I
have tarried there so long."

<span class="margnote"><span id="91">91</span></span> The king wondered,
he was wroth, he was vexed in heart against him. He sent the twelve
slaves standing before him; he commanded: "Take weapons of war in your
hands; go and bring hither him who sits yonder."

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="92">92</span></span> The slaves went
forth, they drew nigh to him, their armour clanked. Then indeed the
knight started up, he wept still more woefully; he raised his eyes and
looked round, he saw the band of warriors. But once he said, "Woe is
me!" and spoke no word more.

<span class="margnote"><span id="93">93</span></span> He passed his
hands over his eyes, he wiped away the hot tears, he made fast his sabre
and quiver, and braced his strong arms. He mounted his horse--why should
he heed the words of slaves? He wended his way elsewhither, and healed
not their troubles.

<span class="margnote"><span id="94">94</span></span> The slaves
stretched forth their hands to seize that knight; he fell upon
them--alas! even their enemies would have pitied them; he beat one
against another, he slew them without raising (on high) his hand, some
with his whip he smote, cleaving them down to the breast.

<span class="margnote"><span id="95">95</span></span> Wrathful was the
king, and annoyed; he shouted to the slaves. The youth looked not back
nor heeded his pursuers till they were upon him; as many as overtook him
he made to look like dead men, he threw down man on man; Rosten lamented
thereat.

<span class="margnote"><span id="96">96</span></span> The king and
Avt’handil mounted to follow the youth. Proud and haughty, his form
swayed to and fro, his steed was like Merani, the sun shone brightly on
the field; he perceived that the king pursued him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="97">97</span></span> When he saw that
the king was come, he struck his horse with his whip; in that very
moment he was lost, our eyes see him not; he seemed to have sunk into an
abyss or flown to heaven; they sought, but could find no trace of his
course.

<span class="margnote"><span id="98">98</span></span> His footprints
they sought, and marvelled to find no trace. Thus, leaving no vestige,
the man passed away like a Devi. The soldiers mourned for their dead;
they hastened to bind up the wounded. The king said: "I have seen cause
for loss of joy."

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="99">99</span></span> He said: "God is
weary of the happiness I have had hitherto, therefore He turns my
pleasure into the gall of bitterness; He has wounded me unto death, none
can cure me. Such, by His grace, is His will and desire."

<span class="margnote"><span id="100">100</span></span> Thus he spoke,
and returned; he went frowning away. They summoned not to the lists;
groan was mingled with groan. Each ceased from the chase wherever he was
following it. Some said: "He is right!" others said: "O God!" (?)

<span class="margnote"><span id="101">101</span></span> The king went
into his bedchamber sad and frowning. Avt’handil watched like a son that
none save himself should follow; all went away, the household dispersed;
merriment ceased, the castanet and the sweet harp.

<span class="margnote"><span id="102">102</span></span> T’hinat’hin
heard of her father's great sadness. She rose and came to the door; she
with whom the sun strove asked the chamberlain: "Sleeps he or wakes he?"
He answered: "He sits brooding; his colour has suffered a change.

<span class="margnote"><span id="103">103</span></span> "Avt’handil
alone is present; he sits in a chair before, him. They have seen a
certain stranger knight; this is the cause of his melancholy."
T’hinat’hin said: "I will now depart; it is not time for me to go in.
When he asks for me, say: 'She was here but now.'"

<span class="margnote"><span id="104">104</span></span> Time passed; he
inquired: "What doth the maiden, my solace and jewel, my water of life?"
The chamberlain replied: "She came, pale-faced, but now; she learned of
your sadness and went away, but she is ready to come to your presence."

<span class="margnote"><span id="105">105</span></span> He said: "Go,
call her; how can I bear absence from her! Say unto her: 'Why didst thou
turn back, O life of thy father? Come, drive away my grief,

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

heal my wounded heart. I will tell thee wherefore my joy fled.'"

<span class="margnote"><span id="106">106</span></span> T’hinat’hin rose
and came; she did as her father wished. The light of her face is like
the splendour of the moon. Her father set her by his side, and, kissing
her tenderly, gently, said: "Why tamest thou not to me? wert thou
waiting till I sent for thee?"

<span class="margnote"><span id="107">107</span></span> The maiden said:
"O king, who, however venturesome, would dare to approach you aware that
you were frowning? This sadness of yours upsets even the lights of
heaven. Let a man seek to solve the difficulty; this, I think, would be
better than grieving."

<span class="margnote"><span id="108">108</span></span> He answered: "O
my child, however much this sad affair grieves me, thy sight and life
cause me joy. My grief is dissipated as if I had taken an electuary. I
believe that when thou knowest thou too wilt justify my sighing and
groaning.

<span class="margnote"><span id="109">109</span></span> "I met a certain
beautiful, wondrous youth; his ray enlightened the firmament and the
bounds of the earth. I could not find out why he was afflicted, nor for
whom he wept. He came not to see me; I was irritated and quarrelled with
him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="110">110</span></span> "When he saw me,
he mounted his horse and wiped the tears from his eyes. I cried out that
he must be seized; he utterly destroyed my men; like an evil spirit, he
was lost to me, he saluted me not like a man. Even now I know not
whether he was real or a vision.

<span class="margnote"><span id="111">111</span></span> "His (God's)
tender mercies at length have become thus bitter to me; I have forgotten
the past days of my joy. Every one will make me sad and comfort me no
more. However long my days may be, I can no more rejoice."

<span class="margnote"><span id="112">112</span></span> The maid
replied: "Deign to hearken to my uttered words. O king, why repine at
God or fate! Why

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

accuse of bitterness the All-seeing, who is tender to all! And why
should the Creator of good make evil:

<span class="margnote"><span id="113">113</span></span> "If this knight
was indeed (a man) of flesh wandering over the earth, others must have
seen him; they will appear to instruct you. If not, it is a devil who
has appeared to you to disturb your joys. Refrain from sadness. Why art
thou become cheerless?

<span class="margnote"><span id="114">114</span></span> "This is my
advice: Thou art king, ruler over kings; wide is your boundary,
boundless is your power; send everywhere men with news of this story;
soon shall you know whether this youth be a mortal or not."

<span class="margnote"><span id="115">115</span></span> He commanded men
and sent them forth even to the four corners of the heavens, saying:
"Go, spare yourselves no pains; search, hunt for that youth, let nothing
hinder you; send a letter whither ye cannot go nor attain."

<span class="margnote"><span id="116">116</span></span> The men went,
they wandered about for a year; they looked, they sought that youth,
they inquired again and again. They could find none of God's creatures
who had seen him. Wearied in vain, they returned, dissatisfied with
themselves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="117">117</span></span> The slaves said:
"O king, we have wandered over the lands, yet could we not find that
youth, so we could not rejoice; we could meet no living man who had seen
him; we have not been able to serve you, now devise some other plan."

<span class="margnote"><span id="118">118</span></span> The king
replied: "My daughter, my child, spoke truth. I have seen a hideous,
unclean spirit; he has been sent as my foe, flying down from heaven.
Grief is fled from. me; I care nothing for all that."

<span class="margnote"><span id="119">119</span></span> Thus he spoke,
and sporting was increased with, rejoicing; they called the minstrel and
the acrobat! wherever they were found, many gifts were distributed, he

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

summoned all to the throne-room. What other did God create with
generosity like unto his!

<span class="margnote"><span id="120">120</span></span> Avt’handil sat
alone in his chamber, clad only in an under-garment; he was singing and
making merry, before him stood a harp. To him came T’hinat’hin's black
slave, and said: "She of the aloe form, the moonfaced one, sends for
thee."

<span class="margnote"><span id="121">121</span></span> Avt’handil was
glad to hear this joyful news. He rose and donned his best and brightest
coat. He rejoiced to meet the rose; they had never yet met alone.
Pleasant is it to gaze on beauty, and be near one beloved.

<span class="margnote"><span id="122">122</span></span> Proudly and
boldly Avt’handil came to her; he was ashamed of none. He will see her
for whom the tear of woe full oft had flowed. The peerless one sat
mournful, she shone like lightning, her rays eclipsed the moon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="123">123</span></span> Her fair form
was clad in unlined ermine, she wore negligently veils whose price it
were hard to tell; but her black, heart-piercing eyelashes and the
thick, long tresses which embraced her white throat were her real
adornments.

<span class="margnote"><span id="124">124</span></span> Pensive she sat
in her red veil; she quietly greeted Avt’handil, and gently bade him be
seated. The slave placed a seat; he sat down modestly and respectfully.
Face to face he gazed on her, full of great joy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="125">125</span></span> The knight said:
"How indeed can I speak to one so dread! If the moon meet the sun it is
consumed, it fades away. I am no longer at leisure to think; I fear for
myself. Tell me, then, why you are sad and what will relieve you."

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="126">126</span></span> The maiden
replied with elegant words, not ill-chosen, saying: "Although thou hast
hitherto remained far from me, yet I wonder thou shouldst be timid even
for a moment. But first I must tell thee of the malady which afflicts
me, as a plague.

<span class="margnote"><span id="127">127</span></span> "Dost thou
remember, when thou and Rostan killed game in the plain, how ye saw a
certain stranger youth who wiped his tears away? Since then I have been
a prey to thoughts of him. I beg thee to search for him, to seek him
even to the bounds of the earth (within the bounds of the sky).

<span class="margnote"><span id="128">128</span></span> "Although I have
been unable to hold converse with thee hitherto, yet from afar have I
perceived thy love for me; I know that without pause the hail has fallen
from thine eyes upon thy cheek. Thou art made prisoner by love; thy
heart is taken captive.

<span class="margnote"><span id="129">129</span></span> "This service of
mine which I bid thee do befits thee for these two reasons: First, thou
art a knight, among all flesh there is none like unto thee; secondly,
thou art in love with me, this is true and no slander. Go, seek that
brother-in-arms, be he near or far.

<span class="margnote"><span id="130">130</span></span> "Thereby shalt
thou strengthen my love for thee; by delivering me from my sadness, thou
shalt cripple the foul demon; plant the violet of hope in my heart,
strew roses; then come, O lion, I shall meet thee like a sun; meet thou
me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="131">131</span></span> "Seek three
years him whom thou hast to seek; if thou find him, come gaily telling
thy victory. If thou find him not, I shall believe he was a vision. Thou
shalt meet the rosebud unwithered, unfaded.

<span class="margnote"><span id="132">132</span></span> "I swear if I
wed any husband but thee, even should the sun become man, incarnate for
my sake, may I be cut off for ever from Paradise, may I be swallowed up
in Hell; love for thee would slay me, piercing my heart with a knife!"

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="133">133</span></span> The knight
replied: "O sun, who causest the jet <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md)
to blink, what have I said to thee, and what have I done to make thee
suspect me? I awaited death; thou hast renewed my will to live. I shall
certainly obey thee like a slave in service."

<span class="margnote"><span id="134">134</span></span> Again he spoke:
"O sun, since God has created thee a sun, so that the heavenly planets
obey thee wherever they may be, I have heard from you than which has
overwhelmed me with grace; my rose shall not wither, thy ray shines
generously upon it."

<span class="margnote"><span id="135">135</span></span> Once more they
made an oath together, they promised each other, they confirmed it and
discoursed much, with many a word; what grief they had borne until now
became easy. Their white teeth flashed white lightning as if
transparent.

<span class="margnote"><span id="136">136</span></span> They sat
together, they made merry, they talked simply of a hundred things, they
spoke with their crystal and ruby (faces) and jet (eyes). The knight
said: "Those who gaze upon thee become mad; my heart is burned to ashes
by the fire that comes from thee."

<span class="margnote"><span id="137">137</span></span> The youth went
away, but he could not bear parting from her; he looked back, his eyes
were dazed, crystal hails down and freezes the rose, his graceful form
was trembling; he had heart for heart, he had lent (his) to love.

<span class="margnote"><span id="138">138</span></span> He said to
himself: "O sun, separation from thee is thus early manifested on the
rose; my crystal and ruby have faded, I am become yellower than amber.
What

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

shall I do, then, when I cannot see thee for a long time? This shall be
my law: death for the beloved is fitting.

<span class="margnote"><span id="139">139</span></span> He lay down on
his bed, he weeps, it is difficult for him to wipe away the tears, he
shivered and swayed, like an aspen in the wind; when he fell into a
slumber he dreamed his beloved was near, he starts, he cries out loud,
his suffering increases twentyfold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="140">140</span></span> Separation from
his beloved made him jealous. Tears like pearls were shed upon the rose,
making it tender. When day dawned he apparelled himself, fair to look
upon; he mounted his horse, set out, and came to court for an audience.

<span class="margnote"><span id="141">141</span></span> He sent a
chamberlain into the hall of audience with a message from him to the
king, saying: "O king, I venture to tell you what I have thought: all
the face of the earth is subjected to you by your sword; now, if it be
better, I shall make known these tidings to all the vicinage.

<span class="margnote"><span id="142">142</span></span> "I will go, I
shall travel, I shall wage war, I shall go the rounds of the marches, I
shall, by piercing the heart of your enemies, announce T’hinat’hin's
accession; I shall cause the obedient to rejoice, the disobedient will I
make to weep, I shall send you gifts incessantly, I shall not be sparing
of greeting."

<span class="margnote"><span id="143">143</span></span> The king
expressed his great gratitude; he said: "O lion, stretching thine arm in
battle irks thee not. Behold, this thy counsel is matched by thy valour.
Thou mayst go, but what shall I do if it happen that thou tarry long?"

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="144">144</span></span> The knight came
in; he did homage, and spoke some words of thanks: "O monarch, I wonder
that you should deign to praise me. Now God will perchance lighten for
me the darkness of separation, and let me see again in joy your joyful
face."

<span class="margnote"><span id="145">145</span></span> The king hung
upon his neck and kissed him like a son; like unto them have none been,
neither upbringer nor upbrought. The knight rose and went away, to him
their day seemed separated; Rostan, wise and soft-hearted, wept for him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="146">146</span></span> Avt’handil set
out, a brave knight marching boldly; twenty days he journeyed, many a
day he made one with the night. She is the joy of the world, she is
treasure and due; he puts not away the thought of T’hinat’hin, of her
for whom the flame burns.

<span class="margnote"><span id="147">147</span></span> Whenever he came
there was rejoicing in the kingdom, nobles met him, they gave generous
gifts; the sun-faced had not wasted time in his rapid journey. A dawning
joy met them that came into his presence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="148">148</span></span> He had a strong
city to strike terror in the marches; outside was a rock, I tell thee,
with an unmortared wall. The knight spent there three days in the
pleasant chase; he appointed his pupil, Shermadin, as vizier.

<span class="margnote"><span id="149">149</span></span> This is the
slave Shermadin mentioned above, brought up with (Avt’handil), faithful
and self-sacrificing to him. He knew not hitherto of the fire which
burned the knight; now he (Avt’handil) revealed the hopeful words of the
sun (T’hinat’hin).

<span class="margnote"><span id="150">150</span></span> He said: "Lo,
Shermadin, for this I am ashamed before thee; thou knowest all my
affairs and hast given heed to them; but hitherto thou hast not known
what tears I have shed; in her from whom I had suffering I now find joy.

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="151">151</span></span> "I am slain by
love and longing for T’hinat’hin; from the narcissus (eyes) hot tears
moistened the frosted rose; I could not till now show my hidden woe, now
has she bidden me hope, therefore thou seest me joyful.

<span class="margnote"><span id="152">152</span></span> "She said to me:
'Learn news of that lost knight, then come, I shall fulfil thy heart's
desire; I want no husband save thee, a planted tree falls to my lot.'
She gave me the balm of my heart, until that moment bound captive.

<span class="margnote"><span id="153">153</span></span> "First, I am a
knight; I wish to go forth to serve my lady. Faithfulness to kings is
fitting, vassal must act as vassal; then, she has extinguished the fire,
my heart is no longer consumed to soot; a man must not bend before
misfortune, but meet it like a man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="154">154</span></span> "Of all lords
and vassals thou and I are most friendly; therefore I entreat thee to
hear this from mine own mouth; in my stead I appoint thee lord and chief
over mine armies, I could not entrust this matter to others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="155">155</span></span> "Lead forth the
soldiers to battle, rule the nobles, send messengers to court telling
the state of affairs, write letters in my stead, present priceless
gifts; why should it be known that I am not here? (thou must not let my
absence be perceived).

<span class="margnote"><span id="156">156</span></span> "Represent me in
military duties and in the hunting-field, wait here for me three years,
keep my secret; perchance indeed I shall return, my aloe-tree shall not
fade; but if I come not back, mourn me, weep for me, utter sighs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="157">157</span></span> "Tell the king
forthwith--it is not a desirable

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

deed--announce my death to him, be as if thou art drunk; say to him:
'For him is come to pass the thing which none escape.' Give to the poor
my treasure--gold, silver and copper.

<span class="margnote"><span id="158">158</span></span> "Thus shalt thou
help me after the best fashion, by this thou shalt aid me most; do not
forget me soon, think of me often, take good thought of provision for
me, pray for my soul. Remember my childhood; let thy heart be motherly
towards me."

<span class="margnote"><span id="159">159</span></span> When the slave
heard this he wondered, he was alarmed, from his eyes the hot tears
poured like pearls. He said: "How can the heart deprived of thee
rejoice? I know thou wilt not stay; so I cannot hinder thee in this
matter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="160">160</span></span> "Why didst thou
say thou wouldst appoint me in thy stead? How can I undertake the
lordship, how can I imitate thee or resemble thee? It were better that
the earth cradled me too than that I should have to think that thou art
alone; rather let us both steal forth, I will accompany thee, take me
with thee."

<span class="margnote"><span id="161">161</span></span> The knight
replied: "Hearken unto me, I tell thee truth without beating about the
bush: when a lover would roam the fields, alone he must wander; a pearl
falls to the lot of none without buying and bargaining. An evil and
treacherous man should be pierced with a lance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="162">162</span></span> "To whom could I
tell my secret? save thee, none is worthy. To whom can I entrust the
lordship save thee, who else can do it well? Fortify the marches that
the enemy may not encamp near! Perchance I shall return, if God make me
not to be wholly lost.

<span class="margnote"><span id="163">163</span></span> "Hazard kills
equally be it one or a hundred. Loneliness can matter naught if the
group (? grouping)

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

of the heavenly powers (? planets) protect me. If I come not hither in
three years, then will it beseem thee to mourn and wear funeral garb. I
will give thee a letter, whoever is my courtier must obey thee."
