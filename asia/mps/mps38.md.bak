### P’HATMAN TELLS AVT’HANDIL THE STORY OF NESTAN-DAREDJAN

<span class="margnote"><span id="1099">1099</span></span>"In this city
it is a rule that on New Year's Day no merchant trades, none sets out on
a journey; we all straightway begin to deck and beautify ourselves; the
sovereigns make a great court banquet.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1100">1100</span></span>"We great
merchants are bound to take presents to court; they (the sovereigns)
must give gifts befitting us. For ten days there is heard everywhere the
sound of the cymbal and tambourine; in the public square, tilting,
ball-play, the stamping of horses.

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1101">1101</span></span>"My husband,
Usen, is the leader of the great merchants, I lead their wives; I need
none to invite me; rich or poor, we give, presents to the queen; we
entertain ourselves agreeably at court, we come home merry.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1102">1102</span></span>"New Year's Day
was come, we gave our gifts to the queen; we gave to them, they gave to
us, we filled them, we were filled. After a time we went forth merry, at
our will; again we sat down to rejoice, we were not of their company.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1103">1103</span></span>"At eventide I
went into the garden to sport; I took the ladies with me, it behoved me
to entertain; them; I brought with me minstrels, they discoursed sweet
song; I played and gambolled like a child, I changed veil and hair.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1104">1104</span></span>"There in the
garden were fair mansions beautifully built, lofty, with a prospect on
every side, overhanging the sea. Thither I led the ladies, them that
were with me; anew we made a banquet, we sat pleasantly, joyously.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1105">1105</span></span>"Merry, I
entertained the merchants’ wives, pleasantly, in a sisterly way. While
drinking, without any cause a distaste came upon me. When they perceived
me thus, they separated, all that sat at meat. I was left alone; some
sadness fell on my heart like soot.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1106">1106</span></span>"I opened the
window and turned my face to the sea, I looked out, I shook off the
sadness growing within me. Far away I saw something small, it floated in
the sea, methought a bird or beast; to what else could I liken it?

<span class="margnote"><span id="1107">1107</span></span>"From afar I
could not recognize it; when it came near it was a boat; two men clad in
black, and black also of visage, on either side stood close; only a (?
woman's) head appeared; they came ashore, that strange sight astonished
me.

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1108">1108</span></span>"They beached
the boat; they landed in front the garden. They looked thither, they
looked hither, (to see if any anywhere observed them, they saw no
creature, nothing alarmed them. Secretly I watched them; I was quiet
indoors.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1109">1109</span></span>"What they
landed from the boat in a chest--they took off the lid--was a maiden of
wondrous form, who stepped forth; on her head was a black veil, beneath
she was clad in green. It would suffice the sun to be like her in
beauty.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1110">1110</span></span>"When the
maiden turned towards me, rays rose upon the rock; the lightning of her
cheeks flashed over land and sky; I blinked mine eyes, I could no more
gaze on her than on the sun; I closed the curtain of the door on my
side; they could not perceive that they were watched.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1111">1111</span></span>"I called four
slaves who waited upon me; I pointed: 'See what beauty the Indians hold
captive! Steal down, go forth, quietly, not racing hastily. If they will
sell her to you, give them the price, whatever they may be wanting.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1112">1112</span></span>"'If they will
not give her to you, let them not: take her away, capture her from them,
slay them, bring hither that moon, do the errand well, use your best
endeavour!' My slaves stole down from above as if they flew; they
chaffered, they sold not. I saw the blacks looked right ill pleased.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1113">1113</span></span>"I stood at the
window; when I saw they would not sell her, I cried: 'Slay them!' They
seized them and cut off their heads, they threw them out into the sea;
they turned back, they guarded the maiden. I went down to meet her, I
took her, she had not tarried long on the. seashore.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1114">1114</span></span>"How can I tell
thee her praise! what loveliness! what delicacy! I swear she is the sun;
’tis untrue that the sun is sun! Who can endure her rays, who can
delineate

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

her! If she consume me, lo! I am ready, no preparation is needed for
this."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1115">1115</span></span>When she had
ended these words, P’hatman rent her face with her hands; Avt’handil,
too, wept, he shed hot tears; they forgot each other, for her (Nestan's)
sake they became as mad; the spring (of tears) flawing down from above
melted the slight new-fallen snow (of the cheek).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1116">1116</span></span>They wept. The
knight said: "Break not off! Conclude!" P’hatman said: "I received her;
I made my heart faithful to her. I kissed her every part, and thereby I
wearied her. I seated her on my couch, I caressed her, I loved her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1117">1117</span></span>"I said to her:
'Tell me, O sun, who thou art or of what race a child! Whither were
those Ethiops taking thee, lady of the Pleiads of heaven?' To all these
words she made me no answer. I saw a hundred springs of tears dropping
from her eyes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1118">1118</span></span>"When I pressed
her with questions, with much discourse, she wept with gentle voice,
sobbing from the heart; a stream flowed through the jetty trough (of her
lashes) from the narcissus (eyes), upon the crystal and ruby (of her
cheeks). Gazing at her I burned, I became dead-hearted.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1119">1119</span></span>"She said to
me: 'To me thou art a mother, better than a mother. Of what profit can
my story be to thee? It is but the tale of a chatterer. A lone wanderer
am I, overtaken by an unhappy fate. If thou ask me aught, may the might
of the All-seeing curse thee!' (?)

<span class="margnote"><span id="1120">1120</span></span>"I said (to
myself), 'It is not fitting untimeously to carry off and summon the sun;
the captor will become mad and wholly lose his wits. A request should be
timely,

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

the making of every entreaty. How know I not that it not a time to
converse with this sun!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1121">1121</span></span>"I led away
that sun-faced one, (already) praise I cannot call her unpraised. By the
longing I have for her, and by her sun (life), I hardly could hide the
ray that sun! I enveloped her in many folds of heavy brocade, not thin
stuff." The tear hails down, the rose is frostbitten, from the lashes
blows a snowy blast.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1122">1122</span></span>"I led into my
home that sun-faced one, an aloe-tree in form. For her I furnished a
house, therein I put her very secretly, I told no human being, I kept
her privily, with precaution; I caused a negro to serve her; I used to
enter, I saw her alone.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1123">1123</span></span>"How, alas! can
I tell thee of her strange behaviour! Day and night weeping unceasing
and flowing of tears! I entreated her: 'Hush!' For (but) one moment
would she submit. Now without her how do I live; alas! woe is me!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1124">1124</span></span>"(When) I went
in, pools of tears stood before her; in the inky abyss (of her eyes)
were strewn jetty lances (eyelashes), from the inky lakes into the bowls
full of jet there was a stream, and between the coral and cornelian (of
her lips) glittered the twin pearls (rows of teeth).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1125">1125</span></span>"By reason of
the ceaseless flow of tears I could not find time for inquiry. If I
asked even, 'Who art thou? what brought thee into this plight?' like a
fountain, a

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

rivulet of blood gushed forth from the aloe-tree. No human being could
endure more, unless made of stone.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1126">1126</span></span>"No coverlet
she wanted, nor mattress to lie upon, she was ever in her veil and one
short cloak, her arm she placed as a head-rest and reposed thereon. With
a thousand entreaties I could scarce persuade her to eat a little.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1127">1127</span></span>"By-the-by, I
will tell thee of the wonder of the veil and cloak: I have seen all
kinds of rare and costly things, but I know not of what sort of stuff
hers were made, for it had the softness of woven material and the
firmness of forged (metal).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1128">1128</span></span>"Thus that
lovely one tarried long in my house. I could not trust my husband; I
feared he would inform. I said to myself: 'If I tell him, I know the
rascal will betray my secret at court.' Thus I thought at my frequent
goings in and comings out.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1129">1129</span></span>"I said to
myself: 'If I tell him not, what am I to do, what can I do for her? I
know not in the least what she wants, nor what any could do to help her.
If my husband finds out, he will slay me, nothing can save me; how can I
hide that sunlike light!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1130">1130</span></span>"'I, alas! what
can I do alone! The burning of my fires increases. Come, I will trust
him, I will not wrong Usen; I will make him swear not to betray me; if
he give me full assurance, he cannot doom his soul, he will not be an
oath-breaker!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1131">1131</span></span>"Alone I went
to my husband; I frolicked and fondled him. Then I said to him: 'I will
tell thee something, but first swear to me thou wilt tell no human
being, give me a binding oath.' He swore a fearful oath: 'May I beat my
head on the rocks!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1132">1132</span></span>"'What thou
tellest me I will reveal to no soul, even unto death, neither to old nor
young, friend nor foe!' Then I told all to that kind-hearted man, Usen:
'Come,

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I will lead thee
to a certain place here; come, I will show thee the sun's peer.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1133">1133</span></span>"He rose to
accompany me, we departed, we entered the palace gates. Usen marvelled;
he even quaked when he saw the sunbeams. He said: 'What hast thou shown
me, what have I seen, what is she, of what stuff? If she be verily an
earthly being, may God's eyes look upon me with wrath!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1134">1134</span></span>"I said: 'Nor
know I aught of her being a creature of flesh; I have no knowledge more
than I have told thee. Let me and thee ask who she is, and who is at
fault that such madness afflicts her; perchance she will tell us
somewhat, we will pray her to do us this great kindness.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1135">1135</span></span>"We went in, we
both had a care to show her respect. We said: 'O sun, for thy sake a
furnace of flame burns us. Tell us what is the cure for the waning moon,
what hath ensaffroned thee who art ruby-like in hue?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1136">1136</span></span>"Whether she
heard or hearkened not to what we said we know not; the rose was glued
together, it showed not the pearl; the serpents (her locks) were twined
in disorder; the garden was built with its front to the back; the sun
was obscured (eclipsed) by the dragon, it dawned not upon us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1137">1137</span></span>"By our
converse we could not induce her to answer. The coursing-panther sits
sullen-faced, we could not comprehend her wrath; again we annoyed her,
she wept tears flowing like a fountain, and, 'I know not! Let me alone!'
quoth she; this only with her tongue she said to us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1138">1138</span></span>"We sat down
and wept with her and poured forth

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

tears. What we had spoken to her made us sorry; how could we venture to
say aught else? We could scarce persuade her to be quiet, we calmed her,
we soothed her; we offered her some fruit, but we could not make her eat
at all.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1139">1139</span></span>"Usen said:
'She has wiped away a multitude of woes from me. Those cheeks are fit
for the sun; how can they be kissed by man! Most right is he who sees
not her if his sufferings be increased a hundred-and-twenty-fold. If I
prefer my children may God slay them!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1140">1140</span></span>"A long time we
gazed at her, (then) we went forth with sighs and moans; to be with her
seemed to us joy, parting grieved us greatly. When we had leisure from
affairs of trade we used to see her. Our hearts were inextricably
prisoned in her net.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1141">1141</span></span>"After some
time had passed, and nights and days were sped, Usen said to me: 'I have
not seen our king since the day before yesterday; if thou advisest me, I
will go and see him, I will go and pay my court and present gifts.' I
replied: 'Certainly, by God, since such is your desire.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1142">1142</span></span>"Usen set out
pearls and gems on a tray. I entreated him, saying: 'At court thou wilt
meet the drunken court folk. Kill me! if thou be not wary of the story
of that maid.' Again he swore to me: 'I will not tell it, may swords
strike my head!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1143">1143</span></span>"Usen went; he
found the king sitting feasting. Usen is the king's boon companion, and
the king is his well-wisher. (The king) called him forward; he accepted
the gifts he had brought. Now behold the tipsy merchant, how hasty, rash
and ill-bred he is!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1144">1144</span></span>"When the king
had drunk before Usen many great goblets, still they quaffed and again
filled more tankards and beakers; he forgot those oaths; what (to him
were)

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Korans and Meccas!
Truly is it said: 'A rose befits not a crow, nor do horns suit an ass!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1145">1145</span></span>"The great king
said to the witless, drunken Usen: 'I marvel much whence thou gettest
these gems to give us, (where) thou findest huge pearls and peerless
rubies. By my head! I cannot return thee one-tenth for thy gifts!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1146">1146</span></span>"Usen saluted,
and said: 'O mighty sovereign, shedder of beams from above, O nourisher
of creatures, O sun! Whatever else I have, whose is it, be it gold or
treasure? What brought I forth from my mother's womb? By you it has been
granted to me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1147">1147</span></span>"'By your head!
I make bold to say that gratitude for gifts beseems you not. I have
somewhat else, a daughter-in-law for you, a bride to unite to your son;
for this undoubtedly you will thank me when you see the sun's like; then
will you oftener say: "Happiness is ours!"'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1148">1148</span></span>"Why should I
lengthen (speech)? He brake his oath, the power of religion; he told of
the finding of the maid portrayed by gazers as a sun. This pleased the
king greatly; it gave gaiety to his heart. He ordered her conveyance to
court and the fulfilment of Usen's utterance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1149">1149</span></span>"Pleasantly I
was sitting here at home; hitherto I had not sighed. At the door
appeared the chief of the king's slaves, he brought with him sixty
slaves, as is the custom of kings; they came in, I was much astonished,
I said: 'This is some high affair (of state).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1150">1150</span></span>"They greeted
me: 'P’hatman,' said they, 'it is the command of the equal of the sun:
that maid like two suns whom Usen presented to-day, now bring her to me,
I shall take her with me; we have not far to go.' When I

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

heard this, the heavens overwhelmed me, with wrath hill struck hill (or
heap fell on heap).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1151">1151</span></span>"Thereupon in
amazement I inquired: 'What maid do you want, which?' They said to me:
'Usen presented (one with) a face flashing with lightning.' There was
nought to be done; the day of the taking away of my soul (*i.e.*,
Nestan) was fixed. I trembled, I could not rise, neither could I remain
sitting.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1152">1152</span></span>"I went in; I
saw that lovely one weeping and flooded in tears. I said: 'O sun, seest
thou fully how black fate hath played me false! Heaven is turned towards
me in wrath, I am despoiled, I am wholly uprooted; I am denounced, the
king asketh for thee, therefore am I heartbroken.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1153">1153</span></span>"She said to
me: 'Sister, marvel not, however hard this may be! Luckless Fate hath
ever been a doer of ill upon me; if some good had befallen me thou
mightest have wondered, what marvel is evil? All kinds of woe are not
new to me, old are they.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1154">1154</span></span>"Her eyes
poured forth frequent tears like pearls. She rose as fearless as if she
were a panther or a hero; joy no longer seemed joy nor did woe seem woe
to her. She begged me to cover her form and face with a veil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1155">1155</span></span>"I went into
the treasure-house; I took out gems and pearls on which no price was
set, as much as I could, every single separate one was worth a city. I
went back; I girded them round the waist of her for whose sake my black
(sad) heart was dying.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1156">1156</span></span>"I said: 'O my
(dear one)! Perchance this sort of thing may somewhere be of use to
thee!' I gave that face, the sun's peer, into the hands of the slaves.
The

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

king was warned, he met her; the kettledrum was beaten, there was
hubbub. She went forward with bent head, calm, saying nought.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1157">1157</span></span>"Onlookers
flocked upon her, there was trampling and uproar; the officers could not
hold them back, there was no quiet there. When the king saw her,
cypress-like, coming towards him, he said in amazement: 'O sun, how art
thou brought hither (from heaven)?' (or, 'how contest thou hither?')

<span class="margnote"><span id="1158">1158</span></span>"Sun-like, she
made those who gazed on her to blink. The king deigned to say: 'I have
seen (sights), she hath turned me into (one) who has seen nought. Who
but God could imagine her? Right is he who is in love with her if he,
wretched, roam mad in deserts!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1159">1159</span></span>"He seated her
at his side, he talked to her with sweet discourse; quoth he: 'Tell me
who art thou, whose art thou, of what race art thou come?' With her
sun-like face she gave no answer; with bowed head, of gentle mien,
sorrowful she sits.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1160">1160</span></span>"Whatever he
said, she hearkened not to the king. Elsewhere was her heart; of
somewhat else she thought. The roses were glued together; she opened not
the pearl. She made them that looked on her wonder of what she thought.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1161">1161</span></span>"The king said:
'What can we think of? with what can we comfort our heart? There can be
no opinion save these two: Either she is in love with someone, she is
thinking of her beloved, save him she has no leisure for any, to none
can she speak;

<span class="margnote"><span id="1162">1162</span></span>"'Or she is
some sage, lofty and high-seeing ; joy

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

seems not joy to her, nor sorrow wheal it is heaped on sorrow, as a tale
she looks on misfortune and happiness alike; she is elsewhere, elsewhere
she soars, her mind is like a dove's.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1163">1163</span></span>"'God grant my
son come home victorious. I will have for his home-coming this sun ready
for him; perchance he will make her say something, and we also shall
know what is revealed; till then, let the moon rest with waning ray far
sundered from the sun.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1164">1164</span></span>"Of the king's
son I will tell thee: a good, fearless youth, peerless in valour and
beauty, fair in face and form; at that time he was gone forth to war,
there had he tarried long; for him his father prepared her, the starlike
one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1165">1165</span></span>"They brought
her and apparelled her form in maidenly garb; on it was seen many a ray
of glittering gems, on her head they set a crown of a whole ruby, there
the rose was beautified by the colour of the transparent crystal (of her
face).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1166">1166</span></span>"The king
commanded: 'Deck the chamber of the princess royal.' They set up a couch
of gold, of red of the Occident. The great king himself, the lord of the
whole palace, arose and set thereon that sun, the joy of the heart of
beholders.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1167">1167</span></span>"He commanded
nine eunuchs to stand guard at the door. The king sat down to a feast
befitting their race; to Usen he gave immeasurable (gifts) as a return
for that peer of the sun; they made trumpet and kettledrum to sound for
the increasing of the noise.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1168">1168</span></span>"They prolonged
the feasting; the drinking went on exceeding long. The sun-faced maiden
says to Fate: 'What a murderous fate have I! Whence am I come

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

hither, to whom shall I belong, for whose sake am I mad? What shall I
do? What shall I undertake? What will avail me? A very hard life have
I!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1169">1169</span></span>"Again she
says: 'I will not wither the rose-like beauty. I will attempt somewhat;
perchance God will protect me from my foe. What reasonable man slays
himself before death (comes)? When he is in trouble, then it needs that
the intelligent should have his wits!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1170">1170</span></span>"She called the
eunuchs, and said: 'Hearken, come to reason! You are deceived, mistaken
as to my royalty; your lord is in error in desiring me for a
daughter-in-law. In vain, alas! sounds he for me the trumpet, the
kettledrum and clarion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1171">1171</span></span>"'I am not
suited to be your queen; elsewhither leads my path. God keep man far
from me, be he sun-faced, cypress-formed! You beg of me something
different; my business is of another kind. With you my life beseems me
not.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1172">1172</span></span>"'Without fail
I shall slay myself, I shall strike a knife into my heart; your lord
will kill you, you will have no time of tarrying in the world. This then
is better: I will give you the weighty treasure wherewith my waist is
girded, let me steal away, let me go free, lest you regret.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1173">1173</span></span>"She undid the
pearls and gems that girdled her; she doffed, too, the crown,
transparent, of a whole ruby; she gave them, she said: 'Take them, with
burning heart I implore you; let me go, and you will have paid a great
debt to your God!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1174">1174</span></span>"The slaves
were greedy for her costly treasure, they forgot the fear of the king as
of a bellman, they resolved to let her of the peerless face escape. See
what gold doth, that crook from a devilish root!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1175">1175</span></span>"Gold never
gives joy to them that love it; till the

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

day of death greed makes them gnash their teeth. (Gold) comes in and
goes out, they murmur at the course of the planets when it is lacking;
moreover it binds the soul here (in this world), and hinders it from
soaring up.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1176">1176</span></span>"When the
eunuchs had ended the matter as she wished, one took off his garment and
gave it to her; they passed through other doors (because) the great hall
was full of drunken men. The moon remained full, unswallowed by the
serpent.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1177">1177</span></span>"The slaves,
too, disappeared; they stole forth with her. The maiden knocked at my
door, and asked for me, P’hatman. I went, I knew her, I embraced her,
was I not surprised! She would not come in with me at all, saying: 'Why
dost thou invite me?' I regretted it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1178">1178</span></span>"She said to
me: 'I have bought myself with what thou gavest me. May God in return
reward thee with heavenly favour! No longer canst thou hide me, let me
go, send me off swiftly on horseback ere the king get wit and send men
to gallop in pursuit.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1179">1179</span></span>"Swiftly I
entered the stable, I loosed the best steed, I saddled it, set her upon
it; cheerful was she, not sighing. She was like the sun, the best of
heaven's lights, when it mounts the Lion <span
id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_31.md)My labour was lost; I could not harvest
what I had sown.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1180">1180</span></span>"The day drew
down to evening, the rumour spread, her pursuers came; inside the city
was a state of siege, they raised a hue and cry; they questioned me, I
said: 'If you find her there in the house where I am, may I be guilty
towards the kings and answerable for their blood-money.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1181">1181</span></span>"They sought,
nought could they discover, they returned abashed. From that time the
king and all his familiars mourn. Behold the palace folk; they go in

in raiment) dyed violet colour <span id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_32.md). The
sun went away from us; since then we lack light.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1182">1182</span></span>"Now I shall
narrate to thee anon the whereabouts of that moon, but first of all I
will tell thee why that man threatened me. I, alas! was his doe; he was
my buck; Timidity slurs a man, and wantonness a woman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1183">1183</span></span>"I am not
content with my husband, for he is lean and ill-favoured; this man, the
[Chachnagir](errata.htm#0.md), was a gentleman high at court; we loved each
other, though I shall wear no mourning weeds for him; would that one
might give me a cup of his blood to sip!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1184">1184</span></span>"Like a woman,
like a fool, I told him this story of the coming of that sun to me, and
of her stealing away like a fox; he threatened me with exposure, not
like a friend, like a foe. Now when I think of him as a corpse, ah! how
relieved am I!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1185">1185</span></span>"Whenever we
quarrelled alone he menaced me. When I called thee I did not think he
was at home; he had arrived, he told me of his coming. Thou also wert
coming; I was afraid, so I begged thee: 'Do not come!' I sent a slave to
meet thee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1186">1186</span></span>"You turned not
back, you came, you brought beams of light to me; you both met, you were
assembled to fight over me, so I feared, I could think of no way. He,
alas! desired my death in his heart, and not (only) with his tongue.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1187">1187</span></span>"If thou hadst
not slain him, and if he had gone forthwith to court, in his wrath he
would have denounced me, (for) his heart was burned as with fire; the
angry king

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

would have cleared away my house at one swoop, he would, O God! have
made me eat my children, then he would have stoned me with stone.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1188">1188</span></span>"God reward
thee in return--what thanks can I render thee! thee who hast delivered
me safe from that serpent's gaze! Now henceforth I can be happy in my
star and fate! No longer do I fear death. Ha! ha! . . ."

said: "Fear not! even in the book is it thus written: 'Of all foes the
most hateful is the friend-foe; if a man be wise, he will not heartily
confide.' Fear I no more from him, now is he corpse-like.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1190">1190</span></span>"Tell me the
same story--since thou spedst the maiden, all the tidings thou hast
learned or heard of her." Again P’hatman spoke weeping; again the tear
flowed from her eyes. Quoth she: "The ray which sun-like illumined the
fields was brought to nought."
