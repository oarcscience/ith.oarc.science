### V

### THE TELLING OF HIS TALE BY TARIEL WHEN HE FIRST TOLD IT TO AVT’HANDIL

<span class="margnote"><span id="300">300</span></span>"Hearken, give
heed to the hearing of my tidings, discourses and deeds such that I can
scarce utter them! She who maddens me, for whom I am overpowered by
melancholy, for whom flow streams of blood, from her I never expect
comfort.

<span class="margnote"><span id="301">301</span></span>"Thou knowest, as
every man knows, of India's seven kings. P’harsadan possessed six
kingdoms; he was sovereign, generous, rich, bold, ruler over kings, in
form a lion, in face a sun, a conqueror in battle, a leader of
squadrons.

<span class="margnote"><span id="302">302</span></span>"My father sat on
the seventh throne, king, terror of adversaries; Saridan was his name;
not underhanded in the destruction of enemies, none dared offend him
either openly or secretly; he hunted and made merry, careless of Fate.

<span class="margnote"><span id="303">303</span></span>"He hated
solitude; it created hosts of cares in his heart. He said to himself:
'By conquest I have taken from foes the vicinage of the marches, I have
chased them forth everywhere, I am seated in power, I have pomp and
might; he said: 'I will go and enjoy the favour of King P’harsadan.'

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="304">304</span></span>"He resolved to
despatch an envoy to P’harsadan; he sent a message saying: 'Thou hast
the rule of all India; now I also wish to exhibit before you the power
of my heart; may the glory of my faithful service remain!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="305">305</span></span>"P’harsadan, on
hearing those tidings, made great jubilation. He sent a message: 'I,
ruler of the lands, give thanks to God, because thou, a king like me
enthroned in India, hast done this; now come, I shall honour thee like a
brother and parent.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="306">306</span></span>"He bestowed on
him one kingdom well worthy of a good knight (or vassal), also the
dignity of Amirbar (Grand Marshal)--the Amirbar in India is also
Amirspasalar (Commander-in-Chief); when he sat as king, he was not
absolute: he only lacked the overlordship, in all else he was sovereign
lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="307">307</span></span>"The king
considered my father equal with himself; he said: 'I wager that no man
has an Amirbar like mine.' They waged war and they hunted; they forced
their enemies to make peace. I am not like him, as no other man is like
me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="308">308</span></span>"The king and the
sunlike queen had no child, for this they were sad; a time came when the
armies were seized with alarm thereat. Woe befall that cursed day when I
was given (born) to the Amirbar! The king said: 'I shall rear him as my
son; he is even of mine own race.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="309">309</span></span>"The king and
queen took me as their child, they brought me up as lord of all the
soldiers and countries, they gave me wise men to instruct me in the
behaviour and deportment of kings. I grew up, I became like the sun to
look upon, like a lion in mien.

<span class="margnote"><span id="310">310</span></span>"Asmat’h, tell me
whatever thou knowest to be false in my story! When I was five years old
I was like an opened rosebud; to me it appeared no labour to slay a

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

lion--it was like a sparrow. P’harsadan cared not that he had no son.

<span class="margnote"><span id="311">311</span></span>"Asmat’h, thou
art witness of my pallor! I was fairer in beauty than the sun, as the
hour of dawn than darkness. Those who saw me said: 'He is like a
nursling of Eden.' My person now is but a shadow of what it was then.

<span class="margnote"><span id="312">312</span></span>"I was five years
old when the queen became with child." When he had said this the youth
sighed, and weeping said: "She bare a daughter." He was like to faint;
Asmat’h sprinkled water on his breast. He said: "She for whom these
flames now burn me was like the sun even then.

<span class="margnote"><span id="313">313</span></span>"The tongue with
which I now speak cannot utter the praise of her. P’harsadan sat down to
announce the good news with jubilation and pomp. From everywhere came
kings bringing many kinds of gifts. They gave away treasure; they filled
the soldiers with presents.

<span class="margnote"><span id="314">314</span></span>"The guests at
the birth festivities separated. They began to rear me and the maiden;
even then she was like the sun's rays augmented threefold; the king and
queen loved us and looked on us alike. Now shall I utter the name of her
for whom my heart is consumed by flame."

<span class="margnote"><span id="315">315</span></span>The knight
swooned when he sought to mention her name. Avt’handil also wept; his
fire made his heart like soot. The maiden revived (Tariel); she
sprinkled water on his breast. He said: "Hearken! but this truly is the
day of my death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="316">316</span></span>"That maiden was
called by the name Nestan-Daredjan. When she was seven years old she was
a gentle and wise maid, moonlike, not equalled by the sun in beauty;

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

from her how can the heart bear separation (even if it were) adamant or
forged (steel)?

<span class="margnote"><span id="317">317</span></span>"So she grew up,
(and) I was able to go to battle. Since the king looked upon the maid as
the heir to the kingship, he gave me back into the hands of my father.
When I was of that age I played at ball, I sported in the lists, I
killed a lion like a cat.

<span class="margnote"><span id="318">318</span></span>"The king built a
house, and in it a dwelling for the maid; for stone he used bezoar, cut
jacinths and rubies; in front was a little garden and a fountain of
rose-water for bathing; there abode she for whose sake a furnace of
flame consumes me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="319">319</span></span>"Day and night
cut aloes poured forth their incense from censers. Sometimes she sits in
the tower; sometimes she descends to the garden when it is shaded. Davar
was the king's sister, a widow who had been wedded in Kadjet’hi; to her
the king gave his child to be taught wisdom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="320">320</span></span>"The palace was
curtained with cloth of gold and costly brocades; none of us saw her
(how) she became crystal and rose of face; Asmat’h and two slaves she
had, they played backgammon. There her shape was formed; she grew up
like (? a tree) in Gabaon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="321">321</span></span>"I was fifteen
years old. The king brought me up as a son; by day I was before him,
(and) he did not even give me leave to sleep (at home). In power a lion,
to the eye a sun, in form I was like one reared in Eden; they lauded the
feats done by me in archery and in the lists.

<span class="margnote"><span id="322">322</span></span>"The arrow I shot
slew beasts and game; returned from the plain, I played at ball in the
square; then I went home, I used to make a feast, accustomed continually

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

to rejoice. Now Fate has sundered me from the crystal-ruby-faced!

<span class="margnote"><span id="323">323</span></span>"My father died;
the day of his death was come. This event brought to nought all sign of
merriment for P’harsadan; it rejoiced those whom terror of fear of him
as a foe exhausted; the loyal began to mourn and recall the reproaches
of their enemies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="324">324</span></span>"I sat in the
dark (mourning) for a year, annihilated by Fate; by day and by night I
groaned, calmed by none; then courtiers came to conduct me, they told me
the king's command; he said: 'Son Tariel, wear mourning no longer!

<span class="margnote"><span id="325">325</span></span>"'We are even
more grieved (than thou) at the loss of our peer.' He gave a hundred
treasures, and commanded that I should put off my black (raiment). He
gave me all the lordship that had belonged to (my father). 'Thou shalt
be Amirbar; fulfil the duties of thy father.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="326">326</span></span>"I was inflamed;
inextinguishable furnaces burned me for my father's sake. The courtiers
standing before me led me out from the dark; the monarchs of India made
jubilation at my coming forth; they met me afar off, they kissed me with
regard like parents.

<span class="margnote"><span id="327">327</span></span>"They seated me
near their thrones, they honoured me like their son, they both told me
gently of my obligation of duty; I was recalcitrant, and to behave as he
(my father) had done seemed a horror to me. They would take no denial; I
submitted, and bent to them (did homage) as Amirbar."
