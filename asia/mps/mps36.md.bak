### XXXIII

### AVT’HANDIL'S LETTER IN ANSWER TO P’HATMAN'S

<span class="margnote"><span id="1073">1073</span></span>"Thou hast
written to me; I have read thy letter in praise of me. Thou hast
anticipated me, but the burning of the fire (of love) afflicts me more
than thee. Thou wishest, I too want thy company uninterrupted. Our union
is agreed since it is the desire of both."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1074">1074</span></span>I cannot tell
thee how P’hatman's pleasure increased. She wrote: "The tears I, absent
from thee, have shed suffice. Now I shall be unaccompanied, here shalt
thou find me alone; hasten my union with thee, to-night when evening
falls. Come!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="1075">1075</span></span>That very night
when the letter of invitation was presented to the knight, when twilight
was falling and he was going, another slave met him on the way (with the
message): "Come not to-night; thou shalt find me unready for thee." This
vexed him, he turned not back, he said: "What sort of thing is this?"

<span class="margnote"><span id="1076">1076</span></span>The invited
guest went not back again on the withdrawal of his invitation. P’hatman
sits troubled. Avt’handil the tree-like went in alone. He perceived the
woman's uneasiness, he saw it forthwith on his going in; she could not
reveal it from fear, and also out of complaisance for him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1077">1077</span></span>They sat down
together and began to kiss, to sport pleasantly, when a certain elegant
youth of graceful mien appeared standing in the doorway. He entered;
close behind followed a slave with sword and shield. When he saw
Avt’handil he was afraid. "It looks," quoth he (to himself), "as if the
road were rocky."

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1078">1078</span></span>When P’hatman
saw, she was afraid, she shook and fell a-trembling. (The stranger)
gazed with wonder at them lying caressing; he said: "I will not hinder,
O woman . . . but when day breaks I shall cause thee to repent that thou
hast had this youth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1079">1079</span></span>"Thou hast
shamed me, O wicked woman, and made me to be despised, but to-morrow
thou shalt know the answer to be paid for this deed; I shall make thee
to devour thy children with thy teeth; if I fail to do this, spit upon
my beard <span id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md), let me run mad in the
fields!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="1080">1080</span></span>Thus he spake,
and the man touched his beard <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_30.md) and
went out of the door. P’hatman began to beat her head, her cheeks were
scratched, the gurgling of her tears flowing like a fountain was heard.
She said: "Come, stone me with stone, let the throwers approach!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="1081">1081</span></span>She laments: I
have, alas! slain my husband, I have killed off my little children, I
have given away as loot our possessions, the peerless cut gems! I am
separated from my dear ones! Alas! the upbringer! Alas! the upbrought! I
have made an end of myself; shameful are my words!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="1082">1082</span></span>Avt’handil
hearkened to all this in perplexity. He said: "What troubles thee, what
say’st thou, why dost thou thus lament, why did that youth threaten
thee, what fault found he in thee? Be calm; tell me who he was and on
what errand he roved!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="1083">1083</span></span>The woman
replied: "O lion! I am mad with the flow of tears; ask me no more
tidings, nought can I tell thee with my tongue. I have slain my children
with mine own hand, therefore can I no more be gay; impatient for thy
love I have slain myself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1084">1084</span></span>"This kind of
thing certainly should happen to

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

the utterer of idle words, the chatterer who cannot hide a secret, the
witless, mad, raving. 'Help me with your lamentations!" This will I say
to all who see me. A physician cannot cure one who drinks his own blood!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1085">1085</span></span>"Do one thing
of two: desire nothing more than this: If thou canst kill that man, go,
slay him secretly by night; thus shalt thou save me and all my house
from slaughter; return, I will tell thee all, the reason why I shed
tears.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1086">1086</span></span>"If not, take
away thy loads on asses this very night, escape from my neighbourhood,
gather everything for flight. I doubt my sins will fill thee too with
woe. If that knight go to court he will mare me eat my children with my
mouth."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1087">1087</span></span>When
Avt’handil, the proud, gifted with bold resolve, heard this, he arose
and took a mace--how fair, how bold is he! "To ignore this matter would
be remissness on my part!" said he. Think not any living is his like;
there is none other like unto him!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1088">1088</span></span>To P’hatman he
said: "Give me a man as instructor, as guide, let him show me the road
truly, else I want no helper; I cannot look on that man as a warrior and
mine equal. What I do I shall tell thee; wait for me, be calm!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="1089">1089</span></span>The woman gave
him a slave as guide and leader. Again she cried out: "Inasmuch as the
hot fire is to be cooled, if thou slay that knight to assuage the
irritation of my heart, he has my ring, I entreat thee to bring it
hither."

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1090">1090</span></span>Avt’handil of
the peerless form passed the city. On the seashore stood a building of
red-green stone; in the lower part fair palaces, then above terrace upon
terrace, vast, beautiful, numerous, hanging one over the other.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1091">1091</span></span>Thither is the
sun-faced Avt’handil led by his guide, who says to him in a low voice:
"This is the palace of him thou seekest." He shows it to him, and says:
"Seest thou him standing on yonder terrace? There he lies to sleep; know
this, or thou shalt find him sitting."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1092">1092</span></span>Before the door
of that luckless youth lay two guards. The knight (Avt’handil) passed,
he stole in without making a sound; he put a hand on each of their
throats, forthwith he slew them, he struck head upon head, brain and
hair were mingled.
