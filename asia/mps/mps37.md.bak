### XXXIV

### HERE IS THE SLAYING OF THE CHACHNAGIR AND HIS TWO GUARDS BY AVT’HANDIL

<span class="margnote"><span id="1093">1093</span></span>That youth lay
alone in his chamber with angry heart. Bloody-handed Avt’handil, strong
in stature, entered, he gave him no time to rise, privily he slew him,
we could not have perceived it; he laid hold of him, struck him on the
ground, slew him with a knife.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1094">1094</span></span>He is a sun to
them that gaze on him, a wild beast and a terror to those that oppose
him. He cut off the finger with the ring, he hurled him down to the
ground; he threw him from the window towards the sea, he was mingled
with the sands of the sea; for him nowhere is there a tomb, nor spade to
dig his grave.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1095">1095</span></span>Not a sound of
their slaughter was heard. The sweet rose came forth; whereby could he
have been so

embittered? This is a marvel to me, how he could thus steal his blood!
As he had lately come, by the same road went he away.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1096">1096</span></span>When the lion,
the sun, the sweetly-speaking knight, came into P’hatman's (house), he
announced: "I have slain him; no more will that youth see sunny day; thy
slave himself I have as witness; make him swear an oath in God's name
(that I did the deed); behold the finger and the ring, and I have my
knife bloodied.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1097">1097</span></span>"Now tell me of
what thou spakest, why thou wert so furiously enraged. With what did
that man threaten thee? I am in great haste (to know it)." P’hatman
embraced his legs: "I am not worthy to look on thy face; my wounded
heart is healed; now am I ready to extinguish my fires.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1098">1098</span></span>"I and Usen
with our children are now born anew. O lion, how can we magnify thy
praises! Since we may boast that his blood is spilt, I will tell thee
all from the beginning; prepare to listen.
