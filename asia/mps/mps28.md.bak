### XXV

### HERE IS THE GOING OF TARIEL AND AVT’HANDIL TO THE CAVE, AND THEIR SEEING OF ASMAT’H

<span class="margnote"><span id="894">894</span></span>Avt’handil also
wept with him and shed tears. He said: "Be patient, die not, rend not
altogether thy heart. God will be merciful in this, though sorrow hath
not shunned thee; if He had willed to part you, He would not first have
united you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="895">895</span></span>"Mischance
pursues the lover, embitters life for him; but to him who at first bears
woe it yields joy at last. Love is grievous, for it brings thee nigh
unto death; it maddens the instructed, it teaches the untaught."

<span class="margnote"><span id="896">896</span></span>They wept and
went on; they wended their way to the cave. When Asmat’h saw them she
rejoiced indeed; she met them, she wept, her tears wore channels in the
rocks. They kissed and wept aloud; each pressed the other to tell his
news again.

<span class="margnote"><span id="897">897</span></span>Asmat’h said: "O
God, Thou who canst not be

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

expressed by man's tongue! Thou art the fulness of all; Thou fillest us
with Thy sun-like radiance. If I praise Thee, how can I praise Thee?
What can I say in praise of Thee, who art not to be praised by the
intellect? Glory to Thee! Thou hast not slain me by the shedding of
tears for them."

<span class="margnote"><span id="898">898</span></span>Tariel said: "Ah,
sister! for this have my tears flowed here. For that she erstwhile made
us smile, Fate makes us weep in turn; ’tis an old law of the world, not
one newly to be heard of! Alas! were it not for pity of thee, death
would be my joy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="899">899</span></span>"If he be
athirst, what sane, reasonable man would pour away water! I marvel why I
am soaked in tears from mine eyes! Lack of water slays, water flows
never dried. Alas! the opened rose, the beauteous pearl, is lost!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="900">900</span></span>Avt’handil, too,
was reminded of his sun and beloved. He said: "O mine own, how can I
remain living without thee! Apart from thee my life is for me pitiable.
Who can tell thee how I suffer, or how sore a fire burns me!

<span class="margnote"><span id="901">901</span></span>"How can the rose
think, 'If the sun go away I shall not wither'? Or what, alas! will be
our lot when the sun sets behind the hill? Heart, it is better for thee
to harden thyself, petrify thyself wholly. Perchance it may happen to
thee to see her; let not thy spirit be utterly spent!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="902">902</span></span>They calmed their
souls, they were silent, fire burned both. Asmat’h followed, went in;
like them, a furnace consumed her. She stretched out the panther's skin
he formerly used. They both sat down; they spoke of whatever pleased
them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="903">903</span></span>They roasted meat
and made a meal fitting the occasion; there the meal was breadless, and
there was no multitude of guests. They begged (Tariel) to eat; he had

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

not power to eat; he chewed a morsel, spat it out, he hardly swallowed
the weight of a drachm.

<span class="margnote"><span id="904">904</span></span>Pleasant it is
when man converses agreeably with man; he will listen to what is said,
not let it pass in vain; thus the fire which burns so greatly is
somewhat quenched; great comfort it is to speak of troubles when a man
has the opportunity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="905">905</span></span>That night those
lions, those heroes, were together, they conversed, and each revealed to
the other his woes; when day dawned they began again many-worded
conversations; they heard (again) from each other the oath formerly
sworn.

<span class="margnote"><span id="906">906</span></span>Tariel said: "Why
speak many words? For that which thou hast done for me, God is surety
for the debt. Oath for oath is enough; remembrance, friendship for a
departing friend, are not the deed of a drunken man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="907">907</span></span>"Now be merciful
to me, make me not burn again in hottest fires; the flame which consumes
me is not kindled by a steel; thou canst not extinguish it for me, thou
thyself shalt be burned by the law of the creation of the world. Go,
return, go back thither, to the place where thy sun is.

<span class="margnote"><span id="908">908</span></span>"To cure me seems
hard even to Him who created me--understand, ye who hear!--therefore I
roam mad in the fields. Once I too was a doer of what befits the
reasonable; now the turn of madness has fallen to my lot, and so I am
mad."

<span class="margnote"><span id="909">909</span></span>Avt’handil said:
"What can I say in answer to this thou hast said? Thou thyself hast
spoken as a man sagely instructed. How is it not possible for God again
to cure the wound! He is the upbringer of everything planted or sown.

<span class="margnote"><span id="910">910</span></span>"Why should God
do this, create such as you and not unite you, part you, madden thee
with weeping?

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mischance pursues
the lover. Look well into the matter, know it. If you meet not each
other again, then slay me!

<span class="margnote"><span id="911">911</span></span>"Who else is a
man save he that will endure what is grievous? How can one let himself
be bent by grief! What subject of conversation is this! Fear not, God is
generous though the world be hard! Learn then what I teach thee; I make
bold to tell thee that he who will not learn is an ass.

<span class="margnote"><span id="912">912</span></span>"Heed what thou
hearest; let this suffice for teaching. I asked leave of my sun to come
away to you; I said to her: 'Since he made cinders of my heart I am no
longer of use to thee, I will not stay; what else need I tell thee in
many (words)?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="913">913</span></span>"She said: 'I am
content, thou art doing well and bravely, the attention thou showest to
him I accept as a service to me.' At her request I came away. I am not
drunk nor intoxicated! If I now return what shall I say? 'Why art thou
come back like a coward?' (will be her greeting) .

<span class="margnote"><span id="914">914</span></span>"Better than such
discourse is this: hearken to what I say: The man who is to do a
difficult deed must be reasonable, the rose withered for lack of sun
cannot make provision for itself; (if) thou art no longer of any, use to
thyself, be of use to me; brother must act brotherly to brother.

<span class="margnote"><span id="915">915</span></span>"Wherever thou
wilt, stay there after thy rule: if thou wilt with wise heart, if thou
wilt with maddened mind. With that loveliness of mien, that grace of
form, do but strengthen thyself, die not, be not consumed by the flame!

<span class="margnote"><span id="916">916</span></span>"I beg no more
than leave for a year and a week.

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Here in the cave
look for me when I have gathered news from every quarter. As a token of
that time I give thee the season when these roses shall again bloom
abundantly; the sight of the roses will make thee start as at the bark
of a dog.

<span class="margnote"><span id="917">917</span></span>"If I exceed that
time and come not hither to the cave, then know that I am not alive,
undoubtedly I shall have died. It will be a sufficient token of this if
thou shed tears for me. Then rejoice if thou wilt, or if thou wilt
increase thy grief.

<span class="margnote"><span id="918">918</span></span>"Now perchance
wilt thou sorrow for the sake of what I have told thee? I go far from
thee, and I know not whether horse or ship may fail me. No! lack of
speech avails not. I am not quick-scented like a beast; I know not what
God will do to me, nor the ever-revolving sky."

<span class="margnote"><span id="919">919</span></span>He (Tariel) said:
"I will weary thee no more, nor say too much; thou wilt not listen to me
however much I lengthen my discourse. If a friend will not follow thee,
follow thou him; do whatever he wills. In the end every bidden thing
shall come to light.

<span class="margnote"><span id="920">920</span></span>"When thou art
convinced, then thou shalt know the difficulty of mine affairs; for me
it is all one, roaming or not roaming; what thou hast told me that will
I do, however much madness torture me. (But) if shortness of days
(*i.e.*, death) befall me in thine absence, what shall I do?"

<span class="margnote"><span id="921">921</span></span>They ended their
discourse; they gave that promise to each other. They mounted, rode out,
each killed game in the plain. They returned, their tearful hearts wept
again; the thought of the parting on the morrow added grief to grief.

<span class="margnote"><span id="922">922</span></span>Readers of these
verses, your eyes also are shedding tears! What, alas! shall heart do
without heart, if heart

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

part from heart! Absence and parting from a friend are the slayers of a
man. Who, indeed, knows not, understands not, how hard is that day!

<span class="margnote"><span id="923">923</span></span>Morning dawned;
they mounted and said farewell to the maiden. From the eyes of Tariel,
Asmat’h and Avt’handil tears flowed. The cheeks of all three hung out
flags of crimson. Those lions ever made wild (by grief went out to the
beasts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="924">924</span></span>They descended
(from) the caves and went away crying aloud with flowing tears. Asmat’h
weeps and laments: "O lions! whose tongues can chant lamentations for
you! The sun has burned and consumed you heavenly stars. Alas for my
woes so great! Alas the sufferings of life!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="925">925</span></span>Those knights,
departed thence, travelled that day together. They came to the seashore,
there they tarried, they travelled not through dry land (?) That night
they parted not; again they shared their fire. They wept for the absence
from each other; they bewailed it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="926">926</span></span>Avt’handil said
to Tariel: "The channel of the flow of tears is dried! Why didst thou
separate from P’hridon, the giver of this steed? Thence are tidings and
means to be learnt regarding that beautiful sun. Now I go thither; teach
me the way to thy sworn brother."

<span class="margnote"><span id="927">927</span></span>Tariel teaches
him by word the direction of the road to P’hridon's. He made him
understand as well as he could by his power of speech: "Go towards the
east; fare even unto the seashore. If thou seest him tell him of me; he
will ask news of his brother."

<span class="margnote"><span id="928">928</span></span>They killed a
goat and dragged it after them, they made a fire on the seashore, they
sat down and ate such a meal as was fitting to their grief. That night
they were together; they lay together at the root of a tree. I curse
treacherous Fate, sometimes generous, sometimes niggardly.

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="929">929</span></span>At dawn they rose
to part, they embraced each other. The things said by them then would
have melted anyone who heard. They shed on the fields tears from the
eyes like waters from a spring. Long they stand in a close embrace;
breast was welded to breast.

<span class="margnote"><span id="930">930</span></span>With tears and
face-scratching and tearing of hair they parted; one goes up, the other
goes down; roadless they ride by bridle-paths through the rushes; as
long as they saw each other, with drawn faces they shouted; looking upon
their frowns the sun would frown too.
