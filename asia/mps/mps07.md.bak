### IV

### AVT’HANDIL SETS FORTH IN QUEST OF TARIEL

<span class="margnote"><span id="176">176</span></span> Dionosi the
wise, Ezros bear me witness in this: It is pitiable when the rose
wherewith the ruby of Badakhshan is not to be compared and whereto a
reedstem serves as form, becomes covered with rime and frost-bitten;
wherever he wanders abroad he is wearied of abodes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="177">177</span></span> Avt’handil
travelled over that plain at a flying pace, he left the bounds of the
Arabs, he journeyed in foreign lands; but separation from his sun had
taken away part of his life; he said: "If I were near her now I should
not shed hot tears."

<span class="margnote"><span id="178">178</span></span> Fresh snow had
fallen, and, freezing on the rose, blasted it. He wished to strike his
heart; sometimes he uplifted his knife. He said: "Fate (the world) has
increased my grief ninety, an hundred fold. I have gone away from all
rejoicing, from harp, lyre and pipe."

<span class="margnote"><span id="179">179</span></span> The rose
separated from its sun faded more and more. He said to his heart: "Be
patient!" Thus he fainted not wholly. He journeyed through passing
strange I places on his quest, he asked tidings of wayfarers, he was
friendly with them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="180">180</span></span> There seeks he
the shedder of tears which flowed to increase the sea. The land seems to
him a couch, his

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

arm his pillow. He says to himself: "O beloved, I am far from thee, my
heart stays with thee; I lament. for thy sake death would be joy to me."

<span class="margnote"><span id="181">181</span></span> He journeyed
over all the face of the earth, he went thoroughly over it, so that
beneath heaven was no place left where he had not been; but he met none
who had heard tidings of him he sought; meanwhile three years save three
months had passed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="182">182</span></span> He arrived in a
certain dreadful country, exceeding rough; for a month he saw no man, no
son of Adam. Neither Vis nor Ramin saw such woe like unto his. By day
and by night he thought of her, his beloved.

<span class="margnote"><span id="183">183</span></span> He reached as a
resting-place the slope of a great high mountain; thence appeared a
plain which it would take seven days to cross. At the foot of the
mountain flowed a river that could not be bridged; both sides were
covered down to the water's edge with forests.

<span class="margnote"><span id="184">184</span></span> He goes up,
turns round (?) and counts the time, the remaining days--he has two
months left. He sighs at this, he rejoices not. "Alas! if the thing were
revealed!" Again he is timid in heart by reason of this. No man can turn
evil to good; none can be born again of himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="185">185</span></span> He became
thoughtful; he stood to consider the matter. He said to himself: "If I
return thus, why have I spent so much time in the field? What can I dare
say to my star, how I have spent the days? I have learned not even
gossip regarding him I seek.

<span class="margnote"><span id="186">186</span></span> "If I return
not, I must spend yet more time in the quest, if I can learn no tidings
of him I seek; when

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

the time agreed upon with Shermadin is past, his cheeks will be bathed
(in tears), he will go and tell the king what soever things are fitting.

<span class="margnote"><span id="187">187</span></span> "He will tell
him of my death, as I myself bade him. Then would there be mourning,
weeping; bitter would the matter be for them. Thereafter should I return
after travelling everywhere." On this he thinks, weeping, distressed in
mind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="188">188</span></span> He said: "O God,
why make Thy judgments crooked because of me? why, alas! should I have
made such a journey in vain? Thou hast rooted up joys from my heart;
Thou hast given griefs a nest there. All my days my tears will never
cease."

<span class="margnote"><span id="189">189</span></span> Then he said,
"Patience is better," and communed thus with himself: "Let me not die a
day too soon, cast not down my heart; without God I can do nothing, my
tears flow in vain. No one can change that which is decreed; that which
is not to be will not be."

<span class="margnote"><span id="189a">189a</span></span> He said to
himself: "Die, for thee it is better than shameful life. Thou wilt go
back; T’hinat’hin, who brightens the sunny day, will meet thee; she will
ask thee for tidings of that sun; what does groaning avail?" Thus
thinking, he forthwith sets out for the reedy, watery edge of the wood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="190">190</span></span> "All beings
under the heavens have surely passed me by in turn, but regarding that
man nought can I learn anywhere. Doubtless they who called him a Kadj
spoke truth. Now tears avail me not; why should I weep in vain?"

<span class="margnote"><span id="190a">190a</span></span> Avt’handil
descended the mountain, he crossed river and woods, he put his steed to
a gallop towards the plain; the murmur of the water and trees annoys
him; his power (arms) and pride were spent; the crystal field

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

with the jetty growth was beautiful (*i.e.*, his face was beautified by
the growth of his beard).

<span class="margnote"><span id="191">191</span></span> He resolved to
return, he sighed and groaned; he turned towards the plain; he traced
out the road with his eyes; for a month he has seen no human being
anywhere; there were terrible wild beasts, but he hunted them not.

<span class="margnote"><span id="192">192</span></span> Though
Avt’handil was become wild with heart groaning and sighing, yet he
wished to eat, after the wont of Adam's race; he killed game with his
arrow, with arm longer than Rostom's; he alighted on the edge of the
reedy ground and kindled a fire with a steel.

<span class="margnote"><span id="193">193</span></span> He let his horse
pasture while he roasted the meat. He saw six horsemen coming towards
him. He said: They look like brigands; else what good is to be found? No
other human being has ever been here."

<span class="margnote"><span id="194">194</span></span> He took his bow
and arrow in his hand, and went gaily towards them. Two bearded men were
leading their beardless brother, his head was wounded, his heart had
swooned from loss of blood; they wept and grieved, his poor spirit was
almost fled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="195">195</span></span> He called out:
"Brothers, who are ye? I took you for brigands." They replied: "Be calm,
help us and put out the fire; if thou canst not help us, add grief to
our grief, and make it complete; weep with us who need pity, scratch thy
cheeks too."

<span class="margnote"><span id="196">196</span></span> Avt’handil
approached; he spoke to the men with the grieved hearts. They told him
their story, speaking with tears: "We are three brothers, for this we
shed bitter tears; we have a large fortified town in the region of
Khataet’hi.

<span class="margnote"><span id="197">197</span></span> "We heard of
good hunting ground, we went forth

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

to the chase, countless soldiers accompanied us, we dismounted on the
bank of a stream; the hunting pleased us, for a month we went not away;
we killed wild beasts without measure in the plain, on the mountain and
on the ridge.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="198">198</span></span> "We three
brothers shamed the archers with us, so we three vied still one with
another: 'I kill best, I am better than thou,' thus each pushed his
claim with words; we could not manifest the truth, we wrangled, we
strove with one another (none wanted to be last).

<span class="margnote"><span id="199">199</span></span> "To-day we sent
away the soldiers loaded with stags’ hides. We said among ourselves:
'Let us judge truly who of us is mightier with his arm.' We remained
alone, we were private, we killed in our own sight, we shot not before
onlookers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="200">200</span></span> "We had three
armour-bearers (squires) with us; we ordered the soldiers to go away,
mistrusting nought; we hunted over plain, through wood and den, we
slaughtered the wild beast, and not even a bird flew up.

<span class="margnote"><span id="201">201</span></span> "Suddenly there
appeared a knight, morose and gloomy of visage, seated on a black horse,
black as Pegasus; his head and form were clad in a panther's skin with
the fur outside, and beauty such as his has ne’er been seen by man
before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="202">202</span></span> "We gazed upon
his rays, we scarce could support the brightness, we said: 'He is a sun
on the earth; we cannot say (there is a sun) in heaven.' We wished to
seize him, we were venturesome and tried; this is the cause of our
sighs, moans, weeping.

<span class="margnote"><span id="203">203</span></span> "I, the eldest,
earnestly begged the man from the younger, my next brother asked for his
horse as a keepsake, this one only asked leave to conquer him. We
granted him this as his due. As we went towards him he came forward
unchanged, calmly and in beauty.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="204">204</span></span> "Ruby mingled
with crystal beautified the pale roses (of his cheeks). He withered up
tender thoughts towards us, he explained nothing, neither did he let us
go, he showed not any consideration for us at all, with his whip he
ripened us who had spoken tartly to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="205">205</span></span> "We gave him
over to our youngest brother, we elders kept back, he seized upon him
(and said): 'Stand!' Thus he spake to him with his tongue. He (Tariel)
held no sword in his hand, so we moved away; he struck him on the head
with his whip, we saw the blood flow indeed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="206">206</span></span> "With a stroke
of his whip he cleft his head thus, like a corpse he became lifeless,
like earth he was brought to earth; thus he humbled, levelled with the
ground, him who had been audacious to him. Before our eyes he went away,
bold, severe and haughty.

<span class="margnote"><span id="207">207</span></span> "He turned not
back again; he went away quietly and without haste. Lo! there he
rides--look! like the sun and moon." The weeping ones joylessly showed
him far off to Avt’handil; there only appeared his black steed carrying
along that sun.

<span class="margnote"><span id="208">208</span></span> Behold, it
befell Avt’handil that his cheeks need no longer be covered with snow
from tears, since he had not passed so much time abroad in vain; when a
man attains the thing wished for, when he must find what he sought, then
need he no longer remember past woes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="209">209</span></span> He said:
"Brothers, I am a wanderer without a place. To seek that knight I have
gone far from the home of my upbringing. Now from you I have learned
what it was by no means easy to discover. May God never again give you
cause to grieve.

<span class="margnote"><span id="210">210</span></span> "As I meet my
wish, my heart's desire, so even may God not let your brother suffer."
He showed them his resting-place. "Go at your ease," said he, "give him
repose in the shade, rest your weary selves."

<span class="margnote"><span id="211">211</span></span> Thus he spoke
and went his way, he spurred on his horse, he flew like a hawks not
hindered by the string,

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

or like the moon meeting the sun, the sun of heavenly light, for this
cause he has extinguished his burning fires.

<span class="margnote"><span id="212">212</span></span> He drew nearer,
he bethought himself how he might contrive the meeting: "Senseless
converse yet more enrages a madman. If a wise man would compass a
difficult deed, he must not lose his presence of mind and tranquillity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="213">213</span></span> "Since yon man
is so unreasoning and dazed that he suffers not any to speak with him or
look on him, if I go up we shall meet only to slaughter each other,
either he will kill me or I shall kill him; he will be still more
hidden."

<span class="margnote"><span id="214">214</span></span> Avt’handil said:
"Why should I suffer so many woes in vain? Whatever he is, it cannot be
that he has no nests; let him go whithersoever he will, whatever walls
encompass him there shall I seek him if my powers fail not."

<span class="margnote"><span id="215">215</span></span> Two days and
nights they fared, one behind, one before, wearied by day and by night,
eating no food; nowhere they paused, not one moment of time, from their
eyes tears flowed, moistening the plains.

<span class="margnote"><span id="216">216</span></span> One day they
travelled, and at eventide high rocks appeared. In the rocks were caves,
in front a stream flowed down, it was not possible to say how many
rushes were at the water's edge, tall trees whose tops eye could not
reach rose high against the rock.

<span class="margnote"><span id="217">217</span></span> The knight made
for the cave; he passed the streams and rocks. Avt’handil alighted from
his horse, he betook himself to the great trees, he climbed up to look,
at the foot he tethered his horse, thence he watched; that knight went
shedding tears.

<span class="margnote"><span id="218">218</span></span> When the knight,
the panther-skin-clad, passed the

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

woods, a maiden dressed in a black mantle came forth to the door of the
cave, she wept aloud, her tears uniting with the sea; the knight
dismounted, with his arms he embraced her neck.

<span class="margnote"><span id="218a">218a</span></span> The knight
said: "Sister Asmat’h, our bridges are fallen into the sea (*i.e.*, we
are lost); we shall never, timely, come upon the track of her for whom
fires burn us." Thus he spoke and beat his hands upon his breast; the
tears rained down. The maiden swooned, he embraced her; they wiped each
other's tears of blood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="219">219</span></span> The forest
became thicker from the tearing of their hair; each embraced the other,
the youth the maid, and the maid the youth; they wailed, they lamented,
the rocks re-echoed their voices; Avt’handil gazed in wonder on their
behaviour.

<span class="margnote"><span id="220">220</span></span> That maid
composed her soul, she endured the wound of her heart, she led the steed
into the cave, she took off its trappings, she unbuckled the knight, she
ungirded his armour. They went in. That day passed to its close.

<span class="margnote"><span id="221">221</span></span> Avt’handil was
surprised. "How am I to know this story?" said he. Day dawned. The
maiden came forth clad in the same colour; she put the bridle on the
black (horse), she furbished it (the bridle) with the end of her veil;
she saddled it, she carries the armour quietly, with no clattering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="222">222</span></span> It was the
custom, it seems, with that knight never to tarry longer. The maiden
wept and beat her breast, she tore her thick hair; they embraced each
other, he kissed her and mounted his horse. Asmat’h, already gloomy,
became still more gloomy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="223">223</span></span> Avt’handil once
more saw near him the face of that man, his moustaches had hardly grown,
he was without

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

a beard. "Is it not the sun of heaven?" said he. He smelt the smell of
the aloe wafted on the wind. For him the killing of a lion was just as
easy as for a lion to kill a goat.

<span class="margnote"><span id="224">224</span></span> He rode out the
same road he had come in by the day before, he passed the rushes, he
went beyond, far into the plain. Avt’handil gazed in wonder; secretly he
was hidden in the tree. He said: "God has managed this matter exceeding
well for me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="225">225</span></span> "How could God
have done better for me than this? I will seize the maid, I will make
her tell me the story of that knight; I shall also tell her all mine, I
shall make her know the truth. I shall not smite the knight with the
sword, nor shall I have to be pierced by him."

<span class="margnote"><span id="226">226</span></span> He came down and
loosed his horse, which he had tied to the tree, he mounted and rode up;
the door of the cave was open, the heart-shaken, tear-flooded maiden ran
out thence; she thought the rose-faced, crystal-haloed one was come
back.

<span class="margnote"><span id="227">227</span></span> She knew not the
face, it was not like the face of that knight; swiftly she turned, with
a cry she made for rock and tree; the knight leaped from his horse,
seized her like a partridge in a net; the rocks resounded with the
maid's monotonous cry.

<span class="margnote"><span id="228">228</span></span> She yielded not
to that knight; even the sight of him was hateful. Like a partridge
under an eagle she fluttered hither and thither; she called on a certain
Tariel for help, but he succoured her not. Avt’handil threw himself on
his knees; he entreated her with his fingers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="229">229</span></span> He said: "Hush!
what (ill) can I do thee? I am a man of Adam's race. I have seen those
roses and violets grown pale. Tell me something of him. Who is the
cypress-formed, the halo-faced? I shall do nought else to thee, be
comforted, cry not thus loudly."

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="230">230</span></span> The weeping
girl, like a suppliant for justice, said: "If thou be not mad, let me
go; if thou art mad, return to reason. Now thou lightly askest me to
tell thee a very hard matter; try not in vain, look not to me to tell
his story."

<span class="margnote"><span id="231">231</span></span> Again she said:
"O knight, what wilt thou, or what dost thou request of me? This thing
cannot be even written with the pen. Once thou shalt say 'Tell me!' a
hundred times I shall tell thee 'No!' As smiling is better than weeping,
so I prefer mourning to song."

<span class="margnote"><span id="232">232</span></span> "Maiden, thou
knowest not whence I come, what woes I have endured! For as long as I
have sought tidings, from none have I heard them. I have found thee;
however much my words may annoy thee, I cannot let thee go till thou
tell me. Be not bashful with me."

<span class="margnote"><span id="233">233</span></span> The maiden said:
"Why have I fallen in with thee? Who am I? or who art thou? The sun is
not near me, this thou knewest, O hoarfrost, therefore thou thus
annoyest me; long discourse is tedious, so I shall speak shortly to
thee; on no account shall I tell thee aught, do whatsoever thou wilt."

<span class="margnote"><span id="234">234</span></span> Yet again he
adjured her, he threw himself on his knees before her, but nought could
he win from her; he wearied of entreaty, his indignation mounted to his
face, blood flowed to his eyes, he arose, he drew her by the hair, he
put a knife to her throat.

<span class="margnote"><span id="235">235</span></span> Thus he spoke:
"How can I forgive thee so much ill-will? If I weep, shall the tear be
in vain? It is better for thee to tell me, I shall trouble thee no more;
if not, may God slay mine enemy as I slay thee!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="236">236</span></span> The maid
replied: "Thou hast done exceeding ill to think of using force. If thou
kill me not I shall not die; I am hale and alive. Why shall I tell thee
anything until the time when I shall no longer see woes, and if thou
kill me I shall have no head to converse with thee."

<span class="margnote"><span id="237">237</span></span> Again she said:
"Oh, why didst thou find me! who

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

art thou that speakest with me? Who? I cannot be made to tell this story
with living tongue. I will make thee kill me at mine own wish; like a
despised letter, easily shalt thou tear me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="238">238</span></span> "Think not that
death would be suffering to me, for it would free me from weeping; it is
the drier-up of the ford of tears; the whole world seems to me as straw,
even so do I weigh it; I know not who thou art, that I should tell thee
trusty words?"

<span class="margnote"><span id="239">239</span></span> The knight said
(to himself): "Thus shall I not make her speak, I must think of some
other way; it is better to ponder the matter." He let her go, and sat
down apart; he wept, he began to shed tears. He said to the maiden: "I
have angered thee; now I know not, alas! how I shall survive."

<span class="margnote"><span id="240">240</span></span> The maiden sat
morose, she is sulky, she is not yet sweetened. Avt’handil sits below
weeping; no longer does he speak. In the rose-garden the pool of tears
is dammed up. The maiden, too, weeps over yonder, her heart! softening
towards him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="241">241</span></span> She pitied the
weeping knight, therefore her hot tears flowed, but she sat, strange to
the stranger, she spoke not. The knight perceived that her hasty
thoughts towards him were calmed; with flowing tears he entreated her;
he arose and bent his knee before her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="242">242</span></span> He said: "I know
that now I am by no means worthy to hope from thee; I have angered thee;
I remain a stranger to thee and thus lonely; yet even now I have hope
for myself from thee, for it is said that sin shall be forgiven unto
seven times.

<span class="margnote"><span id="243">243</span></span> "Though my
beginning in service has pleased thee ill, it is fitting to pity the
lover; understand thou this: from any other, whomsoever, I can have no
aid, none is

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

my strength. I yield thee my life for my heart's sake. What more can I
do?"

<span class="margnote"><span id="244">244</span></span> When the maid
heard from the knight of his love, with heart sobs she began to shed
tears a hundredfold snore; again she raised her voice in wailing, she
smiled not. God gave Avt’handil his wish, his heart's comfort.

<span class="margnote"><span id="245">245</span></span> He said (to
himself): "These words have changed her colour; doubtless her tears flow
faster (for that) she is mad for someone." He spoke once more: "O
sister, a lover is pitied even by his foes; thou, too, knowest that he
himself seeks death, he shuns it not.

<span class="margnote"><span id="246">246</span></span> "I am a lover, a
madman to whom life is unbearable. My sun sent me to seek that knight.
Even a cloud could not reach me where I have been on that quest. I have
found thy heart; his to thee, thine to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="247">247</span></span> "His face I have
imprinted on my heart like a (holy) picture. For him mad, cut off, have
I given up all my joy. One of two things do thou to me: make me a
prisoner or set me free, give me life or slay me, adding grief to
grief."

<span class="margnote"><span id="248">248</span></span> The maiden spoke
to the knight a word more pleasant than her first: "What thou hast now
thought of is much better; just now thou didst sow enmity in my heart,
now thou hast found in me a friend more sisterly than a sister.

<span class="margnote"><span id="248a">248a</span></span>. "Then, since
thou hast thought of love as thine aid, henceforth it will not be that I
shall not be thy servant; if I devote not myself to thee, I shall make
thee mad, I shall make thee sad; I shall die for thy sake if I find not
some means to help thee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="249">249</span></span> "Now, whatever I
tell thee, if thou wilt be obedient to me therein thou shalt meet
whatever thou seekest, thou shalt certainly not fail; if thou hearkenest
not to me thou shalt not find, let thy tears flow as they will;
discontent with the world shall come upon thee, thou shalt die, thou
shalt be put to shame."

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="250">250</span></span> The knight
replied: "This only resembles one thing (This is like a certain story):
Two men were journeying somewhere along some road; the one who was
behind saw the one in front fall into a well. He came up, called. down,
weeps and cries 'Woe!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="251">251</span></span> "Thus he spoke:
'Comrade, stay there, wait for me; I go to bring ropes, I want to pull
thee out.' The man who was beneath laughed, he marvelled greatly, he
shouted up: 'Unless I wait, whither can I flee from thee, whither can I
go?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="252">252</span></span> "Now, sister,
thou holdest the rope about my neck; without thee I can undertake
nothing; whatever thou doest to me rests with thee, thou art balm to the
mad. Otherwise who would bind his sound head with hay-ropes? (? like a
madman)."

<span class="margnote"><span id="253">253</span></span> The maid
replied: "Thy discourse, O knight, pleases me. Doubtless thou art some
good knight, worthy of the praise of the wise. Since thou hast heretofor
suffered such griefs, hearken to what I tell thee, and thou I shalt find
what thou seekest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="253a">253a</span></span> "Nowhere can
news of that knight be found. If he himself tell thee not it will not be
told; none other shouldst thou believe. If thou canst wait so long, wait
until he come. Be calm; freeze not the rose, let it not be snowed up in
tears.

<span class="margnote"><span id="254">254</span></span> "I will tell
thee our names if thou wishest to know them: Tariel is the name of that
distracted knight; I am called Asmat’h, whom the hot fire burns, sigh
upon sigh, not once alone, but many times.

<span class="margnote"><span id="255">255</span></span> "More words
about him than these I cannot tell. thee. The elegant, slender-formed
roams the plain. I eat, alas! alone of the meat brought by him from the
chase. He may come anon, I know not, or he may tarry a long time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="256">256</span></span> "I entreat thee
to wait; go not elsewhere. When; he comes I shall plead with him; it may
be I shall be able to do something. I shall make you known to each other

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I shall make him
love thee. He himself will tell thee his story; thou shalt make thy
beloved to rejoice."

<span class="margnote"><span id="257">257</span></span> The knight
listened to the maid, he was obedient, be submitted. Thereupon they
looked round, they heard a splash from the glen, they saw the moon
(*i.e.*, Tariel) come forth from the water, its rays beaming. They
hastened back; they made no long tarrying there.

<span class="margnote"><span id="258">258</span></span> The maid said:
"O knight, God give thee soon what thou desirest; but make thyself
unseen, hide thyself inside. No human being is disobedient to that
knight; perchance I may so contrive that the sight of thee anger him
not."

<span class="margnote"><span id="259">259</span></span> The maiden
hastily hid Avt’handil secretly in the cave. That knight alighted from
his horse; his quiver and sword adorn him. They wept aloud, their tears
flowing even to the sea. Avt’handil gazed from the window, himself
hidden from view.

<span class="margnote"><span id="260">260</span></span> The bath of
tears turned the crystal to the colour of jasper. A long time the knight
and that black-robed maiden wept. She unbuckled his armour and took it
in; she also led in the horse. They were silent; the black knife of jet
(of their eyelashes) cut off the (flow of) tears.

<span class="margnote"><span id="261">261</span></span> Avt’handil
watched from the window, a prisoner but now freed from his dungeon. The
maid laid down the panther's skin, the knight sat upon it, he sighs with
added grief; the jetty eyelashes are plaited by tears of blood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="262">262</span></span> That maiden
betook herself to the lighting of a gentle fire with a steel; she
thought he would eat meat roasted, (a bird cooked) whole; she gave it to
him, he bit off a piece, it was difficult for him to eat, he had no
appetite; he began to spit it out unchewed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="263">263</span></span> He lay down a
little, he fell asleep, but only for a short time; he was afraid, he
screamed aloud, he leaped up as if dazed, he cried and incessantly beat
his breast

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

with a stone and his head with a stick; the maiden sits apart looking at
him, ands scratches her face.

<span class="margnote"><span id="264">264</span></span> "Why hast thou
returned?" she asked. "Tell me what has happened to thee." He answered:
"I came upon a certain king hunting; he had countless soldiers, heavy
weighed their baggage, he hunted in that plain where beaters were
scattered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="265">265</span></span> "It was
melancholy for me to see men, the fire flamed up still more; I came not
near to meet him; I pitied myself. I returned pale from them. I hid in
the wood. I thought: 'If he pursues me no more, I shall go away at
daybreak to-morrow.'"

<span class="margnote"><span id="266">266</span></span> The maiden's
tears sprang forth an hundredfold, ten thousandfold more. She said:
"Thou roamest alone with wild beasts in the deep forest, thou
approachest no man for converse and entertainment; thou canst not help
her thus; why dost thou waste thy days in vain?

<span class="margnote"><span id="267">267</span></span> "Thou hast fared
over the whole face of the earth; how couldst thou not find one man in
whom to take pleasure, and who could be with thee without making thee
mad, though it would not lessen thy grief? If thou diest and she
perishes, what doth this profit thee?"

<span class="margnote"><span id="268">268</span></span> He said: "O
sister, this is like thy heart, but for this wound there is no balm upon
earth. Who can find such a man as hath not yet come into the world? My
joy is death, the severance of flesh and soul.

<span class="margnote"><span id="269">269</span></span> "Where, why
should God cause a man to be born under the same planet as I, even if I
desired his companionship and converse! Who could bear my woes, or even
attempt it? Save thee, sister, I have no human being anywhere."

<span class="margnote"><span id="270">270</span></span> The maid said:
"Be not angry with me, I fear and entreat thee; since God has appointed
me thy vizier, I cannot conceal the best that I know in the matter: to
go to extremes is of no use; thou hast overstepped the bounds."

<span class="margnote"><span id="271">271</span></span> The knight
replied: "I know not what thou askest

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

of me; tell me clearly. How can I create a man for my service without
God? God needs me to be unhappy; what can I do? Of a truth I am become
as a wild beast, to this pass have I brought myself."

<span class="margnote"><span id="272">272</span></span> The maid again
spoke: "I have harassed thee with overmuch advice, but if I could find a
man who would come to thee of his own freewill, who would stay near
thee, who would rejoice thee by his acquaintance, wilt thou swear not to
kill him nor do him any hurt?"

<span class="margnote"><span id="273">273</span></span> He answered: "If
thou wilt show him to me, greatly shall I rejoice at sight of him. (I
swear) by the love of her for whose sake I wander mad in the fields, I
shall do nought unpleasing, I shall never cause any bitterness to him; I
shall be pleasant and love him, and do all I can to be amiable."

<span class="margnote"><span id="274">274</span></span> The maid rose
and went to bring that knight. "He is not angry," quoth she, to
encourage him. She took him by the hand and led him forth, like the full
moon. When Tariel saw him he thought him like the sun.

<span class="margnote"><span id="275">275</span></span> Tariel met him.
They were both fit to be ranked as suns, or as the moon in heaven,
cloudless, spreading her rays on the plain beneath. Compared with them
the aloe-tree was of no worth; they were like the seven planets; to what
else shall I liken them?

<span class="margnote"><span id="276">276</span></span> They kissed each
other, they were not bashful at being strangers; they opened the rose,
from their lips their white teeth shone transparent. They embraced each
other's neck, together they wept; their jacinth, which was worth rubies,
they turned into amber.

<span class="margnote"><span id="277">277</span></span> The knight
turned, he grasped Avt’handil's hand in his hand; they sat down
together, and wept long with hot tears. Asmat’h calmed them with
wonderful words: "Slay not yourselves; darken not the sun with your
eclipse."

<span class="margnote"><span id="278">278</span></span> Tariel's rose
was only covered with a light frost, not frozen. He said to
(Avt’handil): "Haste, tell me thy secret. Who art thou? Whence art thou
come? Where is thy

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

home? As for me, death has forgotten me; even by it am I abandoned."

<span class="margnote"><span id="279">279</span></span> Avt’handil gave
answer; beautiful are his words: "O lion and hero Tariel, thou who
behavest gently, I am an Arabian, from the court of Arabia; I am
consumed by love, unquenchable fire burns me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="280">280</span></span> "I love the
daughter of my lord; her lusty-armed servants now view her as their
king. Though thou knowest me not, I have seen thee, if thou wilt call it
to mind. Dost thou remember when thou slewest the strong-armed  slaves?

<span class="margnote"><span id="281">281</span></span> "We saw thee
roaming in the plain, and we came upon thee. My lord was angry with
thee, and we quarrelled fiercely with thee. We called thee, thou earnest
not, we pursued thee with soldiers; thou didst dye the fields crimson
with the blood thou madest to flow.

<span class="margnote"><span id="282">282</span></span> "Thou didst cut
the heads of all with a whip, without a sword. The king mounted, thou
wert lost to us, we could . not cut off thy track; like a Kadj thou wert
hidden, the slaves were terrified. This enraged us still more; we were
completely stunned.

<span class="margnote"><span id="283">283</span></span> "The king became
gloomy; you know that a monarch also has humours. They looked for thee,
they sought thee everywhere, they wrote a letter of command. They could
find none who had seen thee, neither young nor old. Now she has sent me,
she to whom neither sun nor ether is to be compared.

<span class="margnote"><span id="284">284</span></span> "She said to me:
'Learn for me news of that vanished sun; then will I do that which thou
desirest.' She told me that for three years the stream of tears was to
flow without her; dost thou not marvel that I could bear the lack of the
sight of her smile?

<span class="margnote"><span id="285">285</span></span> "Until now I
have seen no man who saw thee. I saw

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

robbers who spoke rudely with you; thou didst strike them with thy whip;
one thou madest like a corpse; they whose brother was dying told me."

<span class="margnote"><span id="286">286</span></span> Tariel recalled
their bygone fight. He said: "I remember the affair, though it happened
long ago. I saw thee and thy master together at the chase. I was weeping
because I was thinking, alas! of my destroyer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="287">287</span></span> "What did you
want with me? What did you desire? What had we in common? You, mighty,
were sporting; we bathed our cheeks in tears. When you set the slaves
upon me you dared to take me; now, methinks, instead of capturing me you
bare away corpses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="288">288</span></span> "I looked round
when I saw thy lord approach me, I had pity on his kingship; therefore I
laid not my hands upon him, I fled before your eyes, I said nothing. My
horse looks invisible: in what other way shall I describe him?

<span class="margnote"><span id="289">289</span></span> "Before a man
can blink or wink the eye, I can flee that which I know to be
unpleasant. Those Turks, on the other hand, I did not consider myself
unjust to them; their overbearance and my prowess ill became them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="290">290</span></span> "Now thou art
come with good intent, the sight of thy face rejoices me, O
cypress-formed, sunlike-faced, brave as a hero; but thou hast toiled,
thou art not untried by trouble; hard is it to find a man (like me)
abandoned by God in heaven."

<span class="margnote"><span id="291">291</span></span> Avt’handil said:
"How dost thou praise me, thou worthy of the praise of the tongue of the
wise? What am I to deserve such praise from thee? Thou art the image of
the one sun, the light of heaven above, for the misery of the flowing of
so many tears cannot change thee.

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="292">292</span></span> "This day has
made me forget her who darkened (by eclipse) my heart. I renounce her
service; as for that, it shall be as thou wishest. Thus, though a
jacinth is better, still a thousand times more do I desire glass. I
shall stay near thee till death; more than this I desire not."

<span class="margnote"><span id="293">293</span></span> Tariel said:
"Thy heart now is warm to me. I am amazed. What service worthy of thine
attachment have I done for thee? But such is the law: lover pities
lover. Thou art parted from thy beloved; what can recompense thee for
this

<span class="margnote"><span id="294">294</span></span> "Thou art come
forth to seek me in thy lady's service. God has made thee find me. Thou
also hast endeavoured manfully. But how shall I tell thee why I am thus
wandering? If I speak of it, hot fire will burn me; I shall become a
flame, a smoke."

<span class="margnote"><span id="295">295</span></span> Upon this Tariel
was silent, burned and enflamed. He said to Asmat’h: "Since thou hast
been near me all the time, how dost thou not know that this bruised
bruise is incurable? Anew this weeping knight burns me; I am his debtor
for tears."

<span class="margnote"><span id="296">296</span></span> He said to the
knight: "Whatever man takes to himself a brother--ay, or a sister--must
have no care of death and trouble for their sake. How should God save
the one if He cause not the other to perish? Listen, and I shall tell
thee (my story) whatever befall me."

<span class="margnote"><span id="297">297</span></span> He said to
Asmat’h: "Come, sit down here, bring water with thee, sprinkle me when
fainting, bathe my breast. If thou seest me a corpse, weep for me, sob
ceaselessly, dig a grave for me, here let the earth cradle me."

<span class="margnote"><span id="298">298</span></span> He sat down
unbuttoned to tell his tale; he laid

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

bare his shoulders. Like the sun clad in clouds he sat; a long time he
shed no ray. He could not open his lips to speak; he clenched them. Then
he drew his breath, cried out, hot tears gushed forth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="299">299</span></span> He sobbed: "O
beloved, mine own, lost to me! My hope and life, my thought, my soul, my
heart! Who cut thee off I know not, O tree planted in Eden! How can the
hot fire not consume thee, O heart a hundred times kindled!
