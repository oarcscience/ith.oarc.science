<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="596">596</A></FONT></span>"He was healed, and able to fight and use horse and armour. We prepared galleys and the number of a host of troops; it needed a man to pray (to God) for some aid</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_95"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 95</FONT></A></p>  
<p>for those who gazed upon them.--Now will I tell thee of that knight's battle, the punisher of his adversaries.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="597">597</A></FONT></span>"I perceived their design, and saw them donning their headgear. Ships met me, I know not if there were eight (in all); swiftly I threw myself upon then; they began to row; I struck (one of the ships) with my heel and upset it; like women they bewailed themselves.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="598">598</A></FONT></span>"I betook myself to yet another, and seized the lip (prow) of the ship with my hand; I drowned them in the sea, I slew them; they had no opportunity for battle. The rest fled from me, they made for their harbour; all who saw me marvelled, they praised me, they hated me not.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="599">599</A></FONT></span>"We crossed the sea, we landed. Mounted they threw themselves on us. Again we engaged; there began the vicissitudes of battle. P&#8217;hridon's bravery and agility pleased me then; in warfare a lion, in face a sun, that aloe-tree fought.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="600">600</A></FONT></span>"With his sword he cast down both his cousins, he cut their hands clean off; thus he crippled them; he led them away bound by the arms; the one did not abandon the two. He made their knights to weep, his knights to vaunt themselves.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="601">601</A></FONT></span>"Their soldiers fled from us, we threw ourselves upon them, we scattered them; swiftly we seized the city, we wasted no time; we broke their legs with stones, we tanned their skin into leather. Kill me, if it was possible to empty the treasure both by lading and stowing!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="602">602</A></FONT></span>"P&#8217;hridon inspected the treasures and put his seals upon them; he himself led away his two vanquished cousins; he shed their blood in exchange for his, and</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_96"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 96</FONT></A></p>  
<p>poured it out on the fields. Of me they said: 'Thanks God who has planted aloe-trees!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="603">603</A></FONT></span>"We went back (to P&#8217;hridon's). The triumph exhibited by the citizens was heard; suppliants there laid hold on the heart of beholders. All uttered praise to me and Nuradin, in a panegyric; they said to us: 'Through the strength of your (right) arms their blood still flows!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="604">604</A></FONT></span>"The soldiers acclaimed P&#8217;hridon as king and me as king of kings, themselves as subjects and me as sovereign of them all. I was gloomy, they could never find me culling roses; they knew not my story, there it was not lightly spoken of.</p>
