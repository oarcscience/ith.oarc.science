### XLII

### TARIEL AND AVT’HANDIL GO TO P’HRIDON

<span class="margnote"><span id="1350">1350</span></span>When day dawned
they set out; they took Asmat’h with them. Till they came to Nuradin's
land they mounted her behind them; there a merchant gave them a horse
for a price in gold, he made not a gift of it. As guide Avt’handil
sufficed; whom else need he take!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1351">1351</span></span>They wended
their way and met with Nuradin's herdsmen, they saw the herd (of
horses); it pleased them, who had come for P’hridon. There said the
Hindoo to

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Avt’handil: "I
will have thee do a good piece of fooling: Come, let us play a joke on
P’hridon, let us chase his herd.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1352">1352</span></span>"We will carry
off the herd, he will come and hear that the herd is reived; he will
prepare to do battle, to dye the plain with gore. Suddenly he will
recognize us, he will be surprised, he will calm his heart. Pleasant is
good joking; it makes even the proud merry."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1353">1353</span></span>They began to
seize the steeds, P’hridon's finest. There the herdsmen made a torch,
they struck steel. They shouted: "Who are ye, knights, who do such high
(-handed) deeds? This herd is his who strikes the foe with his sword
without making him to sigh."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1354">1354</span></span>They seized
their bows, they pursued the herdsmen; the herdsmen shrieked aloud, they
raised their voices: "Help, help! brigands are massacring us!" They made
an outcry, they united, they appealed to P’hridon, they were not
bashful.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1355">1355</span></span>P’hridon
arrayed himself, he mounted, he rode forth in full array. They made an
outcry, they united, the regiment covered the fields. Those suns whom
winter could not freeze came forward; they were covered up, helmets hid
their faces.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1356">1356</span></span>When Tariel
knew P’hridon, "Now have I seen him I want," said he; he raised his
helm, he smiled, he laughed; he said to P’hridon: "What dost thou wish?
Why doth our coming annoy thee? Bad host! Thou meetest us to fight."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1357">1357</span></span>P’hridon
swiftly dismounted; he fell down and saluted. They also alighted, they
embraced--ay, kissed him. P’hridon with upraised hand gave God
measureless thanks. The magnates also kissed them, whoever knew them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1358">1358</span></span>P’hridon said:
"Why tarried ye? I expected ye sooner. I am ready; I shall not lag in
any service of

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

yours!" It seemed as if two suns and a moon were united there; they
beautified one another. They set out, they departed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1359">1359</span></span>At P’hridon's
fairly-builded house they both alighted; he sits down beside his sworn
brother Avt’handil; Tariel sat on a throne covered in cloth of gold. To
P’hridon, renowned as a hero, they presented that armour.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1360">1360</span></span>They said: "At
this time we have no other gifts for thee, but we have many other fair
things lying in a place (we wot of)." He laid his face to the ground, he
wasted not time: "Such a gift to me is worthy of you."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1361">1361</span></span>That night they
rested as P’hridon's guests; baths he gave them, he gave them gifts of
garments in plenty, he clad their beauty in beauty, each (garment)
fairer than the other; he gave them rare jewels and pearls in a golden
basin.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1362">1362</span></span>He said: "This
(that I am about to say) is the speech of a bad host; ’tis as if
hospitality to you wise (ones) wearied me as if you were mad (ones); but
tarrying now avails not, it is better to travel the long road; if the
Kadjis outstrip us there is a risk of trouble.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1363">1363</span></span>"Why should we
use great hosts? We want good and few; three hundred men suffice us, let
us go (swift) like runaways; in Kadjet’hi for fighting the Kadjis we
shall put basket-hilts on our swords; soon shall we find her whose
pleasant aloe form will slay us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1364">1364</span></span>"Once aforetime
I was in Kadjet’hi; you shall see it, and you, too, shall find it
strong; on all sides round about is rock, a foe may not come up to it;
if we may not go in privily, it is impossible to engage openly; so we
need no army, the squadron cannot follow us secretly."

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1365">1365</span></span>With what he
said, they too agreed. They left there the maiden Asmat’h; P’hridon
bestows a gift upon her. They took with them three hundred horsemen
equal to heroes. At the last God will give the victory to all who have
been distressed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1366">1366</span></span>All three sworn
brothers crossed the sea. P’hridon knows the way; going day and night
they travel. P’hridon said: "Now are we coming nigh the regions of
Kadjet’hi; henceforth we must travel by night so that we be not
discovered."

<span class="margnote"><span id="1367">1367</span></span>The three
behaved according to this advice of P’hridon's; when it was daylight
they stopped, and by night they went swiftly on. They arrived; the city
appeared; they could not count the guards; outside was a rock, the noise
of the sentinels in crowds increased.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1368">1368</span></span>At the gate of
the passage ten thousand braves kept guard. Those lions saw the city;
the shining moon stood upon it. They said: "Let us advise what is best,
now is choice difficult; a hundred can overcome a thousand if they
choose the best way."
