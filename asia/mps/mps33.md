### AVT’HANDIL'S ARRIVAL AT P’HATMAN'S; HER RECEPTION OF HIM AND HER JOY

<span class="margnote"><span id="1054">1054</span></span>P’hatman,
Usen's wife, met him in front of the door, joyful she saluted him, she
showed her pleasure; they greeted each other, they went in and seated
themselves. As I have observed, his coming annoyed not Dame P’hatman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1055">1055</span></span>Dame P’hatman
was attractive to the eye, not young but brisk, of a good figure, dark
in complexion, plump-faced, not wizened, a lover of (female) minstrels
and singers, a wine-drinker; she had abundance of elegant gowns and
head-dresses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1056">1056</span></span>That night Dame
P’hatman entertained him right well. The knight presented beautiful
gifts; they that received them said: "They are worthy!" P’hatman's
entertainment of him was worth while; by God! she lost not. When they
had drunken and eaten, the knight went outs to sleep.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1057">1057</span></span>In the morning
he showed all his wares, he had them all unpacked; the fairest were laid
aside for the king, he had the price counted out; he said to the
merchants: "Take them away!" He loaded them, (and) had them carried
away. He said: "Sell as ye will; reveal not who I am!"

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1058">1058</span></span>The knight was
clad as a merchant; he was by no means dressed in his proper raiment.
Sometimes P’hatman calls on him, sometimes he visits P’hatman. They sat
together; they conversed with refined discourse. Absence from him was
death to P’hatman, as Ramin's was to Vis. <span
