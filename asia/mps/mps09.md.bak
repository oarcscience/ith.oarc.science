### VI

### TARIEL TELLS THE TALE OF HIS FALLING IN LOVE WHEN HE FIRST FELL IN LOVE

<span class="margnote"><span id="328">328</span></span>When he had wept
for some time he again began to tell his tale: "One day the king and I
had come home from the chase, and he said: 'Let us see my daughter!'

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He took me by the
hand. . . . Does it not surprise thee that I live when I remember that
time?

<span class="margnote"><span id="329">329</span></span>"I saw the garden
fairer indeed than all places of delight: the voice of birds was heard,
sweeter than a siren's, there were many fountains of rose-water for
baths, over the door were hung curtains of cloth of gold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="330">330</span></span>"The king ordered
me to take some wood-partridges and carry them to the maiden. I took
them and went to burn myself at a flame. Then I began to pay the debt of
Fate. It needs a lance of adamant to pierce a heart of rock.

<span class="margnote"><span id="331">331</span></span>"I knew he wished
none to see his sunlike one; I stood outside, and the king went in
through the curtain of the door; I could see nothing, I only heard the
sound of talk; he commanded Asmat’h to take the partridges from the
Amirbar.

<span class="margnote"><span id="332">332</span></span>"Asmat’h drew
aside the curtain; I stood outside the curtain. I saw the maiden
(Nestan); a lance pierced my mind and heart. (Asmat’h) came, I gave her
the partridges, she took them from me who was burned with fire. Ah me!
since then in eternal furnace I burn!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="333">333</span></span>Now failed that
light which despised even the sun; he could tell no more, he fainted,
groaning bitterly. The knight (Avt’handil) and Asmat’h wept; the
vicinage reechoed their voices. They said gloomily: "The arms that
brought to nought heroes are become useless, alas!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="334">334</span></span>Asmat’h sprinkled
water (upon him), Taria came back to consciousness; for a long time he
could not speak, melancholy bound and overcame his heart; he sat down
and moaned bitterly, his tears were mingled with the earth; he said:
"Woe is me! what a great agitation is her memory to me!

<span class="margnote"><span id="335">335</span></span>"Trusters in
Fortune have their pick of her gifts, they are lucky, but at last are
not spared her treachery; I praise the prudence of those sages who
oppose her. Hearken to my tidings if life remain in me!

<span class="margnote"><span id="336">336</span></span>"They took in the
partridges; I could make no way

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

for myself. I fell, I fainted, force was fled from mine arms and
shoulder. When I came back to life I heard the voice of weeping and woe;
the household surrounded me like one who is embarking on a ship.

<span class="margnote"><span id="337">337</span></span>"I lay in a fair
bed in a great chamber; the king and queen wept over me with undrying
tears, they scratched their faces with their hands, tearing their
cheeks; mullahs sat round, they called my sickness bewitchment of
Beelzebub.

<span class="margnote"><span id="338">338</span></span>"When the king
saw mine eyes open he embraced my neck; he said to me with tears: 'My
son, my son, dost thou indeed live? Speak one word!' I could give no
answer; like a madman I was greatly affrighted. Again I fell into a
faint; blood rushed into my heart.

<span class="margnote"><span id="339">339</span></span>"All the muqris
and mullahs watched round me, in their hands they held the Koran, all of
them read; they thought I was struck by the Adversary of mankind, I know
not of what they raved. For three days I was lifeless; inextinguishable
fires burned me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="340">340</span></span>"The doctors also
marvelled, saying: 'What manner of sickness is this? Nothing medicable
afflicts him; some melancholy has laid hold of him.' Sometimes I leaped
up like a madman, I uttered idle words. The queen poured forth tears
enough to make a sea.

<span class="margnote"><span id="341">341</span></span>"For three days
was I in the palace neither alive nor dead; then understanding came back
to me, I remembered what had befallen me; I said: 'Alas! in what a
plight am I, despairing of life!' I prayed the Creator for patience; I
ventured to make a discourse of entreaty.

<span class="margnote"><span id="342">342</span></span>"I said: 'O God!
abandon me not, hearken to my supplication, give me strength to endure
that I may rise a little; to stay here will reveal my secret; let me
reach home!' He did so and I mended; I steeled my wounded heart.

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="343">343</span></span>"I sat up. . . .
Many men were come from the king, they carried back the good news: 'He
sits up!' The queen ran in, the king came running bareheaded, he knew
not what he did, he glorified God (while) all others were silent.

<span class="margnote"><span id="344">344</span></span>"They sat down on
either side of me; I sipped some soup. I said: 'My lord, now my heart is
stronger. I long to mount a horse, to see river and field.' They brought
me a horse, I mounted, the king went with me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="345">345</span></span>"We went forth;
we passed by the *moedan* (public square) and the river-bank. I went
home, I sent back the king, who accompanied me to the threshold of the
house. I went in; I felt worse, woe was added to woe; I said to myself:
'I would die! what more can Fate do to me!' (or, what more than this can
my ill luck merit!)

<span class="margnote"><span id="346">346</span></span>"The bath of
tears changed the crystal (of my face) to saffron colour; ten thousand
knives cut my heart still more. The doorkeeper of the bedchamber
entered, he called out the steward; I said to myself: 'What news does he
know, either this one or that one?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="347">347</span></span>"'It is Asmat’h's
slave.' 'What knows she (? he)?' I called, 'Ask!' (? invite him in). He
came in. He gave me a love-letter. I read it. I was surprised how I had
made another's heart burn with heat; I had no suspicion of her, my heart
burned with melancholy for this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="348">348</span></span>"I was surprised
wherefore I was loved, or how she (Asmat’h) dared to declare it to me.
(But, thought I) disobedience avails not, she will denounce me for
silence, she will lose hope of me, then will she reproach me. I wrote
what answer was fitting to enamourment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="349">349</span></span>"Days passed, and
heart burned me still more with flame. I no longer watched the soldiers
going to the plain to sport. I could not go to court. Many physicians
began to come. Then I began to pay the joys and debts of the world.

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="350">350</span></span>"They (the
physicians) could do nothing for me; the twilight of darkness fell upon
my heart. No one else discovered the burning of the hot fire (of love).
They blamed my blood. The king ordered them to bleed my arm; I let it be
done, so as to hide my sufferings, to let none suspect.

<span class="margnote"><span id="351">351</span></span>"After my arm was
bled I lay melancholy alone in my bed. My slave came in; I glanced at
him to ask what he wanted. 'It is Asmat’h's slave,' said he. I told him
to bring him in. I thought in my heart: 'What has she found in me, or
who is she?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="352">352</span></span>"The slave gave
me a letter; I read it slowly.' I learned from the letter that she
wished to come quickly to me. I wrote in reply: 'It is time. Thou art
right to be surprised. Thou shalt come if thou wantest me; suspect me
not of tardiness in coming.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="353">353</span></span>"I said to my
heart: 'Why do such lances make thee thus melancholy? I am Amirbar,
king; all the Indians are subject to me. If it come to their knowledge
they will make the deed a thousand times more weighty; if they find it
out they will not let me travel in their regions.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="354">354</span></span>"A man came from
the king saying he wished to hear the news. I ordered him in; (the king)
commanded me to be bled. I said: 'My arm has been bled; I have begun to
mend. I come to your presence; it is fitting for me to rejoice the more
for this again.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="355">355</span></span>"I went to court.
The king said: 'Now, do this no more!' He seated me quiverless on a
horse; he girded not my loins (with weapons). He mounted, he let fly the
falcons, the partridges shrank with fear, the archers formed in ranks
said: 'Bravo! Bravo!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="356">356</span></span>"We made a feast
at home that day for those who

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

had been in the plain; the singers and minstrels were not dumb; the king
gave away many precious stones praised as unique; none of those present
were left dissatisfied that day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="357">357</span></span>"I strove, (but)
could not keep myself from melancholy; I thought on her, the fire burned
into a larger flame in my heart. I took my comrades with me, I sat down;
they called me an aloe-tree; I drank and feasted to hide my misery and
grief.

<span class="margnote"><span id="358">358</span></span>"My treasurer of
the household whispered in mine ear: 'A certain woman asks if she can
see the Amirbar; veils cover her face, (which is) worthy of the praise
of the wise.' I replied: 'Take her to my chamber; she is invited by me.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="359">359</span></span>"I rose up; those
sitting at the banquet prepared to depart. 'By your leave!' said I, 'do
not rise; I shall not tarry long.' I went forth and entered the chamber,
a slave stood on guard at the door, I nerved my heart to suffer shame.

<span class="margnote"><span id="360">360</span></span>"I halted at the
door; the woman came forward to meet me and did me homage. She said to
me: 'Blessed is he whoever is worthy to come before thee!' I marvelled;
whoever saluted a lover? I thought: 'She knows not how to make love;
even if she knew she sits quiet.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="361">361</span></span>"She said to me:
'This day makes my heart to burn with a flame of shame. Thou thinkest I
came hither to thee for that (purpose), but I find cause for hope in the
fact that I have not waited long for thee; since I am worthy of this
(attention) I cannot say that God's mercy has failed me.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="362">362</span></span>"She rose; she
said to me: 'I am commanded to inquire after thee by one who is bashful
of thee. Suspect me not of what has been said by command of my mistress;
such great boldness is in order to please her heart. This letter will
tell thee for whom I speak.'
