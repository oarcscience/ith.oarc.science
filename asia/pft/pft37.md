### HOW CHILDREN BECAME MONKEYS

*Bukidnon* (*Mindanao*)

One day a mother took her two children with her when she went to color
cloth. Not far from her home was a mud hole  <span
id="fr_118"></span>[119](pft68.htm#fn_118) where the carabao liked to
wallow, and to this hole she carried her cloth, some dye pots, and two
shell spoons.

After she had put the cloth into the mud to let it take up the dark
color, she built a fire and put over it a pot containing water and the
leaves used for dyeing. Then she sat down to wait for the water to boil,
while the children played near by.

By and by when she went to stir the leaves with a shell spoon, some of
the water splashed up and burned her hand, so that she jumped and cried
out. This amused the children and their laughter changed them into
monkeys, and the spoons became their tails.  <span

The nails of the monkeys are still black, because while they were
children they had helped their mother dye the cloth.
