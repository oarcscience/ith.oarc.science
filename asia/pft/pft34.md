### HOW THE MOON AND THE STARS CAME TO BE

*Bukidnon* (*Mindanao*)

One day in the times when the sky was close to the ground a spinster
went out to pound rice.  <span

she took off the beads from around her neck and the comb from her hair,
and hung them on the sky, which at that time looked like coral rock.

Then she began working, and each time that she raised her pestle into
the air it struck the sky. For some time she pounded the rice, and then
she raised the pestle so high that it struck the sky very hard.

Immediately the sky began to rise,  <span

she lost her ornaments. Never did they come down, for the comb became
the moon and the beads are the stars that are scattered about.
