### THE SUN AND THE MOON  <span id="fr_159"></span>[160](pft68.htm#fn_159.md)

*Visayan*

Once upon a time the Sun and the Moon were married, and they had many
children who were the stars. The Sun was very fond of his children, but
whenever he tried to embrace any of them, he was so hot that he burned
them up. This made the Moon so angry that finally she forbade him to
touch them again, and he was greatly grieved.

One day the Moon went down to the spring to do some washing, and when
she left she told the Sun that he must not touch any of their children
in her absence. When she returned, however, she found that he had
disobeyed her, and several of the children had perished.

She was very angry, and picked up a banana tree to strike him, whereupon
he threw sand in her face, and to this day you can see the dark marks on
the face of the Moon.

Then the Sun started to chase her, and they have been going ever since.
Sometimes he gets so near that he almost catches her, but she escapes,
and by and by she is far ahead again.  <span
