<p align="center"><i>Mandaya</i> (<i>Mindanao</i>)</p>  
<p>The Sun and the Moon were married, but the Sun was very ugly and quarrelsome. One day he became angry at the Moon and started to chase her. She ran very fast until she was some distance ahead of him, when she grew tired and he almost caught her. Ever since he has been chasing her, at times almost reaching her, and again falling far behind.</p>  
<p>The first child of the Sun and Moon was a large star, and he was like a man. One time the Sun, becoming angry at the star, cut him up into small pieces and scattered him over the whole sky just as a woman scatters rice, and ever since there have been many stars.</p>  
<p>Another child of the Sun and Moon was a gigantic crab. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_134"></A><A HREF="pft68.htm#fn_134"><FONT SIZE="1">135</FONT></A> He still lives and is so powerful that every time he opens and closes his eyes there is a flash of lightning. Most of the time the crab lives in a large hole in the bottom of the sea, and when he is there we have high tide; but when he leaves the hole, the waters rush in and there is low tide. His moving about also causes great waves on the surface of the sea.</p>  
<p>The crab is quarrelsome like his father; and he sometimes becomes so angry with his mother, the Moon, that he tries to swallow her. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_135"></A><A HREF="pft68.htm#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">136</FONT></A> When the people on earth, who are fond of the Moon, see the crab near her, they run out of doors and shout and beat on gongs until he is frightened away, and thus the Moon is saved.</p>
