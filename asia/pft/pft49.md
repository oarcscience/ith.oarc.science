# CHRISTIANIZED TRIBES

### Introduction

When the Spaniards discovered the Philippines in the sixteenth century,
they found the tribes along the coasts of the different islands already
somewhat influenced by trade with China, Siam, and the islands to the
south.

Under Spanish rule the coast inhabitants, with the exception of the
Moro, soon became converts to Christianity and adopted the dress of
their conquerors, though they retained their several dialects and many
of their former customs. Then, no longer being at war with one another,
they made great advances in civilization, while the hill tribes have
remained isolated, retaining their old customs and beliefs.

The tales of the Christianized tribes include a great mixture of old
ideas and foreign influences obtained through contact with the outside
world.
