### THE STRIPED BLANKET

*Tinguian*

Three Tinguian once went to the mountains to hunt deer. They took their
blankets with them, for they expected to be gone several days, and the
nights in the mountains are cold.

The blankets of two of the men were of the blue-and-white designs such
as are commonly worn by the Tinguian, but that of the third was covered
with red and yellow stripes like the back of a little wild pig.

At night the men rolled up in their blankets and lay down under a tree
to sleep; but while the one in the striped blanket was still awake two
spirits came near and saw him.

"Oh," he heard one spirit say to the other, "here we have something to
eat, for here is a little wild pig."

Then the man quickly took the blanket off one of his sleeping companions
and put his own in its place. Very soon the spirits came and ate the man
under the striped blanket.

Since that time the Tinguian never sleep under that kind of a blanket if
they are where the spirits can get them.
