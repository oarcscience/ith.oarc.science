### IN THE BEGINNING

*Bilaan* (*Mindanao*)

In the beginning there were four beings,  <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](pft68.htm#fn_130) and they lived on an island
no larger than a hat. On this island there were no trees or grass or any
other living thing besides these four people and one bird.  <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](pft68.htm#fn_131) One day they sent this bird
out across the waters to see what he could find, and when he returned he
brought some earth, a piece of rattan, and some fruit.

Melu, the greatest of the four, took the soil and shaped it and beat it
with a paddle in the same manner in which a woman shapes pots of clay,
and when he finished he had made the earth. Then he planted the seeds
from the fruit, and they grew until there was much rattan and many trees
bearing fruit.

The four beings watched the growth for a long time and were well pleased
with the work, but finally Melu said:

"Of what use is this earth and all the rattan and fruit if there are no
people?"

And the others replied, "Let us make some people out of wax."

So they took some wax and worked long, fashioning it into forms, but
when they brought them to the fire the wax melted, and they saw that men
could not be made in that way.

Next they decided to try to use dirt in making people, and Melu and one
of his companions began working on that. All went well till they were
ready to make the noses. The companion, who was working on that part,
put them on upside down. Melu told him that the people would drown if he
left them that way, but he refused to change them.

When his back was turned, however, Melu seized the noses, one by one,
and turned them as they now are. But he was in such a hurry that he
pressed his finger at the root, and it left a mark in the soft clay
which you can still see on the faces of people.
