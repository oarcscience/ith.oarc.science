### THE CHILDREN OF THE LIMOKON  <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](pft68.htm#fn_132.md)

*Mandaya* (*Mindanao*)

In the very early days before there were any people on the earth, the
limokon (a kind of dove)  <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](pft68.htm#fn_133.md) were very powerful and could
talk like men though they looked like birds. One limokon laid two eggs,
one at the mouth of the Mayo River and one farther up its course. After
some time these eggs hatched, and the one at the mouth of the river
became a man, while the other became a woman.

The man lived alone on the bank of the river for a long time, but he was
very lonely and wished many times for a companion. One day when he was
crossing the river something was swept against his legs with such force
that it nearly caused him to drown. On examining it, he found that it
was a hair, and he determined to go up the river and find whence it
came. He traveled up the stream, looking on both banks, until finally he
found the woman, and he was very happy to think that at last he could
have a companion.

They were married and had many children, who are the Mandaya still
living along the Mayo River.
