### THE MISTAKEN GIFTS

*Tinguian*

When Siagon was about eight years old his parents began looking for a
girl who would make a suitable wife. At last when they had decided on a
beautiful maiden, who lived some distance from them, they sent a man to
her parents to ask if they would like Siagon for a son-in-law.

Now when the man arrived at the girl's house the people were all sitting
on the floor eating periwinkle, and as they sucked the meat out of the
shell, they nodded their heads. The man, looking in at the door, saw
them nod, and he thought they were nodding at him. So he did not tell
them his errand, but returned quickly to the boy's parents and told them
that all the people at the girl's house were favorable to the union.

Siagon's parents were very much pleased that their proposal had been so
kindly received, and immediately prepared to go to the girl's house to
arrange for the wedding.

Finally all was ready and they started for her house, carrying with them
as presents for her parents two carabao, two horses, two cows, four iron
kettles, sixteen jars of basi, two blankets, and two little pigs.

The surprise of the girl's people knew no bounds when they saw all this
coming to their house, for they had not even thought of Siagon marrying
their daughter.  <span id="fr_86"></span>[87](pft68.htm#fn_86)
