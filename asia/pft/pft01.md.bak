### PREFACE

From time to time since the American occupation of the Islands,
Philippine folk-tales have appeared in scientific publications, but
never, so far as the writer is aware, has there been an attempt to offer
to the general public a comprehensive popular collection of this
material. It is my earnest hope that this collection of tales will give
those who are interested opportunity to learn something of the magic,
superstitions, and weird customs of the Filipinos, and to feel the charm
of their wonder-world as it is pictured by these dark-skinned
inhabitants of our Island possessions.

In company with my husband, who was engaged in ethnological work for the
Field Museum of Natural History, it was my good fortune to spend four
years among the wild tribes of the Philippines, During this time we
frequently heard these stories, either related by the people in their
homes and around the camp fires or chanted by the pagan priests in
communion with the spirits. The tales are now published in this little
volume, with the addition of a few folk-legends that have appeared in
the *Journal of American Folk-Lore* and in scientific publications, here
retold with some additions made by native story-tellers.

I have endeavored to select typical tales from tribes widely separated
and varying in culture from savagery to a rather high degree of
development. The stories are therefore divided into five groups, as
follows: Tinguian, Igorot, the Wild Tribes of Mindanao, Moro, and
Christian,

The first two groups, Tinguian and Igorot, are from natives who inhabit
the rugged mountain region of northwestern Luzon. From time immemorial
they have been zealous head-hunters, and the stories teem with
references to customs and superstitions connected with their savage
practices. By far the largest number belong to the Tinguian group. In
order to appreciate these tales to the fullest extent, we must
understand the point of view of the Tinguian. To him they embody all the
known traditions of "the first times"—of the people who inhabited the
earth before the present race appeared, of the ancient heroes and their
powers and achievements. In them he finds an explanation of and reason
for many of his present laws and customs.

A careful study of the whole body of Tinguian mythology points to the
conclusion that the chief characters of these tales are not celestial
beings but typical, generalized heroes of former ages, whose deeds have
been magnified in the telling by many generations of their descendants.
These people of "the first times" practiced magic. They talked with
jars, created human beings out of betel-nuts, raised the dead, and had
the power of changing themselves into other forms. This, however, does
not seem strange or impossible to the Tinguian of today, for even now
they talk with jars, perform certain rites to bring sickness and death
to their foes, and are warned by omens received through the medium of
birds, thunder and lightning, or the condition of the liver of a
slaughtered animal. They still converse freely with certain spirits who
during religious ceremonies are believed to use the bodies of men or
women as mediums for the purpose of advising and instructing the people.

Several of the characters appear in story after story. Sometimes they go
under different names, but in the minds of the story-tellers their
personality and relationships are definitely established. Thus Ini-init
of the first tale becomes Kadayadawan in the second, Aponitolau in the
third, fourth, fifth, and sixth, and Ligi in the seventh. Kanag, the son
of Aponitolau and Aponibolinayen, in the fifth tale is called Dumalawi.

These heroes had most unusual relations with the heavenly bodies, all of
which seem to have been regarded as animate beings. In the fourth tale
Aponitolau marries Gaygayoma, the star maiden who is the daughter of the
big star and the moon. In the first story the same character under the
name of Ini-init seems to be a sun-god: we are told that he is "the
sun," and again "a round stone which rolls." Thereupon we might conclude
that he is a true solar being; yet in the other tales of this collection
and in many more known to the Tinguian he reveals no celestial
qualities. Even in the first story he abandons his place in the sky and
goes to live on earth.

In the first eight stories we read of many customs of "the first times"
which differ radically from those of the present. But a careful analysis
of all the known lore of this people points to the belief that many of
these accounts depict a period when similar customs did exist among the
people, or else were practiced by emigrants who generations ago became
amalgamated with the Tinguian and whose strange customs finally became
attributed to the people of the tales. The stories numbered nine to
sixteen are of a somewhat different type, and in them the Tinguian finds
an explanation of many things, such as, how the people learned to plant,
and to cure diseases, where they secured the valuable jars and beads,
and why the moon has spots on its face. All these stories are fully
believed, the beads and jars are considered precious, and the places
mentioned are definitely known. While the accounts seem to be of fairly
recent origin they conflict neither with the fundamental ideas and
traditions of "the first times" nor with the beliefs of today.

Stories seventeen to twenty-three are regarded as fables and are told to
amuse the children or to while away the midday hours when the people
seek shaded spots to lounge or stop on the trail to rest. Most of them
are known to the Christianized tribes throughout the Islands and show
great similarity to the tales found in the islands to the south and, in
some cases, in Europe. In many of them the chief incidents are identical
with those found elsewhere, but the story-tellers, by introducing old
customs and beliefs, have moulded and colored them until they reflect
the common ideas of the Tinguian.

The third group includes stories from several wild tribes who dwell in
the large island of Mindanao. Here are people who work in brass and
steel, build good dwellings, and wear hemp clothing elaborately
decorated with beads, shell disks, and embroidery, but who still
practice many savage customs, including slavery and human sacrifice.

The fourth division gives two tales from the Moro (hardy Malayan
warriors whose ancestors early became converts to the faith of
Mohammed). Their teachers were the Arabian traders who, about 1400,
succeeded in converting many of the Malay Islanders to the faith of the
prophet.

The last group contains the stories of the Christianized natives—those
who accepted the rule of Spain and with it the Catholic religion. Their
tales, while full of local color, nevertheless show the influence of the
European tutors. They furnish an excellent opportunity to contrast the
literature of the savage head-hunters with that of the Moro and
Christian tribes and to observe how various recent influences have
modified the beliefs of people who not many centuries ago were doubtless
of a uniform grade of culture. It is interesting, too, to note that
European tales brought into the Islands by Mohammedan and Christian
rulers and traders have been worked over until, at first glance, they
now appear indigenous.

Owing to local coloring, these tales have various forms. Still we find
many incidents which are held in common by all the tribes of the
Archipelago and even by the people of Borneo, Java, Sumatra, and India.
Some of these similarities and parallelisms are indicated in the
foot-notes throughout the book.
