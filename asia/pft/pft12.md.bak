### THE SUN AND THE MOON

*Tinguian*

Once the Sun and the Moon quarreled with each other, and the Sun said:

"You are only the Moon and are not much good. If I did not give you
light, you would be no good at all."

But the Moon answered:

"You are only the Sun, and you are very hot The women like me better,
for when I shine at night, they go out doors and spin."

These words of the Moon made the Sun so angry that he threw sand in her
face, and you can still see the dark spots on the face of the Moon.
