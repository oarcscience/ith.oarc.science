# An Inquiry into the Religious Tenets of the Yezeedees

## by George Percy Badger

#### \[1852\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a short extract from a book by a Christian missionary which
gives some historical observations on the Yezidi people of northern
Iraq. For more information on the Yezidi, refer to [Devil Worship: The
Sacred Books and Traditions of the Yezidiz](../sby/index.md), which
references this article heavily.

The Rev. Badger didn't get as close to the Yezidi as Isya Joseph did.
His access was limited because he was a missionary, rather than an
anthropologist. However, there aren't too many first-hand accounts of
the Yezidi during the mid-nineteenth century, (actually this is the only
one I've discovered so far). This document gives another perspective on
this fascinating culture and their unique religious beliefs.
