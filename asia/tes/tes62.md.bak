### 8. STORY OF THE TOM-CAT AND THE COCK <span id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_92.md)

There lived a Tom-Cat and a Cock. The Tom-Cat went to fetch fuel, and
ordered the Cock to bake pancakes. Meanwhile there came a She-Fox and
sang:--

"O Cock, my Cock! let me in!  
We two shall play with little gold rings."

But the Cock refused to let her in. Then she sang again:--

"O Cock, my Cock! the golden crest,  
The battered head, the silken beard,  
Permit me at least to warm one single nail."

The Cock felt compassion, and pierced with a needle a little hole in the
window-skin. The She-Fox thrust her nail in through the hole, and tore
off the window-skin. Then she caught the Cock and carried him off
through the window. The Cock sang aloud:--

"O Cat, my Cat!  
The Fox is carrying me off  
Beyond the dark forest,  
Beyond the high mountains,  
Beyond the white rocks,  
Beyond the round lakes."

"Котъ, мой коть,  
Несетъ меня лиса  
За темные лѣца,  
За высокіа горы,  
За бѣлыя каменья,  
За круглыя озерья."

But the cat heard nothing and the Cock cried again:--

"O Cat, my Cat!  
The Fox is carrying me off  
Beyond the dark forest,  
Beyond the high mountains,  
Beyond the white rocks,  
Beyond the round lakes."

\[paragraph continues\] The Cat heard this time, and chased the Fox. He
swung over her head his mighty sword, but she slipped into her furrow
and was gone. So the Cock went to market and bought for himself a fine
dulcimer. Then he came to the Fox's house, and sang thus:--

"Jingle, jingle, my fine dulcimer,  
My golden one, my sonorous one!  
Are you at home, O my red fox!  
In your warm nest?  
The first daughter of yours is the Small-Stuffed-One,  
The second daughter is Palachelka. <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93.md)  
The son is Valorous. <span id="fr_94"></span>[2](#fn_94.md)  
He went up the sky  
Clap my little staff  
At the oaken door-sill.  
Bring me, O fox!  
An oven-baked cake."

"Брянь, брянь, гусельтсы,  
Золотыя, звончатыя,  
Дома ли лиса красна  
Во тепломъ гиѣздѣ?  
Перва дочь Чучелка,  
Другая Палачелка,  
Сынъ хороыеръ  
Подъ неЕеса ушелъ.  
Цтукъ черешекъ  
О дуЕовый порожокъ.  
Подай, лиса,  
Подовый пирожокъ."

So the Fox said to the Small-Stuffed-One, "Go and give him this
oven-baked-cake." She went with the cake, but he struck her on the head
and killed her.

"He hid the carcass under the sand,  
And the little skin under a heavy stone,  
Lest the people see anything."

А Куреньгу подъ песокъ,  
А кожишку подъ тяжелый камешокъ,  
Чтобъ люди не вигали.

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

Then he sang again:--

"Jingle, jingle, my fine dulcimer,  
My golden one, my sonorous one!  
Are you at home, O fox!  
In your warm nest?  
You are  
Quite fair of face,  
But your husband is unfair.  
Clap my little staff  
Upon the oaken door-sill,  
Bring me, O Fox!  
An oven-baked-cake."  
An oven-baked-cake."

"Брянь, брянь, гусельтсы  
Золотыя, звончатыя,  
Дома ли лиса  
Во тепломъ гиѣздѣ?  
Она сама  
Литсомъ красна,  
У ней мужъ не хорошъ.  
Стукъ черешокъ  
О дубовый порожокъ.  
Подай, лиса,  
Подовый пирожокъ."

"Ah," said the Fox, "go, Palachelka, and give him this oven-baked cake."
She went with the cake but he killed her likewise. Then he sang again:--

"Jingle, jingle, my fine dulcimer,  
My golden one, my sonorous one!  
Are you at home, O fox!  
In your warm nest?  
You are  
Quite fair of face,  
But your husband is unfair.  
Clap my little staff  
Upon the oaken door-sill,  
Bring me, O Fox!  
An oven-baked-cake."

"Ah!" said the Fox, "Go, little Cock, and give him this oven-baked
cake!"

The Cock went with the cake, but the Tom-Cat caught the Cock and hurried
back to his home. <span id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95.md) He gave the cock a
sound thrashing. "Another

time, whoever comes, you must not forget to keep the door tightly
closed." After that they lived happily.

Told by Mary Shkuleff, a Russian creole girl, aged fourteen, in the
village of Pokhotsk, the Kolyma country, summer of 1895.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_92"></span>[118:1](tes62.htm#fr_92.md) This is the Kolyma
version of the well-known Old World story. Among the Russians of Europe
several versions of it are known, mostly in rhymed prose. The Kolyma
version is also in rhymed prose; but its form seems to be more ancient,
and some of its details are not without interest--W. B.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[119:1](tes62.htm#fr_93.md) The meaning of this
name is unknown. Both names are of local, probably Yukaghir,
provenience--W. B.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[119:2](tes62.htm#fr_94.md) This and the following
line are probably inserted from an ancient conundrum. "The mother is
thick, the daughter is red, the son is valorous, went up the sky.--Oven,
fire, smoke." (Мать толста, дочь красна, сынъ хороберъ, подъ небеса
ушелъ).--W.B.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[120:1](tes62.htm#fr_95.md) According to another
version, likewise from the Kolyma, the Tom-Cat killed also the mother
Fox. He found the Cock firmly frozen in a block of ice, lying in the
corner. He broke the ice, and thawed the Cock's body before the fire.
The Cock came to life, and crowed lustily--W. B.
