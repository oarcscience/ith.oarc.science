### 18. STORY OF THE FOX AND THE WOLF. <span id="fr_124"></span>[1](#fn_124.md)

The man pursued Fox with dogs, but Fox succeeded in plunging into the
nest of a polar Owl. <span id="fr_125"></span>[2](#fn_125.md) The man
chopped at the trunk with his heavy ax. "O gossip! I want to fly
out."--"Ah, gossip! do as if you have too; but before doing so please
pass water upon my neck," said the Fox. Owl passed water upon Fox's
neck. When the man caught Fox by the neck, she slipped out of his
fingers and ran off. The dogs followed her. She ran to and fro, until
she was tired. Then she called to Owl, "O gossip! teach me how to
fly."--"All right! Sit down on my back!" The owl alighted and carried
off Fox. They flew up high into the air. "Oh dear!" said Fox. "I know
how to fly, but I do not know how to alight." Owl pretended to throw her
down. "O Lord! let it be upon the moss! O God! let it be upon a soft
place!" Owl threw her down and Fox was killed.

Told by Mary Alin, a Russianized Chuvantzi woman. Recorded by Mrs.
Sophie Bogoras in the village of Markova, the Anadyr country, winter of
1900.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_124"></span>[148:1](tes83.htm#fr_124.md) This is the usual Old
World story telling how Fox pretended to fish through a hole in the ice,
and then tempted Wolf to do the same: wolf lost his tail in the Ice.

Fox feigned death, and was picked up by a passing farmer, etc. I give
here only an episode which seems of local character--W. B.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[148:2](tes83.htm#fr_125.md) Some of the nests of
these large owls are said to be placed within hollow trunks of trees, or
among piles of driftwood which are found at certain places all along the
arctic coast. (Cf. Bogoras,-- The Chukchee," 97.)--W. B.
