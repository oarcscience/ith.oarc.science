# V. MARKOVA TALES.

### 1. LAMUT TALE. <span id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_96.md)

There was a Lamut man, who traveled about looking for a wife. One time
he found a stone in the likeness of a person. He took it home and put it
near the fireplace. He awoke in the morning, and said to the stone,
"There, wife, cook some food!" Since the stone never stirred, he got up
and cooked the food himself. Then he went off to look for game. He came
back in the evening, and said again to the stone, "Wife, cook some
food!" But since the stone never stirred, he cooked the food himself. He
awoke next morning, and, lo! the stone wife was cooking food. They lived
together as husband and wife.

After a while he went to a river and walked along the bank. He felt
thirsty; he found a water-hole and stooped down. When about to drink, he
saw a girl down below, who was combing her long glossy hair. "Ah, come
here! let us play!" She came out, and they played shooting at each other
with bow and arrows. At last he looked up. The sun was already setting.
"Ah! it is late. I must go home. He went home, but his wife pouted at
him. "Why are you so late? Before this you used to come in time."--"I
have been tracking a fox." The following morning he arose early and went
to the river. The water girl was already down there in the water,
combing her hair. "Come along, let us play!" They played again till
sunset. When he came home, his wife was very angry. "Why are you so
late?" He gave no answer, thinking of the girl, and promising himself,
"Tomorrow morning I shall getup still earlier." The wife, however,
caused a heavy sleep to fall upon him. Early in the morning the stone
woman arose. She put on her husband's clothes, took his bow and arrows,
and on snowshoes went to the river following her husband's tracks. She
came to the water-hole and looked down. The girl was there, combing her
hair. "Come along, let us play."--"Ah! my heart is in a flurry. I feel
as if we had never played before."--"Oh, nonsense! Well, at least come
up a little! Let me have a look at you." The other one appeared out of
the water up to her armpits. Then the stone wife shot at her and pierced
her breast with an arrow. Blood spurted from her breast and from her
back. The girl dropped back, and the stone woman returned to her home.
She

put her husband's clothes in their former place, also his bow and
snowshoes. Then she removed the sleeping-spell from him. He jumped up,
and saw that the sun was already high up in the sky. He took his bow,
put on his snowshoes, and hurried to the river. The girl, however, was
not to be seen. "Ah!" said he with many lamentations, "she is no more! I
do not want to stay here either." He jumped into the water and sank
down. His ears rustled, his body tingled all over. Then he found himself
in a new world. He found a beaten track, and walked on. After a while he
came to a city. All the houses of the city were covered with black
calico. Apart from the others stood a little house in which lived a
little old woman. He entered. The old woman asked, "Where do you come
from?"--"I am from the other world. What has happened here! Is anybody
sick? Why all this black calico?"--"Our chief's daughter is sick.
Somebody hit her with an arrow."--"I want to heal her." The old woman
hurried to the chief: "A man has come to our city who offers to heal
your daughter." The chief ordered that the visitor be brought in. As
soon as he entered the house, the girl moaned aloud, "Aah!" He touched
the arrow, and in a moment she was dead. Then he asked for some men's
clothes. These he put on her body, and on himself he put her clothes.
"Well, father and mother, take your last farewell. I will watch the body
all by myself." After sunset there came two young birds, two spoonbills.
Two high larch trees stood there. The spoonbills alighted on the trees.

"O sister! get up!  
Let us play, and let us flutter about!" <span

"O sisters! I cannot play,  
I cannot flutter.  
O sisters! my wings are broken,  
My feathers fell down."

"O sister! who broke your wings?  
Who plumed your feathers?"

"O sisters! he who broke them.  
He lies down like one dead."

The spoonbills alighted on the ground, and turned into young girls. They
came to the one who was dead. The first girl blew upon her, the second
girl spat upon her. Then she jumped up, and exclaimed, "Ah, ah, ah! I
slept very long! Now I am up again." "Ah! without our aid, you would
have slept forever." They stayed there till the following morning. When

the other people awoke, they carried her to her parents. The mother
immediately fell in a swoon. She came to herself only in the evening,
and they married the girl to the visitor. They lived together. One time
he said, "I want to visit my former wife." As soon as the stone wife saw
him, she jumped up. "Ah! my husband is coming, my husband is coming!"
She whetted her teeth, ready to bite; but the man strung his how and
shot her. She fell back. "Ah! so it is. I wanted to devour you, but you
got ahead of me." He built a great fire and burned the woman. Then he
went back to the water girl and lived with her.

Told by Anne Sosykin, a Russianized Chuvantzi woman, in the village of
Markova. Recorded by Mrs. Sophie Bogoras, winter of 1900.
