### 30. A CHRISTMAS STORY.

It was in olden times that some girls went to wed the snow. <span
id="fr_82"></span>[2](#fn_82.md) They came to a water-hole, sat down, and
traced a magic circle all around themselves upon the snow. They were
seated on a bearskin. One of the paws of the skin projected accidentally
beyond the circle, but not one of the girls noticed it. All at once the
skin under them began to move. The water in the water-hole bubbled as in
a kettle, and something made its appearance out of the water. They were
horribly frightened and rushed away. Nearest to the river stood the
small house of an old woman. She was pious and wealthy. She had among
other things a great number of saucepans, large and bright, made of
solid copper. She met them in the entrance, and

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

ordered them immediately to put the saucepans on their heads as caps.
Then they sat down and waited. After a few moments the door was torn
open, and in rushed a large stove, all of black iron, breathing fire
from all its openings. All at once all the saucepans were pulled down
with great violence. That done, the phantom departed. Most certainly the
saucepans had been mistaken by it for the heads of girls, so the girls
were saved. That is all.

Told by Mary Dauroff, a Russian creole woman, in the village of
Pokhotsk, summer of 1896.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_82"></span>[105:2](tes51.htm#fr_82.md) It is a kind of old
Russian divination, practised on Christmas Eve or Twelfth Night. Young
girls "wed the snow," and, according to the marks left on the snow by
their fingers, foretell the future chiefly in reference to their
possible marriage during the coming year.--W. B.
