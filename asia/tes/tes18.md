### 7. BEAR, WOLVERENE, AND WOLF STORY.

Bear, Wolverene, and Wolf, being brothers, lived side by side. The
youngest brother paid suit to the daughter of the middle one. "No," said
the middle one, "How is it that you ask me for my daughter? We cannot
join. You are born from the snow, and I am born from the earth." <span
id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18) Wolf grew angry and made complaint to
Bear. Bear bore judgment and ordered, "If that is so, you must part." He
said to Wolf, "Your temper is worst of all, you shall bring forth not
more than two or three children." Wolf departed sorrowfully. Bear said
to Wolverene, "You have a daughter, and refuse her to suitors, so you
must not bring forth more than one, child." He blamed Wolverene, and
said, "If you had given your daughter in marriage, our people would be
more numerous, so you must meet your fate in the wooden thing." <span

Wolverene also grew angry, and retorted, "And you must meet your fate
underground." <span id="fr_20"></span>[3](#fn_20) Wolverene laid a curse
upon Bear: "You must sleep throughout the winter, and your fate will
come to you while you are insensible to it."

So the Bear's word caused young wolves to be born by two's and three's,
and wolverenes singly. The Wolverene's word caused the Bear to sleep
throughout the winter, so that hunters kill him in his sleep.

Told by Ulashkan, a Lamut man, on the Molonda River, in the Kolyma
country, summer of 1895.
