### 3. STORY ABOUT YAGHISHNA.

There lived an old man and an old woman. They had a small girl still in
her swaddling clothes. They swathed her tightly and put her upon the
bed. Then they heard Yaghishna coming. They were frightened, and ran

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

off, leaving the girl behind. Yaghishna came in shuffling over the floor
with her bristle-soled frozen boots. <span id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_88.md)
She seized the old man and the old woman, but forgot to take the girl.
Then she came back and felt with her bands on the bed. She found the
girl, put her into the corner behind the chimney, and covered her with a
large dish. Yaghishna kindled a large fire, then she put a cast-iron
frying-pan upon the fire and said aloud, "O girl! get up!" And the girl
got up. Then she said again, "Take off your swaddling clothes." And the
girl did so. "Now, come here!" And the girl went to her. She slapped her
upon the face, and asked her, "For what did your mother bring you
forth?"--"She brought me forth to carry water for you."--"I am strong
enough. I shall carry it myself." She gave her another box on the ear,
and asked again, "For what did your mother bring you forth?"--"She
brought me forth to chop wood for you."--"I am strong enough. I shall
chop it myself." She gave her another box on the ear, and asked the same
question, "For what did your mother bring you forth?"--"She brought me
forth to make fire for you."--"I am strong enough. I shall make it
myself."

She put out the fire in the chimney, leaving only one small spark. Then
she said, "Stay here and watch this spark. If it should go out, I shall
tear you in two when I get back home." She prepared to go away, and
warned the girl. "Keep house and take good care of everything. You may
open and visit all the storehouses. There is only one which you must not
open. It is the one tied with a bark thread and sealed with excrement.
This storehouse is forbidden to you." Yaghishna flew away. The girl
thought, "Why should I not examine this storehouse?" She went straight
to it, tore off the bark thread, and broke the excrement seal. The
storehouse was filled with charmed reindeer, neither living nor dead.
She led all these reindeer out of the storehouse, and tied them one
after another to a long heavy line. Then she pulled in one end of the
line and threw it across the river. It flew off and carried her along
with it. She dragged the reindeer across, and waited for Yaghishna. In
the evening Yaghishna came home, and saw the storehouse open and empty.
She went to the river, but the girl was on the other side. Yaghishna
asked, "You opened my storehouse?"--"I did," said the girl. "You took my
reindeer?"--"I did," answered the girl. "You fled across the river?"--"I
did," still answered the girl. "And how did you do it?" asked Yaghishna
eagerly. "I drank up all the water and dried up the river," said the
girl. Yaghishna stooped down and drank of the river. She drank and
drank, and became full like a water-bag; but the river still flowed on,
as before. "I shall cross," said Yaghishna angrily. "Ah! it is too
sticky here." Indeed, the river bank was

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

covered with slime. "Say! what did you take hold of when you left, this
bank?"--"I took hold of a tree and then of a bush, and last of all of a
small weed," said the girl. Yaghishna caught hold of a weed, and it
broke off. She fell into the water, and her belly burst. A stream of
water came out of it and carried her off to the middle of the river, and
downstream. "Ah, ah!, help me out!" cried Yaghishna. "No, I will not,"
answered the girl. Then Yaghishna shouted to the girl when passing by:--
