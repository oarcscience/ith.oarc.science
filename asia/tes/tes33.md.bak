### 12. THE MONSTER WITH IRON TEETH.

There were three brothers. One time they traveled together in lonely
places. The first night they stopped at a way house. <span
id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md) They made a fire,

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

cooked some bread-soup, <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md) and had
supper. While they were eating, a board of the floor was lifted up.
There appeared a monster <span id="fr_52"></span>[2](#fn_52.md) with iron
teeth, two feet long. The eldest brother said to the other two, "Go out
and get the dogs and sledges ready. I will stay here. And you must wait
outside for me." They took their bread-soup and went out of the house.
They could hear the eldest brother within fighting with the monster.
They did not know in what way, but could only hear great noise and
gnashing of teeth. Before sunrise their brother came out of the house.
They started off on their sledges. They drove till dark. Then they saw
another log cabin. They entered, made a fire, and prepared some soup. As
soon as they had swallowed a spoonful or two, a board was lifted in one
of the front corners of the house and up came the Monster with Iron
Teeth. The oldest brother made the other two go out and he fought the
monster alone. The next morning, when he came out, they saw that he had
turned into a quite different being. All his blood, and his face, were
no longer human. He was more like a devil. The second brother said to
the youngest one, "Look at him! He has iron teeth at least half a foot
long."

They drove onward again until evening. It had grown quite dark when they
came to another log cabin. They made a fire and prepared soup. When they
were half through with their meal, there appeared a woman with iron
teeth, covered with blood, who rushed at them. The eldest brother: also
fought the woman. The other two exchanged looks, and slipped out of
doors. Then they turned their sledges back and drove homeward. They
traveled the whole night and the next day. Then they came to the log
cabin in which the second fight with the Monster of Iron Teeth had taken
place. They made a fire and prepared their soup. Then they heard outside
the shuffling of snowshoes. They were so much frightened, that neither
dared to go out. Then the door opened of itself, and the oldest brother
entered. He was very angry. "Why are you making so much trouble for me?
If you want to leave me behind, why do you stop in this very place?" He
had hardly finished these words, when the Monster with Iron Teeth
appeared. They fought again; and the eldest brother said, "Go away! Do
not wait for me any longer! But mind you do not stop at the first log
cabin. When I am through with this fight, I shall give chase; and if I
catch you in the first log cabin, I shall fight the first monster, but I
shall also punish you."

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

They drove away from there, crying for fear. They traveled throughout
the night and the next day. After sunset they came to the log cabin, and
of course wanted to pass it, but they could not induce their dogs to
pass by. All the dogs rushed in and fought as if they were worrying
somebody to death. No one was to be seen, however. They wrangled with
the dogs far into the evening, and at last dragged them out of the
house. They were quite tired and hungry; and the second brother at last
proposed, "Let us stay here over night!" The youngest answered, "How
could we do that? The monster will appear, and then our brother; and he
warned us beforehand that he will punish us." The second brother
answered, "Curse him for a fool! I do not fear him at all. I myself have
become as bad as he." The youngest brother looked up, and saw that the
second brother also had iron teeth half a foot long. He was so badly
frightened that he could not speak. Meanwhile the shuffling of snowshoes
was heard outside, and there entered a being similar to their brother in
face and body; but they did not recognize him. He said not a single
word, but rushed at the second brother. They fought like wolves. The
youngest brother slipped outside, took his dogs, and fled. He drove on
until midnight, and heard nothing. After midnight, however, he heard a
voice like a distant shaman's call. The voice said, "A man is pursuing
his own brother. He wants to gnaw at his bones, to eat of his meat, to
drink of his blood!" The youngest brother out of fright, urged his dogs
on with all his might. In the meantime he said to himself, "When he
overtakes me, how shall I defend myself?" He remembered having heard
from older people, that, when pursued by a monster, one may defend
oneself by striking the monster with an old kettle. Then the monster
will fall down and will be unable to follow for a couple of hours, which
at least will give respite at the most critical moment. So he loosened
the kettle, and made ready for the blow. Kettle in hand, he watched when
the monster should reach the sledge. When it was at hand, he uttered an
incantation and struck its face with the blackened kettle. The monster
fell face down, and cried aloud, "Oh, you are too clever for me! I shall
catch you, nevertheless. The village is yet far off. I shall rest for a
couple of hours; then I shall catch you, drink of your blood, eat of
your meat and gnaw your bones." The other one urged his dogs to the
limit of their strength. He knew, that the village was not very far
away. They moved on. The monster gave pursuit again. Then they heard the
bell in the church belfry ringing. He crossed himself, and said, "Thank
God, I am safe now!" And the monster shouted from behind, "You are safe;
but I shall catch you somewhere in time to come." The young man reached
the village, and straightway went to the priest. He said that in such
and such places in the woods there were monsters; that

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

these monsters were probably unburied corpses, which walk abroad and
attack human beings. The priest listened to him, and then laid a curse
of the Church upon the monsters; that they should cease to appear and
make trouble. After that all the people traveled about without fear or
danger, and they met with nothing extraordinary. The end.

Told by Nicholas Kusakoff, a Russian creole (cossack), at the village of
Pokhotsk in the Kolyma country, summer of 1896.
