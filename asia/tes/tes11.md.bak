### 8. (REINDEER-BORN.) <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md)

There was a Tungus man who had a large reindeer herd, and no son at all.
One time he came to his herd, and saw that a doe had brought forth a
fawn which looked quite human. "What is this?" asked the man. "This is a
small boy," said the doe. "I brought forth for you. Take him and have
him for a son." The Tungus took the boy, who grew up quickly. Every day
he would swallow live reindeer,--one in the morning, another at noon,
and still another in the evening,--three meals a day, three living
reindeer. So this man, who was rich in reindeer, soon had almost none at
all, and was poor. Then he felt afraid, and said to himself, "He will
finish the reindeer-herd, and next it will be my turn." He left his
house and goods,

and fled away, not knowing where he was going. He walked on for a long
time. Then he saw an iron house.

In the house was a very pretty girl, so pretty that all the food she
swallowed was visible though her transparent body. <span
id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md) He thought in his mind, "Oh, I wish I had
a wife like that girl!" And she answered immediately, "Really, you wish
it?" She knew his thoughts, though he had not uttered. a single word.
She called him in and gave him food and drink. Then they lay down to
sleep together. He stayed in that iron house three days and three
nights. On the fourth morning his wife said, "It seems that you area
runaway." He said, "Maybe I am."--"From whom were you running? I wish
you would tell me the truth." Then he said, "I took a foster child from
the herd, Reindeer-Born; and I was afraid he would eat me up, together
with my last reindeer."--"All right," said the woman, "have no more
fear! Go back to your home. Here, take this neckerchief, and if the
Reindeer-born should see you and should pursue you, run to some tree and
hide behind it. Reindeer-born will not be able to catch you. And it
Reindeer-born should not desist, touch the tree with this neckerchief."

The man went back and came to his house. All at once he saw
Reindeer-born, who rushed straight for him. The man turned about and ran
for his life. He came to a tree, and hid behind it. Reindeer-born gave
chase, and ran straight into the tree, striking his forehead against it
with all his might. "Ah!" said Reindeer-born, "Your strength is greater
than mine. I cannot make you fall." In the meantime the man took the
neckerchief and touched the tree with it; and instantly the kerchief
turned into iron, and its outward shape was similar to that of a saw.
This saw sawed at the tree and cut it down. The tree fell and struck
Reindeer-born directly upon the head. It broke his head as if it had
been an egg-shell, and killed him outright. The man returned to the iron
house and lived there, having the young woman as a wife.

Told by Innocent Karyakin, a Tundra Yukaghir man, on the western tundra
of the Kolyma country, winter of 1895.
