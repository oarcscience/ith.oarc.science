### 6. A MARKOVA TALE <span id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_105.md)

There were three brothers. One was Grass-Leg, another was Bladder, the
third was Little-Finger. One time they ate blood-soup. Little-Finger saw
some marrow, and wanted to take it; but he fell into the soup and was
drowned. Grass-Leg wanted to help him, but in his hurry broke his leg,
seeing which, Bladder laughed till he burst of laughter. Their father
went and asked his wife, "Where are our children?" She told him. He was
so angry that he killed her. The end. <span

Told by Katherine Alin, a Russianized Chuvantzi girl, twelve years of
age, in the village of Markova. Recorded by Mrs. Sophie Bogoras, winter
of 1900.
