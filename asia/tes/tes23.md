### 2. A YUKAGHIR TALE.

Once upon a time there were some Yukaghir people. They had an only
daughter, who was very active and clever. One time when she was walking
about a whirlwind carried her off. It took her to the mountains. A big
rock, which extended from the ground up to heaven was standing there.
The whirlwind carried her there and left her close to the. rock. She sat
there, and after awhile she saw a bluejay flying by. "O Jay, go to my
father and mother and say to them, "Your daughter asks you for some glue
and a glue pot, for a line, and for climbing hooks." <span
id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md) "I will not go. When you were still living
with your father and mother, you were nasty; whenever I wanted to pick
up some meat, you drove me away. I will not help you." A snow-bunting
passed by. She said to it, "Go and tell my father and mother, 'Your
daughter would dearly love to have some glue and a glue-pot, a line, and
some climbing hooks'."--"I will go. When you were still living with your
father and mother, you were very nice. I used to come and peck at the
drying meat, and you would even leave for me some spare bit or a piece
of dried roe; so I will help you. My wings are young. I will bring each
and everyone one of the things you asked for." And really it brought
everything. The girl felt glad, and sang aloud.

After some time the whirlwind brought another girl there, and then a
third one. The first one said to her fellow-prisoners, "Why, sisters!
there is no use to sit here and wait. Let us try to climb the rock! She
prepared three lines and three sets of climbing-hooks. Then she threw
her line upward. It caught around the stone, and she climbed up. The
other two followed.

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

\[paragraph continues\] When half way up, she asked of one, "Well, now,
sisters, perhaps we shall find only one man there, and all three of us
are going to marry him. Shall we then have quarrels and fights, as
usual?"--"Of course we shall," said the other. So the first one, without
more ado, cut off the line; and the unhappy girl fell down and was
killed. Then she asked the second girl, "Well, now, sister, perhaps we
shall find only one man and we shall both of us marry him. Shall we then
have quarrels as usual?"--"Of course we shall," answered the girl. So
she cut her line, and the poor girl fell back to the ground. After that
she herself climbed to the top of the rock. She was full of joy, so she
danced and sang:--

\[paragraph continues\] The top of the mountain was a high plateau. She
walked across it and after a while she saw a house, well arranged and
quite large. She entered. The furniture and appurtenances were of the
best, but people there were none. Along the walls stood long rows of
boxes and bags filled to the brim with costly furs. She opened one box
and entered it. Then she closed the lid above her, and waited for
events. In the evening a man came. It was One-Side. He had one leg, one
arm, one side, one eye. As soon as he entered, he said aloud, "Chimney,
burn! Teapot, bubble! Kettle, cook food! Take off my boots! they are too
heavy." He lay down. The chimney began to burn, the teapot bubbled, the
meat in the kettle was done just right. His clothes and boots were taken
off and hung up to dry. Still the girl could not see anybody. The next
morning One-Side went off. Then the girl left the box, and again
investigated the house. Not a living person was in it. At last behind
the chimney she saw a large flint stone. She lifted it; and under it
there were mice and ermine, worms, flies, mosquitoes, and all kinds of
larvae, as many kinds as existed in the surrounding country. Some were
sewing and some were weaving, some scraping skins, and some again
currying soft hides. These were the female assistants of One-Side. The
girl felt jealous and angry. She filled with water the largest kettle
that she could find. She hung it over the fire and when the

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

water was scalding hot, she poured it over the vermin, and scalded them
all to death. After that she crept back into the box and waited till
evening. One-Side came home, and called aloud, "Chimney, burn! Kettle,
bubble! Let meat be cooked! Take off my boots! I am very tired." He
waited and waited, but nothing happened. The chimney did not burn, the
kettle did not bubble, and nobody came to take off his boots. "What is
the matter with them? Perhaps my incantations have lost their power.
Maybe I am going to die. Then let me have a last look upon my peltries.
Before I die, I want to see once more my wealth, my goods, peltries, and
clothes." He carried all his bags and boxes into the middle of the house
and opened them one by one. At last he found the girl. "Ah, it is you!"
said One-Side. "Come out! You have destroyed all my people. It seems you
object to having servants and female assistants: so now just stir about
yourself and make yourself useful. Get the household things ready. In
the morning three reindeer herds will come to you. You must catch the
living-reindeer and harness them to the sledges, and then move away to
another place. He did not indicate the place where she was to go. Early
in the morning, before sunrise, she awoke, arranged all the sledges, and
was ready to move. Then the three reindeer herds came to her. She caught
all the pack-reindeer and attached them to the sledges. After that she
drove on in front of the first line of sledges, as is customary. She
looked back and saw all three lines of sledges, ever so long. Thereupon
she rejoiced, and struck up her song:--

<tr class="odd">
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>What an active one,<br />
What a clever one!<br />
I arose early,<br />
And got myself ready.</p>
<p>My moving road,<br />
Just like a new-spun thread,<br />
So straight it is,<br />
So finely it is done."</p></td>
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>Какая удалая,<br />

Такое прямое<br />
Такое хорочее.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

Then she continued:--

<table data-cellspacing="0" data-border="0" data-cellpadding="9" width="798">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />

<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>Кабы мнѣ худыя резвины,<br />

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

Then she saw some tent poles on the trail. They were of the poorest
kind; but she took them and pitched her tent. She slept alone in this
tent; and the next morning she moved on; and so throughout the day from
sunrise to sunset.

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

She sang again:--

<table data-cellspacing="0" data-border="0" data-cellpadding="9" width="798">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>"I wish I had some good tent poles!<br />
I should pitch my tent,<br />
My husband would come<br />
To sleep with me."</p></td>
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>Кабы мнѣ хорошія резвины,<br />
Я бы руйту ставила,<br />
Мой мужъ бы пришелъ<br />
Со мной ночевать.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

She saw some tent poles on the trail. They were of good quality. So she
pitched a large tent, new and handsome. In the evening a young man came
who wanted to stay. She saw him coming, and met him outside. "Who are
you, and what do you want?"--"I am your husband."--"No you are not! My
husband is one-sided, and his name is LI'ġIman."--"I say I am your
husband." He went out and climbed a tree. Then he turned to the sun
once, twice, three times, and was again one-sided. "There!" said he,
"you would not believe me, although I am your husband. See, now! I am
one-sided again." She felt much joy that he was really her husband. He
turned three times toward midnight and became again a young man, quite
handsome, and clad in white skins. They entered the house and slept
there. In the morning they moved on. On the way they saw a lake. Some
people were playing football on the ice. One of them shouted, "Ah, ah!
Run home and tell the chief that his daughter is coming." They came to a
village. The front house was covered with black skins as a sign of
mourning. It was the house of her father and mother They arrived at the
house. The old people ran out and rejoiced. From mere joy they fell down
and became ashes that were scattered by the wind. The end.

Told by Innocent Korkin, a Russianized Yukaghir man, in the village of
Pokhotsk, the Kolyma country, summer of 1895.
