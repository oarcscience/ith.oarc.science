### 10. STORY OF A SMALL GIRL.

There was an old man and an old woman. They had no sons or daughters so
they prayed to God, and he sent them a son. He grew up quickly, and was
useful in their household work. One morning they ordered him to start a
fire. He climbed to the roof and pulled the skin stopper out of the
chimney. Then he kindled the fire, and it flamed up brightly. He wanted
to put the teakettle on the burning coals; but the kettle was set awry,
and reclined to one side. Some of the scalding water poured out on the
boy's hand. He let go of the kettle, and it was nearly overthrown. The
father and the mother grew angry and gave him a severe spanking. "In
vain was

it that we prayed to God for you. Better were it if we had prayed for a
little girl." The old woman wanted to put the kettle in order, but she
could not even move it from its place. Then the boy put the teakettle
upon the hearth, at a safe distance from the fire. The old woman said
again, "Bring some wood. We will cook the elk head." He brought the wood
and the elk head, and she cooked it; but the head remained tough,
however long she cooked it. Meanwhile the old woman did not feel well.
She lay down on the bed and brought forth a girl. This girl grew up in a
couple of days, and was able to work. The old man said, "Thank God, we
have a girl now! She shall work for us and do everything." Again the
girl cooked the elk head, and when it was done they ate of it; but the
boy had a bone stick in his throat, of which he died. The old man and
the old woman cried from grief, and repeated, "Ah, ah! we have a girl
now, but the boy is gone."--"It was you, old fool! who complained of the
boy," said the old man to his wife. After that he went chopping wood,
and in his grief he cut his foot. He came back to the house; and the old
woman said, "I always knew you were very clumsy." He grew angry, and
struck her neck with his ax. Both fell down and died. The girl also
died. The end.

Told by Kitty, called the Lamut girl, a Russian creole girl, aged
twelve, in the village of Nishne-Kolymsk, summer of 1896.
