### 3. YUKAGHIR TALE.

There were two sisters. One time they walked about and met
Kosetóka. <span id="fr_99"></span>[2](#fn_99) The first sister saw him,
and immediately let herself fall down, pretending to be dead. He came to
her and investigated the body. He found an aperture in the hind part,
and said, "Ah! this is the wound." Then he put his finger into the wound
and smelled of it. "Ah!" said he, "bad odor. Probably she was killed
long ago." Then he stooped down and smelled of the pretended wound. "Too
bad!" said he, "I will not eat of it." <span
id="fr_100"></span>[3](#fn_100) The other sister was deaf, and did not
hear his words. All at once she looked back and saw the monster. "Ah,
ah!" said he, "this is fresh meat. I will cook some of it for today."
She retorted, "Better let us go and have a little play! After that you
may eat me." They went to a lake which was frozen. "Let us have our play
hereon the ice." The woman had two round stone scrapers concealed in her
bosom. "Here, sister! what shall we play!" asked the monster. The woman
put her hand into her bosom and took out one of the scrapers. This she
jerked out suddenly, and threw it on the ice. It rolled down with much
noise. "Ah sister! you have there some very nice playthings."--"You also
have similar playthings between your legs. There are two of them. You
may tear off one and throw it on the ice." He put his hand between his
legs and roared with pain. "Quick!" said the woman, "tear it off and
throw it down!" He threw his testicle

down on the ice. It made a shuffling noise and stuck to the ice. "Ah,
ah!" roared the monster, "now it is your turn!" The woman jumped up and
jerked out the other scraper. Doing this, she also roared feigning great
suffering. "Go along! It is your turn now!"--"Ah, sister! it is too
painful."--"For shame, I, a woman, can stand as much." He tore off the
other testicle, and immediately fell down on the ice. He was dead and
the woman ran home. "Ah, ah!" said she to her sister, "I have killed
him. We tried a new game, all of my own invention, and I killed
Kosetóka." The end. <span id="fr_101"></span>[1](#fn_101)

Told by Anne Sosykin, a Russianized Chuvantzi woman, in the village of
Markova. Recorded by Mrs. Sophie Bogoras, winter of 1900.
