### 7. THE ALDER-BLOCK. <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md)

There lived an old woman who had neither son nor daughter. One time
after cooking her supper, she climbed to the roof of her house to stop
up the chimney hole. Then she heard from within a small child's voice.
She was much frightened, but still she descended hastily and ran into
the house. An infant boy was lying on the floor. She swathed him in
swaddling clothes, and prepared food for him. She fed him on blood soup
and minced meat, and he grew from year to year. She gave him the name
Alder-Block. He was an excellent carpenter, and made excellent canoes of
boards and of hollowed tree trunks. One time he said to his foster
mother, "Mother, give me permission to leave. I want to visit all the
wonders of earth and sea." The woman said, "How can that be? And who
will then procure food for me? You are almost full-grown. All my hope
lies in you." Nevertheless, he left in the night time and went away
along across the sea. He traveled and traveled, and at last he saw an
island. On the island there stood a house. In it lived the witch,
Yagha. <span id="fr_41"></span>[2](#fn_41.md) She had three daughters, one
Five-Eyes Girl; another, Six-Eyes Girl; and the third, Eight-Eyes Girl.
She herself had ten eyes. The witch Yagha saw the canoe, and said to her
daughters, "Here, girls! get ready! a small reindeer is coming from the
sea. Do try and lure it hither." The eldest daughter cooked flour-cakes.
She filled a birchbark vessel as big as a man with them, and put it on
the shore as a decoy. She hid herself near by in order to catch the boy
as soon as he should land. The boy saw the birchbark vessel full of
cakes. He came close to the shore, and said aloud, "First eye, fall
asleep! second eye, fall asleep! third eye, fall asleep! fourth eye,
fall asleep! fifth eye, fall asleep!" The girl fell asleep. He emptied
the birchbark vessel into his canoe. He threw the vessel into the water,
approached the girl, and, taking off his breeches, he defecated upon her
head. After that he struck her back with the paddle, and broke her back.
That done, he

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

paddled away across the sea, back to his mother. So he brought to his
mother all those cakes. She was much astonished. She asked him, "O
child, Alder-Block Boy! where did you get all these cakes?"--"At such
and such a place." The boy told her everything. The old woman was very
much scared. "Now," she said, "I will not let you go even one step from
my side. The witch Yagha will devour you." That very night, as soon as
the old woman had fallen asleep, Alder-Block descended toward the water,
boarded his canoe, and set off again. The girls saw him, as before. They
prepared a vessel with cakes, and put it out on the shore. The second
sister hid nearby, ready to catch him. He paddled to the shore, and
called out aloud, "First eye, fall asleep! second eye, fall asleep!
third eye, fall asleep! and fourth and fifth and sixth eye fall asleep!"
Again, the girl fell asleep. He emptied the vessel into his canoe. Then
he defecated upon the girl, and broke her back with a blow of his
paddle. Then he paddled back across the sea with his booty. The girl,
however, came to, and crawled to her mother. The mother sprinkled her
with the water of life and youth, and the girl became as sound as
before.

The boy's mother took the cakes, but she reproached him. "O, child, you
go away secretly in the night time. I shall lose you and shall not know
where to find you. The witch Yagha will devour you. Do stop these awful
doings!" The very same night the boy went again. This time the youngest
daughter tried to catch him. She also put upon the shore a vessel full
of cakes, and hid near by. He paddled shoreward, and counted aloud,
"First eye, fall asleep! second eye, fall asleep! third eye, fall
asleep! Fourth and fifth and sixth and seventh and eighth, do fall
asleep!" He took the cakes and defecated upon the girl. Then he struck
her with the paddle upon the back and paddled away. The girl could
hardly crawl back to her mother. The next day he came again. This time
it was Yaghishna herself who tried to catch him. She put the vessel upon
the shore and hid near by. He counted aloud, "First eye, fall asleep!
second eye, fall asleep! third and fourth, fall asleep! fifth and sixth
and seventh, do fall asleep! eighth and ninth, do fall asleep!" but he
forgot the tenth eye. He took the vessel and emptied it into his canoe,
but the witch did not stir. He took off his breeches and wanted to
defecate upon her; then she caught him by the breeches and carried him.
home. "There you, dogs, you could not catch this small reindeer, but I
have caught him." They had an oven dug in the ground. The Yaghishna
said, "I will call my brother; meanwhile cook this reindeer for our
meal. When brother and I come back, we will have a meal of him." <span
id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42.md) She set off. The eldest daughter brought
an iron shovel,

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

and said to the boy, "Well, Alder-Block, sit down on the shovel." He
spread his legs and stretched his arms. She tried to put him down into
the oven, but could not do it. "Why," said she, "Alder-Block, you hold
your body too clumsily. Sit down on the shovel, then draw up your legs
and keep your arms together."--"How together? I do not know how. You had
better show me how."--"Look here, you booby!" She took a seat on the
shovel and held her body quite close. So he thrust her into the oven,
snatched the shovel back, and shut the oven door. In this way he killed
the eldest daughter of Yaghishna. The second daughter came and asked
him, "Oh, Alder-Block, what makes it smell so strong here of something
singed?"--"It does indeed," said Alder-Block, "Your sister singed a leg
of mine, and also an arm, but in the end took pity on me and allowed me
to live."--"I will show you what pity is. Sit down on the shovel, go
your way down into the oven." He spread his legs and stretched his arms
just as before. By no means could she thrust him down the oven. "Oh,
there! Alder-Block, you hold yourself quite in a wrong way. Draw up your
legs and keep your arms together."--"How together? I do not know how."
"Even so, you booby!" She sat down on the shovel and drew up her legs.
He immediately thrust her down into the oven and shut the oven door.
There she was roasted. The third one came too, the youngest one. "You,
there, Alder-Block! why does it smell so here of something
singed?"--"Yes, it does," said Alder-Block. "Your second sister singed a
leg of mine, and then also an arm. Then she took pity on me and let me
live."--"Oh, I will teach you what pity is! Sit down on the shovel, go
your way down into the oven." He spread his legs and stretched his arms.
She could not thrust him in. "Oh, there, Alder-Block! You do not hold
yourself right. You must draw up your legs and keep your arms
together."--"I do not know how. You must show me how." She sat down on
the shovel, and he thrust her into the oven. After a while all three
were done just right. He took them out of the oven, and drew them up to
the ground. Then he prepared the meal, cut the meat, and laid it out on
dishes and in troughs. All these he arranged on a large table. He put
the table near the large bed of Yaghishna, where she usually took her
meals and concealed all three heads under the bed near her seat. He hid
himself behind the chimney and waited for Yaghishna. After a while she
came back. She was driving the mortar, urging it with a pestle, and
effacing the traces of the sledge with a big broom. <span
id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43.md) She had not found her brother at home. So
she came all alone. She entered the house, and saw the food all ready
for a meal: so she felt gratified, and exclaimed, "See there! my
daughters have prepared the meal, and they themselves are gone, perhaps
for a little walk." She

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

took a seat near the table and tried to eat, but the first mouthful
stuck in her throat. "Oh, oh, oh!" said the witch, "what is the matter?
Why does even the first mouthful stick so in my throat? Is it possible
that Alder-Block is a kinsman of mine?" She took another morsel, but
could not swallow it at all. She spat it out, and looked down under the
bed, and there were the three heads of her daughters. She clapped her
hands and wailed aloud, "Ah, you hound, Alder-Block! You have eaten all
my daughters, and none has stuck in your throat." She looked around, and
found the boy behind the chimney. "Ah, ah, now I have you." She caught
him by the nape of the neck and hurled him across the room and back
again. After a few kicks and pushes, he felt nearly dead. Then he called
aloud, "O, granny! that is enough. I want to ease myself before I
die."--"Go, then, and ease yourself." He ran to her storehouse. She had
there two wells,--one full of water of life and youth, the other full of
water of death. He drank his fill of the water of life and youth, then
he changed the places of both wells. After that he came back. He caught
Yaghishna and threw her across the room and back again. After a few
kicks, she felt very feeble, and asked of him, "O, Alder-Block! I want
to ease myself."--"All right, you may go." She went to the storehouse,
and wanted to drink of the water of life and youth, but instead she
drank of the water of death. After that she went back, hardly being able
to move. As soon as she stepped over the sill, her belly burst, and she
dropped down stone dead. The boy gathered all her wealth--the costly
furs, dried meat and fish, and all kinds of provisions--and took it to
his mother. He also took along the water of life and youth. His mother
drank of the water and became quite young, like a fresh berry. He became
immensely rich. The end.

Told by Katherine Rumiantzev, a Russianized Yukaghir woman, in the
village of Pokhotsk, in the Kolyma country, summer of 1895.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_40"></span>[55:1](tes28.htm#fr_40.md) This tale represents a
version of the well-known European story. Several details, however,
belong to the native life. The underground oven is a primitive device,
although it is not used at present in northeastern Asia, being
superseded by the so-called Russian oven, made of bricks or of beaten
earth. In more ancient times, the oven dug in the ground may have been
used by the natives.--W. B.--E. Cosquin, *l. c.*, vol. 1, 246--F. B.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[55:2](tes28.htm#fr_41.md) witch Yagha (Баба-Яга
literally, "(old) woman Yagha") is a she-monster often appearing in
Old-Russian folk stories. It is presumed that in the Star mythology the
witch Yagha was the personification of winter. Yaghishna is, properly
speaking, the name of the daughter of Yagha, formed with the Old-Russian
suffix *shna*, *vna*. Daughters of Yagha often appear in Russian tales;
but their name, Yaghishna, Is known only in the Kolyma stories. And, by
the way, those stories confuse the mother and her daughters, and call
the witch Yagha also Yaghishna. Yagha, Yaghishna of the Russian tales of
northeastern Asia, often appears as a being more like the American
Snenek than the Old-Russian Yagha (See, for Instance, No. 9 (p. 133) of
the Markova tales).--W. B.
