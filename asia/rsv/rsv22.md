<u>Choosing Life's Partner</u>

The cyclical calendar of the Vietnamese is used in choosing marriage
partners. The names of the animals of the zodiac are applied to the
twelve years which repeat themselves endlessly. Visits to a number of
temples or shrines will usually reveal somewhere a picture of the animal
which stands for the current year. Then below is a listing of the
animals and the approximate year for which it stands because the Chinese
new year comes at a different time than does the Western or Julian new
year.

<div align="center">

|                     |               |
|---------------------|---------------|
| 1965--Serpent/snake | 1972--Mouse   |
| 1966--Horse         | 1973--Buffalo |
| 1967--Goat          | 1974--Tiger   |
| 1968--Monkey        | 1975--Cat     |
| 1969--Cock          | 1976--Dragon  |
| 1970--Dog           | 1977--Serpent |
| 1971--Pig           |               |

When an individual is born, regardless of his sex or social status, he
is believed to have his destiny tied to the animal of his birth-year.
Now while some of the animals can live on good terms together, others
cannot: but it is generally accepted that the tiger and the pig, the cat
and dog, the serpent and the monkey, the horse and the goat, the mouse
and the buffalo and the dragon and the cock can do so. Yet most of these
cyclical animals cannot stand one another, and according to the
matchmakers guidebooks, this animosity is [expressible](errata.htm#31.md)
in four degrees of difference. These degrees are luc sung
(disagreement), luc hinh (argument), luc hai (violence or harm), and juc
tuyat (kills).

The first of these degrees of continuous disagreement is between:

<div align="center">

|                               |                                |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| \(a\) The mouse and the horse | \(d\) The tiger and the monkey |
| \(b\) The cat and the cock    | \(e\) The serpent and the pig  |
| \(c\) The dragon and the dog  | \(f\) The buffalo and the goat |

</div>

The second degree is that of struggles between:

<div align="center">

|                                 |                               |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| \(a\) The goat and the dragon   | \(d\) The pig and the monkey  |
| \(b\) The horse and the cock    | \(e\) The buffalo and the dog |
| \(c\) The serpent and the tiger | \(f\) The cat and the mouse   |

</div>

The third degree of inflicting physical harm of the first to the second
is:

<div align="center">

|                                |                              |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| \(a\) The mouse to the goat    | \(d\) The dragon to the dog  |
| \(b\) The buffalo to the horse | \(e\) The serpent to the pig |
| \(c\) The tiger to the monkey  | \(f\) The cock to the cat    |

</div>

The fourth and most permanent degree is that of killing of the second by
the first:

<div align="center">

|                                   |                          |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| \(a\) The mouse kills the serpent | \(d\) The dragon the dog |
| \(b\) The buffalo the goat        | \(e\) The horse the pig  |
| \(c\) The tiger the cock          | \(f\) The monkey the cat |

</div>

Analysis of these tables makes it apparent that a man born under the
auspices of the tiger might find happiness with a girl born in the year
of the pig. He should avoid marriage, however, with a girl born in the
year of the serpent, the monkey or the cock. The tiger-serpent alliance
would be quarrelsome; the tiger-monkey would result in fisticuffs; and
the tiger-cock union might result in death for the girl.

While Communism might well have begun to make changes in the thinking of
the Chinese in Red China, the consultation of a "learned man" or fortune
teller is sought in much of rural Vietnam, and perhaps even in the
cities more than generally admitted.

Vietnamese normally count age from the first day of the year in which
the individual is born with that year being numbered one. This is true
even if born just before the end of the year, for on the first day of
the new year, they become two years of age. This of course is quite
similar to the way that the racing stables count the age of their stock.
This does not infer, however, that the genuine birthday is not
celebrated, for often it is an occasion of special prayer to the
ancestors, extra flowers or food on the god-shelf to be found in almost
every non-Christian home, and perhaps the invitation of special friends
for the occasion, sometimes including a meal.
