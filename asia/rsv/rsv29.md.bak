<u>Joss Sticks</u>

Vietnam is a land of beauty and charm in spite of its horrors,
uncertainty of life and the frequency of sudden violent death due to
war. Added to a culture so different than normal for most Americans is
the odor of Nuoc-mam (Vietnamese fish sauce) and the wispy smoke of joss
sticks and incense burners, the latter two found on family altars,
spirit houses, and temple courtyards and before the figures of Buddha
which abound in great numbers.

Not all joss sticks are fragrant as some are primarily for smoke and
have only the faintest odor. However, the more favored joss sticks are
the ones with incense which serves both as a means of veneration and as
a practical deodorizer.

Few homes in Vietnam are without a joss stick to be utilized for some
reason, and in some seasons the burning of joss sticks seems to create
distinct fire hazards. When it is remembered that joss sticks are all
handmade, it does not take long to realize that this is quite an
industry. Basically the joss stick is made with a thin bamboo stick,
which is painted red, Part of the stick is rolled in a putty-like
substance-the exact formulae are guarded by their owners.

The putty-like substance is composed of the sawdust of such materials as
sandalwood and other fragrant plants mixed with water or another
evaporating liquid. Normally at least three different kinds of sawdust
are mixed for the best result. The ideal woods for this sawdust come
from the mountain forests and from Laos. Once the sticky brown mixture
is placed on ⅓ or more of the painted bamboo stick, it is placed in the
drying racks in the sun. It takes about two days of sunshine to dry the
mixture satisfactorily, and then these are brought indoors and placed so
that several additional days of drying time is allowed. This helps to
insure that all moisture has evaporated and makes a firmer better
product.

Once completed, the joss sticks may be placed into packages along with a
couple of candles for the altar, or placed loosely in larger boxes for
wholesale or retail distribution. Most of the work is done by girls,
who, with training and practice, can make about three thousand joss
sticks a day. It is possible for a hard worker to earn perhaps the equal
of a dollar for a full day's labor.

Joss sticks are very reasonably priced, and it is good for the common
people that this is so, for few acts of devotion could be complete
without the lighting of joss sticks. These may be placed in sand-filled
containers either in the temple courtyard or in racks located in front
or on top of an altar. Sometimes after burning joss sticks are placed in
front of a Buddha statue, the ascending smoke from the burning joss
stick is thought by some to have beneficial aid in pleasing that power
to whom worship is made, or prayers offered.

It is possible to purchase spiral or circular joss sticks which will
burn as long as one to three months with incense and smoke being cast
off night and day. Quite often walls, the ceiling and sometimes the
figures of devotion or veneration are smoked or darkened. Where the
buildings do not have adequate ventilation, the spaces above the doorway
level may be perpetually gray with smoke. The overwhelming fragrance of
the burning joss sticks may also cloak any unpleasant odors that might
detract the worshipper from his devotion, or which could offend the one
to whom petitions are being made.

While the Chinese families of Southeast Asia use many joss sticks, it is
doubtful if they use more than the Vietnamese families who may combine
animism, Confucianism, Hinduism, and Buddhism and sometimes even parts
of the Christian acts of worship. To so many of these folk, it would be
more unwise to forget, ignore or omit the acts of worship where the joss
sticks are a basic element, than it would be to step in front of a
speeding truck. It might miss you, but the angered "spirits" would not!
