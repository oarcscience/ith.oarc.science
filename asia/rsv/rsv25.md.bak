<u>The Vietnamese and Children</u>

The great Chinese Empire left a vivid and deep impression during its
more than 1,000 years of social and political domination in Vietnam. One
writer had said that the Vietnamese are more bound by Chinese tradition
than are the Chinese themselves. Confucian values derived from ancient
China saturate Vietnamese ideas of family patterns and behavior. For
instance, Confucianism promotes marriage over celibacy, and defined
women's happiness in terms of her ability of having many children. With
few exceptions, even today in Vietnam, women are expected to be married
not later than about twenty years of age and to have children frequently
thereafter. Out-of-wedlock children are not generally approved; their
birth is severely censored: in a family-centered society as Vietnam is,
the place of such children is quite difficult.

While neither Confucianism or Buddhism makes much of an issue of
childbirth, the Vietnamese varieties seem to offer both help and solace
to women. The woman who is eager to have children may petition Buddhist
divinities in especially auspicious temples, or appeal to family
ancestors for help. Hannah, in the Old Testament, did a similar thing in
appealing to God for the birth of Samuel.

Some barren women seek medical attention, others look to sorcerers, but
it seems that an even larger number appeal to deities for children. It
is doubtful that there is a non-Christian home in Vietnam that does not
have its shrine. Many villages have a protective Spirit, and shrines
dedicated to them and other Spirits are found in abundance. So serious
is the lack of posterity to Vietnamese women, that few would hesitate to
lodge appeals to the spirits which reside in such places. To obtain the
intervention of these supernatural figures, tradition provides definite
ritualistic activities.

The supplicant woman must prepare herself for communication with the
"gods", and to promote rapport refrains from using meat, onions, garlic,
etc., for strong odors-save those of burning incense are not acceptable.
A number of baths as well as repeated washings of hands and face are
part of the ritual also. Then wearing their finest apparel and carrying

the traditional offerings of vegetables, fruit, flowers, votive objects,
betel nut, chicken, glutinous rice, incense, etc., they go to the
temple. Having lighted their joss sticks, clapped their hands and bowed,
they enter the temple from the courtyard and follow a standard pattern
in bowing, reciting prayers, and expressing solemn wishes to have a
child. Sometimes they have the bonzes write prayers on paper which is
then burned so that the spirits may receive them.

Among the "gods" called upon in particular are Lieu Hanh, Tan Vien, and
Hung Dao. These gods are the most frequently visited at the beginning of
the lunar year. In the town of Huong Tich of Ha-dong province, now in
North Vietnam, there is a grotto which has a number of vaguely
human-shaped rocks called "Young Girls' and Young Boys' Rocks". After
paying proper devotions, the supplicant woman chooses one of these
"children of Buddha" and caresses it with exhortations to follow her
home. She then goes home convinced that "Buddha's Child" is accompanying
her, and in attempts to please it, she buys both sweets and toys, and
will even pay double bus fare so that "it" can ride beside her.

From that day forward, a place for "it" is made at the family table,
with a cradle being prepared at night until the day when the "invisible
visitor" finally decides to become a member of the family. Such a child
is referred to as a "prayed-for child" because he is an answer to
fervent prayer and the parents tend to spoil it.

In Vietnamese homes may often be seen three porcelain or painted figures
symbolizing happiness, wealth and long life. Long life is shown as a
kindly old man with white snowy hair; a mandarin in fine robes
symbolizes wealth; happiness is characterized by the figure of a father
affectionately holding a smiling healthy child in his arms. The last is
typical of the Vietnamese delight in children. The expectant mother
often purposefully wears clothing which will call attention to her
hopes, especially if it is her first baby. In accord with this, it is
proper at TET, the Vietnamese New Year, when meeting a lady near
delivery time to wish her "a boy at the beginning of the year and a girl
at the end" implying a large family of course.

Different peoples look at the same events of life with differing
attitudes. Who's right? Maybe both; maybe neither! But it's Vietnam!
