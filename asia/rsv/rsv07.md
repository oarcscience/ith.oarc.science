### IV. HINDUISM IN VIETNAM

Hinduism, like Buddhism, came from India to Southeast Asia. In contrast
to the prevalent Buddhism of Vietnam, however, Hinduism came directly
from India to this area without undergoing the transformation created by
Chinese influences. While Hinduism is perhaps older than Buddhism,
Confucianism or Taoism, it was not a major influence in Southeast Asia
until the early Christian Era. While several reasons for, the timing of
its arrival in Southeast Asia might be given, a major cause seems to
have been the cessation of gold supplies from Siberia. Moreover, the
Roman Empire merchants and the Indians were unable to solve this
shortage so that it was necessary for them to seek their own supply.
Since the Indian legends in Sanskrit had long used the terms
"<u>suvarnadvipa</u>" "the island of gold" and "<u>suvarnabhumi</u>"
"lands of gold" in reference to Southeast Asia, it was quite natural
that expansion of trade and commerce would be in this direction by sea
routes as well as by land.

As the merchants and tradesmen came to Southeast Asia, many of them
married into the leading indigenous families and settled down for a long
time in the area. The marriages opened business contacts and promoted
rapport between the merchants and their customers. Because the women
were subservient to their husbands, Hindu religious beliefs and customs
became their religion and that of their children. As the merchant
families grew in size and number, the pervasive Hindu settlement
developed into a city-state in the first century A.D. The first of these
Hindu city-states in Southeast Asia was Funan, with Funan located in
what is now Cambodia. In Vietnam itself the first settlement of
importance was Ha-tien on the gulf of Siam.

The most noted and important of the Hinduized Southeast Asia
civilizations was that of Angkor which was a composite of Hindu Indian
and indigenous influences. As such, it was a major force in Southeast
Asia for some time, and its influences spread throughout much of the
area either directly or through the descendents of this ancient kingdom
whose major contribution to this century is the ruins at Angkor. Within
Vietnam, the major importance of the foregoing is that the Champa
Kingdoms originated from this blending of Indian and Southeast Asian
religions, doctrines, ethics, art, literature, institutions, ideas and
wisdom. Champa in her might and religious zeal constructed prodigious
temples in various areas under her control. Since the Champa Empire
occupied the Vietnamese coast line from north of Hue’ southwards, and
was not finally eradicated until less than two hundred years ago, its
influence may still be seen in Vietnamese life. While the political
might of the Champa Empire was destroyed about 1471, succeeding kingdoms
were built on the same concepts until the Vietnamese finally
consolidated their control of the whole geographic area of Vietnam.

Currently, the Hindu adherents in Vietnam seem to be the Indian merchant
families found in the larger cities and the Cham people who are
estimated to be 15 to 45 thousand persons. The Champa museum in Danang
reveals that the Champa people were greatly influenced by Hinduism, as
are most of the Chams today, even though their Hinduism is mixed with
animism, etc. A number of the daily practices of the ethnic Vietnamese
families also seem to have a Hindu origin. This is especially true in
the rites of healing for the sick, and in such practices as winding
string about the house to ward off evil spirits.

Awareness of the subtle presence of Hinduism may provide explanations
for some of the customs and religious acts which are seen among the
ethnic Vietnamese. When the blending of other religious forces in the
lives of the Vietnamese people does not readily explain a prevailing
practice, an explanation should be sought in Hinduism. Its influence
also helps explain some of the statuary found in the various temples of
Vietnam.

The more obvious Hindu concepts in Vietnam are discussed in the Cham
Tribal Study in <u>THE PEOPLE OF THE TRIBES OF SOUTH VIETNAM</u>.
