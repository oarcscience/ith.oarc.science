### I. ANIMISM

Centuries of animism, ancestor veneration, Hinduism, Taoism, Buddhism,
Christianity, etc., have deeply etched the cultural influences in
Vietnam. Each of these religions has affected the Vietnamese culture so
that at the present time behavior patterns and customs subtly, or
obviously, reflect these concepts. The Vietnamese do not make the
distinctions between secular and sacred as clearly or precisely as do
most Westerners. Therefore the total life of the Vietnamese peoples is
much more affected by religious concepts than seems to be the pattern in
America. The primary or basic religion of Vietnam seems to be that of
Animism. Animism is the religious faith of nearly all the tribes-people,
or as the French called them, Montagnards. Traces of Animism are found
also in most of the other major religious faiths in Vietnam today.

Animism, currently called "People's Religion" by some, is a belief "in
spirits." These spirits may be those of deceased persons or inanimate
objects such as stones, rivers, mountains, trees, etc. The basic core of
Animism is the belief that spirits by appeasement can be used to create
good, or pleased so that they will not create harm, danger and trouble.
Moreover, each person has a spirit without which sickness and death
would soon occur. This spirit continues to exist even after death has
claimed its possessor. The death of the person creates a demand for the
provision of the needs and desires of the on-going spirit. Unattended or
dissatisfied spirits may become angry, bitter, or revengeful. They may
seek to re-enter the present life which will create havoc and harm in
numerous ways.

Because of the spirit's ability to continue an independent existence, it
must be cared for properly. As spirits are associated with people,
Animists perceive them to be greedy, deceptive, unpredictable, and
possessing every trait known to man. Normally, the departed spirits of
the good do not create too much concern if the proper rites are
performed at the appropriate times, especially those rites which will
send them happily on their way to the "spirit world."

However, those people who die violently cause great fear as their
spirits may be embittered by such a fate and create havoc to
individuals, families or communities. Violent deaths include accidents,
war, those killed by tigers, women who die in childbirth or die
childless, or those whose bodies are not recovered and properly buried
or cremated.

Animists seem more anxious to placate angry or evil spirits who pose
constant danger than to seek the favor of the happy or good spirits who
may help them. In this sense, fear of the evil wins out over honor
toward the good. Because of such concepts, animistic rites become
methods which utilize fetishes, blood sacrifices, symbolic designs,
magic words, taboos, etc. These are techniques which cause the spirits
to do the will of the worshipper.

The animist does not view himself as a helpless or passive victim of the
invisible world. He views himself as one who by use of the proper
religio-magic formulae may achieve his own goals. The various spirits to
be placated are from human, animal and inanimate sources. The animist
expends much of his thought, effort, energy, and wealth in religious
observances designed to channel the powerful forces to his benefit and
in accord with his own desires.

To the animist all existence is one and the same thing, and has no
permanent divisions or distinctions of animate and inanimate, human or
non-human. Everything past and present is contemporary. This requires
that all rituals must follow the prescribed pattern to avoid discomfort
to the spirits. Living in fear as he does from birth to death, the
animist is almost obsessed with religious observances as he seeks to
placate one spirit or the other. He seeks to avoid offending any spirit
that may cause trouble.

Animism is basically non-ethical and non-moral. The aim of the animist
is not to have his character transformed or changed. It is to create the
proper atmosphere so that spirits will comply with the will and wish of
the animist. Therefore he does not hesitate to utilize any means which
will provide him the protection which he desires, since these are merely
means

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

whereby he may relate to his world in a meaningful manner. This is
especially true in the more backward areas where Animism is yet
untouched by other religious concepts. The animist in his continuous
power struggle with the invisible world grapples for the best advantages
so that he may avoid that which seems otherwise certain and dreadful.

The animist has a pantheon of spirits which range from those in man to
those in birds, animals, rocks, trees, streams, etc. He is constantly on
the lookout for those who demand immediate attention, and the situations
which cannot be ignored with impunity. Because this search is aided by
religious "personalities", the sorcerer, magician, or shaman, these
persons occupy positions of peculiar importance, power and influence.
Since these persons have prestige and special powers in the mind of the
animist, special care must be taken by Americans in dealings with them,
in discussions about them, or in encouraging courses of action not
agreeable to them.

Blood sacrifices, either of fowl or animals, may be used for both
fertility and ceremonial rites. They are performed at childbirth,
weddings, funerals, etc., and may be offered to either good or evil
spirits as the occasion demands. Despite the objections of the French
previously, and the Vietnamese currently, some of the animistic
tribesmen are believed still to practice the sacrifice of human beings
for the puberty rites for young men and also as supreme offerings of
appeasement to spirits troubling individuals or communities. The
identity of these spirits is determined by the sorcerer through
appropriate rites. (These are described in some detail in THE PEOPLE OF
THE TRIBES OF SOUTH VIETNAM, a companion study soon to be published.)

Blood sacrifices of various kinds may be offered to the spirits for
protection, health and prosperity, events relating to birth, marriage,
death, drought, warfare, choosing a new field, building a house,
planting a crop, harvesting that which has been grown in the
swidden-patches, etc. It is through such sacrificial rites that the
Vietnamese animist seems to find order and meaning in his life, and they
provide that which is essential to integration and sanity.

The simple animist places great emphasis on omens which may be in dreams
or signs. These are believed to be sent by spirits to warn of future
evil or good. If the animist sees the track of a certain animal on his
path in the jungles, it is indicative that if the traveler continues his
journey, he will surely meet the "evil one" himself. He must therefore
return to his home or village and consult the sorcerer to determine when
it will be safe to continue his trip, or if his plans must be radically
changed. If during a wedding, a dog sneezes, the animists of Vietnam
believes this to be a sign that the marriage is not a wise one. Normally
the ceremony is halted immediately. If the couple insists on completing
their wedding, some terrible fate is believed to await one of them. The
tribesman on the way to his fields may notice a bird perched on a nearby
bush or tree, and he will carefully look to see the direction in which
it flies. If it goes to the left, friendly spirits are warning him of
impending danger, making it necessary for him to retrace his way home
immediately.

The animist perceives of sickness, disease and death as being
spirit-related, so that treatment is given to appease the spirit rather
than directly to cure the ailment. Because death claims such a large
number of children in Vietnam, especially among the primitive tribesmen,
the fear of evil spirits causes parents to give their children
"nick-names" while their given names are kept in the strictest of
confidence. The use of such nick-names is an attempt to fool the evil
spirits so that they will not seize the child and take away its spirit.
Sometimes little boys are actually nick-named after female organs as the
parents believe this will surely fool the bad spirits. They are
sometimes named after the various animals so that when they are called,
the lurking evil spirits will not recognize that the children are being
addressed and will not harm them. Many of the children have nick-names
that when translated sound unsavory to Americans, but when it is
recognized as a defense procedure by parents, it can be appreciated.
Especially is this true when it is realized that three grown children
out of ten births is considered fortunate among some of the Vietnamese
peoples.

Sometimes little boys are dressed as girls to fool the spirits who would
prefer boys. Their hair is often cut so that the spirit will be fooled.
The long hair is believed to hide the place where the child's spirit
actually resides and under this cover the evil spirit cannot find it.

The head is believed to be the residence of the "spirit". The older folk
and those less acquainted with Americans, may be disturbed if a stranger
pats their children on the head since this may be viewed as an attempt
to steal the child's spirit. This concept of the residence of the soul
or spirit is widespread and it is often found among the other major
religions in Vietnam. Those acquainted with this almost natural

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

reaction of Americans to children may view the matter quite differently
from those who have learned about Americans from antagonistic sources.
The communists, for example, carefully study ways to use the various
religious beliefs as means of preventing success in the joint
Vietnamese-American efforts to bring peace to Vietnam.

Quite frequently mirrors are placed by the doorway of a home, or placed
within the house so that they reflect anyone entering. This position is
carefully chosen in order to cause an evil spirit to become frightened
when it sees itself in the mirror and not enter the home.

Because of the belief by many that sickness and death are caused by
spirit activities, jokes dealing with these topics are considered
shocking, irreverent, and could provoke evil spirits. The Vietnamese may
smile at the joke for politeness sake, but esteem for the American may
be lessened.

Beliefs arising within Animism give rise to the demand that proper
disposal of the dead be made to avoid creating a wandering spirit. It is
the same religious concept that encourages the mutilation of corpses by
the enemy. This has psychological impacts often not fully appreciated by
the Americans. It is this same fear that causes afterbirth to be taken
some distance into the jungle by the tribespeople and buried quickly
lest it attract evil spirits who will then cause the baby's death.

Among some of the tribespeople, it is fear of the spirits which causes
them to build their houses in a certain direction with doors on only one
side so that the evil spirit who always travels in one direction cannot
enter home. It is a similar concept that causes a number of Vietnamese
to place the various red papers which represent the god of the threshold
or doorway on or near the doorposts to frighten evil spirits. This
belief also underlies the custom practiced by many folk who avoid
carrying a small child across the [threshold](errata.htm#2.md). Instead
they carefully hand it across the [threshold](errata.htm#3.md) to prevent
evil spirits entering the house with the baby and taking its spirit
while it is unguarded. This fear of evil spirits accounts for the
strings often seen about the wrists and the necks of small children to
guard against evil spirits. Fear of spirits also accounts for the
wearing of fetishes, charms, etc. Perhaps this is not too much different
from the customs of many Americans (who may be superstitious in spite of
their religious teachings, while the animists is superstitious because
of his religious beliefs).

Within many ethnic Vietnamese homes, forms of Animism are quite evident.
If sickness occurs, it is not unusual to have the shaman, the medicine
man, etc., come to give treatments. If the illness is that of a small
child, the question may revolve about an aunt that died childless, or an
ancestor who desires that his bones be given a more desirable location.
In such cases the Taoist or Buddhist bonze or even the shaman or
sorcerer, etc., is just the one to ascertain the answer. For a small
fee, some rice, a bit of tobacco, a chicken, or some betel (acreca)
nuts, a ritual is performed and the answer discovered. If it is the
ancestor's spirit who wants the bones reburied, this can be done. If it
is the maiden aunt's spirit which is troubled and creating the problem,
the solution may be to make little paper images of children and with a
bit of paper money, burn them. This sends them off to the spirit world
where the spirit is made happy, and the child is made well.

Sometimes treatment given to the ill is that of acupuncture (hot cups
are used to create vacuum burns or needles inserted about the body).
This treatment transfers the felt pain of the patient, and is used
sometimes to draw evil spirits out of the patient's body. Similar
medical treatment has also been used in the Western world of Europe and
North America and still may be found in other parts of the West.

Among the animistic tribespeople barriers are often erected along the
pathways leading to the village in order to keep evil spirits from
entering. These are carefully placed in accord with the sorcerer's
advice in order to be effective. It is vitally important to keep the
evil spirits from the village lest they bring sickness, hunger, harm,
danger, or even death to its residents. Sometimes the barricade may
simply be a board or bamboo fashioned in place across the path: it may
consist of amaze of barriers along part of the path so that several
turns must be accomplished to enter the village. The tribesmen believe
that human beings can figure out the maze, but that evil spirits do not
have the reasoning ability. Sometimes the approachway will feature quite
elaborate temptations to draw the spirit aside so he will forget his
mission, or it may feature attempts to frighten the spirits instead.

Fear creates various burial customs among the people. It is fear that
causes a tribe to bury its dead with exposed feet, or others merely to
place the body in a deep grave left open so that the spirit can return
to the village. Fear causes some tribes to tend the graves carefully
until a set time. Then after a [ceremony](errata.htm#4.md) of buffalo

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

sacrifice and wine drinking, the grave is completely abandoned. Fear of
spirits causes some animists to place their dead relatives parallel to
the side of their houses while awaiting burial. A stranger who dies is
placed perpendicular to the sides of the houses to prevent his spirit
from becoming confused with that of a dead inhabitant.

Within Animism, fear seems to be the dominant theme as it is the
constant companion of its adherents. Among the tribespeople who are not
Christian, fear determines who one will marry, where his crops will be
planted, where and how his house may be constructed, and may determine
his source of water, etc. It is the attempt to deal with this
overwhelming concern that creates the belief called Animism. Its
presence is so strong in Vietnam that few escape its influence entirely.
So while the animist may not have a formal creed or doctrine, he cannot
be classified as non-religious. Religious beliefs control him much more
than most Americans are affected by their faith. Since man is controlled
by his thought patterns, his behavior is in accord with his value
system. It is imperative that the Navy/Marine Team understand the value
systems of Animism, if friendship is to be developed, or if lasting
assistance is to be shared.
