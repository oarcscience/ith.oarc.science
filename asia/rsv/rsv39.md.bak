AFSC is initiating two programs. A child day care center, largely
staffed by Vietnamese, is being established in Quang Ngai. The primary
objective is the education and health of refugee pre-school children;
the long-term objective is to teach mothers better health and nutrition
practices. A second project is being explored; to find places for young
college graduates to work in programs directed by Vietnamese voluntary
agencies such as labor unions, student groups, and educational
institutions.
