<u>Vietnamese Village--Homes</u>

About 70 to 80% of the Vietnamese depend upon agriculture for their
livelihood, and normally live in small towns and villages along the
coast and in the Delta of Vietnam. The tribes-people of Vietnam, the
Montagnards, who form about 5% of the population live in 50% of the land
area of Vietnam which is composed largely of the mountains. Generally,
the Vietnamese rice farmer (rice raising is the major farm activity)
lives in small villages and walks to and from his various rice paddies.
Sometimes small boats are used to reach these fields by means of
irrigation canals and ditches and the rice crop is sometimes transported
to the village by boat when harvested. Since these folk constitute the
primary groups of people that the Navy/Marine Team contact daily in
pacification efforts, it is well to understand their way of life.

The farmer's house is built normally for practical uses rather than
beauty. It may have roofs composed of thatch or palm leaves, tile or due
to the current struggle in Vietnam, tin. Some Americans have observed
walls and roofs of houses made of uncut beer company tin with the
various advertisements of the companies already printed on the metal.
The story of how such commercially marked tin has reached such remote
areas and strange usage without first being formed into beer cans would
probably be an interesting one.

The house is normally made of such local materials as are available.
This may include bamboo, straw, mud, and other products of the area. The
mud may be daubed directly onto the plaited bamboo to form the walls. It
may be shaped as brick which can be sun-dried as adobe or, in more rare
cases, dried in regular kilns. With the current war effort, cement has
joined tin as a material used whenever it is available, Whenever the
house is made of mud or clay, the eaves of the thatched or tin roof are
extended well over the walls so that the heavy rains of the monsoons
will not wash the walls away. They also act as an aid to keep the house
cooler in the hot sticky climate of the major areas of Vietnam.

The house of the ethnic Vietnamese peasant class is normally divided
into three to five rooms of varying size. The main room is the central
one in which the ancestor shelf holds the place of honor. Even in the
poorer home, there is always a display of candlesticks, incense,
scrolls, tapestries, burners, and a shrine which contains the ancestral
tablets. These "sacred tablets" contain the names of ancestors through
the fourth generation to whom devotion is encouraged and expected.
Ancestral spirits are regarded as always present to witness happenings
in the family. Most Vietnamese, regardless of what other religious faith
is professed, are devotees of ancestor veneration, which has grown out
of the Confucian teachings instilled in Vietnam by the Chinese
occupation of over 1,000 years. Exceptions to veneration of ancestors
are the animistic tribespeople, who fear spirits but do not worship
ancestral spirits, and the Protestants who represent a small part of the
Vietnamese population, The Vietnamese Roman Catholic Church permits
ancestor veneration as a cultural expression of the commandment to honor
thy father and mother.

The main dwelling, even in the village, is normally built in a V shape
with space reserved for grandparents, parents and children. Servants and
hired farm hands may be quartered either in the main house or small
houses of their own in the same compound. The family compound also
contains shelters for the oxen or buffalo, farm tools, grain storage,
the inevitable pig sty and chicken pen. Often a small garden of
vegetables,

a tank for storing rain water, as well as a pond or pool where the
children and adults bath and wash both clothing and dishes, complete the
interior of the compound which maybe enclosed in a wall of greenery.
This screening wall of growing plants-areca palms, guava trees, mango
trees, bamboo clumps, banana trees, etc.-protect the occupants from
curious villagers and others who pass by.

The streets of many villages are little more than winding paths. The
barking of numerous dogs and the presence of many small children, make
the arrival of a stranger in "town" a well known fact within an
exceedingly short time. The attitude of both children and adult
villagers quickly reveal indifference, friendliness, hostility, etc., as
determined by the action of previous Americans or the villager's
awareness that Viet Cong agents are present and watching. An awareness
of such simple but obvious factors, as well as an understanding of the
multiple involved pressures on the villagers, can do much to aid the
success of assigned missions. The attitude, reaction and action of every
American is a vital consideration as the lowest man may cause the loss
of many lives or may promote such rapport that many lives are saved by
the [simplest](errata.htm#28.md) acts of kindness, consideration, concern,
or interest. The American serviceman benefits many as he reveals
interest in other people as human beings even if their language, their
culture and their daily life patterns do differ from America.
