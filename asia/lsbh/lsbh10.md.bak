### The Fifth Chapter

### PROFITABLE SAYINGS OF THE CHRISTIAN RECLUSES.

CLXXIV\. One of the Fathers said, "Young men in the beginning of their
career take unto themselves labours for the sake of vain glory, but
afterwards Divine grace secretly whispereth to them and persuadeth them
to labour for Divine and not for human glory."

CLXXV\. Another father said, "When God (Glory be to His Grace!) saw that
the Fathers were exalted in their minds, He used to send them to men who
wrought righteousness, even though they toiled little in the ascetic
life, in order that they might be abased somewhat. Thus He sent Antony
to a tailor, and Macarius to two women, and Paphnutius to a thief and a
singer, and He sent two solitaries to a shepherd."

CLXXVI\. It was said by God unto a certain man who was righteous
according to this world, "Flee from men and thou shalt live," God
indicating to him that he should go into the desert. Then a second voice
came to him, saying, "Flee, keep silence, and lead a life of
contemplation," that is to say, "When thou hast gone and hast become
mighty in the deeds of the ascetic life then thou shalt dwell alone with
thy soul <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md)."

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

CLXXVII\. A certain brother said unto one of the aged men, "My thoughts
wage war against me and say unto me, Thou art not able to fast and to
pray, therefore go out of thy cell, and depart and minister unto the
sick and let thy righteousness be sufficient for thee." The aged man
made answer to him, "Go, eat, drink, and labour not, only do not depart
from thy cell," for he knew that persistent dwelling in the cell would
cut off all \[his\] thoughts <span id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md).

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

CLXXVIII\. Another sage said, "He that dwelleth in the world seeth not
his sins by reason of the disturbed state of the affairs \[therein\];
but if he dwell in the peace and quietness of the desert, he will see
God clearly and his sins will be rebuked."

CLXXIX\. A certain noble and honourable and believing woman came from
Rome to Egypt to Abbâ Arsenius and entreated him to make mention of her
in his prayers. And he replied, "I will pray unto God that He may make
the remembrance of thee to pass out of my heart." Now although by reason
of her grief and sorrow she became sick, yet he did as he had said, that
he might shut the door against the women who thronged to see him <span
id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53.md).

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

CLXXX\. Abbâ Antony said, "As a fish which is lifted up out of the water
dieth, even so doth the recluse who tarrieth outside his cell."

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

CLXXXI\. Abbâ Theodore and Abbâ Luke remained for fifty years in doubt,
for they were vexed about the matter of changing their \[dwelling\]
place, and they said, "Behold, in the winter will we change \[it\];"
thus they did, and they did not go forth \[from it\] until the end of
their lives <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md).

CLXXXII\. One of them said, "The recluse who loveth a life of
contemplation in his cell doth not flee meeting his neighbour because he
despiseth and hateth him, but because of the sweet fruits which he
plucketh therefrom, that is to say, freedom from worldly toil and from
the sight and learning \[of the same\]."

CLXXXIII\. Abbâ Agathon kept a stone in his mouth for a period of three
years until he succeeded in keeping silence <span
id="fr_55"></span>[2](#fn_55.md).

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

CLXXXIV\. One of the old men gave a cup of wine \[twice\] to Sisoes the
great and he drank \[it\], but when he mixed it for him the third time
he would not drink, saying, "Forbear, old man, for thou knowest not
whether it be Satan," referring by these words to drunkenness which is
the mother of all vices <span id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56.md).

CLXXXV\. Abbâ Arsenius used, every Saturday night, to leave the sun
behind him, and to stretch out his hands towards heaven and to pray
until the sun rose in his face <span id="fr_57"></span>[2](#fn_57.md).

CLXXXVI\. Certain of the Fathers said, "Whosoever doth not receive all
the brethren alike is not, as yet, perfect."

CLXXXVII\. Certain philosophers went once on a time to the desert that
they might tempt the recluses,

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

and they said to one of the old men, "What do ye more than us? For we
fast, and pray, and watch, and lead lives of self-abnegation." And they
replied, "We do not only preserve our minds from turning to debating and
reasoning but every aspect of our minds is in converse with God."

CLXXXVIII\. Abbâ Macarius the Great arrived at so great a pitch of
humility that when the brethren spake with him they spoke as unto a
saint, and the great old man answered them never a word. But when a
certain man of the brethren said unto him insultingly, "Ho father, if
only thou hadst been a camel thou mightest have stolen natron and they
would never have beaten thee," he gladly made answer unto them.

CLXXXIX\. Abbâ Ḳîrnên used to say <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58.md),
"If the man who dwelleth with a young man would be mighty in the ascetic
life, he will not descend \[from his cell\] even for a moment, and he
will not stretch himself out in his presence even for the sake of
comfort. For young men excite lust by means of their faces, which are
like those of women, and they stir up tribulation by their audacity."

CXC\. When Abbâ Pachomius was afflicted by the

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

passion of fornication he used to cast himself down naked before a
hyaena's den, and take a desert viper and press it upon his body that it
might bite him and that he might die. And he never went into a city or
into a village, so that he might not see a woman <span
id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_59.md).

CXCI\. Once on a time Abbâ Abraham said to Abbâ Sisoes, "Father, thou
art grown old, let us now go and live among men for a little." And he
replied, "Let us go where there is no woman <span
id="fr_60"></span>[2](#fn_60.md). This he said not

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

because he was afraid for himself, but that he might warn his disciples
not to fall.

CXCII\. Abbâ Ammon used to say, "There are some men who might live in
their cells for a hundred years, and yet not know how it is meet for a
recluse to live therein <span id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_61.md)."

CXCIII\. Abbâ Agathon said, "The man of anger will never be accepted by
man, even though one rose from the dead."

CXCIV\. Once when Abbâ Moses of Paṭrâ was battling against fornication
he went to Abbâ Isidore \[for advice\]. And Isidore took him up upon the
roof of his house, and shewed him the hosts of devils waging war in the
west and the angels who were gaining the mastery in the east. This he
did to him so that Moses might be encouraged to fight, and he returned
to his cell <span id="fr_62"></span>[2](#fn_62.md).

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

CXCV\. Mother Sarâ fought for seven years against the demon of
fornication upon the roof until she had overcome him <span
id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63.md). She used to say, "Whenever I put my feet
upon the ladder to go up, I set my death before my eyes before I
ascend <span id="fr_64"></span>[2](#fn_64.md)."

CXCVI\. Concerning her it is said that she dwelt in an upper chamber
over the river, and that she never once looked out to see the river
which passed by the side of her cell <span
id="fr_65"></span>[3](#fn_65.md).

CXCVII\. There were two brethren who went back into the world and took
wives, but afterwards they repented and returned \[to their cells\]. And
when the period of their repentance was ended and they went forth from
their seclusion, the countenance of the one was transformed and was sad,
but the appearance of the other was fair to see and his face was
radiant. Now when the fathers saw them they were doubtful

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

if the repentance of each was equally \[sincere\], and they said, "The
one meditateth upon his sins and on hell, but the other on God's mercy
which is poured out abundantly upon all men <span
id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_66.md)."

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

CXCVIII\. One of the brethren asked Abbâ Sisoes, saying, "What wouldst
thou do, O father, for I have fallen?" Sisoes said to him, "Rise up,"
and the brother said unto him, "I have fallen many times and risen up
\[after them\]. How long shall I continue to fall and rise up?" The old
man said unto him, "Until death shall overtake thee in one of them, I
mean either in rising up or in falling <span
id="fr_67"></span>[1](#fn_67.md)."

CXCIX\. One of the brethren went into the world and married a woman, and
when his master heard thereof he prayed and entreated God, saying, "O
Lord, permit not Thy servant to be dragged through the mire of the
world;" and when the betrothed man and his bride went in to sleep
together, he gave up the ghost and was not united unto her.

CC\. One of the brethren was perfect to such a degree that even wild
animals became his friends, and he used to nourish their young <span
id="fr_68"></span>[2](#fn_68.md). Now a certain father

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

said unto him, "Go and enter a monastery of brethren, and dwell with
them if thou wishest to be perfect," meaning thereby that to dwell \[in
peace\] with the brethren was much more difficult than to live
\[friendlily\] with wild animals.

CCI\. Abbâ Poemen said, "An evil nature is a wall of brass between God
and man."

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

CCII\. When the mother of Abbâ Poemen and of his brethren went to see
them, they did not bring her into their cells neither did they speak
with her <span id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_69.md), thus keeping

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

the command of our Lord Who said, "Whosoever loveth father or mother,
&c. <span id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_70.md)"

CCIII\. Abbâ Ammon the virgin <span id="fr_71"></span>[2](#fn_71.md) once
went to Abbâ Antony and said unto him, "I observe that I labour in the
ascetic life more than thou, how is it then that thy name is more
renowned in the world than mine?" Abbâ Antony said unto him, "Because I
love our Lord more than thou."

CCIV\. Once a year Abbâ Arsenius used to taste once every kind of fruit
in order that he might give praise unto God, but Evagrius <span
id="fr_72"></span>[3](#fn_72.md) never at any time ate any fruit or any
green thing.

CCV\. Abbâ Poemen used to say, "As a snake or a scorpion having been
placed in a closed vessel for a long time will in process of time die,
even so will the wicked thoughts which are stirred up in the heart of
ascetics, unless they actually turn them into actions, become powerless
and perish."

CCVI\. Abbâ Jacob used to say, "For a man to teach his neighbour without
being asked to do so, is as if a man were to rebuke his neighbour."

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

CCVII\. A certain brother asked Abbâ Sisoes saying, "So then thou hast
not, O father, yet arrived at Antony's capacity \[for ascetic
labours\]?" The old man said unto him, "If I had had only one thought of
Abbâ Antony's my whole being would have been like a pillar of
light <span id="fr_73"></span>[1](#fn_73.md)."

CCVIII\. A certain aged man was asked by a brother, "When I am in the
place of purity, and the hour for prayer cometh, must I return?" The
aged man said to him, "Nay, brother. Who having been rich would return
to poverty?" Now he referred to the lifting up of the mind and to the
converse with God in the place of purity.

CCIX\. It is said concerning Saint Ammon <span
id="fr_74"></span>[2](#fn_74.md) the virgin

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

that when he was compelled by his parents to take a wife, on the night
of the feast, immediately after

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

going in with the bride to the feast, he brought out from his bosom the
Book of the Apostle Paul, and admonished and taught the young woman the
words which were written therein by the blessed man on virginity,
saying, "It is better for a man not to approach a woman <span
id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75.md), and I would that all men should live even
as do I in purity <span id="fr_76"></span>[2](#fn_76.md)," and again
\[where\] he saith, "The woman who hath never known man meditateth upon
her Lord, that she may be holy <span id="fr_77"></span>[3](#fn_77.md) in
her body and in her soul." <span id="fr_78"></span>[4](#fn_78.md) With
words such as these did he exhort his betrothed one, and they made their
bodies temples to the Holy Spirit.

CCX\. One of the old men said, "If thou seest a young man who lusteth to
go up to heaven of his own will, take hold of his leg and sweep him
thence."

CCXI\. One of the solitaries had so thoroughly dried up his body through
the labour of fasting and prayer that the sun could be seen \[shining\]
through his ribs.

follows:—"When Arsenius was in the <span id="page_39">p. 39</span>
palace he prayed to God, saying, 'O Lord, direct me how to live.' And a
voice came to him which said, 'Arsenius, flee from men and thou shalt
live.'" And again, when he was living in the monastery, he prayed to God
the \[same\] words, and again he heard a voice saying to him, "Arsenius,
flee, keep silence, and lead a life of contemplation, for these are the
roots which prevent a man from sinning." \#\#\# (fol. 197*b*, Nos. 1 and
