### Introduction

John <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) Abu’l-Faraj or Abu’l-Faraj
Gregory, the author of the "Book of Laughable Stories" printed in the
present volume, was the son of Aaron, a Jewish physician,<span
class="margnote">Early life and education of Bar-Hebraeus.</span> who
lived at Melitene; from the fact that his father was a Jew, the child
was commonly called by the Syrians "Bar ‘Ebhrâyâ" (*i.e.* the "son of
the Hebrew"), whence the name "Bar-Hebraeus". He was born A. Gr. 1537 =
A.D. 1226, and the early years of his life were passed in the diligent
study of the Greek, Syriac, and Arabic languages; philosophy and
theology next occupied his close attention, and he obtained a
considerable knowledge of medicine from his father and from other
celebrated physicians. When eighteen years old Bar-Hebraeus accompanied
his father to Antioch. Subsequently he went to Tripolis, \#\#\#, and
together with Ṣĕlîbhâ bar-Ya‘ḳôbh Waghîh \#\#\#<span class="margnote">He
is consecrated Bishop of Gûbôs.</span>, studied the healing art and
medicine with a certain learned Nestorian called Jacob; whilst there the
Patriarch Ignatius II. sent for them, and appointed Ṣelîbhâ Bishop of
Akko and Bar-Hebraeus Bishop of Gûbôs near Melitene. In the following
year Aaron of

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lâḳabhin near
Melitene left his flock and went to Jerusalem, and Ignatius II.
appointed Bar-Hebraeus to the vacant see. In I253 he was transferred to
Aleppo, and eleven years later he was raised to the dignity of Maphrian
by the Patriarch Ignatius III., Abbot of Gewîkhâth near Mopsuestia<span
class="margnote">Becomes Maphrian of the Jacobite Church.</span>. The
principal events which took place in connection with his ecclesiastical
rule are described by Bar-Hebraeus himself in his *Ecclesiastical
Chronicle* <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md), to which work the reader
is referred for information about the busy and most useful life which
this eminent man lived; the following account of his death we owe to his
brother Bar-Ṣaumâ. In the year 1286, when Bar-Hebraeus had arrived at
the sixtieth year of his age<span class="margnote">His forebodings of
death and superstition.</span>, he began to be afraid that his end was
drawing nigh, and he said, "I was born in the year when Chronos and Zeus
were in conjunction in the sign of the Zodiac Aquarius; twenty years
later when the same planets were in conjunction in the sign of the
Balance I was consecrated bishop; twenty years later when the same
planets were in conjunction in the sign of the Twins I was held to be
worthy of the office of Maphrian <span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2.md): and
twenty years later, when the same two planets shall again be in
conjunction in the sign of Aquarius, I believe that I shall depart from
this world." And he said, "O net of the worlds, in the year 1537
(*i.e.*, A.D. 1226) thy mesh did catch me; but I believe that in the
year 1597 (*i.e.*, A.D. 1286) I shall no longer be in thee <span
id="fr_3"></span>[3](#fn_3.md)." Throughout that unlucky

<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span>

year he continued to brood on these things and they could not be
banished from his mind. Bar-Hebraeus was then dwelling in the country
near Nineveh, and his brother Bar-Ṣaumâ, knowing that marauding<span
class="margnote">His brother's fears for his safety.</span> bands from
Syria were each summer in the habit of invading that district, and of
carrying people into captivity, and of plundering, and of spoiling and
laying waste the land about Nineveh far and wide, and believing his
brother to be quite incapable of taking steps to protect either himself
or his people, said to himself, "Peradventure he will fall into the
hands of these robbers, and the Maphrian's words will actually come to
pass." From that time on he ceased not to urge with great persistence
that Bar-Hebraeus should leave the district and betake himself to the
country of Marâghah<span class="margnote">Bar-Hebraeus is persuaded to
go to Marâghah.</span> in Adhôrbâîjân, that he might escape from the
death upon which he perpetually brooded. At length Bar-Ṣaumâ's
importunity had the desired effect and Bar-Hebraeus set out for Marâghah
and arrived there in safety. Here he was treated with the

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

greatest honour by men of every class, and the Arab nobles entreated him
to translate his Chronicle<span class="margnote">He translates his
Syriac Chronicle into Arabic.</span>, originally written in Syriac, into
Arabic <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md) so that they also might read
and enjoy it. To this he agreed, and he at once began to make the Arabic
translation, using the most beautiful and classical language for the
purpose; after working for a "month of days" he had finished the whole
translation with the exception of three folios. His death was, no doubt,
accelerated by this most laborious task, an idea of the magnitude of
which may be gained from the fact that the translation <span
class="margnote">He falls sick.</span>fills 565 pages in small 4to! On
the night of the Sabbath, the 27th day of the month Tammûz (July) he was
seized with fever, and he was consumed with heat the whole night long;
on the Sunday the physicians came and struggled to make him drink some
medicine, but this he refused to do, saying that drugs would do him no
good for his hour had come<span class="margnote">He refuses
medicine.</span>. It was noticed that he had been better and stronger in
his general health and body during that year than he had been for many
years past, but the fever had so weakened him three days later that,
when on the Sunday he asked for pen and paper to write and they were
given to him, he was unable to write at all;<span class="margnote">Is
prostrated by fever.</span> "and twice an hour he felt his left hand
with his right and said, My strength hath come to an end and is worn
out. Thou hast wronged me, O my brother, and hast not permitted me to
die and to be buried by the pious monks, and elders, and deacons, of
whom this day I have been the chief for twenty-two years. Thou

<span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span>

wouldst make me to flee from death, O my brother<span
class="margnote">His cheerful speech to his brother.</span>, but behold
the flight hath not benefited me. Be strong, however, and of good cheer,
and weep not, neither mourn immoderately as if some new thing had taken
place in the world. With these and such like words did he speak the
whole day, and he was cheerful and laughed, being not at all afraid of
death like other men. And he called straightway for Said the physician
and deacon and said to him, 'Write what I shall tell thee,' and he made
a beginning to his discourse \[with these words\]:—'The days of the
child of man are like unto the grass, and like the flower of the field
doth he grow up.' Then having completed the confession, as was right, he
brought forth with his hand two statutes, one for the patriarchal
throne, and the other for the throne of the Maphrian and for<span
class="margnote">His exhortations to the brethren.</span> the ordering
of his cell, and delivered them to his brother. And he began to give
commands to his disciples, saying, 'Abide in love, and depart not from
one another, and whensoever ye are gathered together in love I also am
in your midst.' But they, poor, wretched beings, rent their garments and
cast dust upon their heads, and were weeping until about three hours of
the night had passed, when he who meanwhile had ceased not to talk and
to laugh with a smiling face, went out like a lamp, or I should rather
say like a brilliant and splendid torch, and he departed<span
class="margnote">He dies.</span> to his Lord on the night of the
thirty-third day of Tammûz (July) in the year 1597," *i.e.*, A.D.
1286 <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md)<span class="margnote">Universal
manifestations of grief at his death.</span>

When the Catholicus Mâr Yahbh Allâhâ, who was at that time in the city
of Marâghah, heard of the death

<span id="page_xviii">p. xviii</span>

of Bar-Hebraeus, he ordered that no man should go into the market and
that no shop should be opened. The bell-ringer went forth and all the
people were gathered together to the Maphrian's cell, and the Catholicus
of the Nestorians sent there the pious folk who were with him, together
with a number of large wax candles to be burnt during the funeral
service, and the whole of the congregations of the Armenians and Greeks
came likewise; about two hundred were assembled there and they continued
in prayer from dawn until<span class="margnote">Sympathy of the
Christian sects.</span> the ninth hour. When the Nestorians, and the
Greeks, and the Armenians had ended their prayers and had buried him in
a suitable manner, they laid the holy body in the little altar at which
he was wont to pray and to make offerings all the time he sojourned in
Marâghah. Subsequently his body was removed to <span
class="margnote">His body is removed to the Monastery of Mâr
Mattai.</span> the Monastery of Mâr Mattai, which was built in the early
centuries of the Christian era in the mountain called Alpep by ancient
Syrian writers <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md), and Jebel Maḳlûb by
the Arabs, situated at a distance of a few hours to the north-east of
Môṣul (Nineveh). Here in a niche in the north-west corner of the same
chamber in which Mâr Mattai is buried, is the tomb of Bar-Hebraeus; the
Monastery is in the possession of the Jacobites, but it is sadly out of
repair and most things of value have been plundered by Kurds, and only a
few monks now live there. During the winter when the snow has fallen the
Monastery is difficult of access, and even when there is no snow the
path is steep and difficult <span id="fr_7"></span>[2](#fn_7.md).

<span id="page_xix">p. xix</span>

From the facts stated above it is evident that all the Christians in
Mesopotamia and in the countries about deplored the loss of Bar-Hebraeus
with sincere grief, and there is little doubt that he was the greatest
writer whom the Syrian Church ever produced <span
id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md). <span class="margnote">Great learning of
Bar-Hebraeus.</span>His knowledge of Greek and Arabic opened
store-houses of learning which were closed to most of his
fellow-countrymen, and his energy and general literary ability were
remarkable. His works shew that he had studied deeply many subjects of
which the other scholars of his Church were profoundly ignorant, and the
ready wit of his many-sided mind and his lucid style enabled him to
adapt the knowledge of extraneous and difficult subjects to his own
needs, and to express them simply but clearly for the advantage of his
readers. This is no place to give a catalogue of his works <span
id="fr_9"></span>[2](#fn_9.md), and it<span class="margnote">His untiring
energy.</span> must be sufficient to state that during the forty years
which he passed in the service of his Church—eighteen years as bishop of
various dioceses, and twenty-two years as Maphrian—he seems to have been
able to master the philosophy of the Greeks and the Arabs, and to have
made it available by his translations of their works for his
fellow-countrymen. Philosophy, theology, natural science, history,
medicine, the science of grammar, &c., were only a few of the subjects
in the knowledge of which he excelled, and it is evident from a perusal
of his works that he was no superficial student of the false sciences of
the day, I mean astrology,

<span id="page_xx">p. xx</span>

divination<span class="margnote">His service to the literature of his
country.</span>, and so forth. The service which he rendered to his
Church and her literature, and to his nation can hardly be
overestimated, and Western scholars owe him a great debt of gratitude
especially for his *Universal History*, his *Storehouse of Secrets*, and
his grammatical works.

The "Book of Laughable Stories"<span class="margnote">The Book of
Laughable Stories.</span> which is edited and translated in the
following pages, is a work which Bar-Hebraeus wrote in the late years of
his life <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md); it is called in Syriac
both "Book of Laughable Stories", \#\#\# <span
id="fr_11"></span>[2](#fn_11.md), and "Book of Refreshing "Stories",
\#\#\#. An Arabic version of this work was made by its author which was
entitled *Daf‘ al Hamm*, \#\#\# or "The Driving away of Care" <span
id="fr_12"></span>[3](#fn_12.md); manuscripts of both works are scarce. The
first <span id="fr_13"></span>[4](#fn_13.md) to make any portion of the
work known to scholars was Adler, who in his *Brevis linguae syr.
institutio*, Altona, 1784, published eight of the stories, which were
republished by Bernstein <span id="fr_14"></span>[5](#fn_14.md) and others.
In 1886 Morales published the text of sixty of the stories, with a
German translation <span id="fr_15"></span>[6](#fn_15.md) and vocabulary,
from the Vatican MS. No. CLXXIII. wherein the whole collection fills
foll. 80-158; this MS. seems to date from the XIVth century of our era,
but the last part of it was written by a later hand.

<span id="page_xxi">p. xxi</span>

The text here given is taken from the India Office<span
class="margnote">The MSS. of the work.</span> MS. No. 9, and from a copy
of the "Laughable Stories" in my own possession. The India Office MS.
consists of 444 paper leaves, measuring about 8 in. by 6 ¼ in. From fol.
1 to fol. 59, and from fol. 194 to the end the page is filled with two
columns of 29 lines each; but from fol. 60 to fol. 193 the page only
contains one column of 21 lines. The MS. is beautifully written in a
fine Nestorian hand, and vowels and diacritical points have been added
abundantly; two handwritings are distinguishable in the MS. The
"Laughable Stories" begin on fol. 351 *b*, col. 1, and end on fol. 413
*b*, col. 2; they were copied by the famous Hômô <span
id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md), the son of Daniel the elder, of Al-ḳôsh,
A. Gr. 2024 = A.D. 1712-13. My own copy is quite modern, but it was made
by a good scribe from an ancient manuscript; if only he had followed his
instructions and copied all the stories instead of making a selection
from them we should probably have gained several additional, important
textual variants. The MS. is in small quarto and the page contains
usually about 17 lines; the titles, headings of chapters &c., are
written in red, and at the end are a number of exhortations, of a
miscellaneous character, to the reader to lead a godly, righteous, and
sober life, followed by some verses on the death of the Patriarch John
bar-Ma‘danî, who died in 1263.

The "Laughable Stories" of Bar-Hebraeus are in<span
class="margnote">Description of the work.</span> number about seven
hundred and twenty-seven, and these are divided into twenty chapters
which vary in length. They were compiled from a variety of sources

<span id="page_xxii">p. xxii</span>

during the later years of his life, and it is clear from his Prologue
that he intended them to comfort, and amuse, and instruct those who read
them. That they were not written for his own nation alone is clear from
the fact that he recommends them to the Muslim, and to the Hebrew, and
to the stranger as well as to the Syrian. Men of every taste and
disposition can read therein with advantage, for the wise man will find
wisdom therein, and the fool folly, and the pious piety, and the gay
amusement, and the superstitious reasons for their superstitions.<span
class="margnote">The miscellaneous character of the stories.</span> A
certain number of the stories are coarse <span
id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) and refer to matters which are not
generally discussed in a book intended for popular reading, but the
compiler excuses himself for the insertion of such by saying that as "in
the tabernacle of wisdom every kind of thing is necessary, nothing
whatsoever that in a natural way sharpeneth the intelligence, and
enlighteneth the understanding, and comforteth and rejoiceth the mind
which is sorrowful and suffering should ever be rejected" (see p. 185).
From the India Office MS. we may learn that certain stories of this
class were not considered suitable for all readers, but the Western
reader will probably doubt the wisdom of the man who made the selection.
Thus the reader is told on the margin to skip (\#\#\#) No. CCCXXVII, yet
he is told to read (\#\#\#) No. CCCXXVIII, which is more coarse;
similarly he is told to skip Nos. CCCCVII and CCCCIX, but to read No.
CCCCVIII. No. CCCCXI is passed over without note or comment,

<span id="page_xxiii">p. xxiii</span>

as likewise is No. CCCCXXXVII, a most repulsive story. Whether we owe
these marginal notes to tradition or to Hômô the scribe is a matter
which cannot be cleared up at present. That any reference to the
relations between the sexes should be expunged from a book intended for
the use of monks or of men living in a monastery is not to be wondered
at, but that the reader should be specially directed to read certain of
the stories is a matter for surprise.

In reading the "Book of Laughable Stories" the most casual reader will
observe that Bar-Hebraeus must have spent considerable labour in
compiling his work, and it is certain that he must have read a vast
amount of literature of all kinds written in several languages. Some of
the sayings of the Greek, Persian, Indian, and Arabian sages he probably
took from some work like that of Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn Miskavaih (died
A.H. 421 = A.D. 1030), who collected a number of precepts of the ancient
sages of Persia, India, Arabia, and Greece<span class="margnote">The
sources of the "Laughable Stories".</span>, which were translated into
Persian by Taḳî Shushtarî <span id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md), and it
seems that he supplemented these from notes made during the course of
his own studies. It is clear that in some cases he amplified his text,
and that in others he modified and gave a different turn to the original
story. Some of the stories may have existed in more than one form, or
they may have been told in different ways. Thus in No. CCCLXXX

<span id="page_xxiv">p. xxiv</span>

<span class="margnote">Variant forms of the same stories.</span>the
scarabaeus is made to say to its mother, "Whithersoever I go men spit
upon me," and its mother replies "It is because thy beauty and smell are
pleasant." With this may be compared the Arabic proverb, "The beetle is
a beauty in the eyes of its mother." <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md)
Again in No. CCCLXXV we have the story of the ape of the mosque and the
dog, but the turn given to the story therein is quite different from
that of the Arabic version <span id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md). We may
also notice in passing that stories told of one man by one author are
told of some one quite different by Bar-Hebraeus. Thus in No. IV it is
said that Socrates once saw a woman who had hanged herself, and that he
remarked, "Would that all trees bore such fruit as this;" but in
Diogenes Laertius (VI, 2) the saying is attributed to Diogenes the
Cynic, and is thus given:—\#\#\#." <span class="margnote">Method of
editing employed b Bar-Hebraeus.</span>From the fifth Chapter of the
"Laughable Stories" we are able to see the plan upon which Bar-Hebraeus
worked in making his compilation and to form an idea how far he followed
his authorities, and how far he abridged them. In perusing the Chapter
we see at once that he stands on his own ground, and that he is dealing
with a class of literature with which he is familiar at first hand. The
chief source of the stories of the Christian recluses is the Syriac
version of Palladius’

<span id="page_xxv">p. xxv</span>

work, and most of the "Sayings" attributed to them are from the
Apophthegmata which usually follow it in MSS.; of the thirty-eight
stories in the Chapter I have traced twenty-eight to Palladius.<span
class="margnote">Use of the work of Palladius and the Apophthegmata of
the Fathers.</span> It will be seen from the full texts which accompany
stories Nos. CXCVII, CCII, CCIX, how very much Bar-Hebraeus has
condensed his authorities, but there is no doubt that he has in most
cases preserved the pith of the stories in his own abridged versions. It
is surprising, however, that he limited himself to thirty-eight stories,
for the Syriac Palladius and the Apophthegmata form an almost
inexhaustible mine for sayings and stories quite as remarkable as those
which Bar-Hebraeus selected. It is difficult also to understand why the
names of the chief actors in the stories are sometimes omitted. Thus
"the certain man who was righteous according to this world" (No. CLXXVI)
was Arsenius; the brother that "was perfect to such a degree that even
wild animals became his friends and he used to nourish their young" (No.
CC) was Macarius of Alexandria, and so on. Whether it be true or not the
latter story has a pretty continuation in Palladius, for we read there
that, a few days after the holy man had made the hyaena's cubs to see by
spitting on their eyes and praying over them, the mother came into his
cell dragging a goat-skin which she deposited at his feet, evidently
intending it for his use. And the ascetic took it and wore it <span
class="margnote">Stories of the Christian recluses.</span>until he was
an old man. On another occasion when the door of his cell was shut the
hyaena jumped over the wall, bearing a young one in her mouth; Macarius
saw that it too was blind and he treated its eyes, as he had those of
the other cubs, successfully. The day following the mother brought back
to the cell for the

<span id="page_xxvi">p. xxvi</span>

holy man a sheep-skin, which subsequently became the property of the
blessed woman Melania <span id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md). A comparison
of the other stories of the Christian recluses with the Syriac texts
which I have given in the notes to them will shew that when Bar-Hebraeus
found the facts briefly related in terse language he excerpted them
without alteration; but when the opposite was the case he cut down the
text, or paraphrased it, or explained it, or omitted whole passages,
whenever it suited his views or convenience to do so. Moreover, I
suspect that this would be found to be the case with almost every story
in the book, if it were traced to its original form.

<span class="margnote">Superstition of Bar-Hebraeus.</span>Judging from
the group of stories of men whose dreams and divinations have come true
it would seem that Bar-Hebraeus himself was somewhat superstitious, and
that he was not free from many of the notions and beliefs common to the
uneducated folk of his day. We have seen above (p. xiv) that several
months before his death he became convinced that his whole life was to
consist of three parts, each containing twenty years, and that the
length of it was to be represented by the number of years which were to
elapse between two periods when the planets Chronos and Zeus would be in
conjunction in the sign of the Zodiac Aquarius; in other words, he
believed that Chronos and Zeus were his planets and that the length of
his life was in some way connected with their movements.<span
class="margnote">Great antiquity of belief in magic.</span> The
interpretation of omens and dreams was a science in Babylonia and
Assyria thousands of years before the time of Bar-Hebraeus, and there is
no doubt that many popular beliefs belonging to a far older period

<span id="page_xxvii">p. xxvii</span>

existed in his day. Thus in No. DXLVII a simpleton asks an astrologer to
arrange that his son should be born under the sign of Hermes, meaning
that he wishes him to be a scribe; now, the Greeks identified Hermes
with the Babylonian god Nebo, who was the god of learning and the scribe
of the gods, but the idea that a man would become a scribe because he
was born when Nebo or Hermes was "ruling" belonged to a much older time
than that of the Greeks. Stories of the speech of animals, likewise,
have their originals in the literature of Mesopotamia and Egypt, and if
we had records of the earliest peoples of these countries we should
probably find that such originals were derived from writers belonging to
still earlier nations, and that these in turn had borrowed from their
predecessors.
