### The Eleventh Chapter

### STORIES OF THOSE WHOSE DREAMS AND DIVINATIONS HAVE COME TRUE.

CCCLXXXVI\. A certain king saw in his dream that another king who was
his enemy had thrown him upon the ground, and he went up and gathered
together his wise men and repeated to them what he had seen. And one of
the wise men who was more skilful than all the rest said to him, "The
dream and the interpretation thereof are as follows. Thou shalt indeed
fight with that king and thou shalt overcome him, for thou wert upon the
earth, and it was supporting thee and was nigh unto thee, while he was
above thee, and his back was towards the sky which was very far away
from thee."

CCCLXXXVII. A certain king sent an ambassador to another king who was
his enemy, and when he returned the king said to him, "How didst thou
find him?" The ambassador said, "I found him sitting on a step with his
feet in water." And the king said, "In very truth he shall have dominion
over me, and he will make spoil of my wives and daughters, for a step
indicateth dominion, and the feet being in the water indicate commerce
with women."

CCCLXXXVIII. Another king sent a painter secretly unto another king who
was his enemy to paint his portrait and to bring it to him. And when he
had painted

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

it and brought it to him, he took the picture and placed it on the
cushion (*or* pillow) and said to the philosophers who were able to read
characters in faces, "What say ye of the man who hath such features as
these?" And they said to him, "There is no need for us to tell thee
anything about his features, for inasmuch as thou hast placed him on thy
pillow, he will in very truth reign in thy room." And thus it happened.

CCCLXXXIX\. Another king gathered together his troops and went forth to
make war against his adversary, and as they were passing by a certain
village they saw two rams fighting and their owners came and each took
his own ram, and they went away. And a wise man said to the king, "Thou
wilt neither conquer nor be conquered, but even as thou art, so wilt
thou return." And it came to pass that when they had marched for a few
days, a certain report came to the king, and he went back to his own
country.

CCCXC\. A certain man asked a fortune-teller about a relative of his who
had gone to a far country, and of whom for a long time he had heard no
news. And it came to pass that whilst they were in the midst of the
narrative behold a dead man passed by, being carried on his way to be
buried; and his hand was upon his breast. And the fortune-teller said,
"He about whom thou askest is dead," whereupon his disciple said to him,
"He is not dead, for the dead man who hath his hand on his breast
indicateth that it is the dead man himself who is dead and not any one
else." And after some time he that had gone away returned.

CCCXCI\. They say that in a certain village a troop of devils appeared
in the form of men, and they said

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

to the villagers, "Behold, a camel hath strayed away from us give us a
man that he may search for him." And when they brought out a man to them
to look for the camel, he saw ravens flying about, and he made his
escape, and went into the village and said, "In very truth, these are
devils and not men; furthermore they have lost no camel." And it came to
pass at these words that these men vanished, and they never appeared
again.

CCCXCII\. A certain ruler had a diviner whose words he wished to prove
false. And it came to pass on a certain day that the sheep which he
possessed strayed into the wilderness; and he told his diviner to make
divination concerning them; and he also commanded his servant, saying,
"Whilst I am speaking with the diviner, do thou emit a croak like that
of a raven on the roof." Now when the diviner heard the croak, he said,
"In very truth highway robbers have stolen the sheep." Thereupon the
governor laughed and said, "Thou hast made a mistake, for it was not a
raven which croaked, but my servant." The diviner answered, "Now
therefore, if it was thy servant who croaked and not a raven, in very
truth the shepherd is slain and the flocks are carried off." And when
they went to enquire they found that the matter was thus.

CCCXCIII\. A certain king said unto a man who used divination on the
Sabbath day, "Look \[and tell me\] if my kingdom shall endure for my son
after me, or not;" and he took him by his hand and squeezed it. And the
diviner made answer to him, saying, "Thy son will demand overmuch from
the people, and his kingdom shall come to an end, for the pressure of my
hand by thee indicateth the oppressive demand for money

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

from the people \[by thy son\], and, moreover, the Sabbath day whereon
thou hast asked the question is a day of cessation from labour according
to the old Law."

CCCXCIV\. A certain Arab related that once when he was mounted on a
camel and was travelling in the desert, he became thirsty, and he took
out a water-skin wherefrom to drink; and as he did so a raven croaked in
his face, and the water was scattered about in the dust. And being very
angry he drew his sword and slit up the skin bottle, and behold, there
fell from it a large viper which had made its way therein for the sake
of the water, and which had escaped the notice of him that filled the
skin. And it came to pass that when the man had travelled a little
further he saw the raven alight in the middle of the way, and when he
cried out to him he stood up upon a rock, and swooped down upon a large
purse full of gold that had been dropped by some merchants.

CCCXCV\. Another magician went to a certain king, and said to him, "I
saw in my dream a man who said to me, Go and announce to the king that
he shall live another eighty years, and behold this shall be a sign unto
him:—Behold, he shall see in a dream as if eighty rings \[set with\]
hyacinthine stones were given to him." And when the king heard these
words he marvelled and said, "Verily I have seen even as thou hast
said;" and he gave him a thousand *dînârs* <span
id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_89.md).

CCCXCVI\. Another magician who had at home a wife whose name was Zahrâh
was once travelling alone in the desert. And having gotten concerning
her a suspicion of wrong he began to mutter to himself—

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

just as a man hummeth a tune to himself in the night—several times,
"Hath Zahrâh any who committeth adultery with her?" And when by these
means his mind had become wholly occupied with the matter, he heard a
voice from the desert, saying, "Yes, Nathrêh sleepeth with her." And it
came to pass that when he returned to his house, his neighbours . came
and went into the house to see him. And when they had all departed there
remained with him one who prolonged, his converse, and when he also had
gone out the magician said to his wife, "Who is this man and what is his
name?" His wife replied, "This is Nathrêh who of all the neighbours is
most beloved by our children, and he is exceedingly affectionate to
them." Her husband said unto her, "Yea, O woman, out of the desert we
have received an account of this man and of his name."

CCCXCVII\. A certain man dreamed in his dream that he was frying dung,
and he came to an interpreter of dreams that he might explain it for
him. And the interpreter said to him, "Give me a *zûzâ*, and I will
interpret it for thee;" and the man replied, "If I had a *zûzâ* I would
buy fish with it and fry them, and I would not fry dung."

CCCXCVIII\. Another interpreter of dreams having gone from Taghrîth
(Tekrît) <span id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90) to Bâbêl (Babylon.md) it was
said to him, "In Tekrît there are many interpreters of dreams, but here
we have none; why hast thou left thy native place?" And he replied, "The
people of Tekrît will not allow even the gnats to sleep, therefore

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

they do not have many dreams; consequently there is no work for us."

CCCXCIX\. Another magician saw a certain dead <span
id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_91.md) thief in a dream, and he said to him,
"What hath God done to thee?" He replied, "For every man whom I have
killed He hath slain me ten times." But when on another night the
magician saw the same dream again, and asked him the same question
again, the thief replied to him, "How often wilt thou weary me, O son of
a whore? I know that I answered thy question once."

CCCC\. Another magician said, "It is absolutely necessary for a man to
resemble his father, either in his head, or in his voice, or in his
gait."

CCCCI\. Another magician saw a certain comic actor, who had been long
dead <span id="fr_92"></span>[2](#fn_92.md), in a dream, and he said, "What
hath God done to thee?" The actor replied to him, saying, "O fool, what
dost thou imagine hath done to me? Thinkest thou that He hath a daughter
to whom He hath married me? He hath done unto me that which He doeth
unto all men who die."

CCCCII\. The wife of a certain man saw in her dream as if a man was
saying to her, "Wouldst thou rather "have ten ordinary children, or
three which should be as ten?" And having made no answer to him she
awoke and related the dream to her husband, who said unto her, "If thou
seest again him that spake unto "thee, thou shalt say unto him, Nay, but
I would rather "have three children who should be as ten." And it came
to pass on the following night, when the woman

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

was asleep, that she saw again him that had asked her the question, and
she said that which her husband had instructed her to say. And after
some time she gave birth to three sons, one after the other, and the
three of them became captains of thousands and men famous in the world.

CCCCIII\. A certain man had a virgin daughter who was skilled in
divination, and a man who had lost a horse went to her that she might
divine for him \[where he was\]; and when she had divined, she looked in
the face of the man, and blushed, and became shamefaced, and covered her
face, and she was unable to speak to the man. And when her father saw
her, he said to the man, "My daughter hath divined, and she hath shewn
that thou wilt find thy horse; let her then become thy wife and take her
to thy house, because she is so shamefaced in thy presence." And it came
to pass that when the man had gone forth and searched for his horse he
found it, and he was hot with love for the young woman, and he sent for
her, and married her.

CCCCIV\. As two merchants were going about in a certain city to amuse
themselves they saw a certain woman sitting in the market with her hair
dishevelled, and many people were gathered together about her. And one
of the two merchants began to laugh and to make a mock of the woman,
whereupon she lifted up her head and said, "Mark, now, O thou man, who
laughest, and believe \[what I say\]; thou shalt not go forth from this
city until thou art dead; and this man, thy friend who is with thee,
shall take to wife the handmaiden that thou lovest as thine own soul."
And it came to pass that after a few days he in truth

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

sickened and died, and the other man took the handmaiden.

CCCCV\. A certain man came to an interpreter of dreams, carrying a sack
on his shoulder, and he said, "I saw in my dream as if I were tying up
with cords the necks of skin-bags with great violence." And the
interpreter of dreams said to him, "Hast thou in very truth seen this
dream?" And the man said, "Yea, indeed, I have seen it." Then the
interpreter of dreams said to the people who were round about him, "This
is the man who stealeth children and strangleth them, and strippeth
their clothes from off them; and if ye search his sack ye will find the
cords for strangling \[them\]." And when they had searched it, they
found that the matter was so, and they took the man and they delivered
him to the judge, and they crucified him.

CCCCVI\. Another man drew nigh to an interpreter of dreams and said, "I
saw in my dream as if I had upon my knees a child, and he was uttering
cries. The interpreter of dreams saith to him, Dost thou play upon the
harp? \[for if thou dost\], do not occupy thyself therewith again."

CCCCVII\. Dixit alius quidam somniorum interpreti, "Dormienti mihi duo
panes in manibus visi sunt quorum de utroque sumebam." Responsum est "Tu
quidem cum duabus unâ matre natis coire soles."

CCCCVIII\. Dixit mercator quidam somniorum interpreti, "Dormienti mihi
canis rufus commensalis epulari visus est." Responsum est, "Scythicum
servum habes qui uxori tuae haud secus quam tu, inire solet." Quod, rem
percontatus, verum esse intellexit.

CCCCIX\. Dixit alius quidam somniorum interpreti,

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Dormiens favum
edere ad focum visus sum et postea mel quod e favo effluxerat." Cui
responsum est, "Deorum igitur iram pertimesce et coire desine cum istâ
quae te lactavit."

CCCCX\. A certain woman said to one of the wise men, "I saw in my dream
that a black cat went into my husband's belly, and that it brought forth
something therefrom which it ate." He said to her, "If thy dream be
really thus, in the coming night a certain black thief will break into
thy husband's shop and will steal therefrom a hundred and fifteen
*zûzê* <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93.md)." And when that day was
passed and the night had come, the man's shop was broken into, and that
exact sum of money was found to have been stolen. And when the man who
heated the bath had captured the black man and beaten him, he confessed
that it was he who had broken into the shop. And when the people asked
the interpreter of dreams, saying, "How couldst thou \[find\] out these
things by divination?" he said, "The interpretation of cat is a thief,
and the blackness thereof was an indication of the colour of the thief;
the belly indicated a storehouse, and the number of the *zûzê* was
indicated by the numerical values of the letters which form the word
'cat' <span id="fr_94"></span>[2](#fn_94.md)."

CCCCXI\. Dixit alius quidam somniorum interpreti, "Dormienti mihi vestes
sanguine perfundi visi sunt quem cum in puteal expresseram, iterum
perfundebantur." Cui responsum est, "Nefasto cum quadam coitu diu
fruitus es at nondum tui poenituit."

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

CCCCXII\. A certain man's wife saw in a dream a dead woman, and she
asked her, saying, "My daughter, what deed is most beloved by God?" And
she replied, "He that distributeth nuts to the poor." Now when she
repeated this to the interpreter he said to her, "Thou hast hidden
treasure laid up under the ground, go and distribute it among the poor
and needy, for nuts are symbolic of treasure, both by the similarity of
their name <span id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95.md) and also by the
similarity of action, for when a man draweth nigh to a nut it is noised
abroad and cannot be hidden; even so also is it with treasure."
