<p>What then are the racial affinities of that singular people which for the last nine hundred years has grouped itself with marvelous cohesion, solidarity and consciousness of kind, around the divine person of a whimsical Caliph? Or, to reduce our question to its lowest denomination, what were the racial connections of that little community at the foot of Mt. Hermon, in W&#257;di-al-Taym, which in 407 A.H.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>/1016 A.D. responded to the mission of Darazi and consequently assumed his name?</p>  
<p><i>The Persian Nucleus at W&#257;di-al-Taym:</i>&#151;It is safe for us to make two postulates at the very outset. First, the people who later became known as the "Druzes" must have formed a more or less socially homogeneous community prior to the advent of Darazi. Second, that homogeneous community must have had in it something which predisposed it for the favorable reception of the seemingly strange and peculiar doctrines proclaimed by Darazi, and, having accepted them, to cherish and perpetuate those doctrines. Something in the social and intellectual make-up of that primitive community at W&#257;di-al-Taym must have made it respond whole-heartedly to Druzism and proved a fertile soil for the germination of its dogmas.</p>  
<p>The trustworthy Egyptian historian, ibn-Taghri-Birdi (&#134; 1469 A.D.), who is the first authority to give us any explanation as to why al-&#7716;ak&#299;m chose, of all places, W&#257;di-al-Taym as the scene for his Syrian propaganda, gives that explanation, which he, of course, draws from earlier documents, in the following words:</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_19"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 19</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> "And al-&#7716;ak&#299;m said to Darazi, 'Proceed into Syria and spread the cause in the mountains because their people are quick to follow.'"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_50"></A><A HREF="#fn_50"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> This reason may sound strange considering the rightly reputed conservative character of mountaineers, but at least it makes it clear that Darazi proceeded to W&#257;di-al-Taym according to preconceived plans and he made its population his first objective. And since his new doctrine was at the core an incarnational one of the extreme Sh&#299;&#145;ite type which had been previously developed in &#145;Ir&#257;q and Persia, it is logical to assume that the natives of W&#257;di-al-Taym must have been subjected to &#145;Ir&#257;qizing or Persianizing influence before.</p>  
<p><i>The Founders of Druzism All Persian:</i>&#151;It should also be remembered in this connection that Darazi himself was of Turco-Persian origin.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> His sect was the Ism&#257;&#145;&#299;liyyah.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> His theological philosophy was B&#257;&#7789;iniyyah (Innerite), i.e., the system of giving an esoteric, inner meaning to the scriptures other than the apparent, literal one. &#7716;amzah, the teacher of Darazi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and the brains of the whole movement, especially after Darazi had fallen into disrepute, was of undoubted Persian origin.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Besides, the whole</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> F&#257;&#7789;imite dynasty, whose claim of legitimacy of descent from &#145;Ali and F&#257;&#7789;imah has been either suspected or vehemently denied by many judicious Moslem historians, was probably founded by, and descended from, a Persian adventurous ancestor who exploited a &#145;Alid tradition and a &#145;Alid fetish for his own personal interest and for the aggrandizement of his progeny.</p>  
<p><i>The Testimony of Religious Vocabulary:</i>&#151;If we, furthermore, investigate the technical terms current in the Druze religious vocabulary, we find many of them, including the word for God, <i>al-B&#257;r</i> (from Barkhoda),&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_55"></A><A HREF="#fn_55"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of clear Persian origin.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_56"></A><A HREF="#fn_56"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> It is significant that the Druze password as taught in their catechism, formulated after the time of &#7716;amzah and al-Muqtana and patterned after the Christian system of questions and answers, consists in the proper answer to the catch question, "Do they plant the seeds of <i>hal&#257;l&#299;j</i> [or <i>ihlil&#299;j</i>, from Persian <i>hal&#299;lah</i> = <i>myrobalan citrina</i>] in your country?"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_57"></A><A HREF="#fn_57"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> If the man is a Druze his answer would be, "Yes, they are planted in the hearts of the believers."</p>  
<p><i>Names of Feudal Families:</i>&#151;A study, therefore, of the Druze dogmas, their religious vocabulary and the nationality of the missionaries would suggest &#145;Ir&#257;qi and Persian beginnings for the Druze people. This conclusion regarding the Persian racial origins of the Druzes which we have reached is in contradiction to almost all other conclusions reached by travelers and historians.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_58"></A><A HREF="#fn_58"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> It is</p>

<p><A NAME="page_21"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 21</FONT></A></p>  
<p>further corroborated by an investigation of the genealogies of the chief feudal families which we shall now consider.</p>  
<p>The leading families among the Druzes have been throughout their history either of full Kurdish and Persian origin or of Persianized and &#145;Ir&#257;qized Arab origin. That is, they have been either Kurdish and Persian families or tribes from the Arabian peninsula who, before their advent into the Lebanon, sojourned for many generations in Mesopotamia where they became fully indoctrinated with the &#145;Alid ideas and subjected to Gnostic and Manichaean influences.</p>  
<p>W&#257;di-al-Taym, the place where the Druzes first appear in history under that name,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_59"></A><A HREF="#fn_59"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is so called after an Arab tribe Taym-All&#257;h (formerly Taym-All&#257;t) which, according to the greatest Arab historian, al-&#7788;abari,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_60"></A><A HREF="#fn_60"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> first came from Arabia into the valley of the Euphrates where they were Christianized prior to their migration into the Lebanon. Many of the Druze feudal families whose genealogies have been preserved to us by the two modern Syrian chroniclers: al-Am&#299;r &#7716;aydar and al-Shidy&#257;q, seem also to point in the direction of the same origin&#151;Arabian tribes which emigrated via the Persian Gulf and stopped in &#145;Ir&#257;q on the route that was later to lead them to Syria. The first feudal Druze family, the banu-Tan&#363;kh, which made for itself a name in fighting the Crusaders under authorization from the Sultan N&#363;r-al-D&#299;n of Damascus, was according to &#7716;aydar,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_61"></A><A HREF="#fn_61"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> an Arab tribe from al-&#7716;&#299;rah (Mesopotamia) where it occupied the position of a ruling family and was apparently christianized. The Tan&#363;khs must have left Arabia as early as the second or third century A.D. The Ma&#145;n tribe which superseded the Tan&#363;khs and produced the greatest Druze hero in history, Fakhr-al-D&#299;n, had the same traditional origin,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_62"></A><A HREF="#fn_62"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> although Fakhr-al-D&#299;n himself is quoted, on the authority</p>

<p>of a grandson of his, as saying that the Ma&#145;ns were Kurds.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_63"></A><A HREF="#fn_63"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> The banu-Ta&#7735;h&#363;q&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_64"></A><A HREF="#fn_64"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and &#145;Abd-al-Malik&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_65"></A><A HREF="#fn_65"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> who supplied the later Druze leadership have the same record as the Tan&#363;khs. The banu-&#145;Im&#257;d are so-called from al &#145;Im&#257;diyyah,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_66"></A><A HREF="#fn_66"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> near al-Maw&#7779;il, and, like the Junbl&#257;&#7789;s,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_67"></A><A HREF="#fn_67"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> are of Kurdish origin. The Arisl&#257;ns claim descent from the &#7716;&#299;rah Arab kings, but the name (<i>Arslan</i> = lion) suggests Persian influence if not origin. It was in conformity with the principle of racial dissimulation (<i>taqiyyah</i>) that many Druze families of Kurdish and Persian origins claimed Arab descent.</p>  
<p>It is interesting to note that most of these Druze Arab tribes trace their origin to southern Arabia, and not to the &#7716;ij&#257;z tribes which flooded western Asia at the time of the Moslem conquests. This would imply an earlier migration into &#145;Ir&#257;q than the rise of Islam, and a sojourn of many generations in a sphere of Persian influence.</p>  
<p><i>Persian Tribes Transplanted into Syria:</i>&#151;That the Indo-Iranian elements in the blood of the historic Druzes are varied and multiplied can be safely assumed, not only on the ground of probable beginning and intermarriages in their earlier home, Mesopotamia, but on the ground of possible admixture in Syria itself where many Persians had been domiciled prior to the rise of Druzism. Al-Bal&#257;dhuri, the most judicious of the early Arab historians, informs us that Mu&#145;&#257;wiyah (660-680 A.D.), among other Umayyad Caliphs, transplanted on different occasions quite a number of Persian and Mesopotamian tribes into the districts of Ba&#145;labakk, &#7716;im&#7779;, &#7778;&#363;r (Tyre) and elsewhere in order, evidently, to take the place of the Byzantines who had evacuated Syria subsequent to its conquest by the Moslem Arabs.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> In the shuffle to which these</p>
