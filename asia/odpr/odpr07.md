### CHAPTER III

### RACIAL ORIGINS

*Number and Distribution:*—With the present numerical strength of the
Druzes, their geographical distribution in southern Lebanon,
Wādi-al-Taym, al Jabal al-A‘la (between Aleppo and Antioch), Ṣafad and
Mt. Carmel in Palestine, and with their later migrations which
determined their present habitat, we are more or less familiar.
According to the last census there are about 110,000 Druzes in Lebanon
and Syria, and 7,000 in Palestine. The present Druze population of
Ḥawrān (44,344) are, according to well authenticated documents and local
oral tradition, <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md) the descendants of
emigrants from south Lebanon who, in 1711, as a result of the defeat of
their Yemenite party by its Qaysite enemy, left their home, Kafra, <span
id="fr_8"></span>[2](#fn_8.md) and sought a new abode. The number was later
augmented by fresh recruits <span id="fr_9"></span>[3](#fn_9.md) as a
result of the 1860 civil war in the Lebanon. Earlier the Jabal al-Ala
Druzes emigrated thither from the south. <span
id="fr_10"></span>[4](#fn_10.md) Those of Palestine are of undoubted
Lebanese origin, though some of them may have come directly from the
Aleppo region. <span id="fr_11"></span>[5](#fn_11.md) Lebanon therefore was
the distributing center of the Druze people and Wādi-al-Taym was the
birthplace of their religion.

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

It is also easy to trace the ancestry of the modern Druze emigrants in
Europe and America back to Syria and the Lebanon. In the United States
there are about a thousand Druzes, mostly of Lebanese origin, among whom
eighty are women.

The few Druze manuscripts which have thus far fallen into our hands
represent the Fāṭimite Ḥakīm cult as having spread into many lands
outside the confines of Syria, and as having found proselytes throughout
northern Africa, Egypt, Arabia, ‘Irāq, Persia and other parts of the
Near East, into which Ḥamzah had sent missionaries of different grades.
That this was not an altogether idle boast is illustrated by a reference
in al-Dhahabi <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12) († 1345 A.D..md) to the
execution of all those in far-away Khurāsān who believed in the divinity
of al-Ḥakīm. Following the example, legendary or historical, of the
Prophet Muḥammad, al-Muqtana Bahā’-al-Dīn, the right hand of Ḥamzah in
the propagation of the cult, addressed epistles eastward as far as India
and westward as far as Constantinople, including one to Constantine
VIII <span id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md) and one to Emperor Michael the
Paphlagonian. <span id="fr_14"></span>[3](#fn_14.md) But the fact remains
that of those Ḥakīm followers, none has survived except the Druzes of
the Lebanon. <span id="fr_15"></span>[4](#fn_15.md) In Egypt they were
exterminated soon after the appearance of the cult. No matter where the
modern Druze, therefore, may be today, he can rightly trace his origin
back to that mountain land of Lebanon.

*Religious and Racial Boundaries Coterminous:*—This is especially true
in view of the fact that with the death of Bahā’-al-Dīn in 1031 A.D.
"the door of the Unitarian religion was closed"

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

and no one could be admitted into the Druze fold or permitted exit from
it. The Druze religion then ceased to be simply a religion and its
followers became a distinct nation. Bahā’-al-Din resorted to this policy
as a measure of safety. New pretended converts might betray the cause
into the hands of its persecutors. He considered "the day of grace,"
offered to an unworthy world by the divine al-Ḥākim and the transcendent
Ḥamzah, as having passed forever. To a religious body thus reduced to
the defensive and desperately striving to conceal its identity, if not
its very existence, further proselytism became clearly impossible. The
Druze religion thus became wholly hereditary, a sacred privilege, a
priceless treasure to be jealously and zealously guarded against the
profane. This self-centralization which makes its votaries shun all
attempts at increasing their number, coupled with the inviolable secrecy
with which they practice their religion, and the readiness with which
they ever hold themselves to profess any dominant religion that happens
to throw its shadow across their way, has enabled the Druze community to
maintain a stable and homogeneous existence for upward of nine
centuries. In this it may have had no parallel in the religious history
of the world.

*Silence of Historians:*—The first historian to mention the rise and
spread of the Druze religion was Yaḥya ibn-Sa‘īd al-Anṭāki, <span
id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md) a Christian contemporary of Darazi, <span
id="fr_17"></span>[2](#fn_17.md) the founder of the religion. In his
account he was followed by another Christian historian, Jurjus
al-Makīn <span id="fr_18"></span>[3](#fn_18) († 1273 A.D..md). But both
historians are silent on

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

the question of racial origins. Other Arabic sources, written by
Moslems, such as ibn-al-Athīr <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md) (†
1234), abu-al-Fida <span id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20) († 1331.md),
ibn-Taghri-Birdi <span id="fr_21"></span>[3](#fn_21) († 1469.md) and later
Syrian and Egyptian chroniclers like ibn-Khaldūn († 1406), al-Suyūṭi (†
1505), al-Isḥāqi († cir. 1650) are equally silent. To these annalists,
questions of religious, and not racial, grouping were the ones of
paramount and all-absorbing interest.

The Crusading historians of the West and the reports of the pilgrims
likewise throw no light on the subject. To them all non-Christian
peoples of Syria were included under the generic name "*Sarraceni*." The
pilgrims ordinarily took the coastal route and were therefore not likely
to come much in contact with the Druzes. But the Druzes undoubtedly took
part in the struggle against the Crusaders and possibly influenced the
Templars by their organization and teaching. <span
id="fr_22"></span>[4](#fn_22.md)

*Travelers’ and Scholars’ Accounts:*—Travelers and modern writers have
almost exhausted all the list of possible theories in their attempt to
explain the racial beginnings of the Druze people. Some have even
resorted to fantastic and naïve, if not ludicrous, hypotheses.

Benjamin of Tudela, the Jewish traveler who passed through the Lebanon
in or about 1165 was one of the first European writers to refer to the
Druzes by name. The word Druzes, in an early Hebrew edition of his
travels, occurs as "*Dogziyin*," <span id="fr_23"></span>[5](#fn_23.md) but
it is clear that this is a scribal error. According to the
*Encyclopaedia* 

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

*of Islam*, <span id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md) Benjamin also states
that the Druzes were descended from the Ituraeans (an Aramean or Arabian
tribe which Pompey found in Lebanon in 64 B.C.), but I have not been
able to find this statement in any version of Benjamin's Itinerary.

*Criticism of the Arabian Theory:*—Modern travelers like Niebuhr, <span
id="fr_25"></span>[2](#fn_25.md) and scholars like von Oppenheim, <span
id="fr_26"></span>[3](#fn_26.md) undoubtedly echoing the popular Druze
belief regarding their own origin, have classified them as Arabs. The
prevailing idea among the Druzes themselves today is that they are of
Arab stock. This hypothesis conforms to the general local tradition, but
is in contradiction to the results obtained in this study. In his Huxley
Memorial Lecture, "The Early Inhabitants of Western Asia," Professor
Felix von Luschan, the famous anthropologist of the University of
Berlin, states that he measured the skulls of fifty-nine adult male
Druzes and "not one single man fell, as regards his cephalic index,
within the range of the real Arab." <span id="fr_27"></span>[4](#fn_27.md)
Evidently the Druze claim of Arab descent is the result of their
application of the principle of dissimulation (*taqiyyah*) to their
racial problem, they being a small minority amidst an Arab majority
which has always been in the ascendancy. According to this principle,
one is not only ethically justified but is under obligation, when the
exigencies of the case require, to conceal the reality of his religion,
or race, and feign other religious or racial relationships.

The writer remembers hearing Druzes in Lebanon discussing Japanese
victories during the Russo-Japanese War of 1906 and claiming common
origin with the yellow Far Easterners. Miss Bell who was then traveling
in Ḥawrān (Jabal al-Durūz) observed that the "Druzes believe the
Japanese to belong to their own race." <span
id="fr_28"></span>[5](#fn_28.md)

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

*Diverse Hypotheses:*—Lamartine <span id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md)
discovered in the modern Druzes the remnants of the Samaritans; the Earl
of Carnarvon, <span id="fr_30"></span>[2](#fn_30.md) those of the
Cuthites <span id="fr_31"></span>[3](#fn_31.md) whom Esarhaddon
transplanted into Palestine; George Washington Chasseaud, <span
id="fr_32"></span>[4](#fn_32.md) those of the Hivites; and Mrs.
Worsley, <span id="fr_33"></span>[5](#fn_33.md) those of the Hittites.
Drawing his conclusions from anthropometric measurements, Professor
Luschan makes the Druzes, Maronites, and Nuṣayriyyah of Syria—together
with the Armenians, Ṭahtājis, Bektāshis, ‘Ali-Ilāhis and Yezīdis of Asia
Minor and Persia—"with their enormous high and short heads and narrow
and high noses"—the modern representatives of the ancient
Hittites. <span id="fr_34"></span>[6](#fn_34.md) Captain Light describes
them on the authority of Pococke "as the remnant of Israel who fled the
wrath of Moses after the destruction of the molten calf." <span
id="fr_35"></span>[7](#fn_35.md) Canon Parfit, who lived several years
among the Druzes, states in a recent book that they are "the descendants
of Arabs, Persians, Hindoos, Jews and Christians." <span
id="fr_36"></span>[8](#fn_36.md)

*Supposed Relationship with the French and British and with
Freemasonry:*—Deceived by superficial and purely accidental phonetic
resemblances, certain French scholars once accepted the curious
hypothesis, which in the seventeenth century found vogue in Europe, to
the effect that the modern Druzes of the Lebanon are the descendants of
a Latin colony which owed its origin to a comte de Dreux who, subsequent
to the fall of Acre, led his Crusading regiment to the out-of-the-way
hills of Lebanon. The

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

same myth makes the Druze chief Fakhr-al-Dīn a scion of the house of
Lorraine through Godfrey of Bouillon.

This genealogy was apparently fabricated in connection with the visit of
that prince Fakhr-al-Dīn to Italy, after he had made an alliance in 1608
with Ferdinand I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, with a view to arousing a
crusade against Fakhr-al-Dīn's enemy suzerains, the Turks. In 1763 Puget
de Saint-Pierre wrote a book entitled *Histoire des Druses, Peuple du
Liban, formé par une colonie de François* (Paris). Articles appeared in
learned magazines <span id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_37.md) supporting the
idea. More discriminating writers like Volney, <span
id="fr_38"></span>[2](#fn_38.md) Lamartine, <span
id="fr_39"></span>[3](#fn_39.md) Dussaud, <span
id="fr_40"></span>[4](#fn_40.md) were quick to detect the historic
impossibility of the hypothesis. English travelers like Maundrell <span
id="fr_41"></span>[5](#fn_41.md) and Pococke <span
id="fr_42"></span>[6](#fn_42.md) seem to have accepted the theory of Druze
descent from the remains of some Christian army of Crusading origin.

It was evidently in an analogous sphere of ideas that such lodges as
those of "*Druzes Réunis*" and "*Commandeurs du Liban*" were founded in
France. <span id="fr_43"></span>[7](#fn_43.md)

By the same processes of reasoning the Druze name was connected with
those of the Druids, and many Freemason lodges have claimed relationship
with the Druzes whose "ancestors were none other than the original
subjects of King Hiram of Tyre, the builders of Solomon's temple." <span
id="fr_44"></span>[8](#fn_44.md)

The writer remembers more than one occasion on which prominent
contemporaneous Druzes claimed common descent for their people with the
British. That this claim goes back to the

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

early part of the eighteenth century is shown by a reference in
Pococke's *Description*. <span id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_45.md) English
agents in Syria, anxious for a "zone of influence" among the Druzes to
counteract the French zone among the Maronites, may have acquiesced in
the Druze claim to blood relationship with the British.

*Other Theories:*—Some English scholars <span
id="fr_46"></span>[2](#fn_46.md) of the eighteenth century tried to relate
the Druzes to the *Derusaiaioi* mentioned by Herodotus <span
id="fr_47"></span>[3](#fn_47.md) as one of the Median tribes transplanted
by Cyrus. In this as in the preceding cases, there seems to be no
justification for the theory beyond the apparent similarity in names.

More worthy of consideration is the statement of Hogarth and Gertrude
Bell in the Encyclopaedia Britannica <span id="fr_48"></span>[4](#fn_48.md)
that the Druzes are a mixture of stocks in which the Arab largely
predominates "grafted on to an original mountain population of Aramaic
blood." A study, however, of the Arabic colloquial used by the modern
Druzes of Lebanon reveals no such marked Aramaisms as is revealed by a
study of the colloquial of their northern neighbors, the Maronites, who
are of mixed Aramaic stock; and there is nothing in the sources at our
command to justify the inclusion of the Aramaic blood to such an extent
in the Druze veins.
