### CHAPTER V

### DRUZE THEOLOGY AND ITS SOURCES

#### I. THE PROBLEM WITH ITS DIFFICULTIES

*Various Hypotheses:*—As in the case of determining the racial origins
of the Druze people, so in the case of ascertaining the origin of their
religion, all kinds of theories, some curious and amusing, others
fantastic and naïve, have been proposed. By different authors at
different times the Druze religion was thought to be related to ancient
Judaism, Samaritanism and Mandaeism. <span id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_72.md)
Madame Blavatsky, the founder of theosophy, traces, in an early issue of
*The Theosophist*, the Druze religion back to Tibetan Lamaism. <span
id="fr_73"></span>[2](#fn_73.md) Others have declared the whole thing an
"enigma hardly possible to explain." <span id="fr_74"></span>[3](#fn_74.md)

*Period of Concealment:*—The difficulties in the way of reaching a
thorough and scientific appreciation of the Druze religion are due to
the scarcity of outside sources, to the secrecy with which the Druzes
themselves practice their religious rites and mystic ceremonies, to the
carefulness with which they guard their sacred writings against the
profane, to the allegorical and esoteric character of the Arabic style
of the few manuscripts which have fallen into our hands, and to the
legitimate practice of *taqiyyah*, or dissimulation (according to which
a member of this religion is free to profess publicly any other dogma or
creed if therein lies the path of safety)—all these conspire to make the
Druze riddle

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

one of the most baffling in the history of religious thought. <span
id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75.md) According to Druze teaching, they are now,
pending the "absence" of al-Ḥakīm, in a "period of concealment" (*zamān
al-sitr*) and nothing of their religion should be divulged or
promulgated.

*Manuscripts:*—Almost the only sources, therefore, consist o the
manuscripts of a hundred or so texts, many of which are didactic and
polemic treatises, which as a result of local disturbances in the Druze
region, particularly the invasion of Ibrāhīm Pasha, 1831-1838, and the
civil war of 1860, found their way into the hands of scholars. One of
the first manuscripts to be carried into Europe was presented in 1700 to
Louis XIV by a Syrian physician, and is now deposited in the
Bibliothèque Nationale. Most of these manuscripts are written in a
language which from the standpoint of diction, grammar and style is
quite far from the language of the Koran and bristles with contradictory
and obscure passages, cryptic phrases, and ambiguous words. The present
study is based on twenty or more original manuscripts, many of which are
in the Robert Garrett collection at Princeton University.

*The Historical Setting:*—Viewed as a distinct religious phenomenon, as
an independent sphere of thought detached from its historical setting
and background, Druzism does present somewhat of an enigma; but
considered as an outgrowth of the Ismā‘īliyyah sect, which itself
belonged to the ultra group of the Shī‘ah heterodoxies of Islam, and
properly envisaged in the Moslem *milieu* out of which it arose and in
which it developed, the Druze religion yields to analytical treatment
and becomes comparatively easy of explanation.

Silvestre de Sacy, the father of Arabic scholarship in Europe, whose
monumental work *Exposé de la religion des Druzes* (2 vols., Paris,
1838) has not yet been superseded though it appeared some

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

ninety years ago and before many original sources were brought to light,
gives us an excellent internal interpretation of the Druze religion but
does not go far in disentangling the different fibers in the intricate
and complex web of the system and in tracing them back to the remote
origins in the various religions or philosophical and metaphysical
schools of thought. And whereas many eminent scholars in recent times,
chief among whom stands the late Ignacz Goldziher of the University of
Budapest, have addressed themselves to the task of analyzing the
component elements that entered into the composition of Sunni (orthodox)
and Shī‘ite Islam, the Druze sect still remains without an interpreter
in the field of the history of religion.

#### II. THE HĀKIM-GOD

*Whimsical Character of al-Ḥakīm:*—The basic and distinctive dogma of
Druze theology is the deification of the young Fāṭimite Caliph
(996-1020).

Sunni Moslem historians, such as al-Dhahabi, ibn-al-Athīr, abu-al-Fida,
ibn-al-Qalānisi, <span id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_76.md) al-Rūdhrāwari <span
id="fr_77"></span>[2](#fn_77.md) and ibn-Khallikān, <span
id="fr_78"></span>[3](#fn_78.md) remembering him as the heretic who
abolished the five pillars of Islam and ordered the names of the early
Caliphs associated with a curse in the public prayer, have portrayed him
in terms of a medieval Nero, tyrannical and unbalanced to the point of
mental derangement. The Christian historians, such as Yaḥya
ibn-Sa‘īd, <span id="fr_79"></span>[4](#fn_79.md) al-Makīn <span
id="fr_80"></span>[5](#fn_80.md) and Bar-Hebraeus, <span
id="fr_81"></span>[6](#fn_81.md) associating his memory with the
destruction of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem "leaving not one stone
upon another" <span id="fr_82"></span>[7](#fn_82.md) and the revival of the
old regulations,

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

first enacted by the ‘Abbāsid al-Mutawakkil, which made it incumbent
upon all Christians to wear distinctively colored clothes with heavy
wooden crosses dangling from their necks, were equally merciless in his
condemnation. Through Gibbon, <span id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_83.md) who
paints quite a dark picture of al-Ḥakīm, the English-speaking world has
become acquainted with him as a bizarre and whimsical character. What we
have from the pen of these writers is not a portrait but a caricature.

The Druze writers, while not denying some of his excesses, interpret
them allegorically and symbolically. <span id="fr_84"></span>[2](#fn_84.md)
His freakishness only serves to intensify the belief in his superhuman
character. His extraordinary conduct proves his divine nature.

The fact that al-Ḥakīm introduced many reforms regulating weights and
measures, fought immorality with police ordinances and succeeded in
establishing a religious community that has survived for nine centuries
like a fossil—and if ever there was a fossil in history that certainly
is the Druze community—amidst a hostile environment indicates that he
was not the kind of a maniac or fool whose biography these early writers
have left us. (See Appendix B.)

*His Deification:*—Strange as the apotheosis of al-Ḥakīm may
seem—especially in view of the black picture left us by his
biographies—yet the idea itself was not a novel one in Islam. Prior to
the rise of Druzism, different Shī‘ah sects have held different shades
of the belief that ‘Ali and his successor *Imāms* were infallible
supernatural beings endowed to some degree with the divine essence. The
Ismā‘īliyyah sect, from whose bosom Druzism sprang as did also the
Assassins of Crusading fame, together with al-Qarāmiṭah, which between
the ninth and twelfth centuries swept through Western Asia, had both
venerated certain descendants of ‘Ali and hailed them as infallible
rulers of the world.

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

The step from that position to an incarnational philosophy of theism is
not, indeed, a long one; and a few of the extremist (Ghulāt) Shī‘ah
sects had taken it. In the polemic literature of Islam, and particularly
in the works of al-Baghdādi <span id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_85.md) († 1037
A.D.), ibn-Ḥazm <span id="fr_86"></span>[2](#fn_86) († 1063.md) and
al-Shahrastāni <span id="fr_87"></span>[3](#fn_87) († 1153.md), we have
preserved for us among the semi-religious, semi-philosophical sects of
unorthodox Islam the names of many groups with incarnational theories
which may be considered the prototypes of the Druze al-Ḥakīm cult. First
among these was al-Saba’iyyah, so called after a Jew who declared ‘Ali
god. Al-Baghdādi <span id="fr_88"></span>[4](#fn_88.md) devotes a chapter
to the incarnational sects (al-Ḥulūliyyah) and enumerates ten different
ones.

The Nuṣayriyyah, who preceded the Druzes and had early contacts with
them, as attested by the Druze manuscripts, <span
id="fr_89"></span>[5](#fn_89.md) and who are represented until the present
day by three villages <span id="fr_90"></span>[6](#fn_90.md) in the Druze
district at Wādi-al-Taym, deify ‘Ali. <span
id="fr_91"></span>[7](#fn_91.md) ‘Ali-God adherents are also to be found
today in a sect of Turcoman peasants at Qars (Ardaghān) whose very name
"‘Ali-Ilāhi" <span id="fr_92"></span>[8](#fn_92.md) betrays their
characteristic belief.

Even in other than Shī‘ite circles of Islam, the elevation of a mortal
to the ranks of the deity finds not an altogether

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

uncommon expression. The case of the Safi al-Ḥallāj, <span
id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93.md) who was crucified in Baghdād in 922 A.D.
because he identified himself with God, and his fellow self-deified
Ṣūfi, al-Shalmaghāni, <span id="fr_94"></span>[2](#fn_94.md) who was
beheaded also in Baghdād in 934 A.D., may be cited as illustrations.

*Al-Ḥākim as the Messiah:*—Having determined the antecedents of the
Druze incarnational dogma in the preceding Islamic thought, our next
task is to push back our query into the intellectual ancestry of that
Islamic idea in the pre-Islamic realm of thinking. The influence of the
Christian incarnation precedent must have been too widespread and too
apparent to have escaped the attention of the early Moslem thinkers. The
great ibn-Khaldūn and before him al-Shahrastāni <span
id="fr_95"></span>[3](#fn_95.md) blame the incarnational Moslem heresy on
Judaeo-Christian sects. Among modern Western scholars, de Sacy, <span
id="fr_96"></span>[4](#fn_96.md) van Vloten <span
id="fr_97"></span>[5](#fn_97.md) and Goldziher <span
id="fr_98"></span>[6](#fn_98.md) have laid great stress on the Messianic
tendencies in early Islam as the main source of Shī‘ism. In the case of
the Druzes, Ḥamzah, of course, with an eye upon the Copts of Egypt and
other Christians, goes so far as to declare al-Ḥakīm "the
Messiah." <span id="fr_99"></span>[7](#fn_99.md)

His argument in defense of deification is clever:—"If ye Christians and
Jews believe that God spoke to Moses through a dry tree and, on another
occasion, through a mountain . . ., is it not then meet to believe that
our Lord \[al-Ḥakīm\] is a more worthy means through whom God manifests
to the world his power and behind whom he conceals himself?" <span
id="fr_100"></span>[8](#fn_100.md)

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

In the Druze catechism, al-Ḥakīm is repeatedly identified with "the
living Messiah." <span id="fr_101"></span>[1](#fn_101.md) Likewise
Bahā’-al-Dīn, in his turn, identifies Ḥamzah with the Messiah. <span
id="fr_102"></span>[2](#fn_102.md) In his many epistles directed to the
Christians, Bahā’-al-Dīn often calls the Christians "saints" and
"assemblies of saints." (See Appendix D.)

*A Series of Divine Incarnations:*—The guiding thought of Druze
theogony, as it was with the Ismā‘īliyyah, is the belief in a succession
of divine manifestations through a progressive series. Hence with the
Druzes, al-Ḥakīm is not only the incarnation of God but the final and
most perfect manifestation, having been preceded by nine others among
whom figure al-Bār (Barkhoda), ‘Ali and the ancestors of al-Ḥakīm in the
Fāṭimite Caliphate.

According to a further development of this idea, the divine humanity of
God, though it appears under different names in different countries and
times, is essentially one and always the same in its diverse
manifestations. The human figure serves only as a veil to hide the
divine essence behind.

In contrast to the Druze ten successive incarnations, the Nuṣayriyyah
believe in seven only, corresponding to the seven heavens and the seven
planets. <span id="fr_103"></span>[3](#fn_103.md)

To this same sphere of thought should be consigned the recent Bahā’i
theory of divine manifestations which is an outgrowth of Bābi and
Sheikhite ideas which in turn flourished in the fertile Shī‘ah soil of
Persia. And as in modern Bahā‘ism so in ancient Druzism, resort is had
to Pythagorean subtleties and to the occult art of manipulating letters
and combinations of letters assigning cabalistic numerical values <span
id="fr_104"></span>[4](#fn_104.md) to them in order to

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

determine the periods that elapsed between one manifestation and the
other.

*The Disappearance and Triumphal Return of al-Ḥākim:*—Closely allied to
the incarnational theory, and working out as a corollary from it, was
the belief in the immortal character of the *Imām* in whose case
"disappearance" (*ghaybah*) takes the place of death and whose final
"return" (*raj‘ah*) is expected so that he may lead his people in
triumph to a new and happy age. When, therefore, al-Ḥakīm, on that
fateful day in 1020 A.D., went on his usual promenade to the Muqaṭṭam
hill just outside of the city of Cairo never to return—probably because
he fell a victim to a plot prearranged by his sister Sitt-al-Mulk <span
id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_105.md)—his "admirers refused to believe in his
death and began to expect his return." <span
id="fr_106"></span>[2](#fn_106.md) They still hold that he is in a state of
temporary occultation. History has preserved for us the names of few who
on different occasions tried to impersonate the returned al-Ḥakīm. In
his dramatic work entitled "The Return of the Druzes," Browning tells
the story of one of these impostors.

This "hidden *Imām*" idea was carefully worked out by many of the
extreme Shī‘ah sects prior to Druzism, and reached its most elaborate
expression as a doctrine in the Ismā‘īliyyah group. Its psychological
basis should surely be sought in the strong but unfulfilled desires and
hopes of a persecuted and depressed people (as the Shī‘ah were under the
Umayyads and ‘Abbāsids) with the supreme ambition for a saviour-leader
whose coming shall usher in for them a new era of liberty and
prosperity.

This Moslem Mahdi idea was subjected to Semitic Judaeo-Christian
Messianic influences on the one hand, and, in its later development, to
Iranian-Mandaean influences. The case of the prophet Elijah, called
throughout the Christian East "the Living One" (*al-Ḥay*), was a
prototype of the ever-living *Imām*. The stories of the assumption of
Moses and the ascension of Isaiah in the non-canonical literature of the
Bible might have served

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

as stimuli. The expression of the "hidden *Imām*" Shī‘ite doctrine <span
id="fr_107"></span>[1](#fn_107.md) was a reflex of Isaiah, chapter XI. The
second advent of Christ was paralleled by the "return" of the Mahdi
bringing politico-religious restoration. <span
id="fr_108"></span>[2](#fn_108.md)

*Indo-Iranian Influences:*—The problem of disentangling and sorting the
different elements—labelling each Judaeo-Christian, Hellenistic or
Zoroastrian—which went into the make-up of the historic Shī‘ah schisms
is one bristling with difficulties and uncertainties. How much did
Shī‘ah owe to western Neo-Platonic philosophies on the one hand, and how
much to eastern Persian and Indian systems of thought on the other, is
not always easy to ascertain at the present stage of research.

Modern European Semitic scholars, led by Ignacz Goldziher, have,
however, been inclined to underrate the eastern influence. Certain
French Persian scholars, on the other hand, such as E. Blochet and Baron
Carra de Vaux <span id="fr_109"></span>[3](#fn_109.md) have tried to
attribute to Persianizing influences a great many of the cardinal Shī‘ah
beliefs. The former scholar traces the origin of the incarnational and
Mahdi idea to Zoroastrian sources, Barham Amavand being the Iranian
Messiah. <span id="fr_110"></span>[4](#fn_110.md)

Further investigation will probably reveal that the Indo-Iranian
influence on the rise and the development of the Shī‘ah sects was
greater than we now realize. That such influence was clearly recognized
by early Moslem scholars is evinced by the fact that al-Baghdādi, <span
id="fr_111"></span>[5](#fn_111.md) for instance, goes so far as to exclude
the Bāṭiniyyah, including the Qarāmiṭah and Ismā‘īliyyah, from the list
of Moslem sects and to classify them under *Majūs* (Magians), *i.e.*,
Zoroastrians. A tradition (*ḥadīth*) puts in the mouth of the Prophet
himself the following words: "The Qadarites are the Magians of my
people." <span id="fr_112"></span>[6](#fn_112.md) Besides, there is no
gainsaying the fact

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

that Shī‘ah sprang up on Persian ‘Irāqi soil, that its chief
protagonists have been mostly Persian, and that until the present day it
constitutes the state religion of the kingdom of Persia.

In its further development the "return" doctrine (parousia) gave rise to
interesting eschatological ideas to which unbridled human fancies
contributed their fantastic share. According to Druze doctrine the
"return" of al-Ḥakīm will result in the triumph of the Unitarian
religion and the worldly reward of its adherents, who will thus become
high office-holders, to the discomfiture and affliction of all infidels
and apostates who are then metamorphosed into menial servants, swine and
dogs. <span id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_113.md) This corresponds in general
to the resurrection day.

*Unitarians:*—The Druze conception of the deity is declared by them to
be one of strict and uncompromising unity. In their desire to maintain a
rigid confession of unity they stripped from God all attributes
(*tanzīh*) which may savor of, or lead into, polytheism (*shirk*). In
Allah there are no attributes distinct from his essence. He is wise,
mighty, just, &c., not by wisdom, might, justice, &c., but by his own
essence. There is neither "how," "when" nor "where" about him: he is
incomprehensible.

In this dogma, as in the others, the Druzes were no originators. They
had for precedent that interesting semi-philosophical, semi-religious
body which flourished under al-Ma’mūn and was known by the name of
al-Mu‘tazilah <span id="fr_114"></span>[2](#fn_114.md) and the equally
interesting fraternal order of the "Brethren of Purity" (*Ikhwān
al-Ṣafa*).

The Druze favorite name for themselves is *Muwaḥḥidūn* <span
id="fr_115"></span>[3](#fn_115.md)—Unitarians—believers in one and only one
God. In this they

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

follow the precedent of the Mu‘tazilah who insisted on calling
themselves "The People of Justice and Unity" (*Ahl al-‘Adl
w-al-Tawḥīd*).

#### III. FIVE DIVINE MINISTERS AND THREE INFERIOR ONES

*The Process of Emanation:*—Having accepted the Allah of the Mu‘tazilah
and "Brethren of Purity," already reduced to a flimsy abstraction, the
Druze mind could not rest until it had personified God's mind, will,
word, &c., and made separate beings out of each of them, constituting
the five supreme ministers (*Ḥudūd*, literally, bounds or precepts).

The first one whom the primeval God created, and that by a process of
emanation from himself, <span id="fr_116"></span>[1](#fn_116.md) was the
"Universal Mind," Ḥamzah himself, the real founder of the Druze religion
and its supreme pontiff who thus becomes the ruler of the universe. Even
on the day of judgment he promotes and demotes whomsoever he pleases, a
sort of proxy or demiurge for the divine Ḥākim. In the meantime an
"Opposer" (*Ḍudd*) <span id="fr_117"></span>[2](#fn_117.md) is created by
the same process of emanation, a kind of antagonist to the "Universal
Mind," whose object it is to nullify the work of the Mind. This makes it
necessary for God to create, by emanation from the "Universal Mind," a
second minister—the "Universal Soul." This "Universal Soul" is in the
position of a wife to the "Universal Mind," and from it emanates the
"Word." By similar processes the "Right Wing" or "Precedent" and the
"Left Wing" or "Follower" are brought into existence, the "Left Wing"
being none other than al-Muqtana Bahā’-al-Dīn, the fifth and last
supreme minister who stands at the head of a lower hierarchy <span
id="fr_118"></span>[3](#fn_118.md) and whose multitudinous treatises and
epistles, together

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

with those of Ḥamzah, form the Druze sacred literature. This
Bahā’-al-Dīn may have been of Christian origin <span
id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_119.md) as his writings reveal unusual
familiarity with the New Testament and Christian liturgy. (See Appendix
E.)

*The Neo-Platonic Source:*—We are evidently here in the atmosphere of
the "emanation" theory which characterizes both Neo-Platonic <span
id="fr_120"></span>[2](#fn_120.md) and Gnostic schools of philosophy and
which must have filtered into the Druze system through Qarāmiṭah and
"Brethren of Purity" channels. According to Professor Scott in Hastings'
Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, <span
id="fr_121"></span>[3](#fn_121.md) "The first characteristic feature of
Gnosticism is that at the head of the Universe stands a supreme God who
is not so much a personal Deity as the abstract ground of all existence.
From the supreme God there proceed a number of beings in a descending
scale of dignity who are arranged in pairs, male and female."

The third minister, the "Word," is presumably an echo of the Christian
Alexandrian *Logos*.

The doctrine of "Opposers," or the simultaneous revelation of the Deity
in a good principle and an evil principle, parallels the Zoroastrian
dualistic doctrine and reminds us of the Syzygy theory in the
pseudo-Clementines. <span id="fr_122"></span>[4](#fn_122.md) The
Zoroastrian influence is further shown by the reference to God as the
"light" with the opposing principle as the "darkness." <span
id="fr_123"></span>[5](#fn_123.md) A further working out of this same
principle in the Druze system is in the case of the

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

creation of the prophets where many of them have "Opposers." Adam for
instance has Ḥārith ibn-Tarmāḥ against him. <span
id="fr_124"></span>[1](#fn_124.md)

Like Neo-Platonism and Gnosticism, the Nuṣayriyyah assume an agent of
creation, a demiurge, in the person of ‘Ali. The Mufawwaḍiyyah <span
id="fr_125"></span>[2](#fn_125) (the Believers in Entrusting.md) taught
that God had entrusted Muḥammad with the creation and management of the
universe, but Muḥammad in turn entrusted ‘Ali with the task. But the
"Brethren of Purity" have perhaps contributed more than any one else
towards the introduction into and the formulation of the
emanation-demiurge idea in Islam, and that because through their
religious philosophic works, <span id="fr_126"></span>[3](#fn_126.md) which
were encyclopaedic in their character, they not only gave technical
expression in Arabic to the foreign concepts involved but popularized
the concepts and gave the expressions currency.

*Inferior Ministers:*—Below the five superior ministers and standing in
a subordinate position to them are three orders of minor ministers which
we may term: "Propagator" (Dā‘ī), "Licensed" (Ma’dhūn), and "Pioneer"
(*Mukāsir* or *Naqīb*). <span id="fr_127"></span>[4](#fn_127.md) Their
functions are not clearly defined in the Druze manuscripts, but seem to
be of the missionary type. This can be ascertained from the meaning of
the Arabic names applied to them and from a study of corresponding
officials in the Bāṭiniyyah system, which was one of the best and most
efficiently organized systems of religious propaganda that Islam ever
developed.

The "Propagator" assumes the *rōle* of the chief agent for the spreading
of the faith. The "Licensed" has authority to preach, but is subject to
the direction and guidance of the "Propagator." The "Pioneer" assumes
responsibility for arousing the doubts of the would-be convert regarding
his old beliefs, thus preparing him for the reception of the novel
religion as soon as it is

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

preached to him by a "Licensed" or a "Propagator." His office, as the
Arabic name indicates, is one of breaking up and destroying.

Here again the male and female principles are represented in these
ministers in their relation one to the other, and to the upper
hierarchy. The "Propagator" is in the position of a wife with respect to
the "Ḥujjah", and of a husband with respect to the "Licensed." The
"Licensed" is in the position of a wife to the "Propagator," and a
husband to the "Pioneer." The same double status applies to the
"Pioneer." <span id="fr_128"></span>[1](#fn_128.md)

Below these inferior ministers stand the rank and file of Druze
believers.

#### IV. THE PROPHETIC SUCCESSION

*Seven Major Prophets:*—Next in rank to the divine ministers in the
Druze hierarchy stand the prophets. The prophetic succession tallies in
general with the preceding Ismā'īliyyah series of seven. <span
id="fr_129"></span>[2](#fn_129.md) Adam heads the list which includes Noah,
Abraham, Moses, Jesus (‘Īsa ibn-Yūsuf), Muḥammad, and Muḥammad
ibn-Ismā‘il. Each one of these legislating prophets (*Nāṭiq*) has by his
side a minor prophet (*Asās*) acting as a lieutenant or substitute and
having under him twelve disciples (*Ḥujjah*). The substitute, also
called "silent" (*Ṣāmit*), utters no new doctrine but merely teaches and
develops that which he has received from his chief, the legislative
prophet. The substitute represents the female and the legislator the
male principles. <span id="fr_130"></span>[3](#fn_130.md) The list of
substitutes includes Ishmael, Aaron, Simon and ‘Ali, and that of
disciples, Enoch, Daniel, Plato and other biblical and Greek
characters. <span id="fr_131"></span>[4](#fn_131.md) Each "period" or
"cycle" is introduced by a legislative prophet. Between one legislative
prophet and the other are seven intervening Imāms of whom the first is
in each case the trusted and intimate substitute (*Asās*, *Ṣāmit*) of
his chief, the legislating prophet (*Nāṭiq*).

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

*Seven a Sacred Number:*—As in the case of the "periods" between the
successive incarnations, so in the case of the prophetic successions,
the "periods" or, "cycles" are all nicely arranged and determined by
cabalistic figuring in which the numbers seven and seventy, <span
id="fr_132"></span>[1](#fn_132.md) as is to be expected, take a prominent
place. The Pythagorean origin of this system of computation is not
difficult to detect. Regarding the mystic nature of the number seven,
Bahā’-al-Dīn reasons thus: "Everything when it gets to be seven ends and
should be replaced by another. For example the seven days, when they end
they begin over again. . . Also the heavens are seven, the earths are
seven, the climates are seven, the height of man by his own span is
seven, and the orifices in his face are seven. Likewise the legislative
prophets are seven, their substitutes are seven and the intervening
Imāms between one legislator and the other are seven." <span
id="fr_133"></span>[2](#fn_133.md)

Following their spiritual ancestors, the Ismā‘īliyyah, the Druzes also
believe in seven heavens, seven seas, seven earths and seven hidden
*Imāms*. The identification of the *Imāms* with the heavens becomes an
easy step and betrays ancient Babylonian and Chaldaean astrological
influences. Ismā‘il ibn-Muḥammad is identified with the first heaven;
Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdullāh, with the fourth; al-Ḥusayn ibn-Muḥammad, with
the fifth and ‘Abdullāh ibn-al-Mahdi with the seventh. <span

*Excellence of Druze System:*—Each one of the Druze legislator-prophets
abrogates in his turn the law of the preceding one. So did the
Ismā‘īliyyah prophets. The antecedent of this general idea should be
sought in the abrogation by Muḥammad of the Jewish law <span
id="fr_135"></span>[4](#fn_135.md) and is in harmony, though not identical,
with the Marcionite Gnostic theories. As a corollary to that, the Druzes
consider all former religions, including Christianity, Judaism and

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Islam as
forerunners and varied types of Druzism, which supersedes and excels
them all.

*Adam:*—Of special interest to us are Adam and Jesus who seem to stand
above the other prophets and share in the divine essence. A number of
Jewish Christian sects, such as the Essenes and Nazarenes, adopted this
gnostic view, which, combined with Persian and old Babylonian mythology,
furnished Mani with the doctrine of the original man. The Adam of the
Druze theology, therefore, is not exactly the Adam of Genesis but the
"original man" <span id="fr_136"></span>[1](#fn_136.md) of the Manichaeans,
the *Adam Kadmon* <span id="fr_137"></span>[2](#fn_137.md) of the Jewish
cabala.

Certain Moslem sects, like the Muḥammadiyyah, went so far as to declare
the divinity of Adam.

*Jesus:*—The Jesus (‘Īsa ibn-Yūsuf) of the Druze manuscripts is also
somewhat different from the Jesus of the New Testament. He is rather the
Moslem Jesus patterned after the conception of him by the ancient
heretic sect of the Docetae who held that Christ suffered only in
appearance. This doctrine was handed down to the Moslems probably
through Manichaean channels. <span id="fr_138"></span>[3](#fn_138.md) The
Manichaean movement, which arose in close connection with Mandaeanism in
‘Irāq or southern Babylonia, about the middle of the third century A.D.,
and which, as *al-Fihrist* declares, was a blend of the old Magian cult
with Christianity, <span id="fr_139"></span>[4](#fn_139.md) was Iranian in
its mythology and cosmological beliefs. It exercised a great influence
over the Moslem sects in al-‘Iraq, which was also rich in Jewish and
Christian sects and heresies.

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

#### V. THE INNER MEANING

*The Bāṭiniyyah:*—Having deviated from the letter as well as from the
word of Allah as revealed in the Koran, and without seeming to abrogate
altogether its legislative precepts, certain schools of thought,
designated by orthodox theologians Bāṭiniyyah, found it expedient to
resort to a new and ingenious device—that of interpreting the religious
facts esoterically or allegorically. Though classified by al-Baghdādi,
al-Shahrastāni and ibn-Ḥazm as "sects," the Bāṭiniyyah were rather
unorganized philosophical schools of thought. They belonged in the main
to the Qarāmiṭah and Ismā‘īliyyah sects, from which Druzism sprang, and
to certain Ṣūfi fraternities. Truth, according to the cardinal
Bāṭiniyyah concept, is to be ascertained by the discovery of an inner
meaning (*bāṭin*, hence the appellation Bāṭiniyyah = Innerites) of which
the outer form is a mere veil intended to keep the truth from the eyes
of the uninitiate.

This device put at once into the hands of the Shī‘ah schismatic sects a
powerful weapon which dealt deadly blows to the core of Islam leaving
only its outside shell. The shadow was there but the substance had gone.
Meanwhile it enabled its adepts to appropriate from non-Moslem sources
whatever suited their own convenience.

Thus through Ṣūfi and Shī‘ah channels, Druzism was made to enter into
the inheritance of Philo and early esoteric exegetes.

Darazi, one of the founders of the Druze system—if system it could be
called—was a Bāṭini missionary, as we are told by many of his
biographers. <span id="fr_140"></span>[1](#fn_140.md)

*The Muḥammadan Law Abrogated:*—Between unbridled allegorical
interpretation of the law and its virtual suspension lies one short
step, and that step was actually taken by Ḥamzah, the real founder of
the Druze religion. Following the Ismā‘īliyyah precedent, Ḥamzah, in his
*Kitāb al-Naqḍ al-Khafi*, went so far as to abolish the so-called five
pillars of Islam, including fasting,

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

pilgrimage and almsgiving, and substituted for them four articles of
faith relating to the knowledge of God, of Ḥamzah, the ministers, and
the seven moral precepts. <span id="fr_141"></span>[1](#fn_141.md) These
precepts enjoin the love of truth in speech, watching over one another's
safety, renouncing other religions, recognizing the existence in all
ages of the principle of divine unity in al-Ḥākim and acquiescing in his
actions whatever they be. <span id="fr_142"></span>[2](#fn_142.md)

On account of this, orthodox Islam never hesitated to exclude Druzism
from its fold. In fact certain conservative canonists, like the puritan
ibn-Taymiyyah (1263-1328 A.D.), whose legal system greatly influenced
the rise of the Wahhābi movement in Nejd, went so far as to express a
religious opinion (*fatwa*) favoring "warring against the Druzes as a
more meritorious duty than warring against the Armenians, because the
former are included in the Moslem territory but are not of it." <span
id="fr_143"></span>[3](#fn_143.md)

*The Mystic Element:*—Akin to the esoteric conception of the scriptures
is the principle of mysticism which found its highest expression in
Islam in the Ṣūfi movement and traces of which are prominent in the
Druze initiate view of life. Ṣūfism began as asceticism, became in
succession mystical and theosophical, and finally advanced to extreme
pantheism. The four principal sources of Ṣūfism are Christianity,
Neo-Platonism, Gnosticism and Buddhism. The Neo-Platonic character of
Moslem Ṣūfism has been rendered clear by the contributions of two
English scholars, E. G. Browne and R. A. Nicholson. It would, however,
be a mistake to ignore entirely the influence of the Buddhist view upon
the later development of historic Ṣūfism, especially after Islam had
spread eastward to the confines of China and brought Indian thought
within its horizon. The encyclopaedic author of *al-Fihrist* <span
id="fr_144"></span>[4](#fn_144) († 996.md) quotes at some length from an
archaic version

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

of a Buddhist book. The monumental piece of Arabic literature
*al-Aghāni* <span id="fr_145"></span>[1](#fn_145.md) has left us at least
one portrayal of an unmistakable Buddhistic view of life. And the
*Zindīq* monks, described by al Jāḥiẓ, <span
id="fr_146"></span>[2](#fn_146.md) were, according to Goldziher, "Either
Indian Sadhus, or Buddhist monks or at least their imitators." <span
id="fr_147"></span>[3](#fn_147.md) Under Indian influence the pantheistic
idea in Ṣūfi Islam becomes more apparent.

*Sheikhs:*—The Druzes share with their intellectual ancestors—the Ṣūfis,
Ismā‘īliyyah and Qarāmiṭah—both the esoteric interpretation of the law
and the mystical outlook on life. Their community is divided into
*‘Uqqāl*, initiate, intelligent, spiritual; and *Juhhāl*, uninitiate,
ignorant, worldly. A course *ṣūf* <span id="fr_148"></span>[4](#fn_148.md)
(wool) outer garment is the distinguishing dress of the former, among
whom the most meritorious *Ajāwīd* lead an almost ascetic life.

The *‘Uqqāl* are also called "*Sheikhs*," <span
id="fr_149"></span>[5](#fn_149.md) an Arabic word connoting old age,
seniority and respect. This word has in recent years been introduced
into the English language and corrupted in both pronunciation and
meaning.

To the high rank of enlightened *‘Uqqāl*, no one can aspire whose
character has not marked him out as one entirely trustworthy and capable
of extreme secrecy. Before admission, however, he must be subjected to a
rigorous process of long trial and probation. Then follows the
ceremonial rite of induction. This secret ceremony has been witnessed
and described by only one or two outsiders throughout the whole history
of the Druze religion.

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

Once admitted to the favored rank, the Sheikh begins to wear a heavy
white turban, and abstains from gaudy colors, swearing and obscene
language. His deportment becomes dignified and reserved. Under no
condition is he thereafter to touch alcoholic liquor or to smoke. He may
even refrain from eating at the table of a wealthy man or government
official lest something of the money used in buying the food might have
been illegitimately acquired.

That Islam knew a great deal about Mani and Manichaeanism is evidenced
by the fact that our oldest and most trustworthy sources on that
movement are to be found in Arabic-Moslem literature and particularly
al-Fihrist. A peculiar sect of Manichaeanism, Mazdakiyyah, seems to have
exercised tremendous influence over the Moslem sects. Al-Shahrastāni
(II, 29) informs us that the Bāṭiniyyah and Qarāmiṭah in al-‘Irāq were
called "Mazdakites."
