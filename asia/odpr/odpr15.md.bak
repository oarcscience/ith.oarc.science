### APPENDIX D

### EXCERPT FROM THE EPISTLE ENTITLED AL-QUSṬANṬĪNIYYAH ADDRESSED BY BAHĀ’-AL-DĪN TO THE BYZANTINE EMPEROR CONSTANTINE <span id="fr_203"></span>[1](#fn_203.md)

As for what you say in the special canticle for the Eucharist that "He
suffered, was crucified in the time of Fayṭus, son of Qīlāṭūs, <span
id="fr_204"></span>[2](#fn_204.md) was buried and arose on the third day,"
it is all recorded in the Gospel of John, chapter two, where Jesus
addressing the Jews said to them: "Destroy the temple and I will raise
it up in three days." <span id="fr_205"></span>[3](#fn_205.md) The Jews
refused to believe his word that he would build the temple in three
days. But what he meant was the temple of his body. And having mentioned
\[later\] to his disciples what he had said they believed in the
book <span id="fr_206"></span>[4](#fn_206.md) and in the word. Such is the
text in the Gospel of John.

You should therefore know, you assembly of saints, that what he meant by
the three days of his disappearance is firstly the day in which he
declared his mission and called all mankind to the religion of Unity and
truth <span id="fr_207"></span>[5](#fn_207.md) and revealed himself to the
nations as a "true God from a true God." By that he meant that the
Creator (may his power remain exalted!) is existent in his creatures,
and that he manifests himself to them, as he has predetermined, in forms
similar to their forms, and that he is

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

not a nonentity so that it becomes necessary to use arguments to prove
his existence to all his creation. Contemplate the truths of this
assertion and beseech the Lord of guidance and might to accord you
success.

As for the second day, that is the day of the appearance of the
Paraclete. <span id="fr_208"></span>[1](#fn_208.md) Jesus has announced the
Paraclete and predicted his coming, as Jesus has said in the Gospel of
John: "Moses has written about me and predicted the mention of my
name." <span id="fr_209"></span>[2](#fn_209.md) As for the Paraclete, he is
Muḥammad, who is one of the legislators by whom I mean: Noah, Abraham,
and Moses who appeared prior to the lord Messiah. And behold the saying
of Jesus in the fifteenth chapter, <span id="fr_210"></span>[3](#fn_210.md)
when he realized the coming of the Paraclete, *i.e.*, Muḥammad: "If you
loved me you would rejoice at my departure to my Father, for my Father
has a son who is greater than I. And now I have said this to you before
it comes to pass, so when it comes to pass you shall believe in me." He
did not say "believe in him." Then follows: "I shall not say many things
to you, because the chief of this world shall come, and he has nothing
in common with me. But this is so that people may know that I love my
father."

The world withal never understood the meaning of his sayings. Jesus said
that he \[the Paraclete = Muḥammad\] is the chief of this world only,
and not of the next. This position, he—as well as the other
legislators—attained, in fulfillment of the wisdom of the Creator, in
order to have the case clear against mankind, one generation after
another, and to render them subject to blame and condemnation; for they
failed to follow what the Creator (may his power remain exalted!) had
commanded them regarding the confession of Unity, which they forsook
reverting by tradition to the worship of falsehood.

Referring to the Paraclete, Jesus said: "He has nothing in common with
me." This is simply to inform you that he shall

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

not call mankind to a belief in the adorable Unity, as the Lord
\[Ḥamzah\] shall call you to find the Creator in the Ḥākim-God, worthy
of adoration.

As for the third day, it is the rise of al-Mahdi <span
id="fr_211"></span>[1](#fn_211) (may Allah's blessing be upon him!.md) in
order to call mankind to the inner interpretation of the four books
which show the people of truth the fact of Unity. These four books are:
the Psalter, the Torah \[Bible\], the Evangile and the Koran.

His \[al-Mahdi's\] epistles and proofs were received in their time by
Constantine, the emperor of the Christians, and there is no doubt but
that a record thereof is kept by the leading savants of that period,
because his message differed from that of the other legislators who are
weak; he having called people to the belief in the last day signalized
by the appearance of the lord Messiah.

When, then, a man of understanding considers, and when a wise man,
wishing to learn, removes the veil from a wide-awake, seeing and knowing
heart, he would find out that al-Mahdi (may peace be upon him!) appeared
and called to a belief in the inner interpretation of the aforementioned
four books in the days of Constantine I, and that the lord Messiah
\[Ḥamzah\] appeared calling to a belief in Unity in the days of
Constantine II. People of intelligence would certainly find in this
something to restrain them; and anyone possessed with the least notions
of the science of truths would find material for reflection.

The third day is the complement of the first, according to the seventh
chapter of the Gospel of John. <span id="fr_212"></span>[2](#fn_212.md)
When the brothers of Jesus said to him: "Depart from here, so that your
disciples may see the things you are doing, because no one should do a
thing in secret, and reveal yourself to the world," the brothers of
Jesus had not then believed in him. So Jesus said to them: "As for my
time it has not arrived in realization," by which

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

he meant that his day was not yet completed. It is completed only when
Jesus announces that he is ready to come again \[into this world\].

By his saying, "As for your time it is always ready," he meant to inform
them that the time in which he was going to declare the word of Unity
was not yet completed and had not yet come, but that their time—that is
the time of those who did not know the word of Unity—was always ready.
That is the last day which is the completion of the first. In it he
\[the lord Messiah\] has manifested his glory and his praise and has
shown himself to his apostles as he had promised them in chapter
sixteen, <span id="fr_213"></span>[1](#fn_213.md) saying: "I have come down
from heaven not to do my will, but the will of him who sent me. The will
of him who sent me is that whosoever obeys me him will I resurrect on
the last day; for this is the pleasure of my Father. For everyone who
sees the son and believes in him is entitled to everlasting life which
is fixed to the last day."

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Written seven days before the end of Safar, in the eleventh year of the
era of the Ruler of the Age \[Ḥamzah\] at the end of the seventh year
from the "disappearance \[of al-Ḥakīm\] for our test." <span
id="fr_214"></span>[2](#fn_214.md) This is the end; and praise be to our
lord al-Ḥakīm alone, and thanks to the Messiah of the nations \[Ḥamzah\]
and their guide, his servant.
