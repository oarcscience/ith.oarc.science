### PREFACE

THIS study is based on two papers: one presented in the annual meeting
of the American Historical Association, held at Rochester, New York,
December 30, 1926; and the other in the annual meeting of the American
Oriental Society, held at Cincinnati, Ohio, April 20, 1927. The thanks
of the author are due to Professor Dana C. Munro, President of the
American Historical Association; to Professor James A. Montgomery,
President of the American Oriental Society; and to Professor Harold H.
Bender, Chairman of the Department of Oriental Languages and Literatures
at Princeton University, for many valuable suggestions and criticisms.
He also wishes to acknowledge with thanks the assistance he received
from his wife in verifying references, reading the proofs, and sketching
the map inserted in this book.

PRINCETON, May, 1928.

P. K. H.
