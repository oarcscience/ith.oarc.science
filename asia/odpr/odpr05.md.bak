### CHAPTER I

### A UNIQUE AND SECRET SECT

*Two Historical Fossils:*—The Druzes of Syria and the Samaritans of
Palestine are two unique communities not to be found elsewhere in the
whole world. Like social fossils in an alien environment, these two
peoples have survived for hundreds of years in that land rightly
described as a "Babel of tongues" and a "museum of nationalities."

The Samaritans are the remnants of the tribes from Assyria and Persia
who were transplanted by Sargon some seven hundred years before Christ
to take the place of the "ten tribes" who were carried into
captivity. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) They figured in the life of
Christ as is illustrated by the case of the "Samaritan woman" and the
story of the "good Samaritan." Today they are represented by about one
hundred and eighty persons who intermarry among themselves and are
becoming rapidly extinct. Their habitat is modern Nāblus (biblical
Shechem), and their religion is ancient Judaism mixed with pagan
survivals.

The Druzes have no such clear record to show regarding their origin as a
people and as a sect. Their ethnographical origins, no less than their
ritual practices and religious beliefs, are shrouded in mystery.
Appearing for the first time on the pages of history at Wādi-al-Taym
near Mt. Hermon in anti-Lebanon, as professors of the divinity of the
sixth Fāṭimite Caliph in Cairo (996-1020 A.D.), the Druzes have lived
their semi-independent lives secluded in their mountain fastnesses of
Lebanon, unmindful of the progress of the world around them, and almost
entirely forgotten by the outside world.

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

Relation to World Events:—The few occasions throughout their history in
which the Druzes attracted international attention were first at the
time of the Crusades, when they were entrusted by the Moslems with the
military task of guarding the maritime plain against the Franks. They
then fought under the banner of Islam and took part in the attacks
against the garrisons of Belfort (*Qal‘at al-Shaqīf*) and of Montfort
(*Qal‘at Qurayn*) in Galilee. Secondly, in the early seventeenth century
when their great leader, Fakhr-al-Dīn II (1585-1635), under whom the
Druze power reached its zenith, appeared as a refugee from the Sultan of
Turkey in the court of the Medicis at Florence. Thirdly, when as a
result of their civil wars in 1860 with their Christian neighbors to the
north—the Maronites—the French landed a contingent of troops to quell
the disturbance which resulted in giving the Lebanon a complete autonomy
recognized by the great Powers of Europe. And fourthly, in connection
with the recent armed uprising against the French mandate in Syria.

*Minor Episodes:*—In the local history of Syria and the Lebanon, the
Druzes have always figured as a compact and warlike community contriving
to enjoy in the fastnesses of their mountain a comparative degree of
security and independence. The Latin Kingdom of the Crusades, which with
its extensive fiefs formed an elongated strip of land based on the sea
and widening on the north to Edessa and on the south to Moab, narrowed
in the vicinity of Mt. Hermon, the home of the Druzes. Throughout the
Ottoman period (1516-1918) the Druzes and their fellow mountaineers, the
Maronites, constituted a thorn in the side of the Turks. The Lebanon
enjoyed most of the time local autonomy. Even the Druzes of Ḥawrān, the
Bashan of the Bible, were not subject to conscription, and repeatedly
refused to pay taxes to the Sublime Porte. When Napoleon in 1798-1799
invaded Egypt and Syria, he sought the aid of the governor of the
Lebanon, al-Amīr Bashīr. The Druze resistance to the invasion of the
Egyptian army under Ibrāhīm Pasha (1831-1838) was one of the factors in
hastening the withdrawal of that army from Syrian soil.

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

*Other Secret Sects:*—The Druze people constitute one of the two leading
secret sects found only in Syria, the other being the Nuṣayriyyah
inhabiting the mountains north of Tripoli. The Ismā‘īliyyah of the Ḥimṣ
and Ḥamāh district, another secret sect, are descended from the
Assassins, <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) who for two centuries or so
struck awe and terror into the hearts of the Crusaders, and are
represented today by a few other sectarians in Persia and India. The
Yezīdis, so-called devil worshipers, practice their hidden rites in the
out-of-the-way hills between Antioch and Aleppo and have coreligionists
in Kurdistan and Armenia.

*Special Interest of this Study:*—But of all these sects Druzism is
perhaps the most interesting and important. It is still a living force.
Its followers form to the present day a vigorous and flourishing
community in the Lebanon. Its learned system has not changed since it
was first inaugurated in the early part of the eleventh century. The
Islam of the Near East has changed and adapted itself to the
requirements of the varying conditions. The Christianity of the Near
East has changed. But the Druze system has been and still is the same.

The modernizing influence has in late years brought within its sphere
quite a large number of the young and uninitiated Druzes. The report of
the American University of Beirūt for last year indicates that there are
in that institution alone thirty-six Druze students and five Druze
teachers. But no one with first-hand knowledge of the situation would go
so far as even to recognize the existence of a "modernist movement"
alleged to be aiming at divulging the Druze beliefs, much less to
declare "It is understood that Dr. Bliss of Beirūt will be the probable
intermediary of communication with the western world if this disclosure
takes place." <span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2.md)

In fact the outside world knows so little about the contents of this
religion that in a recent session of the Permanent Mandates

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Commission of the
League of Nations the question was raised as to whether there was
anything in the Druze teachings that was inimical to organized
government and to state authority.

A study of Druzism is especially valuable and interesting not only
because its adherents, unlike the adherents of the other sects, have
shown remarkable vitality and thrust themselves repeatedly upon the
attention of the world—as in the case of the current events in Syria—but
because of its historic connection with Christianity and Oriental
Christian sects. In its rise and development from Moslem soil, Druzism
held close relationship to Christianity and became heir to a number of
Zoroastrian and Judaeo-Christian sects, as well as to a body of
Hellenistic and Persian philosophies. Many of those sects and schools of
thought have since disappeared, but Druzism is still with us; and,
through its medium, their ideas have survived to the present day. The
religious and philosophical concepts of many Shī‘ite Moslem, and a few
semi-Christian, sects have been preserved to us through Druzism, though
the original sects and their votaries have long become extinct.

As we shall, therefore, in the following pages analyze and investigate
the apparently strange dogmas and tenets of Druze belief, we shall find
in addition to Neo-Platonic and Manichaean influences, marked traces of
Jewish and Christian influences which have trickled thereto through
Moslem strata. The basic fundamentals of Druze theology, as we shall
see, are paralleled by corresponding Christian dogmas. One of the
founders of Druzism was a renegade Christian, and many of its early
leading converts were tribes belonging to some one of the Oriental
churches.

There is, after all, nothing mysterious in the "Asian mystery," and the
"great enigma" does lend itself to solution.
