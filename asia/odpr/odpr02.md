### FOREWORD

FOR some nine hundred years, a strange national-religious body has lived
in Syria. The Druzes have been the wonder of scholars, and the political
opponents of those to whom the country in which they lived belonged. All
sorts of theories have been advanced by scholars to account for their
peculiar tenets and customs. All sorts of means have been tried by their
overlords to put them down. The scholars have been as unsuccessful as
have been the overlords; and the Druzes still remain the great mystery
of the Lebanon Mountains.

In the following study, a more serious attempt is made to solve the
riddle of whom the Druzes are, why they are, and where they are.
Professor Hitti is probably better fitted to make this attempt than is
any other scholar. Born in the Lebanon Mountains, Arabic is his native
tongue. As a boy, and as a young man, he associated with the Druzes. He
has had, and still has, access to their literature. It is likely that he
knows more about them than they do about themselves. For this reason, I
commend the following pages very highly to the attention of all who are
concerned about Syria, and who are interested in the history of
religion.
