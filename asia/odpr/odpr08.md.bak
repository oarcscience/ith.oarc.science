#### CHAPTER IV

#### THE PERSIAN ORIGIN OF THE DRUZES

What then are the racial affinities of that singular people which for
the last nine hundred years has grouped itself with marvelous cohesion,
solidarity and consciousness of kind, around the divine person of a
whimsical Caliph? Or, to reduce our question to its lowest denomination,
what were the racial connections of that little community at the foot of
Mt. Hermon, in Wādi-al-Taym, which in 407 A.H. <span
id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md)/1016 A.D. responded to the mission of
Darazi and consequently assumed his name?

*The Persian Nucleus at Wādi-al-Taym:*—It is safe for us to make two
postulates at the very outset. First, the people who later became known
as the "Druzes" must have formed a more or less socially homogeneous
community prior to the advent of Darazi. Second, that homogeneous
community must have had in it something which predisposed it for the
favorable reception of the seemingly strange and peculiar doctrines
proclaimed by Darazi, and, having accepted them, to cherish and
perpetuate those doctrines. Something in the social and intellectual
make-up of that primitive community at Wādi-al-Taym must have made it
respond whole-heartedly to Druzism and proved a fertile soil for the
germination of its dogmas.

The trustworthy Egyptian historian, ibn-Taghri-Birdi († 1469 A.D.), who
is the first authority to give us any explanation as to why al-Ḥakīm
chose, of all places, Wādi-al-Taym as the scene for his Syrian
propaganda, gives that explanation, which he, of course, draws from
earlier documents, in the following words:

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "And al-Ḥakīm said
to Darazi, 'Proceed into Syria and spread the cause in the mountains
because their people are quick to follow.'" <span
id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md) This reason may sound strange considering
the rightly reputed conservative character of mountaineers, but at least
it makes it clear that Darazi proceeded to Wādi-al-Taym according to
preconceived plans and he made its population his first objective. And
since his new doctrine was at the core an incarnational one of the
extreme Shī‘ite type which had been previously developed in ‘Irāq and
Persia, it is logical to assume that the natives of Wādi-al-Taym must
have been subjected to ‘Irāqizing or Persianizing influence before.

*The Founders of Druzism All Persian:*—It should also be remembered in
this connection that Darazi himself was of Turco-Persian origin. <span
id="fr_51"></span>[2](#fn_51.md) His sect was the Ismā‘īliyyah. <span
id="fr_52"></span>[3](#fn_52.md) His theological philosophy was Bāṭiniyyah
(Innerite), i.e., the system of giving an esoteric, inner meaning to the
scriptures other than the apparent, literal one. Ḥamzah, the teacher of
Darazi <span id="fr_53"></span>[4](#fn_53.md) and the brains of the whole
movement, especially after Darazi had fallen into disrepute, was of
undoubted Persian origin. <span id="fr_54"></span>[5](#fn_54.md) Besides,
the whole

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Fāṭimite dynasty,
whose claim of legitimacy of descent from ‘Ali and Fāṭimah has been
either suspected or vehemently denied by many judicious Moslem
historians, was probably founded by, and descended from, a Persian
adventurous ancestor who exploited a ‘Alid tradition and a ‘Alid fetish
for his own personal interest and for the aggrandizement of his progeny.

*The Testimony of Religious Vocabulary:*—If we, furthermore, investigate
the technical terms current in the Druze religious vocabulary, we find
many of them, including the word for God, *al-Bār* (from
Barkhoda), <span id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55.md) of clear Persian
origin. <span id="fr_56"></span>[2](#fn_56.md) It is significant that the
Druze password as taught in their catechism, formulated after the time
of Ḥamzah and al-Muqtana and patterned after the Christian system of
questions and answers, consists in the proper answer to the catch
question, "Do they plant the seeds of *halālīj* \[or *ihlilīj*, from
Persian *halīlah* = *myrobalan citrina*\] in your country?" <span
id="fr_57"></span>[3](#fn_57.md) If the man is a Druze his answer would be,
"Yes, they are planted in the hearts of the believers."

*Names of Feudal Families:*—A study, therefore, of the Druze dogmas,
their religious vocabulary and the nationality of the missionaries would
suggest ‘Irāqi and Persian beginnings for the Druze people. This
conclusion regarding the Persian racial origins of the Druzes which we
have reached is in contradiction to almost all other conclusions reached
by travelers and historians. <span id="fr_58"></span>[4](#fn_58.md) It is

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

further corroborated by an investigation of the genealogies of the chief
feudal families which we shall now consider.

The leading families among the Druzes have been throughout their history
either of full Kurdish and Persian origin or of Persianized and
‘Irāqized Arab origin. That is, they have been either Kurdish and
Persian families or tribes from the Arabian peninsula who, before their
advent into the Lebanon, sojourned for many generations in Mesopotamia
where they became fully indoctrinated with the ‘Alid ideas and subjected
to Gnostic and Manichaean influences.

Wādi-al-Taym, the place where the Druzes first appear in history under
that name, <span id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_59.md) is so called after an
Arab tribe Taym-Allāh (formerly Taym-Allāt) which, according to the
greatest Arab historian, al-Ṭabari, <span id="fr_60"></span>[2](#fn_60.md)
first came from Arabia into the valley of the Euphrates where they were
Christianized prior to their migration into the Lebanon. Many of the
Druze feudal families whose genealogies have been preserved to us by the
two modern Syrian chroniclers: al-Amīr Ḥaydar and al-Shidyāq, seem also
to point in the direction of the same origin—Arabian tribes which
emigrated via the Persian Gulf and stopped in ‘Irāq on the route that
was later to lead them to Syria. The first feudal Druze family, the
banu-Tanūkh, which made for itself a name in fighting the Crusaders
under authorization from the Sultan Nūr-al-Dīn of Damascus, was
according to Ḥaydar, <span id="fr_61"></span>[3](#fn_61.md) an Arab tribe
from al-Ḥīrah (Mesopotamia) where it occupied the position of a ruling
family and was apparently christianized. The Tanūkhs must have left
Arabia as early as the second or third century A.D. The Ma‘n tribe which
superseded the Tanūkhs and produced the greatest Druze hero in history,
Fakhr-al-Dīn, had the same traditional origin, <span
id="fr_62"></span>[4](#fn_62.md) although Fakhr-al-Dīn himself is quoted,
on the authority

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

of a grandson of his, as saying that the Ma‘ns were Kurds. <span
id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63.md) The banu-Taḷhūq <span
id="fr_64"></span>[2](#fn_64.md) and ‘Abd-al-Malik <span
id="fr_65"></span>[3](#fn_65.md) who supplied the later Druze leadership
have the same record as the Tanūkhs. The banu-‘Imād are so-called from
al ‘Imādiyyah, <span id="fr_66"></span>[4](#fn_66.md) near al-Mawṣil, and,
like the Junblāṭs, <span id="fr_67"></span>[5](#fn_67.md) are of Kurdish
origin. The Arislāns claim descent from the Ḥīrah Arab kings, but the
name (*Arslan* = lion) suggests Persian influence if not origin. It was
in conformity with the principle of racial dissimulation (*taqiyyah*)
that many Druze families of Kurdish and Persian origins claimed Arab
descent.

It is interesting to note that most of these Druze Arab tribes trace
their origin to southern Arabia, and not to the Ḥijāz tribes which
flooded western Asia at the time of the Moslem conquests. This would
imply an earlier migration into ‘Irāq than the rise of Islam, and a
sojourn of many generations in a sphere of Persian influence.

*Persian Tribes Transplanted into Syria:*—That the Indo-Iranian elements
in the blood of the historic Druzes are varied and multiplied can be
safely assumed, not only on the ground of probable beginning and
intermarriages in their earlier home, Mesopotamia, but on the ground of
possible admixture in Syria itself where many Persians had been
domiciled prior to the rise of Druzism. Al-Balādhuri, the most judicious
of the early Arab historians, informs us that Mu‘āwiyah (660-680 A.D.),
among other Umayyad Caliphs, transplanted on different occasions quite a
number of Persian and Mesopotamian tribes into the districts of
Ba‘labakk, Ḥimṣ, Ṣūr (Tyre) and elsewhere in order, evidently, to take
the place of the Byzantines who had evacuated Syria subsequent to its
conquest by the Moslem Arabs. <span id="fr_68"></span>[6](#fn_68.md) In the

(a vols., Paris, 1838), I, CCLXXXIV, thinks he was a Turk. By many
historians he is described *min muwalladi al-atrāk*, i.e., one of his
parents was Turkish, of course, not Ottoman Turkish, but one from Persia
or Turkestan. See al-Muḥibbi, *Khulāṣat al-Athar* (Cairo, 1284 A.H.), p.

Darazi with Ḥamzah making them both one man "Ḥamzah-al-Duruzi."

to him as "al-Zūzani," i.e., coming from Zūzan in Persia. *The Governors

his *Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem*, *op. cit.*, p. 235, makes the

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Persian tribes

possible that some tribes landed in Wādi-al-Taym, which, according to a
passage in ibn-al-Athīr, <span id="fr_70"></span>[2](#fn_70.md) recorded
under the events of 523 A.H./1128 A.D., was included in the district of
Ba‘labakk. According to the same passage, Wādi-al-Taym was then swarming
with diverse heterodoxies, such as the "Nuṣayriyyah, Durziyyah and
Majūs" (Magians = Manichaeans or some Zoroastrian sect). The modern
Shī‘ah of Syria, popularly known as "Matāwilah" may go back to one or
more of these transplanted Persian tribes. <span
id="fr_71"></span>[3](#fn_71.md)

Racially, therefore, the Druze people were a mixture of Persians,
‘Irāqis, and Persianized Arabs, and were thereby admirably fitted for
the reception of the Druze dogmas and tenets of belief, which we shall
next take up.
