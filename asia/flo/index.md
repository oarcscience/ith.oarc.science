This is an anthology of tales from several widely separated Asian
story-telling traditions, with the center of gravity somewhere in
Persia. This was originally published in a series of 'folklore and
legends' volumes by the firm of W.W. Gibbings between 1891 and 1905, and
the author (editor?) is unnamed, but the initials C.J.T. given after the
preface are apparently those of one Charles John Tibbitts. It has been
republished as Oriental Myths and Legends. The book is meant to be
enjoyed as light reading, and the stories are unattributed and
uncredited. However, by internal evidence, the tales originate from
Arabian, Persian, Indian, and Kalmyk sources, and have Islamic, Hindu,
Buddhist and Zoroastrian elements.

Of some interest are the Kalmyk tales; the extended Scheherazade-like
Relations of Ssidi Kur is a märchen-cycle from the Buddhist Kalmyk
people, who today reside on the west shore of the Caspian Sea, and have
strong historical connections to Tibet and Mongolia. This is the only
time that I've seen an English translation of the Ssidi Kur. My best
guess as to the origin of each other tale is indicated in green type
below the title.
