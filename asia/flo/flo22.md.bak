### THE SEVEN STAGES OF ROOSTEM.

Persian

<span class="smallcaps">Persia</span> was at peace, and prosperous; but
its king, Ky-Kâoos, could never remain at rest. A favourite singer gave
him one day an animated account of the beauties of the neighbouring
kingdom of Mazenderan: its ever-blooming roses, its melodious
nightingales, its verdant plains, its mountains shaded with lofty trees,
and adorned to their summits with flowers which perfumed the air, its
clear murmuring rivulets, and, above all, its lovely damsels and valiant
warriors.

All these were described to the sovereign in such glowing colours that
he quite lost his reason, and declared he should never be happy till his
power extended over a country so favoured by Nature. It was in vain that
his wisest ministers and most attached nobles dissuaded him from so
hazardous an enterprise as that of invading a region which had, besides
other defenders, a number of Deevs, or demons, who, acting under their
renowned chief, Deev-e-Seffeed, or the White Demon, had hitherto
defeated all enemies.

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

Ky-Kâoos would not listen to his nobles, who in despair sent for old
Zâl, the father of Roostem, and prince of Seestan. Zâl came, and used
all his efforts, but in vain; the monarch was involved in clouds of
pride, and closed a discussion he had with Zâl by exclaiming, "The
Creator of the world is my friend; the chief of the Deevs is my prey."
This impious boasting satisfied Zâl he could do no good; and he even
refused to become regent of Persia in the absence of Ky-Kâoos, but
promised to aid with his counsel.

The king departed to anticipated conquest; but the prince of Mazenderan
summoned his forces, and, above all, the Deev-e-Seffeed and his band.
They came at his call: a great battle ensued, in which the Persians were
completely defeated. Ky-Kâoos was made prisoner, and confined in a
strong fortress under the guard of a hundred Deevs, commanded by Arjeng,
who was instructed to ask the Persian monarch every morning how he liked
the roses, nightingales, flowers, trees, verdant meadows, shady
mountains, clear streams, beautiful damsels, and valiant warriors of
Mazenderan.

The news of this disaster soon spread over Persia, and notwithstanding
the disgust of old Zâl at the headstrong folly of his monarch, he was
deeply afflicted at the tale of his misfortune and disgrace. He sent for
Roostem, to whom he said, "Go, my son, and with thy single arm, and thy
good horse,

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Reksh, release our
sovereign." Roostem instantly obeyed. There were two roads, but he chose
the nearest, though it was reported to be by far the most difficult and
dangerous.

Fatigued with his first day's journey, Roostem lay down to sleep, having
turned Reksh loose to graze in a neighbouring meadow, where he was
attacked by a furious lion; but this wonderful horse, after a short
contest, struck his antagonist to the ground with a blow from his
fore-hoof, and completed the victory by seizing the throat of the royal
animal with his teeth. When Roostem awoke, he was surprised and enraged.
He desired Reksh never again to attempt, unaided, such an encounter.
"Hadst thou been slain," asked he of the intelligent brute, "how should
I have accomplished my enterprise?"

At the second stage Roostem had nearly died of thirst, but his prayers
to the Almighty were heard. A fawn appeared, as if to be his guide; and
following it, he was conducted to a clear fountain, where, after
regaling on the flesh of a wild ass, which he had killed with his bow,
he lay down to sleep. In the middle of the night a monstrous serpent,
seventy yards in length, came out of its hiding-place, and made at the
hero, who was awaked by the neighing of Reksh; but the serpent had crept
back to its hiding-place, and Roostem, seeing no danger, abused his
faithful horse for disturbing his repose. Another

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

attempt of the serpent was defeated in the same way; but as the monster
had again concealed itself, Roostem lost all patience with Reksh, whom
he threatened to put to death if he again awaked him by any such
unseasonable noises. The faithful steed, fearing his master's rage, but
strong in his attachment, instead of neighing when the serpent again
made his appearance, sprang upon it, and commenced a furious contest.
Roostem, hearing the noise, started up and joined in the combat. The
serpent darted at him, but he avoided it, and, while his noble horse
seized their enemy by the back, the hero cut off its head with his
sword.

When the serpent was slain, Roostem contemplated its enormous size with
amazement, and, with that piety which always distinguished him, returned
thanks to the Almighty for his miraculous escape.

Next day, as Roostem sat by a fountain, he saw a beautiful damsel
regaling herself with wine. He approached her, accepted her invitation
to partake of the beverage, and clasped her in his arms as if she had
been an angel. It happened, in the course of their conversation, that
the Persian hero mentioned the name of the great God he adored. At the
sound of that sacred word the fair features and shape of the female
changed, and she became black, ugly, and deformed. The astonished
Roostem seized her, and after binding her hands, bid her declare who she
was. "I am a sorceress," was the

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

reply, "and have been employed by the evil spirit Aharman for thy
destruction; but save my life, and I am powerful to do thee service." "I
make no compact with the devil or his agents," said the hero, and cut
her in twain. He again poured forth his soul in thanksgiving to God for
his deliverance.

On his fourth stage Roostem lost his way. While wandering about he came
to a clear rivulet, on the banks of which he lay down to take some
repose, having first turned Reksh loose into a field of grain. A
gardener who had charge of it came and awoke the hero, telling him in an
insolent tone that he would soon suffer for his temerity, as the field
in which his horse was feeding belonged to a pehloovân, or warrior,
called Oulâd. Roostem, always irascible, but particularly so when
disturbed in his slumbers, jumped up, tore off the gardener's ears, and
gave him a blow with his fist that broke his nose and teeth. "Take these
marks of my temper to your master," he said, "and tell him to come here,
and he shall have a similar welcome."

Oulâd, when informed of what had passed, was excited to fury, and
prepared to assail the Persian hero, who, expecting him, had put on his
armour and mounted Reksh. His appearance so dismayed Oulâd that he dared
not venture on the combat till he had summoned his adherents. They all
fell upon Roostem at once; but the base-born caitiffs were scattered
like chaff before the wind; many

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

were slain, others fled, among whom was their chief. Him Roostem came up
with at the fifth stage, and having thrown his noose over him, took him
prisoner. Oulâd, in order to save his life, not only gave him full
information of the place where his sovereign was confined, and of the
strength of the Deev-e-Seffeed, but offered to give the hero every aid
in the accomplishment of his perilous enterprise. This offer was
accepted, and he proved a most useful auxiliary.

On the sixth day they saw in the distance the city of Mazenderan, near
which the Deev-e-Seffeed resided. Two chieftains, with numerous
attendants, met them; and one had the audacity to ride up to Roostem,
and seize him by the belt. That chief's fury at this insolence was
unbounded; he disdained, however, to use his arms against such an enemy,
but, seizing the miscreant's head, wrenched it from the body, and hurled
it at his companions, who fled in terror and dismay at this terrible
proof of the hero's prowess.

Roostem proceeded, after this action, with his guide to the castle where
the king was confined. The Deevs who guarded it were asleep, and
Ky-Kâoos was found in a solitary cell, chained to the ground. He
recognised Roostem, and bursting into tears, pressed his deliverer to
his bosom. Roostem immediately began to knock off his chains. The noise
occasioned by this awoke the Deevs, whose

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

leader, Beedâr-Reng, advanced to seize Roostem; but the appearance and
threats of the latter so overawed him that he consented to purchase his
own safety by the instant release of the Persian king and all his
followers.

After this achievement Roostem proceeded to the last and greatest of his
labours, the attack of the Deev-e-Seffeed. Oulâd told him that the Deevs
watched and feasted during the night, but slept during the heat of the
day, hating (according to our narrator) the sunbeams. Roostem, as he
advanced, saw an immense army drawn out; he thought it better, before he
attacked them, to refresh himself by some repose. Having laid himself
down, he soon fell into a sound sleep, and at daylight he awoke quite
refreshed. As soon as the sun became warm, he rushed into the camp. The
heavy blows of his mace soon awoke the surprised and slumbering guards
of the Deev-e-Seffeed; they collected in myriads, hoping to impede his
progress, but all in vain. The rout became general, and none escaped but
those who fled from the field of battle.

When this army was dispersed, Roostem went in search of the
Deev-e-Seffeed, who, ignorant of the fate of his followers, slumbered in
the recess of a cavern, the entrance to which looked so dark and gloomy
that the Persian hero hesitated whether he should advance; but the noise
of his approach had

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

roused his enemy, who came forth, clothed in complete armour. His
appearance was terrible; but Roostem, recommending his soul to God,
struck a desperate blow, which separated the leg of the Deev from his
body. This would on common occasions have terminated the contest, but
far different was the result on the present. Irritated to madness by the
loss of a limb, the monster seized his enemy in his arms, and
endeavoured to throw him down. The struggle was for some time doubtful;
but Roostem, collecting all his strength, by a wondrous effort dashed
his foe to the ground, and seizing him by one of the horns, unsheathed
his dagger and stabbed him to the heart. The Deev-e-Seffeed instantly
expired; and Roostem, on looking round to the entrance of the cavern,
from whence the moment before he had seen numberless Deevs issuing to
the aid of their lord, perceived they were all dead. Oulâd, who stood at
a prudent distance from the scene of combat, now advanced and informed
the hero that the lives of all the Deevs depended upon that of their
chief. When he was slain, the spell which created and preserved this
band was broken, and they all expired.

Roostem found little difficulty after these seven days of toil, of
danger, and of glory, in compelling Mazenderan to submit to Persia. The
king of the country was slain, and Oulâd was appointed its governor as a
reward for his fidelity.

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

The success of his arms had raised Ky-Kâoos to the very plenitude of
power; not only men, but Deevs, obeyed his mandates. The latter he
employed in building palaces of crystal, emeralds, and rubies, till at
last they became quite tired of their toil and abject condition. They
sought, therefore, to destroy him; and to effect this they consulted
with the devil, who, to forward the object, instructed a Deev, called
Dizjkheem, to go to Ky-Kâoos and raise in his mind a passion for
astronomy, and to promise him a nearer view of the celestial bodies than
had ever yet been enjoyed by mortal eyes. The Deev fulfilled his
commission with such success that the king became quite wild with a
desire to attain perfection in this sublime science. The devil then
instructed Dizjkheem to train some young vultures to carry a throne
upwards; this was done by placing spears round the throne, on the points
of which pieces of flesh were fixed in view of the vultures, who were
fastened at the bottom. These voracious birds, in their efforts to reach
the meat, raised the throne.

Though he mounted rapidly for a short time, the vultures became
exhausted, and finding their efforts to reach the meat hopeless,
discontinued them; this altered the direction and equilibrium of the
machine, and it tossed to and fro. Ky-Kâoos would have been cast
headlong and killed had he not clung to it. The vultures, not being able
to

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

disengage themselves, flew an immense way, and at last landed the
affrighted monarch in one of the woods of China. Armies marched in every
direction to discover and release the sovereign, who, it was believed,
had again fallen into the hands of Deevs. He was at last found and
restored to his capital. Roostem, we are told, upbraided his folly,
saying
