### THE TWO CATS.

Arabian?

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> former days there was an old woman,
who lived in a hut more confined than the minds of the ignorant, and
more dark than the tombs of misers. Her companion was a cat, from the
mirror of whose imagination the appearance of bread had never been
reflected, nor had she from friends or strangers ever heard its name. It
was enough that she now and then scented a mouse, or observed the print
of its feet on the floor; when, blessed by favouring stars or benignant
fortune, one fell into her claws—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"She became like a beggar who discovers a treasure
of old;  
 Her cheeks glowed with rapture, and past grief was consumed by present
joy."</span>

</div>

This feast would last for a week or more; and while enjoying it she was
wont to exclaim—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Am I, O God, when I contemplate this, in a dream or
awake?  
 Am I to experience such prosperity after such adversity?"</span>

</div>

But as the dwelling of the old woman was in general the mansion of
famine to this cat, she was

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

always complaining, and forming extravagant and fanciful schemes. One
day, when reduced to extreme weakness, she, with much exertion, reached
the top of the but; when there she observed a cat stalking on the wall
of a neighbour's house, which, like a fierce: tiger, advanced with
measured steps, and was so loaded with flesh that she could hardly raise
her feet. The old woman's friend was amazed to see one of her own
species so fat and sleek, and broke out into the following exclamation:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Your stately strides have brought you here at last;
pray tell me from whence you come?  
 From whence have you arrived with so lovely an appearance?  
 You look as if from the banquet of the Khan of Khatai.  
 Where have you acquired such a comeliness? and how came you by that
glorious strength?"</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The other
answered, "I am the Sultan's crumb-eater. Each morning, when they spread
the convivial table, I attend at the palace, and there exhibit my
address and courage. From among the rich meats and wheat-cakes I cull a
few choice morsels; I then retire and pass my time till next day in
delightful indolence."

The old dame's cat requested to know what rich meat was, and what taste
wheat-cakes had? "As for me," she added, in a melancholy tone, "during
my life I have neither eaten nor seen anything but the old woman's gruel
and the flesh of mice." The other, smiling, said, "This accounts for the
difficulty

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I find in
distinguishing you from a spider. Your shape and stature is such as must
make the whole generation of cats blush; and we must ever feel ashamed
while you carry so miserable an appearance abroad.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">You certainly have the ears and tail of a cat,  
But in other respects you are a complete spider.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Were you to see
the Sultan's palace, and to smell his delicious viands, most undoubtedly
those withered bones would be restored; you would receive new life; you
would come from behind the curtain of invisibility into the plane of
observation

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">When the perfume of his beloved passes over the tomb
of a lover,  
Is it wonderful that his putrid bones should be reanimated?"</span>

</div>

The old woman's cat addressed the other in the most supplicating manner:
"O my sister!" she exclaimed, "have I not the sacred claims of a
neighbour upon you? are we not linked in the ties of kindred? What
prevents your giving a proof of friendship, by taking me with you when
next you visit the palace? Perhaps from your favour plenty may flow to
me, and from your patronage I may attain dignity and honour.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Withdraw not from the friendship of the
honourable;  
Abandon not the support of the elect."</span>

</div>

The heart of the Sultan's crumb-eater was melted

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

by this pathetic address; she promised her new friend should accompany
her on the next visit to the palace. The latter, overjoyed, went down
immediately from the terrace, and communicated every particular to the
old woman, who addressed her with the following counsel:—

"Be not deceived, my dearest friend, with the worldly language you have
listened to; abandon not your corner of content, for the cup of the
covetous is only to be filled by the dust of the grave, and the eye of
cupidity and hope can only be closed by the needle of mortality and the
thread of fate.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">It is content that makes men rich;  
Mark this, ye avaricious, who traverse the world:  
He neither knows nor pays adoration to his God  
Who is dissatisfied with his condition and fortune."</span>

</div>

But the expected feast had taken such possession of poor puss's
imagination, that the medicinal counsel of the old woman was thrown
away.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The good advice of all the world is like wind in a
cage,  
 Or water in a sieve, when bestowed on the headstrong."</span>

</div>

To conclude: next day, accompanied by her companion, the half-starved
cat hobbled to the Sultan's palace. Before this unfortunate wretch came,
as it is decreed that the covetous shall be disappointed, an
extraordinary event had occurred, and, owing to her evil destiny, the
water of disappointment was poured on the flame of her immature
ambition. The case was this: a whole legion of cats had the

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

day before surrounded the feast, and made so much noise that they
disturbed the guests; and in consequence the Sultan had ordered that
some archers armed with bows from Tartary should, on this day, be
concealed, and that whatever cat advanced into the field of valour,
covered with the shield of audacity, should, on eating the first morsel,
be overtaken with their arrows. The old dame's puss was not aware of
this order. The moment the flavour of the viands reached her, she flew
like an eagle to the place of her prey.

Scarcely had the weight of a mouthful been placed in the scale to
balance her hunger, when a heart-dividing arrow pierced her breast.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">A stream of blood rushed from the wound.  
She fled, in dread of death, after having exclaimed,  
"Should I escape from this terrific archer,  
I will be satisfied with my mouse and the miserable hut of my old
mistress.  
My soul rejects the honey if accompanied by the sting.  
Content, with the most frugal fare, is preferable"</span>

</div>
