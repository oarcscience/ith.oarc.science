### PREFATORY NOTE

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> East is rich in Folklore, and the
lorist is not troubled to discover material, but to select only that
which it is best worth his while to preserve. The conditions under which
the people live are most favourable to the preservation of the ancient
legends, and the cultivation of the powers of narration fits the
Oriental to present his stories in a more polished style than is usual
in the Western countries. The reader of these tales will observe many
points of similarity between them and the popular fictions of the
West—similarity of thought and incident—and nothing, perhaps, speaks
more eloquently the universal brotherhood of man than this

oneness of folk-fiction. At the same time, the Tales of the East are
unique, lighted up as they are by a gorgeous extravagance of imagination
which never fails to attract and delight.
