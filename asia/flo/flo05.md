### THE TOMB OF NOOSHEERWAN.

Persian

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> caliph Hâroon-oor-Rasheed went to
visit the tomb of the celebrated Noosheerwân, the most famous of all the
monarchs who ever governed Persia. Before the tomb was a curtain of gold
cloth, which, when Hâroon touched it, fell to pieces. The walls of the
tomb were covered with gold and jewels, whose splendour illumined its
darkness. The body was placed in a sitting posture on a throne enchased
with jewels, and had so much the appearance of life that, on the first
impulse, the Commander of the Faithful bent to the ground, and saluted
the remains of the just Noosheerwân.

Though the face of the departed monarch was like that of a living man,
and the whole of the body in a state of preservation, which showed the
admirable skill of those who embalmed it, yet when the caliph touched
the garments they mouldered into dust. Hâroon upon this took his own
rich robes and threw them over the corpse; he also hung up a new curtain
richer than that he had destroyed, and perfumed

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

the whole tomb with camphor, and other sweet scents.

It was remarked that no change was perceptible in the body of
Noosheerwân, except that the ears had become white. The whole scene
affected the caliph greatly; he burst into tears, and repeated from the
Koran—"What I have seen is a warning to those who have eyes." He
observed some writing upon the throne, which he ordered the Moobids
(priests), who were learned in the Pehlevee language, to read and
explain. They did so: it was as follows

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"This world remains not; the man who thinks least of
it is the wisest.  
 "Enjoy this world before thou becomest its prey.  
 "Bestow the same favour on those below thee as thou desirest to receive
from those above thee.  
 "If thou shouldst conquer the whole world, death will at last conquer
thee.  
 "Be careful that thou art not the dupe of thine own fortune.  
 "Thou shalt be paid exactly for what thou hast done; no more, no
less."  
 The caliph observed a dark ruby-ring on the finger of Noosheerwân, on
which was written  
 "Avoid cruelty, study good, and never be precipitate in action.  
 "If thou shouldst live for a hundred years, never for one moment forget
death.  
 "Value above all things the society of the wise."</span>

</div>

Around the right arm of Noosheerwân was a clasp of gold, on which was
engraved—

<span class="small">"On a certain year, on the 10th day of the month
Erdebehisht,</span>

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

<span class="small">a caliph of the race of Adean, professing the faith
of Mahomed, accompanied by four good men, and one bad, shall visit my
tomb."</span>

Below this sentence were the names of the forefathers of the caliph.
Another prophecy was added concerning Hâroon's pilgrimage to
Noosheerwân's tomb.

<span class="small">"This prince will honour me, and do good unto me,
though I have no claim upon him; and he will clothe me in a new vest,
and besprinkle my tomb with sweet-scented essences, and then depart unto
his home. But the bad man who accompanies him shall act treacherously
towards me. I pray that God may send one of my race to repay the great
favours of the caliph, and to take vengeance on his unworthy companion.
There is, under my throne, an inscription which the caliph must read and
contemplate. Its contents will remind him of me, and make him pardon my
inability to give him more."</span>

The caliph, on hearing this, put his hand under the throne, and found
the inscription, which consisted of some lines, inscribed on a ruby as
large as the palm of the hand. The Moobids read this also. It contained
information where would be found concealed a treasure of gold and arms,
with some caskets of rich jewels; under this was written

<span class="small">"These I give to the caliph in return for the good
he has done me; let him take them and be happy."</span>

When Hâroon-oor-Rasheed was about to leave the tomb, Hoosein-ben-Sâhil,
his vizier, said to him: "O Lord of the Faithful, what is the use of all
these

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

precious gems which ornament the abode of the dead, and are of no
benefit to the living? Allow me to take some of them." The caliph
replied with indignation, "Such a wish is more worthy of a thief than of
a great or wise man." Hoosein was ashamed of his speech, and said to the
servant who had been placed at the entrance of the tomb, "Go thou, and
worship the holy shrine within." The man went into the tomb; he was
above a hundred years old, but he had never seen such a blaze of wealth.
He felt inclined to plunder some of it, but was at first afraid; at
last, summoning all his courage, he took a ring from the finger of
Noosheerwân, and came away.

Hâroon saw this man come out, and observing him alarmed, he at once
conjectured what he had been doing. Addressing those around him, he
said, "Do not you now see the extent of the knowledge of Noosheerwân? He
prophesied that there should be one unworthy man with me. It is this
fellow. What have you taken?" said he, in an angry tone. "Nothing," said
the man. "Search him," said the caliph. It was done, and the ring of
Noosheerwân was found. This the caliph immediately took, and, entering
the tomb, replaced it on the cold finger of the deceased monarch. When
he returned, a terrible sound like that of loud thunder was heard.
Hâroon came down from the mountain on which the tomb stood, and ordered
the road to be made

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

inaccessible to future curiosity. He searched for, and found, in the
place described, the gold, the arms, and the jewels bequeathed to him by
Noosheerwân, and sent them to Bagdad.

Among the rich articles found was a golden crown, which had five sides,
and was richly ornamented with precious stones. On every side a number
of admirable lessons were written. The most remarkable were as follows:—

*First side*.

<span class="small">"Give my regards to those who know themselves.
"Consider the end before you begin, and before you advance provide a
retreat.  
"Give not unnecessary pain to any man, but study the happiness of all.  
"Ground not your dignity upon your power to hurt others."</span>

*Second side*.

<span class="small">"Take counsel before you commence any measure, and
never trust its execution to the inexperienced.  
"Sacrifice your property for your life, and your life for your
religion.  
"Spend your time in establishing a good name; and if you desire fortune,
learn contentment."</span>

*Third side*.

<span class="small">"Grieve not for that which is broken, stolen, burnt,
or lost.  
"Never give orders in another man's house; and accustom yourself to eat
your bread at your own table.  
"Make not yourself the captive of women."</span>

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

*Fourth side*.

<span class="small">"Take not a wife from a bad family, and seat not
thyself with those who have no shame.  
"Keep thyself at a distance from those who are incorrigible in bad
habits, and hold no intercourse with that man who is insensible to
kindness.  
"Covet not the goods of others.  
"Be guarded with monarchs, for they are like fire which blazeth but
destroyeth.  
"Be sensible to your own value; estimate justly the worth of others; and
war not with those who are far above thee in fortune."</span>

*Fifth side*.

<span class="small">"Fear kings, women, and poets.  
"Be envious of no man, and habituate not thyself to search after the
faults of others.  
"Make it a habit to be happy, and avoid being out of temper, or thy life
will pass in misery.  
"Respect and protect the females of thy family.  
"Be not the slave of anger; and in thy contests always leave open the
door of conciliation.  
"Never let your expenses exceed your income.  
"Plant a young tree, or you cannot expect to cut down an old one.  
"Stretch your legs no further than the size of your carpet."</span>

The caliph Hâroon-oor-Rasheed was more pleased with the admirable maxims
inscribed on this crown than with all the treasures he had found. "Write
these precepts," he exclaimed, "in a book, that the faithful may eat of
the fruit of wisdom." When he returned to Bagdad, he related to his
favourite vizier, Jaffier Bermekee, and his other chief officers,

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

all that had passed; and the shade of Noosheerwân was propitiated by the
disgrace of Hoosein-ben-Sâhil (who had recommended despoiling his tomb),
and the exemplary punishment of the servant who had committed the
sacrilegious act of taking the ring from the finger of the departed
monarch.
