### THE SHEPHERD AND THE JOGIE.

Indian

<span class="smallcaps">It</span> is related that during the reign of a
king of Cutch, named Lakeh, a Jogie lived, who was a wise man, and
wonderfully skilled in the preparation of herbs. For years he had been
occupied in searching for a peculiar kind of grass, the roots of which
should be burnt, and a man be thrown into the flames. The body so burnt
would become gold, and any of the members might be removed without the
body sustaining any loss, as the parts so taken would always be
self-restored.

It so occurred that this Jogie, whilst following a flock of goats,
observed one amongst them eating of the grass he was so anxious to
procure. He immediately rooted it up, and desired the shepherd who was
near to assist him in procuring firewood. When he had collected the wood
and kindled a flame, into which the grass was thrown, the Jogie, wishing
to render the shepherd the victim of his avarice, desired him, under
some pretence, to make a few circuits round the fire. The man, however,
suspecting foul play, watched his opportunity, and,

seizing the Jogie himself, he threw him into the fire and left him to be
consumed. Next day, on returning to the spot, great was his surprise to.
behold the golden figure of a man lying amongst the embers. He
immediately chopped off one of the limbs and hid it. The next day he
returned to take another, when his astonishment was yet greater to see
that a fresh limb had replaced the one already taken. In short, the
shepherd soon became wealthy, and revealed the secret of his riches to
the king, Lakeh, who, by the same means, accumulated so much gold that
every day he was in the habit of giving one lac and twenty-five thousand
rupees in alms to fakirs.
