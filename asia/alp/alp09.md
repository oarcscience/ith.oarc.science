### THE APPLE TREE

##### FOLK SONG

     THE door of Heaven open seemed  
     And in thy house the sunlight gleamed.

As through the garden's willow’d walks I hied  
Full many a tree and blossom I espied.  
But of all trees, the Apple Tree most fair  
And beautiful did unto me appear.  
It sobbed and wept. Its leaves said murmuringly:  
"I would that God had ne’er created me!  
The badge of sin and wickedness I am  
E’en at thy feast, O Father Abraham. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0)  
     The apple growing on me first  
     From Eden came ere it was cursed,  
     Alas, alas, I am undone!  
     Why fell I to that evil one?"
