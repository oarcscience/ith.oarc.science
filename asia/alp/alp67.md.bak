##### FOLK SONG

"I HAVE loved your winsome face,  
And your never-fading grace.  
If they give you not to me  
May God send them black disgrace!"

"Mountain sorrel, fresh with dew,  
Sweets I send and honey new;  
Is a dainty maid like me  
Fit to wed a youth like you?"

"You are arch, my little maid,  
In four plaits your hair you braid,  
Make no more pretence to me--  
For you love me, I'm afraid!"

"Drive your plough ahead, and go;  
Underneath it thistles grow.  
You are reckless, young, and wild--  
She is mad would wed you so!"

"Near your house a field I'll sow  
And I'll stone the ill-starred crow.  
When I have the girl I love  
I'll let all my folly go."

"On its way the water flows,  
Washing with its waves the rose.  
My beloved amidst the youths,  
Like a mighty fortress shows."

"In the vineyard you have grown,  
Where the melon plants are sown,  
Day and night upon my lute,  
You I sing, and you alone."

"Sing a minstrel's song to me,  
Or the blackbird's rhapsody;  
All your praises I deserve,  
And my bridegroom you shall be!"
