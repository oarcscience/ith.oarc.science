*Armenian Legends and Poems* \[1916\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have given specimens of mediaeval Armenian poetry; we now proceed to
indicate in outline its most striking characteristics.

The theme of the Armenian pagan minstrels was the heroic deeds of their
country's history. The adoption of Christianity imparted to Armenian
poetry a specific form and tone. At the same time it was the revival of
the old Armenian valour, which, strengthened by the circumstances in
which the Armenians lived, produced a religious poetry of great purity
of feeling, and of a depth and solemnity unequalled by any other poetry
of this class.

In the Middle Ages, the poetry gave expression to the love and other
emotions of the Armenian poets.

A new poetry of the now Mohammedan Persia written in modern Persian came
into being almost simultaneously with the Armenian poetry of the Middle
Ages.

Firdusi, Omar Khayyam, Sadi, Hafiz, with a splendid retinue of less
famed singers, made Persian the language of verse which, together with
Arabic poetry in its earlier stages, no doubt had some influence on the
Armenian poets of the Middle Ages; but this influence affected form
rather than spirit or character.

Armenian mediaeval poetry does not possess the burning hues of oriental
verse, and is

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

perhaps less luxurious, but the grace, charm, ease, and fancy of the
Armenian lays are inimitable, and their originality and occasional
quaintness are so marked that one feels there is a magic in them. These
characteristics are the outcome of the mutual assimilation of eastern
and western art, so that the poetry of Armenia, like its language, its
art, its Church, stands by itself.

In comparing Armenian with Persian and Arabic poetry, one must remember
that the Armenians, as Christians, were not polygamists; and that, to
them, marriage was sanctified by the law of God and man. This is what
the great Persian poet Sadi says of women: "Choose a fresh wife every
spring, or every New Year's day, for the almanac of last year is good
for nothing." It would have been impossible for any Armenian poet to
entertain such an idea as that.

Whereas women are so cheap in the eyes of the Persian poet, Armenian
girls endowed with beauty were considered by their parents and the
community very precious possessions, to be zealously guarded, as they
were in constant danger of attracting the attention of their Mohammedan
lords and being forcibly carried off into harems. This fact had the
effect of mingling compassion with the Armenian poets' admiration of a
girl's beauty and made them write more feelingly of women.

It must also be remembered that, whereas Mohammedanism looks upon woman
as a soulless being, in the eyes of a Christian she possesses a soul as
precious as that of a man.

It is an interesting fact that love poems were written by the clergy,
often by ecclesiastics of high position, who, by the law of the Armenian
Church, are vowed to celibacy. One explanation of this is that they were
born poets, and only regarded love as one among many feelings fitted to
be the subject of verse. Their use of the first person is only dramatic.

There are also many folksongs which differ, in style and character, from
the love-songs of poets. The spirit of these songs is that of Armenian
pagan poems. The following is an example of songs of this class. It
describes the adventure of a girl.

     "I beheld a youth to-day  
As at dawn I walked unheeding,  
     And the youth stopped on his way,  
Struck my cheek, and left it bleeding.  
     Then my mother questioned me,  
'Who was it that struck you?' saying,  
     '’Twas a thorn, as near the tree  
With the roses I was playing.'  
     'May the tree turn dry and sear  
Which thy pretty cheek left bleeding!

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

     'Mother, dear, oh, do not speak,  
’Twas a youth that stopped to kiss it.  
     ’Twas for luck he kissed my cheek,  
If thou curse him he will miss it!'"

Armenian religious and devotional poetry has characteristics of its own.
This class of literature falls into two divisions. In the first division
are works of a purely literary character written in old Armenian; in the
second, works meant for popular use, written in the language of the
people. These latter are written in a more familiar style, proverbs and
paraphrases being often introduced, in a picturesque fashion, which
appeals to the unlearned.

As an example of the popular class of literature we give an extract from
a poem about Gregory the Illuminator, who was cast by King Tiridates
into a well infested with serpents and other loathsome creatures:--

"'Take the saint and put him into the prison where dragon-serpents are
assembled.'  
  They took the saint and put him in the prison where the
dragon-serpents were assembled.  
  And the poisonous serpents inclined their tongues in worship.  
  And said: 'Pity us, O Saint Gregory, and hearken to the complaint of
us, dragon-serpents.  
  It is many thousands of years since we drank water from the springs;  
  We have not drunk water from the springs, but only the blood of
condemned men.  
  We have eaten no green herbs, but only the flesh of the condemned.'"

The poet goes on to tell how St. Gregory when he came out of the well
set free the dragon-serpents in answer to their prayer.

This poem is very old, being written in the fifth or sixth century at
the latest. The metre is that of the pagan poets.

We cite here another poem of this class--an allegorical description of
Christ on the Cross

"A little Bird I saw--a peerless One  
 Upon the four-armed Sign, that peer hath none.  
 O Peerless One, who is like Thee, Thou Peerless One?  
               Thou alone.

"Its silvery wings were of a matchless white  
 More brilliant than the sun's clear, matchless light.  
 O Matchless One, who is like Thee, Thou Matchless One?  
               Thou alone.

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

"Piteous Its voice--a great, transcendent sigh;  
 Mighty, as Gabriel's transcendent cry.  
 Transcendent One, who is like Thee, Transcendent One?  
               Thou alone.

"Within Its eyes, gem-like, unrivalled tears;  
 Surpassing those the morn unrivalled wears;  
 Unrivalled One, who is like Thee, Unrivalled One?  
               Thou alone."

A characteristic species of Armenian poetry is the lullaby. There are
hundreds of old Armenian cradle-songs which are still sung by mothers to
their infants, and they are exquisitely dainty and sweet.

Here are some stanzas from one of these songs:--

     "Thou art lovely, feet and all,  
Whom wouldst have to be thy playmate?  
     Hush, the silver moon I'll call--  
The bright star to be thy playmate.

"Crimson rose and petals wide,  
 Thou hast bloomed, our garden's pride.  
 As many suns shine on thy years  
 As the leaves our garden bears.

"*Oror*, hush, the deer are here,  
 The deer have come from the hills so high,  
 Have brought sweet sleep to my baby dear,  
 And filled it in his deep, deep eye."

There are series of Armenian folksongs for every event in life--birth,
marriage, death, and so on.

The following is a folksong of death, being the lament of a mother over
her dead son:--

     "As to-night I walked alone  
To the earth my ear inclining,  
     From the ground I heard a moan,--  
My son's voice I heard repining.  
     'Do not leave me in the ground,  
With the serpents round me crawling.

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

     "Food in plenty we have found,"  
To their young ones they are calling,  
     "From his ribs we'll gnaw the flesh,  
     From his eyes drink water fresh."'  
     All the night I found no rest,  
     I cried out, 'Give me a knife,  
     I will plunge it in my breast,  
     I will have no more of life!'"

Yet another feature of the literature of this period is the contemporary
history in verse. We come across metrical narratives of great events
written by those who experienced them. There is a long and vivid
description in verse, by an eye-witness, of the siege of Constantinople.
The poet is Abraham Vardapet.

There are also agricultural and craft songs, which are sung by workmen
over their labour.

These songs are adapted to the movements necessitated by each
occupation.

Another marked difference between Armenian and Mohammedan literature is
that Armenians are entirely free from the fatalism which is a
distinctive feature of the Mohammedan view of life.

Sadi relates, in his *Gulistan*, the story of a fisherman that gives the
Mohammedan conception of Fate. This fisherman had caught a fish which
his strength did not allow him to drag to shore. Fearing to be drawn
into the river himself, he abandoned his line, and the fish swam away
with the bait in his mouth. His companions mocked him, and he replied:
"What could I do? This animal escaped because his last hour, fixed by
fate, was not yet come. Fate governs all, and the fisherman cannot
overcome it more than another, nor can he catch fish, if fate is against
him, even in the Tigris. The fish itself, *even though dry*, would not
die, if it were the will of fate to preserve its life." The poet adds:
"O man! why shouldst thou fear? If thy hour is not come, in vain would
thy enemy rush against thee with his lance in rest: his arms and his
feet would be tied by fate, and the arrow would be turned away, though
in the hands of the most expert archer."

The spirit of Armenian poetry is neither despondent nor fatalistic. Its
songs are of dawn, of spring, of sunrise, of struggle; not of sunset.
And perhaps this clinging to hope and this desire to live is the only
secret of the survival of the Armenian nation. Armenian poetry is the
product of dwellers in a hill country. To them mountains, deep valleys,
clear skies, running brooks are familiar every-day companions.

This brings us down to the Renaissance of Armenian literature which took
place almost simultaneously in Russia and Turkey, but the field of
modern Armenian literature is such a

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

wide one that we cannot attempt an analysis of it here. There are,
however, some examples of modern Armenian poetry in this volume.
