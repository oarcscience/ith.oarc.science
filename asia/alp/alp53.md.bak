### "THY VOICE IS SWEET"

##### BY SAYAT NOVA

THY voice is soft, thy speech all sweetness flows;  
May he protect who hath thy heart, my love!  
Thy waist is the gazelle's, thy hue the rose,  
Brocade from Franguistan thou art, my love!

If I compare thee to brocade, ’twill fray;  
If to a plane-tree, ’twill be felled one day;  
All girls are likened to gazelles thou’lt say--  
How then shall I describe thee truly, love?

The violet is wild, and low of birth;  
Rubies are stones, for all their priceless worth:  
The moon itself is made of rocks and earth--  
All flame, thou shinest like the sun, my love.

Thy door I seek as pilgrims seek a shrine:  
Thine eyes are roses, new-blown eglantine;  
Thy tongue a pen, thy hands like paper fine,  
A flower fresh from the sea thou art, my love!

Within my soul thy hand has placed love's seed;  
Thy wiles and coyness make my heart to bleed:  
Thy Sayat Nova thou hast slain indeed,  
Thine evil fate he bears for thee, my love.
