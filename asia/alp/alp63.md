### SPRING

##### BY MUGGURDICH BESHIGTASHLIAN

(1829-1868)

O LITTLE breeze, how fresh and sweet  
Thou blowest in the morning air!  
Upon the flowers caressingly,  
And on the gentle maiden's hair.  
But not my country's breath thou art:  
Blow elsewhere, come not near my heart!

O little bird among the trees,  
The sweetness of thy joyful voice  
Entrances all the Hours of Love,  
And makes the listening woods rejoice.  
But not my country's bird thou art:  
Sing elsewhere, come not near my heart!

How peacefully thou murmurest,  
O gentle, limpid little brook;  
Within thy mirror crystal-bright  
The rose and maiden bend to look.  
But not my country's brook thou art:  
Flow elsewhere--come not near my heart!

Although Armenia's breeze and bird  
Above a land of ruins fly;  
Although through mourning cypress groves  
Armenia's turbid stream flows by,--  
They are the sighing of her heart,  
And never shall from mine depart!
