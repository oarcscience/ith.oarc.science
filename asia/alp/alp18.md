### THE FOX, THE WOLF, AND THE BEAR

##### FOLK SONG

THE little fox, the wolf and bear made peace;  
Like kinsfolk all, they bade their warfare cease.  
The fox they consecrate a hermit now;--  
False monk, false hermit, false recluse's vow!

The little fox a sack found in the street  
Through which he thrust his head; then shod his feet  
With iron shoes, and got a staff, I trow--  
False monk, false hermit, false recluse's vow!

The fox has sent the wolf to fetch the bear.  
"For him," he said, "I live this life of care;  
Yet never hath he sent me aught to eat:--  
Sore are my knees with walking, sore my feet!"

At morning dawn forth to the hunt they creep;  
A ram they catch, a lambkin and a sheep.  
Holy dispenser is the wolf proclaimed--  
Unjust dispenser, judge unwisely named!

He gives the sheep as portion to the bear;  
The lambkin falls to the poor hermit's share.  
"The ram for me," he said, "I'm tired and lamed"--  
Unjust dispenser, judge unwisely named!

The bear was wroth, and turned him round about,  
And with one blow the wolf's two eyes put out.  
"That sheep for me, a bear so great and famed?  
Unjust dispenser, judge unwisely named!"

The little fox is sore afraid, and sees  
A trap laid ready with a piece of cheese.  
"O uncle, see, I've built a convent here,"  
He said, "a place of rest, a place of prayer!"

The bear stretched out his paw for the repast,  
The trap upon his neck closed hard and fast.  
"Help me, my little nephew, for I fear  
This is no convent, ’tis no house of prayer!"

The little fox with joy beheld the whole  
And sang a mass for his great uncle's soul.  
"The wrong thou didst the wolf has brought thee there;  
It is a house of rest, a house of prayer!"

O sovereign Justice, much thou pleasest me--  
Who wrongs another soon shall cease to be.  
And fasting in the trap must lie the bear,--  
For ’tis a house of rest, a house of prayer!"
