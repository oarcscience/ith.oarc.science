*Armenian Legends and Poems* \[1916\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the end of the fourth century (374-383), Nerses the Great was
Catholicos. During these ten years he displayed great energy. Under his
rule, many councils were held and many regulations drawn up to safeguard
the morals of the people. In addition to this, a number of schools,
hospitals, orphanages, almshouses, and other charitable institutions
arose under his supervision. A contemporary historian says that during
Nerses’ term of office, upwards of 2000 abbeys and monasteries were
built. These religious houses served as centres, not only of religious
life, but also of learning, where numerous ecclesiastics and teachers
were trained. This intellectual movement, which was of a purely
religious and educational character, not merely lived through the
political tempest of those times, but gradually grew and progressed. In
the year 400, the representative of the Arsacid dynasty on the throne
was Vramshapuh, an able monarch, who, being himself a lover of peace,
did much to encourage and foster the intellectual movement and to keep
the country free from foreign foes and internal dissensions. King
Vramshapuh reigned twenty-one years and it was, approximately, these
years that constituted what is called "the Golden Age of Armenian
literature."

St. Sahak (353-439), who, with St. Mesrop, was the moving spirit of the
intellectual movement, was Catholicos during part of this period.

The Golden Period was of short duration, only lasting twenty-five years,
but it was rich in achievements. The students educated abroad on their
return originated a new literature, pervaded by Christian ideas. They
considered themselves as torch-bearers in the new movement, and all
their work is animated by inspiration.

This period is one of marvellous activity. The new national alphabet had
charms that wrought like magic and, coupled with the new religion of
hope, captivated all Armenian hearts. Armenians realised that it was a
religion for the people, not merely for the great and powerful. All over
Armenia national schools were opened. Nearly every book of importance
written in Greek and Syriac was translated into Armenian, as well as
some of the Latin authors. Translation was a recognised profession, and
"translator" was a title of honour, like the European "doctor." There
are upwards of fifty chronicles and histories written in ancient
Armenian, which is richer in literature than the Greek of the same
period, and the Armenian language is so flexible and so well adapted to
the exact rendering of every kind of literature that if, for instance,
the Anabasis of Xenophon were lost, it might be reproduced in Greek,
almost word for word, from the Armenian version. Among the writings
which now survive only in Armenian, the originals having been lost, are
the *Homilies* of St. John Chrysostom, two works of Philo on Providence,
together with some of his Biblical commentaries, the *Chronicle* of
Eusebius, the works of St. Ephrem and others.

Besides translations, Armenia produced, during the period with which we
are concerned, original works, chiefly of an historical character. These
give very succinct accounts of the Persian and Mongol invasions, and
throw fresh light on the state of the East during the Middle Ages. As
these works lie outside our present subject, we cannot here even name
their authors. Those who wish to investigate them are referred to what
we have written elsewhere. <span id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_37.md)

What is most remarkable is that, at the very beginning of the
intellectual movement, when the alphabet had just been formed, the
literary language is so highly developed, so rich and subtle, that it is
more like a language which is the product of centuries of culture. This
very fact shows that culture was no novelty in Armenia. The new movement
only introduced a fresh era in Armenian civilisation.

Twenty-five years after the introduction of the Armenian alphabet, the
Arsacid dynasty

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

fell (428), the last king being Artashir III. From this time the
Armenians have ceased to be politically independent.

From 432 onwards, the greater part of Armenia was governed by Persian
satraps. The Persians regarded with great apprehension the adoption of
Christianity in Armenia, as this caused the Armenians to enter into
closer relations with the Greeks. As a matter of fact, at the end of the
fourth century, the Greeks came to aid the Armenians in driving away the
Persians. It was the aim of the Persians to eradicate Christianity from
Armenia. In order to further this object, they declared war on the Greek
Empire. The latter, instead of fighting, made peace with the Persians,
accepting very humiliating terms. The Armenians were left to their fate,
but, nevertheless, they resolved to stand up for their religion against
the Persian monarch, who led a great army against them with the
intention of enforcing Zoroastrianism. At this time there was no
Armenian king. The majority of the remaining princes and nobles,
however, formed a regular army, the people gladly serving as volunteers,
though there was a very small party, led by Prince Vasak Suni, that were
inclined, for political reasons, to entertain the Persian proposals.

All this took place between 449 and 454. The first religious war (451)
is known as *Vardanantz*, because Vardan Mamikonian, who was the
commander-in-chief of the Armenian army of defence, was the moving
spirit in the struggle of Armenian Christianity against the religion of
Persia. He fell in the battle of Avarair, but his fame survived him and
he is the most beloved of Armenian heroes.

This war, though it crushed the hopes in which the Armenians had
indulged themselves of regaining their political independence,
nevertheless convinced the Persians of the impossibility of uprooting a
religion which was so firmly implanted in the hearts of the people.

The first religious war was followed by a second, in which the Armenian
princes offered a valiant resistance and the Persians were obliged to
give way. The leader of the resisting princes was appointed satrap by
the Persians. Thus Armenia won back partial independence, the Persians
themselves appointing an Armenian satrap and proclaiming religious
liberty. The Chief of the Magi, who was sent to convert the Armenians to
Mazdiism, returned unsuccessful and reported to the Persian king: "Even
if the immortals themselves came to our aid, it would be impossible to
establish Mazdiism in Armenia." Although Vardan and his followers
perished in this war, and although the Armenians, apparently, lost the
battle, the struggle resulted in the triumph of the ideal for which
Armenia was struggling--that of religious freedom. This the Persians
realised and never, after this time, did they make any attempt to force
the Armenians to change their faith. Neither did any of the various
Mohammedan conquerors

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

venture on any steps towards bringing about the conversion of the whole
Armenian nation, though they have enforced conformity on a small scale;
they have had to content themselves with political supremacy. The
Mohammedan world has realised that Christianity is a great power in
Armenia, and this is the reason why the religious heads of the
nation--the Catholicos and the patriarchs--meet with great
consideration, not only from the governments of Christian states, but
also from Mohammedan powers; both by Christian and by Mohammedan
countries which have rule over Armenia these dignitaries are recognised
as representatives of their country, not only in religious, but also in
secular affairs. Thus the Christian National Church has been one of the
chief factors of the unity and the national consciousness which exists
among Armenians even up to the present day, and this is the reason why
the battle of Vardan is regarded as a national triumph and is still
annually commemorated. <span id="fr_38"></span>[1](alp86.htm#fn_38.md)
