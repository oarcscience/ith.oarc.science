### INTRODUCTION

SEVERED for many centuries from Western Europe by the flood of Turkish
barbarism which descended upon their country in the Middle Ages, and
subjected for the last two generations to oppressions and cruelties such
as few civilised people have ever had to undergo, the Armenians have
been less known to Englishmen and Frenchmen than their remarkable
qualities and their romantic history deserve. Few among us have acquired
their language, one of the most ancient forms of human speech that
possess a literature. Still fewer have studied their art or read their
poetry even in translations. There is, therefore, an ample field for a
book which shall present to those Englishmen and Frenchmen, whose
interest in Armenia has been awakened by the sufferings to which its
love of freedom and its loyalty to its Christian faith have exposed it,
some account of Armenian art and Armenian poetical literature. Miss
Boyajian, the authoress of this book, is the daughter of an Armenian
clergyman, whom I knew and respected during the many years when he was
British Vice-Consul at Diarbekir on the Tigris. She is herself a
painter, a member of that group of Armenian artists some of whom have,
like Aïvazovsky and Edgar Chahine, won fame in the world at large, and
she is well qualified to describe with knowledge as well as with
sympathy the art of her own people.

That art has been, since the nation embraced Christianity in the fourth
century of our era, chiefly ecclesiastical. The finest examples of
ancient Armenian architecture are to be seen in the ruins of Ani, on the
border where Russian and Turkish territory meet, a city which was once
the seat of one of the native dynasties, while the famous church of the
monastery of Etchmiadzin, at Vagarshabad, near Erivan, is, though more
modern, a perfect and beautiful existing representative of the old type.
Etchmiadzin, standing at the north foot of Mount Ararat, is the seat of
the Katholikos, or ecclesiastical head of the whole Armenian church.
There was little or no ecclesiastical sculpture, for the Armenian church
discouraged the use of images, and fresco painting was not much used for
the decoration of churches; missals, however, and other books of
devotion and manuscripts of the Bible were illuminated with hand
paintings, and adorned with miniatures; and much skill and taste were
shown in embroideries. Metal work, especially in silver and in copper,
has always been a favourite vehicle for artistic design in the Near East
and is so still, though like everything else it has

suffered from the destruction, in repeated massacres, of many of the
most highly skilled artificers.

One of the most interesting features in the history of Armenian art is
that it displays in its successive stages the various influences to
which the country has been subject. Ever since it became Christian it
was a territory fought for by diverse empires of diverse creeds. As in
primitive times it lay between Assyria on the one side and the Hittite
power on the other, so after the appearance of Islam it became the
frontier on which the East Roman Christian Empire contended with the
Muslim Arab and Turkish monarchies. Persian influences on the East, both
before and after Persia had become Mohammedan, here met with the Roman
influences spreading out from Constantinople. The latter gave the
architectural style, as we see it in those ecclesiastical buildings to
which I have referred, a style developed here with admirable features of
its own and one which has held its ground to the present day. The
influence of Persia on the other hand was seen in the designs used in
embroidery, in carpets, and in metal work. The new school of painters
has struck out new lines for itself, but while profiting by whatever it
has learnt from Europe, it retains a measure of distinctive national
quality.

That quality is also visible in Armenian poetry of which this volume
gives some interesting specimens. The poetry of a people which has
struggled against so many terrible misfortunes has naturally a
melancholy strain. But it is also full of an unextinguishable
patriotism. Those who have learnt from this book what the Armenian race
has shown itself capable of doing in the fields of art and literature,
and who have learnt from history how true it has been to its Christian
faith, and how tenacious of its national life, will hope that the time
has now at last come when it will be delivered from the load of brutal
tyranny that has so long cramped its energies, and allowed to take its
place among the free and progressive peoples of the world. It is the
only one of the native races of Western Asia that is capable of
restoring productive industry and assured prosperity to these now
desolated regions that were the earliest homes of civilisation.
