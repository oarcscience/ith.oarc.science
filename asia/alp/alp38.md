### THE DREAM

##### BY SMPAD SHAHAZIZ

(1840-1897)

SOFT and low a voice breathed o’er me,  
    Near me did my mother seem;  
Flashed a ray of joy before me,  
    But, alas, it was a dream!

There the murmuring streamlet flowing  
    Scattered radiant pearls around,  
Pure and clear, like crystal glowing--  
    But it was a dream, unsound.

And my mother's mournful singing  
    Took me back to childhood's day,  
To my mind her kisses bringing--  
    ’Twas a dream and passed away!

To her heart she pressed me yearning,  
    Wiped her eyes which wet did seem;  
And her tears fell on me burning--  
    Why should it have been a dream?
