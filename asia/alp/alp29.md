### MORNING

##### BY HAROUTUNE TOUMANIAN

DAY dawned. Bright tongues of scarlet flame  
     Shot up into the sky,  
The livid heav’ns blushed, and became  
     A sea of crimson dye.

The sun his fiery beams unrolled  
     Like strands of coloured thread;  
Embroidered all the clouds with gold,  
     And blue, and green, and red.

Then o’er the mountain, full in view,  
     Nature's great Monarch rose:  
And from his tent of Royal blue  
     Hurled darts upon his foes.

Eternal foe of Gloom and Night,  
     On high he raised his arm;  
His shield of gold, all shining bright,  
     Sheltered the world from harm.
