### THE WIND IS HOWLING THROUGH THE WINTER NIGHT

##### BY AVETIS ISAHAKIAN

THE wind is howling through the winter night,  
Like to a pack of angry wolves that cry.  
My hapless willows bend before its might;  
Their broken branches in the garden lie.

Alas, my heart, thy love since childhood's days  
Hath wept; thy dream was understood by none.  
Seek not in vain a friend to know thy ways--  
The soul is born eternally alone.

Thou from thy hopeless heart that love shalt cast--  
That child of earth, false, illegitimate:  
Shalt fling it to the night and wintry blast--  
Out in the storm--there let it find its fate.

There motherless and orphaned let it weep,  
And let the wind its sobbings onward bear  
Unto some desert place, or stormy deep--  
But not where human soul its voice may hear.

The wind is howling in its agony  
All through this snow-bound night, with piercing cry;  
Alas, beneath the broken willow tree  
My shattered love lies dying--let it die.
