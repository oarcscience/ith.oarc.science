### INCENSE

##### BY ZABELLE ESSAYAN

(*Born* 1878)

THE incense at the altar slowly burns  
Swayed in the silver censer to and fro;  
Around the crucifix it coils and turns,  
The brows of saints it wreathes with misty glow.

And tremulous petitions, long drawn out,  
Beneath the lofty arches faint away;  
To weary eyes the candles round about  
Heave as they flicker with their pallid ray.

The sacred columns, grey and mouldering,  
Support a veil that stirs with voiceless sobs.  
Beneath it, like the incense smouldering,  
A woman's darkened heart in anguish throbs.

Consumed within the censer now, and burned,  
The incense through the boundless ether soars.  
What Matter was to Fragrance sweet is turned--  
The cleansing fire its purity restores.

Nor shall that woman's smouldering heart be freed,--  
Saved from its cold and adamantine shell,--  
Till it is melted, tried, and cleansed indeed,  
Till the pure flames shall all its dross expel!
