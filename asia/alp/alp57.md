### EARTH AND SKY

##### BY HOVHANNES TOUMANIAN

THE Sky bent down his piercing gaze one day  
On Mother Earth, that far beneath him lay.  
And as he looked on mountain, sea, and grove,  
On hill and dale, he burnt with thoughts of love.

Earth lying numbed and frozen ’neath the snow,  
Sudden awoke to springtime's ardent glow,  
And flames of fire her beating heart consumed,  
While myriad flowers the air around perfumed.

And thus they loved, though never side by side,  
Though Nature willed they should be parted wide--  
     The Earth and Sky.

But when has love accepted with content  
An obstacle When o’er the earth steals night,  
The starry Sky, his vision downward bent,  
Opens his thousand eyes of shining light,  
And gazes on his love in worship still,  
Gazes till dawn, and cannot take his fill.

And as he gazes, all his starry eyes  
Are strewn into Earth's breast of waters blue,  
Which foam, and heave, and swell, and strive to rise,  
Longing to reach and join her lover true.

He, more and more inflamed by passion's fire,  
In all the splendours of the night arrayed,  
Pours in her ear his longing and desire,  
And shows her all his pomp and pride displayed;  
     Towards her turning  
     And ever yearning.

But when he finds his love is out of reach  
He turns away, nor utters sound nor speech;  
And in the dark the tears that dim his sight  
Fall on earth's cheeks in showers of dewdrops bright,--  
Dewdrops of pearl--the tears that heaven weeps,  
And then Earth's bosom swells. Her thousand deeps,  
Her boundless oceans, rise once more to meet  
The far-off loved one; and her mountain peaks  
Like myriad lips rise up the clouds to greet,--  
To kiss their gloomy forms, and sullen cheeks.

And love torments her with its ceaseless fire.  
Her waters foam, and writhe, and are convulsed,  
Yet never may they reach their heart's desire,--  
Restlessly sobbing, ever more repulsed.

    And from her gloomy throne,  
    Behind the clouds, alone,  
The moon beheld it with her sleepless eye.  
And told the Poet how she did espy  
That in the darkness of the silent night  
Earth heaved her bosom up to Heaven above;  
And that the sky smiled on her with delight,  
As they exchanged the secret kiss of love;  
And for each other sweetest songs they sing  
And they embrace each other and caress,  
Like living souls, each other gladdening.

Then on the Poet fell a deep distress,  
A jealous sorrow--for he fain would, too,  
Possess a love as noble and as true.
