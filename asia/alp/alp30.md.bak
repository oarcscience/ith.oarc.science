THE FOUNDING OF VAN  

### THE FOUNDING OF VAN

##### From the History of Armenia,

###### by

##### MOSES OF KHORENE

AND after these things Semiramis, having remained in the plain called
Aïrarat after Ara, went into the hill country towards the south. For it
was summer time and she wished to disport herself in the valleys and the
flowery plains. And seeing the beauty of the land and the purity of the
air, the clearness of the fountains and the murmuring of the gliding
rivers, she said, "It is needful that we build for ourselves a city and
palaces in this balmy clime and beautiful country, by the side of these
pure waters; so that we may spend the fourth part of the year, which is
the summer season, with enjoyment in the land of Armenia; and the three
cool seasons of the year we will spend in Nineveh."

And passing over many places she came to the eastern shore of the salt
lake. And on the shore of the lake she saw a long hill lying towards the
setting sun. And south of the hill was a wide valley like unto a plain,
which came down from the eastern flank of the hill unto the shore of the
lake, spacious and of goodly shape. And the rills of sweet water
descending from the mountains ran down the ravines, and meeting around
the spurs of the hills they hastened to join the river. And there were
not a few buildings erected in the valley on the right and left banks of
the waters. And she selected a small hill on the eastern side. After
gazing thence for a while that evil and hard-hearted woman Semiramis
commanded that twelve thousand unskilled workmen and six thousand of her
chosen men skilled in all manner of wood, stone, copper, and iron work
should be brought from Assyria and all other lands to the desired place.
And it was done according to her command. And immediately a great
multitude of diverse workmen were brought, and of wise and gifted
workers in all the arts. And she commanded first to make the dyke of the
river, of boulders and great rocks cemented together with clay, of great
width and height; the which it is said remains firm until this day, so
that in the clefts of these dykes pirates and exiles do fortify
themselves as in the caves of the mountains, none being able to wrench
even one stone from the dyke.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And when one
looked upon the cement it appeared like a torrent of fat. Thus having
taken the dyke round over much ground she brought it unto the intended
site of the city. There she commanded the multitude of the workers to be
divided into diverse sections, placing over each section a chosen master
of the arts. And under such oppression did she keep them that after a
few years the wondrous rampart with its gates of wrought copper was
completed. And she made beautiful buildings in the city, and palaces of
different stones decorated with colours, two stories and three stories
high. For each one she did build summer-houses, separating the various
quarters of the town from each other by beautiful streets. She built
also wondrous baths in the midst of the city for the use of the people,
and divided the water passing through the town into two parts, one for
watering the fragrant orchards and flower-gardens, and the other for the
drinking water of the city and its surroundings. On the east, north, and
south of the city she built pleasure houses, and planted orchards with
leafy trees that bore diverse kinds of fruit and foliage; she also
planted many vines. The whole city she surrounded with stately ramparts,
and caused great multitudes to dwell therein.

But concerning the far end of the city, and the miraculous works that
were done there, it surpasseth the power of a man to tell, neither can
they be understood by man. For there, surrounded by fortifications, she
did construct the Royal Palace, in great mystery. For the entrances were
hard, and the passages leading out of it like those of hell. Concerning
the manner of its making we have never read a true description, neither
do we propose to weave it into our history; but we only say that of all
royal works it is, as we have heard, esteemed the first and greatest.
And on the west side of the rock--whereon no man can now make any
impression, even with iron--in this adamantine substance she constructed
many temples, bed-chambers, and treasure-houses; and great trenches, so
that none knoweth for what manner of things she made these marvellous
preparations. And smoothing the face of the rock as one would smooth wax
with a pen, she wrote many inscriptions thereon; so that even to look at
it causeth a man to be amazed.
