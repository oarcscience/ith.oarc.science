<p align="center">(1450-1525)</p>  
<p><DIR>O EVIL man, with passions fraught,<br> How long wilt thou strive after sin<br> Enough the ill that thou hast wrought:<br> Repent,--a holier life begin.</p>  
<p>From Adam's time until this day,<br> No soul hath had immortal breath;<br> Thou heed&#8217;st not what the Scriptures say--<br> The sinner's punishment is death.</p>  
<p>He that had palaces of gold,<br> And brilliant cities, fortress-bound,<br> Hath left behind his wealth untold,<br> And lies beneath the sodden ground.</p>  
<p>Who loved to quaff the spicy wine,<br> And spent his life in ribaldry,<br> I saw him like a swollen swine,--<br> A loathsome corpse, unsavoury.</p>  
<p>The man that rode an arch-necked steed<br> And flashed his sword around to slay,<br> I saw him penitent indeed:--<br> Between two wooden planks he lay.</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>And evil wenches, women fair,<br> Who dress in robes of gaudy dye,<br> Who love to curl and braid their hair--<br> Their brightness with the sun might vie:</p>  
<p>They swing about, and turn, and sway,<br> And are beloved of every man;<br> But hateful when Death comes are they,<br> To all who would their features scan.</p>  
<p>Christ sits upon the throne of Light,<br> Rewarding those who loved His Word,<br> Crowning the just with glory bright<br> And penitents His voice that heard.</p>  
<p>Ah, Hovhannes Tulkourantzi,<br> Listen with open heart and ear;<br> Seek out some way diligently<br> To win the crown of glory there.</DIR></p>
