*Armenian Legends and Poems* \[1916\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The period whose history we have sketched (twelfth to fourteenth
centuries), especially the two former centuries, is called the Silver
Age of Armenian literature. The independence of Armenia gave a breathing
space which facilitated the production of literary works. This is the
period of the revival of learning and also the period when Armenia came
in contact with the countries of Western Europe and became acquainted
with Western civilisation.

CATHOLICOS NERSES, surnamed "the Gracious," is the most brilliant author
of the beginning of this period (1100-1173). He was the great-grandchild
of Grigor Magistros, and his brother Grigorios was Catholicos before
him. His songs and *sharakans* are greatly loved by the people and some
of the latter are sung in the churches. He was canonised as a saint.
Nerses was the first Armenian to write very long poems. He followed his
great-grandfather in using rhyme. There is a great variety of metre in
his works. As a rule his long poems are written in eight-feet lines, the
same rhyme being employed nearly throughout the poem. This practice he
abandoned in certain cases for, as he himself remarks, "it might tire
the reader"! He has also poems written in couplets of short lines, which
are the most musical and successful of his works. Some of his poems have
peculiarities of their own. He sometimes begins the lines of the first
stanza with A, those of the next with B, and so on in alphabetical
order, or he uses the same letter for the beginning of the first line
and the conclusion of the last. He also sometimes makes metrical
acrostics of his own name. Of course these contrivances were in common
use in his time. Sometimes he makes acrostics of the titles or names in
dedications of his poems. But these artificialities do not spoil the
poem or give the impression of a *tour de force*, in fact they are so
unobtrusive that they might easily escape the reader's notice. In all he
has written 15,000 lines.

One of his long poems entitled *Jesus the Son* consists of 4000
eight-feet lines. These lines, with very few exceptions, end with the
Armenian syllable -*in*. Some of the songs in this poem are very
beautiful and are sung in churches.

Another of his long poems is an elegy on the Fall of Edessa which was
taken from the

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Crusaders by the
Turks in 1144. This is an allegory: the town itself recounts its
misfortunes and addresses itself to other cities of the world, to the
mountains, to the seas, and begs them not to judge her by what she is in
her present condition, but assures them that she was once a crown bearer
and in a most happy state, but now she is in mourning, and misfortune
has befallen her. As Nerses was a contemporary of the event which forms
the subject of the poem, the latter has an historical value, being a
first-hand source of information relating to the times of the Crusaders.

Nerses also wrote a long poem narrating the history of Armenia from the
days of Haik up to his own time. Leo III., one hundred and fifty years
after the poet's death, asked the bishop Vahram Rabun to continue the
poem from the death of Nerses to his own time (1275), thus giving the
annals of the Rubinian dynasty. In writing this sequel, in 1500 lines,
he said: "It is a bold act to continue the work of Nerses the Gracious,"
but he adds that, knowing that with gold thread embroidery black threads
are sometimes introduced, he consented to undertake the labour.

It is not within our province here to describe the great work achieved
by Nerses in other directions, but he was much beloved by his people and
has left an immortal name as the greatest personality of his age. We
only here record one incident to show the breadth of his ideas. In the
town of Edessa pestilence was raging and sufferers from the disease were
taken out of the town and segregated. It was considered hopeless to cure
them, as it was believed that the disease came as a punishment from God.
Nerses sent out an epistle to the plague-stricken people, offering them
consolation, saying that, in compensation for their suffering, they
would receive eternal bliss. In this letter, he declares that the
disease was not sent from Heaven as a punishment and people should not
avoid the sick; on the contrary, it was their duty to care for their
brethren when they were in distress, and he assured them that, with
patience and right treatment, it was possible to get rid of the disease.

This counsel made an immense impression on the people, as they had the
word of the Catholicos that this was not a heaven-sent chastisement;
they nursed the patients and in a short time the pestilence was stayed.

This idea of Nerses, though it is now commonly held, was very remarkable
in the age in which he lived. Nerses the Gracious is considered the
Fénelon of Armenia. Some of his elegies are perfect gems of poetic art.
One of his prayers is divided into twenty-four verses, according to the
twenty-four hours, one verse to be used each hour, but, seeing that this
is sometimes impracticable, he says that it might be read in three
portions of light verses in the morning, at noon, and at night. If this
division is also impossible, he recommends that it

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

should be read in two portions, in the morning and evening. This prayer
has been translated into thirty-six languages, of which English is one.

An example of the work of Nerses the Gracious, entitled "The Arrival of
the Crusaders," is given in this volume on page [58](alp44.htm#page_58.md).

This is hardly a representative poem and is not the best specimen of the
author's work. It was inserted because of the interest of the Crusades
for Europeans. The gems of his work may be found among the *sharakans*,
which we can say without hesitation will bear comparison with any work
of this class in any language of the world. Unfortunately, it is
impossible to do justice to these hymns in a translation. Nerses also
wrote verses for children, and riddles, both in the vernacular.

In general, his language is simple and expressive. He also composed
short fables, according to a contemporary historian; some of these were
recited at weddings and other festivals.

Mkhitar Gosh was the author of one hundred and fifty fables, marked by
good taste, purity, and elegance. He died in 1213. He is called the
Aesop of Armenia.

The following is a specimen of Mkhitar Gosh's fables: The owl sent
matchmakers to the eagle, asking his daughter in marriage, in these
terms: "You are the ruler of the day; I am the ruler of the night. It
will be better for us to form an alliance by marriage."

The proposal was accepted.

After the wedding, the bridegroom could not see by day and the bride
could not see by night. Therefore the falcons ridiculed them, and their
marriage was unhappy.

This fable is meant as a warning against marriages between Christians
and pagans.

Many of Mkhitar Gosh's fables are very original and have a charm of
their own.

Another famous fabulist was Vardan Aigektzi. His collection of fables is
called *The Book of the Fox*. Several additions have been made to this
work by later hands, so that the book has no uniformity of style and
some fables in the collection are childish and trivial.

This is one of the fables in this book:

Mankind is like three fools. The first went to the tops of the mountains
trying to catch a wind, and take it home, but though he tried a hundred
years he never caught a wind that was as big as a drop of rain. The
second, taking with him a number of servants and a great deal of money,
sat down by the side of a river, trying to use its waters as a tablet on
which to inscribe an elegy, but he could not form a word or trace a
letter, though he laboured for a hundred years. The third tried to
surpass the others by undertaking two enterprises at once. He had a huge
bow made with arrows to match, and tried by night to shoot at the stars
and other heavenly bodies and bring them home, that he alone might have
light, but he could not catch

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

a spark. Besides this, during the day he ran after his own shadow, but
never caught it, though he tried for a hundred years.

The moral of this fable is the futility of human life and human
endeavour. "Vanity of vanities; all is vanity."

MOSES KAGHANKATVATZI (seventh century) mentions in his history some
interesting fables. In one of them, which arose when there was a great
famine in the land, the story is put into the mouth of a personification
of the grain millet, whose narrative is to this effect:--

"I, Millet, was lying in an unknown place in the village of Kaku, in the
province of Shakashen. All the purchasers treated me with contempt and
rejected me. Then came my brother, Famine, and dominated the land. From
that day I went and sat on the tables of the King and the Catholicos."

Armenian apologues and proverbial sayings are worthy of attention. Here
are a few characteristic specimens; some of these are rhymed in the
original, in others the contrasted words rhyme:--

One fool threw a stone into a well; forty wise men were unable to get it
out.

He crossed the sea safely, and was drowned in a brook.

They were reading the Gospel over the wolf's head. He said: "Hurry up!
The sheep will get past."

They asked the partridge: "Why are your feet red?" "From the cold," he
replied. "We have seen you in the summer as well," they rejoined.

Are you the corn of the upper field? (Who are you that you should be set
above others?)

A black cat has passed between them. (Referring to friends who have
quarrelled.)

Whenever you touch a stone, may it become gold! (A blessing.)

The donkey began its tricks on the bridge.

Light for others, fire for the house. (A saint abroad, a devil at home.)

The black donkey is tied up at the gate. (A worthless thing is always at
hand.)

Here is a riddle by Nerses Shnorhali:--

I saw an outspread white tent, wherein black hens were perched, that
laid eggs of various kinds and spoke in human language. (A book.)

Between the end of the thirteenth century and the beginning of the
fourteenth lived, almost contemporaneously, three great poets, all
ecclesiastics:--CONSTANTINE ERZINGATZI, HOVHANNES ERZINGATZI, and FRIK,
who were almost the last singers of the dying Armenian kingdom.

The first of these, CONSTANTINE ERZINGATZI, was born about 1250-1260 in

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Erzingan. From
early youth he showed poetic talent and gained favour from the people,
but incurred the jealousy of his own associates. In one of his poems he
says he cannot tell why his enemies hate him and expresses a desire to
know their reason. Erzingatzi had a friend, a certain Amir Tol, who
lived in Tabriz. Erzingatzi used to send his poems, as he wrote them, to
this friend, who entered them in a book. The poems in this collection
number twenty-two. The manuscript is preserved in the library of St.
Lazare, Venice. The themes of Erzingatzi's poems are--among other
things--the love of the rose and the nightingale, the beauty of nature,
the wedding of the flowers, spring, dawn, and morning. In his love
poems, he throws over his emotions a mystic veil of celestial hue, and
some of his lines rise to a higher level than ordinary amorous verse.
For him, love and beauty are one and the same. He says that one who is
without love has no sense of beauty. He calls his lady-love a breeze of
spring, and himself a thirsty flower, but a flower on which only a hot
southern blast is ever blowing, so that his love-thirst continually
endures. He likens his mistress to the radiant heavenly bodies--the sun,
moon, and stars--but her light is stronger than that of all other
luminaries, for it alone can illumine his darkened heart.

Erzingatzi says that, if he is to have any share in the life of love in
this world, he will be content with one hour of "morning love" that
springs from the heart. For that he is willing to exchange his life. He
prays to God for such love, always emphasising the word "morning."

Among his works is a beautiful poem on Spring, which begins with a
hundred thousand thanksgivings for the blessing that has flown down from
heaven to earth:--

"It was dark and every stone was ice-bound; there was not a green herb,
but now the earth arrays itself anew. The winter was like a prison, the
spring like a sun that rises in the night. Everything is merry and
joyous; even the dew-bringing cloud thunders gently, spanning the earth
with its bow and causing many swift rivers to flow, which, without
distinction, throw into rapturous intoxication all places of the earth.

"Terribly roar the streams that come down from the mountains, but, after
strolling to and fro among the meadows in loving fashion, pass on to
touch the face of the sea.

"The birds sing sweetly; the swallow chants psalms, the lark comes,
reciting the praise of the morning. All leap into life--plants, birds,
beasts with their offspring; they all form themselves into one great
flock and dance together. The flowers have assembled in the garden. The
Nightingale, proclaiming the glad things of the great resurrection, also
enters the garden, seeking the Rose.

"When the time is ripe, she opens, and the other flowers, when they see
the splendour of

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

the Rose, run off, over hill and dale, and, from fear, lose their
colour. The Nightingale is intoxicated with the sweet odour of the Rose.
Then takes place a festival of nature and the Rose sings her own
praise."

The original text of this poem is a real achievement as regards
language, poetical expressions, and art, showing that Erzingatzi was a
master of his craft.

Erzingatzi was also the author of a long narrative poem, called *Farman
and Asman*, recounting the love adventures of a Persian princess. This
was composed at the request of a Syrian knight and shows some traces of
Persian influence.

Another long narrative poem of this writer, entitled *A Girl's
Questions*, seems to owe something to Arabic literature.

Erzingatzi is also the author of many didactic poems. Here are a few
stanzas from another of his poems:--

     "Waken from your dreams  
And behold, you that were sleeping,  
     How through all the night  
They their sleepless watch are keeping.  
     Ever circling round  
By the will of God who made them:  
     And heaven's arches wide  
To uplift and hold He bade them.

     "I awoke from sleep  
And a while I stood and waited.  
     When the long night passed,  
When appeared the dawn belated,--  
     Many stars of light  
Watching stood to greet the morning;  
     Servants of our God,  
All the sky of night adorning.

     "Then a Star arose  
Near the Morning Star, in Heaven;  
     Fairer than all stars,  
Radiance to that Star was given.

     "When the moon beheld  
She bade all the stars to vanish.

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

     All turned pale, and set,  
As she spoke their light to banish.  
     Cleared was heaven's face  
And the sun arose in splendour;  
     Then a Child appeared,  
Sweet the Name He had, and tender." <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md)

HOVHANNES ERZINGATZI (*b*. 1250) was educated in a monastery on the
confines of Georgia and Armenia under a bishop who was renowned for his
learning. He returned to Erzingan in 1272 and travelled to Jerusalem in
1281, in the course of his journey passing through Cilicia in order to
visit the Armenian royal seat, where King Leon was then reigning. By his
learning and talents he attracted the attention of the Catholicos, who
appointed him director of all the schools in the city.

By order of the Catholicos, he wrote a grammar, remarkable for its clear
and comprehensible style and language. He also came under the notice of
the king. At the annual horse race two of the king's sons were among the
competitors. On this occasion Erzingatzi made a speech, which left a
great impression and gained him recognition as an orator. In Cilicia he
learnt Latin and made several translations from that language into
Armenian. He wrote many Biblical commentaries, besides other religious
and devotional works, as well as treatises on astrology; but his fame
rests chiefly on his verse. In addition to religious and moral poems, he
wrote love songs, and lays relating to nature. In his ethical as well as
in his love poems we find quaint metaphors and similes.

As, for instance, in the following stanza, where our poet seems to be
forestalling Bunyan:--

     "All my sins I once amassed  
And sat down before them weeping.  
     When the caravan went past  
With my load I followed, leaping.  
     Then an angel that we met,  
'Woful pilgrim, whither farest?  
     Thou wilt there no lodging get  
With that burden that thou bearest.'"

In another poem, entitled "Like an Ocean is this World," which appears
on page [59](alp45.htm#page_59.md) of

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

this volume, he uses the metaphor afterwards employed in Donne's *Hymn
to Christ* and Tennyson's *Crossing the Bar*.

His love poems are exquisitely fresh and rich.

The aesthetic character of his love and his enthusiasm for beauty are
shown by his declaration, in one of the poems, after a rapturous
expression of his passion for a lady of whom he gives a rich-hued
word-portrait, that the only thing that keeps his feelings within bounds
is the knowledge that, after death, her face will wither and its colours
fade.

In 1284 he went to Tiflis, the capital town of Georgia, where he gave,
in the newly-built church, on the occasion of its opening, a discourse
on the movements of the heavenly bodies. This subject had a great
fascination for him and he treated it in a manner that deeply impressed
his hearers, including the king's son who was present. His discourse was
not a sermon, but a poetical oration. On the prince's asking him to
write a poem on the same subject, he wrote one of a thousand lines. At
the desire of another prince, he composed another poem on the same
theme.

KHACHATUR KECHARETZI (better known by his pen-name, FRIK) was a priest
who was born at the end of the thirteenth century and died about 1330.
He wrote many poems, several of which are of an allegorical character;
also laments on the state of his country, and several mystic and other
religious poems, as well as love songs; but his most characteristic work
is the poem addressed to God, asking why He is unmindful of the terrible
condition of the Armenian nation, and also enumerating the inequalities
of the world, showing how the wicked prosper and the righteous suffer.

"If we are useless creatures?" (he says) "unworthy of Thy care, why dost
Thou not entirely destroy us?"

An extract from this long poem is given in this volume on page
[xv](alp06.htm#page_xv.md).
