### A DAY AFTER

##### BY BEDROS TOURIAN

SLUMBERING darkly yesterday,  
As in deathly sweats I lay,  
And two roses fiery red  
On my faded cheeks were spread--  
On my brow perchance a ray  
Of Death's pallor trembling lay.  
And I prayed and longed for death.  
Then I heard a sobbing breath . . .  
I unclosed my weary eyes  
And beheld my mother's tears--  
Saw those priceless pearls arise,  
Tokens of her love, her fears.  
In her heart what grief she bore!  
And I was that anguish sore.  
Ah, I raged tempestuously,  
That black torrent outward leapt <span

God of mercy, pardon me,  
For the tears my mother wept!
