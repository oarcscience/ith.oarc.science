<p align="center">(Born 1872)</p>  
<p><DIR>WEARY of vainly seeking Happiness<br> In city alleys full of sound and strife,<br> I hastened from the noisy human press,--<br> The labyrinth of this dark, grovelling life.</p>  
<p>I said, "The mountain knows its place of rest,"<br> And clambered up above the level plain;<br> But the bald Titan answered me distressed:--<br> "Dullness alone doth Time for me ordain."</p>  
<p>I left the mountain and approached the winds--<br> Those infinite, proud spirits, ever free;<br> "We are the sighs of griefs that to your minds<br> Must still remain unknown," they answered me.</p>  
<p>And then above the winds and clouds I rose,<br> Soared to the skies, and asked the stars of Heaven.<br> "We are the tears that flow from countless woes,"<br> The answer by those eyes of darkness given.</p>  
<p>Above the stars, in the lone fields of space,<br> I saw God musing, sorrowful and mild.<br> "Father," I cried, "where is Joy's dwelling-place?"<br> He said, "I also do not know, my child."</DIR></p>
