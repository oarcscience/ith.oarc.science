### THE WANDERING ARMENIAN TO THE SWALLOW

#### BY C. A. DODOCHIAN

O SWALLOW, gentle swallow,  
     Thou lovely bird of spring!  
Say, whither art thou flying  
     So swift on gleaming wing?

Fly to my birthplace, Ashdarag,  
     The spot I love the best;  
Beneath my father's roof-tree,  
     O swallow, build thy nest.

There dwells afar my father,  
     A mournful man and grey,  
Who for his only son's return  
     Waits vainly, day by day.

If thou shouldst chance to see him,  
     Greet him with love from me;  
Bid him sit down and mourn with tears  
     His son's sad destiny.

In poverty and loneliness,  
     Tell him, my days are passed:  
My life is only half a life,  
     My tears are falling fast.

To me, amid bright daylight,  
     The sun is dark at noon;  
To my wet eyes at midnight  
     Sleep comes not, late or soon.

Tell him that, like a beauteous flower  
     Smit by a cruel doom,  
Uprooted from my native soil,  
     I wither ere my bloom.

Fly on swift wing, dear swallow,  
     Across the quickening earth,  
And seek in fair Armenia  
     The village of my birth!

                     *Translated by Alice Stone Blackwell*.
