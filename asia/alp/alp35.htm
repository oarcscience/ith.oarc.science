<p><DIR>THE wind is howling through the winter night,<br> Like to a pack of angry wolves that cry.<br> My hapless willows bend before its might;<br> Their broken branches in the garden lie.</p>  
<p>Alas, my heart, thy love since childhood's days<br> Hath wept; thy dream was understood by none.<br> Seek not in vain a friend to know thy ways--<br> The soul is born eternally alone.</p>  
<p>Thou from thy hopeless heart that love shalt cast--<br> That child of earth, false, illegitimate:<br> Shalt fling it to the night and wintry blast--<br> Out in the storm--there let it find its fate.</p>  
<p>There motherless and orphaned let it weep,<br> And let the wind its sobbings onward bear<br> Unto some desert place, or stormy deep--<br> But not where human soul its voice may hear.</p>  
<p>The wind is howling in its agony<br> All through this snow-bound night, with piercing cry;<br> Alas, beneath the broken willow tree<br> My shattered love lies dying--let it die.</DIR></p>
