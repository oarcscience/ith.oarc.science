### THE TEARS OF ARAXES

##### BY RAPHAEL PATKANIAN

I WALK by Mother Arax  
     With faltering steps and slow,  
And memories of past ages  
     Seek in the waters' flow.

But they run dark and turbid,  
     And beat upon the shore  
In grief and bitter sorrow,  
     Lamenting evermore.

"Araxes! with the fishes  
     Why dost not dance in glee?  
The sea is still far distant,  
     Yet thou art sad, like me.

"From thy proud eyes, O Mother,  
     Why do the tears downpour?  
Why dost thou haste so swiftly  
     Past thy familiar shore?

"Make not thy current turbid;  
     Flow calm and joyously.  
Thy youth is short, fair river;  
     Thou soon wilt reach the sea.

"Let sweet rose-hedges brighten  
     Thy hospitable shore,  
And nightingales among them  
     Till morn their music pour.

"Let ever-verdant willows  
     Lave in thy waves their feet,  
And with their bending branches  
     Refresh the noonday heat.

"Let shepherds on thy margin  
     Walk singing, without fear;  
Let lambs and kids seek freely  
     Thy waters cool and clear."

Araxes swelled her current,  
     Tossed high her foaming tide,  
And in a voice of thunder  
     Thus from her depths replied:--

"Rash, thoughtless youth, why com’st thou  
     My age-long sleep to break,  
And memories of my myriad griefs  
     Within my breast to wake?

"When hast thou seen a widow,  
     After her true-love died,  
From head to foot resplendent  
     With ornaments of pride?

"For whom should I adorn me?  
     Whose eyes shall I delight?  
The stranger hordes that tread my banks  
     Are hateful in my sight.

"My kindred stream, impetuous Kur,  
     Is widowed, like to me,  
But bows beneath the tyrant's yoke,  
     And wears it slavishly.

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

"But I, who am Armenian,  
     My own Armenians know;  
I want no stranger bridegroom;  
     A widowed stream I flow.

"Once I, too, moved in splendour,  
     Adorned as is a bride  
With myriad precious jewels,  
     My smiling banks beside.

"My waves were pure and limpid,  
     And curled in rippling play;  
The morning star within them  
     Was mirrored till the day.

"What from that time remaineth?  
     All, all has passed away.  
Which of my prosperous cities  
     Stands near my waves to-day?

"Mount Ararat doth pour me,  
     As with a mother's care,  
From out her sacred bosom  
     Pure water, cool and fair.

"Shall I her holy bounty  
     To hated aliens fling?  
Shall strangers' fields be watered  
     From good Saint Jacob's spring?

"For filthy Turk or Persian  
     Shall I my waters pour,  
That they may heathen rites perform  
     Upon my very shore,

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

"While my own sons, defenceless,  
     Are exiled from their home,  
And, faint with thirst and hunger,  
     In distant countries roam?

"My own Armenian nation  
     Is banished far away;  
A godless, barbarous people  
     Dwells on my banks to-day.

"Shall I my hospitable shores  
     Adorn in festive guise  
For them, or gladden with fair looks  
     Their wild and evil eyes?

"Still, while my sons are exiled,  
     Shall I be sad, as now.  
This is my heart's deep utterance,  
     My true and holy vow."

No more spake Mother Arax;  
     She foamed up mightily,  
And, coiling like a serpent,  
     Wound sorrowing toward the sea.
