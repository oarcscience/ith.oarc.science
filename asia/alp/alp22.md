### CRADLE SONG

##### BY RAPHAEL PATKANIAN

(1830-1892)

*Mother*

SWEET slumber now creeps o’er thee slow,  
Sweet breezes rock thee to and fro:  
My baby sleeps, so soft and low  
With sweetest songs I'll sing *oror*. <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4)

*Baby*

O Mother dear, thou art unkind  
My sleepless eyes so long to bind. <span id="fr_5"></span>[2](#fn_5)  
Anon I'll rest, and sleep resigned;--  
Release me now, sing not *oror*.

*Mother*

Why dost thou shed those tears that flow  
Down thy sad cheeks with pearly glow '  
Thou’lt break thy heart with sobbing so,--  
Whom wilt thou have to sing *oror?* 

*Baby*

At least my hands and feet unbind--  
My tender limbs are all confined;  
That gentle sleep my eyes may find,  
Then tie me in, and sing *oror*.

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

*Mother*

That tongue of thine is passing sweet,  
Yet with thy yards I cannot mete.  
Thou wilt not sleep, but at thy feet  
Wouldst have me sit, and sing *oror*.

*Baby*

All piteously I raise my prayer,  
I sob and cry, thou dost not hear.  
Thy sweet voice seems to charm thine ear--  
I weep, thou singest still *oror*.

*Mother*

Hush, hush, and sleep, my baby dear.  
My love shall guard thee, year by year,  
Until my rose-tree blossoms fair,  
Then ’neath his shade I'll sing *oror*.

*Baby*

Thy heart is made of stone, I see.  
I wept and wept, all uselessly.  
Now I shall sleep, I can't be free,  
All night, all night sing me *oror!*
