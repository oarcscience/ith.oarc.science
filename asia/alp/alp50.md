### CHARM VERSES <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md)

##### FOLK SONGS

SNOWLESS hang the clouds to-night,  
Through the darkness comes no light;  
     While my lover, far away,  
Line or letter will not write.

            \*      \*      \*

Snowless hang the clouds to-night,  
Through the darkness comes no light;  
     On this lonely pillow now,  
Never more shall sleep alight.

            \*      \*      \*

Like a star whose brightness grows  
On the earth my beauty shows;  
     Thou shalt long for yet, and seek  
My dark eyes and arching brows.

            \*      \*      \*

I beheld a dream last night,  
Saw these haystacks all alight;--  
     They have borne thy love away,--  
Wilt not come and for her fight?

            \*      \*      \*

Soft winds move beneath the trees  
And thy locks wave in the breeze.  
     Whilst thou roamest hill and field  
Sleep my eyelids ever flees.

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

Eden's smile my vineyard wore,  
Flowers bloomed, a goodly store;  
     Handsome youth and ugly maid--  
This was never seen before!

            \*      \*      \*

For the mountain air I'd die,  
For his form so fair I'd die,  
     Now he's far off, for the eyes  
That have seen him there I'd die.

            \*      \*      \*

’Tis a moonlight night to-night,  
Eyes so black and cheeks so bright.  
     Give me but the one I love--  
Peace to you then, and good-night!

            \*      \*      \*

On my finger is a ring,  
Crimson rubies, glistening.  
     He that parts me from my love,--  
Satan to his soul shall cling.

            \*      \*      \*

Long and lone this night to me  
Passing slow and wearily;  
     Passing full of sighs and tears--  
Love, what doth it bring to thee?

            \*      \*      \*

Round the moon a halo grew,  
In its depths the storm-cloud drew;  
     Go and ask them who it was  
Turned from me my lover true.

            \*      \*      \*

Dainty is the frock I wear,  
Bright the gauze upon my hair:  
     Since my love is coy with me,  
I'll be coy, and will not care!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_7"></span>[67:1](alp50.htm#fr_7.md) A great number of these
little poems exist. They are traditional, and are used for
fortune-telling. On the Eve of Ascension Day all those who wish to have
their fortunes told place some little trinket into a bowl containing
seven different kinds of flowers and water from seven springs. The bowl
is left open to the stars until dawn, when the party assemble and select
a child who cannot tell where the sun rises to take the trinkets out as
the verses are repeated. The owner of the token takes the verse
preceding its being brought out as his or her fortune.
