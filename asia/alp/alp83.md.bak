*Armenian Legends and Poems* \[1916\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

We have frequently quoted Moses of Khorene, whose work contains all the
extant remains of the epics and all the information that has come down
to us with regard to these poems. In fact the first book of his History,
as well as the first nine chapters of Book II., consists of summaries
and quotations from epics, together with other legends. In taking leave
of the pre-Christian period of Armenia let us cast a glance on this
historian and his work.

Moses of Khorene was born some time between A.D. 404 and 408. He was one
of those young Armenians who were sent by the ecclesiastical authorities
to Greece for higher education. After completing his studies, he worked
in the libraries of Alexandria, Palestine, and other places. On his
return from Palestine, he was shipwrecked on the coast of Italy; thence
he went to Rome, Athens, and Byzantium, returning to Armenia about 440.
He found his benefactors dead, the Arsacid dynasty extinct, and
Christianity endangered by the Persians. It is said that on his return
he was so disappointed in both the clergy and the laity--being
especially grieved by the ignorance of the former--that he retired into
solitude and remained concealed for some time. It happened that the
Catholicos Gute, while travelling, alighted at a certain village where
he was entertained by the peasants, each of whom made a short speech in
his honour. An old man who was of the company was urged also to say
something. At first he excused himself on the plea that he was a
stranger, but, on being further pressed, to the surprise of all present,
he recited an impromptu ode greeting the Catholicos and ended by
disclosing his identity, proclaiming himself Moses of Khorene. At first
the Catholicos was incredulous, but, on a careful examination of the old
man's features, he recognised him as one of his former fellow-students,
whereupon he burst into tears and held him in a long embrace.

That day was one of great rejoicing in Armenia, and, soon after, Moses
became Bishop of Bagravand.

These Armenian students educated abroad were looked on askance by some
of the ignorant clergy, and, for this reason, some of the former used to
retire and study in seclusion. In his History, Moses of Khorene inveighs
bitterly against these illiterate priests.

Ghazar Pharpe says:--

"Moses, the philosopher of blessed memory, met with much opposition and
annoyance from the unlearned clergy, who called this enlightened man a
heretic, and in their ignorance found fault with his books, besides
performing many unfriendly acts towards him."

After this passage, several pages of the manuscript are missing. The
next page we have begins:--

"They exhumed his bones from the grave and threw them into the river."

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

It is doubtful whether these words refer to Moses or to some one else.

Moses of Khorene attempted to write the history of two or three thousand
years, beginning with dark and unknown ages, weaving his materials in
such a way as to produce a vivid and life-like picture, tinged with the
colours of all the centuries which he depicts. He writes in poetic
language and his style is simple and picturesque. Every event recorded
by him becomes beautiful, noble, and great. There is not a paragraph,
not a sentence, which falls below the general level of the work. The
History is a marvellous panorama, which, as it unfolds, fills us with
ever fresh wonder and admiration. The story of Tiridates is narrated in
such a way as to draw tears from every reader and--to use an Armenian
expression--to make him feel as if the hairs of his head had turned into
thorns. He speaks with such warm admiration of Tigranes that it might be
thought he was speaking of a contemporary.

In the following passage he displays strong feeling, in reference to one
of his teachers whom he found dead on his return from abroad.

"Where is the calm of those gentle eyes, which to the just gave rest,
and inspired the guilty with awe?

"Where is the smile of his cheerful lips, as he met his pupils?

"Where is the hope that enlivened the tedium of weary journeys? that
gave repose in the midst of labour?

"How shall I write my tragedy? and who is there to weep at it?"

One sees by his writing that Moses was a man of strong character, with
firm principles, neither vacillating nor superficial. The reader is
profoundly impressed by his words; they sink deeply into him, pressing
like lead on a tablet, and casting him under the spell of the author.
This effect is due, in part, to his convincing power; it is impossible
not to realise what he records. His statements are concise; what others
would take pages to express, he conveys in a few words. In descriptive
powers he is unrivalled, not only among Armenians, but even as compared
with Greek and Roman historians. His graphic pictures of people and
places, together with his remarks and reflections and his frequent
quotations from the national epics, prove his historical skill and
literary taste.

In a word, as one reads him, one feels him to be a genius of the first
magnitude.

Moses of Khorene wrote his History at the request of Sahak Bagratuni, a
man of noble or princely birth. The History consists of three books.
Book I., as we have already said, is mainly based on national epics and
legends. Although these relate only to a few heroes, the treatment is
very elaborate.

Then comes the history of 180 years, over which he passes very lightly,
merely giving a

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

list of names, with a few words added to each. This shows that, for this
period, he has not been able to find any material in the native epics
and songs.

Book II. relates to the Arsacid dynasty, speaking also of the
introduction of Christianity, and going on to the death of Tiridates and
of Gregory the Illuminator.

Book III. contains the history of the successors of Tiridates up to the
sad end of the Arsacid dynasty. This book ends with a long lament over
the pitiful plight of Armenia. It contains also a bitter invective
against the author's contemporaries--princes, judges, clergy,
soldiery--in short against all who, being careless of duty and
regardless of the ideal, lead the people astray.

Moses of Khorene has left other works besides his History, one of which
is a Geography, containing, among other things, an account of the
British Isles.

For 1400 years, the History of Moses of Khorene was revered and accepted
as the only authentic History of Armenia; and it was not till the
nineteenth century that criticism was directed against it, not only by
Armenian scholars, but also by French, German, Italian, English, and
Russian scholars. This criticism was chiefly levelled at the principal
source from which the Armenian historian professed to draw his
information.

Arshak the Great, according to Moses, after casting off the Macedonian
yoke and conquering Assyria, set his brother, Wargharshak, on the throne
of Armenia. So commences the Arsacid dynasty. The new king wished to
know what kind of men had been ruling the country before him. Was he (he
asked) the successor of brave men or of bad men He found an intelligent
man, a Syrian, named Mar-Abas-Katina, and sent him to his brother,
Arshak the Great, with this letter:--

"To Arshak, the king of the earth and the sea, whose form and person are
like unto the gods and whose triumphs are above those of all kings; the
greatness of whose mind can fathom all things of earth, Wargharshak, thy
youngest brother and comrade in arms, appointed by thee King of Armenia,
greeting, Victory ever attend thee.

"I have received from thee the behest to encourage bravery and wisdom. I
have not forgotten thy counsel. On the contrary, I have done all that my
mind could devise or my skill carry into effect, and now, thanks to thy
guardianship, I have put this country in order. And next I want to know
who, before myself, has subdued the land of Armenia, and from whom are
descended the noble families who are established here. There does not
seem to be any fixed grade of classes; among the chief men, it is
impossible to ascertain which is highest and which lowest; so that some
confusion ensues. I therefore beg that the archives may be opened in the
presence of this man whom I have sent to present himself in thy great

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

country, in order that he may bring back the information that is desired
by thy son and brother."

This Syrian (says the historian) found in the library at Nineveh a book
translated from the Chaldean into Greek, by order of Alexander the
Great, which contained various ancient histories. From this book
Mar-Abas copied only the authentic history of Armenia, which he took
back to Wargharshak, who, esteeming this document his most precious
treasure, preserved it with great care in his palace and engraved part
of it on a stone monument.

It is this document of Mar-Abas-Katina that Moses of Khorene cites as
his chief authority for the early authentic history of Armenia, though
he also mentions several other native and foreign writers as sources of
his work.

With regard to these statements, critics point out that the library of
Nineveh was not in existence in the second century B.C., as it was
destroyed in 625 B.C.; some even maintain that Mar-Abas-Katina was a
fictitious personage, invented by Moses of Khorene to give more weight
to his own statements, in accordance with the universal custom of his
time, when contemporary writings were continually ascribed to the great
men of old or even to imaginary characters. Moses of Khorene, say these
critics, was himself a great lover of the folklore, legends, and epics
of his country, but he knew that, if he gave these as his only source of
information, his History would gain no credence, especially as, at the
period when he wrote, just after the establishment of Christianity,
everything pagan was regarded with suspicion. Moreover, Moses, being
himself a bishop, could not have avowed such a source for all his
statements, though, as we have said, he quotes from the epics and says
that some of the contents of his work are derived from them. It is,
however, generally admitted that Moses of Khorene had in his hands such
a book as he describes and that this book was one of his sources. The
book has even been traced.

As to Mar-Abas-Katina, although his book may not have been compiled
under the circumstances described in the History, Moses may have
believed that he was the author of the book in his possession. Professor
Mar has even found, in Arabic literature, some independent traces of
Mar-Abas-Katina.

There is also some controversy about the date of Moses of Khorene
himself. By some he is placed even as late as the seventh century,
because his writings contain references to events as late as that
period.

But it is not difficult to account for this without disputing the
generally received date of the historian, for, when we consider how many
ancient books have been re-edited, we see

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

how easily the work before us may have been touched up by a later hand
in the seventh century. <span id="fr_36"></span>[1](alp84.htm#fn_36.md)

In concluding this account of Moses of Khorene, we must acknowledge that
he has not only rendered much service to Armenian history, but that his
book is one of the great works of all literature, and, if it were better
known, would take a high place among the masterpieces of the world.
