### MY HEART IS TURNED INTO A WAILING CHILD

### BY N. KOUCHAK

(*Fifteenth Century*)

MY heart is turned into a wailing child,  
     In vain with sweets I seek to still its cries;  
Sweet love, it calls for thee in sobbings wild  
     All day and night, with longing and with sighs.  
          What solace can I give it?

I showed my eyes the fair ones of this earth  
     And tried to please them--but I tried in vain.  
Sweet love, for them all those were nothing worth--  
     Thee--only thee my heart would have again.  
          What solace can I give it?
