### HUNTSMAN, THAT ON THE HILLS ABOVE

##### BY AVETIS ISAHAKIAN

"HUNTSMAN, that on the hills above  
     To hunt the deer hast been,  
Tell me, I pray thee, if my love--  
     My wild deer thou hast seen?

"He sought the hills his grief to quell--  
     My darling love, my sun.  
He wandered out upon the fell,  
     My flower, my only one."

"Maiden, I saw your lover true,  
     All girt with red and green.  
Upon his breast a rose tree grew  
     Where once your kiss had been."

"Huntsman, I pray, who is the bride  
     Of my beloved, my sun?  
Who tends him, watching by his side,  
     My flower, my only one?"

"Maiden, I saw him with his head  
     Upon a stone at rest.  
And for his love, a bullet red  
     Into his heart was pressed.

"The mountain breeze caressingly  
     Played with his jet-black hair,  
And blossoms wept unceasingly  
     Your flower, your lover there."
