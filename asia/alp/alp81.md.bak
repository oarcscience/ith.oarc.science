*Armenian Legends and Poems* \[1916\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the periods which we have outlined belongs the literature of Armenia
preceding the introduction of Christianity. Of this literature the
remains that have come down to us consist of legends, songs, and
fragments of epics. Of the epics we have some records and summaries,
chiefly found in the History of Moses of Khorene (5th century A.D.), who
has also preserved some of the heroic songs in their original form.
These epics relate the history of Armenian

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

ancestral and mythical heroes, to whom are ascribed the foundation and
development of the Armenian nation. In them we see Armenian ideals of
the earliest times. As these ideals are closely interwoven with the
religious beliefs of the pre-Christian period, let us now cast a glance
at Armenian Paganism.

It is said by ancient Armenian historians that the Armenians were
originally worshippers of the One True God, but they, like all other
nations, deserted Him and took up with various religions. Sun-worship
was one of these; Zoroastrianism also had its turn; in due course, the
Greeks introduced their own deities; even India succeeded in making its
influence felt. Strabo has it that the Armenians, during the period of
the Arsacid dynasty, were of the same religion as the Parthians. It
appears that the Armenians fused together Zoroastrianism and the
polytheism of Greece and other nations, thus combining eastern and
western religion. One result of this fusion was that though the
Zoroastrians made no visible representation of their God, the temples of
Armenia were full of images, brought from Mesopotamia, Asia Minor, and
Greece.

The principal god of Armenia was *Aramazd*, whom the Armenians called
"the Architect of the Universe, Creator of Heaven and Earth." He was
also the father of the other gods. The Armenians annually celebrated the
festival of this god on the 1st day of Navasard, <span
id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) when they sacrificed white animals of
various kinds--goats, horses, mules, with whose blood they filled
goblets of gold and silver. The most prominent sanctuaries of Aramazd
were in the ancient city of Ani in Daranali, the burial-place of the
Armenian kings, as well as in the village of Bagavan in Bagravand. <span
id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md)

Aramazd had an attendant incorporeal spirit, named *Tir* or *Grogh*
("writer"), whom he sent to earth to watch men and record in a book
their good and evil deeds. After death, human souls were conducted by
Tir to Aramazd, who opened the book at each soul's record, in accordance
with which he assigned a reward or punishment. In a village near
Vargharshapat there was a temple of this god, where the priests
interpreted dreams after consulting his oracle. The influence of Tir was
great in Armenia, for he was a personification of hope and fear. There
are traces of the cult of this god in the Armenian language. It is still
usual to hear, used as a curse, the expression, "May Grogh take you!"
The son of Aramazd was *Mihr*, Fire. He guided the heroes in battle and
conferred wreaths on the victors. The word *mehian* ("temple") is
derived from Mihr; also some Christian names. One of the months in the
ancient Armenian calendar (Mehekan) was named after him. His
commemoration-day was celebrated with

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

great splendour at the beginning of spring. Fires were kindled in the
open market-place in his honour, and a lantern lighted from one of these
fires was kept burning in his temple throughout the year. This custom of
kindling fires in the spring is still observed in some parts of
Armenia.'

Although the Persians and the Armenians were both worshippers of Mihr,
the conceptions and observances of the two nations differed. The
Armenian sacred fire was invisible, but the Persian was material and was
kept up in all the temples. For this reason the Armenians called the
Persians fire-worshippers. But the Armenians had also a visible
fire-god, who, although material, was intangible--the sun--to which many
temples were dedicated and after which one of the months (*Areg*) was
named. <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md)

Long after the introduction of Christianity, there was a sect of
sun-worshippers existent in Armenia, who were called "Children of the
Sun." A small remnant of them is still supposed to be found, dwelling
between the Tigris and the Euphrates. Traces of sun-worship are also
evident in the Armenian language and in the Armenian literature of
Christian times. Some sayings and phrases are still in use which contain
references to sun-worship, such as the expression of endearment, "Let me
die for your sun!" and the oath, "Let the sun of my son be witness."

One of the most famous Armenian goddesses was *Anahit*, who answered to
the Greek Artemis and the Roman Diana. She was a " pure and spotless
goddess," and, as a daughter of Aramazd, was "mother of chastity," as
well as the benefactress of the whole human race; "through her the
Armenian land exists, from her it draws its life; she is the glory of
our nation and its protectress" <span id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md); and
for her the ancient Armenians felt intense love and adoration.

Many images and shrines were dedicated to her under the names of "the
Golden Mother," <span id="fr_21"></span>[3](#fn_21.md) "the Being of Golden
Birth," etc. Every summer there was a festival in her honour. On that
day, a dove and a rose were offered to her golden image, whence the day
was called *Vardavar*, which means "the flaming of the Rose." On the
introduction of Christianity, the temple of Anahit was destroyed and her
festival became the Feast of the Transfiguration of Christ; it falls in
the last days of the year according to the ancient Armenian calendar;
but the name "Vardavar" still remains and doves are still set flying on
that day. This is also

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

the Armenian "water-day," during which the people amuse themselves
throwing water at each other. <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md)

Anahit was sought also in cases of great sickness.

The sister of Anahit was *Astghik*, <span id="fr_23"></span>[2](#fn_23.md)
the goddess of beauty, a personification of the moon, corresponding to
the Phoenician and Sidonian Astarte. Strange to say, the Persians had no
goddess of beauty, but the bright sky of Armenia, its numerous valleys,
the torrents running down from snow-capped mountains, the lakes, the
cultivated fields and meadows tended to strengthen the sense of beauty,
and, therefore, Armenia had a goddess of beauty, who was not to be found
in the pantheon of the neighbouring country.

The Armenians assigned Astghik a husband worthy of her. He was Vahagn,
deified on account of his valour. In ancient songs, he is credited with
a miraculous birth. The fires of heaven and earth, and the sea crimson
in the light of dawn, travailed to bring him into being. <span
id="fr_24"></span>[3](#fn_24.md) As we shall see later, Moses of Khorene
has preserved portions of these songs. Vahagn was called Vishapakagh
(Uprooter of dragons), as he cleared the Armenian land of monsters and
saved it from evil influences. His exploits were known not only in
Armenia, but in the abode of the gods. Having stolen corn from the barns
of King Barsham of Assyria, he ran away and tried to hide himself in
heaven. From the ears he dropped arose the Milky Way, which is called in
Armenia the Track of the Corn-stealer.

The third daughter of Aramazd was *Nané* or *Nooné*. She was the goddess
of contrivance. It was believed by the Armenians that contrivance was a
necessary power for a woman, because, in the management of the
household, she had to make big things out of small ones, and
circumstances were already against her on account of the vicissitudes
which Armenia was constantly undergoing.

*Sandaramet*, the wife of Aramazd, was an invisible goddess and a
personification of the earth. Aramazd sent rain upon her, which brought
forth the vegetation on the earth. She came to be a synonym of Hades and
was very frequently referred to as such in theological books and in the
hymnary of the Christian Church.

Besides these gods of their own, the Armenians also adopted alien
divinities. When

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Tigranes brought a
number of Phoenicians to Armenia as prisoners, they brought with them
their god Ammon, from whose name comes the word *Ammonor*, <span
id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md) "the day of Ammon"--the New Year.
Assyrian, Arab, and other emigrations also led to the introduction of
foreign deities. An Armenian king, when he brought home captives, also
introduced the gods of those captives, whose images were placed in the
temples beside those of the native gods that they most closely
resembled. Even Indian fugitives brought the brother-gods, Demetr and
Gisanes, whose images were not like those of the other gods of Armenia,
for the images of the gods of Armenia are, as a rule, small, whereas
these were very tall, with long black hair and black faces. There was
also a great immigration of Jews into Armenia, and this influenced the
Armenians in the direction of monotheism. Besides the principal gods,
there were also secondary ones. These were spirits, corresponding to
angels, who acted as guardians to different classes of natural
objects:--*Kadjk*, <span id="fr_26"></span>[2](#fn_26.md) who occupied the
mountains; *Parik*, who presided over flocks; and many others.

Water was honoured in Armenia as a masculine principle. According to
Tacitus (*Annals*, vi. 37) the Armenians offered horses as sacrifices to
the Euphrates, and divined by its waves and foam. Sacred cities were
built around the river Araxes and its tributaries. Even now there are
many sacred springs with healing powers, and the people always feel a
certain veneration towards waters in motion.

There were gods who lived in the waters and destroyed harmful monsters
of the deep. There was also a god who breathed out a mysterious
atmosphere which destroyed malignant creatures. One wonders whether this
is a foreshadowing of the fear of microbes. All the gods of this class
were friendly to agriculturists.

There were also "*Haurot-Maurot*," the name of a flower (*hyacinthus
racemosus Dodonei*) first mentioned by Agathangelos. The Arabs
incorporated them in the Quran (ii. 96) as two angels sent down to live
in Babel in human circumstances.

*Alk*, who dwelt in the waters, was a very harmful devil. He used to
live in the corners of houses and stables, and in damp places. He had
eyes of fire, nails of copper, teeth of iron, and the jaws of a wild
boar. He carried a sword of iron in his hand and was a bitter enemy to
pregnant women, near whom he sat at the time their child was born.

There were nymphs, who were guardians of women. They wandered through
gardens and amid streams, but were invisible. They attended weddings and
frequented bathrooms and the women's quarters in general. These nymphs
and spirits were innumerable.

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Every woman was
supposed to have a guardian nymph. The nymphs were supposed by some to
be immortal and endowed with perpetual youth; others described them as
mortal though they never grew old. There was also a group of male
spirits who were regarded by some as mortal, by others as immortal. They
wandered with the nymphs through forests, gardens, and other open
places. They were imagined as very tall, with features like those of
men; some were half-man and half-animal. Some were called *Parik*,
"dancers"; others *Hushka parik*, "dancers to a melody in a minor key."

In some places, even now, a belief in these nymphs (or fairies)
survives. Many stories are told of their beauty, their marvellous
dancing, and their wondrous music. They are never called by the name of
"nymphs," but are spoken of by the people of the country as "our
betters." Still in some parts of Armenia, in May and October, a festival
is held annually in honour of them, generally by the women in the Public
Baths. They assemble early in the morning and remain till late at night,
dancing, eating, and bathing.

Before the people thought of building temples, they worshipped their
gods in forests and on mountains. One of these forests was the Forest of
Sos. According to tradition the son of Ara the Beautiful, Anushavan, who
devoted himself to the worship of this sacred place, was called, after
the forest, Sos. The priests derived oracles from the rustling of the
leaves in this holy wood.

Besides temples, which were numerous in Armenia, there were, all over
the country, altars and shrines, as well as images and pictures.

To sum up, the pre-Christian religion of Armenia was at first a kind of
nature-worship, which developed into polytheism. There were two elements
in Armenian religion, the native and the foreign.

Besides nature-worship, there was a recognition, among the Armenians, of
the Good and Evil Spirit, but predominance was given to the former. It
is curious that, in the Armenian pantheon, there is no god of evil, and
Armenian epic heroes are always described as fighting against evil
*spirits*.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[128:1](alp81.htm#fr_19.md) Annual bonfires are

Antony (Pliny, *H. N.*, XXX. 24).

<span id="fn_22"></span>[129:1](alp81.htm#fr_22.md) At each festival, the
Armenians had to show what progress they had made during the past year,
in art and in other occupations, and races and other competitions took
place, the victors being crowned with wreaths of roses. When the doves
were set flying the High Priest sprinkled the people with the waters of
the Aradzani--a tributary of the Euphrates--and the people in their turn
sprinkled each other. The customs dated back to traditions of the
deluge--that universal baptism with which God cleansed all the sinful
earth, and the same expression of love and forgiveness is manifested in
the presence of the dove at the baptism of Jordan. See Raffi's *Samuel*,
chap. ix.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[129:2](alp81.htm#fr_23.md) *Astghik* means in

of a fire-god, Vulcan.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[130:1](alp81.htm#fr_25.md) Some say that *Ammanor*
was an ancient Armenian god and not foreign.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[130:2](alp81.htm#fr_26.md) *Kadjk* means in
