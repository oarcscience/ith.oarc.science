### THE SONG OF THE VULTURE

##### BY ELIA DEMIRJIBASHIAN

(1851-1908)

A GREAT black bird like to a great black cloud  
Hovers forever o’er my spirit bowed.  
He is my guardian angel, but alack!  
Darker than night he is--than hell more black.

A fearful-looking bird, with wings wide spread,  
Ill-omened as the Devil, and as dread;  
He hovers round my wasted body, till  
I wonder if I yet have life or will.

Upon his wings no spot of white appears,  
His plumage black sheds horror down, and fears.  
Black are his talons--sharp, like daggers fell;  
And like a hound I hear him howl and yell.

His wide-spread pinions hide the light from me;  
Heaven dark, and earth a dungeon black I see.  
All is in shadow--air and earth and skies--  
He even hides the lightning from my eyes.

I cannot see the paleness of my face,  
I cannot see the maiden's smiling grace;  
Black is the lake, the stars and lilies dark;  
What was that cry? The bird's dread calling!--Hark!

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

I seem to totter on the brink of hell  
And think the evil fowl my corpse can smell.  
I seem to hear the goblins fight with him--  
"Away with thee!--ours is this booty grim!"

But he is cruel, strong, and merciless--  
This great black bird;--he heeds not my distress.  
Ten years I've lived beneath his deadly wings--  
Ten years unceasingly my death-bell rings.

Ten years ago one night it came to pass  
On Moda's rock I sat and dreamed; alas,  
My foe came to me--Carnal was his name:  
He shouted, "Vain are Life and Love and Fame!"

Youthful I was, and armed with Love and Hope  
I struggled. "Oh, my soul, arise and cope  
With this thy foe, and vanquish him," I cried.  
But ’twas in vain, as I full soon espied.

My sun and joy since then are on the wane.  
My foe cries out, "I, only I, shall reign!  
O’er all the universe none rules but me!"--  
Then rose a Siren's voice alluringly. . . .

Nirvana and the flesh held me that hour:  
God was asleep--my soul was in their power.  
Then on the moon I saw a spot appear;--  
It grew, and grew . . . my heart turned sick with fear.

I was as dead. The carrion-eating bird  
Had left that heavenly corpse--the moon--allured  
To earth by me. It sought my bosom where  
The image of Christ crucified lay bare.

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

Beneath those evil wings I hopelessly  
Roam over the earth;--my guardian angel he;  
No more the cross I wear, nor in my breast  
Dwells holy faith; ’tis death: death without rest.

Like to the moon, whether I wax or wane  
Still am I lifeless, cursed with this bane.  
I give the vulture of my flesh to tear,  
And shiver when the name of "love" I hear.

While yet I live he is devouring me:  
I cannot bear this pain--Oh, set me free!  
I am not dead--Love still dwells with me here.  
I am alive--and some call me the "Ner." <span

Ah, gruesome bird, art thou not yet content  
These ten long years my body to have rent?  
Ah, vulture black--black earth and ebon sky,  
’Tis time that I should lay me down and die.
