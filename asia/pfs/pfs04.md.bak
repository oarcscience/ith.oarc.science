### THE PERICOS

Throughout the Visayan islands almost every family owns a pericos, kept
as American children keep canary birds. The pericos is about the size
and color of a Crow, but has a hard white hood that entirely covers its
head. The people teach it but one phrase, which it repeats continually,
parrot fashion. The words are, "Comusta pari? Pericos tao." (How are
you, father? Parrot-man.) "Pari" means padre or priest. The people
address the pericos as "pari" because its white head, devoid of
feathers, seems to resemble the shaven crowns of the friars and native
priests.

I

In his small wooden box  
That hangs on the wall  
Sits a queer-looking bird  
That in words sounds his call.  
From daybreak to twilight  
His cry he repeats,  
Resting only whenever  
He drinks or he eats.  
He never grows weary,--  
Hear! There he goes now!  
"Comusta pari?  
Pericos tao."

II

And all the day long  
You can hear this strange cry:  
"How are you, father?  
A parrot-man I."  
He sits on his perch,  
In his little white cap,  
And pecks at your hand  
If the cage door you tap.  
Now give him some seeds,  
Hear him say with a bow,  
"Comusta pari?  
Pericos tao."

III

Poor little birdie!  
How hard it must be  
To sit there in prison  
And never be free!  
I'll give you a mango,  
And teach you to say  
"Thank you," and "Yes, sir,"  
And also "Good day."  
You'll find English as easy  
As what you say now,  
"Comusta pari?  
Pericos tao."

IV

I'll teach you "Good morning"  
And "How do you do?"  
Or "I am well, thank you,"  
And "How are you too?"  
"Polly is hungry" or  
"It's a fine day."  
These and much more  
I am sure you could say.  
But now I must go,  
So say with your bow,  
"Comusta pari?  
Pericos tao."
