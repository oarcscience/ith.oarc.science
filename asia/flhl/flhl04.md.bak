#### A LEARNED MOSLEM'S IDEAS ON COSMOGONY

KNOW, that the very first thing which Allah created was the marvellous
Tablet of Destiny upon which is written not only all that ever happened
in the Past, or that will happen in the Present or the Future, but also
every human being's lot for ever: whether he will be happy or wretched,
rich or poor in this life; and whether he will be a true Believer and
inherit Paradise hereafter, or a Kâfir and go to Jehennum. The Tablet of
Destiny was made out of an immense white pearl, and it has two leaves
like those of a door. There are learned men who assert that these leaves
are formed out of two red rubies of incomparable size and beauty, but
Allah alone knows if they speak truth.

Allah next created a great pen formed out of a single gem. The pen is so
long that it would take one five hundred years to travel from end to end
of it. It is split at one end like an ordinary pen, and pointed, and
from the point light flowed forth in the same way that ink flows from
common pens, or water gushes from a fountain. Then the voice

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

of Allah thundered forth the one word "WRITE," and the sound caused the
pen, which was full of life and intelligence, to tremble, and
immediately the point began to race across the tablet from right to
left, and to inscribe the things that had been, and that then were, and
that would happen until the Day of Resurrection. When the tablet was
filled with writing the pen dried up, and it and the tablet were
removed, and are preserved in the Treasury of Allah, who alone knows all
that is written.

The next thing which Allah created was water, and then a great white
pearl of the size of the heavens and the earth. As soon as the pearl was
formed Allah spoke to it, and, trembling at His Voice of Thunder, it
melted and became water which, meeting that first created, formed great
billows, deep smiting against deep, and surge upon surge. Then Allah's
command again went forth, and all was still--a great expanse of pure
undisturbed water, without wave or ripple or foam.

Then Allah created His Throne, the seat of which was formed of two great
jewels, and He placed it floating upon the face of the waters.

There are those, however, who maintain that the Throne was created
before the water and the heavens and the earth; saying that human
builders lay the foundation of a structure before they put on the roof,
but that Allah, in order to display His Almighty Power, put up first the
roof, which is His Throne.

The wind, which He furnished with wings, was

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

the next thing God created. None but Allah knows how much wind there is,
nor how far the atmosphere extends. Allah commanded the wind to bear up
the water, in the same way in which the water was supporting the Throne.

After this Allah made a great serpent which lies in a circle surrounding
the Throne. The head of this serpent is a great white pearl, its body is
of gold, and its eyes are two sapphires. None but Allah Himself knows
the size of the serpent.

Now the Throne is the Throne of Might and Greatness, and the Seat that
of Glory and Majesty, and they were not created because Allah was in
need of them, but only in order to display His Greatness and His Glory
Who existed from all Eternity.

Then Allah told the wind to smite the sea, thereby causing great foaming
waves to rise with vapour and showers of spray. By Allah's command the
foam became solid earth which was caused to float upon the surface of
the water, whilst the vapour and spray became the clouds. It took Allah
two days' time to do all this. The waves were then in their turn
congealed, so as to form mountains which serve to keep the earth steady
and prevent it from floating about. The mountain-bases are all connected
with the roots of the great Kâf <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) range,
which surrounds the world like the high rim of a circular baking-tray
and keeps its contents from falling off into space.

Allah next arranged that the water remaining

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

on the surface of the earth should be formed into seven concentric seas,
separated from each other by as many continents, but nevertheless
connected by divers gulfs and straits, and containing an infinite number
and diversity of living creatures, as well as of the nourishment that
sustains them. The seven continents likewise vary in their climates and
conditions, as in the plants and animals that abound therein. It took
Allah two further days to set these things in order.

Now the earth used to rock and roll like a ship at sea, so that all
living creatures were very sick. Therefore Allah commanded a strong
angel to go beneath the earth and support it. The angel did so, and
stretching one arm towards the east, and the other towards the west, he
upheld the world. Then, in order that the angel might have something to
stand on, Allah created a great rock of green emerald, which He
commanded to roll in beneath his feet and support them. Then, as there
was nothing for the rock to rest upon, a great bull was created, and
ordered to go under the rock and bear it up; some say on his horns, and
others on his back. Those who make the former statement explain
earthquakes as caused by the movement of the bull's head when he shifts
the rock from one horn to the other. He has eyes so fiery red that no
one can look in them without blindness. He is named Behemoth, and stands
on the back of a great whale, which swims about in an ocean which Allah
created for the purpose. Beneath the ocean, and surrounding it and the
world, is air, which rests upon darkness,

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

through which in their appointed seasons move the sun, moon, and stars,
created for no other service than to give light to the earth.

It sometimes happens that the sun or the moon is eclipsed, and the
explanation of the phenomenon is in each case simple. When the moon is
at the full, and her light falls upon that part of the great sea in
which the whale is swimming, the monster will sometimes open his mouth
and seize her. He would doubtless swallow her up whole if Allah
permitted it, but he is compelled to relinquish his prey--most speedily
if the worshippers of the Unity make great and loud lamentations, and
offer prayers. The cause of eclipses of the sun is different. They are
signs vouchsafed from Allah, and solemn warnings against sin. The first
that ever happened was to bid men heed the preaching of Ibrahìm the
friend of Allah, on whom be peace; the second, to enforce the doctrine
of ’Isa the son of Maryam, on whom be peace; and in our own days the
wonder is of frequent occurrence to the end that all mankind may take to
heart the teaching of the Apostle of Allah, on whom be prayer and
peace. <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md)

Thus, as I have explained, the world rests upon the shoulders of an
angel, and the angel upon a great emerald rock, and the rock upon the
horns or shoulders of a bull, and the bull upon the back of a great
whale, and the whale or dragon swims in a great sea which is upborne by
air, which is surrounded by darkness. The heavenly bodies shine

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

at certain seasons through the darkness; but what there is beyond the
darkness Allah knows!

Do you ask me how all these wonders came to be known and understood of
man? Know then, that, having thus created the world, Allah next called
Intellect or Mind into being. And Allah said to the Mind "Imbibe
Knowledge," and it imbibed knowledge. Then Allah said to it "Receive the
ability to manage matters," and it did so. Then said Allah, "Of all
things which I have created by My glory and majesty, I love none but
thee. By thee will I deprive; and by thee bestow; by thee will I
confirm; and by thee punish." Therefore also Allah has declared by the
mouth of His Prophet, on whom be prayer and praise: "The wise man is he
who is truthful and patient in his temper; and it is Mind that delivers
mankind from Evil." For this cause Allah allows mind an entrance into
Paradise to discover all mysteries, and He will not punish the wise in
the day of Resurrection in the same manner in which He will punish the
ignorant, who flatter with their lips, and lie with their tongues, and
meddle in matters that concern them not by asking questions about things
which they are unable to comprehend, even though they may possibly know
how to read and write.
