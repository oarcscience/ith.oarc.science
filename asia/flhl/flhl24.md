#### THE RIGHT ANSWER

A CERTAIN sultan dreamt that all his teeth fell suddenly out of his
mouth; and, awaking, was so frightened he woke his servants and bade
them summon the Learned with all speed.

The sages, gathered in haste, heard the dream, and afterwards kept
silence, seeming much embarrassed.

But a young man, fresh from school, stood forth unbidden, and falling at
the sultan's feet, exclaimed: "O sultan of the age! The dream be to your
enemies, and the interpretation thereof to all that hate you. It means
that all your relatives will be destroyed before your eyes in a single
day."

The sultan, furious, ordered the officious wretch to be bastinadoed,
thrown into prison, and fed on bread and water for a year. Then, turning
fiercely on the trembling herd of councillors, he stamped his foot,
repeating his demand of them. For a while they trembled in silence. Then
the sheykh of the Learned <span id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65.md) stepped
forward, and raising his hands and eyes to heaven exclaimed: "Praise be
to Allah, who has deigned to reveal to your Majesty the blessing which
He holds in store for all the nations under your dominion; for this is
the interpretation of that Heaven-sent dream; that you are destined to
outlive all your kindred."

The monarch filled the old man's mouth with pearls, hung a gold chain
round his neck, and put on him a robe of honour.
