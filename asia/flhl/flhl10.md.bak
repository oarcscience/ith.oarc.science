### VII

#### THE DEATHS OF MOSES AND AARON

ON reaching the confines of Palestine the Beni-Israel encamped in the
country near the Wady Mûsa. <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md) One
evening, soon after they had reached it, Harûn pointed out to Mûsa a
place on a distant hillside which looked very green and beautiful in the
light of the evening sun, and expressed his wish to visit it. Mûsa
promised that they should do so next day. Accordingly, on the following
morning, the two brothers, accompanied by their sons, set off on an
expedition to the spot. By the time they reached it they were glad to
shelter from the sun in an artificial cave they found there. On entering
they were much surprised to see a handsome couch

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

to which was attached an inscription stating that it was intended for
the use of the person whose stature it would fit. The bedstead was tried
in succession by all of the party, and when Harûn came to lie there, it
exactly suited him. While he was yet on the bed a stranger entered the
cavern, and, respectfully saluting those present, introduced himself as
Azrael, the Angel of Death, and stated that he had been specially sent
by Allah to receive the soul of Harûn. The venerable high-priest, though
submissive to the Almighty Will, wept much as he took leave of his
brother, sons, and nephews, commended his family to the care of Mûsa,
and bade him give his blessing to the people. Azrael then begged the
others to leave the cave a minute. When he allowed them to return, the
high-priest lay dead upon the couch. They then carried out the body,
washed and prepared it for burial, and, having offered up prayers over
it, took it back and laid it on the bed. Then, having carefully closed
up the mouth of the sepulchre, they returned sorrowfully to the camp and
told the people that Harûn was dead. The children of Israel, who were
fond of Harûn, on hearing these words accused Mûsa of having murdered
his brother. To clear His servant of this accusation, Allah caused
angels to carry the couch with Harûn's dead body through the air, and
hover with it over the camp in the sight of all Israel; and, at the same
time, to proclaim that Allah had taken the soul of Harûn and that Mûsa
was innocent of his death.

Of the death of the great Lawgiver himself there

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

are two different accounts. The first briefly relates how Allah, having
informed Mûsa that the time of his decease was at hand, the latter spent
the few days of life left him in exhorting Israel to abide in the fear
of Allah, and keep His commandments. Then, having solemnly appointed
Joshua his successor, and laid down the government, Mûsa died while
studying the Law.

The other legend, which is the more common, runs as follows. Mûsa, on
whom be peace, had, like Ibrahìm el Khalìl, received a promise that he
was not to die until he, of his own free-will, laid himself down in the
grave.

Feeling himself to be secure in that promise, the prophet simply refused
to die when the Angel of Death informed him that his hour had come. He
was so angry with Azrael that the latter, affrighted, returned to his
Maker, and complained of the prophet's conduct. The angel was sent back
to expostulate and make certain alluring promises: for instance, that
Mûsa's grave should be annually visited in pilgrimage by believers, and
that the very stones of the place should be fit for fuel. Azrael also
reminded Mûsa of all the favour which, during his long life, he had
received from Allah, and told of yet greater honours in store for him in
Paradise. All in vain. The prophet turned a deaf ear to every argument,
and at length, disgusted with the dread angel's persistency, he told him
to be off, and himself left the encampment and wandered forth over the
hillsides to the west of the Dead Sea. Here he came across the shepherd
to whom the charge

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

of Sho’aib's <span id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md) and Mûsa's own flock
had been entrusted when the latter was sent on his mission to deliver
Israel out of Egypt, and he entered into conversation. The man was
surprised to see the Lawgiver, and inquired what reason he had for
leaving the haunts of men. When Mûsa told him, the shepherd, to his
great displeasure, took the part of Azrael, and suggested that, seeing
the prophet was simply going to exchange the burdens, toils, and sorrows
of this life for unending joys at Allah's right hand, he ought to greet
the announcement of his approaching change with joy. "I myself,"
continued the shepherd, "greatly fear death, but that is only natural,
seeing that I am only a poor sinful being; but you, who are so high in
Allah's favour, ought to rejoice at the prospect."

On being thus admonished, Mûsa lost his temper, saying: "Well, then, as
you say that you are afraid of death, may you never die!" "Amen,"
replied the man to this wish, little guessing it was a curse.

When the shepherd had lived out his days he swooned away, and his
friends, supposing him dead, buried him in the place where his grave is
still shown, not far from the shrine of Neby Mûsa. But he is not dead,
for in consequence of Mûsa's words, "May you never die," he cannot find
rest in death, but is still alive and wanders about pasturing the ibex.
He is sometimes seen by wandering Bedû and hunters of the wild goats in
the district around the Dead Sea, and in the wadys on the west of the
Jordan valley, as far north as the Sea of Tiberias. He is

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

sometimes mistaken for El Khudr. He has been seen in the act of casting
himself from a precipitous cliff, attempting suicide in his despair; but
in vain. He is described as a very tall old man, covered with white
hair, his beard and nails exceeding long. He always takes to flight if
one tries to approach him.

To return to Mûsa. On leaving the shepherd, the prophet wandered further
along the chalky hillsides till he unexpectedly came upon a group of
stone-cutters who were excavating a chamber in a wall of rock. Having
greeted them, Mûsa inquired what they were about, and was told that the
king of the country had a very precious treasure which he wished to hide
carefully from human sight, and that therefore he had commanded them to
hollow out a rock-chamber in this lonely spot in the wilderness. It was
now midday, and very hot. Feeling tired, and as there seemed to be no
shade anywhere else, the Lawgiver asked permission to enter the cave and
rest there. Permission was courteously granted. The weary prophet was
not in the least aware that he had asked leave to rest in his own
predestined sepulchre. Hardly had he assumed a recumbent posture, when
the leader of the gang of workmen, who was the Angel of Death in
disguise, offered him an apple. Mûsa, having accepted and smelt at it,
expired immediately. His funeral rites were then performed by the
supposed workmen, who were in fact angels expressly sent for the
purpose.
