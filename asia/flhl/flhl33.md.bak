### VIII

#### SATIRE

ON the mountain-top above a Mohammedan village stood a wely or saint's
tomb, of which the guardian was one Sheykh Abdullah, a genial old man
and well-beloved in the neighbourhood. Accompanied by orphan boy named
Ali, his disciple, and mounted on an ass which he had brought up ever
since it was a foal, he used to ride from village to village,
prescribing for the sick, and selling amulets and charms written by
himself, which were warranted to preserve their wearers from the evil
eye and other strange adversities. He would also draw up horoscopes, and
discover secrets in the magic mirror of ink or by the sand table.

When Ali was grown up, the old man said to him: "My son, I have taught
you all I know. There are few khatìbs <span
id="fr_136"></span>[1](#fn_135.md) with half your learning. All you have
now to do is to become a Haji by pilgrimage to the Holy Places. Then, in
sh’Allah, you will find it easy to obtain a post, like mine, of
honourable ease. As a derwìsh, you need no money. Take my old abâyeh,
this mahajaneh, and the ass to ride on; start to-morrow with the other
pilgrims.

Ali, though reluctant to leave his adopted father, followed the sheykh's
advice, and, having obtained his blessing, set out next day. By the
mercy of Allah he journeyed in safety for many months,

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

till on a day he found himself in a barren plain, with a hot wind
blowing, far from any well or human habitation. He was walking to save
his donkey's failing strength, when suddenly the poor beast stopped,
rubbed its nose against his arm, and died. He could not bear to leave
the body of so old a friend to the vultures and hyænas, so he set to
work to dig a grave. This was no easy task, yet he performed it before
sunset, and prepared to sleep beside the mound thus raised. All at once
he heard the sound of horses galloping, and looking up beheld a troop of
riders. He could hear their leader call to his companions, "Look! There
is a holy derwìsh mourning on a newly made grave. Death has overtaken
the companion of his travels, and he has piously buried him in this
lonely spot. How sad to die in so forlorn a place, where one cannot find
even water to wash a corpse! I must go and speak to him." So saying, he
galloped up, and, saluting, asked the name of the departed. "’Eyr,"
replied Ali, using a poetical and uncommon word for "ass." "Ah! poor
Sheykh ’Eyr,'" sighed the tender-hearted chief. "The ways of Allah are
most mysterious. Do not, however, let this death deject you. His memory
at least shall live. To-morrow morning I shall send men to build a
splendid shrine over his grave "; and, ere Ali had time to explain
matters, the impulsive nobleman galloped off with his men.

Ali could not sleep that night for thinking on his strange predicament.
Next morning, soon after sunrise, he descried moving dots on the
horizon,

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

which presently resolved themselves into camels laden with lime and
donkeys carrying cut stone, driven by a company of masons and labourers.
Coming to where the derwìsh stood, the men saluted him with reverence,
and informed him that they came from the Emìr with orders to build at
once the makâm of Sheykh ’Eyr. Things had gone too far for explanation.
Ali could only watch the work which was begun without delay. First of
all they built a cenotaph over the grave and enclosed it in a room of
the right shape and size. Then they made an open hall <span
id="fr_137"></span>[1](#fn_136.md) with a prayer-niche, <span
id="fr_138"></span>[2](#fn_137.md) to mark the kibleh. On the side of the
hall opposite the tomb-chamber, a second room was erected for the
accommodation of the guardian of the shrine. Last of all, they built a
little minaret, dug a well, and surrounded the whole with an
enclosure-wall, thus forming a large courtyard with cloisters along its
four sides. All this work took time, but Ali, having heard from the Emìr
that he was to be sheykh of the shrine with a good stipend, patiently
watched its completion, and entered with content upon his new duties.

Placed at a convenient halting-place for travellers who had to cross the
desert, the new shrine soon grew famous, and was visited by hordes of
pilgrims yearly. Presents were showered upon its sheykh, who began to
show his wealth in dress and bearing.

News of this new popular shrine came at last to the ears of old Sheykh
Abdullah, who had visited most holy places in his youthful travels, but
could

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

not remember even to have heard of this one. Out of curiosity, he
determined to make the pilgrimage to Sheykh ’Eyr and find out for
himself its origin and history. On the last day of its season of
pilgrimage, <span id="fr_139"></span>[1](#fn_138.md) he reached the makâm,
and was astonished at the endless crowd of pilgrims. In the guardian of
the shrine he was still more surprised to recognise his pupil Ali. The
pair embraced one another with cries of joy, and went into Ali's house
to feast together. After supper Sheykh Abdullah fixed his gaze on Ali
and said solemnly, "My son, I adjure you by the saints, the prophets,
and all we Muslimìn consider holy, to hide nothing from me. What is it
that is buried in this place?" The young man told his story without
reserve, and, when it was finished, said, "Now, father, tell me what
saint lies buried at your shrine at home?" The old man looked down
shamefacedly, but, pressed by Ali, whispered, "Well, if you must know,
he is the father of your donkey."

 

There once lived at Jerusalem a pious old widow named Hannah, who
belonged to the Orthodox Eastern Church. She was poor, yet dispensed
wide charity, and she had the love of all who knew her. There was only
one person in the world for whose faults she could see no excuses, and
that was the patriarch, an exemplary if somewhat humorous prelate. Years
ago she had been nurse in the family, where he, an only child, lively
and spoilt, had made her life a burden with his tricks; and she could

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

not be rid of the notion that he played tricks still. In his childhood
she had had no doubt but that he would come to grief; but at school,
instead of being punished and expelled, as she expected him to be, he
acquired some fame for diligence, and was a favourite both with boys and
masters. "Ah," she thought to herself, "some day they will find out
their mistake."

His school days ended, he was ordained deacon; at which Hannah shook her
head more solemnly, and said in her heart, "Alas! our pastors must have
been struck with spiritual blindness to admit that scamp into holy
orders." Her astonishment and horror grew when, as time passed, he
became a priest, an archimandrite, a bishop, and at last ascended the
patriarchal throne. She felt bitterly the humiliation, when she met him
in the street, of having to bend and kiss his hand, although she could
see in his eye that mischievous twinkle which she had learnt to
associate with his tricks. However, she said to herself, "Here on earth,
naturally, mistakes are made, but in heaven they will be corrected."

Hannah died in the odour of sanctity, and her soul was wafted to the
gate of heaven, where Mar Bûtrus <span id="fr_140"></span>[1](#fn_139.md)
sits with the keys to admit the worthy. She timidly knocked for
admission. "Who is there?" said Mar Bûtrus, looking out of the
machicolated window above the gate. "Ah! Another redeemed soul! Your
name, my daughter?" "Your servant, Hannah," was the meek rejoinder.

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mar Bûtrus opened
the door at once and bade her welcome, assigning to her a place among
the heavenly choirs. Here she was secure at last, and for ever, from her
aversion, the Patriarch.

Suddenly, three great knocks at heaven's gate startled the happy
songsters. Mar Bûtrus jumped up and ran to the window to see who it was.
He gave one look and then, in wild excitement, sent attendants hurrying
in all directions. Presently regiments of cherubs and seraphs marched
down to the gate and formed up on either side of the street leading from
it. Two of the archangels came and stood by while Mar Bûtrus, with
unusual ceremony, slipped back the bolt. All the blessed stood agog to
see who it was that had deserved this grand reception. To Hannah's
chagrin and dismay, it was the patriarch. He strode in amid loud
acclamations, and his eyes meeting hers for a twinkling-space, she could
see that he was still at his tricks. He was led up to a high seat near
the throne, while his old nurse burst into a flood of tears.

Now, tears are not allowed in heaven. When, therefore, the other saints
beheld her weeping, they thought she was one of the damned who had got
in by mistake, and drew away from her. She was thus left quite alone in
a circle of the blessed, all huddled together like scared sheep and
neglecting their parts in the heavenly choir. Mar Bûtrus noticed the
interruption, and came to see what was the matter. Seeing a saint in
tears, he said severely, "Who are you?" "Your servant, Hannah," was the
reply, and he looked up the name in his

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

register. "It seems all right," he said to himself; and, turning once
more to Hannah: "Don't you know that tears are forbidden here? Tell me
why you are crying in this happy place." Then Hannah sobbed out her
story: how the patriarch as a child had pinched and teased her,
objecting to be washed and dressed, and so forth, until she felt quite
sure that he would come to grief; how he had afterwards deceived his
schoolfellows and masters, and the authorities of the Church, and how
Mar Bûtrus himself had now destroyed her sense of justice by giving the
rogue a triumphal entry into heaven. Mar Bûtrus burst out laughing, and
patted her on the back, saying: "There, my daughter! go back and take
your part in the singing. He's not so bad as you think him. And as for
the triumphal entry, why, there are hundreds of saints like you, thank
God, admitted every day, but only once in a thousand years do we get a
Patriarch."

 

There was once a young priest, who, besides committing to memory the
regular liturgies, learned to read a chapter of the Bible in Arabic,
which he was fond of reciting to his congregation. It began, "Then the
Lord said unto Moses."

The first time he read it the people were delighted and astonished at
his learning; but they soon wearied of hearing the same lesson Sunday
after Sunday, and one morning, before service, one of them went into the
church and moved the bookmark. When the priest came to that point in the
service where he usually introduced his lesson, he

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

opened the book and began with confidence, "Then the Lord said to
Moses."

But presently, needing to refresh his memory, he looked at the page
before him. It was strange to him. Then he realised that his mark had
been moved, and began to turn the leaves frantically, hoping to light
upon his own chapter. More than once, thinking he had found it, he
began, "Then the Lord said unto Moses," but could go no further. At last
an old man in the congregation, puzzled by the repetition of this
phrase, inquired, "Father, what did the Lord say unto Moses? " To which
the priest replied angrily, "May Allah destroy the house of the man who
moved my book-mark!"

 

A certain priest had learned by heart the list of fasts and festivals of
the Orthodox Church, with the number of intervening days. To keep a
tally of the days as they passed, that he might give due notice of the
fasts preceding certain festivals, he put in one of his pockets a number
of peas equal to the number of days he wished to remember, and every
morning transferred one of them to another pocket. Thus, by counting the
peas still in the first pocket, he could always tell how many days
remained.

This priest had a wife, <span id="fr_141"></span>[1](#fn_140.md) who did
not know of this arrangement. One day, when tidying his clothes, she
found pease in his pockets, and concluded that

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

he was fond of them. So, for love, she filled all his pockets with peas.
Soon after, the priest was seen in distress of spirit, beating his
forehead and exclaiming: "According to the peas there will be no feast."

 

One day during a fast, <span id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_141.md) a monk who
was strolling through the market came upon a peasant woman with some
eggs for sale. Sick to death of eating nothing but vegetables, he bought
a few of them, carried them secretly to his cell in the convent, and
there hid them till late at night, when all the brethren had gone to
bed. Then he got up and prepared to cook and eat them. Having nothing to
boil them in, he took one of the eggs in a pair of tongs and held it
over the flame of a candle till he judged it done. Presently, as he thus
treated one after another, a smell of burning egg-shells spread through
the monastery. It reached the cell of the Abbot, who at once arose and,
candle in hand, repaired to the convent kitchen. It was empty. He then
went up and down the passages, sniffing at door after door, till he
reached the culprit's cell, where, peeping through the keyhole, he
beheld the monk in the act of roasting the last of his eggs.

Still with his eye at the keyhole, he knocked at the door. The monk
caught up the eggs, hid them under his pillow, blew out the light, and
snored

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

loudly. The Abbot knocked again more loudly and called for admission. At
last the snoring ceased and the brother sleepily asked, "Who's there?"
"It is I, your Abbot!" The door was speedily opened.

Taking no notice of the monk's excuses, the Abbot accused him of cooking
food in his cell. The charge was warmly denied, and the smell explained
by the fact that the candle in the cell had burned longer than usual
without being snuffed, because the monk had forgotten himself and it in
his devotions.

The Abbot then went to the bed, and feeling under the pillow, produced
the sooty eggs. Unable any longer to maintain his denial, the monk
acknowledged his guilt, but begged for mercy because he had been tempted
to sin by the devil himself. Now, the Father of Evil happened at that
moment to be present in a corner of the cell, and on hearing the monk's
excuse, he sprang forward, crying, "That is a foul lie! I never tempted
this monk. There was no need. I spend my days, it is true, in tempting
laymen, but at night I come to convents as a humble scholar."

 

A monk, one day in the market, saw two fowls for sale. It was not till
after he had agreed upon a price with the woman to whom they belonged
that it transpired that he was without ready money. The woman offered to
keep the fowls for him while he went for his purse; but he objected,
preferring to take one bird only, leaving the other with her as a
hostage. The woman refused, pointing out that

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

she did not even know his name, in case she had to make complaint to his
Abbot. "Oh," said the monk, "that is easily remedied. We all go by
Scripture names in our convent. Mine is "’Ufû lina Khateyâna." <span
id="fr_143"></span>[1](#fn_142.md) You have but to inquire for 'Ufû lina
Khateyâna, and I should be called at once." "Ah, that's a beautiful
name," said the woman, "but I have a better one: "La tadkhilna fi
et-tajribat wa-lakin najì dajajâti min esh-sharìr." <span
id="fr_144"></span>[2](#fn_143.md)

 

There once lived at Damascus a rich man, Hâj Ahmad Izreyk by name, whose
property consisted of great herds of camels, from which he supplied the
caravans from that city.

When this man's time came to die, instead of quickly departing, he lay
so long at the last gasp that his friends were sure he must have injured
some one who had not forgiven him. They therefore summoned all his
acquaintance to come and declare that they had no grudge against him.
Even his enemies, moved by his prolonged agony, came to the bedside and
begged Hâj Ahmad to forgive them as they forgave him any wrong he might
have done them. But in vain. The gates of death remained closed to the
dying man.

At last some one imagined that it might be some animal he had offended.
As he had had most to do with camels, it was decided to ask his camels
to forgive him. Camels are disobliging creatures, and

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

these flatly refused to come until a whole day's holiday had been given
them in which to discuss the matter. This was granted, and the next day
thousands of camels assembled on the plain beyond the gardens of the
city. The grunting, groaning, gurgling, snuffing, puffing, wheezing made
a volume of noise that was heard at Mazarìb. The debate was long and
angry, but by dark they had come to a decision, which their sheykh was
to communicate to Hâj Ahmad.

This sheykh of the camels was so huge that he looked like a mountain
moving. Hair hung from his sides like the tassels from a pair of
saddle-bags. At every step he raised a cloud of dust that darkened the
air, and his foot left a print as large as a kneading-trough. <span
id="fr_145"></span>[1](#fn_144.md) All who passed him exclaimed,
"Mashallah! Praised be the Creator!" at the same time spitting to right
and left against the evil eye.

When this beast arrived before the house of Hâj Ahmad, he proved too big
for the doorway. He was asked to give his message through the window.
But, as a deputation from the most noble of all animals, he was
indignant at the suggestion, and threatened to go away again. The
friends of Hâj Ahmad then besought him to have patience, while they
pulled down one wall of the house. At last the camel came to the
deathbed of his master, and, kneeling down, pronounced:--

"O Hâj Ahmad, be at rest, the camels forgive

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

you; but they have sent me to tell you why you need their forgiveness.
It is not for our burdens nor for the blows we daily receive at your
servants’ hands. Those are from Allah, and belong to our lot in life.
But, after loading us heavily and stringing us together by the score
like beads on a rosary, to oblige us to follow the lead of a wretched
little donkey--this it is we find insufferable."
