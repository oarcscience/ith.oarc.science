## The Wise Carpenter

<span class="small">For men there is no hope--except to find happiness
in the worship of the gods.  
                  *Tibetan Proverb*.</span>

ONCE upon a time in the city which was called Snalong lived a King whose
name was Gendong. This King died and his son, Genchog, ruled in his
stead. Among the people under him were two men, one a painter, who did
exceedingly fine work, the other a carpenter, who was also of the best,
and these two men were enemies. One day the painter came up to the new
King and said, "Last night as I was ready to go to sleep, your father
sent an angel out of Heaven to call me, and I went to Heaven with him to
see what your father wanted and found him rich beyond belief. He gave me
a letter to bring to you, and here it is; this letter is about that fine
carpenter that dwells here in this city."

The King opened the letter and read: "My son, I am here in Heaven, very
wealthy, and I have all that I want except one thing, and that is I wish
to build a Hläkäng, or temple, to the gods. But there are no good
carpenters here and I want you to send me up the best one in the city.
The painter who brings this to you knows all that I mean, for

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

he has been here, and I'm sending the letter by him."

So the King, Genchog, said, "This must be my father's letter, for it is
like him to want to build a temple to the gods, and I must see to his
wishes at once." So he called the carpenter before him and told him, "My
father is in the dwelling of the gods, is very happy, but wants to build
a Hläkäng and asked me to send you up to help him."

The carpenter thought it queer that such a thing could occur, and said
to himself, "It must be a scheme of that painter to get rid of me. I
must think of some plan to get ahead of him." Then he said, "Läso,
\[which means so-be-it\] but how am I to get there?" Then the King
called the painter and asked him how he was to send the carpenter to his
father. The painter said, "This is the way. He is to bring all his tools
that he will need up there, put them on a pile on the ground, sit on
them, then wood must be piled around him and set on fire. As the smoke
goes up, he can ride on it to Heaven." "Well, that's all right," said
the carpenter, "but I want to start from my own field." The King gave
him seven days to get ready. The carpenter went back home to his wife
and said, "That painter has fixed a scheme to kill me, and I have only
seven days to wait to be burned up, so we must work, for I want a tunnel
dug from my house out to the field where the burning is to take place."
They got it done and put a few sticks over the opening where he could
pile his tools and sit on them. The

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> King, as soon as
the seven days were up, ordered his people to bring several loads of
wood, each to carry a load and a bowl of oil. So the wood was piled four
square around the carpenter, the oil poured on and set on fire. While
the fire was big the carpenter slipped down in the tunnel. The painter
exclaimed, "Look, there he goes, riding the smoke to Heaven." They all
took it for the truth and went home.

Now, the carpenter had a dark secret room in his house and in there he
stayed, washing himself every day and having some clothes made like the
gods wear. At the end of three months, putting on these garments, and
with skin as white as a lily, he came out of his house and went to see
the King, bearing a letter to him from his father. Thus read the letter,
"My dear son Genchog, it is said that you are a good ruler and rule your
people wisely and well. Some three months ago you sent me a carpenter to
build a Hläkäng, and he has finished it beautifully, and I want you to
see that he has his reward on earth when he comes back. Now that the
temple is done I want the best painter that you have in the kingdom to
come and paint it for me. The same plan that you chose in sending the
carpenter will do very well for sending the painter." The carpenter told
him how rich his father was and of his adventures in the sky. The King
gave him great riches, making him happy for life. And after reading the
letter the King sent for the painter and said, "The carpenter has just
come down from Heaven,

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

and has brought a letter asking you to come and paint the Hläkäng for my
father." The painter looking at the carpenter, with his skin so white,
dressed in such strange clothes, with strings of coral about his neck,
while he was still in his old clothes, thought perhaps that it was all
right to go to Heaven that way, and half believed that the carpenter had
really been there. So he got all of his things together; as he had been
given seven days to prepare, the wood and oil had been brought with some
things which the King wished to send to his father. When all was ready
the carpenter said that they must make music for him as he ascended. So
they got drums, horns and cymbals, and as the fire started began to beat
loudly and made a great noise. As soon as the fire reached the painter
he yelled that he was being burned up, but the noise was so great he
couldn't be heard, so he really did go to Heaven.
