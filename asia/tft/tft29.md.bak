## The Golden Squash. (A Black Tent Story)

<span class="small">The shepherd will protect his flock of sheep and

                                              *Tibetan Proverb*.</span>

ONE time in a corner of the world, high up among the mountains, there
lived two old men who were very good friends. Each had a small garden
patch. One was a good old man, naturally; that is, he didn't have to try
very hard to be good, for his heart was pure, he loved all animals and
birds and was very happy in his little garden. But the other old man
wanted very much to be wealthy. One day the first old man found in his
garden a little, crippled bird. He took it and cared for it, felt sorry
for it, healed it and fed it every day. Then he was able to fly away,
and the old man let him go. He soon returned bearing a seed in his mouth
which he gave to the old man, saying, "You plant this seed--it's a very
fine squash seed, the very finest in the world, and be sure you tend it
well."

So the old man planted it and watered it, and at last there grew on the
vine just one squash, but it was monstrous big. When cold weather came
and it was fully ripe the old man tried to

pull it and take it into the house, but he couldn't carry it and had to
call five men to help him get it in. By and by he wanted to eat some and
peeled off the outer skin, which was very thin like paper, and when he
cleaned it, he found it to be solid gold. Now, he was very rich, but he
made good use of his money and gave to the poor and aided all who were
needy. His old neighbor came over one day and asked him where he got the
seed for that squash, and he told him the story of the little bird. The
old man went home, very envious, and thought he would think up a plan so
that he would be rich too.

He got his bow and arrow and slipped out into the garden and waited
until he saw a little bird light on a tree. Then he deliberately shot,
breaking its leg. Picking it up carefully, he pre-tended to be grieved
over its hurt and tended the little thing until it was finally well and
able to fly away. One day sure enough the bird flew back bringing a seed
which he told the man how to plant and care for because it was very
wonderful indeed. It sprouted and grew and grew until finally when
winter came he had to have five or six men help him carry his squash
into the house. He was much delighted, for he thought, "Now I shall be
rich, too." He could hardly wait until he could get his knife and cut
the skin, but he had no more than broken it when it popped wide open and
out jumped a fierce old man, who said he was sent by the king of the
lower regions to weigh him. He grabbed him by the back of

the neck and set him on the scale which he carried and said, "You are
far too light and no use at all," and at once took him out and cut off
his head.

So much for the sin of covetousness.
