#### THIRTY-THREE

## How the Wolf, the Fox and the Rabbit Committed a Crime

<span class="small">When an evil man gets mad at his enemy he beats his
horse on the head.  
                               *Tibetan Proverb*.</span>

ONCE upon a time a wolf, a fox and a rabbit were walking along the road
together when they met a wizard carrying a pack on his back. The rabbit
said to the rest of them, "I'll go limping along in front of this fellow
and he will put his load down and try to catch me, and you two slip
around behind him, and when he puts his things down, you get them."

Sure enough, the man put his pack down, picked up some rocks and started
after the rabbit in hot haste, while the wolf and the fox got his load
and ran off with it. He came back pretty soon, when he found he couldn't
catch the rabbit, and found his things were all gone. In great grief he
started down the road, wondering what he would do and how he was going
to live.

Meanwhile the wolf, the fox and the rabbit met in a chosen place and
opened the pack to see what was in it. There were a pair of Tibetan
boots with many layers in the soles, which made them very heavy, a
cymbal with a tongue or clapper, an idol

of tsamba and some bread. The rabbit acted as divider and said to the
wolf, "You have to walk a lot, so you take the heavy boots." And the
wolf took the boots. To the fox he said, "You have a lot of children,
you take the bell for them to play with, and I'll take the food." The
wolf put on the boots and started out to hunt a sheep. The boots were so
heavy he fell on the ice and couldn't get up, and the shepherd found him
and killed him. The fox took the bell and went in to his children
ringing it, Da lang, da lang, da lang, and thought it would please them,
but instead it scared them all to death. So the rabbit ate up the idol
of tsamba and all the bread and got the best of that bargain.
