# PREFACE

It is found among the old, old histories of the Tibetans that a female
demon living among the mountains in Northern India mated with a monkey
from the forests of Tibet, and from this union sprang the Tibetan race
of people. The greater part of their literature is of a sacred nature,
telling of their creation, of the formation of the world, of Buddha and
his miraculous birth and death, of his reincarnations and the revisions
of his teachings.

A kind of almanac, a little astronomy, plans for casting a horoscope,
and many books filled with religious teachings and superstitions,
including the worship of devils and demons, are about all that can be
found.

The little stories in this book are told as the people sit around their
boiling tea made over a three stone camp-fire. They are handed down from
father to son, from mother to daughter, and though often filled with
their superstitious beliefs, through them all run a vein of humor and
the teachings of a moral truth which is quite unexpected.

These tales were gathered by Dr. A. L. Shelton on his trips among the
Tibetans, around their camp-fires at night, and in their black tents
high up in the mountains.

Every country has its folk-lore tales that have always been a joy and
pleasure to the children, not only of their own land, but of other lands
as well.

May these stories add a little to this pleasure and enjoyment
everywhere, in whatsoever tongue they may be translated or in whatever
land they may be read.
