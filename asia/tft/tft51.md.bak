ONCE upon a time two women were quarreling over one boy, trying to
decide to which one he belonged. They could not settle the case, so they
took it before the king of the land, who, being wise and of great
understanding, thus ordered: "One of you take hold of the right hand of
the boy and the other of the left hand and pull, the one who gets him
may carry him off."

When he had so spoken, she, who was not the boy's mother, because she
had no love for him, and not caring whether she hurt him or not, pulled
with all the force she had. She, who in truth was the boy's mother,
because she loved him, and fearing she might hurt him, though she was
the stronger of the two, did not pull very hard. Then the king said to
her who had pulled very hard, "He is not your son, but belongs to the
other woman," to whom he gave the boy, who at once happily carried him
away.
