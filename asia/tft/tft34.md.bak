#### THIRTY-ONE

## The Two Little Cats <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md)

foe. But if you have no foe it does not matter about the arrow.  
                       *Tibetan Proverb*.</span>

IN the early, early days a very long time ago, there were two little
cats going after some salt to put in their butter tea, for you must know
that little cats in the early days didn't drink tea without salt. As
they trotted along they met a Handre, and a Handre is the worst thing
you could meet anywhere, for he has great big teeth that he crunches up
little folks with, and horrid big eyes and clawlike hands and feet, so
they were very much frightened and ran on faster than ever until they
met a cow and the cow said, "Where are you going so fast, little cats?"
and they answered, "Oh, we just met a Handre and he is going to come to
our house and eat us up." "Never mind," said the cow, "I'll go with you
and help protect you from the Handre." So they all ran on together. Soon
they met a dog and he asked, "Where are you all going?" and the little
cats said, "We are running away from the Handre." "Never mind," said the

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

dog, "I'll go with you and help protect you." They ran on and met a
crow, and he said, "Stop a minute and tell me where you are going so
fast." "Oh, we are running away home as fast as we can," said the little
cats, "for the Handre is coming to eat us." Then they met a panful of
ashes and it said, "Wait a minute and take me with you, for I can help
too." Then they found a package of 100 needles, who asked if they might
go and help against the Handre. Then a snake all curled up by the side
of the road called out, "Where are you going, little cats?" "Oh, we are
running home as fast as we can because the Handre is coming." And the
snake said, "Take me along and I'll bite the Handre." As they trotted
along they saw on a bench a little bowl of hard black peas. "Where are
you going so fast, little cats?" asked the peas. "Oh, we are running
home as fast as we can, for the Handre is coming." "Take me with you,
little cats, and I'll help protect you from the Handre." So in front of
their gowns they took the bowl of peas and all together soon came home.
The cow they placed by the stair steps, the dog by the doorway, the peas
on the stair steps, the crow in the water kang and the snake in the
bread trough, the 100 needles in the bed and the pan of ashes on the
ceiling and the little cats hid behind the door.

Soon the Handre came, I presume he flew in at the window, and he thought
he would like to have a drink of water and when he went to get it the
crow nipped him good and hard. Then he thought

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

he would make some bread, and when he went to the bread tray the snake
gave him a bite. Then he thought he would go upstairs and lie down on
the bed and the needles stuck him dreadfully. He was getting madder and
madder. He looked up to the ceiling to see if the little cats were
hiding up there and the ashes spilled on him and filled his eyes full.
Then he started to run down the stairs and he stepped on those hard peas
and they hurt his feet dreadfully. Then he fell on the horns of the cow
and she tossed him to the dog, who ate him up immediately, and the
little cats came out from behind their door and had their supper in
peace.
