#### TWENTY-FOUR

## How the Raven Saved the Hunter <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

<span class="small">For a foolish official to speak skillful words is as
difficult as for lightning to split a lump of bronze.  
                                                *Tibetan
Proverb*.</span>

ONCE upon a time there was a very poor man with nothing much to eat and
very little to wear, who made his living by hunting. One day he went out
to hunt and traveled and traveled up hill and down. At last he came to
the top of a mountain, hungry, tired and thirsty, as he had had nothing
to eat all day. He stood still a few minutes thinking and wondering what
he would do. Looking around he saw a valley far below with a cold stream
of water flowing through it. Starting down, he made him a cup of a leaf
as he went, came to the stream, dipped his leaf full and started to
drink it. Just as he was ready to swallow it a big raven flew by and
with his wing struck the cup from his hands. The hunter thought it was
an accident, so dipped another drink, when the old raven knocked it from
his hand again.

Then he began to be angry at the bird, when he dipped the third time and
the raven knocked this out of his hand. He said angrily, "All right,
I'll

fix you," drew his bow and shot the raven dead. When the bird was dead
the man began to wonder why he didn't want him to drink the water.
"Perhaps I had better not drink now, but I'll go to the head of the
stream and see where the water comes from." He went a short distance and
found that the stream issued from the mouth of a great snake, and
looking along the banks he saw many skeletons of birds and animals that
had been drinking the water. Then he grieved greatly because he had
killed the raven that had tried to save his life.
