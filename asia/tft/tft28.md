#### TWENTY-FIVE

## The Two Thieves. (A Black Tent Story)

<span class="small">In the presence of a kind man you are uncomfortable,
in the presence of bad food there is an odor.  
                                    *Tibetan Proverb*.</span>

THERE was once upon a time two thieves, one named Lozong, the other
Adra. They went out one day and slipping down the mountain stole one of
a herd of cattle that belonged to a rich man. They drove this cow into a
ravine and killed it where nobody could see them. They were afraid to
leave the beef and go and wash the stomach and intestines, as each was
afraid the other would run away with it. Adra wanted to stay with the
big beef, so finally after much persuasion Lozong took the intestines
down to wash them. And both were afraid the rich man would discover what
they had done. As Lozong washed and washed and cleaned the intestines he
wondered how he could cheat Adra out of his part of the beef. Adra sat
and schemed how he could cheat Lozong out of his part. But Lozong had
the best plan. He took the stomach and blew it up as big and tight as he
could, got him a club and began to beat it as if it were a big drum, all
the time yelling. When Adra heard him he was very much frightened and
said, "A kä kä, they have caught

him now, and are giving him a good beating; they would have gotten me if
I had gone down there to wash those things, so I will run away as fast
as I can and they will think that he was the only man that did the
stealing." So he ran away as fast as he could, and when Lozong got back
he kept all the beef himself and laughed to think how easily he had won
it from the other thief.
