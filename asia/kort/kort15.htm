<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>Ermine-People were living. One Ermine-Man came home, and said, "You are asked to live with Big-Raven's people." He was telling lies. Nothing of the sort was said to him. They came to that house, and wanted to enter. Then they were beaten severely. They went away, and said, "We are rejected here." They came home and began to talk, "Let us go and live in a cave!" They went and lived in a cave. Afterwards they were caught by a flood. They had to climb upwards. That is all.</P>
