# INTRODUCTION.

THE collection of Koryak texts here published was made as part of the
field-work of the Jesup North Pacific Expedition of the American Museum
of Natural History. Since the Museum does not allow sufficient space for
the publication of all the linguistic material, which naturally forms
one of the most important aspects of the work of the Expedition, the
American Ethnological Society has undertaken the publication of part of
it.

The texts contained in this volume were collected by me between
December, 1900, and April, 1901. While Mr. Waldemar Jochelson, my
colleague in the ethnological work of the Expedition in northeastern
Siberia, investigated the ethnology of the Koryak, I undertook the study
of their language, because my practical knowledge and previous studies
of the Chukchee language put me in a position to acquire with ease a
knowledge of the Koryak, which is closely related to the Chukchee.

I left the Anadyr country in December, 1900, and travelled to the
village of Kamenskoye, on Penshina Bay, where I met Mr. Jochelson. I
staid with him one month, after which time I proceeded to the southeast,
to the eastern branch of the Koryak, and also visited the Kamchadal. I
travelled among these tribes for two months, until my return to the
mouth of the Anadyr, on April 8, 1901. A considerable part of this time
was spent in covering the long distances between the villages, the
journey bring made by reindeer or dog sledge and on

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

[snowshoes](errata.htm#0). Some parts of this territory had never been
visited by any white man, not even by a single Russian trader, and I met
camps and villages the inhabitants of which did not even know the taste
of brandy,--in these countries, the foremost product of civilization,
and the first to arrive. The last fifteen days of the journey between
the Ke'rek region and Anadyr Bay <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0) were
spent in going without a guide through a country wholly uninhabited; for
the Kerek, who have but few dogs, do not go very far from their villages
on the coast, and are unfamiliar with the hills of the interior.

We travelled up-stream along several small rivers that flow into Bering
Sea on the Ke'rek coast, and then, passing over the divide, followed the
rivers that belong to the Anadyr system, and finally reached the first
camps of the Telqäp Chukchee. This is the method of travelling adopted
by the ancient cossacks, the conquerors of Siberia.

All the time that was not taken up by travel, and that was available for
study, was devoted to an investigation of the languages of the Eastern
Koryak and Kamchadal tribes. The study of the Koryak was the more
extensive, owing to its closer affinity to the Chukchee in grammar as
well as in vocabulary.

The Koryak dialects may be divided into two large groups,--the western
branch, which includes the Maritime Koryak of Penshina Bay and also the
Reindeer Koryak; and the eastern branch, which includes the Maritime
Koryak of Kamchatka, and also the inhabitants of the villages RekI'nnok,
Pustoretzk, and Podkaguirnoye, to the south of Parapolski Dol. These
last belong ethnographically to the Kamchatka Koryak, although they are
counted by the Russian Administration as belonging to the Gishiga
district. The eastern branch includes also the Maritime

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Koryak of the villages on the Pacific coast
around Alutor Bay, and those of the Pacific villages still farther east.
The Kerek stand apart, and form perhaps a third dialect, although, on
the whole, similar to the western branch.

The most obvious point of difference between the two branches is that
the sound *r*, which occurs frequently in the eastern branch of the
Koryak and in the Chukchee, is wholly missing in the western branch, and
is there replaced either by *y* or (less frequently) by *t*, *č*, *s*.
The natives are well aware of this difference; and in the tales of the
Penshina Koryak, as may be seen from the texts, the use of *r* in the
pronunciation of certain words is ascribed to evil spirits.

The inhabitants of villages on the rivers Vi'rnIk, Poqa'č, and Opu'ka,
(i. e., between the Alutor Koryak and the Ke'rek), explained to me that,
though leading the settled life of sea-hunters, they belong by origin to
the Reindeer Koryak. In proof of this they pointed to their
pronunciation. They said, "We say *yaya'ña* (HOUSE), and the Alutor
people say *rara'ña*."

Instead of the classification "western and eastern groups," we might
just as well have said "northern and southern groups;" but I prefer the
former designation, because the pronunciation of the eastern branch is
nearer to that of the Chukchee, who live to the east.

The Koryak language, in contrast to the Chukchee, which has almost no
dialects, is furthermore divided into several local dialects. Each bay
and river, with its few villages, has a dialect of its own, differing
from the others in pronunciation and vocabulary; and a dialect of
Kamchatka may in some respects be nearer to a dialect of Penshina Bay
than to that of its immediate neighbor.

The following series of texts was collected chiefly in the village of
Kamenskoye (Koryak, Vai'kenan), on Penshina

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

Bay, with the help of Nicholas Vilkhin, Mr. Jochelson's interpreter. The
correct transcription of Koryak phonetics offered considerable
difficulty, since Nicholas Vilkhin, a half-Russianized Koryak raised in
Gishiginsk, belongs by birth to the village of Paren (Koryak, Poi'tIn).
Now, the dialects of Paren and Kamenskoye, though very much alike,
present several points of difference. Some of these are, that *e* of
Paren is replaced by *a* in Kamenskoye; *tk*, by *tč* (*čč*); *y*, by
*s*. The people of Kamenskoye are well acquainted with the Paren
pronunciation, because the intercourse between the villages is
considerable. Therefore many of them, when talking with the interpreter,
would assume his style of pronunciation. I have tried to avoid
confounding the two systems of pronunciation, but I am not sure that I
have succeeded in doing so in all cases. Besides this, the rules of
pronunciation, which are strict and consistent in the Chukchee language,
are quite lax in all the Koryak dialects.

The harmony of vowels, which exists in Chukchee, is unstable in Koryak,
and often inconsistent. Chukchee has two groups of long vowels,--

<table data-cellspacing="0" data-border="0" data-cellpadding="9" width="269">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

<p>a</p></td>
<td width="33%" data-valign="TOP"><em></em>
o (
<del>o</del>)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

\[paragraph continues\] The vowels of the one group cannot be combined
with those of the other, either in single words or in compounds such as
are in use in this group of languages. The other vowels of the Chukchee
are short, obscure, and neutral. Therefore they may form combinations
with either group of long vowels. In compounds, the vowels of the first
group are replaced by the corresponding vowels of the second group
whenever the word contains a single vowel of the second group in any
position whatsoever. There are also some stems containing only neutral
vowels, which

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

nevertheless require the exclusive use of vowels of the second group in
the other parts of the word.

In Koryak, with its constant dialectical changes from *a* to *e*, this
pair of vowels is excluded from the action of the vocalic harmony just
described, and both *a* and *e* are considered as neutral. Thus, in the
dialect of Kamenskoye, *nu'tanut* (EARTH) changes in the dative to
*notaï'tIñ*. The two remaining pairs (*i*-*ê*, <span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1) *u*-*o*) also admit many exceptions, in
contrast to the strictness of the rule of harmony prevailing in
Chukchee. Owing to the intermarriage between the people of different
villages, *a*, *e*, *ä*, *i*, may also be used in the same place by
different persons, especially when not under accent; for instance,
*na'nako* and *na'nIko*. In the same way, *uu* and *oo*, *aw* and *ā*,
the verbal suffixes -*lin* and -*len*, interchange; for instance, some
people of Kamenskoye say *nuu'wġe* (COOKED MEAT), others *noo'wġe*.

There are also dialectic differences in the use of consonants; for
instance, intervocalic *y*, which is omitted in Chukchee and preserved
in the Paren dialect of the Koryak, may be omitted in the Kamenskoye
dialects, although it is sometimes pronounced, but less distinctly than
in the Paren dialect. The sound *č* may to a considerable extent be
replaced by *s*, *s\**, *t*. Chukchee has for this sound two different
pronunciations, *č* by men, and *š* by women. A slight difference in the
pronunciation by the sexes exists among the Koryak, but much less strict
and regular than in Chukchee. Men use the pronunciation *č*, while women
employ *s\** or *t* <span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2). The sound-group
*nñI* is replaced individually by *nni*; *q*, by *k*; *wġ*, by *ww* or
*wx*; *y*, by *ġ*; etc.

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

Except when otherwise stated, the texts were taken

down in the village of Kamenskoye, from the lips of Maritime Koryak
women or girls, as follows: 1, 2, 12-14, 18, from Pa'qa; 3, 17, from
Ai'wan-ñaw; 4, 5, 8-10, 16, from Anne; 6, from Yu'łta-ña'ut; 7, 19, 20,
from A'qanñaw; 11, from Ai'u-ña'ut; 15, from IpIña.

Text No. 21 is in the dialect of Pa'llan, a large village of northern
Kamchatka on the Okhotsk Sea, and was related to me by Basile, a
Maritime Koryak man.

Text No. 22 is in the Paren dialect, taken down in the village of
Kamenskoye from the words of Nicholas Vilkhin, a native of Paren, Mr.
Jochelson's interpreter.

Text No. 23 is in six languages,--in Chukchee; in Koryak of Kamenskoye,
Qare'ñIn, <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3) and Lesna; <span
id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4) and in Kamchadal of the Okhotsk shore and of
the village Sedanka (Kamchadal, E'sxlin) in the mountains, the dialect
of which has undergone a great change through Koryak influences. The
original text is from Kamenskoye, and was dictated by Anne, a Koryak
woman of that village. The Chukchee translation was made by Aqan\*kau',
a Maritime Chukchee man at the mouth of the Anadyr; the Qare'ñIn
version, by Maria, a Koryak woman of the village Qare'ñIn; the Lesna
version, by Andrew, a Maritime Koryak man from Lesna; the first
Kamchadal version, by Ivan Kulagin, a Kamchadal man from the village
Napana (Kamchadal, Na'pno); and the second Kamchadal version, by
Tatiana, a Kamchadal woman from Sedanka.

Text No. 24 is in three dialects,--Kamenskoye, Paren, and Qare'ñIn. The
original text was recorded from dictation by Pa'qa, a Koryak girl of the
village of Kamenskoye. The Paren translation was made by Nicholas

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Vilkhin; and the Qare'ñIn translation, by Maria
of Qare'ñIn, mentioned before.

These texts may serve very well for a comparative study of all three
languages. I took care to have the translation made as literally as
possible, although a few changes were unavoidable. Thus, for instance,
the Koryak *QuyInn\*aqu'nu*, which is simply the plural of
*Quiqinn\*a'qu*, is translated in Kamchadal as *K!u'txen
k!č!a'mjanł\`a<sup>?</sup>n* (KUTX'S MEN). The Chukchee *erre'č*
(Kamenskoye Koryak *aččo'č*), which signifies THAT IS ALL, in the
Qare'ñIn Koryak is replaced by. *tenma'wIłen*, which signifies THE
FINISHED ONE. *Ġe'tkurlI*, added in two Kamchatka Koryak texts,
signifies DID ALL AT ONCE, and indicates the suddenness of action, etc.

The affinity between the Chukchee and the various dialects of the Koryak
is evident; but in reality it is still greater than it appears after a
hasty comparison. For instance, HE BROUGHT HER HOME, in Qare'ñIn Koryak,
is *ġanrai'tałen*; and in Chukchee, *rIrai'tannen*. The Chukchee,
however, has also the form *ġanrai'taŁen*, only it is used syntactically
in a different manner.

Free translations of a part of these tales were published in Mr.
Jochelson's work on the Koryak ("Publications of the Jesup North Pacific
Expedition," Vol. VI), together with other Koryak and Kamchadal tales
which I collected without original texts. References to Mr. Jochelson's
versions are here given in footnotes to the tales.

A number of tales are given with interlinear translation and free
translation; others, only with free translation. The attempt has been
made to render the texts as accurately as possible; but it has been
found necessary to omit in the translations many of the particles, which
are as numerous in Koryak as in Chukchee, and hardly admit of adequate
translation.

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

Words added in translations for the sake of clearness are placed in
parentheses. Literal translations of Koryak words or phrases are
enclosed in brackets.

The Koryak here given may be compared with the Chukchee texts published
by me in Vol. VIII of the "Publications of the Jesup North Pacific
Expedition" and in the "Publications of the Russian Imperial Academy of
Sciences." <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5)

Few Koryak or Chukchee tales are known under definite names. Titles
indicating the contents have been added by me. I have transcribed the
name of BIG-RAVEN in the form most frequently met with, *QuyqInn\*a'qu*,
although Mr. Jochelson prefers *Quikinn\*a'qu*. In Chukchee are found
the forms *Ku'rkIl* or *Ku'urkIl*; and in Kamchadal, *K!utx*. In Koryak
I write the third letter as *y*, because it replaces Chukchee *r*; the
fourth letter as *q*, because of the corresponding Kamchadal *x*. For
*Eme'mqut*, in the English translation, I have retained. the Paren
pronunciation adopted by Mr. Jochelson, although in these texts the
Kamenskoye pronunciation Ama'mqut was used more frequently.

The following alphabet has been used for transcribing Koryak and
Kamchadal sounds: -

b\`, p\`, d\`, t\`, k\`, g\`, w\`, l\`, m\`, n\` have a spirant added
(*Gehauchter Absatz* of Sievers).

! designates the increased stress of articulation. K!, p!, č!, t!, are
pronounced with a sudden explosion, which gives them a clicking sound.

? a full pause between two sounds: yiñe?a, att?Iyuł.

\- used to connect the parts of a compound word.

| Ł         | posterior palatal *1*, like *L*, but sonant. The Chukchee has both the surd *L*, and the sonant *Ł*. The Koryak has only the sonant *Ł*, which, however, is pronounced differently from the Chukchee sonant *Ł*, in that the back of the tongue touches the hard palate with less pressure. And the Koryak sound *Ł* is almost similar to double *łł*. I use, however, the same transcription for both sounds, the Chukchee and the Koryak, because they fully correspond to each other. |

Sounds ë, ü, ö, å, x\*, j, z, belong only to the Kamchadal.

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

Since in the western branch of the Koryak the Chukchee *r* is replaced
by consonantic *y*, there appear the combinations *ay*, *oy*, which are
distinct from the diphthongs *ai*, *oi*. They are pronounced like the
respective diphthongs, but their *y* replaces the corresponding Chukchee
*r*.

In Koryak the compound sound *wġ*, *ġw*, replaces the Chukchee sound
*wkw*.

x in Koryak occurs but rarely, and replaces the velar *q*.

In Koryak as well as in Chukchee, *I* terminal and unaccented is
frequently pronounced with a slight nasal sound; but in Koryak the nasal
sound is often pronounced quite distinctly. I do not use any additional
sign to indicate the nasal character of this sound. On the other hand, I
preferred to add *ñ* when the nasal sound was pronounced quite
distinctly. Therefore, for instance, the dative of the noun has been
transcribed in some cases as *yayai'tI* TO THE HOUSE, and in others as
*notai'tIñ* TO THE OPEN COUNTRY.

In Kamchadal, the Chukchee *r* is replaced by *j*. This *j* sound is
often pronounced with a light *r* trill, somewhat like the Polish sound
*rz*.

In the second Kamchadal dialect, <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6) I
sometimes has a slight nasal sound. This nasal *ł* replaces the usual
*n* of the first Kamchadal dialect. <span id="fr_7"></span>[2](#fn_7) No
special symbol was adopted for this nasal *ł* sound.

The Koryak as well as the Chukchee, in order to express a strong
exclamation, transfer the accent to the last syllable. Under this
transferred accent, *i* is changed to *e*; and *a*, *I*, *u*, are
changed to *o*. For instance, *E'nki* becomes *Enke'*; *ñawa'kak*
becomes *ñawako'k*. At the end of tales, *a'ččIč* becomes *aččo'č*.
