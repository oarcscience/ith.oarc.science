# 8. Eme'mqut and Ila'. <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md)

Big-Raven was living with his people. Eme'mqut (his son) had no wife.
Eme'mqut went out, and found outside an old man who was (busy) making
ornamented (tobacco-) mortars. He said to him, "What kind of (tobacco-)
mortars are you making?" The other one said, ("Go into the house.) You
will find an old woman. (Tell her) to

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

cook a meal for you." He entered (the house), and (the old woman) cooked
a meal. When she had finished cooking, she took the meat out of the
kettle, (and gave it to the guest.) He ate, and soon was through with
the meal.

Then the old man went home and gave him the mortars; and he said to him,
"Take these with you, haul them away, but (in doing so) take care not to
look back at them!" He went away and hauled the mortars, but he did not
look back; and though the mortars were heavy, he did not stop. At last
he saw that a large (reindeer-) herd was passing ahead of him. Then he
stopped and looked back. A (young) woman was (sitting) in a covered
sledge (driving a reindeer-team). He took a seat (on the

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

same sledge). They two drove home, and lived there in joy.

Then Ila' said, "How did you come (by all this)?" The other one then
told him, "I found an old man who was working on ornamented (tobacco-)
mortars." Ila' said, "I understand." He set out and found the same (old
man). Then he said (to the old man), "What kind (of mortars) are you
making?" (The old man) said, "Go and find the old woman! Let her cook a
meal for you!" He went to her, and she prepared a meal. Then she took
(the meat) out of the kettle, and he ate. (The old man) gave him, too,
the mortars, and said, "Haul them away, and take care not to look back
at them!"

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

He hauled them away, and every little while he would take a rest. He
moved on, and he would make one stride and then he would look back. One
time a reindeer-leg appeared out of one of the mortars. But he sprang,
at it and struck it (in order to break the bone and get the marrow).
Another time he looked back, and a (reindeer-)face appeared (out of the
mortar). He sprang at it, and struck at the mortar with his knife, and
chopped up the (reindeer-) face. Then he came home, and left (his
sledge) with Eme'mqut. (There was nothing on it) but the
tobacco-mortars. That is all.
