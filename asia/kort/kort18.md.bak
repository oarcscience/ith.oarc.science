# 14. Eme'mqut and Shellfish-Girl.

Dig-Raven lived with his people. Oh, Eme'mqut walked along the seashore,
and found some shellfish. He detached one shellfish, and it began to
whimper, "Iġiġi'!" He said, "Cease your crying! Yonder among the
stone-pine bushes (lies) your detached hood."

Oh, he went and looked for it! It had turned into a small house. He
entered the house and married that Shellfish-Girl. Then he brought her
home. They lived there. That is all.
