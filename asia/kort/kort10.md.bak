# 6. Kĭlu' and the Bumblebees. <span id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md)

Eme'mqut lived with his people. He married Kĭlu', but they were
childless. One time Eme'mqut went into

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

the open (country). He followed a river upstream. Then he saw numerous
people. Some of them were women. Their bodies were resplendent with the
reflection of light. All the men wore jackets of broadcloth, all the
women wore calico overcoats. Eme'mqut hurried to them. He fell in love,
and began to help those people. They were fishing with drag-nets. Very
soon he married a Bumblebee-Woman. Those people were Bumblebee people.
His new wife brought forth numerous children.

Then Kĭlu' became restless, and could not sleep. She came to the river,
and followed it up-stream. Then she looked around, and saw those
fishermen. Eme'mqut was

there with them pulling in the nets. Kĭlu' approached them. She trampled
to death Eme'mqut's new wife, who scattered around a large quantity of
fly-eggs. All the eggs became Bumblebees. The fishermen also turned to
Bumblebees. Eme'mqut could do nothing, so he went home. That is all.
