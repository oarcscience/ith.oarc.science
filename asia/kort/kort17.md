# 13. Eme'mqut and the Kamaks. <span id="fr_30"></span>[3](#fn_30.md)

Eme'mqut lived with his family. One time he went into the open and found
there a house. (A voice from)

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span> <span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

there said, "Halloo, Ła'wa! is that you? How are you getting along with
your human game?" <span id="fr_31"></span>[2](#fn_31.md) He said, "Well, we
two have killed some wild reindeer. How is (my) wife?"--"She has just
been delivered of a son. And even we two, staying here at home, have
killed one man. Now, Ła'wa, call to the spirits!"--"And where is the
drum?"--"\[What is the matter with you?\] (Don't you know?) Of course,
it is there on the cross-pole."

Eme'mqut called to the spirits. He put them to sleep,--the kamak-woman,
together with her husband. He revived the other man. They fled in the
night-time, together with Eme'mqut. In the middle of the night those
sleepers wanted to pass water. They came out, and said, "Our son has
become quite light of foot. And how is it? There are two
foot-tracks,--one to this side, and the other to that side.

They entered, and again went to sleep. Then their real son, Ła'wa, came
home. "Halloo, Ła'wa! have you come? Not long ago you were here, and now
you come back another time."--"When have I been at home? I have arrived
just now."--"How is your reindeer hunt?"--"Nothing killed. We were
famishing."--"There, Ła'wa, call to the spirits!" <span
id="fr_32"></span>[3](#fn_32.md) He took the drum. (It was made of pieces
of) skin of women's breasts sewed together. He began to call to the
spirits, "Trai, Tĭroi, trai!" <span id="fr_33"></span>[4](#fn_33.md) Thus
was he singing.

The other man lived with Eme'mqut's family, and married a daughter of a
reindeer-breeder. They lived quite happily. They staid there, That is
all.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_30"></span>[67:3](kort17.htm#fr_30.md) Compare W. Jochelson,
The Koryak, *l. c.*, No. 102, p. 290.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[69:2](kort17.htm#fr_31.md) Here a man is spoken of
as a "wild reindeer." In other tales a man is spoken of as a "little
seal."

<span id="fn_32"></span>[69:3](kort17.htm#fr_32.md) These words are
supposed to be in the language of the kamak. They differ, however, from
the ordinary Koryak of the western branch by the repeated use of *r*
instead of *y*. This makes them similar to the eastern Koryak dialect,
and to the Chukchee.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[69:4](kort17.htm#fr_33.md) Compare the preceding
footnote.
