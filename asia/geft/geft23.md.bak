### The Cunning Old Man and the Demi

THERE was once an old man. He might have worked but he was lazy. His
children went out to the fields, but this old man sat by the fire, and
if they did not show him great respect, he kept them out of the house.
His daughters-in-law quarrelled with him, and ended by turning him out
of the house. He begged of his eldest daughter-in-law, saying: 'Give me
a jar of flour, an egg, <span id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_42.md) and an awl,
then I shall go away.' She gave him these things.

The old man went on day and night, and came to the

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

bank of a stream; he looked over, and saw on the other side a *demi*, to
whom he cried: 'Carry me across this river.' The *demi* answered: 'I
shall not carry thee, but thou shalt carry me across, or I shall turn
thee into dust.' The *demi* seized a stone, struck it on the rocky bank,
and turned the great stone into powder. The old man also took his jar of
flour, struck it on the rock, and dust arose. The *demi* was astonished,
and said: 'How has he turned this stone into powder?' The *demi* took
another stone, squeezed it in his hand, and said: 'I shall crush thee
like this stone.' Then the old man took out the egg, squeezed it, and
when the moisture began to ooze out, the *demi* was alarmed: he came
over the stream, took the old man on his shoulder, and carried him
across.

In the middle of the stream, the *demi* said to the old man: 'How light
thou art!' The old man answered: 'I am holding on to the sky with one
hand, if I let go, thou wouldst fall under my weight.' The *demi* said:
'Just leave go for a moment.' The old man took out the awl, and stuck it
in the *demi's* neck. The *demi* cried: 'Lay hold of the sky again!' The
old man put the awl in his pocket.

When they had reached the other side, the *demi* said to the old man: 'I
shall drive in game, and thou canst meet it here.' So the *demi* went
and drove in the game. The old man was afraid of wild beasts, and hid
himself in the forest, where he found a dead red-breast. <span
id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_43.md) When the *demi* returned, he asked: 'What
hast thou done with the game?' The old man replied: 'Thou didst not
drive the game properly, or how could any beast that walks on earth
escape from me, that could catch this bird on the wing?'

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

The *demi* went and killed two deer, two wild goats, two boars, two
hares; some he boiled, some he roasted, he made ready two measures
(*kilas* of 36 to 40 pounds) of millet, two *cocas* (a *coca* = 25
bottles) of wine, and said: 'Let us sit down and eat.' The old man said:
'Make me a bridge over this river, there will I sup.' The *demi* built
him a little bridge, on which he seated himself. The *demi* gave him one
deer, one wild goat, one boar, one hare, one *kila* of millet, one
*coca* of wine, and then sat down near him in the field. The *demi* ate,
but the old man threw the food into the river. The *demi* thought the
old man was eating everything, and was afraid, thinking: 'It would seem
that he can eat more than I can.' Lower down the stream, wolves caught
and ate the meat the old man threw away. The old man asked for another
deer. The *demi* brought it, and the old man threw it in the water. The
*demi* did not know this. The old man said: 'I have had a snack this
evening.'

Next day, the *demi* invited the old man to his house. They went there.
The *demi* went out alone to hunt. He met a wolf and a jackal, and said
to them: 'Come and hunt with me. To my house there has come a guest who
can eat ten deer and wild goats; yesterday evening we had two deer, but
they were a mere snack to him.' The wolf and the jackal said to the
*demi*: 'Thy guest did not eat one of them, he threw everything into the
river, we caught it and ate it, the old man ate nothing.' The *demi*
said to the wolf and the jackal: 'Then let us go and expose this old
man's fraud.'

There went with the *demi* nine wolves and jackals, to give evidence
against the old man. The old man looked out, and saw the *demi* coming
along in front, with the wolves

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

and jackals behind him. The old, man cried to the *demi*: 'Dost thou not
owe me more than ten wolves and jackals?' The wolves and jackals
exchanged glances, and said: 'It would seem that this *demi* has
betrayed us.' They threw themselves on the *demi* and turned him into
dust. <span id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_44.md)

<span id="fn_44"></span>[132:1](geft23.htm#fr_45.md) Another Mingrelian
version of this story tells that the *demi* took the old man home, and
left him his house, wife and children. As he was going away, the jackal
met him, and asked whither he was going. The *demi* replied that the old
man had almost killed him, and he was going to hide himself. The jackal
told him to go home, and have no fear of the old man, for it would choke
him. The *demi* tied the jackal to himself, with a stout rope, and went
back. The old man met them with the following words: 'This is splendid,
my jackal--thou wast to bring me nine Bemis, thou hast brought eight
already, and this will make the ninth.' The *demi* was alarmed, he
rushed off, dragging after him the jackal, whom he knocked against
twenty trees, and disappeared. The old man stayed in the *demi's* house
all the days of his life.
