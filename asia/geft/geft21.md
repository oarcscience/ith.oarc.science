### The Story of Geria, the Poor Man's Son

THERE was once a poor married man who had only one son; but this son was
very handsome and strong, and his name was Geria. <span
id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_33.md) Once the youth went out to hunt, and when
he was coming home in the evening he met a woman with a jar going to the
spring for water; he aimed an arrow at her, and broke the jar. The woman
turned to him and said: 'If thou art so warlike, instead of breaking my
pot why dost thou not go and fetch the only sister of the twelve *demis*
that dwell beyond the twelve mountains?' When he heard this, the youth's
heart began to beat wildly for eagerness to see the maiden.

He went home and said to his parents: 'Get ready food to last me a year,
and if I do not come back in that time set out to seek for me.' His
parents would not consent,

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

but said: 'We have no child but thee, wilt thou go away from us and
perish?' They wept with one accord, but Geria heeded them not. So they
got him provisions. They bade him farewell with sobs. Such wailing was
there that the parting was known throughout the country side, yea, even
to sun and moon, to heaven and earth, to the sea and the sands thereof.
At last they blessed their son and let him go. He took with him a little
dog, whose name was Mathicochi. <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_34.md) When
they took leave one of another, they embraced, they kissed, and the
youth sped on his way.

He went, he went, he went, he went as much as he could--week and week,
week and fortnight, a year and three months, <span
id="fr_36"></span>[2](#fn_35.md)--he went over six mountains. When he had
crossed these six mountains everything round about him began to reel:
trees and stones fell down and clattered into the valleys, but Geria was
not hurt by them. Then, from beneath, there came to him a voice, saying:
'What kind of man art thou to stand thus against me. Who can resist me
but Geria, the poor man's son.' '‘Tis I--Geria, the poor man's son.'

When she heard this, the Rokapi <span id="fr_37"></span>[3](#fn_36.md) went
out to meet him, bowed herself; did great honour to him, and said:
'Whither wilt thou go?' The youth told her all. The Rokapi was moved
with sorrow. Geria asked her: 'Why

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

dost thou grieve?'--'For that I have seen many go thither, but I have
seen none come back.' But Geria heeded her not, and went on his way.

He went, he went, he went more than he could, and when he had crossed
the other six mountains a still greater earthquake began. It turned out
that this region belonged to the eldest sister of the Rokapis; but Geria
showed no sign of fear. The Rokapi cried to him: 'What manner of man art
thou to resist my witchcraft? Art thou Geria, the poor man's son?' He
cried out to her: 'I am he.' The Rokapi at once went out to meet him,
bowed herself, treated him with respect, and asked him: 'Whither art
thou going?' Geria told her his plan, and this Rokapi too was
distressed. Geria asked her why she grieved. She answered: 'Because I
have seen many on their way thither, but I have never seen one come
back; albeit, I will do thee one service, I give thee my three-legged
horse.' She called the horse, and said to him: 'As long as Geria lives
serve him faithfully.' Geria bade her farewell, mounted the horse, and
rode away with his little dog Mathicochi.

He rode out into a great meadow, and came near the abode of the devils.
When he looked upon the mead his heart was glad, and his eyes filled
with tears, he bethought him of his home and its beautiful fields, he
uttered a blessing to God the merciful. Then he urged his horse onward,
at such speed that clouds of dust rose behind him. The youth said to
himself: 'Lo, I am now in the unknown land!' Up he rode to the *demis*'
gate, leaped from his horse, and tied it there.

He walked away a little, and then cried: 'Methinks I have not fastened
my horse securely!' Back he went, tore up an oak by the roots, planted
it with its branches downwards

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

in the earth, and firmly tied his horse to it. Then the horse said: 'If
thou hadst not done this I should have fled home, but now do as I tell
thee, and all will be well. The *demis* are indoors; go to the meadow,
there thou wilt find a kettle, overturn it. Then betake thyself to the
damsel, and get her to plight her troth to thee.'

Geria went, kicked the kettle, turned it over three times, and left it
upside down, then he went to the maiden, broke all the locks, and came
to the room where she was. She was astonished, but the youth's bravery
pleased her, and, to make a long story short, she promised to marry him.
The youth went out merrily to the place where he had left his horse.
There he quietly spent the night, and next morning the horse said: 'The
devils have now gone out to the meadow; when they saw the kettle turned
over they marvelled, for it usually takes all the twelve devils to turn
over that kettle, and they said one to another: "Whatever we are
commanded by him that turned over the kettle that must we do,"--now it
is time for thee to go thither.' Geria went to the meadow.

As soon as the *demis* saw him, they all arose hastily, went to meet
him, bowed themselves, and said: 'What dost thou ask of us?' He
answered: 'You must give me your sister to wife.' The *demis* said: 'We
give her to thee, but the Black King will not let thee take her.' Geria
answered: 'I fear no man,' so (not to lengthen unduly a long story) they
made ready a banquet.

While the feast was still going on, in the morning, Geria looked out of
the door, and saw a host of men in black apparel, who had been sent by
the Black King. Geria mounted his horse, dashed into the midst and
defeated them all; three only did he save alive, as messengers, and

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

sent them to say to the Black King: '‘Tis I that have done this, Geria,
the poor man's son.'

The King was very wroth, and sent almost all his army against him. When
Geria saw them, he bethought himself a little, but the horse said to
him: 'Youth! this is nothing, look for still worse.' Geria struck the
horse with his whip, attacked the host, and slew all but one; him he
sent to bear the news. Upon this, the king went out of himself with
rage: he summoned his devoted and loyal slave to whom he was wont to
apply in all his difficulties, by name Qvamuritz Khami; <span
id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_37.md) to him he committed all that was left of
the army, and sent him out.

Geria arose and saw a sight, such a sight as I wish thine enemy may see.
It pleased him not to see Qvamuritz Khami; but what could be done? The
horse said to him: 'Youth! yonder is he of whom I spake.' Geria crossed
himself, gave thanks to God, bade his wife farewell, for he thought to
die, and went out. First of all he slew the army, and then he began a
single combat with Qvamuritz Khami.

Mounted they fought with maces, but the battle was not to the strong,
for Qvamuritz Khami's soul was safe in other hands--how could he be
killed? Qvamuritz Khami cried: 'O young man! thus shouldst thou shoot!'
and slew him. When Geria was dead, the victor slaughtered all the
*demis*, took Geria's wife, put her on her husband's horse, and carried
her off to his master.

But she said to the king: 'I am the widow of such a man that I will not
belong to a man like thee; either do battle with me, and let the
conqueror have his will, or give me leave to wear mourning for three
months.' The king feared to fight with her, for she was of the *demi*
race, so he

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

gave her a respite of three months. When Geria was killed, his head
rolled one way and his body another; his faithful dog Mathicochi went
and put the two pieces together, and lay down to guard them.

While all these things had been happening, a year had passed, and when
Geria's parents saw that he did not return, they set out to seek him.
When they came to a narrow road, they saw that several snakes had met
and were fighting, and all fell dead; then two great snakes crawled out,
threw themselves into the river, swam out again and began to crawl over
the dead snakes in various directions. They were all restored to life.
Geria's parents wondered at the sight, and said one to the other: 'Let
us take a little of this water.' They took a thimblefull of it.

When they approached, the little dog, Mathicochi, saw them, and ran to
meet them; sadly he took them to the dead body. When the unhappy parents
saw Geria dead, they both fell to the ground and sobbed bitterly; then
they remembered that the mother of the unfortunate youth had the
wonderful water with her. As soon as they sprinkled Geria with it he
came to life, and said: 'Woe is me! what a long time I have slept!' When
he saw his parents, he was glad, but, remembering all that had befallen
him, he again grew sad, and bade his parents farewell once more. They
wept much, but, putting their trust in God, armed themselves with
patience.

Geria set out for the land of the Black King, and when he came near,
went into a great forest; as he entered, he heard a very great noise. He
stopped, and there, on the road, he saw some one coming along,
destroying all the forest as he went, tree fell on tree; he looked
steadily, and saw a great boar rushing straight towards him; he threw
himself

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

on it, lifted it, and cast it three shoulders' lengths <span
id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_38.md) away from him; but they wrestled again,
they wrestled, they wrestled, three whole days they wrestled. At last
the youth was victorious, and tore the wild boar into halves. From the
lacerated boar there leaped out a wild goat. When the youth killed the
wild goat, there fell from it a little box; when he broke the box, three
swallows flew from it,--two of them he killed, the third he caught and
kept.

At that time Qvamuritz Khami fell ill, the agony of death came upon him,
for it turned out that this swallow was his soul. Geria killed the
swallow, and Qvamuritz Khami died. <span id="fr_40"></span>[2](#fn_39.md)
After this, Geria went into the king's palace, and slew all therein
excepting his wife. Her he took to his parents, whose patience and grief
were exchanged for great joy. They all went home together.
