### V

### The King's Son

A CERTAIN king had a son, and sent him out to be nursed by a smith's
wife. This crafty woman put the king's child in a common cradle, and her
own son in the gorgeous royal cradle. Some years afterwards, the king
took the changeling to court, and brought his foster-brother with him.
One fine day, the king set out for his favourite forest to hunt, and
took his pretended son with him. When they arrived, the king asked: 'How
do you like this place, my son? Is it not a magnificent wood?' The boy
replied: 'O father, if we could only burn it all somehow, what a fine
lot of charcoal we should have!'

Then the king sent for the other boy, and asked him the same question.
'There could not be a better forest, your Majesty!' 'But what would you
do with it if it were yours?' 'Nothing, your Majesty. I would double the
guards, so that it should not be injured.' Then the king saw how the
smith's wife had tried to cheat him, and put her in prison.
