### The King's Counsellor <span id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_54)

THE counsellor of an Arabian king once bethought himself that, though he
had lived so many years, and knew so much, he had never yet found out
how much the king valued his services, and to what extent his wife and
friends really loved him. He decided to try them all at once, so he went
to the palace and stole a goat of which the king was very fond, and of
which he was the keeper. He then went home, told this secret to his
wife, and in her presence ordered the cook to roast the goat. But
afterwards he privately told the cook to hide the royal goat, and roast
a kid in its place. At supper his wife praised the dish

very highly. As soon as the king heard of the loss of his goat, he was
very angry, and cried in his wrath: 'If any man finds the thief I shall
load him with gold, if a woman finds him I shall marry her!' The
counsellor's wife, thinking it better to be a king's wife, betrayed her
husband. The king ordered his counsellor to be executed, and married the
woman. When the execution was about to take place, the victim's old
friends succeeded in saving him by a large bribe, and another criminal
was executed instead. The counsellor was hidden in a neighbouring realm.
Some years afterwards, troublesome questions of state arose, and none of
the council could solve them. The king often longed for his old
counsellor, and said: 'For the sake of a goat I sacrificed a clever man,
if he were alive he would get me out of all my trouble in a day.' The
counsellor's old friends at last resolved to acknowledge the trick they
had played. So one day, when the king was in a good humour, they went
and said: 'Pardon us, O king! Your first counsellor is alive!' and they
told him all. The king was heartily glad, and ordered the exile to be
brought back. He was well received, and restored the goat to the king.
The king said: 'My friend! we thus see that the greatest scourge of all
is false witness, and that we must beware, above all things, of our
wives.'
