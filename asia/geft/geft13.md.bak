### XI

### Conkiajgharuna <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md)

THERE was and there was not, there was a miserable peasant. He had a
wife and a little daughter. So poor was this peasant that his daughter
was called Conkiajgharuna (the little girl in rags).

Some time passed, and his wife died. He was unhappy before, but now a
greater misfortune had befallen him. He grieved and grieved, and at last
he said to himself: 'I will go and take another wife; she will mind the
house, and tend my orphan child.' So he arose and took a second wife,
but this wife brought with her a daughter of her own. When this woman
came into her husband's house and saw his child, she was angry in heart.

She treated Conkiajgharuna badly. She petted her own daughter, but
scolded her stepdaughter, and tried to get rid of her. Every day she
gave her a piece of badly-cooked bread, and sent her out to watch the
cow, saying: 'Here is a loaf; eat of it, give to every wayfarer, and
bring the loaf home whole.' The girl went, and felt very miserable.

Once she was sitting sadly in the field, and began to weep bitterly. The
cow listened, and then opened its mouth, and said: 'Why art thou
weeping? what troubles thee?' The girl told her sad tale. The cow said:
'In one of my horns is honey, and in the other is butter, which thou
canst take if thou wilt, so why be unhappy?' The girl took the butter
and the honey, and in a short time she grew plump. When the stepmother
noticed this she did not

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

know what to do for rage. She rose, and after that every day she gave
her a basket of wool with her; this wool was to be spun and brought home
in the evening finished. The stepmother wished to tire the girl out with
toil, so that she should grow thin and ugly.

Once when Conkiajgharuna was tending the cow, it ran away on to a
roof. <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) The girl pursued it, and wished
to drive it back to the road, but she dropped her spindle on the roof.
Looking inside she saw an old woman seated, and said to her: 'Good
mother, wilt thou give me my spindle?' The old dame replied: 'I am not
able, my child, come and take it thyself.' This old woman was a *devi*.

The girl went in and was lifting up her spindle, when the old dame
called out: 'Daughter, daughter, come and look at my head a moment, I am
almost eaten up.'

The girl came and looked at her head. She was filled with horror; all
the worms in the earth seemed to be crawling there. The little girl
stroked her head and removed some, and then said: 'Thou hast a clean
head, why should I look at it?' This conduct pleased the old woman very
much, and she said: 'When thou goest hence, go along such and such a
road, and in a certain place thou wilt see three springs--one white, one
black, and one yellow. Pass by the white and black, and put thy head in
the yellow and lave it with thy hands.'

The girl did this. She went on her way, and came to the three springs.
She passed by the white and black, and bathed her head with her hands in
the yellow fountain. When she looked up she saw that her hair was quite
golden,

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

and her hands, too, shone like gold. In the evening, when she went home,
her stepmother was filled with fury. After this she sent her own
daughter with the cow. Perhaps the same good fortune would visit her!

So Conkiajgharuna stayed at home while her stepsister drove out the cow.
Once more the cow ran on to the roof. The girl pursued it, and her
spindle fell down. She looked in, and, seeing the *devi* woman, called
out: 'Dog of an old woman! here! come and give me my spindle!' The old
woman replied: 'I am not able, child, come and take it thyself.' When
the girl came near, the old woman said: 'Come, child, and look at my
head.' The girl came and looked at her head, and cried out: 'Ugh! what a
horrid head thou hast! Thou art a disgusting old woman!' The old woman
said: 'I thank thee, my child; when thou goest on thy way thou wilt see
a yellow, a white, and a black spring. Pass by the yellow and the white
springs, and lave thy head with thy hands in the black one.'

The girl did this. She passed by the yellow and white springs, and
bathed her head in the black one. When she looked at herself she was
black as a negro, and on her head there was a horn. She cut it off again
and again, but it grew larger and larger.

She went home and complained to her mother, who was almost frenzied, but
there was no help for it. Her mother said to herself: 'This is all the
cow's fault, so it shall be killed.'

This cow knew the future. When it learned that it was to be killed, it
went to Conkiajgharuna and said: 'When I am dead, gather my bones
together and bury them in the earth. When thou art in trouble come to my
grave, and cry aloud: "Bring my steed and my royal robes!"'
Conkiajgharuna

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

did exactly as the cow had told her. When it was dead she took its bones
and buried them in the earth.

After this, some time passed. One holiday the stepmother took her
daughter, and they went to church. She placed a trough in front of
Conkiajgharuna, spread a *codi* (80 lbs.) of millet in the courtyard,
and said: 'Before we come home from church fill this trough with tears,
and gather up this millet, so that not one grain is left.' Then they
went to church.

Conkiajgharuna sat down and began to weep. While she was crying a
neighbour came in and said: 'Why art thou in tears? what is the matter?'
The little girl told her tale. The woman brought all the brood-hens and
chickens, and they picked up every grain of millet, then she put a lump
of salt in the trough and poured water over it. 'There, child,' said
she, 'these are thy tears! Now go and enjoy thyself.'

Conkiajgharuna then thought of the cow. She went to its grave and called
out: 'Bring me my steed and my royal robes!' There appeared at once a
horse and beautiful clothes. Conkiajgharuna put on the garments, mounted
the horse, and went to the church.

There all the folk began to stare at her. They were amazed at her
grandeur. Her stepsister whispered to her mother when she saw her: 'This
girl is very much like our Conkiajgharuna!' Her mother smiled scornfully
and said: 'Who would give that sun-darkener such robes?'

Conkiajgharuna left the church before any one else; she changed her
clothes in time to appear before her stepmother in rags. On the way
home, as she was leaping over a stream, in her haste she let her slipper
fall in.

A long time passed. Once when the king's horses were drinking water in
this stream, they saw the shining slipper,

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

and were so afraid that they would drink no more water. The king was
told that there was something shining in the stream, and that the horses
were afraid.

The king commanded his divers to find out what it was. They found the
golden slipper, and presented it to the king. When he saw it he
commanded his viziers, saying: 'Go and seek the owner of this slipper,
for I will wed none but her.' His viziers sought the maiden, but they
could find no one whom the slipper would fit.

Conkiajgharuna's stepmother heard this, adorned her daughter, and placed
her on a throne. Then she went and told the king that she had a daughter
whose foot he might look at, it was exactly the model for the shoe. She
put Conkiajgharuna in a corner, with a big basket over her. When the
king came into the house he sat down on the basket, in order to try on
the slipper.

Conkiajgharuna took a needle and pricked the king from under the basket.
He jumped up, stinging with pain, and asked the stepmother what she had
under the basket. The stepmother replied: '’Tis only a turkey I have
there.' The king sat down on the basket again, and Conkiajgharuna again
stuck the needle into him. The king jumped up, and cried out: 'Lift the
basket, I will see underneath!' The stepmother entreated him, saying:
'Do not blame me, your majesty, it is only a turkey, and it will run
away.'

But the king would not listen to her entreaties. He lifted the basket
up, and Conkiajgharuna came forth, and said: 'This slipper is mine, and
fits me well.' She sat down, and the king found that it was indeed a
perfect fit. Conkiajgharuna became the king's wife, and her shameless
stepmother was left with a dry throat.
