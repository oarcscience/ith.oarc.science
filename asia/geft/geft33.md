### VI

### Teeth and No-Teeth

SHAH ALI desired to see the hungriest man in his kingdom, and find out
how much of the daintiest food such a man could eat at a meal. So he let
it be known that on a certain day he would dine with his courtiers in
the open air, in front of the palace. At the appointed hour, tables were
laid and dinner was served, in the presence of a vast crowd. After the
first course, the shah mounted a dais, and said: 'My loyal subjects! you
see what a splendid dinner I have. I should like to share it with those
among you who are really hungry, and have not eaten for a long time, so
tell me truly which is the hungriest of you all, and bid him come
forward.'

Two men appeared from the crowd: an old man of fifty and a young man of
twenty-seven. The former was grey-haired and feeble, the latter was
fresh and of athletic build.

'How is it that you are hungry?' asked the shah of the old man. 'I am
old, my children are dead, toil has worn me out, and I have eaten
nothing for three days.' 'And you?' said the shah, turning to the young
man. 'I could not find work, and as I am a hearty young man I am ashamed
to beg, so I too have not eaten for three days.'

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The shah ordered
them to be given food, on one plate, and in small portions. The hungry
men eagerly ate, watching each other intently. Suddenly the old man and
the young one both stopped and began to weep. 'Why do you weep?' asked
the shah in astonishment. 'I have no teeth,' said the old man, and while
I am mumbling my food this young man eats up everything.' 'And why are
you weeping?' 'He is telling lies, your majesty; while I am chewing my
meat the old man gulps down everything whole. . . .'
