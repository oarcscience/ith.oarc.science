### I

### The Three Precepts

THERE was, there was, there was, there was, and nothing there was. <span
id="fr_24"></span>[2](#fn_23.md) In a certain country, a certain realm, a
certain region, a certain village, there was an orphan so poor, so poor,
that ‘tween heaven and earth nought could be found that was his. Being
in such a plight to-day, tomorrow, the day after to-morrow, this week,
next week, this month, next month, sad and thoughtful he became; he
thought, he thought, he thought, and at last made up his mind: 'I will
arise and try my luck,' quoth he. He rose betimes in the morning, called
on the name of God, turned himself to the right hand, <span
id="fr_25"></span>[3](#fn_24.md) and set forth from the house.

He went, he went, he went, beyond the sky, across the earth, across the
forest, across the field, across the plain,

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

over the mountains, he went as far as he could, and when he looked he
saw a man of graceful mien coming towards him.. The youth quickened his
step and they met. 'I wish thee victory, good youth!' <span
id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_25.md) said the stranger, 'whither goest thou?'
'May God send thee victory, my master,' answered the young man, 'I go to
seek a livelihood.' 'Be my servant for three years, and I shall teach
thee three things that will afterwards be helpful,' said this clever man
to the youth. The youth agreed, and went away with him.

At the end of a year's service, the clever man said to the youth:
'Whatever thou seest outside thy yard, throw it into the yard.' When the
second year had passed, he again spoke to the youth, and said: 'Lend
nothing to anybody unless thou art much pressed to do so.' The third
year came to an end, and it was time for the young man to depart; the
clever man called him and said: 'Tell not thy secret to a woman.' Then
he bade him farewell, blessed him, and sent him home. The youth set out:
he went, he went, he went by day, he went by night, over land, over
water, and when he reached home he began to establish himself, he made a
fence round his yard and, as he had been instructed, threw into the yard
all he found outside the yard.

One morning he went out and found on the road a red snake; he remembered
the instruction of the clever man and threw the snake into the yard. A
week later, the young man noticed that on the place where he had thrown
the snake, it had laid a multitude of precious stones. <span
id="fr_27"></span>[2](#fn_26.md) It is no

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

wonder that the youth was greatly pleased at this. He gathered up the
snake and the precious stones in the skirt of his garment, and put the
snake in a nest in his own house. Every day the snake laid him a
precious stone. The youth became wealthy: he built himself a fine house,
took a wife, and lived like a lord. Still the snake went on laying
precious stones, the youth became richer and richer, and gave himself up
to gladness. One day his wife said to him: 'Young man! who has made thee
so fabulously rich, for thou wast formerly poorer than any one on
earth.' 'Who? God gave me wealth,' said the husband, following the
clever man's advice, not revealing his secret. But the woman gave him no
peace; day and night she always asked the same thing: 'How didst thou
become wealthy?--thou must tell me, thou must.' The youth had no way of
escape, she wearied him out, and at last made him tell her all about the
snake. Since there was nothing else to be done, the young man took his
wife and showed her the snake that laid precious stones. After this, it
happened that the snake ceased to lay precious stones; the young man's
wealth began to diminish, and nothing was added to it.

When he was in this state, a certain man came and asked him for the loan
of a knife. Of course, being utterly cast down with grief and sorrow, he
remembered not the words the clever man had spoken to him, and lent the
knife. May it happen to thine enemy as it happened to him! It happened
that this wretched man was a thief. When he had got the knife he went
and broke into a house to steal; there he thrust the knife into the
belly of a sleeping man, slew him, and left the knife in the dead man's
body, then pillaged the house. Afterwards an enquiry was made into the
matter. They found the knife in the man who had been

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

killed and robbed, and it turned out to be the knife of the young man.
Of course he was taken and bound, all his goods were seized, and he was
treated as a thief ought to be treated. Thus did it happen to the
wretched youth who disobeyed the instructions of the clever man.

Yester eve I was there,  
This evening I am here. . . .  
Three apples, <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_27.md) three pomegranates,  
May God send thee,  
Ripe in thy hands.

The tale, the tale is ended. . . .  
Thou hast eaten maize-bread with ashes, <span

Thou hast drunk bad, stale wine,  
And eaten a rotten walnut. <span id="fr_30"></span>[3](#fn_29.md)

<span id="fn_23"></span>[109:2](geft19.htm#fr_24.md) The *Mingrelian Tales*
usually begin thus; sometimes the formula used is: 'there was, there
was, there was, and nothing there was, but nevertheless there was.'

<span id="fn_24"></span>[109:3](geft19.htm#fr_25.md) When a Mingrelian
undertakes a journey, he turns to the right several times before his
door and then sets out. This is held to be a favourable omen.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[110:1](geft19.htm#fr_26.md) The usual salutation
in Georgia.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[110:2](geft19.htm#fr_27.md) The word *Khvitho* in
Mingrelian signifies a precious stone laid by a snake or a fowl, which
turns into gold or precious stones whatever it touches.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[112:1](geft19.htm#fr_28.md) Cf. Carnoy et
Nicolaïdes: *Traditions de l’Asie Mineure*, p. 42.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[112:2](geft19.htm#fr_29.md) *Chkidi*, bread made
of Indian corn, is generally used in Mingrelia. It is cooked on the
ashes, and the latter are often found sticking to it.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[112:3](geft19.htm#fr_30.md) These verses form the
concluding formula of Mingrelian folk-tales. The second couplet is not
so frequently used as the first.
