### IX

### Two Losses

DURING a great storm at sea, a learned man heard the skipper giving his
orders, but could not understand a word. When the danger was past, he
asked the skipper in what language he had spoken. The sailor replied:
'In my mother tongue, of course!' The scholar expressed his regret that
a man should have wasted half his life without learning to speak
grammatically and intelligibly. A few hours later the storm arose again,
and this time the ship sprang a leak and began to founder. Then the
captain went to the scholar and asked if he could swim. The

man of books replied that he had never learned. 'I am sorry, sir, for
you will lose your whole life. The ship will go to the bottom in a
minute, and my crew and I shall swim ashore. You would have done well if
you had spent a little of your time in learning to swim.'
