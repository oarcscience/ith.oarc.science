### 2. (The Woman and the Lake-Spirit.)<span id="page_26_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_26_note_1.md)

 A girl refused to be married at the behest of her father. "To whom do
you want to be married? You do not consent to be married to a man.
Perhaps to a ke´lẹ you want to be married." She paid no attention (to
her father's words). At the same time, every evening she would sing
outside of the tent, "From the lake, O penis, come out!" After that she
would enter (the house). Her father heard this, and said to his wife,
"Oh, this daughter of ours, when we try to persuade her to marry, she
quarrels with us; but to whom is she married? She is married to a ke´lẹ
of the lake." They said nothing to her.

 Evening came. She went to the lake. Then she began to sing on the
lake-shore. "From the lake, O penis, come out!" Then a \[mere\] penis
appeared. She sat down upon it, and she herself copulated with it. At
the dawn of the day she went home.

 Then her father said to her, "Go and fetch some wood!" She obeyed.
Meanwhile they went to the lake, he and his wife, and they deceived it
(by this song): "From the lake, O penis, come out!" Then from the lake a
penis was thrust out. They caught it and cut it off. Thus they killed
it.

 The wood-carrier came home. Evening was approaching. The girl quickly
cooked food. Evening came. Then again she went out to the lake. Then she
was secretly watched. Again she began to sing, "From the lake, O penis,
come out!" Nothing appeared. Another time, "From the lake, O penis, come
out!" After that she even began to cry. "Oh, how strange!" Then again,
"From the lake, O penis, come out!" Nothing (appeared).

 Then she cried. She sorrowed much for the penis. Her house-mates were
secretly watching her. Oh, oh! but it was not there. She finished
crying, and again (sang), "From the lake, O penis, come out!" She cried
much, as if she were sorrowing for a dead (husband). At last she came
home. She could not do anything. On the next day she went to the open
country and found a bare skull.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_26">p. 26</span>

<span id="page_26_note_1"></span>[1](#page_26_fr_1.md) This tale was left
unfinished, because the next one, which was taken down earlier, and from
another person, forms its continuation. The two tales form a unit; but
the second half is more popular among the Chukchee, and has been found
in various localities.
