### 3. (Hare Story.<span id="page_192_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_192_note_1).md)

 There was a Hare. He lived with his wife. They had no children. The
Hare said to his wife, "O wife! I am going now to the Man-Slayer to see
what he is doing." He attached his reindeer to the sledge and went away.
After a while he saw a large reindeer-herd. It was that of the
Man-Slayer. Man-Slayer was working near his house, making a sledge. The
Hare came, and said, "How are you, Man-Slayer?" — Man-Slayer said, "I am
well. Come into my house, and tell my wife that she is to kill you and
to cook your meat, and I will come in to eat it." The Hare said, "I
cannot find the entrance." Man-Slayer grew angry, and aimed a blow at
him with his hatchet. The Hare was frightened, and ran into the house.

 He looked around, and saw that the entrance was no longer there, only
the vent-hole overhead. He jumped up; but could not reach the vent-hole,
and fell back to the ground. The wife of Man-Slayer called to her
children, "Here is a Hare! Bring me my knife!" The Hare was frightened,
and said, "Well, now, grandmother, do not kill me so soon! Better tie me
to a long line! I am so fat, I will try and jump about. Then my meat
will be more to your taste." The old woman did so, — tied him to a long
line. Meanwhile she prepared her kettle. The Hare gathered his forces,
and again jumped up toward the vent-hole, but again he could not reach
the vent-hole. Then he said, "O grandmother! how many dishes have you in
your house?" She said, "I have three dishes." — "Oh," said the Hare, "my
meat will be too much for these three dishes." He jumped again, but
could not reach the vent-hole. Then he said again, "O grandmother! how
many dishes have you in your house?" She said, "Four dishes." — "Oh, my
meat will be too much for these four dishes." Then he jumped again
directly through the vent-hole, bit off the line, and ran away. The old
woman saw it, and called, "O old man! catch the Hare!" The old man went
in pursuit of the Hare. He caught the Hare, and was going to kill him.
The Hare said, "Oh, well, grandfather, do not kill me so soon! I want
first to say good-by to the Sun. Then I shall ask something of you; and
at the same time you may sharpen your hatchet!"

 Man-Slayer began to sharpen his hatchet. The Hare said to him, "What
month is coming now?" Man-Slayer said, "I do not know. If you know, tell
me about it." The Hare said, "It is the month of wild geese, when the
wild geese are coming here again." — "Is that so?" — "Yes, it is! And
look there! Some wild geese are passing there on high." — "Where are
they?" — "Here, directly overhead!" Man-Slayer raised his head, and the
Hare snatched his hatchet away, and struck him on the neck. Man-Slayer
<span id="page_193">p. 193</span> fell down. The Hare cut his body into
pieces and filled a large bag. Then he mounted to the roof of the house
and threw the bag down the vent-hole. "Here, old woman! cook this Hare!"
The wife rejoiced, and fell to dressing the meat. The children were
skipping about. One said, "Give me the liver!" The other said, "Give me
the kidney!" She distributed the pieces; but as soon as one smelled of
his piece, he threw it away.

 The mother grew angry, and asked, "Why do you throw the pieces away?"
They said, "Well, this meat has a smell of our father." She smelled of
the meat herself, and cried aloud. Then she rushed out, but the Hare was
gone. She gave pursuit. The Hare saw her, and looked for a hiding-hole.
There was none. Then he saw an eagle-nest on the top of a larch-tree.
The Eagle-Woman put on a woman's combination-suit, descended to the
ground from her nest, and was going to work at a wooden dish. The Hare
came to her, and implored, "O Eagle! hide me in your wide breeches!" The
Eagle took off her combination-suit, hid the Hare in it, and put it on
the ground. She put the dish over it, and sat down on the dish. The
Man-Slaying-Woman came, and asked, "O Eagle! have you not seen a Hare of
mine, which I wanted to catch?" — "I saw him," said the Eagle. He passed
by, and ran up to the sky." — "Oh, alas! how can I find him now?" The
Eagle said, "Take a seat on my back! I will carry you up to the sky.
Then you may catch the Hare." — "Oh, quick! take me there!" The Eagle
put out her back, and the Man-Slaying-Woman sat upon it. The Eagle flew
upwards, and then said to the Man-Slaying-Woman, "Well, now, look down,
and say whether the earth is far enough away!" The Man-Slaying-Woman
said, "The earth is vanishing from view." — "Oh," said the Eagle, "now
hold on tight! I am going to turn a little." She turned her back
downwards. The Man-Slaying-Woman lost her grip, and fell down, head
foremost, to the earth, (landing) near the nest of the Eagle. Her head
and her whole body penetrated into the ground. Only the legs as far as
the knees remained out of the ground. The Hare dashed out from his
hiding-place, seized a stone hammer, and hammered with it on the old
woman's heels. Then he said to the Eagle, "Well, my friend, now these
will be good stakes for attaching our reindeer to. The end.
