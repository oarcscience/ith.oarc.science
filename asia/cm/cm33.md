 From what country is that traveller, who is being drawn by dogs? On his
way returning he came to be without a whip. Then I will make haste and
walk onwards. Then I will make haste and walk to the song. Truly, let us
be joyful!

 By whom was I born? I was born by the little mother. But for what was I
born?

### Shamanistic Songs.

 Half-improvised songs of the character of the two shamanistic songs
given below are rare among the Chukchee, and more frequent among the
Eskimo. Both of the following songs were also recorded on the
phonograph.

 The first song is that of a shaman, Nouroota´ġịn. He complains of the
impudence of women and boys of the village of Če´čin, who use his
shamanistic songs in his absence. Complaints like this are usual among
the Chukchee, who are jealous of the tunes which they use at ceremonials
or shamanistic performances. On the other hand, listeners to a "real
shaman" (li´i-eñe´ñịlịn) are inclined afterwards to appropriate his
songs and tunes for their own use. Nouroota´ġịn comes to the village for
his drum. Rattling on the drum, he talks with the ke´lẹ who is
underground. The ke´lẹ will draw the offenders underground with his
breath.

 The words of the second song are only in part Chukchee. The last two
lines, from the word "kaiu´hruta" on, are Ai´wan Eskimo. Ei´mui, a
member of a mixed community, began in Chukchee, and finished in Eskimo.
He explained that in doing so he feels more at ease. Indeed, many of the
inhabitants of that village speak in the same way, beginning in one
language and finishing in another.

 As to the language, I must also mention that the proper names
Te´čị-ñi´nqäiä in the first song, and Wukwata´ġịn in the second, though
used in a Chukchee connection, are not quite correct Chukchee. They
should be Če´či-ñi´nqäiä and Wukwute´ġịn. The change is more or less in
conformity to the Eskimo pronunciation of these words. Te´sik is Eskimo
for Če´čin. Wukwute´ġịn is a Chukchee name, and means in Chukchee "rock
limit." When used by the Eskimo, its form is Wukwata´hik.

 In the second song a shaman is described as travelling with two dogs.
He came to a land near a large lake. A ke´lẹ of a mocking character
caused him to have a delusion. When driving upon the ice of a certain
small river, it seemed to him that the ice was cracked, so that he could
<span id="page_143">p. 143</span> not cross. After a while, however, he
saw that the crack had closed, and he went over and drove on. "What
shall I do to that mocking spirit?" asks the shaman in the end. The dogs
are called "tɵnnêta´t dogs." The word "tɵnnêta´t" has no meaning in
Chukchee, and is said to be a word of the ke´lẹ language. In Chukchee
incantations and shamanistic songs I came across two or three more words
of a similar character. They were said to belong to the language of the
ke´let, and their provenience and meaning could not be ascertained. On
the other hand, the Asiatic Eskimo, as well as the American, have a
whole vocabulary of words said to belong to the language of the spirits,
and used only in incantations and at shamanistic performances. All these
words represent either methaphoric terms or obsolete words. Some of
those used in Asia are derived from American Eskimo roots.

### 14.

 Nouroota´ġịn<span id="page_143_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_143_note_1.md) was
indeed just mocking me. He was coming back from the country of Eu´nmun.
He was coming home, singing, to the land of Če´čin. His words were made
the object of laughter by the men. The boys of Če´čin used them all the
time. The mocking women used them all the time. He came home for his
drum. On coming home, he made the drum reverberate, and was called by
the ke´lẹ from underground. "What shall I do to this one? I shall draw
him down with my breath from the bottom of the earth." Ayaqa´, yaqa´,
yaqai´! I have finished, I have finished.

<span class="small">Written down from the words of Ei´mui, a Maritime
Chukchee man, in the village of Če´čin, May, 1901.</span>

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

### 15.

 Just now a ke´lẹ-boy said (to his mother), "Mamma, go out and beckon to
the little traveller. I want to have him for a 'spleen-companion.' Throw
open the entrance! This little traveller, with two dogs, with tɵnnêta´t
dogs, from the country near the lake, he is indeed just mocking me."
What shall I do with this fissure (in the ice)? Oh, it has closed of its
own accord! I have gone across, truly I have gone over it. Wukwata´hin,
who had no pity on me, how shall I act towards him, how, how, how? Thus,
thus, thus.

<span class="small">Written down from the words of Ei´mui, a Maritime
Chukchee man, in the village of Če´čin, May, 1901.</span>

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_138">p. 138</span>

<span id="page_138_note_1"></span>[1](#page_138_fr_1.md) This song and a
few of the subsequent ones belong to the Maritime Chukchee of the
village of Uwe´len, near East Cape. I consider them to be merely an
imitation of Eskimo songs. Half of the population of Uwe´len are
Nɵ´ɵkalên Eskimo. The Chukchee of Uwe´len are reputed to be, of all the
Maritime Chukchee, the most clever and adventuresome. They are given to
trading, and spend much time in visiting Eskimo villages on both sides
of Bering Strait. I wrote down the words in May, 1901, from one
Qo´tirġịn, an inhabitant of Uñi´sak, at Indian Point, who was of mixed
origin, half Chukchee and half Eskimo. Neither the words nor the tunes
were improvised. So, when Qo´tirġịn would make a mistake, the other
young men present would immediately correct it in chorus. Phonographic
records were taken of all the following songs.

<span id="footnotes_page_139">p. 139</span>

<span id="page_139_note_1"></span>[1](#page_139_fr_1.md) This song, as well
as the preceding one, is more or less rhythmical.

<span id="footnotes_page_140">p. 140</span>

<span id="page_140_note_2"></span>[2](#page_140_fr_2.md) The tune of this
song is Eskimo, from the village of Uñi´sak. It was used by the singer
of Uwe´len "from mere envy," as is stated in the song.

<span id="footnotes_page_140">p. 140</span>

<span id="page_140_note_3"></span>[3](#page_140_fr_3.md) This song is also
rhythmical.

<span id="footnotes_page_141">p. 141</span>

<span id="page_141_note_1"></span>[1](#page_141_fr_1.md) The village
Valqa´ḷên lies on the Pacific shore, to the southeast of Indian Point.
Its inhabitants are Chukchee. (Compare Vol. VII of this series, p. 95.)

<span id="footnotes_page_141">p. 141</span>

<span id="page_141_note_2"></span>[2](#page_141_fr_2.md) In this song the
singer, Vịyê´nto the Blind, calls himself a woman, and even gives
himself a woman's name, quite different from his real name. When singing
into the phonograph, Vịyê´nto worked himself up to a very high pitch,
which ended in a fit of hysteria. This was because his song was a kind
of wail, joined with an attempt at incantation. He was wont to sing it
when feeling quite low in spirits and sad, on account of his dark and
hungry life.

<span id="footnotes_page_142">p. 142</span>

<span id="page_142_note_1"></span>[1](#page_142_fr_1.md) Taġra´tiġịn, named
Nikon in Russian, a River Chukchee from the Middle Anadyr, who sang this
song for me, was to a certain degree Russianized, and spoke Russian
fluently. Perhaps his song bore traces of Russian influence, though I am
not sure of it. The tune was quite Chukchee in character, and he used to
sing this song when under the influence of fly-agaric, of which he was
very fond and a great consumer. The song was written down at a night
camp, when travelling from the mouth of the Anadyr to Markova.

<span id="footnotes_page_143">p. 143</span>

<span id="page_143_note_1"></span>[1](#page_143_fr_1.md) In the original
text the augmentative form, which is frequently used instead of the
ordinary form of the noun.

<span id="footnotes_page_144">p. 144</span>

<span id="page_144_note_2"></span>[2](#page_144_fr_2.md) Taken from
Bogoras, Chukchee Materials, p. 146. These songs were recorded among the
Reindeer Chukchee of the Kolyma. All of them belong to women. Therefore
the first line of the Chukchee text is given according to male
pronounciation (ġre´pịt); the second, according to female pronunciation
(ġše´pịt) *š* is pronounced like German *z*.

<span id="footnotes_page_145">p. 145</span>

<span id="page_145_note_1"></span>[1](#page_145_fr_1.md) Compare Vol. VII
of this series p. 329.
