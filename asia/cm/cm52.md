### 14. (The Girls as Avengers.)

 There was a hunter, a very good one, the only one in the village. He
was killing ringed seals, large thong-seals. Five brothers, doers of
violence, robbed the people of their food. Two daughters of the hunter
grew up, and said, "Our father has fed us till we are full-grown. Shall
we permit him to be robbed any more?" They pitied their father.

 So they began to exercise, became quite strong, and at last killed the
violence-doers, with all their kin.
