### 8. (The Giant.<span id="page_170_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_170_note_1).md)

 Once there lived eight brothers. Seven of them paddled off in a skin
boat. The eighth and youngest one staid at home. He went angling.
Lo´lhịlịn, the big man, passed by, and caught him up. He said, "I will
carry this home as a toy for my children." He carried him upon his palm,
and tossed him over to his wife. "There, here is a toy for our
children!" And at the same time it is a man. The children played with
the living toy, and fed it with their food. So the man began to grow,
attained their size, and became <span id="page_171">p. 171</span> a
Lo´lhịlịn. The brothers landed, and looked around for him. They could
not find him, and called out his name. Then he came, took them up, boat
and all, and put all this high up on a cliff. Even now they are still
there.

### Footnotes

<span id="page_170_note_1"></span>[1](#page_170_fr_1.md) I obtained this
tale in the Chukchee language from a man who from his early youth lived
with the Eskimo just as much as with the Chukehee. He said that the tale
is of Eskimo (Ai´wan) origin. It is difficult, however, to separate
folk-lore originally Chukehee from that of Asiatic Eskimo provenience.
