### 3. Incantation for taming Wild Reindeer (Qaalva´t-ê´wġan).<span id="page_128_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_128_note_1.md)

 When a wild reindeer-buck that has just shed his hair joins a
domesticated herd, \[the man\] the owner \[of the herd\] says, "Let us
try and make of him a tame reindeer! Let him create offspring for us!"

 He goes to the herd and utters \[there among the herd\] an incantation.
(He talks) to the Being of Zenith: "Oh, You, there above! I am in great
need. This one wants to go away, and he is the first of his kind that I
have seen here.

 "Give me your wooden stake! I <span id="page_129">p. 129</span> will
stick it into his foot, I will thrust it between his antlers. I will
pierce his lower jaw, and bring it down to the level of the ground. With
what else shall I pin (to the ground) this fleet-(footed) reindeer-buck?

 (I will gather) bowlders from all sides, and pile them up between his
antlers. How will he move (his head)? I will wrap his ears with sod.
\[As to his nose,\] I will gather withered sedge-grass and use it to
cover his nose. Let all bad odors from every (part of the earth) enter
into his nose!

 I make him into a fawn newly born. O (Good) Being! do not despise my
(demand)! Let me get possession of him! I will give you in exchange
(something) equally worthy to be desired."

 Then he spits, and with that the incantation becomes fastened. After
that he says, "Bring the herd (to the house)." They bring it to the
house. They make a fire in the house. They drive the herd windward, so
that he (the reindeer-buck) will smell the smoke. But he can't run away,
because he has become heavy. That is all.
