### 18. Two Shamans (Eñe´ñịlịt ñi´räq).

 There were two shamans. One was Teñququ´ñị, the other Rịġowa´ʟị.<span
id="page_100_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_100_note_1) (They lived in.md) a
village. Then the Re´kkeñ attacked them: they wanted to murder them. The
Re´kkeñ (pitched) camp (close to them). In the evening the people
laughed, — the human people.

 Those two were genuine shamans, especially Rịġowa´ʟị. Amid the talk in
the night-time Rịġowa´ʟị was listening, while the other people continued
to laugh. Then he said, "Be silent! Here are strange ears. Well, let me
look for them!"

 He went out. And all at once he saw them. They were still building
their (travelling) tents. Their camp was quite close by. He went to
Teñququ´ñị. The people of Teñququ´ñị's house were also laughing loudly.
Oh, Rịġowa´ʟị called out, "Halloo, Teñququ´ñị!" — "Halloo!" — "Oh, are
you aware (of it)?" — "Aware of what?" — "Oh, they want to murder us!"

 The other one came out. Rịġowa´ʟị said, "Let us visit them!" They
prepared for the visit. They put on \[their coats,\] their shamanistic
coats. Oh, they came to the camp of the Re´kkeñ. An old man was
reclining on a sledge, — a ke´lẹ old man.

 They stood up opposite the ke´lẹ, but the ke´lẹ could not see anything.
Then the old man spoke thus: "Oh, hurry up and build the tents! We want
to go and bring provisions from this direction." Oh, they finished
(their <span id="page_101">p. 101</span> tents). Those two, however,
were still listening. Again the old man said, "Oh, where are the young
men? Bring the divining-stone here!" In reality, however, this was a
human skull.

 He began to practise divination. The shamans looked on, face to face.
"Oh, we came (here) for provisions! The people must have provisions." He
moved the skull with his staff; but the skull was motionless, it refused
to move. "Oh, how extraordinary! \[Dear me!\] Wherefore is this
divining-stone motionless? It is very strange with us. We are unable to
divine as to our getting provisions. Probably they have warriors."

 They pointed with their staffs at this old man while he was practising
divination. All at once he started up. "Oh, I feel pain!" In a short
time he was near dying. Then those spoke to each other, (saying,) "Let
us go and slay them all!" — "All right!"

 One of them, before his departure, promised to sacrifice a dog. He
promised it to his ke´lẹ before his departure. The other one promised
nothing. Teñququ´ñị struck at the people with his staff, — at the
ke´lẹ-people. Immediately the ke´lẹ-people fled. The ground (all around)
became like water, \[so loose became the ground.\] At the same time the
ground opened, — it opened in all directions, by itself.

 The (two) human shamans nearly vanished underground, as under the
water. Teñququ´ñị, the one who promised nothing (to his assistant
spirits), \[froze\] stuck in the ground (as deep as) about the middle of
his body, and could not disengage hlmself. Rịġowa´ʟị <span
id="page_102">p. 102</span> saw Teñququ´ñị, (and said,) "Oh, how strange
you are! \[Strange are you.\] You are a shaman. Have you promised
(anything)?" — "Oh, nothing." — "Oh, the deuce! Try and sing (your
song)." — "Oh, I cannot." — "Oh, try and call to your ke´lẹ."

 He tried (to assume) the voice of his ke´lẹ, but could not do it. And
the ground was (quite) frozen. "Oh, do something to me! I will pay you."
(The other one) said, "Well, now, tell me, what will those payments be?"
— "Well, a shirt of thin reindeer-skin, with an (inner) double set
(belonging) to it,<span id="page_102_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_102_note_1.md)
I will give you also a thong of thong-seal hide and a white-haired dog."

 After that, Rịġowa´ʟị began to sing in the open. Very soon a walrus
spirit came (to them). He continued to sing, and several walrus came:
they emerged out of the frozen ground. Rịġowa´ʟị said to Teñququ´ñị,
"They come for your sake. Well, now try to stir about yourself, and so
help them."

 Then they emerged quite close to this one who stuck in the ground. They
loosened (the ground) quite close to him, and he stirred. It proved to
be quite on the surface. So they made him loose (from the ground).

 They came back. He gave (to his companion) the thin fur shirt, and the
white dog, and the thong of thong-seal hide. They continued to live
there, and the ke´let again wanted to murder them. Two persons came,
driving reindeer. These were Cough and Rheum.

 The shamans went out. Rheum was saying to Cough, "You enter (first)!"
The shamans crouched near by (motionless). <span id="page_103">p.
103</span> Those two were approaching (the house), but again they fled,
frightened \[with superstitious fear\].

 Again they approached. This time Cough said to Rheum, "Well, you
enter!" At the same time they did not notice the shamans. Again Cough
said to Rheum, "Well, you enter!" And once more they fled. Nevertheless
they gradually drew nearer than before, and were now close to the
entrance.

 Another time Cough said to Rheum, "You enter! You belong to the
nose."<span id="page_103_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_103_note_1.md) And at last
Rheum entered. They caught him, \[consequently\]. He roared out from
shear fright. Oh, Cough, of course, fled. Oh, the poor thing wept
almost, "Oh, this Cough! He himself did not want to enter!"

 They went on asking him, "What are you?" — "Nothing, we are just
(nothing)." — "Oh, yes! You are Rheum." — "Well, I am Rheum." — "All
right, we shall kill you now."

 Then, being frightened, he told them everything. (He said,) "Thus I
enter into (the noses) of men." — "And the other one?" — "He is Cough."
— "Oh, such are you! We shall throw you to the ground." — "Oh, please do
not kill me! I will give you a dog." — "You lie!" — "\[Oh, yes!\] (I do
not). Just follow me!"

 Rịġowa´ʟị followed him. They went to his sledge. Rheum \[the friend\]
drove only one reindeer. In due time they came to his house. Near the
house a dog was tied up. Its ears reached to the ground.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

 "This one I give you. Have you a female dog?" — "Yes, I have a female
dog." — "Through that one will send (you the dog)." — "Oh, you are
deceiving me!" — "Indeed, as soon as you get back, the female dog will
be pregnant."

 Then the shaman went home. He came (to his house). The female dog very
soon became pregnant. Soon she brought forth (pups). One of those born
was this one recently seen (in the house of the ke´lẹ), the long-eared
one. In truth, (the ke´lẹ) sent it. A strong rib of whale served as its
tying-stick. He was (kept) tied up. And every evening he barked
incessantly.

 And lo! this dog could be heard even from another (very distant) land.
Then the next day he was still barking, (the whole night, and) even
after sunrise. In the night-time the ke´let came again. The master (of
the dog) slept quite soundly. So they put a net around the tent.

 They began poking under the tent-covers with the tips of their
driving-rods, that all the little souls should come out. Then the dog
snapped his tying-stick (in two) and went out and barked loud. It wanted
to attack the ke´let. So the leader of the ke´let said, "Oh, what the
deuce does this dog want! Let our own dog loose! Let our dog bite it!"
\[So they set it loose.\] So they set loose a dog, which also was very
large.

 Then the long-eared (dog) entered the house. It simply caught its
master with its mouth and carried him out. Oh, the ke´let began to
shout, "Let us make haste!" And the master <span id="page_105">p.
105</span> awoke while they were galloping about. He was a shaman, and
in a moment he was on the alert. Then again he struck at the ke´let with
a stick, and killed a number of ke´let, slew (all).

 They continued to live there. Rịġowa´ʟị went to a neighboring camp. He
went with a dog-sledge. His dogs were four (in number). One of them he
left with his wife. His wife said to him, "Take also this one for your
use!" Her husband said to her, "Why, it is your spleen-companion!"<span
id="page_105_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_105_note_1.md)

 The husband remained there quite a long time. Evening came, the sun
went down. Then from the direction of sunset came a ke´lẹ. He passed by
the entrance (of the house). The dog barked again, being tied up, as
before.

 Then the ke´lẹ approached again. And the dog began to speak: "Oh, now,
get your sledge ready and put the children in readiness upon the sledge,
and my harness have in readiness."

 They approached again. The dog rushed at them, but they were not afraid
at all \[of the dog\]. And it could only bark at them, "Ġịñ, ġịñ!" dog
ran back to the house. It said to the woman, "Oh, attach me, put my
harness on!" She attached it. They departed eastward \[windward\] and
left the house.

 Then the ke´lẹ entered (the house). He staid there in the house. The
husband (of the woman) came to the house. His three dogs had a load of
meat. But on coming to the house, the dogs threw themselves down, and
<span id="page_106">p. 106</span> would not obey when he tried to urge
them on, though they were quite near to the house.

 They were lying flat on the ground, and refused to go to the house,
because that ke´lẹ was in the sleeping-room. \[Subsequently\] (the man)
killed one dog, and moved (the sledge) along, dragging it himself. He
took a few (steps), and (the dogs) lay down again. The man said, "How
very extraordinary! It seems that (my people at home) are visited by the
ke´let."

 Then he drew his big shoulder-belt knife, which was on the sledge. Then
he shouted, "Halloo!" He heard only (a sound) like this from the
sleeping-room: "Mm!" He stood, knife in hand, "Oh, make haste!" — "Mm!"
— "Make haste, I say!" — "Mm!"

 In the mean time the ke´lẹ cautiously opened the front cover a little
way and looked out. One of his eyes (appeared) just like a lamp. (The
man) struck at it, and cut the eye. The eye-fluid spurted out in great
quantity. Then (the ke´lẹ) came out, and merely looked back upon the
house. It became stone.

 (The man) saw the tracks of runners, made by (the sledge of) his
fleeing wife. He went on along these tracks. He discovered (his family)
in a neighboring (camp). "Oh, you are alive!" — "Yes! Indeed, we were
saved by this dog." The husband said, "Such a one are you!"<span
id="page_106_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_106_note_1.md) Oh, they visited the
house, and this has turned into \[a\] stone \[house\].<span
id="page_106_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_106_note_2.md)

 They saw (entered) the house and looked around. (The woman) lighted a
lamp. There was everything (scattered about). <span id="page_107">p.
107</span> It was the contents of the ke´lẹ's abdomen, which came out, —
everything (made) of iron \[scissors, knives\], all kinds of peltries
\[wolverene-skins, wolf-skins, bear-skins\], — in a word, everything,
simply a mass of wealth.

 Oh, the husband entered (the house), then the wife entered, and the
child entered. The husband, being a shaman, said, "Close your eyes! Do
not look up!" Then he beat his drum. The sleeping-room became as before.
It was their sleeping-room, the same as before. Still the outer tent was
of stone.

 Again he said to them, "Quick, close your eyes!" Again he beat his
drum. And he said to them, "Now, look (about)!" And the house, which had
recently been of stone, had become an (ordinary) house. Just then they
looked on the riches, and all was simply turned to dry leaves and to the
boughs of a stunted willow.

 They lived there, founded a settlement, grew in number, and became a
numerous people. That is all.

a nose," one going first, "ring-leader."

<span id="page_103_note_2"></span>[2](#page_103_fr_2.md) This description
of Rheum's dog probably has some connection with the long-eared dogs of
civilized people, which the Chukchee have occasion to see.
