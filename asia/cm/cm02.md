## I. — INTRODUCTION.

 The following series of texts was recorded by me during the years 1900
and 1901 in various villages on the Pacific Coast of the Chukchee
Peninsula, between Mariinsky Post and Uñi´sak. A number of tales are
here given with interlinear translation and free translation. The
attempt has been made to render the texts as accurately as possible, but
it has been found necessary to omit in the translations many of the
conjuctions and interjections which are quite numerous in Chukchee and
which often appear in extended groups.

 Most of the tales have no native names. For these, titles indicating
the contents have been added. All such titles are placed in parentheses.
Only a few tales are named, like "The Raven-Tale," "The Polygamist-Tale"
and others. Words added in the translations for the sake of clearness
are placed in parentheses. Literal translation of Chukchee words or
phrases are enclosed in brackets.

|               |  The diphthongs are formed by combining any of the vowels with *i* and *u*. Thus:                  |
| ai            | like *i* in *hide*.                                                                                |

| \-                                                   | is used to connect parts of compound words.                                                                                                                        |

 wkw (before and after *u*, — *kw*) is pronounced as a compound sound.
The lips are placed in *u* position, while *k* is formed by the back of
the tongue.

 In a similar way *ġu* and *ġo* are often pronounced with a faint *w*
sound between consonant and vowel.

 ị terminal and unaccented is often pronounced with a slight nasal
sound.

 In a few cases *w* in the beginning of the word is also pronounced with
a nasal sound. No additional signs have been used to indicate the nasal
character of these sounds.

 *i* (consonantic *y*) between vowels is generally omitted or pronounced
very faintly.

 *yị* when preceded by the vowels *e* and *i* almost always loses its
consonantic character and becomes *i*. For instance: ġei´lqäʟin instead
of ġe-yị´lqäʟin.

 The terminal sound is often modified by the initial sound of the
following word, according to certain phonetic rules. These will be given
in a discussion of the Chukchee grammar. Owing to the slowness of speech
necessary for writing from dictation many such changes have disappeared
in the texts as taken down by me. I have thought it advisable to leave
these cases uncorrected. I have written for instance correctly: u´ñer
relu<sup>ɛ</sup>´ñịtkị, instead of u´ñel <span id="page_5">p. 5</span>
relu<sup>ɛ</sup>´ñịtkị, in accordance with the rule that terminal *l*
before *r* changes to *r*. But in another case I have left mê´mịl
ra´nmŭġnên.

 In contrast to the Koryak, the Chukchee language has hardly any
dialects to speak of. This is probably due to the mobility of the tribe
and to the frequent intermarriages between the Reindeer and Maritime
branches of the tribe. Among the Koryak such intermarriages are quite
rare. There exist some differences in the vocabularies of the Kolyma and
Pacific coast regions. Several words that are used on the Pacific coast,
— particularly south of the Anadyr River, — are found also in the Koryak
language. The Reindeer people of the Kolyma know their meaning, but
usually employ other words, which are in turn known, though not commonly
used, on the Pacific coast. The people of the Arctic villages speak
faster and harsher than the Reindeer Chukchee of the inland.

 The pronunciation of women differs from that of the men. They use in
most cases instead of *č* an *s·*, and instead of *r* (particularly
after soft vowels) *š*. They also use instead of *rk* and *čh* the
double *šš*. Contracted forms of words are never used by women. Men, for
instance, say nịtva´qenat, or nịtva´qaat. Women say only nịtva´qênat.
The sounds *č* and *r* are of frequent occurrence in Chukchee, so that
the female speech with its recurrent *š* sounds quite peculiar, and is
not easily understood by an inexperienced ear.

 The women are not by any means unable to pronounce *č* and *r* like
men; and in tales, when quoting a man's words they use the male
pronunciation. But in ordinary conversation the male pronunciation is
considered as unbecoming a woman.

 Specimens of female pronunciation will be found in a few songs of the
Reindeer Chukchee of the Kolyma, all of which belong to women.

 A few songs, proverbs and word games ("fast speeches"), taken down
among the Reindeer Chukchee of the Kolyma<span
id="page_5_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_5_note_1.md) have been incorporated in
this collection. These songs are not mere improvisations, like most of
the songs of the Reindeer Chukchee, since I heard some of the words
repeated many times without change.

 Proverbs are quite few and undeveloped. I am not sure even that these
phrases are proverbs in the strict sense of the term, though they are
fairly generally known and used in stereotyped form. Word games are in
use among children, just as those of Europe. Those given here are well
known also on the Pacific coast.
