### 6. For Hunting Sea-Game.<span id="page_132_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_132_note_1.md)

 This is an incantation for (hunting) sea-game. When hunters, having
gone out in a boat, have found a herd of walrus sleeping on the ice, and
the ice is not solid, (so that) the boat makes a noise striking against
small pieces of ice floating around, but the walrus are sleeping; oh,
one makes (the following) incantation, and says, —

 "O walrus! I put your ears on a (broad) iron pan, lest you \[the
walrus\] should be able to hear the rapping-noise \[the sleeping
walrus\]." Then the hunters are (able) to approach, and catch all (of
the herd).
