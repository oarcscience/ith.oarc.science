### 4. Raven and Owl.

 Raven and Owl fought for a hare. Owl caught Raven by the throat with
one of his claws. Raven cries, "Don't you dare to eat my hare! I wish to
eat it. I am the hunter," because he is so fond of big talking. Owl was
silent, but he clutched Raven's throat so tightly that Raven gave way.
Owl took the hare and wanted to eat it. Then a Fox assaulted him. The
Fox cried, "I am a great hunter! I kill everything, even the mouse and
the spermophylus." Owl was silent, and wanted to eat the hare. They
fought. Fox bit Owl's back. He was the stronger of the two. Owl desisted
and flew up. From mere shame he quite refused to perch again on that
place. The silent one also was not a victor. The end.
