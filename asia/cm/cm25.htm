<P>&#8195;When a wild reindeer-buck that has just shed his hair joins a domesticated herd, [the man] the owner [of the herd] says, "Let us try and make of him a tame reindeer! Let him create offspring for us!"</P>

<P>&#8195;He goes to the herd and utters [there among the herd] an incantation. (He talks) to the Being of Zenith: "Oh, You, there above! I am in great need. This one wants to go away, and he is the first of his kind that I have seen here.</P>

<P>&#8195;"Give me your wooden stake! I

will stick it into his foot, I will thrust it between his antlers. I will pierce his lower jaw, and bring it down to the level of the ground. With what else shall I pin (to the ground) this fleet-(footed) reindeer-buck?</P>

<P>&#8195;(I will gather) bowlders from all sides, and pile them up between his antlers. How will he move (his head)? I will wrap his ears with sod. [As to his nose,] I will gather withered sedge-grass and use it to cover his nose. Let all bad odors from every (part of the earth) enter into his nose!</P>

<P>&#8195;I make him into a fawn newly born. O (Good) Being! do not despise my (demand)! Let me get possession of him! I will give you in exchange (something) equally worthy to be desired."</P>

<P>&#8195;Then he spits, and with that the incantation becomes fastened. After that he says, "Bring the herd (to the house)." They bring it to the house. They make a fire in the house. They drive the herd windward, so that he (the reindeer-buck) will smell the smoke. But he can't run away, because he has become heavy. That is all.</P>
