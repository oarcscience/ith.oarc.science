<P>&#8195;From what country is that traveller, who is being drawn by dogs? On his way returning he came to be without a whip. Then I will make haste and walk onwards. Then I will make haste and walk to the song. Truly, let us be joyful!</P>

<P>&#8195;By whom was I born? I was born by the little mother. But for what was I born?</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center">Shamanistic Songs.</H3>

<P>&#8195;Half-improvised songs of the character of the two shamanistic songs given below are rare among the Chukchee, and more frequent among the Eskimo. Both of the following songs were also recorded on the phonograph.</P>

<P>&#8195;The first song is that of a shaman, Nouroota&acute;&#289;&#7883;n. He complains of the impudence of women and boys of the village of &#268;e&acute;&#269;in, who use his shamanistic songs in his absence. Complaints like this are usual among the Chukchee, who are jealous of the tunes which they use at ceremonials or shamanistic performances. On the other hand, listeners to a "real shaman" (li&acute;i-e&ntilde;e&acute;&ntilde;&#7883;l&#7883;n) are inclined afterwards to appropriate his songs and tunes for their own use. Nouroota&acute;&#289;&#7883;n comes to the village for his drum. Rattling on the drum, he talks with the ke&acute;l&#7865; who is underground. The ke&acute;l&#7865; will draw the offenders underground with his breath.</P>

<P>&#8195;The words of the second song are only in part Chukchee. The last two lines, from the word "kaiu&acute;hruta" on, are Ai&acute;wan Eskimo. Ei&acute;mui, a member of a mixed community, began in Chukchee, and finished in Eskimo. He explained that in doing so he feels more at ease. Indeed, many of the inhabitants of that village speak in the same way, beginning in one language and finishing in another.</P>

<P>&#8195;As to the language, I must also mention that the proper names Te&acute;&#269;&#7883;-&ntilde;i&acute;nq&auml;i&auml; in the first song, and Wukwata&acute;&#289;&#7883;n in the second, though used in a Chukchee connection, are not quite correct Chukchee. They should be &#268;e&acute;&#269;i-&ntilde;i&acute;nq&auml;i&auml; and Wukwute&acute;&#289;&#7883;n. The change is more or less in conformity to the Eskimo pronunciation of these words. Te&acute;sik is Eskimo for &#268;e&acute;&#269;in. Wukwute&acute;&#289;&#7883;n is a Chukchee name, and means in Chukchee "rock limit." When used by the Eskimo, its form is Wukwata&acute;hik.</P>

<P>&#8195;In the second song a shaman is described as travelling with two dogs. He came to a land near a large lake. A ke&acute;l&#7865; of a mocking character caused him to have a delusion. When driving upon the ice of a certain small river, it seemed to him that the ice was cracked, so that he could

<!------------------------page 143------------------------>

<A NAME="page_143"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 143</FONT></A>

not cross. After a while, however, he saw that the crack had closed, and he went over and drove on. "What shall I do to that mocking spirit?" asks the shaman in the end. The dogs are called "t&#629;nn&ecirc;ta&acute;t dogs." The word "t&#629;nn&ecirc;ta&acute;t" has no meaning in Chukchee, and is said to be a word of the ke&acute;l&#7865; language. In Chukchee incantations and shamanistic songs I came across two or three more words of a similar character. They were said to belong to the language of the ke&acute;let, and their provenience and meaning could not be ascertained. On the other hand, the Asiatic Eskimo, as well as the American, have a whole vocabulary of words said to belong to the language of the spirits, and used only in incantations and at shamanistic performances. All these words represent either methaphoric terms or obsolete words. Some of those used in Asia are derived from American Eskimo roots.</P>

<P>&#8195;Nouroota&acute;&#289;&#7883;n<A NAME="page_143_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_143_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> was indeed just mocking me. He was coming back from the country of Eu&acute;nmun. He was coming home, singing, to the land of &#268;e&acute;&#269;in. His words were made the object of laughter by the men. The boys of &#268;e&acute;&#269;in used them all the time. The mocking women used them all the time. He came home for his drum. On coming home, he made the drum reverberate, and was called by the ke&acute;l&#7865; from underground. "What shall I do to this one? I shall draw him down with my breath from the bottom of the earth." Ayaqa&acute;, yaqa&acute;, yaqai&acute;! I have finished, I have finished.</P>

<P>&#8195;Just now a ke&acute;l&#7865;-boy said (to his mother), "Mamma, go out and beckon to the little traveller. I want to have him for a 'spleen-companion.' Throw open the entrance! This little traveller, with two dogs, with t&#629;nn&ecirc;ta&acute;t dogs, from the country near the lake, he is indeed just mocking me." What shall I do with this fissure (in the ice)? Oh, it has closed of its own accord! I have gone across, truly I have gone over it. Wukwata&acute;hin, who had no pity on me, how shall I act towards him, how, how, how? Thus, thus, thus.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_138_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_138_fr_1">1</A> This song and a few of the subsequent ones belong to the Maritime Chukchee of the village of Uwe&acute;len, near East Cape. I consider them to be merely an imitation of Eskimo songs. Half of the population of Uwe&acute;len are N&#629;&acute;&#629;kal&ecirc;n Eskimo. The Chukchee of Uwe&acute;len are reputed to be, of all the Maritime Chukchee, the most clever and adventuresome. They are given to trading, and spend much time in visiting Eskimo villages on both sides of Bering Strait. I wrote down the words in May, 1901, from one Qo&acute;tir&#289;&#7883;n, an inhabitant of U&ntilde;i&acute;sak, at Indian Point, who was of mixed origin, half Chukchee and half Eskimo. Neither the words nor the tunes were improvised. So, when Qo&acute;tir&#289;&#7883;n would make a mistake, the other young men present would immediately correct it in chorus. Phonographic records were taken of all the following songs.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_141_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_141_fr_2">2</A> In this song the singer, V&#7883;y&ecirc;&acute;nto the Blind, calls himself a woman, and even gives himself a woman's name, quite different from his real name. When singing into the phonograph, V&#7883;y&ecirc;&acute;nto worked himself up to a very high pitch, which ended in a fit of hysteria. This was because his song was a kind of wail, joined with an attempt at incantation. He was wont to sing it when feeling quite low in spirits and sad, on account of his dark and hungry life.</P>

Perhaps his song bore traces of Russian influence, though I am not sure of it. The tune was quite Chukchee in character, and he used to sing this song when under the influence of fly-agaric, of which he was very fond and a great consumer. The song was written down at a night camp, when travelling from the mouth of the Anadyr to Markova.</P>
