### 15. Lị´mịlịn Lŭ´mñịl (A Story about a Polygamist.)

 Once (there lived) a polygamist.

 He said to his wives, "One (of you) have a fur shirt made, and the
other have some trousers made, and let them be all white." They finished
the clothes, and all of them went out. The moon was on the wane. Then
(the polygamist) <span id="page_84">p. 84</span> ran away. His wives
looked on. He crouched down and made himself flat right before them.
Then they looked for him, but could not find him.

 They entered the house. He departed towards the east \[windward\], and
saw a number of ke´let. One of them, just as he was coming, began to
angle for fish with a rod. Very soon he pulled out a little infant. It
was a human infant. He pulled it out. The infant cried, "Aña´, aña´,
aña´!"

 The man coughed. The ke´lẹ said, "Oh, oh, a guest!" — "Yes!" — "Let us
go home!" — "You go first," the ke´lẹ said to the man. "How can I go
first? I do not know (the way). The house-masters (should) go first." —
"Oh, oh, all right!"

 The ke´lẹ went first. They came to the house. "Go in!" — "We in our
houses are wont to say to our wives, 'Spread good skins for bedding. A
guest is here.'"

 "Ah, well, all right!" The ke´lẹ entered the house. "Oh, I bring this
one! Sharpen your butcher-knives!" Meanwhile the man fled, running to a
corner of the house — the one clad in white.

 The ke´lẹ came out, but (the man) was not to be seen. He made himself
flat there (upon the ground). The ke´lẹ began to chide his wife: "Oh,
this is bad! We have let our quarry go, very good game." The other one
again departed. Again he found a settlement. This one was of real human
people.

 One man came out. He stopped close by him, but the other one could not
see him at all. That one passed <span id="page_85">p. 85</span> water,
and then said, "The moon is on the wane." The guest then said, "It is
quite true." — "Oh, oh, a guest?" — "Yes!" — "Indeed, you are human?" —
"Oh, yes! Rather it is you who are not human. You are the ke´let." — "In
truth, we are not." — "Oh, then let us enter the house!"

 "But we have neighbors who indeed are ke´let, and these ke´let will
fetch you to their own house." They entered the sleeping-room. Before
they had time to eat, a ke´lẹ-woman entered. "Oh, I have come to fetch
you! You must marry me." He went out. She took him to her home. On the
sides of the entrance a brown bear and a polar bear were tied up. Before
they could enter, the monsters rushed at the man. The ke´lẹ-woman said
to them, "Aha! it is the master."

 They lay down and copulated. All at once an old woman appeared from the
rear wall. She carried a butcher-knife. This was the mother of the
ke´lẹ-woman. This old woman approached the man, carrying the
butcher-knife.

 She wanted to strike him on the head. He simulated sleep. Still she
proved to be quite nimble, and fled again. He (simulated awakening),
said to the ke´lẹ-woman, "Oh, I had a dream! Such an old woman (it was),
who nearly killed me!" The woman said, "Oh, oh! again, again! What are
you doing? I want to have this one for a husband."

 They slept again, The ke´lẹ-woman slept quite soundly, Then the man
laid her down and exchanged clothes with her. The woman's
combination-suit he used for a covering for himself, <span
id="page_86">p. 86</span> and his own fur shirt he put on her as a
covering. Then he slept again, simulated sleep. He had a knife ready.
The old woman appeared again from the rear wall, and all at once she
rushed on her daughter and struck her, sleeping, (with such force) that
the head was cut off.

 Just then the man struck the old woman with his knife, and also cut off
her head. He put on his clothes, and then went out, carrying both heads
with him. These he threw down to the bears. They pounced upon them. At
that moment he went out. He came to his recent host. "Oh, you have
come!" — "Yes." Then the old man called out, "Oh, oh, oh! from this time
the people shall go around in a different manner." Then he departed, and
on the way died of old age. That is all.
