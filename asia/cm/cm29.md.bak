### 7. To Cure a Sick Man.<span id="page_132_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_132_note_2.md)

 When a man (suffering from disease) is about to die, and has become
quite weak, he is carried (out of the house), though with great effort,
and (his body) is rubbed all over with something; (for instance,) with a
little snow. Then (another man) calls to the Upper Regions, to the
Pebble River,<span id="page_132_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_132_note_3.md) and
he speaks thus: "O Pebbly River! come down! I wish to use you for my
assistant." Besides this, he calls also the East Wind.

 Then comes a great (fall of) rain. The river is greatly swollen. The
patient becomes the rapids (of the stream). Everything is swept away,
nothing remains \[quite nothing\]. They throw something into the water
(as a sacrifice), and the stream sweeps away <span id="page_133">p.
133</span> all (the rubbish). Then the (suffering) man becomes better,
and is carried back into the house.
