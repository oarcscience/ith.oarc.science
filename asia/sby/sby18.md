## CHAPTER I

## THE RELIGIOUS ORIGIN OF THE YEZIDIS

The origin of the devil-worshippers has been the subject of much
controversy; but aside from an expression of views, no satisfactory
solution of the problem has as yet been reached. The different theories
which have been advanced may be classified under four general heads: The
Myth of the Yezidis themselves; the tradition of Eastern Christians; the
dogmatic idea of the Mohammedan scholars; and the speculative theory of
the western orientalists.

### I

### THE YEZIDI MYTH

The Myth of the Yezidis concerning their origin may be derived from
three different sources: from their sacred book, from the appendix of
the manuscript, and from actual conversation of travellers with them or
with natives [dwelling](errata.htm#7.md) among them. One

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

noticeable fact is that this tradition assumes the religion of the sect
as existing long before the time of their chief saint, Šeiḫ ‘Adî.
Al-Jilwah begins with the statement that Melek Ṭâ‘ûs sent his servant,
*i.e.*, the Yezidis, that they might not go astray. Starting from this
assumption, the writer of the revealed book goes on to trace the origin
of the "elect" to the very beginning of human history. He asserts that
from the start God created them as a peculiar people of ‘Azazil, *i.e.*,
Melek-Ṭâ‘ûs. In the main, this idea finds expression in the oral
traditions. But here we have a mass of material so clouded by
superstition and ignorance that it is next to impossible to come to any
conclusion as to the history of this interesting people. One point the
myth repeatedly emphasizes, as an explanation of the origin of the sect,
is that it was descended from Adam alone; while the other sects were
descended from Adam and Eve. For this reason, the same tradition
implies. the Yezidis are nobler than the others. But how they have come
to be such unique descendants is a question not easily answered. One
account has it that when Adam and Eve disputed as to the generation of
the human race, each claiming to be the sole begetter of the race, they
finally agreed to put their seed in separate jars and seal them with
their own seals. After nine months they opened the jars, and in Adam's
jar they found two children, a male and a female. From these two the
Yezidis were descended. Another explanation is that from Adam's essence
was born Šeher bn Jebr,

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

of whom nothing is known; and of him, a separate community, which is the
sect of Melek Ṭâ‘ûs. We have, moreover, the tradition that the Yezidis
are descendants of a son born to Adam of his spittle. Now whether this
son be identical with Šeher bn Jebr is not certain. Writing in one of
the oriental periodicals, an eastern scholar quotes a Yezidi šeiḫ in a
statement which seems to corroborate the tradition that the Yezidis are
a noble progeny of Adam; but the quotation differs from the instance
previously cited in stating that the quarrel which took place between
Adam and Eve led to their separation to places distant from each other a
journey of forty days. <span id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_70.md) There, it is
said, Adam miraculously gave birth to a son. Distressed by this
incident, Eve asked God that she might find favor in her husband's eyes
by giving birth to a child. Thereupon, it continues, she begat a very
pretty daughter. Attracted by her beauty, Adam married her to his son.
Now, the Yezidis, we are told, are the blessed seed of these two
children. <span id="fr_72"></span>[2](#fn_71.md)

Not only when the tradition, tracing the origin of the Yezidis as a
race, asserts that, as a religious body, they come from a very ancient
time; but also when it speaks of them as a nation, it points out their
antiquity. On this latter, as well as on the former point, their book
and their oral tradition agree. The Yezidis are said to have sprung from
a noble personage, the King of Peace, whose name was Na-‘umi, but whom
they now call Melek-Miran. <span id="fr_73"></span>[3](#fn_72.md) The rest
of mankind, however, are from the seed of Ham, who

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

mocked his father. Whom they signified by Na-‘umi or Miran it is hard to
say; but it is likely that they regard him as one of the other two sons
of Noah. They claim also that the ancient Assyrian kings were members of
their race, and that some of the Persian, Roman and Jewish kings were
appointed for them by Melek Ṭâ‘ûs. They likewise seem to trace their
origin to the prophets and other personages of the Old Testament; as
Seth, Enoch, Noah, etc. Their religion furthermore, they assert,
antedates Christ. <span id="fr_74"></span>[4](#fn_73.md)

There is still another tradition that traces the devil-worshippers to a
different origin. I refer to the statement which Masehaf Reš makes
regarding Mu‘awiya, Mohammed's servant. <span
id="fr_75"></span>[5](#fn_74.md) Mu‘awiya was asked by his master to shave
his head. While performing the duty, he cut the prophet's scalp, and
began to lick the bleeding spot. When he was told that this act would
result in his giving birth to a nation which would oppose the followers
of his master, Mu‘awiya declared that he would not marry. He was
afterwards, however, bitten by a serpent, and was told that he would die
unless he married. He therefore consented to marry, but chose an old
woman in order not to have children. But she miraculously became a young
woman of twenty-five. And from her the God Yezid was born. The story, of
course, is a myth, and it is of such a nature that no historic fact can
be derived from it. It is further complicated by the fact that this
Yezid is [identified](errata.htm#8.md) with Melek Ṭâ‘ûs; and, in another
myth, is represented in form as being half angel and half

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

nun and as remaining a bachelor long after the marriage of Adam He was,
however, finally possessed of a desire to marry, and, unable to marry a
mortal's daughter, being himself half angel, sought the assistance of
Melek Ṭâ‘ûs, who presented to him an ḥouri, and from this union there
sprang a pious people, the Yezidis.

But the devil-worshippers have still another story, which goes to show
that Yezid bn Mu‘awiya is not their founder. This myth asserts that they
are the progeny of Adam's son who was married to Eve's daughter; that
the descendants continued worshiping God and Melek Ṭâ‘ûs without
bringing a foreign element into their religion; and that, at first, the
sect did not bear the name Yezidis, which, in their own opinion, is a
comparatively new appellative. As to how they came to be called by this
new name, it is explained that when, in the course of time, some
corruption entered the Yezidi religion, there arose a certain Calif by
the name of Yezid who wrought miracles. Since then, his followers have
been called Yezidis. This Yezid, it is said, is the son of Mu‘awiya bn
Sufian, and his mother was of Christian origin. To accomplish his
desire, bn Mu‘awiya went to Šeiḫ ‘Adî, who was a learned and devout but
cunning person, and had instituted a religious innovation. Yezid, the
tradition continues, learned ‘Adî's religion and taught it to his
followers; and, from that time on, the sect came to be called after
him. <span id="fr_76"></span>[6](#fn_75.md) But while some, considering
this legend as authoritative, venerate

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

the man bearing the name, others deny all connection with him. <span
id="fr_77"></span>[7](#fn_76.md)

The testimony of some travellers offers another explanation of the
origin of the sect in question, an account which has perhaps more
historical significance than the preceding theories. It is stated that
the Yezidis have a tradition to the effect that they came from Baṣrah
and from the country watered by the lower part of the Euphrates; that
after their emigration they first settled in Syria, and subsequently
took possession of the Sinjar Hill and the district now inhabited in
Kurdistan. As to the date of their settlement in Mesopotamia, no
positive information can be obtained. Some scholars infer that it took
place about the time of Tamerlane, toward the end of the fourteenth
century. <span id="fr_78"></span>[8](#fn_77.md) It is related that the
devil-worshippers hold that, among their own number, the ancient name
for God is Azd, and from it the name of the sect is derived; <span
id="fr_79"></span>[9](#fn_78.md) that the conviction that they are Yezidis,
*i.e.*, God's people, has been their consolation and comfort through the
ages in their tribulations; <span id="fr_80"></span>[10](#fn_79.md) and
that they have taken many religious observances from different
bodies--Mohammedans, Christians, Jews, Pagan Arabs, Shiites, and
Sabaians.

Besides these different explanations of the origin of the
devil-worshippers as descendants of Adam, of Yezîd bn Mu‘awiya, as being
of the colony from the north, as taking their name from Azd, God, there
is another account. I refer to a myth which is current among the people
of Seistan, an eastern province of

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Persia, where
there are a considerable number of these Shaitan parasts (devil
worshippers):

"In former times there existed a prophet named Ḥanalalah, whose life was
prolonged to the measure of a thousand years. He was their ruler and
benefactor; and as by his agency, their flocks gave birth to lambs and
kids miraculously once a week, though ignorant of the use of money,
they, with much gratitude to him, procured all the comforts of life. At
length, however, he died, and was succeeded by his son, whom Šatan,
presuming on his inexperience, empted to sin by entering a large
mulberry tree, when he addressed the successor of Ḥanalalah, and called
on him to worship the prince of darkness. Astonished, yet unshaken, the
youth resisted the temptation. But the miracle proved too much for the
constancy of his flock, who now began to turn to the worship of the
devil. The young prophet, enraged at this, seized An axe and a saw, and
prepared to cut down the tree. He was arrested in this by the appearance
of a human being, who exclaimed, 'Rash boy, desist! Turn to me and let
us wrestle for the victory. If you conquer, then fell the tree!

"The prophet contended and vanquished his opponent, who, however, bought
his own safety and that of the tree by the promise of a large weekly
treasure. After seven days the holy victor again visited the tree to
claim the gold or fell it to the ground; but Satan persuaded him to
hazard another struggle on the promise that, if he conquered again, the
amount

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

should be doubled. This second encounter proved fatal to the youth. He
was put to death by his spiritual antagonist, and the result confirmed
the tribes over whom he had ruled in their worship of the tree and its
tutelary demon." <span id="fr_81"></span>[11](#fn_80.md)

According to this legend, the Šatan parasts are the victims of their
young prophet who, as long as he was actuated by a disinterested zeal
for religion, was victorious over the principle of evil; but failed as
soon as that zeal gave place to a sordid cupidity for earthly treasure.

I have dwelt upon the superstitious theories of the Yezidis themselves
regarding their religious origin, not because these theories have an
importance in themselves, but because of their bearing upon the views
advanced by modern scholars. The scholars have based their theories on
some of these conflicting stories without sufficient criticism. I shall
dwell upon this more at length later on.
