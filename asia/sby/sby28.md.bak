# CHAPTER III

# OTHER DEITIES AND FESTIVALS

### I

### THE SO-CALLED SEVEN DIVINITIES

Besides their great saint, the Yezidis believe in seven other šeiḫs
through whose intermediation they invoke God. These are also deified and
assigned places of honor at Šeiḫ ‘Adî's side. In their case as in that
of their chief, the tradition has led some critics to believe that they
are archangels; others, different attributes of God; and still others,
the seven Amshaps of Zoroaster, or immortal spirits of the Avesta. The
last conjecture is made by Victor Dingelstadt. <span
id="fr_152"></span>[1](#fn_151.md) Cholsohn goes a step further in making
the assertion, "Der Tempel des sheikh Shams ist ohne allen Zweifel ein
sonnentempel der so gebaut ist, dass die ernsten Strahlen der sonne so
hàufig als möglich auf ihn fallen." The ground for this positive
statement is, we are told "Layard berichtet." <span
id="fr_153"></span>[2](#fn_152.md) Now, the English scholar seems to base
his contention on the fact that the building is called the sanctuary of
Šeiḫ Šams; that the herd of white oxen which are slain on great
festivals at Šeiḫ ‘Adî's M

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

are dedicated to Šams; "that the dedication of the bull to the sun" was
generally recognized in the religious system of the ancients, which
probably originated in Assyria; and that the Yezidis may have
unconsciously preserved a myth of their ancestors. <span
id="fr_154"></span>[3](#fn_153.md) To my mind the ground for such a view is
the apriori assumption that the religion of the devil-worshippers is the
remnant of an ancient cult, and that every phenomenon in it is to be
regarded, therefore, a survival of the past system. For certain reasons
I hold that such is not the case.

One reason, as Badger rightly remarks, the Yezidis so designate the
place for the sake of brevity, is the entablature over the doorway
records the name in full, "Sheikh Shams Ali Beg and Faris." Two persons
are mentioned in the inscription. <span id="fr_155"></span>[4](#fn_154.md)
In like manner, the word Šams frequently enters into the construction of
Mohammedan names. The most celebrated one that bore this name was Šams
u-d-Din of Tabriz, the friend and spiritual guide of Jalal ad-Din, who
flourished during the first half of the 13th century of our era.

Moreover, round about the tomb of Šeiḫ ‘Adî are many such abandoned
shrines, each of which is dedicated to a similar deified šeiḫ. Many of
these šeiḫs are known to be historical personages. Take for example,
Šeiḫ ‘Abd al-Ḳadir of Gilan. He is Šeiḫ Muḥiyyu d Din ‘Abd al Ḳadir of
Gilan in Persia, the founder of the Ḳadiri order of dervishes. He was
born in A. H. 471 (A. D. 1078-9) and died

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> A. H. 516 (A. D.
1164-5). So also Šeiḫ. Ḳaḍib al-Ban. He was from Mosul, and was a
contemporary of Šeiḫ ‘Adî. In giving the life of Muḥi ad Din
al-Šharnozuri, Ibn Ḫallikan (v. 2,651) says, "His corpse was removed to
a mausoleum built for its reception outside the Maidan Gate of Mosul,
near the tomb of Ḳadib al-Ban, the celebrated worker of miracles."
Further, Manṣur al-Ḥallaj was a celebrated mystic, revered as a saint by
the more advanced sufis. He was put to death with great cruelty at
Bagdad in A. H. 309 (A. D. 921-2) on a charge of heresy and blasphemy,
because he had said in one of his ecstacies, "Ana-l-Ḥaḳḳ, I am the
truth, God." All biographers of sufi saints speak of him with
admiration.

There are still others who are mentioned even among the seven šeiḫs
enumerated in the principal prayer. Šeiḫ Ḥasan (written also Šeiḫisin)
was from Baṣrah. He was a celebrated theologian and died in A. D. 728.
His life is given by Ibn Ḫallikan. He was noted for self-mortification,
fear of God and devotion. And Faḫr ad-Din is ibn Abd Allah Mohammed Ibn
Amar al-Ḥaṣain Ibn al-Haṣan, Ibn ‘Ali Al-Taim al-Bakri al-Taberstani
ar-kai-zi (native of Kai in Tabarestan), surnamed Faḫr ad-Din (glory of
faith). He was a doctor of the Shafite sect, a pearl of his age, a man
without a peer. He surpassed all his contemporaries in scholastic
theology, and preached both in Arabic and Persian. He would draw floods
of tears from his eyes. His virtues and merits were boundless, He was
born at Kai, 25th of

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ramadan, A. H. 54D
(A. D. 1150), and died at Ḥerat, the first of Shawal, A. H. 606 (March
A. D. 1210). (See ibn Ḫallikan in loco.)

In the light of these facts, I conclude, then, that those who cannot be
identified--for many bear the same name, and we do not know which is
which--are also historical personages.

This is what I mean by the statement that in order to yield satisfactory
results the inductive method must be supported by historical
investigations.

In a question like this, however, the philosophical method also, when
carried on critically, may yield a satisfactory result. Accordingly,
observations should be made in the sphere of religious consciousness.
Now one of the characteristics of the human mind is the tendency to defy
man. This is shown in the titles which men gave to their superiors. In
the Tell-al-Amarna tablets, we find various kinglets of Syria, in
writing to the king of Egypt, address him as "my gods" (ilani-ia). Thus
Abimilki of Tyre writes: "To my lord, the king, my son, my god." What is
more, a superhuman character is attributed to the dead. This appears
from the attitude which the primitive mind entertained towards the
deceased. At first, the relation to the dead was hostile, hence their
spirits were feared. Gradually, the relation became familiar, so that
their association was sought and sacrifices and gifts were offered to
them. They came to be looked upon as elohim, who knew the future events.
Thus we find that in the Old Testament, worship was

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

offered to the dead, and that the tombs of ancestors and heroes
frequently appear as places of worship, as, *e.g.*, the grave of Miriam
at Kadish (Num. 26: 1). Even to-day tombs of saints are common in
Arabia, and thousands of people visit them annually to ask the
intercession of the saints. Likewise, the Nuṣairiyeh of Syria have
deified ‘Ali, the Drus their chief Hakim, the Babis their Beha, and the
Christians their saints. <span id="fr_156"></span>[5](#fn_155.md) We
cannot, therefore, be surprised that the Yezidis have defined their
šeiḫs and heroes. They have only shown that common trait of the
mind--the tendency to deify man.

It is to be noticed, further, that in the historical development of
religions we find that when the stage of the mere belief in spirits is
past, individual deities stand out from the great mass of the spirits,
and these are plainly imagined to be personal gods, such as Astarte and
Ba‘al by the side of Hadad and Aschirat. <span
id="fr_157"></span>[6](#fn_156.md) Now this is practically what we find in
the evolution of modern Yezidism. Out of many šeiḫs and murids, seven,
next to šeiḫ ‘Adî, stand out as individual [divinities](errata.htm#19.md).

Yearly festivals in honor of these šeiḫs are commemorated in April at
different villages with the same rites as those observed at Šeiḫ ‘Adî's
tomb. Lamps are nightly lighted and left to burn in the shacks called
after the names of their respective kits; and in those to which a room
is attached, ḳawwals assemble at sunset every Tuesday and Thursday, when
they burn

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

incense over each tomb; and after watching a short time, and smoking
their pipes, they return home.

An interesting festival is that of Šeiḫ Mohammed, celebrated by the
people of Ba‘šiḳa, where his tomb exists. They say that they are
solemnizing the nuptials of Šeiḫ Mohammed, whom they believe to be
married once a year. The men and women dance together while the ḳawwals
play on their flutes and tambourines. They bring Melek Ṭâ’ûs in
procession from Baḥazanie to Ba‘šiḳa amid rejoicing and sound of music:
Two pirs precede the bearer of the sacred peacock, carrying in their
hands lighted candles which they move to and fro. As they pass along the
bystanders bow in adoration and, immersing their hands in the smoke,
perfume with it their arms and faces. They carry the image of Melek
Ṭâ’ûs to the house of the one who is the highest bidder for the honor of
entertaining it. Here it remains two days, during which all profane
festivals are suspended and visits are paid to it.
