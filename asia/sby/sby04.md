### PREFACE

*In the Name of the Most Compassionate God*!

With the help of the Most High God, and under his direction, we write
the history of the Yezidis, their doctrines, and the mysteries of their
religion, as contained in their books, which reached our hand with their
own knowledge and consent

In the time of Al-Muḳtadir Billah, A. H. 295 <span
id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md), there lived Manṣûr-al-Ḥallâj, <span
id="fr_31"></span>[2](#fn_31) the [wool](errata.htm#0.md)-carder, and Šeiḫ
‘Abd-al-Ḳâdir of Jîlân. <span id="fr_32"></span>[3](#fn_32.md) At that
time, too, there appeared a man by the name of Šeiḫ ‘Adî, from the
mountain of Hakkari, <span id="fr_33"></span>[4](#fn_33.md) originally from
the region of Aleppo or Baalbek. He came and dwelt in Mount Lališ, <span
id="fr_34"></span>[5](#fn_34.md) near the city of Mosul, about nine hours
distant from it Some say he was of the people of Ḥarrân, and related to
Marwân ibn-al-Ḥakam. His full name is Šaraf ad-Dîn Abû-l-Fadâîl, ‘Adî bn
Musâfir bn Ismael bn Mousa bn Marwân bn Al-Ḥasan bn Marwân. He died A.
H. 558 (A. D. 1162-63). His tomb is still visited; it is near Ba‘adrei,
one of the villages of Mosul, distant eleven hours. The Yezidis are the
progeny of those who were the *murids* (disciples) of Šeiḫ ‘Adî. Some
trace their origin to Yezid, <span id="fr_35"></span>[6](#fn_35.md) others
to Ḥasan-Al-Baṣrî <span id="fr_36"></span>[7](#fn_36.md).
