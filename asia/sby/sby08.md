### CHAPTER III

I lead to the straight path without a revealed book; I direct aright my
beloved and my chosen ones by unseen means. All my teachings are easily
applicable to all times and all conditions. I punish in another world
all who do contrary to my will. Now the sons of Adam do not know the
state of things that is to come. For this reason they fall into many
errors. The beasts of the earth, the birds of heaven, and the fish of
the sea are all under the control of my hands. All treasures and hidden
things are known to me; and as I desire, I take them from one and bestow
them upon another. I reveal my wonders to those who seek them, and, in
due time my miracles to those who receive them from me. But those who
are without are my adversaries, hence they oppose me. Nor do they know
that such a course is against their own interests, for might, wealth,
and riches are in my hand, and I bestow them upon every worthy
descendant of Adam. Thus the government of the worlds, the transition of
generations, and the changes of their directors are determined by me
from the beginning.
