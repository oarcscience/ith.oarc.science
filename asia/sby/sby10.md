### CHAPTER V

O ye that have believed in me, honor my symbol and my image, for they
remind you of me. Observe my laws and statutes. Obey my servants and
listen to whatever they may dictate to you of the hidden things. Receive
that that is dictated, and do not carry it before those who are without,
Jews, Christians, Moslems, and others; for they know not the nature of
my teaching. Do not give them your books, lest they alter them without
your knowledge. Learn by heart the greater part of them, lest they be
altered.

Thus endeth the book of Al-Jilwah, which is followed by the book of
Maṣḥaf Reš, *i.e.*, the Black Book.
