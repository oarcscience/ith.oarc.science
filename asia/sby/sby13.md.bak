### THE POEM IN PRAISE OF ŠEIḪ ‘ADÎ

*Peace Be unto Him*

My understanding surrounds the truth of things,  
And my truth is mixed up in me,  
And the truth of my descent is set forth by itself,  
And when it was known it was altogether in me.  
And all that are in the universe are under me,  
And all the habitable parts and deserts,  
And everything created is under me,  
And I am the ruling power preceding all that exists.  
And I am he that spoke a true saying,  
And I am the just judge and the ruler of the earth.  
And I am he that men worship in my glory,  
Coming to me and kissing my feet.  
And I am he that spread over the heavens their height.  
And I am he that cried in the beginning.  
And I am he that of myself revealeth all things,  
And I am he to whom came the book of good tidings  
From my Lord, who burneth the mountains.  
And I am he to whom all created men come  
In obedience to kiss my feet.  
I bring forth fruit from the first juice of early youth  
By my presence, and turn toward me ray disciples.  
And before this light the darkness of the morning cleared away.  
I guide him that asketh for guidance.  
I am he that caused Adam to dwell in Paradise  
And Nimrod to inhabit a hot burning fire. <span id="page_71">p.
71</span>  
And I am he that guided Ahmed the just,  
And let him into my path and way.  
And I am he unto whom all creatures  
Come for my good purposes and gifts.  
And I am he that visited all the heights,  
And goodness and charity proceed from my mercy.  
And I am he that made all hearts to fear  
My purpose, and they magnify the majesty and power of my awfulness.  
And I am he to whom the destroying lion came  
Raging, and I shouted against him. and he became stone.  
And I am he to whom the serpent came,  
And by my will I made him dust.  
And I am he that struck the rock and made it tremble,  
And made to burst from its sides the sweetest of waters. <span
id="fr_64"></span>[36](#fn_64.md)  
And I am he that sent down the certain truth;  
For me is the book that comforteth the oppressed.  
And I am he that judged justly,  
And when I judged it was my right  
And I am he that made the springs <span id="fr_65"></span>[36](#fn_64.md)
to give water,  
Sweeter and pleasanter than all waters.  
And I am he that caused it to appear in my mercy,  
And by my power I called it the pure.  
And I am he to whom the Lord of heaven hath said,  
Thou art the just judge and Ruler of the earth.  
And I am he that disclosed some of my wonders,  
And some of my virtues are manifested in that which exists.  
And I am he that caused the mountains to bow,  
To move under me and at my will. <span id="fr_66"></span>[37](#fn_65.md)  
And I am he before whose majesty the wild beasts cried;  
They turned to me worshiping, and kissed my feet.  
And I am ‘Adî aš-Šâmî, the son of Musâfir. <span id="page_72">p.
72</span>  
Verily the All-Merciful has assigned unto me names,  
The heavenly throne, and the seat, and the (seven) heavens, and the
earth.  
In the secret of my knowledge there is no God but me.  
These things are subservient to my power.  
O mine enemies, why do you deny me?  
O men, deny me not, but submit.  
In the day of judgment you will be happy in meeting me.  
Who dies in my love, I will cast him  
In the midst of Paradise, by my will and pleasure;  
But he that dies unmindful of me  
Will be thrown into torture in misery and affliction.  
I say I am the only one and the exalted;  
I create and make rich those whom I will.  
Praise it to myself, for all things are by my will,  
And the universe is lighted by some of my gifts.  
I am the king that magnifies himself,  
And all the riches of creation are at my bidding.  
I have made known unto you, O people, some of my ways.  
Who desireth me must forsake the world.  
And I can also speak the true saying,  
And the garden on high is for those who do my pleasure.  
I sought the truth and became a confirming truth;  
And by the like truth shall they, like myself, possess the highest
place.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[71:36](sby13.htm#fr_65.md) That is the spring of
Šeiḫ ‘Adî.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[71:37](sby13.htm#fr_66.md) The reference is to
Jabal Maḳlûb, which, according to the Yezidi belief, moved from its
place near Lališ to enable every Yezidi, wherever he may be, to direct
his morning prayers toward the, tomb of ‘Adî.
