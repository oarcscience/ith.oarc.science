### SOME OTHER RELIGIOUS PRACTICES

Fasting is one of the religious observances. It is kept for three
successive days in the month of December, when they profess to
commemorate the death of Yezid. Some observe also the forty days' fast
in the spring of the year, when the Eastern Christians celebrate the
memory of Christ's abstinence from food at the time of his temptation in
the wilderness. One person in a family may fast for the rest. During
this period fasters abstain from animal food. The chief

šeiḫ fasts rigidly one month in the year, eating only once in
twenty-four hours and immediately after sunset.

Prayer is not considered a religious duty. They never pray; they do not
even have a form of prayer, and acknowledge that they do not pray. It is
said that when Šeiḫ ‘Adî came from Mecca, he told his followers in one
of his sermons: "God commanded me to tell you that there is no need of
prayer; believe in the power of Melek Ṭâ’ûs and ye shall be saved." They
have, however, what is called morning recital, which the devout among
them mutters in Kurdish as he rises up from his bed. It is as follows:

"*Chand-il-manhatie sobayaka rošh halatie. Hatna mesarmen dou jaladie,
meskino raba. Beda šade šada dina mize eik Allah melek šeih-sin Habib
Allah maḳlub al-mergie ṣalaḥ maḳlub w-mergie al-jem's, ṣalaḥ Al-bani
ma-ieh al-jem’sieh wal jot ḳuobaieh Kwa-šamsi Tauris wal-Fahra-Dinn,
washeikho Pir. Kawata deira sor, hanpouteka deira chankulie wa-Kabri
Zaman wa-ahro douni, Amin*." <span id="fr_163"></span>[4](#fn_162)

"How often two executioners came upon me as the morning sun arose. O
poor man, stand up and bear witness! Witness for my religion. God is
one; the angel Šeiḫ ‘Adî and upon his congregation; upon the great shack
and the shack of šeiḫ Tauris and Faḫr ad-Din and to every šeiḫ and pir,
and the power of Deir Zor and Deir Chankalie (two Christian
monasteries), and the grave of time (mysterious power), and the Last
Day."
