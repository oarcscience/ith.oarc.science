### LOCALITY

The Yezidis dwell principally in five districts, the most prominent
among these being that of Šeiḫan. This term is the Persian plural of
šeiḫ, an old man; and it signifies the country where šeiḫs dwell. This
district lies northeast of Mosul, covering a wide area in which are many
villages. It is their Palestine. In it lies their Mecca, Lalish, where
their sacred shrine, the tomb of Šeiḫ ‘Adî, is. Lališh is the centre of
their national and religious life. It is situated in a deep, picturesque
valley. Its slopes are covered with a dense wood, and at the bottom of
it runs the sacred water. Other notable places here are the two
adjoining villages, Ba‘ašiḳa and Baḥazanie, at the foot of the mountain
of Rabban Hormuzd, a six hours' ride from Mosul. The former is the
center of the tombs of their šeiḫs; the latter is their principal burial
place, to which bodies are carried from all the various districts. It
was formerly a Christian village with a monastery. And Ba‘adrie,
northeast of the City of Mosul, about ten hours' ride away, is the
village where their amir resides. It is close to Šeiḫ ‘Adî's.

Next in importance is Jabal Sinjar. The term "Sinjar" is Persian,
meaning a bird, perhaps an eagle. It signifies that its inhabitants are,
like the eagle, safe and cannot be caught. <span

miles long and nine miles broad, rising in the midst of the desert. From
its summit, the eye ranges on one side over the vast level wilderness
stretching to the Euphrates, and on the other over the plain bounded by
the Tigris and the lofty mountains of Kurdistan. Nisibin and Mardin are
both visible in the distance. One can see the hills of Ba‘adrie and Šeiḫ
‘Adî. Among the sacred places of this district are two villages: Assofa,
where two ziarahs are found, and distinguished from afar by their white
spires, and Aldina, where one ziarah exists. In almost every Sinjar
village, there is to be found a covered water which they use as a
fortress during their fights with the Kurds or with the Turkish army.
The devil-worshippers of this locality are commonly called Yezidis,
while those of Šeiḫan are known both as Yezidis and Dawaseni.

Another district is Ḫalitiyeh, which includes all the territory north
and northeast of the Tigris in the province of Diarbeker. The Malliyeh
region includes all the territory west of the Euphrates and Aleppo. And.
the Saraḥdar section includes the Caucasus in southern Russia. Some
regard the Lepchos of India also as Yezidis, who, in the early
appearance of the sect, went there to proselyte the Hindoos. <span
