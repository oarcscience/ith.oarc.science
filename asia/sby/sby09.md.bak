### CHAPTER IV

I will not give my rights to other gods. I have allowed the creation of
four substances, four times, and four comers; because they are necessary
things for creatures. The books of Jews, Christians, and Moslems, as of
those who are without, accept in a sense, *i.e.*, so far as they agree
with, and conform to, my statutes. Whatsoever is contrary to these they
have altered; do not accept it. Three things are against me, and I hate
three things. But those who keep my secrets shall receive the fulfilment
of my promises. Those who suffer for my sake I will surely reward in one
of the worlds. It is my desire that all my followers shall unite in a
bond of unity, lest those who are without prevail against them. Now,
then, all ye who have followed my commandments and my teachings, reject
all the teachings and sayings of such as are without. I have not taught
these teachings, nor do they proceed from me. Do not mention my name nor
my attributes, lest ye regret it; for ye do not know what those who are
without may do.
