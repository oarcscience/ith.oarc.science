### CHAPTER I

I was, am now, and shall have no end. I exercise dominion over all
creatures and over the affairs of all who are under the protection of my
image. I am ever present to help all who trust in me and call upon me in
time of need. There is no place in the universe that knows not my
presence. I participate in all the affairs which those who are without
call evil because their nature is not such as they approve. Every age
has its own manager, who directs affairs according to my decrees. This
office is changeable from generation to generation, that the ruler of
this world and his chiefs may discharge the duties of their respective
offices every one in his own turn. I allow everyone to follow the
dictates of his own nature, but he that opposes me will regret it
sorely. No god has a right to interfere in my affairs, and I have made
it an imperative rule that everyone shall refrain from worshiping all
gods. All the books of those who are without are altered by them; and
they have declined from them, although they were written by the prophets
and the apostles. That there are interpolations is seen in the fact that
each sect endeavors to prove that the others are wrong and to destroy
their books. To me truth and falsehood are known. When temptation

comes, I give my covenant to him that trusts in me. Moreover, I give
counsel to the skilled directors, for I have appointed them for periods
that are known to me. I remember necessary affairs and execute them in
due time. I teach and guide those who follow my instruction. If anyone
obey me and conform to my commandments, he shall have joy, delight, and
goodness.
