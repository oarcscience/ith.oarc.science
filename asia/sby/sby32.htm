<p>Fasting is one of the religious observances. It is kept for three successive days in the month of December, when they profess to commemorate the death of Yezid. Some observe also the forty days' fast in the spring of the year, when the Eastern Christians celebrate the memory of Christ's abstinence from food at the time of his temptation in the wilderness.

<p>Prayer is not considered a religious duty. They never pray; they do not even have a form of prayer, and acknowledge that they do not pray. It is said that when &#352;ei&#7723; &#145;Ad&icirc; came from Mecca, he told his followers in one of his sermons: "God commanded me to tell you that there is no need of prayer; believe in the power of Melek &#7788;&acirc;&#146;&ucirc;s and ye shall be saved." They have, however, what is called morning recital, which the devout among them mutters in Kurdish as he rises up from his bed. It is as follows:</p>  
<p>"<i>Chand-il-manhatie sobayaka ro&#353;h halatie. Hatna mesarmen dou jaladie, meskino raba. Beda &#353;ade &#353;ada dina mize eik Allah melek &#353;eih-sin Habib Allah ma&#7731;lub al-mergie &#7779;ala&#7717; ma&#7731;lub w-mergie al-jem's, &#7779;ala&#7717; Al-bani ma-ieh al-jem&#146;sieh wal jot &#7731;uobaieh Kwa-&#353;amsi Tauris wal-Fahra-Dinn, washeikho Pir.

<p>"How often two executioners came upon me as the morning sun arose. O poor man, stand up and bear witness! Witness for my religion. God is one; the angel &#352;ei&#7723; &#145;Ad&icirc; and upon his congregation; upon the great shack and the shack of &#353;ei&#7723; Tauris and Fa&#7723;r ad-Din and to every &#353;ei&#7723; and pir, and the power of Deir Zor and Deir Chankalie (two Christian monasteries), and the grave of time (mysterious power), and the Last Day."</p>
