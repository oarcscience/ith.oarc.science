### AL-JILWAH (THE REVELATION)

Before all creation this revelation was with Melek Ṭâ’ûs, who sent ‘Abd
Ṭâ’ûs to this world that he might separate truth known to his particular
people.

This was done, first of all, by means of oral tradition, and afterward
by means of this book, Al-Jilwah, which the outsiders may neither read
nor behold.
