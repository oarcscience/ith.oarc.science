### NATIONALITY

Four different theories have been advanced as to the face to which the
Yezidis belong. There are those who think them to be of Indo-European
origin, for there is a type among them that has a white skin, a round
skull, blue eyes and light hair. And there are those who suppose them to
be Arabs on the ground that the color of skin of another type is brown,
their eyes are wide, their lips are thick and their hair is dark. The
western writers, moreover, have in the past always taken them for Kurds
because of the close resemblance of the two in appearance and manners.
In his "La Turquie d’Asie,"' Vitol Cunet says that though the Yezidis
have been taken for Kurds, they can no longer be regarded as such, for
in many ways they resemble other nationalities. On the other hand
Hormuzd Rassam, in his "Asshur and the Land of Nimrud" seems to agree
with those who suppose them to be of Assyrian origin. He bases this
inference on the independent and martial spirit which they possess, and
their tendency to rebel against their oppressors, which, according to
him, may be taken as an indication of ancestral inheritance. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_163"></span>[194:1](sby37.htm#fr_164.md) <span
id="page_200">p. 200</span> In his letter to me, of date August 6, 1907,
the Rev. A. N. Andrus, of Mardin, expresses the opinion that "many of
the Yezidis around ’Sinjar might have come from Indian stock" on the
ground that "they are darker and more lithe than the Kurds around them."
