### Chapter XXI

1\. WHEN the ceremonies were ended, Onesyi said: Soon, now, in the name
of the Father will we rise and go a long journey; and that ye may be
apprised and consorted in love, I proclaim the freedom of the hour in
Jehovih's name.

2\. And the people went and mingled with each other, rejoicing and
saluting. And Ha'jah and God and Etisyai greeted one another, and the
Lords came forward, and were also greeted; and then the marshals and the
es'enaurs and all long-serving laborers. And lastly, all that had
redeemed any man or woman from darkness to light, came also, and were
saluted and duly honored.

3\. And for the space of one hour all the angels indulged in revelry,
reunion and fullness of heart; but no book could relate the thousandth
part of the questions asked and love assurances expressed.

4\. When the hour was ended, Onesyi signalled the proper officer, and he
sounded the gavel thrice, whereupon all was hushed and still. Onesyi
said:

5\. As Jehovih bestoweth a newborn child, so also doth He take the
father and the mother away to the es world. As Jehovih sent Etisyai, my
sister, to establish the lower heaven, so have I come by His command to
bear hence this harvest to His everlasting kingdom. As a child bewaileth
the loss of its father and mother, so will ye that remain bewail the
loss of this rich harvest of archangels.

6\. It is Jehovih's will that ye drink deep of the sorrow of parting,
for by this bondage will ye be again reunited in the heavens still
above. The progress of the soul of man is forever onward, and in steps
and plateaux; and the glory of the resurrection of him that goeth before
is equally great as is the sorrow of him that remaineth behind. But the
love that bindeth together is as a chain outstretched across the
universe; nor time nor distance shall prevail against the inventions
thereof.

7\. Swift messengers, well trained to course the vault of heaven, will
pass between you, carrying the tidings of your soul's delight. And as
Jehovih giveth summer to follow winter, and the winter the summer, so
also shall the time again and again, forever, in which ye shall mingle
and part; again labor together, but in broader fields, and again part
for a season.

8\. Behold the wisdom of Jehovih in placing far apart the places of the
souls of men; for all things abiding near together equalize themselves.
Even as there is glory in a new birth, so is there glory in death; as
there is sorrow in death, so is there joy in resurrection. The time is
now come when these that ye see, ye shall not see for a long season; but
ye shall rejoice in this hour of parting, for they rise as Brides and
Bridegrooms to Jehovih.

9\. The es'enaurs sang an anthem of praise in which all the hosts
united, and great was the glory thereof. And now Onesyi arose, saying:

10\. JEHOVIH, ALMIGHTY AND EVERLASTING! HOLY, HOLY CREATOR, RULER AND
GIVER FORTH! LOOK UPON THIS THY SON, HA'JAH! O FATHER, IN THY NAME AND
BY VIRTUE OF THY POWER IN ME VESTED, DO I PERPETUATE AND CROWN HIM GOD
OF HEAVEN AND EARTH!

11\. Ha'jah, now God, said: THY WILL BE DONE, O JEHOVIH! Then Onesyi
turned to the five chief Lords of the five divisions of the earth, and
bestowed them in like manner.

12\. And Onesyi stretched forth her hand, saying: Give me a crown, O
Jehovih, for Thy Son, God of heaven and <span id="page_41">p. 41</span>
earth! And there descended etherean substance into her hand, and she
raised it up, and lo, it became a crown of great beauty, and she put in
on God's (Ha'jah's) head. Then in like manner did she crown the Lords of
the earth.

13\. And Etisyai and Onesyi came down and sat at the foot of the throne.

14\. God (that had been Ha'jah) came down and Whaga and Jud with him,
and stretching forth their hands, they said to Etisyai, Onesyi and
Sethantes, the retiring God:

|                   |     |                 |
|-------------------|-----|-----------------|
| Arise, O Goddess, | }   |                 |
| Arise, O Goddess, |     | and go thy way! |
| Arise, O God,     |     |                 |

 

15\. And they rose up and marched forth. The proper officers had already
prepared the ship for its etherean journey; and soon as Etisyai and
Onesyi had entered the central star, all the people that were to ascend
went into the places assigned to them.

16\. God (that had been Ha'jah) and the Lords returned, in tears, to the
throne, and now the plateau of everlasting light began to ascend. Music
sprang from every side, glorifying Jehovih and the magnificence of His
bountiful worlds.

17\. And those of the lower heaven were as the echo of the music above;
and the light of the ascending ship of fire made all else as a shadow.
But higher and higher it arose, in the form of a crescent, slowly
turning on its upright axis, turning and rising, higher and higher, and
the music faded away in the distance.

18\. In a little while the meteor-like ascending ship of heaven looked
like a star, till farther and farther off it disappeared in the
distance.

19\. Thus ascended to the emancipated heavens in etherea the first
harvest of angels born of the earth.
