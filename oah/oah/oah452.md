### VED.

1\. SING to the Almighty, ye heirs of Zarathustra, whose flesh was the
food of lions.

2\. Sing to the Creator, Zarathustra's Almighty, the Eolin that spake in
the wind.

3\. Sing to the followers of the Great Spirit! The Zarathustrians who
forfeited their flesh and blood for Him.

4\. Sound loud His name, the E-O-Ih of the Zarathustrians, that sang Him
on high!
