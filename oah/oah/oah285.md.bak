### Chapter XIX

Of the hosts of Osiris, the false.

1\. NOW sallied forth the captains, generals, and well-disciplined hosts
of hada, the angels of De'yus, bent on independence to the earth and
heaven from all other rulers save the Lord God, and to establish him
forever. Foremost of the three mighty divisions was Osiris' army, of
more than a thousand million angels, going boldly forth to cover the
great lands of the earth, Arabin'ya, Parsi'e and Heleste.

2\. In the front, dashing madly on, was Baal, and next him, his
assistant Goddess, Ashtaroth, followed by their first attendants and
high exalted officers. Some of whom displayed great maps of mortal
cities and cultured lands, where the peaceful worshippers of Jehovih
dwelt, hundreds of thousands. And the lists of altars and temples to the
Great Spirit, where the righteous came daily and deposited their
earnings and products as sacrifices for benefit of the weak and
helpless. And the wide fields, where toilers brought out of the earth,
religiously, wheat, and flax, and cotton, and barley, as gifts from the
Great Spirit. And the canals, filled with boats, carrying produce, and
fruit, and cloth, in interchange, one district with another. And the
mounds and tree-temples of the I'hins, the sacred people, small, white
and yellow; the forefathers and foremothers of the great I'huan race,
the half-breeds, betwixt the brown burrowers in the earth and the
I'hins.

3\. Over these maps, and charts, and lists, the generals and captains
discoursed as they descended to the rolling earth; most learnedly laying
plans to overturn Jehovih's method, and build up De'yus, the God of
Hored.

4.Osiris himself, to display such dignity as becometh a great God,
halted in his heavenly place, and now head-quarters of the belligerents.
And so rested on his throne, with his tens of thousands of messengers
ready to answer his summons and bear his will to the remotest parts of
his mighty army, and to bring him back news in return of the nature of
the proceedings. And betwixt Osiris' and De'yus' thrones another long
line of messengers extended, a thousand angels, high raised and
resolute, suitable to travel in the ever-changing atmospherean belts of
great velocity.

5\. Beside Baal, on the downward course to the earth, but a little
behind him, woman-like, was Ashtaroth, with her thousand attendants, all
accoutered to show their high esteem for their <span id="page_395">p.
395</span> warring Goddess. By the oft-changing wave of her hand, her
part of the army had learned to know her will, and most zealously
observe her commands.

6\. And now, on every side, farther than the eye could see, the thousand
millions rushed on, some in boats, some in ships and otevans, and others
in single groups, descending. As one can imagine an earthly kite
sufficient to carry its holder high up in the wind, so, reversed, and
single-handed, hundreds of thousands flew toward the earth by ballast
flags, the most daring of angels.

7\. Toward the earth they came as if on a frolic, full of jokes and loud
boasting, sworn and swearing to forever clear the earth of Jehovih's
worshippers. Many of them, long trained in schools and colleges and
factories, in heaven, only too glad for a change of scenes and labor,
and all promised by their superiors that now they were to take their
first lessons in becoming Gods and Goddesses. Of whom thousands and
thousands hoped for some daring deed, in order to gain sudden promotion.

8\. To the east and west, and north and south, Baal and Ashtaroth spread
out their armies, wide as the three great lands they had sworn to subdue
unto the Lord God, who, of woman born, was the most presuming son the
earth had yet brought forth. And to alight on the earth, to flood the
temples and altars with so great an abundance of spirits as would drive
Jehovih's ashars into disastrous confusion, and vanquish them, was the
theme and project. To be foremost in so great a work was the temptation
of promotion, which caused them on every side to strive with their
utmost speed and power.

9\. The which Jehovih foresaw, and so spake to God in Craoshivi, warning
him; whereof due observance of the danger had been communicated by
messengers to the managing angels in the altars and temples of worship.
And these again, through the rab'bahs and the oracles, had spread abroad
amongst mortals the threatened dangers, cautioning them.

10\. Thus Jehovih's angels fortified themselves, through the faith of
mortals, and held on, bringing together their scanty numbers, knowing
well that by Jehovih's law they must not resist by arms, but only
through words and good example, high-toned by faith in the Father over
all.

11\. Down, down, down on these, on every side came the destroying hosts,
the thousand millions; with oaths and loud clamor rushing for the altars
and temples; flying suddenly to the holy arcs; in hundreds of thousands
of places, shouting:

12\. Avaunt this arc! Avaunt this altar! Avaunt this temple! Ye Jehovian
usurpers, begone! In the name of the Lord our God! We command!

13\. But alas, for them, every arc, and altar, and temple to Jehovih was
invincible. There stood His angels, so strong in faith, unmoved and
majestic, that even the assailing spirits halted, overawed. And as they
stood a moment, contemplating whence came so great majesty, to be in
such sommon place, the Jehovians made this reply:

14\. To none we bow in adoration but Great Jehovih! Whose Very Self
contributed to make us what we are, His servants in doing good unto
others with all our wisdom and strength! In Him we stand to shield His
helpless ones by virtuous peace and love harmonious. Wherefore, then,
come ye in arrogance, demanding our wards to service of your God, born
of woman?

15\. The Osirians said: Fly, O sycophants! Ye that bow down in fear and
trembling to One hollow as the wind, and Personless. Too long have earth
and heaven been cajoled by far-off foreign Gods, who come hither to win
subjects for their kingdoms' glory, by that pitiful tale of an Ever
Presence Over All, Whom none have seen nor known. Begone! Give us these
earthly anchorages! To build in unit, earth and heaven, to rule
ourselves by Gods we know and reverence!

16\. The Jehovians said: Is this your only power? By threats and
commands? O harmless words, in mockery of truthful Gods! No good works
nor promises, save to exalt the self of earth and hada, and glorify your
masters, born only equal with yourselves. Why not rush in and carry us
off, ye that are a thousand to one, and by your deeds prove the great
source whence ye draw your power?

17\. The Osirians said: To give ye a chance of liberty, to save ye from
the Savior's judgment, Anubi, who shall cast ye into hell, we hoped to
find your willing departure in peace. Behold ye, then, we will wall this
altar around and shut off the attendant ashars with mortals, and flood
the place with drujas, to obsess them to total madness. If, then, ye
love your wards as ye profess, abandon all to us, for the glory of
De'yus, whose son is Osiris, our commanding God.

18\. The Jehovians said: Words! words! words! At first no explanation,
<span id="page_396">p. 396</span> and only your command. Now, forsooth,
an argument! And presently ye will withdraw, deceived in what your
commanding Gods told you would result. We tell you we will not hence,
save by our superiors, Jehovih's, rightly raised to precedence.

19\. The Osirians said: For which reason, behold our Lord God, who was
honored in the title through Jehovih's hand; whom ye should obey
according to your oaths.

20\. The Jehovians said: Till such time the Lord God put aside Jehovih,
we were his; but when for his self-glory he denied his Creator, his
false position freed us from his obligations. To obey him now, would
make us false to Jehovih, and forever weaken us in reaching the
Nirvanian kingdoms.

21\. But now the clamoring angels, Osirians, in the background crowded
forward menacingly, and the tide rose to the highest pitch. The morning
sun was dawning in the east, a most wonderful assistant to Jehovih's
sons in time of battle; and their messengers brought from the fields and
country places many ashars who had been on watch all night with sleeping
mortals. The Osirians saw them coming; knew the turn, one way or
another, was at hand! But by the audacity of the Jehovians, one to a
thousand, were kept looking on in wonder till the sun's rays pierced
their weapons and melted them in their hands.

22\. First one and then another of the Osirians, then tens and hundreds
and thousands, turned away or looked about, discomfited, like a host of
rioters attempting to assault a few well-trained soldiers, and, becoming
affrighted, turn and flee harmlessly. So Jehovih's sons and daughters
won the victory in the first assault, save in rare instances, one in a
hundred, where the Osirians triumphed and got possession.
