<P>1. TWO kinds of voices have I, saith Jehovih: The silent voice and the audible voice.</P>
<P>2. All men I created susceptible to one or the other of My voices, and many to both.</P>
<P>3. One man heareth My voice in the breeze, and in thunder, and in music.</P>
<P>4. One man heareth My voice in the flowers of the field, and in the scenery of the mountains.</P>
<P>5. And yet another feeleth My inspiration; and he skippeth up the mountain side, and tireth not on the way.</P>
<P>6. He that neither seeth nor feeleth My inspiration, goeth up the mountain in great labor.</P>
<P>7. In proportion as man is clear in his corporeality and in his spirit, so discerneth he My inspiration.</P>
<P>8. And if he have great purity as well, then he shapeth my Light into corporeal words.</P>
<P>9. These I taught man to call My revealed words.</P>
<P>10. Nevertheless, no corporeal man created I perfect; neither can any man reveal My words perfectly.</P>
<P>11. But I created the way open unto all men, to try to reveal Me.</P>
<P>12. According to man's approximation to perfect manhood, so reveal I unto him, by My Presence and My words.</P>
<P>13. According to man's imperfection in manhood, so doth not My inspiration manifest on his senses.</P>
<P>14. Perfect manhood created I possible, in equal corporeal and spiritual senses.</P>
<P>15. Strong corporeal senses and weak spiritual senses detract man from My Presence, and make him infidel to My Person.</P>
<P>16. Such a man denieth My inspiration and the inspiration of My angels. He is little more than a forest tree, which hath a trunk and many branches, but moveth not from its place.</P>
