<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">GOD CONTINUETH HIS CHASTISEMENT AGAINST THE FOUR FALSE GODS</FONT>.</P>
<P>1. GOD said: In the name of Jehovih, wherein shall I find an excuse for your behavior?</P>
<P>2. When my angels taught man how to make a capstan and a screw and a telescope and a compass, behold, your emissaries inspired my chosen to be tortured, or put to death.</P>
<P>3. When my angels inspired man to comprehend and announce the glory of the stars and planets, ye put my chosen to death; through your vindictive angels against Jehovih were these things accomplished.</P>
<P>4. When my angels taught man by inspiration that the earth was round instead of flat, ye sent spirits of darkness to inspire the death of my philosophers.</P>
<P>5. Because, forsooth, my inspiration agreed not with the sacred books which ye compounded for your own glory.</P>
<P>6. Yea, ye palmed off your compilations from other false Gods as being Jehovih's; and ye played upon the honest innocence of man's understanding, contrary to the will of the Almighty.</P>
<P>7. Ye have holden your sacred books up, and said: Here is the ultimate; beyond this, no man shall go!</P>
<P>8. And ye knew, the while, that any fixed revelation could not be true, because all the universe is in constant progress.</P>
<P>9. Ye have holden up your own sacred books, and said: Here are rules and a sure guide to reach the all highest heavens!</P>
<P>10. Knowing the while that your heavens were the lowest of the bound heavens of the earth.</P>
<P>11. Now, behold, the same rules apply unto you as to the least of Jehovih's children; which are, that whoso setteth up a mark, with himself as the highest, and he, the interpreter thereof, is already on the downward grade.</P>
<P>12. And whoso seeketh to glorify himself by his kingdoms, or by the magnificence of his possessions, taketh a burden upon his shoulders, that will, soon or late, fall upon him, and crush him.</P>
<P>13. And whoso fortifieth himself by armies, whether in the heavens or on the earth, bindeth himself therewith for his ultimate sorrow.</P>
<P>14. And whoso turneth away from Jehovih, and saith: I will go not after Him, nor search to find Him more; but I will build unto myself, planneth an edifice that will tumble down upon him in time to come.</P>
