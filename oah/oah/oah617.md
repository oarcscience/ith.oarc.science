### Chapter XVI

HOLY VEIL DAY.

1\. AS Jehovih, through His God, pulled aside the veil of heaven,
saying:

2\. Let My angels forth; together shall converse the living and the
dead.

3\. So santified He the day when the angels of heaven were made known to
mortals. (March 31, 1848.)

4\. And He gave the sign, A HAND HOLDING ASIDE A VEIL, signifying,
HEAVEN UNVEILED, as the master's sign in the lodge on the day and
evening commemorating the same.

5\. And Jehovih gave to the members of the lodge to answer in the sign,
THREE CLAPPINGS, signifying, ENDLESS JOY!

6\. And Jehovih said: Remember this day, and keep it holy, to the end of
the world. For, without books and without arguments, behold, I have
proven unto you the immortality of the soul of man!
