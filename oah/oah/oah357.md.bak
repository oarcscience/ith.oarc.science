### Chapter X

1\. JEHOVIH said to Capilya: Thou shalt remain with My chosen until they
have learned these rites and ceremonies and doctrines; after which thou
shalt go to another region whither I will lead thee, and there teach the
same things, and in the same way. And Capilya obeyed the commandments of
the Great Spirit in all these things.

2\. In the fifth year of Capilya's preaching, the voice of Jehovih came
to him saying: Behold, thy foster-father is near death's door. Go thou
to him and have the law of protection established before his death; and
after his death, and when thou art king, thou shalt ratify the law, and
then abdicate the throne.

3\. So Capilya returned to Yokovrana, the king, who was ill with fever.
The king said: O my son, my son! I feared I should die ere mine eyes
beheld thee. A few days more, and it will be over with me. Thou wilt be
king. Bethink thee, what wouldst thou ask of me, whilst yet I may
accomplish it?

4\. Capilya said: Call thy Royal Council and pass a law guaranteeing
Brahmins, <span id="page_484b">p. 484b</span> the Zarathustrians
(Faithists), the lands they have possessed and tilled and are now
dwelling on, to be theirs forever.

5\. The king assented to this, and the law was so enacted; and this was
the first law granting land unto the Faithists, to be their own, by any
king in all the world. And the law stipulated that the Faithists should
worship in their own way; neither should they be impressed into any army
as soldiers of war.

6\. After the law was established, Yokovrana said unto Capilya: I was
wondering why thou didst not wait till thou wert king, and then enact
the law thyself, and it could not be set aside during thy life-time? I
will die soon, and the law will die with me.

7\. Capilya answered: I shall ratify thy law on the day I ascend the
throne, which is binding, according to the rules of the ancients. Had I
waited until I was king, then I had been bound, according to my
religion, which is that no one individual possesseth land, save what he
tilleth, and then only by donation from the community in which he
dwelleth, and only during his life-time, after which it reverteth to the
community.

8\. Yokovrana said: Thou art wise, O my son! What is it that thou
understandst not? After the king rested a while, he said: Capilya, thou
hast often said thou hast seen the angels of heaven: Who sayest thou
they are?

9\. Capilya said: Persons who once inhabited this earth. Some of them
once lived on the stars.

10\. The king said: Since thou sayest so, it must be so. I thought,
sometimes, they might be different beings that dwell in the air, and
never dwelt here. Sayest thou, Capilya, all souls are immortal?

<span id="page_485b">p. 485b</span>

11\. Capilya said: They are so born into life; nevertheless, not all
inherit everlasting life. Even as the body goeth into destruction, so
can the spirit of a man dissolve out of being. The fruit of them that
have attained to faith in everlasting life is safe; but for them that
have fallen from faith in everlasting life, and from faith in the
Creator, I pity them and their heirs.

12\. The king said: Why do the oracles tell lies? They are the words of
angels.

13\. Capilya said: If a man will not think for himself, examine for
himself, the Creator suffereth him to be the recipient of lies. He is a
wise man who hath attained to disbelief in angels and men; for then he
will turn to the Creator, Who is All Truth. This is the beginning of
wisdom. Some fair men, with stunted souls, who look not about doing good
in the world, require the serpents's fang in order to make them think.

14\. The king said: I have killed many men in my day; sayest thou I have
sinned? Capilya said: Inquire thou of thy Creator. I am not thy judge,
nor any man's. The king asked: If a man be killed and his soul live,
then the killing amounteth to little. We put away the body, but the soul
may come back and retaliate. Is it not so? Capilya said: Yea, O king.

15\. The king reflected a while, and then he asked: My son, can the
spirits of them we have slain catch us in heaven and injure us? Capilya
said: Yea, O king. The king said: And they having been in heaven first
would have the advantage in battle. And if they go in gangs and have a
leader (satan), they might do a great hurt. Know thou, Capilya, I have a
great secret for thy philosophy; which is: When death draweth near, we
begin to shake in the <span id="page_486b">p. 486b</span> soul as to
what we have done all our lives. Sometimes I think of saying to Dyaus:
Here, I will pray thee! But then I remember I have no merchandise which
he would accept. How strong we are in health and prosperity, and how
weak in adversity and in death! Sayest thou prayers would make my case
stand better in heaven?

16\. Capilya said: I am not master in heaven; or if I were, my love to
thee would shield thee from all darkness. The king said: The priest
saith if I pay him money he can intercede with Dyaus and so secure me a
high seat in heaven. I think he falsifieth, for Dyaus oweth him nothing.
Two things I have found, even with my little wisdom; the caterer to the
king and the caterer to the Dyaus make great pretences, but do but
little as to their promises. These two men, O my son, beware of them.

17\. I owe my greatness more to this discretion than to wisdom. They are
at the bottom of all wars and evils in this world. They can deceive even
the Gods, I am told. When thou art king, Capilya, put thy wisdom in this
matter; spare them not; they are the curse of the world. I regret that I
slew not more of them; my conscience pricketh me for this.

18\. Capilya said: Man's conscience being only part of the man, may it
not err? Is not the conscience dependent for wisdom on other things? And
after all, if we have done that which seemed the highest, best thing at
the time, have we not fulfilled the law?

19\. The king said: It would seem so. Conscience must depend for its
errors or its justice on the education it hath received. But may not
conscience be a disease in the heart? To regret for not having done a
thing; to regret for having done a thing, these are irreparable
complainings. Whoever can say beforehand, and yet not err, is wise
indeed. I find that no man brought himself into the world; nor can he
live but for a short period at most. When we are young we dislike to
die; but at my great age I desire not to live. Evidently He Who created
us hath more mastery over us than we have over ourselves.

20\. Capilya said: That is true; man at the best hath not more than half
mastery of himself. Yokovrana interrupted, <span id="page_487b">p.
487b</span> saying: I interrupt thee, my son, because my time is short.
I would ask thee what is the greatest consolation to a dying man?

21\. Capilya said: There are two consolations that are great to a dying
man: one is to know that he left no heirs after him; and the other is,
that he leaveth after him a noble son. The king said: Thou art wise, my
son. I asked the priest in the oracle-house the same thing, and he said:
For a dying man to have faith that his soul will enter paradise.
Thereupon I said to him: No honest man can have such faith; for such a
fate would be cheating heaven with one's sins. Were I the Creator, I
would break the necks of half the world. Still it may please a foolish
dying man to tell him such a tale as regardeth his soul. Thou alone, my
son, hath told me the greatest consolation to a dying man.

22\. My slaves may have faith that they will be kings, but they will
wake up in their folly. A man may have faith that his soul will enter
paradise, and he may wake up and find it was a mistake. Faith without a
guarantee is folly.

23\. Capilya said: A man to know a thing of his own knowledge hath the
greatest of all wisdom. To be as thou art, a philosopher in time of
death, is evidence of a great soul. Few have attained to this.

24\. The king said: Before thee I am nothing as to wisdom. Thou art a
mystery to me. Thy mother, whom the doctors slew to put her out of her
misery from long sickness, was not wise. And as to myself, I am only
great, not wise. I can make men fear me; but thou knowest the secret of
love, which is a great thing. Thy name, O Capilya, will be honored long
after mine is forgotten. Yet I am the greatest king in all the world. O
thou, my most wonderful son!

25\. Capilya said: Because thou gavest me great learning and a father's
kingly care, why should I not be an honor to thee, O king? When thou art
in heaven, and can look upon me, I hope thou mayest not lose thy hope
for me.

26\. The king said: It seemeth not wise to me that angels should see too
closely their mortal kin, or else, forsooth, they would never raise up
to higher heavens. The seers say heaven and angels are about us all the
while. <span id="page_488b">p. 488b</span> I think this is a lie,
otherwise it would be more hell than heaven to them.

27\. After the king rested a while he said: I have been surmising what
to say to thee, for I feel the blood in my veins is nearly stopped. And
this maketh me think more than ever that man at best is but a gaming
ball for the Gods to play with. Who knoweth, perhaps even now they laugh
in their sleeves as to how they have used me for some hellish game! O
that man had some standpoint to judge things by! O that he had a measure
and a foundation to stand upon! I have searched the spirits of the dead,
and the Gods of the oracles, and they are lies, lies, lies!

28\. Capilya said: The small spark of light within our souls is right at
the start; and if it be rightly cultivated it will grow brighter and
clearer every day. For is it not in the nature of all things to grow by
culture?

29\. The king said: To rightly cultivate! There is the matter, O my son.
To settle that point the world hath been washed all over with man's
blood. Rightly! Who knoweth that word? O that mine enemies were
mistaken, and that I was clear in perceiving what was right!

30\. Again he rested awhile and then he said: I had hoped when death
came on, I should get glimpses of what is in store for me; but even
death is silent and dark and deceiving. My members weaken evenly. This
showeth I was begotten of good blood. Hadst thou not been my son I
should rejoice more than I do. For then I should know that my family
race had run out, and, so, I should have ascended to the higher heavens.
Now I may be obliged to dwell on the earth for a long season. As I
understand myself now, with all thy wisdom and thy love, I had rather
thou hadst been some other man's son. Then I could die easier and not
care so much about leaving thee. I have no other kin.

31\. Capilya said: O king! Thou has rent my heart in twain! Of a truth I
am not thy son! When thy wife laid in the dark chamber, the angels of
heaven stole me and brought me thither. She who nursed me was my mother;
and her husband was my father. I am a Brahmin of Zarathustrian blood, a
Faithist!

<span id="page_489b">p. 489b</span>

32\. The king said: Is this true? It can not be! Go call thy nurse!
Capilya called in the nurse, and the king said to her: Ere I doom thee
to death, I charge thee, is this thy son, and is thy husband his father?
She answered him: I am sworn to Jehovih and cannot answer thee.
Therefore sentence me, for I have carried a great load many a year.
Behold! An angel of heaven appeareth!

33\. Jehovih's angel appeared before the king, and all saw the angel,
which said: Capilya is not thy son, O king! And yet no sin hath been
committed! Thereupon the angel vanished.

34\. The king said: Were this not a counterfeit made by the Gods, then
it was my angel wife. So, Capilya! Must here end our love? The earth is
going fast from me now! Capilya said: Our love will never die! For the
good thou has done for the Zarathustrians, the Great Spirit will provide
thee a home suited to thy great soul. If thou hadst any faults, thou
hast more than balanced them.

35\. The king beckoned for Capilya and the nurse to come to him, and
then he said, feebly: It seems to me I hear the Gods laughing! Keep ye
up the joke! My brother's oldest son knoweth nothing of it! A kingdom is
but a farce. Hold me up, Capilya. I would have mine eyes feast on the
sky only, after having seen thy sweet face.

36\. Capilya lifted him up, and the king said to the nurse: I bless
thee! Thou broughtest forth a good prop! O aden (sky), aden! All is
something! All is nothing!

37\. And the breath went out of him; he was dead.
