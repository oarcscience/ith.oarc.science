### Chapter VIII

1\. APOLLO, Son of Jehovih, said: In Jehovih's name speak I, Apollo, God
of etherea. Hear me, O ye Gods and Lords; the power of the Father
resteth in my soul; my words are of All Wisdom. Think of this great
matter: The growth of love! As a man loveth his city and his country,
what think ye Apollo hath forgotten? Have I not told it in etherea? I
sprang from the red star, the earth!

2\. Wherefore shall I not take pride before Jehovih? And hold up my head
in etherea, where I have neighbors that sprang from other stars. Shall a
man forget his love because he is a God? Nay, verily. When I was mortal,
I loved my neighbors; when I entered the second resurrection, in
atmospherea, I loved all the people of the earth; and when I rose to
etherea, my love expanded to a thousand worlds. But, of all places, how
can I make the earth and her heaven second in the love of my soul?

3\. As a mother inventeth diversions and employment for her children,
shall I not gather fruit from Jehovih's repositories to feed the
atmospherean heavens? I came, and found ye in a dark forest, with briars
and thorns; but, behold, now, O ye Gods and Lords! The lower heaven hath
become a paradise.

4\. Let me recall the philosophies I have overthrown: The false Gods and
false Lords said: It is well that there be war and destruction in
heaven; otherwise, it would soon be too full! For they saw not the
higher heavens; their arguments were framed in a dark corner. And,
because of their evil inspiration, they gave mortals the same
philosophy, saying: War is justifiable, lest the earth become too full.
For these dark angels shut out from mortals the higher light of Faith in
Jehovih. Justifying themselves in war, and the slaying of whom Jehovih
had created alive; by their behavior, thrusting condemnation in
Jehovih's face for what Jehovih had done!

5\. Neither knew these mortal philosophers that they were under the
inspiration of spirits of darkness; nor would they wait till the earth
was full of people, to prove whether their philosophy was true or false.

6\. For, as ye of heaven were given to deeds of darkness, your kingdoms
reacted on earth, making Druks out of men and women. From which have all
these heavens turned from evil <span id="page_121">p. 121</span> ways,
and become as stars of glory in Jehovih's universe.

7\. Think not that only great thunders and terrible stratagems can
govern heaven and earth righteously; for, as one man, in an army, may
cause a panic; or one brave man's upraised hand lead a nation on to
victory, so can ye, O Gods and Lords, by wisdom, in the smallest of
Jehovih's plans, rule over heaven and earth, for the glory of His
everlasting kingdoms.

8\. That which I declare unto you, go ye and declare throughout heaven;
for the fruit of your teaching shall enrich the earth people, through
their guardian spirits; and they shall, likewise, go about preaching
amongst themselves.
