### Chapter XII

1\. CAPILYA said (being inspired of Jehovih): Let thy life be thy
preacher. The behavior of one good man, even in a sparse country, is of
more avail than a thousand preachers.

2\. The clamor of the tongue maketh speedy converts, but it changeth not
the blood. They perform the rites and ceremonies, but their behavior is
not of the twelve virtues.

3\. One community (family) of a score of men and women, that dwell
together in peace and love, doing good toward one <span
id="page_493b">p. 493b</span> another, is the manifestation of more
wisdom than all the books in the world.

4\. A man that hath learned sympathy is better learned than the
philosopher that will kick a cat or a dog. Great learning is not only in
books; he who hath learned to harmonize with Jehovih hath great
learning.

5\. The doctrine of the idolator is war; but My Sons and Daughters
practice peace, resisting not any man with weapons of death, saith
Jehovih.

6\. My sermons are not in wordy professions, but in the souls of My
people who practice My commandments.

7\. Ye have witnessed that Sudga's followers said: Behold, Sudga is our
Lamb of Peace! And they were nations of warriors; they built monuments
to glorify their greatest slayers of men.

8\. My people say little; profess little, as regardeth their virtues;
but their practice is My Voice!

9\. Capilya said: Whatever should be the character of one man, so should
be the family (community); so should be the state. Harmony in a man's
soul is his greatest blessing; and so of the family, and of the state.

10\. Whoso will sacrifice self-gratification for good of the family is
the greatest, best one in the family. Whoso triumphs in self-desire or
in inflicting on others his opinions or doctrines, is the worst, bad man
in the family.

11\. My Father in heaven, is thy Father also; all men and women are my
brothers and sisters. To magnify one's soul so as to realize this
brotherhood, is a great virtue. No matter what name He hath, there is,
nevertheless, but One Creator; and all peoples are His children. Call
thou Him what name thou wilt, I will not quarrel with thee. I am a child
of His love; by love will I prove it unto thee. No man can prove this by
war.

12\. At death the real life beginneth; mold thyself well whilst thy soul
hath a good anchor (the body). The highest, best life in this world,
findeth the highest best life in heaven. To love thy Father Who created
thee; virtuous happiness is little more than this. The happiness of
lust, is hate to thy Creator.

13\. The man learning to swim had better go in with corks, till he find
the <span id="page_494b">p. 494b</span> stroke; like this, thy Creator
gave thee a corporeal body. Be not in haste to enter the unseen world;
make sure that thou hast learned the stroke of the resurrection erst
thou puttest aside thy flesh and bones.

14\. Religion is the learning of music (harmony) in a community, in
which the rab'bah is the key-note. Music is of two kinds: sounds and
assimilation. Dumb instruments may make sound-music; but assimilation
cometh to the real matter of putting one's behavior in harmony with the
community.

15\. Good works! Who knoweth the meaning of these words? King Yokovrana
judged the good works of a man by the number of bad men he had slain.
When alms-houses promote laziness they are not good works. Preaching,
and praying, and singing, are not works; they are the blossoms, and with
enticing fragrance. Yet satan persuadeth man that these are good works.
Nevertheless, all fruit is preceded by blossoms. The most learned man,
the most pious man, and the greatest philosopher can not tell what is
the meaning of the words, good works. But a mother, with a child one day
old, can tell; a farmer, that hath sowed and reaped one harvest, and
given half of it away to the less fortunate, can tell also.

16\. To bring forth out of the earth food or clothing, these are good
works only so far as they exceed one's own requirements and are given to
others. To live on the earnings of others, save in time of helplessness,
is evil. To preach and not produce substance for others; such a man is a
vampire. He selleth sermons and opinions to the ignorant, making believe
his words are Jehovih's concerns.

17\. The preacher shall dwell with the poor, taking hold with his own
hands; teaching and helping; he who giveth words only, and not labor, is
a servant of hell. He findeth honied words, and drawleth his voice; he
liveth in ease and plenty; he stretcheth out a long face seriously; he
is a hypocrite and a blasphemer against his Creator.

18\. With love and rejoicing, and with willing hearts, stand thou
upright before Jehovih; for thy preaching shall bear evidence of joyful
light; and thy presence give to the weary and disconsolate assurance
that thou art the Creator's son, come in earnest to glorify Him by
righteous works and a helping hand.

19\. Besides Capilya's book of maxims, the quarter of which is not here
related, he also restored the Zarathustrian commandments and the songs
of Vivanho. Nor since two thousand years were the children of Jehovih so
well standing before the world. And peace and plenty came upon the land
of Vind'yu, even greater than in the days of Brahma.

20\. Thus closeth the history of Capilya, who was led in all things by
Jehovih, through his angels, even to the words he uttered, though oft he
knew it not. Such is it to walk with the Creator. Now whilst this was
going on in Vind'yu, the Creator also labored through his angels in the
land of Egupt, with Moses, of whom hear ye.
