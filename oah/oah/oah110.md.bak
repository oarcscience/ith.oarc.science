### Chapter V

1\. PEACE and prosperity were established on earth and in heaven by the
time of the expiration of the dawn of Thor. And now came the time for
his own ascent, with his hosts, leaving the earth and her heavens in
care of God and his Lords.

2\. So Thor, Son of Jehovih, sent swift messengers to etherea, asking to
be delivered; and asking for the deliverance of six thousand million
Brides and Bridegrooms to Jehovih.

3\. See We'ing, Goddess of Hotosk, in etherea, was appointed by the
Council in Buru, to descend for Thor and his hosts, and his six thousand
millions.

4\. Accordingly, See We'ing built her ship and gathered in her hosts for
the journey, her ten millions. This, then, was the make of her ship,
which she named Harp, to wit:

5\. The photosphere was flat to the north and south, but oval east and
west; the openings were on the flat sides, with passages through. The
crescent described a circle of three thousand four hundred miles, and
the depth of the harp north and south was three hundred miles. The
pillars of fire that ascended from the midst were one thousand seven
hundred miles high.

6\. The stars within the photosphere were provided with five points; and
each star had one million chambers, one chamber being allotted as the
habitation of one Bride or Bridegroom; and there were seven thousand of
these stars.

7\. The frame-work was crystalline, and opaque, and transparent, and of
all possible colors, and shades, and tints. Now, besides the stars and
their chambers, the base of the crescent was provided with a salon
sufficient for one million musicians, and they were thus situated.

8\. God had knowledge of the coming of See We'ing, and had commanded
information to be sent throughout atmospherea, and to the Lords located
on earth, inviting all who chose, to come and witness the ascent. And
there came, besides the Brides and Bridegrooms, two thousand million
angels; many not yet delivered from the first resurrection.

9\. So it came to pass, SeeWe'ing, Goddess of Hotosk, came down in her
ship of fire, even to the foundation of Gau; came in great magnificence,
and was received by Thor and by God and His Lords.

10\. And she ascended the throne, and performed the marriage rite for
the six thousand millions. And after that a recreation of one day was
proclaimed in Gau, during which time the atmosphereans and ethereans
mingled freely together.

11\. On the day following, Thor accompanied See We'ing into her ship;
and their hosts went in also, being nearly seven thousand millions. And
then, amidst a rain of etherean flowers, See We'ing started her fire
ship upward.

12\. God and his hosts remaining in <span id="page_139">p. 139</span>
Gau saluted in the sign, JEHOVIH FOREVER! Which was properly answered by
the ascending millions.

13\. Then on its axis turned the great ship, rising and turning, higher
and higher. And in a little while only an ascending star was seen, and
then it disappeared in the distance.

14\. Thus fulfilled Thor his great mission in dawn to the earth and her
heavens.
