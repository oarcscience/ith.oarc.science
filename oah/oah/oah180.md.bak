### Chapter II

1\. IN those days when an army captured a large city, slaying the
people, they carried back the spoil to So-qi, king of Oas, capital of
Par'si'e, and received rewards according to the amount of plunder. The
wars were between the different nations of I'huans. The sacred people,
the I'hins, had nothing; they were unmolested.

2\. I said: Whosoever lieth up treasures in this world, shall find no
peace! But ye have built so great a city, ye hope nothing can break it
down. Now I will show thee, O king: thy city shall prove the weakest of
cities. I will raise up one man out of the seed of the I'hins; and, Oas,
the mighty city, shall fall before his hand.

3\. I'hua'Mazda, God of heaven, sent certain loo'is, highly learned
angels, to look around, and afterward he called them and asked what they
saw? They said: Work! Work! Ihua'Mazda said: Work it shall be! Go ye,
holy masters of generations, down to mortals close around the city of
Oas. And search ye out seed of the I'hin race, and by inspiration lead
them to the fairest daughters of I'hua, in the city of Oas; and they
shall be tempted, and anon a quickened fruit shall ripen in the city,
sons and daughters. Again go ye to the I'hins, and by inspiration bring
others and have them tempted by the improved fruit. And yet again repeat
this method, and in the sixth generation ye shall raise up a son having
the gifts of su'is and sar'gis, and ye shall call him Zarathustra.

4\. The loo'is, the angels who were guardians over mortals for such
purpose, went and accomplished what had been commanded by God. And the
child's mother's name was Too'che, and the father's name Lo'ab. Too'che
was su'is born herself, and was by Sa'moan, an angel, obsessed before
she conceived, and during the time of maternity not suffered to wake
from her unconscious trance. And by the loo'is, her soul was oft taken
to high heaven to behold its glories, and then to return and inhabit her
own body. Thus, the child was born of All Light, and in that same day
the obsession fled, and Too'che proclaimed within the city that no man
was father to the child, but that she conceived from <span

in gestation.

5\. The learned men cast the horoscope, but found nothing in the stars
to alarm the kings, or worthy of credence to the maiden's story. The
loo'is went before God, saying: Behold, a child is born, capable of All
Light. Then spake God, saying: I will come; go ye and lead the way.

6\. When yet the child nursed, I'hua'Mazda spake through the child,
whilst its own spirit slept. Then again came the learned men, chief of
whom was Asha, son of Zista, learned in a thousand stars and all living
creatures, and in the bones of animals no longer living. So Asha spake
to Too'che, saying: Canst thy suckling talk? Whereupon God answered him,
saying:

7\. Not the child, but I, even I'hua'Mazda. Think not, O man, these
small lips utter words prompted by this child's soul. I am come to stay
the cruel hand of war; to make man know there is an Unseen Master.
Behold, this child hath no sex! He is an Yeshuah (Iesu), a passionless
birth.

8\. To which Asha said: Can it be this woman hath a man hidden under her
cloak, and hopes to evade the just punishment of the king! O, thou
harlot! That toldest a shameful tale of conception without a man! Thy
lies are now added to others to make good the first. Out of the city,
wretch! or thou shalt be stoned to death, and thy child with thee!

9\. Too'che made no answer, save with a flood of tears. Then spake
I'hua'Mazda, saying: Hold thy hand on these lips, and perceive thou how
I gesticulate with these little hands. Yea, take thou the little form in
thine own arms.

10\. Then Asha feared, but fain would hide his fear, and so took the
child, whilst I'hua'Mazda spake, saying: O man, that thou couldst behold
the spirit, and would temper thy judgment down to patience and wisdom!

11\. Asha said: If it be in truth thou art the Mazda of the I'huan race,
why hast thou come in so questionable weakness? What can a child do?
Wieldest thou a sword with these little hands? I had hoped to see a God
come in stronger shape, and in majesty of a thousand angels, winged, and
in flames of fire!

<span id="page_176b">p. 176b</span>

12\. I'hua'Mazda said: My wisdom is not man's wisdom; my weapons, not
arrows and sharp swords. What is great in man's judgment is as nothing
to me; what is as nothing to man, I will make great, for I shall
overturn this mighty city. Because I am come in peace and love, the city
shall be divided, man against man, and bloody war run riot in this
walled kingdom.

13\. Asha said: To what end art thou come? For if it be true thou art a
God born in this questionable shape, thou hast some motive more than to
overthrow the town. I charge thee, then, most precocious youth, tell me
what thy purpose is, that justice may be done?

14\. I'hua'Mazda said: The cities of man are as nothing in my sight; I
come to teach man of other worlds, and that the souls of the righteous
shall live forever; I come to deliver man from darkness into everlasting
light.

15\. Asha said: Thy words are wisdom, or else my sudden surprise hath
unfitted my judgment. I will go now, that I may reflect on this wonder.
To-morrow I will come again. Keep this matter quietly. For if it be
known that I, of so high estate, have talked in temperance on spiritual
things, I will be doomed to death.
