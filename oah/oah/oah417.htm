<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">OSIRIS.</H3>
<P>OSIRIS, being interpreted, is: I am the Light, the Life and the Death. Out of myself made I all that live. The sun I placed in the firmament as a sign of my power. The stars and the moon and things that speak not and know not are the works of my hand. I am the Tau and the Sed (Taurus and Aries, bull and lamb), the power and wisdom over all and within all. Without me nothing is, nor was, nor ever shall be (Aribania). The spirit of self-assertion; tyranny; to enslave; to master others per force. Tow (Aii). The self-assuring man, or spirit. Y'taw (Vede). Tau'baw, a bull, or Ti'taw, I am the T'taw. I am the master at the bridge Chinvat. Without my will none shall rise to Nirvana, my upper heavens. Through my good-will only shall any man ascend. I am the Judge and Savior of men. On my forehead resteth the sun; the stars are my cattle. In worship of me the stars and the sun plead before me. The horses have I placed over the cows. The moon (Mas) cringeth beneath my feet. I am war, I am Thaw, a bull. My bulls shall be the edicts of kings. Who worshipeth not me, him will I destroy (Vede). Toe'phi, the All High Spirit, next to Om, wife of Eolin. Toe'phi is my Savior; he will redeem. (Chine). Itaura, Itura (Algonquin). Toe (Ebra). Toe (Hebrew). Toe (Fonece). Wild, unreasonable. Destroyer of liberty.</P>
<P>55. Mi, or Mira (Panic). Mi, spirit, My'ra, spirit of earth (English). Mary, lamb (spirit). Mi'ra, a virgin, was before man a dweller on the earth, nor was there any man for her. The All Unseen conceived her. Her son was Sir'za (Poit). Si'us (Kii). Osiris (Aribania). Mi, mother of all men; spouse of the Unseen (Tau). The earth was Mi, and Mi was the earth. The Great Spirit moved on the earth and the earth conceived and brought forth man. Mithra (Vede). Mother of Gods (king spirits). The sons of Mi were all I'su, free from sin. Save ye pray to Mithra, then will not Tau save your souls. She, Mi, is our virgin mother. A sign, a face within a circle; also, written and painted, a woman with a child.</A></P>
<P>56. A'ji (Gau), semi-dark. There are places in the firmament of heaven not all light, nor yet all dark. Ar'ji (Poit). When the earth passeth through A'ji (Panic), it aggregateth and groweth. An abundance of Dar'ji in the firmament giveth a cold year upon the earth (Kii). In the years of Ar'jon mortals became warriors. Now it came to pass that for seven hundred years the earth encountered not Ha'ji (Chine), and war ceased on the earth, and men were gentle, and killed not any living thing. Out of A'ghi maketh Jehovih a new world. Save your prophets understand A'ji, they can not tell what the next year will be. Let man build consecrated chambers in my temples that my spirits in heaven may come and explain Ha'jhon, and they shall be provided against famine and pestilence (Algonquin). The foolish man knoweth not A'jon, for mortals can not see him.</P>
<P>57. Ji'ay (Panic). Ji'ya (Gau). Semi-light. There are three places in the firmament, light and semi-dark. The fourth is Corpor. Thus, ether, the most rarified place; Ji'ay, the second place, less rarefied; A'ji, the third place (nebulous places in the firmament), and fourth, the corporeal worlds. As out of the ether I make A'ji, so out of Jy'ay make I corpor. (Kii.) Hy'ghi (Chine). Beware of evil spirits in the time of Jy'ay, for they shall train the corporeal senses of men to believe they lived before. (Chine.)</P>
<P>58. Dan'ha (Panic). The etherea, the highest place in ethereal worlds. Jehovih said: The sun I made as the head of a serpent, and his phalanx made I as the body of a serpent; thus made I the great corporeal serpent. To him gave I a circuit to travel in, and I numbered his time a thousand tuos and seven aka and four bi'jus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A>, for the sun coil. On the circuit have I placed my A'ji and my Ji'ay in many places, but my Dan'ha have I placed only in one thousand six hundred places. (A cycle of time is about three thousand years, sometimes more, sometimes less.) From Kosmon, the present time, back to Moses and Capilya, alias Capella, three thousand four hundred years; from Moses and Capilya to Brahma and Abraham, two thousand four hundred years; from Brahma and Abraham to Zarathustra, three thousand</P>

He who received the earth as his portion to command was called Lord (Sa'fome), i.e., earth wind. On his forehead shall be the sign of cross-bones. Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord (Sa'fome). (Fonece.) Jehova said: Not having stone images they have made an idol of the wind and called it Lord (Land God or Ghad). (Moses in Egypt.) Let my followers swear an oath against the Lord, for he is more hurtful than the stone idols, and they shall profess the Great Spirit, E-O-Ih, only. (Abraham.) See to it that the enemy fasteneth not an idol of the wind on the Faithists (Zarathustra). (Vede.) Not content to worship the Great One they have a representative, saying: He is the Only Begotten Son. Be ye wary of them (Brahma). (Naoli.) An earth God, i.e., evil God. They profess to feast his nostrils with the smell of burning flesh, saying: He alone can save; he, the mighty Sa'fome (Chine). Now judge ye them; for do they not engage in war, and are they not all idolatrous warriors? (Fus). A figure by the door-way of heathen temples.</P>

Jehovih saith, Whoever professeth the sword and the spear and the sling and the pitchfork shall perish thereby. (Zarathustra.) Overthrow of Osiris in the lower heaven. Because Osiris hath said, I am Ho'Joss, the Savior of men, and none shall ascend to the Father but through me, so shall Osiris be hated of men (Kii). Was it not so with Tistyra, and he was changed into a star? (Pali.) A figure of authority at the altar in heathen temples. A face with or without horns. A man bound on a wheel. A man bound on a cross. Jehovih said: Have I not said, He that proclaimeth the sword shall perish by the sword? Behold ye then the Ghad they worship (Osiris).</P>

The supposed boundary of the lower heavens or atmospherea, and the inner boundary of the emancipated heavens, etherea.

A supposed line between the rotating atmosphere of a corporeal world and the ether that lieth beyond the Vortex. Beware of spirits and Gods who profess to save the souls of men, saying: Only through me shall ye escape the labor of atmospherea and arise to Chinvat. I declare unto you that all such spirits and Gods belong to the lower heavens, where they have kingdoms, and they are the tyrants thereof (Zarathustra). No man shall reach Chinvat but by perfecting himself either on earth or in the lower heavens (Abraham). What company judge ye ye are suited for in heaven (Confucius). Ye are neither wise nor strong (Kii). Being lazy they catch at the promises of Saviors, hoping to fly from the earth direct to Chinvat (Fus). Save ye have learned to perfect your own selves in wisdom and goodness ye shall not rise to Chinvat (Abraham). If a child can not reach manhood but by growth, how hope ye to reach Chinvat suddenly (Algonquin). The evil God, Anra'mainyus, said: Put your trust in me; I will save your souls from the labor of d'fome (atmospherea). But he hath been subdued by his own sins; and in a thousand years he can not reach Chinvat (Brahma).</P>
