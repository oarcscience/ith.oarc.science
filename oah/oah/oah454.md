### TUE.

1\. O thou, Moses, and, thou, Capilya, and Chine; sing ye unto Jehovih!
Rejoice ye in the time of the Almighty! Into separate gardens in the
same time the Creator singled you out unto his own glory.

2\. Fashioned he, the Almighty, three souls magnified unto the glory of
His work. Sing unto the Creator for those that toiled in the days of
darkness for the glory of the Almighty!

3\. Praise ye the Great Spirit, ye followers of Moses, Capilya and
Chine. Sing a new song to the Almighty! His eye hath witnessed the toil
and sorrow of His chosen.

4\. And all ye followers of the chosen of the Almighty; glorify Him in
the highest; sing unto the Great Spirit, forever and ever.
