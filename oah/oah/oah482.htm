<P>1. PRAISE be unto Thee, Jehovih! Who can search out the completeness of Thy creation?</P>
<P>2. Or know the magnitude of Thy places, Thou Almighty! And thy endless inventions?</P>
<P>3. Thou shalt be My theme forever, to find the far-seeing devices of my Creator, the work of my soul.</P>
<P>4. I was alone in the world. Angels and men fed not my soul; I was hungered and in gloom.</P>
<P>5. Then I turned to Thee, Thou Almighty. And Thou gavest me a new growth, a fruit of life in fire!</P>
<P>6. Which grew brighter and brighter. And my vision was recovered, and Thy heavens were opened as a book is opened.</P>
<P>7. And I drank of Thy waters, and ate of the tree of the resurrection to Thy everlasting kingdoms.</P>
<P>8. The secret of Thy Wisdom, O Jehovih, was uncovered; the way of Thy Mightiness made imperishable forever!</P>
