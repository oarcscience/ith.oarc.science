vegetable and of animal life on the earth, and of the inorganic
habitation of the earth and tier atmospherea. With the

BOOK OF SETHANTES, Son of Jehovih, commences the organic habitation of
the earth and her heavens; and with the Book of Ah'shong the history is
carried down for six thousand years, then for forty-nine thousand years
a synopsis merely is given. The history is again taken up with the
