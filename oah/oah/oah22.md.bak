### Chapter VI

1\. AND God went to the provinces of the governors of heaven dwelling on
earth, whom he had appointed and sent forth; and as he himself had been
commissioned by Jehovih in Hored, so did he install the governors on
their seats.

2\. And the governors were situated within Whaga (Pan) at remote
distances, but God sent messengers to <span id="page_24">p. 24</span>
them, notifying them of the time he would appear.

3\. And the Lord being apprised of God's journey, established a
protectorate in the Lord's kingdom in the city of Ul'oo, on earth, and
went and joined the ship of God, and traveled with him throughout Whaga,
being present at the inauguration of the governors in these heavens.

4\. To each and all the governors, God said: Remember that that which is
given to my governors pertaineth to things in heaven; for the Lord's
matters pertain to earthly things, and to angels that labor with the
corporeans. But ye are to attend to the es'yans, receiving them in
heaven, providing them with places to sojourn, and in their helplessness
supply them with food and clothes, and the rudiments of learning.

5\. God said: Remember ye also, the time cometh when each of these
governorships shall attain to an independent kingdom; and instead of
being governors ye shall be raised as sub-Gods.

6\. After God established the governors, the Lord persuaded God to visit
his place in Ul'oo, and thence to go around about on earth and see the
mortals with whom the Lord had to deal. And God consented, and the Lord
sent messengers on before him, that the house of the Lord, which mortals
had built, might be replenished and cleansed.

7\. And the protectorate notified the ashars, and the ashars impressed
mortals to go and cleanse and purify the house of the Lord. And so
mortals fell to work and cleansed the place, and burned incense of sweet
myrrh and hepatan, not even knowing they were fulfilling the command of
the Lord.

8\. When the ship of the hosts of God came to the city of Ul'oo, mortals
saw it high up in the air, and they feared and ran hastily to consult
the prophet of the Lord. And the prophet said: Behold, God appeareth in
a sea of fire in the firmament of heaven.

9\. And God caused the ship to be made unseen, that fear might subside
on earth, and he descended with his hosts into the house of the Lord,
and they went and touched the things mortals had builded that they might
perceive corporeally.

10\. And the Lord gave a banquet, and the angels of God tarried four
days, exchanging fellowship with the ashars, who ministered to mortals.
And the ashars took the angels of God around about amongst mortals, both
whilst mortals were asleep and awake, showing them all things.

11\. And because of the presence of the hosts of God, mortals were
aroused with new vigor to worship the Lord, rising early and going to
the house of worship and continuing all day, and not one of them knew
the cause thereof.

12\. On the evening of the fourth day God commanded his hosts to prepare
to renew the journey, and the ship was again illumed and set for its
course.

13\. God said: O Jehovih, who createth all, look down and bless Thy
Lord! He hath from his high estate in etherea, descended to these poor
mortals to lift them up. Already hath he toiled with them a hundred
years. Three generations have risen up out of the earth, and they begin
to glorify Thee in Thy kingdoms above the earth. Who but Thee, O
Jehovih, can honor Thy Lord or know his sore trials! Behold, man groweth
up out of the earth, saying: There is no Lord and no God. But his feet
and his hands are guided every hour of the day. Yea, when he entereth
the unseen worlds, they become seen; but he is helpless in a strange
place. And Thy Lord provideth him and teacheth him Thy kingdoms. Thy
Lord goeth from place to place on the earth. He findeth a corner and
saith: Here will I build a city. He sendeth his angels forth and they
inspire man on the earth to come and build a city. Yet when the city is
built, man saith: Behold, there is no God and no Lord.

14\. The Lord bringeth the corporeans together and guardeth them day and
night; but man turneth away in strife and destruction. Then Thy Lord
withdraweth his angels of the city because of its wickedness; and lo,
the city falleth in ruins. But man knoweth not the cause. Yet Thy Lord
toileth on, day and night, watching, guarding and striving to lift man
up out of darkness. O Jehovih, Father, bless Thy Lord and his hosts!
Haste the time when man shall comprehend the foundations of Thy
kingdoms!

15\. The Lord said: O Jehovih, Ever Present! Hear the words of Thy God.
He who comprehendeth the whole earth and the heaven of the earth,
knowing no day nor no night. He dealeth with millions; his judgment is
sufficient for all.

16\. Glorify him, Thy Son, of heaven and earth. He fashioneth the homes
of Thy Lords and Thy little ones in great wisdom. His love is the glory
of all men; his strength fashioned after Thy foundations. Give swiftness
and <span id="page_25">p. 25</span> rest, and joy in Thy quickening to
him, Thy God!

17\. The mortals of the city of Ul'oo had gathered together to worship,
and they were singing and dancing to the Lord, and the angels joined in
the singing also. And God went and sat on the altar and illuminated it,
so the mortals could see him. And the chief prophet came near the place
of the Lord, and the Lord placed his hand on the forehead of the
prophet, so he might speak in the name of God.

18\. The prophet said: Behold me, I am the God of heaven and earth, and
my words come out of the mouth of this my prophet. Keep holy the four
days of the moon, for they are the Lord's days. (See ceremonies of
Saphah, and also Mas.) Do no evil, but strive for wisdom and to do good.
And when ye are dead, behold, ye shall live, for I have places prepared
for ye in my heaven. Rejoice and be merry, for the Lord liveth and
reigneth.

19\. When the prophet ceased, God rose up from the altar, and his
traveling host also, and saluting the Lord in the name of Jehovih,
disappeared in heaven above.
