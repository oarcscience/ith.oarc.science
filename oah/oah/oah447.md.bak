### UNH.

1\. SING unto Jehovih, O all ye living! Proclaim His love, which He gave
unto all! Every one, that lovest to live on, to die not.

2\. O the weeping and wailing, when thy kin goeth down in death! Thy
call unto the Almighty to prolong yet a while the time of thy love! or
to hear the song of him that is dead!

3\. In Jehovih's praise is the wail of thy anguish; thy great sorrow,
the love of the Almighty; the fountain of song and paradise. Sing on, O
earth, Jehovih, forever!

4\. O that I could answer them, Jehovih! that I could show them Thy
fullness, which encompasseth the universe! To show them the testimonies
of the thread of Thy love!

5\. I will have my discourse with Thee, Thou Ever Present! In the
harmony of Thy loves will I immerse my soul! Thou, the Fountain and
Source of my contemplation.

6\. Thou, Who art all; my Creator, Who gavest me judgment and perception
to search into the magnitude of Thy creations.

7\. Who shall frame a song, or find words to laud the Almighty! Thou art
the Throne and the Empire. Thy footstool, the sun and moon and stars!

8\. O that I may prolong my vision of Thee, and pursue the thread of Thy
creations to the fountain-head. Thou, without a boundary, where all
things utter Thy praise forever!
