### CHAMBER OF PROPHECY

1\. GOD said: Before learning to approach the foot of the throne, what
profit is it to show them the way to mount upon the throne itself?

2\. Preserve, therefore, the secrets of prophecy for such as apply
themselves to keeping Jehovih's commandments. Those who have attained to
the foot, can of themselves find the way to mount upon it.
