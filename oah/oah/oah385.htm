<P>1. GOD said: I declare in the name of Jehovih, the Whole. Through Him, and by His hand have I been lifted up. hear me, O mortals! Give ear, O ye spirits of the dead! The Father hath spoken; Him do I reval; in Him bestow the tree of light.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>2. I was in darkness, but am now in light. His presence is upon me. Hearken, then, to my words, and be wise in your lives.</P>
<P>3. Seek not to disprove Him; seek not to prove that these things can not be; seek not to deny His person, nor <A NAME="page_552"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 552</FONT></A> His spirit. Of such was my bondage. In bitterness of heart was I bound in darkness. Those who deny, those who try to disprove Him, are in darkness.</P>
<P>4. He is the same to-day and forever. The prophets of old found Him; so also can ye. But He cometh not to the denier, nor to the disprover.</P>

<P>5. He who will find His Person must look for Him. He who will hear His Voice must hearken. Then cometh light.</P>
<P>6. All argument is void. There is more wisdom in the song of a bird than in the speech of a philosopher. The first speaketh to the Almighty, proclaiming his glory. The second ploddeth in darkness.</P>
<P>7. By my hand were the ancient libraries burnt, to draw man away from darkness.</P>
<P>8. Kosmon said: What hath great learning found that is valuable?</P>
<P>9. Shall learning, like riches, be acquired for one's own selfish gratification?</P>
<P>10. If a rich man with his horded wealth do little for the resurrection of man, how much less doth the learned man with a head full of knowledge? It neither feedeth nor clotheth the sick and distressed, nor stayeth the debauchery and drunkenness of the great multitude.</P>
<P>11. How shall we class the man of exact science? Where shall we find him? How shall we know that he will not be disproved in time to come?</P>
<P>12. Yesterday it was said, a man can not fast forty days and live; to-day it is proven possible.</P>
<P>13. Yesterday it was said, there is attraction of gravitation betwixt the sun and the earth; to-day it is proven that there is no such thing. That no man can see without eyes or hear without ears, in su'is (clairvoyance and clairaudience); to-day hundreds of thousands know it to be so.</P>
<P>14. Yesterday it was said, thou shalt eat flesh and oil, because they supply certain things for the blood, without which man can not live; to-day it is proven otherwise.</P>
<P>15. Yesterday the physician said: Take thou this, and it will heal thee; to-day the same thing is proven to have no virtue.</P>
<P>16. This only is proven: That man is vain and conceited, desiring to make others believe he is wise when he is not.</P>
<P>17. What healed the sick yesterday, will not to-morrow.</P>
<P>18. Philosophy that was good yesterday, is folly to-day.</P>
<P>19. Religions that were good for the ancients are worthless to-day.</P>
<P>20. Crime and pauperism grow up in the heart of them, even worse than in the regions of the earth where they are not preached.</P>
<P>21. The physicians have not lessened the amount of sickness on the earth.</P>
<P>22. The lawyers have not lessened the rascality of the wicked, or depleted the number of defrauders.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_553"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 553</FONT></A></P>
<P>23. The march of Jehovih and His peoples is onward; it is like a tree of light, forever growing, but man heedeth not the growth.</P>
<P>24. Man bindeth his judgment by things that are past; he will not quicken himself to see and understand the All Light.</P>
