### YAD.

1\. PRAISE be unto Thee, Jehovih! Who can search out the completeness of
Thy creation?

2\. Or know the magnitude of Thy places, Thou Almighty! And thy endless
inventions?

3\. Thou shalt be My theme forever, to find the far-seeing devices of my
Creator, the work of my soul.

4\. I was alone in the world. Angels and men fed not my soul; I was
hungered and in gloom.

5\. Then I turned to Thee, Thou Almighty. And Thou gavest me a new
growth, a fruit of life in fire!

6\. Which grew brighter and brighter. And my vision was recovered, and
Thy heavens were opened as a book is opened.

7\. And I drank of Thy waters, and ate of the tree of the resurrection
to Thy everlasting kingdoms.

8\. The secret of Thy Wisdom, O Jehovih, was uncovered; the way of Thy
Mightiness made imperishable forever!
