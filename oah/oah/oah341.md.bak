### Chapter XX

1\. DURING the fourth year of dawn, the Voice of Jehovih came to Lika,
saying: My Son, thou shalt provide thyself an army sufficient, and thou
shalt take away from the earth all angels below the first resurrection,
save such fetals as are under the dominion of My heavenly rulers.

2\. And thou shalt provide them separate regions in My lower heavens,
whence they can not return to mortals. And thou shalt appoint rulers and
teachers over them, to deliver them out of madness and evil and stupor.

3\. Of thy etherean hosts shalt thou appoint teachers and rulers for
this purpose; but at the end of dawn they shall give over their places
to atmosphereans selected from Theovrahkistan.

4\. From this time forth My atmosphereans shall begin to help one
another, not depending for all teachers to come from My etherean
heavens.

5\. Lika then called up At'yesonitus and told him of Jehovih's words,
and further added: To thee do I therefore allot this labor. And I give
unto thee twelve generals, for the different regions of the earth; and
unto each of the twelve I allot five million ethereans, whom thou canst
draw from the armies that were engaged in delivering the hells and
knots.

6\. At'yesonitus said: In Jehovih's will and thine, I am pleased. I will
divide up the regions of the earth amongst the twelve generals, and give
unto each one of them the five millions, according to thy commandments.

7\. At'yesonitus then sent officers out into different regions in
atmospherea to select the sixty million deliverers, commanding them to
report in Theovrahkistan, in the Valley of Tish, his heavenly place,
whither he took the twelve generals that Lika had assigned him.

8\. Lika gave to At'yesonitus a list of the spirits to be thus taken
away from mortals, that is, the engrafted, the damons, the familiars,
the vampires and the lusters, and such other spirits as otherwise lead
mortals into darkness and crime; showing him the regions of the earth
where they were most numerous. With which list At'yesonitus and his
generals made themselves well acquainted before starting on his perilous
enterprise.

9\. At'yesonitus then ordered the ship-builders to provide him twelve
thousand fire-boats, with bulwarks of fire, and with gateways.

10\. In the meantime Lika sent Yussamis with four hundred geographers
and mathematicians and surveyors to find the necessary plateau to which
At'yesonitus could send his captured hosts.

11\. Yussamis therefore founded the six heavenly plateaux known as the
Ugsadisspe, a name signifying the HEAVEN OF THE DESTROYING SERPENTS.

12\. These, then, were the six heavens of Ugsadisspe, to wit:
Tewallawalla, over Arabin'ya, one thousand two hundred miles high;
Setee'song, over Vind'yu, one thousand miles high; Go'e'dhi, over
Jaffeth, one thousand one hundred miles high; Ellapube, over Uropa, one
thousand miles high; Apak, over North and South Guatama, six hundred
miles high, and bordering on Yaton'te, the subjective heaven of the
ancients, which was now being re-established by Kaparos; and Fue, over
Chihuahi, nine thousand miles high.

13\. Yussamis provided these heavens with no roadways, in order to
prevent the delivered spirits flocking together, in which case they
might run into anarchy (hells). And, accordingly, appointed unto each of
these heavens one ruler of the rank primal God, selecting them from the
etherean hosts, but empowering them to bestow their thrones on
successors at the end of dawn, giving terms of office not less than two
hundred years, but subject to the limiting power of God of
Theovrahkistan.

14\. Lika gave four thousand messengers to At'yesonitus, and twelve
thousand messengers to Yussamis, to whom he also gave sixty million
laborers. But each of them provided their own heralds, musicians,
marshals and captains in their own way.

15\. Now, therefore, At'yesonitus and Yussamis, receiving their armies
of laborers, fell to work, the former to delivering, and the latter to
receiving the drujas of the earth. And Yussamis put his hosts to
building houses and hospitals, heavenly places, and to founding cities
and provinces through the primal Gods under him.
