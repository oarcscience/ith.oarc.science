### Chapter IV

1\. THE Council of Yeshuah, of which there were one million members, was
formed in groups, and these again represented in groups, and these in
still other groups. Consequently, a group of one thousand had one
speaker, who became the voice of that thousand; of these speakers, one
hundred had one voice in council; and of these, ten had one voice before
God, <span id="page_53">p. 53</span> and he was the voice of the whole,
and Jehovih was his voice. Thus was the whole council represented in all
its parts. And this was the manner of proceeding, to wit:

2\. God commanded the subject; the council deliberated in thousands, and
each speaker became aware of the voice of his group. Then these speakers
assembled in hundreds and deliberated, and they again centered into one
voice; and each ten of these had one voice before God. Thus it came to
pass that the decrees of God were both the wisdom of men and of Jehovih.
Hence the saying: When God said this, or God commanded that, it was the
word of Jehovih expressed by men and angels.

3\. After God and his hosts visited the earth and the lower heaven, they
returned to Yeshuah and sat in council on the affairs of mortals and
atmosphereans.

4\. God said: Behold, the heavens and earth have become like gardens
grown foul and rank, producing nothing. I have come with a pruning knife
and a consuming fire.

5\. God said: I withdraw from the Druj and the Druk the beneficence of
Jehovih's chosen; I leave them destitute. Who can approach the beggar
with wisdom, or the king with inspiration to be good? A drowning man
will try to swim; but the reveler in lust must perish before his soul
can learn Jehovih.

6\. Better is it to labor with a child from infancy, and thence to
maturity, to teach it aright, than to strive with a score of conceited
adults, and fail to redeem one. Who is the mocker of charity more than
they that give to such as can help themselves but will not? Wisdom and
uprightness of heart are but bread. Preach not to unwelcome ears; are
sermons of wisdom to be forced into men's souls?

7\. Blessed Jehovih! He made hunger, and so men love bread. Without
hunger they would not eat. A wise God driveth home to man's
understanding his helplessness in spirit when Jehovih is denied.

8\. Pursue the earth, O my beloved; bring hence all light. Pursue the
lower heaven of the earth also; bring hence all light. I will leave the
earth and heaven in darkness one whole year. They shall cry out; their
conceit in the dumb wind shall fail.

9\. Have not the spirits of heaven despoiled Hored and Moeb? Do not evil
spirits and evil men say: Behold, there is enough! Let us divide. But
they produce not. They are devourers; living on others' substance. The
Great Spirit made man to exert; by exertion groweth he in wisdom and
strength.

10\. They seek ease and comfort; helpless and more helpless they fall;
they are on the road to everlasting destruction. Happy is the God who
can arouse them.
