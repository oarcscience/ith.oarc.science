### Chapter XII

1\. THE next resurrection was six thousand million souls, and God and
his Lords and his sub-Gods had maintained the Diva, and maintained all
the orders of heaven, and the divisions and kingdoms, save what had
confederated with Ahura and his kingdoms. And God and his Lords had
preserved their colleges, schools, factories, hospitals and nurseries,
and their standard in the temples with mortals. And of mortals who
remained Faithist, that is, the I'huan race preserved in purity, God,
his Lords and ashars held command for the glory of Jehovih.

2\. But of the mongrels, who were multiplying fast on the earth, Ahura,
his Lords and ashars held command. But alas for the grade of Ahura's
hosts in heaven! In less than one thousand years he had abolished his
colleges and schools, save what pertained to acquiring a knowledge of
the earth and atmospherea. He taught not his people to look higher for
other worlds, and herein he began the work which was in after time to be
his own downfall.

3\. Jehovih had said: Whoever provideth not a philosophy for the endless
acquisition of knowledge, dammeth up the running waters I have made.
Suffer Ahura to teach what he will; the time will come when he will be
obliged to find an outlet for My created beings. And rather than
acknowledge Me in My Person, he will profess to send souls back into
earth to be re-incarnated.

4\. Ahura's heavenly kingdoms numbered more than six thousand million
souls, and half of them were little better than drujas, being slaves to
certain masters, doing whatsoever they were bidden without knowing, or
desiring to know, the reason therefor.

5\. As yet there were six hundred years to pass before another dawn of
dan, in which God, his Lords and their people had faith that Jehovih's
hosts would come from on high to help deliver heaven and earth out of
darkness.

6\. On the other hand, Ahura, although having been taught the cycles in
his early education, spread the word abroad in heaven and earth, that
there <span id="page_296">p. 296</span> were no cycles; that, as things
are, they had been, and would continue to be.

7\. So, as much as God's hosts prophesied a coming light, Ahura and his
hosts prophesied that nothing of the kind would come. Ahura, moreover,
sent the following order to his Lords, to be taught in heaven and earth,
to wit: Am I not he who inspired Zarathustra, the All Pure? Spake I not
to him, face to face? Are not all created things mine own? Who, then,
knoweth but I will light up the world again? Behold, I am the
Personation of Ormazd, Who was VOIDANCE, but now is Me, Ahura'Mazda. In
Me only is life and death and resurrection. Whosoever calleth:
Ahura'Mazda, Ahura'Mazda! is mine, and within My keeping. Suffer not thy
judgment to be warped by prophets who hope for impossible things.

8\. In the sixth dan and the eightieth year, Ahura's numberless heavenly
kingdoms began to be disturbed by his sub-Gods' lack of advancement, and
so, sixty of them congregated together and appealed to Ahura, saying;

9\. In reverence to thee, O thou All Highest God! Many hundreds of years
have we served thee. And we have paid thee tribute whenever thou
requiredst of us. We have helped to adorn thy capital, Ctusk; with
diamonds and pearls we have laid thy streets. Thy mansions have we built
with precious gems. And as to thy throne, what one of us is there but
hath contributed to glorify it before thee. Yea, in all things have we
been most loyal and tributary to thee.

10\. Nor are we unmindful of our own wisdom. We remember thy arguments
of old. Thou didst say to thy God: Behold, thou hast long promised we
should be raised to more exalted kingdoms, but, behold, two hundred
years have elapsed, and there is no advancement. This thou didst use as
an argument for seceding from thy God's kingdoms. Behold, now we have
served thee and thy kingdoms more than a thousand years. We come to thee
to know wherein we can now serve thee that thou mayst exalt us into
kingdoms commensurate with our wisdom and power?

11\. To this Ahura replied, saying: Most humble and well-meaning Lords
and sub-Gods, why came ye not before me, face to face? Why have ye
consorted in private? Was not my capital, and before my throne, the
proper place for your argument? Had ye suggested any way whereby
advancement was possible unto you, I had answered your demands.

12\. But his Lords and sub-Gods came not before him, but sent this
answer, to wit: As thou promisedst us advancement provided we served
thee, so promised we our ashars, and our marshals and captains. Now they
come to us, saying: For hundreds of years have we served; give us
preferment. But we have nothing to give. Think not, O God, that we are
unwise, or that we hunger and come begging; or that diadems, or gems, or
costly thrones, would satisfy us. We know what thou hast to
give--promises! We know every corner of thy vast kingdom, and that all
places are full, and that thou canst not exalt us. Wherefore, then,
shouldst we have spoken before the throne in Ctusk? Would not our voices
but breed mischief amongst thy other Gods and Lords? Rather let us err
in our proceeding, bringing just punishment upon ourselves, than that we
should injure thee and thy kingdoms. Hear us then, O Ahura'Mazda:

13\. Whence the desire for endless advancement if this heaven be all? If
a little knowledge giveth power, wherein is not great knowledge
desirable. We have destroyed our great colleges, saying: Higher than we,
ye must not go. Remember thou, O Ahura, we were students under the
Faithist's God and Lords when thou secededst; and thou said unto us:
Behold the long training of your course; a curriculum of a thousand
years! Come with me; I will give you kingdoms at once.

14\. So we came to thee, and we were suddenly puffed up with great
pride. Behold, now we look abroad and the same stars shine upon us. We
have not visited them. We know not how to go so far. The countless
etherean worlds lay beyond ours. We are told that they are habitable. We
know not. We have no knowledge enabling us to get away from these
heavens; save, indeed, back to the filthy earth.

15\. To this Ahura replied, saying: It is plain to me ye are beside
yourselves. This heaven is good enough. If there be higher heavens, let
them come or stay. I go not to them. But, in truth, with your present
convictions, I would be an unwise God not to grant you dismissal from my
kingdoms.

16\. This ended the matter, and the sixty sub-Gods then deliberated on
their course, and finally sent to God, in Mouru, the following address,
to wit:

17\. In reverence to thee, God of the Faithists in Jehovih: We have had
sub-kingdoms, and know our rank is beneath thine. But we are reaching
outward and onward; to thee we submit <span id="page_297">p. 297</span>
our cause. First, then, there are sixty of us, of the rank of sub-Gods,
and we hold seven hundred million subjects. Disaffection hath risen
betwixt ourselves and Ahura'Mazda, from whom we are alienated. But
whether we shall unite our hosts into a new kingdom of our own, or
affiliate with some might God, that is our question?

18\. What preferment canst thou give unto us if we turn our subjects
over to thee?

19\. God answered them, saying: Brothers, hear me patiently, and
consider my words. First, then, I am not God of the Faithists, nor of
any other people, but God of the locality which was assigned me by the
Father, through His Son. Neither can ye give your subjects unto me; for
by my service to Jehovih I can have nothing, and, least of all, my
brothers and sisters.

20\. In the next place, I can give you no preferment; I have nothing,
neither to give nor to sell. Wherein the Father giveth me wisdom and
power, I impart them unto others. Besides, until ye have also learned to
know that ye have nothing, neither subjects nor jewels, also desiring
nothing, save wisdom and strength to impart to others, how hope ye to
gain admittance into my places of learning?

21\. And lastly, since ye have kingdoms of your own already, raise ye
them up, and thus prove unto me your just merit.

22\. To this the confederated Gods replied: What meanest thou? That Gods
and angels must labor for others than themselves forever, and receive
nothing therefor?

23\. God answered them: Even so; save and except ye shall receive an
abundance of happiness, and it will endure forever! Here the matter
ended for two whole years; and the sub-Gods understood not the plan of
Jehovih's kingdoms. But their kingdoms were out of sorts, having no
head; and hundreds of thousands of their subjects were deserting them
and returning down to the corporeal earth, becoming wanderers and
drujas.

24\. Finally the sub-Gods again appealed to God in Mouru, inquiring as
followeth, to wit: Is not a God a God, whether he be for another or for
himself? Behold, we have helped to build up Ahura; he is a mighty God!
If we affiliate with thee, we will labor to build thee up also. Yea, we
will adorn thy throne and thy great heavenly city. But since we have
been sub-Gods we desire not to enter thy service as menials and
servants. What, then, shall we do, that both thee and ourselves may have
honor and glory?

25\. God answered them, saying: Ye cannot serve me; I have no servants.
Serve ye Jehovih only. Behold, we are all brothers, being Sons of the
same Great Spirit. As for building me up, sufficient is it for me that
He who created me will build me up according to my just deserts. As for
adorning my throne, ye can only bring substance to it from the lower
kingdoms, which I desire not. Why will ye adorn the heavenly city of
Mouru? Behold, it is but a resting place on the great journey to the
kingdoms of endless light. In a few hundred years, at most, not only I
but my hosts will rise from this place to return not to it forever.

26\. And lastly, to be a self-God, as is Ahura, is to own all things
possible, and hold on thereto; to be a God as I am, is to own nothing,
and to retain nothing; but to be forever giving away all one receiveth.
Said I not to you before: Begin with your own hosts and exalt them.
Inasmuch as ye asked for subjects, behold, the Father gave unto you.
Think not that He will suffer ye now to cast them aside or barter them
off. Nor shall ye suffer them to become wanderers, nor to return back to
the earth as drujas. As much as ye raise up the kingdoms that have been
intrusted to you, so will ye also be raised up.

27\. Nevertheless, if ye desire to affiliate with Jehovih's kingdoms,
the way is open unto you; and your first labor would be, to gather
together all your own hosts, and to labor amongst them, teaching them
wisdom, strength and individuality equal with yourselves; and when the
lowest of them is so risen, then can ye enter the kingdoms of the
Father. As ye have had the profit of your subjects for hundreds of
years, return ye now unto them service for service. Jehovih is Justice!

28\. The sub-Gods made no answer to this for awhile, but Jehovih moved
upon their hearts, and they perceived wisdom and justice, and they
repented, bitterly bewailing the loss of the thousand years in which
they had espoused kingdoms. But they had neither power nor learning
sufficient to extricate themselves; so they petitioned God for more
light. Whereupon, God affiliated them, and appointed Vishnu Lord unto
them and their hosts.

29\. And Vishnu took three hundred thousand teachers, captains,
physicians, nurses and laborers, and went to them in Maitraias, a
heavenly place <span id="page_298">p. 298</span> to the west of Vindyu,
and there established a Lordly division, with messengers in connection
with Mouru, in Haraiti. And Vishnu sent his captains with sufficient
forces, under command of the sub-Gods, to arrest such as had become
wandering spirits, or had returned to the eart as drujas. And whilst
these were on this duty, Vishnu organized his Lord-dom, and this was the
first Lord-dom established in heaven, which is to say, as mortals on
earth have military stations, so was the Lord-dom of Vishnu.

30\. Jehovih's Voice had spoken to God in Diva, saying: Behold, the time
is coming when the sub-kingdom of Ahura, the false, will begin to
revolt. And they have thousands of millions of slaves who will strive to
go back to the earth to dwell with mortals. They dwell in darkness, and
thou shalt not suffer them to regain the earth, lest the races of men go
down in darkness, even as before the submersion of Pan. For which
reason, thou shalt establish a Lord-dom, and raise a sufficient army to
shield the inhabitants of the earth. And thou shalt make Vishnu thy Lord
in My behalf.

31\. When it was known in Ctusk, the heavenly place of Ahura, that sixty
sub-Gods, with their hosts, had affiliated with Jehovih's kingdoms,
general disobedience to Ahura was manifested by the remaining sub-Gods,
of whom there were yet more than eight hundred, who had within their
dominions upward of two thousand million angels, all slaves, and with
light of no other heavenly place than the small precinct where they had
been kept in drudgery hundreds of years.

32\. The Voice of Jehovih came to God, saying: My Son, take advantage of
the seed of disaffection in Ahura's kingdom. Send thou an otevan of
great power throughout the heavenly kingdoms. And thou shalt put
trumpeters in the otevan, and they shall prophesy the dawn of dan within
two hundred years.

33\. God perceived, and he had his workmen build an otevan of great
power; and he provided trumpeters, and sent them forth, saying to them:
Ten years shall ye travel in the heavenly places around about the whole
earth, prophesying: In less than two hundred years, Jehovih's etherean
hosts are coming. Prepare ye for the resurrection; His kingdoms are open
for the weary; His Lords and Gods will give you rest!

34\. Ahura summoned his Council of false Gods, hoping they might invent
a remedy to counteract so great a prophecy. And he and his Council sat
forty days and forty nights in their heavenly capital; but there was no
high light amongst them, merely each one giving his opinion. But at the
end of forty days Ahura resolved upon the following method, to send a
prophecy of his own.

35\. Accordingly, he had an otevan built, and sent trumpeters forth with
these words, to wit: I, Ahura'Mazda, Only Son of the All Nothing
Presence, personated in My Very Self, proclaim from My All Highest
Heavenly Judgment Seat! Hear My words, O ye Gods, and tremble! Hear Me,
O ye angels, and fall down! Hear Me, O mortals, and bow down to My
decrees. Behold, I sent My fire-ship, prophesying that in less than two
hundred years I would come in a dawn of dan! But ye obeyed not; ye were
defiant before Me! Then I swore an oath against all the world! Ye shall
know My power! Then I came down out of My holy, high heaven; and I am
already come. Now is the dawn of dan! I send My trumpeters first; after
them come my lashers and enchainers, whose captain is Daevas, whose God
is Anra'mainyus. I will have Mine, and I will give druks and drujas by
thousands and tens of thousands over to everlasting torments.

36\. Ahura's Gods had become acquainted with him, during the hundreds
and hundreds of years, and they no longer trembled at his commandments.
In their hearts they knew he could not do what he professed; they knew
his prophesies were vain boastings. Yea, his very trumpeters believed
not what they proclaimed.
