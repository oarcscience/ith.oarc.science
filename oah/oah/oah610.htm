<P>1. MAN I created with capacity to distinguish My direct from My indirect inspirations, saith Jehovih.</P>
<P>2. And My angels gave him rules, whereby he might make manifest the difference betwixt the two.</P>
<P>3. Man has said: Behold, any man may say: Thus saith Jehovih! One killeth his neighbor, saying: I was thus inspired of Jehovih. Another practiseth all goodness, and his words are wisdom and comprehension, and he saith: I was inspired by Jehovih!</P>
<P>4. I say unto thee, O man: In this I also gave thee liberty; therefore, judge thou, thyself, which came from Me, and which from his surroundings (satan).</P>
<P>5. Thou shalt be thine own judge in all things.</P>
<P>6. Behold, I sent My God to jduge thee; but thou shalt also judge the judgments of thy God; and, afterward, thou shalt judge thyself in the same way.</P>
<P>7. A perpetual judge created I thee, not only to judge thyself and all the world beside, but thou shalt judge Me, thy Creator.</P>
<P>8. I have given thee many sacred books, and I said to thee:</P>
<P>9. Save thou judgest them, thou shalt be caught in a snare; I charge thee, thou shalt accept nothing from men, nor angels, nor Gods.</P>
<P>10. But thou shalt rely on thine own inspiration from thy Creator.</P>
<P>11. Such is My word which I speak to thine own soul.</P>
<P>12. What cometh to thee from a man is indirect inspiration; what cometh from an angel is indirect; and what cometh from the Gods is indirect.</P>
<P>13. No direct inspiration of Me can come to thee from a book, nor a sermon, nor from anything in all My creations, but only from Me, thy Creator.</P>
<P>14. Though one man receive direct inspiration from Me, and he write it in a book, yet, when it cometh to thee, it is indirect inspiration, and is not binding upon thee, only so far as My direct inspiration upon thee moveth thee to receive it.</P>

<P>15. Yet, not all men created I with the same clearness to perceive Me, and to frame My wisdom in words.</P>
<P>16. Few only will turn away from the inspiration of the world, and come unto Me.</P>
<P>17. Many profess Me in words, but they do not fulfill My inspiration in practice.</P>
<P>18. My words come easily to the pure in heart; and My wisdom showeth itself in the frame of their speech.</P>
<P>19. For I give them words, even as I give to the animal inspiration to do perfectly and wisely the parts for which I created them.</P>
<P>20. Behold, I show the dumb spider how to weave its geometrical net; is it greater wonder for Me, to give words of wisdom to a righteous man?</P>
<P>21. Or to put him in the way of receiving My revelations?</P>
<P>22. Or to show him the harmony and glory of My creations?</P>
