### SANG.

1\. PRAISE ye the Almighty for Abraham and Brahma and Po. And their
followers that plodded along in the dark days.

2\. Praise ye the Supreme Being, ye followers of them, ye line of the
Light of the Great Spirit.

3\. To glorify the Creator in after generations, by the wisdom of His
choice, Who rose up great harvests in Vind'yu and Egupt and Chine'ya.

4\. Sing in his praise forever, the Creator, the Almighty. Shout long
and loud in the glory of Jehovih, Fashioner of mighty peoples.
