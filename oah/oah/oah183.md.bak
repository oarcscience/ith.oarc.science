### Chapter V

1\. WHEN the day arrived for the slaughter of the male infants, not more
than a thousand mothers appeared at the place of execution with their
infants, the others having risen in the night previous and departed out
of the gates, upward of eighty-nine thousand mothers.

2\. When the king went to the place of execution, having set apart the
day <span id="page_182b">p. 182b</span> as a holiday, and not finding
but a thousand infants present, he inquired the reason, and, having been
told, he said: Can it be that mothers love their offspring more than
they respect the decrees of the king? Asha was standing near, having
stripped himself ready for execution, and he answered the king, saying:

3\. Because they love their offspring, is it not the love of the flesh?
And doth not the law stand above all flesh? In this matter, then,
because they have evaded the law, they have adjudged themselves also to
death.

4\. Then came Betraj, the king's wife, bringing the infant. Betraj said:
Here is thy son, O king, ready for the sacrifice. Asha reasonest well;
there must be an All Highest, which never erreth; which is the law of
the king. Take thou my flesh and blood and prove thy decrees. What! Why
hesitate? If thou swerve one jot or tittle, then shalt thou open the
door for all men to find an excuse against the law. Doth not the sun
blight a harvest when he will? Yea, and strike dead our most beloved?
Art thou not descended from the Sun Gods? Who will obey the laws if
thou, thyself, do not?

5\. The king said: Behold, it is yet early morn; let the officers go
fetch all who have escaped beyond the walls, and both mothers and
children shall be put to death. Till then, let the proceedings be
suspended. Now there had congregated a vast multitude, anxious to
witness the slaughter; and when the king suspended matters, there went
up cries of disappointment. And many said: When a thing toucheth the
king, he is a coward.

6\. The king returned for his palace, leaving Asha standing stripped for
the execution. And the multitude cried out: More is Asha like a king
than So-qi. Let us make him king. King So-qi! We will not have a sheep
for a king! And none could stay them, or be heard above their noise; and
they ran after the king and slew him with stones, and they made Asha
King of the Sun. And there was not one infant slain according to the
decrees.

7\. God saith: Think not, O man, that things happen without a cause, or
that all things are left to chance. In my works I go beforehand and plan
<span id="page_183b">p. 183b</span> the way, even more carefully than a
captain lieth siege to a city. Before Zarathustra was born I sent ashars
to choose out my personages. Think not that Asha made his own arguments;
but by virtue of the presence of my ashars, whom he saw not, he spake
and behaved in my commandments, not knowing it. And even so was it with
the king's wife; my angels also inspired her to speak before the king.
And those that fled out of the city, were inspired by my hosts of
angels.

8\. God said: Yet with the king's decree I had no part, for I foresaw he
would do this of his own will; and with the multitude in slaying the
king I had no part, for I saw they would do this on their own account.
Neither would the multitude hear my voice, even though I had spoken to
every man's soul; for in them tetracts were the ascendant power.

9\. God saith: The multitude slew the king because he had gone so far
from me he heeded me not. And I made Asha king, because he came so near
me my power was with him through my ashars.
