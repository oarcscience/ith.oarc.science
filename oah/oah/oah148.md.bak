### Chapter XIII

1\. THEN Fragapatti sent swift messengers to Mouru, relating all that
had been accomplished, giving, also, the names of the generals and
captains over the newly established colonies redeemed from Utza, in the
Aoasuan mountains, so they might be registered in the libraries of
Haraiti. And Fragapatti established a line of messengers betwixt the
colonies, and also from the colonies to Mouru, and selected and
appointed the messengers, to hold office during dawn.

2\. And when the affairs of this region of the lower heavens were
completed and in working order, Fragapatti was ready to ascend with the
mad and dumb drujas rescued from hell. Accordingly, the proper persons
fell to work and carried them into the avalanza; being obliged to
blindfold them because of the light. Nor did the drujas cease wailing
and crying with fear and pain and craziness. But because of the
multitude of infants, Fragapatti had previously provided five hundred
thousand women of fetal, that the infants might be redeemed to
everlasting life.

3\. Sixty thousand physicians had Fragapatti aboard, and they fell to
work right and left, resuscitating and restoring to consciousness the
unfortunates. And of the hosts of Hoab, not one was there but went to
work, willingly, as nurse and helper.

4\. Now struck up the es'senaurs with music, thirty thousand of them,
but soft and gentle as a breath of wind, carrying the tones around about
the <span id="page_210a">p. 210a</span> ship, even as an endless echo,
calling and answering from all possible directions, a continuous and
enrapturing change, as if near, and as if far off. So that the
uninformed knew not whence the music came, nor how it was produced.

5\. All these things were set to working order just as the great
avalanza was ready to start. Then Fragapatti went into the ship, being
almost the last one to enter. Already was the light gathering bright and
dense about him, his head almost hid in the brilliancy of the halo. And
then he called out:

6\. Arise! Arise! In Jehovih's name, upward rise! And as he spake,
behold, the avalanza moved with his will, for all the hosts joined in
the same expression, and presently started upward the great fire-ship;
leaving the burning walls and signal centres flickering below, so that
even hell overthrown shone with great grandeur.

7\. Fragapatti spake to Hoab, saying: When I took thee and thy hosts
from Zeredho, I promised to take thee to Mouru, the capital city of
Haraiti, my kingdom. Now thou desirest me to go with these drujas to
Zeredho. I will ask thee now, thinkest thou that thou couldst plan their
salvation, and restore them to light?

8\. To which Hoab replied, saying: I perceive that of myself I can do
nothing but go down hill; or, at best, keep on a level road. As I now
comprehend All Light, there is no one thing in all the universe that can
rise of itself; but, by the external pressure of other things, all tend
downward, even man. To attain to be one with Jehovih is the beginning of
the resurrection of the individual; but he who hath attained power to
resurrect others is strong indeed. There are many who spasmodically
resurrect others, but, alas, how few can keep them resurrected! Not only
must he have the Light of Jehovih within himself, but power to make
others obtain the Light for themselves. Alas, I am weak!

9\. Fragapatti said: Understand thyself, O Hoab. Be not deceived, nor
short in faith to accomplish; for herein lieth the key to all Wisdom and
Power. Suffer not thyself to go to the other extreme, saying, man of
himself can accomplish nothing. To teach a child this, is to hew off its
legs and arms. To teach it that it can accomplish, is to make it
giant-like and effective.

10\. Hoab said: I perceive thy wisdom, O Chief. How, then, shall we find
a line by which we can train this economy? If we inspire them not with
faith to accomplish, they will accomplish nothing; if we teach them they
are dependent on Jehovih for all things, and that Jehovih doeth all
things, and that no man can change his own destiny, that he is moved as
a machine, then we will make nonentities of our people. On the other
hand, if we inspire them that they can accomplish, it will grow upon
them, and, finally, they will believe that they do all, and Jehovih
nothing. This was the mire my other kingdom ran into.

11\. Then spake Fragapatti, saying: Thou perceivest that reason cannot
solve the matter. Let us, then, suspend the subject, and I will take
thee to Mouru and her kingdoms, and we may obtain facts more pertinent
than opinion or reason.
