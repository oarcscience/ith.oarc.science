<P>And the <B>Beast</B> divided itself into four great heads, and possessed the earth about; and man fell down and worshipped them, 1.11.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">AS FOR EXAMPLE:</P>
</I><B><P>Looeamong</B> was the false God who founded, by inspiration, the great sect called <B>Christians</B>. He is first mentioned in Book of Eskra, chap xiii.; and his career is continued in the Books of Eskra and Es, until he is finally cast into hell, which corresponds in date to the time the pope established himself as vicegerent on earth, and very properly because his God was <I>non est</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_xiv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xiv</FONT></A></P>
<B><P>Kabalactes</B>, the God who, by inspiration, founded what is now called Buddhism. He is first mentioned in Book of Eskra, chap. xiii.; and his history is continued in Books of Eskra and Es, until he is finally cast into hell.</P>
<B><P>Ennochissa</B>, who, by inspiration, founded modern Brahmanism, first mentioned in Book of Eskra, chap. xiii. His history continues in Books of Eskra and Es, and he is finally cast into hell.</P>
<B><P>Thoth, or Gabriel</B>, who, by inspiration, founded Mohammedanism, first. mentioned in Book of Eskra, chap. xlix. He also is cast into hell, Book of Es, chap. xv.</P>
<P>These four false Gods were delivered out of hell by God, Jehovih's Son.</P>
<P>They figured largely in the great wars against Jehovih in the time of the ancient Jews.</P>
<P>Besides these there were many false Gods and one great Goddess, <B>Ashtaroth</B>. <B>Baal</B> and she were both overcome and cast into hell by the founder of Christianity, Looeamong, through his great warrior servant, Thoth.</P>
<P>Of the lesser attempts at false Godheads mention is made of <B>Sayawan</B>, founder of <B>Swedenborgism</B> (748.10 to 13), and of <B>Piad</B> (748.7-8), the founder of <B>Mormanism</B>; also of <B>Lowgannus</B>, the founder of <B>Shakerism</B> (748.9), showing that all these sects have had their origin in the lower heavens.</P></BODY
