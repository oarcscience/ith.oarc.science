### Chapter XIII

1\. SO God enlarged the place of Hored, and built one thousand more
pillars of fire, enlarging the circle and otherwise making it a place of
splendor. And God called together the recorders from the libraries of
heaven, and caused them to select one hundred thousand new members for
the house of Moeb (Parliament), choosing them from the highest on the
lists. In this matter, God said:

2\. Seek not the most learned, nor the most prayerful, for members; but
choose ye such as rank highest in assimilating to Jehovih and to their
fellows; for such are the first to become Gods and Goddesses. Jehovih
saith: A strong man may do more good works than a weak one; and yet the
latter may stand fairer in My sight. I open the way to the weak and the
strong; to the learned and the unlearned.

3\. God said: In all these matters, whatever man or woman hath put away
self-desires for self's sake, serving the Father by laboring for others,
is on the road to wisdom. And if the records show a sufficient time for
growth in such man or woman, whereby these virtues become organic, then
choose ye that person, for of such shall be Moeb.

4\. So the laborers gathered from the heavens around about, agni, and
built Moeb within, suitable for the members to be seated according to
their rank; <span id="page_32">p. 32</span> and when it was finished, on
that same day, the recorders brought the new members, and they went into
the temple to their respective places.

5\. And when seated, God spake from the throne, saying: To Thee, O
Jehovih, have I built the house of Moeb in Hored; and by Thy wisdom have
I chosen the members thereof. To Thee, O Father, I dedicate this house,
and it shall be Thy house. Give us of Thy light, O Jehovih, that we may
not err.

6\. A light descended from the heavens above and fell upon the members
of Moeb, as a symbol of approval by the archangels; and presently the
new members rose up, every one of their own accord, but the old members
remained seated.

7\. God said: Above your heads I make the sign of Jehovih's name, in a
circle of fire, and the cross, and the leaf of life; for by it are ye
sworn to the Father's labor.

8\. Hear me, then, O my beloved: Ye are henceforth denied individual
ministration with individuals, but ye are now become a unit with many,
and with these must your labor and your love and your wisdom be in
concert of action.

9\. Henceforth must ye no longer say: What can I do for this man or that
man, or this woman or that woman, or this child or that child? For this
is individual labor; and on the earth such ministration belongeth to the
ashars; and in atmospherea, such ministration belongeth to the asaphs.
But ye shall minister to organic communities who are composed of
individuals. For there are communities for factories, and others for
education, and others for treatment of the sick; and such communities
exist both on earth and in heaven.

10\. Ye shall divide yourselves into groups for this purpose, and every
group shall have its special business in charge; and each group shall
stand in Moeb as one member of Jehovih's judgment seat. According to
your talents shall ye divide, and group together, choosing such
department wherein each one hath the greatest wisdom and strength.
Withdraw, then, and thus complete your groups according to the rates my
proper officers will assign, and then return again into Moeb, and in
Jehovih's name, take the seats allotted to you all.
