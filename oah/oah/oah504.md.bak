### Chapter XXI

1\. BAAL, God of the Argos'yans (Greeks), called together two thousand
million angel warriors, and after properly officering them, caused them
to assemble in Beth'hagas, a sub-kingdom of heaven over the Tillag
mountains, to the north of Macedon, and he said unto them:

2\. Behold, your Creator, who I am! By my breath upon the earth ye came
forth. I am he, who was of old called, De'yus, Lord God of heaven and
earth. All places are my places, all dominion is mine.

3\. My heavens gave I unto you for your inheritance forever. But an evil
Goddess, Ashtaroth, hath come to despoil you.

4\. And she hath sworn upon her thighs to cast you into endless
torments.

5\. Behold, I have sworn a new oath on the sun and moon and stars! Ye
shall capture her, and cast her and all her angels into hell, to so
abide forever.

6\. For I will clear the heavens and the earth, and they shall be clean
and full of delight.

7\. Hear ye, then, the commandment of your God, Baal, ruler of heaven
and earth: Ye shall go down to the earth, to the Argos'yans, and obsess
them, man, woman and child, and inspire them to terrible deeds of blood
and havoc and death against the Parsi'e'ans who are coming against them.

8\. And whilst ye are thus providing corporeal destruction for this evil
Goddess, my heavenly hosts under Yaawochad, my Lord of Agansetha, shall
attack her angel armies in every quarter of these heavens.

9\. And as fast as her drujas are captured, they shall be cast into the
hells of Gotha, which I have prepared for them. And to all my valorous
workers will I give great promotion and power. Ye shall have servants
and slaves without number.

10\. Now, it came to pass, that many years of war and destruction
ensued; but Baal's hosts were too powerful for Ashtaroth. And so Baal
not only overcame her angel warriors on the earth, but in her heavenly
capital also. And his legions rushed upon her, and captured her. Whereat
her own angels turned against her, perceiving now that she was an
imposter, and not the Creator.

11\. And they bound her, and carried her and her Lords and Gods off to
Toosemmes, a heavenly place of foul smells, in Gotha, and they built
here a place of torment for her and them, and cast them in. And they
brought hither tens of thousands of her officers, and cast them in, and
also the spirits of kings and queens and of generals and captains who
had been her devotees, who were slain in battle, and who were yet in
chaos.

12\. Thus ended the God-ship of Ashtaroth. And there were thus cast into
this hell, voluntary and involuntary, two thousand million angels.

13\. Looeamong, the Triune God, said: This is the end, number one; next
shall fall Baal; and him will I cast in hell also.

14\. As to mortals, Xerxes' mighty armies lived not to return to
Parsi'e, but were scattered and destroyed. As to the Argos'yans, they
were a ruined people.

15\. And all those countries were covered over with the spirits of the
dead, in chaos.

16\. For these wars had been going on for many, many years.

17\. Hear ye, next of Kabalactes, Triune God of Vind'yu and her heavens.
