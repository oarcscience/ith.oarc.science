### Chapter IX

1\. WHEN Capilya had come to Wes-tu-chaw-aw, Jehovih said to him: Send
messengers into twelve colonies which I will name to thee, to the chief
rab'bahs thereof, summoning them hither, for thou shalt teach them alike
and like.

2\. The colonies were: Tahdayis, L'wellaat, Ha'darax, Thowaka,
Dormstdatta, Ghiballatu, Yhon, Themmista, Vrach'hao, Ebotha, Ewen and
Sravat, and each of them sent the high priest (rab'bah) with three
accompanying rab'bahs, so that in all, there were thirteen chief
rab'bahs, and thirty-nine rab'bahs. And Capilya caused them to put on
red hats, without brims, after the custom of the ancient Zarathustrians.

3\. Jehovih said to Capilya: Choose thou twenty damsels who are young
and well grown; and twenty dames who have borne children. And these
shalt thou adorn with blue hats with ear-flaps, after the manner of the
Daughters of the Zarathustrian law.

4\. When Capilya had them clothed with hats and aprons, he caused the
rab'bahs and the women to go with him to the summit of a mountain, so
that they might not be approached by idlers or spectators without due
warning. And on the summit of the mountain Capilya said: When ye were
babes, I prayed for you; now that ye are mature ye shall worship the
Creator <span id="page_480b">p. 480b</span> with your own words. Bring,
therefore, every one a stone, and cast it down, for it shall be an altar
before Jehovih for our sacrifice. And as I do, do ye.

5\. They all took stones and cast them in a pile; and when they were yet
standing near, Capilya raised his hands to heaven and said: Father, when
I was weak, Thou providedst for me. My mother and my father and my
rab'bah prayed for me, and taught me of Thee. Wherefore I praise Thee
with thanks and glorification. Now that I am strong, I stand upright
before Thee and praise Thee and pray to Thee with mine own words, and
not as the heathen who have priests to pray for them.

6\. Because Thou madest me a man (woman) I will labor to prove myself
before Thee. As I have here cast down this stone, let it stand as my
covenant to Thee that I will from this time cast away earthly passions
and desires. And because I have raised up both my hands unto Thee, lead
Thou me, O Father, in the right way!

7\. When they had all repeated these words, Capilya walked once around
the altar, followed by the others, and he said: Jehovih (Ormazd)
Almighty, glory be to Thee forever! Thou art on the mountain-top and in
the valley; Thy circle is the circumference of the world. I walk in the
circle with Thee; Thou art forever by my side; Thy light the glory of my
soul. Praise Him, O ye mountains and valleys; sing to Him, thou moon,
and ye stars; His hand holdeth ye up; His breath moveth all things!

8\. In Thee I live; of Thyself madest Thou me! O that I may not dishonor
Thy handiwork; or make myself ashamed before Thee. Because Thou art Ever
Present, I fear Thee; because I can not hide from Thee, I will be most
circumspect in my behavior.

9\. Capilya then sat down on the altar, saying: Go ye hence a little
way, and then return, that I may teach you how to approach the altar of
Jehovih. The people did as commanded, and when they came near, Capilya
said: Who cometh?

10\. Now herein are the questions and answers as Jehovih taught His
children through Capilya:

11\. A worshipper of Jehovih (Ormazd): Behold, the altar of My people,
who are known by their piety and good works, and in helping one another.

<span id="page_481b">p. 481b</span>

12\. Who is Jehovih?

13\. The Ever Present. He filleth all place and space. He created me
alive, and taught me to adore Him and His works.

14\. Why comest thou to this place above any other? If He be Ever
Present why not worship Him in any other place?

15\. He sendeth guardian angels to abide with His children who are pure
and good. These angels desire certain places and times, wherein my soul
may be given to Jehovih. Through His holy angels He teacheth me in
wisdom and love.

16\. Why not worship the angels themselves, since they are thy guardians
and benefactors?

17\. To call not on the name of any angel who is Lord or God, is my
religion; but to call on Jehovih, the Great Spirit. Whoso calleth on the
name of angels, or Lords, or Gods, will be answered by them, but whoso
calleth on the Creator will be answered by Him, Who is the All Highest.

18\. How can Jehovih answer thee? Hath He lips, and tongue, and mouth?

19\. Jehovih is the Soul of all things; He speaketh to Soul. His voice
hath had many names; by the heathen and the idolator he is called
Conscience.

20\. What profit hath thou in worshipping Him?

21\. I am so created; because of the fullness of Him in me, I desire to
express my adoration, and to commune with Him. Whoso hath not this
desire is an evil man.

22\. Will He answer thy prayers? Turn aside from His usual course and
come especially to thee more than to another?

23\. As a horse drinketh water from a trough and so enlargeth himself,
so doth the soul of the righteous man drink from the Everlasting
Fountain, Jehovih, and the soul of man thus enlargeth and accomplisheth
in answer to its own prayer; nevertheless, it all cometh from Jehovih.
Neither turneth He aside from His usual course, for He is Ever Present,
and thus answereth the prayer of the soul of man.

24\. What prayers answereth He? And what prayers answereth He not?

25\. He answereth the prayer for purity and love and wisdom and virtue.
Whoso prayeth to Him for permission to do good unto others, He answereth
<span id="page_482b">p. 482b</span> without fail. He answereth not
selfishness, nor the prayers of the wicked. Wherefore the wicked say: He
answereth not prayer.

26\. Capilya said: My beloved, when ye approach the altar of Jehovih, ye
shall repeat the wise words I have taught you; but not aloud like the
idolators, but in whisper or low voice.

27\. What is the worship of Jehovih's chosen? and wherein differeth it
from the heathen's?

28\. Jehovih's chosen stand equal before the Father, and everyone shall
work out his own resurrection, both in this world and the next. Hence
they are direct worshippers, being taught to worship Jehovih with their
own prayers and songs. The heathen have priests to do worship for the
people, who contribute to them in money for the service. The heathen
priests worship the spirits of the dead, who call themselves Lord, and
God, and Savior. The chosen children war not, resent not by violence,
but answer evil by good, and practice charity and love. The heathen, the
worshippers of God, and of Lord, and of Dyaus, and all other idols,
practice war, maintain armies of soldiers, who are taught the art of
killing with great havoc. They build monuments to men, and otherwise
blaspheme against Jehovih. They teach that Jehovih is void, but that He
made Himself into Dyaus, a large man, and then created all things, after
which He retired to His throne, leaving certain laws to govern His
works.

29\. What is the Zarathustrian law of life?

30\. To eat not flesh of anything Jehovih created with the breath of
life. To bathe once every day. To rise with the morning sun, and be
temperate in all things.

31\. What is the Zarathustrian fatherhood and motherhood?

32\. To have but one wife; to have but one husband; to maintain sacred
the maternal period.

33\. What was the Zarathustrian compensation?

34\. All things belong to Jehovih; man is but His servant. The fruits of
the earth and of all labor shall be cast into the rab'bah's house, and
by him delivered unto the needy.

<span id="page_483b">p. 483b</span>

35\. Why were the Zarathustrians persecuted and destroyed?

36\. Because they resisted not by violence, and because they worshipped
not the idols of the heathens.

37\. Had they no way of saving themselves?

38\. To that end Jehovih gave them certain signs and pass-words, whereby
they might know one another, and in time of distress assist one another
to flee away.

39\. Why did not Jehovih preserve His chosen people?

40\. By the laws of circumcision the Faithists could only marry amongst
themselves, in order to preserve a knowledge of Jehovih (Ormazd) amongst
mortals. They who were holy were preserved; they who went after earthly
things, and after the idolators, were cut off. But even in this Jehovih
profited the seed of the Faithist, by raising up heirs of su'is amongst
the heathen.

41\. Capilya said: Teach ye these things to your children from their
youth up, and enjoin it upon them to teach them to their children.
