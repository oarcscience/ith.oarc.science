### Chapter VIII

1\. THUS Osire established Vibhraj, the resplendent heaven, with a
thousand and eight hundred sub-kingdoms, in atmospherea, all under the
commandments of the central kingdom. And then he established the
roadways between them, and appointed seven hundred thousand messengers.
After that he ordained proper officers for inter-communion; and the
several sub-kingdoms established their places of learning and places of
<span id="page_164">p. 164</span> labor; their hospitals and nurseries,
and their innumerable asaphs, the receivers of es'yans, the newborn
spirits of the dead of earth.

2\. Osire said: Behold, there is order in heaven. Now will I appoint a
God to hold dominion two hundred years. For whilst the dawn of dan yet
remaineth, I will assist him. Let the examiners search, then, amongst my
hosts, from such as sprang from the earth, such one as standeth clear on
the record, and chief in rank.

3\. So the examiners searched; and after thirty days, they selected
Konas; and when Osire was informed, he sent a thousand of his own
attendants, in an otevan, and they brought Konas to Vibhraj, to
Jehovih's throne. Osire said:

4\. Greeting, in the name of the Father! Thou art chosen above all
others; and, after the dawn of dan is ended, thou shalt be God of heaven
and earth for two hundred years. Before the ascent of my hosts and of
myself, behold, I will crown thee. Till then, thou shalt sit on my
throne, and fill my place whilst I am absent.

5\. I have now restored order in heaven, having given all the
inhabitants a single purpose in concert, whereby their resurrection is
surely founded. Now will I go down to the false Lords' kingdoms, on the
earth, and to the mortal kings and queens, and restore order there also.

6\. Konas said: Thy will and Jehovih's be done! I am exalted and
rejoiced in what is bestowed upon me. Make me strong and wise, O
Jehovih, that I may glorify Thy kingdoms!

7\. So, after due preparation, Osire departed privately, taking with him
one hundred thousand attendants, going down to the earth and to the
false Lords' kingdoms, in the cities and temples of mortals.

8\. Seven days Osire spent traveling round about the earth, visiting
angels and mortals, but telling none who he was, or what was his object;
and then he halted his otevan, which had been built for the purpose, in
the regions of the mountains of We-ont-ka-woh, in Western Jaffeth. He
said:

9\. We-ont-ka-woh shall be my headquarters for a season. Here, then,
will I found the first Lord's kingdom for mortals; and inasmuch as
mortals have made an idol of Apollo, so will I cast down Apollo, and
make them know that I, Osire, am Lord of the earth. Then spake We'taing,
saying:

10\. Behold the glory of Jehovih from the first! In our journey around
the earth, we have found the I'hins not idolators, but still worshippers
of the Great Spirit, Jehovih. But as to the half-breeds, who can
understand them? They believe nothing; they believe everything. They ask
the idol for rain, and for dry weather! For strength to slay the druks;
for flesh to eat, and for famine to be visited on their enemies.

11\. They are as living prey for druj to feast on; they invite the
darkest of all evil. And to do their wills in return, the druj, the evil
spirits, busy themselves inoculating the air with poison to kill their
enemies.

12\. Osire said: With the I'hins we have little to do; but as to the
Ghans and the I'huans, they shall be converted into disbelievers of all
spirits, save two, Jehovih and satan.

13\. To accomplish which end, I will give them three figures: The signs
of seasons, which shall represent the Creator in all the parts of the
living; the sign of the sun, with motion and all life coming forth; and
the hand of man.
