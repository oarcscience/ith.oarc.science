<P>1. WHEN the ceremonies were ended, Onesyi said: Soon, now, in the name of the Father will we rise and go a long journey; and that ye may be apprised and consorted in love, I proclaim the freedom of the hour in Jehovih's name.</P>
<P>2. And the people went and mingled with each other, rejoicing and saluting. And Ha'jah and God and Etisyai greeted one another, and the Lords came forward, and were also greeted; and then the marshals and the es'enaurs and all long-serving laborers. And lastly, all that had redeemed any man or woman from darkness to light, came also, and were saluted and duly honored.</P>
<P>3. And for the space of one hour all the angels indulged in revelry, reunion and fullness of heart; but no book could relate the thousandth part of the questions asked and love assurances expressed.</P>
<P>4. When the hour was ended, Onesyi signalled the proper officer, and he sounded the gavel thrice, whereupon all was hushed and still. Onesyi said:</P>
<P>5. As Jehovih bestoweth a newborn child, so also doth He take the father and the mother away to the es world. As Jehovih sent Etisyai, my sister, to establish the lower heaven, so have I come by His command to bear hence this harvest to His everlasting kingdom. As a child bewaileth the loss of its father and mother, so will ye that remain bewail the loss of this rich harvest of archangels.</P>
<P>6. It is Jehovih's will that ye drink deep of the sorrow of parting, for by this bondage will ye be again reunited in the heavens still above. The progress of the soul of man is forever onward, and in steps and plateaux; and the glory of the resurrection of him that goeth before is equally great as is the sorrow of him that remaineth behind. But the love that bindeth together is as a chain outstretched across the universe; nor time nor distance shall prevail against the inventions thereof.</P>
<P>7. Swift messengers, well trained to course the vault of heaven, will pass between you, carrying the tidings of your soul's delight. And as Jehovih giveth summer to follow winter, and the winter the summer, so also shall the time again and again, forever, in which ye shall mingle and part; again labor together, but in broader fields, and again part for a season.</P>
<P>8. Behold the wisdom of Jehovih in placing far apart the places of the souls of men; for all things abiding near together equalize themselves. Even as there is glory in a new birth, so is there glory in death; as there is sorrow in death, so is there joy in resurrection. The time is now come when these that ye see, ye shall not see for a long season; but ye shall rejoice in this hour of parting, for they rise as Brides and Bridegrooms to Jehovih.</P>
<P>9. The es'enaurs sang an anthem of praise in which all the hosts united, and great was the glory thereof. And now Onesyi arose, saying:</P>
<P>10. JEHOVIH, ALMIGHTY AND EVERLASTING! HOLY, HOLY CREATOR, RULER AND GIVER FORTH! LOOK UPON THIS THY SON, HA'JAH! O FATHER, IN THY NAME AND BY VIRTUE OF THY POWER IN ME VESTED, DO I PERPETUATE AND CROWN HIM GOD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH!</P>
<P>11. Ha'jah, now God, said: THY WILL BE DONE, O JEHOVIH! Then Onesyi turned to the five chief Lords of the five divisions of the earth, and bestowed them in like manner.</P>
<P>12. And Onesyi stretched forth her hand, saying: Give me a crown, O Jehovih, for Thy Son, God of heaven and <A NAME="page_41"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 41</FONT></A> earth! And there descended etherean substance into her hand, and she raised it up, and lo, it became a crown of great beauty, and she put in on God's (Ha'jah's) head. Then in like manner did she crown the Lords of the earth.</P>
<P>13. And Etisyai and Onesyi came down and sat at the foot of the throne.</P>
<P>14. God (that had been Ha'jah) came down and Whaga and Jud with him, and stretching forth their hands, they said to Etisyai, Onesyi and Sethantes, the retiring God:</P>

<P>15. And they rose up and marched forth. The proper officers had already prepared the ship for its etherean journey; and soon as Etisyai and Onesyi had entered the central star, all the people that were to ascend went into the places assigned to them.</P>
<P>16. God (that had been Ha'jah) and the Lords returned, in tears, to the throne, and now the plateau of everlasting light began to ascend. Music sprang from every side, glorifying Jehovih and the magnificence of His bountiful worlds.</P>
<P>17. And those of the lower heaven were as the echo of the music above; and the light of the ascending ship of fire made all else as a shadow. But higher and higher it arose, in the form of a crescent, slowly turning on its upright axis, turning and rising, higher and higher, and the music faded away in the distance.</P>
<P>18. In a little while the meteor-like ascending ship of heaven looked like a star, till farther and farther off it disappeared in the distance.</P>
<P>19. Thus ascended to the emancipated heavens in etherea the first harvest of angels born of the earth.</P>
