### Chapter XXV

1\. JEHOVIH said to Lika: Finish thy visit and thy inspection, My Son,
in all the places of hada on the earth, leaving the land of Jaffeth to
the last. And thou shalt go thither, at the time of Chine's
resurrection, and descend with thy ship and take him up from the earth.

2\. And thou shalt bring him with thee to Yogannaqactra, where he shall
remain the few days that dawn remaineth; and when thy hosts ascend to
etherea thou shalt take Chine with thee and make thy home his home until
such time as he may be taught the ways and powers of the higher heavens.

3\. For since his corporeal life is a sacrifice for the resurrection of
men, he shall receive especial care and assistance in heaven.

4\. Lika had been previously informed by the God of Chine as to the time
Chine would die, and be burnt up, with his ashes scattered to the four
winds; and the re-gathering up of a corporeal form of Chine, and the
seven days' duration thereof. So Lika shaped the course of his otevan,
according to the instruction of his messengers, who had been appointed
for that purpose, so that he should reach the field in time to raise up
Chine before the multitude.

5\. The God of Chine had prophesied to mortals through his ward that a
fire-ship would descend from heaven on a given day, and take Chine up to
heaven.

6\. Accordingly a great multitude of mortals were assembled in the
ash-field, where they cast the ashes of the dead, watching for the
heavenly ship.

7\. Of which matters Lika had been previously informed by his
messengers; and Lika had in turn informed the God of Chine the time he
would appear with the ship, that he might cause Chine to walk in the
midst of the field and so be caught up.

8\. And all these matters were carried out to the hour and minute, in
the hands of these great Gods. And Lika caused the fire of the ship to
be made visible to mortals. And the size of the ship was ten times
larger than the field of the dead, so that when the people beheld the
light of the ship they feared and trembled, and many of them fell down
bewailing that the world was coming to an end.

9\. And God caused Chine to walk out in the field, and Lika sent down a
whirlwind and took him up into the ship, in presence of tens of
thousands of mortals assembled.

10\. And Lika bore his course now for Yogannaqactra, for the end of the
dawn of Bon was at hand.
