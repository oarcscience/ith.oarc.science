### Chapter XVII

1\. NOW was the atmospherea like a new heaven stripped of visitors, and
ready to resume labor after a glorious festival. So God at once
dispatched all hands to their places, and the factories, schools and
colleges, nurseries and hospitals, were once more alive with willing
workers.

2\. And Hored prospered in every department; and so also did the
departments of the Lords on earth; and mortals also prospered under the
light of the Great Spirit.

3\. For four hundred years God reigned in heaven, and his Lords under
him, and the second dan of Aph fell upon earth and heaven. So God
appointed AN'ON as his successor. And now Aph and his attendants came to
deliver God; his Lords and people prepared for their resurrection up
into etherea.

4\. And the number of Jehovih's harvest was one thousand million souls.

5\. And God (An'on) reigned his time, and his Lords under him, and they
were also delivered by Aph, but by proxy, and the harvest of Jehovih was
eight hundred million souls.

6\. And his successor, God of Hored and atmospherea, and his Lords,
fulfilled their dan, and they and their harvests were delivered by the
proxy of Aph also; and the number of souls delivered was six hundred
million. And Jehovih commanded Aph to commit atmospherea and the earth
to the successors of Ra'zan of Garowista, in Ems of the etherean phalanx
of eighty Ar'doth.

7\. And the next harvest of God and his Lords was two hundred million
souls. After that the earth passed into the a'ji of Urk'stand for eight
hundred years, and the light of the upper heaven was lost to earth and
atmospherea; so there was no harvest for the etherean realms. And
because of the darkness in atmospherea it began to fall in hada; and the
seven entities of tetracts took root in Hored, and overspread the
dominions of God and his Lords. And many in heaven rose up, and,
proclaiming themselves Gods or Lords, obtained followers, some to the
extent of three millions of souls.

8\. And these false Gods made slaves of their followers, exacting
service, and in lieu giving pitiful homes and regimen; and by the labor
of their slaves embellishing their mansions and cities in hada.

9\. Jehovih had said of old: Before mortals I keep death forever present
that they may not forget the change from corporeal to spirit life;
otherwise they would dispute it possible in My hands for these things to
be. But My resurrections in heaven are far apart, and the inhabitants
thereof lose faith in those above them. Through faith is all power and
glory attained; therefore have I exacted that angels cultivate faith in
the next resurrection.

10\. But during the last thousand years in atmospherea, there being no
resurrections to etherea, many fell into disbelief of the emancipated
heavens, and so sat about, building up heavenly kingdoms on their own
account, and for their own glory. And in order to have exalted kingdoms
they sent their slaves back to mortals to inspire them with the glory of
their false God's kingdoms, that others in turn might become slaves
also.

11\. So confusion began in heaven again, and it reacted on mortals,
through the angels' presence, and war and misery overspread the nations
and tribes of men on earth. Thus ended the cycle of Aph's arc of Noe,
which was three thousand six hundred years.
