### Chapter VII

1\. HAVING shown the impossibility of philosophy based on corporeal
knowledge to demonstrate truth in regard to unseen things, and in regard
to planets distant from the earth, it becometh a part of these
revelations to put the student in the way to learn from the unseen
forces which govern all corporeal things, man included, as a general and
important part.

2\. When a heavy stone falleth on a man and holdeth him down, it is
sufficient to say the stone ruleth over the man. If an epidemic come
upon a city because of uncleanness, it is well to consider that cause
also. Nevertheless, if an epidemic be periodical to a certain city, even
when not unclean, it is wise to prophesy an unseen cause. The <span
id="page_584">p. 584</span> same rule applieth in comparing one locality
with another.

3\. In certain regions of the earth, certain diseases are common; in
certain times of the earth, as to cycles of three thousand years,
certain diseases were common. In certain places of the earth man hath at
times, thousands of years ago, attained to great knowledge and virtue.
But his whole country in after centuries became a wilderness.

4\. It is not the place of a prophet to answer these things by the
accusation of ignorance or war. The prophet must account for that
tendency in man to fall into ignorance and into war. In other words, he
must find the cause of causes.

5\. At certain periods of time, for hundreds of years, nations have
dwelt in peace, and have risen in virtue; then turned to war within
themselves and gone down in death.

6\. The prophets of old divided time into cycles of three thousand
years, with slight variations. And they found that at such periods of
time, some certain impulse came upon the people, causing them to try to
be better and wiser. Even as the same feeling is this day manifesting
itself in many nations.

7\. The scale then riseth for four hundred years, more or less; and,
after that, wars and epidemics come upon the people. They begin then to
decline, especially in virtue and peace, but the general intelligence
suffereth little for about another six or seven hundred years. After
which time they destroy their libraries and records, and reduce
themselves to ignorance and vice. Then followeth a darkness of one
thousand or more years, with slight intermissions. In other six hundred
years the corporeal senses begin to ascend. Self-conceit cometh upon
them; they think they are the beginning of wisdom on earth. Then cometh
another cycle of light. Angels descend from the unseen worlds. New
revelations crop out in every quarter. Inspiration cometh upon mortals,
and they go to the opposite extreme; superstition and obedience to
unseen influences.

8\. Such, then, is the general character and behavior of man during a
cycle. And he riseth and falleth in all these particulars as regularly
as the tides of the ocean.

9\. That man may begin to comprehend these things, and learn to classify
them so as to rise in wisdom and virtue, and thus overcome these
epidemic seasons of cycles, these revelations are chiefly made.

10\. As previously shown, there are positive and negative forces forever
going to and escaping from the earth. Without these no creature could
live on the earth. The negative imparteth to man his corporeal growth,
and corporeal desires, passions, and so on.

11\. According to the corpor solutions in the firmament and their
precipitations to the earth, as to quantity and quality, so will man be
affected and inclined to manifest. These influences are easily
discernible by some persons. One is depressed by a dull day; another
inclined to drunkenness and fighting. By a bright day man is inspired to
energy.

12\. A su'is is so susceptible to vortexian currents, he can realize the
qualities of a medicine whilst it is yet in a glass bottle, by merely
holding it in his hand; or know the character of the writer of a letter
by holding the letter in his hand. Yet all this is accomplished by the
vortexian current of the article in question.

13\. These revelations however are not in reference to individuals, but
to nations and peoples, in periods of time embracing hundreds of years,
and thousands of years.

14\. It is an error to say whilst the corporeal worlds are organized,
with fixed orbits and uses, the unseen worlds are nothing, or at best
not organized. They are organized, with orbits, places, forms, figures,
and so on, as definitely as are the corporeal worlds. Their times and
seasons are regular and well provided.

15\. In the passage of the earth in its own roadway, it goeth amongst
these etherean and atmospherean worlds regularly; so that the periods of
inspiration, and periods of darkness, are not haphazard.

16\. It is not the purpose of these revelations to work out prophecies,
leaving nothing for man to do. But to call his attention to the unseen
forces that rule on the earth, and show him the way to make the
prophecies himself.

17\. In orachnebuahgalah the student will draw a curved line,
representing the travel of the great serpent for three thousand years.
This shall be cut across in eight places, to represent the periods of
light. The places between them shall be made dark and light according to
the history of man's behavior during said three thousand years. War
shall be represented by black. The duration of wars shall be marked with
a cut called change. Numbers shall designate the degrees of historical
manifestations. For every great division of the earth make one
orachnebuahgalah. The scale should be <span id="page_585">p. 585</span>
from one to a thousand for the entire length; and from one to a thousand
from one dawn to another, and from one to a thousand for each and every
characteristic designated. Number man 1 and 33, and the moon 1 and 18;
and number the earth 1 and 365. These were called by the ancients the
grades of a thousand (So-e-cen-ti).

Plate 61.--ORACHNEBUAHGALAH.

18\. These periods will be found to come under certain numbers, 11, 33,
66, 99, 100, 200, 400, 666, 333, 66, 18, 500, 600, 365, 99, 33, 18, and
so on. (Not that the numbers, as such, have anything to do with such
matters.) Thus, the moon's time is 18, the earth's 365, a generation 33,
dan 200, 400, 600, 500; nitrogen or darkness 66 and 666, and so on. For
