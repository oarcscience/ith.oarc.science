<P>1. THESE are the words of Tae, in kosmon: I am Light; I am Central, but Boundless, saith Jehovih.</P>
<P>2. I give thee of My Light; and when thou hast received, thou criest out: Behold, I am wise!</P>
<P>3. Thy corpor I made, in which to localize thee; to mature thy entity.</P>
<P>4. Without Me, thou hadst not come to life. Thou art as the end of a ray of light from My Person.</P>
<P>5. And thou art focalized in thy corporeal body.</P>
<P>6. I am to thy spirit, as is the sun to a ray of light. I am the Light that illuminateth thy soul.</P>
<P>7. The ray of light that goeth out of Me, taketh root in mortality, and thou art the product, the tree.</P>
<P>8. Thou wert nothing; though all things that constitute thee, were before.</P>
<P>9. These I drove together, and quickened.</P>
<P>10. Thus I made thee.</P>
<P>11. After the manner I made thee corporeally, so made I thee spiritually, intellectually.</P>
<P>12. As out of corpor I made thy corporeal body, so, out of My Light, which is My Very Self, I built thee up in spirit, with consciousness that thou art.</P>
<P>13. Thou canst not add one jot or tittle to thy corporeal self, of thine own will and exertion.</P>
<P>14. It is by and through Me, that the process of absorption by the blood addeth unto thee.</P>
<P>15. Thy blood floweth in thy veins because of My quickening power upon thee.</P>
<P>16. When I withdraw My hand, thou diest. Life and death are of Me.</P>
<P>17. All thy corporeal part is, therefore, of Me and through Me.</P>
<P>18. Even so is thy spirit of Me also.</P>
<P>19. And as thou canst not add a fraction to thy corporeal self, neither canst thou add a fraction to thy spiritual self.</P>
<P>20. Out of Myself groweth thy spirit.</P>
<P>21. Neither canst thou, of thine own self, manufacture or acquire or take unto thyself, one new thought, nor idea, nor invention.</P>
<P>22. All thought and knowledge and judgment which thou hast, I gave unto thee.</P>
<P>23. As the whirlwind gathereth up dust, and driveth it toward a center, so is the plan of My universe.</P>
<P>24. Thou art as a center; all things come to thee from without.</P>
<P>25. Thy knowledge, as well as thy corporeality, came to thee from without, from that which was external to thyself.</P>
