### SAR.

1\. ALMIGHTY! Almighty! Love Abounding! Who gathered up the dust of the
earth, as a wind, with judgment and forethought; and sorted the
substance thereof and shaped it.

2\. None but Thee, Jehovih, looked on or knew Thy proceedings. And to
one Thou saidst: Be thou a beast of the field; and to another: Be thou a
serpent; and to another: Be thou a wild beast of the forest.

3\. And they ran forth at Thy command, every one to his place, rejoicing
in the work of Thy hand. And I looked thereon, O Thou Almighty! What
work of perfection in each, even to the flesh and bones.

4\. But Thou turnedst mine eyes inward, and I saw the wisdom of the
serpent and the beast; and the thoughts and desires of their
understanding, how perfectly Thou hast made them.

5\. I saw the love Thou gavest each unto its own kind; yea, even the
serpent gathered up her young, because of her love, to shield them from
harm.

6\. O that I could find the first Cause of the judgment of every living
thing! To come close to the Almighty; to question Him!

7\. Thou Who shapedst a moiety of earth, and said: Be thou a bird, with
feathers! Fly and sing! And it went forth, upward in the air of heaven,
rejoicing in Thy name, Jehovih!

8\. To another: Be thou an eagle; in ice and snow freeze not; above the
clouds proclaim the Almighty!
