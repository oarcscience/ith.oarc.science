### Chapter LVI

GOD CONTINUETH HIS CHASTISEMENT OF THE FOUR FALSE GODS.

1\. IN the name of the Almighty, my brothers, look at the glory ye boast
of!

2\. Ye say: Behold, we have scattered Jehovih's Faithists into all the
places of the earth; they are without a kingdom; they have not left one
community to themselves on the whole earth!

3\. Think ye, Jehovih hath appropriated them?

4\. Behold, it is true, ye have despoiled them, and scattered them
abroad.

5\. Ye have hunted them down in Chine'ya, Vind'yu, Arabin'ya, Parsi'e,
Heleste and Uropa.

6\. Ye have denied them the right to own lands, the right to follow
their choice of avocations.

7\. Ye have denied them justice, and even a hearing, in courts of trial.

8\. And your accusation against them was: They worship not Gods born of
woman.

9\. But behold the wisdom of Jehovih; because ye thus dispossessed His
people, and they were scattered abroad, they have sown the doctrine of
the All One over all the earth and in the heavens thereof.

10\. They have been as a leaven, to work in the foundations of mighty
kingdoms and empires.

11\. They have given learning unto all peoples, to show the magnificence
of Jehovih's universe.

12\. Behold, inhabitants of the earth now look upward, and ask: May
there not be other worlds? How long hath been the earth standing? Could
the <span id="page_724">p. 724</span> Creator of thousands of millions
of worlds, which have stood for thousands of millions of years, be so
young as any one of these pretended Gods? And descend to earth, and do a
work so imperfectly that only one small kingdom heard of him?
