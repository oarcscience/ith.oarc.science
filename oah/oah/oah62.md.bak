### Chapter V

1\. JEHOVIH said: Now will I bewail thee, O earth. The glories of thy
heavens that are past and gone shall be a lesson to the Gods. Thy place
of Hored, once the place of the wisdom of My Son, Sethantes, upraised,
behold it is measured and gone down. <span id="page_80a">p. 80a</span>
And Moeb is no more: Yeshuah is fallen. Where floated the plateaux of
many resurrections, are now miring vampires and millions of souls that
hear not and see not, but are forever burrowing deep in everlasting
darkness.

2\. The plateaux are broken up; the substance scattered and unorganized;
nor is there a vestige left to show the glorious work of the Gods of the
earth's past day.

3\. Hear me, O ye Gods and Goddesses, for in beholding these deep
miseries, the soul is quickened to retain great wisdom: Thus created I
man; out of darkness created I him; and My holy angels taught him to
walk upright and gave him My commandments that he might advance to
eternal light. But because man obeyed not the commandments of My God and
Lords, he fell. Nevertheless, a few obeyed the commandments and fell
not, raising up heirs for the glory of My heavens above.

4\. Of such have I made an example on all the corporeal worlds I
created; for those that fell not, became examplers before the fallen;
for having faith in Me and My works they questioned not My wisdom and
justice.

5\. But of those that fell, this is the history: They first questioned
My Person; next My Wisdom; next My Justice; next My Power. And after
that proclaimed the folly of God and his Lords; whereupon they usurped
to themselves to say: There is nothing higher than man. And they said of
themselves: I am the highest.

6\. Hear My voice, O ye Gods and Goddesses; for as out of a contrary
wind I give a mortal sea-captain a wholesome lesson; or as out of a
severe winter I give a corporeal farmer a lesson in providing for his
household; even so, on the brink of a wicked world, give I ye a lesson
on the management of My kingdoms. For from this time forth the earth
shall not fail; nor her heavens above her. Wherein, then, shall not My
Gods rule over her in wisdom and power?

7\. Since many angels assumed they were the All Highest, they put aside
the commandments, one of which was: To suffer not the spirits of the
newly dead to return and dwell with their mortal kindred; for they, not
knowing of the higher heavens, will teach falsely of Jehovih and His
everlasting kingdoms.

8\. And it came to pass that when one commandment was set aside the
others were also; and it followed that the spirits of the newly dead,
who were without knowledge of heaven, led mortals in their own way.

<span id="page_81a">p. 81a</span>

9\. For they dwelt together and slept together, and in dreams and
visions mortals judged themselves to be wise, not knowing they were
obsessed in sleep; and for the desires of the flesh they found
acquiescence in spirit, having no higher God or Lord.

10\. And as one spirit returned and fastened itself on a mortal, so did
another and another, till hundreds and thousands of spirits dwelt in one
corporeal body, oft driving hence the natural spirit I gave in the time
of conception; and these mortals knew it not; and they became void of
direct purpose because of the confusion of soul, and they were worthless
on the earth.

11\. Jehovih further said: Henceforth for a long season shall it be on
the earth that the spirits of the es'yans shall not be suffered to
return and dwell with mortals. But the earth shall be encompassed on all
sides with walls of emun, and with ashars to bear away the spirits of
the dead in the hour of death.

12\. But there shall come a time when mortals are capable of
comprehending these matters, in which time their kindred spirits shall
return at intervals from their holy labors in heaven, and see them and
talk with them face to face.
