### Chapter II

1\. IN the Ariniisca of Portan of the etherean worlds and division of
Hoit and Izaracha, flew the call of the Gods for volunteers, nor which a
more welcome sound is not heard in high heaven to do Jehovih's will. And
with the voice and call there rose up hosts from every quarter, and from
every sub-division, till the complement stood ready for the great work.
And yet so vast were the fields and arcs of Izaracha that the hundred
millions chosen were as but a fraction compared to those left uncalled.

2\. Coming near the throne of Sue in Aoit, the hundred millions formed
in squares and stars, and the chosen God took his place to the head and
front, looking to the low horizon, where rose the red star, the sick
earth.

3\. And now the builders who had measured the elements lying in the
route toward the earth, formed their crescent ship of fire, and equipped
it; and, with mantles and curtains and banners, created it a vessel of
beauty and ornament as well as service.

4\. Hardly was the ship completed when Jehovih's light encompassed it
about on all sides, so that that which was beautiful before was now
illuminated and sparkling and bright as a sun, and rich in golden
colors; for of such kind was the ethe of the heavens hereabout created.

5\. When Sue entered the ship, the voice of Jehovih came, saying:
Another cycle came and is gone on the earth and her heaven, but still
they fall to barrenness ere the succeeding dawn. Go now, O Sue, My Son,
and a wider range give to the tetracts of both angels and mortals. Give
a greater scope to tyrants, kings and queens on earth, and greater to
the self-Gods and self-Lords in hada, and more responsibility.

6\. Then all hands entered the etherean <span id="page_99a">p.
99a</span> ship, singing and rejoicing, observed by countless millions
come to wish them a haven of joy on their six years' visit to the
corporeal earth.

7\. Sue said: In Thy name, O Jehovih, and by virtue of Thy power in me
vested, my hosts shall forth at my command. Cut loose, ye Gods, and
thou, O ship, of heaven born, to the red star, the earth, begone! And
Sue stretched forth his hands and waved them, and lo, the mighty ship of
heaven turned on its axis, cutting loose from the high firmament. And it
turned, with its great curtains and banners sailing gracefully and
swiftly through the blue ether.

8\. The music of her es'enaurs swelled and rolled along on the spheres
of many worlds unseen to mortals, where dwell countless millions of
spectators viewing the marvelous speed and power and brilliant colors of
the great ship. Faster and Faster she sped on, till nearing Chinvat,
which now cut sharp in the fields and forests of Izaracha, over which
was potent the name of Sue, the companion God and chiefest friend of
Aph, Orian Chief, Son of Jehovih.

9\. When the ship came to the bridge and halted, to take in the plan of
the whirling earth, Sue said: A light! A light! Ye Gods! And at once, as
high as the moon and bright as the son, the illumined ship stood, to
overawe the self-Gods and warrior kings and murderers of the earth-born,
whose plentiful souls in chaos polluted heaven.

10\. For three days and nights Sue held his star-ship to the wonderful
task of mastering by the marvelous scene. And then slowly he entered the
vortex of the earth, but held his course, nor with the earth and her
heaven; for he desired that both corporeans and atmosphereans should
witness the coming power. So slowly he came, but fifty thousand miles a
day, that when the ship neared the disorganized Hored, the self-Gods and
self-Lords fled and left their well-supplied kingdoms desolate, and down
to the earth rushed in thousands, and with their hosts in millions, to
hide or safely stow themselves from Agni's just hate.

11\. But the true God and Lords stood firm in their depleted kingdoms,
fearing naught, but in faith that this etherean ship was Jehovih's
answer to their long cry for help from the heavenly spheres. And by
their pillars of fire still standing, great Sue knew where to land in
the lower heaven for safe anchorage. So to Hored he came, slowly, and
toward the throne of God. And when he neared the place, his <span
id="page_100a">p. 100a</span> es'enaurs chanted and the trumpeters
played; the sound of which music came to the ears of God and his hosts,
and they were the hymns of more than a thousand years ago.

12\. And God and his hosts sent up rockets and displayed the three
primary colors, the sign of Jehovih's name; and God's es'enaurs joined
in chanting with the hosts above. Presently the ship of fire was at the
place of landing, and Sue, Jehovih's Son, cast out a ladder and
descended, with his hosts, the hundred million angels, led by Gussitivi,
marshalless of the throne of Sue, in Izaracha.

13\. Sue said: Hail, O God of heaven and earth! In Jehovih's name, I am
come in power and wisdom. And God answered: Glory be to Thee, O Jehovih,
that Thy Son hath come so far to bless Thy bewildered kingdom! Then they
saluted with the signs of the sixth resurrection, whereupon God said:

14\. In the name of the Great Spirit, come thou and honor my throne. So
Sue went forward, and they greeted by shaking hands; and Sue ascended
and sat on the throne, saying: Keep thy place, O God, for I am not come
to displace thee or thy hosts of Jehovih, but to build up for His glory.
Be seated, therefore, for I feel the light of the Father descending on
my head.

15\. Presently the All Light enveloped Sue, and the Father's voice spake
through him, saying: Hear the words of thy Creator, My son, and rejoice
because I have not forgotten thee and thy people. Behold, this is the
hour of thy redemption from the trials of tetracts, which are run abroad
in My dominions.

16\. Was it not worse than this in the olden time? and I came with my
hosts and delivered them. I created man in darkness and gave to him no
judgment, that the creation of his own thoughts might be for his own
glory, forever. But instead of beautifying his thoughts, he hearkeneth
to tetracts and clotheth himself in clouds. The heaven I build for him
he diggeth to pieces, and then buildeth his own, but only to be
displeased and turbulent. Neither will he content himself with providing
with his own hands, but searchest out My most dutiful sons and
daughters, making slaves of them for his own exaltation.

17\. Behold, I have aforetime sent My sons and daughters to search out
these traitors and self-Gods, declaring unto them that only by forsaking
evil and practising righteousness could they attain to My exalted
kingdoms. Their evil places have I cast down, and rebuilt <span
id="page_101a">p. 101a</span> in honor and glory, that their own
judgment might determine that virtue and good works are the sure
foundation for happiness that will endure forever. But when I have
raised them up in one cycle and made the lower heaven a paradise, alas,
My ethereans have but gone away for a little while when the tetracts
take root, and grow, and turn all things upside down.

18\. But now will I build them up in a new way. Yea, I will appropriate
the evil of their inventions to their own good in a way they dream not
of. The false Gods and false Lords shall be arrested and brought before
this judgment seat, and I will judge them by their own behavior and
desires; neither will I torment them nor abridge their happiness. Send,
therefore, My Son, thy marshals into the hidden places of these Gods and
Lords, and say to them: Thus saith the hosts of heaven: Come, My Son,
and inherit a kingdom in hada, in thine own way, for lo, there is room
for all; but that thou art not left behind, come quickly to Hored.

19\. And they will come, hoping to embellish themselves in the old
manner. But My Light shall come in due time in Mine Own way.

20\. The voice ceased, but Sue spake of his own account, saying: What
Jehovih hath ordered, do ye. So marshals and priests were sent in all
directions in atmospherea to gather in the false Gods and false Lords
who had deserted their dominions in fear of the light of Sue's etherean
ship. And after many days the false ones were brought to Hored; and
there were of them seven thousand Lords and Gods.

21\. Now when they were before Sue, Jehovih's Son, and arranged so that
all could hear and see, even the whole Council beside, the Light
gathered around about the throne, and Sue addressed them, saying:

22\. Hear me, O men and women! I have sent for you, and ye are here. In
this I am pleased. Know, then, that what I speak shall be in love and
tenderness. Ye have deserted Jehovih's kingdoms, and it must be because
it pleased you better than to remain. Is this not true? And ye also
deserted your own false kingdoms?

23\. For a little while they consulted together, and then answered,
saying: Nay, it pleased us not to desert our own kingdoms; but we were
afraid.

24\. Sue said: Who think ye I am? They answered: A God from some far-off
world, but where it lieth we know not. We desire to know who thou art?

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

25\. Sue said: I am but a man; fear me not. But since ye feared, and so
deserted your kingdoms, does it not prove that ye are not the All
Highest? And do ye not perceive that, because ye had no All Highest, ye
were divided and inharmonious?

26\. Hear, then, that which I say, and consider my words: I want not
your kingdoms nor anything ye have; but, that harmony may reign in
heaven, I will give every one of you more than ye had, and add power
unto you also.

27\. Since ye behold I am come to Hored, the throne of the ancients,
perceive ye not that whosoever accordeth with me is of my power also?
Take, then, your kingdoms and be Gods and Goddesses, as ye assumed
before, and I will anoint ye, and make ye as part and parcel of one
united whole. Again they counseled together, and then answered:

28\. Why shall we take our kingdoms? Our slaves have deserted us; our
kingdoms are pillaged of all their value. Yea, our slaves have become
wandering spirits, and are returned to the earth and are making their
habitations with mortals. So that the people of earth are aroused
because of miracles and wonders occurring on earth.

29\. Sue said: What can ye say to these wandering spirits that will
induce them to come up away from mortals? To which they answered: If we
promise them provender and clothes and plenty of rest, they will come;
but when we put them to labor, they will run away, having tasted of
liberty.

30\. Sue said: How, then, made ye slaves of them in the first place? To
which they answered: We took them in the day their mortal bodies died,
and they never saw nor knew any other place in heaven; so we
appropriated them to our service dutifully.

31\. Sue said: Know, then, this is my conclusion: First that ye shall
all be made as sub-Gods to one confederacy, and your kingdoms shall be
fair to look upon, and well supplied with all things needful.

32\. Behold, there are on earth, with the barbarians, hosts of familiars
and fetals; whoever, then, of you will go down to the earth and bring
them away to Hored shall have them for his slaves; and, whoever bringeth
the greatest number, will I award the greatest kingdom. And if it be
that ye can find emissaries to work for you in bringing fetals and
familiars away from the barbarians, then shall such labor be accounted
to your credit. And ye shall station around about in the corporeal
cities certain angels, whose labor shall be to receive newborn spirits
on birth-blankets and bring them to your kingdoms also, for they shall
be your slaves.

33\. After that manner spake Sue; and the false Gods and Goddesses were
highly pleased, and they divided themselves into certain districts over
mortals and for the lower heaven, and were at once sent off to labor in
their own way, and they were named sub-Gods.

34\. Sue said: These sub-Gods have much weight with the barbarians,
because they advise them in war. But, behold, it shall come to pass when
the sub-Gods have robbed the barbarians of their familiar spirits, the
I'hin priests will have a greater weight with them.

35\. And the sub-Gods will desire to find favor in my sight, and so,
teach their slaves, the which will cause them to emancipate themselves
in time to come.
