### Chapter XIII

1\. SWIFT messengers coursing the heavens, from far-off etherean worlds,
bound for destinations remote, passed over the regions of Hored; and the
high-raised travelers felt the discordant plots of satan's Lord God and
his hosts, thus bent to overthrow the Great Spirit's happy world. And so
they sent word of it to Cpenta-armij, through whose fields the great
serpent moved along. And her Most High Council, one with the Creator,
cast about to know the cause and treatment of the dastardly outrage.

2\. Then spake Jehovih to His Daughter, Chieftainess, saying: The Lord
God was duly honored in My name, and swore before Me to serve
faithfully, forever, by his highest light. Hold thou him to his purpose,
and bind him in the world he hath assumed to rule for his own glory. And
to his fellow-God, conspirators against Me, Who brought them into being,
give thou them full sway to destroy My worshippers. Let them raise the
name of their God, and bait mortal kings and queens to glut themselves
in the havoc of My chosen, the Faithists.

3\. The earth neareth her greatest corporeal growth, and these
self-assuming Gods shall build monuments through their mortal
emissaries, in the greatest divisions of the earth: Temples, and
pyramids, and oracle-palaces, which shall stand thousands of years as
testimonies of the audacity of Gods and Saviors. To honor whom, the Lord
God hath sworn to make angels and men suppliant slaves in heaven and
earth.

4\. For I will use the corporeal temples and pyramids they shall build
on the earth at the expense of My chosen, as testimony, in coming ages,
of the oppression in the hadan-heavenly kingdoms of these self-Gods.
Till which time I cannot teach mortals of the vanity of the lower
heavens, save in <span id="page_384">p. 384</span> the deserted ruins of
their moldering monuments.

5\. For in kosmon, mortals shall know that even as the earth hath been a
place of foolish sacrifice to persons born of woman, so were My heavens
debauched in that day by similar oppression and cruelty.

6\. Let him who is falsely crowned Osiris, build in the Osirian field,
and him who is proclaimed De'yus, build in the hadan field, for the time
shall come when these testimonies shall be required in the sum of earth
and heaven.

7\. For I will show them that without an All Highest Person there is no
resurrection for angels or men. Of which they that are slaughtered, ten
thousand millions, and bound by the Lord God, shall swear, in kosmon,
the fall of all things save Me.

8\. Down to the lower heavens, to God in Craoshivi, sent Cpenta-armij
swift messengers, with the words of Jehovih, comforting to God and his
hosts, as to the wide plans on which the Father lieth the destinies of
worlds. And God received them, and now comprehended why, alas, his Diva
came not, nor answered his call but by resigning.

9\. But God, the true ruler of heaven and earth, now saw how the
prosperity of the indulged heaven had made bad men out of most holy
Gods, even as prosperity on the earth closeth up man's eyes against his
Creator, making him an egotist in self, and vociferous as to Jehovih's
shortcomings, according to man's views. And God remembered how he had
prayed for the continuation of the light in heaven, which Jehovih
granted him; and he repented now, saying:

10\. O Jehovih, why said I not: Thy will be done; let darkness come! Had
I not seen on the earth how night must follow day, and winter after
summer; that I must need pray for endless light in a heaven where Thy
sons and daughters are as yet but babes in the time and course of
worlds? Mine own judgment should have shown me that spells of darkness
should follow seasons of light in Thy lower heavens. For, then, had
these half-tried Lords and Gods stopped to consider ere they rushed into
so mad a scheme.

11\. God called together the Holy Council in Craoshivi, and told them of
the words of the Creator, through His High-Raised Daughter. Then the
Council spake, all who chose, and the thirty millions listened. And,
meanwhile, messengers fresh from Hored, the seat of rebellion, came in,
bringing full news to Craoshivi of the proceedings of the Lord God,
alias, De'yus, and his self-Gods and Goddesses.

12\. When the full particulars had been related, and the Council had
spoken upon it, then the light of Jehovih came upon God, and God said:

13\. In the name of our Father, I will speak to these Gods and Lords and
acquaint them with Jehovih's words. Yea, I will entreat them to return
even as they were.

14\. Then God, overwhelmed by the terrible adversity of the heavens
entrusted to his keeping, as in a small degree the captain of a
merchant's ship, far out at sea, meeting with a mishap of broken masts,
stript to the bulk, and rudder gone, powerless to save, feeleth the
burning shame of incompetence before mariners, so God, before the
High-Raised Chiefs of the etherean worlds, must helplessly view his
shattered kingdoms.

15\. With great sorrow God sent word to De'yus and his Gods, of
Jehovih's warning; and he plead for them to return, as a father pleadeth
to a wayward son. Off went the messengers swiftly; and God, even though
long schooled to adverse trials and suspensions, burned with impatience
for his messengers to return, hoping that his sweet pleadings might yet
reverse the scenes.

16\. Then came back the messengers, empty handed! Not one of the truant
Gods had deigned to answer him. And God wept, scarce believing his
messengers, that so great an insult could be heaped upon him, who had
done nothing whereof any one could complain. Then Jehovih came and spake
to God, saying: Weep not, My Son! He who followeth his highest light
from day to day, great is his glory; and in whatsoever he loseth he
shall regain a thousand-fold. Behold, I will bring love to thee that
thou knowest not of: Remember thou, as this season is upon the earth and
her heavens, even so do I send a season like unto it upon all My worlds.
