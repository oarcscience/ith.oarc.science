### Chapter III

1\. O ye angels, of hada of the red star; and thou, O God, and ye Lords,
upraised and mighty, with hosts, countless, and quick answering the
thoughts of mortals, hear the words of Aph, Son of Jehovih:

2\. When I was in the Orian arc of Noe, and the red star passed the
Utswowldayark, in the etherean group of Vorh, the voice of Jehovih came
to me, saying: Go thou, My Son, deliver the earth. Take with thee all
whom I may send.

3\. And I examined the records of the stars of heaven, and of the earth;
and the accounts of Jehovih's harvests, and I perceived the bondage and
labor of the red star were of the seventh magnitude in the advance of
habitable worlds.

4\. When His voice called the legions in high heaven, from every side,
and below and above the earth, there moved myriads of shapely stars,
which were ships of fire, coursing the firmament, whereon rode the Gods
and Goddesses called by Jehovih to the labor of earth and hada.

5\. Closing in on every side they came, and nearer and more compact, and
brighter, with sparkling pillars of fire, and down-swaying curtains of
light, till all the space around about the earth was hedged in with this
army of Jehovih's etherean ships of fire.

6\. Again I heard the Father's voice, saying: O Aph, My Son, My holy
one, hearken to the voice of Jehovih, Creator of Gods and Goddesses:

7\. Behold, I sent My Son, Neph, to the red star, with wisdom and power.
Long hath he been gone; long struggling with the black darkness of men
and angels.

8\. As a valiant soldier rusheth into the heaviest part of battle, and
forgetteth himself in desperate contest, but ceaseth not to struggle on
against all odds, even so for three thousand years hath My God, Neph,
hoped to save the whole limbs of the earth (the continents).

9\. From My holy place have I watched the battle for everlasting life;
but the too prolific earth contributeth more to the corporeal than to
the spiritual man. And I bring My legions to the rescue of My valiant
<span id="page_75a">p. 75a</span> Son, Neph. Send thou to him, O Aph, My
Son. Proclaim to him and his Lords, and to his ethereans, My just
decrees. Aph said:

10\. And I sent swift messengers down to hada, informing Neph, Son of
Jehovih, of the march and presence of Gods, and of the decree of the
Father; and I added thereunto, saying: O Neph, Son of Jehovih, come
hither, bringing thy hosts with thee.

11\. Presently Neph answered me in Jehovih's name, saying: O Aph, Son of
Jehovih, I come! My prayers are answered. All praise to the All Highest!

12\. Then we saw, making ready in hada, preparatory to ascending, the
ship of Neph and his faithful hosts; and that which was seen from my
place was also seen by the myriads of Jehovih's vessels surrounding the
earth. And my place became as a central throne to which the hosts now
made speed, swift and orderly.

13\. And in the time they came, also rose up the ship of Neph from hada.
Meanwhile, my ship rested on the borders of Chinvat, in the School of
Hein, and from the moon seven agus. <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md)

14\. Again the voice of Jehovih came to me, saying: My Son, make fast
thy ship, for thy place shall be the head of the army of My hosts. And
let thy consorts extend in a line from thy place down to the earth, for
this shall be the delivery of them whom I shall cut off.

15\. So I made fast, and my messengers hastened to the concentrating
forces of heaven, informing the etherean groups on Jehovih's ships of
His commandments. And now came Neph; his ship rose up, filled with his
long-laboring hosts. And I greeted him and said unto him: By the power
and wisdom of Jehovih, the continent of Whaga is to be cut loose and
submerged, and her heavens carried away. Return thou to the earth and
bring all the spirits of darkness from all the divisions of earth and
heaven to Whaga, that I may carry them away. Then Neph and his hosts
viewed the imposing scene and returned back to the earth.

16\. Quickly, now, the ships of fire formed in line, extending from my
place down to hada, where rested Neph and his Lords of the earth, whose
hosts extended to all the divisions of land and water, embracing the
various heavenly kingdoms previously built by the Lords.

17\. And in the line of the etherean ships were stationed the plateaux
of rank; and the hosts of Gods and Goddesses took their places according
to <span id="page_76a">p. 76a</span> the rank of wisdom, power and love
manifested in the etherean departments whence they came, with the two
Orian Chiefs at either extremity.

18\. And I divided the line into sections, each with two hundred and
fifty ships, and there were one thousand sections. And every ship was
contracted ten thousand fold, which was the force required to break the
crust of the earth and sink a continent.

19\. Along the line I stationed sentinels and talemen, and messengers,
without number, so that Jehovih's voice and His sons' voices could
traverse in a moment of time to every part. And after that I formed the
tube of transit, which extended in front of the ships, and from the
earth to beyond Chinvat; and I filled it with the earth's atmosphere to
the extreme, whither it joined Io'sank, whither I determined to deliver
the drujas and fetals of such as were to perish in the ocean of the
earth.

20\. For every ten sections I appointed one hundred marshals and one
God, and for every ten Gods one Chief in Emuts; according to their rank
in the heavens whence they came, so appointed I them. These, then, are

31\. So Fiatisi outranked all other Gods and Goddesses, and was special
guest of honor to Aph, Chief over all the rest.

32\. And the star of Fiatisi's etherean ship was stationed near the
earth, that she might the better behold the deliverance of the spirits
that were to be freed by the submersion of the land of Whaga; and of
these spirits there were upward of twenty-four billion four hundred
millions, of whom more than three billion were fetals and familiars and
spirits in chaos.
