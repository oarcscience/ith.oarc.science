### Chapter XXXII

1\. TE-IN, whose heavenly kingdom contained three thousand million
angels, being informed when Osiris and Sudga were gone to Hored, satan
said to him: Now is thy time, call thy Council together; proclaim
thyself God of heaven and earth, mighty in all regions, the Central
Kingdom of the Eternal Heavens! Choose from amongst thy Council the
highest grades, and make them Lords under thee. After which thou shalt
renew the battles in Jaffeth, on the earth.

2\. Te-in said: Why on the earth? Satan said: Behold, Jaffeth must be
subdued to one nation of people, and this shall be thy footstool, and
thy heavenly kingdom's head-quarters. After which thy Lords shall
proceed to the lands of Parsi'e and Arabin'ya, and inspire the
inhabitants thereof to another central kingdom, and when mortals are
thus subdued to limited numbers, thou shalt have but few to deal with in
order to make thyself God of the whole earth.

3\. Te-in said: Thou art wiser than all Gods. Behold, my way is clear.

4\. So on the day of De'yus' meeting with Osiris and Sudga, even the
same day, Te-in severed the bonds betwixt his heavenly kingdom and all
others, and he chose twelve of his highest grade in the Holy Council,
and made them Lords of the earth; but he allotted no portion of the
earth to any one alone. He said:

5\. I will not give them kingdoms; this is the strongest way; to keep
every thing in one's own hands.

6\. Te-in, then, through his Lords, whom he sent down to the earth, made
Kan Kwan mortal king of Jaffeth, with the title, KING OF THE WORLD, AND
SUN, AND MOON, AND STARS! And the Lords caused Kan Kwan to build an
oke'spe, where he could receive the commandments of Te-in, the holiest,
all highest ruler of heaven, as to what he should do in order to subdue
the earth unto himself.

7\. Te-in said: And, my Gods, say ye to Kan Kwan when the earth is
subdued unto himself: Behold, I will also come down and dwell in the
temples he buildeth for my Lords. And when the king goeth forth and
subdueth a place unto himself, he shall immediately build a worshipful
temple and dedicate it to me and my Lords, whose names ye shall give
alike and like in all places. For I will not confuse mortals with a
multiplicity of heavenly Lords. And the king shall show unto the people
that there is but one High Ruler in heaven, whether he be called Ho-Joss
or Joss, or Po-tein, or Te-in, and that I am the Person. But in no case
shall the king suffer the worshippers of the Great Spirit to remain
alive upon the earth.

8\. Te-in said: My Lords, take with you, each, one million angels,
strong and cunning in war; twelve millions are sufficient, for ye shall
not scatter them about, but keep close in the neighborhood of war and of
the king. As when a fire burneth, beginning from a spark and spreading
outward till a city is consumed, so be ye concentrated and potent. This
is the whole art of power. And whilst mortals sleep, your angels shall
come upon them and give them dreams and visions of glorious success,
make them see themselves in the heat of battle, rushing through the jaws
of death unscathed, whilst their manly arms slay about them on every
side their enemies by the score in flowing blood. For when these mortals
awake and remember their dreams, they will be well whetted up for the
valorous work. But as to those that are to be conquered, let your angels
go to them whilst they sleep, and give them dreams and visions of horrid
deaths; make them see the heat of battle and themselves overpowered on
every hand, and, pierced with sword and spear, they fall, dying in great
agony. For when such mortals wake up and remember their dreams, they are
half conquered already.

9\. Te-in said: My Lords, ye shall inspire the king to be merciful and
gentle; and when his soldiers come to a place to subdue it, they shall
send truce-men before them, inquiring: Who, say ye, shall be the ruler?
And if the people answer: We are Kan Kwan's slaves, they shall not be
slain.

10\. Te-in said: My Lords, amongst mortals, what is righteousness? Now
one Lord said: Rites and ceremonies. Another said: To worship thee, O
Te-in. Another said: To follow the doctrines of the ancients. Another
said: To purify one's self. Another said: To do good with all one's
might. Another said: To practice truth. Another said: To harm no man.

11\. Te-in said: Not one of you knoweth righteousness. Behold how you
stand: The doctrines of the ancients were their own, and they are as
dead. <span id="page_417">p. 417</span> To put on a dead man's clothes,
will they make the wearer like the dead was?

12\. Rites and ceremonies are what show-men train their horses with, to
run or leap, or lie down, to please their masters.

13\. To purify one's self! What is that? A mortal man's body cannot be
purified, for it is rotten at best.

14\. To do good with all one's might! Who knoweth the meaning of that?
To cut off a crushed foot to save a man's life: Give him pain in the
cutting, even whilst he is suffering. Then it is well that some men's
heads be cut off for their own good. Yea, even nations extirpated. Let
him that doeth, then, do with all his might. See ye not that in this,
that before one attempteth to do good, he is his own judge, judging by
his own judgment?

15\. To practice truth! What is that? The Jehovihians say: Jehovih is
All Truth. But Jehovih is nothing, scattered as the wind. Then truth is
nothing. Who hath found a man but saith: To see as I see, is to see the
truth; to see as thou seest, is to see falsely? A man told lies
knowngly, and practiced them, and he was all truth to himself, for he
was a liar. Therefore, he practiced truth.

16\. To worship me is unrighteousness instead of righteousness. To
worship Joss is unrighteousness; to worship the nondescript Jehovih, is
unrighteousness, and to worship Po is unrighteousness also. Behold this
matter: The large trees in the forest were smothering out the small
ones; and the small ones said: We praise you, giant oaks, for the many
blessings we have received; be merciful unto us! The large trees laughed
at them, and they died. Is this not Jehovih? Is this not the Gods? For
all mortals, at best, are but as unhatched eggs; and when they are dead,
their souls are as hatched chickens, for the Gods to play with, and to
use in their own way.

17\. Te-in said: Teach ye this to mortals; and tell them, moreover, to
choose what God they will; and if it be me, then I will labor for them;
if it be not me, then am I against them. This, then, is righteousness:
Reciprocity betwixt Gods and mortals; reciprocity betwixt mortals
themselves; to war for opinion's sake in order to develop in
steadfastness; to help the helpless, to feed and clothe the stranger,
and to worship the father and mother.
