### Chapter XX

OF THE CONFEDERACY OF THE HOLY GHOST, CALLED THE TRINITY.

1\. THE Lord said: The three heavenly kingdoms, Heractu, Eta-shong and
Hapsendi, of the Triunes, were independent, but allianced for offence
and defence against the evil Gods, Baal, Dagon, Shulleth, Ashtaroth and
others, whose angel subjects were kept in slavery, and for evil
purposes.

2\. Now, therefore, the Triunes jointly declared war, to the end that
peace might be secured in these heavens.

3\. Nevertheless, each of the Triunes had charge of his own heavens and
over such part of the earth as was covered by his heavens.

4\. For they had divided up and appropriated both, the earth and the
heavens, into three parts, one to each of them.

5\. Here followeth, then, the history of the wars of the Triunes:

6\. First, of Looeamong and the false Gods he overthrew:

7\. A triangular was was going on in hada and on earth betwixt the angel
armies of Baal, Dagon and Ashtaroth, in which ten thousand million
angels were engaged under them.

8\. Looeamong declared war against the whole of them, and impressed into
his service eight thousand million angel warriors.

9\. Ashtaroth, the most vengeful Goddess, had previously sent hundreds
of millions of her warring angels down to the apostate Jews, to inspire
them to wars and cruelties on one another, hoping, to exterminate them,
lest they become Baal's subjects. And yet other millions of warring
angels had she sent to the Parsi'e'an cities, and to the Eguptian
cities, Daskrath, Babylon and Gonassah and Tyre and Romaxain and to the
kings and queens of many other great cities, to inspire them to send
forth armies to destroy, not only the worshipers of Jehovih, but all
people that worshiped Baal, or Dagon, or any other God.

10\. Baal, on the other hand, had sent hundreds of millions of his
warring angels down to the earth, to Heleste and the west regions, and
to the Israelites as well, inspiring mortals to war against the east
kingdoms, especially Babylon and Daskrath, two mighty cities in the
dominions of the Goddess Ashtaroth.

11\. And the armies of mortals were moved forth by the armies of angels,
whom they saw not; war raged east and west and north and south.

<span id="page_681">p. 681</span>

12\. Looeamong, the Triune, said: I will spoil them both. I will send an
angel army of warriors down to the middle kingdoms, to the great tyrant,
Cyrus. I will possess the oracles and direct Cyrus to march against
Parsi'e. He shall make an alliance with the Argos'yans.

13\. Hatchesan and Karsoka shall be my countries. And the cities of
Hemia and Babylon and Nine'vah and Gassakad and Hannedan and Saluem
shall bow down no more to Baal and Ashtaroth, forever.

14\. Belus shall be mine, and the cities and temples of Hina and Maroth
and Hovan and Torres and Delfi; and the habitations of Phires and Somak
and Macedon and Thues, and the great oracle-houses of Myrsilus and
Myrsus and Gyges and Simon and Gamma and Fabiyan and Sulus and Craz'ya
and Wakadya and P'hrid and Gemnae and Ma'zan and R'hodae.

15\. By force will I possess them; yea, by force drive hence all other
angels and Gods. And my warrior angels shall possess these temples, so
that whoso cometh to consult the Gods shall receive mine own answers. I
will drive mortals to war in mine own way, and to whatever place I
determine to subdue or destroy.

16\. Equally menacing were the boasts of the Goddess Ashtaroth; she had
said: Whether I despoil heaven and earth, I care not. If I can not
possess them, I will destroy them, so that no God shall possess them.

17\. Into festering knots and hells will I cast tens of thousands of
millions of angels, in case I do not succeed in winning all.

18\. I will send millions of warring angels down to Xerxes, the
Parsi'e'an king, and to his kingdom, and they shall obsess every man,
woman and child to desperate madness against the Argos'yans and the
middle and west nations.

19\. I will lead Xerxes forth with the mightiest army that has ever been
on the earth. And they shall despoil all regions, whithersoever they
march.

20\. For I will make Xerxes and all the Parsi'e'ans believe, they are
doing these things for their own prosperity and glory, and for
despoiling their own enemies.

21\. And, after Xerxes hath despoiled and conquered all the earth
regions, Baal and all other Gods shall be driven away from the oracles
and temples. Xerxes shall issue a decree, abolishing all other Gods but
me, Ashtaroth.

22\. And, when I am thus well anchored on the earth, I will turn my
legions against this new upstart God, the Triune, Looeamong. And I will
cast him into a hell, from which he shall not escape forever.

23\. So, Ashtaroth concentrated her heavenly warriors into this great
and desperate work. For she had been maturing her plans, even before
Xerxes came to the throne of Parsi'e. And, since, in those days, the
kings and rich men in all those countries consulted the spirits, in
reference to all important undertakings, it was not a difficult feat for
Ashtaroth to obsess the millions of Parsi'e'ans to carry out her
project.

24\. Accordingly, Ashtaroth commanded her marshals to summon two
thousand million angel warriors, men and women, for the work in hand.
And when they came to Neabissa, a heavenly region to the north, over the
earth-mountains Afflo'yagga, she caused Mateus, her chief orator, to
prepare a speech in her behalf, and have it declaimed before the angel
warriors.

25\. Mateus, a one-time Lord to Osiris, nine hundred years previous, now
made the speech, and this that followeth is a synopsis, to wit:

26\. I, Goddess of all the heavens and of the whole earth. Behold, me,
Ashtaroth! The earth and the heavens are mine, saith Ashtaroth! I clove
the sun in twain; for it is mine. I clove the pieces again; for they
were mine. From these I made the stars and the moon. But the great earth
I made as my foot-stool; for it was mine, and ever shall be.

27\. I peopled it over with all the living; they were my creation. And
ye also are mine. I peopled the stars, and gave to the inhabitants
thereof great delights. And the earth and my heavens were places of
great delight. For I gave bountifully to all my children.

28\. But the inhabitants of the far-off stars quarreled because of an
evil God, Baal. And they cast him out. And he came here to despoil me
and my heavenly places. Witness ye my beloved. I could destroy him with
my little finger. But he is unworthy of your Goddess. To you I give the
glory to capture him, and cast him into hell, and torture him forever.

29\. But lest other evil Gods take possession of his earthly places,
they shall also be destroyed. Hear ye then the command of Ashtaroth,
which is, that ye shall go down to the earth, and obsess <span
id="page_682">p. 682</span> and inspire the Parsi'e'ans to march forth
and destroy all other people on the earth, beginning first with the
stronghold of Baal, in Argos, where he hath many sub-Gods under him,
where the Argos'yans, not knowing him, call him, Zeus.

30\. And to whoso proveth valorous amongst my angel warriors, will I
give great promotion and glory, and thousands and millions of slaves.
For when Baal is overcome and cast into hell, ye shall take his angel
slaves, and possess them yourselves, according to your valorous deeds.

31\. Ashtaroth then officered her angel hosts, and sent them down to the
earth, and they were distributed by the captains and generals around
about Parsi'e. Being directed to preside in the presence of mortals by
day, inspiring them to war against Argos, and to be with them at night,
and talk to them spiritually in dreams and visions.

32\. And it came to pass, that Xerxes and the people, the Parsi'e'ans,
were moved to go forth and destroy the Argos'yans. And king Xerxes took
two and a half million soldiers with him for his army. And so great was
the inspiration and obsession of Ashtaroth's angels, that they caused
another two and a half million of Parsi'e'ans to go with Xerxes'
soldiers. So that Xerxes' whole army was five millions of souls, which
was the largest army on earth, that ever had been, or ever shall be.
