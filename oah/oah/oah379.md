God said: These are the nine entities; or, according to the ancients,
Jehovih and His eight children, His Sons and Daughters. And these are
the same, which in all ages, poets and philosophers have made to speak
as, THE FAMILY OF THE UNIVERSE. Through them I speak. Jehovih is the
Light, that is, Knowledge. The manifestation of Knowledge in man is
Jehovih. The growth of wisdom in man, as the earth groweth older, is the
tree of light.
