### Chapter VII

GOD SHOWETH THE DIFFERENCE BETWIXT THE RELIGION OF THE OLDEN TIME AND
THAT OF THE PRESENT.

1\. TO the All One, Jehovih, now as in the olden time, and for all time
to come, all honor and glory, worlds beyond number.

2\. The Highest Ideal, the Nearest Perfect the mind can conceive of--let
such be thy Jehovih, even as in the olden time, which is the Ever
Present thou shalt set thy heart and mind and soul upon to love and
glorify above all things, forever and ever.

3\. The All Highest in thy neighbor which he manifesteth--that perceive
and discourse upon--all else in him, see not nor mention.

4\. The All Highest subject--that discourse upon--all else pass by.

5\. The first lowest thoughts pertain to eating and drinking; and on
these the man of darkness delighteth to discourse.

6\. The second lowest thoughts pertain to sexual matters; and on these
the man of darkness delighteth to discourse.

7\. The third lowest thoughts pertain to man's selfishness, as bodily
comforts and luxuries, as ease and riches, as to what he hopes and
desires for himself; and on these the man of darkness delighteth to
discourse.

8\. The fourth lowest thoughts pertain to criticising others, as to
doctrine, religion, philosophy, behavior, and so on, forever pulling all
things to pieces; and the man of darkness delighteth in such discourse.

9\. To abandon such discourse, and to discourse on the highest subjects,
in preference, such as teaching, imparting knowledge, suggesting
remedies for the unfortunate and unlearned, for improving in excellence
the homes of others, the agriculture, mechanics and such like; the man
of light delighteth to apply himself to these, both in word and
practice, forever building up.

10\. Consider then what thy mind shall go in search of, that it may
pursue the highest. This is serving the All Highest, instead of
darkness.

11\. Now all of these things were taught in the religion of the olden
time, and were given to man by thy God to raise man up toward my
heavenly kingdom.

12\. Nevertheless this religion pertained to man's own entity, a
religion that was to be answered either in reward or punishment upon
himself personally. His own salvation being the subject paramount to all
other considerations.

13\. And even where they founded brotherhoods, as the brotherhood of
Brahma; brotherhood of Buddha, and brotherhood of Jesus, they were
nevertheless but selfish brotherhoods, whose aim was the salvation of
each one's own self.

14\. Neither was it possible in the olden time to give man any other
<span id="page_840">p. 840</span> religion, it being necessary to appeal
to his own advantages to make him heed thy God.

15\. But now, behold, O man, I come to give a great religion, yet not to
set aside the old; I come to such as do fulfill the old, and to give
them the religion of Gods themselves!

16\. Saying unto them: Go save others, and no longer concern yourselves
about yourselves.

17\. Go ye and provide a place of second resurrection on earth, where
the people shall put away all low things and practice the all highest.

18\. And call ye out unto the Uzians to come and inherit the place with
you.

19\. Nevertheless whosoever is only concerned as to the salvation of his
own soul is not yet ready for the religion I give unto you.

20\. Mine shall not concern themselves as to their own self's salvation;
for having faith in Jehovih, that if they raise others up, with their
own wisdom and strength, they are already saved, and without fear.

21\. Compare then my second resurrection in heaven with that which thou
wouldst found on earth for the glory and honor of thy Creator.

22\. How chooseth thy God his initiates? Hath he censors?--saying to all
who come--hold, be ye examined and tried, to prove ye are worthy the
second resurrection?

23\. Nay, verily, for this would imply inquisition--a court of darkness.

24\. Now, behold, O man, after the second resurrection was established
in heaven, I called out unto all the heavens of the earth, saying: Come,
all ye of the first resurrection, also, let my guardians go down to
mortals and proclaim unto all people--the kingdom of God is open to all
who choose to come.

25\. Now some, who were not strong in faith in Jehovih said: Will we not
be overrun with angels of darkness?

26\. But thy God answered them, saying: That is not our matter; ours is
to serve Jehovih by working for all whom He inspireth to come unto us.
Because any one desireth to come--that is sufficient testimony that the
light of Jehovih is upon him.

27\. Others said: What of the indolent and the shiftless? Will they not
overrun us and thus set aside the good we aim at?

28\. And thy God answered them, saying: When ye practice the all
highest, behold, the others will depart away from you.

29\. Then others questioned, saying: Suppose they who come shall
practice darkness--such as slander, or tattling--what then shall be
done?

30\. And thy God answered them, saying: Answer them not, lest ye also
practice darkness.

31\. Again they questioned, saying: Suppose they are good, but indolent?
Suppose they say: Let us rest and sleep, Jehovih will provide for His
chosen--what sayest thou of them?

32\. And thy God answered, saying: Censure them not, for they are weak
or diseased. Let your example heal them. Is it not in the covenant to do
good with all of one's wisdom and strength? Because they do little, the
matter is betwixt them and Jehovih?

33\. Lastly, O man, how can they, who live the all highest, cast the
first stone at their neighbor?

34\. For the act itself would be the committing of darkness.

35\. Nevertheless, whoso hath strength and yet will not support
himself--teach thou one such man to change his attributes, and thou
shalt be honored amongst Gods.

36\. Thy glory is to fulfill the all highest thyself. When all who can,
will do this, thereon rest thy faith that the quickening power and
wisdom of Jehovih will sustain His kingdom through His holy angels.
