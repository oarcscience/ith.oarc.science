### Chapter XII

1\. ES, the chief nurse, had said: I must tell you of the wonderful
Light of Jehovih, that always cometh to us in time of emergency. Even at
the moment despair is about to reach us, lo, His Light provideth unto
us.

2\. I had undertaken to nurse, with bottles, ever so many babes, more
than was possible for one woman to attend, taking one at a time on my
lap, but I could not get round in time. So, also, I had had observation
that babes should be held in somebody's arms, and that when they cried
they should be taken up, held upright, and diverted by walking with them
or by tossing them.

3\. To do these things for many babes was not possible for one nurse;
so, after I had prayed for strength and light as to what was best to be
done, the Voice came to me, plainly, as if I had read it in a book,
saying:

4\. My Daughter, why thwartest thou the way of My creations? Had I
designed My little ones to be upright, I should have provided a way for
them.

5\. Thou shalt permit them to lie down, and to roll about. Neither shalt
thou encumber them with pillows and cushions. Permit them to exercise
themselves by crawling in their own way.

6\. And when the proper time cometh for them to stand upright, and to
jump, behold, I will be with them.

7\. Es said: Now, thereupon, I began a new system. I not only searched
to know myself, but to develop these little ones. And when I took away
the pillows and cushions, giving them double blankets to lie on, and
opportunity to exercise by rolling about, behold, they grew in strength
daily, and not only soon ceased to cry, but began to sing songs (to me
they were songs) and to laugh and amuse themselves with their hands and
toes and whatever they got hold of.

8\. From this little light, of applying the law of development unto
babes, I applied myself to make them understand that they should divert
themselves, without depending on their nurses. For many of the orphans
we had received were little tyrants, having been spoiled by former
nurses, and they screamed constantly, to make some one carry them about
and divert them.

9\. Now, therefore, I perceived that Jehovih required more of me than
merely to feed and clean these little ones; the minds of the spoiled
ones had to be remodeled; they should be made to comprehend that no one
was slave unto them; and, moreover, that they themselves should
cultivate patience, gentleness and love, as better attributes than
fretfulness and authority.

10\. For, let no one be surprised, even babes can be spoiled to think
themselves an authority, with power to command obedience from adults.
And they discover, at an early age, that to give vent to peevishness and
passion bringeth the nurse to do them service.

11\. And I saw, too, that some, even such as could merely hold up their
heads, became jealous, to be the first fed, or the first washed, and
answered my negligence with fearful screams.

12\. Now, it came to pass, when I ceased taking them up to feed them,
and did away with the pillow-props, and laid them all down alike, and
gave them food at the same time (according to their groups), I had not
only provided unto them better corporeal development, but better
spiritual development.

13\. Such as had been peevish and jealous ceased their former habits,
and began to look with respect to the other babes, rolling beside them.

14\. Not many months passed by till they began to be interested in one
another, examining their feet and hands, and evidently trying to
comprehend who they were, and whence they came. And they also saw in one
another a representation of themselves, appreciating a fellowship that
was surpassingly beautiful.
