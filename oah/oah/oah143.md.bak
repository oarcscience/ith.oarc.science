### Chapter VIII

1\. THIS, then, is the manner of the House of Mouru: Fragapatti would
announce the subject; then, rank and rank, according to exaltation, the
representatives of hundreds and of thousands would speak on the <span
id="page_193a">p. 193a</span> subject. When all had spoken that desired
to, or whom Fragapatti asked, then Fragapatti would pronounce in the
name of Jehovih. And these were the decrees. For example:

2\. Fragapatti said: What shall be the divisions of the earth, and who
the Lords thereof? And when the House had expressed, then Fragapatti
said: In the name of Jehovih, these shall be the divisions of the earth,
to wit: Jaffeth on the east and north, by the sea and to the ice
regions, and on the west to the mountains of Oh'e'loo, which shall be
called the first division.

3\. To the east and south, water and water, and to the west, the
highlands of E'zar; and its name shall be Shem.

4\. The south land shall henceforth be called Arabin'ya, encompassed by
the sea. And north of this, the first country of the brown red race
shall be called Heleste, bordering on Shem and Jaffeth on the east, and
extending half way to the sea on the west.

5\. Uropa shall be Goddess of the west part, and it shall be called
after her. And the two great west lands shall be called North Guatama
and South Guatama. And all the islands of the earth shall be called
Oce'ya; and the waters of the earth shall be called Oce'a, signifying,
in likeness of the earth and sky.

6\. For the seven divisions of the earth there shall be seven rulers of
the rank Lord God; and for South Oce'ya, one ruler of the rank Lord; and
for North Oce'ya, one ruler of the rank Lord; and for Japan (Zha'pahn),
one ruler of the rank sub-God.

7\. Hear me, O ye Gods and Goddesses: Who I shall proclaim from amongst
you shall reign during dawn of dan only, but shall raise up a successor
in your own name, and in Jehovih's name, to the same rank, to hold
dominion two hundred years, the next succeeding resurrection.

8\. Fragapatti said: I proclaim, in the name of Jehovih, Ah-oan, Lord
God of Jaffeth; Yima, Lord God of Shem; E'Chad, Lord God of Arabin'ya;
Gir'akshi, Lord God of Heleste; Uropa, Lord Goddess of Uropa; Yaton'te,
Lord God of North Guatama; Kow'anea, Lord God of South Guatama;
M'wing'mi, Lord of South Oce'ya; Ots'ha'ta, Lord of North Oce'ya; and
Soo'fwa, sub-God of Japan.

9\. Approach the throne, O ye Lord Gods, and Lords, and sub-God, that ye
may be anointed in the name of the Father, and duly crowned with the
emblem of All Light.

10\. First came the Lord Gods; and they stood before the throne of
Jehovih, now illumed brilliantly, in gold <span id="page_194a">p.
194a</span> and white. Fragapatti said: By Thy Power and Wisdom, O
Jehovih, which rest in me, do I these, Thy Lord Gods, anoint and bestow
to Thy kingdoms, for Thy glory. Amen! Receive ye of this fire, for it is
His anointing with power and wisdom, that all men and women and
children, mortals and spirits, coming under your dominion, may rejoice
in their Creator, rising forever. Amen!

11\. The Lord Gods responded: May I glorify Thee, O Jehovih, in the
kingdom Thou hast bestowed upon me! In Thy name I receive this fire, for
it is Thy baptism with power and wisdom. Whomsoever Thou hast intrusted
to my dominion will I cause to rejoice at all times, and to rise up
forever in Thy numberless kingdoms!

12\. Fragapatti said: And to you I bequeath, in the Father's name, power
to exalt successors, that ye may also bequeath to your successors power
for them to exalt successors also; and so on, till the next dawn of dan
from the etherean kingdoms, for of such manner shall be the dominion of
the Gods and Lords of earth, and her heavens, for a long season
hereafter.

13\. The Lord Gods responded: Thy power, O Jehovih, do I accept, to
exalt a successor to me in my dominions, with power to bequeath the
exalting power to his successors after him, till the next etherean dawn
of dan.

14\. Fragapatti said: Crown of Thy Crown, O Jehovih, do I weave of Thy
golden light, for these, Thy exalted Sons and Daughters; and with my
hand, in Thy name, crown them. Be Thou with them, now and forever. Amen!

15\. Then Fragapatti gathered of the light present, and fashioned crowns
for them, and they came forward to the foot of the throne, and he
crowned them. So also, at the time they said: I receive Thy fire! there
came down from above a stream of light, bright as the sun, and settled
upon them.

16\. And now they sat down at the foot of the throne, in ancient custom,
and Fragapatti came down from the throne, bringing attendant Gods with
him; and they took the hands of the newly-appointed Gods, and rose them
up; and Fragapatti said: Arise thou, O Lord God, and go thy way. Jehovih
is with thee. Then they stood aside, a little way off.

17\. Then came forward the two Lords. Fragapatti said: O Jehovih, by Thy
power and wisdom in me vested, do I appoint and announce these, Thy
Lords, to their divisions of the earth; and with my hands, and in Thy
name, <span id="page_195a">p. 195a</span> weave I a crown for each of
them, and crown them Lords of Thy light, for Thy glory. Amen!

18\. Hear me, O Lords; that which I bestow in the name of the Father,
and ye receive, ye shall also bestow in the name of the Father upon your
successor at the end of this dawn of dan. Though a Lord God hath
dominion, first, with mortals, and, second, with the first heaven in his
division which resteth on the earth; and though a Lord hath dominion
with mortals only, and with such ashars as minister unto them, ye twain
are made Lords of far-distant islands, where ye shall determine many
things in your own way, often being Gods also, which I also bequeath
unto you, and your successors forever.

19\. The Lords said: What thou hast put upon me, O Jehovih, I will do,
with Thy power and wisdom, for Thy glory, forever. Amen! I receive Thy
crown with praise and thanksgiving, and will bestow it in Thy name upon
my successor, bright as I now receive it.

20\. Fragapatti then laid the crowns upon them, and they sat at the foot
of the throne, also. Then Fragapatti took them by the hand, and raised
them up, saying: Arise, O Lords of Jehovih, and go your ways.

21\. And when they stood aside, Soo'fwa came forward. Fragapatti said:
In Thy name, O Jehovih, and by Thy power in me vested, do I this, Thy
Son, crown sub-God of his division of the earth and its heavens. Of Thy
light I crown him, and bestow him with a rod of water and rod of fire,
that he may have dominion in Thy name, and for Thy glory. Amen!

22\. Hear me, O God: Thy duties make thee both Lord and God; but thy
second resurrections shall be removed at short intervals, as thou shalt
be hereafter informed. But thou shalt have power to appoint assistant
Lords to be with thee, in my name, and the Father's. And thou shalt also
exalt a successor after thee, with power to his successor also.

23\. In Jehovih's name, receive thou this crown of yellow light, for it
is the emblem of the oldest habitable country above the waters of the
earth! And may the Father be with thee, now and forever. Amen!

24\. He also sat at the foot of the throne, and Fragapatti raised him
up, even as the others, saying: Arise, O God, and go thy way. So he
stood aside. And now the es'enaurs sang and chanted, and the marshals
led the way; and the newly empowered Gods departed out of the House of
Mouru. <span id="page_196a">p. 196a</span> And there had been provided
for them, already, a vessel sufficient to reconduct them back to the
earth; and they entered the vessel, and, amidst the flying of banners
and the music of the trumpeters, they sped forward, and were soon out of
sight.
