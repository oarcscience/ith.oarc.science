### Chapter XV

1\. HA'JAH said: With the exaltation of Moeb, so shall my places be
exalted before Jehovih. Let the enumerators of the communities of heaven
send representatives before me. The communities of manufacturers who
produce food and clothes for the es'yans, the communities for hospitals
<span id="page_33">p. 33</span> and nurseries, the communities for
education, the communities for training messengers, and all other
communities.

2\. When the representatives came, according to the instructions of the
marshals, and were before the throne, Ha'jah said:

3\. The toilers shall not be always toilers; the physicians not always
runners after the sick. Whosoever is proficient will I exalt. He that
can walk shall no longer crawl.

4\. Many are wise and strong, and some have passed beyond the boundary
of self-desires for self-sake.

5\. A child may not have self-desires, but then it lacketh wisdom and
strength. A full grown man or woman may have wisdom and strength, but
lack in the abnegation of self.

6\. I will make every community a double from this time forth, and one
shall be called Maga, and the other shall be called Minga. Maga shall be
my promoted laborers, who are being prepared for the second
resurrection.

7\. And Maga's labor shall be in concert with Moeb, the house of
Jehovih. But Minga's labor shall be as heretofore, even with individual
affairs and the organizing of new places for the delivered es'yans, who
are the fruit of the Lords and their kingdoms on the earth.

8\. Let my marshals select judges to carry out these my decrees, in the
name of Jehovih.
