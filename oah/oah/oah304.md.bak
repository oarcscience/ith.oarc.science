### Chapter XXXVIII

1\. AFTER the meeting between De'yus and Osiris and Sudga, when De'yus
was left alone, he thus reasoned: Since Sudga and Osiris have thus left
me uncivilly amidst a most disgusting quarrel, it must follow that on
their arrival home they will secede, taking their kingdoms with them.
Well, it will be well; I will the more warmly bind my fellowship to
Te-in, and we twain shall overthrow Sudga and Osiris, and take all their
spoils.

2\. While De'yus thus soliloquized, messengers came from Che-su-gow,
Te-in's heavenly place, bringing this word: Greeting to thee: our Lord
God: Te-in hath seceded, and taken both his heavenly and his corporeal
dominions unto himself. With an army of two hundred million angel
warriors he is walling his heavenly kingdom around on every side; none
can pass or repass without his permission.

3\. Before De'yus recovered from his surprise, behold, other messengers
came from Sudga's heavenly place, saying: Greeting to thee, our Lord
God: Sudga hath seceded, taking with him his heavenly kingdom and his
earth dominions, Vind'yu! With an army of two hundred million angel
warriors he is walling his heavenly kingdom around on every side; none
can pass or repass without his permission!

4\. De'yus said: So alike and like! Then these rascal Gods had this
planned beforehand! Presently other messengers arrived, saying: Greeting
to thee, our one-time Lord God of heaven and earth! Osiris and Baal and
Ashtaroth have seceded, taking their heavenly kingdoms and their mortal
dominions with them. I, Osiris, have spoken. Thy higher grades I will
draw unto myself; my lower grades I will banish unto thee!

5\. De'yus said: Well, it is well. I will now make stronger the other
heavenly divisions unto me; and the earth divisions, too long neglected
by me; Uropa, Guatama, North and South, and their heavenly places.

6\. But whilst he thus soliloquized, behold, messengers arrived from
these places, also announcing their secession in like manner. Then
De'yus was silent for a long while, considering. But satan came to him,
saying:

7\. Darkness cometh unto all the great, for by this the light is made to
shine brighter. Now, since all access to the corporeal earth is cut off,
and since all thy supplies for food and raiment must come up from the
earth, it followeth that thou shalt lower Hored, thy heavenly place,
nearer to the face of the earth. The which accomplished, thou shalt send
ten thousand millions of thy warrior angels against these rebellious
Gods and despoil them of their dominions, and cast them into hell, and
repossess thou the whole earth.

8\. De'yus said: It is true! My way is clear. These rascally Gods know
not how foolishly they have exposed themselves. Hored is wide enough to
cover them up. And by fire will I chase the drujas upon them, ten
thousand million strong; flood them with such foulness that their
kingdoms will go to pieces under them and suffocate them in the horrid
stench.

9\. De'yus then called together his vice-Gods, and his Holy Council, and
his highest-raised officers; and he related to them what had occurred,
and his plans ahead. But that he might the better deliberate and gain
their acquiescence, he granted a day of recreation to meet on the
following day at the trumpet call.

10\. But lo and behold, on the day of recreation, no less than seven
hundred millions of his highest grades left him and Hored, and descended
to the heavenly kingdoms of his former Gods, some to one and some to
another, whilst a few of them descended to the earth to found small
kingdoms of their own. Danger was already staring Anuhasaj in the face.

11\. Accordingly, he at once chose his officers, and set them to work,
but owing to their lack of knowledge in such matters, only small
sections were bound and lowered at one time, at which rate a hundred
years would be required to accomplish the work. Hereat, De'yus' heart
began to fail him. The prophecies of the higher Gods, that he and his
kingdoms would be ultimately broken up and cast into hell, began to show
signs of realization fearful to contemplate.

12\. Anuhasaj had no time for war, <span id="page_425">p. 425</span> but
must now use every strategem in his power to prevent dismemberment in
his own kingdom. In these straits a good fortune came to him in a
ji'ay'an harvest falling in all the atmospherean heavens, compressing
and falling, so that his lowest grades were provided with sustenance
from above, and they were pacified.

13\. Jehovih had spoken to Cpenta-armij, in her far-off etherean worlds,
saying: Behold, the earth, she entereth now the ji'ay'an fields of
Tu'e'vraga, in My high roads, Loo-sutsk. A little while will I feed the
self-Gods of the lower heavens, and lead them on to know My power.
