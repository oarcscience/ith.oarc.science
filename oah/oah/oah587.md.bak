### Chapter XXV

GOD SHOWETH HOW AND WHEN THE SECOND RESURRECTION MANIFESTETH UNTO
MORTALS.

1\. GOD said: In the cities and country places, I have innumerable
Lords, apportioned to districts and to the mortals and angels thereof.

2\. And my Lords know the rates and grades of their people, their
occupations, their aspirations, their labor, their behavior, private and
public.

3\. Now, behold, I have said unto my Lords: The era of dictation is
past; man hath arrived at kosmon. Declare ye the light of my heavens
unto man; but let man judge himself, and labor to save himself, that he
may have honor and glory thereby.

4\. And I further said unto my Lords: Man hath prayed, saying: Thy
kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven. Now, this I give unto you:
That, where men abnegate self, and affiliate into a communal
brotherhood, after the manner of my heavenly kingdoms, then shall ye
affiliate my organic angels with such mortals, and make them one with my
second resurrections.

5\. And ye shall surround such communal brotherhoods with the light of
my kingdoms, thereby controlling the angelic intercourse with mortals,
so that drujas and vampire spirits cannot molest them.

6\. And these brotherhoods shall be taught to question not the spirits
and oracles on personal matters, but for light and truth as to what will
contribute to meliorating the condition of man, and as to light and
truth, regarding the higher and lower heavens; and as to attaining
spiritual gifts and great wisdom.

7\. And such mortals shall have times and places for worshipful matters;
and these times shall be in concert with my Lord of that district; and
the light of his throne shall be given unto such a brotherhood.

8\. The members of such a brotherhood shall not desire a leader; neither
will any one of them desire to be a leader. For, if one should so
desire, he would not be of the Godhead, but of himself.

9\. Moreover, none of the members of such a brotherhood shall go off, of
his own accord, to minister as an individual to the inhabitants of Uz.
But each and all in the brotherhood shall concentrate their profits and
force unto one end and object.

10\. Even so, O man, are my organic heavens; all the members of each
heaven being as a unit with the whole, they waste not their strength and
time in isolated emdeavors.

11\. Whereby, when a prophet foolishly boasteth to thee, as to having
some high-raised angel, with a loud-sounding name, as his special
guardian and guide, know thou such prophet is in the hands of drujas,
who have not entered my heavenly kingdoms.

12\. Neither hath it ever happened on the earth with any individual man,
raised up by me or my Lords for a specific work, like Moses, or Ka'yu,
or Sakaya, or any other, that they knew of or boasted of any especial
angel over them; but all of them experienced the light, which was as a
pillar of fire.

13\. Even such is the manifestation of the second resurrection through
my Lord and his Holy Council.

14\. And the manifestations are not like those of a mere magician; but
the accomplishment of something that embraceth nations, empires and
mighty peoples.

15\. For this reason, O man, I declare unto thee that the Father's
kingdom is now being founded on earth, and the mortal manifestation
thereof is near at hand.

16\. But it shall not come in this era, as in the past, through any one
great leader-forth; but it shall appear as a spontaneous light,
permeating the soul of thousands; and they shall come forth,
establishing Jehovih in truth and fullness.

17\. Now, therefore, O man, consider the judgment of God against all
such as are called the best of men, the wisest of men, the greatest of
kings or queens or popes; for none of these have even entered the first
resurrection in their own practice.
