### Chapter XII

1\. WHILST the heavens of the earth were thus stirred up with war and
with anticipated misfortunes and strange doctrines, there came to
Paradise, before the throne of God, a host of seven thousand angels who
had been victims of the inquisitions under the inspiration of the false
Kriste, Looeamong, praying an audience with God.

2\. Accordingly, after the chief marshal had announced this before the
throne and Holy Council, God commanded them to approach, and speak.

3\. And those who were leaders then came, and spake. These were: Rochus,
Estella, Coceicas, Martin, Ajedio, Burton, Gardener, Oguier, Isagades,
Thornton, Wincelaus, Hepburn, Autonus, Hague, Bothna, Hijas, Sedasius,
Prague, Septullus, Thilinae, Portia, Fuessa, Barm, Donia, Sarekka,
Solomon, Jolif, Gallileo, Sega, Spinola, Sutton, Jinuthes, Sirach,
Obenaes, Pelachon, Berttimo, Feirdonas, Puberttas, Quidonatus, Paglia,
Suzarathga, Wotchganheim, Givier, Dospastonitus, Leiberanz, Jasman,
Orolf, Meyer, Litz, Herman, Dolche, Mogan, Ruchtevolt, Yokamsteimer,
Bolch, Calas, Radby, Yan'tos, Le'chaim, Fetch, Bliney, Catherine
(queen), Lambert, Holt, Renn, Savicht, John, Barnes, Sanwalt, Biers,
Drumfoldt, Nekairo, Hemsted, Wight, Thuce, Kerby, Askew, Wolfe,
Bartholf, Brown, Wishartd, Mille, Sadarak, Gaepon, Hutton, Somerset,
Railif, Bedford, Wehlen, Gaison, Darcy, Wallace, Tudon, Taylor, Farrar,
Jones, White, Myers, Henry, Atino, Percy, Alies, Flower, Joseph, Milne,
Warne, Simpson, Latimer, Ridley, Cranmer, Lang, Pesth, Bradbridge,
Walstein, Allin, Jesse, Ormes, Staveson and Donald. And this is the
substance of what they said:

4\. Most Holy God, Jehovih's Son, greeting in love, in pity and in
anger!

5\. We are not Gods, nor pure, nor holy. Therefore pity us.

6\. We are not happy, and feel that in our struggles to find the truth
we have been unfairly used. Therefore, pity us.

7\. We were born in mud-holes, and have soiled garments. Therefore, have
compassion upon us.

8\. We are in search of clean water, that we may go wash ourselves.
Therefore, guide us.

9\. We have such strength as a mad wolf might be proud of. Therefore,
use us.

10\. We have not such mercy and forgiveness as becometh Gods. Therefore,
give us rough work to do.

11\. Such work, in fact, as would require no one to split a hair to
discern right or wrong.

12\. Not that we desire to glut ourselves in vengeance against the false
Kriste. One step higher, O God.

13\. As such a matter, if an innocent lamb were pursued by a wolf, give
us to rush in, and save the lamb.

14\. Now, behold, the rumor hath come to us, that thou wilt establish
Guatama free from the dominion of Gods and Saviors.

15\. And it cometh to this: we are so far on the road to purification,
that we can no longer catch the false Kriste's angels, and hurl them
into hell.

16\. Nevertheless, we are not so fastidiously pure, but we would seize
his evil-working angels, and hold them by the throats till thou hadst
thy great country founded safely for Jehovih's kingdom.

17\. If, therefore, thou canst appropriate seven thousand angels in some
loose and unscrupulous corner, to do thee good service against the
tyrant and remorseless Looeamong, behold, we stand before Jehovih and
thee, to do thy will as thou mayest command.

18\. God said unto them: My brothers and sisters, in the name of
Jehovih, I welcome you.

19\. What ye can do, that shall ye do; nor shall any but yourselves
judge yourselves.

20\. As far as ye have the light of the Father, so shall ye serve Him.

21\. To Him only are ye responsible; for His triumph shall be the
redemption of heaven and earth.

22\. Behold, Looeamong will surely inspire a war, both in Guatama, with
mortals, and in the heavens thereof, with the angels.

23\. My angel hosts shall inspire the mortals of Guatama to found a
government free from the dominion of Gods and Saviors.

24\. War will follow. Now, behold, I have appointed Yotahiza, as my Lord
for those regions. Repair ye thither with my messengers who know the
way, and Yotahiza will receive you in my name, and give you work in
justice, truth and wisdom.

25\. The army of the inquisition then saluted, and departed, and they
came to Yotahiza's heavenly station with the colonists in Guatama.
