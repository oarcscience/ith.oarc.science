### Chapter XXXIV

1\. ON the arrival of the avalanza, the es'enaurs of Astoreth, and the
trumpeters of the colonies, sang and played, being joined by the hosts
aboard the vessels. And when they ceased, Thulae, assistant God of
Astoreth, commanded the marshals to receive the hosts, foremost of whom
were Yima and his attendants, preceded by his traveling marshals and
harpers, the latter being five thousand females, led by We'aytris,
Goddess of Foes'ana, in etherea. After these came the marshals of
Fragapatti, ten thousand; then the swift messengers, ten thousand; then
Fragapatti, on whose left was Yaton'te, and on whose right was Hoab. And
these were followed by the musicians, and then came the hosts in
general.

2\. Yima ascended the throne at once, but Fragapatti and his hosts
halted in the arena, within the circuit of the altar. Next beyond these
were the guards of the lights; and still outside of these were the
Crescent Members of the Council.

3\. Yima said: In the name of Jehovih, I welcome thee, O Fragapatti,
Chief of Obsod and Goomatchala, to the throne of God! In His Wisdom and
Power I would have thee honor Astoreth by taking possession, in the
Father's name!

4\. Without replying, Fragapatti walked alone to the throne, saluting on
the sign of HIGH NOON, which Yima answered IN THE SETTING SUN! Yima
stood aside, and Fragapatti ascended and stood in front of the middle of
the throne. He said:

5\. Into Thy possession, O Jehovih, receive Thou this, Thy Throne!
Hardly had Fragapatti spoken, when a light, bright as the sun, settled
above his head, and a Voice came out of the midst of the light, saying:

6\. To thee, My Son, and to thy son, and to thy Gods and Lords, and to
all who follow them in My name, do I bequeath this, My Throne, forever!
Whosoever becometh one with Me, shall not only hear My Voice and receive
My Power, but also inherit that which he createth out of My creation.

7\. Jehovih's Voice continued, saying: Whosoever looketh upon My works
and saith: Behold, I cannot cope with these elements! is short in faith
and wisdom. For I have not created in vain, that either mortals or
spirits cannot control My elements in their respective places. They
shall improve the talents I have given them.

8\. I made the earth wide, and filled it with many things; but I gave
man a foundation, that he might attain to the mastery of land and water,
and minerals, and of all the living. Yea, I gave him a corporeal body to
practice with, and as an abiding place for the assistance of his own
soul.

9\. And I created atmospherea wider than the earth, and filled it with
all manner of spiritual things, and with the substance of plateaux; but
I gave also to the spirits of the dead, talents, the which can attain to
the mastery of all things in atmospherea.

10\. Whoever hath attained to these things is like a traveling sun: My
light is upon him; he prepareth the place, and My Voice cometh out of
the Light thereof. Let My Sons and Daughters stir themselves up; where
they are gathered together in My name, there am I also. My hand is upon
them; My Power becometh one with them, and My Voice is possible in their
midst. The Voice ceased.

11\. There were many present who had not previously heard the Voice of
All Light, and because of the brilliancy they were blinded for a while,
but presently restored. Fragapatti then said: Hoab and Yaton'te, come ye
and sit on the throne. And they went up and sat on the throne; and in
the same time the es'enaurs chanted, HAIL TO GREAT JEHOVIH'S VOICE! HIS
SONS AND DAUGHTERS, OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS, ARE RETURNED ONCE MORE TO
THEIR NATIVE RED STAR, TO PROCLAIM HIS BOUNDLESS GLORY!

12\. Fragapatti said: In the Father's name, I proclaim a day of
recreation; to resume labor at the sound of the trumpet in the east. And
now the hosts mingled together freely, being buoyant with cheerfulness.
And during the recreation, millions of ethereans went out into the
plateau, visiting the places of learning, the factories and hospitals,
and such places as belong to the lower heavens.

13\. On the next day, at the call of the trumpet, the people resumed
their places, and after the music, Fragapatti said: To Thee, O Thulae,
will I speak in the name of Jehovih. Thou art chosen by the Father to be
assistant to Yima, Jehovih's Son, during this dawn, which is near its
end, and after that thou shalt be Lord and God of these heavens and of
the earth beneath, for two hundred years.

14\. Because thou art wise and good, the Father hath raised thee up, and
great is thy glory. That thou mayst have strength and power, thou shalt
in thy reign be called Yima, also; for the time hath now come to the
earth when mortals must learn to know the Lords and Gods who rule over
them.

15\. During two hundred years will the earth be traveling in my Orian
field, Goomatchala, and thou shalt be one with me in thy dominions.
Whatsoever thou shalt require at my hand, I will send to thee. Thou
shalt, therefore, keep thy place in order; and if thou needest a'ji, I
will send it; if thou needest dan, I will send it.

16\. Be less concerned about the spirits in thy heavens than about
mortals on the earth. Mortals must have sufficient a'ji, that the race
become not extinct; they must have a sufficient dan, that they become
not as beasts. For which reason, every eleventh year thou shalt number
abracadabra (See Book of Saphah) and supply my swift messengers with the
lists thereof. And I will bring the <span id="page_262">p. 262</span>
elements of Goomatchala to bear upon thy labor profitably to the Father!

17\. In the next place, be thou careful of too much leniency toward the
spirits in the first resurrection. Suffer them not to abide with mortals
as teachers. Remember thou that mortals so love their dead kindred, they
would even deprive them of heavenly education for the sake of having
them around about them. Remember, also, that the spirits of the recent
dead, who are entered as es'yans in all good heavens, so love their
mortal kindred, that they would seek no higher heaven than to linger
around about them on the earth. Which habit groweth upon them, so that
in two or three generations they become drujas, worthless to themselves,
knowing little of the earth and less of heaven.

18\. Be thou firm, therefore, in holding dominion over the es'yans,
permitting them only to return to mortals under guard; and especially
preventing them from teaching other than the Ormazdian religion.

19\. After this, thou shalt be circumspect in Astoreth: remembering that
it is the part of a God to provide his kingdom for the development of
all the talents Jehovih hath created withal. For thou shalt so commingle
labor and recreation, and rest and learning, that each and every one is
of equal attraction.

20\. And whether thy commandments be for angels or for mortals, thou
shalt, first of all, and last of all, inspire them to faith in the
Creator, and to follow the little star of light He hath given to every
soul. Fragapatti ceased.

21\. Jehovih said: I have drawn My cresent and My altar. Whoever would
hear My Voice and heed My commandments, let them hearken to the forms
and ceremonies that shape the soul of things. I am Order; I am
Stateliness without severity; I am Love without passion; I am Wisdom by
suggestion, and without dictation; I am the most Silent, but most
Powerful; I am the Least Seen, but Always Present when asked for.

22\. And now, since the people knew Fragapatti was about to depart, the
proper officers arranged matters, so that all could pass in front of the
throne to receive his blessing. Accordingly, the es'enaurs commenced
singing, and the procession began. The master of the lights of the
Council lowered them, and Fragapatti lowered his own lights, and came
down and stood at the foot of the throne, covered with light drapery,
which fell down to his feet.

23\. His hands he held upward, waving gently; and he created drapery and
perfume, and wreaths of flowers, and bestowed something upon every soul
that passed, of whom there were more than a thousand millions!

24\. And when the procession had all passed, Fragapatti sat down at the
foot of the throne. Then came down Yima and took his hand, saying: Son
of Jehovih, arise and go thy way, and the Father be with thee! So
Fragapatti rose up and departed, and Hoab and Yaton'te and Yima and
Thulae with him; and Yima left Hi'etra, Goddess of Me'Loo, on the throne
of Astoreth.

25\. So they entered the avalanza, and, with music and rejoicing,
departed on their journey. And Yima conducted them throughout his
dominions, both in heaven and on earth. For many days Fragapatti thus
dwelt with Yima and Thulae; and after he had inspected their labors, and
his recorders completed their record, which was to be afterward taken to
etherea and deposited in the libraries of Fragapatti's dominions, Yima
took leave, and his piedmazr was discharged, and he departed for
Astoreth, whither he arrived in due season. But Fragapatti proceeded to
the dominions of Ah'oan, Lord God of Jaffeth and her heavens.
