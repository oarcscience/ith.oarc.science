Jehovih,  
Eolin, E-O-IH, Eloih.  
Egoquim, Ormazd.  
To Whom none can attain forever.

God said: I am, as any other spirit of the dead, a one-time man upon the
earth, thy elder brother of tens of thousands of years' experience.
Distinguish, then, that the twain God and Jehovih are not the same one.
No more is thy God than what thou shalt be in time to come, and all
angels, the Gods and Lords and generals and captains and chiefs in
heaven are but the brothers and sisters of mortals and the spirits of
the dead; and none of there, however exalted, can create **Life** or
**Motion** or an **Individual** or Person. These are from Jehovih, The
Creator.

Incarnated. Incarnate.

Heavens of the Earth. Hell, Chaos, Knots.

Saviour. Saviours.

And the **Beast** divided itself into four great heads, and possessed
the earth about; and man fell down and worshipped them, 1.11.

AS FOR EXAMPLE:

Looeamong was the false God who founded, by inspiration, the great sect
called **Christians**. He is first mentioned in Book of Eskra, chap
xiii.; and his career is continued in the Books of Eskra and Es, until
he is finally cast into hell, which corresponds in date to the time the
pope established himself as vicegerent on earth, and very properly
because his God was *non est*.

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

Kabalactes, the God who, by inspiration, founded what is now called
Buddhism. He is first mentioned in Book of Eskra, chap. xiii.; and his
history is continued in Books of Eskra and Es, until he is finally cast
into hell.

Ennochissa, who, by inspiration, founded modern Brahmanism, first
mentioned in Book of Eskra, chap. xiii. His history continues in Books
of Eskra and Es, and he is finally cast into hell.

Thoth, or Gabriel, who, by inspiration, founded Mohammedanism, first.
mentioned in Book of Eskra, chap. xlix. He also is cast into hell, Book
of Es, chap. xv.

These four false Gods were delivered out of hell by God, Jehovih's Son.

They figured largely in the great wars against Jehovih in the time of
the ancient Jews.

Besides these there were many false Gods and one great Goddess,
**Ashtaroth**. **Baal** and she were both overcome and cast into hell by
the founder of Christianity, Looeamong, through his great warrior
servant, Thoth.

Of the lesser attempts at false Godheads mention is made of **Sayawan**,
founder of **Swedenborgism** (748.10 to 13), and of **Piad** (748.7-8),
the founder of **Mormanism**; also of **Lowgannus**, the founder of
**Shakerism** (748.9), showing that all these sects have had their
origin in the lower heavens.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[xiii:\*](oah06.htm#fr_0.md) The term Christ or
Kriste here used must not be confounded with Jesus of Nazareth, called,
in these Scriptures, Joshu.
