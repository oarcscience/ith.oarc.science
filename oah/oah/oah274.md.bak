### Chapter VIII

OF ANUHASAJ; WHO, BY TREACHERY, BECOMETH LORD GOD, SECOND IN RANK TO
GOD, SON OF JEHOVIH

1\. JEHOVIH spake to God in Craoshivi, his heavenly place, saying:
Behold, I have given great light to the earth and her heavens hundreds
of years; and My Gods and Lords are becoming conceited in their own
power and wisdom to rule in heavenly places.

2\. Now will I try them for a season, by sending them a'ji'an darkness;
for My Gods and Lords must learn to master the elements I have created
in the firmament.

3\. So Jehovih brought the earth and her heavens into a dark region for
a season.

4\. Anuhasaj, a one-time sub-God under Ahura, the false, was cast into
hell, and then delivered out of hell, whereupon he repented, and became
a Faithist in heaven; serving many years in holy works in Ailkin, a
heavenly place of great wisdom.

5\. And it came to pass that Ailkin was raised into a new heavenly
place, called Vara-pishanaha; and in the removing, behold, Ahura ordered
Anuhasaj from the line because of his inharmony. And Anuhasaj suffered
himself to become angered.

6\. Satan (self) said unto Anuhasaj: Who art thou, that one of less
wisdom ordereth thee? Anuhasaj said: Alas, I am a fool, and without will
to assert myself.

7\. For many years Anuhasaj became a wandering spirit in heaven, going
from kingdom to kingdom, doing nothing; and at times descending to the
earth, observing the kingdoms of the earth.

8\. Satan came again to him and said: Hear thou my voice, and thou shalt
triumph over all other Gods. Anuhasaj said: What shall I do? And satan
said: Go thou to Ahura, who offended thee in presence of the
Chieftainess, Cpenta-armij, and say to him: O God, I crave thy
forgiveness. Thou wert right, and I was wrong. I have repented most
bitterly. Now I come to thee, with faith in Jehovih. Him will I serve
forever. Turn me not off, O Ahura; remember thine own one-time
shortness; and the high Gods above thee accepted thee.

9\. Satan continued: Ahura will delight in thee and take thee at thy
word. And thou shalt enter Vara-pishanaha, asking for the lowest of
places; practicing humility in all thy behavior. But be thou fruitful in
making acquaintances with such as shall serve thee afterward.

10\. Satan continued: And whether it be fifty years, or a hundred, or
two hundred, bide thou thy time. But the time shall surely come when
thou shalt be exalted; and thou shalt solicit and accept a place in the
dominions of the Lord God in the Lord-dom of heaven and earth,
Maitraias.

11\. Satan continued: And whether it be one hundred years more, or two
hundred years, it mattereth not to thee; but thou shalt finally attain
to the Lord-dom, and be duly installed and crowned Lord God of heaven
and earth.

12\. And when thou art thus exalted, thou shalt seek to have appointed
such Lords to the ten divisions of earth as are thine own special
friends. And it shall come to pass that the whole earth and her heavens
shall be thine, and thy title shall be Lord God, and all people on earth
and in heaven shall be thy servants.

13\. Anuhasaj said: Thou art the wisest of Gods, O satan. All thou hast
advised will I do; neither shall any one in heaven or earth know my
designs.

14\. And it came to pass in course of another hundred years, Anuhasaj
was promoted on the staff of the Lord God, the guardian, where he served
the Lord God one hundred and seventy years. So the Lord God named
Anuhasaj for his successor.

15\. So God came from Craoshivi and crowned Anuhasaj Lord God of heaven
and earth; with great pageantry and display, God gave him a throne and
placed him upon it. And from this time forth Anuhasaj was known and
saluted as Lord God, which is the first rank below God.

16\. The Lord God said unto satan: Who first shall I bring into my
favor? Satan said: Thou shalt first bring into thy favor Anubi, MASTER
OF THE SCALES OF HEAVEN, and when thou <span id="page_377">p. 377</span>
hast this to thy liking, thou shalt call him THY SON and SAVIOR OF MEN!

17\. The Lord God said unto satan: Who next shall I bring into my favor?
Satan said: Thou shalt next bring into thy favor the ten Lords of the
heavenly kingdoms of the earth. And when thou hast them to thy liking,
thou shalt exalt the chief one of them to be above the rest; and him
that thou exaltest thou shalt call Osiris, for it is a name loved on
earth and in heaven.

18\. Satan said: Thou shalt re-establish thy Lord-dom and call it Hored,
and it shall be the central kingdom of all the heavens belonging to the
earth.

19\. And Anubi shall send the spirits of his department to thy heavens;
and Osiris and all the other Lords shall send the spirits of their
departments to thy kingdom. And in no case shall any more spirits be
sent to Craoshivi; for all people in heaven and earth shall be taught
that thy kingdom is the All Highest Place; and that thou art the All
Highest God, even the Creator of all things; and all angels and mortals
shall be thy servants.

20\. Then went the Lord God to work earnestly, but slowly and surely.
The Lords of all the divisions of the earth were his special friends,
and of such kind as would willingly do his bidding. And they were
learned and of high grade of heavenly experience of more than a thousand
years.

21\. And the Lord God told no one in heaven or on the earth of his
designs; gave no sign or token in his behavior that would make
messengers or swift messengers look at him to read him; and he passed
for the meekest and holiest of Gods.

22\. But the time came at last for which the Lord God had labored
hundreds of years; and he gave a festival in his heavenly place,
inviting the Lords and captains and generals and marshals, whom he knew
would willingly do his bidding.

23\. And they came even as the Lord God had planned, and it was a time
of great joy. And when the feast was ended, then spake the Lord God
before them, spake as one moved in sorrow to do a solemn duty for the
sake of Jehovih.

24\. The Lord God said: O my brothers, hear the words of your Lord God!
Behold, I have charge of the Lord-dom of heaven and earth, I am as a
guardian that standeth by a corn-field to see the corn grow
unmolestedly. My experience is not of a year, nor of a hundred years,
but of thousands of years.

25\. In Jehovih's name I speak before you; for the love I bear for the
souls of men and angels. I belong not to the Diva as do ye Lords; my
voice findeth vent in the fullness of the Father in me.

26\. Who is here that hath not seen great decline, during the last
hundred years, in these heavens, in the faith of angels in the All
Person? Speak then, O ye Lords; and if ye have hearts for more energetic
service for the Father and His kingdoms, now let your tongues have full
liberty, as becometh Gods.

27\. Anubi said: thou art wise, O Lord God. God of Craoshivi layeth the
blame on a'ji.

28\. Then spake Hi-kas, whose heavenly place was over Jaffeth, he said:
My Lord God and my Lords, before your wisdom I bow. I am but as a child
in heaven, little more than a thousand years. My tongue should be silent
before you, my long experienced Lords. Hear me though in my little
wisdom, and pity me for it.

29\. To the east or west, or north or south, all things grow, in heaven
and on the earth; I have seen no greater wisdom than this. One thing
groweth not, the Diva. Behold, the Diva made laws hundreds of years ago,
and they were wise laws in the time they were made. Ye and I, all of us,
are bound by the old Divan laws. The laws have not grown.

30\. Gods older than I am, and Lords also, tell us that the All Light is
a Person and hath Voice; and moreover that long ago He spake to
high-raised Gods, saying: These things, shall be thus and so.

31\. I appeal to your judgment, O my Lord God and My Lords, was that not
a wise doctrine for the ancients? For on this authority angels and
mortals fell down and worshipped Him they saw not. And they were
obedient to do the will of their masters and teachers on this
self-asserted authority of a Person no one had seen!

32\. Which is to say: It is wiser to worship Him we know not, and cannot
comprehend, and is therefore as nothing before us, than to hearken to
the words of most wise Gods and Lords.

33\. If to worship that which we are ignorant of is the highest of
worship, then the fool is the greatest of worshippers. For he is
ignorant of all things. And by virtue of this reason, he who is the
wisest must be the poorest of worshippers. And of a truth, is it not so,
both in heaven and on earth?

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

34\. With the acquisition of knowledge, they all put away the
Unknowable; the ignorant are devout worshippers. Shall we hold our
tongues, saying: Wh-ce, Wh-ce! The ignorant must not know the truth; the
whole truth!

35\. To do this, are we not hypocrites? Some have come to us from
far-off regions, saying there are more delightful heavens, much higher!
Why, then, shall we not all run away and leave this?

36\. My Lord God, and my Lords, these heavens are good enough, if
improved. The earth is good enough, if improved. We want larger kingdoms
and more adorned thrones in our heavens and on the earth.

37\. Next spake Che-le-mung, whose heavenly kingdom was over Arabin'ya.
He said: My Lord hath spoken soul words. With knowledge, what more need
angels or mortals? What value to them is it to say: Beware! The Unseen
heareth and seeth? Or, halt and consider the Divan laws?

38\. My Lord God, for the wisest and best and most honest to assume
dominion, this I have not seen. Thy kingdom should be the largest and
most adorned of all kingdoms. And thou shouldst have, to labor with
thee, Lords with kingdoms greater than all Craoshivi. Cannot our Gods
and our Lords make these heavens the greatest of all regions in the
universe? Shall we and our people forever run off to etherea in search
of higher heavens? And not improve our own? To exalt a place by going
away from it, who hath seen this done?

39\. Arc-wotchissij spake next: his heavenly kingdom was over Vind'yu.
He said: O that I had not struggled so long to put away wisdom like
this! All that hath been spoken I have understood. But I curbed my soul;
I thought I was alone in such reason. Now, so suddenly, I have not words
well schooled. I speak little, lest I trip myself up afterward. It is
the joy of my life to listen to such wise arguments. Another time I will
say more.

40\. After him spake Baal, whose heavenly kingdom was over Heleste and
the south end of Jaffeth to the sea, a young Lord of great promise. He
said: How shall one of my inexperience speak before such Gods as are
here! But because ye have touched upon a matter dear to my soul, my
words will forth. I have seen all these heavens, and even Craoshivi,
waning for hundreds of years. Our kingdoms are like old women, resigned
to routine, living, but dead.

41\. We have the same rites and ceremonies as the ancients; parades and
salutations and anthems sung for thousands of years; and to whom? A
figure-head that is void of shape and person and sense. Who is here that
hath not deserved honor more than such a being? My Lord God hath labored
two thousand years! I have seen him in Vara-pishanaha for more than a
hundred years, stooped to the vilest labor, over bad-smelling drujas,
teaching them, washing them!

42\. The Lord God should have a kingdom wide as the earth, and a million
attendants to do him honorable parade. And when he goeth forth he should
have hundreds of thousands of heralds and trumpeters to proclaim he is
coming. We need such. We need wider fields and more pomp and glory in
our heavens; and kingdoms with great capital cities, and thrones arrayed
in splendor.

43\. Then rose Ashtaroth, assistant to Baal, and Lordess of the East
Wing of his heavenly place. She said: Here are other Lordesses, can
speak wisely. As for me, my words are few. The ancients have taught us
to be plain in all things. And we have made our heavens like orchards
stript of leaves and blossoms. As fast as angels are made bright and
useful, they are persuaded to become Brides and Bridegrooms to Jehovih,
and fly off to remote worlds. Our own beloved earth, that brought us
forth, together with her heavens, are thus forever stript of the most
valuable fruitage and ornaments.

44\. We all know that atmospherea is extensive enough to contain all the
angels the earth will bring forth in millions of years! I appeal to
thee, my Lord God, and to ye, most wise Lords, are not these Brides and
Bridegrooms hoodwinked by the tales of the etherean Gods? And by the
parade and pageantry of the marriage ceremony? And by the fire-ships,
and pomp and splendor of the marshals, and trumpeters, and music, and
the high-raised Gods?

45\. Behold, we have here one who can invent all these glories, even our
Lord God. He should have such a heavenly place of splendor that the
Brides and Bridegrooms would fly to him instead of the far-off heavens.

46\. After this manner spake the Lords and Lordesses, and when they had
all spoken, there rose up Anuhasaj, now lawfully anointed Lord God. He
said:
