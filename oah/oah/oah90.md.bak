### Chapter III

1\. I, Apollo, Jehovih's Son, proclaim an age when man on earth
considered not harmony, nor symmetry, nor music, as Gods!

2\. And Jehovih's voice came to me in the etherean firmament, and place
of Pti'mus, saying:

3\. Apollo, My Son, thou God of Su'ad, God of Don'ga, God of Tah, behold
the red star, the earth, she cometh through thy dominions. Go thou to
her with thy hosts, a sufficient number, and give her a new God, and
call his name Apollo.

4\. Behold, neither men nor angels on the red star comprehend the
harmony of My works; and because of their own inharmony they deny Me,
being blind to My Person. Go thou, My Son, and make them idolators of
harmony, symmetry and music, for a long season, that they may become
organically attuned from the time of their birth upward.

5\. I said: I perceive Thy wisdom, O Jehovih. And I called together a
hundred millions of Thy sons and daughters, and told them what Thou
hadst said. With one accord, they said: We have examined the red star
since the time of Wan, and we perceive truly, the time hath come for thy
labor, O Apollo.

6\. I said: Send an oniy'yah to the heaven of the earth and deliver her
God and Lords and all persons capable of the second resurrection. And
say ye to God and his Lords: Thus saith Apollo, Son of Jehovih, and God
of three etherean worlds: Greeting in the name of the Father, and love
unto you all. For your glorious work I have assigned seven Teres and
Don'ga. Thither gather ye your hosts, where is prepared a place of rest
and comfort. The earth and her heaven shall be left in darkness for
thirty of her days, having neither God nor Lords.

7\. So my legions departed for the earth in an etherean ship of fire,
led by Tu'ain, Goddess of Proe'king, a place of great learning in the
etherean mountains of Horatanad; and they delivered according to my
decrees, and the earth was without a God and Lords for thirty days.

8\. And the voice of Jehovih came to me again, saying: Hear thy Creator,
O My Son, thou that sprangest from the land long since submerged, who
has spanned many of My worlds, behold, the legions of Sue and his mighty
resurrections are still preserved to <span id="page_115a">p. 115a</span>
mortals and angels earth-bound: Of the Gods and Goddesses who danced and
sang before men; and of the uneven match betwixt spirits and Gods.

9\. Profiting in this, the people of the red star have become rich in
rites and ceremonies, and preferring the swift-footed to the slow, the
nimble to the clumsy, the loo'is have well laid out the road to thy
success.

10\. So, I perceived beforehand how I should proceed when I landed in
the lower heaven and her earth.

11\. When the time came, I departed, still remembering my native star
with well treasured pride. And that all things should express the labor
Jehovih put upon me, my oniy'yah excelled in beauty all other etherean
vessels that had ever descended to the earth.

12\. How shall I comprehend Thy magnitude, O Jehovih? What is the
journey of a God before Thee? We build a ship for a hundred millions,
and are vain of its size and beauty; but when we launch out into Thy
etherean realms, we fain would hide our faces in shame of our vanity. We
sail through a thousand of Thy crystal worlds and talk of great
distances, but the mirror of Thy boundless creation lieth still before
us. We recall the red star, our native home, a single gem amidst the
countless millions Thou hast cast into the universe, and we are
speechless because of Thy Awful Extent.

13\. Wherein hast Thou not excelled Thyself, O Jehovih! In one moment,
we behold Thy Vastness; in another, Thy Microscopic Hand in the smallest
ethe'ic wave, and in the spear of grass down on the swift corporeal
stars. We applaud Thee for Thy handiwork, and yet ere our thoughts have
overrun the smallest part, Thou turnest our eyes inward to the soul of
things, an endless wonder.

14\. How shall I comprehend Thy designs, O Jehovih? Thou drivest me back
to the time Thy angels came and stood man upright, saying: Be thou a
man; and be thou a woman! But they would not.

15\. Again and again, Thy pitying hand stood them up, and Thy voice
came, saying: Talk, O man! Come, thou shalt help to perfect thyself. But
man was slow in perceiving wisdom; that which came to his flesh he
loved.

16\. I remember the earth, O Father! Men and women with long hair
hanging down; and hands with claw nails, fierce and war-like. And hair
in tufts and short-curled. Whose eyes were drawn down like a lion's, and
mouth wide and falling open, like a dog that is tired.

<span id="page_116a">p. 116a</span>

17\. Therefore Thou hast called me, O Jehovih; and I perceive Thy double
purpose: For a man left alone would select and mate, and evolve to
terrible war! And Thou storest here an idol to unfit him for cruel
deeds.

18\. So, from Thy etherean realms, wherein for fifty thousand years Thy
Gods and Goddesses had trained me to comprehend the discipline of Thy
created heavens, I came, descending, down, down to the red star, where
Thou first quickened me into being, that I might fulfill Thy mandates.

19\. Thy hand took me up, Thy hand sent me down; I had learned not to
fear; the tree of faith had grown in me; I knew the secret of All Power.
As a mortal goeth into a dark cavern, where the air is damp and
unacceptable to the nose, so came my hosts, O Jehovih, out of etherea
into the vortex of the earth, the dull atmosphere.

20\. Thy voice came to me, saying: Go around the earth with thy
oniy'yah, My Son. Stir up the atmosphereans; they that know no higher
heaven. Behold, they have mutinied against My God and Lords; have
rejected My proffered wisdom. Their delight is in war and the deeds of
mortals. As men on earth gather round to witness beasts in battle, so
gather these countless millions of spirits to witness kingdoms of
mortals in war, and fire, and plunder. And by their presence urge men to
cruelty and cunning horrors.
