<FONT SIZE=2><P>GOD ILLUSTRATETH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF MORTALS ACCORDINGLY AS THEY ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE FIRST OR SECOND RESURRECTION</FONT>.</P>
<P>1. CONSIDER the words of thy God, O man, and profit thou in the application of thy judgment for the growth of thy soul everlastingly.</P>
<P>2. Of the first resurrection man saith: I know my rights and dare maintain them.</P>
<P>3. Of the second, he saith: I ask not for rights for my own self; whatsoever is put upon me, that will I bear.</P>
<P>4. Of the first: No man shall impose upon me.</P>
<P>5. Of the second: Impose upon me whatsoever thou wilt.</P>
<P>6. Of the first: Let me justify myself in what I have done; behold, I am falsely accused.</P>
<P>7. Of the second: Jehovih knoweth my case; neither will I plead in my own behalf. Whoso is falsely accused, let him wait; in time the Father will right all things.</P>
<P>8. Of the first: Let no man try to rule over me; I will maintain my liberty at all hazards.</P>

<P>9. Of the second: Since no man in all the world hath full liberty--why should I ask it?</P>
<P>10. Of the first: Make me a leader; let me be the head.</P>
<P>11. Of the second: Make me not a leader; lest I would feel responsible for those I led.</P>
<P>12. Of the first: I have done my share, let others do as well.</P>
<P>13. Of the second: Though I do all I can, yet I am short before Jehovih.</P>
<P>14. Of the first: O that I were rich as my neighbor, what a great good I would do!</P>
<P>15. Of the second: Take all I have, and at once.</P>
<P>16. Of the first: Myself, and then my family will I help; after that, others.</P>
<P>17. Of the second: We are all brothers and sisters; why shall we prefer one of Jehovih's children above another?</P>
<P>18. Of the first: I will not consider my shortcomings, lest I be dejected in spirit.</P>
<P>19. Of the second: Teach me, O Father, to look into my every act, word and thought, to purify myself in Thy sight.</P>
<P>20. Of the first: What might the world say? Ah! my reputation is at stake!</P>
<P>21. Of the second: What will Jehovih say? With Him must I preserve my reputation, more than with ten thousand worlds.</P>
<P>22. Of the first: Who injureth me shall suffer by my hand.</P>
<P>23. Of the second: Let us render good unto those that injure us.</P>
