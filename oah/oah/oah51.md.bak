### Chapter VIII

1\. IN the second year of Yeshuah, God (that is Ah'shong) caused to be
established in his heaven all requisite places of learning and industry,
whereby and wherein es'yans might be educated to good works, and to a
general knowledge of Jehovih's kingdoms (universe), and there
volunteered a sufficient number of ethereans as teachers and practisers
of work for all that was required.

2\. God said: Now that the earth and heaven are purified from evil, my
Lords shall deliver the es'yans to the asaphs, and enjoin them to
deliver in Yeshuah, which I have established a short distance from the
earth as a barrier against their returning to mortals. Jehovih said:
Suffer not the blind to lead the blind.

3\. And it was so; at the time mortals died, their spirits were taken by
the asaphs to Yeshuah; and to make this an acceptable labor to the
es'yans, God said: Tell my Lords of the earth to teach mortals by
inspiration and otherwise of my kingdom, Yeshuah.

4\. And it so came to pass through the Lords and the ashars, that is,
the guardian spirits with mortals, that the name, Yeshuah, was
established on the earth. God said: In the time of kosmon, men shall
say: Whence came the name of heavenly things? But Yeshuah shall lie hid
away, and Jehovih will in that day stretch forth His hand and disclose
all.

5\. But mortals were thick in tongue, and could not say Yeshuah, and
they said I. E. Su; hence came the name of many men, Iesu, <span
id="fr_10"></span>[3](#fn_10.md) signifying, without evil, which is the
ultimate salvation of the soul.

6\. Jehovih spake through God, saying: The time of the end of dawn
cometh, and My emancipated sons and daughters shall return to their
places, taking the resurrected with them. But that the earth and lower
heaven may not be left in darkness, provide ye a God and Lords and
marshals and messengers, and all other officers, to rule and teach in My
name.

7\. From the born of earth shall ye make them, and they shall hold
office for two hundred years, and four hundred years, and six hundred
years, according to the atmospherean cycles.

8\. Suffer not My etherean hosts to remain longer than dawn, either on
the earth or within atmospherea, for I shall take the earth into dark
regions in order to build it up to a higher state for the time that
cometh after.

9\. The voice departed. God said: Let the voice of the council
deliberate on this matter, and speak before the Father. For I will
provide also a heaven in the ancient place of Hored, and it shall be
called Bispah, for it shall be a place of reception for the spirits of
the dead preparatory to their being brought to Yeshuah.

10\. In course of time there were raised up many of the earth-born, and
God selected them and appointed them to fill the places; and he founded
Bispah, and officered it according to the command of Jehovih. After God
established rites and ceremonies, and processions and dances, with
sacred words, in Yeshuah, he commanded his Lords to give the same things
to mortals, and they so fulfilled all that was designed from the
beginning.

11\. In the seventh year of dawn God commanded his council to select
another God and Lords, and other officers; and the council proceeded
after the manner of the ancients, selecting the most learned and the
purest and holiest; according to their rank in Godliness chose they
them, and a record was made of these matters and deposited in the
library of Yeshuah.

12\. So it came to pass that God called in his own Lords of the earth,
and sat apart the first day of the new moon as the day on which he would
consecrate the God and Lords, his successors; and he called the day Mas,
the name of which endureth to this day of kosmon. Furthermore, God
established the moon's day (mas) on the earth as a time of consecration.
(And this is the origin of saying mass).

13\. When the chosen were in place before the throne, God said: By
command of Jehovih are ye brought before me, His Son; in His name will I
<span id="page_56">p. 56</span> consecrate ye to the places commanded of
Him.

14\. The marshals then conducted him that ranked highest up to the seat
of the throne. God said:

15\. In the name of Jehovih, and by His Power, Wisdom and Love, do I
ordain thee God of heaven and earth. He that receiveth from my hand
receiveth from my Father, who raised me up.

16\. The initiate said: All power cometh from the Father. All wisdom
cometh from the Father. All love cometh from the Father. In His name and
by virtue of His commandments through His Son, receive I all that is put
upon me, for His glory, forever!

17\. God then said: Give me a crown, O Father, for Thy Son! A scarlet
light descended from above, and God reached forth his hands and wove it
into a crown and placed it on the initiate's head, saying: God of heaven
and earth, thee I crown. And now shalt thou receive also the sacred
triangle, which is the heirloom of the Gods of earth. And he hung it
around his neck, adding: And since there can be but one God on earth or
in this heaven, I herewith uncrown myself in Jehovih's name and salute
thee, O God, GOD OF EARTH AND HEAVEN!

18\. Ah'shong now stood to the right, and God, who was ordained, went
and sat on the throne, and there descended red and blue lights from
above, enveloping him completely, and he was quickened. He said:

19\. Let the initiates for Lords of earth approach the throne of the
Most High Jehovih!

20\. The five Lords came forward. God said: Join hands and receive ye
from the Father. By virtue of the Power, Wisdom and Love of Jehovih,
vested in me, receive I thee as the highest chosen; and I proclaim thee
Lord <span id="fr_11"></span>[4](#fn_11.md) of earth, in Jehovih's name!
Accept this crown from heaven above, the like of which cannot be woven
from earthly things; by its power shalt thou remain in accord with
Yesuah and the kingdoms above.

21\. God fashioned the crowns and then crowned them Lords of the five
divisions of the earth. God said: Retire thou aside and choose thy
messengers and officers, and after ordaining them, depart to the kingdom
prepared for thee. The Lords said:

22\. In Thy name, O Jehovih, do I accept that which Thou hast put upon
me. With all my wisdom and strength and love will I serve Thee, O my
Father, Jehovih!

23\. The Lords retired; and the es'enaurs sang, more than a million of
voices in concert!
