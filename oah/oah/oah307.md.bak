### Chapter XLI

1\. DARKER and darker, the hadan fields palled before the touch of
Jehovih's hand, to try the self-assumed Lord God and his heavenly works.
As if an epoch new and terrible had come to one so audacious, who
foremost in heaven and earth had sought to banish the worship and the
name of the Great Spirit from mortals, and give them instead a heavenly
ruler in the image of man.

2\. For before this, all nations knew the office of Gods and Lords, and
reverenced them as Jehovih's high officers, raised up spirits of the
dead, wise and powerful. But now, in five great divisions of the earth,
satan's hadan chief had bound his name in mortals, with threatened
penalties, and even death, for mentioning Jehovih's name. And, to put
them to the test, made oaths on burning flesh, that whoso would not eat
thereof should die.

3\. For this was the criterion before the courts that they that refused
fish and flesh food, or would not pollute the body by noxious drinks and
smoke, intoxicating to the sense, were possessed of Jehovihian worship,
and so deserved torture and death.

4\. So the names of Lord and God, and Lord God, and De'yus, had now
become for a thousand years fixed in mortals' minds as the Creator, a
large man sitting on a throne in Hored, his heavenly seat, watched and
guarded by his son, Anubi, keeper of the scales, and of the gate to
heaven. To make a plausible story of which, the angels, through oracles,
and magicians, and priests, and prophets, proclaimed that: In the
beginning God created the heavens and the earth, and all things therein
and thereon. And he was tired, and rested; and, as if creation was a
completed work, left certain laws to run the wonderful machine whilst he
sat afar off, looking on; smiling at the pranks of mortals, and their
failure to understand him, with a devil and a horrid fire to torture
their souls, if they sang not in praise of this compounded, false Lord
God.

5\. Thus turned he, their false God, the voice of mortals from Him Who
is Ever Present, whose speech hath every <span id="page_428">p.
428</span> soul heard, Whose Presence moveth all things in heaven and
earth! The false God turned them to sing and pray to himself, so he
should clutch and bind their souls in endless slavery; untaught, half
fed; as drudges, to bring into his capital, provender and building
stones to glorify him forever.

6\. Over Jaffeth, far and wide, this traitor to Jehovih had sealed in
stone, and papyrus, and wood, and sacred cloth, his name, Ho-Joss, to
suit the Panic voice, as whilst in Vind'yu he made them engrave it
Dyaus, to fit the Vedic tongue; and thence in Fonece to suit the
higher-spirited race, Adonia-Egad, and go over to Heleste, and, in less
distince and bastard Greece, whisper Zeus, saying: These words are
watch-words to gain Anubi's ear, and turn the scales for endless
paradise. Go ye, slaves, engrave my names; and, in mortal libraries,
register my great exploit, of how I created the world!

7\. And make me spotless pure, letting sin into the races of men by
Osiris' cunning tale of Eve's weakness by fault of the earth. For I am
not come like Jehovih's captains, spirits sent to rule men for a season,
but a very God of blood and bones, who once, in terrible anger, flooded
the earth to drown my disobedient sons and daughters. Make ye them to
tremble and draw long breath when my name is spoken, or, by mine own
soul, I will hurl heaven and earth into endless chaos!

8\. Pressing downward ji'ay came, slowly and surely, the very motion
spake as a million tongues, serious, awful. For many, on every side, of
the hosts of Anuhasaj were deserting him. As one in a small way may see
on a sinking ship, how the expert swimmers, with strong arms, leap into
the water boldly and swim for the far-off shore, whilst the helpless, in
frantic rage, cluster fast upon the distracted officers, blockading them
from doing good. So began the tumult in the fast descending plateau,
Hored, which was increased a hundred-fold by the flood of drujas cast
upon De'yus' kingdom by his own traitorous false Gods.

9\. De'yus' generals and captains first tried music to hold the forty
thousand millions to peace and order; but the es'enaurs themselves took
fright, and by the million fled, flying down to the earth to Osiris', or
Te-in's, or Sudga's kingdoms, and over-flooding mortals with ghostly
revelries. Next, by parades, and rites, and great processions, did
De'yus' officers seek to divert the panic-stricken millions.

10\. Thus for years this maddened God with wonderful strength of will
almost held his own, inventing tens of thousands of strategems. But at
last, in the downward course, Hored touched upon the corporeal earth;
and suddenly, as if startled by the shock, the frantic millions
screamed, and then, alas, all order died.

11\. The doors of hell were opened! Anuhasaj's throne and capital, with
all their splendor, the maddened mob broke loose to pillage or to
destroy. And then rushed in the fault-finders, shouting: Thou lying God,
but like a man, who art thou? And thou, Anubi! Deceiving judge! A
thousand horrid deaths to thee!

12\. But the unlearned drujas knew not who was rank or officer, God or
judge, but seized the pale and trembling De'yus and Anubi, and more than
a million officers, overpowered them, by ten millions to one, pressed on
by the foul-smelling crowd. And now, with blows and kicks and cuffs, on
every side began the awful fray. Till stretched as wide as the earth,
the countless millions were plunged into hell. Hereupon, to right and
left, was now an unceasing combat, and all the hosts of the Lord God
were sworn for vengeance against any one they came against.

13\. Then came the torturers, casting into the hells most offensive
smells and suffocating gases, crammed in the nose and mouth of their
victims. No more were the Lord God and Anubi seen, but swallowed up in
measureless darkness, where every soul sought nothing good, but labored
hard to give unto others excruciating tortures for vengeance sake.
