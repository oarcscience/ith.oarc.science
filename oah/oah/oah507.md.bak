### Chapter XXIV

OF THE LABOR OF GOD, JEHOVIH'S SON.

1\. SAKAYA was born in Hagotha, province of Nao'wan, on the borders of
Nepal; but because his birth had been foretold by the Faithist prophets,
and that he would re-establish the doctrines of Capilya, the place of
his birth was afterward called Capilya'wahtu.

2\. Sakaya's father's name was Metanga, and he was of the twelfth
generation of Suddhodana (that is, of pure vegetable food). During which
time <span id="page_686">p. 686</span> none of his forefathers ate fish
or flesh, or of anything that breathed the breath of life.

3\. Metanga was very old when Sakaya was born, but the wife of Metanga
was but fifteen years old; for which reason, the people nicknamed the
child, Sramana Gotama, that is, passionless from father and mother.

4\. Metanga was High Father of the province of Nao'wan; consequently,
Sakaya was born a prince, as commanded of Jehovih, in heaven, he should
be. Wherein He said: He that I will raise up, shall have the glory of
the earth before him; and he shall grow up as learned as a king and a
priest, and he shall re-establish peace and good will on earth.

5\. Now there had been bloody times in Vind'yu for four hundred years;
during which time a warring sect, who falsely called themselves
Brahmins, had overrun the land with sword and spear, lance and fire,
destroying temples, oracles and languages.

6\. These were the destructions, previously mentioned, done by the God
Kabalactes, mortals supposing, they were under the God Brahma.

7\. God, Jehovih's Son, had said to Etchessa, chief guardian angel over
Sakaya: Thou shalt cause thy ward to learn Brahminism, asceticism, and
all other religions.

8\. Thus was Sakaya educated; and at twelve years of age, he took vows
of Brahminism.

9\. At fifteen, he desired to acquire the ecstatic state, and he joined
a band of seven Brahmin priests, and went about for three years with the
alms-bowl, begging for the poor, living as the poor, and fasting and
praying, and studying with his teachers and priests.

10\. And, yet for other four years, he excluded himself from speech,
save to the Holy Ghost, dwelling out of doors, night and day.

11\. But Jehovih suffered not the ecstatic state to come to Sakaya. And
one night, his guardian angel, Etchessa, spake to him in a dream,
saying:

12\. Behold, I am Jehovih, and not the Holy Ghost! Why hast thou put Me
off? Did I not create thee alive, and make thee a person also? Thou art
born of the race of Suddhodana. Thy labor is not to seek the ecstatic
state for thyself, which is selfishness, but to renew My light on earth.

13\. Therefore, give up this, thy most useless life of going about
praying, and return thou to thy father's house, and take thee a wife.
For how canst thou attain the wisdom of the earth, without becoming a
husband and father?

14\. Sakaya awoke, remembering his dream, and he told it to his priests,
and asked them to interpret it. And they said unto him: This was not a
dream, but the voice of satan; put thou it aside.

15\. But Sakaya was more convinced of his dream than of his priests; and
he, therefore, gave up his fasting and praying, and returned to his
father's house, saying: Father, thou art wise after the manner of thy
generations. Henceforth I will be no more a priest, nor in fact a
Brahmin, for that matter, but pursue thy doctrines, which are of deeds
more than words. Thou shalt, therefore, choose me a wife, for I will wed
and become a father.

16\. So Sakaya wed, and his wife bore him a son. When he looked upon the
child, he said: Thou art the greatest of sermons.

17\. Now, because of the strange life Sakaya had lived, being a prince,
he was the wonder of the city of Hagotha, and was much loved by the
people, especially the poor, for his alms-bowl had oft relieved them
from hunger.

18\. Consequently, when it was known he was a father, there came before
the royal palace thousands of the poor, singing songs of praise to
Sakaya and his child and his wife. And the poor women had infants in
their arms. When Sakaya saw the infants, he burst into tears, and came
out before the multitude, and spake to them, saying:

19\. This day I have sinned before heaven and earth! Behold my tears!
Would that they were drops of blood, and I could shed them to do you
good! For I have looked upon mine own son, and said within my soul: This
is mine! And I considered how my son was born a prince and above want;
but I considered not this great multitude of babes, who have no
assurance against starvation.

20\. Why, then, shall I remain with one, who hath sure provision, and
glut myself in ease and the selfish joy of my own house? And leave this
multitude of babes to the hazard of precarious life?

21\. Is not Sakaya of broader soul than this? Have I any right to bring
more children into the world, until I have provided sure happiness to
them that are already born? What is my family and my kingdom, though I
win the land from Yaganosa to the ocean, if this burning within mine own
soul will not away, but crieth out forever: Heal thou the sick earth!

<span id="page_687">p. 687</span>

22\. From this time forth do I covenant with Thee, Thou All Light, to
give up all the earth, and to serve Thee! Beasts can bring forth young;
and they do set their hearts on their begotten only! Thy Light moveth me
to a more noble course!

23\. This day I quit the earth and the passions for earthly things; I
will be Thy Son, O Jehovih! And all my days henceforth on the earth,
labor to ameliorate Thy abundant offspring! Behold these young babes
turned upon me, with Thy smile, O Jehovih, in their innocent faces!
calling to me: Help! Help!
