### Chapter XIX

1\. ELOIH, Almighty, Thou, my God, Who hast delivered my people! I will
sing unto Thee a song; and the children of Israel unto Thee, O Eloih!

2\. Thou art a great strength and salvation; unto Thee, Eloih, will I
build my habitation; Thou, my father's God, O Eloih!

3\. Thou art my Warrior; Eloih is Thy name, forever!

4\. Thou has encompassed Pharaoh and his hosts; they are swallowed up in
the sea, his chosen captains and his warriors in the Red Sea.

5\. The depths covered them up; they sank to the bottom as a stone, O
Eloih!

6\. Almighty Eloih: Glorious in power in Thy right hand that passed over
innocent blood!

7\. Thou, my God, Eloih; Wise in majesty, in Thy right hand that dashed
in pieces Thy enemy!

8\. Excellency, O Thou Eloih; in graciousness that came upon them that
rose up in Thy way; Thou sentest Thy breath upon them; as stubble they
were cut down by Thy righteous sword!

9\. By the breath of Thy nostrils, Thou heapedst up the waters of the
sea; and the floods stood upright by Thy voice, to entrap them in the
heart of the sea!

10\. Thine enemy said: I will pursue; I will overtake them; the spoil
shall be mine; I will draw the sword; my hand shall destroy them!

11\. Thou didst blow with Thy wind; the sea covered them; they sank as
lead in the mighty waters.

12\. Who is like unto Thee, Eloih, amongst the Gods? Who is like Thee,
Glorious in Holiness, fearful in praise and wonders, O Eloih! Thou
stretchedst out Thy right hand, and they went down into the earth.

13\. Merciful Almighty, Eloih, my God, and God of my fathers; Who hast
led forth Israel and delivered her into the land of her fathers, O
Eloih! Who hast guided them to a holy habitation and peaceful one.

14\. All people shall hear and be afraid; sober thought shall take hold
on the inhabitants of Palestina. And the nobles of Edom shall be amazed!
The warrior of Moab; trembling shall take hold on them, and the wild men
of Kana'yan shall melt away!

15\. Thou, O Eloih, shalt strike them with fear; in the magnitude of the
strength of Thine arm will they be amazed and helpless as stone. For
this land is Thy purchase, O Eloih; in the passover of the blood of the
lamb purchased Thou it; and Israel shall pass over it in fear.

16\. And Thou shalt bring them to the mountain of their inheritance, to
Thy <span id="page_521b">p. 521b</span> place, Our God, Eloih. To dwell
in Thy sanctuary, which Thou has established for Thy reign, forever and
forever.
