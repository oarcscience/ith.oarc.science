### THE BASIS OF THE EZRA BIBLE

1\. IN the time of Moses, the people of Arabin'ya worshiped many Gods
and Lords, whose high heavenly Captain was Osiris. Four chief Gods were
under him; they were: Baal, Ashtaroth, Dagon and Ashdod. There were
seven and twenty other Gods also, known to mortals.

2\. When the Israelites traveled forth amidst the different tribes, they
were beset to know what Lord or what God they worshiped, and by what
Lord or what God they were led forth.

3\. The Light in wisdom and words came to Moses to say to the nations,
ALAS, HIS NAME, WHOM WE WORSHIP, MAN DARE NOT UTTER.

4\. Within the commune families, were certain signs and pass-words
belonging to the different degrees. There were also oral rules of life
and worship, but these were kept secret from the multitude, but the
instruction of the commune fathers to the families was by this method
made to harmonize all the people.

5\. For general behavior, Moses gave ten commands, which were not only
made public but were incumbent on the commune fathers to teach orally to
their respective families. The following are the commandments thus
taught, that is to say:

6\. I AM THE I AM that brought thee out of Egypt.

7\. Thou shalt have no Gods nor Lords but the I AM.

8\. Thou shalt not make any image of the I AM out of anything that is in
heaven above, or on the earth beneath, or in the waters.

9\. Thou shalt not bow down thyself before idols nor images, nor
anything having the form of anything in heaven, or on the earth, or in
the waters.

10\. Thou shalt not speak My name in public, for I will not hold him
guiltless that giveth it to idolaters and lovers of evil.

11\. Remember the sacred days and keep them holy. Six days shalt thou
labor; but the seventh day is the Sa'abbadha.

12\. Honor thy father and mother.

13\. Thou shalt not kill (any living thing).

14\. Thou shalt not commit adultery.

15\. Thou shalt not steal; nor bear false witness; nor covet anything
that is another's.

16\. In those days it so happened that one Koetha, an Egyptian woman, a
su'is, went into the lodge at noon, no person being within the lodge
save herself. Now, whilst she was examining the remnants of shew-bread
and basins, and the candlestick, a Voice spake to her, saying: TOUCH NOT
THESE, THEY ARE SACRED. But the woman, knowing it was a spirit, said: If
I tell what I have heard, I will be accursed; for was it not the
multitude of seeresses that brought the plagues on Egypt?

17\. Again the Voice spake, saying: I will give thee the signs and
pass-words of the High Fathers, that they may also know that thou
knowest. Now, thereupon the Spirit told her the secrets; and he likewise
said: Say thou to Moses, THE I AM SAITH (and Moses will wonder at thy
speech): Behold, these implements are sacred. Hide thou them by day, for
they who have spirit perception, perceiving them, will obtain the signs
and pass-words.

18\. The woman, Koetha, did as commanded, and Moses commanded workmen to
make a tabernacle (a model or image of a place of worship, a portable
temple), and the sacred implements were kept within said tabernacle, and
this was the corporeal base of the ark of Bon, a locality in the
etherean heaven, by which the light of the sacred heaven reached the
earth to Moses and his people, in a pillar of cloud by day and of light
by night.

19\. The secret ceremonies commanded vegetable diet for fathers,
prophets, seers, and wanonas (trance subjects), and many of Koetha's
people followed their example. After some years of experience, those who
fasted from flesh murmured, saying: What have we gained for our
sacrifice?

20\. So they broke their fasts by hundreds and by thousands; and there
came by their camps numberless birds, and they caught and killed and ate
them freely; but, being unaccustomed to such diet, they were taken with
fever and died, upward of sixty thousand of them, men, women and
children, and the place was called Kibrath-Hattaavah, the place of
lusters.

21\. In the year 3269 B.K., the Israelites began to marry with the
Canaanites, who were under the control of Baal.

22\. Ashtaroth, whose dominions extended jointly with Baal over Western
and Southern Arabin'ya, sent spirit emissaries to the handsomest of the
women of Canaan, and by impression led them into the camps of the
Israelites, to tempt the young men, for by these means did the heathen
Gods determine to destroy the worshipers of the GREAT UNSEEN. And many
of the Israelitish young men were tempted by the beauty of the heathen
women and thus took them for wives; and said wives brought with them
their own familiar spirits, who were slaves to Baal and Ashtaroth.

23\. The ark of Bon immediately sent Jerub, an etherean angel, into the
Israelites' camp, giving him two thousand inspiring spirits to
counteract the labors of Baal and Ashtaroth.

24\. Nevertheless, it so came to pass that when the half-breed children
were grown up, having Canaan mothers, they began to murmur against the
peace policy of the Israelites, saying: As other people have kings and
emperors, why not we? As other people raise up soldiers, declare war,
and go forth possessing themselves of lands and cattle, why do not we?

25\. For three hundred and ninety-seven years after going out of Egypt,
the Israelites lived without a corporeal king, or other government, save
the community of fathers; and they attained to the number of six
millions of souls, men, women and children.

26\. But in the three hundred and ninety-seventh year, the Gods Baal and
Ashtaroth triumphed, through their familiar spirits, and caused the
Israelites to anoint a king to rule over them. This king was called
Saul, signifying OF THE LORD GOD. Prior to this the Israelites
acknowledged no God nor Lord, but covenanted with the Great Spirit,
E-O-Ih. The name had been kept secret with the fathers, and the
commandments were announced from the Great Spirit, I AM.

27\. The familiar spirits now inspired Saul to change the words of the
commandments to the LORD THY GOD, as a conciliatory strategem to please
the nations and tribes of people who worshiped Baal, Dagon, Ashtaroth,
Haughak, and other Gods and Lords of the lower heavens.

28\. Thus was substituted Lord God (Land God) for Jehovih (called
sacredly, E-O-Ih), and as the Great Spirit had been heretofore taught to
the Israelites as an inconceivable entity, WHOSE FORM AND EXTENT no man
could attain to know, so was He now transformed and declared to be in
the form of a man, and having a residence in the firmament of heaven.
Thus they made the Great Spirit merely an idol; thus they began the
overthrow of the holy doctrines of Moses.

29\. Jerub, the etherean angel in command, sought to preserve the old
tenets, and amongst mortals sought out one, Samuel, and inspired him to
establish a college of prophets, and this was done at Naioth, and hither
congregated the inspired; and they established a crescent Tablet, and
made prophecies from etherea for a period of seventy years.

30\. Hereupon the Israelites were twain, those of the king and those of
E-O-Ih, the prophets, and these placed them at a disadvantage before
neighboring tribes and nations. Having sacrificed the name of the Great
Spirit, and made him into a man figure, the heathen said: What better is
their Lord God than our Lord or our God? and they made war against the
Israelites on all sides; and the latter having stooped to a corporeal
king, went further on and raised armies of soldiers and went to war.

31\. In the four hundred and ninth year after the departure out of
Egypt, the entire PEACE POLICY and NON-RESISTANCE of the Mosaical
Inspiration was overthrown, and the Israelites became warriors, and even
warred against one another.

32\. The Israelites not only worshiped the imaginary idol, Lord God in
heaven, but built representatives of Him in stone and wood, and
worshiped them also.

33\. And now, one Ahijah, a young man from the college of prophets,
foretold the coming captivity of the Israelites as a consequence of
their idolatry.

34\. In the year 2768 B.K., a young man, Elijah, was raised up from the
branch of the college of prophets, and, under the inspiration of the
angel Jerub, went forth preaching amongst the heathen, preaching not the
Lord God, but Jehovih.

35\. Ahab, a king, a worshiper of Baal, said to Elijah: What better is
one God than another, or more powerful? Are not all Gods but the spirits
of men raised up in heaven?

36\. Elijah answered him, saying: I preach neither Lord nor God, but
Jehovih, the Creator, who is Ever Present and Potent over all things.

<span id="page_643">p. 643</span>

37\. Ahab said: Then thy Master hath neither eyes nor ears, knowing
nothing, like the wind. He is foolish, and without intelligent answer to
thy prayers.

38\. Elijah said: Summon thou thy priests, and thy high priests, who
have power through Baal and Ashtaroth and Dagon, and they and their Gods
shall try in a tournament against Jehovih.

39\. Ahab caused the tournament to take place, and when the priests and
high priests of Baal had spread the sacrifice they repeated their
invocations for a miracle to prove the power of Baal and the other Gods;
but lo and behold, Jerub, the etherean angel, with ten thousand spirits
to assist him, prevented any sign or miracle being accomplished by the
familiar spirits of Baal and Ashtaroth.

40\. And now Elijah stretched forth his hand unto Jehovih, saying: If it
be Thy will, O Father, give these people a sign of Thy Power!

41\. And Jerub and his etherean host of angels, caused a flame of fire
to descend on the altar and consume the sacrifice. The people feared,
and many fell down, exclaiming, Jehovih is mighty! Jehovih is mighty!

42\. When the tournament was ended, Elijah went upon Mount Carmel, and
prayed for rain, and Jerub, with ten thousand times ten thousand angels,
brought the winds from the north and south and east and west, and the
moisture in the air above was converted into rain, and thus the long
drouth was ended.

43\. In the year 2635 B.K., the college of prophecy raised up Jonah, and
Amos, and Hosea.

44\. In the year 2574 B.K., the kingdoms of Israel perished, and they
became a scattered people, and fell into bondage again.

45\. 2439 years before kosmon, Manasseth, son of Hezekiah, established
idol worship, and, by law, abolished the worship of Jehovih. He caused
the prophet Isaah to be sawn in twain; and the judgment was, because he
worshiped Jehovih.

46\. For three hundred years following, the only Faithists amongst the
Israelites were the prophets, and the followers of the prophets, who had
never affiliated with those of the kingdoms and armies.

47\. The Faithists proper were a small minority, and scattered in many
lands. The rest, who were called Jews, lived under written laws and
ceremonies, which were compiled and established by Ezra, in Jerusalem,
which combination of books was called the Bible, and was completed in
the year 2344 B.K.

48\. From that time forward, the Jews became worshipers of THE LORD AND
THE GOD, but the scattered tribes of the Faithists still held to the
Great Spirit, Jehovih, keeping their service secret. These latter were
without sin, doing no war nor resistance of evil against evil, but
returning good for evil, and loving one another as one's self.

49\. From the Faithist branch sprang the Asenean (Essenean, or Es'eans)
Association, cultivating prophecy and purity of spirit. For further
light, read of Pharaoh in the lower heavens, and the migration of the
East Indian Gods westward, in another part of Oahspe.

50\. The angels of Jehovih now dwelt with the Aseneans, who were the
true Israelites in fact. Though many of the Jews also professed Jehovih
under the name of God and Lord God.

51\. In three hundred and fifty years after this Jehovih raised up from
the Aseneans, one Joshu, an iesu, in Nazareth. Joshu re-established
Jehovih, and restored many of the lost rites and ceremonies.

52\. In the thirty-sixth year of Joshu's age he was stoned to death in
Jerusalem by the Jews that worshiped the heathen Gods.

53\. Forty years after Joshu's death, a false God, Looeamong, with
millions of angel emissaries, obsessed the inhabitants of all those
countries and plunged them into war and anarchy.

54\. The Faithists were scattered to the four ends of the earth.

55\. Jehovih said: Never more shall My chosen have kings. I alone am
King.

56\. And so it is to this day.

57\. Looeamong, the false God, now changed his name and falsely called
himself Christ, which is the Ahamic word for knowledge. And he raised up
tribes of mortal warriors, who called themselves Christians, who are
warriors to this day.

58\. The doctrine of these warriors was, that knowledge, which implieth
general education, was the best preventative against crime and misery.
Neither understood any man in those days that the word Christ had any
reference to a man or person. Now, from the time of Moses to Ezra, there
was an interval of four hundred years, in which the Jews had no written
record.

59\. The age of the Ezra Bible is not, therefore, from the time of
Moses, but from the time of Ezra, 2344 years B.K.
