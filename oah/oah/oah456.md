### FUR.

1\. WHERE are Thy singers, Jehovih? Who have beholden the vastness of
the Creator! And the times and the splendor of Thy universe.

2\. And the adoration that slumbereth but for a season, and then
bursteth like a world on fire! Whom Thou appointest from time to time to
sing of Thee.

3\. Sing unto the Almighty. He spandeth the times of millions of years
as if but a day, in the fashion and splendor of His works.

4\. He openeth His heavens as a book is opened. The prophet of the
Creator readeth of the magnitude of the works of Jehovih!
