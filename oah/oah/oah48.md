### Chapter V

1\. GOD said: Blessed is the surgeon's knife; its burn is the capital of
health regained; but yet a fool will cry out: Hold! hold! enough! thou
inflicter of pain!

2\. Who hath an eye like Jehovih? His whipping-posts are on all sides,
but there is a clear road between them. Yet man followeth it not.

3\. Withdraw all good men and good angels, and there is no person left;
they would not be half made up. A man without an arm or a leg is but
part of a man; a man without perception of the All Person is a deformity
in soul. He seeketh a home for his own ease and glory; but the Son of
Jehovih seeketh to find the severest labor that will profit his
brethren.

4\. Yeshuah shall be my homestead; hither will I bring the fruit of
heaven below; hither build my training schools. Seven years shall be my
service; and they shall learn the ways of etherea. Build me a house of
brotherhood and fill it with willing pupils sworn to labor. I will make
them Gods and Lords with power and wisdom.

5\. Behold a man maketh a factory and turneth out fabric for sale. I
make a college and I turn out sons and daughters of Jehovih, to give
away. Bring me such material as will stand in warp and filling;
Jehovih's fabric shall endure forever. Search me out the seed of I'hin,
and house them with care, for they shall redeem the earth-born after I
ascend to the Father's kingdom.
