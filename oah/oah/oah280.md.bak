### Chapter XIV

1\. IN course of time, word came to Ahura, in Vara-pishanaha, of the
proceedings of the Lord God, now styled De'yus, and of the revolt of all
the lowest heavens in one fell swoop. And Ahura remembered his own
shortcomings, thousands of years ago, and the terrible bondage that came
upon him in the end. And he knew De'yus, who had been a sub-God under
him hundreds of years, under the name <span id="page_385">p. 385</span>
Anuhasaj, who had tried to break the lines in the arc of Spe-ta, in the
resurrection of Ailkin.

2\. So Ahura prayed to Jehovih, before the Holy Council in
Vara-pishanaha, to know what he should say or do in the matter, or if
nothing at all. Jehovih answered him, saying:

3\. My Son, thou art no longer a child. Address thou the Lord God, or
not address him, as seemeth fit in thine own eyes. Behold, I suffered
thee to try the same road, that thou mightst understand Me and My
kingdoms.

4\. Thereupon Ahura determined to send word to De'yus, in his own name,
and in his own way. Then, then, is what he sent, to wit:

5\. To Anuhasaj, my one-time sub-God, greeting to thee in justice and
wisdom. Wert thou inexperienced I would treat thee with respect. But
thou knowest thou art false. And because thou art false, thou shalt reap
in falsehood.

6\. Behold, the day shall come when thy Gods will desert thee; for such
is the tree thou hast planted in thy kingdoms. This rule holdeth on
earth and in all the heavens. Can that which is unborn, restrain its own
birth? Or that which is not quickened into life, restrain the Creator's
hand?

7\. So also is it of him that soweth for self; he shall reap a harvest
of selfs. And thy Gods will be for themselves, and thy marshals, and all
thy hosts; every one pulling in an opposite way.

8\. Not suddenly will these things come upon thee; for thou shalt have a
mighty kingdom and great honor and glory, such as no other God before
thee hath had in these heavens. And thy people shall be jealous to serve
thee, striving with all their might to outdo one another in worshipful
obedience to thee. And thy name, even the names De'yus and Lord God,
shall stand for a season the highest on the earth of all names that have
ever been.

9\. And yet the time shall come that thy names shall be cast out of
earth and heaven. Even the deeds that thou shalt do shall be the means
of making thy names execrable.

10\. Think not, O my Lord God, that thou wilt deal righteously, and keep
thyself holy. Behold, I, too, was a revolted God that sat up a kingdom
for mine own glory. And, in the time of the beginning thereof, I was
most resulute to practice righteousness in all things.

11\. But the surroundings overcame me; for as I was allied to self, so
selfish officers under me beset me on all occasions, and I was forced to
find new places and new glories for them, or, by their grumbling, they
would sow my fields with mutiny. I was powerless in the great kingdom I
built up. Thou knowest the result.

12\. Thinkest thou the larger thy kingdom, the greater will be thy power
to avert thy fall? My experience was the opposite of this.

13\. I admonish thee in wisdom and justice; I know thou art doing these
things not for the raising up of the fruit of the earth, but for thine
own aggrandizement and glory. And I say unto thee, the time will surely
come when thy Gods will do the same things against thee. And in that
time the wise and learned and truthful will fly from thee, but the
drujas and slaves will not leave thee; but thou shalt be environed with
them, and cast into hell.

14\. Thou shalt heap misery upon millions of thy subjects, but thou
shalt not escape the hand of justice: Thou shalt reimburse them every
one. Thou hast cast thy net in shoal water; thine own feet shall be
tangled in the meshes thereof.

15\. Behold, I, too, once craved a great heavenly kingdom; now I weep
day and night because I have it. And thou, too, shalt experience the
time of scalding tears, to be rid of that which thou cravest even now.

16\. Yet, how else shall the dumb be raised in heaven? Who else shall
minister to the wandering spirits that overspread the earth? And the
evil drujas? And the lusters, and foul-smelling? Shall I say to thee: Go
on, thou self-presuming Lord God, the Great Spirit hath a rod in pickle
for thee!

17\. Yea, He answereth the ambition of men and Gods sooner or later; in
a way they think not of, He bringeth them up with a round turn.

18\. Thou art like a man desirous of great bulk, that shutteth up the
pores of the skin of his flesh; thou seekest to shut up the course of
the heavens that riseth out of the earth, upward forever. And as the one
choketh up with a foul smell, and dieth, so shall it be with thy
kingdom. Behold, the way of everlasting light is outward; onward, away
from the corporeal world; but the way of darkness is toward the earth.

19\. Sayest thou the spirits of the dead shall not rise away from the
earth? And, in their ignorance of the higher heavens, become guides to
mortals!

20\. Behold, thou hast traveled far; and thou struttest about, saying:
It is enough; I, the Lord God, have traveled <span id="page_386">p.
386</span> in the far-off heavens; stay ye at home, and work for me
forever, that I may be glorified!

21\. Wilt thou say: I, the Lord God,I, De'yus, am the only Son of the
Void! Behold, by kingdom lieth in a little corner! Come and worship me,
the Lord God, and ye shall see me on my throne!

22\. Or wilt thou say: The impersonal space, senselessness, by accident
fructified itself in corporeal substance, and became me, the Lord God,
in size of a full-grown man, and then I created all the creations!
Wherefore let men and angels fall down and worship the man, De'yus, who
dwelleth in Hored, a ripple in the lowest heavens!

23\. I profess not love to thee, Anuhasaj, but justice toward them
beneath thee. For thou shalt hoodwink mortals, and even angels of little
experience, to believe thou wert the very Creator; but thy Gods know
thee as to who thou art, and the Gods above thee know also. All thy days
at most have been but two thousand and seven hundred years! And the time
shall come upon thee that thou shalt be forced by thine own fault to
assert thou wert the very Creator, whose worlds have run thousands of
millions of years! Who can carry so great a falsehood as this! And not
carrying it, it shall fall down on thee and on thy people, and take root
and spread abroad till thy place and thy Gods' places are the foundation
of nothing but lies.

24\. For the rule holdeth in all places, high and low, that according to
the seed sown so shall be the harvest, whether good or bad. Nor can any
man or God alter this rule, or bend it to the right or left.

25\. If it be Jehovih's decree that some one shall make the name of God,
and Lord God, and De'yus, execrable on earth and in heaven, it may be
well that thou hast put thyself into the yoke to that end. Yet I would
not have thee so, could I prevent it.

26\. Thou wert one time my sub-God, and I remember thee well; thou wert
young and full of promise. My judgment spake to me of thee, saying: A
sub-God, to be proud of for thousands of years! But my judgment was not
Jehovih's. My love for thee was early nipped in the bud. For thou wert
forever talking of thyself. Thou madest thy neighbor Gods sick by
forever relating thy experiences and thy prophecies as to what thou
wouldst do.

27\. And when Jehovih encompassed me about in mine own evil, thou didst
tantalize me because I had not followed thy advice. Now I repeat unto
thee, I could not follow any one's advice. And thou, too, shalt be
environed about, and be unable to follow any one's advice. For such is
the bondage of the Godhead, save we cut ourselves loose, making Jehovih
the Head and Front, and ourselves His servants. For the God should not
only be the greatest in his kingdom, but the most menial servant of his
people; forever throwing off responsibility, and forever urging his
subjects not to idolize him, but Jehovih! Forever showing them that
their God is nothing more than themselves; that they must stand alone,
and become, not slaves to their God, but independent beings full of
manliness, having faith in the Great Spirit only.

28\. By which the God bindeth not himself nor his people; giving full
sway to the love of liberty in every soul, but in tenderness and love
that harmonize with Jehovih's proceedings.

29\. Now when thou camest back to me, after I was delivered out of hell,
and my kingdoms raised to Vara-pishanaha, thou didst profess to
understand these things, and of a truth, to love this philosophy. And
thou didst pray fervently to Jehovih, repenting of thy former ways,
taking part in the rites and ceremonies.

30\. Then I opened my heart to thee. My much love for thee, as when I
first knew thee, returned upon me a thousand fold. In joy and in tears I
fell upon thee, and I praised Jehovih that He had sent me so sweet a
love.

31\. In each other's arms we repented, and we swore our mutual love
forever. Then we both saw the way of Jehovih clear, and He made us
strong and wise, full of rejoicing.

32\. And we fell to, hand in hand, laboring with drujas, dark and most
foul, teaching them day and night, forever repeating to their stupid
minds. And when we were both well nigh exhausted thousands of times, and
we slacked up, and withdrew for a short spell, we rested in each other's
arms!

33\. Then we reasoned and philosophised on the plans and glories of
Jehovih's works; hopefully watching signs of progress in our wards. O
the glory of those days! O the richness of thy wisdom and love to me in
those days of darkness! For a hundred years we toiled thus, and I was
blessed, and my people were blessed by thee, thou star of our love.

34\. When we raised them up, my wards, four thousand millions, were
lifted a small way up out of darkness, and our far-off Goddess, Atcheni,
needed one who was great, like unto <span id="page_387">p. 387</span>
thee, to travel in other regions. And I parted with thee. My soul was as
if divided in twain.

35\. For hundreds of years thou traveledst and became rich in knowledge;
but not to return to me, to my bursting heart! What more can I say? Thou
art in my place, and I am in mine; but Jehovih is with Wisdom, Love,
Truth and Fidelity, for these are his abiding places.
