### Chapter XXX

1\. ON the following evening, when the Zarathustrians were assembled for
prayer and singing, the soul of Zarathustra again appeared before them
in sar'gis, teaching the Word of Ormazd. He said:

2\. Two people there are on the earth: the one is engrossed in the
affairs of the earth; the other in the affairs of heaven. Better is it
for ye to be of the latter. The fool will say: If all people are
engrossed with the affairs of heaven, then who will provide on the
earth? Such is the argument of all druks. Fear not, therefore, for the
earth people becoming short of votaries.

3\. So also will it be said of celibacy. The druks will say: If all
people become celibates, then will the race of man terminate. Wherefore,
I say again unto you, fear not, for there will be plenty left who are
full of passion, and are unmindful of the kingdoms of heaven.

4\. Let all who can, live for the Higher Light; the lower will ever be
supplied sufficiently.

5\. Even as ye find two peoples on earth, so also do two peoples exist
in heaven. The one followeth the Highest Light, and ever riseth toward
the highest heavens. The other followeth the affairs of earth, and
riseth not, and hence is called druj. The latter engageth in sensualism,
and quarrels amongst mortals, inspiring them to evil and low desires.

6\. One present asked: How shall we know one another, whether we be of
heaven or of earth? Then Zarathustra answered, saying: Seek to know
thyself; thou art not thy neighbor's keeper. Search thine own soul a
<span id="page_250b">p. 250b</span> hundred times every day, to know if
thou practicest the All Highest according to thine own light. Neither
shalt thou find excuses for thy shortness; nor reflect overmuch on past
errors, but use them as inspiration to perfect thyself henceforth.

7\. Another one present asked: How of thieves, and falsifiers, and
murderers? Zarathustra said: The man who serveth himself only is worse
than any of these; there is no resurrection in him. But if a man cease
his evil way, and practice virtue, he is on the right road.

8\. A falsifier is like one with a clean gown on, that goeth about
casting filth upon it; he soileth his own spirit.

9\. A thief is worse than an overburdened beast; he carrieth his stolen
goods not only in this world, but in heaven, to the end of his memory.

10\. A murderer is like a naked man, who is ashamed, and cannot hide
from the multitude. When he is in heaven, his memory of the deed writeth
in human blood a stain on his soul, which all others see.

11\. Another one asked: According to the I'hua'Mazdian law, the highest,
best men forsake the world, laboring to raise up the poor and ignorant,
reciting prayers and anthems; taking no part in the affairs of people
who are engrossed in the matters of earth; who, then, shall be the
government of the wicked? To which Zarathustra answered, saying:

12\. When there are not sufficient men and women for such purpose, there
will be no wicked to govern. With all thy preaching, that the highest
life is celibacy, there will be plenty left who will marry; with all thy
preaching that the highest, best man will not be a leader of men, nor a
king, nor a governor, yet there will be plenty left who will fill these
places, even though they beheld the walls of hell opened up to receive
them.

13\. Another one asked: If the Zarathustrians separate, and live by
themselves, what will be their power to do good amongst the evil? To
which Zarathustra said:

14\. As the highest heavens send Lords and masters down to mortals, so
shall the Zarathustrians send emissaries amongst the wicked, preaching
the truth, and citing the example of the Zarathustrian cities
(communities).

<span id="page_251b">p. 251b</span>

15\. For above all philosophy that man may preach, practice holdeth the
highest place, and is most potent. See to it, therefore, that ye
practice the Ormazdian law toward one another in all things. Avoid men
of opinion; men of learning; who have pride therein; men of argument;
men who quibble for proofs in unprovable things; men who wish to be
known as wise men; men who deny; men that can see defects in everything,
and have nothing good to offer in place thereof.

16\. Shun the disbelieving man, for he is diseased, and may inoculate
thee; the flatterer, for he is purchasing thee; a woman, for woman's
sake; or a man, for man's sake; company, for company's sake; for all
these imply that the Creator is less in thy sight, and not so well
loved.

17\. One asked concerning spirits. To which Zarathustra said: For the
affairs of earth, consult the spirits of the earth, the drujas; for the
affairs of everlasting resurrection, consult thy Creator, and His holy
spirits will answer thee in His name. And to whichever thou hast made
thyself companion, there will be thy abiding place after death.

18\. See to it that thou becomest not inveigled by drujas, for spirits
can assume any name and form; but weigh their words, whether they be
wise, and according to the Ormazdian law. If they teach not the higher
heavens, but profess a long life in the lower heavens, consider them by
their words. To flatter thee, they will profess to remember thee in
another life; and to please thee, say thou wert a king, and hath had
many successions of lives on the earth.

19\. But of what value under the sun is such philosophy? But to rise up,
away from the earth, and from the lower heavens also; it was for
bestowing this word unto men that I was sent into the world. It is to
teach you to know the Father's upper heavens, and the way to reach them,
that His words were given unto men.

20\. As it was in the olden time, so will it be again ere another
generation pass away. Drujas will teach that the spirits of the dead go
into trees and flowers, and inhabit them; and into swine, and cattle,
and birds, and into woman, and are born over again in mortal form. Argue
not with them; their philosophy concerneth not thee. Whether they be in
darkness or in light, judge thou by the glory and <span
id="page_252b">p. 252b</span> beauty of the heavens where they live. If
their words are of the earth, they belong to the earth; if they are
servants to false Gods or false Lords, they will preach him whom they
serve. But these matters are nothing to thee; for thou shalt serve the
All Highest, the Creator. In this no man can err.

21\. And in regard to the heaven, whither thou wouldst desire to ascend
after death, magnify it with all thy ingenuity unto the All Highest
Perfection. People it with thy highest ideals for thy companions. Then
see to it that thou makest thyself a fit companion for them also. If
thou do this with all thy wisdom and strength all the days of thy life,
the Father will be with thee, and thou shalt be a glory in His works.

22\. Thus preached Zarathustra after his resurrection from death; for
three days and three nights preached he before his disciples; and Asha
wrote down the substance of his words, and they were preserved unto the
generations of Faithists from that time forth. And the words were called
the Zarathustrian law, the I'hua'Mazdian law, the Ormazdian law. And
they were the first heavenly words given on tablets and skins and cloth,
and in books, to mortals, save what words were given in secret to the
tribes of I'hins, of which the different nations of the earth knew
nothing of their own knowledge as to what they were.

23\. On the morning of the fourth day, when the disciples sat in
crescent, which was called the living altar of God, Zarathustra again
came in sar'gis. He said: Behold, the time hath come for me to rise out
of hada, where I have dwelt for three days.

24\. The Gods who were with me all my earth life are gathered together
even here, and there are millions of them. Just near the river yonder
standeth the boundary line of a heavenly ship of light! It is wider than
the eye can see, and higher than the eye can see! A million of angels
are singing in that ship! And there are great Gods and great Lords in
it. So bright, mine eyes dare not look on them. They are all Sons and
Daughters of the Great Spirit.

25\. The drujas are all run away now. Their foolish gabble is hushed,
gone! It is as if another world came alongside, so majestic that this
one was lost. Above, high, very high, yonder! Something like a sun
illumes the ship of fire! I know it is He Who hath come for me. I go
now! Whither I go I will build for you all.

26\. And thou, O Asha! The Gods have thrown a mantle of light over thee!
A chain reacheth from thee to Ormazd! Asha was overcome, and fain would
have gone to the spirit, Zarathustra. The latter said: Stand thou, and I
may kiss thee! So, Zarathustra kissed Asha, and departed.

END OF BOOK OF GOD'S WORD.
