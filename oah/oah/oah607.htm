<P>1. I am One Spirit, saith Jehovih.</P>
<P>2. My quickening power is upon all the living; because of this, they live and move.</P>
<P>3. According to the different structure of the living, so is My inspiration manifested by them.</P>
<P>4. One, as the hare, runneth away in cowardice; another, as a lion, is ferocious; another, without judgment, as the serpent.</P>
<P>5. And as to man: One is inspired to music; another to mathematics; another to seership, and so on.</P>
<P>6. To all of these I am the One, the Universal Inspirer that moveth all of them.</P>
<P>7. According to their organic structure, so do they manifest My inspiration.</P>
<P>8. The lowest of living creatures made I the serpent, for I gave to him an element capable of destroying himself.</P>
<P>9. When the earth was encircled with poisonous gases, I created poisonous vines and weeds and trees and all kinds of herbs, rich-growing upon the earth.</P>
<P>10. Thus, from destroying gases and from earth-substance created I the vegetable world. And, in that day, all growing things upon the earth which I had created were poison as to animal life.</P>

<P>11. Then, I created the serpents; of all sizes created I them. And they were poison also.</P>
<P>12. And the serpents I created were carniverous, feeding upon one another. Self-impregnating created I them.</P>
<P>13. Thus drove I the poison of the air down into vegetation, and thence into the animal world; thus I purified the air of heaven.</P>
<P>14. This was the first creation I created on this world.</P>
<P>15. Then I overcast the earth with falling nebulae, and covered up the poisons growing upon the earth, and they were turned to oil and coal.</P>
<P>16. Then, I made a new creation; giving feet and legs and bones to the animals I designed for the earth.</P>
<P>17. And when the earth was ripe for man, then I created him; male and female created I those of the second creation.</P>
<P>18. And man was dumb, like other animals; without speech and without understanding, even less than any other creature which I had created.</P>
<P>19. Nevertheless, I had given to man, and thus made him, out of the dissolved elements of every living thing that had preceded him.</P>
<P>20. And man partook of the first and the second creations. After the manner of every animal on the earth, so created I man; with all the characteristics of all of them, so created I him, male and female created I them.</P>
<P>21. And man was unconscious of his creation, not knowing whence he came; nor knew he which was his own species.</P>
<P>22. And I sent angels to man, to teach him who he was, and to rouse him up to his capabilities, for which I created him.</P>
<P>23. And my angels drew, from man's side, substance, and thus took on corporeal forms; and the angels dwelt with man as helpmates, to make man understand.</P>
