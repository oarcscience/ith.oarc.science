### Chapter V

1\. IN the transposition of needles of corpor from parallel polarity to
mixed or transverse positions, are produced all kinds of colors. It is
an error to say: Wave of light, or bent ray of light, or that a given
number of vibrations or undulations produce different kinds of colors;
there is neither wave nor undulation in fact. Needles are arbitrary and
can not be bent. Compare a needle to a transparent glass crystal. Place
a given number of these end to end, touching, and in a line: To bend
this line is impossible, save at angles, for where every two ends join
there will be an angle: Be the needles ever so short there will be no
bend in fact, but a succession of arbitrary lines and elbows.

2\. Such is not, however, the juxtaposition, save when they are in a
line direct; otherwise the ends of the needles do not bend like joints,
but each one turneth more or less on its own axis. If they all turn, an
APPARENT wave is produced, expressive of a certain color; if part of
them turn, another color is produced. In proportion to this disturbance,
so are the APPARENT vibrations slow or fast, as to mortal observation.

3\. In regions of the earth's atmosphere where they have cyclones,
reddish lights appear in the firmament, even before the cyclone
manifesteth on the earth. And these lights travel with the cyclone,
manifesting great heat on the earth. In the regions of monsoons, a
similar manifestation occurreth, but generally with pink or bluish
lights instead of red, if over the ocean; but if over the land, a smoky
atmosphere resulteth.

4\. These colors, and all others, manifested in atmospherea, are not
confined to the earth stratum, but they extend even to the outer extreme
of the earth's vortex. And in many instances they are so altitudinous
that their manifestations are imperceptible to mortal observation, save
that, for example, the moon or the sun shineth less brightly. When one
of the transpositions is dark and is high up in the atmosphere at night,
they say the moon is surrounded by a haze. And yet, the while, the
atmospheric stratum next the earth may be clear.

5\. The earth's vortex hath millions of these strata, and of various
colors, shades and tints. In taking photographs of the moon or the sun,
these often interpose, and the picture taken deceiveth the observer,
that he hath made a picture of the oxygen or hydrogen of the planet's
atmosphere.

6\. The same state of affairs belongeth also in the sun's vortex; so
that, with these clouds of color intervening in etherea, the telescope
encountereth much travail.

7\. As a vortex groweth older, these disturbances, together with
imperfect solutions of corpor, become less frequent. So also in the
early age of a vortex they are more frequent and of longer duration. So
that, at times, a red light, or blue light, or other color, will
overspread the earth for periods of a thousand or more years without
interruption. And in some cases, darkness for as long a period. Whatever
living thing, as herbs and trees, grasses and so on, were quickened into
life <span id="page_581">p. 581</span> during darkness, were without
eyes. Nevertheless, in this day, even these things turn toward the
light; as plants and flowers placed in a window will manifest.

8\. Where se'mu was quickened into life in lighter times, it focalized
toward the light, and this focus was called an eye. And such as were
thus quickened into life, and not attached to the earth by fibres or
roots, were called animals. And the LIFE they inherited gave power unto
them, to go about from place to place. So great are the powers of the
eyes of some animals that they can see and distinguish in the darkest of
nights. Such eyes are absorbents of vortexya, and they shine in the
dark.

9\. Hence the first organs of sense created in any animal were the eyes;
whereof it hath been said, the eye is the seed of the tree of knowledge.
The sight of the eye is the beginning of self-creation, in acquiring
knowledge; and it doeth by going forth and staying at home at the same
time. The sight of the eye is a miniature sun, sending forth and
receiving vortexian power at the same time. As may be proved by looking
on the eyelids of a person sleeping, who will awake because thereof.

10\. Since, then, the eye of man can go forth with intelligent power,
controlling things, it hath been concluded since thousands of years, by
the wisest philosophers, that an All Seeing Eye is the Cause and Creator
of the whole universe, which is His Person.

11\. In the first quickening of eyes, they partook of the color of the
vortexian lights at that time; and even so at the same period of time
were colored the skins of mortals, and according to their surroundings,
some light, some dark, and some red, or yellow, or copper-colored.

12\. And all of them propogated after their own kind, and do so to this
day. And though the blacks might live for thousands of generations with
themselves only, in any country in the world, they would never become
whites. And the same rule applieth to whites and browns, and all the
races of man.

13\. But because they can mix, and because that mixture can propogate,
all the races of man are one and the same in all their organs and
capabilities. Now, as previously stated, white things manufacture a
white atmosphere around them; whilst black things do not (being
negative). The white give off, or radiate light and power; the black are
not radiants. The white man's radiating power recoileth upon himself,
and he suffereth with heat. So also with the white bear. The black man
and black bear are the reverse.

14\. Wherefrom this rule will now be plain to the student: When a planet
hath attained to so great age she no longer giveth forth light or heat
to radiate upon herself, she can not be seen in the heavens. Of which
kinds of planets there are millions in the etherean firmament. Some of
these move slower than any of the planets man can see. Some of these at
times eclipse the sun, and are taken for sun-spots, although, perhaps,
not a million miles from the earth.

15\. Like unto these, in darkness, are there plateaux of nebula floating
in the firmament, which also produce eclipses of the sun and of the
moon. For convenience, let such planets and nebula be called dead
planets and dead nebula. And that there are millions of such bodies,
sufficient to eclipse the sun, or a star, or the moon, the different
periods of darkness on the earth will prove. (See notes at end of Book
of Ben.)

16\. In prophesying the tendency of a planet's approach to death, refer
once more to the moon: Now the moon hath, as to the earth's face, no
axial revolution. But it must be remembered the moon can not go around
the earth without making an actual axial revolution. Seventy and
one-half revolutions of the moon's vortex complete one travel around the
earth's vortex. Consequently we arrive at the exact speed of the moon's
vortexya and the strength of light and heat manifested on the moon. The
student should make allowance for the moon's ellipse, for the light of
the moon is much stronger (as seen from the earth) some times than
others.

17\. Place the se'muan age at ninety-nine degrees, the time of
quickening animal life. It will be found that the moon at such period
must have had an axial motion, facing the earth, of three and
four-sevenths' times faster than the earth. Whilst at the same period of
time the earth made its daily revolution in what would now be twenty-one
hours and forty minutes. This would give a difference in animal heat of
two and a half degrees of vortexya on the earth, as compared to the
se'muan age. Consequently large animals, which are now extinct, had a
temperature (average) higher of two and a half degrees than at present.
Wherein we perceive three hours and seventeen minutes' loss in axial
motion produced a loss of two and a half degrees of vortexian heat.

<span id="page_582">p. 582</span>

18\. The difference, therefore, on the moon, in temperature below
blood-heat and what it now must be, must correspond exactly with its
comparative slowness (one revolution a month), as to the loss manifested
on the earth. Now, although the student will discover the moon hath
fallen to a temperature far below zero, yet it emitteth both light and
heat.

19\. To find the se'muan age (especially of man), place his temperature
at ninety-eight (for good health), and one hundred and two at
inflammation or death. Four below normal will, therefore, be the period
of man's inhabitation of the earth. After the vortexian radiation
reacheth this period, man will cease to propogate, and, so, become
extinct as to the earth.

20\. This giveth man eight degrees of vortexya as the sum of his
existence. One degree is equivalent to twelve million seven hundred and
sixty thousand radi c'vorkum. The serpent's coil would be one and
one-fourth. That is, twenty-four thousand years to the time of
completion. Thus, 12,760,000 divided by 260,000 add 1,402 1-2 add 24,000
x 3 = 76,750 years, the time of the se'muan age for man. To this should
be added one cycle, of, say, three thousand years, which was the
beginning of the fall of se'mu.

21\. By reversing these measurements, find the axial decrease of the
earth in seventy-eight thousand years, which will be just one hundred
minutes, or 3-340ths of a second annually, which is the earth's decline
in speed. For which reason the first of the race of man on earth began
about seventy-eight thousand years B.K.
