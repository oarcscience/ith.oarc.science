# Oahspe Index

Oahspe is a book written in 1880 by an American dentist named John
Ballou Newbrough \[1828-1891\]. He claimed that it was the result of
automatic writing, dictated to him by spirits in a trance. In this
trance he wrote the entire book on a very early typewriter (possibly the
first such book ever written on a machine!). The spirits were very
profilic; Oahspe is about four-fifths the size of the King James Bible,
and more than twice the size of the Book of Mormon. Other texts archived
at Intangible Textual Heritage authored via automatic writing during the
19th century include [the Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the
Christ](../chr/agjc/index.md), and [Clothed with the
Sun](../wmn/cws/index.md).

Oahspe appeared in the context of the Spiritualist movement, the
Victorian predecessor of the "New Age" channelling and past life
regressions. It has similarities to [Theosophy](../the/sd/index.md), and,
strangely enough, to the rumored science-fiction Scientology mythology
(which, of course, has no relationship whatsoever to Oahspe or its
adherents). Oahspe inspired a radically different set of spiritual
beliefs, called *Faithism* which has a small following even today. The
Faithists do not consider Oahspe the literal truth; instead they find
inspiration in its many ethical and spiritual passages.
