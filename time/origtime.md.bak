# Origin of Major Religions

This table indicates the approximate date each of the twelve major world
religions began, along with the traditional dates for the birth and
death of its founder (if applicable). You can click on each religions'
link to start reading about it.

This list of twelve world religions is, of course, an
oversimplification. Also, keep in mind that there are religions (such as
the belief systems of Native American and Australian Aborigine peoples)
that go back much further than Hinduism, and there have been several
large religions that have started since Baha'i.

The 'Common Era' refers to 1 A.D. CE=Common Era, BCE=Before Common Era
