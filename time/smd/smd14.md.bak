### CHAPTER XII

### December--The Tenth Month

The chief festival of this "tenth" and last month of the Roman year was
the Saturnalia, held on the seventeenth of the month in honour of
Saturn, the father of Jupiter. Saturn, or Cronos, as the Greeks called
him, was one of the Titans, the six giant sons of Uranus (Heaven) and
Gaia (Earth). Uranus ruled before the days of Man, but he was overthrown
by his son Saturn, who became for a time the supreme ruler of the
universe. Uranus, however, prophesied that Saturn would one day himself
be overthrown by his children, and in order to avoid this, Saturn, when
his first child was born, immediately swallowed him! As other children
were born, he swallowed each of them until at last Rhea, his wife,
succeeded in hiding her youngest son, Jupiter, and deceived Saturn by
giving him a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes, which, in his haste, he
swallowed without realizing the trick played upon him. Jupiter was thus
saved, and when he grew up he overthrew his father, as Uranus had
foretold. Saturn, having lost his power, took refuge on the Earth, and
became king of a part of Italy, which, as Virgil tells us in the eighth
book of his Aeneid, he called Latium, since it was there that he lay hid
(Latin: lateo= to lie hidden). "Saturn was the first to come from
heavenly Olympus, fleeing the arms of Jupiter, an exile deprived of his
kingdom. He it was who made into a nation a people untaught and
scattered on the mountain tops, and gave them laws, and chose that the
land should be called 'Latium' because in safety he had lain hidden in
this region."

Jupiter's rule was very soon threatened by the Titans, who refused to
bow to his will, but after a long and terrible struggle, the giants were
overthrown by Jupiter's thunderbolts. One of the giants was imprisoned
under Mount Aetna, where, breathing out fire and smoke, he still
struggles to free himself, thus causing earthquakes and volcanic
eruptions.

Another of the Titans, Iapetus, had two sons, Prometheus (Forethought)
and Epimetheus (Afterthought). To these two gods fell the task of making
man, who was to rule over all living creatures. Prometheus was very
anxious to give to the race of men that he had fashioned a power that
would make them supreme on the earth, and nearer to the gods themselves.
The way in which he could best bestow this power upon them was by the
gift of fire, for fire belonged only to the gods and was jealously
guarded by them. In spite of the terrible punishment which he knew
awaited him should he be discovered, Prometheus determined to steal fire
from heaven, and during one dark night he brought down to the earth a
burning stick from the home of the gods on Mount Olympus. Jupiter,
seeing an unaccustomed light on the earth, discovered the theft, and his
rage knew no bounds. He seized Prometheus, carried him off to the
Caucasus Mountains, and there bound him with chains to a huge rock. Then
he sent a vulture that, day after day, might feed upon his liver, which
grew again during the night so that the terrible torture of the god
should have no end. After hundreds of years of this ghastly pain and
suffering, Prometheus was rescued by Hercules, who came to him to ask
him where he might find the Golden Apples of the Hesperides. Hercules
killed the vulture, broke Prometheus' chains, and released the tortured
god, who in return advised Hercules to go to the giant Atlas, who knew
where the apples were, as we have seen in the story of Atlas' daughter,
Maia.

Prometheus' brother, Epimetheus, married the beautiful Pandora, and at
first lived with her in great happiness, for in those early days the
earth was free from pain, sickness, and ills of every kind. One evening
they saw Mercury, the messenger of the gods, coming towards them and
bearing on his shoulder a huge box which seemed to be of great weight.
Tired out with his burden, Mercury begged permission to leave the box to
their care, promising to return for it in a short time. Pandora and
Epimetheus readily granted permission, and Mercury placed the box in
their house and hastily departed. Pandora was at once filled with great
curiosity as to what the box might contain, and suggested to Epimetheus
that, they should just peep inside. Epimetheus was shocked by Pandora's
lack of good manners, and, replying that they must not think of such a
thing, he went out, calling to Pandora to follow him. But Pandora's
curiosity was now thoroughly aroused, and the temptation overcame her
when she found herself alone. Quickly she undid the cord which bound the
box, and, thinking she beard sounds in the box, she put her ear close to
the lid. To her surprise she heard voices calling, "Let us out! let us
out!" Pandora, filled with excitement, slowly raised the lid a little,
just for a peep, as she said to herself. But no sooner was the box
opened than out flew little winged creatures, some of which settled on
Pandora and Epimetheus, who had now returned, and stung them so that
they knew pain for the first time. Then escaping into the world, these
insects, Evil, Sickness, Unhappiness, and all the little troubles of
life, became a cause of endless pain and suffering to men and women.
Poor Pandora was broken hearted, and her eyes filled with tears at the
thought of the harm she had done. Then again she was startled to hear a
voice still calling from the box. It sounded so kind and gentle and
pleaded so sweetly to be let out, that Pandora raised the lid a second
time, and out flew Hope, who had been shut in with the cruel insects,
and now fluttered busily over the earth, healing the wounds made by her
evil companions.

This cheery little creature, Hope, may well be associated with the
winter month December, when Ceres and her trees and flowers mourn for
the smiling Persephone, yet cling to the hope of her return. It is Hope
who bids us say with the poet, "If Winter comes, can Spring be far
behind?"

On December 25th, the Romans held a festival of the winter solstice, the
turning point of winter, when the days begin to grow longer. It was
called Dies Natalis Solis Invicti (the Birthday of the Unconquered Sun),
and it is very probable that for this reason the Christians chose the
25th of December for the birthday of Christ. In early times Christmas
(the Mass or Feast of Christ) was kept at different times in the year,
but it was finally fixed on December 25th, since on that day there was
already held this heathen festival to the sun, which had a meaning in
some way similar to that of our Christmas. It was an easy thing to make
the Birthday of the Unconquered Sun, which wakes all nature from its
winter sleep, into the Birthday of the Unconquered Son of God, who
brought new life and hope to the world.

The same thing took place among the northern races of Europe and in our
own islands. The first Christian missionaries found that, at the time of
year we now call Christmas, the Northmen kept a festival called Yule,
the greatest feast in the year. "Yule" means "wheel", and the festival
was so named because the sun was thought to be like a wheel revolving
swiftly across the sky. It used at one time to be a custom in England
and Germany for the people to gather each year on a hill-top, to set
fire to a huge wooden wheel bound with straw, and to send it rolling
down the hill. The Christians made this festival into a Christian
festival, and we still speak of Christmas as Yuletide. The origin of
Santa Claus is St. Nicholas, who was the patron saint of Russia. He was
famous for his kindness and generosity, and a festival was held in his
honour on the 6th of December.

The custom of giving "Christmas boxes" comes from the Romans, and in
later days these gifts came to be called "boxes", because at Christmas
time boxes were hung up in the churches in which people might put money,
for the poor. On the day after Christmas Day these boxes were opened,
and the day was thus known as "Boxing Day". Another custom which comes
from the Romans is that of having a Christmas tree hung with toys--a
custom which dates back to the Saturnalia. Virgil, in his book called
The Georgics, describes how the farmers, when holding a festival in
honour of Bacchus, God of Wine, "hang from the tall pine tiny waving
masks" of the god.

December also had two names among the Angles and Saxons: "Wintermonath",
and "Heligmonath", that is, "holy month", from the fact that Christmas
falls in this month.
