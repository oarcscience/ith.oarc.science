### CHAPTER I

### January--The Month of Janus

The first month was called Januarius by the Romans, after Janus, the god
of doors and gates. We see the same word in janua, the Latin for a gate
or opening. From the idea that a door is a way in, an entrance, it
became a custom among the Romans to pray to Janus whenever they
undertook a new work. He was also the god of the beginning of the day,
and it was only natural that when a new month was added at the beginning
of the year it should be named after him. During this month offerings to
the god were made of meal, frankincense, and wine, each of which had to
be quite new.

Since a gate opens both ways, Janus was thought to be able to see back
into the past, and forward into the future, and he was usually
represented in pictures as having a double head that looked both ways.
On the earliest Roman coins he is drawn with two bearded faces, with a
staff in one hand, and a key in the other, He was also the protector of
trade and shipping, and on some coins his head is shown with the prow of
a ship. When people wished to picture him as the god of the year, they
drew him holding the number 300 in one hand, and 65 in the other.

Janus was worshiped on the Janiculum (Hill of Janus), one of the seven
hills on which Rome was built. Since he was the God of Gates, all the
gates of Rome were under his care, especially the archway through which
the army marched to war, and by which it returned. This archway was
afterwards replaced by a temple which was called Janus Quadrifrons--that
is, four-sided--because it was square. On each side of the building
there were three windows and one door, making twelve windows and four
doors, which represented the twelve months and the four seasons. In
times of war the temple gates were kept wide open since people were
continually making offerings to the god, but whenever there came a time
of peace, the gates were at once closed. As we know the Romans were
continually fighting, it does not surprise us to find that the gates of
the temple were closed only three times in seven hundred years.

Janus was said to be the son of Apollo, the God of the Sun, whose daily
task it was to drive across the sky in his chariot of fire. Each morning
when Aurora, the Goddess of the Dawn, had opened the gates of the East,
Apollo set forth, and when, his task accomplished, he reached the
Western Ocean, he returned to his palace in the East.

"And the gilded car of day  
His glowing axle doth allay  
In the steep Atlantic stream:  
And the slope sun his upward beam  
Shoots against the dusky pole,  
Pacing toward the other goal  
Of his chamber in the East."  
    MILTON--Comus.

Apollo had another son, named Phaeton, who one day persuaded his father
to allow him to drive the sun chariot. All went well for a time, and
then Phaeton, being a reckless boy, began to drive too fast. He soon
lost control of the horses, which plunged madly along and bore the
chariot far from its track. It went so close to the earth that the
fields were scorched, the rivers were dried up, and even the people were
turned black--and they are black to this day! The cries of the terrified
people attracted the attention of Jupiter, the king of the gods, who
became enraged when he caught sight of the daring boy in the chariot of
the sun. Taking up one of his thunderbolts, he hurled it at Phaeton,
who, scorched by its fire, fell headlong to the earth.

Another sad story told of Apollo is that of his friendship with a youth
named Hyacinthus, to talk with whom Apollo used often to come down to
the earth. Zephyrus, the God of the South Wind, was very fond of
Hyacinthus too, and one day as Apollo and Hyacinthus were playing a game
of quoits, Zephyrus came by. Filled with jealousy at the sight of Apollo
and his friend, he blew Apollo's quoit aside so that it struck
Hyacinthus and killed him. Apollo was greatly distressed at his friend's
death, and in order that he might never be forgotten, changed the fallen
blood-drops into clusters of flowers, which we still call Hyacinths.

"For so Apollo, with unweeting hand,  
Whilom did slay his dearly loved mate,  
Young Hyacinth born on Enrotas' strand,  
Young Hyacinth the pride of Spartanland,  
But then transformed him to a purple flower."  
        MILTON.

Another flower which should always remind us of Apollo is the sunflower.
A story says that there once lived a girl named Clytie, and that each
day, with eyes full of love for the fair sun god, she watched him
journey across the sky: but Apollo, knowing nothing of her love, took no
heed of her as he passed. Clytie watched for him day after day on a
river bank, and her heart sank as each evening she saw his chariot dip
down into the West. She would not leave the river bank, but stayed all
through the cold night, anxiously waiting for the first flash of the
sun's rays from the glowing East. At last the gods took pity on her, and
changed her into a sunflower. Her green dress became green leaves, and
her golden hair became yellow petals. Now was she happy indeed, for she
knew that she could always see Apollo, and you will find that to this
day the sunflower turns its head towards the sun as it moves across the
sky.

Aurora, the Goddess of the Dawn, whom we have mentioned as opening the
gates of the East for the sun god Apollo, married a mortal, Tithonus, a
prince of Troy. In order that their happiness might know no end, Aurora
begged Jupiter to grant Tithonus immortality. The wish was granted, but
in her anxiety that Tithonus should never be taken from her by death,
Aurora forgot to ask also for the gift of eternal youth. As the years
went on Tithonus grew old and weak and became only a burden to her. At
length, tired of his shrill voice and constant complaints, she turned
him into a grasshopper, whose shrill complaining note is known to all.

The name for this month among the Angles and Saxons was Wulfmonath (Wolf
month), since it was the time of year when the wolves were unable to
find food, and their hunger made them bold enough to come into the
villages.
