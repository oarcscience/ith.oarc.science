### CAROL

WHEN the herds were watching  
In the midnight chill,  
Came a spotless lambkin  
From the heavenly hill.

Snow was on the mountains,  
And the wind was cold,  
When from God's own garden  
Dropped a rose of gold.

When 'twas bitter winter,  
Houseless and forlorn  
In a star-lit stable  
Christ the Babe was born.

Welcome, heavenly lambkin,  
Welcome, golden rose;  
Alleluia, Baby  
In the swaddling clothes!

--WILLIAM CANTON
