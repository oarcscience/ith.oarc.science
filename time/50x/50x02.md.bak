### OLD CAROL

HE came all so still  
Where His mother was,  
As dew in April  
That falleth on the grass.

He came all so still  
To His mother's bower,  
As dew in April  
That falleth on the flower.

He came all so still  
Where His mother lay,  
As dew in April  
That falleth on the spray.

Mother and maiden  
Was never none but she;  
Well may such a lady  
God's mother be.
