### A CHRISTMAS CAROL

BEFORE the paling of the stars,  
Before the winter morn,  
Before the earliest cock-crow,  
Jesus Christ was born:  
Born in a stable,  
Cradled in a manger,  
In the world His Hands had made  
Born a stranger.

Priest and King lay fast asleep  
In Jerusalem,  
Young and old lay fast asleep  
In crowded Bethlehem:  
Saint and angel, ox and ass,  
Kept a watch together  
Before the Christmas daybreak  
In the winter weather.

Jesus on His mother's breast  
In the stable cold,  
Spotless Lamb of God was He,  
Shepherd of the Fold:  
Let us kneel with Mary Maid,  
With Joseph bent and hoary,  
With saint and angel, ox and ass,  
To hail the King of Glory.

--CHRISTINA ROSSETTI
