### TO HIS SAVIOUR, A CHILD; A PRESENT BY A CHILD

GO pretty child, and bear this flower  
Unto thy little Saviour;  
And tell Him, by that bud now blown,  
He is the Rose of Sharon known:  
When thou hast said so, stick it there  
Upon his bib, or stomacher:  
And tell Him, (for good handsell too)  
That thou hast bought a whistle new,  
Made of a clean straight oaten reed,  
To charm His cries, (at time of need:)  
Tell Him, for coral, thou hast none;  
But if thou hadst, He should have one;  
But poor thou art, and known to be  
Even as moneyless as He.  
Lastly, if thou canst win a kiss  
From those mellifluous lips of His;  
Then never take a second on  
To spoil the first impression.

--ROBERT HERRICK
