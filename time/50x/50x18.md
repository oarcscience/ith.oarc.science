### A SONG FOR THE SEASON

THE Kings to the Stable  
They brought sweet spice,  
The gold and the silver,  
And jewels of price.  
But the Dove by the manger  
She would not cease  
Mourning so softly:  
Bring Him Peace; bring Him Peace!  
The Kings from the Orient  
Brought nard and clove.  
The Dove went mourning:  
Bring Him Love; Bring Him Love.  
What would content Him  
In silver and gold,--  
A new-born Baby  
But one hour old?  
Not myrrh shall please Him  
Nor the ambergris,  
What hath sweet savour  
Of His mother's kiss?  
There is clash of battle,  
And men hate and slay:  
From the noise and the tumult  
She hides Him away.  
But His sleep is fitful  
In His Mother's breast,  
The Dove goes mourning:  
Give Him rest; give Him rest!

--KATHARINE TYNAN
