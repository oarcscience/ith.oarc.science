### THREE CHRISTMAS SONGS

#### I. THE GUESTS

WHY is there such a dancing din  
About the stable of the inn?  
"An old man, winter white, is here  
A wayfarer he doth appear."

"If this be all, why is the night  
Lit up with this unearthly light?"  
"A maid, the fairest maid, is here,  
Some great Lady she doth appear."

"But even so, why do there fly  
Such flocks of Angels from the sky?"  
"A Babe, a most sweet flower, is here,  
A Child from Heaven He doth appear."

#### II. COCKADOODLEDOO!

COCKADOODLEDOO!  
Our Lady's lost her shoe,  
St. Joseph's lost his lantern,  
What will they do?  
The Child will be both Shoes and Staff  
And a Lantern too.  
In the dark night He'll be their Light.  
And their Guide so true  
Cockadoodledoo!

They that slept for sorrow  
Wake on a glad morrow,  
Their goal won,  
Their travel done,  
Their trouble thro'--  
How cunning is His little laugh  
His eyes how blue!  
Cockadoodledoo!  
The sun is high in Egypt's sky,  
Cockadoodledoo!

#### III. A CHILDERMAS RHYME

BABES in the wood  
Babes in the tower,  
Babes killed at Childermas  
In an evil hour,  
Babe safe in Egypt  
From the tyrant's power,

Wicked uncles, wicked kings,  
Robbers counting chains and rings,  
Wicked kings who killed for greed,  
A good thief who stole for need,  
Herod gone and Crookback sped,  
The old villainous uncle dead,  
When the Babe is crowned a King  
That good thief will find his meed  
In a green place where robins sing,  
Where the holy babes and meek  
In the wood play hide-and-seek.

--R. L. GALES
