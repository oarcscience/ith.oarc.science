*Fifty Christmas Poems for Children*, by Florence B. Hyett, \[1923\], at

### NOEL

#### I

ON a winter's night long time ago  
(The bells ring loud and the bells ring low),  
When high howled wind, and down fell snow  
(Carillon, Carilla).  
Saint Joseph he and Nostre Dame,  
Riding on an ass, full weary came  
From Nazareth into Bethlehem.  
And the small child Jesus smile on you.

#### II

And Bethlehem inn they stood before  
(The bells ring less and the bells ring more),  
The landlord bade them begone from his door  
(Carillon, Carilla).  
"Poor folk" (says he), "must lie where they may,  
For the Duke of Jewry comes this way,  
With all his train on Christmas Day."  
And the small child Jesus smile on you.

#### III

Poor folk that may my carol hear  
(The bells ring single and the bells ring clear),  
See! God's one child had hardest cheer!  
(Carillon, Carilla).  
Men grown hard on a Christmas morn;  
The dumb beast by and a babe forlorn.  
It was very, very cold when our Lord was born.  
And the small child Jesus smile on you.

#### IV

Now these were Jews as Jews must be  
(The bells ring merry and the bells ring free).  
But Christian men in a band are we  
Carillon, Carilla).  
Empty we go, and ill be-dight,  
Singing Noel on a winter's night.  
Give up to sup by the warm firelight,  
And the small child Jesus smile on you.
