### A CHRISTMAS CAROL

THAT sweeter music can we bring  
Than a carol, for to sing  
The birth of this our heavenly King?  
Awake the voice; awake the string!  
Heart, ear, and eye, and everything!

Why does the chilling winter's morn  
Smile, like a field beset with corn?  
Or smell, like to a mead new-shorn,  
Thus, on the sudden?

Come and see  
The cause, why things thus fragrant be.  
'Tis He is born, whose quickening birth  
Gives light and lustre, public mirth,  
To heaven, and the under-earth.

The darling of the world is come,  
And fit it is we find a room  
To welcome Him. The nobler part  
Of all the house here, is the heart,  
Which we will give Him; and bequeath  
This holly, and this ivy wreath,  
To do Him honour; who's our King,  
And Lord of all this revelling.

--ROBERT HERRICK
