### WHEN CHRIST WAS BORN

WHEN Christ was born of Mary free,  
In Bethlehem in that fair citie,  
Angels sang there with mirth and glee,  
In Excelsis Gloria!

Herdsmen beheld these angels bright,  
To them appearing with great light,  
Who said, "God's Son is born this night,"  
In Excelsis Gloria!

This King is come to save mankind,  
As in Scripture truths we find,  
Therefore this song have we in mind,  
In Excelsis Gloria!

Then, dear Lord, for Thy great grace,  
Grant us the bliss to see Thy face,  
That we may sing to Thy solace,  
In Excelsis Gloria!
