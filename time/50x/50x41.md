### AN ODE TO THE BIRTH OF OUR SAVIOUR

IN numbers, and but these few,  
I sing Thy birth, O Jesu!  
Thou pretty baby, born here,  
With sup'rabundant scorn here;  
Who for Thy princely port here,  
Hadst for Thy place  
Of birth a base  
Out-stable for Thy court here.

Instead of neat enclosures  
Of interwoven osiers,  
Instead of fragrant posies  
Of daffodils and roses,  
Thy cradle, Kingly Stranger,  
As Gospel tells,  
Was nothing else  
But here a homely manger.

The Jews they did disdain Thee,  
But we will entertain Thee,  
With glories to await here,  
Upon Thy princely state here;  
And more for love than pity,  
From year to year,  
We'll make Thee, here,  
A free-born of our city.

--ROBERT HERRICK
