### I SAW THREE SHIPS

I SAW three ships come sailing in,  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;  
I saw three ships come sailing in  
On Christmas Day in the morning.

And who was in those ships all three,  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day?  
And who was in those ships all three,  
On Christmas Day in the morning?

Our Saviour Christ and his ladye,  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;  
Our Saviour Christ and his ladye,  
On Christmas Day in the morning.

Pray whither sailed those ships all three,  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day?  
Pray whither sailed those ships all three,  
On Christmas Day in the morning?

O they sailed into Bethlehem,  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;  
O they sailed into Bethlehem,  
On Christmas Day in the morning.

And all the bells on Earth shall ring,  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;  
And all the bells on Earth shall ring,  
On Christmas Day in the morning.

And all the angels in Heaven shall sing,  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;  
And all the angels in Heaven shall sing,  
On Christmas Day in the morning.

And all the souls on Earth shall sing,  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;  
And all the souls on Earth shall sing,  
On Christmas Day in the morning.

--OLD CAROL
