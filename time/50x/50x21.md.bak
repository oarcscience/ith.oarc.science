*Fifty Christmas Poems for Children*, by Florence B. Hyett, \[1923\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### BETHLEHEM

WHERE man was all too marred with sin,  
The ass, the ox were bidden in.

Where angels were unmeet to come  
These humble entered Holydom.

"Their innocent eyes and full of awe  
Saw the fulfilment of the law.

There in the stable with the beast  
The Christmas Child hath spread His feast.

These gave their bed and eke their board  
To be a cradle for their Lord.

Their honey-breath, their tears all mild,  
Warmed in the cold the new-born Child.

These His adorers were before  
The Kings and Shepherds thronged the door.

And where no angels knelt there kneeled  
The innocent creatures of the field.

O simple ones, much honoured;  
He who oppresses you indeed

Oppresses His kind hosts that lay  
Once in the stable on the bay.

--KATHARINE TYNAN
