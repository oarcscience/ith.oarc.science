### SONG

WHY do the bells of Christmas ring?  
Why do little children sing?

Once a lovely shining star,  
Seen by shepherds from afar,  
Gently moved until its light  
Made a manger's cradle bright.

There a darling baby lay,  
Pillowed soft upon the hay;  
And its mother sung and smiled:  
"This is Christ, the holy Child!"

Therefore bells for Christmas ring,  
Therefore little children sing.
