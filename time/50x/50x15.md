### A CHRISTMAS PRAYER

LOVING looks the large-eyed cow,  
Loving stares the long-eared ass  
At Heaven's glory in the grass!  
Child, with added human birth  
Come to bring the child of earth  
Glad repentance, tearful mirth,  
And a seat beside the hearth  
At the Father's knee--  
Make us peaceful as thy cow;  
Make us patient as thine ass;  
Make us quiet as thou art now;  
Make us strong as thou wilt be.  
Make us always know and see  
We are his, as well as thou.

--GEORGE MACDONALD
