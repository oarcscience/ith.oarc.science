### CHRISTMAS EVE

IN Christmas Eve the little stars  
Sparkle and glisten with delight,  
Like strings of glitt'ring diamonds,  
Across the darkness of the night.

On Christmas Eve the little stars  
Dance in their places in the sky;  
Ah! I would go and trip with them  
If I could only climb as high.

On Christmas Eve the little stars  
Sing merry carols all night long;  
But O! I am so far away  
I cannot even hear their song.

On Christmas Eve the little stars  
Sparkle, and dance, and sing till dawn;  
And I am singing too, because  
'Tomorrow will be Christmas Morn.

--CHARLOTTE DRUITT COLE
