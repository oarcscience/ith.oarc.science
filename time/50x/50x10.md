### SHEPHERD'S SONG

AS I rode out this enderes' night,  
Of three jolly shepherds I saw a sight  
And all about their fold a star shone bright;  
They sang, Terli, terlow;  
So merrily the shepherds their pipes can blow.

Down from heaven, from heaven so high,  
Of angels there came a great company.  
With mirth, and joy, and great solemnity  
They sang, Terli, terlow;  
So merrily the shepherds their pipes can blow.

--OLD SONG
