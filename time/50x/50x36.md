### YULE-TIDE FIRES

CLEANSE with the burning log of oak  
The canker of thy care,  
Deck with the scarlet-berried bough  
The temple of the fair;  
Spread pure-white linen for a feast,  
Perchance some guest may share.

Give forth thy gold and silver coins,  
For they were lent to thee;  
Put out to usury thy dross,  
One talent gaineth three.  
Perchance the hungered and the poor  
May pray to God for thee.

Once a pale star rose in the East  
For watching herds to see,  
And weakness came to Bethlehem,  
And strength to Galilee.  
Perchance! if thou dost keep thy tryst  
A star may rise for thee.
