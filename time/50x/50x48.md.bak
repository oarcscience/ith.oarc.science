### VERSES FROM THE HYMN ON THE MORNING OF CHRIST'S NATIVITY

BUT peaceful was the night  
Wherein the Prince of light  
His reign of peace upon the earth began:  
The winds, with wonder whist,  
Smoothly the waters kist  
Whispering new joys to the mild ocean,  
Who now hath quite forgot to rave,  
While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave.

The shepherds on the lawn,  
Or ere the point of dawn,  
Sat simply chatting in a rustic row;  
Full little thought they than,  
That the mighty Pan  
Was kindly come to live with them below:  
Perhaps their loves, or else their sheep,  
Was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep.

When such music sweet  
Their hearts and ears did greet,  
As never was by mortal finger strook,  
Divinely-warbled voice  
Answering the stringed noise,  
As all their souls in blissful rapture took;  
The air such pleasure loth to lose,  
With thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close.

Ring out, ye crystal spheres,  
Once bless our human ears,  
(If ye have power to touch our senses so)  
And let your silver chime  
Move in melodious time;  
And let the bass of Heaven's deep organ blow,  
And with your ninefold harmony  
Make up full consort to the angelic symphony.

For if such holy song  
Enwrap our fancy long,  
Time will run back and fetch the age of gold,  
And speckled Vanity  
Will sicken soon and die,  
And leprous Sin will melt from earthly mould,  
And Hell itself will pass away,  
And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day.

But see! the Virgin blest,  
Hath laid her Babe to rest,  
Time is our tedious song should here have ending,  
Heaven's youngest teemed star,  
Hath fix'd her polish'd car,  
Her sleeping Lord with hand-maid lamp attending:  
And all about the courtly stable,  
Bright-harness'd Angels sit in order serviceable.

--JOHN MILTON
