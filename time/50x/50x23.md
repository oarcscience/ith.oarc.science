### BEHOLD A SILLY TENDER BABE

BEHOLD a silly tender Babe,  
In freezing winter night,  
In homely manger trembling lies  
Alas! a piteous sight.

The inns are full, no man will yield  
This little Pilgrim bed;  
But forced He is with silly beasts  
In crib to shroud His head.

Despise Him not for lying there,  
First what He is inquire;  
An orient pearl is often found  
In depth of dirty mire.

Weigh not His crib, His wooden dish,  
Nor beasts that by Him feed;  
Weigh not His mother's poor attire,  
Nor Joseph's simple weed.

This stable is a prince's court,  
This crib His chair of state;  
The beasts are parcel of His pomp,  
The wooden dish His plate.

With joy approach, O Christian Wight!  
Do homage to thy King;  
And highly praise this humble pomp  
Which He from heaven doth bring.

--ROBERT SOUTHWELL
