### CRADLE HYMN

AWAY in a manger, no crib for a bed,  
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.  
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay--  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,  
But little Lord Jesus no crying He makes.  
I love Thee, Lord Jesus! look down from the sky,  
And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay  
Close by me for ever and love me, I pray;  
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care,  
And fit us for Heaven, to live with Thee there.

--MARTIN LUTHER
