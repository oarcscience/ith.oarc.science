<p>WE saw Thee in Thy balmy nest,<br> Young dawn of our eternal day;<br> We saw Thine eyes break from the East<br> And chase the trembling shades away:<br> We saw Thee, and we blest the sight,<br> We saw Thee by Thine own sweet light.</p>  
<p>Poor world, said I, what wilt thou do<br> To entertain this starry stranger?<br> Is this the best thou canst bestow--<br> A cold and not too cleanly manger?<br> Contend, the powers of heaven and earth,<br> To fit a bed for this huge birth.</p>  
<p>I saw the curl'd drops, soft and slow,<br> Come hovering o'er the place's head,<br> Off'ring their whitest sheets of snow.<br> To furnish the fair infant's bed.<br> Forbear, said I, be not too bold;<br> Your fleece is white, but 'tis too cold.</p>  
<p>To Thee, meek Majesty, soft King<br> Of simple graces and sweet loves!<br> Each of us his lamb will bring,<br> Each his pair of silver doves!<br> At last, in fire of Thy fair eyes,<br> Ourselves become our own best sacrifice.</p>  
<p>--RICHARD CRAWSHAW</p>
