### CHRISTMAS

A BOY was Born at Bethlehem  
that knew the haunts of Galilee.  
He wandered on Mount Lebanon,  
and learned to love each forest tree.

But I was born at Marlborough,  
and love the homely faces there;  
and for all other men besides  
'tis little love I have to spare.

I should not mind to die for them,  
my own dear downs, my comrades true.  
But that great heart of Bethlehem,  
he died for men he never knew.

And yet, I think, at Golgotha,  
as Jesus' eyes were closed in death,  
they saw with love most passionate  
the village street at Nazareth.

--E. HILTON YOUNG
