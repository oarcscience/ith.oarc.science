### A CRADLE HYMN

HUSH! my dear, lie still and slumber,  
Holy angels guard thy bed!  
Heavenly blessings without number  
Gently falling on thy head.

How much better thou'rt attended  
Than the Son of God could be,  
When from heaven He descended  
And became a child like thee!

Soft and easy is thy cradle:  
Coarse and hard thy Saviour lay,  
When His birthplace was a stable  
And His softest bed was hay.

See the kinder shepherds round Him,  
Telling wonders from the sky!  
Where they sought Him, there they found Him,  
With His Virgin Mother by.

See the lovely babe adressing;  
Lovely infant, how He smiled!  
When He wept, the Mother's blessing  
Soothed and hush'd the holy child.

Lo, He slumbers in His manger,  
Where the horned oxen fed:  
Peace, my darling; here's no danger,  
Here's no ox anear thy bed.

--ISAAC WATTS
