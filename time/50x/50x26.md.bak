### A SONG OF CHRISTMAS

THE Christmas moon shines clear and right;  
There were poor travellers such a night  
Had neither fire nor candle-light.

One plucked them stars out of the sky  
To show the road to travel by;  
So that the Ass go warily.

She had all Heaven safe in her hold,  
Hidden within her mantle's fold--  
All Heaven, and It was one hour old.

Her hair under, over Him spread  
His spun-gold coverlet and His bed,  
Twined with His little golden head.

She sang and rocked Him to-and-fro  
Such songs as little babies know,  
With Lullaby Sweet, and Lullalo.

He had no need of moons and suns,  
Nor the gold-crested bird-legions,  
Singing their lauds and orisons.

The Christmas moon shows a cold beam;  
He hath His Mother, she hath Him:  
Together they sleep, together dream.

--KATHARINE TYNAN
