### THE BIRDS

WHEN Jesus Christ was four years old,  
The angels brought Him toys of gold,  
Which no man ever had bought or sold.

And yet with these He would not play,  
He made Him small fowl out of clay,  
And blessed them till they flew away:  
Tu Creasti Domine.

Jesus Christ, Thou child so wise,  
Bless mine hands and fill mine eyes,  
And bring my soul to Paradise.

--HILAIRE BELLOC
