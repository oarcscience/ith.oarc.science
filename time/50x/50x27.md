### THE HOLLY AND THE IVY

THE holly and the ivy,  
Now are both well grown.  
Of all the trees that are in the wood  
The holly bears the crown.

The holly bears a blossom  
As white as the lily flower,  
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ  
To be our sweet Saviour.

The holly bears a berry  
As red as any blood,  
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ  
To do poor sinners good.

The holly bears a prickle  
As sharp as any thorn,  
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ  
On Christmas Day in the morn.

The holly bears a bark  
As bitter as any gall,  
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ  
For to redeem us all.

The holly and the ivy  
Now are both well grown,  
Of all the trees that are in the wood  
The holly bears the crown.
