*Fifty Christmas Poems for Children*, by Florence B. Hyett, \[1923\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### UNTO US A SON IS GIVEN

GIVEN, not lent,  
And not withdrawn--once sent--  
This Infant of mankind, this One,  
Is still the little welcome Son.

New every year,  
New-born and newly dear,  
He comes with tidings and a song,  
The ages long, the ages long.

Even as the cold  
Keen winter grows not old,  
As childhood is so fresh, foreseen,  
And spring in the familiar green.

Sudden as sweet  
Come the expected feet;  
All joy is young, and new all art,  
And He, too, whom we have by heart.

--ALICE MEYNELL
