## ST. STEPHEN'S, ST. JOHN'S, AND HOLY INNOCENTS’ DAYS

> Horse Customs of St. Stephen's Day﻿—The Swedish St. Stephen﻿—St.
> John's Wine﻿—Childermas and its Beatings.

The three saints’ days immediately following Christmas﻿—St. Stephen's
(December 26), St. John the Evangelist's (December 27), and the Holy
Innocents’ (December 28)﻿—have still various folk-customs associated
with them, in some cases purely secular, in others hallowed by the
Church.

### <span class="smcap">St. Stephen's Day.</span>

In Tyrolese churches early in the morning of St. Stephen's Day there
takes place a consecration of water and of salt brought by the people.
The water is used by the peasants to sprinkle food, barns, and fields in
order to avert the influence of witches and evil spirits, and bread
soaked in it is given to the cattle when they are driven out to pasture
on Whit Monday. The salt, too, is given to the beasts, and the peasants
themselves partake of it before any important journey like a pilgrimage.
Moreover when a storm is threatening some is thrown into the fire as a
protection against hail.﻿ [15-1](crt22.htm#Note_15-1.md)<span
id="Nanchor_15-1"></span>

The most striking thing about St. Stephen's Day, however, is its
connection with horses. St. Stephen is their patron; in England in
former times they were bled on his festival in the belief that it would
benefit them,﻿ [15-2](crt22.htm#Note_15-2.md)<span
id="Nanchor_15-2"></span> and the custom is still continued in some
parts of Austria.﻿ [15-3](crt22.htm#Note_15-3.md)<span
id="Nanchor_15-3"></span> In Tyrol it is the custom not only to <span
id="page_312">p. 312</span> <span id="Page_312"></span>bleed horses on
St. Stephen's Day, but also to give them consecrated salt and bread or
oats and barley.﻿ [15-4](crt22.htm#Note_15-4.md)<span
id="Nanchor_15-4"></span>

In some of the Carinthian valleys where horse-breeding is specially
carried on, the young men ride into the village on their unsaddled
steeds, and a race is run four or five times round the church, while the
priest blesses the animals, sprinkling them with holy water and
exorcizing them.﻿ [15-5](crt22.htm#Note_15-5.md)<span
id="Nanchor_15-5"></span>

Similar customs are or were found in various parts of Germany. In
Munich, formerly, during the services on St. Stephen's Day more than two
hundred men on horseback used to ride three times round the interior of
a church. The horses were decorated with many-coloured ribbons, and the
practice was not abolished till 1876.﻿ [15-6](crt22.htm#Note_15-6.md)<span
id="Nanchor_15-6"></span> At Backnang in Swabia horses were ridden out,
as fast as possible, to protect them from the influence of witches, and
in the Hohenlohe region men-servants were permitted by their masters to
ride in companies to neighbouring places, where much drinking went
on.﻿ [15-7](crt22.htm#Note_15-7.md)<span id="Nanchor_15-7"></span> In
Holstein the lads on Stephen's Eve used to visit their neighbours in a
company, groom the horses, and ride about in the farmyards, making a
great noise until the people woke up and treated them to beer and
spirits.﻿ [15-8](crt22.htm#Note_15-8.md)<span id="Nanchor_15-8"></span> At
the village of Wallsbüll near Flensburg the peasant youths in the early
morning held a race, and the winner was called Steffen and entertained
at the inn. At Viöl near Bredstadt the child who got up last on
December 26 received the name of Steffen and had to ride to a
neighbour's house on a hay-fork. In other German districts the festival
was called “the great horse-day,” consecrated food was given to the
animals, they were driven round and round the fields until they sweated
violently, and at last were ridden to the blacksmith's and bled, to keep
them healthy through the year. The blood was preserved as a remedy for
various illnesses.﻿ [15-9](crt22.htm#Note_15-9.md)<span
id="Nanchor_15-9"></span>

It is, however, in Sweden that the “horsy” aspect of the festival is
most obvious.﻿ [15-10](crt22.htm#Note_15-10.md)<span
id="Nanchor_15-10"></span> Formerly there was a custom, at one o'clock
on St. Stephen's morning, for horses to be ridden to water that flowed
northward; they would then drink “the cream of the water” and flourish
during the year. There was a violent race to the water, and the servant
who got there first was rewarded by a drink of something stronger.
Again, early that morning one <span id="page_313">p. 313</span> <span
id="Page_313"></span>peasant would clean out another's stable, often at
some distance from his home, feed, water, and rub down the horses, and
then be entertained to breakfast. In olden times after service on St.
Stephen's Day there was a race home on horseback, and it was supposed
that he who arrived first would be the first to get his harvest in. But
the most remarkable custom is the early morning jaunt of the so-called
“Stephen's men,” companies of peasant youths, who long before daybreak
ride in a kind of race from village to village and awaken the
inhabitants with a folk-song called *Staffansvisa*, expecting to be
treated to ale or spirits in return.

The cavalcade is supposed to represent St. Stephen and his followers,
yet the saint is not, as might be expected, the first martyr of the New
Testament, but a dauntless missionary who, according to old legends, was
one of the first preachers of the Gospel in Sweden, and was murdered by
the heathen in a dark forest. A special trait, his love of horses,
connects him with the customs just described. He had, the legends tell,
five steeds: two red, two white, one dappled; when one was weary he
mounted another, making every week a great round to preach the Word.
After his death his body was fastened to the back of an unbroken colt,
which halted not till it came near Norrala, his home. There he was
buried, and a church built over his grave became a place of pilgrimage
to which sick animals, especially horses, were brought for healing.

Mannhardt and Feilberg hold that this Swedish St. Stephen is not a
historical personage but a mythical figure, like many other saints, and
that his legend, so bound up with horses, was an attempt to account for
the folk-customs practised on the day dedicated to St. Stephen the first
martyr. It is interesting to note that legendary tradition has played
about a good deal with the New Testament Stephen; for instance an old
English carol makes him a servant in King Herod's hall at the time of
Christ's birth:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Stephen out of kitchen came,</span>  
<span class="i4">With boarës head on hand,</span>  
<span class="i2">He saw a star was fair and bright</span>  
<span class="i4">Over Bethlehem stand.”</span>  

</div>

</div>

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span> <span id="Page_314"></span>Thereupon
he forsook King Herod for the Child Jesus, and was stoned to
death.﻿ [15-11](crt22.htm#Note_15-11.md)<span id="Nanchor_15-11"></span>

To return, however, to the horse customs of the day after Christmas, it
is pretty plain that they are of non-Christian origin. Mannhardt has
suggested that the race which is their most prominent feature once
formed the prelude to a ceremony of lustration of houses and fields with
a sacred tree. Somewhat similar “ridings” are found in various parts of
Europe in spring, and are connected with a procession that appears to be
an ecclesiastical adaptation of a pre-Christian
lustration-rite.﻿ [15-12](crt22.htm#Note_15-12.md)<span
id="Nanchor_15-12"></span> The great name of Mannhardt lends weight to
this theory, but it seems a somewhat roundabout way of accounting for
the facts. Perhaps an explanation of the “horsiness” of the day might be
sought in some pre-Christian sacrifice of steeds.

We have already noted that St. Stephen's Day is often the date for the
“hunting of the wren” in the British Isles; it was also in England
generally devoted to hunting and shooting, it being held that the game
laws were not in force on that day.﻿ [15-13](crt22.htm#Note_15-13.md)<span
id="Nanchor_15-13"></span> This may be only an instance of Christmas
licence, but it is just possible that there is here a survival of some
tradition of sacrificial slaughter.

### <span class="smcap">St. John's Day.</span>

An ecclesiastical adaptation of a pagan practice may be seen in the
*Johannissegen* customary on St. John's Day in many parts of Catholic
Germany and Austria. A quantity of wine is brought to church to be
blessed by the priest after Mass, and is taken away by the people to be
drunk at home. There are many popular beliefs about the magical powers
of this wine, beliefs which can be traced back through at least four
centuries. In Tyrol and Bavaria it is supposed to protect its drinker
from being struck by lightning, in the Rhenish Palatinate it is drunk in
order that the other wine a man possesses may be kept from injury, or
that next year's harvest may be good. In Nassau, Carinthia, and other
regions some is poured into the wine-casks to preserve the precious
drink from harm, while in Bavaria some is kept for use as medicine in
sickness. <span id="page_315">p. 315</span> <span
id="Page_315"></span>In Syria St. John's wine is said to keep the body
sound and healthy, and on his day even babes in the cradle are made to
join in the family drinking.﻿ [15-14](crt22.htm#Note_15-14.md)<span
id="Nanchor_15-14"></span>

It appears that in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there was a
great drinking on St. John's Day of ordinary, as well as consecrated,
wine, often to excess, and scholars of that time seriously believed that
*Weihnacht*, the German name for Christmas, should properly be spelt
*Weinnacht*.﻿ [15-15](crt22.htm#Note_15-15.md)<span
id="Nanchor_15-15"></span> The *Johannissegen*, or *Johannisminne* as it
was sometimes called, seems, all things considered, to be a survival of
an old wine sacrifice like the *Martinsminne*. That it does not owe its
origin to the legend about the cup of poison drunk by St. John is shown
by the fact that a similar custom was in old times practised in Germany
and Sweden on St. Stephen's Day.﻿ [15-16](crt22.htm#Note_15-16.md)<span
id="Nanchor_15-16"></span>

### <span class="smcap">Holy Innocents’ Day.</span>

Holy Innocents’ Day or Childermas, whether or not because of Herod's
massacre, was formerly peculiarly unlucky; it was a day upon which no
one, if he could possibly avoid it, should begin any piece of work. It
is said of that superstitious monarch, Louis XI. of France, that he
would never do any business on that day, and of our own Edward IV. that
his coronation was postponed, because the date originally fixed was
Childermas. In Cornwall no housewife would scour or scrub on Childermas,
and in Northamptonshire it was considered very unlucky to begin any
undertaking or even to do washing throughout the year on the day of the
week on which the feast fell. Childermas was there called Dyzemas and a
saying ran: “What is begun on Dyzemas Day will never be finished.” In
Ireland it was called “the cross day of the year,” and it was said that
anything then begun must have an unlucky
ending.﻿ [15-17](crt22.htm#Note_15-17.md)<span id="Nanchor_15-17"></span>

In folk-ritual the day is remarkable for its association with whipping
customs. The seventeenth-century writer Gregorie mentions a custom of
whipping up children on Innocents’ Day in the morning, and explains its
purpose as being that the memory of Herod's “murther might stick the
closer; and, in a moderate proportion, to act over the crueltie again in
kind.”﻿ [15-18](crt22.htm#Note_15-18.md)<span id="Nanchor_15-18"></span>

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span> <span id="Page_316"></span>This
explanation will hardly hold water; the many and various examples of the
practice of whipping at Christmas collected by
Mannhardt﻿ [15-19](crt22.htm#Note_15-19.md)<span id="Nanchor_15-19"></span>
show that it is not confined either to Innocents’ Day or to children.
Moreover it is often regarded not as a cruel infliction, but as a
service for which return must be made in good things to eat.

In central and southern Germany the custom is called “peppering”
(*pfeffern*) and also by other names. In the Orlagau the girls on St.
Stephen's, and the boys on St. John's Day beat their parents and
godparents with green fir-branches, while the menservants beat their
masters with rosemary sticks, saying:

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Fresh green! Long life!</span>  
<span class="i2">Give me a bright *thaler* \[or nuts, &c.\].”</span>  

</div>

</div>

They are entertained with plum-loaf or gingerbreads and brandy. In the
Saxon Erzgebirge the young fellows whip the women and girls on St.
Stephen's Day, if possible while they are still in bed, with birch-rods,
singing the while:

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Fresh green, fair and fine,</span>  
<span class="i2">Gingerbread and brandy-wine”;</span>  

</div>

</div>

and on St. John's Day the women pay the men back. At several places in
the Thuringian Forest children on Innocents’ Day beat passers-by with
birch-boughs, and get in return apples, nuts, and other dainties.
Various other German examples of the same class of practice are given by
Mannhardt.﻿ [15-20](crt22.htm#Note_15-20.md)<span
id="Nanchor_15-20"></span>

In France children who let themselves be caught in bed on the morning of
Holy Innocents’ came in for a whipping from their parents; while in one
province, Normandy, the early risers among the young people themselves
gave the sluggards a beating. The practice even gave birth to a
verb﻿—*innocenter*.﻿ [15-21](crt22.htm#Note_15-21.md)<span
id="Nanchor_15-21"></span>

There can be little doubt that the Innocents’ Day beating is a survival
of a pre-Christian custom. Similar ritual scourging is found in many
countries at various seasons of the year, and is by no means confined to
Europe.﻿ [15-22](crt22.htm#Note_15-22.md)<span id="Nanchor_15-22"></span>
As now practised, it has <span id="page_317">p. 317</span> <span
id="Page_317"></span>often a harsh appearance, or has become a kind of
teasing, as when in Bohemia at Easter young men whip girls until they
give them something. Its original purpose, however, as we have seen in
connection with St. Martin's rod, seems to have been altogether kindly.
The whipping was not meant as a punishment or expiation or to harden
people to pain, but either to expel harmful influences and drive out
evil spirits or to convey by contact the virtues of some sacred tree.
