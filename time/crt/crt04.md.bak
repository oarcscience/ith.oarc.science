It has been an instinct in nearly all peoples, savage or civilized, to
set aside certain days for special ceremonial observances, attended by
outward rejoicing. This tendency to concentrate on special times answers
to man's need to lift himself above the commonplace and the everyday, to
escape from the leaden weight of monotony that oppresses him. “We tend
to tire of the most eternal splendours, and a mark on our calendar, or a
crash of bells at midnight maybe, reminds us that we have only recently
been created.”﻿ [1](crt24.htm#Footnote_1.md)<span
id="FNanchor_1"></span>﻿ [1-1](crt22.htm#Note_1-1.md)<span
id="Nanchor_1-1"></span> That they wake people up is the great
justification of festivals, and both man's religious sense and his joy
in life have generally tended to rise “into peaks and towers and
turrets, into superhuman exceptions which really prove the
rule.”﻿ [1-2](crt22.htm#Note_1-2.md)<span id="Nanchor_1-2"></span> It is
difficult to be religious, impossible to be merry, at every moment of
life, and festivals are as sunlit peaks, testifying, above dark valleys,
to the eternal radiance. This is one view of the purpose and value of
festivals, and their function of cheering people and giving them larger
perspectives has no doubt been an important reason for their maintenance
in the past. If we could trace the custom of festival-keeping back to
its origins in primitive society <span id="page_18">p. 18</span> <span
id="Page_18"></span>we should find the same principle of specialization
involved, though it is probable that the practice came into being not
for the sake of its moral or emotional effect, but from man's desire to
lay up, so to speak, a stock of sanctity, magical not ethical, for
ordinary days.

The first holy-day-makers were probably more concerned with such
material goods as food than with spiritual ideals, when they marked with
sacred days the rhythm of the seasons.﻿ [1-3](crt22.htm#Note_1-3.md)<span
id="Nanchor_1-3"></span> As man's consciousness developed, the
subjective aspect of the matter would come increasingly into prominence,
until in the festivals of the Christian Church the main object is to
quicken the devotion of the believer by contemplation of the mysteries
of the faith. Yet attached, as we shall see, to many Christian
festivals, are old notions of magical sanctity, probably quite as potent
in the minds of the common people as the more spiritual ideas suggested
by the Church's feasts.

In modern England we have almost lost the festival habit, but if there
is one feast that survives among us as a universal tradition it is
Christmas. We have indeed our Bank Holidays, but they are mere days of
rest and amusement, and for the mass of the people Easter and
Whitsuntide have small religious significance﻿—Christmas alone has the
character of sanctity which marks the true festival. The celebration of
Christmas has often little or nothing to do with orthodox dogma, yet
somehow the sense of obligation to keep the feast is very strong, and
there are few English people, however unconventional, who escape
altogether the spell of tradition in this matter.

*Christmas*﻿—how many images the word calls up: we think of
carol-singers and holly-decked churches where people hymn in
time-honoured strains the Birth of the Divine Child; of frost and snow,
and, in contrast, of warm hearths and homes bright with light and
colour, very fortresses against the cold; of feasting and revelry, of
greetings and gifts exchanged; and lastly of vaguely superstitious
customs, relics of long ago, performed perhaps out of respect for use
and wont, or merely in jest, or with a deliberate attempt to throw
ourselves back into the past, to re-enter for a moment the mental
childhood of the race. These are a few of <span id="page_19">p.
19</span> <span id="Page_19"></span>the pictures that rise pell-mell in
the minds of English folk at the mention of Christmas; how many other
scenes would come before us if we could realize what the festival means
to men of other nations. Yet even these will suggest what hardly needs
saying, that Christmas is something far more complex than a Church
holy-day alone, that the celebration of the Birth of Jesus, deep and
touching as is its appeal to those who hold the faith of the
Incarnation, is but one of many elements that have entered into the
great winter festival.

In the following pages I shall try to present a picture, sketchy and
inadequate though it must be, of what Christmas is and has been to the
peoples of Europe, and to show as far as possible the various elements
that have gone into its make-up. Most people have a vague impression
that these are largely pagan, but comparatively few have any idea of the
process by which the heathen elements have become mingled with that
which is obviously Christian, and equal obscurity prevails as to the
nature and meaning of the non-Christian customs. The subject is vast,
and has not been thoroughly explored as yet, but the labours of
historians and folk-lorists have made certain conclusions probable, and
have produced hypotheses of great interest and fascination.

I have spoken of “Christian”﻿ [2](crt24.htm#Footnote_2.md)<span
id="FNanchor_2"></span> and “pagan” elements. The distinction is blurred
to some extent by the clothing of heathen customs in a superficial
Christianity, but on the whole it is clear enough to justify the
division of this book into two parts, one dealing with the Church's
feast of the Holy Birth, the other with those remains of pagan winter
festivals which extend from November to January, but cluster especially
round Christmas and the Twelve Days.

Before we pass to the various aspects of the Church's Christmas, we must
briefly consider its origins and its relation to certain <span
id="page_20">p. 20</span> <span id="Page_20"></span>pagan festivals, the
customs of which will be dealt with in detail in Part II.

The names given to the feast by different European peoples throw a
certain amount of light on its history. Let us take five of
them﻿—*Christmas*, *Weihnacht*, *Noël*, *Calendas*, and *Yule*﻿—and see
what they suggest.

I. The English *Christmas* and its Dutch equivalent *Kerstmisse*,
plainly point to the ecclesiastical side of the festival; the German
*Weihnacht*﻿ [1-4](crt22.htm#Note_1-4.md)<span id="Nanchor_1-4"></span>
(sacred night) is vaguer, and might well be either pagan or Christian;
in point of fact it seems to be Christian, since it does not appear till
the year 1000, when the Faith was well established in
Germany.﻿ [1-5](crt22.htm#Note_1-5.md)<span id="Nanchor_1-5"></span>
*Christmas* and *Weihnacht*, then, may stand for the distinctively
Christian festival, the history of which we may now briefly study.

When and where did the keeping of Christmas begin? Many details of its
early history remain in uncertainty, but it is fairly clear that the
earliest celebration of the Birth of Christ on December 25 took place at
Rome about the middle of the fourth century, and that the observance of
the day spread from the western to the eastern Church, which had before
been wont to keep January 6 as a joint commemoration of the Nativity and
the Baptism of the Redeemer.﻿ [3](crt24.htm#Footnote_3.md)<span
id="FNanchor_3"></span>

The first mention of a Nativity feast on December 25 is found in a Roman
document known as the Philocalian Calendar, dating from the year 354,
but embodying an older document evidently belonging to the year 336. It
is uncertain to which date the Nativity reference
belongs;﻿ [4](crt24.htm#Footnote_4.md)<span id="FNanchor_4"></span> but
further back than 336 at all events the festival cannot be traced.

From Rome, Christmas spread throughout the West, with the <span
id="page_21">p. 21</span> <span id="Page_21"></span>conversion of the
barbarians. Whether it came to England through the Celtic Church is
uncertain, but St. Augustine certainly brought it with him, and
Christmas Day, 598, witnessed a great event, the baptism of more than
ten thousand English converts.﻿ [1-9](crt22.htm#Note_1-9.md)<span
id="Nanchor_1-9"></span> In 567 the Council of Tours had declared the
Twelve Days, from Christmas to Epiphany, a festal
tide;﻿ [1-10](crt22.htm#Note_1-10.md)<span id="Nanchor_1-10"></span> the
laws of Ethelred (991-1016) ordained it to be a time of peace and
concord among Christian men, when all strife must
cease.﻿ [1-11](crt22.htm#Note_1-11.md)<span id="Nanchor_1-11"></span> In
Germany Christmas was established by the Synod of Mainz in
813;﻿ [1-12](crt22.htm#Note_1-12.md)<span id="Nanchor_1-12"></span> in
Norway by King Hakon the Good about the middle of the tenth
century.﻿ [1-13](crt22.htm#Note_1-13.md)<span id="Nanchor_1-13"></span>

In the East, as has been seen, the Birth of the Redeemer was at first
celebrated not on December 25, but on January 6, the feast of the
Epiphany or manifestation of Christ's glory. The Epiphany can be traced
as far back as the second century, among the Basilidian heretics, from
whom it may have spread to the Catholic Church. It was with them
certainly a feast of the Baptism, and possibly also of the Nativity, of
Christ. The origins of the Epiphany
festival﻿ [1-14](crt22.htm#Note_1-14.md)<span id="Nanchor_1-14"></span> are
very obscure, nor can we say with certainty what was its meaning at
first. It may be that it took the place of a heathen rite celebrating
the birth of the World or Æon from the Virgin on
January 6.﻿ [5](crt24.htm#Footnote_5.md)<span id="FNanchor_5"></span> At
all events one of its objects was to commemorate the Baptism, the
appearance of the Holy Dove, and the Voice from heaven, “Thou art my
beloved son, in whom I am well pleased” (or, as other MSS. read, “This
day have I begotten thee”).

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span> <span id="Page_22"></span>In some
circles of early Christianity the Baptism appears to have been looked
upon as the true Birth of Christ, the moment when, filled by the Spirit,
He became Son of God; and the carnal Birth was regarded as of
comparatively little significance. Hence the Baptism festival may have
arisen first, and the celebration of the Birth at Bethlehem may have
been later attached to the same day, partly perhaps because a passage in
St. Luke's Gospel was supposed to imply that Jesus was baptized on His
thirtieth birthday. As however the orthodox belief became more sharply
defined, increasing stress was laid on the Incarnation of God in Christ
in the Virgin's womb, and it may have been felt that the celebration of
the Birth and the Baptism on the same day encouraged heretical views.
Hence very likely the introduction of Christmas on December 25 as a
festival of the Birth alone. In the East the concelebration of the two
events continued for some time after Rome had instituted the separate
feast of Christmas. Gradually, however, the Roman use spread: at
Constantinople it was introduced about 380 by the great theologian,
Gregory Nazianzen; at Antioch it appeared in 388, at Alexandria in 432.
The Church of Jerusalem long stood out, refusing to adopt the new feast
till the seventh century, it would
seem.﻿ [1-18](crt22.htm#Note_1-18.md)<span id="Nanchor_1-18"></span> One
important Church, the Armenian, knows nothing of December 25, and still
celebrates the Nativity with the Epiphany on
January 6.﻿ [1-19](crt22.htm#Note_1-19.md)<span id="Nanchor_1-19"></span>
Epiphany in the eastern Orthodox Church has lost its connection with the
Nativity and is now chiefly a celebration of the Baptism of Christ,
while in the West, as every one knows, it is primarily a celebration of
the Adoration by the Magi, an event commemorated by the Greeks on
Christmas Day. Epiphany is, however, as we shall see, a greater festival
in the Greek Church than Christmas.

Such in bare outline is the story of the spread of Christmas as an
independent festival. Its establishment fitly followed the triumph of
the Catholic doctrine of the perfect Godhead or Christ at the Council of
Nicea in 325.

II\. The French *Noël* is a name concerning whose origin there has been
considerable dispute; there can, however, be little doubt that it is the
same word as the Provençal *Nadau* or *Nadal*, <span id="page_23">p.
23</span> <span id="Page_23"></span>the Italian *Natale*, and the Welsh
*Nadolig*, all obviously derived from the Latin *natalis*, and meaning
“birthday.” One naturally takes this as referring to the Birth of
Christ, but it may at any rate remind us of another birthday celebrated
on the same date by the Romans of the Empire, that of the unconquered
Sun, who on December 25, the winter solstice according to the Julian
calendar, began to rise to new vigour after his autumnal decline.

Why, we may ask, did the Church choose December 25 for the celebration
of her Founder's Birth? No one now imagines that the date is supported
by a reliable tradition; it is only one of various guesses of early
Christian writers. As a learned eighteenth-century
Jesuit﻿ [1-20](crt22.htm#Note_1-20.md)<span id="Nanchor_1-20"></span> has
pointed out, there is not a single month in the year to which the
Nativity has not been assigned by some writer or other. The real reason
for the choice of the day most probably was, that upon it fell the pagan
festival just mentioned.

The *Dies Natalis Invicti* was probably first celebrated in Rome by
order of the Emperor Aurelian (270-5), an ardent worshipper of the
Syrian sun-god Baal.﻿ [1-21](crt22.htm#Note_1-21.md)<span
id="Nanchor_1-21"></span> With the *Sol Invictus* was identified the
figure of Mithra, that strange eastern god whose cult resembled in so
many ways the worship of Jesus, and who was at one time a serious rival
of the Christ in the minds of thoughtful
men.﻿ [6](crt24.htm#Footnote_6.md)<span
id="FNanchor_6"></span>﻿ [1-22](crt22.htm#Note_1-22.md)<span
id="Nanchor_1-22"></span> It was the sun-god, poetically and
philosophically conceived, whom the Emperor Julian made the centre of
his ill-fated revival of paganism, and there is extant a fine prayer of
his to “King Sun.”﻿ [1-23](crt22.htm#Note_1-23.md)<span
id="Nanchor_1-23"></span>

What more natural than that the Church should choose this day to
celebrate the rising of her Sun of Righteousness with healing in His
wings, that she should strive thus to draw away to His worship some
adorers of the god whose symbol and representative was the earthly sun!
There is no direct evidence of deliberate substitution, but at all
events ecclesiastical writers soon after the foundation of Christmas
made good use of the idea <span id="page_24">p. 24</span> <span
id="Page_24"></span>that the birthday of the Saviour had replaced the
birthday of the sun.﻿ [7](crt24.htm#Footnote_7.md)<span
id="FNanchor_7"></span>

Little is known of the manner in which the *Natalis Invicti* was kept;
it was not a folk-festival, and was probably observed by the classes
rather than the masses.﻿ [1-24](crt22.htm#Note_1-24.md)<span
id="Nanchor_1-24"></span> Its direct influence on Christmas customs has
probably been little or nothing. It fell, however, just before a Roman
festival that had immense popularity, is of great importance for our
subject, and is recalled by another name for Christmas that must now be
considered.

III\. The Provençal *Calendas* or *Calenos*, the Polish *Kolenda*, the
Russian *Kolyáda*, the Czech *Koleda* and the Lithuanian *Kalledos*, not
to speak of the Welsh *Calenig* for Christmas-box, and the Gaelic
*Calluinn* for New Year's Eve, are all derived from the Latin
*Kalendae*, and suggest the connection of Christmas with the Roman New
Year's Day, the Kalends or the first day of January, a time celebrated
with many festive customs. What these were, and how they have affected
Christmas we shall see in some detail in Part II.; suffice it to say
here that the festival, which lasted for at least three days, was one of
riotous life, of banqueting and games and licence. It was preceded,
moreover, by the *Saturnalia* (December 17 to 23) which had many like
features, and must have formed practically one festive season with it.
The word *Saturnalia* has become so familiar in modern usage as to
suggest sufficiently the character of the festival for which it stands.

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span> <span id="Page_25"></span>Into the midst
of this season of revelry and licence the Church introduced her
celebration of the beginning of man's redemption from the bondage of
sin. Who can wonder that Christmas contains incongruous elements, for
old things, loved by the people, cannot easily be uprooted.

IV\. One more name yet remains to be considered, *Yule* (Danish *Jul*),
the ordinary word for Christmas in the Scandinavian languages, and not
extinct among ourselves. Its derivation has been widely discussed, but
so far no satisfactory explanation of it has been found. Professor Skeat
in the last edition of his Etymological Dictionary (1910) has to admit
that its origin is unknown. Whatever its source may be, it is clearly
the name of a Germanic season﻿—probably a two-month tide covering the
second half of November, the whole of December, and the first half of
January.﻿ [1-26](crt22.htm#Note_1-26.md)<span id="Nanchor_1-26"></span> It
may well suggest to us the element added to Christmas by the barbarian
peoples who began to learn Christianity about the time when the festival
was founded. Modern research has tended to disprove the idea that the
old Germans held a Yule feast at the winter solstice, and it is
probable, as we shall see, that the specifically Teutonic Christmas
customs come from a New Year and beginning-of-winter festival kept about
the middle of November. These customs transferred to Christmas are to a
great extent religious or magical rites intended to secure prosperity
during the coming year, and there is also the familiar Christmas
feasting, apparently derived in part from the sacrificial banquets that
marked the beginning of winter.

We have now taken a general glance at the elements which have combined
in Christmas. The heathen folk-festivals absorbed by the Nativity feast
were essentially life-affirming, they expressed the mind of men who said
“yes” to this life, who valued earthly good things. On the other hand
Christianity, at all events in its intensest form, the religion of the
monks, was at bottom pessimistic as regards this earth, and valued it
only as a place of discipline for the life to come; it was essentially a
religion of renunciation that said “no” to the world. The <span
id="page_26">p. 26</span> <span id="Page_26"></span>Christian had here
no continuing city, but sought one to come. How could the Church make a
feast of the secular New Year; what mattered to her the world of time?
her eye was fixed upon the eternal realities﻿—the great drama of
Redemption. Not upon the course of the temporal sun through the zodiac,
but upon the mystical progress of the eternal Sun of Righteousness must
she base her calendar. Christmas and New Year's Day﻿—the two festivals
stood originally for the most opposed of principles.

Naturally the Church fought bitterly against the observance of the
Kalends; she condemned repeatedly the unseemly doings of Christians in
joining in heathenish customs at that season; she tried to make the
first of January a solemn fast; and from the ascetic point of view she
was profoundly right, for the old festivals were bound up with a lusty
attitude towards the world, a seeking for earthly joy and well-being.

The struggle between the ascetic principle of self-mortification,
world-renunciation, absorption in a transcendent ideal, and the natural
human striving towards earthly joy and well-being, is, perhaps, the most
interesting aspect of the history of Christianity; it is certainly shown
in an absorbingly interesting way in the development of the Christian
feast of the Nativity. The conflict is keen at first; the Church
authorities fight tooth and nail against these relics of heathenism,
these devilish rites; but mankind's instinctive paganism is
insuppressible, the practices continue as ritual, though losing much of
their meaning, and the Church, weary of denouncing, comes to wink at
them, while the pagan joy in earthly life begins to colour her own
festival.

The Church's Christmas, as the Middle Ages pass on, becomes increasingly
“merry”﻿—warm and homely, suited to the instincts of ordinary humanity,
filled with a joy that is of this earth, and not only a mystical rapture
at a transcendental Redemption. The Incarnate God becomes a real child
to be fondled and rocked, a child who is the loveliest of infants, whose
birthday is the supreme type of all human birthdays, and may be kept
with feasting and dance and song. Such is the Christmas of popular
tradition, the Nativity as it is reflected in the carols, the
cradle-rocking, the mystery plays of the later Middle Ages. This <span
id="page_27">p. 27</span> <span id="Page_27"></span>Christmas, which
still lingers, though maimed, in some Catholic regions, is strongly
life-affirming; the value and delight of earthly, material things is
keenly felt; sometimes, even, it passes into coarseness and riot. Yet a
certain mysticism usually penetrates it, with hints that this dear life,
this fair world, are not all, for the soul has immortal longings in her.
Nearly always there is the spirit of reverence, of bowing down before
the Infant God, a visitor from the supernatural world, though bone of
man's bone, flesh of his flesh. Heaven and earth have met together; the
rough stable is become the palace of the Great King.

This we might well call the “Catholic” Christmas, the Christmas of the
age when the Church most nearly answered to the needs of the whole man,
spiritual and sensuous. The Reformation in England and Germany did not
totally destroy it; in England the carol-singers kept up for a while the
old spirit; in Lutheran Germany a highly coloured and surprisingly
sensuous celebration of the Nativity lingered on into the eighteenth
century. In the countries that remained Roman Catholic much of the old
Christmas continued, though the spirit of the Counter-Reformation, faced
by the challenge of Protestantism, made for greater “respectability,”
and often robbed the Catholic Christmas of its humour, its homeliness,
its truly popular stamp, substituting pretentiousness for simplicity,
sugary sentiment for naïve and genuine poetry.

Apart from the transformation of the Church's Christmas from something
austere and metaphysical into something joyous and human, warm and
kindly, we shall note in our Second Part the survival of much that is
purely pagan, continuing alongside of the celebration of the Nativity,
and often little touched by its influence. But first we must consider
the side of the festival suggested by the English and French names:
*Christmas* will stand for the liturgical rites commemorating the wonder
of the Incarnation﻿—God in man made manifest﻿—*Noël* or “the Birthday,”
for the ways in which men have striven to realize the human aspect of
the great Coming.

How can we reach the inner meaning of the Nativity feast, its
significance for the faithful? Better, perhaps, by the way of <span
id="page_28">p. 28</span> <span id="Page_28"></span>poetry than by the
way of ritual, for it is poetry that reveals the emotions at the back of
the outward observances, and we shall understand these better when the
singers of Christmas have laid bare to us their hearts. We may therefore
first give attention to the Christmas poetry of sundry ages and peoples,
and then go on to consider the liturgical and popular ritual in which
the Church has striven to express her joy at the Redeemer's birth.
Ceremonial, of course, has always mimetic tendencies, and in a further
chapter we shall see how these issued in genuine drama; how, in the
miracle plays, the Christmas story was represented by the forms and
voices of living men.
