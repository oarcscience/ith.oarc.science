<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN class=smcap>Christmas Eve.</SPAN></H3>
<P>Christmas in the narrowest sense must be reckoned as beginning on the evening 
of December&nbsp;24. Though Christmas Eve is not much observed in modern 
England, throughout the rest of Europe its importance so far as popular customs 
are concerned is far greater than that of the Day itself. Then in Germany the 
Christmas-tree is manifested in its glory; then, as in the England of the past, 
the Yule log is solemnly lighted in many lands; then often the most distinctive 
Christmas meal takes place.</P>
<P>We shall consider these and other institutions later; though they appear 
first on Christmas Eve, they belong more or less to the Twelve Days as a whole. 
Let us look first at the supernatural visitors, mimed by human beings, who 
delight the minds of children, especially in Germany, on the evening of 
December&nbsp;24, and at the beliefs that hang around this most solemn night of 
the year.</P>
<P class=thoughtbreak>First of all, the activities of St. Nicholas are not 
confined to his own festival; he often appears on Christmas Eve. We have already 
seen how he is attended by various companions, including <A NAME="page_230"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 230</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_230"></A>Christ Himself, and how he comes now vested as a bishop, 
now as a masked and shaggy figure. The names and attributes of the Christmas and 
Advent visitors are rather confused, but on the whole it may be said that in 
Protestant north Germany the episcopal St. Nicholas and his Eve have been 
replaced by Christmas Eve and the Christ Child, while the name Klas has become 
attached to various unsaintly forms appearing at or shortly before 
Christmas.</P>
<P>We can trace a deliberate substitution of the Christ Child for St. Nicholas 
as the bringer of gifts. In the early seventeenth century a Protestant pastor is 
found complaining that parents put presents in their children's beds and tell 
them that St. Nicholas has brought them. &#8220;This,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is a bad custom, 
because it points children to the saint, while yet we know that not St. Nicholas 
but the holy Christ Child gives us all good things for body and soul, and He 
alone it is whom we ought to call upon.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-1">10-1</A><a name="Nanchor_10-1"></A> </P>
<P>The ways in which the figure, or at all events the name, of Christ Himself, 
is introduced into German Christmas customs, are often surprising. The Christ 
Child, &#8220;Christkind,&#8221; so familiar to German children, has now become a sort of 
mythical figure, a product of sentiment and imagination working so freely as 
almost to forget the sacred character of the original. Christkind bears little 
resemblance to the Infant of Bethlehem; he is quite a tall child, and is often 
represented by a girl dressed in white, with long fair hair. He hovers, indeed, 
between the character of the Divine Infant and that of an angel, and is regarded 
more as a kind of good fairy than as anything else.</P>
<P>In Alsace the girl who represents Christkind has her face &#8220;made up&#8221; with 
flour, wears a crown of gold paper with lighted candles in it&#65279;&#8212;a parallel to the 
headgear of the Swedish Lussi; in one hand she holds a silver bell, in the 
other, a basket of sweetmeats. She is followed by the terrible Hans Trapp, 
dressed in a bearskin, with blackened face, long beard, and threatening rod. He 
&#8220;goes for&#8221; the naughty children, who are only saved by the intercession of 
Christkind.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-2">10-2</A><a name="Nanchor_10-2"></A> </P>
<P>In the Mittelmark the name of <I>de h&ecirc;le</I> (holy) <I>Christ</I> is 
strangely <A NAME="page_231"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 231</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_231"></A>given to a skin- or straw-clad man, elsewhere called Knecht 
Ruprecht, Klas, or Joseph.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-3">10-3</A><a name="Nanchor_10-3"></A> In the Ruppin district a man dresses up in white with 
ribbons, carries a large pouch, and is called <I>Christmann</I> or 
<I>Christpuppe</I>. He is accompanied by a <I>Schimmelreiter</I> and by other 
fellows who are attired as women, have blackened faces, and are named 
<I>Feien</I> (we may see in them a likeness to the Kalends maskers condemned by 
the early Church). The procession goes round from house to house. The 
<I>Schimmelreiter</I> as he enters has to jump over a chair; this done, the 
<I>Christpuppe</I> is admitted. The girls present begin to sing, and the 
<I>Schimmelreiter</I> dances with one of them. Meanwhile the <I>Christpuppe</I> 
makes the children repeat some verse of Scripture or a hymn; if they know it 
well, he rewards them with gingerbreads from his wallet; if not, he beats them 
with a bundle filled with ashes. Then both he and the <I>Schimmelreiter</I> 
dance and pass on. Only when they are gone are the <I>Feien</I> allowed to 
enter; they jump wildly about and frighten the children.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-4">10-4</A><a name="Nanchor_10-4"></A> </P>
<P>Knecht Ruprecht, to whom allusion has already been made, is a prominent 
figure in the German Christmas. On Christmas Eve in the north he goes about clad 
in skins or straw and examines children; if they can say their prayers perfectly 
he rewards them with apples, nuts and gingerbreads; if not, he punishes them. In 
the Mittelmark, as we have seen, a personage corresponding to him is sometimes 
called &#8220;the holy Christ&#8221;; in Mecklenburg he is &#8220;r&ucirc; Klas&#8221; (rough Nicholas&#65279;&#8212;note 
his identification with the saint); in Brunswick, Hanover, and Holstein &#8220;Klas,&#8221; 
&#8220;Klawes,&#8221; &#8220;Klas B&ucirc;r&#8221; and &#8220;Bullerklas&#8221;; and in Silesia &#8220;Joseph.&#8221; Sometimes he 
wears bells and carries a long staff with a bag of ashes at the end&#65279;&#8212;hence the 
name &#8220;Aschenklas&#8221; occasionally given to him.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-5">10-5</A><a name="Nanchor_10-5"></A> An ingenious theory connects this aspect of him with 
the <I>polaznik</I> of the Slavs, who on Christmas Day in Crivoscian farms goes 
to the hearth, takes up the ashes of the Yule log and dashes them against the 
cauldron-hook above so that sparks fly (see &nbsp;<a href="crt14.htm#Chapter_X">X</A>).&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-6">10-6</A><a name="Nanchor_10-6"></A> As for the name &#8220;Ruprecht&#8221; the older mythologists 
interpreted it as meaning &#8220;shining with glory,&#8221; <I>hruodperaht</I>, and 
identified its owner with the god Woden.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-7">10-7</A><a name="Nanchor_10-7"></A> Dr. Tille, however, regards him <A NAME="page_232"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 232</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_232"></A>as dating only from the seventeenth century.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-8">10-8</A><a name="Nanchor_10-8"></A> It can hardly be said that any satisfactory account 
has as yet been given of the origins of this personage, or of his relation to 
St. Nicholas, Pelzm&auml;rte, and monstrous creatures like the 
<I>Klapperbock</I>.</P>
<P>In the south-western part of Lower Austria, both St. Nicholas&#65279;&#8212;a proper 
bishop with mitre, staff, and ring&#65279;&#8212;and Ruprecht appear on Christmas Eve, and 
there is quite an elaborate ceremonial. The children welcome the saint with a 
hymn; then he goes to a table and makes each child repeat a prayer and show his 
lesson-books. Meanwhile Ruprecht in a hide, with glowing eyes and a long red 
tongue, stands at the door to overawe the young people. Each child next kneels 
before the saint and kisses his ring, whereupon Nicholas bids him put his shoes 
out-of-doors and look in them when the clock strikes ten. After this the saint 
lays on the table a rod dipped in lime, solemnly blesses the children, 
sprinkling them with holy water, and noiselessly departs. The children steal out 
into the garden, clear a space in the snow, and set out their shoes; when the 
last stroke of ten has sounded they find them filled with nuts and apples and 
all kinds of sweet things.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-9">10-9</A><a name="Nanchor_10-9"></A> </P>
<P>In the Troppau district of Austrian Silesia, three figures go round on 
Christmas Eve&#65279;&#8212;Christkindel, the archangel Gabriel, and St. Peter&#65279;&#8212;and perform a 
little play before the presents they bring are given. Christkindel announces 
that he has gifts for the good children, but the bad shall feel the rod. St. 
Peter complains of the naughtiness of the youngsters: they play about in the 
streets instead of going straight to school; they tear up their lesson-books and 
do many other wicked things. However, the children's mother pleads for them, and 
St. Peter relents and gives out the presents.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-10">10-10</A><a name="Nanchor_10-10"></A> </P>
<P>In the Erzgebirge appear St. Peter and Ruprecht, who is clad in skin and 
straw, has a mask over his face, a rod, a chain round his body, and a sack with 
apples, nuts, and other gifts; and a somewhat similar performance is gone 
through.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-11">10-11</A><a name="Nanchor_10-11"></A> </P>
<P>If we go as far east as Russia we find a parallel to the girl Christkind in 
Koly&aacute;da, a white-robed maiden driven about in a sledge from house to house on 
Christmas Eve. The young people who attended her sang carols, and presents were 
given <A NAME="page_233"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 233</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_233"></A>them in return. <I>Koly&aacute;da</I> is the name for Christmas 
and appears to be derived from <I>Kalendae</I>, which probably entered the 
Slavonic languages by way of Byzantium. The maiden is one of those beings who, 
like the Italian Befana, have taken their names from the festival at which they 
appear.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-12">10-12</A><a name="Nanchor_10-12"></A> </P>
<P class=thoughtbreak>No time in all the Twelve Nights and Days is so charged 
with the supernatural as Christmas Eve. Doubtless this is due to the fact that 
the Church has hallowed the night of December 24-5 above all others in the year. 
It was to the shepherds keeping watch over their flocks <I>by night</I> that, 
according to the Third Evangelist, came the angelic message of the Birth, and in 
harmony with this is the unique Midnight Mass of the Roman Church, lending a 
peculiar sanctity to the hour of its celebration. And yet many of the beliefs 
associated with this night show a large admixture of paganism.</P>
<P>First, there is the idea that at midnight on Christmas Eve animals have the 
power of speech. This superstition exists in various parts of Europe, and no one 
can hear the beasts talk with impunity. The idea has given rise to some curious 
and rather grim tales. Here is one from Brittany:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<P>&#8220;Once upon a time there was a woman who starved her cat and dog. At midnight 
on Christmas Eve she heard the dog say to the cat, &#145;It is quite time we lost our 
mistress; she is a regular miser. To-night burglars are coming to steal her 
money; and if she cries out they will break her head.&#146; &#145;&#146;Twill be a good deed,&#146; 
the cat replied. The woman in terror got up to go to a neighbour's house; as she 
went out the burglars opened the door, and when she shouted for help they broke 
her head.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-13">10-13</A><a name="Nanchor_10-13"></A> </P>
<P>Again a story is told of a farm servant in the German Alps who did not 
believe that the beasts could speak, and hid in a stable on Christmas Eve to 
learn what went on. At midnight he heard surprising things. &#8220;We shall have hard 
work to do this day week,&#8221; said one horse. &#8220;Yes, the farmer's servant is heavy,&#8221; 
answered the other. &#8220;And the way to the churchyard is long and steep,&#8221; said the 
first. The servant was buried that day week.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-14">10-14</A><a name="Nanchor_10-14"></A> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_234"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 234</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_234"></A>It may well have been the traditional association of the ox 
and ass with the Nativity that fixed this superstition to Christmas Eve, but the 
conception of the talking animals is probably pagan.</P>
<P>Related to this idea, but more Christian in form, is the belief that at 
midnight all cattle rise in their stalls or kneel and adore the new-born King. 
Readers of Mr. Hardy's &#8220;Tess&#8221; will remember how this is brought into a 
delightful story told by a Wessex peasant. The idea is widespread in England and 
on the Continent,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-15">10-15</A><a name="Nanchor_10-15"></A> and has reached even the North American Indians. 
Howison, in his &#8220;Sketches of Upper Canada,&#8221; relates that an Indian told him that 
&#8220;on Christmas night all deer kneel and look up to Great Spirit.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-16">10-16</A><a name="Nanchor_10-16"></A> A somewhat similar belief about bees was held in the 
north of England: they were said to assemble on Christmas Eve and hum a 
Christmas hymn.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-17">10-17</A><a name="Nanchor_10-17"></A> Bees seem in folk-lore in general to be specially 
near to humanity in their feelings.</P>
<P>It is a widespread idea that at midnight on Christmas Eve all water turns to 
wine. A Guernsey woman once determined to test this; at midnight she drew a 
bucket from the well. Then came a voice:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i15>&#8220;Toute l'eau se tourne en vin,</SPAN><BR><SPAN  class=i2>Et tu es proche de ta fin.&#8221;</SPAN><BR></DIV></DIV>
<P>She fell down with a mortal disease, and died before the end of the year. In 
Sark the superstition is that the water in streams and wells turns into blood, 
and if you go to look you will die within the year.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-18">10-18</A><a name="Nanchor_10-18"></A> </P>
<P>There is also a French belief that on Christmas Eve, while the genealogy of 
Christ is being chanted at the Midnight Mass, hidden treasures are revealed.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-19">10-19</A><a name="Nanchor_10-19"></A> In Russia all sorts of buried treasures are supposed 
to be revealed on the evenings between Christmas and the Epiphany, and on the 
eves of these festivals the heavens are opened, and the waters of springs and 
rivers turn into wine.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-20">10-20</A><a name="Nanchor_10-20"></A> </P>
<P>Another instance of the supernatural character of the night is found in a 
Breton story of a blacksmith who went on working after the sacring bell had rung 
at the Midnight Mass. To him <A NAME="page_235"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 235</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_235"></A>came a tall, stooping man with a scythe, who begged him to 
put in a nail. He did so; and the visitor in return bade him send for a priest, 
for this work would be his last. The figure disappeared, the blacksmith felt his 
limbs fail him, and at cock-crow he died. He had mended the scythe of the 
<I>Ankou</I>&#65279;&#8212;Death the reaper.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-21">10-21</A><a name="Nanchor_10-21"></A> </P>
<P>In the Scandinavian countries simple folk have a vivid sense of the nearness 
of the supernatural on Christmas Eve. On Yule night no one should go out, for he 
may meet uncanny beings of all kinds. In Sweden the Trolls are believed to 
celebrate Christmas Eve with dancing and revelry. &#8220;On the heaths witches and 
little Trolls ride, one on a wolf, another on a broom or a shovel, to their 
assemblies, where they dance under their stones.... In the mount are then to be 
heard mirth and music, dancing and drinking. On Christmas morn, during the time 
between cock-crowing and daybreak, it is highly dangerous to be abroad.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-22">10-22</A><a name="Nanchor_10-22"></A> </P>
<P>Christmas Eve is also in Scandinavian folk-belief the time when the dead 
revisit their old homes, as on All Souls&#146; Eve in Roman Catholic lands. The 
living prepare for their coming with mingled dread and desire to make them 
welcome. When the Christmas Eve festivities are over, and everyone has gone to 
rest, the parlour is left tidy and adorned, with a great fire burning, candles 
lighted, the table covered with a festive cloth and plentifully spread with 
food, and a jug of Yule ale ready. Sometimes before going to bed people wipe the 
chairs with a clean white towel; in the morning they are wiped again, and, if 
earth is found, some kinsman, fresh from the grave, has sat there. Consideration 
for the dead even leads people to prepare a warm bath in the belief that, like 
living folks, the kinsmen will want a wash before their festal meal.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_96">96</A><a name="FNanchor_96"></A> Or again beds were made ready for them while the 
living slept on straw. Not always is it consciously the dead for whom these 
preparations are made, sometimes they are said to be for the Trolls and 
sometimes even for <A NAME="page_236"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 236</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_236"></A>the Saviour and His angels.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-24">10-24</A><a name="Nanchor_10-24"></A> (We may compare with this Christian idea the 
Tyrolese custom of leaving some milk for the Christ Child and His Mother&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-25">10-25</A><a name="Nanchor_10-25"></A> at the hour of Midnight Mass, and a Breton practice 
of leaving food all through Christmas night in case the Virgin should come.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-26">10-26</A><a name="Nanchor_10-26"></A> )</P>
<P>It is difficult to say how far the other supernatural beings&#65279;&#8212;their name is 
legion&#65279;&#8212;who in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland are believed to come out of 
their underground hiding-places during the long dark Christmas nights, were 
originally ghosts of the dead. Twenty years ago many students would have 
accounted for them all in this way, but the tendency now is strongly against the 
derivation of all supernatural beings from ancestor-worship. Elves, trolls, 
dwarfs, witches, and other uncanny folk&#65279;&#8212;the beliefs about their Christmas 
doings are too many to be treated here; readers of Danish will find a long and 
very interesting chapter on this subject in Dr. Feilberg's &#8220;Jul.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-27">10-27</A><a name="Nanchor_10-27"></A> I may mention just one familiar figure of the 
Scandinavian Yule, Tomte Gubbe, a sort of genius of the house corresponding very 
much to the &#8220;drudging goblin&#8221; of Milton's &#8220;L'Allegro,&#8221; for whom the cream-bowl 
must be duly set. He may perhaps be the spirit of the founder of the family. At 
all events on Christmas Eve Yule porridge and new milk are set out for him, 
sometimes with other things, such as a suit of small clothes, spirits, or even 
tobacco. Thus must his goodwill be won for the coming year.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-28">10-28</A><a name="Nanchor_10-28"></A> </P>
<P>In one part of Norway it used to be believed that on Christmas Eve, at rare 
intervals, the old Norse gods made war on Christians, coming down from the 
mountains with great blasts of wind and wild shouts, and carrying off any human 
being who might be about. In one place the memory of such a visitation was 
preserved in the nineteenth century. The people were preparing for their 
festivities, when suddenly from the mountains came the warning sounds. &#8220;In a 
second the air became black, peals of thunder echoed among the hills, lightning 
danced about the buildings, and the inhabitants in the darkened rooms heard the 
clatter of hoofs and the weird shrieks of the hosts of the gods.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-29">10-29</A><a name="Nanchor_10-29"></A> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_237"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 237</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_237"></A>The Scandinavian countries, Protestant though they are, 
have retained many of the outward forms of Catholicism, and the sign of the 
cross is often used as a protection against uncanny visitors. The cross&#65279;&#8212;perhaps 
the symbol was originally Thor's hammer&#65279;&#8212;is marked with chalk or tar or fire 
upon doors and gates, is formed of straw or other material and put in stables 
and cowhouses, or is smeared with the remains of the Yule candle on the udders 
of the beasts&#65279;&#8212;it is in fact displayed at every point open to attack by a spirit 
of darkness.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-30">10-30</A><a name="Nanchor_10-30"></A> </P>
<P class=thoughtbreak>Christmas Eve is in Germany a time for auguries. Some of 
the methods already noted on other days are practised upon it&#65279;&#8212;for instance the 
pouring of molten lead into water, the flinging of shoes, the pulling out of 
pieces of wood, and the floating of nutshells&#65279;&#8212;and there are various others 
which it might be tedious to describe.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-31">10-31</A><a name="Nanchor_10-31"></A> </P>
<P>Among the southern Slavs if a girl wants to know what sort of husband she 
will get, she covers the table on Christmas Eve, puts on it a white loaf, a 
plate, and a knife, spoon, and fork, and goes to bed. At midnight the spirit of 
her future husband will appear and fling the knife at her. If it falls without 
injuring her she will get a good husband and be happy, but if she is hurt she 
will die early. There is a similar mode of divination for a young fellow. On 
Christmas Eve, when everybody else has gone to church, he must, naked and in 
darkness, sift ashes through a sieve. His future bride will then appear, pull 
him thrice by the nose, and go away.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-32">10-32</A><a name="Nanchor_10-32"></A> </P>
<P>In eastern Europe Christmas, and especially Christmas Eve, is the time for 
the singing of carols called in Russian <I>Koly&aacute;dki</I>, and in other Slav 
countries by similar names derived from <I>Kalendae</I>.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-33">10-33</A><a name="Nanchor_10-33"></A> More often than not these are without connection 
with the Nativity; sometimes they have a Christian form and tell of the doings 
of God, the Virgin and the saints, but frequently they are of an entirely 
secular or even pagan character. Into some the sun, moon, and stars and other 
natural objects are introduced, and they seem to be based on myths to which a 
Christian appearance has been given by a sprinkling of names of holy persons of 
the <A NAME="page_238"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 238</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_238"></A>Church. Here for instance is a fragment from a Carpathian 
song:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>

<P>Often they contain wishes for the prosperity of the household and end with 
the words, &#8220;for many years, for many years.&#8221; The Roumanian songs are frequently 
very long, and a typical, oft-recurring refrain is:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>

<P>Sometimes they are ballads of the national life.</P>
<P>In Russia a carol beginning &#8220;Glory be to God in heaven, Glory!&#8221; and calling 
down blessings on the Tsar and his people, is one of the most prominent among 
the <I>Koly&aacute;dki</I>, and opens the singing of the songs called 
<I>Podblyudnuiya</I>. &#8220;At the Christmas festival a table is covered with a 
cloth, and on it is set a dish or bowl (<I>blyudo</I>) containing water. The 
young people drop rings or other trinkets into the dish, which is afterwards 
covered with a cloth, and then the <I>Podblyudnuiya</I> Songs commence. At the 
end of each song one of the trinkets is drawn at random, and its owner deduces 
an omen from the nature of the words which have just been sung.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-36">10-36</A><a name="Nanchor_10-36"></A> </P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN class=smcap>The Twelve Days.</SPAN></H3>
<P>Whatever the limits fixed for the beginning and end of the Christmas 
festival, its core is always the period between Christmas <A NAME="page_239"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 239</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_239"></A>Eve and the Epiphany&#65279;&#8212;the &#8220;Twelve Days.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_97">97</A><a name="FNanchor_97"></A> A cycle of feasts falls within this time, and the 
customs peculiar to each day will be treated in calendarial order. First, 
however, it will be well to glance at the character of the Twelve Days as a 
whole, and at the superstitions which hang about the season. So many are these 
superstitions, so &#8220;bewitched&#8221; is the time, that the older mythologists not 
unnaturally saw in it a Teutonic festal season, dating from pre-Christian days. 
In point of fact it appears to be simply a creation of the Church, a natural 
linking together of Christmas and Epiphany. It is first mentioned as a festal 
tide by the eastern Father, Ephraem Syrus, at the end of the fourth century, and 
was declared to be such by the western Council of Tours in 567.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-37">10-37</A><a name="Nanchor_10-37"></A> </P>
<P>While Christmas Eve is the night <I>par excellence</I> of the supernatural, 
the whole season of the Twelve Days is charged with it. It is hard to see whence 
Shakespeare could have got the idea which he puts into the mouth of Marcellus in 
&#8220;Hamlet&#8221;:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i15>&#8220;Some say that ever &#145;gainst that season 
comes</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>Wherein our Saviour's birth is 
celebrated,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>The bird of dawning singeth all night 
long;</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>And then, they say, no spirit dare stir 
abroad;</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>The nights are wholesome; then no planets 
strike,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to 
charm,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-38">10-38</A><a name="Nanchor_10-38"></A> </SPAN><BR></DIV></DIV>
<P>Against this is the fact that in folk-lore Christmas is a quite peculiarly 
uncanny time. Not unnatural is it that at this midwinter season of darkness, 
howling winds, and raging storms, men should have thought to see and hear the 
mysterious shapes and voices of dread beings whom the living shun.</P>
<P>Throughout the Teutonic world one finds the belief in a &#8220;raging <A NAME="page_240"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 240</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_240"></A>host&#8221; or &#8220;wild hunt&#8221; or spirits, rushing howling through 
the air on stormy nights. In North Devon its name is &#8220;Yeth (heathen) hounds&#8221;;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-40">10-40</A><a name="Nanchor_10-40"></A> elsewhere in the west of England it is called the 
&#8220;Wish hounds.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-41">10-41</A><a name="Nanchor_10-41"></A> It is the train of the unhappy souls of those who 
died unbaptized, or by violent hands, or under a curse, and often Woden is their 
leader.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-42">10-42</A><a name="Nanchor_10-42"></A> At least since the seventeenth century this &#8220;raging 
host&#8221; (<I>das w&uuml;thende Heer</I>) has been particularly associated with Christmas 
in German folk-lore,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-43">10-43</A><a name="Nanchor_10-43"></A> and in Iceland it goes by the name of the &#8220;Yule 
host.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-44">10-44</A><a name="Nanchor_10-44"></A> </P>
<P>In Guernsey the powers of darkness are supposed to be more than usually 
active between St. Thomas's Day and New Year's Eve, and it is dangerous to be 
out after nightfall. People are led astray then by Will o&#146; the Wisp, or are 
preceded or followed by large black dogs, or find their path beset by white 
rabbits that go hopping along just under their feet.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-45">10-45</A><a name="Nanchor_10-45"></A> </P>
<P>In England there are signs that supernatural visitors were formerly looked 
for during the Twelve Days. First there was a custom of cleansing the house and 
its implements with peculiar care. In Shropshire, for instance, &#8220;the pewter and 
brazen vessels had to be made so bright that the maids could see to put their 
caps on in them&#65279;&#8212;otherwise the fairies would pinch them, but if all was perfect, 
the worker would find a coin in her shoe.&#8221; Again in Shropshire special care was 
taken to put away any suds or &#8220;back-lee&#8221; for washing purposes, and no spinning 
might be done during the Twelve Days.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-46">10-46</A><a name="Nanchor_10-46"></A> It was said elsewhere that if any flax were left on 
the distaff, the Devil would come and cut it.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-47">10-47</A><a name="Nanchor_10-47"></A> </P>
<P>The prohibition of spinning may be due to the Church's hallowing of the 
season and the idea that all work then was wrong. This churchly hallowing may 
lie also at the root of the Danish tradition that from Christmas till New Year's 
Day nothing that runs round should be set in motion,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-48">10-48</A><a name="Nanchor_10-48"></A> and of the German idea that no thrashing must be 
done during the Twelve Days, or all the corn within hearing will spoil. The 
expectation of uncanny visitors in the English traditions calls, however, for 
special attention; it is perhaps because of their coming that the house must be 
left spotlessly clean and with as little as possible about on which they can 
work mischief.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-49">10-49</A><a name="Nanchor_10-49"></A> Though I know of no distinct English belief in the 
<A NAME="page_241"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 241</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_241"></A>return of the family dead at Christmas, it may be that the 
fairies expected in Shropshire were originally ancestral ghosts. Such a 
derivation of the elves and brownies that haunt the hearth is very probable.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-50">10-50</A><a name="Nanchor_10-50"></A> </P>
<P class=thoughtbreak>The belief about the Devil cutting flax left on the 
distaff links the English superstitions to the mysterious <I>Frau</I> with 
various names, who in Germany is supposed to go her rounds during the Twelve 
Nights. She has a special relation to spinning, often punishing girls who leave 
their flax unspun. In central Germany and in parts of Austria she is called Frau 
Holle or Holda, in southern Germany and Tyrol Frau Berchta or Perchta, in the 
north down to the Harz Mountains Frau Freen or Frick, or Fru Gode or Fru Harke, 
and there are other names too.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-51">10-51</A><a name="Nanchor_10-51"></A> Attempts have been made to dispute her claim to the 
rank of an old Teutonic goddess and to prove her a creation of the Middle Ages, 
a representative of the crowd of ghosts supposed to be specially near to the 
living at Christmastide.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-52">10-52</A><a name="Nanchor_10-52"></A> It is questionable whether she can be thus explained 
away, and at the back of the varying names, and much overlaid no doubt with 
later superstitions, there may be a traditional goddess corresponding to that 
old divinity Frigg to whom we owe the name of Friday. The connection of Frick 
with Frigg is very probable, and Frick shares characteristics with the other 
<I>Frauen</I>.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-53">10-53</A><a name="Nanchor_10-53"></A> </P>
<P>All are connected with spinning and spinsters (in the literal sense). Fru 
Frick or Freen in the Uckermark and the northern Harz permits no spinning during 
the time when she goes her rounds, and if there are lazy spinsters she soils the 
unspun flax on their distaff. In like manner do Holda, Harke, Berchta, and Gode 
punish lazy girls.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-54">10-54</A><a name="Nanchor_10-54"></A> </P>
<P>The characters of the <I>Frauen</I> can best be shown by the things told of 
them in different regions. They are more dreaded than loved, but if severe in 
their chastisements they are also generous in rewarding those who do them 
service.</P>
<P>Frau Gaude (also called Gode, Gaue, or Wode) is said in Mecklenburg to love 
to drive through the village streets on the Twelve Nights with a train of dogs. 
Wherever she finds a street-door open she sends a little dog in. Next morning he 
wags his <A NAME="page_242"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 242</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_242"></A>tail at the inmates and whines, and will not be driven 
away. If killed, he turns into a stone by day; this, though it may be thrown 
away, always returns and is a dog again by night. All through the year he whines 
and brings ill luck upon the house; so people are careful to keep their 
street-doors shut during the Twelve Nights.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-55">10-55</A><a name="Nanchor_10-55"></A> </P>
<P>Good luck, however, befalls those who do Frau Gaude a service. A man who put 
a new pole to her carriage was brilliantly repaid&#65279;&#8212;the chips that fell from the 
pole turned to glittering gold. Similar stories of golden chips are told about 
Holda and Berchta.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-56">10-56</A><a name="Nanchor_10-56"></A> </P>
<P>A train of dogs belongs not only to Frau Gaude but also to Frau Harke; with 
these howling beasts they go raging through the air by night.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-57">10-57</A><a name="Nanchor_10-57"></A> The <I>Frauen</I> in certain aspects are, indeed, 
the leaders of the &#8220;Wild Host.&#8221;</P>
<P>Holda and Perchta, as some strange stories show, are the guides and guardians 
of the <I>heimchen</I> or souls of children who have died unbaptized. In the 
valley of the Saale, so runs a tale, Perchta, queen of the <I>heimchen</I>, had 
her dwelling of old, and at her command the children watered the fields, while 
she worked with her plough. But the people of the place were ungrateful, and she 
resolved to leave their land. One night a ferryman beheld on the bank of the 
Saale a tall, stately lady with a crowd of weeping children. She demanded to be 
ferried across, and the children dragged a plough into the boat, crying 
bitterly. As a reward for the ferrying, Perchta, mending her plough, pointed to 
the chips. The man grumblingly took three, and in the morning they had turned to 
gold-pieces.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-58">10-58</A><a name="Nanchor_10-58"></A> </P>
<P>Holda, whose name means &#8220;the kindly one,&#8221; is the most friendly of the 
<I>Frauen</I>. In Saxony she brings rewards for diligent spinsters, and on every 
New Year's Eve, between nine and ten o'clock, she drives in a carriage full of 
presents through villages where respect has been shown to her. At the crack of 
her whip the people come out to receive her gifts. In Hesse and Thuringia she is 
imagined as a beautiful woman clad in white with long golden hair, and, when it 
snows hard, people say, &#8220;Frau Holle is shaking her featherbed.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-59">10-59</A><a name="Nanchor_10-59"></A> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_243"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 243</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_243"></A>More of a bugbear on the whole is Berchte or Perchte (the 
name is variously spelt). She is particularly connected with the Eve of the 
Epiphany, and it is possible that her name comes from the old German 
<I>giper(c)hta Na(c)ht</I>, the bright or shining night, referring to the 
manifestation of Christ's glory.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-60">10-60</A><a name="Nanchor_10-60"></A> In Carinthia the Epiphany is still called 
<I>Berchtentag</I>.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-61">10-61</A><a name="Nanchor_10-61"></A> </P>
<P>Berchte is sometimes a bogey to frighten children. In the mountains round 
Traunstein children are told on Epiphany Eve that if they are naughty she will 
come and cut their stomachs open.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-62">10-62</A><a name="Nanchor_10-62"></A> In Upper Austria the girls must finish their 
spinning by Christmas; if Frau Berch finds flax still on their distaffs she will 
be angered and send them bad luck.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-63">10-63</A><a name="Nanchor_10-63"></A> </P>
<P>In the Orlagau (between the Saale and the Orle) on the night before Twelfth 
Day, Perchta examines the spinning-rooms and brings the spinners empty reels 
with directions to spin them full within a very brief time; if this is not done 
she punishes them by tangling and befouling the flax. She also cuts open the 
body of any one who has not eaten <I>zemmede</I> (fasting fare made of flour and 
milk and water) that day, takes out any other food he has had, fills the empty 
space with straw and bricks, and sews him up again.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-64">10-64</A><a name="Nanchor_10-64"></A> And yet, as we have seen, she has a kindly side&#65279;&#8212;at 
any rate she rewards those who serve her&#65279;&#8212;and in Styria at Christmas she even 
plays the part of Santa Klaus, hearing children repeat their prayers and 
rewarding them with nuts and apples.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-65">10-65</A><a name="Nanchor_10-65"></A> </P>
<P>There is a charming Tyrolese story about her. At midnight on Epiphany Eve a 
peasant&#65279;&#8212;not too sober&#65279;&#8212;suddenly heard behind him &#8220;a sound of many voices, which 
came on nearer and nearer, and then the Berchtl, in her white clothing, her 
broken ploughshare in her hand, and all her train of little people, swept 
clattering and chattering close past him. The least was the last, and it wore a 
long shirt which got in the way of its little bare feet, and kept tripping it 
up. The peasant had sense enough left to feel compassion, so he took his garter 
off and bound it for a girdle round the infant, and then set it again on its 
way. When the Berchtl saw what he had done, she turned back and thanked him, and 
told him that in return for his compassion his children should never come to 
want.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-66">10-66</A><a name="Nanchor_10-66"></A> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_244"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 244</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_244"></A>In Tyrol, by the way, it is often said that the Perchtl is 
Pontius Pilate's wife, Procula.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-67">10-67</A><a name="Nanchor_10-67"></A> In the Italian dialects of south Tyrol the German 
Frau Berchta has been turned into <I>la donna Berta</I>.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-68">10-68</A><a name="Nanchor_10-68"></A> If one goes further south, into Italy itself, one 
meets with a similar being, the Befana, whose name is plainly nothing but a 
corruption of <I>Epiphania</I>. She is so distinctly a part of the Epiphany 
festival that we may leave her to be considered later.</P>
<P class=thoughtbreak>Of all supernatural Christmas visitors, the most vividly 
realized and believed in at the present day are probably the Greek 
<I>Kallikantzaroi</I> or <I>Karkantzaroi</I>.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-69">10-69</A><a name="Nanchor_10-69"></A> They are the terror of the Greek peasant during the 
Twelve Days; in the soil of his imagination they flourish luxuriantly, and to 
him they are a very real and living nuisance.</P>
<P>Traditions about the <I>Kallikantzaroi</I> vary from region to region, but in 
general they are half-animal, half-human monsters, black, hairy, with huge 
heads, glaring red eyes, goats&#146; or asses&#146; ears, blood-red tongues hanging out, 
ferocious tusks, monkeys&#146; arms, and long curved nails, and commonly they have 
the foot of some beast. &#8220;From dawn till sunset they hide themselves in dark and 
dank places ... but at night they issue forth and run wildly to and fro, rending 
and crushing those who cross their path. Destruction and waste, greed and lust 
mark their course.&#8221; When a house is not prepared against their coming, &#8220;by 
chimney and door alike they swarm in, and make havoc of the home; in sheer 
wanton mischief they overturn and break all the furniture, devour the Christmas 
pork, befoul all the water and wine and food which remains, and leave the 
occupants half dead with fright or violence.&#8221; Many like or far worse pranks do 
they play, until at the crowing of the third cock they get them away to their 
dens. The signal for their final departure does not come until the Epiphany, 
when, as we saw in &nbsp;<a href="crt07.htm#Chapter_IV">IV</A>, the &#8220;Blessing of the Waters&#8221; takes place. Some of the hallowed water is 
put into vessels, and with these and with incense the priests sometimes make a 
round of the village, sprinkling the people and their houses. The fear of the <A NAME="page_245"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 245</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_245"></A><I>Kallikantzaroi</I> at this purification is expressed in 
the following lines:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i15>&#8220;Quick, begone! we must 
begone,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>Here comes the pot-bellied 
priest,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>With his censer in his hand</SPAN><BR><SPAN  class=i2>And his sprinkling-vessel too;</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>He has purified 
the streams</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>And he has polluted 
us.&#8221;</SPAN><BR></DIV></DIV>
<P>Besides this ecclesiastical purification there are various Christian 
precautions against the <I>Kallikantzaroi</I>&#65279;&#8212;<I>e.g.</I>, to mark the 
house-door with a black cross on Christmas Eve, the burning of incense and the 
invocation of the Trinity&#65279;&#8212;and a number of other means of aversion: the lighting 
of the Yule log, the burning of something that smells strong, and&#65279;&#8212;perhaps as a 
peace-offering&#65279;&#8212;the hanging of pork-bones, sweetmeats, or sausages in the 
chimney.</P>
<P>Just as men are sometimes believed to become vampires temporarily during 
their lifetime, so, according to one stream of tradition, do living men become 
<I>Kallikantzaroi</I>. In Greece children born at Christmas are thought likely 
to have this objectionable characteristic as a punishment for their mothers&#146; sin 
in bearing them at a time sacred to the Mother of God. In Macedonia&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-70">10-70</A><a name="Nanchor_10-70"></A> people who have a &#8220;light&#8221; guardian angel undergo the 
hideous transformation.</P>
<P>Many attempts have been made to account for the <I>Kallikantzaroi</I>. 
Perhaps the most plausible explanation of the outward form, at least, of the 
uncanny creatures, is the theory connecting them with the masquerades that 
formed part of the winter festival of Dionysus and are still to be found in 
Greece at Christmastide. The hideous bestial shapes, the noise and riot, may 
well have seemed demoniacal to simple people slightly &#8220;elevated,&#8221; perhaps, by 
Christmas feasting, while the human nature of the maskers was not altogether 
forgotten.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-71">10-71</A><a name="Nanchor_10-71"></A> Another theory of an even more prosaic character has 
been propounded&#65279;&#8212;&#8220;that the Kallikantzaroi are nothing more than established 
nightmares, limited like indigestion to the twelve days of feasting. This view 
is <A NAME="page_246"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 246</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_246"></A>taken by Allatius, who says that a Kallikantzaros has all 
the characteristics of nightmare, rampaging abroad and jumping on men's 
shoulders, then leaving them half senseless on the ground.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-72">10-72</A><a name="Nanchor_10-72"></A> </P>
<P>Such theories are ingenious and suggestive, and may be true to a certain 
degree, but they hardly cover all the facts. It is possible that the 
<I>Kallikantzaroi</I> may have some connection with the departed; they certainly 
appear akin to the modern Greek and Slavonic vampire, &#8220;a corpse imbued with a 
kind of half-life,&#8221; and with eyes gleaming like live coals.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-73">10-73</A><a name="Nanchor_10-73"></A> They are, however, even more closely related to the 
werewolf, a man who is supposed to change into a wolf and go about ravening. It 
is to be noted that &#8220;man-wolves&#8221; (&#955;&#965;&#954;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#953;) is the very name given to the 
<I>Kallikantzaroi</I> in southern Greece, and that the word 
<I>Kallikantzaros</I> itself has been conjecturally derived by Bernhard Schmidt 
from two Turkish words meaning &#8220;black&#8221; and &#8220;werewolf.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-74">10-74</A><a name="Nanchor_10-74"></A> The connection between Christmas and werewolves is 
not confined to Greece. According to a belief not yet extinct in the north and 
east of Germany, even where the real animals have long ago been extirpated, 
children born during the Twelve Nights become werewolves, while in Livonia and 
Poland that period is the special season for the werewolf's ravenings.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-75">10-75</A><a name="Nanchor_10-75"></A> </P>
<P>Perhaps on no question connected with primitive religion is there more 
uncertainty than on the ideas of early man about the nature of animals and their 
relation to himself and the world. When we meet with half-animal, half-human 
beings we must be prepared to find much that is obscure.</P>
<P>With the <I>Kallikantzaroi</I> may be compared some goblins of the Celtic 
imagination; especially like is the Manx <I>Fynnodderee</I> (lit. &#8220;the hairy-dun 
one&#8221;), &#8220;something between a man and a beast, being covered with black shaggy 
hair and having fiery eyes,&#8221; and prodigiously strong.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-76">10-76</A><a name="Nanchor_10-76"></A> The Russian <I>Domovy</I> or house-spirit is also a 
hirsute creature,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-77">10-77</A><a name="Nanchor_10-77"></A> and the Russian <I>Ljeschi</I>, goat-footed woodland 
sprites, are, like the <I>Kallikantzaroi</I>, supposed to be got rid of by the 
&#8220;Blessing of the Waters&#8221; at the Epiphany.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-78">10-78</A><a name="Nanchor_10-78"></A> Some of the monstrous German figures already dealt 
with here <A NAME="page_247"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 247</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_247"></A>bear strong resemblances to the Greek demons. And, of 
course, on Greek ground one cannot help thinking of Pan and the Satyrs and 
Centaurs.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_98">98</A><a name="FNanchor_98"></A></P>
