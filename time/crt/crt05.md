Christmas, as we have seen, had its beginning at the middle of the
fourth century in Rome. The new feast was not long in finding a
hymn-writer to embody in immortal Latin the emotions called forth by the
memory of the Nativity. “Veni, redemptor gentium” is one of the earliest
of Latin hymns﻿—one of the few that have come down to us from the father
of Church song, Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan (d. 397). Great as
theologian and statesman, Ambrose was great also as a poet and
systematizer of Church music. “Veni, redemptor gentium” is above all
things stately and severe, in harmony with the austere character of the
zealous foe of the Arian heretics, the champion of monasticism. It is
the theological aspect alone of Christmas, the redemption of sinful man
by the mystery of the Incarnation and the miracle of the Virgin Birth,
that we find in St. Ambrose's terse and pregnant Latin; there is no
feeling for the human pathos and poetry of the scene at Bethlehem﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Veni, redemptor gentium,</span>  
<span class="i2">Ostende partum virginis;</span>  
<span class="i2">Miretur omne saeculum:</span>

Another fine hymn often heard in English churches is of a slightly later
date. “Corde natus ex Parentis” (“Of the Father's love begotten”) is a
cento from a larger hymn by the Spanish poet Prudentius (*c.* 348-413).
Prudentius did not write for liturgical purposes, and it was several
centuries before “Corde natus” was adopted into the cycle of Latin
hymns. Its elaborate rhetoric is very unlike the severity of “Veni,
redemptor gentium,” but again the note is purely theological; the
Incarnation as a world-event is its theme. It sings the Birth of Him who
is

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Corde natus ex Parentis</span>  
<span class="i2">Ante mundi exordium,</span>  
<span class="i2">Alpha et O cognominatus,</span>  
<span class="i2">Ipse fons et clausula</span>  
<span class="i2">Omnium quae sunt, fuerunt,</span>  
<span class="i2">Quaeque post futura sunt</span>  
<span class="i4">Saeculorum saeculis.”﻿ [10](crt24.htm#Footnote_10.md)<span
id="FNanchor_10"></span>﻿ [2-3](crt22.htm#Note_2-3.md)<span
id="Nanchor_2-3"></span> </span>  

</div>

</div>

Other early hymns are “A solis ortus cardine” (“From east to west, from
shore to shore”), by a certain Coelius Sedulius (d. *c.* 450), still
sung by the Roman Church at Lauds on Christmas Day, and “Jesu, redemptor
omnium” (sixth century), the office hymn at Christmas Vespers. Like the
poems of Ambrose and Prudentius, they are in classical metres, unrhymed,
and based upon quantity, not accent, and they have the same general
character, doctrinal rather than humanly tender.

In the ninth and tenth centuries arose a new form of hymnody, the Prose
or Sequence sung after the Gradual (the anthem between the Epistle and
Gospel at Mass). The earliest writer of sequences was Notker, a monk of
the abbey of St. Gall, near <span id="page_33">p. 33</span> <span
id="Page_33"></span>the Lake of Constance. Among those that are probably
his work is the Christmas “Natus ante saecula Dei filius.” The most
famous Nativity sequence, however, is the “Laetabundus, exsultet fidelis
chorus” of St. Bernard of Clairvaux (d. 1153), once sung all over
Europe, and especially popular in England and France. Here are its
opening verses:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Laetabundus,</span>  
<span class="i2">Exsultet fidelis chorus;</span>  
<span class="i4">Alleluia!</span>  
<span class="i2">Regem regum</span>  
<span class="i2">Intactae profudit thorus;</span>  
<span class="i4">Res miranda!</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Angelus consilii</span>  
<span class="i2">Natus est de Virgine,</span>  
<span class="i4">Sol de stella!</span>  
<span class="i2">Sol occasum nesciens,</span>  
<span class="i2">Stella semper rutilans,</span>  
<span class="i4">Semper clara.”﻿ [11](crt24.htm#Footnote_11.md)<span
id="FNanchor_11"></span>﻿ [2-4](crt22.htm#Note_2-4.md)<span
id="Nanchor_2-4"></span> </span>  

</div>

</div>

The “Laetabundus” is in rhymed stanzas; in this it differs from most
early proses. The writing of rhymed sequences, however, became common
through the example of the Parisian monk, Adam of St. Victor, in the
second half of the twelfth century. He adopted an entirely new style of
versification and music, derived from popular songs; and he and his
successors in <span id="page_34">p. 34</span> <span
id="Page_34"></span>the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries wrote
various proses for the Christmas festival.

If we consider the Latin Christmas hymns from the fourth century to the
thirteenth, we shall find that however much they differ in form, they
have one common characteristic: they are essentially
theological﻿—dwelling on the Incarnation and the Nativity as part of the
process of man's redemption﻿—rather than realistic. There is little
attempt to imagine the scene in the stable at Bethlehem, little interest
in the Child as a child, little sense of the human pathos of the
Nativity. The explanation is, I think, very simple, and it lights up the
whole observance of Christmas as a Church festival in the centuries we
are considering: *this poetry is the poetry of monks, or of men imbued
with the monastic spirit*.

The two centuries following the institution of Christmas saw the
break-up of the Roman Empire in the west, and the incursions of
barbarians threatening the very existence of the Christian civilization
that had conquered classic paganism. It was by her army of monks that
the Church tamed and Christianized the barbarians, and both religion and
culture till the middle of the twelfth century were predominantly
monastic. “In writing of any eminently religious man of this period”
\[the eleventh century\], says Dean Church, “it must be taken almost as
a matter of course that he was a monk.”﻿ [2-5](crt22.htm#Note_2-5.md)<span
id="Nanchor_2-5"></span> And a monastery was not the place for human
feeling about Christmas; the monk was﻿—at any rate in ideal﻿—cut off
from the world; not for him were the joys of parenthood or tender
feelings for a new-born child. To the monk the world was, at least in
theory, the vale of misery; birth and generation were, one may almost
say, tolerated as necessary evils among lay folk unable to rise to the
heights of abstinence and renunciation; one can hardly imagine a true
early Benedictine filled with “joy that a man is born into the world.”
The Nativity was an infinitely important event, to be celebrated with a
chastened, unearthly joy, but not, as it became for the later Middle
Ages and the Renaissance, a matter upon which human affection might
lavish itself, which imagination might deck with vivid concrete detail.
In the later Christmas <span id="page_35">p. 35</span> <span
id="Page_35"></span>the pagan and the Christian spirit, or delight in
earthly things and joy in the invisible, seem to meet and mingle; to the
true monk of the Dark and Early Middle Ages they were incompatible.

What of the people, the great world outside the monasteries? Can we
imagine that Christmas, on its Christian side, had a deep meaning for
them? For the first ten centuries, to quote Dean Church again,
Christianity “can hardly be said to have leavened society at all.... It
acted upon it doubtless with enormous power; but it was as an extraneous
and foreign agent, which destroys and shapes, but does not mingle or
renew.... Society was a long time unlearning heathenism; it has not done
so yet; but it had hardly begun, at any rate it was only just beginning,
to imagine the possibility of such a thing in the eleventh
century.”﻿ [2-6](crt22.htm#Note_2-6.md)<span id="Nanchor_2-6"></span>

“The practical religion of the illiterate,” says another ecclesiastical
historian, Dr. W. R. W. Stephens, “was in many respects merely a
survival of the old paganism thinly disguised. There was a prevalent
belief in witchcraft, magic, sortilegy, spells, charms, talismans, which
mixed itself up in strange ways with Christian ideas and Christian
worship.... Fear, the note of superstition, rather than love, which is
the characteristic of a rational faith, was conspicuous in much of the
popular religion. The world was haunted by demons, hobgoblins, malignant
spirits of divers kinds, whose baneful influence must be averted by
charms or offerings.”﻿ [2-7](crt22.htm#Note_2-7.md)<span
id="Nanchor_2-7"></span>

The writings of ecclesiastics, the decrees of councils and synods, from
the fourth century to the eleventh, abound in condemnations of pagan
practices at the turn of the year. It is in these customs, and in
secular mirth and revelry, not in Christian poetry, that we must seek
for the expression of early lay feeling about Christmas. It was a feast
of material good things, a time for the fulfilment of traditional
heathen usages, rather than a joyous celebration of the Saviour's birth.
No doubt it was observed by due attendance at church, but the services
in a tongue not understanded of the people cannot have been very full of
meaning to them, and we can imagine <span id="page_36">p.
36</span> <span id="Page_36"></span>their Christmas church-going as
rather a duty inspired by fear than an expression of devout rejoicing.
It is noteworthy that the earliest of vernacular Christmas carols known
to us, the early thirteenth-century Anglo-Norman “Seignors, ore entendez
à nus,” is a song not of religion but of revelry. Its last verse is
typical:

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Seignors, jo vus di par Noël,</span>  
<span class="i2">E par li sires de cest hostel,</span>  
<span class="i6">Car bevez ben;</span>  
<span class="i2">E jo primes beverai le men,</span>  
<span class="i2">E pois aprèz chescon le soen,</span>  
<span class="i4">Par mon conseil;</span>  
<span class="i2">Si jo vus di trestoz, ‘Wesseyl!’</span>  
<span class="i2">Dehaiz eit qui ne dirra,
‘Drincheyl!’”﻿ [12](crt24.htm#Footnote_12.md)<span
id="FNanchor_12"></span>﻿ [2-8](crt22.htm#Note_2-8.md)<span
id="Nanchor_2-8"></span> </span>  

</div>

</div>

Not till the close of the thirteenth century do we meet with any
vernacular Christmas poetry of importance. The verses of the
*troubadours* and *trouvères* of twelfth-century France had little to do
with Christianity; their songs were mostly of earthly and illicit love.
The German Minnesingers of the thirteenth century were indeed pious, but
their devout lays were addressed to the Virgin as Queen of Heaven, the
ideal of womanhood, holding in glory the Divine Child in her arms,
rather than to the Babe and His Mother in the great humility of
Bethlehem.

The first real outburst of Christmas joy in a popular tongue is found in
Italy, in the poems of that strange “minstrel of the Lord,” the
Franciscan Jacopone da Todi (b. 1228, d. 1306). *Franciscan*, in that
name we have an indication of the change in religious feeling that came
over the western world, and <span id="page_37">p. 37</span> <span
id="Page_37"></span>especially Italy, in the thirteenth
century.﻿ [2-9](crt22.htm#Note_2-9.md)<span id="Nanchor_2-9"></span> For
the twenty all-too-short years of St. Francis's apostolate have passed,
and a new attitude towards God and man and the world has become
possible. Not that the change was due solely to St. Francis; he was
rather the supreme embodiment of the ideals and tendencies of his day
than their actual creator; but he was the spark that kindled a mighty
flame. In him we reach so important a turning-point in the history of
Christmas that we must linger awhile at his side.

Early Franciscanism meant above all the democratizing, the humanizing of
Christianity; with it begins that “carol spirit” which is the most
winning part of the Christian Christmas, the spirit which, while not
forgetting the divine side of the Nativity, yet delights in its simple
humanity, the spirit that links the Incarnation to the common life of
the people, that brings human tenderness into religion. The faithful no
longer contemplate merely a theological mystery, they are moved by
affectionate devotion to the Babe of Bethlehem, realized as an actual
living child, God indeed, yet feeling the cold of winter, the roughness
of the manger bed.

St. Francis, it must be remembered, was not a man of high birth, but the
son of a silk merchant, and his appeal was made chiefly to the traders
and skilled workmen of the cities, who, in his day, were rising to
importance, coming, in modern Socialist terms, to class-consciousness.
The monks, although boys of low birth were sometimes admitted into the
cloister, were in sympathy one with the upper classes, and monastic
religion and culture were essentially aristocratic. The rise of the
Franciscans meant the bringing home of Christianity to masses of
town-workers, homely people, who needed a religion full of vivid
humanity, and whom the pathetic story of the Nativity would peculiarly
touch.

Love to man, the sense of human brotherhood﻿—that was the great thing
which St. Francis brought home to his age. The message, certainly, was
not new, but he realized it with infectious intensity. The second great
commandment, “Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself,” had not indeed
been forgotten by <span id="page_38">p. 38</span> <span
id="Page_38"></span>mediaeval Christianity; the common life of
monasticism was an attempt to fulfil it; yet for the monk love to man
was often rather a duty than a passion. But to St. Francis love was very
life; he loved not by duty but by an inner compulsion, and his burning
love of God and man found its centre in the God-man, Christ Jesus. For
no saint, perhaps, has the earthly life of Christ been the object of
such passionate devotion as for St. Francis; the Stigmata were the
awful, yet, to his contemporaries, glorious fruit of his meditations on
the Passion; and of the ecstasy with which he kept his Christmas at
Greccio we shall read when we come to consider the *Presepio*. He had a
peculiar affection for the festival of the Holy Child; “the Child
Jesus,” says Thomas of Celano, “had been given over to forgetfulness in
the hearts of many in whom, by the working of His grace, He was raised
up again through His servant Francis.”﻿ [2-10](crt22.htm#Note_2-10.md)<span
id="Nanchor_2-10"></span>

To the Early Middle Ages Christ was the awful Judge, the *Rex tremendae
majestatis*, though also the divine bringer of salvation from sin and
eternal punishment, and, to the mystic, the Bridegroom of the Soul. To
Francis He was the little brother of all mankind as well. It was a new
human joy that came into religion with him. His essentially artistic
nature was the first to realize the full poetry of Christmas﻿—the coming
of infinity into extremest limitation, the Highest made the lowliest,
the King of all kings a poor infant. He had, in a supreme degree, the
mingled reverence and tenderness that inspire the best carols.

Though no Christmas verses by St. Francis have come down to us, there is
a beautiful “psalm” for Christmas Day at Vespers, composed by him partly
from passages of Scripture. A portion of Father Paschal Robinson's
translation may be quoted:﻿—

<div class="poem">

It is in the poetry of Jacopone da Todi, born shortly after the death of
St. Francis, that the Franciscan Christmas spirit finds its most intense
expression. A wild, wandering ascetic, an impassioned poet, and a
soaring mystic, Jacopone is one of the greatest of Christian singers,
unpolished as his verses are. Noble by birth, he made himself utterly as
the common people for whom he piped his rustic notes. “Dio fatto
piccino” (“God made a little thing”) is the keynote of his music; the
Christ Child is for him “our sweet little brother”; with tender
affection he rejoices in endearing diminutives﻿—“Bambolino,”
“Piccolino,” “Jesulino.” He sings of the Nativity with extraordinary
realism.﻿ [13](crt24.htm#Footnote_13.md)<span id="FNanchor_13"></span>
Here, in words, is a picture of the Madonna and her Child that might
well have inspired an early Tuscan artist:﻿—

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span> <span id="Page_42"></span>There have
been few more rapturous poets than Jacopone; men deemed him mad; but,
“if he is mad,” says a modern Italian writer, “he is mad as the
lark”﻿—“Nessun poeta canta a tutta gola come questo frate minore. S’ è
pazzo, è pazzo come l’ allodola.”

To him is attributed that most poignant of Latin hymns, the “Stabat
Mater dolorosa”; he wrote also a joyous Christmas pendant to it:﻿—

In the fourteenth century we find a blossoming forth of Christmas poetry
in another land, Germany.﻿ [2-16](crt22.htm#Note_2-16.md)<span
id="Nanchor_2-16"></span> There are indeed Christmas and Epiphany
passages in a poetical Life of Christ by Otfrid of Weissenburg in the
ninth century, and a twelfth-century poem by Spervogel, “Er ist gewaltic
unde starc,” opens with a mention of Christmas, but these are of little
importance for us. The fourteenth century shows the first real outburst,
and that is traceable, in part at least, to the mystical movement in the
Rhineland caused by the preaching of the great Dominican, Eckhart of
Strasburg, and his followers. It was a movement towards inward piety as
distinguished from, though not excluding, external observances, which
made its way largely by sermons listened to by great congregations in
the towns. Its impulse came not from the monasteries proper, but from
the convents of Dominican friars, and it was for Germany in the
fourteenth century something like what Franciscanism had been for Italy
in the thirteenth. One of the central doctrines of the school <span
id="page_43">p. 43</span> <span id="Page_43"></span>was that of the
Divine Birth in the soul of the believer; according to Eckhart the soul
comes into immediate union with God by “bringing forth the Son” within
itself; the historic Christ is the symbol of the divine humanity to
which the soul should rise: “when the soul bringeth forth the Son,” he
says, “it is happier than Mary.”﻿ [2-17](crt22.htm#Note_2-17.md)<span
id="Nanchor_2-17"></span> Several Christmas sermons by Eckhart have been
preserved; one of them ends with the prayer, “To this Birth may that
God, who to-day is new born as man, bring us, that we, poor children of
earth, may be born in Him as God; to this may He bring us eternally!
Amen.”﻿ [2-18](crt22.htm#Note_2-18.md)<span id="Nanchor_2-18"></span> With
this profound doctrine of the Divine Birth, it was natural that the
German mystics should enter deeply into the festival of Christmas, and
one of the earliest of German Christmas carols, “Es komt ein schif
geladen,” is the work of Eckhart's disciple, John Tauler (d. 1361). It
is perhaps an adaptation of a secular song:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“A ship comes sailing onwards</span>  
<span class="i3">With a precious freight on board;</span>  
<span class="i2">It bears the only Son of God,</span>  
<span class="i3">It bears the Eternal Word.”</span>  

</div>

</div>

The doctrine of the mystics, “Die in order to live,” fills the last
verses:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Whoe'er would hope in gladness</span>  
<span class="i3">To kiss this Holy Child,</span>  
<span class="i2">Must suffer many a pain and woe,</span>  
<span class="i3">Patient like Him and mild;</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Must die with Him to evil</span>  
<span class="i3">And rise to righteousness,</span>  
<span class="i2">That so with Christ he too may share</span>  
<span class="i3">Eternal life and
bliss.”﻿ [2-19](crt22.htm#Note_2-19.md)<span id="Nanchor_2-19"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

To the fourteenth century may perhaps belong an allegorical carol still
sung in both Catholic and Protestant Germany:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Es ist ein Ros entsprungen</span>  
<span class="i2">Aus einer Wurzel zart,<span id="page_44">p.
44</span> <span id="Page_44"></span></span>  
<span class="i2">Als uns die Alten sungen,</span>  
<span class="i2">Von Jesse kam die Art,</span>  
<span class="i2">Und hat ein Blümlein bracht,</span>  
<span class="i2">Mitten im kalten Winter,</span>  
<span class="i2">Wohl zu der halben Nacht.</span>  
<span class="i2">Das Röslein, das ich meine,</span>  
<span class="i2">Davon Jesajas sagt,</span>  
<span class="i2">Hat uns gebracht alleine</span>  
<span class="i2">Marie, die reine Magd.</span>  
<span class="i2">Aus Gottes ew'gem Rat</span>  
<span class="i2">Hat sie ein Kind geboren</span>  
<span class="i2">Wohl zu der halben
Nacht.”﻿ [18](crt24.htm#Footnote_18.md)<span

id="Nanchor_2-20"></span> </span>  

</div>

In a fourteenth-century Life of the mystic Heinrich Suso it is told how
one day angels came to him to comfort him in his sufferings, how they
took him by the hand and led him to dance, while one began a glad song
of the child Jesus, “In dulci jubilo.” To the fourteenth century, then,
dates back that most delightful of German carols, with its interwoven
lines of Latin. I may quote the fine Scots translation in the “Godlie
and Spirituall Sangis” of 1567:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“*In dulci Jubilo*, Now lat us sing with myrth and
jo</span>  
<span class="i2">Our hartis consolatioun lyis *in praesepio*,</span>  
<span class="i2">And schynis as the Sone, *Matris in gremio*,</span>  
<span class="i2">*Alpha es et O, Alpha es et O.*</span>  
<span class="i2">*O Jesu parvule!* I thrist sore efter thé,<span
id="page_45">p. 45</span> <span id="Page_45"></span></span>  
<span class="i2">Confort my hart and mynde, *O puer optime*,</span>  
<span class="i2">God of all grace sa kynde, *et princeps
gloriae*</span>  
<span class="i2">*Trahe me post te, Trahe me post te*.</span>  
<span class="i2">*Ubi sunt gaudia*, in ony place bot thair,</span>  
<span class="i2">Quhair that the Angellis sing *Nova cantica*,</span>  
<span class="i2">Bot and the bellis ring *in regis curia*,</span>  
<span class="i2">God gif I war thair, God gif I war
thair.”﻿ [2-21](crt22.htm#Note_2-21.md)<span id="Nanchor_2-21"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

The music of “In dulci jubilo”﻿ [19](crt24.htm#Footnote_19.md)<span
id="FNanchor_19"></span> has, with all its religious feeling, something
of the nature of a dance, and unites in a strange fashion solemnity,
playfulness, and ecstatic delight. No other air, perhaps, shows so
perfectly the reverent gaiety of the carol spirit.

The fifteenth century produced a realistic type of German carol. Here is
the beginning of one such:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Da Jesu Krist geboren wart,</span>  
<span class="i2">do was es kalt;</span>  
<span class="i2">in ain klaines kripplein</span>  
<span class="i2">er geleget wart.</span>  
<span class="i2">Da stunt ain esel und ain rint,</span>  
<span class="i2">die atmizten über das hailig kint</span>  
<span class="i2">gar unverborgen.</span>  
<span class="i2">Der ain raines herze hat, der darf nit
sorgen.”﻿ [20](crt24.htm#Footnote_20.md)<span
id="FNanchor_20"></span>﻿ [2-22](crt22.htm#Note_2-22.md)<span
id="Nanchor_2-22"></span> </span>  

</div>

</div>

It goes on to tell in naïve language the story of the wanderings of the
Holy Family during the Flight into Egypt.

This carol type lasted, and continued to develop, in Austria and the
Catholic parts of Germany through the sixteenth, seventeenth, and
eighteenth centuries, and even in the nineteenth. In Carinthia in the
early nineteenth century, almost every parish had its local poet, who
added new songs to the old treasury.﻿ [2-23](crt22.htm#Note_2-23.md)<span
id="Nanchor_2-23"></span> Particularly popular were the *Hirtenlieder*
or shepherd songs, in which the peasant worshippers joined themselves to
the shepherds of Bethlehem, and sought to share their devout <span
id="page_46">p. 46</span> <span id="Page_46"></span>emotions. Often
these carols are of the most rustic character and in the broadest
dialect. They breathe forth a great kindliness and homeliness, and one
could fill pages with quotations. Two more short extracts must, however,
suffice to show their quality.

How warm and hearty is their feeling for the Child:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Du herzliabste Muater, gib Acht auf dös
Kind,</span>  
<span class="i2">Es is ja gar frostig, thuas einfatschen
gschwind.</span>  
<span class="i2">Und du alter Voda, decks Kindlein schen zua,</span>  
<span class="i2">Sonst hats von der Kölden und Winden kan Ruah.</span>  
<span class="i2">Hiazt nemen mir Urlaub, o gettliches Kind,</span>  
<span class="i2">Thua unser gedenken, verzeich unser Sünd.</span>  
<span class="i2">Es freut uns von Herzen dass d'ankomen bist;</span>  
<span class="i2">Es hätt uns ja niemand zu helfen
gewist.”﻿ [21](crt24.htm#Footnote_21.md)<span
id="FNanchor_21"></span>﻿ [2-24](crt22.htm#Note_2-24.md)<span
id="Nanchor_2-24"></span> </span>  

</div>

</div>

And what fatherly affection is here:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Das Kind is in der Krippen glögn,</span>  
<span class="i2">So herzig und so rar!</span>  
<span class="i2">Mei klâner Hansl war nix dgögn,</span>  
<span class="i2">Wenn a glei schener war.</span>  
<span class="i2">Kolschwarz wie d'Kirchen d'Augen sein,</span>

<span class="i2">Liess i brav hoazen ein,</span>

id="FNanchor_22"></span>﻿ [2-25](crt22.htm#Note_2-25.md)<span
id="Nanchor_2-25"></span> </span>  

</div>

</div>

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span> <span id="Page_47"></span>We have been
following on German ground a mediaeval tradition that has continued
unbroken down to modern days; but we must now take a leap backward in
time, and consider the beginnings of the Christmas carol in England.

Not till the fifteenth century is there any outburst of Christmas poetry
in English, though other forms of religious lyrics were produced in
considerable numbers in the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries.
When the carols come at last, they appear in the least likely of all
places, at the end of a versifying of the whole duty of man, by John
Awdlay, a blind chaplain of Haghmon, in Shropshire. In red letters he
writes:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“I pray you, sirus, boothe moore and lase,</span>  
<span class="i2">Sing these caroles in Cristëmas,”</span>  

</div>

</div>

and then follows a collection of twenty-five songs, some of which are
genuine Christmas carols, as one now understands the
word.﻿ [2-26](crt22.htm#Note_2-26.md)<span id="Nanchor_2-26"></span>

A carol, in the modern English sense, may perhaps be defined as a
religious song, less formal and solemn than the ordinary Church hymn﻿—an
expression of popular and often naïve devotional feeling, a thing
intended to be sung outside rather than within church walls. There still
linger about the word some echoes of its original meaning, for “carol”
had at first a secular or even pagan significance: in twelfth-century
France it was used to describe the amorous song-dance which hailed the
coming of spring; in Italian it meant a ring- or song-dance; while by
English writers from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century it was used
chiefly of singing joined with dancing, and had no necessary connection
with religion. Much as the mediaeval Church, with its ascetic
tendencies, disliked religious dancing, it could not always suppress it;
and in Germany, as we shall see, there was choral dancing at Christmas
round the cradle of the Christ Child. Whether Christmas carols were ever
danced to in England <span id="page_48">p. 48</span> <span
id="Page_48"></span>is doubtful; many of the old airs and words have,
however, a glee and playfulness as of human nature following its natural
instincts of joy even in the celebration of the most sacred mysteries.
It is probable that some of the carols are religious parodies of
love-songs, written for the melodies of the originals, and many seem by
their structure to be indirectly derived from the choral dances of farm
folk, a notable feature being their burden or refrain, a survival of the
common outcry of the dancers as they leaped around.

Awdlay's carols are perhaps meant to be sung by “wassailing neighbours,
who make their rounds at Christmastide to drink a cup and take a gift,
and bring good fortune upon the house”﻿ [2-27](crt22.htm#Note_2-27.md)<span
id="Nanchor_2-27"></span> ﻿—predecessors of those carol-singers of rural
England in the nineteenth century, whom Mr. Hardy depicts so
delightfully in “Under the Greenwood Tree.” Carol-singing by a band of
men who go from house to house is probably a Christianization of such
heathen processions as we shall meet in less altered forms in Part II.

It must not be supposed that the carols Awdlay gives are his own work;
and their exact date it is impossible to determine. Part of his book was
composed in 1426, but one at least of the carols was probably written in
the last half of the fourteenth century. They seem indeed to be the
later blossomings of the great springtime of English literature, the
period which produced Chaucer and Langland, an innumerable company of
minstrels and ballad-makers, and the mystical poet, Richard Rolle of
Hampole.﻿ [23](crt24.htm#Footnote_23.md)<span id="FNanchor_23"></span>

Through the fifteenth century and the first half of the sixteenth, the
flowering continued; and something like two hundred carols of this
period are known. It is impossible to attempt here anything like
representative quotation; I can only sketch in <span id="page_49">p.
49</span> <span id="Page_49"></span>roughest outline the main
characteristics of English carol literature, and refer the reader for
examples to Miss Edith Rickert's comprehensive collection, “Ancient
English Carols, MCCCC-MDCC,” or to the smaller but fine selection in
Messrs. E. K. Chambers and F. Sidgwick's “Early English Lyrics.” Many
may have been the work of *goliards* or wandering scholars, and a common
feature is the interweaving of Latin with English words.

Some, like the exquisite “I sing of a maiden that is
makeles,”﻿ [2-29](crt22.htm#Note_2-29.md)<span id="Nanchor_2-29"></span>
are rather songs to or about the Virgin than strictly Christmas carols;
the Annunciation rather than the Nativity is their theme. Others again
tell the whole story of Christ's life. The feudal idea is strong in such
lines as these:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Mary is quene of allë thinge,</span>  
<span class="i2">And her sone a lovely kinge.</span>  
<span class="i2">God graunt us allë good endinge!</span>  
<span class="i5">*Regnat dei gracia*.”﻿ [2-30](crt22.htm#Note_2-30.md)<span
id="Nanchor_2-30"></span> </span>  

</div>

</div>

On the whole, in spite of some mystical exceptions, the mediaeval
English carol is somewhat external in its religion; there is little deep
individual feeling; the caroller sings as a member of the human race,
whose curse is done away, whose nature is exalted by the Incarnation,
rather than as one whose soul is athirst for God:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Now man is brighter than the sonne;</span>  
<span class="i2">Now man in heven an hie shall wonne;</span>  
<span class="i2">Blessëd be God this game is begonne</span>  
<span class="i3">And his moder emperesse of
helle.”﻿ [2-31](crt22.htm#Note_2-31.md)<span id="Nanchor_2-31"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

Salvation is rather an objective external thing than an inward and
spiritual process. A man has but to pray devoutly to the dear Mother and
Child, and they will bring him to the heavenly court. It is not so much
personal sin as an evil influence in humanity, that is cured by the
great event of Christmas:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“It was dark, it was dim,</span>  
<span class="i2">For men that levëd in gret sin;</span>  
<span class="i2">Lucifer was all within,</span>  
<span class="i3">Till on the Cristmes day.<span id="page_50">p.
50</span> <span id="Page_50"></span></span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">There was weping, there was wo,</span>  
<span class="i2">For every man to hell gan go.</span>  
<span class="i2">It was litel mery tho,</span>  
<span class="i3">Till on the Cristmes
day.”﻿ [2-32](crt22.htm#Note_2-32.md)<span id="Nanchor_2-32"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

But now that Christ is born, and man redeemed, one may be blithe
indeed:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Jhesus is that childës name,</span>  
<span class="i2">Maide and moder is his dame,</span>  
<span class="i2">And so oure sorow is turned to game.</span>  
<span class="i5">*Gloria tibi domine.*</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">\*       \*       \*       \*       \*</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Now sitte we downe upon our knee,</span>  
<span class="i2">And pray that child that is so free;</span>  
<span class="i2">And with gode hertë now sing we</span>  
<span class="i5">*Gloria tibi
domine*.”﻿ [2-33](crt22.htm#Note_2-33.md)<span id="Nanchor_2-33"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

Sometimes the religious spirit almost vanishes, and the carol becomes
little more than a gay pastoral song:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“The shepard upon a hill he satt;</span>  
<span class="i2">He had on him his tabard and his hat,</span>  
<span class="i2">His tar-box, his pipe, and his flagat;</span>  
<span class="i2">His name was called Joly Joly Wat,</span>  
<span class="i3">For he was a gud herdës boy.</span>  
<span class="i9">Ut hoy!</span>  
<span class="i3">For in his pipe he made so much joy.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Whan Wat to Bedlem cum was,</span>  
<span class="i2">He swet, he had gone faster than a pace;</span>  
<span class="i2">He found Jesu in a simpell place,</span>  
<span class="i2">Betwen an ox and an asse.</span>  
<span class="i9">Ut hoy!</span>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">‘Jesu, I offer to thee here my pipe,</span>  
<span class="i2">My skirt, my tar-box, and my scripe;</span>  
<span class="i2">Home to my felowes now will I skipe,</span>  
<span class="i2">And also look unto my shepe.’</span>  
<span class="i9">Ut hoy!</span>  
<span class="i3">For in his pipe he made so much
joy.”﻿ [2-34](crt22.htm#Note_2-34.md)<span id="Nanchor_2-34"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span> <span id="Page_51"></span>But to others
again, especially the lullabies, the hardness of the Nativity, the
shadow of the coming Passion, give a deep note of sorrow and pathos;
there is the thought of the sword that shall pierce Mary's bosom:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“This endris night I saw a sight,</span>  
<span class="i3">A maid a cradell kepe,</span>  
<span class="i2">And ever she song and seid among</span>  
<span class="i3">‘Lullay, my child, and slepe.’</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">‘I may not slepe, but I may wepe,</span>  
<span class="i3">I am so wo begone;</span>  
<span class="i2">Slepe I wold, but I am colde</span>  
<span class="i3">And clothës have I none.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">\*       \*       \*       \*       \*</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">‘Adam's gilt this man had spilt;</span>  
<span class="i3">That sin greveth me sore.</span>  
<span class="i2">Man, for thee here shall I be</span>  
<span class="i3">Thirty winter and more.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">\*       \*       \*       \*       \*</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">‘Here shall I be hanged on a tree,</span>  
<span class="i3">And die as it is skill.</span>  
<span class="i2">That I have bought lesse will I nought;</span>  
<span class="i3">It is my fader's

</span>  

</div>

</div>

The lullabies are quite the most delightful, as they are the most human,
of the carols. Here is an exquisitely musical verse from one of 1530:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“In a dream late as I lay,</span>  
<span class="i2">Methought I heard a maiden say</span>  
<span class="i3">And speak these words so mild:</span>  
<span class="i2">‘My little son, with thee I play,</span>  
<span class="i2">And come,’ she sang, ‘by, lullaby.’</span>  
<span class="i3">Thus rockëd she her child.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">*By-by, lullaby, by-by, lullaby,*</span>
