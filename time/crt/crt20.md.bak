THE EPIPHANY IN FLORENCE.

</div>

### <span class="smcap">The Epiphany.</span>

Though the Epiphany has ceased to be a popular festival in England, it
was once a very high day indeed, and in many parts of Europe it is still
attended by folk-customs of great
interest.﻿ [116](crt24.htm#Footnote_116.md)<span id="FNanchor_116"></span>
For the peasant of Tyrol, indeed, it is New Year's Day, the first of
January being kept only by the townsfolk and modernized
people.﻿ [17-1](crt22.htm#Note_17-1.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-1"></span>

To Englishmen perhaps the best known feature of the secular festival is
the Twelfth Cake. Some words of Leigh Hunt's will show what an important
place this held in the mid-nineteenth century:﻿—

> “Christmas goes out in fine style,﻿—with Twelfth Night. It is a finish
> worthy of the time. Christmas Day was the morning of the season; New
> Year's Day the middle of it, or noon; Twelfth Night is the night,
> brilliant with innumerable planets of Twelfth-cakes. The whole island
> keeps court; nay, all Christendom. All the world are <span
> id="page_338">p. 338</span> <span id="Page_338"></span>kings and
> queens. Everybody is somebody else, and learns at once to laugh at,
> and to tolerate, characters different from his own, by enacting them.
> Cakes, characters, forfeits, lights, theatres, merry rooms, little
> holiday-faces, and, last not least, the painted sugar on the cakes, so
> bad to eat but so fine to look at, useful because it is perfectly
> useless except for a sight and a moral﻿—all conspire to throw a giddy
> splendour over the last night of the season, and to send it to bed in
> pomp and colours, like a Prince.”﻿ [17-2](crt22.htm#Note_17-2.md)<span
> id="Nanchor_17-2"></span>

For seventeenth-century banqueting customs and the connection of the
cake with the “King of the Bean” Herrick may be quoted:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">“Now, now the mirth comes</span>  
<span class="i3">With the cake full of plums,</span>  
<span class="i2">Where bean's the king of the sport here;</span>  
<span class="i3">Besides we must know,</span>  
<span class="i3">The pea also</span>  
<span class="i2">Must revel as queen in the court here.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i3">Begin then to choose</span>  
<span class="i3">This night as ye use,</span>  
<span class="i2">Who shall for the present delight here</span>  
<span class="i3">Be a king by the lot,</span>  
<span class="i3">And who shall not</span>  
<span class="i2">Be Twelfth-day queen for the night here</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i3">Which known, let us make</span>  
<span class="i3">Joy-sops with the cake;</span>  
<span class="i2">And let not a man then be seen here,</span>  
<span class="i3">Who unurg'd will not drink,</span>  
<span class="i3">To the base from the brink,</span>  
<span class="i2">A health to the king and the queen
here.”﻿ [17-3](crt22.htm#Note_17-3.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-3"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

There are many English references to the custom of electing a Twelfth
Day monarch by means of a bean or pea, and this “king” is mentioned in
royal accounts as early as the reign of Edward
II.﻿ [17-4](crt22.htm#Note_17-4.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-4"></span> He
appears, however, to have been even more popular in France than in
England.

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span> <span id="Page_339"></span>The method
of choosing the Epiphany king is thus described by the sixteenth-century
writer, Étienne Pasquier:﻿—

> “When the cake has been cut into as many portions as there are guests,
> a small child is put under the table, and is interrogated by the
> master under the name of Phebé \[Phoebus\], as if he were a child who
> in the innocence of his age represented a kind of Apollo's oracle. To
> this questioning the child answers with a Latin word: *Domine*.
> Thereupon the master calls on him to say to whom he shall give the
> piece of cake which he has in his hand: the child names whoever comes
> into his head, without respect of persons, until the portion where the
> bean is given out. He who gets it is reckoned king of the company,
> although he may be a person of the least importance. This done,
> everyone eats, drinks, and dances
> heartily.”﻿ [17-5](crt22.htm#Note_17-5.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-5"></span>

In Berry at the end of the festive repast a cake is brought before the
head of the household, and divided into as many portions as there are
guests, plus one. The youngest member of the family distributes them.
The portion remaining is called *la part du bon Dieu* and is given to
the first person who asks for it. A band of children generally come to
claim it, with a leader who sings a little
song.﻿ [17-6](crt22.htm#Note_17-6.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-6"></span> There
was formerly a custom of dressing up a king in full robes. He had a fool
to amuse him during the feast, and shots were fired when he
drank.﻿ [17-7](crt22.htm#Note_17-7.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-7"></span>

Here is a nineteenth-century account from Lorraine:﻿—

> “On the Vigil of the Epiphany all the family and the guests assemble
> round the table, which is illuminated by a lamp hanging above its
> centre. Lots are cast for the king of the feast, and if the head of
> anyone present casts no shadow on the wall it is a sign that he will
> die during the year. Then the king chooses freely his queen: they have
> the place of honour, and each time they raise their glasses to their
> mouths cries of ‘The king drinks, the queen drinks!’ burst forth on
> all sides.... The next day an enormous cake, divided into equal
> portions, is distributed to the company by the youngest boy. The first
> portion is always for *le bon Dieu*, the second for the Blessed Virgin
> (these two portions are always given to the first poor person who
> presents himself); then come those of relations, servants, and
> visitors. He who finds a bean in his portion is proclaimed king; if it
> is a lady she chooses her <span id="page_340">p. 340</span> <span
> id="Page_340"></span>king, and he invites the company to a banquet on
> the Sunday following, at which black kings are made by rubbing the
> face with a burnt cork.”﻿ [17-8](crt22.htm#Note_17-8.md)<span
> id="Nanchor_17-8"></span>

The use of the *gâteau des Rois* goes pretty far back. At the monastery
of Mont-St.-Michel in the thirteenth century the Epiphany king was
chosen from among the monks by means of a number of cakes in one of
which a bean was placed. At Matins, High Mass, and Vespers he sat upon a
special throne.﻿ [17-9](crt22.htm#Note_17-9.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-9"></span>

It may be added that there is a quaint old story of a curate “who having
taken his preparations over evening, when all men cry (as the manner is)
*the king drinketh*, chanting his Masse the next morning, fell asleep in
his Memento: and, when he awoke, added with a loud voice, *The king
drinketh*.”﻿ [17-10](crt22.htm#Note_17-10.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-10"></span>

One more French “king” custom may be mentioned, though it relates to
Christmas Day, not Epiphany. At Salers in the centre of France there
were formerly a king and queen whose function was to preside over the
festival, sit in a place of honour in church, and go first in the
procession. The kingship was not elective, but was sold by auction at
the church door, and it is said to have been so much coveted that worthy
citizens would sell their heritage in order to purchase
it.﻿ [17-11](crt22.htm#Note_17-11.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-11"></span>

It may be remarked that Epiphany kings and cakes similar to the French
can be traced in Holland and
Germany,﻿ [17-12](crt22.htm#Note_17-12.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-12"></span>
and that the “King of the Bean” is known in modern Italy, though there
he may be an importation from the
north.﻿ [17-13](crt22.htm#Note_17-13.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-13"></span>

How is this merry monarch to be accounted for? His resemblance to the
king of the *Saturnalia*, who presided over the fun of the feast in the
days of imperial Rome, is certainly striking, but it is impossible to
say whether he derives directly from that personage. No doubt his
association with the feast of the Three Kings has helped to maintain his
rule. As for the bean, it appears to have been a sacred vegetable in
ancient times. There is a story about the philosopher Pythagoras, how,
when flying before a host of rebels, he came upon a field of beans and
refused to pass through it for fear of crushing the plants, thus
enabling his pursuers to overtake him. Moreover, the *flamen dialis* in
Rome was forbidden to eat or even name the vegetable, and the <span
id="page_341">p. 341</span> <span id="Page_341"></span>name of the
Fabii, a Roman *gens*, suggests a totem tribe of the
bean.﻿ [17-14](crt22.htm#Note_17-14.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-14"></span>

In eastern Europe, though I know of no election of a king, there are New
Year customs with cakes, closely resembling some of the French practices
described a page or two back. “St. Basil's Cake” on New Year's Eve in
Macedonia is a kind of shortbread with a silver coin and a cross of
green twigs in it. When all are seated round the table the father and
mother take the cake, “and break it into two pieces, which are again
subdivided by the head of the family into shares. The first portion is
destined for St. Basil, the Holy Virgin, or the patron saint whose icon
is in the house. The second stands for the house itself. The third for
the cattle and domestic animals belonging thereto. The fourth for the
inanimate property, and the rest for each member of the household
according to age. Each portion is successively dipped in a cup of wine.”
He who finds the cross or the coin in his share of the cake will prosper
during the year. The money is considered sacred and is used to buy a
votive taper.﻿ [17-15](crt22.htm#Note_17-15.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-15"></span>

In Macedonia when the New Year's supper is over, the table, with the
remnants of the feast upon it, is removed to a corner of the room in
order that St. Basil may come and partake of the
food.﻿ [17-16](crt22.htm#Note_17-16.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-16"></span> He
appears to have been substituted by the Church for the spirits of the
departed, for whom, as we have seen, food is left in the West on All
Souls’ and Christmas Eves. Probably the Macedonian practice of setting
aside a portion of the cake for a saint, and the pieces cut in France
for *le bon Dieu* and the Virgin or the three Magi, have a like origin.
One may compare them with the Serbian breaking of the *kolatch* cake in
honour of Christ “the Patron Namegiver.” Is it irrelevant, also, to
mention here the Greek Church custom, at the preparation of the elements
for the Eucharist, of breaking portions of the bread in memory of the
Virgin and other saints?

In many countries the Epiphany is a special time for the expulsion of
evils. At Brunnen in Switzerland boys go about in procession on Twelfth
Night, with torches and lanterns, and make a great noise with horns,
bells, whips, &c., in order to <span id="page_342">p. 342</span> <span
id="Page_342"></span>frighten away two wood-spirits. In Labruguière in
southern France on the Eve of Twelfth Day the inhabitants rush through
the streets, making discordant noises and a huge uproar, with the object
of scaring away ghosts and devils.﻿ [17-17](crt22.htm#Note_17-17.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-17"></span>

In parts of the eastern Alps there takes place what is called
*Berchtenlaufen*. Lads, formerly to the number of two or three hundred,
rush about in the strangest masks, with cowbells, whips, and all sorts
of weapons, and shout wildly.﻿ [17-18](crt22.htm#Note_17-18.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-18"></span> In Nuremberg up to the year 1616 on
*Bergnacht* or Epiphany Eve boys and girls used to run about the streets
and knock loudly at the doors.﻿ [17-19](crt22.htm#Note_17-19.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-19"></span> Such knocking, as we have seen, may well have
been intended to drive away spirits from the houses.

At Eschenloh near Partenkirchen in Upper Bavaria three women used to
*berchten* on that evening. They all had linen bags over their heads,
with holes for the mouth and eyes. One carried a chain, another a rake,
and the third a broom. Going round to the houses, they knocked on the
door with the chain, scraped the ground with the rake, and made a noise
of sweeping with the broom.﻿ [17-20](crt22.htm#Note_17-20.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-20"></span> The suggestion of a clearing away of evils is
here very strong.

In connection with the *Kallikantzaroi* mention has already been made of
the purification of houses with holy water, performed by Greek priests
on the Epiphany. In Roumania, where a similar sprinkling is performed, a
curious piece of imitative magic is added﻿—the priest is invited to sit
upon the bed, in order that the brooding hen may sit upon her eggs.
Moreover there should be maize grains under the mattress; then the hen
will lay eggs in abundance.﻿ [17-21](crt22.htm#Note_17-21.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-21"></span>

We noted in an earlier chapter the name *Berchtentag* applied in
southern Germany and in Austria to the Epiphany, and we saw also how the
mysterious Frau Berchta was specially connected with the day. On the
Epiphany and its Eve in the Möllthal in Carinthia a female figure, “the
Berchtel,” goes the round of the houses. She is generally dressed in a
hide, wears a hideous wooden mask, and hops wildly about, inquiring as
to the behaviour of children, and demanding
gifts.﻿ [17-22](crt22.htm#Note_17-22.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-22"></span>

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span> <span id="Page_343"></span>Something
of the terrible, as well as the beneficent, belongs to the “Befana,” the
Epiphany visitor who to Italian children is the great gift-bringer of
the year, the Santa Klaus of the South. “Delightful,” say Countess
Martinengo, “as are the treasures she puts in their shoes when satisfied
with their behaviour, she is credited with an unpleasantly sharp eye for
youthful transgressions.”﻿ [17-23](crt22.htm#Note_17-23.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-23"></span> Mothers will sometimes warn their children
that if they are naughty the Befana will fetch and eat them. To Italian
youngsters she is a very real being, and her coming on Epiphany Eve is
looked forward to with the greatest anxiety. Though she puts playthings
and sweets in the stockings of good children, she has nothing but a
birch and coal for those who misbehave
themselves.﻿ [17-24](crt22.htm#Note_17-24.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-24"></span>

Formerly at Florence images of the Befana were put up in the windows of
houses, and there were processions through the streets, guys being borne
about, with a great blowing of
trumpets.﻿ [17-25](crt22.htm#Note_17-25.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-25"></span>
Toy trumpets are still the delight of little boys at the Epiphany in
Italy.

The Befana's name is obviously derived from *Epiphania*. In Naples the
little old woman who fills children's stockings is called “Pasqua
Epiphania,”﻿ [117](crt24.htm#Footnote_117.md)<span
id="FNanchor_117"></span> the northern contraction not having been
acclimatized there.﻿ [17-26](crt22.htm#Note_17-26.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-26"></span>

In Spain as well as Italy the Epiphany is associated with presents for
children, but the gift-bringers for little Spaniards are the Three Holy
Kings themselves. There is an old Spanish tradition that the Magi go
every year to Bethlehem to adore the infant Jesus, and on their way
visit children, leaving sweets and toys for them if they have behaved
well. On Epiphany Eve the youngsters go early to bed, put out their
shoes on the window-sill or balcony to be filled with presents by the
Wise Men, and provide a little straw for their
horses.﻿ [17-27](crt22.htm#Note_17-27.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-27"></span>

It is, or was, a custom in Madrid to look out for the Kings on Epiphany
Eve. Companies of men go out with bells and pots and pans, and make a
great noise. There is loud shouting, and torches cast a fantastic light
upon the scene. One of the men carries a large ladder, and mounts it to
see if the Kings are <span id="page_344">p. 344</span> <span
id="Page_344"></span>coming. Here, perhaps, some devil-scaring rite,
resembling those described above, has been
half-Christianized.﻿ [17-28](crt22.htm#Note_17-28.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-28"></span>

In Provence, too, there was a custom of going to meet the Magi. In a
charming chapter of his Memoirs Mistral tells us how on Epiphany Eve all
the children of his countryside used to go out to meet the Kings,
bearing cakes for the Magi, dried figs for their pages, and handfuls of
hay for their horses. In the glory and colour of the sunset young
Mistral thought he saw the splendid train; but soon the gorgeous vision
died away, and the children stood gaping alone on the darkening
highway﻿—the Kings had passed behind the mountain. After supper the
little ones hurried to church, and there in the Chapel of the Nativity
beheld the Kings in adoration before the
Crib.﻿ [17-29](crt22.htm#Note_17-29.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-29"></span>

At Trest not only did the young people carry baskets or dried fruit, but
there were three men dressed as Magi to receive the offerings and accept
compliments addressed to them by an orator. In return they presented him
with a purse full of counters, upon which he rushed off with the
treasure and was pursued by the others in a sort of
dance.﻿ [17-30](crt22.htm#Note_17-30.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-30"></span>
Here again the Magi are evidently mixed up with something that has no
relation to Christianity.

We noted in  [IV](crt07.htm#Chapter_IV.md) the elaborate ceremonies
connected in Greece with the Blessing of the Waters at the Epiphany, and
the custom of diving for a cross. It would seem, as was pointed out,
that the latter is an ecclesiastically sanctioned form of a
folk-ceremony. This is found in a purer state in Macedonia, where, after
Matins on the Epiphany, it is the custom to thrust some one into water,
be it sea or river, pond or well. On emerging he has to sprinkle the
bystanders.﻿ [17-31](crt22.htm#Note_17-31.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-31"></span> The rite may be compared with the drenchings
of human beings in order to produce rain described by Dr. Frazer in “The
Magic Art.”﻿ [17-32](crt22.htm#Note_17-32.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-32"></span>

Another Greek custom combines the purifying powers of Epiphany water
with the fertilizing influences of the Christmas log﻿—round Mount
Olympos ashes are taken from the hearth where a cedar log has been
burning since Christmas, and are baptized in the blessed water of the
river. They are then borne <span id="page_345">p. 345</span> <span
id="Page_345"></span>to the vineyards, and thrown at their four corners,
and also at the foot of apple- and
fig-trees.﻿ [17-33](crt22.htm#Note_17-33.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-33"></span>

This may remind us that in England fruit-trees used to come in for
special treatment on the Vigil of the Epiphany. In Devonshire the farmer
and his men would go to the orchard with a large jug of cider, and drink
the following toast at the foot of one of the best-bearing apple-trees,
firing guns in conclusion:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i5">“Here's to thee, old apple-tree,</span>  
<span class="i2">Whence thou may'st bud, and whence thou may'st
blow!</span>  
<span class="i2">And whence thou may'st bear apples enow!</span>  
<span class="i6">Hats full! caps full!</span>  
<span class="i6">Bushel!﻿—bushel﻿—sacks full,</span>  
<span class="i6">And my pockets full too!
Huzza!”﻿ [17-34](crt22.htm#Note_17-34.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-34"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

In seventeenth-century Somersetshire, according to Aubrey, a piece of
toast was put upon the roots.﻿ [17-35](crt22.htm#Note_17-35.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-35"></span> According to another account each person in
the company used to take a cupful of cider, with roasted apples pressed
into it, drink part of the contents, and throw the rest at the
tree.﻿ [17-36](crt22.htm#Note_17-36.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-36"></span> The
custom is described by Herrick as a Christmas Eve ceremony:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Wassail the trees, that they may bear</span>  
<span class="i2">You many a plum and many a pear;</span>  
<span class="i2">For more or less fruits they will bring,</span>  
<span class="i2">As you do give them
wassailing.”﻿ [17-37](crt22.htm#Note_17-37.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-37"></span> </span>  

</div>

</div>

In Sussex the wassailing (or “worsling”) of fruit-trees took place on
Christmas Eve, and was accompanied by a trumpeter blowing on a cow's
horn.﻿ [17-38](crt22.htm#Note_17-38.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-38"></span>

The wassailing of the trees may be regarded as either originally an
offering to their spirits or﻿—and this seems more probable﻿—as a
sacramental act intended to bring fertilizing influences to bear upon
them. Customs of a similar character are found in Continental countries
during the Christmas season. In Tyrol, for instance, when the Christmas
pies are a-making on St. Thomas's Eve, the maids are told to go
out-of-doors and put their arms, sticky with paste, round the
fruit-trees, in order that they <span id="page_346">p. 346</span> <span
id="Page_346"></span>may bear well next
year.﻿ [17-39](crt22.htm#Note_17-39.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-39"></span> The
uses of the ashes of the Christmas log have already been noticed.

Sometimes, as in the Thurgau, Mecklenburg, Oldenburg, and Tyrol, the
trees are beaten to make them bear. On New Year's Eve at Hildesheim
people dance and sing around them,﻿ [17-40](crt22.htm#Note_17-40.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-40"></span> while the Tyrolese peasant on Christmas Eve
will go out to his trees, and, knocking with bent fingers upon them,
will bid them wake up and bear.﻿ [17-41](crt22.htm#Note_17-41.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-41"></span> There is a Slavonic custom, on the same
night, of threatening apple-trees with a hatchet if they do not produce
fruit during the year.﻿ [17-42](crt22.htm#Note_17-42.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-42"></span>

Another remarkable agricultural rite was practised on Epiphany Eve in
Herefordshire and Gloucestershire. The farmer and his servants would
meet in a field sown with wheat, and there light thirteen fires, with
one larger than the rest. Round this a circle was formed by the company,
and all would drink a glass of cider to the success of the
harvest.﻿ [118](crt24.htm#Footnote_118.md)<span id="FNanchor_118"></span>
This done, they returned to the farm, to feast﻿—in Gloucestershire﻿—on
cakes made with caraways, and soaked in cider. The Herefordshire
accounts give particulars of a further ceremony. A large cake was
provided, with a hole in the middle, and after supper everyone went to
the wain-house. The master filled a cup with strong ale, and standing
opposite the finest ox, pledged him in a curious toast; the company
followed his example with the other oxen, addressing each by name.
Afterwards the large cake was put on the horn of the first
ox.﻿ [17-43](crt22.htm#Note_17-43.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-43"></span>

It is extremely remarkable, and can scarcely be a mere coincidence, that
far away among the southern Slavs, as we saw in
 [XII](crt16.htm#Chapter_XII.md), a Christmas cake with a hole in its
centre is likewise put upon the horn of the chief ox. The wassailing of
the animals is found there also. On Christmas Day, Sir Arthur <span
id="page_347">p. 347</span> <span id="Page_347"></span>Evans relates,
the house-mother “entered the stall set apart for the goats, and having
first sprinkled them with corn, took the wine-cup in her hand and said,
‘Good morning, little mother! The Peace of God be on thee! Christ is
born; of a truth He is born. May'st thou be healthy. I drink to thee in
wine; I give thee a pomegranate; may'st thou meet with all good luck!’
She then lifted the cup to her lips, took a sup, tossed the pomegranate
among the herd, and throwing her arms round the she-goat, whose health
she had already drunk, gave it the ‘Peace of God’﻿—kissed it, that is,
over and over again.” The same ceremony was then performed for the
benefit of the sheep and cows, and all the animals were beaten with a
leafy olive-branch.﻿ [17-44](crt22.htm#Note_17-44.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-44"></span>

As for the fires, an Irish custom to some extent supplies a parallel. On
Epiphany Eve a sieve of oats was set up, “and in it a dozen of candles
set round, and in the centre one larger, all lighted.” This was said to
be in memory of the Saviour and His apostles, lights of the
world.﻿ [17-45](crt22.htm#Note_17-45.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-45"></span>
Here is an account of a similar custom practised in Co. Leitrim:﻿—

> “A piece of board is covered with cow-dung, and twelve rushlights are
> stuck therein. These are sprinkled with ash at the top, to make them
> light easily, and then set alight, each being named by some one
> present, and as each dies so will the life of its owner. A ball is
> then made of the dung, and it is placed over the door of the cowhouse
> for an increase of cattle. Sometimes mud is used, and the ball placed
> over the door of the
> dwelling-house.”﻿ [17-46](crt22.htm#Note_17-46.md)<span
> id="Nanchor_17-46"></span>

There remains to be considered under Epiphany usages an ancient and very
remarkable game played annually on January 6 at Haxey in Lincolnshire.
It is known traditionally as “Haxey Hood,” and its centre is a struggle
between the men of two villages for the possession of a roll of sacking
or leather called the “hood.” Over it preside the “boggans” or
“bullocks” of Plough Monday (see p.  [352](crt20.htm#Page_352).md), headed
by a figure known as “My Lord,” who is attended by a fool. The
proceedings are opened on the village green by a mysterious speech from
the fool:﻿—

“Now, good folks, this is Haxa’ Hood. We've killed two <span
id="page_348">p. 348</span> <span id="Page_348"></span>bullocks and a
half, but the other half we had to leave running about field: we can
fetch it if it's wanted. Remember it's﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">‘Hoose agin hoose, toon agin toon,</span>  
<span class="i2">And if you meet a man knock him doon.’”</span>  

</div>

</div>

Then, in an open field, the hoods﻿—there are six of them, one apparently
for each of the chief hamlets round﻿—are thrown up and struggled for.
“The object is to carry them off the field away from the boggans. If any
of these can get hold of them, or even touch them, they have to be given
up, and carried back to My Lord. For every one carried off the field the
boggans forfeit half-a-crown, which is spent in beer, doubtless by the
men of the particular hamlet who have carried off the hood.” The great
event of the day is the struggle for the last hood﻿—made of
leather﻿—between the men of Haxey and the men of Westwoodside﻿—“that is
to say really between the customers of the public-houses there﻿—each
party trying to get it to his favourite ‘house.’ The publican at the
successful house stands beer.”﻿ [17-47](crt22.htm#Note_17-47.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-47"></span>

Mr. Chambers regards the fool's strange speech as preserving the
tradition that the hood is the half of a bullock﻿—the head of a
sacrificial victim, and he explains both the Haxey game and also the
familiar games of hockey and football as originating in a struggle
between the people of two villages to get such a head, with all its
fertilizing properties, over their own
boundary.﻿ [17-48](crt22.htm#Note_17-48.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-48"></span>
At Hornchurch in Essex, if we may trust a note given by Hone, an actual
boar's head was wrestled for on Christmas Day, and afterwards feasted
upon at one of the public-houses by the victor and his
friends.﻿ [17-49](crt22.htm#Note_17-49.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-49"></span>

One more feature of the Haxey celebration must be mentioned (it points
apparently to a human sacrifice): the fool, the morning after the game,
used to be “smoked” over a straw fire. “He was suspended above the fire
and swung backwards and forwards over it until almost suffocated; then
allowed to drop into the smouldering straw, which was well wetted, and
to scramble out as he could.”﻿ [17-50](crt22.htm#Note_17-50.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-50"></span>

Returning to the subject of football, I may here condense an <span
id="page_349">p. 349</span> <span id="Page_349"></span>account of a
Welsh Christmas custom quoted by Sir Laurence Gomme, in his book “The
Village Community,” from the *Oswestry Observer* of March 2, 1887:﻿—“In
South Cardiganshire it seems that about eighty years ago the population,
rich and poor, male and female, of opposing parishes, turned out on
Christmas Day and indulged in the game of football with such vigour that
it became little short of a serious fight.” Both in north and south
Wales the custom was found. At one place, Llanwenog near Lampeter, there
was a struggle between two parties with different traditions of race.
The Bros, supposed to be descendants from Irish people, occupied the
high ground of the parish; the Blaenaus, presumably pure-bred Brythons,
occupied the lowlands. After morning service on Christmas Day, “the
whole of the Bros and Blaenaus, rich and poor, male and female,
assembled on the turnpike road which divided the highlands from the
lowlands.” The ball was thrown high in the air, “and when it fell Bros
and Blaenaus scrambled for its possession.... If the Bros, by hook or by
crook, could succeed in taking the ball up the mountain to their hamlet
of Rhyddlan they won the day, while the Blaenaus were successful if they
got the ball to their end of the parish at New Court.” Many severe kicks
were given, and the whole thing was taken so keenly “that a Bro or a
Blaenau would as soon lose a cow from his cowhouse as the football from
his portion of the parish.” There is plainly more than a mere pastime
here; the thing appears to have been originally a struggle between two
clans.﻿ [17-51](crt22.htm#Note_17-51.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-51"></span>

Anciently the Carnival, with its merrymaking before the austerities of
Lent, was held to begin at the Epiphany. This was the case in Tyrol even
in the nineteenth century.﻿ [17-52](crt22.htm#Note_17-52.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-52"></span> As a rule, however, the Carnival in Roman
Catholic countries is restricted to the last three days before Ash
Wednesday. The pagan origin of its mummeries and licence is evident, but
it is a spring rather than a winter festival, and hardly calls for
treatment here.

The Epiphany is in many places the end of Christmas. In Calvados,
Normandy, it is marked by bonfires; red flames mount <span
id="page_350">p. 350</span> <span id="Page_350"></span>skywards, and the
peasants join hands, dance, and leap through blinding smoke and cinders,
shouting these rude lines:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Àdieu les Rois</span>  
<span class="i2">Jusqu’à douze mois,</span>  
<span class="i2">Douze mois passés</span>  
<span class="i2">Les bougelées.”﻿ [17-53](crt22.htm#Note_17-53.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-53"></span> </span>  

</div>

</div>

Another French Epiphany *chanson*, translated by the Rev. R. L. Gales,
is a charming farewell to Christmas:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Noël is leaving us,</span>  
<span class="i2">Sad ‘tis to tell,</span>  
<span class="i2">But he will come again,</span>  
<span class="i2">Adieu, Noël.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Weep as they go:</span>

</span>  

</div>

</div>

### <span class="smcap">Post-Epiphany Festivals.</span>

Though with Twelfth Day the high festival of Christmas generally ends,
later dates have sometimes been assigned as the close of the season. At
the old English court, for instance, the merrymaking was sometimes
carried on until Candlemas, while in some English country places it was
customary, even in the late nineteenth century, to leave Christmas
decorations up, in houses and churches, till that
day.﻿ [17-55](crt22.htm#Note_17-55.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-55"></span> The
whole time between Christmas and the Presentation in the Temple was thus
treated as sacred to the Babyhood of Christ; the withered evergreens
would keep alive memories of Christmas joys, even, sometimes, after
Septuagesima had struck the note of penitence.

Before we pass on to a short notice of Candlemas, we may <span
id="page_351">p. 351</span> <span id="Page_351"></span>glance at a few
last sparks, so to speak, of the Christmas blaze, and then at the
English festivals which marked the resumption of work after the
holidays.

In Sweden Yule is considered to close with the Octave of the Epiphany,
January 13, “St. Knut's Day,” the twentieth after Christmas.

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Twentieth day Knut</span>  
<span class="i2">Driveth Yule out”</span>  

</div>

</div>

sing the old folks as the young people dance in a ring round the festive
Yule board, which is afterwards robbed of the viands that remain on it,
including the Yule boar. On this day a sort of mimic fight used to take
place, the master and servants of the house pretending to drive away the
guests with axe, broom, knife, spoon, and other
implements.﻿ [17-56](crt22.htm#Note_17-56.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-56"></span> The name, “St. Knut's Day,” is apparently due
to the fact that in the laws of Canute the Great (1017-36) it is
commanded that there is to be no fasting from Christmas to the Octave of
the Epiphany.﻿ [17-57](crt22.htm#Note_17-57.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-57"></span>

In England the day after the Epiphany was called St. Distaff's or Rock
Day (the word Rock is evidently the same as the German *Rocken* =
distaff). It was the day when the women resumed their spinning after the
rest and gaiety of Christmas. From a poem of Herrick's it appears that
the men in jest tried to burn the women's flax, and the women in return
poured water on the men:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Partly work, and partly play</span>  
<span class="i2">You must on St. Distaff's day:</span>  
<span class="i2">From the plough soon free your team,</span>  
<span class="i2">Then come home and fother them;</span>  
<span class="i2">If the maids a-spinning go,</span>  
<span class="i2">Burn the flax and fire the tow.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">\*       \*       \*       \*       \*</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Bring in pails of water then,</span>  
<span class="i2">Let the maids bewash the men;</span>  
<span class="i2">Give St. Distaff all the right,</span>  
<span class="i2">Then bid Christmas sport good night;</span>  
<span class="i2">And next morrow, every one</span>  
<span class="i2">To his own
vocation.”﻿ [17-58](crt22.htm#Note_17-58.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-58"></span> </span>  

</div>

</div>

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span> <span id="Page_352"></span>A more
notable occasion was Plough Monday, the first after Twelfth Day. Men's
labour then began again after the
holidays.﻿ [17-59](crt22.htm#Note_17-59.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-59"></span>
We have already seen that it is sometimes associated with the mummers’
plays. Often, however, its ritual is not developed into actual drama,
and the following account from Derbyshire gives a fairly typical
description of its customs:﻿—

> “On Plough Monday the ‘Plough bullocks’ are occasionally seen; they
> consist of a number of young men from various farmhouses, who are
> dressed up in ribbons.... These young men yoke themselves to a plough,
> which they draw about, preceded by a band of music, from house to
> house, collecting money. They are accompanied by the Fool and Bessy;
> the fool being dressed in the skin of a calf, with the tail hanging
> down behind, and Bessy generally a young man in female attire. The
> fool carries an inflated bladder tied to the end of a long stick, by
> way of whip, which he does not fail to apply pretty soundly to the
> heads and shoulders of his team. When anything is given a cry of
> ‘Largess!’ is raised, and a dance performed round the plough. If a
> refusal to their application for money is made they not unfrequently
> plough up the pathway, door-stone, or any other portion of the
> premises they happen to be near.”﻿ [17-60](crt22.htm#Note_17-60.md)<span
> id="Nanchor_17-60"></span>

By Plough Monday we have passed, it seems probable, from New Year
festivals to one that originally celebrated the beginning of spring.
Such a feast, apparently, was kept in mid-February when ploughing began
at that season; later the advance of agriculture made it possible to
shift it forward to early January.﻿ [17-61](crt22.htm#Note_17-61.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-61"></span>

### <span class="smcap">Candlemas.</span>

Nearer to the original date of the spring feast is Candlemas,
February 2; though connected with Christmas by its ecclesiastical
meaning, it is something of a vernal
festival.﻿ [17-62](crt22.htm#Note_17-62.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-62"></span>

The feast of the Purification of the Virgin or Presentation of Christ in
the Temple was probably instituted by Pope Liberius at Rome in the
fourth century. The ceremonial to which it owes its popular name,
Candlemas, is the blessing of candles in church and the procession of
the faithful, carrying them lighted in their hands. During the blessing
the “Nunc dimittis” is chanted, <span id="page_353">p. 353</span> <span
id="Page_353"></span>with the antiphon “Lumen ad revelationem gentium et
gloriam plebis tuae Israel,” the ceremony being thus brought into
connection with the “light to lighten the Gentiles” hymned by Symeon.
Usener has however shown reason for thinking that the Candlemas
procession was not of spontaneous Christian growth, but was inspired by
a desire to Christianize a Roman rite, the *Amburbale*, which took place
at the same season and consisted of a procession round the city with
lighted candles.﻿ [17-63](crt22.htm#Note_17-63.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-63"></span>

The Candlemas customs of the sixteenth century are thus described by
Naogeorgus:

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Then numbers great of Tapers large, both men and
women beare</span>  
<span class="i2">To Church, being halowed there with pomp, and dreadful
words to heare.</span>  
<span class="i2">This done, eche man his Candell lightes, where chiefest
seemeth hee,</span>  
<span class="i2">Whose taper greatest may be seene, and fortunate to
bee,</span>  
<span class="i2">Whose Candell burneth cleare and brighte; a wondrous
force and might</span>  
<span class="i2">Doth in these Candells lie, which if at any time they
light,</span>  
<span class="i2">They sure beleve that neyther storme or tempest dare
abide,</span>  
<span class="i2">Nor thunder in the skies be heard, nor any devils
spide,</span>  
<span class="i2">Nor fearefull sprites that walke by night, nor hurts of
frost or haile.”﻿ [17-64](crt22.htm#Note_17-64.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-64"></span> </span>  

</div>

</div>

Still, in many Roman Catholic regions, the candles blessed in church at
the Purification are believed to have marvellous powers. In Brittany,
Franche-Comté, and elsewhere, they are preserved and lighted in time of
storm or sickness.﻿ [17-65](crt22.htm#Note_17-65.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-65"></span> In Tyrol they are lighted on important family
occasions such as christenings and funerals, as well as on the approach
of a storm﻿ [17-66](crt22.htm#Note_17-66.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-66"></span> ; in Sicily in time of earthquake or when
somebody is dying.﻿ [17-67](crt22.htm#Note_17-67.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-67"></span>

In England some use of candles on this festival continued long after the
Reformation. In 1628 the Bishop of Durham gave serious offence by
sticking up wax candles in his cathedral at the Purification; “the
number of all the candles burnt that evening was two hundred and twenty,
besides sixteen torches; sixty of <span id="page_354">p.
354</span> <span id="Page_354"></span>those burning tapers and torches
standing upon and near the high
Altar.”﻿ [17-68](crt22.htm#Note_17-68.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-68"></span>
Ripon Cathedral, as late as the eighteenth century, was brilliantly
illuminated with candles on the Sunday before the
festival.﻿ [17-69](crt22.htm#Note_17-69.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-69"></span>
And, to come to domestic customs, at Lyme Regis in Dorsetshire the
person who bought the wood-ashes of a family used to send a present of a
large candle at Candlemas. It was lighted at night, and round it there
was festive drinking until its going out gave the signal for retirement
to rest.﻿ [17-70](crt22.htm#Note_17-70.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-70"></span>

There are other British Candlemas customs connected with fire. In the
western isles of Scotland, says an early eighteenth-century writer, “as
Candlemas Day comes round, the mistress and servants of each family
taking a sheaf of oats, dress it up in woman's apparel, and after
putting it in a large basket, beside which a wooden club is placed, they
cry three times, ‘Briid is come! Briid is welcome!’ This they do just
before going to bed, and as soon as they rise in the morning, they look
among the ashes, expecting to see the impression of Briid's club there,
which if they do, they reckon it a true presage of a good crop and
prosperous year, and the contrary they take as an
ill-omen.”﻿ [17-71](crt22.htm#Note_17-71.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-71"></span> Sir Laurence Gomme regards this as an
illustration of belief in a house-spirit whose residence is the hearth
and whose element is the ever-burning sacred flame. He also considers
the Lyme Regis custom mentioned above to be a modernized relic of the
sacred hearth-fire.﻿ [17-72](crt22.htm#Note_17-72.md)<span
id="Nanchor_17-72"></span>

Again, the feast of the Purification was the time to kindle a “brand”
preserved from the Christmas log. Herrick's Candlemas lines may be
recalled:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Kindle the Christmas brand, and then</span>  
<span class="i3">Till sunne-set let it burne;</span>  
<span class="i2">Which quencht, then lay it up agen,</span>  
<span class="i3">Till Christmas next returne.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Part must be kept wherewith to teend</span>  
<span class="i3">The Christmas Log next yeare;</span>  
<span class="i2">And where ‘tis safely kept, the Fiend</span>  
<span class="i3">Can do no mischiefe
there.”﻿ [17-73](crt22.htm#Note_17-73.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-73"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span> <span id="Page_355"></span>Candlemas
Eve was the moment for the last farewells to Christmas; Herrick sings:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“End now the White Loafe and the Pye,</span>  
<span class="i2">And let all sports with Christmas dye,”</span>  

</div>

</div>

and

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Down with the Rosemary and Bayes,</span>  
<span class="i3">Down with the Misleto;</span>  
<span class="i2">Instead of Holly, now up-raise</span>  
<span class="i3">The greener Box for show.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">The Holly hitherto did sway;</span>  
<span class="i3">Let Box now domineere</span>  
<span class="i2">Until the dancing Easter Day,</span>  
<span class="i3">Or Easter's Eve
appeare.”﻿ [17-74](crt22.htm#Note_17-74.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-74"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

An old Shropshire servant, Miss Burne tells us, was wont, when she took
down the holly and ivy on Candlemas Eve, to put snow-drops in their
place.﻿ [17-75](crt22.htm#Note_17-75.md)<span id="Nanchor_17-75"></span> We
may see in this replacing of the winter evergreens by the delicate white
flowers a hint that by Candlemas the worst of the winter is over and
gone; Earth has begun to deck herself with blossoms, and spring, however
feebly, has begun. With Candlemas we, like the older English
countryfolk, may take our leave of Christmas.
