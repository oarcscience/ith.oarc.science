<P>We have already seen a good deal of masking in connection with St. Nicholas, 
Knecht Ruprecht, and other figures of the German Christmas; we may next give 
some attention to English customs of the same sort during the Twelve Days, and 
then pass on to the strange burlesque ceremonies of the Feast of Fools and the 
Boy Bishop, ceremonies which show an intrusion of pagan mummery into the 
sanctuary itself.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN class=smcap>Christmas Masking.</SPAN></H3>
<P>The custom of Christmas masking, &#8220;mumming,&#8221; or &#8220;disguising&#8221; can be traced at 
the English court as early as the reign of Edward III. It is in all probability 
connected with that wearing of beasts&#146; heads and skins of which we have already 
noted various examples&#65279;&#8212;its origin in folk-custom seems to have been the coming 
of a band of worshippers clad in this uncouth but auspicious garb to bring good 
luck to a house.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-1">14-1</A><a name="Nanchor_14-1"></A> The most direct English survival is found in the 
village mummers who still call themselves &#8220;guisers&#8221; or &#8220;geese-dancers&#8221; and claim 
the right to enter every house. These will be dealt with shortly, after a 
consideration of more courtly customs of the same kind.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_298"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 298</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_298"></A>In the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries the 
English court masque reached its greatest developments; the fundamental idea was 
then generally overlaid with splendid trappings, the dresses and the 
arrangements were often extremely elaborate, and the introduction of dialogued 
speech made these &#8220;disguises&#8221; regular dramatic performances. A notable example 
is Ben Jonson's &#8220;Masque of Christmas.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-2">14-2</A><a name="Nanchor_14-2"></A> Shakespeare, however, gives us in &#8220;Henry VIII.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-3">14-3</A><a name="Nanchor_14-3"></A> an example of a simpler impromptu form: the king and a 
party dressed up as shepherds break in upon a banquet of Wolsey's.</P>
<P>In this volume we are more concerned with the popular Christmas than with the 
festivities of kings and courts and grandees. Mention must, however, be made of 
a personage who played an important part in the Christmas of the Tudor court and 
appeared also in colleges, Inns of Court, and the houses of the nobility&#65279;&#8212;the 
&#8220;Lord of Misrule.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-4">14-4</A><a name="Nanchor_14-4"></A> He was annually elected to preside over the revels, 
had a retinue of courtiers, and was surrounded by elaborate ceremonial. He seems 
to be the equivalent and was probably the direct descendant of the &#8220;Abbot&#8221; or 
&#8220;Bishop&#8221; of the Feast of Fools, who will be noticed later in this chapter. 
Sometimes indeed he is actually called &#8220;Abbot of Misrule.&#8221; A parallel to him is 
the Twelfth Night &#8220;king,&#8221; and he appears to be a courtly example of the 
temporary monarch of folk-custom, though his name is sometimes extended to 
&#8220;kings&#8221; of quite vulgar origin elected not by court or gentry but by the common 
people. The &#8220;Lord of Misrule&#8221; was among the relics of paganism most violently 
attacked by Puritan writers like Stubbes and Prynne, and the Great Rebellion 
seems to have been the death of him.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN class=smcap>Mummers&#146; Plays and Morris Dances.</SPAN></H3>
<P>Let us turn now to the rustic Christmas mummers, to-day fast disappearing, 
but common enough in the mid-nineteenth century. Their goings-on are really far 
more interesting, because more traditional, than the elaborate shows and 
dressings-up of the court. Their names vary: &#8220;mummers&#8221; and &#8220;guisers&#8221; are the 
commonest; in Sussex they are &#8220;tipteerers,&#8221; perhaps because of <A NAME="page_299"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 299</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_299"></A>the perquisites they collect, in Cornwall &#8220;geese-dancers&#8221; 
(&#8220;geese&#8221; no doubt comes from &#8220;disguise&#8221;), in Shropshire &#8220;morris&#8221;&#65279;&#8212;or 
&#8220;merry&#8221;&#65279;&#8212;&#8220;dancers.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-5">14-5</A><a name="Nanchor_14-5"></A> It is to be noted that they are unbidden guests, and 
enter your house as of right.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-6">14-6</A><a name="Nanchor_14-6"></A> Sometimes they merely dance, sing, and feast, but 
commonly they perform a rude drama.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-7">14-7</A><a name="Nanchor_14-7"></A> </P>
<P>The plays acted by the mummers&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-8">14-8</A><a name="Nanchor_14-8"></A> vary so much that it is difficult to describe them in 
general terms. There is no reason to suppose that the words are of great 
antiquity&#65279;&#8212;the earliest form may perhaps date from the seventeenth century; they 
appear to be the result of a crude dramatic and literary instinct working upon 
the remains of traditional ritual, and manipulating it for purposes of 
entertainment. The central figure is St. George (occasionally he is called Sir, 
King, or Prince George), and the main dramatic substance, after a prologue and 
introduction of the characters, is a fight and the arrival of a doctor to bring 
back the slain to life. At the close comes a <I>qu&ecirc;te</I> for money. The name 
George is found in all the Christmas plays, but the other characters have a 
bewildering variety of names ranging from Hector and Alexander to Bonaparte and 
Nelson.</P>
<P>Mr. Chambers in two very interesting and elaborately documented chapters has 
traced a connection between these St. George players and the sword-dancers found 
at Christmas or other festivals in Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Sweden, and 
Great Britain. The sword-dance in its simplest form is described by Tacitus in 
his &#8220;Germania&#8221;: &#8220;they have,&#8221; he says of the Germans, &#8220;but one kind of public 
show: in every gathering it is the same. Naked youths, who profess this sport, 
fling themselves in dance among swords and levelled lances.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-9">14-9</A><a name="Nanchor_14-9"></A> In certain forms of the dance there are figures in 
which the swords are brought together on the heads of performers, or a pretence 
is made to cut at heads and feet, or the swords are put in a ring round a 
person's neck. This strongly suggests that an execution, probably a sacrifice, 
lies at the bottom of the dances. In several cases, moreover, they are 
accompanied by sets of verses containing the incident of a quarrel and the 
violent death of one of the performers. The likeness to the central feature of 
the <A NAME="page_300"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 300</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_300"></A>St. George play&#65279;&#8212;the slaying&#65279;&#8212;will be noticed. In one of 
the dances, too, there is even a doctor who revives the victim.</P>
<P>In England the sword-dance is found chiefly in the north, but with it appear 
to be identical the morris-dances&#65279;&#8212;characterized by the wearing of jingling 
bells&#65279;&#8212;which are commoner in the southern counties. Blackened faces are common 
in both, and both have the same grotesque figures, a man and a woman, often 
called Tommy and Bessy in the sword-dance and &#8220;the fool&#8221; and Maid Marian in the 
morris. Moreover the morris-dancers in England sometimes use swords, and in one 
case the performers of an undoubted sword-dance were called &#8220;morrice&#8221; dancers in 
the eighteenth century. Bells too, so characteristic of the morris, are 
mentioned in some Continental accounts of the sword-dance.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_111">111</A><a name="FNanchor_111"></A></P>
<P>Intermediate between these dances and the fully developed St. George dramas 
are the plays performed on Plough Monday in Lincolnshire and the East Midlands. 
They all contain a good deal of dancing, a violent death and a revival, and 
grotesques found both in the dances and in the Christmas plays.</P>
<P>The sword-dance thus passes by a gradual transition, the dancing diminishing, 
the dramatic elements increasing, into the mummers&#146; plays of St. George. The 
central motive, death and revival, Mr. Chambers regards as a symbol of the 
resurrection of the year or the spirit of vegetation,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_112">112</A><a name="FNanchor_112"></A> like the Thuringian custom of executing a &#8220;wild man&#8221; 
covered with leaves, whom a doctor brings to life again by bleeding. This piece 
of ritual has apparently been attracted to Christmas from an early feast of 
spring, and Plough Monday, when the East Midland plays take place, is just such 
an early spring feast. Again, in some places the <A NAME="page_301"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 301</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_301"></A>St. George play is performed at Easter, a date alluded to 
in the title, &#8220;Pace-eggers&#146;&#8221; or &#8220;Pasque-eggers&#146;&#8221; play.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-13">14-13</A><a name="Nanchor_14-13"></A> </P>
<P>Two grotesque figures appear with varying degrees of clearness and with 
various names in the dances and in the plays&#65279;&#8212;the &#8220;fool&#8221; (Tommy) who wears the 
skin and tail of a fox or other animal, and a man dressed in woman's clothes 
(Bessy). In these we may recognize the skin-clad mummer and the man aping a 
woman whom we meet in the old Kalends denunciations. Sometimes the two are 
combined, while a hobby-horse also not unfrequently appears.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-14">14-14</A><a name="Nanchor_14-14"></A> </P>
<P>How exactly St. George came to be the central figure of the Christmas plays 
is uncertain; possibly they may be a development of a dance in which appeared 
the &#8220;Seven Champions,&#8221; the English national heroes&#65279;&#8212;of whom Richard Johnson 
wrote a history in 1596&#65279;&#8212;with St. George at their head. It is more probable, 
however, that the saint came in from the mediaeval pageants held on his day in 
many English towns.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-15">14-15</A><a name="Nanchor_14-15"></A> </P>
<P class=thoughtbreak>Can it be that the German St. Nicholas plays are more 
Christianized and sophisticated forms of folk-dramas like in origin to those we 
have been discussing? They certainly resemble the English plays in the manner in 
which one actor calls in another by name; while the grotesque figures introduced 
have some likeness to the &#8220;fool&#8221; of the morris.</P>
<P>Christmas mumming, it may be added, is found in eastern as well as western 
Europe. In Greece, where ecclesiastical condemnations of such things can be 
traced with remarkable clearness from early times to the twelfth century, it 
takes sundry forms. &#8220;At Pharsala,&#8221; writes Mr. J. C. Lawson, &#8220;there is a sort of 
play at the Epiphany, in which the mummers represent bride, bridegroom, and 
&#145;Arab&#146;; the Arab tries to carry off the bride, and the bridegroom defends 
her.... Formerly also at &#145;Kozane and in many other parts of Greece,&#146; according 
to a Greek writer in the early part of the nineteenth century, throughout the 
Twelve Days boys carrying bells used to go round the houses, singing songs and 
having &#145;one or more of their company dressed up with masks and bells and foxes&#146; 
brushes and other such things to give them a weird and monstrous look.&#146;&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-16">14-16</A><a name="Nanchor_14-16"></A> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_302"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 302</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_302"></A>In Russia, too, mummers used to go about at Christmastide, 
visiting houses, dancing, and performing all kinds of antics. &#8220;Prominent parts 
were always played by human representatives of a goat and a bear. Some of the 
party would be disguised as &#145;Lazaruses,&#146; that is, as blind beggars.&#8221; A certain 
number of the mummers were generally supposed to play the part of thieves 
anxious to break in.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-17">14-17</A><a name="Nanchor_14-17"></A> Readers of Tolstoy's &#8220;War and Peace&#8221; may remember a 
description of some such maskings in the year 1810.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN class=smcap>The Feast of Fools.</SPAN></H3>
<P>So far, in this Second Part, we have been considering customs practised 
chiefly in houses, streets, and fields. We must now turn to certain festivities 
following hard upon Christmas Day, which, though pagan in origin and sometimes 
even blasphemous, found their way in the Middle Ages within the walls of the 
church.</P>
<P>Shortly after Christmas a group of <I>tripudia</I> or revels was held by the 
various inferior clergy and ministrants of cathedrals and other churches. These 
festivals, of which the best known are the Feast of Fools and the Boy Bishop 
ceremonies, have been so fully described by other writers, and my space here is 
so limited, that I need but treat them in outline, and for detail refer the 
reader to such admirable accounts as are to be found in Chapters XIII., XIV., 
and XV. of Mr. Chamber's &#8220;The Mediaeval Stage.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-18">14-18</A><a name="Nanchor_14-18"></A> </P>
<P>Johannes Belethus, Rector of Theology at Paris towards the end of the twelfth 
century, speaks of four <I>tripudia</I> held after Christmas:&#65279;&#8212;those of the 
deacons on St. Stephen's Day, the priests on St. John's, the choir-boys on Holy 
Innocents&#146;, and the subdeacons on the Circumcision, the Epiphany, or the Octave 
of the Epiphany. The feast of subdeacons, says Belethus, &#8220;we call that of 
fools.&#8221; It is this feast which, though not apparently the earliest in origin of 
the four, was the most riotous and disorderly, and shows most clearly its pagan 
character. Belethus&#146; mention of it is the first clear notice, though disorderly 
revels of the same kind seem to have existed at Constantinople as early as the 
ninth century. At first confined to the subdeacons, the Feast of Fools became in 
its later developments a festival not only of that order but of the <A NAME="page_303"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 303</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_303"></A>inferior clergy in general, of the vicars choral, the 
chaplains, and the choir-clerks, as distinguished from the canons. For this 
rabble of poor and low-class clergy it was no doubt a welcome relaxation, and 
one can hardly wonder that they let themselves go in burlesquing the sacred but 
often wearisome rites at which it was their business to be present through many 
long hours, or that they delighted to usurp for once in a way the functions 
ordinarily performed by their superiors. The putting down of the mighty from 
their seat and the exalting of them of low degree was the keynote of the 
festival. While &#8220;Deposuit potentes de sede: et exaltavit humiles&#8221; was being sung 
at the &#8220;Magnificat,&#8221; it would appear that the precentor's <I>baculus</I> or 
staff was handed over to the clerk who was to be &#8220;lord of the feast&#8221; for the 
year, and throughout the services of the day the inferior clergy predominated, 
under the leadership of this chosen &#8220;lord.&#8221; He was usually given some title of 
ecclesiastical dignity, &#8220;bishop,&#8221; &#8220;prelate,&#8221; &#8220;archbishop,&#8221; &#8220;cardinal,&#8221; or even 
&#8220;pope,&#8221; was vested in full pontificals, and in some cases sat on the real 
bishop's throne, gave benedictions, and issued indulgences.</P>
<P>These lower clergy, it must be remembered, belonged to the peasant or small 
<I>bourgeois</I> class and were probably for the most part but ill-educated. 
They were likely to bring with them into the Church the superstitions floating 
about among the people, and the Feast of Fools may be regarded as a recoil of 
paganism upon Christianity in its very sanctuary. &#8220;An ebullition of the natural 
lout beneath the cassock&#8221; it has been called by Mr. Chambers, and many of its 
usages may be explained by the reaction of coarse natures freed for once from 
restraint. It brought to light, however, not merely personal vulgarity, but a 
whole range of traditional customs, derived probably from a fusion of the Roman 
feast of the Kalends of January with Teutonic or Celtic heathen festivities.</P>
<P>A general account of its usages is given in a letter addressed in 1445 by the 
Paris Faculty of Theology to the bishops and chapters of France:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&#8220;Priests and clerks may be seen wearing masks and monstrous visages at the 
  hours of office. They dance in the choir dressed as <A NAME="page_304"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 304</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_304"></A>women, panders or minstrels. They sing wanton songs. They 
  eat black puddings at the horn of the altar while the celebrant is saying 
  Mass. They play at dice there. They cense with stinking smoke from the soles 
  of old shoes. They run and leap through the church, without a blush at their 
  own shame. Finally they drive about the town and its theatres in shabby traps 
  and carts, and rouse the laughter of their fellows and the bystanders in 
  infamous performances, with indecent gesture and verses scurrilous and 
  unchaste.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-19">14-19</A><a name="Nanchor_14-19"></A> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The letter also speaks of &#8220;bishops&#8221; or &#8220;archbishops&#8221; of Fools, who wore 
mitres and held pastoral staffs. We here see clearly, besides mere irreverence, 
an outcrop of pagan practices. Topsy-turvydom, the temporary exaltation of 
inferiors, was itself a characteristic of the Kalends celebrations, and a still 
more remarkable feature of them was, as we have seen, the wearing of beast-masks 
and the dressing up of men in women's clothes. And what is the &#8220;bishop&#8221; or 
&#8220;archbishop&#8221; but a parallel to, and, we may well believe, an example of, the 
mock king whom Dr. Frazer has traced in so many a folk-festival, and who is 
found at the <I>Saturnalia</I>?</P>
<P>One more feature of the Feast of Fools must be considered, the Ass who gave 
to it the not uncommon title of <I>asinaria festa</I>. At Bourges, Sens, and 
Beauvais, a curious half-comic hymn was sung in church, the so-called &#8220;Prose of 
the Ass.&#8221; It begins as follows:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i15>&#8220;Orientis partibus</SPAN><BR><SPAN  class=i2>Adventavit Asinus,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>Pulcher et

rechignez,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>Vous aurez du foin assez</SPAN><BR><SPAN  class=i2>Et de l'avoine a plantez.&#8221;</SPAN><BR></DIV></DIV>
<P>And after eight verses in praise of the beast, with some mention of his 
connection with Bethlehem and the Wise Men, it closes thus:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i15>&#8220;Amen dicas, Asine,</SPAN><BR><SPAN  class=i2>Iam satur de gramine,<A NAME="page_305"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 305</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_305"></A></SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>Amen, Amen,

<P>An ass, it would seem, was actually brought into church, at Beauvais at all 
events, during the singing of this song on the feast of the Circumcision. On 
January&nbsp;14 an extraordinary ceremony took place there. A girl with a child 
in her arms rode upon an ass into St. Stephen's church, to represent the Flight 
into Egypt. The Introit, &#8220;Kyrie,&#8221; &#8220;Gloria,&#8221; and &#8220;Credo&#8221; at Mass ended in a bray, 
and at the close of the service the priest instead of saying &#8220;Ite, missa est,&#8221; 
had to bray three times, and the people to respond in like manner. Mr. 
Chambers's theory is that the ass was a descendant of the <I>cervulus</I> or 
hobby-buck who figures so largely in ecclesiastical condemnations of Kalends 
customs.</P>
<P>The country <I>par excellence</I> of the Feast of the Fools was France. It 
can also be traced in Germany and Bohemia, while in England too there are 
notices of it, though far fewer than in France. Its abuses were the subject of 
frequent denunciations by Church reformers from the twelfth to the fifteenth 
century. The feast was prohibited at various times, and notably by the Council 
of Basle in 1435, but it was too popular to be quickly suppressed, and it took a 
century and a half to die out after this condemnation by a general council of 
the Church. In one cathedral, Amiens, it even lingered until 1721.</P>
<P>When in the fifteenth century and later the Feast of Fools was expelled from 
the churches of France, associations of laymen sprang up to carry on its 
traditions outside. It was indeed a form of entertainment which the townsfolk as 
well as the lower clergy thoroughly appreciated, and they were by no means 
willing to let it die. A <I>Prince des Sots</I> took the place of the &#8220;bishop,&#8221; 
and was chosen by <I>soci&eacute;t&eacute;s joyeuses</I> organized by the youth of the cities 
for New Year merrymaking. Gradually their activities grew, and their 
celebrations came to take place at other festive times beside the Christmas 
season. The <I>sots</I> had a distinctive dress, its <A NAME="page_306"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 306</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_306"></A>most characteristic feature being a hood with asses&#146; ears, 
probably a relic of the primitive days when the heads of sacrificed animals were 
worn by festal worshippers.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-21">14-21</A><a name="Nanchor_14-21"></A> </P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN class=smcap>The Boy Bishop.</SPAN></H3>
<P>Of older standing than the Feast of Fools were the Christmas revels of the 
deacons, the priests, and the choir-boys. They can be traced back to the early 
tenth century, and may have originated at the great song-school of St. Gall near 
Constance. The most important of the three feasts was that of the boys on Holy 
Innocents&#146; Day, a theoretically appropriate date. Corresponding to the &#8220;lord&#8221; of 
the Feast of Fools was the famous &#8220;Boy Bishop,&#8221; a choir-boy chosen by the lads 
themselves, who was vested in cope and mitre, held a pastoral staff, and gave 
the benediction. Other boys too usurped the dignities of their elders, and were 
attired as dean, archdeacons, and canons. Offices for the festival, in which the 
Boy Bishop figures largely, are to be found in English, French, and German 
service-books, the best known in this country being those in the Sarum 
Processional and Breviary. In England these ceremonies were far more popular and 
lasting than the Feast of Fools, and, unlike it, they were recognized and 
approved by authority, probably because boys were more amenable to discipline 
than men, and objectionable features could be pruned away with comparative ease. 
The festivities must have formed a delightful break in the year of the mediaeval 
schoolboy, for whom holidays, as distinguished from holy-days for church-going, 
scarcely existed. The feast, as we shall see, was by no means confined within 
the church walls; there was plenty of merrymaking and money-making outside.</P>
<P>Minute details have been preserved of the Boy Bishop customs at St. Paul's 
Cathedral in the thirteenth century. It had apparently been usual for the 
&#8220;bishop&#8221; to make the cathedral dignitaries act as taper- and incense-bearers, 
thus reversing matters so that the great performed the functions of the lowly. 
In 1263 this was forbidden, and only clerks of lower rank might be chosen for 
these offices. But the &#8220;bishop&#8221; had the right to demand <A NAME="page_307"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 307</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_307"></A>after Compline on the Eve of the Innocents a supper for 
himself and his train from the Dean or one of his canons. The number of his 
following must, however, be limited; if he went to the Dean's he might take with 
him a train of fifteen: two chaplains, two taper-bearers, five clerks, two 
vergers, and four residentiary canons; if to a lesser dignitary his attendants 
were to be fewer.</P>
<P>On Innocents&#146; Day he was given a dinner, after which came a cavalcade through 
the city, that the &#8220;bishop&#8221; might bless the people. He had also to preach a 
sermon&#65279;&#8212;no doubt written for him.</P>
<P>Examples of such discourses are still extant,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-22">14-22</A><a name="Nanchor_14-22"></A> and are not without quaint touches. For instance the 
bidding prayer before one of them alludes to &#8220;the ryghte reverende fader and 
worshypfull lorde my broder Bysshopp of London, your dyoceasan,&#8221; and &#8220;my 
worshypfull broder [the] Deane of this cathedrall chirche,&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-23">14-23</A><a name="Nanchor_14-23"></A> while in another the preacher remarks, speaking of 
the choristers and children of the song-school, &#8220;Yt is not so long sens I was 
one of them myself.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-24">14-24</A><a name="Nanchor_14-24"></A> </P>
<P>In some places it appears, though this is by no means certain, that the boy 
actually sang Mass. The &#8220;bishop's&#8221; office was a very desirable one not merely 
because of the feasting, but because he had usually the right to levy 
contributions on the faithful, and the amounts collected were often very large. 
At York, for instance, in 1396 the &#8220;bishop&#8221; pocketed about &pound;77, all expenses 
paid.</P>
<P>The general parallelism of the Boy Bishop customs and the Feast of Fools is 
obvious, and no doubt they had much the same folk-origin. One point, already 
mentioned, should specially be noticed: the election of the Boy Bishop generally 
took place on December&nbsp;5, the Eve of St. Nicholas, patron of children; he 
was often called &#8220;Nicholas bishop&#8221;; and sometimes, as at Eton and Mayence, he 
exercised episcopal functions at divine service on the eve and the feast itself. 
It is possible, as Mr. Chambers suggests, that St. Nicholas's Day was an older 
date for the boys&#146; festival than Holy Innocents&#146;, and that from the connection 
with St. Nicholas, the bishop saint <I>par excellence</I> (he was said to have 
been consecrated by divine command when still a mere layman), sprang <A NAME="page_308"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 308</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_308"></A>the custom of giving the title &#8220;bishop&#8221; to the &#8220;lord&#8221; first 
of the boys&#146; feast and later of the Feast of Fools.</P>
<P>In the late Middle Ages the Boy Bishop was found not merely in cathedral, 
monastic, and collegiate churches but in many parish churches throughout England 
and Scotland. Various inventories of the vestments and ornaments provided for 
him still exist. With the beginnings of the Reformation came his suppression: a 
proclamation of Henry VIII., dated July&nbsp;22, 1541, commands &#8220;that from 
henceforth all suche superstitions be loste and clyerlye extinguisshed 
throughowte all this his realmes and dominions, forasmoche as the same doo 
resemble rather the unlawfull superstition of gentilitie [paganism], than the 
pure and sincere religion of Christe.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-25">14-25</A><a name="Nanchor_14-25"></A> In Mary's reign the Boy Bishop reappeared, along 
with other &#8220;Popish&#8221; usages, but after Elizabeth's accession he naturally fell 
into oblivion. A few traces of him lingered in the seventeenth century. &#8220;The 
Schoole-boies in the west,&#8221; says Aubrey, &#8220;still religiously observe St. Nicholas 
day (Decemb. 6th), he was the Patron of the Schoole-boies. At Curry-Yeovill in 
Somersetshire, where there is a Howschole (or schole) in the Church, they have 
annually at that time a Barrell of good Ale brought into the church; and that 
night they have the priviledge to breake open their Masters Cellar-dore.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-26">14-26</A><a name="Nanchor_14-26"></A> </P>
<P>In France he seems to have gradually vanished, as, after the Reformation, the 
Catholic Church grew more and more &#8220;respectable,&#8221; but traces of him are to be 
found in the eighteenth century at Lyons and Rheims; and at Sens, even in the 
nineteenth, the choir-boys used to play at being bishops on Innocents&#146; Day and 
call their &#8220;archbishop&#8221; <I>&acirc;ne</I>&#65279;&#8212;a memory this of the old <I>asinaria 
festa</I>.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-27">14-27</A><a name="Nanchor_14-27"></A> In Denmark a vague trace of him was retained in the 
nineteenth century in a children's game. A boy was dressed up in a white shirt, 
and seated on a chair, and the children sang a verse beginning, &#8220;Here we 
consecrate a Yule-bishop,&#8221; and offered him nuts and apples.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-28">14-28</A><a name="Nanchor_14-28"></A> </P>
