<div class="footnote">

<span id="Footnote_2"></span> [2](crt04.htm#FNanchor_2.md) “Christianity,”
as here used, will stand for the system of orthodoxy which had been
fixed in its main outlines when the festival of Christmas took its rise.
The relation of the orthodox creed to historical fact need not concern
us here, nor need we for the purposes of this study attempt to
distinguish between the Christianity of Jesus and ecclesiastical
accretions around his teaching.

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<span id="Footnote_3"></span> [3](crt04.htm#FNanchor_3.md) Whether the
Nativity had previously been celebrated at Rome on January 6 is a matter
of controversy; the affirmative view was maintained by Usener in his
monograph on Christmas,﻿ [1-6](crt22.htm#Note_1-6.md)<span
id="Nanchor_1-6"></span> the negative by Monsignor
Duchesne.﻿ [1-7](crt22.htm#Note_1-7.md)<span id="Nanchor_1-7"></span> A
very minute, cautious, and balanced study of both arguments is to be
found in Professor Kirsopp Lake's article on Christmas in Hastings's
“Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics,”﻿ [1-8](crt22.htm#Note_1-8.md)<span
id="Nanchor_1-8"></span> and a short article was contributed by the same
writer to *The Guardian*, December 29, 1911. Professor Lake, on the
whole, inclines to Usener's view. The early history of the festival is
also treated by Father Cyril Martindale in “The Catholic Encyclopædia”
(article “Christmas”).

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<span id="Footnote_4"></span> [4](crt04.htm#FNanchor_4.md) Usener says 354,
Duchesne 336.

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<span id="Footnote_5"></span> [5](crt04.htm#FNanchor_5.md) The eastern
father, Epiphanius (fourth century), gives a strange account of a
heathen, or perhaps in reality a Gnostic, rite held at Alexandria on the
night of January 5-6. In the temple of Kore﻿—the Maiden﻿—he tells us,
worshippers spent the night in singing and flute-playing, and at
cock-crow brought up from a subterranean sanctuary a wooden image seated
naked on a litter. It had the sign of the cross upon it in gold in five
places﻿—the forehead, the hands, and the knees. This image was carried
seven times round the central hall of the temple with flute-playing,
drumming, and hymns, and then taken back to the underground chamber. In
explanation of these strange actions it was said: “To-day, at this hour,
hath Kore (the Maiden) borne the Æon.”﻿ [1-15](crt22.htm#Note_1-15.md)<span
id="Nanchor_1-15"></span> Can there be a connection between this
festival and the Eleusinian mysteries? In the latter there was a
nocturnal celebration with many lights burning, and the cry went forth,
“Holy Brimo (the Maiden) hath borne a sacred child,
Brimos.”﻿ [1-16](crt22.htm#Note_1-16.md)<span id="Nanchor_1-16"></span> The
details given by Miss Harrison in her “Prolegomena” of the worship of
the child Dionysus﻿ [1-17](crt22.htm#Note_1-17.md)<span
id="Nanchor_1-17"></span> are of extraordinary interest, and a minute
comparison of this cult with that of the Christ Child might lead to
remarkable results.

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<span id="Footnote_6"></span> [6](crt04.htm#FNanchor_6.md) Mithraism
resembled Christianity in its monotheistic tendencies, its sacraments,
its comparatively high morality, its doctrine of an Intercessor and
Redeemer, and its vivid belief in a future life and judgment to come.
Moreover Sunday was its holy-day dedicated to the Sun.

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<span id="Footnote_7"></span> [7](crt04.htm#FNanchor_7.md) This is the
explanation adopted by most scholars (cf. Chambers, “M. S.,” i., 241-2).
Duchesne suggests as an explanation of the choice of December 25 the
fact that a tradition fixed the Passion of Christ on March 25. The same
date, he thinks, would have been assigned to His Conception in order to
make the years of His life complete, and the Birth would come naturally
nine months after the Conception. He, however, “would not venture to
say, in regard to the 25th of December, that the coincidence of the *Sol
novus* exercised no direct or indirect influence on the ecclesiastical
decision arrived at in regard to the
matter.”﻿ [1-25](crt22.htm#Note_1-25.md)<span id="Nanchor_1-25"></span>
Professor Lake also, in his article in Hastings's “Encyclopædia,” seeks
to account for the selection of December 25 without any deliberate
competition with the *Natalis Invicti*. He points out that the Birth of
Christ was fixed at the vernal equinox by certain early chronologists,
on the strength of an elaborate and fantastic calculation based on
Scriptural data, and connecting the Incarnation with the Creation, and
that when the Incarnation came to be viewed as beginning at the
Conception instead of the Birth, the latter would naturally be placed
nine months later.

of Dr. Yrjö Hirn's “The Sacred Shrine” (London, 1912). Dr. Hirn finds a
solitary anticipation of the Franciscan treatment of the Nativity in the
Christmas hymns of the fourth-century eastern poet, Ephraem Syrus.

Jacopone. Many of the poems in Tresatti's edition, from which the

and shy round the little baby Prince of the Elect who lies naked among
the prickly hay.... The Divine Verb, which is highest knowledge, this

crying and kicking as if He were not at all a divine man.”

<span id="Footnote_20"></span> [20](crt05.htm#FNanchor_20.md) “When Jesus
Christ was born, then was it cold; in a little crib He was laid. There
stood an ass and an ox which breathed over the Holy Child quite openly.
He who has a pure heart need have no care.”

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<span id="Footnote_21"></span> [21](crt05.htm#FNanchor_21.md) “Dearest
mother, take care of the Child; it is freezing hard, wrap Him up
quickly. And you, old father, tuck the little one up, or the cold and
the wind will give Him no rest. Now we must take our leave, O divine
Child, remember us, pardon our sins. We are heartily glad that Thou art
come; no one else could have helped us.”

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<span id="Footnote_22"></span> [22](crt05.htm#FNanchor_22.md) “The Child is
laid in the crib, so hearty and so rare! My little Hans would be nothing
by His side, were he finer than he is. Coal-black as cherries are His
eyes, the rest of Him is white as chalk. His pretty hands are right
tender and delicate, I touched Him carefully. Then He gave me a smile
and a deep sigh too. If you were mine, thought I, you'd grow a merry
boy. At home in the kitchen I'd comfortably house you; out here in the
stable the cold wind comes in at every corner.”

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<span id="Footnote_23"></span> [23](crt05.htm#FNanchor_23.md) Richard
Rolle, poet, mystic, and wandering preacher, in many ways reminds us of
Jacopone da Todi. Though he has left no Christmas verses, some lovely
words of his show how deeply he felt the wonder and pathos of Bethlehem:
“Jhesu es thy name. A! A! that wondryrfull name! A! that delittabyll
name! This es the name that es above all names.... I yede \[went\]
abowte be Covaytyse of riches and I fand noghte Jhesu. I satt in
companyes of Worldly myrthe and I fand noghte Jhesu.... Therefore I
turnede by anothire waye, and I rane a-bowte be Poverte, and I fande
Jhesu pure borne in the worlde, laid in a crybe and lappid in
clathis.”﻿ [2-28](crt22.htm#Note_2-28.md)<span id="Nanchor_2-28"></span>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<span id="Footnote_24"></span> [24](crt06.htm#FNanchor_24.md) “When
midnight sounded I leapt from my bed to the floor, and I saw a beautiful
angel who sang a thousand times sweeter than a nightingale. The
watch-dogs of the neighbourhood all came up. Never had they seen such a
sight, and they suddenly began to bark. The shepherds under the straw
were sleeping like logs: when they heard the sound of the barking they
thought it was the wolves. They were reasonable folk; they came without
waiting to be asked. They found in a little stable the Light, even the
Truth.”

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<span id="Footnote_25"></span> [25](crt06.htm#FNanchor_25.md) “Within a
poor manger and covered with hay lies Jesus of Nazareth. In the hay lies
stretched the Eternal Son of God; to deliver from hell man whom He had
created, and to kill sin, our Jesus of Nazareth is content with the hay.
He rests between two animals who warm Him from the cold, He who remedies
our ills with His great power; His kingdom and seigniory are the world
and the calm heaven, and now He sleeps in the hay. He counts it good to
bear the cold and fare thus, having no robe to protect or cover Him, and
to give us life He suffered cold in the hay, our Jesus of Nazareth.”

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<span id="Footnote_26"></span> [26](crt06.htm#FNanchor_26.md) “In a porch,
full of cobwebs, between the mule and the ox, the Saviour of souls is
born.... In the porch at Bethlehem are star, sun, and moon: the Virgin
and St. Joseph and the Child who lies in the cradle. In Bethlehem they
touch fire, from the porch the flame issues; it is a star of heaven
which has fallen into the straw. I am a poor gipsy who come hither from
Egypt, and bring to God's Child a cock. I am a poor Galician who come
from Galicia, and bring to God's Child linen for a shift. To the
new-born Child all bring a gift; I am little and have nothing; I bring
him my heart.”

mention of a season corresponding to Advent is at the Council of Tours,
about 567, when a fast for monks in December is vaguely indicated. At
the Council of Mâcon (581) it is enjoined that from Martinmas the
second, fourth, and sixth days of the week should be fasting days; and
at the close of the sixth century Rome, under Gregory the Great, adopted
the rule of the four Sundays in Advent. In the next century it became
prevalent in the West. In the Greek Church, forty days of fasting are
observed before Christmas; this custom appears to have been established
in the thirteenth century. In the Roman Church the practice as to
fasting varies: in the British Isles Wednesday and Friday are observed,
but in some countries no distinction is made between Advent and ordinary
weeks of the year.﻿ [4-2](crt22.htm#Note_4-2.md)<span

<span id="Footnote_80"></span> [80](crt09.htm#FNanchor_80.md) Though the ox

<span id="Footnote_82"></span> [82](crt10.htm#FNanchor_82.md) Among the
Scandinavians, who were late in their conversion, a pre-Christian Yule
feast seems to have been held in the ninth century, but it appears to
have taken place not in December but about the middle of January, and to
have been transferred to December 25 by the Christian king Hakon the
Good of Norway (940-63).﻿ [7-28](crt22.htm#Note_7-28.md)<span

<span id="Footnote_83"></span> [83](crt10.htm#FNanchor_83.md) It is only
right to mention here Professor G. Bilfinger's monograph “Das
germanische Julfest” (Stuttgart, 1901), where it is maintained that the
only festivals from which the Christmas customs of the Teutonic peoples
have sprung are the January Kalends of the Roman Empire and the
Christian feast of the Nativity. Bilfinger holds that there is no
evidence either of a November beginning-of-winter festival or of an
ancient Teutonic midwinter feast. Bilfinger's is the most systematic of
existing treatises on Christmas origins, but the considerations brought
forward in Tille's “Yule and Christmas” in favour of the November
festival are not lightly to be set aside, and while recognizing that its
celebration must be regarded rather as a probable hypothesis than an
established fact, I shall here follow in general the suggestions of
Tille and try to show the contributions of this northern New Year feast
to Christmas customs.

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<span id="Footnote_84"></span> [84](crt10.htm#FNanchor_84.md) Accounts of
such maskings are to be found in innumerable books of travel. In
*Folk-Lore*, June 30, 1911, Professor Edward Westermarck gives a
particularly full and interesting description of Moroccan customs of
this sort. He describes at length various masquerades in the skins and
heads of beasts, accompanied often by the dressing-up of men as women
and by gross obscenities.

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<span id="Footnote_85"></span> [85](crt10.htm#FNanchor_85.md) Another
suggested explanation connects the change of clothes with rites of
initiation at the passage from boyhood to manhood. “Manhood, among
primitive peoples, seems to be envisaged as ceasing to be a woman....
Man is born of woman, reared of woman. When he passes to manhood, he
ceases to be a woman-thing, and begins to exercise functions other and
alien. That moment is one naturally of extreme peril; he at once
emphasizes it and disguises it. He wears woman's clothes.” From
initiation rites, according to this theory, the custom spread to other
occasions when it was desirable to “change the luck.”

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<span id="Footnote_86"></span> [86](crt11.htm#FNanchor_86.md) According to
Sir John Rhys, in the Isle of Man *Hollantide* (November 1, Old Style,
therefore November 12) is still to-day the beginning of a new year. But
the ordinary calendar is gaining ground, and some of the associations of
the old New Year's Day are being transferred to January 1, the Roman
date. “In Wales this must have been decidedly helped by the influence of
Roman rule and Roman ideas; but even there the adjuncts of the Winter
Calends have never been wholly transferred to the Calends of
January.”﻿ [8-4](crt22.htm#Note_8-4.md)<span id="Nanchor_8-4"></span>

<span id="Footnote_87"></span> [87](crt11.htm#FNanchor_87.md) In Burne and

<div class="footnote">

<span id="Footnote_89"></span> [89](crt11.htm#FNanchor_89.md) The
prominence of “Eves” in festival customs is a point specially to be
noticed; it is often to them rather than to the actual feast days that
old practices cling. This is perhaps connected with the ancient Celtic
and Teutonic habit of reckoning by nights instead of days﻿—a trace of
this is left in our word “fortnight”﻿—but it must be remembered that the
Church encouraged the same tendency by her solemn services on the Eves
of festivals, and that the Jewish Sabbath begins on Friday evening.

varies, but is usually Thirteenth. Sometimes then the Twelve Days are

<span id="Footnote_99"></span> [99](crt14.htm#FNanchor_99.md) It is to be

and a fire of oak burned night and day in his honour. The neighbours of

they too kept up a perpetual oak-fire in his honour, and in time of
drought they used to pour beer on the flames, praying to Perkunas to
send showers.﻿ [11-10](crt22.htm#Note_11-10.md)<span

thought to open at midnight, and drop off about an hour afterwards. A
piece of thorn gathered at this hour brings luck, if kept for the rest
of the year.” As recently as 1908 about forty people went to see the
thorn blossom at this time (see E. M. Leather, “The Folk-Lore of

following quotation from an ancient account book is tersely suggestive
of the English Christmas:﻿—

                                      s.  d.
       “Item payd to the preacher     vi  ii
        Item payd to the minstrell   xii   o
        Item payd to the coke         xv   o”

<span id="Footnote_110"></span> [110](crt16.htm#FNanchor_110.md) In County
Louth, Ireland, boys used to carry about a thorn-bush decked with
streamers of coloured paper and with a wren tied to one of the
branches.﻿ [13-47](crt22.htm#Note_13-47.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-47"></span>

<span id="Footnote_111"></span> [111](crt17.htm#FNanchor_111.md) Dancing
is, as everyone knows, a common and indeed a central feature of
primitive festivals; and such dancing is wont to take a dramatic form,
to be mimetic, whether re-enacting some past event or *pre*-doing
something with magical intent to produce
it.﻿ [14-10](crt22.htm#Note_14-10.md)<span id="Nanchor_14-10"></span> The
Greek tragedy itself probably sprang from a primitive dance of a
dramatic and magical character, centred in a death and
re-birth.﻿ [14-11](crt22.htm#Note_14-11.md)<span id="Nanchor_14-11"></span>

<div class="footnote">

<span id="Footnote_112"></span> [112](crt17.htm#FNanchor_112.md) In
Thessaly and Macedonia at Carnival time folk-plays of a somewhat similar
character are performed, including a quarrel, a death, and a miraculous
restoration to life﻿—evidently originating in magical ritual intended to
promote the fertility of vegetation.﻿ [14-12](crt22.htm#Note_14-12.md)<span
id="Nanchor_14-12"></span> Parallels can be found in the Carnival
customs of other countries.

<span id="Footnote_113"></span> [113](crt19.htm#FNanchor_113.md) A
remarkably clear instance of the transference of customs from Hollantide
Eve (Hallowe'en) to the modern New Year is given by Sir John Rhys.
Certain methods of prognostication described by him are practised by
some people in the Isle of Man on the one day and by some on the other,
and the Roman date is gaining ground.﻿ [16-1](crt22.htm#Note_16-1.md)<span

<span id="Footnote_116"></span> [116](crt20.htm#FNanchor_116.md) It is
probable that some customs practised at the Epiphany belong in reality
to Christmas Day, Old Style.

<span id="Footnote_117"></span> [117](crt20.htm#FNanchor_117.md) *Pasqua*
is there used for great festivals in general, not only for Easter.

<span id="Footnote_118"></span> [118](crt20.htm#FNanchor_118.md) The custom
of “burning the bush,” still surviving here and there in Herefordshire,
shows a certain resemblance to this. The “bush,” a globe made of
hawthorn, hangs throughout the year in the farmhouse kitchen, with the
mistletoe. Early on New Year's Day it “is carried to the earliest sown
wheat field, where a large fire is lighted, of straw and bushes, in
which it is burnt. While it is burning, a new one is made; in making it,
the ends of the branches are scorched in the fire.” Burning straw is
carried over twelve ridges of the field, and then follow cider-drinking
and cheering. (See Leather, “Folk-Lore of Herefordshire,” 91 f.)
