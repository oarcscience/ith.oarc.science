### <span class="smcap">St. Clement's Day.</span>

The next folk-feast after Martinmas is St. Clement's Day, November 23,
once reckoned the first day of winter in
England.﻿ [9-1](crt22.htm#Note_9-1)<span id="Nanchor_9-1"></span> It
marks apparently one of the stages in the progress of the winter feast
towards its present solstitial date. In England some interesting popular
customs existed on this day. In Staffordshire children used to go round
to the village houses begging for gifts, with rhymes resembling in many
ways the “souling” verses I have already quoted. Here is one of the
Staffordshire “clemencing” songs:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Clemany! Clemany! Clemany mine!</span>  
<span class="i2">A good red apple and a pint of wine,</span>  
<span class="i2">Some of your mutton and some of your veal,</span>  
<span class="i2">If it is good, pray give me a deal;</span>  
<span class="i2">If it is not, pray give me some salt.</span>  
<span class="i2">Butler, butler, fill your bowl;</span>  
<span class="i2">If thou fill'st it of the best,</span>  
<span class="i2">The Lord'll send your soul to rest;</span>  
<span class="i2">If thou fill'st it of the small,</span>  
<span class="i2">Down goes butler, bowl and all.<span id="page_212">p.
212</span> <span id="Page_212"></span></span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Pray, good mistress, send to me</span>  
<span class="i2">One for Peter, one for Paul,</span>  
<span class="i2">One for Him who made us all;</span>  
<span class="i2">Apple, pear, plum, or cherry,</span>  
<span class="i2">Any good thing to make us merry;</span>  
<span class="i2">A bouncing buck and a velvet chair,</span>  
<span class="i2">Clement comes but once a year;</span>  
<span class="i2">Off with the pot and on with the pan,</span>  
<span class="i2">A good red apple and I'll be
gone.”﻿ [9-2](crt22.htm#Note_9-2)<span id="Nanchor_9-2"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

In Worcestershire on St. Clement's Day the boys chanted similar rhymes,
and at the close of their collection they would roast the apples
received and throw them into ale or
cider.﻿ [9-3](crt22.htm#Note_9-3)<span id="Nanchor_9-3"></span> In the
north of England men used to go about begging drink, and at Ripon
Minster the choristers went round the church offering everyone a rosy
apple with a sprig of box on it.﻿ [9-4](crt22.htm#Note_9-4)<span
id="Nanchor_9-4"></span> The Cambridge bakers held their annual supper
on this day,﻿ [9-5](crt22.htm#Note_9-5)<span id="Nanchor_9-5"></span> at
Tenby the fishermen were given a supper,﻿ [9-6](crt22.htm#Note_9-6)<span
id="Nanchor_9-6"></span> while the blacksmiths’ apprentices at Woolwich
had a remarkable ceremony, akin perhaps to the Boy Bishop customs. One
of their number was chosen to play the part of “Old Clem,” was attired
in a great coat, and wore a mask, a long white beard, and an oakum wig.
Seated in a large wooden chair, and surrounded by attendants bearing
banners, torches, and weapons, he was borne about the town on the
shoulders of six men, visiting numerous public-houses and the
blacksmiths and officers of the dockyard. Before him he had a wooden
anvil, and in his hands a pair of tongs and a wooden hammer, the
insignia of the blacksmith's trade.﻿ [9-7](crt22.htm#Note_9-7)<span
id="Nanchor_9-7"></span>

### <span class="smcap">St. Catherine's Day.</span>

November 25 is St. Catherine's Day, and at Woolwich Arsenal a similar
ceremony was then performed: a man was dressed in female attire, with a
large wheel by his side to represent the saint, and was taken round the
town﻿ [9-8](crt22.htm#Note_9-8)<span id="Nanchor_9-8"></span> in a
wooden chair. At Chatham there was a torchlight procession on St.
Catherine's Day, and a woman in white muslin with a gilt crown was
carried about in a chair. She was said to represent not the saint, but
Queen Catherine.﻿ [9-9](crt22.htm#Note_9-9)<span
id="Nanchor_9-9"></span>

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span> <span id="Page_213"></span>St.
Catherine's Day was formerly a festival for the lacemakers of
Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, and Bedfordshire. She was the
patroness of spinsters in the literal as well as the modern sense of the
word, and at Peterborough the workhouse girls used to go in procession
round the city on her day, dressed in white with coloured ribbons; the
tallest was chosen as Queen and bore a crown and sceptre. As they went
to beg money of the chief inhabitants they sang a quaint ballad which
begins thus:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Here comes Queen Catherine, as fine as any
queen,</span>  
<span class="i2">With a coach and six horses a-coming to be
seen,</span>  
<span class="i4">And a-spinning we will go, will go, will go,</span>  
<span class="i4">And a-spinning we will
go.”﻿ [9-10](crt22.htm#Note_9-10)<span id="Nanchor_9-10"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

We may perhaps see in this Saint or Queen Catherine a female counterpart
of the Boy Bishop, who began his career on St. Nicholas's Day.
Catherine, it must be remembered, is the patron saint of girls as
Nicholas is of boys. In Belgium her day is still a festival for the
“young person” both in schools and in
families.﻿ [9-11](crt22.htm#Note_9-11)<span id="Nanchor_9-11"></span>
Even in modern Paris the dressmaker-girls celebrate it, and in a very
charming way, too.

“At midday the girls of every workroom present little mob-caps trimmed
with yellow ribbons to those of their number who are over twenty-five
and still unmarried. Then they themselves put on becoming little caps
with yellow flowers and yellow ribbons and a sprig of orange blossom on
them, and out they go arm-in-arm to parade the streets and collect a
tribute of flowers from every man they meet.... Instead of working all
the afternoon, the midinettes entertain all their friends (no men
admitted, though, for it is the day of St. Catherine) to concerts and
even to dramatic performances in the workrooms, where the work-tables
are turned into stages, and the employers provide
supper.”﻿ [9-12](crt22.htm#Note_9-12)<span id="Nanchor_9-12"></span>

### <span class="smcap">St. Andrew's Day.</span>

The last day of November is the feast of St. Andrew. Of English customs
on this day the most interesting perhaps are those connected with the
“Tander” or “Tandrew” merrymakings <span id="page_214">p.
214</span> <span id="Page_214"></span>of the Northamptonshire
lacemakers. A day of general licence used to end in masquerading. Women
went about in male attire and men and boys in female
dress.﻿ [9-13](crt22.htm#Note_9-13)<span id="Nanchor_9-13"></span> In
Kent and Sussex squirrel-hunting was practised on this
day﻿ [9-14](crt22.htm#Note_9-14)<span id="Nanchor_9-14"></span> ﻿—a
survival apparently of some old sacrificial custom comparable with the
hunting of the wren at Christmas (see  [XII](crt16.htm#Chapter_XII)).

In Germany St. Andrew's Eve is a great occasion for prognostications of
the future. Indeed, like Hallowe'en in Great Britain, *Andreasabend* in
Germany seems to have preserved the customs of augury connected with the
old November New Year festival.﻿ [9-15](crt22.htm#Note_9-15)<span
id="Nanchor_9-15"></span> To a large extent the practices are performed
by girls anxious to know what sort of husband they will get. Many and
various are the methods.

Sometimes it suffices to repeat some such rhyme as the following before
going to sleep, and the future husband will appear in a dream:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“St. Andrew's Eve is to-day,</span>  
<span class="i2">Sleep all people,</span>  
<span class="i2">Sleep all children of men,</span>  
<span class="i2">Who are between heaven and earth,</span>  
<span class="i2">Except this only man,</span>  
<span class="i2">Who may be mine in
marriage.”﻿ [9-16](crt22.htm#Note_9-16)<span id="Nanchor_9-16"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

Again, at nightfall let a girl shut herself up naked in her bedroom,
take two beakers, and into one pour clear water, into the other wine.
These let her place on the table, which is to be covered with white, and
let the following words be said:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“My dear St. Andrew!</span>  
<span class="i2">Let now appear before me</span>  
<span class="i2">My heart's most dearly beloved.</span>  
<span class="i2">If he shall be rich,</span>  
<span class="i2">He will pour a cup of wine;</span>  
<span class="i2">If he is to be poor,</span>  
<span class="i2">Let him pour a cup of water.”</span>  

</div>

</div>

This done, the form of the future husband will enter and drink <span
id="page_215">p. 215</span> <span id="Page_215"></span>of one of the
cups. If he is poor, he will take the water; if rich, the
wine.﻿ [9-17](crt22.htm#Note_9-17)<span id="Nanchor_9-17"></span>

One of the most common practices is to pour molten lead or tin through a
key into cold water, and to discover the calling of the future husband
by the form it takes, which will represent the tools of his trade. The
white of an egg is sometimes used for the same
purpose.﻿ [9-18](crt22.htm#Note_9-18)<span id="Nanchor_9-18"></span>
Another very widespread custom is to put nutshells to float on water
with little candles burning in them. There are twice as many shells as
there are girls present; each girl has her shell, and to the others the
names of possible suitors are given. The man and the girl whose shells
come together will marry one another. Sometimes the same method is
practised with little cups of silver
foil.﻿ [9-19](crt22.htm#Note_9-19)<span id="Nanchor_9-19"></span>

On the border of Saxony and Bohemia, a maiden who wishes to know the
bodily build of her future husband goes in the darkness to a stack of
wood and draws out a piece. If the wood is smooth and straight the man
will be slim and well built; if it is crooked, or knotted, he will be
ill-developed or even a hunchback.﻿ [9-20](crt22.htm#Note_9-20)<span
id="Nanchor_9-20"></span>

These are but a few of the many ways in which girls seek to peer into
the future and learn something about the most important event in their
lives. Far less numerous, but not altogether absent on this night, are
other kinds of prognostication. A person, for instance, who wishes to
know whether he will die in the coming year, must on St. Andrew's Eve
before going to bed make on the table a little pointed heap of flour. If
by the morning it has fallen asunder, the maker will
die.﻿ [9-21](crt22.htm#Note_9-21)<span id="Nanchor_9-21"></span>

The association of St. Andrew's Eve with the foreseeing of the future is
not confined to the German race; it is found also on Slavonic and
Roumanian ground. In Croatia he who fasts then will behold his future
wife in a dream,﻿ [9-22](crt22.htm#Note_9-22)<span
id="Nanchor_9-22"></span> and among the Roumanians mothers anxious about
their children's luck break small sprays from fruit-trees, bind them
together in bunches, one for each child, and put them in a glass of
water. The branch of the lucky one will
blossom.﻿ [9-23](crt22.htm#Note_9-23)<span id="Nanchor_9-23"></span>

In Roumania St. Andrew's Eve is a creepy time, for on it vampires are
supposed to rise from their graves, and with coffins <span
id="page_216">p. 216</span> <span id="Page_216"></span>on their heads
walk about the houses in which they once lived. Before nightfall every
woman takes some garlic and anoints with it the door locks and window
casements; this will keep away the vampires. At the cross-roads there is
a great fight of these loathsome beings until the first cock crows; and
not only the dead take part in this, but also some living men who are
vampires from their birth. Sometimes it is only the souls of these
living vampires that join in the fight; the soul comes out through the
mouth in the form of a bluish flame, takes the shape of an animal, and
runs to the crossway. If the body meanwhile is moved from its place the
person dies, for the soul cannot find its way
back.﻿ [9-24](crt22.htm#Note_9-24)<span id="Nanchor_9-24"></span>

St. Andrew's Day is sometimes the last, sometimes the first important
festival of the western Church's year. It is regarded in parts of
Germany as the beginning of winter, as witness the saying:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Sünten-Dres-Misse,</span>  
<span class="i2">es de Winter
gewisse.”﻿ [93](crt24.htm#Footnote_93)<span
id="FNanchor_93"></span>﻿ [9-25](crt22.htm#Note_9-25)<span
id="Nanchor_9-25"></span> </span>  

</div>

</div>

The nights are now almost at their longest, and as November passes away,
giving place to the last month of the year, Christmas is felt to be near
at hand.

In northern Bohemia it is customary for peasant girls to keep for
themselves all the yarn they spin on St. Andrew's Eve, and the
*Hausfrau* gives them also some flax and a little money. With this they
buy coffee and other refreshments for the lads who come to visit the
parlours where in the long winter evenings the women sit spinning. These
evenings, when many gather together in a brightly lighted room and sing
songs and tell stories while they spin, are cheerful enough, and spice
is added by the visits of the village lads, who in some places come to
see the girls home.﻿ [9-26](crt22.htm#Note_9-26)<span
id="Nanchor_9-26"></span>

### <span class="smcap">The Klöpfelnächte.</span>

On the Thursday nights in Advent it is customary in southern Germany for
children or grown-up people to go from house <span id="page_217">p.
217</span> <span id="Page_217"></span>to house, singing hymns and
knocking on the doors with rods or little hammers, or throwing peas,
lentils, and the like against the windows. Hence these evenings have
gained the name of *Klöpfel* or *Knöpflinsnächte* (Knocking
Nights).﻿ [9-27](crt22.htm#Note_9-27)<span id="Nanchor_9-27"></span> The
practice is described by Naogeorgus in the sixteenth century:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Three weekes before the day whereon was borne the
Lord of Grace,</span>  
<span class="i2">And on the Thursdaye Boyes and Girles do runne in every
place,</span>  
<span class="i2">And bounce and beate at every doore, with blowes and
lustie snaps,</span>  
<span class="i2">And crie, the Advent of the Lorde not borne as yet
perhaps.</span>  
<span class="i2">And wishing to the neighbours all, that in the houses
dwell,</span>  
<span class="i2">A happie yeare, and every thing to spring and prosper
well:</span>  
<span class="i2">Here have they peares, and plumbs, and pence, ech man
gives willinglee,</span>  
<span class="i2">For these three nightes are alwayes thought,
unfortunate to bee;</span>  
<span class="i2">Wherein they are afrayde of sprites and cankred
witches’ spight,</span>  
<span class="i2">And dreadfull devils blacke and grim, that then have
chiefest might.”﻿ [9-28](crt22.htm#Note_9-28)<span
id="Nanchor_9-28"></span> </span>  

</div>

</div>

With it may be compared the Macedonian custom for village boys to go in
parties at nightfall on Christmas Eve, knocking at the cottage doors
with sticks, shouting *Kolianda! Kolianda!* and receiving
presents,﻿ [9-29](crt22.htm#Note_9-29)<span id="Nanchor_9-29"></span>
and also one in vogue in Holland between Christmas and the Epiphany.
There “the children go out in couples, each boy carrying an earthenware
pot, over which a bladder is stretched, with a piece of stick tied in
the middle. When this stick is twirled about, a not very melodious
grumbling sound proceeds from the contrivance, which is known by the
name of ‘Rommelpot.’ By going about in this manner the children are able
to collect some few pence.”﻿ [9-30](crt22.htm#Note_9-30)<span
id="Nanchor_9-30"></span>

Can such practices have originated in attempts to drive out evil spirits
from the houses by noise? Similar methods are used for that purpose by
various European and other peoples.﻿ [9-31](crt22.htm#Note_9-31)<span
id="Nanchor_9-31"></span> Anyhow something mysterious hangs about the
*Klöpfelnächte*. They are occasions for girls to learn about their
future husbands, and upon them in Swabia goes about Pelzmärte, whom we
already know.﻿ [9-32](crt22.htm#Note_9-32)<span
id="Nanchor_9-32"></span>

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span> <span id="Page_218"></span>In Tyrol
curious mummeries are then performed. At Pillersee in the Lower Innthal
two youths combine to form a mimic ass, upon which a third rides, and
they are followed by a motley train. The ass falls sick and has to be
cured by a “vet,” and all kinds of satirical jokes are made about things
that have happened in the parish during the year. Elsewhere two men
dress up in straw as husband and wife, and go out with a masked company.
The pair wrangle with one another and carry on a play of wits with the
peasants whose house they are visiting. Sometimes the satire is so
cutting that permanent enmities ensue, and for this reason the practice
is gradually being dropped.﻿ [9-33](crt22.htm#Note_9-33)<span
id="Nanchor_9-33"></span>

### <span class="smcap">St. Nicholas's Day.</span>

On December 6 we reach the most distinctive children's festival of the
whole year, St. Nicholas's Day. In England it has gone out of mind, and
in the flat north of Germany Protestantism has largely rooted it out, as
savouring too much of saint-worship, and transferred its festivities to
the more Evangelical season of
Christmas.﻿ [9-34](crt22.htm#Note_9-34)<span id="Nanchor_9-34"></span>
In western and southern Germany, however, and in Austria, Switzerland,
and the Low Countries, it is still a day of joy for children, though in
some regions even there its radiance tends to pale before the greater
glory of the Christmas-tree.

It is not easy either to get at the historic facts about St. Nicholas,
the fourth-century bishop of Myra in Asia Minor, or to ascertain why he
became the patron saint of boys. The legends of his infant piety and his
later wondrous works for the benefit of young people may either have
given rise, or be themselves due to, his connection with
children.﻿ [9-35](crt22.htm#Note_9-35)<span id="Nanchor_9-35"></span> In
eastern Europe and southern Italy he is above all things the saint of
seafaring men, and among the Greeks his cult has perhaps replaced that
of Artemis as a sea divinity.﻿ [9-36](crt22.htm#Note_9-36)<span
id="Nanchor_9-36"></span> This aspect of him does not, however, appear
in the German festival customs with which we are here chiefly concerned.

It has already been hinted that in some respects St. Nicholas is a
duplicate of St. Martin. His feast, indeed, is probably a later
beginning-of-winter festival, dating from the period when <span
id="page_219">p. 219</span> <span id="Page_219"></span>improved methods
of agriculture and other causes made early December, rather than
mid-November, the time for the great annual slaughter and its attendant
rejoicings. Like St. Martin he brings sweet things for the good children
and rods for the bad.

St. Nicholas's Eve is a time of festive stir in Holland and Belgium; the
shops are full of pleasant little gifts: many-shaped biscuits, gilt
gingerbreads, sometimes representing the saint, sugar images, toys, and
other trifles. In many places, when evening comes on, people dress up as
St. Nicholas, with mitre and pastoral staff, enquire about the behaviour
of the children, and if it has been good pronounce a benediction and
promise them a reward next morning. Before they go to bed the children
put out their shoes, with hay, straw, or a carrot in them for the
saint's white horse or ass. When they wake in the morning, if they have
been “good” the fodder is gone and sweet things or toys are in its
place; if they have misbehaved themselves the provender is untouched and
no gift but a rod is there.﻿ [9-37](crt22.htm#Note_9-37)<span
id="Nanchor_9-37"></span>

In various parts of Germany, Switzerland, and Austria St. Nicholas is
mimed by a man dressed up as a bishop.﻿ [9-38](crt22.htm#Note_9-38)<span
id="Nanchor_9-38"></span> In Tyrol children pray to the saint on his Eve
and leave out hay for his white horse and a glass of *schnaps* for his
servant. And he comes in all the splendour of a church-image, a reverend
grey-haired figure with flowing beard, gold-broidered cope, glittering
mitre, and pastoral staff. Children who know their catechism are
rewarded with sweet things out of the basket carried by his servant;
those who cannot answer are reproved, and St. Nicholas points to a
terrible form that stands behind him with a rod﻿—the hideous Klaubauf, a
shaggy monster with horns, black face, fiery eyes, long red tongue, and
chains that clank as he moves.﻿ [9-39](crt22.htm#Note_9-39)<span
id="Nanchor_9-39"></span>

In Lower Austria the saint is followed by a similar figure called
Krampus or Grampus;﻿ [9-40](crt22.htm#Note_9-40)<span
id="Nanchor_9-40"></span> in Styria this horrible attendant is named
Bartel;﻿ [9-41](crt22.htm#Note_9-41)<span id="Nanchor_9-41"></span> all
are no doubt related to such monsters as the *Klapperbock* (see
 [VII](crt11.htm#Chapter_VII)). Their heathen origin is evident though
it is difficult to trace their exact pedigree. Sometimes St. Nicholas
himself appears in a non-churchly form like Pelzmärte, with a
bell,﻿ [9-42](crt22.htm#Note_9-42)<span id="Nanchor_9-42"></span> or
with a sack of ashes which gains him the name of
Aschenklas.﻿ [9-43](crt22.htm#Note_9-43)<span id="Nanchor_9-43"></span>

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span> <span id="Page_220"></span>Not only by
hideous figures is St. Nicholas attended. Sometimes, as at Warnsdorf
near Rumburg, there come with him the forms of Christ Himself, St.
Peter, an angel, and the famous Knecht Ruprecht, whom we shall meet
again on Christmas Eve. They are represented by children, and a little
drama is performed, one personage coming in after the other and calling
for the next in the manner of the English mummers’ play. St. Nicholas,
St. Peter, and Ruprecht accuse the children of all kinds of naughtiness,
the “Heiliger Christ” intercedes and at last throws nuts down and
receives money from the parents.﻿ [9-44](crt22.htm#Note_9-44)<span
id="Nanchor_9-44"></span> In Tyrol there are St. Nicholas plays of a
more comic nature, performed publicly by large companies of players and
introducing a number of humorous characters and much rude popular
wit.﻿ [9-45](crt22.htm#Note_9-45)<span id="Nanchor_9-45"></span>

Sometimes a female bogey used to appear: Budelfrau in Lower Austria,
Berchtel in Swabia, Buzebergt in the neighbourhood of
Augsburg.﻿ [9-46](crt22.htm#Note_9-46)<span id="Nanchor_9-46"></span>
The last two are plainly variants of Berchte, who is specially connected
with the Epiphany. Berchtel used to punish the naughty children with a
rod, and reward the good with nuts and apples; Buzebergt wore black
rags, had her face blackened and her hair hanging unkempt, and carried a
pot of starch which she smeared upon people's
faces.﻿ [9-47](crt22.htm#Note_9-47)<span id="Nanchor_9-47"></span>

As Santa Klaus St. Nicholas is of course known to every English child,
but rather as a sort of incarnation of Christmas than as a saint with a
day of his own. Santa Klaus, probably, has come to us *viâ* the United
States, whither the Dutch took him, and where he has still immense
popularity.

In the Middle Ages in England as elsewhere the Eve of St. Nicholas was a
day of great excitement for boys. It was then that the small choristers
and servers in cathedral and other churches generally elected their “Boy
Bishop” or “Nicholas.”﻿ [9-48](crt22.htm#Note_9-48)<span
id="Nanchor_9-48"></span> He had in some places to officiate at First
Vespers and at the services on the festival itself. As a rule, however,
the feast of the Holy Innocents, December 28, was probably the most
important day in the Boy Bishop's career, and we may therefore postpone
our consideration of him. We will here only note his connection with the
festival of the patron saint of boys, a connection perhaps implying a
common origin for him and <span id="page_221">p. 221</span> <span
id="Page_221"></span>for the St. Nicholases who in bishops’ vestments
make their present-giving rounds.

The festival of St. Nicholas is naturally celebrated with most splendour
at the place where his body lies, the seaport of Bari in south-eastern
Italy. The holy bones are preserved in a sepulchre beneath a crypt of
rich Saracenic architecture, above which rises a magnificent church.
Legend relates that in the eleventh century they were stolen by certain
merchants of Bari from the saint's own cathedral at Myra in Asia Minor.
The tomb of St. Nicholas is a famous centre for pilgrimages, and on the
6th of December many thousands of the faithful, bearing staves bound
with olive and pine, visit it. An interesting ceremony on the festival
is the taking of the saint's image out to sea by the sailors of the
port. They return with it at nightfall, and a great procession escorts
it back to the cathedral with torches and fireworks and
chanting.﻿ [9-49](crt22.htm#Note_9-49)<span id="Nanchor_9-49"></span>
Here may be seen the other, the seafaring, aspect of St. Nicholas; by
this mariners’ cult we are taken far away from the present-giving saint
who delights the small children of the North.

### <span class="smcap">St. Lucia's Day.</span>

The only folk-festivals of note between St. Nicholas's Day and Christmas
are those of St. Lucia (December 13) and St. Thomas the Apostle
(December 21).

In Sweden St. Lucia's Day was formerly marked by some interesting
practices. It was, so to speak, the entrance to the Christmas festival,
and was called “little Yule.”﻿ [9-50](crt22.htm#Note_9-50)<span
id="Nanchor_9-50"></span> At the first cock-crow, between 1 and 4 a.m.,
the prettiest girl in the house used to go among the sleeping folk,
dressed in a white robe, a red sash, and a wire crown covered with
whortleberry-twigs and having nine lighted candles fastened in it. She
awakened the sleepers and regaled them with a sweet drink or with
coffee,﻿ [94](crt24.htm#Footnote_94)<span id="FNanchor_94"></span> sang
a special song, and was named “Lussi” or “Lussibruden” (Lucy bride).
When everyone was dressed, breakfast was taken, the room being lighted
by many candles. The domestic animals <span id="page_222">p.
222</span> <span id="Page_222"></span>were not forgotten on this day,
but were given special portions. A peculiar feature of the Swedish
custom is the presence of lights on Lussi's crown. Lights indeed are the
special mark of the festival; it was customary to shoot and fish on St.
Lucy's Day by torchlight, the parlours, as has been said, were
brilliantly illuminated in the early morning, in West Gothland Lussi
went round the village preceded by torchbearers, and in one parish she
was represented by a cow with a crown of lights on her head. In schools
the day was celebrated with
illuminations.﻿ [9-51](crt22.htm#Note_9-51)<span
id="Nanchor_9-51"></span>

What is the explanation of this feast of lights? There is nothing in the
legend of the saint to account for it; her name, however, at once
suggests *lux*﻿—light. It is possible, as Dr. Feilberg supposes, that
the name gave rise to the special use of lights among the Latin-learned
monks who brought Christianity to Sweden, and that the custom spread
from them to the common people. A peculiar fitness would be found in it
because St. Lucia's Day according to the Old Style was the shortest day
of the year, the turning-point of the sun's
light.﻿ [9-52](crt22.htm#Note_9-52)<span id="Nanchor_9-52"></span>

In Sicily also St. Lucia's festival is a feast of lights. After sunset
on the Eve a long procession of men, lads, and children, each
flourishing a thick bunch of long straws all afire, rushes wildly down
the streets of the mountain village of Montedoro, as if fleeing from
some danger, and shouting hoarsely. “The darkness of the night,” says an
eye-witness, “was lighted up by this savage procession of dancing,
flaming torches, whilst bonfires in all the side streets gave the
illusion that the whole village was burning.” At the end of the
procession came the image of Santa Lucia, holding a dish which contained
her eyes.﻿ [95](crt24.htm#Footnote_95)<span id="FNanchor_95"></span> In
the midst of the *piazza* a great mountain of straw had been prepared;
on this everyone threw his own burning torch, and the saint was placed
in a spot from which she could survey the vast
bonfire.﻿ [9-53](crt22.htm#Note_9-53)<span id="Nanchor_9-53"></span>

In central Europe we see St. Lucia in other aspects. In the Böhmerwald
she goes round the village in the form of a nanny-goat with horns, gives
fruit to the good children, and threatens to rip open the belly of the
naughty. Here she is evidently related <span id="page_223">p.
223</span> <span id="Page_223"></span>to the pagan monsters already
described. In Tyrol she plays a more graceful part: she brings presents
for girls, an office which St. Nicholas is there supposed to perform for
boys only.﻿ [9-55](crt22.htm#Note_9-55)<span id="Nanchor_9-55"></span>

In Lower Austria St. Lucia's Eve is a time when special danger from
witchcraft is feared and must be averted by prayer and incense. A
procession is made through each house to cense every room. On this
evening, too, girls are afraid to spin lest in the morning they should
find their distaffs twisted, the threads broken, and the yarn in
confusion. (We shall meet with like superstitions during the Twelve
Nights.) At midnight the girls practise a strange ceremony: they go to a
willow-bordered brook, cut the bark of a tree partly away, without
detaching it, make with a knife a cross on the inner side of the cut
bark, moisten it with water, and carefully close up the opening. On New
Year's Day the cutting is opened, and the future is augured from the
markings found. The lads, on the other hand, look out at midnight for a
mysterious light, the *Luzieschein*, the forms of which indicate coming
events.﻿ [9-56](crt22.htm#Note_9-56)<span id="Nanchor_9-56"></span>

In Denmark, too, St. Lucia's Eve is a time for seeing the future. Here
is a prayer of Danish maids: “Sweet St. Lucy let me know: whose cloth I
shall lay, whose bed I shall make, whose child I shall bear, whose
darling I shall be, whose arms I shall sleep
in.”﻿ [9-57](crt22.htm#Note_9-57)<span id="Nanchor_9-57"></span>

### <span class="smcap">St. Thomas's Day.</span>

Many and various are the customs and beliefs associated with the feast
of St. Thomas (December 21). In Denmark it was formerly a great
children's day, unique in the year, and rather resembling the mediaeval
Boy Bishop festival. It was the breaking-up day for schools; the
children used to bring their master an offering of candles and money,
and in return he gave them a feast. In some places it had an even more
delightful side: for this one day in the year the children were allowed
the mastery in the school. Testimonials to their scholarship and
industry were made out, and elaborate titles were added to their names,
as exalted sometimes as “Pope,” “Emperor,” or “Empress.” Poor children
used to go about showing these <span id="page_224">p. 224</span> <span
id="Page_224"></span>documents and collecting money. Games and larks of
all sorts went on in the schools without a word of reproof, and the
children were wont to burn their master's
rod.﻿ [9-58](crt22.htm#Note_9-58)<span id="Nanchor_9-58"></span>

In the neighbourhood of Antwerp children go early to school on St.
Thomas's Day, and lock the master out, until he promises to treat them
with ale or other drink. After this they buy a cock and hen, which are
allowed to escape and have to be caught by the boys or the girls
respectively. The girl who catches the hen is called “queen,” the boy
who gets the cock, “king.” Elsewhere in Belgium children lock out their
parents, and servants their masters, while schoolboys bind their teacher
to his chair and carry him over to the inn. There he has to buy back his
liberty by treating his scholars with punch and cakes. Instead of the
chase for the fowls, it was up to 1850 the custom in the Ardennes for
the teacher to give the children hens and let them chop the heads
off.﻿ [9-59](crt22.htm#Note_9-59)<span id="Nanchor_9-59"></span> Some
pagan sacrifice no doubt lies at the root of this barbarous practice,
which has many parallels in the folk-lore of western and southern
Europe.﻿ [9-60](crt22.htm#Note_9-60)<span id="Nanchor_9-60"></span>

As for schoolboys’ larks with their teachers, the custom of “barring out
the master” existed in England, and was practised before
Christmas﻿ [9-61](crt22.htm#Note_9-61)<span id="Nanchor_9-61"></span> as
well as at other times of the year, notably Shrove Tuesday. At Bromfield
in Cumberland on Shrove Tuesday there was a regular siege, the school
doors were strongly barricaded within, and the boy-defenders were armed
with pop-guns. If the master won, heavy tasks were imposed, but if, as
more often happened, he was defeated in his efforts to regain his
authority, he had to make terms with the boys as to the hours of work
and play.﻿ [9-62](crt22.htm#Note_9-62)<span id="Nanchor_9-62"></span>

St. Thomas's Eve is in certain regions one of the uncanniest nights in
the year. In some Bohemian villages the saint is believed to drive about
at midnight in a chariot of fire. In the churchyard there await him all
the dead men whose name is Thomas; they help him to alight and accompany
him to the churchyard cross, which glows red with supernatural radiance.
There St. Thomas kneels and prays, and then rises to bless his
namesakes. This done, he vanishes beneath the cross, and each Thomas
returns to his grave. The saint here seems to have taken over <span
id="page_225">p. 225</span> <span id="Page_225"></span>the character of
some pagan god, who, like the Teutonic Odin or Woden, ruled the souls of
the departed. In the houses the people listen with awe for the sound of
his chariot, and when it is heard make anxious prayer to him for
protection from all ill. Before retiring to rest the house-father goes
to the cowhouse with holy water and consecrated salt, asperges it from
without, and then entering, sprinkles every cow. Salt is also thrown on
the head of each animal with the words, “St. Thomas preserve thee from
all sickness.” In the Böhmerwald the cattle are fed on this night with
consecrated bayberries, bread, and salt, in order to avert
disease.﻿ [9-63](crt22.htm#Note_9-63)<span id="Nanchor_9-63"></span>

In Upper and Lower Austria St. Thomas's Eve is reckoned as one of the
so-called *Rauchnächte* (smoke-nights) when houses and farm-buildings
must be sanctified with incense and holy water, the other nights being
the Eves of Christmas, the New Year, and the
Epiphany.﻿ [9-64](crt22.htm#Note_9-64)<span id="Nanchor_9-64"></span>

In Germany St. Thomas's, like St. Andrew's Eve, is a time for
forecasting the future, and the methods already described are sometimes
employed by girls who wish to behold their future husbands. A widely
diffused custom is that of throwing shoes backwards over the shoulders.
If the points are found turned towards the door the thrower is destined
to leave the house during the year; if they are turned away from it
another year will be spent there. In Westphalia a belief prevails that
you must eat and drink heartily on this night in order to avert
scarcity.﻿ [9-65](crt22.htm#Note_9-65)<span id="Nanchor_9-65"></span>

In Lower Austria it is supposed that sluggards can cure themselves of
oversleeping by saying a special prayer before they go to bed on St.
Thomas's Eve, and in Westphalia in the mid-nineteenth century the same
association of the day with slumber was shown by the schoolchildren's
custom of calling the child who arrived last at school *Domesesel*
(Thomas ass). In Holland, again, the person who lies longest in bed on
St. Thomas's Day is greeted with shouts of “lazybones.” Probably the
fact that December 21 is the shortest day is enough to account for
this.﻿ [9-66](crt22.htm#Note_9-66)<span id="Nanchor_9-66"></span>

In England there was divination by means of “St. Thomas's onion.” Girls
used to peel an onion, wrap it in a handkerchief and put it under their
heads at night, with a prayer to the satin <span id="page_226">p.
226</span> <span id="Page_226"></span>to show them their true love in a
dream.﻿ [9-67](crt22.htm#Note_9-67)<span id="Nanchor_9-67"></span> The
most notable English custom on this day, however, was the peregrinations
of poor people begging for money or provisions for Christmas. Going
“a-gooding,” or “a-Thomassin’,” or “a-mumping,” this was called.
Sometimes in return for the charity bestowed a sprig of holly or
mistletoe was given.﻿ [9-68](crt22.htm#Note_9-68)<span
id="Nanchor_9-68"></span> Possibly the sprig was originally a sacrament
of the healthful spirit of growth: it may be compared with the olive- or
cornel-branches carried about on New Year's Eve by Macedonian
boys,﻿ [9-69](crt22.htm#Note_9-69)<span id="Nanchor_9-69"></span> and
also with the St. Martin's rod (see  [VII](crt11.htm#Chapter_VII)).

One more English custom on December 21 must be mentioned﻿—it points to a
sometime sacrifice﻿—the bull-baiting practised until 1821 at Wokingham
in Berkshire. Its abolition in 1822 caused great resentment among the
populace, although the flesh continued to be duly
distributed.﻿ [9-70](crt22.htm#Note_9-70)<span id="Nanchor_9-70"></span>

We are now four days from the feast of the Nativity, and many things
commonly regarded as distinctive of Christmas have already come under
notice. We have met, for instance, with several kinds of present-giving,
with auguries for the New Year, with processions of carol-singers and
well-wishers, with ceremonial feasting that anticipates the Christmas
eating and drinking, and with various figures, saintly or monstrous,
mimed or merely imagined, which we shall find reappearing at the
greatest of winter festivals. These things would seem to have been
attracted from earlier dates to the feast of the Nativity, and the
probability that Christmas has borrowed much from an old November
festival gradually shifted into December, is our justification for
having dwelt so long upon the feasts that precede the Twelve Days.
