THE ADORATION OF THE SHEPHERDS.

*By Fouquet.*

(Musée Condé, Chantilly.)

</div>

The Reformation marks a change in the character of Christmas poetry in
England and the larger part of Germany, and, instead of following its
development under Protestantism, it will be well to break off and turn
awhile to countries where Catholic tradition remained unbroken. We shall
come back later to Post-Reformation England and Protestant Germany.

In French﻿ [3-1](crt22.htm#Note_3-1.md)<span id="Nanchor_3-1"></span> there
is little or no Christmas poetry, religious in character, before the
fifteenth century; the earlier carols that have come down to us are
songs rather of feasting and worldly rejoicing than of sacred things.
The true *Noël* begins to appear in fifteenth-century manuscripts, but
it was not till the following century that it attained its fullest vogue
and was spread all over the country by the printing presses. Such
*Noëls* seem to have been written by clerks or recognized poets, either
for old airs or for specially composed music. “To a great extent,” says
Mr. Gregory Smith, “they anticipate the spirit which stimulated the
Reformers to turn the popular and often obscene songs into good and
godly ballads.”﻿ [3-2](crt22.htm#Note_3-2.md)<span id="Nanchor_3-2"></span>

Some of the early *Noëls* are not unlike the English carols of the
period, and are often half in Latin, half in French. Here are a few such
“macaronic” verses:﻿—

The sixteenth century is the most interesting *Noël* period; we find
then a conflict of tendencies, a conflict between Gallic realism and
broad humour and the love of refined language due to the study of the
ancient classics. There are many anonymous pieces of this time, but
three important *Noëlistes* stand out by name: Lucas le Moigne, Curé of
Saint Georges, Puy-la-Garde, near Poitiers; Jean Daniel, called “Maître
Mitou,” a priest-organist at Nantes; and Nicholas Denisot of Le Mans,
whose *Noëls* appeared posthumously under the pseudonym of “Comte
d'Alsinoys.”

Lucas le Moigne represents the *esprit gaulois*, the spirit that is
often called “Rabelaisian,” though it is only one side of the genius of
Rabelais. The good Curé was a contemporary of <span id="page_57">p.
57</span> <span id="Page_57"></span>the author of “Pantagruel.” His
“Chansons de Noëls nouvaulx” was published in 1520, and contains carols
in very varied styles, some naïve and pious, others hardly quotable at
the present day. One of his best-known pieces is a dialogue between the
Virgin and the singers of the carol: Mary is asked and answers questions
about the wondrous happenings of her life. Here are four verses about
the Nativity:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Or nous dites, Marie,</span>  
<span class="i2">Les neuf mois accomplis,</span>  
<span class="i2">Naquit le fruit de vie,</span>

<span class="i2">﻿—Oui, sans nulle peine</span>  
<span class="i2">Et sans oppression,</span>  
<span class="i2">Naquit de tout le monde</span>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

The influence of the “Pléiade,” with its care for form, its respect for
classical models, its enrichment of the French tongue with new Latin
words, is shown by Jean Daniel, who also owes something to the poets of
the late fifteenth century. Two stanzas may be quoted from him:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i3">“C'est ung très grant mystère</span>  
<span class="i4">Qu'ung roy de si hault pris</span>  
<span class="i4">Vient naistre en lieu austère,</span>  
<span class="i4">En si meschant pourpris:</span>  
<span class="i2">Le Roy de tous les bons espritz,</span>  
<span class="i4">C'est Jésus nostre frère,</span>  
<span class="i2">Le Roy de tous les bons espritz,</span>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">Notre Dieu, notre frère,</span>  
<span class="i2">Saluons le doulx Jésuchrist,</span>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">Qu'en sa haulte emperière</span>  
<span class="i4">Ayons lieu de party;</span>  
<span class="i2">Comme il nous a droict apparty,</span>  
<span class="i4">Jésus nostre bon frère,</span>  
<span class="i2">Comme il nous a droict apparty</span>  
<span class="i4">Au céleste convy.</span>  
<span class="i2">Saluons, etc.</span>  
<span class="i4">Amen. Noel.”﻿ [3-5](crt22.htm#Note_3-5.md)<span
id="Nanchor_3-5"></span> </span>  

</div>

</div>

As for Denisot, I may give two charming verses from one of his
pastorals:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Suz, Bergiez, en campaigne,</span>  
<span class="i2">Laissez là vos troppeaux,<span id="page_59">p.
59</span> <span id="Page_59"></span></span>  
<span class="i2">Avant qu'on s'accompaigne,</span>  
<span class="i2">Enflez vos chalumeaux.</span>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Enflez vos cornemuses,</span>  
<span class="i2">Dansez ensemblement,</span>  
<span class="i2">Et vos doucettes muses,</span>  
<span class="i2">Accollez doucement.”﻿ [3-6](crt22.htm#Note_3-6.md)<span
id="Nanchor_3-6"></span> </span>  

</div>

</div>

One result of the Italian influences which came over France in the
sixteenth century was a fondness for diminutives. Introduced into
carols, these have sometimes a very graceful effect:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Entre le boeuf & le bouvet,</span>  
<span class="i4">Noel nouvellet,</span>  
<span class="i2">Voulust Jésus nostre maistre,</span>  
<span class="i2">En un petit hostelet,</span>  
<span class="i4">Noel nouvellet,</span>  
<span class="i2">En ce pauvre monde naistre,</span>  
<span class="i4">O Noel nouvellet!</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Ne couche, ne bercelet,</span>  
<span class="i4">Noel nouvellet,</span>  
<span class="i2">Ne trouvèrent en cette estre,</span>  
<span class="i2">Fors ung petit drappelet,</span>  
<span class="i4">Noel nouvellet,</span>  
<span class="i2">Pour envelopper le maistre,</span>  
<span class="i4">O Noel nouvellet!”﻿ [3-7](crt22.htm#Note_3-7.md)<span
id="Nanchor_3-7"></span> </span>  

</div>

</div>

These diminutives are found again, though fewer, in a particularly
delightful carol:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i3">“Laissez paître vos bestes</span>  
<span class="i2">Pastoureaux, par monts et par vaux;</span>  
<span class="i3">Laissez paître vos bestes,</span>  
<span class="i3">Et allons chanter Nau.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">J'ai ouï chanter le rossignol,</span>  
<span class="i2">Qui chantoit un chant si nouveau,</span>  
<span class="i3">Si haut, si beau,</span>  
<span class="i3">Si résonneau,<span id="page_60">p. 60</span> <span
id="Page_60"></span></span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i3">Il m'y rompoit la tête,</span>  
<span class="i2">Tant il chantoit et flageoloit:</span>  
<span class="i3">Adonc pris ma houlette</span>  
<span class="i3">Pour aller voir Naulet.</span>  
<span class="i3">Laissez paître, etc.”﻿ [3-8](crt22.htm#Note_3-8.md)<span
id="Nanchor_3-8"></span> </span>  

</div>

</div>

The singer goes on to tell how he went with his fellow-shepherds and
shepherdesses to Bethlehem:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Nous dîmes tous une chanson</span>  
<span class="i2">Les autres en vinrent au son,</span>  
<span class="i4">Chacun prenant</span>

<span class="i3">Je prendrai Guillemette,</span>  
<span class="i2">Margot tu prendras gros Guillot;</span>  
<span class="i3">Qui prendra Péronelle?</span>  
<span class="i3">Ce sera Talebot.</span>  
<span class="i3">Laissez paître, etc.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Ne chantons plus, nous tardons trop,</span>  
<span class="i2">Pensons d'aller courir le trot.</span>  
<span class="i4">Viens-tu, Margot?﻿—</span>  
<span class="i4">J'attends Guillot.﻿—</span>  
<span class="i3">J'ai rompu ma courette,</span>

<span class="i3">Or, tiens cette aiguillette,</span>

<div class="stanza">

</div>

</div>

This is but one of a large class of French *Noëls* which make the
Nativity more real, more present, by representing the singer as one of a
company of worshippers going to adore the Child. Often these are
shepherds, but sometimes they are simply the inhabitants of a parish, a
town, a countryside, or a province, bearing presents of their own
produce to the little Jesus and His parents. Barrels of wine, fish,
fowls, sucking-pigs, pastry, milk, fruit, firewood, birds in a
cage﻿—such are their homely gifts. Often there is a strongly satiric
note: the peculiarities and weaknesses of individuals are hit off; the
reputation of a place is suggested, a village whose people are famous
for their stinginess offers cider that is half rain-water; elsewhere the
inhabitants are so given to law-suits that they can hardly find time to
go to Bethlehem.

Such *Noëls* with their vivid local colour, are valuable pictures of the
manners of their time. They are, unfortunately, too long for quotation
here, but any reader who cares to follow up the subject will find some
interesting specimens in a little collection of French carols that can
be bought for ten *centimes*.﻿ [3-9](crt22.htm#Note_3-9.md)<span
id="Nanchor_3-9"></span> They are of various dates; some probably were
written as late as the eighteenth century. In that century, and indeed
in the seventeenth, the best Christmas verses are those of a provincial
and rustic character, and especially those in *patois*; the more
cultivated poets, with their formal classicism, can ill enter into the
spirit of the festival. Of the learned writers the best is a woman,
Françoise Paschal, of Lyons (b. about 1610); in spite of her Latinity
she shows a real feeling for her subjects. Some of her *Noëls* are
dialogues between the sacred personages; one presents <span
id="page_62">p. 62</span> <span id="Page_62"></span>Joseph and Mary as
weary wayfarers seeking shelter at all the inns of Bethlehem and
everywhere refused by host or hostess:﻿—

The most remarkable of the *patois Noëlistes* of the seventeenth century
are the Provençal Saboly and the Burgundian La Monnoye, the one kindly
and tender, the other witty and sarcastic. Here is one of Saboly's
Provençal *Noëls*:﻿—

<div class="poem">

id="FNanchor_24"></span>﻿ [3-11](crt22.htm#Note_3-11.md)<span
id="Nanchor_3-11"></span> </span>  

</div>

</div>

As for La Monnoye, here is a translation of one of his satirical
verses:﻿—“When in the time of frost Jesus Christ came into the world the
ass and ox warmed Him with their breath in the stable. How many asses
and oxen I know in this kingdom of Gaul! How many asses and oxen I know
who would not have done as much!”﻿ [3-12](crt22.htm#Note_3-12.md)<span
id="Nanchor_3-12"></span>

Apart from the rustic *Noëls*, the eighteenth century produced little
French Christmas poetry of any charm. Some of the carols most sung in
French churches to-day belong, however, to this period, *e.g.*, the
“Venez, divin Messie” of the Abbé
Pellegrin.﻿ [3-13](crt22.htm#Note_3-13.md)<span id="Nanchor_3-13"></span>

One cannot leave the France of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
without some mention of its Latin hymnody. From a date near 1700,
apparently, comes the sweet and solemn “Adeste, fideles”; by its music
and its rhythm, perhaps, rather than by its actual words it has become
the best beloved of Christmas hymns. The present writer has heard it
sung with equal reverence and heartiness in English, German, French, and
Italian churches, and no other hymn seems so full of the spirit of
Christmas devotion﻿—wonder, <span id="page_64">p. 64</span> <span
id="Page_64"></span>awe, and tenderness, and the sense of reconciliation
between Heaven and earth. Composed probably in France, “Adeste, fideles”
came to be used in English as well as French Roman Catholic churches
during the eighteenth century. In 1797 it was sung at the chapel of the
Portuguese Embassy in London; hence no doubt its once common name of
“Portuguese hymn.” It was first used in an Anglican church in 1841, when
the Tractarian Oakley translated it for his congregation at Margaret
Street Chapel, London.

Another fine Latin hymn of the eighteenth-century French Church is
Charles Coffin's “Jam desinant
suspiria.”﻿ [3-14](crt22.htm#Note_3-14.md)<span id="Nanchor_3-14"></span>
It appeared in the Parisian Breviary in 1736, and is well known in
English as “God from on high hath heard.”

The Revolution and the decay of Catholicism in France seem to have
killed the production of popular carols. The later nineteenth century,
however, saw a revival of interest in the *Noël* as a literary form. In
1875 the bicentenary of Saboly's death was celebrated by a competition
for a *Noël* in the Provençal tongue, and something of the same kind has
been done in Brittany.﻿ [3-15](crt22.htm#Note_3-15.md)<span
id="Nanchor_3-15"></span> The *Noël* has attracted by its aesthetic
charm even poets who are anything but devout; Théophile Gautier, for
instance, wrote a graceful Christmas carol, “Le ciel est noir, la terre
est blanche.”

On a general view of the vernacular Christmas poetry of France it must
be admitted that the devotional note is not very strong; there is indeed
a formal reverence, a courtly homage, paid to the Infant Saviour, and
the miraculous in the Gospel story is taken for granted; but there is
little sense of awe and mystery. In harmony with the realistic instincts
of the nation, everything is dramatically, very humanly conceived; at
times, indeed, the personages of the Nativity scenes quite lose their
sacred character, and the treatment degenerates into grossness. At its
best, however, the French *Noël* has a gaiety and a grace, joined to a
genuine, if not very deep, piety, that are extremely charming. Reading
these rustic songs, we are carried in imagination to French
countrysides; we think of the long walk through the snow to the Midnight
Mass, the cheerful *réveillon* spread on the <span id="page_65">p.
65</span> <span id="Page_65"></span>return, the family gathered round
the hearth, feasting on wine and chestnuts and *boudins*, and singing in
traditional strains the joys of *Noël*.

Across the Pyrenees, in Spain, the late sixteenth and early seventeenth
centuries saw a great output of Christmas verse. Among the chief writers
were Juan López de Ubeda, Francisco de Ocaña, and José de
Valdivielso.﻿ [3-16](crt22.htm#Note_3-16.md)<span id="Nanchor_3-16"></span>
Their *villancicos* remind one of the paintings of Murillo; they have
the same facility, the same tender and graceful sentiment, without much
depth. They lack the homely flavour, the quaintness that make the French
and German folk-carols so delightful; they have not the rustic tang, and
yet they charm by their simplicity and sweetness.

In nearly every western language one finds traditional Christmas carols.
Europe is everywhere alive with them; they spring up like wild flowers.
Some interesting Italian specimens are given by Signor de Gubernatis in

In Wales, in the early nineteenth century, carol-singing was more
popular, perhaps, than in England; the carols were sung to the harp, in
church at the *Plygain* or early morning service on Christmas Day, in
the homes of the people, and at the doors of the houses by
visitors.﻿ [3-24](crt22.htm#Note_3-24.md)<span id="Nanchor_3-24"></span> In
Ireland, too, the custom of carol-singing then
prevailed.﻿ [3-25](crt22.htm#Note_3-25.md)<span id="Nanchor_3-25"></span>
Dr. Douglas Hyde, in his “Religious Songs of Connacht,” gives and
translates an interesting Christmas hymn in Irish, from which two verses
may be quoted. They set forth the great paradox of the Incarnation:﻿—

Even in dour Scotland, with its hatred of religious festivals, some kind

SINGING “VOM HIMMEL HOCH” FROM A CHURCH TOWER AT CHRISTMAS.

*By Ludwig Richter.*

Before I close this study with a survey of Christmas poetry in England
after the Reformation, it may be interesting to follow the developments
in Protestant Germany. The Reformation gave a great impetus to German
religious song, and we owe to it some of the finest of Christmas hymns.
It is no doubt largely due to Luther, that passionate lover of music and
folk-poetry, that hymns have practically become the liturgy of German
Protestantism; yet he did but give typical expression to the natural
instincts of his countrymen for song. Luther, though a rebel, was no
Puritan; we can hardly call him an iconoclast; he had a conservative
mind, which only gradually became loosened from its old attachments. His
was an essentially artistic nature: “I would fain,” he said, “see all
arts, especially music, in the service of Him who has given and created
them,” and in the matter of hymnody he continued, in many respects, the
mediaeval German tradition. Homely, kindly, a lover of children, he had
a deep feeling for the festival of Christmas; and not only did he
translate into German “A solis ortus cardine” and “Veni, redemptor <span
id="page_71">p. 71</span> <span id="Page_71"></span>gentium,” but he
wrote for his little son Hans one of the most delightful and touching of
all Christmas hymns﻿—“Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her.”

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span> <span id="Page_72"></span>“Vom Himmel
hoch” has qualities of simplicity, directness, and warm human feeling
which link it to the less ornate forms of carol literature. Its first
verse is adapted from a secular song; its melody may, perhaps, have been
composed by Luther himself. There is another Christmas hymn of Luther's,
too﻿—“Vom Himmel kam der Engel Schar”﻿—written for use when “Vom Himmel
hoch” was thought too long, and he also composed additional verses for
the mediaeval “Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ.”

The first stanza alone is mediaeval, the remaining six of the hymn are
Luther's.

The Christmas hymns of Paul Gerhardt, the seventeenth-century Berlin
pastor, stand next to Luther's. They are more subjective, more finished,
less direct and forcible. Lacking the finest qualities of poetry, they
are nevertheless impressive by their dignity and heartiness. Made for
music, the words alone hardly convey the full power of these hymns. They
should be heard sung to the old chorales, massive, yet sweet, by the
lusty voices of a German congregation. To English people they are
probably best known through the verses introduced into the “Christmas
Oratorio,” where the old airs are given new beauty by Bach's marvellous
harmonies. The tone of devotion, one feels, in Gerhardt and Bach is the
same, immeasurably greater as is the genius of the composer; in both
there is a profound joy in the Redemption begun by the Nativity, a
robust faith joined to a deep sense of the mystery of suffering, and a
keen sympathy with childhood, a tender fondness for the Infant King.

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span> <span id="Page_74"></span>The finest
perhaps of Gerhardt's hymns is the Advent “Wie soll ich dich empfangen?”
(“How shall I fitly meet Thee?”), which comes early in the “Christmas
Oratorio.” More closely connected with the Nativity, however, are the
*Weihnachtslieder*, “Wir singen dir, Emanuel,” “O Jesu Christ, dein
Kripplein ist,” “Fröhlich soll mein Herze springen,” “Ich steh an deiner
Krippen hier,” and others. I give a few verses from the third:﻿—

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span> <span id="Page_75"></span>One more
German Christmas hymn must be mentioned, Gerhard Tersteegen's “Jauchzet,
ihr Himmel, frohlocket, ihr englischen Chöre.” Tersteegen represents one
phase of the mystical and emotional reaction against the religious
formalism and indifference of the eighteenth century. In the Lutheran
Church the Pietists, though they never seceded, somewhat resembled the
English Methodists; the Moravians formed a separate community, while
from the “Reformed” or Calvinistic Church certain circles of
spiritually-minded people, who drew inspiration from the mediaeval
mystics and later writers like Böhme and Madame Guyon, gathered into
more or less independent groups for religious intercourse. Of these last
Tersteegen is a representative singer. Here are three verses from his
best known Christmas hymn:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Jauchzet, ihr Himmel, frohlocket, ihr englischen
Chöre,</span>

<span class="i5">Gott will so freundlich und nah</span>  
<span class="i5">Zu den Verlornen sich kehren.<span id="page_76">p.

</div>

<div class="stanza">

The note of personal religion, as distinguished from theological
doctrine, is stronger in German Christmas poetry than in that of any
other nation﻿—the birth of Christ in the individual soul, not merely the
redemption of man in general, is a central idea.

We come back at last to England. The great carol period is, as has
already been said, the fifteenth, and the first half of the sixteenth,
century; after the Reformation the English domestic Christmas largely
loses its religious colouring, and the best carols of the late sixteenth
and early seventeenth centuries are songs of <span id="page_77">p.
77</span> <span id="Page_77"></span>feasting and pagan ceremonies rather
than of the Holy Child and His Mother. There is no lack of fine
Christmas verse in the Elizabethan and early Stuart periods, but for the
most part it belongs to the oratory and the chamber rather than the
hall. The Nativity has become a subject for private contemplation, for
individual devotion, instead of, as in the later Middle Ages, a matter
for common jubilation, a wonder-story that really happened, in which,
all alike and all together, the serious and the frivolous could rejoice,
something that, with all its marvel, could be taken as a matter of
course, like the return of the seasons or the rising of the sun on the
just and on the unjust.

English Christmas poetry after the mid-sixteenth century is, then,
individual rather than communal in its spirit; it is also a thing less
of the people, more of the refined and cultivated few. The Puritanism
which so deeply affected English religion was abstract rather than
dramatic in its conception of Christianity, it was concerned less with
the events of the Saviour's life than with Redemption as a transaction
between God and man; St. Paul and the Old Testament rather than the
gospels were its inspiration. Moreover, the material was viewed not as
penetrated by and revealing the spiritual, but as sheer impediment
blocking out the vision of spiritual things. Hence the extremer Puritans
were completely out of touch with the sensuous poetry of Christmas, a
festival which, as we shall see, they actually suppressed when they came
into power.

The singing of sacred carols by country people continued, indeed, but
the creative artistic impulse was lost. True carols after the
Reformation tend to be doggerel, and no doubt many of the traditional
pieces printed in such collections as Bramley and
Stainer's﻿ [33](crt24.htm#Footnote_33.md)<span
id="FNanchor_33"></span>﻿ [3-37](crt22.htm#Note_3-37.md)<span
id="Nanchor_3-37"></span> are debased survivals from the Middle Ages, or
perhaps new words written for old tunes. Such carols as “God rest you
merry, gentlemen,” have unspeakably delightful airs, and the words charm
us moderns by their quaintness and rusticity, but they are far from the
exquisite loveliness of the mediaeval <span id="page_78">p.
78</span> <span id="Page_78"></span>things. Gleams of great beauty are,
however, sometimes found amid matter that in the process of transmission
has almost ceased to be poetry. Here, for instance, are five stanzas
from the traditional “Cherry-tree Carol”:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“As Joseph was a-walking,</span>  
<span class="i3">He heard an angel sing:</span>  
<span class="i2">‘This night shall be born</span>  
<span class="i3">Our heavenly King.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">‘He neither shall be born</span>  
<span class="i3">In housen nor in hall,</span>  
<span class="i2">Nor in the place of Paradise,</span>  
<span class="i3">But in an ox's stall.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">‘He neither shall be clothed</span>  
<span class="i3">In purple nor in pall,</span>  
<span class="i2">But all in fair linen</span>  
<span class="i3">As wear babies all.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">‘He neither shall be rocked</span>  
<span class="i3">In silver nor in gold,</span>  
<span class="i2">But in a wooden cradle</span>  
<span class="i3">That rocks on the mould.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">‘He neither shall be christened</span>  
<span class="i3">In white wine nor red,</span>  
<span class="i2">But with fair spring water</span>  
<span class="i3">With which we were christened.’”</span>  

</div>

</div>

The old carols sung by country folk have often not much to do with the
Nativity; they are sometimes rhymed lives of Christ or legends of the
Holy Childhood. Of the latter class the strangest is “The Bitter Withy,”
discovered in Herefordshire by Mr. Frank Sidgwick. It tells how the
little Jesus asked three lads to play with Him at ball. But they
refused:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“’O we are lords’ and ladies’ sons,</span>  
<span class="i3">Born in bower or in hall;</span>  
<span class="i2">And you are but a poor maid's child,</span>  
<span class="i3">Born in an oxen's stall.’<span id="page_79">p.
79</span> <span id="Page_79"></span></span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">‘If I am but a poor maid's child,</span>  
<span class="i3">Born in an oxen's stall,</span>  
<span class="i2">I will let you know at the very latter end</span>  
<span class="i3">That I am above you all.’</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">So he built him a bridge with the beams of the
sun,</span>  
<span class="i3">And over the sea went he,</span>  
<span class="i2">And after followed the three jolly jerdins,</span>  
<span class="i3">And drowned they were all three.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Then Mary mild called home her child,</span>  
<span class="i3">And laid him across her knee,</span>  
<span class="i2">And with a handful of green withy twigs</span>  
<span class="i3">She gave him slashes three.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">‘O the withy, O the withy, O bitter withy</span>  
<span class="i3">That causes me to smart!</span>  
<span class="i2">O the withy shall be the very first tree</span>  
<span class="i3">That perishes at the heart.’”</span>  

</div>

</div>

From these popular ballads, mediaeval memories in the rustic mind, we
must return to the devotional verse of the late sixteenth and early
seventeenth centuries. Two of the greatest poets of the Nativity, the
Roman priests Southwell and Crashaw, are deeply affected by the wave of
mysticism which passed over Europe in their time. Familiar as is
Southwell's “The Burning Babe,” few will be sorry to find it here:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“As I in hoary winter's night</span>  
<span class="i3">Stood shivering in the snow,</span>  
<span class="i2">Surprised I was with sudden heat,</span>  
<span class="i3">Which made my heart to glow;</span>  
<span class="i2">And lifting up a fearful eye</span>  
<span class="i3">To view what fire was near,</span>  
<span class="i2">A pretty Babe all burning bright</span>  
<span class="i3">Did in the air appear;</span>  
<span class="i2">Who, scorchèd with excessive heat,</span>  
<span class="i3">Such floods of tears did shed,</span>  
<span class="i2">As though His floods should quench His flames</span>  
<span class="i3">Which with His tears were fed.<span id="page_80">p.
80</span> <span id="Page_80"></span></span>  
<span class="i2">‘Alas!’ quoth He, ‘but newly born,</span>  
<span class="i3">In fiery heats I fry,</span>  
<span class="i2">Yet none approach to warm their hearts</span>  
<span class="i3">Or feel my fire, but I!</span>  
<span class="i2">My faultless breast the furnace is,</span>  
<span class="i3">The fuel, wounding thorns;</span>  
<span class="i2">Love is the fire, and sighs the smoke,</span>  
<span class="i3">The ashes, shame and scorns;</span>  
<span class="i2">The fuel Justice layeth on,</span>  
<span class="i3">And Mercy blows the coals,</span>  
<span class="i2">The metal in this furnace wrought</span>  
<span class="i3">Are men's defilèd souls,</span>  
<span class="i2">For which, as now on fire I am,</span>  
<span class="i3">To work them to their good,</span>  
<span class="i2">So will I melt into a bath,</span>  
<span class="i3">To wash them in my blood.’</span>  
<span class="i2">With this he vanished out of sight,</span>  
<span class="i3">And swiftly shrunk away:</span>  
<span class="i2">And straight I callèd unto mind</span>  
<span class="i3">That it was Christmas
Day.”﻿ [3-38](crt22.htm#Note_3-38.md)<span id="Nanchor_3-38"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

As for Crashaw,

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“That the great angel-blinding light should
shrink</span>  
<span class="i2">His blaze to shine in a poor shepherd's eye,</span>  
<span class="i2">That the unmeasured God so low should sink</span>  
<span class="i2">As Pris'ner in a few poor rags to lie,</span>  
<span class="i2">That from His mother's breast He milk should
drink</span>  
<span class="i2">Who feeds with nectar heaven's fair family,</span>  
<span class="i3">That a vile manger His low bed should prove</span>  
<span class="i3">Who in a throne of stars thunders above:</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">That He, whom the sun serves, should faintly
peep</span>  
<span class="i2">Through clouds of infant flesh; that He the
old</span>  
<span class="i2">Eternal Word should be a Child and weep,</span>  
<span class="i2">That He who made the fire should fear the
cold:</span>  
<span class="i2">That heaven's high majesty His court should
keep</span>  
<span class="i2">In a clay cottage, by each blast controll'd:</span>  
<span class="i3">That glory's self should serve our griefs and

<span class="i3">And free Eternity submit to
years﻿—”﻿ [3-39](crt22.htm#Note_3-39.md)<span id="Nanchor_3-39"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

such are the wondrous paradoxes celebrated in his glowing imagery. The
contrast of the winter snow with the burning <span id="page_81">p.
81</span> <span id="Page_81"></span>heat of Incarnate Love, of the
blinding light of Divinity with the night's darkness, indeed the whole
paradox of the Incarnation﻿—Infinity in extremest limitation﻿—is nowhere
realized with such intensity as by him. Yet, magnificent as are his best
lines, his verse sometimes becomes too like the seventeenth-century
Jesuit churches, with walls overladen with decoration, with great
languorous pictures and air heavy with incense; and then we long for the
dewy freshness of the early carols.

The representative Anglican poets of the seventeenth century, Herbert
and Vaughan, scarcely rise to their greatest heights in their treatment
of Christmas, but with them as with the Romanists it is the mystical
note that is dominant. Herbert sings:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“O Thou, whose glorious, yet contracted,
light,</span>  
<span class="i3">Wrapt in night's mantle, stole into a manger;</span>  
<span class="i2">Since my dark soul and brutish is Thy right,</span>  
<span class="i3">To man, of all beasts, be not Thou a stranger.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Furnish and deck my soul, that thou may'st
have</span>  
<span class="i2">A better lodging than a rack or
grave.”﻿ [3-40](crt22.htm#Note_3-40.md)<span id="Nanchor_3-40"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

And Vaughan:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“I would I had in my best part</span>  
<span class="i2">Fit rooms for Thee! or that my heart</span>  
<span class="i5">Were so clean as</span>  
<span class="i5">Thy manger was!</span>  
<span class="i2">But I am all filth, and obscene:</span>  
<span class="i2">Yet, if Thou wilt, Thou canst make clean.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Sweet Jesu! will then. Let no more</span>  
<span class="i2">This leper haunt and soil thy door!</span>  
<span class="i5">Cure him, ease him,</span>  
<span class="i5">O release him!</span>  
<span class="i2">And let once more, by mystic birth,</span>  
<span class="i2">The Lord of life be born in
earth.”﻿ [3-41](crt22.htm#Note_3-41.md)<span id="Nanchor_3-41"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

In Herrick﻿—how different a country parson from Herbert!﻿—we find a sort
of pagan piety towards the Divine Infant which, <span id="page_82">p.
82</span> <span id="Page_82"></span>though purely English in its
expression, makes us think of some French *Noëliste* or some present-day
Italian worshipper of the *Bambino*:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Instead of neat enclosures</span>  
<span class="i2">Of interwoven osiers,</span>  
<span class="i2">Instead of fragrant posies</span>  
<span class="i2">Of daffodils and roses,</span>  
<span class="i2">Thy cradle, kingly Stranger,</span>  
<span class="i4">As gospel tells,</span>  
<span class="i4">Was nothing else</span>  
<span class="i2">But here a homely manger.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">But we with silks not crewels,</span>  
<span class="i2">With sundry precious jewels,</span>  
<span class="i2">And lily work will dress Thee;</span>  
<span class="i2">And, as we dispossess Thee</span>  
<span class="i2">Of clouts, we'll make a chamber,</span>  
<span class="i4">Sweet Babe, for Thee,</span>  
<span class="i4">Of ivory,</span>  
<span class="i2">And plaster'd round with
amber.”﻿ [3-42](crt22.htm#Note_3-42.md)<span id="Nanchor_3-42"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

Poems such as Herrick's to the Babe of Bethlehem reveal in their writers
a certain childlikeness, an *insouciance* without irreverence, the
spirit indeed of a child which turns to its God quite simply and
naturally, which makes Him after its own child-image, and sees Him as a
friend who can be pleased with trifles﻿—almost, in fact, as a glorious
playmate. Such a nature has no intense feeling of sin, but can ask for
forgiveness and then forget; religion for it is rather an outward ritual
to be duly and gracefully performed than an inward transforming power.
Herrick is a strange exception among the Anglican singers of Christmas.

Milton's great Nativity hymn, with its wondrous blending of pastoral
simplicity and classical conceits, is too familiar for quotation here;
it may be suggested, however, that this work of the poet's youth is far
more Anglican than Puritan in its spirit.

Sweet and solemn Spenserian echoes are these verses from Giles
Fletcher's “Christ's Victory in Heaven”:﻿—<span id="page_83">p.
83</span> <span id="Page_83"></span>

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Who can forget﻿—never to be forgot﻿—</span>  
<span class="i2">The time, that all the world in slumber lies,</span>  
<span class="i2">When, like the stars, the singing angels shot</span>  
<span class="i2">To earth, and heaven awakèd all his eyes</span>  
<span class="i2">To see another sun at midnight rise</span>  
<span class="i3">On earth? Was never sight of pareil fame,</span>  
<span class="i3">For God before man like Himself did frame,</span>  
<span class="i2">But God Himself now like a mortal man became.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">A Child He was, and had not learnt to speak,</span>  
<span class="i2">That with His word the world before did make;</span>  
<span class="i2">His mother's arms Him bore, He was so weak,</span>  
<span class="i2">That with one hand the vaults of heaven could
shake,</span>  
<span class="i2">See how small room my infant Lord doth take,</span>  
<span class="i3">Whom all the world is not enough to hold!</span>  
<span class="i3">Who of His years, or of His age hath told?</span>  
<span class="i2">Never such age so young, never a child so
old.”﻿ [3-43](crt22.htm#Note_3-43.md)<span id="Nanchor_3-43"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

The old lullaby tradition is continued by Wither, though the infant in
the cradle is an ordinary human child, who is rocked to sleep with the
story of his Lord:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“A little Infant once was He,</span>  
<span class="i4">And strength in weakness then was laid</span>  
<span class="i2">Upon His virgin-mother's knee,</span>  
<span class="i4">That power to thee might be conveyed.</span>  
<span class="i6">Sweet baby, then, forbear to weep;</span>  
<span class="i6">Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">\*       \*       \*       \*       \*</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Within a manger lodged thy Lord,</span>  
<span class="i4">Where oxen lay and asses fed;</span>  
<span class="i2">Warm rooms we do to thee afford,</span>  
<span class="i4">An easy cradle or a bed.</span>  
<span class="i6">Sweet baby, then, forbear to weep;</span>  
<span class="i6">Be still, my babe; sweet baby,
sleep.”﻿ [3-44](crt22.htm#Note_3-44.md)<span id="Nanchor_3-44"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

When we come to the eighteenth century we find, where we might least
expect it, among the moral verses of Dr. Watts, a charming cradle-song
conceived in just the same way:﻿—<span id="page_84">p. 84</span> <span
id="Page_84"></span>

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber,</span>  
<span class="i4">Holy angels guard thy bed!</span>  
<span class="i2">Heavenly blessings without number</span>  
<span class="i4">Gently falling on thy head.</span>  

</div>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Soft and easy is thy cradle;</span>  
<span class="i4">Coarse and hard thy Saviour lay.</span>  
<span class="i2">When His birthplace was a stable,</span>  
<span class="i4">And His softest bed was hay.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">\*       \*       \*       \*       \*</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Lo He slumbers in His manger</span>  
<span class="i4">Where the hornèd oxen fed;</span>  
<span class="i2">﻿—Peace, my darling, here's no danger;</span>  
<span class="i4">Here's no ox a-near thy
bed.”﻿ [3-45](crt22.htm#Note_3-45.md)<span id="Nanchor_3-45"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

It is to the eighteenth century that the three most popular of English
Christmas hymns belong. Nahum Tate's “While shepherds watched their
flocks by night”﻿—one of the very few hymns (apart from metrical psalms)
in common use in the Anglican Church before the nineteenth century﻿—is a
bald and apparently artless paraphrase of St. Luke which, by some
accident, has attained dignity, and is aided greatly by the simple and
noble tune now attached to it. Charles Wesley's “Hark, the herald angels
sing,” or﻿—as it should be﻿—“Hark, how all the welkin rings,” is much
admired by some, but to the present writer seems a mere piece of
theological rhetoric. Byrom's “Christians, awake, salute the happy
morn,” has the stiffness and formality or its period, but it is not
without a certain quaintness and dignity. One could hardly expect fine
Christmas poetry of an age whose religion was on the one hand staid,
rational, unimaginative, and on the other “Evangelical” in the narrow
sense, finding its centre in the Atonement rather than the Incarnation.

The revived mediaevalism, religious and aesthetic, of the nineteenth
century, produced a number of Christmas carols. Some, like Swinburne's
“Three damsels in the queen's chamber,” with <span id="page_85">p.
85</span> <span id="Page_85"></span>its exquisite verbal music and
delightful colour, and William Morris's less successful “Masters, in
this hall,” and “Outlanders, whence come ye last?” are the work of
unbelievers and bear witness only to the aesthetic charm of the
Christmas story; but there are others, mostly from Roman or
Anglo-Catholic sources, of real religious
inspiration.﻿ [34](crt24.htm#Footnote_34.md)<span id="FNanchor_34"></span>
The most spontaneous are Christina Rossetti's, whose haunting rhythms
and delicate feeling are shown at their best in her songs of the Christ
Child. More studied and self-conscious are the austere Christmas verses
of Lionel Johnson and the graceful carols of Professor Selwyn Image. In
one poem Mr. Image strikes a deeper and stronger note than elsewhere;
its solemn music takes us back to an earlier century:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“Consider, O my soul, what morn is this!</span>  
<span class="i4">Whereon the eternal Lord of all things made,</span>  
<span class="i2">For us, poor mortals, and our endless bliss,</span>  
<span class="i4">Came down from heaven; and, in a manger laid,</span>  
<span class="i4">The first, rich, offerings of our ransom paid:</span>  
<span class="i2">Consider, O my soul, what morn is
this!”﻿ [3-46](crt22.htm#Note_3-46.md)<span id="Nanchor_3-46"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

Not a few contemporary poets have given us Christmas carols or poems.
Among the freshest and most natural are those of Katharine Tynan, while
Mr. Gilbert Chesterton has written some Christmas lyrics full of colour
and vitality, and with a true mystical quality. Singing of Christmas,
Mr. Chesterton is at his best; he has instinctive sympathy with the
spirit of the festival, its human kindliness, its democracy, its
sacramentalism, its exaltation of the child:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“The thatch of the roof was as golden</span>  
<span class="i4">Though dusty the straw was and old;</span>  
<span class="i2">The wind had a peal as of trumpets,</span>  
<span class="i4">Though blowing and barren and cold.<span
id="page_86">p. 86</span> <span id="Page_86"></span></span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">The mother's hair was a glory,</span>  
<span class="i4">Though loosened and torn;</span>  
<span class="i2">For under the eaves in the gloaming</span>  
<span class="i4">A child was born.”﻿ [3-47](crt22.htm#Note_3-47.md)<span
id="Nanchor_3-47"></span> </span>  

</div>

</div>

Thus opens a fine poem on the Nativity as symbolizing miracle of birth,
of childhood with its infinite possibilities, eternal renewal of faith
and hope.
