*Christmas in Ritual and Tradition*, by Clement A. Miles, \[1912\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## <span id="PREFACE"></span>PREFACE

In this volume I have tried to show how Christmas is or has been kept in
various lands and ages, and to trace as far as possible the origin of
the pagan elements that have mingled with the Church's feast of the
Nativity.

In Part I. I have dealt with the festival on its distinctively Christian
side. The book has, however, been so planned that readers not interested
in this aspect of Christmas may pass over  [II](crt05.htm#Chapter_II.md),
and proceed at once from the Introduction to  [II](crt10.htm#Part_II.md),
which treats of pagan survivals.

The book has been written primarily for the general reader, but I
venture to hope that, with all its imperfections, it may be of some use
to the more serious student, as a rough outline map of the field of
Christmas customs, and as bringing together materials hitherto scattered
through a multitude of volumes in various languages. There is certainly
room for a comprehensive English book on Christmas, taking account of
the results of modern historical and folk-lore research.

The writer of a work of this kind necessarily owes an immense debt to
the labours of others. In my bibliographical notes I have done my best
to acknowledge the sources from which I have drawn. It is only right
that I should express here my special obligation, both for information
and for suggestions, to Mr. E. K. Chambers's “The Mediaeval Stage,” an
invaluable storehouse of fact, theory, and bibliographical references. I
also owe much to the important monographs of Dr. A. Tille, “Die
Geschichte der deutschen Weihnacht” and “Yule and Christmas”; to Dr.
Feilberg's Danish work, “Jul,” the fullest account of Christmas<span
id="page_6">p. 6</span> <span id="Page_6"></span> customs yet written;
and of course, like every student of folk-lore, to Dr. Frazer's “The
Golden Bough.”

References to authorities will be found at the end of the volume, and
are indicated by small numerals in the text; notes requiring to be read
in close conjunction with the text are printed at the foot of the pages
to which they relate, and are indicated by asterisks, &c.

> \[Transcriber's Note: The 'small numerals' are represented in this
> ebook by numbers in . The footnotes appear at the end of the ebook and
> are indicated by numbers in \[square brackets\].\]

I have to thank Mr. Frank Sidgwick for most kindly reading my proofs and
portions of my MS., and for some valuable suggestions.
