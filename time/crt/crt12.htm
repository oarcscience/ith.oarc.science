<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN class=smcap>St. Clement's Day.</SPAN></H3>
<P>The next folk-feast after Martinmas is St. Clement's Day, November&nbsp;23, 
once reckoned the first day of winter in England.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-1">9-1</A><a name="Nanchor_9-1"></A> It marks apparently one of the stages in the progress 
of the winter feast towards its present solstitial date. In England some 
interesting popular customs existed on this day. In Staffordshire children used 
to go round to the village houses begging for gifts, with rhymes resembling in 
many ways the &#8220;souling&#8221; verses I have already quoted. Here is one of the 
Staffordshire &#8220;clemencing&#8221; songs:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i15>&#8220;Clemany! Clemany! Clemany 
mine!</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>A good red apple and a pint of 
wine,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>Some of your mutton and some of your 
veal,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>If it is good, pray give me a

salt.</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>Butler, butler, fill your bowl;</SPAN><BR><SPAN  class=i2>If thou fill'st it of the best,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>The Lord'll

small,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>Down goes butler, bowl and all.<A NAME="page_212"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 212</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_212"></A></SPAN><BR></DIV>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i2>Pray, good mistress, send to me</SPAN><BR><SPAN  class=i2>One for Peter, one for Paul,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>One for Him who

red apple and I'll be gone.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-2">9-2</A><a name="Nanchor_9-2"></A> </SPAN><BR></DIV></DIV>
<P>In Worcestershire on St. Clement's Day the boys chanted similar rhymes, and 
at the close of their collection they would roast the apples received and throw 
them into ale or cider.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-3">9-3</A><a name="Nanchor_9-3"></A> In the north of England men used to go about begging 
drink, and at Ripon Minster the choristers went round the church offering 
everyone a rosy apple with a sprig of box on it.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-4">9-4</A><a name="Nanchor_9-4"></A> The Cambridge bakers held their annual supper on this 
day,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-5">9-5</A><a name="Nanchor_9-5"></A> at Tenby the fishermen were given a supper,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-6">9-6</A><a name="Nanchor_9-6"></A> while the blacksmiths&#146; apprentices at Woolwich had a 
remarkable ceremony, akin perhaps to the Boy Bishop customs. One of their number 
was chosen to play the part of &#8220;Old Clem,&#8221; was attired in a great coat, and wore 
a mask, a long white beard, and an oakum wig. Seated in a large wooden chair, 
and surrounded by attendants bearing banners, torches, and weapons, he was borne 
about the town on the shoulders of six men, visiting numerous public-houses and 
the blacksmiths and officers of the dockyard. Before him he had a wooden anvil, 
and in his hands a pair of tongs and a wooden hammer, the insignia of the 
blacksmith's trade.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-7">9-7</A><a name="Nanchor_9-7"></A> </P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN class=smcap>St. Catherine's Day.</SPAN></H3>
<P>November&nbsp;25 is St. Catherine's Day, and at Woolwich Arsenal a similar 
ceremony was then performed: a man was dressed in female attire, with a large 
wheel by his side to represent the saint, and was taken round the town&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-8">9-8</A><a name="Nanchor_9-8"></A> in a wooden chair. At Chatham there was a torchlight 
procession on St. Catherine's Day, and a woman in white muslin with a gilt crown 
was carried about in a chair. She was said to represent not the saint, but Queen 
Catherine.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-9">9-9</A><a name="Nanchor_9-9"></A> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_213"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 213</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_213"></A>St. Catherine's Day was formerly a festival for the 
lacemakers of Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, and Bedfordshire. She was the 
patroness of spinsters in the literal as well as the modern sense of the word, 
and at Peterborough the workhouse girls used to go in procession round the city 
on her day, dressed in white with coloured ribbons; the tallest was chosen as 
Queen and bore a crown and sceptre. As they went to beg money of the chief 
inhabitants they sang a quaint ballad which begins thus:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i15>&#8220;Here comes Queen Catherine, as fine as any 
queen,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>With a coach and six horses a-coming to be 
seen,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i4>And a-spinning we will go, will go, will 
go,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i4>And a-spinning we will go.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-10">9-10</A><a name="Nanchor_9-10"></A> </SPAN><BR></DIV></DIV>
<P>We may perhaps see in this Saint or Queen Catherine a female counterpart of 
the Boy Bishop, who began his career on St. Nicholas's Day. Catherine, it must 
be remembered, is the patron saint of girls as Nicholas is of boys. In Belgium 
her day is still a festival for the &#8220;young person&#8221; both in schools and in 
families.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-11">9-11</A><a name="Nanchor_9-11"></A> Even in modern Paris the dressmaker-girls celebrate 
it, and in a very charming way, too.</P>
<P>&#8220;At midday the girls of every workroom present little mob-caps trimmed with 
yellow ribbons to those of their number who are over twenty-five and still 
unmarried. Then they themselves put on becoming little caps with yellow flowers 
and yellow ribbons and a sprig of orange blossom on them, and out they go 
arm-in-arm to parade the streets and collect a tribute of flowers from every man 
they meet.... Instead of working all the afternoon, the midinettes entertain all 
their friends (no men admitted, though, for it is the day of St. Catherine) to 
concerts and even to dramatic performances in the workrooms, where the 
work-tables are turned into stages, and the employers provide supper.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-12">9-12</A><a name="Nanchor_9-12"></A> </P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN class=smcap>St. Andrew's Day.</SPAN></H3>
<P>The last day of November is the feast of St. Andrew. Of English customs on 
this day the most interesting perhaps are those connected with the &#8220;Tander&#8221; or 
&#8220;Tandrew&#8221; merrymakings <A NAME="page_214"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 214</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_214"></A>of the Northamptonshire lacemakers. A day of general 
licence used to end in masquerading. Women went about in male attire and men and 
boys in female dress.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-13">9-13</A><a name="Nanchor_9-13"></A> In Kent and Sussex squirrel-hunting was practised on 
this day&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-14">9-14</A><a name="Nanchor_9-14"></A> &#65279;&#8212;a survival apparently of some old sacrificial 
custom comparable with the hunting of the wren at Christmas (see &nbsp;<a href="crt16.htm#Chapter_XII">XII</A>).</P>
<P>In Germany St. Andrew's Eve is a great occasion for prognostications of the 
future. Indeed, like Hallowe'en in Great Britain, <I>Andreasabend</I> in Germany 
seems to have preserved the customs of augury connected with the old November 
New Year festival.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-15">9-15</A><a name="Nanchor_9-15"></A> To a large extent the practices are performed by 
girls anxious to know what sort of husband they will get. Many and various are 
the methods.</P>
<P>Sometimes it suffices to repeat some such rhyme as the following before going 
to sleep, and the future husband will appear in a dream:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i15>&#8220;St. Andrew's Eve is to-day,</SPAN><BR><SPAN  class=i2>Sleep all people,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>Sleep all children of 
men,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>Who are between heaven and earth,</SPAN><BR><SPAN  class=i2>Except this only man,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>Who may be mine in 
marriage.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-16">9-16</A><a name="Nanchor_9-16"></A> </SPAN><BR></DIV></DIV>
<P>Again, at nightfall let a girl shut herself up naked in her bedroom, take two 
beakers, and into one pour clear water, into the other wine. These let her place 
on the table, which is to be covered with white, and let the following words be 
said:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i15>&#8220;My dear St. Andrew!</SPAN><BR><SPAN  class=i2>Let now appear before me</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>My heart's most 
dearly beloved.</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>If he shall be rich,</SPAN><BR><SPAN  class=i2>He will pour a cup of wine;</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>If he is to be 
poor,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>Let him pour a cup of 
water.&#8221;</SPAN><BR></DIV></DIV>
<P>This done, the form of the future husband will enter and drink <A NAME="page_215"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 215</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_215"></A>of one of the cups. If he is poor, he will take the water; 
if rich, the wine.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-17">9-17</A><a name="Nanchor_9-17"></A> </P>
<P>One of the most common practices is to pour molten lead or tin through a key 
into cold water, and to discover the calling of the future husband by the form 
it takes, which will represent the tools of his trade. The white of an egg is 
sometimes used for the same purpose.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-18">9-18</A><a name="Nanchor_9-18"></A> Another very widespread custom is to put nutshells to 
float on water with little candles burning in them. There are twice as many 
shells as there are girls present; each girl has her shell, and to the others 
the names of possible suitors are given. The man and the girl whose shells come 
together will marry one another. Sometimes the same method is practised with 
little cups of silver foil.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-19">9-19</A><a name="Nanchor_9-19"></A> </P>
<P>On the border of Saxony and Bohemia, a maiden who wishes to know the bodily 
build of her future husband goes in the darkness to a stack of wood and draws 
out a piece. If the wood is smooth and straight the man will be slim and well 
built; if it is crooked, or knotted, he will be ill-developed or even a 
hunchback.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-20">9-20</A><a name="Nanchor_9-20"></A> </P>
<P>These are but a few of the many ways in which girls seek to peer into the 
future and learn something about the most important event in their lives. Far 
less numerous, but not altogether absent on this night, are other kinds of 
prognostication. A person, for instance, who wishes to know whether he will die 
in the coming year, must on St. Andrew's Eve before going to bed make on the 
table a little pointed heap of flour. If by the morning it has fallen asunder, 
the maker will die.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-21">9-21</A><a name="Nanchor_9-21"></A> </P>
<P>The association of St. Andrew's Eve with the foreseeing of the future is not 
confined to the German race; it is found also on Slavonic and Roumanian ground. 
In Croatia he who fasts then will behold his future wife in a dream,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-22">9-22</A><a name="Nanchor_9-22"></A> and among the Roumanians mothers anxious about their 
children's luck break small sprays from fruit-trees, bind them together in 
bunches, one for each child, and put them in a glass of water. The branch of the 
lucky one will blossom.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-23">9-23</A><a name="Nanchor_9-23"></A> </P>
<P>In Roumania St. Andrew's Eve is a creepy time, for on it vampires are 
supposed to rise from their graves, and with coffins <A NAME="page_216"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 216</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_216"></A>on their heads walk about the houses in which they once 
lived. Before nightfall every woman takes some garlic and anoints with it the 
door locks and window casements; this will keep away the vampires. At the 
cross-roads there is a great fight of these loathsome beings until the first 
cock crows; and not only the dead take part in this, but also some living men 
who are vampires from their birth. Sometimes it is only the souls of these 
living vampires that join in the fight; the soul comes out through the mouth in 
the form of a bluish flame, takes the shape of an animal, and runs to the 
crossway. If the body meanwhile is moved from its place the person dies, for the 
soul cannot find its way back.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-24">9-24</A><a name="Nanchor_9-24"></A> </P>
<P>St. Andrew's Day is sometimes the last, sometimes the first important 
festival of the western Church's year. It is regarded in parts of Germany as the 
beginning of winter, as witness the saying:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i15>&#8220;S&uuml;nten-Dres-Misse,</SPAN><BR><SPAN  class=i2>es de Winter gewisse.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_93">93</A><a name="FNanchor_93"></A>&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-25">9-25</A><a name="Nanchor_9-25"></A> </SPAN><BR></DIV></DIV>
<P>The nights are now almost at their longest, and as November passes away, 
giving place to the last month of the year, Christmas is felt to be near at 
hand.</P>
<P>In northern Bohemia it is customary for peasant girls to keep for themselves 
all the yarn they spin on St. Andrew's Eve, and the <I>Hausfrau</I> gives them 
also some flax and a little money. With this they buy coffee and other 
refreshments for the lads who come to visit the parlours where in the long 
winter evenings the women sit spinning. These evenings, when many gather 
together in a brightly lighted room and sing songs and tell stories while they 
spin, are cheerful enough, and spice is added by the visits of the village lads, 
who in some places come to see the girls home.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-26">9-26</A><a name="Nanchor_9-26"></A> </P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN class=smcap>The Kl&ouml;pfeln&auml;chte.</SPAN></H3>
<P>On the Thursday nights in Advent it is customary in southern Germany for 
children or grown-up people to go from house <A NAME="page_217"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 217</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_217"></A>to house, singing hymns and knocking on the doors with rods 
or little hammers, or throwing peas, lentils, and the like against the windows. 
Hence these evenings have gained the name of <I>Kl&ouml;pfel</I> or 
<I>Kn&ouml;pflinsn&auml;chte</I> (Knocking Nights).&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-27">9-27</A><a name="Nanchor_9-27"></A> The practice is described by Naogeorgus in the 
sixteenth century:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i15>&#8220;Three weekes before the day whereon was borne 
the Lord of Grace,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>And on the Thursdaye Boyes and 
Girles do runne in every place,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>And bounce and beate at 
every doore, with blowes and lustie snaps,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>And crie, 
the Advent of the Lorde not borne as yet perhaps.</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>And 
wishing to the neighbours all, that in the houses dwell,</SPAN><BR><SPAN  class=i2>A happie yeare, and every thing to spring and prosper 
well:</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>Here have they peares, and plumbs, and pence, ech 
man gives willinglee,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>For these three nightes are 
alwayes thought, unfortunate to bee;</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>Wherein they are 
afrayde of sprites and cankred witches&#146; spight,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>And 
dreadfull devils blacke and grim, that then have chiefest might.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-28">9-28</A><a name="Nanchor_9-28"></A> </SPAN><BR></DIV></DIV>
<P>With it may be compared the Macedonian custom for village boys to go in 
parties at nightfall on Christmas Eve, knocking at the cottage doors with 
sticks, shouting <I>Kolianda! Kolianda!</I> and receiving presents,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-29">9-29</A><a name="Nanchor_9-29"></A> and also one in vogue in Holland between Christmas 
and the Epiphany. There &#8220;the children go out in couples, each boy carrying an 
earthenware pot, over which a bladder is stretched, with a piece of stick tied 
in the middle. When this stick is twirled about, a not very melodious grumbling 
sound proceeds from the contrivance, which is known by the name of &#145;Rommelpot.&#146; 
By going about in this manner the children are able to collect some few 
pence.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-30">9-30</A><a name="Nanchor_9-30"></A> </P>
<P>Can such practices have originated in attempts to drive out evil spirits from 
the houses by noise? Similar methods are used for that purpose by various 
European and other peoples.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-31">9-31</A><a name="Nanchor_9-31"></A> Anyhow something mysterious hangs about the 
<I>Kl&ouml;pfeln&auml;chte</I>. They are occasions for girls to learn about their future 
husbands, and upon them in Swabia goes about Pelzm&auml;rte, whom we already know.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-32">9-32</A><a name="Nanchor_9-32"></A> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_218"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 218</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_218"></A>In Tyrol curious mummeries are then performed. At Pillersee 
in the Lower Innthal two youths combine to form a mimic ass, upon which a third 
rides, and they are followed by a motley train. The ass falls sick and has to be 
cured by a &#8220;vet,&#8221; and all kinds of satirical jokes are made about things that 
have happened in the parish during the year. Elsewhere two men dress up in straw 
as husband and wife, and go out with a masked company. The pair wrangle with one 
another and carry on a play of wits with the peasants whose house they are 
visiting. Sometimes the satire is so cutting that permanent enmities ensue, and 
for this reason the practice is gradually being dropped.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-33">9-33</A><a name="Nanchor_9-33"></A> </P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN class=smcap>St. Nicholas's Day.</SPAN></H3>
<P>On December&nbsp;6 we reach the most distinctive children's festival of the 
whole year, St. Nicholas's Day. In England it has gone out of mind, and in the 
flat north of Germany Protestantism has largely rooted it out, as savouring too 
much of saint-worship, and transferred its festivities to the more Evangelical 
season of Christmas.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-34">9-34</A><a name="Nanchor_9-34"></A> In western and southern Germany, however, and in 
Austria, Switzerland, and the Low Countries, it is still a day of joy for 
children, though in some regions even there its radiance tends to pale before 
the greater glory of the Christmas-tree.</P>
<P>It is not easy either to get at the historic facts about St. Nicholas, the 
fourth-century bishop of Myra in Asia Minor, or to ascertain why he became the 
patron saint of boys. The legends of his infant piety and his later wondrous 
works for the benefit of young people may either have given rise, or be 
themselves due to, his connection with children.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-35">9-35</A><a name="Nanchor_9-35"></A> In eastern Europe and southern Italy he is above all 
things the saint of seafaring men, and among the Greeks his cult has perhaps 
replaced that of Artemis as a sea divinity.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-36">9-36</A><a name="Nanchor_9-36"></A> This aspect of him does not, however, appear in the 
German festival customs with which we are here chiefly concerned.</P>
<P>It has already been hinted that in some respects St. Nicholas is a duplicate 
of St. Martin. His feast, indeed, is probably a later beginning-of-winter 
festival, dating from the period when <A NAME="page_219"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 219</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_219"></A>improved methods of agriculture and other causes made early 
December, rather than mid-November, the time for the great annual slaughter and 
its attendant rejoicings. Like St. Martin he brings sweet things for the good 
children and rods for the bad.</P>
<P>St. Nicholas's Eve is a time of festive stir in Holland and Belgium; the 
shops are full of pleasant little gifts: many-shaped biscuits, gilt 
gingerbreads, sometimes representing the saint, sugar images, toys, and other 
trifles. In many places, when evening comes on, people dress up as St. Nicholas, 
with mitre and pastoral staff, enquire about the behaviour of the children, and 
if it has been good pronounce a benediction and promise them a reward next 
morning. Before they go to bed the children put out their shoes, with hay, 
straw, or a carrot in them for the saint's white horse or ass. When they wake in 
the morning, if they have been &#8220;good&#8221; the fodder is gone and sweet things or 
toys are in its place; if they have misbehaved themselves the provender is 
untouched and no gift but a rod is there.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-37">9-37</A><a name="Nanchor_9-37"></A> </P>
<P>In various parts of Germany, Switzerland, and Austria St. Nicholas is mimed 
by a man dressed up as a bishop.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-38">9-38</A><a name="Nanchor_9-38"></A> In Tyrol children pray to the saint on his Eve and 
leave out hay for his white horse and a glass of <I>schnaps</I> for his servant. 
And he comes in all the splendour of a church-image, a reverend grey-haired 
figure with flowing beard, gold-broidered cope, glittering mitre, and pastoral 
staff. Children who know their catechism are rewarded with sweet things out of 
the basket carried by his servant; those who cannot answer are reproved, and St. 
Nicholas points to a terrible form that stands behind him with a rod&#65279;&#8212;the 
hideous Klaubauf, a shaggy monster with horns, black face, fiery eyes, long red 
tongue, and chains that clank as he moves.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-39">9-39</A><a name="Nanchor_9-39"></A> </P>
<P>In Lower Austria the saint is followed by a similar figure called Krampus or 
Grampus;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-40">9-40</A><a name="Nanchor_9-40"></A> in Styria this horrible attendant is named Bartel;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-41">9-41</A><a name="Nanchor_9-41"></A> all are no doubt related to such monsters as the 
<I>Klapperbock</I> (see &nbsp;<a href="crt11.htm#Chapter_VII">VII</A>). Their heathen origin is evident though it is difficult to trace their 
exact pedigree. Sometimes St. Nicholas himself appears in a non-churchly form 
like Pelzm&auml;rte, with a bell,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-42">9-42</A><a name="Nanchor_9-42"></A> or with a sack of ashes which gains him the name of 
Aschenklas.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-43">9-43</A><a name="Nanchor_9-43"></A> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_220"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 220</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_220"></A>Not only by hideous figures is St. Nicholas attended. 
Sometimes, as at Warnsdorf near Rumburg, there come with him the forms of Christ 
Himself, St. Peter, an angel, and the famous Knecht Ruprecht, whom we shall meet 
again on Christmas Eve. They are represented by children, and a little drama is 
performed, one personage coming in after the other and calling for the next in 
the manner of the English mummers&#146; play. St. Nicholas, St. Peter, and Ruprecht 
accuse the children of all kinds of naughtiness, the &#8220;Heiliger Christ&#8221; 
intercedes and at last throws nuts down and receives money from the parents.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-44">9-44</A><a name="Nanchor_9-44"></A> In Tyrol there are St. Nicholas plays of a more comic 
nature, performed publicly by large companies of players and introducing a 
number of humorous characters and much rude popular wit.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-45">9-45</A><a name="Nanchor_9-45"></A> </P>
<P>Sometimes a female bogey used to appear: Budelfrau in Lower Austria, Berchtel 
in Swabia, Buzebergt in the neighbourhood of Augsburg.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-46">9-46</A><a name="Nanchor_9-46"></A> The last two are plainly variants of Berchte, who is 
specially connected with the Epiphany. Berchtel used to punish the naughty 
children with a rod, and reward the good with nuts and apples; Buzebergt wore 
black rags, had her face blackened and her hair hanging unkempt, and carried a 
pot of starch which she smeared upon people's faces.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-47">9-47</A><a name="Nanchor_9-47"></A> </P>
<P>As Santa Klaus St. Nicholas is of course known to every English child, but 
rather as a sort of incarnation of Christmas than as a saint with a day of his 
own. Santa Klaus, probably, has come to us <I>vi&acirc;</I> the United States, whither 
the Dutch took him, and where he has still immense popularity.</P>
<P>In the Middle Ages in England as elsewhere the Eve of St. Nicholas was a day 
of great excitement for boys. It was then that the small choristers and servers 
in cathedral and other churches generally elected their &#8220;Boy Bishop&#8221; or 
&#8220;Nicholas.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-48">9-48</A><a name="Nanchor_9-48"></A> He had in some places to officiate at First Vespers 
and at the services on the festival itself. As a rule, however, the feast of the 
Holy Innocents, December&nbsp;28, was probably the most important day in the Boy 
Bishop's career, and we may therefore postpone our consideration of him. We will 
here only note his connection with the festival of the patron saint of boys, a 
connection perhaps implying a common origin for him and <A NAME="page_221"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 221</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_221"></A>for the St. Nicholases who in bishops&#146; vestments make their 
present-giving rounds.</P>
<P>The festival of St. Nicholas is naturally celebrated with most splendour at 
the place where his body lies, the seaport of Bari in south-eastern Italy. The 
holy bones are preserved in a sepulchre beneath a crypt of rich Saracenic 
architecture, above which rises a magnificent church. Legend relates that in the 
eleventh century they were stolen by certain merchants of Bari from the saint's 
own cathedral at Myra in Asia Minor. The tomb of St. Nicholas is a famous centre 
for pilgrimages, and on the 6th of December many thousands of the faithful, 
bearing staves bound with olive and pine, visit it. An interesting ceremony on 
the festival is the taking of the saint's image out to sea by the sailors of the 
port. They return with it at nightfall, and a great procession escorts it back 
to the cathedral with torches and fireworks and chanting.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-49">9-49</A><a name="Nanchor_9-49"></A> Here may be seen the other, the seafaring, aspect of 
St. Nicholas; by this mariners&#146; cult we are taken far away from the 
present-giving saint who delights the small children of the North.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN class=smcap>St. Lucia's Day.</SPAN></H3>
<P>The only folk-festivals of note between St. Nicholas's Day and Christmas are 
those of St. Lucia (December&nbsp;13) and St. Thomas the Apostle 
(December&nbsp;21).</P>
<P>In Sweden St. Lucia's Day was formerly marked by some interesting practices. 
It was, so to speak, the entrance to the Christmas festival, and was called 
&#8220;little Yule.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-50">9-50</A><a name="Nanchor_9-50"></A> At the first cock-crow, between 1 and 4 a.m., the 
prettiest girl in the house used to go among the sleeping folk, dressed in a 
white robe, a red sash, and a wire crown covered with whortleberry-twigs and 
having nine lighted candles fastened in it. She awakened the sleepers and 
regaled them with a sweet drink or with coffee,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_94">94</A><a name="FNanchor_94"></A> sang a special song, and was named &#8220;Lussi&#8221; or 
&#8220;Lussibruden&#8221; (Lucy bride). When everyone was dressed, breakfast was taken, the 
room being lighted by many candles. The domestic animals <A NAME="page_222"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 222</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_222"></A>were not forgotten on this day, but were given special 
portions. A peculiar feature of the Swedish custom is the presence of lights on 
Lussi's crown. Lights indeed are the special mark of the festival; it was 
customary to shoot and fish on St. Lucy's Day by torchlight, the parlours, as 
has been said, were brilliantly illuminated in the early morning, in West 
Gothland Lussi went round the village preceded by torchbearers, and in one 
parish she was represented by a cow with a crown of lights on her head. In 
schools the day was celebrated with illuminations.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-51">9-51</A><a name="Nanchor_9-51"></A> </P>
<P>What is the explanation of this feast of lights? There is nothing in the 
legend of the saint to account for it; her name, however, at once suggests 
<I>lux</I>&#65279;&#8212;light. It is possible, as Dr. Feilberg supposes, that the name gave 
rise to the special use of lights among the Latin-learned monks who brought 
Christianity to Sweden, and that the custom spread from them to the common 
people. A peculiar fitness would be found in it because St. Lucia's Day 
according to the Old Style was the shortest day of the year, the turning-point 
of the sun's light.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-52">9-52</A><a name="Nanchor_9-52"></A> </P>
<P>In Sicily also St. Lucia's festival is a feast of lights. After sunset on the 
Eve a long procession of men, lads, and children, each flourishing a thick bunch 
of long straws all afire, rushes wildly down the streets of the mountain village 
of Montedoro, as if fleeing from some danger, and shouting hoarsely. &#8220;The 
darkness of the night,&#8221; says an eye-witness, &#8220;was lighted up by this savage 
procession of dancing, flaming torches, whilst bonfires in all the side streets 
gave the illusion that the whole village was burning.&#8221; At the end of the 
procession came the image of Santa Lucia, holding a dish which contained her 
eyes.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_95">95</A><a name="FNanchor_95"></A> In the midst of the <I>piazza</I> a great mountain of 
straw had been prepared; on this everyone threw his own burning torch, and the 
saint was placed in a spot from which she could survey the vast bonfire.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-53">9-53</A><a name="Nanchor_9-53"></A> </P>
<P>In central Europe we see St. Lucia in other aspects. In the B&ouml;hmerwald she 
goes round the village in the form of a nanny-goat with horns, gives fruit to 
the good children, and threatens to rip open the belly of the naughty. Here she 
is evidently related <A NAME="page_223"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 223</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_223"></A>to the pagan monsters already described. In Tyrol she plays 
a more graceful part: she brings presents for girls, an office which St. 
Nicholas is there supposed to perform for boys only.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-55">9-55</A><a name="Nanchor_9-55"></A> </P>
<P>In Lower Austria St. Lucia's Eve is a time when special danger from 
witchcraft is feared and must be averted by prayer and incense. A procession is 
made through each house to cense every room. On this evening, too, girls are 
afraid to spin lest in the morning they should find their distaffs twisted, the 
threads broken, and the yarn in confusion. (We shall meet with like 
superstitions during the Twelve Nights.) At midnight the girls practise a 
strange ceremony: they go to a willow-bordered brook, cut the bark of a tree 
partly away, without detaching it, make with a knife a cross on the inner side 
of the cut bark, moisten it with water, and carefully close up the opening. On 
New Year's Day the cutting is opened, and the future is augured from the 
markings found. The lads, on the other hand, look out at midnight for a 
mysterious light, the <I>Luzieschein</I>, the forms of which indicate coming 
events.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-56">9-56</A><a name="Nanchor_9-56"></A> </P>
<P>In Denmark, too, St. Lucia's Eve is a time for seeing the future. Here is a 
prayer of Danish maids: &#8220;Sweet St. Lucy let me know: whose cloth I shall lay, 
whose bed I shall make, whose child I shall bear, whose darling I shall be, 
whose arms I shall sleep in.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-57">9-57</A><a name="Nanchor_9-57"></A> </P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN class=smcap>St. Thomas's Day.</SPAN></H3>
<P>Many and various are the customs and beliefs associated with the feast of St. 
Thomas (December&nbsp;21). In Denmark it was formerly a great children's day, 
unique in the year, and rather resembling the mediaeval Boy Bishop festival. It 
was the breaking-up day for schools; the children used to bring their master an 
offering of candles and money, and in return he gave them a feast. In some 
places it had an even more delightful side: for this one day in the year the 
children were allowed the mastery in the school. Testimonials to their 
scholarship and industry were made out, and elaborate titles were added to their 
names, as exalted sometimes as &#8220;Pope,&#8221; &#8220;Emperor,&#8221; or &#8220;Empress.&#8221; Poor children 
used to go about showing these <A NAME="page_224"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 224</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_224"></A>documents and collecting money. Games and larks of all 
sorts went on in the schools without a word of reproof, and the children were 
wont to burn their master's rod.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-58">9-58</A><a name="Nanchor_9-58"></A> </P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Antwerp children go early to school on St. Thomas's 
Day, and lock the master out, until he promises to treat them with ale or other 
drink. After this they buy a cock and hen, which are allowed to escape and have 
to be caught by the boys or the girls respectively. The girl who catches the hen 
is called &#8220;queen,&#8221; the boy who gets the cock, &#8220;king.&#8221; Elsewhere in Belgium 
children lock out their parents, and servants their masters, while schoolboys 
bind their teacher to his chair and carry him over to the inn. There he has to 
buy back his liberty by treating his scholars with punch and cakes. Instead of 
the chase for the fowls, it was up to 1850 the custom in the Ardennes for the 
teacher to give the children hens and let them chop the heads off.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-59">9-59</A><a name="Nanchor_9-59"></A> Some pagan sacrifice no doubt lies at the root of 
this barbarous practice, which has many parallels in the folk-lore of western 
and southern Europe.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-60">9-60</A><a name="Nanchor_9-60"></A> </P>
<P>As for schoolboys&#146; larks with their teachers, the custom of &#8220;barring out the 
master&#8221; existed in England, and was practised before Christmas&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-61">9-61</A><a name="Nanchor_9-61"></A> as well as at other times of the year, notably Shrove 
Tuesday. At Bromfield in Cumberland on Shrove Tuesday there was a regular siege, 
the school doors were strongly barricaded within, and the boy-defenders were 
armed with pop-guns. If the master won, heavy tasks were imposed, but if, as 
more often happened, he was defeated in his efforts to regain his authority, he 
had to make terms with the boys as to the hours of work and play.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-62">9-62</A><a name="Nanchor_9-62"></A> </P>
<P>St. Thomas's Eve is in certain regions one of the uncanniest nights in the 
year. In some Bohemian villages the saint is believed to drive about at midnight 
in a chariot of fire. In the churchyard there await him all the dead men whose 
name is Thomas; they help him to alight and accompany him to the churchyard 
cross, which glows red with supernatural radiance. There St. Thomas kneels and 
prays, and then rises to bless his namesakes. This done, he vanishes beneath the 
cross, and each Thomas returns to his grave. The saint here seems to have taken 
over <A NAME="page_225"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 225</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_225"></A>the character of some pagan god, who, like the Teutonic 
Odin or Woden, ruled the souls of the departed. In the houses the people listen 
with awe for the sound of his chariot, and when it is heard make anxious prayer 
to him for protection from all ill. Before retiring to rest the house-father 
goes to the cowhouse with holy water and consecrated salt, asperges it from 
without, and then entering, sprinkles every cow. Salt is also thrown on the head 
of each animal with the words, &#8220;St. Thomas preserve thee from all sickness.&#8221; In 
the B&ouml;hmerwald the cattle are fed on this night with consecrated bayberries, 
bread, and salt, in order to avert disease.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-63">9-63</A><a name="Nanchor_9-63"></A> </P>
<P>In Upper and Lower Austria St. Thomas's Eve is reckoned as one of the 
so-called <I>Rauchn&auml;chte</I> (smoke-nights) when houses and farm-buildings must 
be sanctified with incense and holy water, the other nights being the Eves of 
Christmas, the New Year, and the Epiphany.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-64">9-64</A><a name="Nanchor_9-64"></A> </P>
<P>In Germany St. Thomas's, like St. Andrew's Eve, is a time for forecasting the 
future, and the methods already described are sometimes employed by girls who 
wish to behold their future husbands. A widely diffused custom is that of 
throwing shoes backwards over the shoulders. If the points are found turned 
towards the door the thrower is destined to leave the house during the year; if 
they are turned away from it another year will be spent there. In Westphalia a 
belief prevails that you must eat and drink heartily on this night in order to 
avert scarcity.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-65">9-65</A><a name="Nanchor_9-65"></A> </P>
<P>In Lower Austria it is supposed that sluggards can cure themselves of 
oversleeping by saying a special prayer before they go to bed on St. Thomas's 
Eve, and in Westphalia in the mid-nineteenth century the same association of the 
day with slumber was shown by the schoolchildren's custom of calling the child 
who arrived last at school <I>Domesesel</I> (Thomas ass). In Holland, again, the 
person who lies longest in bed on St. Thomas's Day is greeted with shouts of 
&#8220;lazybones.&#8221; Probably the fact that December&nbsp;21 is the shortest day is 
enough to account for this.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-66">9-66</A><a name="Nanchor_9-66"></A> </P>
<P>In England there was divination by means of &#8220;St. Thomas's onion.&#8221; Girls used 
to peel an onion, wrap it in a handkerchief and put it under their heads at 
night, with a prayer to the satin <A NAME="page_226"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 226</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_226"></A>to show them their true love in a dream.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-67">9-67</A><a name="Nanchor_9-67"></A> The most notable English custom on this day, however, 
was the peregrinations of poor people begging for money or provisions for 
Christmas. Going &#8220;a-gooding,&#8221; or &#8220;a-Thomassin&#146;,&#8221; or &#8220;a-mumping,&#8221; this was 
called. Sometimes in return for the charity bestowed a sprig of holly or 
mistletoe was given.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-68">9-68</A><a name="Nanchor_9-68"></A> Possibly the sprig was originally a sacrament of the 
healthful spirit of growth: it may be compared with the olive- or 
cornel-branches carried about on New Year's Eve by Macedonian boys,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-69">9-69</A><a name="Nanchor_9-69"></A> and also with the St. Martin's rod (see &nbsp;<a href="crt11.htm#Chapter_VII">VII</A>).</P>
<P>One more English custom on December&nbsp;21 must be mentioned&#65279;&#8212;it points to a 
sometime sacrifice&#65279;&#8212;the bull-baiting practised until 1821 at Wokingham in 
Berkshire. Its abolition in 1822 caused great resentment among the populace, 
although the flesh continued to be duly distributed.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_9-70">9-70</A><a name="Nanchor_9-70"></A> </P>
<P class=thoughtbreak>We are now four days from the feast of the Nativity, and 
many things commonly regarded as distinctive of Christmas have already come 
under notice. We have met, for instance, with several kinds of present-giving, 
with auguries for the New Year, with processions of carol-singers and 
well-wishers, with ceremonial feasting that anticipates the Christmas eating and 
drinking, and with various figures, saintly or monstrous, mimed or merely 
imagined, which we shall find reappearing at the greatest of winter festivals. 
These things would seem to have been attracted from earlier dates to the feast 
of the Nativity, and the probability that Christmas has borrowed much from an 
old November festival gradually shifted into December, is our justification for 
having dwelt so long upon the feasts that precede the Twelve Days.</P>
