### <span class="smcap">Feasting Customs.</span>

In the mind of the average sensual Englishman perhaps the most vivid
images called up by the word Christmas are those connected with eating
and drinking. “Ha più da fare che i forni di Natale in
Inghilterra,”﻿ [108](crt24.htm#Footnote_108.md)<span
id="FNanchor_108"></span> an Italian proverb used of a very busy person,
sufficiently suggests the character of our
Christmas.﻿ [109](crt24.htm#Footnote_109.md)<span id="FNanchor_109"></span>
It may be that the Christmas dinner looms larger among the English than
among most other peoples, but in every country a distinctive meal of
some kind is associated with the season. We have already seen how this
illustrates the immemorial connection between material feasting and
religious rejoicing.

Let us note some forms of “Christmas fare” and try to get an idea of
their origin. First we may look at English feasting customs, though, as
they have been pretty fully described by <span id="page_284">p.
284</span> <span id="Page_284"></span>previous writers, no very
elaborate account of them need be given.

The gross eating and drinking in former days at Christmas, of which our
present mild gluttony is but a pale reflection, would seem to be
connected with the old November feast, though transferred to the season
hallowed by Christ's birth. The show of slaughtered beasts, adorned with
green garlands, in an English town just before Christmas, reminds one
strongly of the old November killing. In displays of this kind the pig's
head is specially conspicuous, and points to the time when the swine was
a favourite sacrificial animal.﻿ [13-1](crt22.htm#Note_13-1.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-1"></span> We may recall here the traditional carol sung
at Queen's College, Oxford, as the boar's head is solemnly brought in at
Christmas, and found elsewhere in other forms:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“The boar's head in hand bear I,</span>  
<span class="i2">Bedeck'd with bays and rosemary;</span>  
<span class="i2">And I pray you, my masters, be merry,</span>  
<span class="i3">*Quot estis in convivio.*</span>  
<span class="i3">*Caput apri defero,*</span>  
<span class="i3">*Reddens laudes
Domino.* ”﻿ [13-2](crt22.htm#Note_13-2.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-2"></span>
</span>  

</div>

</div>

The Christmas bird provided by the familiar “goose club” may be compared
with the German Martinmas goose. The more luxurious turkey must be
relatively an innovation, for that bird seems not to have been
introduced into England until the sixteenth
century.﻿ [13-3](crt22.htm#Note_13-3.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-3"></span>

Cakes and pies, partly or wholly of vegetable origin, are, of course, as
conspicuous at the English Christmas as animal food. The peculiar
“luckiness” attached to some of them (as when mince-pies, eaten in
different houses during the Twelve Days, bring a happy month each) makes
one suspect some more serious original purpose than mere gratification
of the appetite. A sacrificial or sacramental origin is probable, at
least in certain cases; a cake made of flour, for instance, may well
have been regarded as embodying the spirit immanent in the
corn.﻿ [13-4](crt22.htm#Note_13-4.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-4"></span>
Whether any mystic significance ever belonged to the plum-pudding it is
hard to say, though the sprig of holly stuck into its <span
id="page_285">p. 285</span> <span id="Page_285"></span>top recalls the
lucky green boughs we have so often come across, and a resemblance to
the libations upon the Christmas log might be seen in the burning
brandy.

A dish once prominent at Christmas was “frumenty” or “furmety”
(variously spelt, and derived from the Latin *frumentum*, corn). It was
made of hulled wheat boiled in milk and seasoned with cinnamon, sugar,
&c.﻿ [13-5](crt22.htm#Note_13-5.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-5"></span> This too
may have been a cereal sacrament. In Yorkshire it was the first thing
eaten on Christmas morning, just as ale posset was the last thing drunk
on Christmas Eve. Ale posset was a mixture of beer and milk, and each
member of the family in turn had to take a “sup,” as also a piece of a
large apple-pie.﻿ [13-6](crt22.htm#Note_13-6.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-6"></span>

In the Highlands of Scotland, among those who observed Christmas, a
characteristic dish was new sowens (the husks and siftings of oatmeal),
given to the family early on Christmas Day in their beds. They were
boiled into the consistence of molasses and were poured into as many
bickers as there were people to partake of them. Everyone on despatching
his bicker jumped out of bed.﻿ [13-7](crt22.htm#Note_13-7.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-7"></span> Here, as in the case of the Yorkshire
frumenty, the eating has a distinctly ceremonial character.

In the East Riding of Yorkshire a special Yule cake was eaten on
Christmas Eve, “made of flour, barm, large cooking raisins, currants,
lemon-peel, and nutmeg,” and about as large as a
dinner-plate.﻿ [13-8](crt22.htm#Note_13-8.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-8"></span> In Shropshire “wigs” or caraway buns dipped in
ale were eaten on Christmas Eve.﻿ [13-9](crt22.htm#Note_13-9.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-9"></span> Again elsewhere there were Yule Doughs or
Dows, little images of paste, presented by bakers to their
customers.﻿ [13-10](crt22.htm#Note_13-10.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-10"></span> We shall see plenty of parallels to these on
the Continent. When they are in animal or even human form they may in
some cases have taken the place of actual sacrificial
victims.﻿ [13-11](crt22.htm#Note_13-11.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-11"></span>

In Nottinghamshire the Christmas cake was associated with the
wassail-bowl in a manner which may be compared with the Macedonian
custom described later; it was broken up and put into the bowl, hot ale
was poured over it, and so it was
eaten.﻿ [13-12](crt22.htm#Note_13-12.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-12"></span>

The wassail-bowl﻿—one cannot leave the subject of English Yuletide
feasting without a few words upon this beloved beaker of hot spiced ale
and toasted apples (“lambswool”). *Wassail* is <span id="page_286">p.
286</span> <span id="Page_286"></span>derived from the Anglo-Saxon *wes
hál* = be whole, and wassailing is in its essence the wishing of a
person's very good health. The origin of drinking healths is not
obvious; perhaps it may be sacramental: the draught may have been at
first a means of communion with some divinity, and then its consumption
may have come to be regarded not only as benefiting the partaker, but as
a rite that could be performed for the welfare of another person. Apart
from such speculations, we may note the frequent mention of wassailing
in old English carols of the less ecclesiastical type; the singers
carried with them a bowl or cup which they expected their wealthier
neighbours to fill with drink.﻿ [13-13](crt22.htm#Note_13-13.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-13"></span> Sometimes the bowl was adorned with ribbons
and had a golden apple at the top,﻿ [13-14](crt22.htm#Note_13-14.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-14"></span> and it is a noteworthy fact that the box with
the Christmas images, mentioned in Chapter IV. (p.
 [118](crt07.htm#Page_118).md), is sometimes called “the Vessel \[Wassail\]
Cup.”﻿ [13-15](crt22.htm#Note_13-15.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-15"></span>

The various Christmas dishes of Europe would form an interesting subject
for exhaustive study. To suggest a religious origin for each would be
going too far, for merely economic considerations must have had much to
do with the matter, but it is very probable that in some cases they are
relics of sacrifices or sacraments.

The pig is a favourite food animal at Christmas in other countries than
our own, a fact probably connected with sacrificial customs. In Denmark
and Sweden a pig's head was one of the principal articles of the great
Christmas Eve repast.﻿ [13-16](crt22.htm#Note_13-16.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-16"></span> In Germany it is a fairly widespread custom
to kill a pig shortly before Christmas and partake of it on Christmas
Day; its entrails and bones and the straw which has been in contact with
it are supposed to have fertilizing
powers.﻿ [13-17](crt22.htm#Note_13-17.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-17"></span>
In Roumania a pig is the Christmas animal *par
excellence*,﻿ [13-18](crt22.htm#Note_13-18.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-18"></span> in Russia pigs’ trotters are a favourite dish
at the New Year,﻿ [13-19](crt22.htm#Note_13-19.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-19"></span> and in every Servian house roast pig is the
principal Christmas dish.﻿ [13-20](crt22.htm#Note_13-20.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-20"></span>

In Upper Bavaria there is a custom which almost certainly has at its
root a sacrifice: a number of poor people club together at
Christmas-time and buy a cow to be killed and eaten at a common
feast.﻿ [13-21](crt22.htm#Note_13-21.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-21"></span>

More doubtful is the sacrificial origin of the dishes of certain <span
id="page_287">p. 287</span> <span id="Page_287"></span>special kinds of
fish on Christmas Eve. In Saxony and Thuringia herring salad is
eaten﻿—he who bakes it will have money all the year﻿—and in many parts
of Germany and also in Styria carp is then
consumed.﻿ [13-22](crt22.htm#Note_13-22.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-22"></span>
Round Ercé in Brittany the family dish is
cod.﻿ [13-23](crt22.htm#Note_13-23.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-23"></span> In
Italy the *cenone* or great supper held on Christmas Eve has fish for
its animal basis, and stewed eels are particularly popular. It is to be
remembered that in Catholic countries the Vigil of the Nativity is a
fast, and meat is not allowed upon it; this alone would account for the
prominence of fish on Christmas Eve.

We have already come across peculiar cakes eaten at various
pre-Christmas festivals; at Christmas itself special kinds of bread,
pastry, and cakes abound on the Continent, and in some cases at least
may have a religious origin.

In France various sorts of cakes and loaves are known at the season of
*Noël*. In Berry on Christmas morning loaves called *cornabœux*, made in
the shape of horns or a crescent, are distributed to the poor. In
Lorraine people give one another *cognés* or *cogneux*, a kind of pastry
in the shape of two crescents back to back, or else long and narrow in
form and with a crescent at either end. In some parts of France the
*cornabœux* are known as *hôlais*, and ploughmen give to the poor as
many of these loaves as they possess oxen and
horses.﻿ [13-24](crt22.htm#Note_13-24.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-24"></span>
These horns may be substitutes for a sacrifice of oxen.

Sometimes the French Christmas cakes have the form of complete oxen or
horses﻿—such were the thin unleavened cakes sold in the early nineteenth
century at La Châtre (Indre). In the neighbourhood of Chartres there are
*cochenilles* and *coquelins* in animal and human shapes. Little cakes
called *naulets* are sold by French bakers, and actually represent the
Holy Child. With them may be compared the *coignoles* of French
Flanders, cakes of oblong form adorned with the figure of the infant
Jesus in sugar.﻿ [13-25](crt22.htm#Note_13-25.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-25"></span> Sometimes the Christmas loaf or cake in
France has healing properties; a certain kind of cake in Berry and
Limousin is kept all through the year, and a piece eaten in sickness has
marvellous powers.﻿ [13-26](crt22.htm#Note_13-26.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-26"></span>

Cortet gives an extraordinary account of a French custom <span
id="page_288">p. 288</span> <span id="Page_288"></span>connected with
eating and drinking. At Mouthe (Doubs) there used to be brought to the
church at Christmas pies, cakes, and other eatables, and wine of the
best. They were called the “De fructu,” and when at Vespers the verse
“De fructu ventris tui ponam super sedem tuam” was reached, all the
congregation made a rush for these refreshments, contended for them, and
carried them off with singing and
shouting.﻿ [13-27](crt22.htm#Note_13-27.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-27"></span>

The most remarkable of Christmas cakes or loaves is the Swedish and
Danish “Yule Boar,” a loaf in the form of a boar-pig, which stands on
the table throughout the festal season. It is often made from the corn
of the last sheaf of the harvest, and in it Dr. Frazer finds a clear
expression of the idea of the corn-spirit as embodied in pig form.
“Often it is kept till sowing-time in spring, when part of it is mixed
with the seed corn and part given to the ploughman and plough-horses or
plough-oxen to eat, in the expectation of a good harvest.” In some parts
of the Esthonian island of Oesel the cake has not the form of a boar,
but bears the same name, and on New Year's Day is given to the cattle.
In other parts of the island the “Yule Boar” is actually a little pig,
roasted on Christmas Eve and set up on the
table.﻿ [13-28](crt22.htm#Note_13-28.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-28"></span>

In Germany, besides *stollen*﻿—a sort of plum-loaf﻿—biscuits, often of
animal or human shape, are very conspicuous on Christmas Eve. Any one
who has witnessed a German Christmas will remember the extraordinary
variety of them, *lebkuchen*, *pfeffernüsse*, *printen*, *spekulatius*
biscuits, &c. In Berlin a great pile of biscuits heaped up on your plate
is an important part of the Christmas Eve supper. These of course are
nowadays mere luxuries, but they may well have had some sort of
sacrificial origin. An admirable and exhaustive study of Teutonic
Christmas cakes and biscuits has been made, with infinite pains, by an
Austrian professor, Dr. Höfler, who reproduces some curious old
biscuits, stamped with highly artistic patterns, preserved in
museums.﻿ [13-29](crt22.htm#Note_13-29.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-29"></span>

Among unsophisticated German peasants there is a belief in magical
powers possessed by bread baked at Christmas, particularly when
moistened by Christmas dew. (This dew is held to be peculiarly sacred,
perhaps on account of the words “Rorate, coeli, <span id="page_289">p.
289</span> <span id="Page_289"></span>desuper” used at the Advent
Masses.) In Franconia such bread, thrown into a dangerous fire, stills
the flames; in the north of Germany, if put during the Twelve Days into
the fodder of the cattle, it makes them prolific and healthy throughout
the year.﻿ [13-30](crt22.htm#Note_13-30.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-30"></span>

It is pleasant to note that animals are often specially cared for at
Christmas. Up till the early nineteenth century the cattle in Shropshire
were always better fed at Christmas than at other times, and Miss Burne
tells of an old gentleman in Cheshire who used then to give his poultry
a double portion of grain, for, he said, “all creation should rejoice at
Christmas, and the dumb creatures had no other manner of doing
so.”﻿ [13-31](crt22.htm#Note_13-31.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-31"></span> The
saying reminds one of that lover of Christmas and the animals, St.
Francis of Assisi. It will be remembered how he wished that oxen and
asses should have extra corn and hay at Christmas, “for reverence of the
Son of God, whom on such a night the most Blessed Virgin Mary did lay
down in the stall betwixt the ox and the
ass.”﻿ [13-32](crt22.htm#Note_13-32.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-32"></span> It
was a gracious thought, and no doubt with St. Francis, as with the old
Cheshireman, it was a purely Christian one; very possibly, however, the
original object of such attention to the dumb creatures was to bring to
the animals, by means of the corn, the influence of the spirit of
fertility.

In Silesia on Christmas night all the beasts are given wheat to make
them thrive, and it is believed that if wheat be kept in the pocket
during the Christmas service and then given to fowls, it will make them
grow fat and lay many eggs.﻿ [13-33](crt22.htm#Note_13-33.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-33"></span> In Sweden on Christmas Eve the cattle are
given the best forage the house can afford, and afterwards a mess of all
the viands of which their masters have partaken; the horses are given
the choicest hay and, later on, ale; and the other animals are treated
to good things.﻿ [13-34](crt22.htm#Note_13-34.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-34"></span>

At Loblang in Hungary the last sheaf at harvest is kept, and given on
New Year's morning to the wild
birds.﻿ [13-35](crt22.htm#Note_13-35.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-35"></span> In
southern Germany corn is put on the roof for them on Christmas Eve,
or,﻿ [13-36](crt22.htm#Note_13-36.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-36"></span> as
also in Sweden,﻿ [13-37](crt22.htm#Note_13-37.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-37"></span> an unthreshed sheaf is set on a pole. In
these cases it is possible that the food was originally an offering to
ancestral or other spirits.

*Revenons à nos gâteaux.* In Rome and elsewhere in Italy an important
article of Christmas food is the *panettone*, a currant loaf. <span
id="page_290">p. 290</span> <span id="Page_290"></span>Such loaves are
sent as presents to friends. In eastern Europe, too, Christmas loaves or
cakes are very conspicuous. The *chesnitza* and *kolatch* cakes among
the southern Slavs are flat and wheel-like, with a circular hole in the
middle and a number of lines radiating from it. In the central hole is
sometimes placed a lighted taper or a small Christmas-tree hung with
ribbons, tinsel, and sweetmeats. These cakes, made with elaborate
ceremonial early in the morning, are solemnly broken by the house-father
on Christmas Day, and a small piece is eaten by each member of the
family. In some places one is fixed on the horn of the “eldest ox,” and
if he throws it off it is a good
sign.﻿ [13-38](crt22.htm#Note_13-38.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-38"></span> The
last practice may be compared with a Herefordshire custom which we shall
meet with on Twelfth Night (p.  [346](crt20.htm#Page_346).md).

In southern Greece a special kind of flat loaves with a cross on the top
is made on Christmas Eve. The name given is “Christ's Loaves.” “The
cloth is not removed from the table; but everything is left as it is in
the belief that ‘Christ will come and eat’ during the
night.”﻿ [13-39](crt22.htm#Note_13-39.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-39"></span>
Probably Christ has here taken the place of ancestral spirits.

In Tyrol peasants eat at Christmastide the so-called *zelten*, a kind of
pie filled with dried pear-slices, nuts, figs, raisins, and the like. It
is baked on the Eve of St. Thomas, and its filling is as important an
event for the whole family as was the plum-pudding and mincemeat making
in old-fashioned English households. When the *zelten* is filled the
sign of the cross is made upon it and it is sprinkled with holy water
and put in the oven. When baked and cooled, it is laid in the family
stock of rye and is not eaten until St. Stephen's Day or Epiphany. Its
cutting by the father of the family is a matter of considerable
solemnity. Smaller pies are made at the same time for the maid-servants,
and a curious custom is connected with them. It is usual for the maids
to visit their relations during the Christmas holidays and share with
them their *zelten*. A young man who wishes to be engaged to a maid
should offer to carry her pie for her. This is his declaration of love,
and if she accepts the offer she signifies her approval of him. To him
falls the duty or privilege of cutting the
*zelten*.﻿ [13-40](crt22.htm#Note_13-40.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-40"></span>

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span> <span id="Page_291"></span>Other cake
customs are associated with the Epiphany, and will be considered in
connection with that festival. We may here in conclusion notice a few
further articles of Christmas good cheer.

In Italy and Spain﻿ [13-41](crt22.htm#Note_13-41.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-41"></span> a sort of nougat known as *torrone* or
*turron* is eaten at Christmas. You may buy it even in London in the
Italian quarter; in Eyre Street Hill it is sold on Christmas Eve on
little gaily-decked street stalls. Its use may well be a survival of the
Roman custom of giving sweet things at the Kalends in order that the
year might be full of sweetness.

Some Little Russian feasting customs are probably pagan in origin, but
have received a curious Christian interpretation. All Little Russians
sit down to honey and porridge on Christmas Eve. They call it *koutia*,
and cherish the custom as something that distinguishes them from Great
and White Russians. Each dish is said to represent the Holy Crib. First
porridge is put in, which is like putting straw in the manger; then each
person helps himself to honey and fruit, and that symbolizes the Babe. A
place is made in the porridge, and then the honey and fruit are poured
in; the fruit stands for the body, the honey for the spirit or the
blood.﻿ [13-42](crt22.htm#Note_13-42.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-42"></span>

Something like this is the special dish eaten in every Roumanian peasant
household on Christmas Eve﻿—the *turte*. It is made up of a pile of thin
dry leaves of dough, with melted sugar or honey, or powdered walnut, or
the juice of the hemp-seed. The *turte* are traditionally said to
represent the swaddling clothes of the Holy
Child.﻿ [13-43](crt22.htm#Note_13-43.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-43"></span>

In Poland a few weeks before Christmas monks bring round small packages
of wafers made of flour and water, blessed by a priest, and with figures
stamped upon them. No Polish family is without these *oplatki*; they are
sent in letters to relations and friends, as we send Christmas cards.
When the first star appears on Christmas Eve the whole family, beginning
with the eldest member, break one of these wafers between themselves, at
the same time exchanging good wishes. Afterwards the master and mistress
go to the servants’ quarters to divide the wafer
there.﻿ [13-44](crt22.htm#Note_13-44.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-44"></span>

### <span id="page_292">p. 292</span> <span id="Page_292"></span><span class="smcap">Relics of Sacrifice.</span>

We have noted a connection, partial at least, between Christmas good
cheer and sacrifice; let us now glance at a few customs of a different
character but seemingly of sacrificial origin.

Traces of sacrifices of cats and dogs are to be found in Germany and
Bohemia. In Lauenburg and Mecklenburg on Christmas morning, before the
cattle are watered, a dog is thrown into their drinking water, in order
that they may not suffer from the mange. In the Uckermark a cat may be
substituted for the dog. In Bohemia a black cat is caught, boiled, and
buried by night under a tree, to keep evil spirits from injuring the
fields.﻿ [13-45](crt22.htm#Note_13-45.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-45"></span>

A strange Christmas custom is the “hunting of the wren,” once widespread
in England and France and still practised in Ireland. In the Isle of Man
very early on Christmas morning, when the church bells had rung out
midnight, servants went out to hunt the wren. They killed the bird,
fastened it to the top of a long pole, and carried it in procession to
every house, chanting these words:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i15">“We hunted the wren for Robin the Bobbin,</span>  
<span class="i3">We hunted the wren for Jack of the Can,</span>  
<span class="i2">We hunted the wren for Robin the Bobbin,</span>  
<span class="i3">We hunted the wren for every one.”</span>  

</div>

</div>

At each house they sought to collect money. At last, when all had been
visited, they laid the wren on a bier, carried it to the churchyard, and
buried it with the utmost solemnity, singing Manx dirges. Another
account, from the mid-nineteenth century, describes how on St. Stephen's
Day Manx boys went from door to door with a wren suspended by the legs
in the centre of two hoops crossing one another at right angles and
decorated with evergreens and ribbons. In exchange for a small coin they
would give a feather of the wren, which was carefully kept as a
preservative against shipwreck during the
year.﻿ [110](crt24.htm#Footnote_110.md)<span
id="FNanchor_110"></span>﻿ [13-46](crt22.htm#Note_13-46.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-46"></span> <span id="page_293">p. 293</span> <span
id="Page_293"></span>There are also traces of a Manx custom of boiling
and eating the bird.﻿ [13-48](crt22.htm#Note_13-48.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-48"></span>

The wren is popularly called “the king of birds,” and it is supposed to
be highly unlucky to kill one at ordinary times. Probably it was once
regarded as sacred, and the Christmas “hunting” is the survival of an
annual custom of slaying the divine animal, such as is found among
primitive peoples.﻿ [13-49](crt22.htm#Note_13-49.md)<span
id="Nanchor_13-49"></span> The carrying of its body from door to door is
apparently intended to convey to each house a portion of its virtues,
while the actual eating of the bird would be a sort of communion feast.
Perhaps the custom, in a Cornish village, of eating blackbird pie on
Twelfth Day should be explained in the same
way.﻿ [13-50](crt22.htm#Note_13-50.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-50"></span>

I can here hardly do more than allude to the many
games﻿ [13-51](crt22.htm#Note_13-51.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-51"></span>
that were traditional in England at Christmas﻿—hoodman-blind, shoe the
wild mare, hot cockles, steal the white loaf, snap-dragon, and the rest.
To attempt to describe and explain them would lead me too far, but it is
highly probable that some at least might be traced to an origin in
sacrificial ritual. The degeneration of religious rites into mere play
is, indeed, as we have seen, a process illustrated by the whole history
of Christmas.

Only two British Christmas games can be discussed in this book:
blindman's buff and football. An account of a remarkable Christmas
football match will be found in the chapter on Epiphany customs, where
it is brought into connection with that closely related game, the “Haxey
hood.”

As for blindman's buff, it is distinctly a Christmas sport, and it is
known nearly all over Europe by names derived from animals, *e.g.*,
“blind cow” and “blind mouse.” Mr. N. W. Thomas has suggested that “the
explanation of these names is that the players originally wore masks;
the game is known in some cases as the ‘blinde Mumm,’ or blind mask....
The player who is ‘it’ seems to be the sacrificer; he bears the same
name as the victim, just as in agricultural customs the reaper of the
last corn bears the same name as the last
sheaf.”﻿ [13-52](crt22.htm#Note_13-52.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-52"></span>

The Scandinavian countries are very rich in Christmas games and
dances,﻿ [13-53](crt22.htm#Note_13-53.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-53"></span>
of which it would be interesting to attempt explanations if space
allowed. One Swedish song and dance game﻿—it <span id="page_294">p.

(see  [XIII](crt17.htm#Chapter_XIII).md)﻿—is obviously sacrificial. Several
youths, with blackened faces and persons disguised, are the performers.
One of them is put to death with a knife by a woman in hideous attire.
Afterwards, with gross gestures, she dances with the
victim.﻿ [13-54](crt22.htm#Note_13-54.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-54"></span>
According to another account, from Gothland, the victim sits clad in a
skin, holding in his mouth a wisp of straw cut sharp at the ends and
standing out. It has been conjectured that this is meant to resemble a
swine's bristles, and that the man represents a hog sacrificed to
Frey.﻿ [13-55](crt22.htm#Note_13-55.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-55"></span>

Lastly a Russian game may be mentioned, though it has no sacrificial
suggestion. During the Christmas season girls play at what is called
“the Burial of the Gold.” They form a circle, with one girl standing in
the centre, and pass from hand to hand a gold ring, which the maiden
inside tries to detect. Meanwhile a song is sung, “Gold I bury, gold I
bury.” Some imaginative mythologists interpret the ring as representing
the sun, buried by the clouds of
winter.﻿ [13-56](crt22.htm#Note_13-56.md)<span id="Nanchor_13-56"></span>
