<p>The 'age' is the distance in degrees (from 0 to 360) that the moon has traversed in its orbit since it was new. The phase is percentage of the moons' face which is currently lit, (i.e., it is 100% at full and 0% at new). If the phase is currently increasing the moon is said to be waxing and if it is decreasing it is said to be waning.</p>
<p>The first symbolic system is believed to be a bone from the Paleolithic with 28 scratches on it indicating a knowledge of the lunar cycle. The moon is also the basis of many of the calendars of the world, and is key to Jewish, Islamic, and Christian liturgical calendars; the exact dates of Rosh Hashana, Ramadan and Easter all depend on lunar events which vary from year to year. In some cases, such as the <a href="isldate">Islamic calendar</a>, a particular phase of the moon must actually be observed at a given location.</p></td>
