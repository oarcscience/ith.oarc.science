# Planetary Positions

This page gives the geocentric (earth-centered) positions of the Sun,
Moon and the planets. A list of astrological conjunctions is attached.
The right ascension is correct to within a couple of minutes. Some of
the declinations have reversed signs; this is a known bug (however these
are not used in conventional astrology). The position of Pluto will be
off by a bit more than the other planets, but accurate to within a
degree or two. The algorithm does not take into account interplanetary
gravitational interactions; it uses the current orbital characteristics
of each planet and interpolates from a known set of values. Hence, the
further back or forward in time you set the date to, the less accurate
the positions will be; they will be more accurate the closer they are to
1 January 1980. This algorithm does not take into account the precession
of the equinox.

This page defaults to the current local time, but you can also set other
values for the date and time using the [form at the bottom of this
page](#a_datetimeform.md). The entered time must be Greenwich Mean Time.
Note that you can set a value B.C.E. by using negative numbers in the
year field. Dates prior to 15 October 1582 are considered be Julian,
after that, Gregorian. Since not all countries (e.g. Russia) changed
their calendar on exactly that date, you may need to adjust historical
dates accordingly.

The 'sign' reported assumes that Aries coincides with the vernal equinox
and that each of the zodiacal signs occupy exactly one-twelfth of the
sky. The 'events' are triggered if the two planets are within 15 degrees
of the exact angle. These assumptions will not correspond exactly to
some astrological systems, and the planets may or may not be in these
exact constellations (in the strict astronomical sense).
