The Jewish year count dates from a traditional date for the creation of
the world.

The Jewish calendar is based both on solar and lunar cycles, with the
lunar influence predominating. Each month in the Jewish calendar is 29
or 30 days long, which approximates the lunar month. Twelve of these
lunar months total 354 days, about 11 days short of the solar year. This
leads to a substantial drift from year to year of specific dates
relative to the solar year (although all holidays occur on a fixed
Jewish calendar date). To correct for this, an additional month (Adar
II) is added during leap years which occur roughly every third year. In
addition, other changes are made every 19th year.

After correction, the length of the solar year as defined by the Jewish
calendar is short by about four minutes a year, which means it is about
four and a half days off per millenia.

The Jewish calendar originally depended on the actual time of
observation of the new moon, much like the current Islamic calendar. All
decisions about the calendar were made by a committee of the Sanhedrin
(the Supreme Court in Jerusalem), the *Sod Haibbur*. This committee
calculated the dates of the beginnings of the months and the seasons
based on astronomical observations and calculations, as well as
meterological and agricultural considerations. They determined when the
intercalations would occur, that is inserting periods of time into the
calendar to meet religious requirements and to keep it in
synchronization with the solar year.

After the destruction of the second Temple in 70 C.E., the maintenance
of the calendar gradually passed to local synagogues. The
decision-making process was decentralized, which led to the possibility
of holidays being celebrated at different times in different localities.
This led to the practice of extending some of the holidays to ensure
that all Jews could celebrate them at the same time, for instance,
adding an eighth day to Passover.

For this reason, in the fourth century C.E., the Patriarch Hillel II
decided to codify the rules for computing the calendar, which fixed the
method of computing the calendar to the current algorithm.

The only day of the week with a name is the seventh day, the Sabbath.
The rest are numbered rather than named.

The day is divided into 24 hours of equal duration. Each hour is divided
into 1,080 *helek* (plural, *halakim*). Each helek is divided into 76
*rega* (plural, *regaim*).

The day begins and ends at sunset for religious purposes. By this
reckoning, midnight is hour 6 and noon is hour 18. For calendrical
purposes the day begins at 6 p.m. Jerusalem time.
