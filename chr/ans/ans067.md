### <span id="v.XXXIV-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER XXXIV.

<span id="v.XXXIV-p2"></span>

<span id="v.XXXIV-p3"></span>How he can express the created world by his
Word.

<span id="v.XXXIV-p4"></span>

<span id="v.XXXIV-p5"></span>BUT how can objects so different as the
creative and the created being be expressed by one Word, especially
since that Word itself is coeternal with him who expresses them, while
the created world is not coeternal with him? Perhaps, because he himself
is supreme Wisdom and supreme Reason, in which are all things that have
been created; just as a work which is made after one of the arts, not
only when it is made, but before it is made, and after it is destroyed,
is always in respect of the art itself nothing else than what that art
is.

<span id="v.XXXIV-p6"></span>Hence, when the supreme Spirit expresses
himself, he expresses all created beings. For, both before they were
created, and now that they have been created, and after they are decayed
or changed in any way, they are ever in him not what they are in
themselves, but what this Spirit himself is. For, in themselves they are
mutable beings, created according to immutable reason; while in him is
the true first being, and the first reality of existence, the more like
unto which those beings are in any way, the more really and excellently
do they exist. Thus, it may reasonably be declared that, when the
supreme Spirit expresses <span id="page_97">p. 97</span> <span
id="v.XXXIV-Page_97"></span>himself, he also expresses whatever has been
created by one and the same Word.
