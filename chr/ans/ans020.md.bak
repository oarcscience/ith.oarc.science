### <span id="iv.XIV-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER XIV.

<span id="iv.XIV-p1"></span>

<span id="iv.XIV-p2"></span>How and why God is seen and yet not seen by
those who seek him.

<span id="iv.XIV-p3"></span>

<span id="iv.XIV-p4"></span>HAST thou found what thou didst seek, my
soul? Thou didst seek God. Thou hast found him to be a being which is
the highest of all beings, a being than which nothing better can be
conceived; that this being is life itself, light, wisdom, goodness,
eternal blessedness and blessed eternity; and that it is every where and
always.

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span> <span id="iv.XIV-Page_20"></span>

<span id="iv.XIV-p5"></span>For, if thou hast not found thy God, how is
he this being which thou hast found, and which thou hast conceived him
to be, with so certain truth and so true certainty? But, if thou hast
found him, why is it that thou dost not feel thou hast found him? Why, O
Lord, our God, does not my soul feel thee, if it hath found thee? Or,
has it not found him whom it found to be light and truth? For how did it
understand this, except by seeing light and truth? Or, could it
understand anything at all of thee, except through thy light and thy
truth?

<span id="iv.XIV-p6"></span>Hence, if it has seen light and truth, it
has seen thee; if it has not seen thee, it has not seen light and truth.
Or, is what it has seen both light and truth; and still it has not yet
seen thee, because it has seen thee only in part, but has not seen thee
as thou art? Lord my God, my creator and renewer, speak to the desire of
my soul, what thou art other than it hath seen, that it may clearly see
what it desires. It strains to see thee more; and sees nothing beyond
this which it hath seen, except darkness. Nay, it does not see darkness,
of which‑there is none in thee; but it sees that it cannot see farther,
because of its own darkness.

<span id="iv.XIV-p7"></span>Why is this, Lord, why is this? Is the eye
of the soul darkened by its infirmity, or dazzled by thy glory? Surely
it is both darkened in itself, and dazzled by thee. Doubtless it is both
obscured by its own insignificance, and overwhelmed by thy infinity.
Truly, it is both contracted by its own narrowness and overcome by thy
greatness.

<span id="iv.XIV-p8"></span>For how great is that light from which
shines every truth that gives light to the rational mind? How great is
that truth in which is everything that is <span id="page_21">p.
21</span> <span id="iv.XIV-Page_21"></span>true, and outside which is
only nothingness and the false? How boundless is the truth which sees at
one glance whatsoever has been made, and by whom, and through whom, and
how it has been made from nothing? What purity, what certainty, what
splendor where it is? Assuredly more than a creature can conceive.
