### <span id="v.XVIII-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER XVIII.

<span id="v.XVIII-p1"></span>

<span id="v.XVIII-p2"></span>It is without beginning and without end.

<span id="v.XVIII-p3"></span>

<span id="v.XVIII-p4"></span>FROM what time, then, as this so simple
Nature which creates and animates all things existed, or until what time
is it to exist? Or rather, let us ask neither from what time, nor to
what time, it exists; but is it without beginning and without end? For,
if it has a beginning, it has this either from or through itself, or
from or through another, or from or through nothing.

<span id="v.XVIII-p5"></span>But it is certain, according to truths
already made plain, that in no wise does it derive existence from
another, or from nothing; or exist through another, or through nothing.
In no wise, therefore, has it had inception through or from another, or
through or from nothing.

<span id="v.XVIII-p6"></span>Moreover, it cannot have inception from or
through itself, although it exists from and through itself. For it so
exists from and through itself, that by no means is there one essence
which exists from and through itself, and another through which, and
from which, it exists. But, whatever begins to exist from or through
something, is by no means identical with that from or through which it
begins to exist. Therefore, the supreme Nature does not begin through or
from, itself.

<span id="v.XVIII-p7"></span>Seeing, then, that it has a beginning
neither through nor from itself, and neither through nor from nothing,
it assuredly has no beginning at all. But neither will it have an end.
For, if it is to have end, it is not supremely immortal and supremely
incorruptible<span id="page_68">p. 68</span> <span
id="v.XVIII-Page_68"></span>. But we have proved that it is supremely
immortal and supremely incorruptible. Therefore, it will not have an
end.

<span id="v.XVIII-p8"></span>Furthermore, if it is to have an end, it
will perish either willingly or against its will. But certainly that is
not a simple, unmixed good, at whose will the supreme good perishes. But
this Being is itself the true and simple, unmixed good. Therefore, that
very Being, which is certainly the supreme good, will not die of its own
will. If, however, it is to perish against its will, it is not supremely
powerful, or all‑powerful. But cogent reasoning has asserted it to be
powerful and all‑powerful. Therefore, it will not die against its will.
Hence, if neither with nor against its will the supreme Nature is to
have an end, in no way will it have an end.

<span id="v.XVIII-p9"></span>Again, if the supreme nature has an end or
a beginning, it is not true eternity, which it has been irrefutably
proved to be above.

<span id="v.XVIII-p10"></span>Then, let him who can conceive of a time
when this began to be true, or when it was not true, namely, that
something was destined to be; or when this shall cease to be true, and
shall not be true, namely, that something has existed. But, if neither
of these suppositions is conceivable, and both these facts cannot exist
without truth, it is impossible even to conceive that truth has either
beginning or end. And then, if truth had a beginning, or shall have an
end; before it began it was true that truth did not exist, and after it
shall be ended it will be true that truth will not exist. Yet, anything
that is *true* cannot exist without truth. Therefore, truth existed
before truth existed, and truth will exist after truth shall be ended,
which is a most contradictory conclusion. Whether, then, <span
id="page_69">p. 69</span> <span id="v.XVIII-Page_69"></span>truth is
said to have, or understood not to have, beginning or end, it cannot be
limited by any beginning or end. Hence, the same follows as regards the
supreme Nature, since it is itself the supreme Truth.
