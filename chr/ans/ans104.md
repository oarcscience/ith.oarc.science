### <span id="v.LXXI-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LXXI.

<span id="v.LXXI-p2"></span>

<span id="v.LXXI-p3"></span>The soul that despises this being will be
eternally miserable.

<span id="v.LXXI-p4"></span>

<span id="v.LXXI-p5"></span>FROM this it may be inferred, as a certain
consequence, that the soul which despises the love of the supreme good
will incur eternal misery. It might be said that it would be justly
punished for such contempt if it *lost* existence or life, since it does
not employ itself to the end for which it was created. But reason in no
wise admits such a belief, namely, that after such great guilt it is
condemned to be what it was before all its guilt.

<span id="v.LXXI-p6"></span>For, before it existed, it could neither be
guilty nor feel a penalty. If, then, the soul despising that end for
which it was created, dies so as to feel nothing, or so as to be nothing
at all, its condition will be the same when in the greatest guilt and
when without all guilt; and the supremely wise Justice will not
distinguish between what is capable of no good and wills no evil, and
what is capable of the greatest good and wills the greatest evil.

<span id="v.LXXI-p7"></span>But it is plain enough that this is a
contradiction. Therefore, nothing can be more logical, and nothing ought
to be believed more confidently than that the <span id="page_136">p.
136</span> <span id="v.LXXI-Page_136"></span>soul of man is so
constituted that, if it scorns loving the supreme Being, it suffers
eternal misery; that just as the loving soul shall rejoice in an eternal
reward, so the soul despising that Being shall suffer eternal
punishment; and as the former shall feel an immutable sufficiency, so
the latter shall feel an inconsolable need.
