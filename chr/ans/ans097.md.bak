### <span id="v.LXIV-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LXIV.

<span id="v.LXIV-p2"></span>

<span id="v.LXIV-p3"></span>Though this truth is inexplicable, it
demands belief.

<span id="v.LXIV-p4"></span>

<span id="v.LXIV-p5"></span>IT seems to me that the mystery of so
sublime a subject transcends all the vision of the human intellect<span
id="page_126">p. 126</span> <span id="v.LXIV-Page_126"></span>. And for
that reason I think it best to refrain from the attempt to explain how
this thing is. For it is my opinion that one who is investigating an
incomprehensible object ought to be satisfied if this reasoning shall
have brought him far enough to recognise that this object most certainly
exists; nor ought assured belief to be the less readily given to these
truths which are declared to be such by cogent proofs, and without the
contradiction of any other reason, if, because of the
incomprehensibility of their own natural sublimity, they do not admit of
explanation.

<span id="v.LXIV-p6"></span>But what is so incomprehensible, so
ineffable, as that which is above all things? Hence, if these truths,
which have thus far been debated in connection with the supreme Being,
have been declared on cogent grounds, even though they cannot be so
examined by the human intellect as to be capable of explanation in
words, their assured certainty is not therefore shaken. For, if a
consideration, such as that above, rationally comprehends that it is
incomprehensible in what way supreme Wisdom knows its creatures, of
which we necessarily know so many; who shall explain how it knows and
expresses itself, of which nothing or scarcely anything can be known by
man? Hence, if it is not by virtue of the self‑expression of this Wisdom
that the Father begets and the Son is begotten, *who shall tell his
generation?*
