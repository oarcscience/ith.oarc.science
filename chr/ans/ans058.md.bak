### <span id="v.XXV-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER XXV.

<span id="v.XXV-p1"></span>

<span id="v.XXV-p2"></span>It cannot suffer change by any accidents
\[Accidents, as Anselm uses the term, are facts external to the essence
of a being, which may yet be conceived to produce changes in a mutable
being.\]

<span id="v.XXV-p3"></span>

<span id="v.XXV-p4"></span>BUT does not this Being, which has been shown
to exist as in every way substantially identical with itself, sometimes
exist as different from itself, at any rate accidentally? But how is it
supremely immutable, if it can, I will not say, *be*, but, be conceived
of, as variable by virtue of accidents? And, on the other hand, does it
not partake of accident, since even this very fact that it is greater
than all other natures and that it is unlike them seems to be an
accident in its case (*illi accidere*)? But what is the inconsistency
between susceptibility to certain facts, called *accidents*, and natural
immutability, if from the undergoing of these accidents the substance
undergoes no change?

<span id="v.XXV-p5"></span>For, of all the facts, called accidents, some
are understood not to be present or absent without some variation in the
subject of the accident ‑‑ all colors, for instance ‑‑ while others are
known not to effect any change in a thing either by occurring or not
occurring ‑‑ certain relations, for instance. For it is certain that I
am neither older nor younger than a man who is not yet born, nor equal
to him, nor like him. But I shall be able to sustain and to lose all
these relations toward him, as soon as he shall have been born,
according as he shall grow, or undergo change through divers qualities.

<span id="v.XXV-p6"></span>It is made clear, then, that of all those
facts, called accidents, a part bring some degree of mutability in their
train, while a part do not impair at all the immutability<span
id="page_84">p. 84</span> <span id="v.XXV-Page_84"></span> of that in
whose case they occur. Hence, although the supreme Nature in its
simplicity has never undergone such accidents as cause mutation, yet it
does not disdain occasional expression in terms of those accidents which
are in no wise inconsistent with supreme immutability; and yet there is
no accident respecting its essence, whence it would be conceived of, as
itself variable.

<span id="v.XXV-p7"></span>Whence this conclusion, also, may be reached,
that it is susceptible of no accident; since, just as those accidents,
which effect some change by their occurrence or non‑occurrence, are by
virtue of this very effect of theirs regarded as being true *accidents*,
so those facts, which lack a like effect, are found to be improperly
called accidents. Therefore, this Essence is always, in every way,
substantially identical with itself; and it is never in any way
different from itself, even accidentally. But, however it may be as to
the proper signification of the term *accident*, this is undoubtedly
true, that of the supremely immutable Nature no statement can be made,
whence it shall be conceived of as mutable.
