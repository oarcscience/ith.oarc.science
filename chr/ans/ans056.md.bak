### <span id="v.XXIII-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER XXIII.

<span id="v.XXIII-p1"></span>

<span id="v.XXIII-p2"></span>How it is better conceived to exist
everywhere than in every place

<span id="v.XXIII-p3"></span>

<span id="v.XXIII-p4"></span>BUT, since it is plain that this supreme
Nature is not more truly in all places than in all existing things, not
as if it were contained by them, but as containing all, by permeating
all, why should it not be said to be everywhere, in this sense, that it
may be understood rather to be in all existing things, than merely in
all places, since this sense is supported by the truth of the fact, and
is not forbidden by the proper signification of the word of place?

<span id="v.XXIII-p5"></span>For we often quite properly apply terms of
place to objects which are not places; as, when I say that the
understanding is *there* in the soul, *where* rationality is. For,
though *there* and *where* are adverbs of place, yet, by no local
limitation, does the mind contain anything, nor is either rationality or
understanding contained.

<span id="v.XXIII-p6"></span>Hence, as regards the truth of the matter,
the supreme Nature is more appropriately said to be everywhere, in this
sense, that it is in all existing things, than in this sense, namely
that it is merely in all places. And since, as the reasons set forth
above show, it cannot exist otherwise, it must so be in all existing
things, that it is one and the same perfect whole in every individual
thing simultaneously.
