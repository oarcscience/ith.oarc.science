### <span id="iv.X-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER X.

<span id="iv.X-p2"></span>

<span id="iv.X-p3"></span>How he justly punishes and justly spares the
wicked. ‑‑God, in sparing the wicked, is just, according to his own
nature because he does what is consistent with his goodness; but he is
not just, according to our nature, because he does not inflict the
punishment deserved.

<span id="iv.X-p4"></span>

<span id="iv.X-p5"></span>BUT it is also just that thou shouldst punish
the wicked. For what is more just than that the good should receive
goods, and the evil, evils? How, then, is it just that thou shouldst
punish the wicked, and, at the same time, spare the wicked? Or, in one
way, dost thou justly punish, and, in another, justly spare them? For,
when thou punishest the wicked, it is just, because it is consistent
with their deserts; and when, on the other hand, thou sparest the
wicked, it is just, not because it is compatible with their deserts, but
because it is compatible with thy goodness.

<span id="iv.X-p6"></span>For, in sparing the wicked, thou art as just,
according to thy nature, but not according to ours, as thou art
compassionate, according to our nature, and not according to thine;
seeing that, as in saving us, whom it would be just for thee to destroy,
thou art compassionate, not because thou feelest an affection
(*affectum*), but because we feel the effect (*effectum*); so thou art
just, not because thou requitest us as we deserve, but because thou dost
that which becomes thee as the supremely good Being. In this way,
therefore, without contradiction thou dost justly punish and justly
spare.
