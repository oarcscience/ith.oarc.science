### <span id="iv.IV-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER IV.

<span id="iv.IV-p1"></span>

<span id="iv.IV-p2"></span>How the fool has said in his heart what
cannot be conceived. ‑‑A thing may be conceived in two ways: (1) when
the word signifying it is conceived; (2) when the thing itself is
understood As far as the word goes, God can be conceived not to exist;
in reality he cannot.

<span id="iv.IV-p3"></span>

<span id="iv.IV-p4"></span>BUT how has the fool said in his heart what
he could not conceive; or how is it that he could not conceive what he
said in his heart? since it is the same to say in the heart, and to
conceive.

<span id="iv.IV-p5"></span>But, if really, nay, since really, he both
conceived, because he said in his heart; and did not say in his heart,
because he could not conceive; there is more than one way in which a
thing is said in the heart or conceived. For, in one sense, an object is
conceived, <span id="page_9">p. 9</span> <span
id="iv.IV-Page_9"></span>when the word signifying it is conceived; and
in another, when the very entity, which the object is, is understood.

<span id="iv.IV-p6"></span>In the former sense, then, God can be
conceived not to exist; but in the latter, not at all. For no one who
understands what fire and water are can conceive fire to be water, in
accordance with the nature of the facts themselves, although this is
possible according to the words. So, then, no one who understands what
God is can conceive that God does not exist; although he says these
words in his heart, either without any or with some foreign,
signification. For, God is that than which a greater cannot be
conceived. And he who thoroughly understands this, assuredly understands
that this being so truly exists, that not even in concept can it be
non‑existent. Therefore, he who understands that God so exists, cannot
conceive that he does not exist.

<span id="iv.IV-p7"></span>I thank thee, gracious Lord, I thank thee;
because what I formerly believed by thy bounty, I now so understand by
thine illumination, that if I were unwilling to believe that thou dost
exist, I should not be able not to understand this to be true.

<span id="iv.IV-p8"></span>
