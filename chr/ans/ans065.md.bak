### <span id="v.XXXII-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER XXXII.

<span id="v.XXXII-p2"></span>

<span id="v.XXXII-p3"></span>The supreme Spirit expresses himself by a
coeternal Word.

<span id="v.XXXII-p4"></span>

<span id="v.XXXII-p5"></span>BUT since this is true, how can what is
simple Truth be the Word corresponding to those objects, of which it is
not the likeness? Since every word by which an object is thus mentally
expressed is the likeness of that object, if this is not the word
corresponding to the objects that have been created through it, how
shall we be sure that it is the Word? For every word is a word
corresponding to some object. Therefore, if there were no creature,
there would be no word.

<span id="v.XXXII-p6"></span>Are we to conclude, then, that if there
were no creature, that Word would not exist at all, which is the supreme
self‑sufficient Essence? Or, would the supreme Being itself, perhaps,
which is the Word still be the eternal Being, but not the Word, if
nothing were ever created through that Being? For, to what has not been,
and is not, and will not be, then can be no word corresponding.

<span id="v.XXXII-p7"></span>But, according to this reasoning, if there
were never any being but the supreme Spirit, there would be no word at
all in him. If there were no word in him, he would express nothing to
himself; if he expressed nothing to himself, since, for him, expressing
anything is the same with understanding or conceiving of it
(*intelligere*), he would not understand or conceive of anything; if he
understood or conceived of nothing, then the supreme Wisdom, which is
nothing else than this Spirit, would understand or conceive of nothing;
which is most absurd.

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span> <span id="v.XXXII-Page_93"></span>

<span id="v.XXXII-p8"></span>What is to be inferred? For, if it
conceived of nothing, how would it be the supreme Wisdom? Or, if there
were in no wise anything but it, of what would it conceive? Would it not
conceive of itself? But how can it be even imagined that the supreme
Wisdom, at any time does not conceive of itself; since a rational mind
can remember not only itself, but that supreme Wisdom, and conceive of
that Wisdom and of itself? For, if the human mind could have no memory
or concept of that Wisdom or of itself, it would not distinguish itself
at all from irrational creatures, and that Wisdom from the whole created
world, in silent meditation by itself, as my mind does now.

<span id="v.XXXII-p9"></span>Hence, that Spirit, supreme as he is
eternal, is thus eternally mindful of himself, and conceives of himself
after the likeness of a rational mind; nay, not after the likeness of
anything; but in the first place that Spirit, and the rational mind
after its likeness. But, if he conceives of himself eternally, he
expresses himself eternally. If he expresses himself eternally, his Word
is eternally with him. Whether, therefore, it be thought of in
connection with no other existing being, or with other existing beings,
the Word of that Spirit must be coeternal with him.
