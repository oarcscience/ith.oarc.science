<span id="vi-p1"></span><span id="vi-p1.1"></span>APPENDIX.

<span id="vi.i"></span>

<span id="vi.i-p1"></span><span id="vi.i-p1.1"></span>IN BEHALF OF THE
FOOL.

<span id="vi.i-p2"></span>

<span id="vi.i-p3"></span><span id="vi.i-p3.1"></span>AN ANSWER TO THE
ARGUMENT OF ANSELM IN THE PROSLOGIUM.

<span id="vi.i-p4"></span><span id="vi.i-p4.1"></span>BY <span
id="vi.i-p4.2"></span>GAUNILON<span id="vi.i-p4.3"></span>, A MONK OF
MARMOUTIER.

<span id="vi.i-p5"></span>

<span id="vi.i-p6"></span>1. IF one doubts or denies the existence of a
being of such a nature that nothing greater than it can be conceived, he
receives this answer:

<span id="vi.i-p7"></span>The existence of this being is proved, in the
first place, by the fact that he himself, in his doubt or denial
regarding this being, already has it in his understanding; for in
hearing it spoken of he understands what is spoken of. It is proved,
therefore, by the fact that what he understands must exist not only in
his understanding, but in reality also.

<span id="vi.i-p8"></span>And the proof of this is as follows. ‑‑ It is
a greater thing to exist both in the understanding and in reality than
to be in the understanding alone. And if this being is in the
understanding alone, whatever has even in the past existed in reality
will be greater than this being. And so that which was greater than all
beings will be less than some being, and will not be greater than all:
which is a manifest contradiction.

<span id="vi.i-p9"></span>And hence, that which is greater than all,
already proved to be in the understanding, must exist not only in the
understanding, but also in reality: for otherwise it will not be greater
than all other beings.

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span> <span id="vi.i-Page_144"></span>

<span id="vi.i-p10"></span>2. The fool might make this reply:

<span id="vi.i-p11"></span>This being is said to be in my understanding
already, only because I understand what is said. Now could it not with
equal justice be said that I have in my understanding all manner of
unreal objects, having absolutely no existence in themselves, because I
understand these things if one speaks of them, whatever they may be?

<span id="vi.i-p12"></span>Unless indeed it is shown that this being is
of such a character that it cannot be held in concept like all unreal
objects, or objects whose existence is uncertain: and hence I am not
able to conceive of it when I hear of it, or to hold it in concept; but
I must understand it and have it in my understanding; because, it seems,
I cannot conceive of it in any other way than by understanding it, that
is, by comprehending in my knowledge its existence in reality.

<span id="vi.i-p13"></span>But if this is the case, in the first place
there will be no distinction between what has precedence in time ‑‑
namely, the having of an object in the understanding ‑‑ and what is
subsequent in time ‑‑ namely, the understanding that an object exists;
as in the example of the picture, which exists first in the mind of the
painter, and afterwards in his work.

<span id="vi.i-p14"></span>Moreover, the following assertion can hardly
be accepted: that this being, when it is spoken of and heard of, cannot
be conceived not to exist in the way in which even God can be conceived
not to exist. For if this is impossible, what was the object of this
argument against one who doubts or denies the existence of such a being?

<span id="vi.i-p15"></span>Finally, that this being so exists that it
cannot be perceived by an understanding convinced of its own indubitable
existence, unless this being is afterwards <span id="page_145">p.
145</span> <span id="vi.i-Page_145"></span>conceived of ‑‑ this should
be proved to me by an indisputable argument, but not by that which you
have advanced: namely, that what I understand, when I hear it, already
is in my understanding. For thus in my understanding, as I still think,
could be all sorts of things whose existence is uncertain, or which do
not exist at all, if some one whose words I should understand mentioned
them. And so much the more if I should be deceived, as often happens,
and believe in them: though I do not yet believe in the being whose
existence you would prove.

<span id="vi.i-p16"></span>3. Hence, your example of the painter who
already has in his understanding what he is to paint cannot agree with
this argument. For the picture, before it is made, is contained in the
artificer’s art itself; and any such thing, existing in the art of an
artificer, is nothing but a part of his understanding itself. A joiner,
<span id="vi.i-p16.1"></span>St. Augustine says, when he is about to
make a box in fact, first has it in his art. The box which is made in
fact is not life; but the box which exists in his art is life. For the
artificer’s soul lives, in which all these things are, before they are
produced. Why, then, are these things life in the living soul of the
artificer, unless because they are nothing else than the knowledge or
understanding of the soul itself?

<span id="vi.i-p17"></span>With the exception, however, of those facts
which are known to pertain to the mental nature, whatever, on being
heard and thought out by the understanding, is perceived to be real,
undoubtedly that real object is one thing, and the understanding itself,
by which the object is grasped, is another. Hence, even if it were true
that there is a being than which a greater is inconceivable: yet to this
being, when <span id="page_146">p. 146</span> <span
id="vi.i-Page_146"></span>heard of and understood, the not yet created
picture in the mind of the painter is not analogous.

<span id="vi.i-p18"></span>4. Let us notice also the point touched on
above, with regard to this being which is greater than all which can be
conceived, and which, it is said, can be none other than God himself. I,
so far as actual knowledge of the object, either from its specific or
general character, is concerned, am as little able to conceive of this
being when I hear of it, or to have it in my understanding, as I am to
conceive of or understand God himself: whom, indeed, for this very
reason I can conceive not to exist. For I do not know that reality
itself which God is, nor can I form a conjecture of that reality from
some other like reality. For you yourself assert that that reality is
such that there can be nothing else like it.

<span id="vi.i-p19"></span>For, suppose that I should hear something
said of a man absolutely unknown to me, of whose very existence I was
unaware. Through that special or general knowledge by which I know what
man is, or what men are, I could conceive of him also, according to the
reality itself, which man is. And yet it would be possible, if the
person who told me of him deceived me, that the man himself, of whom I
conceived, did not exist ; since that reality according to which I
conceived of him, though a no less indisputable fact, was not that man,
but any man.

<span id="vi.i-p20"></span>Hence, I am not able, in the way in which I
should have this unreal being in concept or in understanding, to have
that being of which you speak in concept or in understanding, when I
hear the word *God* or the words, *a being greater than all other
beings*. For I can conceive of the man according to a fact that is real
and familiar to me: but of God, or a being greater <span
id="page_147">p. 147</span> <span id="vi.i-Page_147"></span>than all
others, I could not conceive at all, except merely according to the
word. And an object can hardly or never be conceived according to the
word alone.

<span id="vi.i-p21"></span>For when it is so conceived, it is not so
much the word itself (which is, indeed, a real thing ‑‑ that is, the
sound of the letters and syllables) as the signification of the word,
when heard, that is conceived. But it is not conceived as by one who
knows what is generally signified by the word; by whom, that is, it is
conceived according to a reality and in true conception alone. It is
conceived as by a man who does not know the object, and conceives of it
only in accordance with the movement of his mind produced by hearing the
word, the mind attempting to image for itself the signification of the
word that is heard. And it would be surprising if in the reality of fact
it could ever attain to this.

<span id="vi.i-p22"></span>Thus, it appears, and in no other way, this
being is also in my understanding, when I hear and understand a person
who says that there is a being greater than all conceivable beings. So
much for the assertion that this supreme nature already is in my
understanding.

<span id="vi.i-p23"></span>5. But that this being must exist, not only
in the understanding but also in reality, is thus proved to me:

<span id="vi.i-p24"></span>If it did not so exist, whatever exists in
reality would be greater than it. And so the being which has been
already proved to exist in my understanding, will not be greater than
all other beings.

<span id="vi.i-p25"></span>I still answer: if it should be said that a
being which cannot be even conceived in terms of any fact, is in the
understanding, I do not deny that this being is, accordingly, in my
understanding. But since <span id="page_148">p. 148</span> <span
id="vi.i-Page_148"></span>through this fact it can in no wise attain to
real existence also, I do not yet concede to it that existence at all,
until some certain proof of it shall be given.

<span id="vi.i-p26"></span>For he who says that this being exists,
because otherwise the being which is greater than all will not be
greater than all, does not attend strictly enough to what he is saying.
For I do not yet say, no, I even deny or doubt that this being is
greater than any real object. Nor do I concede to it any other existence
than this (if it should be called existence) which it has when the mind,
according to a word merely heard, tries to form the image of an object
absolutely unknown to it.

<span id="vi.i-p27"></span>How, then, is the veritable existence of that
being proved to me from the assumption, by hypothesis, that it is
greater than all other beings? For I should still deny this, or doubt
your demonstration of it, to this extent, that I should not admit that
this being is in my understanding and concept even in the way in which
many objects whose real existence is uncertain and doubtful, are in my
understanding and concept. For it should be proved first that this being
itself really exists somewhere; and then, from the fact that it is
greater than all, we shall not hesitate to infer that it also subsists
in itself.

<span id="vi.i-p28"></span>6. For example: it is said that somewhere in
the ocean is an island, which, because of the difficulty, or rather the
impossibility, of discovering what does not exist, is called the lost
island. And they say that this island has an inestimable wealth of all
manner of riches and delicacies in greater abundance than is told of the
Islands of the Blest; and that having no owner or inhabitant, it is more
excellent than all other countries<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>
<span id="vi.i-Page_149"></span>, which are inhabited by mankind, in the
abundance with which it is stored.

<span id="vi.i-p29"></span>Now if some one should tell me that there is
such an island, I should easily understand his words, in which there is
no difficulty. But suppose that he went on to say, as if by a logical
inference: “You can no longer doubt that this island which is more
excellent than all lands exists somewhere, since you have no doubt that
it is in your understanding. And since it is more excellent not to be in
the understanding alone, but to exist both in the understanding and in
reality, for this reason it must exist. For if it does not exist, any
land which really exists will be more excellent than it; and so the
island already understood by you to be more excellent will not be more
excellent.”

<span id="vi.i-p30"></span>If a man should try to prove to me by such
reasoning that this island truly exists, and that its existence should
no longer be doubted, either I should believe that he was jesting, or I
know not which I ought to regard as the greater fool: myself, supposing
that I should allow this proof; or him, if he should suppose that he had
established with any certainty the existence of this island. For he
ought to show first that the hypothetical excellence of this island
exists as a real and indubitable fact, and in no wise as any unreal
object, or one whose existence is uncertain, in my understanding.

<span id="vi.i-p31"></span>7. This, in the mean time, is the answer the
fool could make to the arguments urged against him. When he is assured
in the first place that this being is so great that its non‑existence is
not even conceivable, and that this in turn is proved on no other ground
than the fact that otherwise it will not be greater than <span
id="page_150">p. 150</span> <span id="vi.i-Page_150"></span>all things,
the fool may make the same answer, and say:

<span id="vi.i-p32"></span>When did I say that any such being exists in
reality, that is, a being greater than all others? ‑‑ that on this
ground it should be proved to me that it also exists in reality to such
a degree that it cannot even be conceived not to exist? Whereas in the
first place it should be in some way proved that a nature which is
higher, that is, greater and better, than all other natures, exists; in
order that from this we may then be able to prove all attributes which
necessarily the being that is greater and better than all possesses.

<span id="vi.i-p33"></span>Moreover, it is said that the non‑existence
of this being is inconceivable. It might better be said, perhaps, that
its non‑existence, or the possibility of its non‑existence, is
unintelligible. For according to the true meaning of the word, unreal
objects are unintelligible. Yet their existence is conceivable in the
way in which the fool conceived of the non‑existence of God. I am most
certainly aware of my own existence; but I know, nevertheless, that my
non‑existence is possible. As to that supreme being, moreover, which God
is, I understand without any doubt both his existence, and the
impossibility of his non‑existence. Whether, however, so long as I am
most positively aware of my existence, I can conceive of my
non‑existence, I am not sure. But if I can, why can I not conceive of
the non‑existence of whatever else I know with the same certainty? If,
however, I cannot, God will not be the only being of which it can be
said, it is impossible to conceive of his non‑existence.

<span id="vi.i-p34"></span>8. The other parts of this book are argued
with such truth, such brilliancy, such grandeur; and are so replete with
usefulness, so fragrant with a certain <span id="page_151">p. 151</span>
<span id="vi.i-Page_151"></span>perfume of devout and holy feeling, that
though there are matters in the beginning which, however rightly sensed,
are weakly presented, the rest of the work should not be rejected on
this account. The rather ought these earlier matters to be reasoned more
cogently, and the whole to be received with great respect and honor.
