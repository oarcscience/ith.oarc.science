<span id="v.LXXVII-p2"></span>

<span id="v.LXXVII-p3"></span>What is living, and what dead faith.

<span id="v.LXXVII-p4"></span>

<span id="v.LXXVII-p5"></span>HENCE, with however great confidence so
important a truth is believed, the faith will be useless and, as it
were, dead, unless it is strong and living through love. For, that the
faith which is accompanied by sufficient love is by no means idle, if an
opportunity of operation offers, but rather exercises itself in an
abundance of works, as it could not do without love, may be proved from
this fact alone, that, since it loves the supreme Justice, it can scorn
nothing that is just, it can approve nothing that is unjust. Therefore,
seeing that the fact of its operation shows that life, without which it
could not operate, is inherent in it; it is not absurd to say that
operative faith is alive, because it has the life of love without which
it could not operate; and that idle faith is not living, because it
lacks that life of love, with which it would not be idle.

<span id="v.LXXVII-p6"></span>Hence, if not only he who has lost his
sight is called blind, but also he who ought to have sight and has it
not, why cannot, in like manner, *faith without love* be called *dead*;
not because it has lost its life, that is, love; but because it has not
the life which it ought always to have? As that faith, then, which
operates through love is recognised as living, so that which is idle,
through contempt, is proved to be dead. It may, therefore, be said with
sufficient fitness that living faith believes *in* that *in* which we
ought to believe; while dead faith merely believes that which ought to
be believed.
