### <span id="v.LI-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LI.

<span id="v.LI-p2"></span>

<span id="v.LI-p3"></span>Each loves himself and the other with equal
love.

<span id="v.LI-p4"></span>

<span id="v.LI-p5"></span>BUT if the supreme Spirit loves himself, no
doubt the Father loves himself, the Son loves himself, and the one the
other; since the Father separately is the supreme Spirit, and the Son
separately is the supreme<span id="page_113">p. 113</span> <span
id="v.LI-Page_113"></span> Spirit, and both at once one Spirit. And,
since each equally remembers himself and the other, and conceives
equally of himself and the other; and since what is loved, or loves in
the Father, or in the Son, is altogether the same, necessarily each
loves himself and the other with an equal love.
