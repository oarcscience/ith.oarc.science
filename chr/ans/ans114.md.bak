<span id="vi.ii-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii-p1.1"></span>ANSELM’S
APOLOGETIC.

<span id="vi.ii-p2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p3"></span><span id="vi.ii-p3.1"></span>IN REPLY TO
GAUNILON’S ANSWER IN BEHALF OF THE FOOL.

<span id="vi.ii-p4"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p5"></span>IT was a fool against whom the argument of my
Proslogium was directed. Seeing, however, that the author of these
objections is by no means a fool, and is a Catholic, speaking in behalf
of the fool, I think it sufficient that I answer the Catholic.

<span id="vi.ii-p6"></span> <span id="vi.ii.I"></span>

### <span id="vi.ii.I-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER I.

<span id="vi.ii.I-p1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.I-p2"></span>A general refutation of Gaunilon’s
argument. It is shown that a being than which a greater cannot be
conceived exists in reality.

<span id="vi.ii.I-p3"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.I-p4"></span>YOU say ‑‑ whosoever you may be, who say
that a fool is capable of making these statements ‑‑ that a being than
which a greater cannot be conceived is not in the understanding in any
other sense than that in which a being that is altogether inconceivable
in terms of reality, is in the understanding. You say that the inference
that this being exists in reality, from the fact that it is in the
understanding, is no more just than the inference that a lost island
most certainly exists, from the fact that when it is described the
hearer does not doubt that it is in his understanding.

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span> <span id="vi.ii.I-Page_152"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.I-p5"></span>But I say: if a being than which a greater
is inconceivable is not understood or conceived, and is not in the
understanding or in concept, certainly either God is not a being than
which a greater is inconceivable, or else he is not understood or
conceived, and is not in the understanding or in concept. But I call on
your faith and conscience to attest that this is most false. Hence, that
than which a greater cannot be conceived is truly understood and
conceived, and is in the understanding and in concept. Therefore either
the grounds on which you try to controvert me are not true, or else the
inference which you think to base logically on those grounds is not
justified.

<span id="vi.ii.I-p6"></span>But you hold, moreover, that supposing that
a being than which a greater cannot be conceived is understood, it does
not follow that this being is in the understanding; nor, if it is in the
understanding, does it therefore exist in reality.

<span id="vi.ii.I-p7"></span>In answer to this, I maintain positively:
if that being can be even conceived to be, it must exist in reality. For
that than which a greater is inconceivable cannot be conceived except as
without beginning. But whatever can be conceived to exist, and does not
exist, can be conceived to exist through a beginning. Hence what can be
conceived to exist, but does not exist, is not the being than which a
greater cannot be conceived. Therefore, if such a being can be conceived
to exist, necessarily it does exist.

<span id="vi.ii.I-p8"></span>Furthermore: if it can be conceived at all,
it must exist. For no one who denies or doubts the existence of a being
than which a greater is inconceivable, denies or doubts that if it did
exist, its non‑existence, either in reality or in the understanding,
would be impossible. For otherwise it would not be a being <span
id="page_153">p. 153</span> <span id="vi.ii.I-Page_153"></span>than
which a greater cannot be conceived. But as to whatever can be
conceived, but does not exist ‑‑ if there were such a being, its
non‑existence, either in reality or in the understanding, would be
possible. Therefore if a being than which a greater is inconceivable can
be even conceived, it cannot be nonexistent.

<span id="vi.ii.I-p9"></span>But let us suppose that it does not exist,
even if it can be conceived. Whatever can be conceived, but does not
exist, if it existed, would not be a being than which a greater is
inconceivable. If, then, there were a being a greater than which is
inconceivable, it would not be a being than which a greater is
inconceivable: which is most absurd. Hence, it is false to deny that a
being than which a greater cannot be conceived exists, if it can be even
conceived; much the more, therefore, if it can be understood or can be
in the understanding.

<span id="vi.ii.I-p10"></span>Moreover, I will venture to make this
assertion: without doubt, whatever at any place or at any time does not
exist ‑‑ even if it does exist at some place or at some time ‑‑ can be
conceived to exist nowhere and never, as at some place and at some time
it does not exist. For what did not exist yesterday, and exists to‑day,
as it is understood not to have existed yesterday, so it can be
apprehended by the intelligence that it never exists. And what is not
here, and is elsewhere, can be conceived to be nowhere, just as it is
not here. So with regard to an object of which the individual parts do
not exist at the same places or times: all its parts and therefore its
very whole can be conceived to exist nowhere or never.

<span id="vi.ii.I-p11"></span>For, although time is said to exist
always, and the world everywhere, yet time does not as a whole exist
<span id="page_154">p. 154</span> <span
id="vi.ii.I-Page_154"></span>always, nor the world as a whole
everywhere. And as individual parts of time do not exist when others
exist, so they can be conceived never to exist. And so it can be
apprehended by the intelligence that individual parts of the world exist
nowhere, as they do not exist where other parts exist. Moreover, what is
composed of parts can be dissolved in concept, and be non‑existent.
Therefore, whatever at any place or at any time does not exist as a
whole, even if it is existent, can be conceived not to exist.

<span id="vi.ii.I-p12"></span>But that than which a greater cannot be
conceived, if it exists, cannot be conceived not to exist. Otherwise, it
is not a being than which a greater cannot be conceived: which is
inconsistent. By no means, then, does it at any place or at any time
fail to exist as a whole: but it exists as a whole everywhere and
always.

<span id="vi.ii.I-p13"></span>Do you believe that this being can in some
way be conceived or understood, or that the being with regard to which
these things are understood can be in concept or in the understanding?
For if it cannot, these things cannot be understood with reference to
it. But if you say that it is not understood and that it is not in the
understanding, because it is not thoroughly understood; you should say
that a man who cannot face the direct rays of the sun does not see the
light of day, which is none other than the sunlight. Assuredly a being
than which a greater cannot be conceived exists, and is in the
understanding, at least to this extent ‑‑ that these statements
regarding it are understood.

<span id="vi.ii.I-p14"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.I-p15"></span> <span id="vi.ii.II"></span> <span
id="page_155">p. 155</span> <span id="vi.ii.II-Page_155"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.II-p1"></span>

### <span id="vi.ii.II-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER II.

<span id="vi.ii.II-p2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.II-p3"></span>The argument is continued. It is shown
that a being than which a greater is inconceivable can be conceived, and
also, in so far, exists.

<span id="vi.ii.II-p4"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.II-p5"></span>I HAVE said, then, in the argument which
you dispute, that when the fool hears mentioned a being than which a
greater is inconceivable, he understands what he hears. Certainly a man
who does not understand when a familiar language is spoken, has no
understanding at all, or a very dull one. Moreover, I have said that if
this being is understood, it is in the understanding. Is that in no
understanding which has been proved necessarily to exist in the reality
of fact?

<span id="vi.ii.II-p6"></span>But you will say that although it is in
the understanding, it does not follow that it is understood. But observe
that the fact of its being understood does necessitate its being in the
understanding. For as what is conceived, is conceived by conception, and
what is conceived by conception, as it is conceived, so is in
conception; so what is understood, is understood by understanding, and
what is understood by understanding, as it is understood, so is in the
understanding. What can be more clear than this?

<span id="vi.ii.II-p7"></span>After this, I have said that if it is even
in the understanding alone, it can be conceived also to exist in
reality, which is greater. If, then, it is in the understanding alone,
obviously the very being than which greater cannot be conceived is one
than which a greater can be conceived. What is more logical? For if it
exists even in the understanding alone, can it not be conceived also to
exist in reality? And if it can be so conceived, does not he who
conceives of this conceive of a thing greater than that being, if it
exists <span id="page_156">p. 156</span> <span
id="vi.ii.II-Page_156"></span>in the understanding alone? What more
consistent inference, then, can be made than this: that if a being than
which a greater cannot be conceived is in the understanding alone, it is
not that than which a greater cannot be conceived?

<span id="vi.ii.II-p8"></span>But, assuredly, in no understanding is a
being than which a greater is conceivable a being than which a greater
is inconceivable. Does it not follow, then, that if a being than which a
greater cannot be conceived is in any understanding, it does not exist
in the understanding alone? For if it is in the understanding alone, it
is a being than which a greater can be conceived, which is inconsistent
with the hypothesis.

<span id="vi.ii.II-p9"></span> <span id="vi.ii.III"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.III-p1"></span>

### <span id="vi.ii.III-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER III.

<span id="vi.ii.III-p2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.III-p3"></span>A criticism of Gaunilon’s example, in
which he tries to show that in this way the real existence of a lost
island might be inferred from the fact of its being conceived.

<span id="vi.ii.III-p4"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.III-p5"></span>BUT, you say, it is as if one should
suppose an island in the ocean, which surpasses all lands in its
fertility, and which, because of the difficulty, or the impossibility,
of discovering what does not exist, is called a lost island; and should
say that there can no doubt that this island truly exists in reality,
for this reason, that one who hears it described easily understands what
he hears.

<span id="vi.ii.III-p6"></span>Now I promise confidently that if any man
shall devise anything existing either in reality or in concept alone
(except that than which a greater be conceived) to which he can adapt
the sequence of my reasoning, I will discover that thing, and will give
him his lost island, not to be lost again.

<span id="vi.ii.III-p7"></span>But it now appears that this being than
which a greater is inconceivable cannot be conceived not to <span
id="page_157">p. 157</span> <span id="vi.ii.III-Page_157"></span>be,
because it exists on so assured a ground of truth; for otherwise it
would not exist at all.

<span id="vi.ii.III-p8"></span>Hence, if any one says that he conceives
this being not to exist, I say that at the time when he conceives of
this either he conceives of a being than which a greater is
inconceivable, or he does not conceive at all. If he does not conceive,
he does not conceive of the non‑existence of that of which he does not
conceive. But if he does conceive, he certainly conceives of a being
which cannot be even conceived not to exist. For if it could be
conceived not to exist, it could be conceived to have a beginning and an
end. But this is impossible.

<span id="vi.ii.III-p9"></span>He, then, who conceives of this being
conceives of a being which cannot be even conceived not to exist; but he
who conceives of this being does not conceive that it does not exist;
else he conceives what is inconceivable. The non‑existence, then, of
that than which a greater cannot be conceived is inconceivable.

<span id="vi.ii.III-p10"></span> <span id="vi.ii.IV"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.IV-p1"></span>

### <span id="vi.ii.IV-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER IV.

<span id="vi.ii.IV-p2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.IV-p3"></span>The difference between the possibility of
conceiving of non‑existence, and understanding non‑existence.

<span id="vi.ii.IV-p4"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.IV-p5"></span>YOU say, moreover, that whereas I assert
that this supreme being cannot be *conceived* not to exist, it might
better be said that its non‑existence, or even the possibility of its
non‑existence, cannot be *understood*.

<span id="vi.ii.IV-p6"></span>But it was more proper to say, it cannot
be conceived. For if I had said that the object itself cannot be
understood not to exist, possibly you yourself, who say that in
accordance with the true meaning of the term what is unreal cannot be
understood, would offer the objection that nothing which is can be
understood<span id="page_158">p. 158</span> <span
id="vi.ii.IV-Page_158"></span> not to be, for the non‑existence of what
exists is unreal: hence God would not be the only being of which it
could be said, it is impossible to understand its non‑existence. For
thus one of those beings which most certainly exist can be understood
not to exist in the same way in which certain other real objects can be
understood not to exist.

<span id="vi.ii.IV-p7"></span>But this objection, assuredly, cannot be
urged against the term *conception*, if one considers the matter well.
For although no objects which exist can be understood not to exist, yet
all objects, except that which exists in the highest degree, can be
conceived not to exist. For all those objects, and those alone, can be
conceived not to exist, which have a beginning or end or composition of
parts: also, as I have already said, whatever at any place or at any
time does not exist as a whole.

<span id="vi.ii.IV-p8"></span>That being alone, on the other hand,
cannot be conceived not to exist, in which any conception discovers
neither beginning nor end nor composition of parts, and which any
conception finds always and everywhere as a whole.

<span id="vi.ii.IV-p9"></span>Be assured, then, that you can conceive of
your own non‑existence, although you are most certain that you exist. I
am surprised that you should have admitted that you are ignorant of
this. For we conceive of the non‑existence of many objects which we know
to exist, and of the existence of many which we know not to exist; not
by forming the opinion that they so exist, but by imagining that they
exist as we conceive of them.

<span id="vi.ii.IV-p10"></span>And indeed, we can conceive of the
non‑existence of an object, although we know it to exist, because at the
same time we can conceive of the former and <span id="page_159">p.
159</span> <span id="vi.ii.IV-Page_159"></span>know the latter. And we
cannot conceive of the nonexistence of an object, so long as we know it
to exist, because we cannot conceive at the same time of existence and
non‑existence.

<span id="vi.ii.IV-p11"></span>If, then, one will thus distinguish these
two senses of this statement, he will understand that nothing, so long
as it is known to exist, can be conceived not to exist; and that
whatever exists, except that being than which a greater cannot be
conceived, can be conceived not to exist, even when it is known to
exist.

<span id="vi.ii.IV-p12"></span>So, then, of God alone it can be said
that it is impossible to conceive of his non‑existence; and yet many
objects, so long as they exist, in one sense cannot be conceived not to
exist. But in what sense God is to be conceived not to exist, I think
has been shown clearly enough in my book.

<span id="vi.ii.IV-p13"></span> <span id="vi.ii.V"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.V-p1"></span>

### <span id="vi.ii.V-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER V.

<span id="vi.ii.V-p2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.V-p3"></span>A particular discussion of certain
statements of Gaunilon’s. In the first place, he misquoted the argument
which he undertook to refute.

<span id="vi.ii.V-p4"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.V-p5"></span>THE nature of the other objections which
you, in behalf of the fool, urge against me it is easy, even for a man
of small wisdom, to detect; and I had therefore thought it unnecessary
to show this. But since I hear that some readers of these objections
think they have some weight against me, I will discuss them briefly.

<span id="vi.ii.V-p6"></span>In the first place, you often repeat that I
assert that what is greater than all other beings is in the
understanding; and if it is in the understanding, it exists also in
reality, for otherwise the being which is greater than all would not be
greater than all.

<span id="vi.ii.V-p7"></span>Nowhere in all my writings is such a
demonstration found. For the real existence of a being which <span
id="page_160">p. 160</span> <span id="vi.ii.V-Page_160"></span>is said
to be *greater than all other beings* cannot be demonstrated in the same
way with the real existence of one that is said to be *a being than
which a greater cannot be conceived*.

<span id="vi.ii.V-p8"></span>If it should be said that a being than
which a greater cannot be conceived has no real existence, or that it is
possible that it does not exist, or even that it can be conceived not to
exist, such an assertion can be easily refuted. For the non‑existence of
what does not exist is possible, and that whose non‑existence is
possible can be conceived not to exist. But whatever can be conceived
not to exist, if it exists, is not a being than which a greater cannot
be conceived; but if it does not exist, it would not, even if it
existed, be a being than which a greater cannot be conceived. But it
cannot be said that a being than which a greater is inconceivable, if it
exists, is not a being than which a greater is inconceivable; or that if
it existed, it would not be a being than which a greater is
inconceivable.

<span id="vi.ii.V-p9"></span>It is evident, then, that neither is it
non‑existent, nor is it possible that it does not exist, nor can it be
conceived not to exist. For otherwise, if it exists, it is not that
which it is said to be in the hypothesis; and if it existed, it would
not be what it is said to be in the hypothesis.

<span id="vi.ii.V-p10"></span>But this, it appears, cannot be so easily
proved of a being which is said to be *greater than all other beings*.
For it is not so evident that what can be conceived not to exist is not
greater than all existing beings, as it is evident that it is not a
being than which a greater cannot be conceived. Nor is it so indubitable
that if a being greater than all other beings exists, it is no other
than the being than which a greater cannot be conceived; or that if it
were such a being, <span id="page_161">p. 161</span> <span
id="vi.ii.V-Page_161"></span>some other might not be this being in like
manner; as it is certain with regard to a being which is hypothetically
posited as one than which a greater cannot be conceived.

<span id="vi.ii.V-p11"></span>For consider: if one should say that there
is a being greater than all other beings, and that this being can
nevertheless be conceived not to exist; and that a being greater than
this, although it does not exist, can be conceived to exist: can it be
so clearly inferred in this case that this being is therefore not a
being greater than all other existing beings, as it would be most
positively affirmed in the other case, that the being under discussion
is not, therefore, a being than which a greater cannot be conceived?

<span id="vi.ii.V-p12"></span>For the former conclusion requires another
premise than the predication, *greater than all other beings*. In my
argument, on the other hand, there is no need of any other than this
very predication, *a being than which a greater cannot be conceived*.

<span id="vi.ii.V-p13"></span>If the same proof cannot be applied when
the being in question is predicated to be greater than all others, which
can be applied when it is predicated to be a being than which a greater
cannot be conceived, you have unjustly censured me for saying what I did
not say; since such a predication differs so greatly from that which I
actually made. If, on the other hand, the other argument is valid, you
ought not to blame me so for having said what can be proved.

<span id="vi.ii.V-p14"></span>Whether this can be proved, however, he
will easily decide who recognises that this being than which a greater
cannot be conceived is demonstrable. For by no means can this being than
which a greater cannot be conceived be understood as any other than that
which alone is greater than all. Hence, just as <span id="page_162">p.
162</span> <span id="vi.ii.V-Page_162"></span>that than which a greater
cannot be conceived is understood, and is in the understanding, and for
that reason is asserted to exist in the reality of fact: so what is said
to be greater than all other beings is understood and is in the
understanding, and therefore it is necessarily inferred that it exists
in reality.

<span id="vi.ii.V-p15"></span>You see, then, with how much justice you
have compared me with your fool, who, on the sole ground that he
understands what is described to him, would affirm that a lost island
exists.

<span id="vi.ii.V-p16"></span> <span id="vi.ii.VI"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.VI-p1"></span>

### <span id="vi.ii.VI-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER VI.

<span id="vi.ii.VI-p2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.VI-p3"></span>A discussion of Gaunilon’s argument in his
second chapter: that any unreal beings can be understood in the same
way, and would, to that extent, exist.

<span id="vi.ii.VI-p4"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.VI-p5"></span>ANOTHER of your objections is that any
unreal beings, or beings whose existence is uncertain, can be understood
and be in the understanding in the same way with that being which I
discussed. I am surprised that you should have conceived this objection,
for I was attempting to prove what was still uncertain, and contented
myself at first with showing that this being is understood in any way,
and is in the understanding. It was my intention to consider, on these
grounds, whether this being is in the understanding alone, like an
unreal object, or whether it also exists in fact, as a real being. For
if unreal objects, or objects whose existence is uncertain, in this way
are understood and are in the understanding, because, when they are
spoken of, the hearer understands what the speaker means, there is no
reason why that being of which I spoke should not be understood and be
in the understanding.

<span id="vi.ii.VI-p6"></span>How, moreover, can these two statements of
yours <span id="page_163">p. 163</span> <span
id="vi.ii.VI-Page_163"></span>be reconciled: (1) the assertion that if a
man should speak of any unreal objects, whatever they might be, you
would understand, and (2) the assertion that on hearing of that being
which does exist, and not in that way in which even unreal objects are
held in concept, you would not say that you conceive of it or have it in
concept; since, as you say, you cannot conceive of it in any other way
than by understanding it, that is, by comprehending in your knowledge
its real existence?

<span id="vi.ii.VI-p7"></span>How, I ask, can these two things be
reconciled: that unreal objects are understood, and that understanding
an object is comprehending in knowledge its real existence? The
contradiction does not concern me: do you see to it. But if unreal
objects are also in some sort understood, and your definition is
applicable, not to every understanding, but to a certain sort of
understanding, I ought not to be blamed for saying that a being than
which a greater cannot be conceived is understood and is in the
understanding, even before I reached the certain conclusion that this
being exists in reality.

<span id="vi.ii.VI-p8"></span> <span id="vi.ii.VII"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.VII-p1"></span>

### <span id="vi.ii.VII-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER VII.

<span id="vi.ii.VII-p2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.VII-p3"></span>In answer to another objection: that the
supremely great being may be conceived not to exist, just as by the fool
God is conceived not to exist.

<span id="vi.ii.VII-p4"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.VII-p5"></span>AGAIN, you say that it can probably never
be believed that this being, when it is spoken of and heard of, cannot
be conceived not to exist in the same way in which even God may be
conceived not to exist.

<span id="vi.ii.VII-p6"></span>Such an objection could be answered by
those who have attained but little skill in disputation and argument.
For is it compatible with reason for a man to <span id="page_164">p.
164</span> <span id="vi.ii.VII-Page_164"></span>deny the existence of
what he understands, because it is said to be that being whose existence
he denies because he does not understand it? Or, if at some times its
existence is denied, because only to a certain extent is it understood,
and that which is not at all understood is the same to him: is not what
is still undetermined more easily proved of a being which exists in some
understanding than of one which exists is no understanding?

<span id="vi.ii.VII-p7"></span>Hence it cannot be credible that any man
denies the existence of a being than which a greater cannot be
conceived, which, when he hears of it, he understands in a certain
degree: it is incredible, I say, that any man denies the existence of
this being because he denies the existence of God, the sensory
perception of whom he in no wise conceives of.

<span id="vi.ii.VII-p8"></span>Or if the existence of another object,
because it is not at all understood, is denied, yet is not the existence
of what is understood in some degree more easily proved than the
existence of an object which is in no wise understood?

<span id="vi.ii.VII-p9"></span>Not irrationally, then, has the
hypothesis of a being a greater than which cannot be conceived been
employed in controverting the fool, for the proof of the existence of
God: since in some degree he would understand such a being, but in no
wise could he understand God.

<span id="vi.ii.VII-p10"></span> <span id="vi.ii.VIII"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.VIII-p1"></span>

### <span id="vi.ii.VIII-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER VIII.

<span id="vi.ii.VIII-p2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.VIII-p3"></span>The example of the picture, treated in
Gaunilon’s third chapter, is examined. ‑‑ From what source a notion may
be formed of the supremely great being, of which Gaunilon inquired in
his fourth chapter.

<span id="vi.ii.VIII-p4"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.VIII-p5"></span>MOREOVER, your so careful demonstration
that the being than which a greater cannot be conceived is <span
id="page_165">p. 165</span> <span id="vi.ii.VIII-Page_165"></span>not
analogous to the not yet executed picture in the understanding of the
painter, is quite unnecessary. It was not for this purpose that I
suggested the preconceived picture. I had no thought of asserting that
the being which I was discussing is of such a nature; but I wished to
show that what is not understood to exist can be in the understanding.

<span id="vi.ii.VIII-p6"></span>Again, you say that when you hear of a
being than which a greater is inconceivable, you cannot conceive of it
in terms of any real object known to you either specifically or
generally, nor have it in your understanding. For, you say, you neither
know such a being in itself, nor can you form an idea of it from
anything like it.

<span id="vi.ii.VIII-p7"></span>But obviously this is not true. For
everything that is less good, in so far as it is good, is like the
greater good. It is therefore evident to any rational mind, that by
ascending from the lesser good to the greater, we can form a
considerable notion of a being than which a greater is inconceivable.

<span id="vi.ii.VIII-p8"></span>For instance, who (even if he does not
believe that what he conceives of exists in reality) supposing that
there is some good which has a beginning and an end, does not conceive
that a good is much better, which, if it begins, does not cease to be?
And that as the second good is better than the first, so that good which
has neither beginning nor end, though it is ever passing from the past
through the present to the future, is better than the second? And that
far better than this is a being ‑‑ whether any being of such a nature
exists or not ‑‑ which in no wise requires change or motion, nor is
compelled to undergo change or motion?

<span id="vi.ii.VIII-p9"></span>Is this inconceivable, or is some being
greater <span id="page_166">p. 166</span> <span
id="vi.ii.VIII-Page_166"></span>than this conceivable? Or is not this to
form a notion from objects than which a greater is conceivable, of the
being than which a greater cannot be conceived? There is, then, a means
of forming a notion of a being than which a greater is inconceivable.

<span id="vi.ii.VIII-p10"></span>So easily, then, can the fool who does
not accept sacred authority be refuted, if he denies that a notion may
be formed from other objects of a being than which a greater is
inconceivable. But if any Catholic would deny this, let him remember
that the invisible things of God, from the creation of the world, are
clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his
eternal power and Godhead. (<span id="vi.ii.VIII-p10.1"></span>[Romans

### <span id="vi.ii.IX-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER IX.

<span id="vi.ii.IX-p2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.IX-p3"></span>The possibility of understanding and
conceiving of the supremely great being. The argument advanced against
the fool is confirmed.

<span id="vi.ii.IX-p4"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.IX-p5"></span>BUT even if it were true that a being than
which a greater is inconceivable cannot be conceived or understood; yet
it would not be untrue that a being than which a greater cannot be
conceived is conceivable and intelligible. There is nothing to prevent
one’s saying *ineffable*, although what is said to be ineffable cannot
be spoken of. *Inconceivable* is conceivable, although that to which the
word *inconceivable* can be applied is not conceivable. So, when one
says, *that than which nothing greater is conceivable*, undoubtedly what
is heard is conceivable and intelligible, although that being itself,
than which a greater is inconceivable, cannot be conceived or
understood.

<span id="vi.ii.IX-p6"></span>Or, though there is a man so foolish as to
say that there is no being than which a greater is inconceivable, he
will not be so shameless as to say that he <span id="page_167">p.
167</span> <span id="vi.ii.IX-Page_167"></span>cannot understand or
conceive of what he says. Or, if such a man is found, not only ought his
words to be rejected, but he himself should be contemned.

<span id="vi.ii.IX-p7"></span>Whoever, then, denies the existence of a
being than which a greater cannot be conceived, at least understands and
conceives of the denial which he makes. But this denial he cannot
understand or conceive of without its component terms; and a term of
this statement is *a being than which a greater cannot be conceived*.
Whoever, then, makes this denial, understands and conceives of that than
which a greater is inconceivable.

<span id="vi.ii.IX-p8"></span>Moreover, it is evident that in the same
way it is possible to conceive of and understand a being whose
non‑existence is impossible; but he who conceives of this conceives of a
greater being than one whose nonexistence is possible. Hence, when a
being than which a greater is inconceivable is conceived, if it is a
being whose non‑existence is possible that is conceived, it is not a
being than which a greater cannot be conceived. But an object cannot be
at once conceived and not conceived. Hence he who conceives of a being
than which a greater is inconceivable, does not conceive of that whose
non‑existence is possible, but of that whose non‑existence is
impossible. Therefore, what he conceives of must exist; for anything
whose non‑existence is possible, is not that of which he conceives.

<span id="vi.ii.X-p1"></span>

### <span id="vi.ii.X-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER X.

<span id="vi.ii.X-p2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.X-p3"></span>The certainty of the foregoing argument. ‑‑
The conclusion of the book.

<span id="vi.ii.X-p4"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.X-p5"></span>I BELIEVE that I have shown by an argument
which is not weak, but sufficiently cogent, that in my former <span
id="page_168">p. 168</span> <span id="vi.ii.X-Page_168"></span>book I
proved the real existence of a being than which a greater cannot be
conceived; and I believe that this argument cannot be invalidated by the
validity of any objection. For so great force does the signification of
this reasoning contain in itself, that this being which is the subject
of discussion, is of necessity, from the very fact that it is understood
or conceived, proved also to exist in reality, and to be whatever we
should believe of the divine substance.

<span id="vi.ii.X-p6"></span>For we attribute to the divine substance
anything of which it can be conceived that it is better to be than not
to be that thing. For example: it is better to be eternal than not
eternal; good, than not good; nay, goodness itself, than not goodness
itself. But it cannot be that anything of this nature is not a property
of the being than which a greater is inconceivable. Hence, the being
than which a greater is inconceivable must be whatever should be
attributed to the divine essence.

<span id="vi.ii.X-p7"></span>I thank you for your kindness both in your
blame and in your praise for my book. For since you have commended so
generously those parts of it which seem to you worthy of acceptance, it
is quite evident that you have criticised in no unkind spirit those
parts of it which seemed to you weak.
