### <span id="v.LX-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LX.

<span id="v.LX-p2"></span>

<span id="v.LX-p3"></span>To none of these is another necessary that he
may remember, conceive, or love: since each taken by himself is memory
and intelligence and love and all that is necessarily inherent in the
supreme Being.

<span id="v.LX-p4"></span>

<span id="v.LX-p5"></span>BUT, while this discussion engages our
attention, I think that this truth, which occurs to me as I reflect,
ought to be most carefully commended to memory. The Father must be so
conceived of as memory, the Son as intelligence, and the Spirit as love,
that it <span id="page_120">p. 120</span> <span
id="v.LX-Page_120"></span>shall also be understood that the Father does
not need the Son, or the Spirit common to them, nor the Son the Father,
or the same Spirit, nor the Spirit the Father, or the Son: as if the
Father were able, through his own power, only to remember, but to
conceive only through the Son, and to love only through the Spirit of
himself and his son; and the Son could only conceive or understand
(*intelligere*) through himself, but remembered through the Father, and
loved through his Spirit; and this Spirit were able through himself
alone only to love, while the Father remembers for him, and the Son
conceives or understands (*intelligit*) for him.

<span id="v.LX-p6"></span>For, since among these three each one taken
separately is so perfectly the supreme Being and the supreme Wisdom that
through himself he remembers and conceives and loves, it must be that
none of these three needs another, in order either to remember or to
conceive or to love. For, each taken separately is essentially memory
and intelligence and love, and all that is necessarily inherent in the
supreme Being.
