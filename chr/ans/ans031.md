### <span id="iv.XXV-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER XXV.

<span id="iv.XXV-p1"></span>

<span id="iv.XXV-p2"></span>What goods and how great, belong to those
who enjoy this good. ‑‑Joy is multiplied in the blessed from the
blessedness and joy of others.

<span id="iv.XXV-p3"></span>

<span id="iv.XXV-p4"></span>WHO shall enjoy this good? And what shall
belong to him, and what shall not belong to him? At any rate, whatever
he shall wish shall be his, and whatever he shall not wish shall not be
his. For, these goods of body and soul will be such as eye hath not seen
nor ear heard, neither has the heart of man conceived (<span
id="iv.XXV-p4.1"></span>[Isa. 64:4](../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004.md), [1
Cor. 2:9](../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009)<span id="iv.XXV-p4.1"></span>.md).

<span id="iv.XXV-p5"></span>Why, then, dost thou wander abroad, slight
man, in thy search for the goods of thy soul and thy body? Love the one
good in which are all goods, and it sufficeth. Desire the simple good
which is every good, and it is enough. For, what dost thou love, my
flesh? What dost thou desire, my soul? There, there is whatever ye love,
whatever ye desire.

<span id="iv.XXV-p6"></span>If beauty delights thee, there shall the
righteous shine forth as the sun (<span id="iv.XXV-p6.1"></span>[Matthew
13:43](../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#043)<span id="iv.XXV-p6.1"></span>.md). If
swiftness or endurance, or freedom of body, which naught can withstand,
delight thee, they shall be as angels of God, ‑‑because it is sown a
natural body; it is raised a spiritual body (<span
id="iv.XXV-p6.2"></span>[1 Corinthians
15:44](../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044)<span id="iv.XXV-p6.2"></span>.md) ‑‑in
power certainly, though not in nature. If it is a long and sound life
that pleases thee, there a healthful eternity is, and an eternal health.
For the righteous shall live for ever (<span
id="iv.XXV-p6.3"></span>[Wisdom 5:15](../../bib/apo/wis005.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.XXV-p6.3"></span>), and the salvation of the righteous is of the
Lord (<span id="iv.XXV-p6.4"></span>[Psalms
37:39](../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#039)<span id="iv.XXV-p6.4"></span>.md). If
it is satisfaction of hunger, they shall be satisfied when the glory of
the Lord hath appeared (<span id="iv.XXV-p6.5"></span>[Psalms
17:15](../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015)<span id="iv.XXV-p6.5"></span>.md). If
it is quenching of thirst, they shall be abundantly <span
id="page_30">p. 30</span> <span id="iv.XXV-Page_30"></span>satisfied
with the fatness of thy house (<span id="iv.XXV-p6.6"></span>[Psalms
36:8](../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008)<span id="iv.XXV-p6.6"></span>.md). If
it is melody, there the choirs of angels sing forever, before God. If it
is any not impure, but pure, pleasure, thou shalt make them drink of the
river of thy pleasures, O God (<span id="iv.XXV-p6.7"></span>[Psalms
36:8](../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008)<span id="iv.XXV-p6.7"></span>.md).

<span id="iv.XXV-p7"></span>If it is wisdom that delights thee, the very
wisdom of God will reveal itself to them. If friendship, they shall love
God more than themselves, and one another as themselves. And God shall
love them more than they themselves; for they love him, and themselves,
and one another, through him, and he, himself and them, through himself.
If concord, they shall all have a single will.

<span id="iv.XXV-p8"></span>If power, they shall have all power to
fulfil their will, as God to fulfil his. For, as God will have power to
do what he wills, through himself, so they will have power, through him,
to do what they will. For, as they will not will aught else than he, he
shall will whatever they will; and what he shall will cannot fail to be.
If honor and riches, God shall make his good and faithful servants
rulers over many things <span id="iv.XXV-p8.1"></span>[Luke
12:42](../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#042.md)<span id="iv.XXV-p8.1"></span>; nay,
they shall be called sons of God, and gods; and where his Son shall be,
there they shall be also, heirs indeed of God, and joint‑heirs with
Christ (<span id="iv.XXV-p8.2"></span>[Romans
8:17](../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017)<span id="iv.XXV-p8.2"></span>.md).

<span id="iv.XXV-p9"></span>If true security delights thee, undoubtedly
they shall be as sure that those goods, or rather that good, will never
and in no wise fail them; as they shall be sure that they will not lose
it of their own accord; and that God, who loves them, will not take it
away from those who love him against their will; and that nothing more
powerful than God will separate him from them against his will and
theirs.

<span id="iv.XXV-p10"></span>But what, or how great, is the joy, where
such and <span id="page_31">p. 31</span> <span
id="iv.XXV-Page_31"></span>so great is the good! Heart of man, needy
heart, heart acquainted with sorrows, nay, overwhelmed with sorrows, how
greatly wouldst thou rejoice, if thou didst abound in all these things!
Ask thy inmost mind whether it could contain its joy over so great a
blessedness of its own.

<span id="iv.XXV-p11"></span>Yet assuredly, if any other whom thou didst
love altogether as thyself possessed the same blessedness, thy joy would
be doubled, because thou wouldst rejoice not less for him than for
thyself. But, if two, or three, or many more, had the same joy, thou
wouldst rejoice as much for each one as for thyself, if thou didst love
each as thyself. Hence, in that perfect love of innumerable blessed
angels and sainted men, where none shall love another less than himself,
every one shall rejoice for each of the others as for himself.

<span id="iv.XXV-p12"></span>If, then, the heart of man will scarce
contain his joy over his own so great good, how shall it contain so many
and so great joys? And doubtless, seeing that every one loves another so
far as he rejoices in the other’s good, and as, in that perfect
felicity, each one should love God beyond compare, more than himself and
all the others with him; so he will rejoice beyond reckoning in the
felicity of God, more than in his own and that of all the others with
him.

<span id="iv.XXV-p13"></span>But if they shall so love God with all
their heart, and all their mind, and all their soul, that still all the
heart, and all the mind, and all the soul shall not suffice for the
worthiness of this love; doubtless they will so rejoice with all their
heart, and all their mind, and all their soul, that all the heart, and
all the mind, and all the soul shall not suffice for the fulness of
their joy.
