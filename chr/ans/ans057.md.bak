### <span id="v.XXIV-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER XXIV.

<span id="v.XXIV-p1"></span>

<span id="v.XXIV-p2"></span>How it is better understood to exist <span
id="v.XXIV-p2.1"></span>always than at <span
id="v.XXIV-p2.2"></span>every time.

<span id="v.XXIV-p3"></span>

<span id="v.XXIV-p4"></span>IT is also evident that this supreme
Substance is without beginning and without end; that it has neither
<span id="page_82">p. 82</span> <span id="v.XXIV-Page_82"></span>past,
nor future, nor the temporal, that is, transient present in which we
live; since its age, or eternity, which is nothing else than itself, is
immutable and without parts. Is not, therefore, the term which seems to
mean *all time* more properly understood, when applied to this
Substance, to signify eternity, which is never unlike itself, rather
than a changing succession of times, which is ever in some sort unlike
itself?

<span id="v.XXIV-p5"></span>Hence, if this Being is said to exist
always; since, for it, it is the same to exist and to live, no better
sense can be attached to this statement, than that it exists or lives
eternally, that is, it possesses interminable life, as a perfect whole
at once. For its eternity apparently is an interminable life, existing
at once as a perfect whole.

<span id="v.XXIV-p6"></span>For, since it has already been shown that
this Substance is nothing else than its own life and its own eternity,
is in no wise terminable, and does not exist, except as at once and
perfectly whole, what else is true eternity, which is consistent with
the nature of that Substance alone, than an interminable life, existing
as at once and perfectly whole?

<span id="v.XXIV-p7"></span>For this truth is, at any rate, clearly
perceived from the single fact that true eternity belongs only to that
substance which alone, as we have proved, was not created, but is the
creator, since true eternity is conceived to be free from the
limitations of beginning and end; and this is proved to be consistent
with the nature of no created being, from the very fact that all such
have been created from nothing.
