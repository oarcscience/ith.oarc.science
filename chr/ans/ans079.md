### <span id="v.XLVI-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER XLVI.

<span id="v.XLVI-p2"></span>

<span id="v.XLVI-p3"></span>How some of these truths which are thus
expounded may also be conceived of in another way.

<span id="v.XLVI-p4"></span>

<span id="v.XLVI-p5"></span>YET, some of these truths, which may be thus
expounded and conceived of, are apparently capable of another
interpretation as well, not inconsistent with this same assertion. For
it is proved that the Son is the true Word, that is, the perfect
intelligence, conceiving of the whole substance of the Father, or
perfect cognition of that substance, and knowledge of it, and wisdom
regarding it; that is, it understands, and conceives of, the very
essence of the Father, and cognises it, and knows it, and is wise
(*sapit*) regarding it.

<span id="v.XLVI-p6"></span>If, then, in this sense, the Son is called
the intelligence of the Father, and wisdom concerning him, and knowledge
and cognition of him, and acquaintance with him; since the Son
understands and conceives of the Father, is wise concerning him, knows
and is acquainted with him, there is no departure from truth.

<span id="v.XLVI-p7"></span>Most properly, too, may the Son be called
the truth of the Father, not only in the sense that the truth of the Son
is the same with that of the Father, as we have already seen; but in
this sense, also, that in him no imperfect imitation shall be conceived
of, but the complete truth of the substance of the Father since he is no
other than what the Father is.
