### <span id="v.LXXVI-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LXXVI.

<span id="v.LXXVI-p2"></span>

<span id="v.LXXVI-p3"></span>We should believe in Father and Son and in
their Spirit equally, and in each separately, and in the three at once.

<span id="v.LXXVI-p4"></span>

<span id="v.LXXVI-p5"></span>WE should believe, then, equally in the
Father and in the Son and in their Spirit, and in each separately, and
in the three at once, since the Father separately, and the Son
separately, and their Spirit separately is the supreme Being, and at
once Father and Son with their Spirit are one and the same supreme
Being, in which alone every man ought to believe; because it is the sole
end which in every thought and act he ought to strive for. Hence, it is
manifest that as none is able to strive for that Being, except he
believe<span id="page_139">p. 139</span> <span
id="v.LXXVI-Page_139"></span> in it; so to believe it avails none,
except he strive for it.
