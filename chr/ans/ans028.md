### <span id="iv.XXII-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER XXII.

<span id="iv.XXII-p2"></span>

<span id="iv.XXII-p3"></span>He alone is what he is and who be is. ‑‑All
things need God for their being and their well‑being.

<span id="iv.XXII-p4"></span>

<span id="iv.XXII-p5"></span>THEREFORE, thou alone, O Lord, art what
thou art; and thou art he who thou art. For, what is one thing in the
whole and another in the parts, and in which there is any mutable
element, is not altogether what it is. And what begins from
non‑existence, and can be conceived not to exist, and unless it subsists
through something else, returns to non‑existence; and what has a past
existence, which is no longer, or a future existence, which is not yet,
‑‑this does not properly and absolutely exist.

<span id="iv.XXII-p6"></span>But thou art what thou art, because,
whatever thou art at any time, or in any way, thou art as a whole and
forever. And thou art he who thou art, properly and simply; for thou
hast neither a past existence <span id="page_27">p. 27</span> <span
id="iv.XXII-Page_27"></span>nor a future, but only a present existence;
nor canst thou be conceived as at any time non‑existent. But thou art
life, and light, and wisdom, and blessedness, and many goods of this
nature. And yet thou art only one supreme good; thou art all‑sufficient
to thyself, and needest none; and thou art he whom all things need for
their existence and wellbeing.
