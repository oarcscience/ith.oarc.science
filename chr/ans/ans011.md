### <span id="iv.V-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER V.

<span id="iv.V-p2"></span>

<span id="iv.V-p3"></span>God is whatever it is better to be than not to
be; and he, as the only self‑existent being, creates all things from
nothing.

<span id="iv.V-p4"></span>

<span id="iv.V-p5"></span>WHAT art thou, then, Lord God, than whom
nothing greater can be conceived? But what art thou, except that which,
as the highest of all beings, alone exists through itself, and creates
all other things from nothing? For, whatever is not this is less than a
thing which can be conceived of. But this cannot be conceived <span
id="page_10">p. 10</span> <span id="iv.V-Page_10"></span>of thee. What
good, therefore, does the supreme Good lack, through which every good
is? Therefore, thou art just, truthful, blessed, and whatever it is
better to be than not to be. For it is better to be just than not just;
better to be blessed than not blessed.
