### <span id="v.IX-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER IX.

<span id="v.IX-p1"></span>

<span id="v.IX-p2"></span>Those things which were created from nothing
had an existence before their creation in the thought of the Creator.

<span id="v.IX-p3"></span>

<span id="v.IX-p4"></span>BUT I seem to see a truth that compels me to
distinguish carefully in what sense those things which were created may
be said to have been nothing before their creation. For, in no wise can
anything conceivably be created by any, unless there is, in the mind of
the creative agent, some example, as it were, or (as is more fittingly
supposed) some model, or likeness<span id="page_55">p. 55</span> <span
id="v.IX-Page_55"></span>, or rule. It is evident, then, that before the
world was created, it was in the thought of the supreme Nature, what,
and of what sort, and how, it should be. Hence, although it is clear
that the being that were created were nothing before their creation, to
this extent, that they were not what they now are, nor was there
anything whence they should be created, yet they were not nothing, so
far as the creator’s thought is concerned, through which, and according
to which, they were created.
