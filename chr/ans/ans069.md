### <span id="v.XXXVI-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER XXXVI.

<span id="v.XXXVI-p2"></span>

<span id="v.XXXVI-p3"></span>In how incomprehensible a way he expresses
or knows the objects created by him.

<span id="v.XXXVI-p4"></span>

<span id="v.XXXVI-p5"></span>HENCE, it may be most clearly comprehended
that how this Spirit expresses, or how he knows the created world,
cannot be comprehended by human knowledge. For none can doubt that
created substances exist far differently in themselves than in our
knowledge. For, in themselves they exist by virtue of their own being;
while in our knowledge is not their being, but their likeness.

<span id="v.XXXVI-p6"></span>We conclude, then, that they exist more
truly in themselves than in our knowledge, in the same degree <span
id="page_98">p. 98</span> <span id="v.XXXVI-Page_98"></span>in which
they exist more truly anywhere by virtue of their own being, than by
virtue of their likeness. Therefore, since this is also an established
truth, that every created substance exists more truly in the Word, that
is, in the intelligence of the Creator, than it does in itself, in the
same degree in which the creative being exists more truly than the
created; how can the human mind comprehend of what kind is that
expression and that knowledge, which is so much higher and truer than
created substances; if our knowledge is as far surpassed by those
substances as their likeness is removed from their being?
