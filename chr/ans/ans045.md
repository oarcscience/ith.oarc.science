### <span id="v.XII-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER XII.

<span id="v.XII-p1"></span>

<span id="v.XII-p2"></span>This expression of the supreme Being is the
supreme Being.

<span id="v.XII-p3"></span>

<span id="v.XII-p4"></span>BUT since, as our reasoning shows, it is
equally certain that whatever the supreme Substance created, it created
through nothing other than itself; and whatever it created, it created
through its own most intimate expression, whether separately, by the
utterance of separate words, or all at once, by the utterance of one
word; what conclusion can be more evidently necessary, than that this
expression of the supreme Being is no other than the supreme Being?
Therefore, the consideration of this expression should not, in my
opinion, be carelessly passed over. But before it can be discussed, I
think some of the properties <span id="page_59">p. 59</span> <span
id="v.XII-Page_59"></span>of this supreme Substance should be diligently
and earnestly investigated.
