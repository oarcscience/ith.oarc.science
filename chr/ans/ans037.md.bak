### <span id="v.IV-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER IV.

<span id="v.IV-p1"></span>

<span id="v.IV-p2"></span>The same subject continued.

<span id="v.IV-p3"></span>

<span id="v.IV-p4"></span>FURTHERMORE, if one observes the nature of
things he perceives, whether he will or no, that not all are embraced in
a single degree of dignity; but that certain among them are
distinguished by inequality of degree. For, he who doubts that the horse
is superior in its nature to wood, and man more excellent than the
horse, assuredly does not deserve the name of man. Therefore, although
it cannot be denied that some natures are superior to others,
nevertheless reason convinces us that some nature is so preeminent among
these, that it has no superior. For, if the distinction of degrees is
infinite, so that there is among them no degree, than which no higher
can be found, our course of reasoning reaches this conclusion: that the
multitude of natures themselves is not limited by any bounds. But only
an absurdly foolish man can fail to regard such a conclusion as absurdly
foolish. There is, then, necessarily some nature which is so superior to
some nature or natures, that there is none in comparison with which it
is ranked as inferior.

<span id="v.IV-p5"></span>Now, this nature which is such, either is
single, or there are more natures than one of this sort, and they are of
equal degree.

<span id="v.IV-p6"></span>But, if they are more than one and equal,
since they cannot be equal through any diverse causes, but only through
some cause which is one and the same, that one cause, through which they
are equally so <span id="page_43">p. 43</span> <span
id="v.IV-Page_43"></span>great, either is itself what they are, that is,
the very essence of these natures; or else it is another than what they
are.

<span id="v.IV-p7"></span>But if it is nothing else than their very
essence itself, just as they have not more than one essence, but a
single essence, so they have not more than one nature, but a single
nature. For I here understand *nature* as identical with *essence.*

<span id="v.IV-p8"></span>If, however, that through which these natures
are so great is another than that which they are, then, certainly, they
are less than that through which they are so great. For, whatever is
great through something else is less than that through which it is
great. Therefore, they are not so great that there is nothing else
greater than they.

<span id="v.IV-p9"></span>But if, neither through what they are nor
through anything other than themselves, can there be more such natures
than one, than which nothing else shall be more excellent, then in no
wise can there be more than one nature of this kind. We conclude, then,
that there is some nature which is one and single, and which is so
superior to others that it is inferior to none. But that which is such
is the greatest and best of all existing beings. Hence, there is a
certain nature which is the highest of all existing beings. This,
however, it cannot be, unless it is what it is through itself, and all
existing beings are what they are through it.

<span id="v.IV-p10"></span>For since, as our reasoning showed us not
long since, that which exists through itself, and through which all
other things exist, is the highest of all existing beings; either
conversely, that which is the highest exists through itself, and all
others through it; or, there will be more than one supreme being. But it
<span id="page_44">p. 44</span> <span id="v.IV-Page_44"></span>is
manifest that there cannot be more than one supreme being. There is,
therefore, a certain Nature, or Substance, or Essence, which is through
itself good and great, and through itself is what it is; and through
which exists whatever is truly good, or great, or has any existence at
all; and which is the supreme good being, the supreme great being, being
or subsisting as supreme, that is, the highest of all existing beings.
