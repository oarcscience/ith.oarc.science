### <span id="v.LXII-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LXII.

<span id="v.LXII-p2"></span>

<span id="v.LXII-p3"></span>How it seems that of these three more sons
than one are born.

<span id="v.LXII-p4"></span>

<span id="v.LXII-p5"></span>BUT perhaps the following observation will
prove inconsistent with this assertion. It should not be doubted that
the Father and the Son and their Spirit each expresses himself and the
other <span id="page_122">p. 122</span> <span
id="v.LXII-Page_122"></span>two, just as each conceives of, and
understands, himself and the other two. But, if this is true, are there
not in the supreme Being as many words as there are expressive beings,
and as many words as there are beings who are expressed?

<span id="v.LXII-p6"></span>For, if more men than one give expression to
some one object in thought, apparently there are as many words
corresponding to that object as there are thinkers; since the word
corresponding to it exists in the thoughts of each separately. Again, if
one man thinks of more objects than one, there are as many words in the
mind of the thinker as there are objects thought of.

<span id="v.LXII-p7"></span>But in the thought of a man, when he thinks
of anything outside his own mind, the word corresponding to the object
thought of is not born of the object itself, since that is absent from
the view of thought, but of some likeness or image of the object which
exists in the memory of the thinker, or which is perhaps called to mind
through a corporeal sense from the present object itself.

<span id="v.LXII-p8"></span>But in the supreme Being, Father and Son and
their Spirit are always so present to one another ‑‑for each one, as we
have already seen, exists in the others no less than in himself ‑‑ that,
when they express one another, the one that is expressed seems to beget
his own word, just as when he is expressed by himself. How is it, then,
that the Son and the Spirit of the Son and of the Father beget nothing,
if each begets his own word, when he is expressed by himself or by
another? Apparently as many words as can be proved to be born of the
supreme Substance, so many Sons, according to our former reasoning, must
there be begotten of this substance, and so many spirits proceeding from
it.
