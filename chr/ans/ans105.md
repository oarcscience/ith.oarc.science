### <span id="v.LXXII-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LXXII.

<span id="v.LXXII-p2"></span>

<span id="v.LXXII-p3"></span>Every human soul is immortal. And it is
either forever miserable, or at some time truly blessed.

<span id="v.LXXII-p4"></span>

<span id="v.LXXII-p5"></span>BUT if the soul is mortal, of course the
loving soul is not eternally blessed, nor the soul that scorns this
Being eternally miserable. Whether, therefore, it loves or scorns that
for the love of which it was created, it must be immortal. But if there
are some rational souls which are to be judged as neither loving nor
scorning, such as the souls of infants seem to be, what opinion shall be
held regarding these? Are they mortal or immortal? But undoubtedly all
human souls are of the same nature. Hence, since it is established that
some are immortal, every human soul must be immortal. But since every
living being is either never, or at some time, truly secure from all
trouble; necessarily, also, every human soul is either ever miserable,
or at some time truly blessed.
