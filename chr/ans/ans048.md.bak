<span id="v.XV"></span>

### <span id="v.XV-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER XV.

<span id="v.XV-p1"></span>

<span id="v.XV-p2"></span>What can or cannot be stated concerning the
substance of this Being.

<span id="v.XV-p3"></span>

<span id="v.XV-p4"></span>NOT without reason I am now strongly impelled
to inquire as earnestly as I am able, which of all the statements that
may be made regarding anything is substantially applicable to this so
wonderful Nature. For, though I should be surprised if, among the names
or words by which we designate things created from nothing, any should
be found that could worthily be applied to the Substance which is the
creator of all; yet, we must try and see to what end reason will lead
this investigation.

<span id="v.XV-p5"></span>As to relative expressions, at any rate, no
one can doubt that no such expression describes what is essential to
that in regard to which it is relatively employed. Hence, if any
relative predication is made regarding the supreme Nature, it is not
significant of its substance.

<span id="v.XV-p6"></span>Therefore, it is manifest that this very
expression, that this Nature, is the *highest* of all beings, or
*greater* than those which have been created by it; or any <span
id="page_61">p. 61</span> <span id="v.XV-Page_61"></span>other relative
term that can, in like manner, be applied to it, does not describe its
natural essence.

<span id="v.XV-p7"></span>For, if none of those things ever existed, in
relation to which it is called *supreme* or *greater*, it would not be
conceived as either *supreme* or *greater*, yet it would not, therefore,
be less good, or suffer detriment to its essential greatness in any
degree. And this truth is clearly seen from the fact that this Nature
exists through no other than itself, whatever there be that is good or
great. If, then, the supreme Nature can be so conceived of as not
supreme, that still it shall be in no wise greater or less than when it
is conceived of as the highest of all beings, it is manifest that the
term *supreme*, taken by itself, does not describe that Being which is
altogether greater and better than whatever is not what it is. But, what
these considerations show regarding the term *supreme* or *highest* is
found to be true, in like manner, of other similar, relative
expressions.

<span id="v.XV-p8"></span>Passing over these relative predications,
then, since none of them taken by itself represents the essence of
anything, let our attention be turned to the discussion of other kinds
of predication.

<span id="v.XV-p9"></span>Now, certainly if one diligently considers
separately whatever there is that is not of a relative nature, either it
is such that, *to be it* is in general better than *not to be it*, or
such that, in some cases, *not to be it* is better than *to be it*. But
I here understand the phrases, *to be it* and *not to be it*, in the
same way in which I understand *to be true* and *not to be true*, *to be
bodily* and *not to be bodily*, and the like. Indeed, to be anything is,
in general, better than not to be it; as *to be wise* is better than
*not to be so*; that is, it is better to be wise than not to be wise.
For, though one who <span id="page_62">p. 62</span> <span
id="v.XV-Page_62"></span>is just, but not wise, is apparently a better
man than one who is wise, but not just, yet, taken by itself, it is not
better *not to be wise* than *to be wise*. For, everything that is not
wise, simply in so far as it is not wise, is less than what is wise,
since everything that is not wise would be better if it were wise. In
the same way, *to be true* is altogether better than *not to be so*,
that is, better than *not to be true*; and *just* is better than *not
just*; and *to live* than *not to live*.

<span id="v.XV-p10"></span>But, in some cases, *not to be* a certain
thing is better than *to be it*, as *not to be gold* may be better than
*to be gold*. For it is better for man not to be gold, than to be gold;
although it might be better for something to be gold, than not to be
gold ‑‑ lead, for instance. For though both, namely, man and lead are
not gold, man is something as much better than gold, as he would be of
inferior nature, were he gold; while lead is something as much more base
than gold, as it would be more precious, were it gold.

<span id="v.XV-p11"></span>But, from the fact that the supreme Nature
may be so conceived of as not supreme, that *supreme* is neither in
general better than *not supreme*, nor *not supreme* better, in any
case, than *supreme* ‑‑from this fact it is evident that there are many
relative expressions which are by no means included in this
classification. Whether, however, any are so included, I refrain from
inquiring; since it is sufficient, for my purpose, that undoubtedly none
of these, taken by itself, describes the substance of the supreme
Nature.

<span id="v.XV-p12"></span>Since, then, it is true of whatever else
there is, that, if it is taken independently, *to be it* is better than
*not to be it*; as it is impious to suppose that the substance of the
supreme Nature is anything, than which what is not it is in any way
better, it must be true that <span id="page_63">p. 63</span> <span
id="v.XV-Page_63"></span>this substance is whatever is, in general,
better than what is not it. For, it alone is that, than which there is
nothing better at all, and which is better than all things, which are
not what it is.

<span id="v.XV-p13"></span>It is not a material body, then, or any of
those things which the bodily senses discern. For, then all these there
is something better, which is not what they themselves are. For, the
rational mind, as to which no bodily sense can perceive what, or of what
character, or how great, it is ‑‑the less this rational mind would be if
it were any of those things that are in the scope of the bodily senses,
the greater it is than any of these. For by no means should this supreme
Being be said to be any of those things to which something, which they
themselves are not, is superior; and it should by all means, as our
reasoning shows, be said to be any of those things to which everything,
which is not what they themselves are, is inferior.

<span id="v.XV-p14"></span>Hence, this Being must be living, wise,
powerful, and all‑powerful, true, just, blessed, eternal, and whatever,
in like manner, is absolutely better than what is not it. Why, then,
should we make any further inquiry as to what that supreme Nature is, if
it is manifest which of all things it is, and which it is not?
