### <span id="v.LIV-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LIV.

<span id="v.LIV-p2"></span>

<span id="v.LIV-p3"></span>It proceeds as a whole from the Father, and
as a whole from the Son, and yet does not exist except as <span
id="v.LIV-p3.1"></span>one love.

<span id="v.LIV-p4"></span>

<span id="v.LIV-p5"></span>IT should be carefully considered whether
there are two loves, one proceeding from the Father, the other from the
Son; or one, not proceeding as a whole from one, but in part from the
Father, in part from the Son; or neither more than one, nor one
proceeding in part from each separately, but one proceeding as a whole
from each separately, and likewise as a whole from the two at once.

<span id="v.LIV-p6"></span>But the solution of such a question can,
without doubt, be apprehended from the fact that this love proceeds not
from that in which Father and Son are more than one, but from that in
which they are one. For, not from their relations, which are more than
one, but from their essence itself, which does not admit of plurality,
do Father and Son equally produce so great a good.

<span id="v.LIV-p7"></span>Therefore, as the Father separately is the
supreme Spirit, and the Son separately is the supreme Spirit, and Father
and Son at once are not two, but one Spirit; so from the Father
separately the love of the supreme Spirit emanates as a whole, and from
the Son as a whole, and at once from Father and Son, not as two, but as
one and the same whole.
