### <span id="v.II-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER II.

<span id="v.II-p1"></span>

<span id="v.II-p2"></span>The same subject continued.

<span id="v.II-p4"></span>BUT, just as it has been proved that there is
a being that is supremely good, since all goods are good through a
single being, which is good through itself; so it is necessarily
inferred that there is something supremely great, which is great through
itself. But, I do not mean physically great, as a material object is
great, but that which, the greater it is, is the better or the more
worthy, ‑‑wisdom, for instance. And <span id="page_40">p. 40</span>
<span id="v.II-Page_40"></span>since there can be nothing supremely
great except what is supremely good, there must be a being that is
greatest and best, i. e., the highest of all existing beings.
