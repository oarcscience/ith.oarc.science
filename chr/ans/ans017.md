### <span id="iv.XI-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER XI.

<span id="iv.XI-p1"></span>

<span id="iv.XI-p2"></span>How all the ways of God are compassion and
truth; and yet God is just in all his ways. ‑‑We cannot comprehend why,
of the wicked, he saves these rather than those, through his supreme
goodness: and condemns those rather than these, through his supreme
justice.

<span id="iv.XI-p3"></span>

<span id="iv.XI-p4"></span>BUT, is there any reason why it is not also
just, according to thy nature, O Lord, that thou shouldst punish the
wicked? Surely it is just that thou shouldst be so just that thou canst
not be conceived more just; and this thou wouldst in no wise be if thou
didst only render goods to the good, and not evils to the evil. For, he
who requiteth both good and evil according to their deserts is more just
than he who so requites the good alone. It is, therefore, just,
according to thy nature, O just and gracious God, both when thou dost
punish and when thou sparest.

<span id="iv.XI-p5"></span>Truly, then, all the paths of the Lord are
mercy and truth (<span id="iv.XI-p5.1"></span>[Psalms
25:10](../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#010)<span id="iv.XI-p5.1"></span>); and
yet the Lord is righteous in all his ways (<span
id="iv.XI-p5.2"></span>[Psalms
145:17](../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#017)<span id="iv.XI-p5.2"></span>). And
assuredly without inconsistency: For, it is not just that those whom
thou dost will to punish should be saved, and that those whom thou dost
will to spare should be condemned. For that alone is just which thou
dost will; and that alone unjust which thou dost not will. So, then, thy
compassion is born of thy justice.

<span id="iv.XI-p6"></span>For it is just that thou shouldst be so good
that thou art good in sparing also; and this may be the reason why the
supremely Just can will goods for the evil. But if it can be
comprehended in any way why thou canst will to save the wicked, yet by
no consideration can we comprehend why, of those who are <span
id="page_18">p. 18</span> <span id="iv.XI-Page_18"></span>alike wicked,
thou savest some rather than others, through supreme goodness; and why
thou dost condemn the latter rather than the former, through supreme
justice.

<span id="iv.XI-p7"></span>So, then, thou art truly sensible
(*sensibilis*), omnipotent, compassionate, and passionless, as thou art
living, wise, good, blessed, eternal: and whatever it is better to be
than not to be.

<span id="iv.XI-p8"></span>
