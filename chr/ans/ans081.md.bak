### <span id="v.XLVIII-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER XLVIII.

<span id="v.XLVIII-p2"></span>

<span id="v.XLVIII-p3"></span>How the Son is the intelligence or wisdom
of memory or the memory of the Father and of memory.

<span id="v.XLVIII-p4"></span>

<span id="v.XLVIII-p5"></span>BUT what is to be our notion of memory? Is
the Son to be regarded as the intelligence conceiving of memory, or as
the memory of the Father, or as the memory of memory? Indeed, since it
cannot be denied that the supreme Wisdom remembers itself, nothing can
be more consistent than to regard the Father as memory, just as the Son
is the Word; because the Word is apparently born of memory, a fact that
is more clearly seen in the case of the human mind.

<span id="v.XLVIII-p6"></span>For, since the human mind is not always
thinking of itself, though it ever remembers itself, it is clear that,
when it thinks of itself, the word corresponding to it is born of
memory. Hence, it appears that, if it always thought of itself, its word
would be always born of memory. For, to think of an object of which we
have remembrance, this is to express it mentally; while the word
corresponding to the object is the thought itself, formed after the
likeness of that object from memory.

<span id="v.XLVIII-p7"></span>Hence, it may be clearly apprehended in
the supreme Wisdom, which always thinks of itself, just as it remembers
itself, that, of the eternal remembrance of it, its coeternal Word is
born. Therefore, as the Word is properly conceived of as the child, the
memory <span id="page_111">p. 111</span> <span
id="v.XLVIII-Page_111"></span>most appropriately takes the name of
parent. If, then, the child which is born of the supreme Spirit alone is
the child of his memory, there can be no more logical conclusion than
that his memory is himself. For not in respect of the fact that he
remembers himself does he exist in his own memory, like ideas that exist
in the human memory, without being the memory itself; but he so
remembers himself that he is his own memory.

<span id="v.XLVIII-p8"></span>It therefore follows that, just as the Son
is the intelligence or wisdom of the Father, so he is that of the memory
of the Father. But, regarding whatever the Son has wisdom or
understanding, this he likewise remembers. The Son is, therefore, the
memory of the Father, and the memory of memory, that is, the memory that
remembers the Father, who is memory, just as he is the wisdom of the
Father, and the wisdom of wisdom, that is, the wisdom wise regarding the
wisdom of the Father; and the Son is indeed memory, born of memory, as
he is wisdom, born of wisdom, while the Father is memory and wisdom born
of none.
