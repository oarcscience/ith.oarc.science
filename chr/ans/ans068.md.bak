### <span id="v.XXXV-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER XXXV.

<span id="v.XXXV-p2"></span>

<span id="v.XXXV-p3"></span>Whatever has been created is in his Word and
knowledge, life and truth.

<span id="v.XXXV-p4"></span>

<span id="v.XXXV-p5"></span>BUT, since it is established that his word
is consubstantial with him, and perfectly like him, it necessarily
follows that all things that exist in him exist also, and in the same
way, in his Word. Whatever has been created, then, whether alive or not
alive, or howsoever it exists in itself, is very life and truth in him.

<span id="v.XXXV-p6"></span>But, since knowing is the same to the
supreme Spirit as conceiving or expressing, he must know all things that
he knows in the same way in which he expresses or conceives of them.
Therefore, just as all things are in his Word life and truth, so are
they in his knowledge.
