<p><a name="v.XLIX-p5"></A>BUT, while I am here considering with interest the individual properties and the common attributes of Father and Son, I find none in them more pleasurable to contemplate than the feeling of mutual love.

The supreme Spirit, then, loves himself, just as he remembers himself and conceives of himself.</p>
