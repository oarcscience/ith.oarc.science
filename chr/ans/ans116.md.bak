<span id="viii.i"></span>

## <span id="viii.i-p0.1"></span>PREFACE.

<span id="viii.i-p1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p2"></span>THE first part of this book was copied
without my knowledge, before the work had been completed and revised. I
have therefore been obliged to finish it as best I could, more
hurriedly, and so more briefly, than I wished. For had an undisturbed
and adequate period been allowed me for publishing it, I should have
introduced and subjoined many things about which I have been silent. For
it was while suffering under great anguish of heart, the origin and
reason of which are known to God, that, at the entreaty of others, I
began the book in England, and finished it when an exile in Capra. From
the theme on which it was published I have called it *Cur Deus Homo*,
and have divided it into two short books. The first contains the
objections of infidels, who despise the Christian faith because they
deem it contrary to reason; and also the reply of believers; and, in
fine, leaving Christ out of view (as if nothing had ever been known of
him), it proves, by absolute reasons, the impossibility that any man
should be saved without him. Again, in the second book, likewise, as if
nothing were known of Christ, it is moreover shown by plain reasoning
and fact that human nature was ordained for this purpose, viz., that
every man should enjoy a happy immortality, both in body and in soul;
and <span id="page_176">p. 176</span> <span
id="viii.i-Page_176"></span>that it was necessary that this design for
which man was made should be fulfilled; but that it could not be
fulfilled unless God became man, and unless all things were to take
place which we hold with regard to Christ. I request all who may wish to
copy this book to prefix this brief preface, with the heads of the whole
work, at its commencement; so that, into whosesoever hands it may fall,
as he looks on the face of it, there may be nothing in the whole body of
the work which shall escape his notice.
