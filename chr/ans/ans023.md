### <span id="iv.XVII-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER XVII.

<span id="iv.XVII-p2"></span>

<span id="iv.XVII-p3"></span>In God is harmony, fragrance, sweetness,
pleasantness to the touch, beauty, after his ineffable manner.

<span id="iv.XVII-p4"></span>

<span id="iv.XVII-p5"></span>STILL thou art hidden, O Lord, from my soul
in thy light and thy blessedness; and therefore my soul still walks in
its darkness and wretchedness. For it looks, and does not see thy
beauty. It hearkens, and does not hear thy harmony. It smells, and does
not perceive thy fragrance. It tastes, and does not recognize thy
sweetness. It touches, and does not feel thy pleasantness. For thou hast
these attributes in thyself, Lord God, after thine ineffable manner, who
hast given them to objects created by thee, after their sensible manner;
but the sinful senses of my soul have grown rigid and dull, and have
been obstructed by their long listlessness.
