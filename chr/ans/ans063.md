### <span id="v.XXX-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER XXX.

<span id="v.XXX-p1"></span>

<span id="v.XXX-p2"></span>This expression does not consist of more
words than one, but is one Word.

<span id="v.XXX-p3"></span>

<span id="v.XXX-p4"></span>WHY, then, should I have any further doubt
regarding that question which I dismissed above as doubtful, namely,
whether this expression consists of more words than one, or of one? For,
if it is so consubstantial with the supreme Nature that they are not two
spirits, but one; assuredly, just as the latter is supremely simple, so
is the former. It therefore does not consist of more words than one, but
is one Word, through which all things were created.
