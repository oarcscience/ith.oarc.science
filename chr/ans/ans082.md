### <span id="v.XLIX-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER XLIX.

<span id="v.XLIX-p2"></span>

<span id="v.XLIX-p3"></span>The supreme Spirit loves himself.

<span id="v.XLIX-p4"></span>

<span id="v.XLIX-p5"></span>BUT, while I am here considering with
interest the individual properties and the common attributes of Father
and Son, I find none in them more pleasurable to contemplate than the
feeling of mutual love. For how absurd it would be to deny that the
supreme Spirit loves himself, just as he remembers himself, and
conceives of himself! since even the rational human mind is convinced
that it can love both itself and him, because it can remember itself and
him, and can <span id="page_112">p. 112</span> <span
id="v.XLIX-Page_112"></span>conceive of itself and of him; for idle and
almost useless is the memory and conception of any object, unless, so
far as reason requires, the object itself is loved or condemned. The
supreme Spirit, then, loves himself, just as he remembers himself and
conceives of himself.
