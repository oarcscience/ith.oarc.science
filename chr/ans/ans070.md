### <span id="v.XXXVII-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER XXXVII.

<span id="v.XXXVII-p2"></span>

<span id="v.XXXVII-p3"></span>Whatever his relation to his creatures,
this relation his Word also sustains: yet both do not simultaneously
sustain this relation as more than one being.

<span id="v.XXXVII-p4"></span>

<span id="v.XXXVII-p5"></span>BUT since it has already been clearly
demonstrated that the supreme Spirit created all things through his
Word, did not the Word itself also create all things? For, since it is
consubstantial with him, it must be the supreme essence of that of which
it is the Word. But there is no supreme Essence, except one, which is
the only creator and the only beginning of all things which have been
created. For this Essence, through no other than itself, alone created
all things from nothing. Hence, whatever the supreme Spirit creates, the
same his Word also creates, and in the same way.

<span id="v.XXXVII-p6"></span>Whatever relation, then, the supreme
Spirit bears to what he creates, this relation his Word also bears, and
in the same way. And yet, both do not bear it simultaneously, as more
than one, since there are not more supreme creative essences than one.
Therefore, <span id="page_99">p. 99</span> <span
id="v.XXXVII-Page_99"></span>just as he is the creator and the beginning
of the world, so is his Word also; and yet there are not two, but one
creator and one beginning.
