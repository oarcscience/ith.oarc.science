### <span id="iv.XVI-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER XVI.

<span id="iv.XVI-p2"></span>

<span id="iv.XVI-p3"></span>This is the unapproachable light wherein he
dwells.

<span id="iv.XVI-p4"></span>

<span id="iv.XVI-p5"></span>TRULY, O Lord, this is the unapproachable
light in which thou dwellest; for truly there is nothing else which can
penetrate this light, that it may see thee there. Truly, I see it not,
because it is too bright for me. And yet, whatsoever I see, I see
through it, as the weak eye sees what it sees through the light of the
sun, which in the sun itself it cannot look upon. My understanding
cannot reach that light, for it shines too bright. It does not
comprehend it, nor does the eye of my soul endure to gaze upon it long.
It is dazzled by the brightness, it is overcome by the greatness, it is
overwhelmed by the infinity, it is dazed by the largeness, of the light.

<span id="iv.XVI-p6"></span>O supreme and unapproachable light! O whole
<span id="page_22">p. 22</span> <span id="iv.XVI-Page_22"></span>and
blessed truth, how far art thou from me, who am so near to thee! How far
removed art thou from my vision, though I am so near to thine!
Everywhere thou art wholly present, and I see thee not. In thee I move,
and in thee I have my being; and I cannot come to thee. Thou art within
me, and about me, and I feel thee not.
