### <span id="v.LXVI-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LXVI.

<span id="v.LXVI-p2"></span>Through the rational mind is the nearest
approach to the supreme Being.

<span id="v.LXVI-p3"></span>

<span id="v.LXVI-p4"></span>SINCE it is clear, then, that nothing can be
ascertained concerning this Nature in terms of its own peculiar
character, but only in terms of something else, it is certain that a
nearer approach toward knowledge of it is made through that which
approaches it more nearly through likeness. For the more like to it
anything among created beings is proved to be, the more excellent must
that created being be by nature. Hence, this being, through its greater
likeness, assists the investigating mind in the approach to supreme
Truth; and through its more excellent created essence, teaches the more
correctly what opinion the mind itself ought to form regarding the
Creator. So, undoubtedly, a greater knowledge of the creative Being is
attained, the more nearly the creature through which the investigation
is made approaches that Being. For that every being, in so far as it
exists, is like the supreme Being, reasons already considered do not
permit us to doubt.

<span id="v.LXVI-p5"></span>It is evident, then, that as the rational
mind alone, among all created beings, is capable of rising to the
investigation of this Being, so it is not the less this same rational
mind alone, through which the mind itself can most successfully achieve
the discovery of this same Being. For it has already been acknowledged
that this approaches it most nearly, through likeness of natural
essence. What is more obvious, then, than that the more earnestly the
rational mind devotes itself<span id="page_130">p. 130</span> <span
id="v.LXVI-Page_130"></span> to learning its own nature, the more
effectively does it rise to the knowledge of that Being; and the more
carelessly it contemplates itself, the farther does it descend from the
contemplation of that Being?
