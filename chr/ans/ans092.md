### <span id="v.LIX-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LIX.

<span id="v.LIX-p2"></span>

<span id="v.LIX-p3"></span>The Father and the Son and their Spirit exist
equally the one in the other.

<span id="v.LIX-p4"></span>

<span id="v.LIX-p5"></span>IT is a most interesting consideration that
the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit of both, exist in one <span
id="page_119">p. 119</span> <span id="v.LIX-Page_119"></span>another
with such equality that no one of them surpasses another. For, not only
is each in such a way the perfectly supreme Being that, nevertheless,
all three at once exist only as one supreme Being, but the same truth is
no less capable of proof when each is taken separately.

<span id="v.LIX-p6"></span>For the Father exists as a whole in the Son,
and in the Spirit common to them; and the Son in the Father, and in the
Spirit; and the Spirit in the Father, and in the Son; for the memory of
the supreme Being exists, as a whole, in its intelligence and in its
love, and the intelligence in its memory and love, and the love in its
memory and intelligence. For the supreme Spirit conceives of
(*intelligit*) its memory as a whole, and loves it, and remembers its
intelligence as a whole, and loves it as a whole, and remembers its love
as a whole, and conceives of it as a whole.

<span id="v.LIX-p7"></span>But we mean by the memory, the Father; by the
intelligence, the Son; by the love, the Spirit of both. In such
equality, therefore, do Father and Son and Spirit embrace one another,
and exist in one another, that none of them can be proved to surpass
another or to exist without it.
