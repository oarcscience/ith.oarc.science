### <span id="v.LV-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LV.

<span id="v.LV-p2"></span>

<span id="v.LV-p3"></span>This love is not their Son.

<span id="v.LV-p4"></span>

<span id="v.LV-p5"></span>SINCE this love, then, has its being equally
from Father and Son, and is so like both that it is in no wise unlike
them, but is altogether identical with them; is it to be regarded as
their Son or offspring? But, as the Word, so soon as it is examined,
declares itself to be the offspring of him from whom it derives
existence, by displaying a manifold likeness to its parent; so love
plainly denies that it sustains such a relation, since, so long as it is
conceived to proceed from Father and Son, it does not at once show to
one who contemplates it so evident a likeness to him from whom it
derives existence, although deliberate reasoning teaches us that it is
altogether identical with Father and Son.

<span id="v.LV-p6"></span>Therefore, if it is their offspring, either
one of them is its father and the other its mother, or each is its
father, or mother, ‑‑ suppositions which apparently contradict all
truth. For, since it proceeds in precisely the same way from the Father
as from the Son, regard for truth does not allow the relations of Father
and Son to it to be described by different words; therefore, the one is
not its father, the other its mother. But that there are two beings
which, taken separately, bear each the perfect relation of father or
mother, differing in no respect, to some one being ‑‑of this no existing
nature allows proof by any example.

<span id="v.LV-p7"></span>Hence, both, that is, Father and Son, are not
father and mother of the love emanating from them. It <span
id="page_116">p. 116</span> <span id="v.LV-Page_116"></span>therefore is
apparently most inconsistent with truth that their identical love should
be their son or offspring.
