### <span id="iv.XXIV-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER XXIV.

<span id="iv.XXIV-p2"></span>

<span id="iv.XXIV-p3"></span>Conjecture as to the character and the
magnitude of this good. ‑‑If the created life is good, how good is the
creative life!

<span id="iv.XXIV-p4"></span>

<span id="iv.XXIV-p5"></span>AND now, my soul, arouse and lift up all
thy understanding, and conceive, so far as thou canst, of what character
and how great is that good! For, if individual goods are delectable,
conceive in earnestness how delectable is that good which contains the
pleasantness of all goods; and not such as we have experienced in
created objects, but as different as the Creator from the creature. For,
if the created life is good, how good is the creative life! If the
salvation given is delightful, how delightful is the salvation which has
given all salvation! If wisdom in the knowledge of the created world is
lovely, how lovely is the wisdom which has created all things from
nothing! Finally, if there are many great delights in delectable things,
what and how great is the delight in him who has made these delectable
things.
