### <span id="v.LXXVIII-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LXXVIII.

<span id="v.LXXVIII-p2"></span>

<span id="v.LXXVIII-p3"></span>The supreme Being may in some sort be
called Three.

<span id="v.LXXVIII-p4"></span>

<span id="v.LXXVIII-p5"></span>AND so it is evidently expedient for
every man to believe in a certain ineffable trinal unity, and in one
Trinity; one and a unity because of its one essence, but trinal and a
trinity because of its three ‑‑what? For, although I can speak of a
Trinity because of Father and Son and the Spirit of both, who are three;
yet I cannot, in one word, show why they are three; as if I should call
this Being a Trinity because of its three persons, just as I would call
it a unity because of its one substance.

<span id="v.LXXVIII-p6"></span>For three persons are not to be supposed,
because all persons which are more than one so subsist separately from
one another, that there must be as many substances as there are persons,
a fact that is recognised in the case of more men than one, when there
are as many persons as there are individual substances. Hence, in the
supreme Being, just as there are not more substances than one, so there
are not more persons than one.

<span id="v.LXXVIII-p7"></span>So, if one wishes to express to any why
they are three, he will say that they are Father and Son and the Spirit
of both, unless perchance, compelled by the lack of a precisely
appropriate term, he shall choose some one of those terms which cannot
be applied in a plural sense to the supreme Being, in order to indicate
what cannot be expressed in any fitting language; as if he should say,
for instance, that this wonderful Trinity is one essence or nature, and
three persons or substances.

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span> <span id="v.LXXVIII-Page_141"></span>

<span id="v.LXXVIII-p8"></span>For these two terms are more
appropriately chosen to describe plurality in the supreme Being, because
the word *person* is applied only to an individual, rational nature; and
the word substance is ordinarily applied to individual beings, which
especially subsist in plurality. For individual beings are especially
exposed to, that is, are *subject* to, accidents, and for this reason
they more properly receive the name *sub‑stance*. Now, it is already
manifest that the supreme Being, which is subject to no accidents,
cannot properly be called a substance, except as the word *substance* is
used in the same sense with the word *Essence*. Hence, on this ground,
namely, of necessity, that supreme and one Trinity or trinal unity may
justly be called one Essence and three Persons or three Substances.
