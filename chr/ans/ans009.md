### <span id="iv.III-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER III.

<span id="iv.III-p1"></span>

<span id="iv.III-p2"></span>God cannot be conceived not to exist. ‑‑God
is that, than which nothing greater can be conceived. ‑‑That which can
be conceived not to exist is not God.

<span id="iv.III-p3"></span>

<span id="iv.III-p4"></span>AND it assuredly exists so truly, that it
cannot be conceived not to exist. For, it is possible to conceive of a
being which cannot be conceived not to exist; and this is greater than
one which can be conceived not to exist. Hence, if that, than which
nothing greater can be conceived, can be conceived not to exist, it is
not that, than which nothing greater can be conceived. But this is an
irreconcilable contradiction. There is, then, so truly a being than
which nothing greater can be conceived to exist, that it cannot even
<span id="page_8">p. 8</span> <span id="iv.III-Page_8"></span>be
conceived not to exist;. and this being thou art, O Lord, our God.

<span id="iv.III-p5"></span>So truly, therefore, dost thou exist, O
Lord, my God, that thou canst not be conceived not to exist; and
rightly. For, if a mind could conceive of a being better than thee, the
creature would rise above the Creator; and this is most absurd. And,
indeed, whatever else there is, except thee alone, can be conceived not
to exist. To thee alone, therefore, it belongs to exist more truly than
all other beings, and hence in a higher degree than all others. For,
whatever else exists does not exist so truly, and hence in a less degree
it belongs to it to exist. Why, then, has the fool said in his heart,
there is no God (<span id="iv.III-p5.1"></span>[Psalms
14:1](../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001)<span id="iv.III-p5.1"></span>.md),
since it is so evident, to a rational mind, that thou dost exist in the
highest degree of all? Why, except that he is dull and a fool?
