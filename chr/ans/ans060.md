### <span id="v.XXVII-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER XXVII.

<span id="v.XXVII-p1"></span>

<span id="v.XXVII-p2"></span>It is not included among substances as
commonly treated, yet it is a substance and an indivisible spirit.

<span id="v.XXVII-p3"></span>

<span id="v.XXVII-p4"></span>IT is, therefore, evident that in any
ordinary treatment of substance, this Substance cannot be included, from
sharing in whose essence every nature is excluded. Indeed, since every
substance is treated either as universal, i. e., as essentially common
to more than one substance, as being a man is common to individual men;
or as individual, having a universal essence in common with others, as
individual men have in common with individual men the fact that they are
men; does any one conceive that, in the treatment of other substances,
that supreme Nature is included, which neither divides itself into more
substances than one, <span id="page_86">p. 86</span> <span
id="v.XXVII-Page_86"></span>nor unites with any other, by virtue of a
common essence?

<span id="v.XXVII-p5"></span>Yet, seeing that it not only most certainly
exists, but exists in the highest degree of all things; and since the
essence of anything is usually called its substance, doubtless if any
worthy name can be given it, there is no objection to our calling it
*substance*.

<span id="v.XXVII-p6"></span>And since no worthier essence than spirit
and body is known, and of these, spirit is more worthy than body, it
must certainly be maintained that this Being is spirit and not body.
But, seeing that one spirit has not any parts, and there cannot be more
spirits than one of this kind, it must, by all means, be an indivisible
spirit. For since, as is shown above, it is neither compounded of parts,
nor can be conceived of as mutable, through any differences or
accidents, it is impossible that it is divisible by any form of
division.
