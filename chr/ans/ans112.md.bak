### <span id="v.LXXIX-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LXXIX.

<span id="v.LXXIX-p2"></span>

<span id="v.LXXIX-p3"></span>This Essence itself is God, who alone is
lord and ruler of all.

<span id="v.LXXIX-p4"></span>

<span id="v.LXXIX-p5"></span>IT appears, then ‑‑ nay, it is
unhesitatingly declared that what is called God is not nothing; and that
to this supreme Essence the name *God* is properly given. For every one
who says that a God exists, whether one or more than one, conceives of
him only as of some substance which he believes to be above every nature
that is not God, and that he is to be worshipped of men because of his
preeminent majesty, and to be appeased for man’s own sake because of
some imminent necessity.

<span id="v.LXXIX-p6"></span>But what should be so worshipped in
accordance with its majesty, and what should be so appeased in behalf of
any object, as the supremely good and supremely powerful Spirit, who is
Lord of all and who rules all? For, as it is established that through
the <span id="page_142">p. 142</span> <span
id="v.LXXIX-Page_142"></span>supreme Good and its supremely wise
omnipotence all things were created and live, it is most inconsistent to
suppose that the Spirit himself does not rule the beings created by him,
or that beings are governed by another less powerful or less good, or by
no reason at all, but by the confused flow of events alone. For it is he
alone through whom it is well with every creature, and without whom it
is well with none, and *from whom*, and *through whom*, and *in whom*,
are all things.

<span id="v.LXXIX-p7"></span>Therefore, since he himself alone is not
only the beneficent Creator, but the most powerful lord, and most wise
ruler of all; it is clear that it is he alone whom every other nature,
according to its whole ability, ought to worship in love, and to love in
worship; from whom all happiness is to be hoped for; with whom refuge
from adversity is to be sought; to whom supplication for all things is
to be offered. Truly, therefore, he is not only God, but the only God,
ineffably Three and One.
