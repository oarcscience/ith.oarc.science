### <span id="v.LVI-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LVI.

<span id="v.LVI-p2"></span>

<span id="v.LVI-p3"></span>Only the Father begets and is unbegotten;
only the son is begotten; only love neither begotten nor unbegotten.

<span id="v.LVI-p4"></span>

<span id="v.LVI-p5"></span>STILL, it is apparent that this love can
neither be said, in accordance with the usage of common speech, to be
unbegotten, nor can it so properly be said to be begotten, as the Word
is said to be begotten. For we often say of a thing that it is begotten
of that from which it derives existence, as when we say that light or
heat is begotten of fire, or any effect of its cause.

<span id="v.LVI-p6"></span>On this ground, then, love, proceeding from
supreme Spirit, cannot be declared to be wholly unbegotten, but it
cannot so properly be said to be begotten as can the Word; since the
Word is the most true offspring and most true Son, while it is manifest
that love is by no means offspring or son.

<span id="v.LVI-p7"></span>He alone, therefore, may, or rather should,
be called begetter and unbegotten, whose is the Word; since he alone is
Father and parent, and in no wise derives existence from another; and
the Word alone should be called begotten, which alone is Son and
offspring. But only the love of both is neither begotten nor unbegotten,
because it is neither son nor off spring, and yet does in some sort
derive existence from another.
