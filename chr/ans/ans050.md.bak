### <span id="v.XVII-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER XVII.

<span id="v.XVII-p1"></span>

<span id="v.XVII-p2"></span>It is simple in such a way that all things
that can be said of its essence are one and the same in it: and nothing
can be said of its substance except in terms of what it is.

<span id="v.XVII-p3"></span>

<span id="v.XVII-p4"></span>IS it to be inferred, then, that if the
supreme Nature is so many goods, it will therefore be compounded of more
goods than one? Or is it true, rather, that there are not more goods
than one, but a single good <span id="page_66">p. 66</span> <span
id="v.XVII-Page_66"></span>described by many names? For, everything
which is composite requires for its subsistence the things of which it
is compounded, and, indeed, owes to them the fact of its existence,
because, whatever it is, it is through these things; and they are not
what they are through it, and therefore it is not at all supreme. If,
then, that Nature is compounded of more goods than one, all these facts
that are true of every composite must be applicable to it. But this
impious falsehood the whole cogency of the truth that was shown above
refutes and overthrows, through a clear argument.

<span id="v.XVII-p5"></span>Since, then, that Nature is by no means
composite and yet is by all means those so many goods, necessarily all
these are not more than one, but are one. Any one of them is, therefore,
the same as all, whether taken all at once or separately. Therefore,
just as whatever is attributed to the essence of the supreme Substance
is one; so this substance is whatever it is essentially in one way, and
by virtue of one consideration. For, when a man is said to be a material
body, and rational, and human, these three things are not said in one
way, or in virtue of one consideration. For, in accordance with one
fact, be is a material body; and in accordance with another, rational;
and no one of these, taken by itself, is the whole of what man is.

<span id="v.XVII-p6"></span>That supreme Being, however, is by no means
anything in such a way that it is not this same thing, according to
another way, or another consideration; because, whatever it is
essentially in any way, this is all of what it is. Therefore, nothing
that is truly said of the supreme Being is accepted in terms of quality
or quantity, but only in terms of *what* it is. For, whatever it is in
terms of either quality or quantity <span id="page_67">p. 67</span>
<span id="v.XVII-Page_67"></span>would constitute still another element,
in terms of what it is; hence, it would not be simple, but composite.
