### <span id="v.LVIII-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LVIII.

<span id="v.LVIII-p2"></span>

<span id="v.LVIII-p3"></span>As the Son is the essence or wisdom of the
Father in the sense that he has the same essence or wisdom that the
Father has: so likewise the Spirit is the essence and wisdom etc. of
Father and Son.

<span id="v.LVIII-p4"></span>

<span id="v.LVIII-p5"></span>ALSO, just as the Son is the substance and
wisdom and virtue of the Father, in the sense that he has the same
essence and wisdom and virtue with the Father; so it may be conceived
that the Spirit of both is the essence or wisdom or virtue of Father and
Son, since it has altogether the same essence, wisdom, and virtue with
these.
