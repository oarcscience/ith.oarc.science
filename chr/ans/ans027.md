### <span id="iv.XXI-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER XXI.

<span id="iv.XXI-p1"></span>

<span id="iv.XXI-p2"></span>Is this the age of the age, or ages of ages?
‑‑The eternity of God contains the ages of time themselves, and can be
called the age of the age or ages of ages.

<span id="iv.XXI-p3"></span>

<span id="iv.XXI-p4"></span>Is this, then, the age of the age, or ages
of ages? For, as an age of time contains all temporal things, so thy
eternity contains even the ages of time themselves. And these are indeed
an age, because of their indivisible unity; but ages, because of their
endless immeasurability. And, although thou art so great, O Lord, that
all things are full of thee, and exist in thee; yet thou art so without
all space, that neither midst, nor half, nor any part, is in thee.
