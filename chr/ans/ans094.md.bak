### <span id="v.LXI-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LXI.

<span id="v.LXI-p2"></span>Yet there are not three, but one Father and
one Son and one Spirit.

<span id="v.LXI-p3"></span>

<span id="v.LXI-p4"></span>AND here I see a question arises. For, if the
Father is intelligence and love as well as memory, and the Son is memory
and love as well as intelligence, and the Spirit is no less memory and
intelligence than love; how is it that the Father is not a Son and a
Spirit of some being? and why is not the Son the Father and the Spirit
of some being? and why is not this Spirit the Father of some being, and
the Son of <span id="page_121">p. 121</span> <span
id="v.LXI-Page_121"></span>some being? For it was understood, that the
Father was memory, the Son intelligence, and the Spirit love.

<span id="v.LXI-p5"></span>But this question is easily answered, if we
consider the truths already disclosed in our discussion. For the Father,
even though he is intelligence and love, is not for that reason the Son
or the Spirit of any being; since he is not intelligence, begotten of
any, or love, proceeding from any, but whatever he is, he is only the
*begetter*, and is he from whom the other proceeds.

<span id="v.LXI-p6"></span>The Son also, even though by his own power he
remembers and loves, is not, for that reason, the Father or the Spirit
of any; since he is not memory as begetter, or love as proceeding from
another after the likeness of his Spirit, but whatever being he has he
is only *begotten* and is he from whom the Spirit proceeds.

<span id="v.LXI-p7"></span>The Spirit, too, is not necessarily Father or
Son, because his own memory and intelligence are sufficient to him;
since he is not memory as begetter, or intelligence as begotten, but he
alone, whatever he is, *proceeds* or *emanates*.

<span id="v.LXI-p8"></span>What, then, forbids the conclusion that in
the supreme Being there is only one Father, one Son, one Spirit, and not
three Fathers or Sons or Spirits?
