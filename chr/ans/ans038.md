### <span id="v.V-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER V.

<span id="v.V-p1"></span>

<span id="v.V-p2"></span>Just as this Nature exists through itself, and
other beings through it, so it derives existence from itself, and other
beings from it.

<span id="v.V-p3"></span>

<span id="v.V-p4"></span>SEEING, then, that the truth already discovered
has been satisfactorily demonstrated, it is profitable to examine
whether this Nature, and all things that have any existence, derive
existence from no other source than it, just as they do not exist except
through it.

<span id="v.V-p5"></span>But it is clear that one may say, that what
derives existence from something exists through the same thing; and what
exists through something also derives existence from it. For instance,
what derives existence from matter, and exists through the artificer,
may also be said to exist through matter, and to derive existence from
the artificer, since it exists through both, and derives existence from
both. That is, it is endowed with existence by both, although it exists
through matter and from the artificer in another sense than that in
which it exists through, and from, the artificer.

<span id="v.V-p6"></span>It follows, then, that just as all existing
beings are what they are, through the supreme Nature, and as that Nature
exists through itself, but other beings through another than themselves,
so all existing beings <span id="page_45">p. 45</span> <span
id="v.V-Page_45"></span>derive existence from this supreme Nature. And
therefore, this Nature derives existence from itself, but other beings
from it.
