### <span id="v.XLV-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER XLV.

<span id="v.XLV-p2"></span>

<span id="v.XLV-p3"></span>The Son may more appropriately be called the
essence of the Father, than the Father the essence of the Son: and in
like manner the Son is the virtue, wisdom, etc., of the Father.

<span id="v.XLV-p4"></span>

<span id="v.XLV-p5"></span>AND although, for reasons we have noted, this
is true, it is much more proper to call the Son the essence of the
Father than the Father the essence of the Son. For, since the Father has
his being from none other than himself, it is not wholly appropriate to
say that he has the being of another than himself; while, since the Son
has his being from the Father, and has the same essence with his Father,
he may most appropriately be said to have the essence of his Father.

<span id="v.XLV-p6"></span>Hence, seeing that neither has an essence,
except by *being* an essence; as the Son is more appropriately conceived
to have the essence of the Father than the Father to have the essence of
the Son, so the Son may more fitly be called the essence of the Father
than the Father the essence of the son. For this single explanation
proves, with sufficiently emphatic brevity, that the Son not only has
the same essence with the Father, but has this very essence from the
Father; so that, to assert that the Son is the essence of the Father is
the same as to assert that the Son is not a different essence from the
essence of the Father nay, from the Father essence.

<span id="v.XLV-p7"></span>In like manner, therefore, the Son is the
virtue of the Father, and his wisdom, and justice, and whatever is
consistently attributed to the essence of the supreme Spirit.
