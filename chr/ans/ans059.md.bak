### <span id="v.XXVI-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER XXVI.

<span id="v.XXVI-p1"></span>

<span id="v.XXVI-p2"></span>How this Being is said to be substance: it
transcends all substance and is individually whatever it is.

<span id="v.XXVI-p3"></span>

<span id="v.XXVI-p4"></span>BUT, if what we have ascertained concerning
the simplicity of this Nature is established, how is it substance? For,
though every substance is susceptible of admixture of difference, or, at
any rate, susceptible of mutation by accidents, the immutable purity of
this Being is inaccessible to admixture or mutation, in any form.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span> <span id="v.XXVI-Page_85"></span>

<span id="v.XXVI-p5"></span>How, then, shall it be maintained that it is
a substance of any kind, except as it is called *substance* for *being*,
and so transcends, as it is above, every substance? For, as great as is
the difference between that Being, which is through itself whatever it
is, and which creates every other being from nothing, and a being, which
is made whatever it is through another, from nothing; so much does the
supreme Substance differ from these beings, which are not what it is.
And, since it alone, of all natures, derives from itself, without the
help of another nature, whatever existence it has, is it not whatever it
is individually and apart from association with its creatures?

<span id="v.XXVI-p6"></span>Hence, if it ever shares any name with other
beings, doubtless a very different signification of that name is to be
understood in its case.
