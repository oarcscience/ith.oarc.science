<p><a name="v.XLVI-p3"></A>How some of these truths which are thus expounded may also be conceived of in another way.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.XLVI-p4"></A>  		  
<p><a name="v.XLVI-p5"></A>YET, some of these truths, which may be thus expounded and conceived of, are apparently capable of another interpretation as well, not inconsistent with this same assertion. For it is proved that the Son is the true Word, that is, the perfect intelligence, conceiving of the whole substance of the Father, or perfect cognition of that substance, and knowledge of it, and wisdom regarding it; that is, it understands, and conceives of, the very essence of the Father, and 			 cognises it, and knows it, and is wise (<i>sapit</i>) regarding it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.XLVI-p6"></A>If, then, in this sense, the Son is called the intelligence of the Father, and wisdom concerning him, and knowledge and cognition of him, and acquaintance with him; since the Son understands and conceives of the Father, is wise concerning him, knows and is acquainted with him, there is no departure from truth.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.XLVI-p7"></A>Most properly, too, may the Son be called the truth of the Father, not only in the sense that the truth of the Son is the same with that of the Father, as we have already seen; but in this sense, also, that in him no imperfect imitation shall be conceived of, but the complete truth of the substance of the Father since he is no other than what the Father is.</p>
