### <span id="iv.VI-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER VI.

<span id="iv.VI-p2"></span>

<span id="iv.VI-p3"></span>How God is sensible (<span
id="iv.VI-p3.3"></span>sensibilis) although he is not a body. ‑‑God is
sensible, omnipotent, compassionate, passionless; for it is better to be
these than not be. He who in any way knows, is not improperly said in
some sort to feel.

<span id="iv.VI-p4"></span>

<span id="iv.VI-p5"></span>BUT, although it is better for thee to be
sensible, omnipotent, compassionate, passionless, than not to be these
things; how art thou sensible, if thou art not a body; or omnipotent, if
thou hast not all powers; or at once compassionate and passionless? For,
if only corporeal things are sensible, since the senses encompass a body
and are in a body, how art thou sensible, although thou art not a body,
but a supreme Spirit, who is superior to body? But, if feeling is only
cognition, or for the sake of cognition, ‑‑for he who feels obtains
knowledge in accordance with the proper functions of his senses; as
through sight, of colors; through taste, of flavors, ‑‑whatever in any
way cognises is not inappropriately said, in some sort, to feel.

<span id="iv.VI-p6"></span>Therefore, O Lord, although thou art not a
body yet thou art truly sensible in the highest degree in respect of
this, that thou dost cognise all things in the highest degree; and not
as an animal cognises, through a corporeal sense.
