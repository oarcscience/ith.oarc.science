### <span id="v.LXVIII-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LXVIII.

<span id="v.LXVIII-p2"></span>

<span id="v.LXVIII-p3"></span>The rational creature was created in order
that it might love this Being.

<span id="v.LXVIII-p4"></span>

<span id="v.LXVIII-p5"></span>IT seems to follow, then, that the
rational creature ought to devote itself to nothing so earnestly as to
the <span id="page_131">p. 131</span> <span
id="v.LXVIII-Page_131"></span>expression, through voluntary performance,
of this image which is impressed on it through a natural potency. For,
not only does it owe its very existence to its creator; but the fact
that it is known to have no power so important as that of remembering,
and conceiving of, and loving, the supreme good, proves that it ought to
wish nothing else so especially.

<span id="v.LXVIII-p6"></span>For who can deny that whatever within the
scope one’s power is better, ought to prevail with the will? For, to the
rational nature rationality is the same with the ability to distinguish
the just from the not‑just, the true from the not‑true, the good from
the not‑good, the greater good from the lesser; but this power is
altogether useless to it, and superfluous, unless what it distinguishes
it loves or condemns, in accordance with the judgment of true
discernment.

<span id="v.LXVIII-p7"></span>From this, then, it seems clear enough
that every rational being exists for this purpose, that according as, on
the grounds of discernment, it judges a thing to be more or less good,
or not good, so it may love that thing in greater or less degree, or
reject it.

<span id="v.LXVIII-p8"></span>It is, therefore, most obvious that the
rational creature was created for this purpose, that it might love the
supreme Being above all other goods, as this Being is itself the supreme
good; nay, that it might love nothing except it, unless because of it;
since that Being is good through itself, and nothing else is good except
through it.

<span id="v.LXVIII-p9"></span>But the rational being cannot love this
Being, unless it has devoted itself to remembering and conceiving of it.
It is clear, then, that the rational creature ought to devote its whole
ability and will to remembering, and conceiving of, and loving, the
supreme <span id="page_132">p. 132</span> <span
id="v.LXVIII-Page_132"></span>good, for which end it recognises that it
has its very existence.

<span id="v.LXVIII-p10"></span>
