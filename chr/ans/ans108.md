### <span id="v.LXXV-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LXXV.

<span id="v.LXXV-p2"></span>

<span id="v.LXXV-p3"></span>We must believe in this Being, that is, by
believing we must reach out for it.

<span id="v.LXXV-p4"></span>

<span id="v.LXXV-p5"></span>BUT what does not believe cannot love or
hope. It is, therefore, profitable to this human soul to believe the
supreme Being and those things without which that Being cannot be loved,
that, by believing, the soul may reach out for it. And this truth can be
more briefly and fitly indicated, I think, if instead of saying, “strive
for” the supreme Being, we say, “believe *in*“ the supreme Being.

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span> <span id="v.LXXV-Page_138"></span>

<span id="v.LXXV-p6"></span>For, if one says that he believes *in* it,
he apparently shows clearly enough both that, through the faith which he
professes, he strives for the supreme Being, and that he believes those
things which are proper to this aim. For it seems that either he who
does not believe what is proper to striving for that Being, or he who
does not strive for that Being, through what he believes, does not
believe *in* it. And, perhaps, it is indifferent whether we say,
“believe *in* it,” or “direct belief *to* it,” just as by believing to
strive *for* it and *toward* it are the same, except that whoever shall
have come to it by striving for (*tendendo in*) it, will not remain
without, but within it. And this is indicated more distinctly and
familiarly if we say, “striving *for*“ (*in*) it, than if we say,
”*toward*“ (*ad*) it.

<span id="v.LXXV-p7"></span>On this ground, therefore, I think it may
more fitly be said that we should believe *in* it, than that we should
direct belief *to* it.
