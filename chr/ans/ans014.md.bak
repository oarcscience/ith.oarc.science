### <span id="iv.VIII-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER VIII.

<span id="iv.VIII-p2"></span>

<span id="iv.VIII-p3"></span>How he is compassionate and passionless.
God is compassionate, in terms of our experience, because we experience
the effect of compassion. God is not compassionate, in terms of his own
being, because he does not experience the feeling (<span
id="iv.VIII-p3.3"></span>affectus) of compassion.

<span id="iv.VIII-p4"></span>

<span id="iv.VIII-p5"></span>BUT how art thou compassionate, and, at the
same time, passionless? For, if thou art passionless, thou dost not feel
sympathy; and if thou dost not feel sympathy, thy heart is not wretched
from sympathy for the wretched ; but this it is to be compassionate. But
if thou art not compassionate, whence cometh so great consolation to the
wretched? How, then, art thou compassionate and not compassionate, O
Lord, unless because thou art compassionate in terms of our experience,
and not compassionate in terms of thy being.

<span id="iv.VIII-p6"></span>Truly, thou art so in terms of our
experience, but thou art not so in terms of thine own. For, when thou
beholdest us in our wretchedness, we experience the effect of
compassion, but thou dost not experience the feeling. Therefore, thou
art both compassionate, because thou dost save the wretched, and spare
those <span id="page_13">p. 13</span> <span
id="iv.VIII-Page_13"></span>who sin against thee; and not compassionate
because thou art affected by no sympathy for wretchedness.
