### <span id="iv.II-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER II.

<span id="iv.II-p1"></span>

<span id="iv.II-p2"></span>Truly there is a God, although the fool hath
said in his heart, There is no God.

<span id="iv.II-p3"></span>

<span id="iv.II-p4"></span>AND so, Lord, do thou, who dost give
understanding to faith, give me, so far as thou knowest it to be
profitable, to understand that thou art as we believe; and that thou art
that which we believe. And indeed, we believe that thou art a being than
which nothing greater can be conceived. Or is there no such nature,
since the fool hath said in his heart, there is no God? (<span
id="iv.II-p4.1"></span>[Psalms 14:1](../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.II-p4.1"></span>). But, at any rate, this very fool, when he
hears of this being of which I speak ‑‑a being than which nothing
greater can be conceived ‑‑understands what he hears, and what he
understands is in his understanding; although he does not understand it
to exist.

<span id="iv.II-p5"></span>For, it is one thing for an object to be in
the understanding, and another to understand that the object exists.
When a painter first conceives of what he will afterwards perform, he
has it in his understanding, but he does not yet understand it to be,
because he has not yet performed it. But after he has made the painting,
he both has it in his understanding, and he understands that it exists,
because he has made it.

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span> <span id="iv.II-Page_7"></span>

<span id="iv.II-p6"></span>Hence, even the fool is convinced that
something exists in the understanding, at least, than which nothing
greater can be conceived. For, when he hears of this, he understands it.
And whatever is understood, exists in the understanding. And assuredly
that, than which nothing greater can be conceived, cannot exist in the
understanding alone. For, suppose it exists in the understanding alone:
then it can be conceived to exist in reality; which is greater.

<span id="iv.II-p7"></span>Therefore, if that, than which nothing
greater can be conceived, exists in the understanding alone, the very
being, than which nothing greater can be conceived, is one, than which a
greater can be conceived. But obviously this is impossible. Hence, there
is no doubt that there exists a being, than which nothing greater can be
conceived, and it exists both in the understanding and in reality.

<span id="iv.II-p8"></span>
