### <span id="v.XI-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER XI.

<span id="v.XI-p1"></span>

<span id="v.XI-p2"></span>The analogy, however, between the expression
of the Creator and the expression of the artisan is very incomplete.

<span id="v.XI-p3"></span>

<span id="v.XI-p4"></span>BUT, though it is most certain that the
supreme Substance expressed, as it were, within itself the whole created
world, which it established according to, and through, this same most
profound expression, just as an artisan first conceives in his mind what
he afterwards actually executes in accordance with his mental concept,
yet I see that this analogy is very incomplete.

<span id="v.XI-p5"></span>For the supreme Substance took absolutely
nothing from any other source, whence it might either frame a model in
itself, or make its creatures what they are; while the artisan is wholly
unable to conceive in his imagination any bodily thing, except what he
has in some way learned from external objects, whether all at once, or
part by part; nor can he perform the work mentally conceived, if there
is a lack of material, or of anything without which a work premeditated
cannot be performed. For, though a man <span id="page_58">p. 58</span>
<span id="v.XI-Page_58"></span>can, by meditation or representation,
frame the idea of some sort of animal, such as has no existence; yet, by
no means has he the power to do this, except by uniting in this idea the
parts that he has gathered in his memory from objects known externally.

<span id="v.XI-p6"></span>Hence, in this respect, these inner
expressions of the works they are to create differ in the creative
substance and in the artisan: that the former expression, without being
taken or aided from any external source, but as first and sole cause,
could suffice the Artificer for the performance of his work, while the
latter is neither first, nor sole, nor sufficient, cause for the
inception of the artisan’s work. Therefore, whatever has been created
through the former expression is only what it is through that
expression, while whatever has been created through the latter would not
exist at all, unless it were something that it is not through this
expression itself.
