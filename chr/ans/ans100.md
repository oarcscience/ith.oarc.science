### <span id="v.LXVII-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LXVII.

<span id="v.LXVII-p2"></span>

<span id="v.LXVII-p3"></span>The mind itself is the mirror and image of
that Being.

<span id="v.LXVII-p4"></span>

<span id="v.LXVII-p5"></span>THEREFORE, the mind may most fitly be said
to be its own mirror wherein it contemplates, so to speak, the image of
what it cannot see face to face. For, if the mind itself alone among all
created beings is capable of remembering and conceiving of and loving
itself, I do not see why it should be denied that it is the true image
of that being which, through its memory and intelligence and love, is
united in an ineffable Trinity. Or, at any rate, it proves itself to be
the more truly the image of that Being by its power of remembering,
conceiving of, and loving, that Being. For, the greater and the more
like that Being it is, the more truly it is recognised to be its image.

<span id="v.LXVII-p6"></span>But, it is utterly inconceivable that any
rational creature can have been naturally endowed with any power so
excellent and so like the supreme Wisdom as this power of remembering,
and conceiving of, and loving, the best and greatest of all beings.
Hence, no faculty has been bestowed on any creature that is so truly the
image of the Creator.
