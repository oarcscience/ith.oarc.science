The Ave Maria (Hail Mary) is one of the oldest and most popular Catholic
prayers. Of unknown origin, it was not officially incorporated into the
liturgy (as part of the Rosary) until the 15th Century.

# Ave Maria

AVE Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum. Benedicta tu in mulieribus, et
benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus. Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, ora pro
nobis peccatoribus, nunc, et in hora mortis nostrae. Amen.

# Hail Mary

HAIL Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou
amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary,
Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now, and in the hour of our death.
Amen.
