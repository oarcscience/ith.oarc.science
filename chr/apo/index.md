Apocrypha means 'hidden things' in Greek. The Apocryphical books of the
Bible fall into two categories: texts which were included in some
canonical version of the Bible at some point, and other texts of a
Biblical nature which have never been canonical.

## Deuterocanonical Apocrypha

[The Deuterocanonical Books of the Bible](../../bib/apo/index.md) These are
books which are included in some version of the canonical Bible, but
which have been excluded at one time or another, for textual or
doctrinal issues. These are called 'Deuterocanonical', which literally
means 'the secondary canon.'

## Other Apocrypha

These are other apocryphal texts which never made it into any official
canon, which nevertheless shed light on the Bible and its history.
