# CHAPTER 12.

The last section of this Gospel (chap. 10. 38; 11) showed the two great
means of blessing to the soul, namely, the Word of God and prayer, the
precious gift of God, and the true need of man in the presence of a
rejected Messiah. It showed withal the doom of the people who refused
every testimony of God. Chapter 12 presents the disciples carrying on
their testimony in the midst of hypocrisy and opposition, but in the
power of the Holy Ghost. The Lord addressed His disciples first of all,
but fearlessly and without compromise, before a vast throng as one who
acted in the spirit of what He taught. He warns them against that
religious formalism which consists of what could be presented to man,
and insists strongly and explicitly upon the sure bringing of all things
into the light.

1-3.—But just as the breaking down of forms and the revelation of the
full light of God had its highest operation and effect in His own death,
so the disciples must look for the world's hostility, must be prepared
for it in their own case, it might be up to death itself. If Messiah
were rejected and slain, what could they look for in the same scene
while Satan's power is not set aside? Hence, also, in these chapters it
is a question of the soul's relationship with God. It was not the
unfolding of the Church yet, but the kingdom in its Jewish application
is set aside, and the consequence is that the disciples are to look for
the Lord's coming again, and until then trial and violence. His return
would have two aspects—one for such as are in relationship with

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Himself, and the
other for the world, and both are taken up here. They were to beware of
hypocrisy, and to remember God's necessary determination to bring
everything to light. "**For there is nothing covered that shall not be
revealed**; neither hid that shall not be known. Therefore whatsoever ye
have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye
have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the
housetops."

### OUR FATHER'S CARE.

4, 5.—Next, as to the danger of walking in the light. They were not to
fear them who kill the body, but God, who could cast into Hell. Jesus
perfectly feared God, and called on His friends to fear none but Him.
"**Yea, I say unto you, fear Him**."

6.—But further, not even a **sparrow** is forgotten before God. "And the
very **hairs of your head** are all numbered." Therefore they were not
to fear. Our God has made it of faith to be assured that He cares much
for us.

8-12.—On the other hand, they were not to trust in themselves, in their
own courage, or their own wisdom, but to **confess Christ**. There was
the result in relation with the humbled, but yet to be exalted, Son of
Man. There would be a return of love or shame before the angels of God
according as He should be confessed or denied before men. He had hidden
His glory to effect grace. He had come among men and into the midst of
evil that God might be fully glorified in His humiliation. This was the
patience of God, for Christ claimed nothing. But the Holy Ghost would
come asserting the glory

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

of God, and claiming subjection to it, witnessing the grace and proving
the glory in power. Hence a word spoken against the Holy Ghost would not
be forgiven. Wonderful to say, this is attached to the disciples to
console and strengthen them in their weakness. The Son of Man might be
slighted, and yet there was forgiveness; but if He by whom they would
speak was blasphemed it would be unpardonable. Further, the Holy Ghost
would speak by them whatever the power, ecclesiastical or civil, that
arraigned them.

Such were the principles, the-warnings, the motives, and the
encouragements the Lord attached to a mission which, rejected by and
outside Judaism, was the introduction of light by grace into a world of
sin and darkness.

13, 14.—Thereupon the Lord, by positively refusing to **adjudge in
Israel**, shows that Jewish blessing had lost its place. It was no
longer a question of dividing the inheritance, but of the soul in its
position before God. Only He warns against the folly of loving the
things which gave occasion to such disputes. Righteousness on earth is
not looked for now. Jesus declines the place of regulating it, and
proceeds to show the inward principle of the kingdom in contrast with
the world. Hence He told the multitude to beware of covetousness, for a
man's life is not in what he possesses, adding a most solemn parable as
to the doom of the rich man, who was not rich toward God. Whatever he
might say to his *soul*, God required it that night. "**So is he that
layeth up treasure for himself**" (16-26).

22-31.—"**Take no thought for your life**." If it be thus with the
world, do you who have a

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Father, even the
Father, not be anxious for your soul or body. Food and clothing were not
just objects for disciples' care, but rather to "put on the Lord Jesus
Christ." Their thoughts should be in another channel, rising above a
mere natural view of the life and the body. But He proceeds to assign
positive grounds operative upon them as believers. Needful things were
subsidiary which God provided, for they were His and under His ordering.
He cared for much less than they were. The **fowls of Heaven** and the
**grass of the field** read them no uninstructive lesson, as interpreted
of Christ. And if there was on the one side God's provident care for the
least of His creatures; on the other side let them bear in mind the
utter weakness of their anxieties. Whatever might be natural to those
who knew not God, they were not to be seeking what to eat or drink.
Their Father knew they wanted such things. Let them **seek the kingdom
of God, and all the rest should be added**.

### THE LITTLE FLOCK.

32-34.—The Lord now takes higher ground for them. "**Fear not, little
flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom**."
Therefore were they rather to get rid of what they had as men, and to
provide things such as the Father gives to the heirs of the kingdom.
They were to act the part of kings called to and having a higher
inheritance. The heart follows the treasure. Let them provide a treasure
in the Heavens and their heart will be there also. The great saint is
not the value of what they gave meritoriously, but the effect

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

internally suitable to their position and their calling. God is not
ashamed to be called their God.

35-37.—Further, they were to wait for their Lord. This was especially to
form their character, and to be continually and outwardly expressed, the
habitual expectancy of the Lord. Their loins were to be girded, and
their lights burning, as if Christ was actually on His way. And He that
shall come will come; and "**blessed are those servants whom the Lord
when He cometh shall find watching**; verily I say unto you, that He
shall gird Himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come
forth and serve them."

They were now associated with the heavenly character of the kingdom.
This world was nought; what they had of it they could return into the
privilege of doing good, unselfishly, and have their treasure above,
where there would be no losing it, and so their hearts would be kept
there. Thus their character would be heavenly. Meanwhile they were to be
as men who waited their Lord returning from the wedding. The general aim
of the heavenly effect of the calling is here in question. They were to
be on the watch. It is not prophecy, but character and position. There
are no signs or historical circumstances, as in chapters 17 and 21, for
people on earth; here there is heavenly separation from it. For those
who thus wait Jesus is still a servant. He will make them sit down to
meat, and come forth and serve them. Girded to serve as man, His ear
bored in death, in joy He comes forth delighting in disciples so
walking. Gladly He releases them from their endurance, and watching, and
service; He sets them

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

at the feast, and honours their faithfulness thus. They were therefore
left in uncertainty; and so the Church, when formed, was left. The
Church is always to wait for Christ, having no special time; every
moment is its time in desire and duty, as, alas, it is the world's for
negligence. The Jews have a time. Days, years, and earthly computations
belong to them, and therefore signs. To us it may be the second watch or
the third watch; blessed only if we are found watching.

### THE WISE STEWARD.

41-48.—"**That faithful and wise steward**." Peter puts the question of
the application of what goes before, which brings out the portion of
those who serve faithfully. They will be set over all the Lord's goods
when He returns to take possession of all He made and will inherit. A
very encouraging thought, though not the highest . On the other hand,
Christendom apostatises by putting off in heart the Lord's coming. The
great stay of heavenly-mindedness is lost thereby, and so our peculiar
calling and hope. To expect the Lord detaches from the world, putting it
off left the servant to his own will. It is not doctrinal denial, but he
says *in his heart* "**My Lord delayeth His coming**," and then he acts
with violence towards the fellow-servants, and his fellowship with the
world. But that servant, let him act ever so independently, has a Lord,
and He will come when not expected, and set that servant's portion with
the unbelievers, whatever may have been his boasted rights and
privileges. Further in detail there would be a righteous adjudgment

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (47, 43); for here
we have the principles of service, as before of position. The ignorance
of heathenism will not be spared, but far more tremendous will be the
doom of Christendom. Most righteous, but, oh, how solemn!

49.—"**I am come to send fire on the earth**." There is another thing to
be noted, the import of our Lord's coming then into the world. Had man
been what he ought peace would have been the result; but man saw no
beauty in Christ to desire Him, and the effect was hatred—not peace, but
a sword. The nearer the relation the deeper the grievance. The will of
man comes out, and is utterly opposed to God. They would not endure to
be told that they were under God's judgment. But there is this
peculiarity in the character of division which the entrance of grace
makes. He who is converted in a family becomes generally, and at once,
the slave of the rest. Nature even is subverted in such cases. How often
thus a husband or parent loses his authority! There is a fire kindled
before Christ comes again in judgment to kindle it. He was not then come
to judge, but they by their rejection of Him kindled the fire of
judgment.

### THE BAPTISM OF HIS DEATH.

50.—Now, look at the Lord's part. "**I have a baptism**." What could
straiten the Lord's heart? The perfect, infinite love of God in Him was,
as it were, shut up. If He spoke to His disciples of His death, "That be
far from Thee, Lord" (Matt .16. 22), was all the response He met with
even in Peter. How painfully was He thus shut up into Himself!

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But on He went in
His service of living love through the world, looking forward to the
baptism of His death, and His being straitened showed the fulness and
strength of His love. Till then there could be no letting out of heart,
for who understood Him? The Jews said, "Behold a gluttonous man and a
winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!" They were shut up within
the walls of Judaism, so that, though One was there with a flowing river
of blessing, they would not receive Him. Divine love was, we may say,
pent up and driven back into the heart of God. But all is met. "**How am
I straitened till it be accomplished**?" He is not straitened now. The
barrier is broken in His death.

How could they as sinners have communion with Christ? There could be
none. When He came to meet man's need they hated and rejected Him. But
on the Cross He has put away sin, and now grace can flow out without
hindrance or measure. "Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound"
(Rom. 5. 20). Man is not changed, but God can act in His own way through
redemption. Christ's love and glory did come out in a measure before,
for "He could not be hid" (Mark 7. 24). But at the Cross all overflowed,
and looking back from that over His life we see what infinite love and
sorrow and suffering filled it up.

54-57.—The multitude are addressed on the **principle of personal
responsibility**. First, upon the evident signs of God's dealing with
the world; and next, from their moral judgment of what was right. The
conclusion was that God was in the way with the Jewish people, and that
if they did not

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

agree with Him then they would turn Him into a judge, and must incur the
full penalty of their iniquities. In human affairs man would be prudent
enough to come to terms with his adversary, knowing himself wrong and
anticipating the judgment. If they did not submit and be reconciled to
the Lord now in the way they would soon be delivered to His judicial
dealings, and not cease from them till they had received of His hand
double for all their sins.
