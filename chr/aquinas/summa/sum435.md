### OF THE GRATUITOUS GRACE CONSISTING IN WORDS (TWO ARTICLES)

We must now consider the gratuitous grace that attaches to words; of
which the Apostle says (<span id="SS_Q177-p2.1"></span>[1 Cor.
12:8](../../../bib/vul/co1012.htm#008).md): "To one . . . by the Spirit is
given the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge." Under
this head there are two points of inquiry:

\(1\) Whether any gratuitous grace attaches to words?

\(2\) To whom is the grace becoming?

#### Whether any gratuitous grace attaches to words?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that a gratuitous grace does not attach
to words. For grace is given for that which surpasses the faculty of
nature. But natural reason has devised the art of rhetoric whereby a man
is able to speak so as to teach, please, and persuade, as Augustine says
(De Doctr. Christ. iv, 12). Now this belongs to the grace of words.
Therefore it would seem that the grace of words is not a gratuitous
grace.

**Objection 2:** Further, all grace pertains to the kingdom of God. But
the Apostle says (<span id="SS_Q177_A1-p3.1"></span>[1 Cor.
4:20](../../../bib/vul/co1004.htm#020).md): "The kingdom of God is not in
speech, but in power." Therefore there is no gratuitous grace connected
with words.

**Objection 3:** Further, no grace is given through merit, since "if by
grace, it is not now of works" (<span id="SS_Q177_A1-p4.1"></span>[Rom.
11:6](../../../bib/vul/rom011.htm#006).md). But the word is sometimes given
to a man on his merits. For Gregory says (Moral. xi, 15) in explanation
of <span id="SS_Q177_A1-p4.2"></span>[Ps.
118:43](../../../bib/vul/psa118.htm#043.md), "Take not Thou the word of
truth utterly out of my mouth" that "the word of truth is that which
Almighty God gives to them that do it, and takes away from them that do
it not." Therefore it would seem that the gift of the word is not a
gratuitous grace.

**Objection 4:** Further, it behooves man to declare in words things
pertaining to the virtue of faith, no less than those pertaining to the
gift of wisdom or of knowledge. Therefore if the word of wisdom and the
word of knowledge are reckoned gratuitous graces, the word of faith
should likewise be placed among the gratuitous graces.

**On the contrary,** It is written (<span
id="SS_Q177_A1-p6.1"></span>[Ecclus.
6:5](../../../bib/vul/sir006.htm#005).md): "A gracious tongue in a good man
shall abound \[Vulg.: 'aboundeth'\]." Now man's goodness is by grace.
Therefore graciousness in words is also by grace.

**I answer that,** The gratuitous graces are given for the profit of
others, as stated above (FS, Q\[111\], AA\[1\],4). Now the knowledge a
man receives from God cannot be turned to another's profit, except by
means of speech. And since the Holy Ghost does not fail in anything that
pertains to the profit of the Church, He provides also the members of
the Church with speech; to the effect that a man not only speaks so as
to be understood by different people, which pertains to the gift of
tongues, but also speaks with effect, and this pertains to the grace "of
the word."

This happens in three ways. First, in order to instruct the intellect,
and this is the case when a man speaks so as "to teach." Secondly, in
order to move the affections, so that a man willingly hearkens to the
word of God. This is the case when a man speaks so as "to please" his
hearers, not indeed with a view to his own favor, but in order to draw
them to listen to God's word. Thirdly, in order that men may love that
which is signified by the word, and desire to fulfill it, and this is
the case when a man so speaks as "to sway" his hearers. In order to
effect this the Holy Ghost makes use of the human tongue as of an
instrument; but He it is Who perfects the work within. Hence Gregory
says in a homily for Pentecost (Hom. xxx in Ev.): "Unless the Holy Ghost
fill the hearts of the hearers, in vain does the voice of the teacher
resound in the ears of the body."

**Reply to Objection 1:** Even as by a miracle God sometimes works in a
more excellent way those things which nature also can work, so too the
Holy Ghost effects more excellently by the grace of words that which art
can effect in a less efficient manner.

**Reply to Objection 2:** The Apostle is speaking there of the word that
relies on human eloquence without the power of the Holy Ghost. Wherefore
he says just before (<span id="SS_Q177_A1-p10.1"></span>[1 Cor.
4:19](../../../bib/vul/co1004.htm#019).md): "I . . . will know, not the
speech of them that are puffed up, but the power": and of himself he had
already said (<span id="SS_Q177_A1-p10.2"></span>[1 Cor.
2:4](../../../bib/vul/co1002.htm#004).md): "My speech and my preaching was
not in the persuasive words of human wisdom, but in the showing of the
spirit and power."

**Reply to Objection 3:** As stated above, the grace of the word is
given to a man for the profit of others. Hence it is withdrawn sometimes
through the fault of the hearer, and sometimes through the fault of the
speaker. The good works of either of them do not merit this grace
directly, but only remove the obstacles thereto. For sanctifying grace
also is withdrawn on account of a person's fault, and yet he does not
merit it by his good works, which, however, remove the obstacles to
grace.

**Reply to Objection 4:** As stated above, the grace of the word is
directed to the profit of others. Now if a man communicates his faith to
others this is by the word of knowledge or of wisdom. Hence Augustine
says (De Trin. xiv, 1) that "to know how faith may profit the godly and
be defended against the ungodly, is apparently what the Apostle means by
knowledge." Hence it was not necessary for him to mention the word of
faith, but it was sufficient for him to mention the word of knowledge
and of wisdom.

#### Whether the grace of the word of wisdom and knowledge is becoming to women?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that the grace of the word of wisdom and
knowledge is becoming even to women. For teaching is pertinent to this
grace, as stated in the foregoing Article. Now it is becoming to a woman
to teach; for it is written (<span id="SS_Q177_A2-p2.1"></span>[Prov.
4:3](../../../bib/vul/pro004.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/vul/pro004.htm#004).md): "I was an only son in the sight
of my mother, and she taught me \[\*Vulg.: 'I was my father's son,
tender, and as an only son in the sight of my mother. And he taught
me.'\]." Therefore this grace is becoming to women.

**Objection 2:** Further, the grace of prophecy is greater than the
grace of the word, even as the contemplation of truth is greater than
its utterance. But prophecy is granted to women, as we read of Deborah
(<span id="SS_Q177_A2-p3.1"></span>[Judges
4:4](../../../bib/vul/jdg004.htm#004).md), and of Holda the prophetess, the
wife of Sellum (4 Kings 22:14), and of the four daughters of Philip
(<span id="SS_Q177_A2-p3.3"></span>[Acts
21:9](../../../bib/vul/act021.htm#009).md). Moreover the Apostle says
(<span id="SS_Q177_A2-p3.4"></span>[1 Cor.
11:5](../../../bib/vul/co1011.htm#005).md): "Every woman praying or
prophesying," etc. Much more therefore would it seem that the grace of
the word is becoming to a woman.

**Objection 3:** Further, it is written (<span
id="SS_Q177_A2-p4.1"></span>[1 Pet.
4:10](../../../bib/vul/pe1004.htm#010).md): "As every man hath received
grace ministering the same one to another." Now some women receive the
grace of wisdom and knowledge, which they cannot minister to others
except by the grace of the word. Therefore the grace of the word is
becoming to women.

**On the contrary,** The Apostle says (<span
id="SS_Q177_A2-p5.1"></span>[1 Cor.
14:34](../../../bib/vul/co1014.htm#034).md): "Let women keep silence in the
churches," and (<span id="SS_Q177_A2-p5.2"></span>[1 Tim.
2:12](../../../bib/vul/ti1002.htm#012).md): "I suffer not a woman to
teach." Now this pertains especially to the grace of the word. Therefore
the grace of the word is not becoming to women.

**I answer that,** Speech may be employed in two ways: in one way
privately, to one or a few, in familiar conversation, and in this
respect the grace of the word may be becoming to women; in another way,
publicly, addressing oneself to the whole church, and this is not
permitted to women. First and chiefly, on account of the condition
attaching to the female sex, whereby woman should be subject to man, as
appears from <span id="SS_Q177_A2-p6.1"></span>[Gn.
3:16](../../../bib/vul/gen003.htm#016.md). Now teaching and persuading
publicly in the church belong not to subjects but to the prelates
(although men who are subjects may do these things if they be so
commissioned, because their subjection is not a result of their natural
sex, as it is with women, but of some thing supervening by accident).
Secondly, lest men's minds be enticed to lust, for it is written (<span
id="SS_Q177_A2-p6.2"></span>[Ecclus.
9:11](../../../bib/vul/sir009.htm#011).md): "Her conversation burneth as
fire." Thirdly, because as a rule women are not perfected in wisdom, so
as to be fit to be intrusted with public teaching.

**Reply to Objection 1:** The passage quoted speaks of private teaching
whereby a father instructs his son.

**Reply to Objection 2:** The grace of prophecy consists in God
enlightening the mind, on the part of which there is no difference of
sex among men, according to<span id="SS_Q177_A2-p8.1"></span>[Col.
3:10](../../../bib/vul/col003.htm#010.md),
[11](../../../bib/vul/col003.htm#011.md)"Putting on the new" man, "him who
is renewed unto knowledge, according to the image of Him that created
him, where there is neither male nor female \[\*Vulg.: 'Neither Gentile
nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian nor Scythian, bond
nor free.' Cf. FP, Q\[93\], A\[6\], ad 2 footnote\]." Now the grace of
the word pertains to the instruction of men among whom the difference of
sex is found. Hence the comparison fails.

**Reply to Objection 3:** The recipients of a divinely conferred grace
administer it in different ways according to their various conditions.
Hence women, if they have the grace of wisdom or of knowledge, can
administer it by teaching privately but not publicly.
