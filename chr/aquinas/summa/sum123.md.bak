### THE MISSION OF THE ANGELS (FOUR ARTICLES)

We next consider the mission of the angels. Under this head arise four
points of inquiry:

\(1\) Whether any angels are sent on works of ministry?

\(2\) Whether all are sent?

\(3\) Whether those who are sent, assist?

\(4\) From what orders they are sent.

#### Whether the angels are sent on works of ministry?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that the angels are not sent on works of
ministry. For every mission is to some determinate place. But
intellectual actions do not determine a place, for intellect abstracts
from the "here" and "now." Since therefore the angelic actions are
intellectual, it appears that the angels are not sent to perform their
own actions.

**Objection 2:** Further, the empyrean heaven is the place that beseems
the angelic dignity. Therefore if they are sent to us in ministry, it
seems that something of their dignity would be lost; which is unseemly.

**Objection 3:** Further, external occupation hinders the contemplation
of wisdom; hence it is said: "He that is less in action, shall receive
wisdom" (<span id="FP_Q112_A1-p4.1"></span>[Ecclus.
38:25](../../../bib/vul/sir038.htm#025).md). So if some angels are sent on
external ministrations, they would seemingly be hindered from
contemplation. But the whole of their beatitude consists in the
contemplation of God. So if they were sent, their beatitude would be
lessened; which is unfitting.

**Objection 4:** Further, to minister is the part of an inferior; hence
it is written (<span id="FP_Q112_A1-p5.1"></span>[Lk.
22:27](../../../bib/vul/luk022.htm#027).md): "Which is the greater, he that
sitteth at table, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at table?"
But the angels are naturally greater than we are. Therefore they are not
sent to administer to us.

**On the contrary,** It is written (<span
id="FP_Q112_A1-p6.1"></span>[Ex.
23:20](../../../bib/vul/exo023.htm#020).md): "Behold I will send My angels
who shall go before thee."

**I answer that,** From what has been said above (Q\[108\], A\[6\]), it
may be shown that some angels are sent in ministry by God. For, as we
have already stated (Q\[43\], A\[1\]), in treating of the mission of the
Divine Persons, he is said to be sent who in any way proceeds from
another so as to begin to be where he was not, or to be in another way,
where he already was. Thus the Son, or the Holy Ghost is said to be sent
as proceeding from the Father by origin; and begins to be in a new way,
by grace or by the nature assumed, where He was before by the presence
of His Godhead; for it belongs to God to be present everywhere, because,
since He is the universal agent, His power reaches to all being, and
hence He exists in all things (Q\[8\], A\[1\]). An angel's power,
however, as a particular agent, does not reach to the whole universe,
but reaches to one thing in such a way as not to reach another; and so
he is "here" in such a manner as not to be "there." But it is clear from
what was above stated (Q\[110\], A\[1\]), that the corporeal creature is
governed by the angels. Hence, whenever an angel has to perform any work
concerning a corporeal creature, the angel applies himself anew to that
body by his power; and in that way begins to be there afresh. Now all
this takes place by Divine command. Hence it follows that an angel is
sent by God.

Yet the action performed by the angel who is sent, proceeds from God as
from its first principle, at Whose nod and by Whose authority the angels
work; and is reduced to God as to its last end. Now this is what is
meant by a minister: for a minister is an intelligent instrument; while
an instrument is moved by another, and its action is ordered to another.
Hence angels' actions are called 'ministries'; and for this reason they
are said to be sent in ministry.

**Reply to Objection 1:** An operation can be intellectual in two ways.
In one way, as dwelling in the intellect itself, as contemplation; such
an operation does not demand to occupy a place; indeed, as Augustine
says (De Trin. iv, 20): "Even we ourselves as mentally tasting something
eternal, are not in this world." In another sense an action is said to
be intellectual because it is regulated and commanded by some intellect;
in that sense the intellectual operations evidently have sometimes a
determinate place.

**Reply to Objection 2:** The empyrean heaven belongs to the angelic
dignity by way of congruity; forasmuch as it is congruous that the
higher body should be attributed to that nature which occupies a rank
above bodies. Yet an angel does not derive his dignity from the empyrean
heaven; so when he is not actually in the empyrean heaven, nothing of
his dignity is lost, as neither does a king lessen his dignity when not
actually sitting on his regal throne, which suits his dignity.

**Reply to Objection 3:** In ourselves the purity of contemplation is
obscured by exterior occupation; because we give ourselves to action
through the sensitive faculties, the action of which when intense
impedes the action of the intellectual powers. An angel, on the
contrary, regulates his exterior actions by intellectual operation
alone. Hence it follows that his external occupations in no respect
impede his contemplation; because given two actions, one of which is the
rule and the reason of the other, one does not hinder but helps the
other. Wherefore Gregory says (Moral. ii) that "the angels do not go
abroad in such a manner as to lose the delights of inward
contemplation."

**Reply to Objection 4:** In their external actions the angels chiefly
minister to God, and secondarily to us; not because we are superior to
them, absolutely speaking, but because, since every man or angel by
cleaving to God is made one spirit with God, he is thereby superior to
every creature. Hence the Apostle says (<span
id="FP_Q112_A1-p12.1"></span>[Phil.
2:3](../../../bib/vul/phi002.htm#003).md): "Esteeming others better than
themselves."

#### Whether all the angels are sent in ministry?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that all the angels are sent in ministry.
For the Apostle says (<span id="FP_Q112_A2-p2.1"></span>[Heb.
1:14](../../../bib/vul/heb001.htm#014).md): "All are ministering spirits,
sent to minister" \[Vulg. 'Are they not all . . . ?'\].

**Objection 2:** Further, among the orders, the highest is that of the
Seraphim, as stated above (Q\[108\], A\[6\]). But a Seraph was sent to
purify the lips of the prophet (<span id="FP_Q112_A2-p3.2"></span>[Isa.
6:6](../../../bib/vul/isa006.htm#006.md),
[7](../../../bib/vul/isa006.htm#007).md). Therefore much more are the
inferior orders sent.

**Objection 3:** Further, the Divine Persons infinitely excel all the
angelic orders. But the Divine Persons are sent. Therefore much more are
even the highest angels sent.

**Objection 4:** Further, if the superior angels are not sent to the
external ministries, this can only be because the superior angels
execute the Divine ministries by means of the inferior angels. But as
all the angels are unequal, as stated above (Q\[50\], A\[4\]), each
angel has an angel inferior to himself except the last one. Therefore
only the last angel would be sent in ministry; which contradicts the
words, "Thousands of thousands ministered to Him" (<span
id="FP_Q112_A2-p5.2"></span>[Dan.
7:10](../../../bib/vul/dan007.htm#010).md).

**On the contrary,** Gregory says (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.), quoting the
statement of Dionysius (Coel. Hier. xiii), that "the higher ranks fulfil
no exterior service."

**I answer that,** As appears from what has been said above (Q\[106\],
A\[3\]; Q\[110\], A\[1\]), the order of Divine Providence has so
disposed not only among the angels, but also in the whole universe, that
inferior things are administered by the superior. But the Divine
dispensation, however, this order is sometimes departed from as regards
corporeal things, for the sake of a higher order, that is, according as
it is suitable for the manifestation of grace. That the man born blind
was enlightened, that Lazarus was raised from the dead, was accomplished
immediately by God without the action of the heavenly bodies. Moreover
both good and bad angels can work some effect in these bodies
independently of the heavenly bodies, by the condensation of the clouds
to rain, and by producing some such effects. Nor can anyone doubt that
God can immediately reveal things to men without the help of the angels,
and the superior angels without the inferior. From this standpoint some
have said that according to the general law the superior angels are not
sent, but only the inferior; yet that sometimes, by Divine dispensation,
the superior angels also are sent.

It may also be said that the Apostle wishes to prove that Christ is
greater than the angels who were chosen as the messengers of the law; in
order that He might show the excellence of the new over the old law.
Hence there is no need to apply this to any other angels besides those
who were sent to give the law.

**Reply to Objection 2:** According to Dionysius (Coel. Hier. xiii), the
angel who was sent to purify the prophet's lips was one of the inferior
order; but was called a "Seraph," that is, "kindling " in an equivocal
sense, because he came to "kindle" the lips of the prophet. It may also
be said that the superior angels communicate their own proper gifts
whereby they are denominated, through the ministry of the inferior
angels. Thus one of the Seraphim is described as purifying by fire the
prophet's lips, not as if he did so immediately, but because an inferior
angel did so by his power; as the Pope is said to absolve a man when he
gives absolution by means of someone else.

**Reply to Objection 3:** The Divine Persons are not sent in ministry,
but are said to be sent in an equivocal sense, as appears from what has
been said (Q\[43\], A\[1\]).

**Reply to Objection 4:** A manifold grade exists in the Divine
ministries. Hence there is nothing to prevent angels though unequal from
being sent immediately in ministry, in such a manner however that the
superior are sent to the higher ministries, and the lower to the
inferior ministries.

#### Whether all the angels who are sent, assist?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that the angels who are sent also assist.
For Gregory says (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.): "So the angels are sent, and
assist; for, though the angelic spirit is limited, yet the supreme
Spirit, God, is not limited."

**Objection 2:** Further, the angel was sent to administer to Tobias.
Yet he said, "I am the angel Raphael, one of the seven who stand before
the Lord" (<span id="FP_Q112_A3-p3.1"></span>[Tob.
12:15](../../../bib/vul/tob012.htm#015).md). Therefore the angels who are
sent, assist.

**Objection 3:** Further, every holy angel is nearer to God than Satan
is. Yet Satan assisted God, according to<span
id="FP_Q112_A3-p4.1"></span> [Job 1:6](../../../bib/vul/job001.htm#006.md):
"When the sons of God came to stand before the Lord, Satan also was
present among them." Therefore much more do the angels, who are sent to
minister, assist.

**Objection 4:** Further, if the inferior angels do not assist, the
reason is because they receive the Divine enlightenment, not
immediately, but through the superior angels. But every angel receives
the Divine enlightenment from a superior, except the one who is highest
of all. Therefore only the highest angel would assist; which is contrary
to the text of<span id="FP_Q112_A3-p5.1"></span> [Dan.
7:10](../../../bib/vul/dan007.htm#010.md): "Ten thousand times a hundred
thousand stood before Him." Therefore the angels who are sent also
assist.

**On the contrary,** Gregory says, on<span id="FP_Q112_A3-p6.1"></span>
[Job 25:3](../../../bib/vul/job025.htm#003.md): "Is there any numbering of
His soldiers?" (Moral. xvii): "Those powers assist, who do not go forth
as messengers to men." Therefore those who are sent in ministry do not
assist.

**I answer that,** The angels are spoken of as "assisting" and
"administering," after the likeness of those who attend upon a king;
some of whom ever wait upon him, and hear his commands immediately;
while others there are to whom the royal commands are conveyed by those
who are in attendance---for instance, those who are placed at the head
of the administration of various cities; these are said to administer,
not to assist.

We must therefore observe that all the angels gaze upon the Divine
Essence immediately; in regard to which all, even those who minister,
are said to assist. Hence Gregory says (Moral. ii) that "those who are
sent on the external ministry of our salvation can always assist and see
the face of the Father." Yet not all the angels can perceive the secrets
of the Divine mysteries in the clearness itself of the Divine Essence;
but only the superior angels who announce them to the inferior: and in
that respect only the superior angels belonging to the highest hierarchy
are said to assist, whose special prerogative it is to be enlightened
immediately by God.

From this may be deduced the reply to the first and second objections,
which are based on the first mode of assisting.

**Reply to Objection 3:** Satan is not described as having assisted, but
as present among the assistants; for, as Gregory says (Moral. ii),
"though he has lost beatitude, still he has retained a nature like to
the angels."

**Reply to Objection 4:** All the assistants see some things immediately
in the glory of the Divine Essence; and so it may be said that it is the
prerogative of the whole of the highest hierarchy to be immediately
enlightened by God; while the higher ones among them see more than is
seen by the inferior; some of whom enlighten others: as also among those
who assist the king, one knows more of the king's secrets than another.

#### Whether all the angels of the second hierarchy are sent?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that all the angels of the second
hierarchy are sent. For all the angels either assist, or minister,
according to <span id="FP_Q112_A4-p2.1"></span>[Dan.
7:10](../../../bib/vul/dan007.htm#010.md). But the angels of the second
hierarchy do not assist; for they are enlightened by the angels of the
first hierarchy, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. viii). Therefore all the
angels of the second hierarchy are sent in ministry.

**Objection 2:** Further, Gregory says (Moral. xvii) that "there are
more who minister than who assist." This would not be the case if the
angels of the second hierarchy were not sent in ministry. Therefore all
the angels of the second hierarchy are sent to minister.

**On the contrary,** Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. viii) that the
"Dominations are above all subjection." But to be sent implies
subjection. Therefore the dominations are not sent to minister.

**I answer that,** As above stated (A\[1\]), to be sent to external
ministry properly belongs to an angel according as he acts by Divine
command in respect of any corporeal creature; which is part of the
execution of the Divine ministry. Now the angelic properties are
manifested by their names, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. vii); and
therefore the angels of those orders are sent to external ministry whose
names signify some kind of administration. But the name "dominations"
does not signify any such administration, but only disposition and
command in administering. On the other hand, the names of the inferior
orders imply administration, for the "Angels" and "Archangels" are so
called from "announcing"; the "Virtues" and "Powers" are so called in
respect of some act; and it is right that the "Prince," according to
what Gregory says (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.), "be first among the workers."
Hence it belongs to these five orders to be sent to external ministry;
not to the four superior orders.

**Reply to Objection 1:** The Dominations are reckoned among the
ministering angels, not as exercising but as disposing and commanding
what is to be done by others; thus an architect does not put his hands
to the production of his art, but only disposes and orders what others
are to do.

**Reply to Objection 2:** A twofold reason may be given in assigning the
number of the assisting and ministering angels. For Gregory says that
those who minister are more numerous than those who assist; because he
takes the words (<span id="FP_Q112_A4-p7.1"></span>[Dan.
7:10](../../../bib/vul/dan007.htm#010).md) "thousands of thousands
ministered to Him," not in a multiple but in a partitive sense, to mean
"thousands out of thousands"; thus the number of those who minister is
indefinite, and signifies excess; while the number of assistants is
finite as in the words added, "and ten thousand times a hundred thousand
assisted Him." This explanation rests on the opinion of the Platonists,
who said that the nearer things are to the one first principle, the
smaller they are in number; as the nearer a number is to unity, the
lesser it is than multitude. This opinion is verified as regards the
number of orders, as six administer and three assist.

Dionysius, however, (Coel. Hier. xiv) declares that the multitude of
angels surpasses all the multitude of material things; so that, as the
superior bodies exceed the inferior in magnitude to an immeasurable
degree, so the superior incorporeal natures surpass all corporeal
natures in multitude; because whatever is better is more intended and
more multiplied by God. Hence, as the assistants are superior to the
ministers there will be more assistants than ministers. In this way, the
words "thousands of thousands" are taken by way of multiplication, to
signify "a thousand times a thousand." And because ten times a hundred
is a thousand, if it were said "ten times a hundred thousand" it would
mean that there are as many assistants as ministers: but since it is
written "ten thousand times a hundred thousand," we are given to
understand that the assistants are much more numerous than the
ministers. Nor is this said to signify that this is the precise number
of angels, but rather that it is much greater, in that it exceeds all
material multitude. This is signified by the multiplication together of
all the greatest numbers, namely ten, a hundred, and a thousand, as
Dionysius remarks in the same passage.

ARTICLES)](sum124.md)
