### OF ADORATION (THREE ARTICLES)

In due sequence we must consider the external acts of latria, and in the
first place, adoration whereby one uses one's body to reverence God;
secondly, those acts whereby some external thing is offered to God;
thirdly, those acts whereby something belonging to God is assumed.

Under the first head there are three points of inquiry:

\(1\) Whether adoration is an act of latria?

\(2\) Whether adoration denotes an internal or an external act?

\(3\) Whether adoration requires a definite place?

#### Whether adoration is an act of latria or religion?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that adoration is not an act of latria or
religion. The worship of religion is due to God alone. But adoration is
not due to God alone: since we read (<span
id="SS_Q84_A1-p2.1"></span>[Gn. 18:2](../../../bib/vul/gen018.htm#002).md)
that Abraham adored the angels; and (3 Kings 1:23) that the prophet
Nathan, when he was come in to king David, "worshiped him bowing down to
the ground." Therefore adoration is not an act of religion.

**Objection 2:** Further, the worship of religion is due to God as the
object of beatitude, according to Augustine (De Civ. Dei x, 3): whereas
adoration is due to Him by reason of His majesty, since a gloss on<span
id="SS_Q84_A1-p3.1"></span> [Ps. 28:2,](../../../bib/vul/psa028.htm#002.md)
"Adore ye the Lord in His holy court," says: "We pass from these courts
into the court where we adore His majesty." Therefore adoration is not
an act of latria.

**Objection 3:** Further, the worship of one same religion is due to the
three Persons. But we do not adore the three Persons with one adoration,
for we genuflect at each separate invocation of Them \[\*At the
adoration of the Cross, on Good Friday\]. Therefore adoration is nol an
act of latria.

**On the contrary,** are the words quoted<span
id="SS_Q84_A1-p5.1"></span> [Mat.
4:10](../../../bib/vul/mat004.htm#010.md): "The Lord thy God shalt thou
adore and Him only shalt thou serve."

**I answer that,** Adoration is directed to the reverence of the person
adored. Now it is evident from what we have said (Q\[81\], AA\[2\],4)
that it is proper to religion to show reverence to God. Hence the
adoration whereby we adore God is an act of religion.

**Reply to Objection 1:** Reverence is due to God on account of His
excellence, which is communicated to certain creatures not in equal
measure, but according to a measure of proportion; and so the reverence
which we pay to God, and which belongs to latria, differs from the
reverence which we pay to certain excellent creatures; this belongs to
dulia, and we shall speak of it further on (Q\[103\]). And since
external actions are signs of internal reverence, certain external
tokens significative of reverence are offered to creatures of
excellence, and among these tokens the chief is adoration: yet there is
one thing which is offered to God alone, and that is sacrifice. Hence
Augustine says (De Civ. Dei x, 4): "Many tokens of Divine worship are
employed in doing honor to men, either through excessive humility, or
through pernicious flattery; yet so that those to whom these honors are
given are recognized as being men to whom we owe esteem and reverence
and even adoration if they be far above us. But who ever thought it his
duty to sacrifice to any other than one whom he either knew or deemed or
pretended to be a God?" Accordingly it was with the reverence due to an
excellent creature that Nathan adored David; while it was the reverence
due to God with which Mardochai refused to adore Aman fearing "lest he
should transfer the honor of his God to a man" (<span
id="SS_Q84_A1-p7.2"></span>[Esther
13:14](../../../bib/vul/est013.htm#014).md).

Again with the reverence due to an excellent creature Abraham adored the
angels, as did also Josue (<span id="SS_Q84_A1-p8.1"></span>[Jos.
5:15](../../../bib/vul/jos005.htm#015).md): though we may understand them
to have adored, with the adoration of latria, God Who appeared and spoke
to them in the guise of an angel. It was with the reverence due to God
that John was forbidden to adore the angel (<span
id="SS_Q84_A1-p8.2"></span>[Apoc.
22:9](../../../bib/vul/rev022.htm#009).md), both to indicate the dignity
which he had acquired through Christ, whereby man is made equal to an
angel: wherefore the same text goes on: "I am thy fellow-servant and of
thy brethren"; as also to exclude any occasion of idolatry, wherefore
the text continues: "Adore God."

**Reply to Objection 2:** Every Divine excellency is included in His
majesty: to which it pertains that we should be made happy in Him as in
the sovereign good.

**Reply to Objection 3:** Since there is one excellence of the three
Divine Persons, one honor and reverence is due to them and consequently
one adoration. It is to represent this that where it is related (<span
id="SS_Q84_A1-p10.1"></span>[Gn. 18:2](../../../bib/vul/gen018.htm#002).md)
that three men appeared to Abraham, we are told that he addressed one,
saying: "Lord, if I have found favor in thy sight," etc. The triple
genuflection represents the Trinity of Persons, not a difference of
adoration.

#### Whether adoration denotes an action of the body?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that adoration does not denote an act of
the body. It is written (<span id="SS_Q84_A2-p2.1"></span>[Jn.
4:23](../../../bib/vul/joh004.htm#023).md): "The true adorers shall adore
the Father in spirit and in truth." Now what is done in spirit has
nothing to do with an act of the body. Therefore adoration does not
denote an act of the body.

**Objection 2:** Further, the word adoration is taken from "oratio"
\[prayer\]. But prayer consists chiefly in an interior act, according to
<span id="SS_Q84_A2-p3.1"></span>[1 Cor.
14:15,](../../../bib/vul/co1014.htm#015.md) "I will pray with the spirit, I
will pray also with the understanding." Therefore adoration denotes
chiefly a spiritual act.

**Objection 3:** Further, acts of the body pertain to sensible
knowledge: whereas we approach God not by bodily but by spiritual sense.
Therefore adoration does not denote an act of the body.

**On the contrary,** A gloss on<span id="SS_Q84_A2-p5.1"></span> [Ex.
20:5,](../../../bib/vul/exo020.htm#005.md) "Thou shalt not adore them, nor
serve them," says: "Thou shalt neither worship them in mind, nor adore
them outwardly."

**I answer that,** As Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iv, 12), since we
are composed of a twofold nature, intellectual and sensible, we offer
God a twofold adoration; namely, a spiritual adoration, consisting in
the internal devotion of the mind; and a bodily adoration, which
consists in an exterior humbling of the body. And since in all acts of
latria that which is without is referred to that which is within as
being of greater import, it follows that exterior adoration is offered
on account of interior adoration, in other words we exhibit signs of
humility in our bodies in order to incite our affections to submit to
God, since it is connatural to us to proceed from the sensible to the
intelligible.

**Reply to Objection 1:** Even bodily adoration is done in spirit, in so
far as it proceeds from and is directed to spiritual devotion.

**Reply to Objection 2:** Just as prayer is primarily in the mind, and
secondarily expressed in words, as stated above (Q\[83\], A\[12\]), so
too adoration consists chiefly in an interior reverence of God, but
secondarily in certain bodily signs of humility; thus when we genuflect
we signify our weakness in comparison with God, and when we prostrate
ourselves we profess that we are nothing of ourselves.

**Reply to Objection 3:** Though we cannot reach God with the senses,
our mind is urged by sensible signs to approach God.

#### Whether adoration requires a definite place?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that adoration does not require a
definite place. It is written (<span id="SS_Q84_A3-p2.1"></span>[Jn.
4:21](../../../bib/vul/joh004.htm#021).md): "The hour cometh, when you
shall neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, adore the Father"; and
the same reason seems to apply to other places. Therefore a definite
place is not necessary for adoration.

**Objection 2:** Further, exterior adoration is directed to interior
adoration. But interior adoration is shown to God as existing
everywhere. Therefore exterior adoration does not require a definite
place.

**Objection 3:** Further, the same God is adored in the New as in the
Old Testament. Now in the Old Testament they adored towards the west,
because the door of the Tabernacle looked to the east (<span
id="SS_Q84_A3-p4.1"></span>[Ex. 26:18](../../../bib/vul/exo026.htm#018.md)
seqq.). Therefore for the same reason we ought now to adore towards the
west, if any definite place be requisite for adoration.

**On the contrary,** It is written (<span
id="SS_Q84_A3-p5.1"></span>[Is. 56:7](../../../bib/vul/isa056.htm#007).md):
"My house shall be called the house of prayer," which words are also
quoted (<span id="SS_Q84_A3-p5.2"></span>[Jn.
2:16](../../../bib/vul/joh002.htm#016).md).

**I answer that,** As stated above (A\[2\]), the chief part of adoration
is the internal devotion of the mind, while the secondary part is
something external pertaining to bodily signs. Now the mind internally
apprehends God as not comprised in a place; while bodily signs must of
necessity be in some definite place and position. Hence a definite place
is required for adoration, not chiefly, as though it were essential
thereto, but by reason of a certain fittingness, like other bodily
signs.

**Reply to Objection 1:** By these words our Lord foretold the cessation
of adoration, both according to the rite of the Jews who adored in
Jerusalem, and according to the rite of the Samaritans who adored on
Mount Garizim. For both these rites ceased with the advent of the
spiritual truth of the Gospel, according to which "a sacrifice is
offered to God in every place," as stated in<span
id="SS_Q84_A3-p7.1"></span> [Malach.
1:11.](../../../bib/vul/mal001.htm#011.md)

**Reply to Objection 2:** A definite place is chosen for adoration, not
on account of God Who is adored, as though He were enclosed in a place,
but on account of the adorers; and this for three reasons. First,
because the place is consecrated, so that those who pray there conceive
a greater devotion and are more likely to be heard, as may be seen in
the prayer of Solomon (3 Kings 8). Secondly, on account of the sacred
mysteries and other signs of holiness contained therein. Thirdly, on
account of the concourse of many adorers, by reason of which their
prayer is more likely to be heard, according to<span
id="SS_Q84_A3-p8.2"></span> [Mat.
18:20,](../../../bib/vul/mat018.htm#020.md) "Where there are two or three
gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them."

**Reply to Objection 3:** There is a certain fittingness in adoring
towards the east. First, because the Divine majesty is indicated in the
movement of the heavens which is from the east. Secondly, because
Paradise was situated in the east according to the Septuagint version
of<span id="SS_Q84_A3-p9.1"></span> [Gn.
2:8,](../../../bib/vul/gen002.htm#008.md) and so we signify our desire to
return to Paradise. Thirdly, on account of Christ Who is "the light of
the world" \[\*<span id="SS_Q84_A3-p9.2"></span>[Jn.
8:12](../../../bib/vul/joh008.htm#012.md); 9:5\], and is called "the
Orient" (<span id="SS_Q84_A3-p9.3"></span>[Zech.
6:12](../../../bib/vul/zac006.htm#012).md). Who mounteth above the heaven
of heavens to the east (<span id="SS_Q84_A3-p9.4"></span>[Ps.
67:34](../../../bib/vul/psa067.htm#034).md), and is expected to come from
the east, according to <span id="SS_Q84_A3-p9.5"></span>[Mat.
24:27](../../../bib/vul/mat024.htm#027.md), "As lightning cometh out of the
east, and appeareth even into the west; so shall also the coming of the
Son of Man be."
