### OF CONTENTION (TWO ARTICLES)

We must now consider contention, in respect of which there are two
points of inquiry:

\(1\) Whether contention is a mortal sin?

\(2\) Whether it is a daughter of vainglory?

#### Whether contention is a mortal sin?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that contention is not a mortal sin. For
there is no mortal sin in spiritual men: and yet contention is to be
found in them, according to<span id="SS_Q38_A1-p2.1"></span> [Lk.
22:24](../../../bib/vul/luk022.htm#024.md): "And there was also a strife
amongst" the disciples of Jesus, "which of them should . . . be the
greatest." Therefore contention is not a mortal sin.

**Objection 2:** Further, no well disposed man should be pleased that
his neighbor commit a mortal sin. But the Apostle says (<span
id="SS_Q38_A1-p3.1"></span>[Phil.
1:17](../../../bib/vul/phi001.htm#017).md): "Some out of contention preach
Christ," and afterwards he says (<span id="SS_Q38_A1-p3.2"></span>[Phil.
1:18](../../../bib/vul/phi001.htm#018).md): "In this also I rejoice, yea,
and will rejoice." Therefore contention is not a mortal sin.

**Objection 3:** Further, it happens that people contend either in the
courts or in disputations, without any spiteful purpose, and with a good
intention, as, for example, those who contend by disputing with
heretics. Hence a gloss on <span id="SS_Q38_A1-p4.1"></span>[1 Kings
14:1,](../../../bib/vul/kg1014.htm#001.md) "It came to pass one day," etc.
says: "Catholics do not raise contentions with heretics, unless they are
first challenged to dispute." Therefore contention is not a mortal sin.

**Objection 4:** Further, Job seems to have contended with God,
according to <span id="SS_Q38_A1-p5.1"></span>[Job
39:32](../../../bib/vul/job039.htm#032.md): "Shall he that contendeth with
God be so easily silenced?" And yet Job was not guilty of mortal sin,
since the Lord said of him (<span id="SS_Q38_A1-p5.2"></span>[Job
42:7](../../../bib/vul/job042.htm#007).md): "You have not spoken the thing
that is right before me, as my servant Job hath." Therefore contention
is not always a mortal sin.

**On the contrary,** It is against the precept of the Apostle who says
(<span id="SS_Q38_A1-p6.1"></span>[2 Tim.
2:14](../../../bib/vul/ti2002.htm#014).md): "Contend not in words."
Moreover (<span id="SS_Q38_A1-p6.2"></span>[Gal.
5:20](../../../bib/vul/gal005.htm#020).md) contention is included among the
works of the flesh, and as stated there (<span
id="SS_Q38_A1-p6.3"></span>[Gal. 5:21](../../../bib/vul/gal005.htm#021).md)
"they who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God." Now
whatever excludes a man from the kingdom of God and is against a
precept, is a mortal sin. Therefore contention is a mortal sin.

**I answer that,** To contend is to tend against some one. Wherefore
just as discord denotes a contrariety of wills, so contention signifies
contrariety of speech. For this reason when a man contrasts various
contrary things in a speech, this is called "contentio," which Tully
calls one of the rhetorical colors (De Rhet. ad Heren. iv), where he
says that "it consists in developing a speech from contrary things," for
instance: "Adulation has a pleasant beginning, and a most bitter end."

Now contrariety of speech may be looked at in two ways: first with
regard to the intention of the contentious party, secondly, with regard
to the manner of contending. As to the intention, we must consider
whether he contends against the truth, and then he is to be blamed, or
against falsehood, and then he should be praised. As to the manner, we
must consider whether his manner of contending is in keeping with the
persons and the matter in dispute, for then it would be praiseworthy,
hence Tully says (De Rhet. ad Heren. iii) that "contention is a sharp
speech suitable for proof and refutation"---or whether it exceeds the
demands of the persons and matter in dispute, in which case it is
blameworthy.

Accordingly if we take contention as denoting a disclaimer of the truth
and an inordinate manner, it is a mortal sin. Thus Ambrose \[\*Cf.
Gloss. Ord. in Rom. i, 29\] defines contention: "Contention is a
disclaimer of the truth with clamorous confidence." If, however,
contention denote a disavowal of what is false, with the proper measure
of acrimony, it is praiseworthy: whereas, if it denote a disavowal of
falsehood, together with an inordinate manner, it can be a venial sin,
unless the contention be conducted so inordinately, as to give scandal
to others. Hence the Apostle after saying (<span
id="SS_Q38_A1-p9.1"></span>[2 Tim.
2:14](../../../bib/vul/ti2002.htm#014).md): "Contend not in words," adds,
"for it is to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers."

**Reply to Objection 1:** The disciples of Christ contended together,
not with the intention of disclaiming the truth, since each one stood up
for what he thought was true. Yet there was inordinateness in their
contention, because they contended about a matter which they ought not
to have contended about, viz. the primacy of honor; for they were not
spiritual men as yet, as a gloss says on the same passage; and for this
reason Our Lord checked them.

**Reply to Objection 2:** Those who preached Christ "out of contention,"
were to be blamed, because, although they did not gainsay the truth of
faith, but preached it, yet they did gainsay the truth, by the fact that
they thought they would "raise affliction" to the Apostle who was
preaching the truth of faith. Hence the Apostle rejoiced not in their
contention, but in the fruit that would result therefrom, namely that
Christ would be made known---since evil is sometimes the occasion of
good results.

**Reply to Objection 3:** Contention is complete and is a mortal sin
when, in contending before a judge, a man gainsays the truth of justice,
or in a disputation, intends to impugn the true doctrine. In this sense
Catholics do not contend against heretics, but the reverse. But when,
whether in court or in a disputation, it is incomplete, i.e. in respect
of the acrimony of speech, it is not always a mortal sin.

**Reply to Objection 4:** Contention here denotes an ordinary dispute.
For Job had said (13:3): "I will speak to the Almighty, and I desire to
reason with God": yet he intended not to impugn the truth, but to defend
it, and in seeking the truth thus, he had no wish to be inordinate in
mind or in speech.

#### Whether contention is a daughter of vainglory?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that contention is not a daughter of
vainglory. For contention is akin to zeal, wherefore it is written
(<span id="SS_Q38_A2-p2.1"></span>[1 Cor.
3:3](../../../bib/vul/co1003.htm#003).md): "Whereas there is among you zeal
\[Douay: 'envying'\] and contention, are you not carnal, and walk
according to men?" Now zeal pertains to envy. Therefore contention
arises rather from envy.

**Objection 2:** Further, contention is accompanied by raising of the
voice. But the voice is raised on account of anger, as Gregory declares
(Moral. xxxi, 14). Therefore contention too arises from anger.

**Objection 3:** Further, among other things knowledge seems to be the
matter of pride and vainglory, according to <span
id="SS_Q38_A2-p4.1"></span>[1 Cor.
8:1](../../../bib/vul/co1008.htm#001.md): "Knowledge puffeth up." Now
contention is often due to lack of knowledge, and by knowledge we do not
impugn the truth, we know it. Therefore contention is not a daughter of
vainglory.

On the contrary stands the authority of Gregory (Moral. xxxi, 14).

**I answer that,** As stated above (Q\[37\], A\[2\]), discord is a
daughter of vainglory, because each of the disaccording parties clings
to his own opinion, rather than acquiesce with the other. Now it is
proper to pride and vainglory to seek one's own glory. And just as
people are discordant when they hold to their own opinion in their
hearts, so are they contentious when each defends his own opinion by
words. Consequently contention is reckoned a daughter of vainglory for
the same reason as discord.

**Reply to Objection 1:** Contention, like discord, is akin to envy in
so far as a man severs himself from the one with whom he is discordant,
or with whom he contends, but in so far as a contentious man holds to
something, it is akin to pride and vainglory, because, to wit, he clings
to his own opinion, as stated above (Q\[37\], A\[2\], ad 1).

**Reply to Objection 2:** The contention of which we are speaking puts
on a loud voice, for the purpose of impugning the truth, so that it is
not the chief part of contention. Hence it does not follow that
contention arises from the same source as the raising of the voice.

**Reply to Objection 3:** Pride and vainglory are occasioned chiefly by
goods even those that are contrary to them, for instance, when a man is
proud of his humility: for when a thing arises in this way, it does so
not directly but accidentally, in which way nothing hinders one contrary
from arising out of another. Hence there is no reason why the "per se"
and direct effects of pride or vainglory, should not result from the
contraries of those things which are the occasion of pride.
