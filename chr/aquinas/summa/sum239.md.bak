### OF THE CEREMONIAL PRECEPTS IN THEMSELVES (FOUR ARTICLES)

We must now consider the ceremonial precepts: and first we must consider
them in themselves; secondly, their cause; thirdly, their duration.
Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:

\(1\) The nature of the ceremonial precepts;

\(2\) Whether they are figurative?

\(3\) Whether there should have been many of them?

\(4\) Of their various kinds.

#### Whether the nature of the ceremonial precepts consists in their pertaining to the worship of God?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that the nature of the ceremonial
precepts does not consist in their pertaining to the worship of God.
Because, in the Old Law, the Jews were given certain precepts about
abstinence from food (<span id="FS_Q101_A1-p2.1"></span>[Lev.
11](../../../bib/vul/lev011.htm#000).md); and about refraining from certain
kinds of clothes, e.g. (<span id="FS_Q101_A1-p2.2"></span>[Lev.
19:19](../../../bib/vul/lev019.htm#019).md): "Thou shalt not wear a garment
that is woven of two sorts"; and again (<span
id="FS_Q101_A1-p2.3"></span>[Num.
15:38](../../../bib/vul/num015.htm#038).md): "To make to themselves fringes
in the corners of their garments." But these are not moral precepts;
since they do not remain in the New Law. Nor are they judicial precepts;
since they do not pertain to the pronouncing of judgment between man and
man. Therefore they are ceremonial precepts. Yet they seem in no way to
pertain to the worship of God. Therefore the nature of the ceremonial
precepts does not consist in their pertaining to Divine worship.

**Objection 2:** Further, some state that the ceremonial precepts are
those which pertain to solemnities; as though they were so called from
the "cerei" \[candles\] which are lit up on those occasions. But many
other things besides solemnities pertain to the worship of God.
Therefore it does not seem that the ceremonial precepts are so called
from their pertaining to the Divine worship.

**Objection 3:** Further, some say that the ceremonial precepts are
patterns, i.e. rules, of salvation: because the Greek is the same as the
Latin "salve." But all the precepts of the Law are rules of salvation,
and not only those that pertain to the worship of God. Therefore not
only those precepts which pertain to Divine worship are called
ceremonial.

**Objection 4:** Further, Rabbi Moses says (Doct. Perplex. iii) that the
ceremonial precepts are those for which there is no evident reason. But
there is evident reason for many things pertaining to the worship of
God; such as the observance of the Sabbath, the feasts of the Passover
and of the Tabernacles, and many other things, the reason for which is
set down in the Law. Therefore the ceremonial precepts are not those
which pertain to the worship of God.

**On the contrary,** It is written (<span
id="FS_Q101_A1-p6.1"></span>[Exod.
18:19](../../../bib/vul/exo018.htm#019.md),
[20](../../../bib/vul/exo018.htm#020).md): "Be thou to the people in those
things that pertain to God . . . and . . . shew the people the
ceremonies and the manner of worshipping."

**I answer that,** As stated above (Q\[99\], A\[4\]), the ceremonial
precepts are determinations of the moral precepts whereby man is
directed to God, just as the judicial precepts are determinations of the
moral precepts whereby he is directed to his neighbor. Now man is
directed to God by the worship due to Him. Wherefore those precepts are
properly called ceremonial, which pertain to the Divine worship. The
reason for their being so called was given above (Q\[99\], A\[3\]), when
we established the distinction between the ceremonial and the other
precepts.

**Reply to Objection 1:** The Divine worship includes not only
sacrifices and the like, which seem to be directed to God immediately,
but also those things whereby His worshippers are duly prepared to
worship Him: thus too in other matters, whatever is preparatory to the
end comes under the science whose object is the end. Accordingly those
precepts of the Law which regard the clothing and food of God's
worshippers, and other such matters, pertain to a certain preparation of
the ministers, with the view of fitting them for the Divine worship:
just as those who administer to a king make use of certain special
observances. Consequently such are contained under the ceremonial
precepts.

**Reply to Objection 2:** The alleged explanation of the name does not
seem very probable: especially as the Law does not contain many
instances of the lighting of candles in solemnities; since, even the
lamps of the Candlestick were furnished with "oil of olives," as stated
in<span id="FS_Q101_A1-p9.1"></span> [Lev.
24:2.](../../../bib/vul/lev024.htm#002.md) Nevertheless we may say that all
things pertaining to the Divine worship were more carefully observed on
solemn festivals: so that all ceremonial precepts may be included under
the observance of solemnities.

**Reply to Objection 3:** Neither does this explanation of the name
appear to be very much to the point, since the word "ceremony" is not
Greek but Latin. We may say, however, that, since man's salvation is
from God, those precepts above all seem to be rules of salvation, which
direct man to God: and accordingly those which refer to Divine worship
are called ceremonial precepts.

**Reply to Objection 4:** This explanation of the ceremonial precepts
has a certain amount of probability: not that they are called ceremonial
precisely because there is no evident reason for them; this is a kind of
consequence. For, since the precepts referring to the Divine worship
must needs be figurative, as we shall state further on (A\[2\]), the
consequence is that the reason for them is not so very evident.

#### Whether the ceremonial precepts are figurative?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that the ceremonial precepts are not
figurative. For it is the duty of every teacher to express himself in
such a way as to be easily understood, as Augustine states (De Doctr.
Christ. iv, 4,10) and this seems very necessary in the framing of a law:
because precepts of law are proposed to the populace; for which reason a
law should be manifest, as Isidore declares (Etym. v, 21). If therefore
the precepts of the Law were given as figures of something, it seems
unbecoming that Moses should have delivered these precepts without
explaining what they signified.

**Objection 2:** Further, whatever is done for the worship of God,
should be entirely free from unfittingness. But the performance of
actions in representation of others, seems to savor of the theatre or of
the drama: because formerly the actions performed in theatres were done
to represent the actions of others. Therefore it seems that such things
should not be done for the worship of God. But the ceremonial precepts
are ordained to the Divine worship, as stated above (A\[1\]). Therefore
they should not be figurative.

**Objection 3:** Further, Augustine says (Enchiridion iii, iv) that "God
is worshipped chiefly by faith, hope, and charity." But the precepts of
faith, hope, and charity are not figurative. Therefore the ceremonial
precepts should not be figurative.

**Objection 4:** Further, Our Lord said (<span
id="FS_Q101_A2-p5.1"></span>[Jn.
4:24](../../../bib/vul/joh004.htm#024).md): "God is a spirit, and they that
adore Him, must adore Him in spirit and in truth." But a figure is not
the very truth: in fact one is condivided with the other. Therefore the
ceremonial precepts, which refer to the Divine worship, should not be
figurative.

**On the contrary,** The Apostle says (<span
id="FS_Q101_A2-p6.1"></span>[Col.
2:16](../../../bib/vul/col002.htm#016.md),
[17](../../../bib/vul/col002.htm#017).md): "Let no man . . . judge you in
meat or in drink, or in respect of a festival day, or of the new moon,
or of the sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come."

**I answer that,** As stated above (A\[1\]; Q\[99\], AA\[3\],4), the
ceremonial precepts are those which refer to the worship of God. Now the
Divine worship is twofold: internal, and external. For since man is
composed of soul and body, each of these should be applied to the
worship of God; the soul by an interior worship; the body by an outward
worship: hence it is written (<span id="FS_Q101_A2-p7.2"></span>[Ps.
83:3](../../../bib/vul/psa083.htm#003).md): "My heart and my flesh have
rejoiced in the living God." And as the body is ordained to God through
the soul, so the outward worship is ordained to the internal worship.
Now interior worship consists in the soul being united to God by the
intellect and affections. Wherefore according to the various ways in
which the intellect and affections of the man who worships God are
rightly united to God, his external actions are applied in various ways
to the Divine worship.

For in the state of future bliss, the human intellect will gaze on the
Divine Truth in Itself. Wherefore the external worship will not consist
in anything figurative, but solely in the praise of God, proceeding from
the inward knowledge and affection, according to<span
id="FS_Q101_A2-p8.1"></span> [Is.
51:3](../../../bib/vul/isa051.htm#003.md): "Joy and gladness shall be found
therein, thanksgiving and the voice of praise."

But in the present state of life, we are unable to gaze on the Divine
Truth in Itself, and we need the ray of Divine light to shine upon us
under the form of certain sensible figures, as Dionysius states (Coel.
Hier. i); in various ways, however, according to the various states of
human knowledge. For under the Old Law, neither was the Divine Truth
manifest in Itself, nor was the way leading to that manifestation as yet
opened out, as the Apostle declares (<span
id="FS_Q101_A2-p9.1"></span>[Heb.
9:8](../../../bib/vul/heb009.htm#008).md). Hence the external worship of
the Old Law needed to be figurative not only of the future truth to be
manifested in our heavenly country, but also of Christ, Who is the way
leading to that heavenly manifestation. But under the New Law this way
is already revealed: and therefore it needs no longer to be foreshadowed
as something future, but to be brought to our minds as something past or
present: and the truth of the glory to come, which is not yet revealed,
alone needs to be foreshadowed. This is what the Apostle says (<span
id="FS_Q101_A2-p9.2"></span>[Heb.
11:1](../../../bib/vul/heb011.htm#001).md): "The Law has \[Vulg.:
'having'\] a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of
the things": for a shadow is less than an image; so that the image
belongs to the New Law, but the shadow to the Old.

**Reply to Objection 1:** The things of God are not to be revealed to
man except in proportion to his capacity: else he would be in danger of
downfall, were he to despise what he cannot grasp. Hence it was more
beneficial that the Divine mysteries should be revealed to uncultured
people under a veil of figures, that thus they might know them at least
implicitly by using those figures to the honor of God.

**Reply to Objection 2:** Just as human reason fails to grasp poetical
expressions on account of their being lacking in truth, so does it fail
to grasp Divine things perfectly, on account of the sublimity of the
truth they contain: and therefore in both cases there is need of signs
by means of sensible figures.

**Reply to Objection 3:** Augustine is speaking there of internal
worship; to which, however, external worship should be ordained, as
stated above.

The same answer applies to the Fourth Objection: because men were taught
by Him to practice more perfectly the spiritual worship of God.

#### Whether there should have been man ceremonial precepts?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that there should not have been many
ceremonial precepts. For those things which conduce to an end should be
proportionate to that end. But the ceremonial precepts, as stated above
(AA\[1\],2), are ordained to the worship of God, and to the
foreshadowing of Christ. Now "there is but one God, of Whom are all
things . . . and one Lord Jesus Christ, by Whom are all things" (<span
id="FS_Q101_A3-p2.2"></span>[1 Cor.
8:6](../../../bib/vul/co1008.htm#006).md). Therefore there should not have
been many ceremonial precepts.

**Objection 2:** Further, the great number of the ceremonial precepts
was an occasion of transgression, according to the words of Peter (<span
id="FS_Q101_A3-p3.1"></span>[Acts
15:10](../../../bib/vul/act015.htm#010).md): "Why tempt you God, to put a
yoke upon the necks of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we
have been able to bear?" Now the transgression of the Divine precepts is
an obstacle to man's salvation. Since, therefore, every law should
conduce to man's salvation, as Isidore says (Etym. v, 3), it seems that
the ceremonial precepts should not have been given in great number.

**Objection 3:** Further, the ceremonial precepts referred to the
outward and bodily worship of God, as stated above (A\[2\]). But the Law
should have lessened this bodily worship: since it directed men to
Christ, Who taught them to worship God "in spirit and in truth," as
stated in<span id="FS_Q101_A3-p4.2"></span> [Jn.
4:23.](../../../bib/vul/joh004.htm#023.md) Therefore there should not have
been many ceremonial precepts.

**On the contrary,** (<span id="FS_Q101_A3-p5.1"></span>[Osee
8:12](../../../bib/vul/hos008.htm#012).md): "I shall write to them \[Vulg.:
'him'\] My manifold laws"; and (<span id="FS_Q101_A3-p5.2"></span>[Job
11:6](../../../bib/vul/job011.htm#006).md): "That He might show thee the
secrets of His wisdom, and that His Law is manifold."

**I answer that,** As stated above (Q\[96\], A\[1\]), every law is given
to a people. Now a people contains two kinds of men: some, prone to
evil, who have to be coerced by the precepts of the law, as stated above
(Q\[95\], A\[1\]); some, inclined to good, either from nature or from
custom, or rather from grace; and the like have to be taught and
improved by means of the precepts of the law. Accordingly, with regard
to both kinds of the law. Accordingly, with regard to both kinds of men
it was expedient that the Old Law should contain many ceremonial
precepts. For in that people there were many prone to idolatry;
wherefore it was necessary to recall them by means of ceremonial
precepts from the worship of idols to the worship of God. And since men
served idols in many ways, it was necessary on the other hand to devise
many means of repressing every single one: and again, to lay many
obligations on such like men, in order that being burdened, as it were,
by their duties to the Divine worship, they might have no time for the
service of idols. As to those who were inclined to good, it was again
necessary that there should be many ceremonial precepts; both because
thus their mind turned to God in many ways, and more continually; and
because the mystery of Christ, which was foreshadowed by these
ceremonial precepts, brought many boons to the world, and afforded men
many considerations, which needed to be signified by various ceremonies.

**Reply to Objection 1:** When that which conduces to an end is
sufficient to conduce thereto, then one such thing suffices for one end:
thus one remedy, if it be efficacious, suffices sometimes to restore men
to health, and then the remedy needs not to be repeated. But when that
which conduces to an end is weak and imperfect, it needs to be
multiplied: thus many remedies are given to a sick man, when one is not
enough to heal him. Now the ceremonies of the Old Law were weak and
imperfect, both for representing the mystery of Christ, on account of
its surpassing excellence; and for subjugating men's minds to God. Hence
the Apostle says (<span id="FS_Q101_A3-p7.1"></span>[Heb.
7:18](../../../bib/vul/heb007.htm#018.md),
[19](../../../bib/vul/heb007.htm#019).md): "There is a setting aside of the
former commandment because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof,
for the law brought nothing to perfection." Consequently these
ceremonies needed to be in great number.

**Reply to Objection 2:** A wise lawgiver should suffer lesser
transgressions, that the greater may be avoided. And therefore, in order
to avoid the sin of idolatry, and the pride which would arise in the
hearts of the Jews, were they to fulfil all the precepts of the Law, the
fact that they would in consequence find many occasions of disobedience
did not prevent God from giving them many ceremonial precepts.

**Reply to Objection 3:** The Old Law lessened bodily worship in many
ways. Thus it forbade sacrifices to be offered in every place and by any
person. Many such like things did it enact for the lessening of bodily
worship; as Rabbi Moses, the Egyptian testifies (Doct. Perplex. iii).
Nevertheless it behooved not to attenuate the bodily worship of God so
much as to allow men to fall away into the worship of idols.

#### Whether the ceremonies of the Old Law are suitably divided into sacrifices, sacred things, sacraments, and observances?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that the ceremonies of the Old Law are
unsuitably divided into "sacrifices, sacred things, sacraments, and
observances." For the ceremonies of the Old Law foreshadowed Christ. But
this was done only by the sacrifices, which foreshadowed the sacrifice
in which Christ "delivered Himself an oblation and a sacrifice to God"
(<span id="FS_Q101_A4-p2.1"></span>[Eph.
5:2](../../../bib/vul/eph005.htm#002).md). Therefore none but the
sacrifices were ceremonies.

**Objection 2:** Further, the Old Law was ordained to the New. But in
the New Law the sacrifice is the Sacrament of the Altar. Therefore in
the Old Law there should be no distinction between "sacrifices" and
"sacraments."

**Objection 3:** Further, a "sacred thing" is something dedicated to
God: in which sense the tabernacle and its vessels were said to be
consecrated. But all the ceremonial precepts were ordained to the
worship of God, as stated above (A\[1\]). Therefore all ceremonies were
sacred things. Therefore "sacred things" should not be taken as a part
of the ceremonies.

**Objection 4:** Further, "observances" are so called from having to be
observed. But all the precepts of the Law had to be observed: for it is
written (<span id="FS_Q101_A4-p5.1"></span>[Dt.
8:11](../../../bib/vul/deu008.htm#011).md): "Observe \[Douay: 'Take heed'\]
and beware lest at any time thou forget the Lord thy God, and neglect
His commandments and judgments and ceremonies." Therefore the
"observances" should not be considered as a part of the ceremonies.

**Objection 5:** Further, the solemn festivals are reckoned as part of
the ceremonial: since they were a shadow of things to come (<span
id="FS_Q101_A4-p6.1"></span>[Col.
2:16](../../../bib/vul/col002.htm#016.md),
[17](../../../bib/vul/col002.htm#017).md): and the same may be said of the
oblations and gifts, as appears from the words of the Apostle (<span
id="FS_Q101_A4-p6.2"></span>[Heb.
9:9](../../../bib/vul/heb009.htm#009).md): and yet these do not seem to be
inclined in any of those mentioned above. Therefore the above division
of ceremonies is unsuitable.

**On the contrary,** In the Old Law each of the above is called a
ceremony. For the sacrifices are called ceremonies (<span
id="FS_Q101_A4-p7.1"></span>[Num.
15:24](../../../bib/vul/num015.htm#024).md): "They shall offer a calf . . .
and the sacrifices and libations thereof, as the ceremonies require." Of
the sacrament of Order it is written (<span
id="FS_Q101_A4-p7.2"></span>[Lev.
7:35](../../../bib/vul/lev007.htm#035).md): "This is the anointing of Aaron
and his sons in the ceremonies." Of sacred things also it is written
(<span id="FS_Q101_A4-p7.3"></span>[Ex.
38:21](../../../bib/vul/exo038.htm#021).md): "These are the instruments of
the tabernacle of the testimony . . . in the ceremonies of the Levites."
And again of the observances it is written (3 Kings 9:6): "If you . . .
shall turn away from following Me, and will not observe \[Douay:
'keep'\] My . . . ceremonies which I have set before you."

**I answer that,** As stated above (AA\[1\],2), the ceremonial precepts
are ordained to the Divine worship. Now in this worship we may consider
the worship itself, the worshippers, and the instruments of worship. The
worship consists specially in "sacrifices," which are offered up in
honor of God. The instruments of worship refer to the "sacred things,"
such as the tabernacle, the vessels and so forth. With regard to the
worshippers two points may be considered. The first point is their
preparation for Divine worship, which is effected by a sort of
consecration either of the people or of the ministers; and to this the
"sacraments" refer. The second point is their particular mode of life,
whereby they are distinguished from those who do not worship God: and to
this pertain the "observances," for instance, in matters of food,
clothing, and so forth.

**Reply to Objection 1:** It was necessary for the sacrifices to be
offered both in some certain place and by some certain men: and all this
pertained to the worship of God. Wherefore just as their sacrifices
signified Christ the victim, so too their sacraments and sacred things
of the New Law; while their observances foreshadowed the mode of life of
the people under the New Law: all of which things pertain to Christ.

**Reply to Objection 2:** The sacrifice of the New Law, viz. the
Eucharist, contains Christ Himself, the Author of our Sanctification:
for He sanctified "the people by His own blood" (<span
id="FS_Q101_A4-p10.1"></span>[Heb.
13:12](../../../bib/vul/heb013.htm#012).md). Hence this Sacrifice is also a
sacrament. But the sacrifices of the Old Law did not contain Christ, but
foreshadowed Him; hence they are not called sacraments. In order to
signify this there were certain sacraments apart from the sacrifices of
the Old Law, which sacraments were figures of the sanctification to
come. Nevertheless to certain consecrations certain sacrifices were
united.

**Reply to Objection 3:** The sacrifices and sacraments were of course
sacred things. But certain things were sacred, through being dedicated
to the Divine worship, and yet were not sacrifices or sacraments:
wherefore they retained the common designation of sacred things.

**Reply to Objection 4:** Those things which pertained to the mode of
life of the people who worshipped God, retained the common designation
of observances, in so far as they fell short of the above. For they were
not called sacred things, because they had no immediate connection with
the worship of God, such as the tabernacle and its vessels had. But by a
sort of consequence they were matters of ceremony, in so far as they
affected the fitness of the people who worshipped God.

**Reply to Objection 5:** Just as the sacrifices were offered in a fixed
place, so were they offered at fixed times: for which reason the solemn
festivals seem to be reckoned among the sacred things. The oblations and
gifts are counted together with the sacrifices; hence the Apostle says
(<span id="FS_Q101_A4-p13.1"></span>[Heb.
5:1](../../../bib/vul/heb005.htm#001).md): "Every high-priest taken from
among men, is ordained for men in things that appertain to God, that he
may offer up gifts and sacrifices."

ARTICLES)](sum240.md)
