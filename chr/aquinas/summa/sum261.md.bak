### OF THE CAUSE OF FAITH (TWO ARTICLES)

We must now consider the cause of faith, under which head there are two
points of inquiry:

\(1\) Whether faith is infused into man by God?

\(2\) Whether lifeless faith is a gift of God?

#### Whether faith is infused into man by God?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that faith is not infused into man by
God. For Augustine says (De Trin. xiv) that "science begets faith in us,
and nourishes, defends and strengthens it." Now those things which
science begets in us seem to be acquired rather than infused. Therefore
faith does not seem to be in us by Divine infusion.

**Objection 2:** Further, that to which man attains by hearing and
seeing, seems to be acquired by him. Now man attains to belief, both by
seeing miracles, and by hearing the teachings of faith: for it is
written (<span id="SS_Q6_A1-p3.1"></span>[Jn.
4:53](../../../bib/vul/joh004.htm#053).md): "The father . . . knew that it
was at the same hour, that Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth; and
himself believed, and his whole house"; and (<span
id="SS_Q6_A1-p3.2"></span>[Rom. 10:17](../../../bib/vul/rom010.htm#017).md)
it is said that "faith is through hearing." Therefore man attains to
faith by acquiring it.

**Objection 3:** Further, that which depends on a man's will can be
acquired by him. But "faith depends on the believer's will," according
to Augustine (De Praedest. Sanct. v). Therefore faith can be acquired by
man.

**On the contrary,** It is written (<span
id="SS_Q6_A1-p5.1"></span>[Eph. 2:8](../../../bib/vul/eph002.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/vul/eph002.htm#009).md): "By grace you are saved through
faith, and that not of yourselves . . . that no man may glory . . . for
it is the gift of God."

**I answer that,** Two things are requisite for faith. First, that the
things which are of faith should be proposed to man: this is necessary
in order that man believe anything explicitly. The second thing
requisite for faith is the assent of the believer to the things which
are proposed to him. Accordingly, as regards the first of these, faith
must needs be from God. Because those things which are of faith surpass
human reason, hence they do not come to man's knowledge, unless God
reveal them. To some, indeed, they are revealed by God immediately, as
those things which were revealed to the apostles and prophets, while to
some they are proposed by God in sending preachers of the faith,
according to <span id="SS_Q6_A1-p6.1"></span>[Rom.
10:15](../../../bib/vul/rom010.htm#015.md): "How shall they preach, unless
they be sent?"

As regards the second, viz. man's assent to the things which are of
faith, we may observe a twofold cause, one of external inducement, such
as seeing a miracle, or being persuaded by someone to embrace the faith:
neither of which is a sufficient cause, since of those who see the same
miracle, or who hear the same sermon, some believe, and some do not.
Hence we must assert another internal cause, which moves man inwardly to
assent to matters of faith.

The Pelagians held that this cause was nothing else than man's
free-will: and consequently they said that the beginning of faith is
from ourselves, inasmuch as, to wit, it is in our power to be ready to
assent to things which are of faith, but that the consummation of faith
is from God, Who proposes to us the things we have to believe. But this
is false, for, since man, by assenting to matters of faith, is raised
above his nature, this must needs accrue to him from some supernatural
principle moving him inwardly; and this is God. Therefore faith, as
regards the assent which is the chief act of faith, is from God moving
man inwardly by grace.

**Reply to Objection 1:** Science begets and nourishes faith, by way of
external persuasion afforded by science; but the chief and proper cause
of faith is that which moves man inwardly to assent.

**Reply to Objection 2:** This argument again refers to the cause that
proposes outwardly the things that are of faith, or persuades man to
believe by words or deeds.

**Reply to Objection 3:** To believe does indeed depend on the will of
the believer: but man's will needs to be prepared by God with grace, in
order that he may be raised to things which are above his nature, as
stated above (Q\[2\] , A\[3\]).

#### Whether lifeless faith is a gift of God?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that lifeless faith is not a gift of God.
For it is written (<span id="SS_Q6_A2-p2.1"></span>[Dt.
32:4](../../../bib/vul/deu032.htm#004).md) that "the works of God are
perfect." Now lifeless faith is something imperfect. Therefore it is not
the work of God.

**Objection 2:** Further, just as an act is said to be deformed through
lacking its due form, so too is faith called lifeless \[informis\] when
it lacks the form due to it. Now the deformed act of sin is not from
God, as stated above (FS, Q\[79\], A\[2\], ad 2). Therefore neither is
lifeless faith from God.

**Objection 3:** Further, whomsoever God heals, He heals wholly: for it
is written (<span id="SS_Q6_A2-p4.1"></span>[Jn.
7:23](../../../bib/vul/joh007.htm#023).md): "If a man receive circumcision
on the sabbath-day, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are you
angry at Me because I have healed the whole man on the sabbath-day?" Now
faith heals man from unbelief. Therefore whoever receives from God the
gift of faith, is at the same time healed from all his sins. But this is
not done except by living faith. Therefore living faith alone is a gift
of God: and consequently lifeless faith is not from God.

**On the contrary,** A gloss on <span id="SS_Q6_A2-p5.1"></span>[1 Cor.
13:2](../../../bib/vul/co1013.htm#002.md) says that "the faith which lacks
charity is a gift of God." Now this is lifeless faith. Therefore
lifeless faith is a gift of God.

**I answer that,** Lifelessness is a privation. Now it must be noted
that privation is sometimes essential to the species, whereas sometimes
it is not, but supervenes in a thing already possessed of its proper
species: thus privation of the due equilibrium of the humors is
essential to the species of sickness, while darkness is not essential to
a diaphanous body, but supervenes in it. Since, therefore, when we
assign the cause of a thing, we intend to assign the cause of that thing
as existing in its proper species, it follows that what is not the cause
of privation, cannot be assigned as the cause of the thing to which that
privation belongs as being essential to its species. For we cannot
assign as the cause of a sickness, something which is not the cause of a
disturbance in the humors: though we can assign as cause of a diaphanous
body, something which is not the cause of the darkness, which is not
essential to the diaphanous body.

Now the lifelessness of faith is not essential to the species of faith,
since faith is said to be lifeless through lack of an extrinsic form, as
stated above (Q\[4\], A\[4\]). Consequently the cause of lifeless faith
is that which is the cause of faith strictly so called: and this is God,
as stated above (A\[1\]). It follows, therefore, that lifeless faith is
a gift of God.

**Reply to Objection 1:** Lifeless faith, though it is not simply
perfect with the perfection of a virtue, is, nevertheless, perfect with
a perfection that suffices for the essential notion of faith.

**Reply to Objection 2:** The deformity of an act is essential to the
act's species, considered as a moral act, as stated above (FP, Q\[48\],
A\[1\], ad 2; FS, Q\[18\], A\[5\]): for an act is said to be deformed
through being deprived of an intrinsic form, viz. the due commensuration
of the act's circumstances. Hence we cannot say that God is the cause of
a deformed act, for He is not the cause of its deformity, though He is
the cause of the act as such.

We may also reply that deformity denotes not only privation of a due
form, but also a contrary disposition, wherefore deformity is compared
to the act, as falsehood is to faith. Hence, just as the deformed act is
not from God, so neither is a false faith; and as lifeless faith is from
God, so too, acts that are good generically, though not quickened by
charity, as is frequently the case in sinners, are from God.

**Reply to Objection 3:** He who receives faith from God without
charity, is healed from unbelief, not entirely (because the sin of his
previous unbelief is not removed) but in part, namely, in the point of
ceasing from committing such and such a sin. Thus it happens frequently
that a man desists from one act of sin, through God causing him thus to
desist, without desisting from another act of sin, through the
instigation of his own malice. And in this way sometimes it is granted
by God to a man to believe, and yet he is not granted the gift of
charity: even so the gift of prophecy, or the like, is given to some
without charity.
