### OF THE GRACE OF TONGUES (TWO ARTICLES)

We must now consider those gratuitous graces that pertain to speech, and
(1) the grace of tongues; (2) the grace of the word of wisdom and
knowledge. Under the first head there are two points of inquiry:

\(1\) Whether by the grace of tongues a man acquires the knowledge of
all languages?

\(2\) Of the comparison between this gift and the grace of prophecy.

#### Whether those who received the gift of tongues spoke in every language?

**Objection 1:** It seems that those who received the gift of tongues
did not speak in every language. For that which is granted to certain
persons by the divine power is the best of its kind: thus our Lord
turned the water into good wine, as stated in<span
id="SS_Q176_A1-p2.1"></span> [Jn.
2:10.](../../../bib/vul/joh002.htm#010.md) Now those who had the gift of
tongues spoke better in their own language; since a gloss on <span
id="SS_Q176_A1-p2.2"></span>[Heb. 1](../../../bib/vul/heb001.htm#000.md),
says that "it is not surprising that the epistle to the Hebrews is more
graceful in style than the other epistles, since it is natural for a man
to have more command over his own than over a strange language. For the
Apostle wrote the other epistles in a foreign, namely the Greek, idiom;
whereas he wrote this in the Hebrew tongue." Therefore the apostles did
not receive the knowledge of all languages by a gratuitous grace.

**Objection 2:** Further, nature does not employ many means where one is
sufficient; and much less does God Whose work is more orderly than
nature's. Now God could make His disciples to be understood by all,
while speaking one tongue: hence a gloss on<span
id="SS_Q176_A1-p3.1"></span> [Acts
2:6,](../../../bib/vul/act002.htm#006.md) "Every man heard them speak in
his own tongue," says that "they spoke in every tongue, or speaking in
their own, namely the Hebrew language, were understood by all, as though
they spoke the language proper to each." Therefore it would seem that
they had not the knowledge to speak in all languages.

**Objection 3:** Further, all graces flow from Christ to His body, which
is the Church, according to<span id="SS_Q176_A1-p4.1"></span> [Jn.
1:16,](../../../bib/vul/joh001.htm#016.md) "Of His fullness we all have
received." Now we do not read that Christ spoke more than one language,
nor does each one of the faithful now speak save in one tongue.
Therefore it would seem that Christ's disciples did not receive the
grace to the extent of speaking in all languages.

**On the contrary,** It is written (<span
id="SS_Q176_A1-p5.1"></span>[Acts 2:4](../../../bib/vul/act002.htm#004).md)
that "they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they began to speak
with divers tongues, according as the Holy Ghost gave them to speak"; on
which passage a gloss of Gregory \[\*Hom. xxx in Ev.\] says that "the
Holy Ghost appeared over the disciples under the form of fiery tongues,
and gave them the knowledge of all tongues."

**I answer that,** Christ's first disciples were chosen by Him in order
that they might disperse throughout the whole world, and preach His
faith everywhere, according to<span id="SS_Q176_A1-p6.1"></span> [Mat.
28:19,](../../../bib/vul/mat028.htm#019.md) "Going . . . teach ye all
nations." Now it was not fitting that they who were being sent to teach
others should need to be taught by others, either as to how they should
speak to other people, or as to how they were to understand those who
spoke to them; and all the more seeing that those who were being sent
were of one nation, that of Judea, according to<span
id="SS_Q176_A1-p6.2"></span> [Is.
27:6,](../../../bib/vul/isa027.htm#006.md) "When they shall rush out from
Jacob \[\*Vulg.: 'When they shall rush in unto Jacob,' etc.\] . . . they
shall fill the face of the world with seed." Moreover those who were
being sent were poor and powerless; nor at the outset could they have
easily found someone to interpret their words faithfully to others, or
to explain what others said to them, especially as they were sent to
unbelievers. Consequently it was necessary, in this respect, that God
should provide them with the gift of tongues; in order that, as the
diversity of tongues was brought upon the nations when they fell away to
idolatry, according to <span id="SS_Q176_A1-p6.3"></span>[Gn.
11](../../../bib/vul/gen011.htm#000.md), so when the nations were to be
recalled to the worship of one God a remedy to this diversity might be
applied by the gift of tongues.

**Reply to Objection 1:** As it is written (<span
id="SS_Q176_A1-p7.1"></span>[1 Cor.
12:7](../../../bib/vul/co1012.htm#007).md), "the manifestation of the
Spirit is given to every man unto profit"; and consequently both Paul
and the other apostles were divinely instructed in the languages of all
nations sufficiently for the requirements of the teaching of the faith.
But as regards the grace and elegance of style which human art adds to a
language, the Apostle was instructed in his own, but not in a foreign
tongue. Even so they were sufficiently instructed in wisdom and
scientific knowledge, as required for teaching the faith, but not as to
all things known by acquired science, for instance the conclusions of
arithmetic and geometry.

**Reply to Objection 2:** Although either was possible, namely that,
while speaking in one tongue they should be understood by all, or that
they should speak in all tongues, it was more fitting that they should
speak in all tongues, because this pertained to the perfection of their
knowledge, whereby they were able not only to speak, but also to
understand what was said by others. Whereas if their one language were
intelligible to all, this would either have been due to the knowledge of
those who understood their speech, or it would have amounted to an
illusion, since a man's words would have had a different sound in
another's ears, from that with which they were uttered. Hence a gloss
says on<span id="SS_Q176_A1-p8.1"></span> [Acts
2:6](../../../bib/vul/act002.htm#006.md) that "it was a greater miracle
that they should speak all kinds of tongues"; and Paul says (<span
id="SS_Q176_A1-p8.2"></span>[1 Cor.
14:18](../../../bib/vul/co1014.htm#018).md): "I thank my God I speak with
all your tongues."

**Reply to Objection 3:** Christ in His own person purposed preaching to
only one nation, namely the Jews. Consequently, although without any
doubt He possessed most perfectly the knowledge of all languages, there
was no need for Him to speak in every tongue. And therefore, as
Augustine says (Tract. xxxii in Joan.), "whereas even now the Holy Ghost
is received, yet no one speaks in the tongues of all nations, because
the Church herself already speaks the languages of all nations: since
whoever is not in the Church, receives not the Holy Ghost."

#### Whether the gift of tongues is more excellent than the grace of prophecy?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that the gift of tongues is more
excellent than the grace of prophecy. For, seemingly, better things are
proper to better persons, according to the Philosopher (Topic. iii, 1).
Now the gift of tongues is proper to the New Testament, hence we sing in
the sequence of Pentecost \[\*The sequence: 'Sancti Spiritus adsit nobis
gratia' ascribed to King Robert of France, the reputed author of the
'Veni Sancte Spiritus.' Cf. Migne, Patr. Lat. tom. CXLI\]: "On this day
Thou gavest Christ's apostles an unwonted gift, a marvel to all time":
whereas prophecy is more pertinent to the Old Testament, according
to<span id="SS_Q176_A2-p2.1"></span> [Heb.
1:1,](../../../bib/vul/heb001.htm#001.md) "God Who at sundry times and in
divers manners spoke in times past to the fathers by the prophets."
Therefore it would seem that the gift of tongues is more excellent than
the gift of prophecy.

**Objection 2:** Further, that whereby we are directed to God is
seemingly more excellent than that whereby we are directed to men. Now,
by the gift of tongues, man is directed to God, whereas by prophecy he
is directed to man; for it is written (<span
id="SS_Q176_A2-p3.1"></span>[1 Cor.
14:2](../../../bib/vul/co1014.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/vul/co1014.htm#003).md): "He that speaketh in a tongue,
speaketh not unto men, but unto God . . . but he that prophesieth,
speaketh unto men unto edification." Therefore it would seem that the
gift of tongues is more excellent than the gift of prophecy.

**Objection 3:** Further, the gift of tongues abides like a habit in the
person who has it, and "he can use it when he will"; wherefore it is
written (<span id="SS_Q176_A2-p4.1"></span>[1 Cor.
14:18](../../../bib/vul/co1014.htm#018).md): "I thank my God I speak with
all your tongues." But it is not so with the gift of prophecy, as stated
above (Q\[171\], A\[2\]). Therefore the gift of tongues would seem to be
more excellent than the gift of prophecy.

**Objection 4:** Further, the "interpretation of speeches" would seem to
be contained under prophecy, because the Scriptures are expounded by the
same Spirit from Whom they originated. Now the interpretation of
speeches is placed after "divers kinds of tongues" (<span
id="SS_Q176_A2-p5.1"></span>[1 Cor.
12:10](../../../bib/vul/co1012.htm#010).md). Therefore it seems that the
gift of tongues is more excellent than the gift of prophecy,
particularly as regards a part of the latter.

**On the contrary,** The Apostle says (<span
id="SS_Q176_A2-p6.1"></span>[1 Cor.
14:5](../../../bib/vul/co1014.htm#005).md): "Greater is he that prophesieth
than he that speaketh with tongues."

**I answer that,** The gift of prophecy surpasses the gift of tongues,
in three ways. First, because the gift of tongues regards the utterance
of certain words, which signify an intelligible truth, and this again is
signified by the phantasms which appear in an imaginary vision;
wherefore Augustine compares (Gen. ad lit. xii, 8) the gift of tongues
to an imaginary vision. On the other hand, it has been stated above
(Q\[173\], A\[2\]) that the gift of prophecy consists in the mind itself
being enlightened so as to know an intelligible truth. Wherefore, as the
prophetic enlightenment is more excellent than the imaginary vision, as
stated above (Q\[174\], A\[2\]), so also is prophecy more excellent than
the gift of tongues considered in itself. Secondly, because the gift of
prophecy regards the knowledge of things, which is more excellent than
the knowledge of words, to which the gift of tongues pertains.

Thirdly, because the gift of prophecy is more profitable. The Apostle
proves this in three ways (<span id="SS_Q176_A2-p8.1"></span>[1 Cor.
14](../../../bib/vul/co1014.htm#000).md); first, because prophecy is more
profitable to the edification of the Church, for which purpose he that
speaketh in tongues profiteth nothing, unless interpretation follow
(<span id="SS_Q176_A2-p8.2"></span>[1 Cor.
14:4](../../../bib/vul/co1014.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/vul/co1014.htm#005).md). Secondly, as regards the speaker
himself, for if he be enabled to speak in divers tongues without
understanding them, which pertains to the gift of prophecy, his own mind
would not be edified (<span id="SS_Q176_A2-p8.3"></span>[1 Cor.
14:7-14](../../../bib/vul/co1014.htm#007).md). Thirdly, as to unbelievers
for whose especial benefit the gift of tongues seems to have been given;
since perchance they might think those who speak in tongues to be mad
(<span id="SS_Q176_A2-p8.4"></span>[1 Cor.
14:23](../../../bib/vul/co1014.htm#023).md), for instance the Jews deemed
the apostles drunk when the latter spoke in various tongues (<span
id="SS_Q176_A2-p8.5"></span>[Acts
2:13](../../../bib/vul/act002.htm#013).md): whereas by prophecies the
unbeliever is convinced, because the secrets of his heart are made
manifest (<span id="SS_Q176_A2-p8.6"></span>[Acts
2:25](../../../bib/vul/act002.htm#025).md).

**Reply to Objection 1:** As stated above (Q\[174\], A\[3\], ad 1), it
belongs to the excellence of prophecy that a man is not only enlightened
by an intelligible light, but also that he should perceive an imaginary
vision: and so again it belongs to the perfection of the Holy Ghost's
operation, not only to fill the mind with the prophetic light, and the
imagination with the imaginary vision, as happened in the Old Testament,
but also to endow the tongue with external erudition, in the utterance
of various signs of speech. All this is done in the New Testament,
according to <span id="SS_Q176_A2-p9.2"></span>[1 Cor.
14:26,](../../../bib/vul/co1014.htm#026.md) "Every one of you hath a psalm,
hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation," i.e. a prophetic
revelation.

**Reply to Objection 2:** By the gift of prophecy man is directed to God
in his mind, which is more excellent than being directed to Him in his
tongue. "He that speaketh in a tongue "is said to speak "not unto men,"
i.e. to men's understanding or profit, but unto God's understanding and
praise. On the other hand, by prophecy a man is directed both to God and
to man; wherefore it is the more perfect gift.

**Reply to Objection 3:** Prophetic revelation extends to the knowledge
of all things supernatural; wherefore from its very perfection it
results that in this imperfect state of life it cannot be had perfectly
by way of habit, but only imperfectly by way of passion. on the other
hand, the gift of tongues is confined to a certain particular knowledge,
namely of human words; wherefore it is not inconsistent with the
imperfection of this life, that it should be had perfectly and by way of
habit.

**Reply to Objection 4:** The interpretation of speeches is reducible to
the gift of prophecy, inasmuch as the mind is enlightened so as to
understand and explain any obscurities of speech arising either from a
difficulty in the things signified, or from the words uttered being
unknown, or from the figures of speech employed, according to<span
id="SS_Q176_A2-p12.1"></span> [Dan.
5:16,](../../../bib/vul/dan005.htm#016.md) "I have heard of thee, that thou
canst interpret obscure things, and resolve difficult things." Hence the
interpretation of speeches is more excellent than the gift of tongues,
as appears from the saying of the Apostle (<span
id="SS_Q176_A2-p12.2"></span>[1 Cor.
14:5](../../../bib/vul/co1014.htm#005).md), "Greater is he that prophesieth
than he that speaketh with tongues; unless perhaps he interpret." Yet
the interpretation of speeches is placed after the gift of tongues,
because the interpretation of speeches extends even to the
interpretation of divers kinds of tongues.
