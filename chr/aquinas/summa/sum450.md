## PROLOGUE

Forasmuch as our Saviour the Lord Jesus Christ, in order to "save His
people from their sins" (<span id="TP.i-p1.1"></span>[Mat.
1:21](../../../bib/vul/mat001.htm#021).md), as the angel announced, showed
unto us in His own Person the way of truth, whereby we may attain to the
bliss of eternal life by rising again, it is necessary, in order to
complete the work of theology, that after considering the last end of
human life, and the virtues and vices, there should follow the
consideration of the Saviour of all, and of the benefits bestowed by Him
on the human race.

Concerning this we must consider (1) the Saviour Himself; (2) the
sacraments by which we attain to our salvation; (3) the end of immortal
life to which we attain by the resurrection.

Concerning the first, a double consideration occurs: the first, about
the mystery of the Incarnation itself, whereby God was made man for our
salvation; the second, about such things as were done and suffered by
our Saviour---i.e. God incarnate.
