### OF THE NEW LAW AS COMPARED WITH THE OLD (FOUR ARTICLES)

We must now consider the New Law as compared with the Old: under which
head there are four points of inquiry:

\(1\) Whether the New Law is distinct from the Old Law?

\(2\) Whether the New Law fulfils the Old?

\(3\) Whether the New Law is contained in the Old?

\(4\) Which is the more burdensome, the New or the Old Law?

#### Whether the New Law is distinct from the Old Law?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that the New Law is not distinct from the
Old. Because both these laws were given to those who believe in God:
since "without faith it is impossible to please God," according to<span
id="FS_Q107_A1-p2.1"></span> [Heb.
11:6.](../../../bib/vul/heb011.htm#006.md) But the faith of olden times and
of nowadays is the same, as the gloss says on<span
id="FS_Q107_A1-p2.2"></span> [Mat.
21:9.](../../../bib/vul/mat021.htm#009.md) Therefore the law is the same
also.

**Objection 2:** Further, Augustine says (Contra Adamant. Manich.
discip. xvii) that "there is little difference between the Law and
Gospel" \[\*The 'little difference' refers to the Latin words 'timor'
and 'amor'\]---"fear and love." But the New and Old Laws cannot be
differentiated in respect of these two things: since even the Old Law
comprised precepts of charity: "Thou shalt love thy neighbor" (<span
id="FS_Q107_A1-p3.1"></span>[Lev.
19:18](../../../bib/vul/lev019.htm#018).md), and: "Thou shalt love the Lord
thy God" (<span id="FS_Q107_A1-p3.2"></span>[Dt.
6:5](../../../bib/vul/deu006.htm#005).md). In like manner neither can they
differ according to the other difference which Augustine assigns (Contra
Faust. iv, 2), viz. that "the Old Testament contained temporal promises,
whereas the New Testament contains spiritual and eternal promises":
since even the New Testament contains temporal promises, according
to<span id="FS_Q107_A1-p3.3"></span> [Mk.
10:30](../../../bib/vul/mar010.htm#030.md): He shall receive "a hundred
times as much . . . in this time, houses and brethren," etc.: while in
the Old Testament they hoped in promises spiritual and eternal,
according to<span id="FS_Q107_A1-p3.4"></span> [Heb.
11:16](../../../bib/vul/heb011.htm#016.md): "But now they desire a better,
that is to say, a heavenly country," which is said of the patriarchs.
Therefore it seems that the New Law is not distinct from the Old.

**Objection 3:** Further, the Apostle seems to distinguish both laws by
calling the Old Law "a law of works," and the New Law "a law of faith"
(<span id="FS_Q107_A1-p4.1"></span>[Rom.
3:27](../../../bib/vul/rom003.htm#027).md). But the Old Law was also a law
of faith, according to<span id="FS_Q107_A1-p4.2"></span> [Heb.
11:39](../../../bib/vul/heb011.htm#039.md): "All were \[Vulg.: 'All these
being'\] approved by the testimony of faith," which he says of the
fathers of the Old Testament. In like manner the New Law is a law of
works: since it is written (<span id="FS_Q107_A1-p4.3"></span>[Mat.
5:44](../../../bib/vul/mat005.htm#044).md): "Do good to them that hate
you"; and (<span id="FS_Q107_A1-p4.4"></span>[Lk.
22:19](../../../bib/vul/luk022.htm#019).md): "Do this for a commemoration
of Me." Therefore the New Law is not distinct from the Old.

**On the contrary,** the Apostle says (<span
id="FS_Q107_A1-p5.1"></span>[Heb.
7:12](../../../bib/vul/heb007.htm#012).md): "The priesthood being
translated it is necessary that a translation also be made of the Law."
But the priesthood of the New Testament is distinct from that of the
Old, as the Apostle shows in the same place. Therefore the Law is also
distinct.

**I answer that,** As stated above (Q\[90\], A\[2\]; Q\[91\], A\[4\]),
every law ordains human conduct to some end. Now things ordained to an
end may be divided in two ways, considered from the point of view of the
end. First, through being ordained to different ends: and this
difference will be specific, especially if such ends are proximate.
Secondly, by reason of being closely or remotely connected with the end.
Thus it is clear that movements differ in species through being directed
to different terms: while according as one part of a movement is nearer
to the term than another part, the difference of perfect and imperfect
movement is assessed.

Accordingly then two laws may be distinguished from one another in two
ways. First, through being altogether diverse, from the fact that they
are ordained to diverse ends: thus a state-law ordained to democratic
government, would differ specifically from a law ordained to government
by the aristocracy. Secondly, two laws may be distinguished from one
another, through one of them being more closely connected with the end,
and the other more remotely: thus in one and the same state there is one
law enjoined on men of mature age, who can forthwith accomplish that
which pertains to the common good; and another law regulating the
education of children who need to be taught how they are to achieve
manly deeds later on.

We must therefore say that, according to the first way, the New Law is
not distinct from the Old Law: because they both have the same end,
namely, man's subjection to God; and there is but one God of the New and
of the Old Testament, according to<span id="FS_Q107_A1-p8.1"></span>
[Rom. 3:30](../../../bib/vul/rom003.htm#030.md): "It is one God that
justifieth circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith."
According to the second way, the New Law is distinct from the Old Law:
because the Old Law is like a pedagogue of children, as the Apostle says
(<span id="FS_Q107_A1-p8.2"></span>[Gal.
3:24](../../../bib/vul/gal003.htm#024).md), whereas the New Law is the law
of perfection, since it is the law of charity, of which the Apostle says
(<span id="FS_Q107_A1-p8.3"></span>[Col.
3:14](../../../bib/vul/col003.htm#014).md) that it is "the bond of
perfection."

**Reply to Objection 1:** The unity of faith under both Testaments
witnesses to the unity of end: for it has been stated above (Q\[62\],
A\[2\]) that the object of the theological virtues, among which is
faith, is the last end. Yet faith had a different state in the Old and
in the New Law: since what they believed as future, we believe as fact.

**Reply to Objection 2:** All the differences assigned between the Old
and New Laws are gathered from their relative perfection and
imperfection. For the precepts of every law prescribe acts of virtue.
Now the imperfect, who as yet are not possessed of a virtuous habit, are
directed in one way to perform virtuous acts, while those who are
perfected by the possession of virtuous habits are directed in another
way. For those who as yet are not endowed with virtuous habits, are
directed to the performance of virtuous acts by reason of some outward
cause: for instance, by the threat of punishment, or the promise of some
extrinsic rewards, such as honor, riches, or the like. Hence the Old
Law, which was given to men who were imperfect, that is, who had not yet
received spiritual grace, was called the "law of fear," inasmuch as it
induced men to observe its commandments by threatening them with
penalties; and is spoken of as containing temporal promises. On the
other hand, those who are possessed of virtue, are inclined to do
virtuous deeds through love of virtue, not on account of some extrinsic
punishment or reward. Hence the New Law which derives its pre-eminence
from the spiritual grace instilled into our hearts, is called the "Law
of love": and it is described as containing spiritual and eternal
promises, which are objects of the virtues, chiefly of charity.
Accordingly such persons are inclined of themselves to those objects,
not as to something foreign but as to something of their own. For this
reason, too, the Old Law is described as "restraining the hand, not the
will" \[\*Peter Lombard, Sent. iii, D, 40\]; since when a man refrains
from some sins through fear of being punished, his will does not shrink
simply from sin, as does the will of a man who refrains from sin through
love of righteousness: and hence the New Law, which is the Law of love,
is said to restrain the will.

Nevertheless there were some in the state of the Old Testament who,
having charity and the grace of the Holy Ghost, looked chiefly to
spiritual and eternal promises: and in this respect they belonged to the
New Law. In like manner in the New Testament there are some carnal men
who have not yet attained to the perfection of the New Law; and these it
was necessary, even under the New Testament, to lead to virtuous action
by the fear of punishment and by temporal promises.

But although the Old Law contained precepts of charity, nevertheless it
did not confer the Holy Ghost by Whom "charity . . . is spread abroad in
our hearts" (<span id="FS_Q107_A1-p12.1"></span>[Rom.
5:5](../../../bib/vul/rom005.htm#005).md).

**Reply to Objection 3:** As stated above (Q\[106\], AA\[1\],2), the New
Law is called the law of faith, in so far as its pre-eminence is derived
from that very grace which is given inwardly to believers, and for this
reason is called the grace of faith. Nevertheless it consists
secondarily in certain deeds, moral and sacramental: but the New Law
does not consist chiefly in these latter things, as did the Old Law. As
to those under the Old Testament who through faith were acceptable to
God, in this respect they belonged to the New Testament: for they were
not justified except through faith in Christ, Who is the Author of the
New Testament. Hence of Moses the Apostle says (<span
id="FS_Q107_A1-p13.2"></span>[Heb.
11:26](../../../bib/vul/heb011.htm#026).md) that he esteemed "the reproach
of Christ greater riches than the treasure of the Egyptians."

#### Whether the New Law fulfils the Old?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that the New Law does not fulfil the Old.
Because to fulfil and to void are contrary. But the New Law voids or
excludes the observances of the Old Law: for the Apostle says (<span
id="FS_Q107_A2-p2.1"></span>[Gal.
5:2](../../../bib/vul/gal005.htm#002).md): "If you be circumcised, Christ
shall profit you nothing." Therefore the New Law is not a fulfilment of
the Old.

**Objection 2:** Further, one contrary is not the fulfilment of another.
But Our Lord propounded in the New Law precepts that were contrary to
precepts of the Old Law. For we read (<span
id="FS_Q107_A2-p3.1"></span>[Mat.
5:27-32](../../../bib/vul/mat005.htm#027).md): You have heard that it was
said to them of old: . . . "Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him
give her a bill of divorce. But I say to you that whosoever shall put
away his wife . . . maketh her to commit adultery." Furthermore, the
same evidently applies to the prohibition against swearing, against
retaliation, and against hating one's enemies. In like manner Our Lord
seems to have done away with the precepts of the Old Law relating to the
different kinds of foods (<span id="FS_Q107_A2-p3.2"></span>[Mat.
15:11](../../../bib/vul/mat015.htm#011).md): "Not that which goeth into the
mouth defileth the man: but what cometh out of the mouth, this defileth
a man." Therefore the New Law is not a fulfilment of the Old.

**Objection 3:** Further, whoever acts against a law does not fulfil the
law. But Christ in certain cases acted against the Law. For He touched
the leper (<span id="FS_Q107_A2-p4.1"></span>[Mat.
8:3](../../../bib/vul/mat008.htm#003).md), which was contrary to the Law.
Likewise He seems to have frequently broken the sabbath; since the Jews
used to say of Him (<span id="FS_Q107_A2-p4.2"></span>[Jn.
9:16](../../../bib/vul/joh009.htm#016).md): "This man is not of God, who
keepeth not the sabbath." Therefore Christ did not fulfil the Law: and
so the New Law given by Christ is not a fulfilment of the Old.

**Objection 4:** Further, the Old Law contained precepts, moral,
ceremonial, and judicial, as stated above (Q\[99\], A\[4\]). But Our
Lord (<span id="FS_Q107_A2-p5.2"></span>[Mat.
5](../../../bib/vul/mat005.htm#000).md) fulfilled the Law in some respects,
but without mentioning the judicial and ceremonial precepts. Therefore
it seems that the New Law is not a complete fulfilment of the Old.

**On the contrary,** Our Lord said (<span
id="FS_Q107_A2-p6.1"></span>[Mat.
5:17](../../../bib/vul/mat005.htm#017).md): "I am not come to destroy, but
to fulfil": and went on to say (<span id="FS_Q107_A2-p6.2"></span>[Mat.
5:18](../../../bib/vul/mat005.htm#018).md): "One jot or one tittle shall
not pass of the Law till all be fulfilled."

**I answer that,** As stated above (A\[1\]), the New Law is compared to
the Old as the perfect to the imperfect. Now everything perfect fulfils
that which is lacking in the imperfect. And accordingly the New Law
fulfils the Old by supplying that which was lacking in the Old Law.

Now two things of every law is to make men righteous and virtuous, as
was stated above (Q\[92\], A\[1\]): and consequently the end of the Old
Law was the justification of men. The Law, however, could not accomplish
this: but foreshadowed it by certain ceremonial actions, and promised it
in words. And in this respect, the New Law fulfils the Old by justifying
men through the power of Christ's Passion. This is what the Apostle says
(<span id="FS_Q107_A2-p8.2"></span>[Rom.
8:3](../../../bib/vul/rom008.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/vul/rom008.htm#004).md): "What the Law could not do . . .
God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh . . . hath
condemned sin in the flesh, that the justification of the Law might be
fulfilled in us." And in this respect, the New Law gives what the Old
Law promised, according to <span id="FS_Q107_A2-p8.3"></span>[2 Cor.
1:20](../../../bib/vul/co2001.htm#020.md): "Whatever are the promises of
God, in Him," i.e. in Christ, "they are 'Yea'." \[\*The Douay version
reads thus: "All the promises of God are in Him, 'It is'."\] Again, in
this respect, it also fulfils what the Old Law foreshadowed. Hence it is
written (<span id="FS_Q107_A2-p8.4"></span>[Col.
2:17](../../../bib/vul/col002.htm#017).md) concerning the ceremonial
precepts that they were "a shadow of things to come, but the body is of
Christ"; in other words, the reality is found in Christ. Wherefore the
New Law is called the law of reality; whereas the Old Law is called the
law of shadow or of figure.

Now Christ fulfilled the precepts of the Old Law both in His works and
in His doctrine. In His works, because He was willing to be circumcised
and to fulfil the other legal observances, which were binding for the
time being; according to<span id="FS_Q107_A2-p9.1"></span> [Gal.
4:4](../../../bib/vul/gal004.htm#004.md): "Made under the Law." In His
doctrine He fulfilled the precepts of the Law in three ways. First, by
explaining the true sense of the Law. This is clear in the case of
murder and adultery, the prohibition of which the Scribes and Pharisees
thought to refer only to the exterior act: wherefore Our Lord fulfilled
the Law by showing that the prohibition extended also to the interior
acts of sins. Secondly, Our Lord fulfilled the precepts of the Law by
prescribing the safest way of complying with the statutes of the Old
Law. Thus the Old Law forbade perjury: and this is more safely avoided,
by abstaining altogether from swearing, save in cases of urgency.
Thirdly, Our Lord fulfilled the precepts of the Law, by adding some
counsels of perfection: this is clearly seen in<span
id="FS_Q107_A2-p9.2"></span> [Mat.
19:21,](../../../bib/vul/mat019.htm#021.md) where Our Lord said to the man
who affirmed that he had kept all the precepts of the Old Law: "One
thing is wanting to thee: If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell whatsoever
thou hast," etc. \[\*St. Thomas combines<span
id="FS_Q107_A2-p9.3"></span> [Mat.
19:21](../../../bib/vul/mat019.htm#021.md) with<span
id="FS_Q107_A2-p9.4"></span> [Mk.
10:21](../../../bib/vul/mar010.htm#021.md)\].

**Reply to Objection 1:** The New Law does not void observance of the
Old Law except in the point of ceremonial precepts, as stated above
(Q\[103\], AA\[3\],4). Now the latter were figurative of something to
come. Wherefore from the very fact that the ceremonial precepts were
fulfilled when those things were accomplished which they foreshadowed,
it follows that they are no longer to be observed: for it they were to
be observed, this would mean that something is still to be accomplished
and is not yet fulfilled. Thus the promise of a future gift holds no
longer when it has been fulfilled by the presentation of the gift. In
this way the legal ceremonies are abolished by being fulfilled.

**Reply to Objection 2:** As Augustine says (Contra Faust. xix, 26),
those precepts of Our Lord are not contrary to the precepts of the Old
Law. For what Our Lord commanded about a man not putting away his wife,
is not contrary to what the Law prescribed. "For the Law did not say:
'Let him that wills, put his wife away': the contrary of which would be
not to put her away. On the contrary, the Law was unwilling that a man
should put away his wife, since it prescribed a delay, so that excessive
eagerness for divorce might cease through being weakened during the
writing of the bill. Hence Our Lord, in order to impress the fact that a
wife ought not easily to be put away, allowed no exception save in the
case of fornication." The same applies to the prohibition about
swearing, as stated above. The same is also clear with respect to the
prohibition of retaliation. For the Law fixed a limit to revenge, by
forbidding men to seek vengeance unreasonably: whereas Our Lord deprived
them of vengeance more completely by commanding them to abstain from it
altogether. With regard to the hatred of one's enemies, He dispelled the
false interpretation of the Pharisees, by admonishing us to hate, not
the person, but his sin. As to discriminating between various foods,
which was a ceremonial matter, Our Lord did not forbid this to be
observed: but He showed that no foods are naturally unclean, but only in
token of something else, as stated above (Q\[102\], A\[6\], ad 1).

**Reply to Objection 3:** It was forbidden by the Law to touch a leper;
because by doing so, man incurred a certain uncleanness of irregularity,
as also by touching the dead, as stated above (Q\[102\], A\[5\], ad 4).
But Our Lord, Who healed the leper, could not contract an uncleanness.
By those things which He did on the sabbath, He did not break the
sabbath in reality, as the Master Himself shows in the Gospel: both
because He worked miracles by His Divine power, which is ever active
among things; and because He worked miracles by His Divine power, which
is ever active among things; and because His works were concerned with
the salvation of man, while the Pharisees were concerned for the
well-being of animals even on the sabbath; and again because on account
of urgency He excused His disciples for gathering the ears of corn on
the sabbath. But He did seem to break the sabbath according to the
superstitious interpretation of the Pharisees, who thought that man
ought to abstain from doing even works of kindness on the sabbath; which
was contrary to the intention of the Law.

**Reply to Objection 4:** The reason why the ceremonial precepts of the
Law are not mentioned in <span id="FS_Q107_A2-p13.1"></span>[Mat.
5](../../../bib/vul/mat005.htm#000) is because, as stated above (ad 1.md),
their observance was abolished by their fulfilment. But of the judicial
precepts He mentioned that of retaliation: so that what He said about it
should refer to all the others. With regard to this precept, He taught
that the intention of the Law was that retaliation should be sought out
of love of justice, and not as a punishment out of revengeful spite,
which He forbade, admonishing man to be ready to suffer yet greater
insults; and this remains still in the New Law.

#### Whether the New Law is contained in the Old?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that the New Law is not contained in the
Old. Because the New Law consists chiefly in faith: wherefore it is
called the "law of faith" (<span id="FS_Q107_A3-p2.1"></span>[Rom.
3:27](../../../bib/vul/rom003.htm#027).md). But many points of faith are
set forth in the New Law, which are not contained in the Old. Therefore
the New Law is not contained in the Old.

**Objection 2:** Further, a gloss says on<span
id="FS_Q107_A3-p3.1"></span> [Mat.
5:19,](../../../bib/vul/mat005.htm#019.md) "He that shall break one of
these least commandments," that the lesser commandments are those of the
Law, and the greater commandments, those contained in the Gospel. Now
the greater cannot be contained in the lesser. Therefore the New Law is
not contained in the Old.

**Objection 3:** Further, who holds the container holds the contents.
If, therefore, the New Law is contained in the Old, it follows that
whoever had the Old Law had the New: so that it was superfluous to give
men a New Law when once they had the Old. Therefore the New Law is not
contained in the Old.

**On the contrary,** As expressed in<span id="FS_Q107_A3-p5.1"></span>
[Ezech. 1:16,](../../../bib/vul/eze001.htm#016.md) there was "a wheel in
the midst of a wheel," i.e. "the New Testament within the Old,"
according to Gregory's exposition.

**I answer that,** One thing may be contained in another in two ways.
First, actually; as a located thing is in a place. Secondly, virtually;
as an effect in its cause, or as the complement in that which is
incomplete; thus a genus contains its species, and a seed contains the
whole tree, virtually. It is in this way that the New Law is contained
in the Old: for it has been stated (A\[1\]) that the New Law is compared
to the Old as perfect to imperfect. Hence Chrysostom, expounding<span
id="FS_Q107_A3-p6.2"></span> [Mk.
4:28,](../../../bib/vul/mar004.htm#028.md) "The earth of itself bringeth
forth fruit, first the blade, then the ear, afterwards the full corn in
the ear," expresses himself as follows: "He brought forth first the
blade, i.e. the Law of Nature; then the ear, i.e. the Law of Moses;
lastly, the full corn, i.e. the Law of the Gospel." Hence then the New
Law is in the Old as the corn in the ear.

**Reply to Objection 1:** Whatsoever is set down in the New Testament
explicitly and openly as a point of faith, is contained in the Old
Testament as a matter of belief, but implicitly, under a figure. And
accordingly, even as to those things which we are bound to believe, the
New Law is contained in the Old.

**Reply to Objection 2:** The precepts of the New Law are said to be
greater than those of the Old Law, in the point of their being set forth
explicitly. But as to the substance itself of the precepts of the New
Testament, they are all contained in the Old. Hence Augustine says
(Contra Faust. xix, 23,28) that "nearly all Our Lord's admonitions or
precepts, where He expressed Himself by saying: 'But I say unto you,'
are to be found also in those ancient books. Yet, since they thought
that murder was only the slaying of the human body, Our Lord declared to
them that every wicked impulse to hurt our brother is to be looked on as
a kind of murder." And it is in the point of declarations of this kind
that the precepts of the New Law are said to be greater than those of
the Old. Nothing, however, prevents the greater from being contained in
the lesser virtually; just as a tree is contained in the seed.

**Reply to Objection 3:** What is set forth implicitly needs to be
declared explicitly. Hence after the publishing of the Old Law, a New
Law also had to be given.

#### Whether the New Law is more burdensome than the Old?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that the New Law is more burdensome than
the Old. For Chrysostom (Opus Imp. in Matth., Hom. x \[\*The work of an
unknown author\]) say: "The commandments given to Moses are easy to
obey: Thou shalt not kill; Thou shalt not commit adultery: but the
commandments of Christ are difficult to accomplish, for instance: Thou
shalt not give way to anger, or to lust." Therefore the New Law is more
burdensome than the Old.

**Objection 2:** Further, it is easier to make use of earthly prosperity
than to suffer tribulations. But in the Old Testament observance of the
Law was followed by temporal prosperity, as may be gathered from<span
id="FS_Q107_A4-p3.1"></span> [Dt.
28:1-14](../../../bib/vul/deu028.htm#001.md); whereas many kinds of trouble
ensue to those who observe the New Law, as stated in <span
id="FS_Q107_A4-p3.2"></span>[2 Cor.
6:4-10](../../../bib/vul/co2006.htm#004.md): "Let us exhibit ourselves as
the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulation, in necessities,
in distresses," etc. Therefore the New Law is more burdensome than the
Old.

**Objection 3:** The more one has to do, the more difficult it is. But
the New Law is something added to the Old. For the Old Law forbade
perjury, while the New Law proscribed even swearing: the Old Law forbade
a man to cast off his wife without a bill of divorce, while the New Law
forbade divorce altogether; as is clearly stated in<span
id="FS_Q107_A4-p4.1"></span> [Mat.
5:31,](../../../bib/vul/mat005.htm#031.md) seqq., according to Augustine's
expounding. Therefore the New Law is more burdensome than the Old.

**On the contrary,** It is written (<span
id="FS_Q107_A4-p5.1"></span>[Mat.
11:28](../../../bib/vul/mat011.htm#028).md): "Come to Me, all you that
labor and are burdened": which words are expounded by Hilary thus: "He
calls to Himself all those that labor under the difficulty of observing
the Law, and are burdened with the sins of this world." And further on
He says of the yoke of the Gospel: "For My yoke is sweet and My burden
light." Therefore the New Law is a lighter burden than the Old.

**I answer that,** A twofold difficult may attach to works of virtue
with which the precepts of the Law are concerned. One is on the part of
the outward works, which of themselves are, in a way, difficult and
burdensome. And in this respect the Old Law is a much heavier burden
than the New: since the Old Law by its numerous ceremonies prescribed
many more outward acts than the New Law, which, in the teaching of
Christ and the apostles, added very few precepts to those of the natural
law; although afterwards some were added, through being instituted by
the holy Fathers. Even in these Augustine says that moderation should be
observed, lest good conduct should become a burden to the faithful. For
he says in reply to the queries of Januarius (Ep. lv) that, "whereas God
in His mercy wished religion to be a free service rendered by the public
solemnization of a small number of most manifest sacraments, certain
persons make it a slave's burden; so much so that the state of the Jews
who were subject to the sacraments of the Law, and not to the
presumptuous devices of man, was more tolerable."

The other difficulty attaches to works of virtue as to interior acts:
for instance, that a virtuous deed be done with promptitude and
pleasure. It is this difficulty that virtue solves: because to act thus
is difficult for a man without virtue: but through virtue it becomes
easy for him. In this respect the precepts of the New Law are more
burdensome than those of the Old; because the New Law prohibits certain
interior movements of the soul, which were not expressly forbidden in
the Old Law in all cases, although they were forbidden in some, without,
however, any punishment being attached to the prohibition. Now this is
very difficult to a man without virtue: thus even the Philosopher states
(Ethic. v, 9) that it is easy to do what a righteous man does; but that
to do it in the same way, viz. with pleasure and promptitude, is
difficult to a man who is not righteous. Accordingly we read also (<span
id="FS_Q107_A4-p7.1"></span>[1 Jn.
5:3](../../../bib/vul/jo1005.htm#003).md) that "His commandments are not
heavy": which words Augustine expounds by saying that "they are not
heavy to the man that loveth; whereas they are a burden to him that
loveth not."

**Reply to Objection 1:** The passage quoted speaks expressly of the
difficulty of the New Law as to the deliberate curbing of interior
movements.

**Reply to Objection 2:** The tribulations suffered by those who observe
the New Law are not imposed by the Law itself. Moreover they are easily
borne, on account of the love in which the same Law consists: since, as
Augustine says (De Verb. Dom., Serm. lxx), "love makes light and nothing
of things that seem arduous and beyond our power."

**Reply to Objection 3:** The object of these additions to the precepts
of the Old Law was to render it easier to do what it prescribed, as
Augustine states \[\*De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 17,21; xix, 23,26\].
Accordingly this does not prove that the New Law is more burdensome, but
rather that it is a lighter burden.
