### OF THE FIRST MAN'S SIN (FOUR ARTICLES)

We must now consider the first man's sin which was pride: and (1) his
sin; (2) its punishment; (3) the temptation whereby he was led to sin.

Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:

\(1\) Whether pride was the first man's first sin?

\(2\) What the first man coveted by sinning?

\(3\) Whether his sin was more grievous than all other sins?

\(4\) Which sinned more grievously, the man or the woman?

#### Whether pride was the first man's first sin?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that pride was not the first man's first
sin. For the Apostle says (<span id="SS_Q163_A1-p2.1"></span>[Rom.
5:19](../../../bib/vul/rom005.htm#019).md) that "by the disobedience of one
man many were made sinners." Now the first man's first sin is the one by
which all men were made sinners in the point of original sin. Therefore
disobedience, and not pride, was the first man's first sin.

**Objection 2:** Further, Ambrose says, commenting on<span
id="SS_Q163_A1-p3.1"></span> [Lk. 4:3,](../../../bib/vul/luk004.htm#003.md)
"And the devil said to Him," that the devil in tempting Christ observed
the same order as in overcoming the first man. Now Christ was first
tempted to gluttony, as appears from<span id="SS_Q163_A1-p3.2"></span>
[Mat. 4:3,](../../../bib/vul/mat004.htm#003.md) where it was said to Him:
"If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread."
Therefore the first man's first sin was not pride but gluttony.

**Objection 3:** Further, man sinned at the devil's suggestion. Now the
devil in tempting man promised him knowledge (<span
id="SS_Q163_A1-p4.1"></span>[Gn. 3:5](../../../bib/vul/gen003.htm#005).md).
Therefore inordinateness in man was through the desire of knowledge,
which pertains to curiosity. Therefore curiosity, and not pride, was the
first sin.

**Objection 4:** Further, a gloss \[\*St. Augustine, Gen. ad lit. xi\]
on <span id="SS_Q163_A1-p5.1"></span>[1 Tim.
2:14](../../../bib/vul/ti1002.htm#014.md), "The woman being seduced was in
the transgression," says: "The Apostle rightly calls this seduction, for
they were persuaded to accept a falsehood as being true; namely that God
had forbidden them to touch that tree, because He knew that if they
touched it, they would be like gods, as though He who made them men,
begrudged them the godhead . . ." Now it pertains to unbelief to believe
such a thing. Therefore man's first sin was unbelief and not pride.

**On the contrary,** It is written (<span
id="SS_Q163_A1-p6.1"></span>[Ecclus.
10:15](../../../bib/vul/sir010.htm#015).md): "Pride is the beginning of all
sin." Now man's first sin is the beginning of all sin, according to<span
id="SS_Q163_A1-p6.2"></span> [Rom.
5:12,](../../../bib/vul/rom005.htm#012.md) "By one man sin entered into
this world." Therefore man's first sin was pride.

**I answer that,** Many movements may concur towards one sin, and the
character of sin attaches to that one in which inordinateness is first
found. And it is evident that inordinateness is in the inward movement
of the soul before being in the outward act of the body; since, as
Augustine says (De Civ. Dei i, 18), the sanctity of the body is not
forfeited so long as the sanctity of the soul remains. Also, among the
inward movements, the appetite is moved towards the end before being
moved towards that which is desired for the sake of the end; and
consequently man's first sin was where it was possible for his appetite
to be directed to an inordinate end. Now man was so appointed in the
state of innocence, that there was no rebellion of the flesh against the
spirit. Wherefore it was not possible for the first inordinateness in
the human appetite to result from his coveting a sensible good, to which
the concupiscence of the flesh tends against the order of reason. It
remains therefore that the first inordinateness of the human appetite
resulted from his coveting inordinately some spiritual good. Now he
would not have coveted it inordinately, by desiring it according to his
measure as established by the Divine rule. Hence it follows that man's
first sin consisted in his coveting some spiritual good above his
measure: and this pertains to pride. Therefore it is evident that man's
first sin was pride.

**Reply to Objection 1:** Man's disobedience to the Divine command was
not willed by man for his own sake, for this could not happen unless one
presuppose inordinateness in his will. It remains therefore that he
willed it for the sake of something else. Now the first thing he coveted
inordinately was his own excellence; and consequently his disobedience
was the result of his pride. This agrees with the statement of
Augustine, who says (Ad Oros \[\*Dial. QQ. lxv, qu. 4\]) that "man
puffed up with pride obeyed the serpent's prompting, and scorned God's
commands."

**Reply to Objection 2:** Gluttony also had a place in the sin of our
first parents. For it is written (<span id="SS_Q163_A1-p9.1"></span>[Gn.
3:6](../../../bib/vul/gen003.htm#006).md): "The woman saw that the tree was
good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to behold, and she
took of the fruit thereof, and did eat." Yet the very goodness and
beauty of the fruit was not their first motive for sinning, but the
persuasive words of the serpent, who said (<span
id="SS_Q163_A1-p9.2"></span>[Gn. 3:5](../../../bib/vul/gen003.htm#005).md):
"Your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as Gods": and it was by
coveting this that the woman fell into pride. Hence the sin of gluttony
resulted from the sin of pride.

**Reply to Objection 3:** The desire for knowledge resulted in our first
parents from their inordinate desire for excellence. Hence the serpent
began by saying: "You shall be as Gods," and added: "Knowing good and
evil."

**Reply to Objection 4:** According to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. xi, 30),
"the woman had not believed the serpent's statement that they were
debarred by God from a good and useful thing, were her mind not already
filled with the love of her own power, and a certain proud
self-presumption." This does not mean that pride preceded the promptings
of the serpent, but that as soon as the serpent had spoken his words of
persuasion, her mind was puffed up, the result being that she believed
the demon to have spoken truly.

#### Whether the first man's pride consisted in his coveting God's likeness?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that the first man's pride did not
consist in his coveting the Divine likeness. For no one sins by coveting
that which is competent to him according to his nature. Now God's
likeness is competent to man according to his nature: for it is written
(<span id="SS_Q163_A2-p2.1"></span>[Gn.
1:26](../../../bib/vul/gen001.htm#026).md): "Let us make man to our image
and likeness." Therefore he did not sin by coveting God's likeness.

**Objection 2:** Further, it would seem that man coveted God's likeness
in order that he might obtain knowledge of good and evil: for this was
the serpent's suggestion: "You shall be as Gods knowing good and evil."
Now the desire of knowledge is natural to man, according to the saying
of the Philosopher at the beginning of his Metaphysics i, 1: "All men
naturally desire knowledge." Therefore he did not sin by coveting God's
likeness.

**Objection 3:** Further, no wise man chooses the impossible. Now the
first man was endowed with wisdom, according to<span
id="SS_Q163_A2-p4.1"></span> [Ecclus.
17:5,](../../../bib/vul/sir017.htm#005.md) "He filled them with the
knowledge of understanding." Since then every sin consists in a
deliberate act of the appetite, namely choice, it would seem that the
first man did not sin by coveting something impossible. But it is
impossible for man to be like God, according to the saying of<span
id="SS_Q163_A2-p4.2"></span> [Ex.
15:11,](../../../bib/vul/exo015.htm#011.md) "Who is like to Thee among the
strong, O Lord?" Therefore the first man did not sin by coveting God's
likeness.

**On the contrary,** Augustine commenting on<span
id="SS_Q163_A2-p5.1"></span> [Ps. 68:5](../../../bib/vul/psa068.htm#005.md)
\[\*Enarr. in <span id="SS_Q163_A2-p5.2"></span>[Ps.
68](../../../bib/vul/psa068.htm#000.md)\], "Then did I restore \[Douay:
'pay'\] that which I took not away," says: "Adam and Eve wished to rob
the Godhead and they lost happiness."

**I answer that,** likeness is twofold. One is a likeness of absolute
equality \[\*Cf. FP, Q\[93\], A\[1\]\]: and such a likeness to God our
first parents did not covet, since such a likeness to God is not
conceivable to the mind, especially of a wise man.

The other is a likeness of imitation, such as is possible for a creature
in reference to God, in so far as the creature participates somewhat of
God's likeness according to its measure. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom.
ix): "The same things are like and unlike to God; like, according as
they imitate Him, as far as He can be imitated; unlike, according as an
effect falls short of its cause." Now every good existing in a creature
is a participated likeness of the first good.

Wherefore from the very fact that man coveted a spiritual good above his
measure, as stated in the foregoing Article, it follows that he coveted
God's likeness inordinately.

It must, however, be observed that the proper object of the appetite is
a thing not possessed. Now spiritual good, in so far as the rational
creature participates in the Divine likeness, may be considered in
reference to three things. First, as to natural being: and this likeness
was imprinted from the very outset of their creation, both on man---of
whom it is written (<span id="SS_Q163_A2-p9.1"></span>[Gn.
1:26](../../../bib/vul/gen001.htm#026).md) that God made man "to His image
and likeness"---and on the angel, of whom it is written (<span
id="SS_Q163_A2-p9.2"></span>[Ezech.
28:12](../../../bib/vul/eze028.htm#012).md): "Thou wast the seal of
resemblance." Secondly, as to knowledge: and this likeness was bestowed
on the angel at his creation, wherefore immediately after the words just
quoted, "Thou wast the seal of resemblance," we read: "Full of wisdom."
But the first man, at his creation, had not yet received this likeness
actually but only in potentiality. Thirdly, as to the power of
operation: and neither angel nor man received this likeness actually at
the very outset of his creation, because to each there remained
something to be done whereby to obtain happiness.

Accordingly, while both (namely the devil and the first man) coveted
God's likeness inordinately, neither of them sinned by coveting a
likeness of nature. But the first man sinned chiefly by coveting God's
likeness as regards "knowledge of good and evil," according to the
serpent's instigation, namely that by his own natural power he might
decide what was good, and what was evil for him to do; or again that he
should of himself foreknow what good and what evil would befall him.
Secondarily he sinned by coveting God's likeness as regards his own
power of operation, namely that by his own natural power he might act so
as to obtain happiness. Hence Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 30) that
"the woman's mind was filled with love of her own power." On the other
hand, the devil sinned by coveting God's likeness, as regards power.
Wherefore Augustine says (De Vera Relig. 13) that "he wished to enjoy
his own power rather than God's." Nevertheless both coveted somewhat to
be equal to God, in so far as each wished to rely on himself in contempt
of the order of the Divine rule.

**Reply to Objection 1:** This argument considers the likeness of
nature: and man did not sin by coveting this, as stated.

**Reply to Objection 2:** It is not a sin to covet God's likeness as to
knowledge, absolutely; but to covet this likeness inordinately, that is,
above one's measure, this is a sin. Hence Augustine commenting on<span
id="SS_Q163_A2-p12.1"></span> [Ps.
70:18,](../../../bib/vul/psa070.htm#018.md) "O God, who is like Thee?"
says: "He who desires to be of himself, even as God is of no one, wishes
wickedly to be like God. Thus did the devil, who was unwilling to be
subject to Him, and man who refused to be, as a servant, bound by His
command."

**Reply to Objection 3:** This argument considers the likeness of
equality.

#### Whether the sin of our first parents was more grievous than other sins?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that the sin of our first parents was
more grievous than other sins. For Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 15):
"Great was the wickedness in sinning, when it was so easy to avoid sin."
Now it was very easy for our first parents to avoid sin, because they
had nothing within them urging them to sin. Therefore the sin of our
first parents was more grievous than other sins.

**Objection 2:** Further, punishment is proportionate to guilt. Now the
sin of our first parents was most severely punished, since by it "death
entered into this world," as the Apostle says (<span
id="SS_Q163_A3-p3.1"></span>[Rom.
5:12](../../../bib/vul/rom005.htm#012).md). Therefore that sin was more
grievous than other sins.

**Objection 3:** Further, the first in every genus is seemingly the
greatest (Metaph. ii, 4 \[\*Ed. Diel. i, 1\]). Now the sin of our first
parents was the first among sins of men. Therefore it was the greatest.

**On the contrary,** Origen says \[\*Peri Archon i, 3\]: "I think that a
man who stands on the highest step of perfection cannot fail or fall
suddenly: this can happen only by degrees and little by little." Now our
first parents were established on the highest and perfect grade.
Therefore their first sin was not the greatest of all sins.

**I answer that,** There is a twofold gravity to be observed in sin. one
results from the very species of the sin: thus we say that adultery is a
graver sin than simple fornication. The other gravity of sin results
from some circumstance of place, person, or time. The former gravity is
more essential to sin and is of greater moment: hence a sin is said to
be grave in respect of this gravity rather than of the other.
Accordingly we must say that the first man's sin was not graver than all
other sins of men, as regards the species of the sin. For though pride,
of its genus, has a certain pre-eminence over other sins, yet the pride
whereby one denies or blasphemes God is greater than the pride whereby
one covets God's likeness inordinately, such as the pride of our first
parents, as stated (A\[2\]).

But if we consider the circumstances of the persons who sinned, that sin
was most grave on account of the perfection of their state. We must
accordingly conclude that this sin was most grievous relatively but not
simply.

**Reply to Objection 1:** This argument considers the gravity of sin as
resulting from the person of the sinner.

**Reply to Objection 2:** The severity of the punishment awarded to that
first sin corresponds to the magnitude of the sin, not as regards its
species but as regards its being the first sin: because it destroyed the
innocence of our original state, and by robbing it of innocence brought
disorder upon the whole human nature.

**Reply to Objection 3:** Where things are directly subordinate, the
first must needs be the greatest. Such is not the order among sins, for
one follows from another accidentally. And thus it does not follow that
the first sin is the greatest.

#### Whether Adam's sin was more grievous than Eve's?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that Adam's sin was more grievous than
Eve's. For it is written (<span id="SS_Q163_A4-p2.1"></span>[1 Tim.
2:14](../../../bib/vul/ti1002.htm#014).md): "Adam was not seduced, but the
woman being seduced was in the transgression": and so it would seem that
the woman sinned through ignorance, but the man through assured
knowledge. Now the latter is the graver sin, according to<span
id="SS_Q163_A4-p2.2"></span>[Luke
12:47](../../../bib/vul/luk012.htm#047.md),
[48](../../../bib/vul/luk012.htm#048.md)"That servant who knew the will of
his lord . . . and did not according to his will, shall be beaten with
many stripes: but he that knew not, and did things worthy of stripes,
shall be beaten with few stripes." Therefore Adam's sin was more
grievous than Eve's.

**Objection 2:** Further, Augustine says (De Decem Chordis 3 \[\*Serm.
ix; xcvi de Temp.\]): "If the man is the head, he should live better,
and give an example of good deeds to his wife, that she may imitate
him." Now he who ought to do better, sins more grievously, if he commit
a sin. Therefore Adam sinned more grievously than Eve.

**Objection 3:** Further, the sin against the Holy Ghost would seem to
be the most grievous. Now Adam, apparently, sinned against the Holy
Ghost, because while sinning he relied on God's mercy \[\*Cf. Q\[21\],
A\[2\], OBJ\[3\]. St. Thomas is evidently alluding to the words of Peter
Lombard quoted there\], and this pertains to the sin of presumption.
Therefore it seems that Adam sinned more grievously than Eve.

**On the contrary,** Punishment corresponds to guilt. Now the woman was
more grievously punished than the man, as appears from <span
id="SS_Q163_A4-p5.1"></span>[Gn. 3](../../../bib/vul/gen003.htm#000.md).
Therefore she sinned more grievously than the man.

**I answer that,** As stated (A\[3\]), the gravity of a sin depends on
the species rather than on a circumstance of that sin. Accordingly we
must assert that, if we consider the condition attaching to these
persons, the man's sin is the more grievous, because he was more perfect
than the woman.

As regards the genus itself of the sin, the sin of each is considered to
be equal, for each sinned by pride. Hence Augustine says (Gen. ad lit.
xi, 35): "Eve in excusing herself betrays disparity of sex, though
parity of pride."

But as regards the species of pride, the woman sinned more grievously,
for three reasons. First, because she was more puffed up than the man.
For the woman believed in the serpent's persuasive words, namely that
God had forbidden them to eat of the tree, lest they should become like
to Him; so that in wishing to attain to God's likeness by eating of the
forbidden fruit, her pride rose to the height of desiring to obtain
something against God's will. On the other hand, the man did not believe
this to be true; wherefore he did not wish to attain to God's likeness
against God's will: but his pride consisted in wishing to attain thereto
by his own power. Secondly, the woman not only herself sinned, but
suggested sin to the man; wherefore she sinned against both God and her
neighbor. Thirdly, the man's sin was diminished by the fact that, as
Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 42), "he consented to the sin out of a
certain friendly good-will, on account of which a man sometimes will
offend God rather than make an enemy of his friend. That he ought not to
have done so is shown by the just issue of the Divine sentence."

It is therefore evident that the woman's sin was more grievous than the
man's.

**Reply to Objection 1:** The woman was deceived because she was first
of all puffed up with pride. Wherefore her ignorance did not excuse, but
aggravated her sin, in so far as it was the cause of her being puffed up
with still greater pride.

**Reply to Objection 2:** This argument considers the circumstance of
personal condition, on account of which the man's sin was more grievous
than the woman's.

**Reply to Objection 3:** The man's reliance on God's mercy did not
reach to contempt of God's justice, wherein consists the sin against the
Holy Ghost, but as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xi \[\*De Civ. Dei xiv,
11\]), it was due to the fact that, "having had no experience of God's
severity, he thought the sin to be venial," i.e. easily forgiven \[\*Cf.
FS, Q\[89\], A\[3\], ad 1\].

ARTICLES)](sum421.md)
