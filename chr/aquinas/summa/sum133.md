### PROLOGUE

Since, as Damascene states (De Fide Orth. ii, 12), man is said to be
made in God's image, in so far as the image implies "an intelligent
being endowed with free-will and self-movement": now that we have
treated of the exemplar, i.e. God, and of those things which came forth
from the power of God in accordance with His will; it remains for us to
treat of His image, i.e. man, inasmuch as he too is the principle of his
actions, as having free-will and control of his actions.
