### OF THE PRECEPTS OF FAITH, KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING (TWO ARTICLES)

We must now consider the precepts pertaining to the aforesaid, and under
this head there are two points of inquiry:

\(1\) The precepts concerning faith;

\(2\) The precepts concerning the gifts of knowledge and understanding.

#### Whether in the Old Law there should have been given precepts of faith?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that, in the Old Law, there should have
been given precepts of faith. Because a precept is about something due
and necessary. Now it is most necessary for man that he should believe,
according to<span id="SS_Q16_A1-p2.1"></span> [Heb.
11:6,](../../../bib/vul/heb011.htm#006.md) "Without faith it is impossible
to please God." Therefore there was very great need for precepts of
faith to be given.

**Objection 2:** Further, the New Testament is contained in the Old, as
the reality in the figure, as stated above (FS, Q\[107\], A\[3\]). Now
the New Testament contains explicit precepts of faith, for instance<span
id="SS_Q16_A1-p3.2"></span> [Jn. 14:1](../../../bib/vul/joh014.htm#001.md):
"You believe in God; believe also in Me." Therefore it seems that some
precepts of faith ought to have been given in the Old Law also.

**Objection 3:** Further, to prescribe the act of a virtue comes to the
same as to forbid the opposite vices. Now the Old Law contained many
precepts forbidding unbelief: thus (<span
id="SS_Q16_A1-p4.1"></span>[Ex. 20:3](../../../bib/vul/exo020.htm#003).md):
"Thou shalt not have strange gods before Me," and (<span
id="SS_Q16_A1-p4.2"></span>[Dt.
13:1-3](../../../bib/vul/deu013.htm#001).md) they were forbidden to hear
the words of the prophet or dreamer who might wish to turn them away
from their faith in God. Therefore precepts of faith should have been
given in the Old Law also.

**Objection 4:** Further, confession is an act of faith, as stated above
(Q\[3\], A\[1\]). Now the Old Law contained precepts about the
confession and the promulgation of faith: for they were commanded (<span
id="SS_Q16_A1-p5.2"></span>[Ex. 12:27](../../../bib/vul/exo012.htm#027).md)
that, when their children should ask them, they should tell them the
meaning of the paschal observance, and (<span
id="SS_Q16_A1-p5.3"></span>[Dt. 13:9](../../../bib/vul/deu013.htm#009).md)
they were commanded to slay anyone who disseminated doctrine contrary to
faith. Therefore the Old Law should have contained precepts of faith.

**Objection 5:** Further, all the books of the Old Testament are
contained in the Old Law; wherefore Our Lord said (<span
id="SS_Q16_A1-p6.1"></span>[Jn. 15:25](../../../bib/vul/joh015.htm#025).md)
that it was written in the Law: "They have hated Me without cause,"
although this is found written in <span id="SS_Q16_A1-p6.2"></span>[Ps.
34](../../../bib/vul/psa034.htm#000.md) and 68. Now it is written (<span
id="SS_Q16_A1-p6.3"></span>[Ecclus.
2:8](../../../bib/vul/sir002.htm#008).md): "Ye that fear the Lord, believe
Him." Therefore the Old Law should have contained precepts of faith.

**On the contrary,** The Apostle (<span id="SS_Q16_A1-p7.1"></span>[Rom.
3:27](../../../bib/vul/rom003.htm#027).md) calls the Old Law the "law of
works" which he contrasts with the "law of faith." Therefore the Old Law
ought not to have contained precepts of faith.

**I answer that,** A master does not impose laws on others than his
subjects; wherefore the precepts of a law presuppose that everyone who
receives the law is subject to the giver of the law. Now the primary
subjection of man to God is by faith, according to<span
id="SS_Q16_A1-p8.1"></span> [Heb.
11:6](../../../bib/vul/heb011.htm#006.md): "He that cometh to God, must
believe that He is." Hence faith is presupposed to the precepts of the
Law: for which reason (<span id="SS_Q16_A1-p8.2"></span>[Ex.
20:2](../../../bib/vul/exo020.htm#002).md) that which is of faith, is set
down before the legal precepts, in the words, "I am the Lord thy God,
Who brought thee out of the land of Egypt," and, likewise (<span
id="SS_Q16_A1-p8.3"></span>[Dt. 6:4](../../../bib/vul/deu006.htm#004).md),
the words, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy \[Vulg.: 'our'\] God is one,"
precede the recording of the precepts.

Since, however, faith contains many things subordinate to the faith
whereby we believe that God is, which is the first and chief of all
articles of faith, as stated above (Q\[1\], AA\[1\],7), it follows that,
if we presuppose faith in God, whereby man's mind is subjected to Him,
it is possible for precepts to be given about other articles of faith.
Thus Augustine expounding the words: "This is My commandment" (<span
id="SS_Q16_A1-p9.2"></span>[Jn. 15:12](../../../bib/vul/joh015.htm#012).md)
says (Tract. lxxxiii in Joan.) that we have received many precepts of
faith. In the Old Law, however, the secret things of faith were not to
be set before the people, wherefore, presupposing their faith in one
God, no other precepts of faith were given in the Old Law.

**Reply to Objection 1:** Faith is necessary as being the principle of
spiritual life, wherefore it is presupposed before the receiving of the
Law.

**Reply to Objection 2:** Even then Our Lord both presupposed something
of faith, namely belief in one God, when He said: "You believe in God,"
and commanded something, namely, belief in the Incarnation whereby one
Person is God and man. This explanation of faith belongs to the faith of
the New Testament, wherefore He added: "Believe also in Me."

**Reply to Objection 3:** The prohibitive precepts regard sins, which
corrupt virtue. Now virtue is corrupted by any particular defect, as
stated above (FS, Q\[18\], A\[4\], ad 3; FS, Q\[19\], A\[6\], ad 1,
A\[7\], ad 3). Therefore faith in one God being presupposed, prohibitive
precepts had to be given in the Old Law, so that men might be warned off
those particular defects whereby their faith might be corrupted.

**Reply to Objection 4:** Confession of faith and the teaching thereof
also presuppose man's submission to God by faith: so that the Old Law
could contain precepts relating to the confession and teaching of faith,
rather than to faith itself.

**Reply to Objection 5:** In this passage again that faith is
presupposed whereby we believe that God is; hence it begins, "Ye that
fear the Lord," which is not possible without faith. The words which
follow---"believe Him"---must be referred to certain special articles of
faith, chiefly to those things which God promises to them that obey Him,
wherefore the passage concludes---"and your reward shall not be made
void."

#### Whether the precepts referring to knowledge and understanding were fittingly set down in the Old Law?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that the precepts referring to knowledge
and understanding were unfittingly set down in the Old Law. For
knowledge and understanding pertain to cognition. Now cognition precedes
and directs action. Therefore the precepts referring to knowledge and
understanding should precede the precepts of the Law referring to
action. Since, then, the first precepts of the Law are those of the
decalogue, it seems that precepts of knowledge and understanding should
have been given a place among the precepts of the decalogue.

**Objection 2:** Further, learning precedes teaching, for a man must
learn from another before he teaches another. Now the Old Law contains
precepts about teaching---both affirmative precepts as, for example,
(<span id="SS_Q16_A2-p3.1"></span>[Dt.
4:9](../../../bib/vul/deu004.htm#009).md), "Thou shalt teach them to thy
sons"---and prohibitive precepts, as, for instance, (<span
id="SS_Q16_A2-p3.2"></span>[Dt. 4:2](../../../bib/vul/deu004.htm#002).md),
"You shall not add to the word that I speak to you, neither shall you
take away from it." Therefore it seems that man ought to have been given
also some precepts directing him to learn.

**Objection 3:** Further, knowledge and understanding seem more
necessary to a priest than to a king, wherefore it is written (<span
id="SS_Q16_A2-p4.1"></span>[Malachi
2:7](../../../bib/vul/mal002.htm#007).md): "The lips of the priest shall
keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law at his mouth," and (<span
id="SS_Q16_A2-p4.2"></span>[Osee 4:6](../../../bib/vul/hos004.htm#006).md):
"Because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will reject thee, that thou
shalt not do the office of priesthood to Me." Now the king is commanded
to learn knowledge of the Law (<span id="SS_Q16_A2-p4.3"></span>[Deut.
17:18](../../../bib/vul/deu017.htm#018.md),
[19](../../../bib/vul/deu017.htm#019).md). Much more therefore should the
Law have commanded the priests to learn the Law.

**Objection 4:** Further, it is not possible while asleep to meditate on
things pertaining to knowledge and understanding: moreover it is
hindered by extraneous occupations. Therefore it is unfittingly
commanded (<span id="SS_Q16_A2-p5.1"></span>[Dt.
6:7](../../../bib/vul/deu006.htm#007).md): "Thou shalt meditate upon them
sitting in thy house, and walking on thy journey, sleeping and rising."
Therefore the precepts relating to knowledge and understanding are
unfittingly set down in the Law.

**On the contrary,** It is written (<span
id="SS_Q16_A2-p6.1"></span>[Dt. 4:6](../../../bib/vul/deu004.htm#006).md):
"That, hearing all these precepts, they may say, Behold a wise and
understanding people."

**I answer that,** Three things may be considered in relation to
knowledge and understanding: first, the reception thereof; secondly, the
use; and thirdly, their preservation. Now the reception of knowledge or
understanding, is by means of teaching and learning, and both are
prescribed in the Law. For it is written (<span
id="SS_Q16_A2-p7.1"></span>[Dt. 6:6](../../../bib/vul/deu006.htm#006).md):
"These words which I command thee . . . shall be in thy heart." This
refers to learning, since it is the duty of a disciple to apply his mind
to what is said, while the words that follow---"and thou shalt tell them
to thy children"---refer to teaching.

The use of knowledge and understanding is the meditation on those things
which one knows or understands. In reference to this, the text goes on:
"thou shalt meditate upon them sitting in thy house," etc.

Their preservation is effected by the memory, and, as regards this, the
text continues---"and thou shalt bind them as a sign on thy hand, and
they shall be and shall move between thy eyes. And thou shalt write them
in the entry, and on the doors of thy house." Thus the continual
remembrance of God's commandments is signified, since it is impossible
for us to forget those things which are continually attracting the
notice of our senses, whether by touch, as those things we hold in our
hands, or by sight, as those things which are ever before our eyes, or
to which we are continually returning, for instance, to the house door.
Moreover it is clearly stated (<span id="SS_Q16_A2-p9.1"></span>[Dt.
4:9](../../../bib/vul/deu004.htm#009).md): "Forget not the words that thy
eyes have seen and let them not go out of thy heart all the days of thy
life."

We read of these things also being commanded more notably in the New
Testament, both in the teaching of the Gospel and in that of the
apostles.

**Reply to Objection 1:** According to<span id="SS_Q16_A2-p11.1"></span>
[Dt. 4:6,](../../../bib/vul/deu004.htm#006.md) "this is your wisdom and
understanding in the sight of the nations." By this we are given to
understand that the wisdom and understanding of those who believe in God
consist in the precepts of the Law. Wherefore the precepts of the Law
had to be given first, and afterwards men had to be led to know and
understand them, and so it was not fitting that the aforesaid precepts
should be placed among the precepts of the decalogue which take the
first place.

**Reply to Objection 2:** There are also in the Law precepts relating to
learning, as stated above. Nevertheless teaching was commanded more
expressly than learning, because it concerned the learned, who were not
under any other authority, but were immediately under the law, and to
them the precepts of the Law were given. On the other hand learning
concerned the people of lower degree, and these the precepts of the Law
have to reach through the learned.

**Reply to Objection 3:** Knowledge of the Law is so closely bound up
with the priestly office that being charged with the office implies
being charged to know the Law: hence there was no need for special
precepts to be given about the training of the priests. On the other
hand, the doctrine of God's law is not so bound up with the kingly
office, because a king is placed over his people in temporal matters:
hence it is especially commanded that the king should be instructed by
the priests about things pertaining to the law of God.

**Reply to Objection 4:** That precept of the Law does not mean that man
should meditate on God's law of sleeping, but during sleep, i.e. that he
should meditate on the law of God when he is preparing to sleep, because
this leads to his having better phantasms while asleep, in so far as our
movements pass from the state of vigil to the state of sleep, as the
Philosopher explains (Ethic. i, 13). In like manner we are commanded to
meditate on the Law in every action of ours, not that we are bound to be
always actually thinking about the Law, but that we should regulate all
our actions according to it.
