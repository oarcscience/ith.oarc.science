### OF THE IMPEDIMENT TO MARRIAGE, ARISING FROM A SOLEMN VOW (THREE ARTICLES)

We must next consider the impediments which supervene to marriage. We
shall consider (1) the impediment which affects an unconsummated
marriage, namely a solemn vow: (2) the impediment which affects a
consummated marriage, namely fornication. Under the first head there are
three points of inquiry:

\(1\) Whether either party after the marriage has been consummated can
enter religion without the other's consent?

\(2\) Whether they can enter religion before the consummation of the
marriage?

\(3\) Whether the wife can take another husband if her former husband
has entered religion before the consummation of the marriage?

#### Whether one party after the marriage has been consummated can enter religion without the other's consent?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that even after the marriage has been
consummated one consort can enter religion without the other's consent.
For the Divine law ought to be more favorable to spiritual things than
human law. Now human law has allowed this. Therefore much more should
the Divine law permit it.

**Objection 2:** Further, the lesser good does not hinder the greater.
But the married state is a lesser good than the religious state,
according to <span id="XP_Q61_A1-p3.1"></span>[1 Cor.
7:38.](../../../bib/vul/co1007.htm#038.md) Therefore marriage ought not to
hinder a man from being able to enter religion.

**Objection 3:** Further, in every form of religious life there is a
kind of spiritual marriage. Now it is lawful to pass from a less strict
religious order to one that is stricter. Therefore it is also allowable
to pass from a less strict---namely a carnal---marriage to a stricter
marriage, namely that of the religious life, even without the wife's
consent.

**On the contrary,** Married persons are forbidden (<span
id="XP_Q61_A1-p5.1"></span>[1 Cor.
7:5](../../../bib/vul/co1007.htm#005).md) to abstain from the use of
marriage even for a time without one another's consent, in order to have
time for prayer.

Further, no one can lawfully do that which is prejudicial to another
without the latter's consent. Now the religious vow taken by one consort
is prejudicial to the other, since the one has power over the other's
body. Therefore one of them cannot take a religious vow without the
other's consent.

**I answer that,** No one can make an offering to God of what belongs to
another. Wherefore since by a consummated marriage the husband's body
already belongs to his wife, he cannot by a vow of continence offer it
to God without her consent.

**Reply to Objection 1:** Human law considers marriage merely as
fulfilling an office of nature: whereas the Divine law considers it as a
sacrament, by reason of which it is altogether indissoluble. Hence the
comparison fails.

**Reply to Objection 2:** It is not unreasonable that a greater good be
hindered by a lesser which is contrary to it, just as good is hindered
by evil.

**Reply to Objection 3:** In every form of religious life marriage is
contracted with one person, namely Christ; to Whom, however, a person
contracts more obligations in one religious order than in another. But
in carnal marriage and religious marriage the contract is not with the
same person: wherefore that comparison fails.

#### Whether before the marriage has been consummated one consort can enter religion without the other's consent?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that even before the marriage has been
consummated one consort cannot enter religion without the other's
consent. For the indissolubility of marriage belongs to the sacrament of
matrimony, inasmuch, namely, as it signifies the union of Christ with
the Church. Now marriage is a true sacrament before its consummation,
and after consent has been expressed in words of the present. Therefore
it cannot be dissolved by one of them entering religion.

**Objection 2:** Further, by virtue of the consent expressed in words of
the present, the one consort has given power over his body to the other.
Therefore the one can forthwith ask for the marriage debt, and the other
is bound to pay: and so the one cannot enter religion without the
other's consent.

**Objection 3:** Further, it is said (<span
id="XP_Q61_A2-p4.1"></span>[Mat.
19:6](../../../bib/vul/mat019.htm#006).md): "What God hath joined together
let no man put asunder." But the union which precedes marital
intercourse was made by God. Therefore it cannot be dissolved by the
will of man.

**On the contrary,** According to Jerome \[\*Prolog. in Joan.\] our Lord
called John from his wedding.

**I answer that,** Before marital intercourse there is only a spiritual
bond between husband and wife, but afterwards there is a carnal bond
between them. Wherefore, just as after marital intercourse marriage is
dissolved by carnal death, so by entering religion the bond which exists
before the consummation of the marriage is dissolved, because religious
life is a kind of spiritual death, whereby a man dies to the world and
lives to God.

**Reply to Objection 1:** Before consummation marriage signifies the
union of Christ with the soul by grace, which is dissolved by a contrary
spiritual disposition, namely mortal sin. But after consummation it
signifies the union of Christ with the Church, as regards the assumption
of human nature into the unity of person, which union is altogether
indissoluble.

**Reply to Objection 2:** Before consummation the body of one consort is
not absolutely delivered into the power of the other, but conditionally,
provided neither consort meanwhile seek the fruit of a better life. But
by marital intercourse the aforesaid delivery is completed, because then
each of them enters into bodily possession of the power transferred to
him. Wherefore also before consummation they are not bound to pay the
marriage debt forthwith after contracting marriage by words of the
present, but a space of two months is allowed them for three reasons.
First that they may deliberate meanwhile about entering religion;
secondly, to prepare what is necessary for the solemnization of the
wedding. thirdly, lest the husband think little of a gift he has not
longed to possess (cap. Institutum, caus. xxvi, qu. ii).

**Reply to Objection 3:** The marriage union, before consummation, is
indeed perfect as to its primary being, but is not finally perfect as to
its second act which is operation. It is like bodily possession and
consequently is not altogether indissoluble.

#### Whether the wife may take another husband if her husband has entered religion before the consummation of the marriage?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that the wife may not take another
husband, if her husband has entered religion before the consummation of
the marriage. For that which is consistent with marriage does not
dissolve the marriage tie. Now the marriage tie still remains between
those who equally take religious vows. Therefore by the fact that one
enters religion, the other is not freed from the marriage tie. But as
long as she remains tied to one by marriage, she cannot marry another.
Therefore, etc.

**Objection 2:** Further, after entering religion and before making his
profession the husband can return to the world. If then the wife can
marry again when her husband enters religion, he also can marry again
when he returns to the world: which is absurd.

**Objection 3:** Further, by a new decree (cap. Non solum, de regular.
et transeunt.) a profession, if made before the expiry of a year, is
accounted void. Therefore if he return to his wife after making such a
profession, she is bound to receive him. Therefore neither by her
husband's entry into religion, nor by his taking a vow, does the wife
receive the power to marry again.

**On the contrary,** No one can bind another to those things which
belong to perfection. Now continence is of those things that belong to
perfection. Therefore a wife is not bound to continence on account of
her husband entering religion, and consequently she can marry.

**I answer that,** Just as bodily death of the husband dissolves the
marriage tie in such a way that the wife may marry whom she will,
according to the statement of the Apostle (<span
id="XP_Q61_A3-p6.1"></span>[1 Cor.
7:39](../../../bib/vul/co1007.htm#039).md); so too after the husband's
spiritual death by entering religion, she can marry whom she will.

**Reply to Objection 1:** When both consorts take a like vow of
continence, neither renounces the marriage tie, wherefore it still
remains: but when only one takes the vow, then for his own part he
renounces the marriage tie, wherefore the other is freed therefrom.

**Reply to Objection 2:** A person is not accounted dead to the world by
entering religion until he makes his profession, and consequently his
wife is bound to wait for him until that time.

**Reply to Objection 3:** We must judge of a profession thus made before
the time fixed by law, as of a simple vow. Wherefore just as when the
husband has taken a simple vow his wife is not bound to pay him the
marriage debt, and yet has not the power to marry again, so is it in
this case.
