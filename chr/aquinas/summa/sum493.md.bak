### OF CHRIST'S DOCTRINE (FOUR ARTICLES)

We have now to consider Christ's doctrine, about which there are four
points of inquiry:

\(1\) Whether Christ should have preached to the Jews only, or to the
Gentiles also?

\(2\) Whether in preaching He should have avoided the opposition of the
Jews?

\(3\) Whether He should have preached in an open or in a hidden manner?

\(4\) Whether He should have preached by word only, or also by writing?

Concerning the time when He began to teach, we have spoken above when
treating of His baptism (Q\[29\], A\[3\]).

#### Whether Christ should have preached not only to the Jews, but also to the Gentiles?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that Christ should have preached not only
to the Jews, but also to the Gentiles. For it is written (<span
id="TP_Q42_A1-p2.1"></span>[Is. 49:6](../../../bib/vul/isa049.htm#006).md):
"It is a small thing that thou shouldst be My servant to raise up the
tribes of Israel \[Vulg.: 'Jacob'\] and to convert the dregs of Jacob
\[Vulg.: 'Israel'\]: behold, I have given thee to be the light of the
Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation even to the farthest part of
the earth." But Christ gave light and salvation through His doctrine.
Therefore it seems that it was "a small thing" that He preached to Jews
alone, and not to the Gentiles.

**Objection 2:** Further, as it is written (<span
id="TP_Q42_A1-p3.1"></span>[Mat.
7:29](../../../bib/vul/mat007.htm#029).md): "He was teaching them as one
having power." Now the power of doctrine is made more manifest in the
instruction of those who, like the Gentiles, have received no tidings
whatever; hence the Apostle says (<span id="TP_Q42_A1-p3.2"></span>[Rom.
15:20](../../../bib/vul/rom015.htm#020).md): "I have so preached the
\[Vulg.: 'this'\] gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should
build upon another man's foundation." Therefore much rather should
Christ have preached to the Gentiles than to the Jews.

**Objection 3:** Further, it is more useful to instruct many than one.
But Christ instructed some individual Gentiles, such as the Samaritan
woman (<span id="TP_Q42_A1-p4.1"></span>[Jn.
4](../../../bib/vul/joh004.htm#000).md) and the Chananaean woman (<span
id="TP_Q42_A1-p4.2"></span>[Mat. 15](../../../bib/vul/mat015.htm#000).md).
Much more reason, therefore, was there for Christ to preach to the
Gentiles in general.

**On the contrary,** our Lord said (<span
id="TP_Q42_A1-p5.1"></span>[Mat.
15:24](../../../bib/vul/mat015.htm#024).md): "I was not sent but to the
sheep that are lost of the house of Israel." And (<span
id="TP_Q42_A1-p5.2"></span>[Rom.
10:15](../../../bib/vul/rom010.htm#015).md) it is written: "How shall they
preach unless they be sent?" Therefore Christ should not have preached
to the Gentiles.

**I answer that,** It was fitting that Christ's preaching, whether
through Himself or through His apostles, should be directed at first to
the Jews alone. First, in order to show that by His coming the promises
were fulfilled which had been made to the Jews of old, and not to the
Gentiles. Thus the Apostle says (<span id="TP_Q42_A1-p6.1"></span>[Rom.
15:8](../../../bib/vul/rom015.htm#008).md): "I say that Christ . . . was
minister of the circumcision," i.e. the apostle and preacher of the
Jews, "for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the
fathers."

Secondly, in order to show that His coming was of God; because, as is
written<span id="TP_Q42_A1-p7.1"></span> [Rom.
13:1](../../../bib/vul/rom013.htm#001.md): "Those things which are of God
are well ordered \[Vulg.: 'those that are, are ordained of God'\]"
\[\*See Scriptural Index on this passage\]. Now the right order demanded
that the doctrine of Christ should be made known first to the Jews, who,
by believing in and worshiping one God, were nearer to God, and that it
should be transmitted through them to the Gentiles: just as in the
heavenly hierarchy the Divine enlightenment comes to the lower angels
through the higher. Hence on <span id="TP_Q42_A1-p7.2"></span>[Mat.
15:24](../../../bib/vul/mat015.htm#024.md), "I was not sent but to the
sheep that are lost in the house of Israel," Jerome says: "He does not
mean by this that He was not sent to the Gentiles, but that He was sent
to the Jews first." And so we read (<span
id="TP_Q42_A1-p7.3"></span>[Is.
66:19](../../../bib/vul/isa066.htm#019).md): "I will send of them that
shall be saved," i.e. of the Jews, "to the Gentiles . . . and they shall
declare My glory unto the Gentiles."

Thirdly, in order to deprive the Jews of ground for quibbling. Hence on
<span id="TP_Q42_A1-p8.1"></span> [Mat.
10:5,](../../../bib/vul/mat010.htm#005.md) "Go ye not into the way of the
Gentiles." Jerome says: "It behooved Christ's coming to be announced to
the Jews first, lest they should have a valid excuse, and say that they
had rejected our Lord because He had sent His apostles to the Gentiles
and Samaritans."

Fourthly, because it was through the triumph of the cross that Christ
merited power and lordship over the Gentiles. Hence it is written (<span
id="TP_Q42_A1-p9.1"></span>[Rev. 2:26](../../../bib/vul/rev002.htm#026.md),
[28](../../../bib/vul/rev002.htm#028).md): "He that shall overcome . . . I
will give him power over the nations . . . as I also have received of My
Father"; and that because He became "obedient unto the death of the
cross, God hath exalted Him . . . that in the name of Jesus every knee
should bow . . ." and that "every tongue should confess Him" (<span
id="TP_Q42_A1-p9.2"></span>[Phil.
2:8-11](../../../bib/vul/phi002.htm#008).md). Consequently He did not wish
His doctrine to be preached to the Gentiles before His Passion: it was
after His Passion that He said to His disciples (<span
id="TP_Q42_A1-p9.3"></span>[Mat.
28:19](../../../bib/vul/mat028.htm#019).md): "Going, teach ye all nations."
For this reason it was that when, shortly before His Passion, certain
Gentiles wished to see Jesus, He said: "Unless the grain of wheat
falling into the ground dieth, itself remaineth alone: but if it die it
bringeth forth much fruit" (<span id="TP_Q42_A1-p9.4"></span>[Jn.
12:20-25](../../../bib/vul/joh012.htm#020).md); and as Augustine says,
commenting on this passage: "He called Himself the grain of wheat that
must be mortified by the unbelief of the Jews, multiplied by the faith
of the nations."

**Reply to Objection 1:** Christ was given to be the light and salvation
of the Gentiles through His disciples, whom He sent to preach to them.

**Reply to Objection 2:** It is a sign, not of lesser, but of greater
power to do something by means of others rather than by oneself. And
thus the Divine power of Christ was specially shown in this, that He
bestowed on the teaching of His disciples such a power that they
converted the Gentiles to Christ, although these had heard nothing of
Him.

Now the power of Christ's teaching is to be considered in the miracles
by which He confirmed His doctrine, in the efficacy of His persuasion,
and in the authority of His words, for He spoke as being Himself above
the Law when He said: "But I say to you" (<span
id="TP_Q42_A1-p12.1"></span>[Matt.
5:22](../../../bib/vul/mat005.htm#022.md),
[28](../../../bib/vul/mat005.htm#028.md),
[32](../../../bib/vul/mat005.htm#032.md),
[34](../../../bib/vul/mat005.htm#034.md),
[39](../../../bib/vul/mat005.htm#039.md),
[44](../../../bib/vul/mat005.htm#044).md); and, again, in the force of His
righteousness shown in His sinless manner of life.

**Reply to Objection 3:** Just as it was unfitting that Christ should at
the outset make His doctrine known to the Gentiles equally with the
Jews, in order that He might appear as being sent to the Jews, as to the
first-born people; so neither was it fitting for Him to neglect the
Gentiles altogether, lest they should be deprived of the hope of
salvation. For this reason certain individual Gentiles were admitted, on
account of the excellence of their faith and devotedness.

#### Whether Christ should have preached to the Jews without offending them?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that Christ should have preached to the
Jews without offending them. For, as Augustine says (De Agone Christ.
xi): "In the Man Jesus Christ, a model of life is given us by the Son of
God." But we should avoid offending not only the faithful, but even
unbelievers, according to <span id="TP_Q42_A2-p2.1"></span>[1 Cor.
10:32](../../../bib/vul/co1010.htm#032.md): "Be without offense to the
Jews, and to the Gentiles, and to the Church of God." Therefore it seems
that, in His teaching, Christ should also have avoided giving offense to
the Jews.

**Objection 2:** Further, no wise man should do anything that will
hinder the result of his labor. Now through the disturbance which His
teaching occasioned among the Jews, it was deprived of its results; for
it is written (<span id="TP_Q42_A2-p3.1"></span>[Luke
11:53](../../../bib/vul/luk011.htm#053.md),
[54](../../../bib/vul/luk011.htm#054).md) that when our Lord reproved the
Pharisees and Scribes, they "began vehemently to urge Him, end to
oppress His mouth about many things; lying in wait for Him, and seeking
to catch something from His mouth, that they might accuse Him." It seems
therefore unfitting that He should have given them offense by His
teaching.

**Objection 3:** Further, the Apostle says (<span
id="TP_Q42_A2-p4.1"></span>[1 Tim.
5:1](../../../bib/vul/ti1005.htm#001).md): "An ancient man rebuke not; but
entreat him as a father." But the priests and princes of the Jews were
the elders of that people. Therefore it seems that they should not have
been rebuked with severity.

**On the contrary,** It was foretold (<span
id="TP_Q42_A2-p5.1"></span>[Is. 8:14](../../../bib/vul/isa008.htm#014).md)
that Christ would be "for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense
to the two houses of Israel."

**I answer that,** The salvation of the multitude is to be preferred to
the peace of any individuals whatsoever. Consequently, when certain
ones, by their perverseness, hinder the salvation of the multitude, the
preacher and the teacher should not fear to offend those men, in order
that he may insure the salvation of the multitude. Now the Scribes and
Pharisees and the princes of the Jews were by their malice a
considerable hindrance to the salvation of the people, both because they
opposed themselves to Christ's doctrine, which was the only way to
salvation, and because their evil ways corrupted the morals of the
people. For which reason our Lord, undeterred by their taking offense,
publicly taught the truth which they hated, and condemned their vices.
Hence we read (<span id="TP_Q42_A2-p6.1"></span>[Matt.
15:12](../../../bib/vul/mat015.htm#012.md),
[14](../../../bib/vul/mat015.htm#014).md) that when the disciples of our
Lord said: "Dost Thou know that the Pharisees, when they heard this
word, were scandalized?" He answered: "Let them alone: they are blind
and leaders of the blind; and if the blind lead the blind, both fall
into the pit."

**Reply to Objection 1:** A man ought so to avoid giving offense, as
neither by wrong deed or word to be the occasion of anyone's downfall.
"But if scandal arise from truth, the scandal should be borne rather
than the truth be set aside," as Gregory says (Hom. vii in Ezech.).

**Reply to Objection 2:** By publicly reproving the Scribes and
Pharisees, Christ promoted rather than hindered the effect of His
teaching. Because when the people came to know the vices of those men,
they were less inclined to be prejudiced against Christ by hearing what
was said of Him by the Scribes and Pharisees, who were ever withstanding
His doctrine.

**Reply to Objection 3:** This saying of the Apostle is to be understood
of those elders whose years are reckoned not only in age and authority,
but also in probity; according to<span id="TP_Q42_A2-p9.1"></span> [Num.
11:16](../../../bib/vul/num011.htm#016.md): "Gather unto Me seventy men of
the ancients of Israel, whom thou knowest to be ancients . . . of the
people." But if by sinning openly they turn the authority of their years
into an instrument of wickedness, they should be rebuked openly and
severely, as also Daniel says (<span id="TP_Q42_A2-p9.2"></span>[Dan.
13:52](../../../bib/vul/dan013.htm#052).md): "O thou that art grown old in
evil days," etc.

#### Whether Christ should have taught all things openly?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that Christ should not have taught all
things openly. For we read that He taught many things to His disciples
apart: as is seen clearly in the sermon at the Supper. Wherefore He
said: "That which you heard in the ear in the chambers shall be preached
on the housetops" \[\*St. Thomas, probably quoting from memory,
combines<span id="TP_Q42_A3-p2.1"></span> [Mat.
10:27](../../../bib/vul/mat010.htm#027.md) with<span
id="TP_Q42_A3-p2.2"></span> [Lk.
12:3](../../../bib/vul/luk012.htm#003.md)\]. Therefore He did not teach all
things openly.

**Objection 2:** Further, the depths of wisdom should not be expounded
save to the perfect, according to <span id="TP_Q42_A3-p3.1"></span>[1
Cor. 2:6](../../../bib/vul/co1002.htm#006.md): "We speak wisdom among the
perfect." Now Christ's doctrine contained the most profound wisdom.
Therefore it should not have been made known to the imperfect crowd.

**Objection 3:** Further, it comes to the same, to hide the truth,
whether by saying nothing or by making use of a language that is
difficult to understand. Now Christ, by speaking to the multitudes a
language they would not understand, hid from them the truth that He
preached; since "without parables He did not speak to them" (<span
id="TP_Q42_A3-p4.1"></span>[Mat.
13:34](../../../bib/vul/mat013.htm#034).md). In the same way, therefore, He
could have hidden it from them by saying nothing at all.

**On the contrary,** He says Himself (<span
id="TP_Q42_A3-p5.1"></span>[Jn.
18:20](../../../bib/vul/joh018.htm#020).md): "In secret I have spoken
nothing."

**I answer that,** Anyone's doctrine may be hidden in three ways. First,
on the part of the intention of the teacher, who does not wish to make
his doctrine known to many, but rather to hide it. And this may happen
in two ways---sometimes through envy on the part of the teacher, who
desires to excel in his knowledge, wherefore he is unwilling to
communicate it to others. But this was not the case with Christ, in
whose person the following words are spoken (<span
id="TP_Q42_A3-p6.1"></span>[Wis.
7:13](../../../bib/vul/wis007.htm#013).md): "Which I have learned without
guile, and communicate without envy, and her riches I hide not." But
sometimes this happens through the vileness of the things taught; thus
Augustine says on<span id="TP_Q42_A3-p6.2"></span> [Jn.
16:12](../../../bib/vul/joh016.htm#012.md): "There are some things so bad
that no sort of human modesty can bear them." Wherefore of heretical
doctrine it is written (<span id="TP_Q42_A3-p6.3"></span>[Prov.
9:17](../../../bib/vul/pro009.htm#017).md): "Stolen waters are sweeter."
Now, Christ's doctrine is "not of error nor of uncleanness" (<span
id="TP_Q42_A3-p6.4"></span>[1 Thess.
2:3](../../../bib/vul/th1002.htm#003).md). Wherefore our Lord says (<span
id="TP_Q42_A3-p6.5"></span>[Mk. 4:21](../../../bib/vul/mar004.htm#021).md):
"Doth a candle," i.e. true and pure doctrine, "come in to be put under a
bushel?"

Secondly, doctrine is hidden because it is put before few. And thus,
again, did Christ teach nothing in secret: for He propounded His entire
doctrine either to the whole crowd or to His disciples gathered
together. Hence Augustine says on<span id="TP_Q42_A3-p7.1"></span> [Jn.
18:20](../../../bib/vul/joh018.htm#020.md): "How can it be said that He
speaks in secret when He speaks before so many men? . . . especially if
what He says to few He wishes through them to be made known to many?"

Thirdly, doctrine is hidden, as to the manner in which it is propounded.
And thus Christ spoke certain things in secret to the crowds, by
employing parables in teaching them spiritual mysteries which they were
either unable or unworthy to grasp: and yet it was better for them to be
instructed in the knowledge of spiritual things, albeit hidden under the
garb of parables, than to be deprived of it altogether. Nevertheless our
Lord expounded the open and unveiled truth of these parables to His
disciples, so that they might hand it down to others worthy of it;
according to <span id="TP_Q42_A3-p8.1"></span>[2 Tim.
2:2](../../../bib/vul/ti2002.htm#002.md): "The things which thou hast heard
of me by many witnesses, the same command to faithful men, who shall be
fit to teach others." This is foreshadowed, <span
id="TP_Q42_A3-p8.2"></span>[Num. 4](../../../bib/vul/num004.htm#000.md),
where the sons of Aaron are commanded to wrap up the sacred vessels that
were to be carried by the Levites.

**Reply to Objection 1:** As Hilary says, commenting on the passage
quoted, "we do not read that our Lord was wont to preach at night, and
expound His doctrine in the dark: but He says this because His speech is
darkness to the carnal-minded, and His words are night to the
unbeliever. His meaning, therefore, is that whatever He said we also
should say in the midst of unbelievers, by openly believing and
professing it."

Or, according to Jerome, He speaks comparatively---that is to say,
because He was instructing them in Judea, which was a small place
compared with the whole world, where Christ's doctrine was to be
published by the preaching of the apostles.

**Reply to Objection 2:** By His doctrine our Lord did not make known
all the depths of His wisdom, neither to the multitudes, nor, indeed, to
His disciples, to whom He said (<span id="TP_Q42_A3-p11.1"></span>[Jn.
16:12](../../../bib/vul/joh016.htm#012).md): "I have yet many things to say
to you, but you cannot bear them now." Yet whatever things out of His
wisdom He judged it right to make known to others, He expounded, not in
secret, but openly; although He was not understood by all. Hence
Augustine says on <span id="TP_Q42_A3-p11.2"></span> [Jn.
18:20](../../../bib/vul/joh018.htm#020.md): "We must understand this, 'I
have spoken openly to the world,' as though our Lord had said, 'Many
have heard Me' . . . and, again, it was not 'openly,' because they did
not understand."

**Reply to Objection 3:** As stated above, our Lord spoke to the
multitudes in parables, because they were neither able nor worthy to
receive the naked truth, which He revealed to His disciples.

And when it is said that "without parables He did not speak to them,"
according to Chrysostom (Hom. xlvii in Matth.), we are to understand
this of that particular sermon, since on other occasions He said many
things to the multitude without parables. Or, as Augustine says (De Qq.
Evang., qu. xvii), this means, "not that He spoke nothing literally, but
that He scarcely ever spoke without introducing a parable, although He
also spoke some things in the literal sense."

#### Whether Christ should have committed His doctrine to writing?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that Christ should have committed His
doctrine to writing. For the purpose of writing is to hand down doctrine
to posterity. Now Christ's doctrine was destined to endure for ever,
according to<span id="TP_Q42_A4-p2.1"></span> [Lk.
21:33](../../../bib/vul/luk021.htm#033.md): "Heaven and earth shall pass
away, but My words shall not pass away." Therefore it seems that Christ
should have committed His doctrine to writing.

**Objection 2:** Further, the Old Law was a foreshadowing of Christ,
according to <span id="TP_Q42_A4-p3.1"></span> [Heb.
10:1](../../../bib/vul/heb010.htm#001.md): "The Law has \[Vulg.: 'having'\]
a shadow of the good things to come." Now the Old Law was put into
writing by God, according to <span id="TP_Q42_A4-p3.2"></span>[Ex.
24:12](../../../bib/vul/exo024.htm#012.md): "I will give thee" two "tables
of stone and the law, and the commandments which I have written."
Therefore it seems that Christ also should have put His doctrine into
writing.

**Objection 3:** Further, to Christ, who came to enlighten them that sit
in darkness (<span id="TP_Q42_A4-p4.1"></span>[Lk.
1:79](../../../bib/vul/luk001.htm#079).md), it belonged to remove occasions
of error, and to open out the road to faith. Now He would have done this
by putting His teaching into writing: for Augustine says (De Consensu
Evang. i) that "some there are who wonder why our Lord wrote nothing, so
that we have to believe what others have written about Him. Especially
do those pagans ask this question who dare not blame or blaspheme
Christ, and who ascribe to Him most excellent, but merely human, wisdom.
These say that the disciples made out the Master to be more than He
really was when they said that He was the Son of God and the Word of
God, by whom all things were made." And farther on he adds: "It seems as
though they were prepared to believe whatever He might have written of
Himself, but not what others at their discretion published about Him."
Therefore it seems that Christ should have Himself committed His
doctrine to writing.

**On the contrary,** No books written by Him were to be found in the
canon of Scripture.

**I answer that,** It was fitting that Christ should not commit His
doctrine to writing. First, on account of His dignity: for the more
excellent the teacher, the more excellent should be his manner of
teaching. Consequently it was fitting that Christ, as the most excellent
of teachers, should adopt that manner of teaching whereby His doctrine
is imprinted on the hearts of His hearers; wherefore it is written
(<span id="TP_Q42_A4-p6.1"></span>[Mat.
7:29](../../../bib/vul/mat007.htm#029).md) that "He was teaching them as
one having power." And so it was that among the Gentiles, Pythagoras and
Socrates, who were teachers of great excellence, were unwilling to write
anything. For writings are ordained, as to an end, unto the imprinting
of doctrine in the hearts of the hearers.

Secondly, on account of the excellence of Christ's doctrine, which
cannot be expressed in writing; according to<span
id="TP_Q42_A4-p7.1"></span> [Jn.
21:25](../../../bib/vul/joh021.htm#025.md): "There are also many other
things which Jesus did: which, if they were written everyone, the world
itself, I think, would not be able to contain the books that should be
written." Which Augustine explains by saying: "We are not to believe
that in respect of space the world could not contain them . . . but that
by the capacity of the readers they could not be comprehended." And if
Christ had committed His doctrine to writing, men would have had no
deeper thought of His doctrine than that which appears on the surface of
the writing.

Thirdly, that His doctrine might reach all in an orderly manner: Himself
teaching His disciples immediately, and they subsequently teaching
others, by preaching and writing: whereas if He Himself had written, His
doctrine would have reached all immediately.

Hence it is said of Wisdom (<span id="TP_Q42_A4-p9.1"></span>[Prov.
9:3](../../../bib/vul/pro009.htm#003).md) that "she hath sent her maids to
invite to the tower." It is to be observed, however, that, as Augustine
says (De Consensu Evang. i), some of the Gentiles thought that Christ
wrote certain books treating of the magic art whereby He worked
miracles: which art is condemned by the Christian learning. "And yet
they who claim to have read those books of Christ do none of those
things which they marvel at His doing according to those same books.
Moreover, it is by a Divine judgment that they err so far as to assert
that these books were, as it were, entitled as letters to Peter and
Paul, for that they found them in several places depicted in company
with Christ. No wonder that the inventors were deceived by the painters:
for as long as Christ lived in the mortal flesh with His disciples, Paul
was no disciple of His."

**Reply to Objection 1:** As Augustine says in the same book: "Christ is
the head of all His disciples who are members of His body. Consequently,
when they put into writing what He showed forth and said to them, by no
means must we say that He wrote nothing: since His members put forth
that which they knew under His dictation. For at His command they, being
His hands, as it were, wrote whatever He wished us to read concerning
His deeds and words."

**Reply to Objection 2:** Since the old Law was given under the form of
sensible signs, therefore also was it fittingly written with sensible
signs. But Christ's doctrine, which is "the law of the spirit of life"
(<span id="TP_Q42_A4-p11.1"></span>[Rom.
8:2](../../../bib/vul/rom008.htm#002).md), had to be "written not with ink,
but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in
the fleshly tables of the heart," as the Apostle says (<span
id="TP_Q42_A4-p11.2"></span>[2 Cor.
3:3](../../../bib/vul/co2003.htm#003).md).

**Reply to Objection 3:** Those who were unwilling to believe what the
apostles wrote of Christ would have refused to believe the writings of
Christ, whom they deemed to work miracles by the magic art.

ARTICLES)](sum494.md)
