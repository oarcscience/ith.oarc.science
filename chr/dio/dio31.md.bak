<span id="ii.iv.ii.vii-p1"></span>**LETTER VII.**

<span id="ii.iv.ii.vii-p2"></span>SECTION I. *To Polycarp--Hierarch.*

<span id="ii.iv.ii.vii-p3"></span>I, at any rate, am not conscious, when
speaking in reply to Greeks or others, of fancying to assist good men,
in case they should be able to know and speak the very truth, as it
really is in itself. For, when this is correctly demonstrated in its
essential nature, according to a law of truth, and has been established
without flaw, every thing which is otherwise, and simulates the truth,
will be convicted of being other <span id="page_146">p. 146</span> <span
id="ii.iv.ii.vii-Page_146"></span> than the reality, and dissimilar, and
that which is seeming rather than real. It is superfluous then, that the
expounder of truth should contend with these or those <span
id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md) . For each affirms himself to have the
royal coin, and perchance has some deceptive image of a certain portion
of the true. And, if you refute this, first the one, and then the other,
will contend concerning the same. But, when the true statement itself
has been correctly laid down, and has remained unrefuted by all the
rest, every thing which is not so in every respect is cast down of
itself, by the impregnable stability of the really true. Having then as
I think well understood this, I have not been over zealous to speak in
reply to Greeks or to others; but it is sufficient for me (and may God
grant this), first to know about truth, then, having known, to speak as
it is fitting to speak.

<span id="ii.iv.ii.vii-p4"></span>SECTION II.

<span id="ii.iv.ii.vii-p5"></span>But you say, the Sophist Apollophanes
rails at me, and calls me parricide, as using, not piously, the writings
of Greeks against the Greeks. Yet, in reply to him, it were more true
for us to say, that Greeks use, not piously, things Divine against
things Divine, attempting through the wisdom of Almighty God to eject
the Divine Worship. And I am not speaking of the opinion of the
multitude, who cling tenaciously to the writings of the poets, with
earthly and impassioned proclivities, and Worship the creature <span
id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) rather than the Creator; but even
Apollophanes <span id="page_147">p. 147</span> <span
id="ii.iv.ii.vii-Page_147"></span> himself uses not piously things
Divine against things Divine; for by the knowledge of things created,
well called Philosophy by him, and by the divine Paul named Wisdom of
God, the true philosophers ought to have been elevated to the Cause of
things created and of the knowledge of them. And in order that he may
not improperly impute to me the opinion of others, or that of himself,
Apollophanes, being a wise man, ought to recognise that nothing could
otherwise be removed from its heavenly course and movement, if it had
not the Sustainer and Cause of its being moving it thereto, who forms
all things, and "transforms them <span id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) "
according to the sacred text. How then does he not worship Him, known to
us even from this, and verily being God of the whole, admiring Him for
His all causative and super-inexpressible power, when sun <span
id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md) and moon, together with the universe, by
a power and stability most supernatural, were fixed by them to entire
immobility, and, for a measure of a whole day, all the constellations
stood in the same places; or (which is greater than even this), if when
the whole and the greater and embracing were thus carried along, those
embraced did not follow in their course; and when a certain other
day <span id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) was almost tripled in duration,
even in twenty whole hours <span id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md) , either
the universe retraced contrary routes for so long a time, and (was)
<span id="page_148">p. 148</span> <span
id="ii.iv.ii.vii-Page_148"></span> turned back by the thus very most
supernatural backward revolutions; or the sun, in its own course, having
contracted its five-fold motion in ten hours, retrogressively again
retraced it in the other ten hours, by traversing a sort of new route.
This thing indeed naturally astounded even Babylonians <span
id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md) , and, without battle, brought them into
subjection to Hezekiah, as though he were a somebody equal to God, and
superior to ordinary men. And, by no means do I allege the great works
in Egypt <span id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md) , or certain other Divine
portents, which took place elsewhere, but the well-known and celestial
ones, which were renowned in every place and by all persons. But
Apollophanes is ever saying that these things are not true. At any rate
then, this is reported by the Persian sacerdotal legends, and to this
day, Magi celebrate the memorials of the threefold Mithrus <span
id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md) . But let him disbelieve these things, by
reason of his ignorance or his inexperience. Say to him, however, "What
do you affirm concerning the eclipse, which took place at the time of
the saving Cross <span id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82.md) ?" For both of us
at that time, at Heliopolis, being present, and standing together, saw
the moon approaching the sun, to our surprise (for it was not appointed
time for conjunction); and again, from the ninth hour to the evening,
supernaturally placed back again into a line opposite <span
id="page_149">p. 149</span> <span id="ii.iv.ii.vii-Page_149"></span> the
sun. And remind him also of something further. For he knows that we saw,
to our surprise, the contact itself beginning from the east, and going
towards the edge of the sun’s disc, then receding back, and again, both
the contact and the re-clearing <span id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83.md) ,
not taking place from the same point, but from that diametrically
opposite. So great are the supernatural things of that appointed time,
and possible to Christ alone, the Cause of all, Who worketh great things
and marvellous, of which there is not number.

<span id="ii.iv.ii.vii-p6"></span>SECTION III.

<span id="ii.iv.ii.vii-p7"></span>These things say, if occasion serves,
and if possible, O Apollophanes, refute them, and to me, who was then
both present with thee, and saw and judged and wondered with thee at
them all. And in truth Apollophanes begins prophesying at that time, I
know not whence, and to me he said, as if conjecturing the things taking
place, "these things, O excellent Dionysius, are requitals of Divine
deeds." Let so much be said by us by letter; but you are capable, both
to supply the deficiency, and to bring eventually to God that
distinguished man, who is wise in many things, and who perhaps will not
disdain to meekly learn the truth, which is above wisdom, of our
religion. <span id="page_150">p. 150</span> <span

<span id="fn_78"></span>[147:79](dio31.htm#fr_78.md) <span
id="ii.iv.ii.vii-p5.12"></span>The "twenty hours" which made one day
almost equal to three are reckoned thus. A degree represents an hour.
The Sun went down ten degrees = ten hours. The Sun had then run already
a course of ten hours, from 6 A.M. to 4 P.M. In returning there were ten
hours more, and in retracing the route ten hours more, which together
make thirty hours. The two hours, to complete the day of twelve hours,
make thirty-two hours. The thirty-two hours are four hours less than
thirty-six, the time of three days of twelve hours each. One day was
thus nearly equal to three. Whatever we may think the facts, the
Babylonians commemorated the threefold Mythra --the Sun--in consequence.
