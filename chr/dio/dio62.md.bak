### <span id="iv.iii.iv-p0.1"></span>CAPUT IV.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p1"></span><span id="iv.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>I.
Concerning things performed in the Muron, and concerning things
perfected in it.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p2"></span>So great and so beautiful are the
intelligible visions of the most holy Synaxis, which minister
hierarchically, as we have often said, our participation in, and
collection towards, the One. But there is another perfecting Service of
the same rank, which our Leaders name "Initiation of Muron," by
contemplating whose parts in due order, in accordance with the sacred
images, we shall thus be borne, by hierarchical contemplations, to its
Oneness through its parts.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p3"></span><span id="iv.iii.iv-p3.1"></span>II.
Mysterion of Initiation of Muron <span id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md)
.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p4"></span>In the same way as in the Synaxis, the
orders of the imperfect are dismissed, that is, after the hierarchical
procession has made the whole circuit of the temple, attended with
fragrant incense; and the chanting of the Psalms, and.the reading of the
most Divine Oracles. Then the Hierarch takes the Muron and places it,
veiled under twelve sacred wings, upon the Divine Altar, whilst all cry
aloud, with most devout voice, the sacred melody of the inspiration of
the God-rapt Prophets, and when he has finished the prayer offered over
it, he uses it, <span id="page_111">p. 111</span> <span
id="iv.iii.iv-Page_111"></span>in the most holy mystic Rites of things
being hallowed, for almost every Hierarchical consecration.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p5"></span><span id="iv.iii.iv-p5.1"></span>III.
Contemplation.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p6"></span>Section I.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p7"></span>The elementary teaching, then, of this
the perfecting service, through the things done over the Divine Muron,
shews this, in my judgment, that, that which is holy and of sweet savour
in the minds of devout men is covered, as with a veil, since it Divinely
enjoins upon holy men to have their beautiful and well-savoured
assimilations in virtue to the hidden God not seen for vain glory. For
the hidden comeliness of God is unsullied, and is sweet beyond
conception, and manifested for spiritual contemplation to the
intellectual alone, through a desire to have the unsullied images of
virtue in souls of the same pattern. For by looking away from the
undistorted and well imitated image of the Godlike virtue to that
contemplated and fragrant beauty, he thus moulds and fashions it to the
most beautiful imitation. And, as in the case of sensible images, if the
artist look without distraction upon the archetypal form, not distracted
by sight of anything else, or in any way divided in attention, he will
duplicate, if I may so speak, the very person that is being sketched,
whoever he may be, and will shew the reality in the likeness, and the
archetype in the image, and each in each, save the difference of
substance; thus, to copyists who love the beautiful <span
id="page_112">p. 112</span> <span id="iv.iii.iv-Page_112"></span>in
mind, the persistent and unflinching contemplation of the sweet-savoured
and hidden beauty will confer the unerring and most Godlike
appearance <span id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) . Naturally, then,
the divine copyists, who unflinchingly mould their own intellectual
contemplation to the superessentially sweet and contemplated comeliness,
do. none of their divinely imitated virtues "to be seen of men <span
id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) , as the Divine text expresses it; but
reverently gaze upon the most holy things of the Church, veiled in the
Divine Muron as in a figure. Wherefore, these also, by religiously
concealing that which is holy and most Divine in virtue within their
Godlike and God-engraved mind, look away to the archetypal conception
alone; for not only are they blind to things dissimilar, but neither are
they drawn down to gaze upon them. Wherefore, as becomes their
character, they do neither love things, merely seeming good and just,
but those really being such; nor do they look to opinion, upon which the
multitude irrationally congratulate themselves, but, after the Divine
example, by distinguishing the good or evil as it is in itself, they are
Divine images of the most supremely Divine sweetness, which, having the
truly sweet within itself, is not turned to the anomalously seeming of
the multitude, moulding Its genuineness to the true images of Itself.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p8"></span>Section II.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p9"></span>Come, then, since we have viewed the
exterior comeliness of the entirely beautiful ministration, let <span
id="page_113">p. 113</span> <span id="iv.iii.iv-Page_113"></span>us now
look away to its more godly beauty (whilst itself, by itself, has
uncovered the veils), gazing upon its blessed radiance, shedding its
bright beams openly around, and filling us with the fragrance unveiled
to the contemplators. For the visible consecration of the Muron is
neither uncommunicated in, or unseen by those who surround the Hierarch,
but, on the contrary, by passing through to them, and fixing the
contemplation above the many, is reverently covered by them, and by
Hierarchical direction kept from the multitude.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p10"></span>For the splendour of things all holy, by
shedding its light clearly and without symbol to men inspired, as being
congenial to the thing contemplated, and perfuming their contemplating
perceptions without; concealment, advances not yet in the same way to
the inferior, but by them as deep contemplators of the thing
contemplated is concealed under the enigmas of the wings, without
ostentation, so that it may not be defiled by the dissimilar; through
which sacred enigmas the well-ordered Ranks of the subordinate are
conducted to the degree of holiness compatible with their powers.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p11"></span>Section III.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p12"></span>The holy consecration, then, which we
are now extolling, is, as I said, of the perfecting rank and capacity of
the Hierarchical functions. Wherefore our Divine Leaders arranged the
same, as being of the same rank and effect as the holy perfecting of the
Synaxis, with the same figures, for the most <span id="page_114">p.
114</span> <span id="iv.iii.iv-Page_114"></span> part, and with mystical
regulations and lections. And you may see in like manner the Hierarch
bearing forward the sweet perfume from the more holy place into the
sacred precincts beyond, and teaching, by the return to the same, that
the participation in things Divine comes to all holy persons, according
to fitness, and is undiminished and altogether unmoved and stands
unchangeably in its identity, as beseems Divine fixity. In the same way
the Psalms and readings of the Oracles nurse the imperfect to a
life-bringing adoption of sons, and form a religious inclination in
those who are possessed with accursed spirits, and dispel the opposing
fear and effeminacy from those possessed by a spirit of unmanliness;
shewing to them, according to their capacity, the highest pinnacle of
the Godlike habit and power, by aid of which they will, the rather,
scare away the opposing forces, and will take the lead in healing
others; and, following the example of God, they will, whilst unmoved
from their own proper gifts, not only be active against those opposing
fears, but will themselves give activity to others; and they also impart
a religious habit to those who have changed from the worse to a
religious mind, so that they should not be again enslaved by evil, and
purify completely those who need to become altogether pure; and they
lead the holy to the Divine likenesses, and contemplations and
communions belonging to themselves, and so establish those who are
entirely holy, in blessed and intelligible visions, <span
id="page_115">p. 115</span> <span id="iv.iii.iv-Page_115"></span>
fulfilling their uniform likeness of the One, and making them one.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p13"></span>Section IV.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p14"></span>What, then, shall I say further? Is it
not those Ranks already mentioned, which are not entirely pure, that the
present consecrating service excludes without distinction, in the same
way as the Synaxis, so that it is viewed by the holy alone, in figures,
and is contemplated and ministered, by the perfectly holy alone,
immediately, through hierarchical directions? Now it is superfluous, as
I think, to run over, by the same statements, these things already so
often mentioned, and not to pass to the next, viewing the Hierarch,
devoutly holding the Divine Muron veiled under twelve wings, and
ministering the altogether holy consecration upon it. Let us then affirm
that the composition of the Muron is a composition of sweet-smelling
materials, which has in itself abundantly fragrant qualities, of which
(composition) those who partake become perfumed in proportion to the
degree to which they partake of its sweet savour. Now we are persuaded
that the most supremely Divine Jesus is superessentially of good savour,
filling the contemplative part of ourselves by bequests of Divine
sweetness for contemplation. For if the reception of the sensible odours
make to feel joyous, and nourishes, with much sweetness, the sensitive
organs of our nostrils, --if at least they be sound and well apportioned
to the sweet savour--in the same way any one might <span
id="page_116">p. 116</span> <span id="iv.iii.iv-Page_116"></span> say
that our contemplative faculties, being soundly disposed as regards the
subjection to the worse, in the strength of the distinguishing faculty
implanted in us by nature, receive the supremely Divine fragrance, and
are filled with a holy comfort and most Divine nourishment, in
accordance with Divinely fixed proportions, and the correlative turning
of the mind towards the Divine Being. Wherefore, the symbolical
composition of the Muron, as expressing in form things that are
formless, depicts to us Jesus Himself, as a well-spring of the wealth of
the Divine sweet receptions, distributing, in degrees supremely Divine,
for the most Godlike of the contemplators, the most Divine perfumes;
upon which the Minds, joyfully refreshed, and filled with the holy
receptions, indulge in a feast of spiritual contemplation, by the
entrance of the sweet bequests into their contemplative part, as beseems
a Divine participation.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p15"></span>Section V.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p16"></span>Now it is evident, as I think, that the
distribution of the fontal perfume to the Beings above ourselves, who
are more Divine, is, as it were, nearer, and manifests and distributes
itself more to the transparent and wholesome mental condition of their
receptive faculty, overflowing ungrudgingly and entering in many
fashions; but as regards the subordinate contemplators, which are not so
receptive, piously concealing the highest vision and <span
id="page_117">p. 117</span> <span
id="iv.iii.iv-Page_117"></span>participation, it is distributed in a
supremely Divine proportion, in fragrance corresponding to the
recipients. Amongst the holy Beings, then, who are above us, the
superior order of the Seraphim is represented under the figure of the
twelve wings, established and fixed around Jesus, casting itself upon
the most blessed contemplations of Him, as far as permissible, and
filled reverently with the contemplated truth distributed in most pure
receptions, and, to speak after the manner of men, crying aloud, with
never silent lips, the frequent Hymn of Praise; for the sacred knowledge
of the supermundane minds is both untiring, and possesses the Divine
love without intermission, and is at the same time superior to all
baseness and forgetfulness. Hence, as I think, that phrase, "unceasing
cry," suggests their perpetual and persistent science and conception of
things Divine, with full concord and thanksgiving.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p17"></span>Section VI.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p18"></span>Now we have, as I think, sufficiently
contemplated, in the description of the super-heavenly Hierarchy, the
incorporeal properties of the Seraphim, Divinely described in the
Scriptures under sensible figures explanatory of the contemplated
Beings, and we have made them evident to thy contemplating eyes.
Nevertheless, since now also they who stand reverently around the
Hierarch, <span id="page_118">p. 118</span> <span
id="iv.iii.iv-Page_118"></span>reflect the highest Order, on a small
scale, we will now view with most immaterial visions their most Godlike
splendour.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p19"></span>Section VII.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p20"></span>Their numberless faces then, and many
feet, manifest, as I think, their property of viewing the most Divine
illuminations from many sides, and their conception of the good things
of God as ever active and abundantly receptive; and the sixfold
arrangement of the wings, of which the Scripture speaks, does not, I
think, denote, as seems to some, a sacred number, but that of the
highest Essence and Order around God; the first and middle and last of
its contemplative and Godlike powers are altogether elevating, free, and
supermundane. Hence the most holy wisdom of the Oracles, when reverently
describing the formation of the wings, places the wings around their
heads <span id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) , and middle, and feet;
suggesting their complete covering with wings, and their manifold
faculty of leading to the Really Being.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p21"></span>Section VIII.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p22"></span>Now if they cover their faces and their
feet, and fly by their middle wings only, bear this reverently in mind,
that the Order, so far exalted above the highest beings, is circumspect
respecting the more lofty and deep of its conceptions, and raises
itself, <span id="page_119">p. 119</span> <span
id="iv.iii.iv-Page_119"></span>in due proportion, by its middle wings,
to the vision of God, by placing its own proper life under the Divine
yokes, and by these is reverently directed to the judgment of itself.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p23"></span>Section IX.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p24"></span>And, as regards the statement of Holy
Scripture, that "one cried out to the other," that shews, I think, that
they impart to each other ungrudgingly their own visions of God. And
this we should deem worthy of religious recollection, that the Hebrew
word in the Holy Scriptures names the most holy Beings of the Seraphim
by an explanatory epithet, from their glowing and seething in a Divine
and ever-moving life.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p25"></span>Section X.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p26"></span>Since, then, as those who understand
Hebrew say, the most Divine Seraphim were named by the Word of God,
"Kindling" and "Heating," by a name expressive of their essential
condition, they possess, according to the symbolical imagery of the
Divine Muron, most elevating powers, which call it to manifestation and
distribution of most exhilarating perfumes. For the Being, sweet beyond
conception, loves to be moved by the glowing and most pure minds into
manifestation, and imparts Its most Divine inspirations, in cheerful
distributions, to those who thus supermundanely call It forth. Thus the
most Divine Order of supercelestial Beings did <span id="page_120">p.
120</span> <span id="iv.iii.iv-Page_120"></span>not fail to recognize
the most supremely Divine Jesus, when He descended for the purpose of
being sanctified; but recognizes, reverently, Him lowering Himself in
our belongings, through Divine and inexpressible goodness; and when
viewing Him sanctified, in a manner befitting man, by the Father and
Himself and the Holy Spirit, recognized its own supreme Head as being
essentially unchanged, in whatever He may do as supreme God. Hence the
tradition of the sacred symbols places the Seraphim near the Divine
Muron, when it is being consecrated, recognizing and describing the
Christ as unchanged, in our complete manhood in very truth. And what is
still more divine is, that it uses the Divine Muron for the consecration
of every thing sacred, distinctly shewing, according to the Logion, the
Sanctified Sanctifying, as always being the same with Himself throughout
the whole supremely Divine sanctification. Wherefore also the
consecrating gift and grace of the Divine Birth in God is completed in
the most Divine perfectings of the Muron. Whence, as I think, the
Hierarch pouring the Muron upon the purifying font in cruciform
injections, brings to view, for contemplative eyes, the Lord Jesus
descending even to death itself through the cross, for our Birth in God,
benevolently drawing up, from the old gulping of the destructive death,
by the same Divine and resistless descent, those, who, according to the
<span id="page_121">p. 121</span> <span id="iv.iii.iv-Page_121"></span>
mysterious saying, "are baptized into His death," and renewing them to a
godly and eternal existence.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p27"></span>Section XI.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p28"></span>But further, the perfecting unction of
the Muron gives to him who has been initiated in the most sacred
initiation of the Birth in God, the abiding of the supremely Divine
Spirit; the sacred imagery of the symbols, portraying, as I think, the
most Divine Spirit abundantly supplied by Him, Who, for our sakes, has
been sanctified as man by the supremely Divine Spirit, in an unaltered
condition of His essential Godhead.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p29"></span>Section XII.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p30"></span>And bear this also hierarchically in
mind, that the Law of the most pure initiation completes the sacred
consecration of the Divine Altar, by the all pure effusions of the most
holy Muron. And the supercelestial and superessential contemplation is
source and essence, and perfecting power, of all our deifying holiness.
For if our most Divine Altar is Jesus--the supremely Divine sanctifying
of the Godly Minds --in Whom, according to the Logion, "being sanctified
and mystically offered as a whole burnt-offering, we have the access,"
let us gaze with supermundane eyes upon the most Divine Altar itself (in
which things being perfected, are perfected and sanctified), being
perfected from the most Divine Muron itself; for <span id="page_122">p.
122</span> <span id="iv.iii.iv-Page_122"></span> the altogether most
holy Jesus sanctifies Himself on our behalf, and fills us full of every
sanctification, since the things consecrated upon them pass fraternally
afterwards in their beneficent effects to us, as children of God. Hence,
as I think, the Divine Leaders of our Hierarchy, in conformity with a
Hierarchical conception divinely transmitted, name this altogether
august ministration "consecration of Muron," from "being consecrated
thoroughly," as one might say, "consecration of God," extolling its
divine consecrating work in each sense. For both the being sanctified
for our sakes, as becomes Man, and the consecrating all things as
supreme God, and the sanctifying things being consecrated, is
"consecration of Him." As for the sacred song of the inspiration of the
God-rapt Prophets, it is called by those who know Hebrew, the "Praise of
God," or "Praise ye the Lord," for since every divine manifestation and
work of God is reverently portrayed in the varied composition of the
Hierarchical symbols, it is not unfitting to mention the Divinely moved
song of the Prophets; for it teaches at once, distinctly and reverently,
that the beneficent works of the Divine Goodness are worthy of devout
praise. <span id="page_123">p. 123</span> <span
