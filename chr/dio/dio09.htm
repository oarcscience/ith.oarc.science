<p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.vi-p1"></A>Concerning Life.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.vi-p2"></A>SECTION I.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ii.ii.vi-p3"></A>Now let us sing the Eternal Life, from which comes the self-existing Life, and  every life; and from which, to all things however partaking of life, is distributed  the power to live appropriately to each. Certainly the life; and  the immortality of the immortal Angels, and the very indestructibility of the angelic  perpetual motion, both is, and is sustained from It, and by reason of It. Wherefore,  they are also called living always and immortal; and again, not immortal, because  not from themselves have they their immortality and eternal life; but from the vivifying  Cause forming and sustaining all life; and as we said of Him, Who is, that He is  Age even of the self-existing Being, so also here again (we say) that the Divine  Life, which is above life, is  <A NAME="page_84"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 84</FONT></A> <a name="ii.ii.ii.vi-Page_84"></A> life-giving and sustaining even of the self-existing Life; and every  life and life-giving movement is from the Life which is above every life, and all  source of all life. From It, even the souls have their indestructibility, and all  living creatures, and plants in their most remote echo of life, have their power  to live. And when It is "taken away," according to the Divine saying, all life fails,  and to It even things that have failed, through their inability to participate in  It, when again returning, again become living creatures.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.vi-p4"></A>SECTION II.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ii.ii.vi-p5"></A>And It gives chiefly to the self-existing Life to be a life, and to every life,  and to the individual life, that each should be conformable to that which nature  intended it to be. And to the supercelestial lives It gives the immaterial and godlike,  and unchangeable immortality; and the unswerving and undeviating perpetual movement;  whilst extending Itself through excess of goodness, even to the life of demons&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#fn_46"><FONT SIZE="1">47</FONT></A>
. For, neither  has this its being from another cause, but from It life has both its being and its  continuance. Further, It bequeaths even to men the angelic life, so far as is possible  to compound being, and through an overflowing love towards man turns, and calls  us back to Itself, even when we are departing from It; and, what is still more Divine,  promises to transfer even our whole selves (I mean souls, and bodies their yoke-fellows),  to a perfect life  <A NAME="page_85"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 85</FONT></A> <a name="ii.ii.ii.vi-Page_85"></A> and immortality;--a fact which perhaps seems to Antiquity contrary  to nature, but to me, and to thee, and to the truth, both Divine and above  nature. But, by "above nature," I understand our visible nature, not the  all-powerful nature of the Divine Life. For, to this, as being nature of all the  living creatures, and especially the more Divine, no life is against nature, or  above nature. So that the contradictory statements of Simon&#8217;s folly on this matter, let them be far  repelled from a Divine assembly, and from thy reverent soul. For this escaped him,  as I imagine, whilst thinking to be wise, that the right-thinking man ought not  to use the visible reason of the sensible perception, as an ally against the invisible  Cause of all; and this must be our reply to him, that his statement is against nature,  for to It nothing is contrary.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.vi-p6"></A>SECTION III.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ii.ii.vi-p7"></A>From It, both all living creatures and plants draw their life and nourishment;  and whether you speak of intellectual, or rational, or sensible, or nourishing,  or growing, or whatever, life, or source of life, or essence of life, from It, which  is above every life, it both lives and thrives; and in It, as Cause, uniformly pre-existed.  For the super-living, and life-springing Life is Cause both of all life, and is  generative, and completive, and dividing of life, and is to be celebrated from every  life, in consequence of its numerous generation of all lives, as Manifold, and contemplated,  and sung by every life; and as  <A NAME="page_86"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A> <a name="ii.ii.ii.vi-Page_86"></A> without need, yea, rather, superfull of life, the Self-living, and  above every life, causing to live and super-living, or in whatever way one might  extol the life which is unutterable by human speech.</p>
