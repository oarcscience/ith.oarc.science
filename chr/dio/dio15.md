### <span id="ii.ii.ii.xii-p0.1"></span>CAPUT XII.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.xii-p1"></span>Concerning Holy of Holies, King of
Kings, Lord of Lords, God of Gods.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.xii-p2"></span>SECTION I.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.xii-p3"></span>BUT since whatever we have to say on
these matters has reached, in my opinion, a fitting conclusion, we must
sing Him of endless names, both <span id="page_120">p. 120</span> <span
id="ii.ii.ii.xii-Page_120"></span> as *Holy of Holies* and *King of
Kings;* and as ruling eternity and for ever and beyond, and as *Lord of
Lords,* and *God of Gods.* And first we must say, what we think Holiness
Itself is; and what Kingdom, and what Lordship, and what Divinity, and
what the Oracles wish to denote by the duplication of the names.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.xii-p4"></span>SECTION II.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.xii-p5"></span>Holiness then is (so far as we can
say) the purity free from every pollution, and all perfect, and
altogether unstained; Kingdom is the assignment of every limit and
order, and ordinance and rank; and Lordship is not only the superiority
over the worse, but also the perfect possession, in. every respect, of
the Beautiful and Good; and a true and unswerving stability. Wherefore
Lordship is parallel to <span id="ii.ii.ii.xii-p5.1"></span>τὸ Κῦρος καί
κύριον, καὶ τὸ κυριστῶν <span id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55) ; and Deity
is the Providence watching over all, and with perfect goodness both
circumscribing and grasping all, and filling with Itself, and surpassing
all things which enjoy Its forethought.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.xii-p6"></span>SECTION III.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.xii-p7"></span>These things, then, must be sung
absolutely, respecting the Cause surpassing all, and we must add that It
surpasses Holiness, and Lordship, and Kingdom, and most simplex <span
id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56) Deity. For, from It, <span
id="page_121">p. 121</span> <span
id="ii.ii.ii.xii-Page_121"></span>individually and collectively, were
born and distributed every untarnished distinctness of every spotless
purity, the whole arrangement and regulation of things existing, whilst
It excludes want of harmony and want of equality, and want of symmetry,
and rejoices over the well-ordered identity and rectitude, and leads
round things, deemed worthy to participate in Itself. From It is all the
perfect and complete possession of all. good things, every good
forethought, watching and sustaining the objects of Its forethought,
imparting Itself, as befits Its goodness, for deification of those who
are turned to It.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.xii-p8"></span>SECTION IV.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.xii-p9"></span>But since the Cause of all is
super-full of all, as beseems the One superfluity which surpasses all,
He is sung as *Holy of Holies* and the rest, as beseems an overflowing
Cause, and a towering Pre-eminence. As one might say, so far as the
things which are,--holy or divine, or lordly, or kingly,--surpass the
things which are not, and the self-existent participations, their
participants; to such an extent is seated above all things that be, He
Who is above all things that be, and the unparticipating Cause of all
the participants and the participations. But Holy and Kings and Lords
and Gods, the Oracles call the higher orders in each, through whom the
inferior in participating the gifts from God, multiply the simplicity of
their distribution around their own diversities, the variety of which,
the superior <span id="page_122">p. 122</span> <span
id="ii.ii.ii.xii-Page_122"></span> orders carefully and divinely collect
to their own Oneness.
