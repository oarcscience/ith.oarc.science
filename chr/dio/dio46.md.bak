### <span id="iv.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>CAPUT III.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p1"></span>What is Hierarchy? and what the use of
Hierarchy?

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p2"></span>Section I.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p3"></span>Hierarchy is, in my judgment, a sacred
order and science and operation, assimilated, as far as attainable, to
the likeness of God, and conducted to the illuminations granted to it
from God, according to capacity, with a view to the Divine imitation.
Now the God-becoming Beauty, as simple, as good, as source of
initiation, is altogether free from any dissimilarity, and imparts its
own proper light to each according to their fitness, and perfects in
most Divine initiation, as becomes the undeviating moulding of those who
are being initiated harmoniously to itself. <span id="page_14">p.
14</span> <span id="iv.ii.iii-Page_14"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p4"></span>Section II.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p5"></span>The purpose, then, of Hierarchy is the
assimilation and union, as far as attainable, with God, having Him
Leader of all religious science and operation, by looking unflinchingly
to His most Divine comeliness, and copying, as far as possible, and by
perfecting its own followers as Divine images, mirrors most luminous and
without flaw, receptive of the primal light and the supremely Divine
ray, and devoutly filled with the entrusted radiance, and again,
spreading this radiance ungrudgingly to those after it, in accordance
with the supremely Divine regulations. For it is not lawful for the
Mystic Rites of sacred things, or for things religiously done, to
practise anything whatever beyond the sacred regulations of their own
proper function. Nor even must they attempt otherwise, if they desire to
attain its deifying splendour, and look to it religiously, and are
moulded after the example of each of the holy minds. He, then, who
mentions Hierarchy, denotes a certain altogether Holy Order, an image of
the supremely Divine freshness, ministering the mysteries of its own
illumination in hierarchical ranks, and sciences, and assimilated to its
own proper Head as far as lawful.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p6"></span>For each of those who have been called
into the Hierarchy, find their perfection in being carried to the Divine
imitation <span id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) in their own proper
degree; and, what is more Divine than all, in becoming a <span
id="page_15">p. 15</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iii-Page_15"></span>fellow-worker <span
id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md) with God, as the Oracles say, and in
shewing the Divine energy in himself manifested as far as possible. For
it is an Hierarchical regulation that some are purified and that others
purify <span id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md) ; that some are
enlightened and others enlighten <span id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md)
; that some are perfected and others perfect; the Divine imitation will
fit each one in this fashion. The Divine blessedness, to speak after the
manner of men, is indeed unstained by any dissimilarity <span
id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) , and is full of invisible light <span
id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md) --perfect <span
id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md) , and needing no perfection;
cleansing, illuminating, and perfecting, yea, rather a holy
purification, and illumination, and perfection--above purification,
above light, preeminently perfect, self-perfect source and cause of
every Hierarchy, and elevated pre-eminently above every holy thing.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p7"></span>Section III.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p8"></span>It is necessary then, as I think, that
those who are being purified should be entirely perfected, without
stain, and be freed from all dissimilar confusion; that those who are
being illuminated should be filled with the Divine Light, conducted to
the habit and faculty of contemplation in all purity of mind; that those
who are being initiated should be separated from the imperfect, and
become recipients of that perfecting science of the sacred things
contemplated. Further, that those who purify should impart, from their
own abundance of purity, their own proper holiness; that those who
illuminate, as being more <span id="page_16">p. 16</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iii-Page_16"></span>luminous intelligences, whose function it
is to- receive and to impart light, and who are joyfully filled with
holy gladness, that these should overflow, in proportion to their own
overflowing light, towards those who are worthy of enlightenment; and
that those who make perfect, as being skilled in the impartation of
perfection, should perfect those being perfected, through the holy
instruction, in the science of the holy things contemplated. Thus each
rank of the Hierarchical Order is led, in its own degree, to the Divine
co-operation, by performing, through grace and God-given power, those
things which are naturally and supernaturally in the Godhead, and
accomplished by It superessentially, and manifested hierarchically, for
the attainable imitation of the God-loving Minds <span
