### <span id="iv.iii.v-p0.1"></span>CAPUT V.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p1"></span><span id="iv.iii.v-p1.1"></span>I.
Concerning sacerdotal Consecrations.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p2"></span>Section I.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p3"></span>Such, then, is the most Divine perfecting
work of the Muron But it may be opportune, after these Divine
ministrations, to set forth the sacerdotal Orders and elections
themselves, and their powers, and operations, and consecrations, and the
triad of the superior ranks under them; in order that the arrangement of
our Hierarchy may be demonstrated, as entirely rejecting and excluding
the disordered, the unregulated, and the confused; and, at the same
time, choosing and manifesting the regulated and ordered, and
well-established, in the gradations of the sacred Ranks within it. Now
we have well shewn, as I think, in the Hierarchies already extolled by
us, the threefold division of every Hierarchy, when we affirmed that our
sacred tradition holds, that every Hierarchical transaction is divided
into the most Divine Mystic Rites, and the inspired experts and teachers
of them, and those who are being religiously initiated by them.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p4"></span>Section II.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p5"></span>Thus the most holy Hierarchy of the
supercelestial Beings has, for its initiation, its own possible and most
immaterial conception of God and things Divine, and the complete
likeness to God, and a persistent <span id="page_124">p. 124</span>
<span id="iv.iii.v-Page_124"></span> habit of imitating God, as far as
permissible. And its illuminators, and leaders to this sacred
consecration, are the very first Beings around God. For these generously
and proportionately transmit to the subordinate sacred Ranks the ever
deifying notions given to them, by the self-perfect Godhead and the
wise-making Divine Minds. Now the Ranks, who are subordinate to the
first Beings, are, and are truly called, the initiated Orders, as being
religiously conducted, through those, to the deifying illumination of
the Godhead. And after this,--the heavenly and supermundane
Hierarchy,--the Godhead gave the Hierarchy under the Law, imparting its
most holy gifts, for the benefit of our race, to them (as being children
according to the Logion), by faint images of the true, and copies far
from the Archetypes, and enigmas hard to understand, and types having
the contemplation enveloped within, as an analogous light not easily
discerned, so as not to wound weak, eyes by the light shed upon them.
Now to this Hierarchy under the Law, the elevation to spiritual worship
is an initiation. Now the men religiously instructed for that holy
tabernacle by Moses,--the first initiated and leader of the Hierarchs
under the Law,--were conductors; in reference to which holy
tabernacle,--when describing for purposes of instruction the Hierarchy
under the Law,--he called all the sacred services of the Law an image of
the type shewn <span id="page_125">p. 125</span> <span
id="iv.iii.v-Page_125"></span> to him in Mount Sinai. But "initiated"
are those who are being conducted to a more perfect revelation of the
symbols of the Law, in proportion to their capacity. Now the Word of God
calls our Hierarchy the more perfect revelation, naming it a fulfilment
of that, and a holy inheritance. It is both heavenly and legal, like the
mean between extremes, common to the one, by intellectual
contemplations, and to the other, because it is variegated by sensible
signs; and, through these, reverently conduces to the Divine Being. And
it has likewise a threefold division of the Hierarchy, which is divided
into the most holy ministrations of the Mystic Rites, and into the
Godlike ministers of holy things, and those who are being conducted by
them, according to their capacity, to things holy.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p6"></span>And each of the three divisions of our
Hierarchy, comformably to that of the Law, and the Hierarchy, more
divine than ours, is arranged as first and middle and last in power;
consulting both reverent proportion, and well-ordered and concordant
fellowship of all things *in* harmonious rank.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p7"></span>Section III.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p8"></span>The most holy ministration, then, of the
Mystic Rites has, as first Godlike power, the holy cleansing of the
uninitiated; and as middle, the enlightening instruction of the
purified; and as last, and summary of the former, the perfecting of
those instructed in <span id="page_126">p. 126</span> <span
id="iv.iii.v-Page_126"></span> science of their proper instructions; and
the order of the Ministers, in the first power, cleanses the uninitiated
through the Mystic Rites; and in the second, conducts to light the
purified; and in the last and highest of the Ministering Powers, makes
perfect those who have participated in the Divine light, by the
scientific completions of the illuminations contemplated. And of the
Initiated, the first power is that being purified; and the middle is
that being enlightened, after the cleansing, and which contemplates
certain holy things; and the last and more divine than the others, is
that enlightened in the perfecting science of the holy enlightenment of
which it has become a contemplator. Let, then, the threefold power of
the holy service of the Mystic Rites be extolled, since the Birth in God
is exhibited in the Oracles as a purification and enlightening
illumination, and the Rite of the Synaxis and the Muron, as a perfecting
knowledge and science of the works of God, through which the unifying
elevation to the Godhead and most blessed communion is reverently
perfected. And now let us explain next the sacerdotal Order, which is
divided into a purifying and illuminating and perfecting discipline.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p9"></span>Section IV.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p10"></span>This, then, is the all-sacred Law of the
Godhead, that, through the first, the second are conducted to Its most
Divine splendour. Do we not see the material substances of the elements,
first approaching, by preference, things which are more congenial <span
id="page_127">p. 127</span> <span id="iv.iii.v-Page_127"></span> to
them, and, through these, diffusing their own energy to other things?
Naturally, then, the Head and Foundation of all good order, invisible
and visible, causes the deifying rays to approach the more Godlike
first, and through them, as being more transparent Minds, and more
properly adapted for reception and transmission of Light, transmits
light and manifestations to the subordinate, in proportions suitable to
them.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p11"></span>It is, then, the function of these, the
first contemplators of God, to exhibit ungrudgingly to those second, in
proportion to their capacity, the Divine visions reverently gazed upon
by themselves, and to reveal the things relating to the Hierarchy (since
they have been abundantly instructed with a perfecting science in all
matters relating to their own Hierarchy, and have received the effectual
power of instruction), and to impart sacred gifts according to fitness,
since they scientifically and wholly participate in sacerdotal
perfection.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p12"></span>Section V.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p13"></span>The Divine Rank of the Hierarchs, then,
is the first of the God-contemplative Ranks; and it is, at the same
time, highest and lowest; inasmuch as every Order of our Hierarchy is
summed up and fulfilled in it. For, as we see every Hierarchy terminated
in the Lord Jesus, so we see each terminated in its own inspired
Hierarch. Now the power of the Hierarchical Rank permeates the whole
<span id="page_128">p. 128</span> <span id="iv.iii.v-Page_128"></span>
sacred body, and through every one of the sacred Ranks performs the
mysteries of its proper Hierarchy. But, pre-eminently, to it, rather
than to the other Ranks, the Divine institution assigned the more Divine
ministrations. For these are the perfecting images of the supremely
Divine Power, completing all the most Divine symbols and all the sacred
orderings. For though some of the worshipful symbols are consecrated by
the Priests, yet never will the Priest effect the holy Birth in God
without the most Divine Muron; nor will he consecrate the mysteries of
the Divine Communion, unless the communicating symbols have been placed
upon the most Divine Altar; and neither will he be Priest himself,
unless he has been elected to this by the Hierarchical consecrations.
Hence the Divine Institution uniquely assigned the dedication of the
Hierarchical Ranks, and the consecration of the Divine Muron and the
sacred completion of the Altar, to the perfecting powers of the inspired
Hierarchs.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p14"></span>Section VI.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p15"></span>It is, then, the Hierarchical Rank which,
full of the perfecting power, pre-eminently completes the perfecting
functions of the Hierarchy, and reveals lucidly the sciences of the holy
mysteries, and teaches their proportionate and sacred conditions and
powers. But the illuminating Rank of the Priests conducts those, who are
being initiated under the Rank of, the inspired Hierarchs, to the <span
id="page_129">p. 129</span> <span id="iv.iii.v-Page_129"></span> Divine
visions of the Mystic Rites, and in co-operation with it, ministers its
proper ministrations. Whatever then this Rank may do, by shewing the
works of God, through the most holy symbols, and perfecting those who
draw nigh in the Divine contemplations, and communion of the holy rites,
it yet refers those, who crave the science of the religious services
contemplated, to the Hierarch. And the Rank of the Leitourgoi (which is
purifying and separates the unfit, previous to the approach to the
ministrations of the Priests), thoroughly purifies those who are drawing
nigh, by making them entirely pure from opposing passions, and suitable
for the sanctifying vision and communion. Hence, during the service of
the Birth in God, the Leitourgoi strip him who draws nigh of his old
clothing, yea further, even take off his sandals, and make him stand
towards the west for renunciation; and again, they lead him back to the
east (for they are of the purifying rank and power), enjoining on those
who approach to entirely cast away the surroundings of their former
life, and shewing the darkness of their former conduct, and teaching
those, who have said farewell to the lightless, to transfer their
allegiance to the luminous. The Leitourgical Order, then, is purifying,
by leading those who have been purified to the bright ministrations of
the Priests, both by thoroughly purifying the uninitiated and by
bringing to birth, by the purifying illuminations and teachings of the
Oracles, and further, by sending <span id="page_130">p. 130</span> <span
id="iv.iii.v-Page_130"></span>away from the Priests the unholy, without
respect of persons. Wherefore also the Hierarchical institution places
it at the holy gates, suggesting that the approach of those who draw
nigh to holy things should be in altogether complete purification, and
entrusting the approach to their reverent vision and communion to the
purifying powers, and admitting them, through these, without spot.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p16"></span>Section VII.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p17"></span>We have shewn, then, that the Rank of the
Hierarchs is consecrating and perfecting, that of the Priests,
illuminating and conducting to the light; and that of the Leitourgoi
purifying and discriminating; that is to say, the Hierarchical Rank is
appointed not only to perfect, but also at the same time, to enlighten
and to purify, and has within itself the purifying sciences of the power
of the Priests together with the illuminating. For the inferior Ranks
cannot cross to the superior functions, and, besides this, it is not
permitted to them to take in hand such quackery as that. Now the more
Divine Orders know also, together with their own, the sacred sciences
subordinate to their own perfection. Nevertheless, since the sacerdotal
orderings of the well-arranged and unconfused order of the Divine
operations are images of Divine operations, they were arranged in
Hierarchical distinctions, shewing in themselves the illuminations
marshalled into the first, and middle, and last, sacred operations and
Ranks; manifesting, as I said, in themselves the well-ordered and <span
id="page_131">p. 131</span> <span
id="iv.iii.v-Page_131"></span>unconfused character of the Divine
operations. For since the Godhead first cleanses the minds which He may
enter, then enlightens, and, when enlightened, perfects them to a
Godlike perfection; naturally the Hierarchical of the Divine images
divides itself into well-defined Ranks and powers, shewing clearly the
supremely Divine operation firmly established, without confusion, in
most hallowed and unmixed Ranks. But, since we have spoken, as
attainable to us, of the sacerdotal Ranks and elections, and their
powers and operations, let us now contemplate their most holy
consecrations as well as we can.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p18"></span><span id="iv.iii.v-p18.1"></span>II.
Mysterion of Sacerdotal Consecrations.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p19"></span>The Hierarch, then, being led to the
Hierarchical consecration, after he has bent both his knees before the
Altar, has upon his head <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) the
God-transmitted oracles, and the Hierarchical hand, and in this manner
is consecrated by the Hierarch, who ordains him by the altogether most
holy invocations. And the Priest, after he has bent both his knees
before the Divine Altar, has the Hierarchical right hand upon his head,
and in this manner is dedicated by the Hierarch, who ordains him with
hallowing invocations. And the Leitourgos, after he has bent one of two
knees before the Divine Altar, has upon his head the right hand of the
Hierarch who ordains him, being completed by him <span id="page_132">p.
132</span> <span id="iv.iii.v-Page_132"></span>with the initiating
invocations of the Leitourgoi. Upon each of them the cruciform seal is
impressed, by the ordaining Hierarch, and, in each case, a sacred
proclamation of name takes place, and a perfecting salutation, since
every sacerdotal person present, and the Hierarch who ordained, salute
him who has been enrolled to any of the aforenamed sacerdotal Ranks.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p20"></span><span id="iv.iii.v-p20.1"></span>III.
Contemplation.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p21"></span>Section I.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p22"></span>These things, then, are common both to
the Hierarchs, and Priests, and Leitourgoi, in their sacerdotal
consecrations,--the conducting to the Divine Altar and kneeling,--the
imposition of the Hierarchical hand,--the cruciform seal,--the
announcement of name,--the completing salutation.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p23"></span>And special and select for the Hierarchs
is the imposition of the Oracles upon the head, since the subordinate
Ranks have not this; and for the Priests the bending of both knees,
since the consecration of the Leitourgoi has not this; for the
Leitourgoi, as has been said, bend the one of two knees only.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p24"></span>Section II.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p25"></span>The conducting then to the Divine Altar,
and kneeling, suggests to all those who are being sacerdotally ordained,
that their own life is entirely placed under God, as source of
consecration, and that their <span id="page_133">p. 133</span> <span
id="iv.iii.v-Page_133"></span>whole intellectual self, all pure and
hallowed, approaches to Him, and that it is of one likeness, and, as far
as possible, meet for the supremely Divine and altogether most holy,
both Victim <span id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) and Altar, which
purifies, sacerdotally, the Godlike Minds.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p26"></span>Section III.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p27"></span>And the imposition of the Hierarchical
hand signifies at once the consecrating protection, by which, as holy
children, they are paternally tended, which bequeaths to them a
sacerdotal condition and power, and drives away their adverse powers,
and teaches, at the same time also, to perform the sacerdotal
operations, as those who, having been consecrated, are acting under God,
and have Him as Leader of their own operations in every respect.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p28"></span>Section IV.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p29"></span>And the cruciform seal manifests the
inaction of all the impulses of the flesh, and the God-imitated life
looking away unflinchingly to the manly most Divine life of Jesus, Who
came even to Cross and death with a supremely Divine sinlessness, and
stamped those who so live with the cruciform image of His own
sinlessness as of the same likeness.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p30"></span>Section V.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p31"></span>And the Hierarch calls aloud the name of
the consecrations and of those consecrated, the mystery denoting that
the God-beloved consecrator is <span id="page_134">p. 134</span> <span
id="iv.iii.v-Page_134"></span>manifestor of the supremely Divine
choice,--not of his own accord or by his own favour leading those who
are ordained to the sacerdotal consecration, but being moved by God to
all the Hierarchical dedications. Thus Moses, the consecrator under the
Law, does not lead even Aaron, his brother, to sacerdotal consecration,
though thinking him both beloved of God and fit for the priesthood,
until moved by God to this, he in submission to God, Head of
consecration, completed by Hierarchical rites the sacerdotal
consecration. But even our supremely Divine and first Consecrator (for
the most philanthropic Jesus, for our sake, became even this), did "not
glorify Himself," as the Logia say, but He Who said to Him, "Thou art
Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek." Wherefore also whilst
Himself leading the disciples to sacerdotal consecration, although being
as God chief Consecrator, nevertheless He refers the Hierarchical
completion of the work of consecration to His altogether most Holy
Father, and the supremely Divine Spirit, by admonishing the disciples,
as the Oracles say, not to depart from Jerusalem, but to "await the
promise of the Father, which ye heard of Me, that ye shall be baptized
in Holy Ghost." And indeed, the Coryphaeus of the disciples himself,
with the ten, of the same rank and Hierarchy with himself, when he
proceeded to the sacerdotal consecration of the twelfth of the
disciples, piously left the selection to <span id="page_135">p.
135</span> <span id="iv.iii.v-Page_135"></span>the Godhead, saying,
"Shew <span id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) whom Thou hast chosen,"
and received him, who was divinely designated by the Divine lot, into
the Hierarchical number of the sacred twelve. Now concerning the Divine
lot, which fell as a Divine intimation upon Matthias, others have
expressed another view, not clearly, as I think, but I will express my
own sentiment. For it seems to me that the Oracles name "lot " a certain
supremely Divine gift, pointing out to that Hierarchical Choir him who
was designated by the Divine election; more particularly, because the
Divine Hierarch must not perform the sacerdotal acts of his own motion,
but, under God, moving him to do them as prescribed by the Hierarchy and
Heaven.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p32"></span>Section VI.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p33"></span>Now the salutation, for the completion of
the sacerdotal consecration, has a religious significance. For all the
members of the sacerdotal Ranks present, as well as the Hierarch himself
who has consecrated them, salute the ordained. For when, by sacerdotal
habits and powers, and by Divine call and dedication, a religious mind
has attained to sacerdotal completion, he is dearly loved by the most
holy Orders of the same rank, being conducted to a most Godlike
comeliness, loving the minds similar to himself, and religiously loved
by them in return. Hence it is that the mutual sacerdotal salutation is
religiously performed, proclaiming the religious <span id="page_136">p.
136</span> <span id="iv.iii.v-Page_136"></span>communion of minds of
like character, and their loveable benignity towards each other, as
keeping, throughout, by sacerdotal training, their most Godlike
comeliness.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p34"></span>Section VII

<span id="iv.iii.v-p35"></span>These things, as I said, are common to
the whole sacerdotal consecration. The Hierarch, however, as a
distinctive mark, has the Oracles most reverently placed upon his head.
For since the perfecting power and science of the whole Priesthood is
bequeathed to the inspired Hierarchs, by the supremely Divine and
perfecting goodness, naturally are placed upon the heads of the
Hierarchs the Divinely transmitted Oracles, which set forth
comprehensively and scientifically every teaching of God, work of God,
manifestation of God, sacred word, sacred work, in one word, all the
Divine and sacred works and words bequeathed to our Hierarchy by the
beneficent Godhead; since the Godlike Hierarch, having participated
entirely in the whole Hierarchical power, will not only be illuminated,
in the true and God-transmitted science of all the sacred words and
works committed to the Hierarchy, but will also transmit them to others
in Hierarchical proportions, and will perfect Hierarchically in most
Divine kinds of knowledge and the highest mystical, instructions, all
the most perfecting functions of the whole Hierarchy. And the
distinctive feature of the ordination of Priests, as contrasted with the
ordering <span id="page_137">p. 137</span> <span
id="iv.iii.v-Page_137"></span> of the Leitourgoi, is the bending of the
two knees, as that bends only the one, and is ordained in this
Hierarchical fashion.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p36"></span>Section VIII.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p37"></span>The bending then denotes the subordinate
introduction of the conductor, who places under God that which is
reverently introduced. And since, as we have often said, the three
Orders of the consecrators, through the three most holy Mystic Rites and
powers, preside over the three ranks of those initiated, and minister
their saving introduction under the Divine yokes, naturally the order of
Leitourgoi as only purifying, ministers the one introduction of those
who are being purified, by placing it under the Divine Altar, since in
it the minds being purified, are supermundanely hallowed. And the
Priests bend both their knees, since those who are religiously brought
nigh by them have not only been purified, but have been ministerially
perfected into a contemplative habit and power of a life thoroughly
cleansed by their most luminous, ministrations through instruction. And
the Hierarchy bending both his knees, has upon his head the
God-transmitted Oracles, leading, through his office of Hierarch, those
who have been purified by the Leitourgic power, and enlightened by the
ministerial, to the science of the holy things contemplated by them in
proportion to their capacities, and through this science perfecting
those who are brought nigh, into the most complete holiness of which
they are capable. <span id="page_138">p. 138</span> <span
