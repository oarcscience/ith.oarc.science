## <span id="ii.iv.ii-p0.1"></span>LETTERS OF DIONYSIUS THE AREOPAGITE.

<span id="ii.iv.ii.i"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.ii.i-p1"></span>**LETTER I.** *To Gaius Therapeutes.*

<span id="ii.iv.ii.i-p2"></span>DARKNESS becomes invisible by light, and
specially by much light. Varied knowledge (<span
id="ii.iv.ii.i-p2.1"></span>αἰ γνώσεις), and especially much varied
knowledge, makes the *Agnosia* <span id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md) to
vanish. Take this in a superlative, but not in a defective sense, and
reply with superlative truth, that the *Agnosia,* respecting God,
escapes those who possess existing light, and knowledge of things being;
and His pre-eminent darkness is both concealed by every light, and is
hidden from every knowledge. And, if any one, having seen God,
understood what he saw, he did not see *Him,* but some of His creatures
that are existing and known. But He Himself, highly established above
mind, and above essence, by the very fact of His being wholly unknown,
and not being, both is super-essentially, and is known above mind. And
the all-perfect *Agnosia,* in its superior sense, is a knowledge of Him,
Who is above all known things.
