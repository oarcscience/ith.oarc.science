### <span id="iv.ii.v-p0.1"></span>CAPUT V.

<span id="iv.ii.v-p1"></span>For what reason all the Heavenly Beings are
called, in common, Angels.

<span id="iv.ii.v-p2"></span>This, then, in our judgment, is the reason
for the appellation Angelic in the Oracles. We must now, I suppose,
enquire for what reason the theologians call all the Heavenly Beings
together "Angels;" but when they come to a more accurate <span
id="page_22">p. 22</span> <span id="iv.ii.v-Page_22"></span> description
of the supermundane orders, they name exclusively, "angelic rank," that
which completes the full tale of the Divine and Heavenly Hosts. Before
this, however, they range pre-eminently, the Orders of Archangels, and
the Principalities, the Authorities, and Powers, and as many Beings as
the revealing traditions of the Oracles recognize as superior to them.
Now, we affirm that throughout every sacred ordinance the superior ranks
possess the illuminations and powers of their subordinates, but the
lowest have not the same powers as those who are above them. The
theologians also call the most holy ranks of the highest Beings
"Angels," for they "also make known the supremely Divine illumination.
But there is no reason to call the lowest rank of the celestial Minds,
Principalities, or Thrones, or Seraphim. For it does not possess the
highest powers, but, as it conducts our inspired Hierarchs to the
splendours of the Godhead known to it; so also, the saintly powers of
the Beings above it are conductors, towards the Divine Being, of that
Order which completes the Angelic Hierarchies. Except perhaps some one
might say this also, that all the angelic appellations are common, as
regards the subordinate and superior communication of all the celestial
powers towards the Divine likeness, and the gift of light from God. But,
in order that the question may be better investigated, let us reverently
examine the saintly characteristics set forth respecting each celestial
Order in the Oracles. <span id="page_23">p. 23</span> <span
