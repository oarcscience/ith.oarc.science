## <span id="ii.iii.i-p0.1"></span>PREFACE TO MYSTIC THEOLOGY.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p1"></span>MYSTIC THEOLOGY is like that ladder set up
on the earth whose top reached to Heaven on which the angels of God were
ascending and descending, and above which stood Almighty God. The Angel
ascending is the "negative" which distinguishes Almighty God from all
created things. God is not matter--soul, mind, spirit, any being, nor
even being itself, but above and beyond all these. The Angel descending
is the "Affirmative." God is good, wise, powerful, the Being, until we
come to *Symbolic Theology,* which denotes Him under material forms and
conditions: Theology prefers the negative because Almighty God is more
appropriately presented by distinction than by comparison.
