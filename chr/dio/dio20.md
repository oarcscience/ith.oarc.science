### <span id="ii.iii.ii.ii-p0.1"></span>CAPUT II.

<span id="ii.iii.ii.ii-p1"></span>How we ought both to be united and
render praise to the Cause of all and above all.

<span id="ii.iii.ii.ii-p2"></span>SECTION I.

<span id="ii.iii.ii.ii-p3"></span>WE pray to enter within the
super-bright gloom, and through not seeing and not knowing, to see and
to know that the not to see nor to know is itself the above sight and
knowledge. For this is veritably to see and to know and to celebrate
super-essentially the Superessential, through the abstraction of all
existing things, just as those who make a lifelike statue, by extracting
all the encumbrances which have been placed upon the clear view of the
concealed, and by bringing to light, by the mere cutting away <span
id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59) , the genuine beauty concealed in it.
And, it is necessary, as I think, to celebrate the abstractions in an
opposite way to the definitions. For, we used to place these latter by
beginning from the foremost and descending through the middle to the
lowest, but, in this case, by making the ascents from the lowest to the
highest, we abstract everything, in order that, without veil, we may
know that *Agnosia,* which is enshrouded under all the known, in all
things that be, and may see that superessential gloom, which is hidden
by all the light in existing things.
