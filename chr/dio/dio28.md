<span id="ii.iv.ii.iv-p1"></span>**LETTER IV.** <span
id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md) *To the same Gaius Therapeutes.*

<span id="ii.iv.ii.iv-p2"></span>How, you ask, is Jesus, Who is beyond
all, ranked essentially with all men? For, not as Author of men is He
here called man, but as being in absolute whole essence truly man. But
we do not define the Lord Jesus, humanly, for He is not man only,
(neither superessential nor man only), but truly man, He Who is
pre-eminently a lover of man, the Super-essential, taking substance,
above men and after men, from the substance of men. And it is nothing
less, the ever Superessential, super-full of super-essentiality,
disregards the excess <span id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md) of this, and
having come truly into substance, took substance above substance, and
above man works things of man. And a virgin supernaturally conceiving,
and unstable water, holding up weight of material and earthly feet, and
not giving way, but, by a supernatural power standing together so as not
to be divided, demonstrate this. Why should any one go through the rest,
which are very many? Through which, he who looks with a divine vision,
will know beyond mind, even the things affirmed respecting the love
towards man, of (the Lord) Jesus,--things which possess a force of
superlative negation. For, even, to speak summarily, He was not man, not
as not being man, but as being from men was beyond men, and was above
man, having truly been born man, and for the rest, not having done
things Divine <span id="page_144">p. 144</span> <span
id="ii.iv.ii.iv-Page_144"></span> as God, nor things human as man, but
exercising for us a certain new God-incarnate energy of God having
become man.
