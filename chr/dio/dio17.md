### <span id="ii.ii.ii.xiv-p0.1"></span>NOTE.

#### <span id="ii.ii.ii.xiv-p0.2"></span>IGNATIUS.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.xiv-p1"></span>" MY love is crucified."

<span id="ii.ii.ii.xiv-p2"></span>Upon this passage I differ from all
the commentators that I know. I believe the passage to have been written
and inserted in the text by Dionysius when writing this letter, which
must have been before A.D. 98. I do not think it a quotation from the
letter of Ignatius written just previous to his martyrdom. I think
Dionysius quoted some previous writing of Ignatius, in which he spoke of
our Saviour as "My Love, Which is mine." That is the sense in this
passage, to shew the exalted use of Love. In the letter of Ignatius to
the Romans, he seems to use "love" in the sense of human passion or
fire, and says that that is crucified in him. In any case, there is no
chronological difficulty. Ignatius was martyred A.D. 107, Dionysius,
A.D. 119.
