### <span id="iv.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>CAPUT XI.

<span id="iv.ii.xi-p1"></span>For what reason all the Heavenly Beings,
in common, are called Heavenly Powers.

<span id="iv.ii.xi-p2"></span>Section I.

<span id="iv.ii.xi-p3"></span>Now that we have defined these things, it
is worthy of consideration for what reason we are accustomed to call all
the Angelic Beings together, <span id="page_43">p. 43</span> <span
id="iv.ii.xi-Page_43"></span> Heavenly Powers. For it is not possible to
say, as we may of the Angels, that the Order of the holy Powers is last
of all. The Orders of the superior Beings share in the saintly
illumination. of the last; but the last in no wise of the first; and on
this account all the Divine Minds are called Heavenly Powers, but never
Seraphim and Thrones and Lordships. For the last do not enjoy the whole
characteristics of the highest. For the Angels, and those above the
Angels--Archangels, and Principalities, and Authorities,--placed by the
Word of God after the Powers, are often in common called by us, in
conjunction with the other holy Beings, Heavenly Powers.

<span id="iv.ii.xi-p4"></span>Section II.

<span id="iv.ii.xi-p5"></span>But we affirm that, whilst often using the
appellation, Heavenly Powers, for all in common, we do not introduce a
sort of. confusion of the characteristics of each Order. But, inasmuch
as all the Divine Minds, by the supermundane description given of them,
are distributed into three,--into essence, and power, and energy,--when
we speak of them all, or some of them, indiscriminately, as Heavenly
Beings or Heavenly Powers, we must consider that we manifest those about
whom we speak in a general way, from their essence or power severally.
For we must not apply the superior characteristic of those holy Powers,
whom we have already sufficiently distinguished, to the Beings which are
entirely inferior to them, so as to overthrow the unconfused order of
the Angelic ranks. For <span id="page_44">p. 44</span> <span
id="iv.ii.xi-Page_44"></span> according to the correct account which we
have already frequently given, the superior Orders possess abundantly
the sacred characteristics of the inferior, but the lowest do not
possess the superior completeness of the more reverend, since the
first-manifested illuminations are revealed to them, through the first
Order, in proportion to their capacity.
