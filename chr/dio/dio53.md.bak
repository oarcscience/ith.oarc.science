### <span id="iv.ii.x-p0.1"></span>CAPUT X.

<span id="iv.ii.x-p1"></span>A Repetition and Summary of the Angelic
discipline.

<span id="iv.ii.x-p2"></span>Section I.

<span id="iv.ii.x-p3"></span>We have concluded, then, that the most
reverend Order of the Minds around God, ministered by the perfecting
illumination through its immediate elevation to it, is purified, and
illuminated, and perfected by a gift of light from the Godhead, more
hidden and more manifest--more hidden, indeed, as being more
intelligible, and more simplifying, and more unifying; more manifest, as
being a first gift and a first manifestation, and more complete, and
more affused to it as transparent. And from this (Order) again, in due
degree, the second, and from the second, the third, and from the third,
our Hierarchy, is reverently conducted to the super-original Origin and
End of all good order, according to the self-same law of well-ordered
regularity, in Divine harmony and proportion.

<span id="iv.ii.x-p4"></span>Section II.

<span id="iv.ii.x-p5"></span>Now all Angels are interpreters of those
above them, the most reverend, indeed, of God, Who moves them, and the
rest, in due degree, of those who have been moved by God. For, to such
an extent has the superessential harmony of all things provided for the
religious order and the regulated conduct of each of the rational and
intellectual beings, that each rank of the Hierarchies, has been placed
in sacred order, and we observe <span id="page_42">p. 42</span> <span
id="iv.ii.x-Page_42"></span>every Hierarchy distributed into first, and
middle, and last Powers. But to speak accurately, He distinguished each
Division itself, by the same Divine harmonies; wherefore the theologians
say that the most Divine Seraphim cry one to another, indicating
distinctly, as I think by this, that the first impart their knowledge of
divine things to the second.

<span id="iv.ii.x-p6"></span>Section III.

<span id="iv.ii.x-p7"></span>I might add this not inappropriately, that
each heavenly and human mind has within itself its own special first,
and middle, and last ranks, and powers, manifested severally in due
degree, for the aforesaid particular mystical meanings of the
Hierarchical illuminations, according to which, each one participates-,
so far as is lawful and attainable to him, in the most spotless
purification, the most copious light, the pre-eminent perfection. For
there is nothing that is self-perfect, or absolutely without need of
perfecting, except the really Self-perfect and preeminently Perfect.
