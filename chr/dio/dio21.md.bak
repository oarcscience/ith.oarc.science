### <span id="ii.iii.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>CAPUT III.

<span id="ii.iii.ii.iii-p1"></span>What are the affirmative expressions
respecting God, and what the negative.

<span id="ii.iii.ii.iii-p2"></span>SECTION I.

<span id="ii.iii.ii.iii-p3"></span>IN the *Theological Outlines,* then,
we celebrated the principal affirmative expressions respecting God--how
the Divine and good Nature is spoken of as One--how as Threefold--what
is that within it which is spoken of as Paternity and Sonship--what the
Divine name of "the Spirit "is meant to signify,--how from the
immaterial and indivisible Good the Lights dwelling in the heart of
Goodness sprang forth, and remained, in their branching forth, without
departing from the coeternal abiding in Himself and in Themselves and in
each other,--how the super-essential Jesus takes substance in veritable
human nature--and whatever other things, made known by the Oracles, are
celebrated throughout the *Theological Outlines;* and in the treatise
concerning *Divine Names,* how He is named Good--how Being--how Life and
Wisdom and Power--and whatever else belongs to the nomenclature of God.
Further, in the *Symbolical Theology,* what are the Names transferred
from objects of sense to things Divine?--what are the Divine
forms?--what the Divine appearances, and parts and organs?--what the
Divine places and ornaments?--what the angers?--what the griefs?--and
the Divine wrath?--what the carousals, and the ensuing sicknesses?--what
the oaths,--and what the <span id="page_135">p. 135</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii.iii-Page_135"></span> curses?--what the sleepings, and
what the awakings?--and all the other Divinely formed representations,
which belong to the description of God, through symbols. And I imagine
that you have comprehended, how the lowest are expressed in somewhat
more words than the first. For, it was necessary that the *Theological
Outlines,* and the unfolding of the Divine Names should be expressed in
fewer words than the *Symbolic Theology;* since, in proportion as we
ascend to the higher, in such a degree the expressions are circumscribed
by the contemplations of the things intelligible. As even now, when
entering into the gloom which is above mind, we shall find, not a little
speaking, but a complete absence of speech, and absence of conception.
In the other case, the discourse, in descending from the above to the
lowest, is widened according to the descent, to a proportionate extent;
but now, in ascending from below to that which is above, in proportion
to the ascent, it is contracted, and after a complete ascent, it will
become wholly voiceless, and will be wholly united to the unutterable.
But, for what reason in short, you say, having attributed the Divine
attributes from the foremost, do we begin the Divine abstraction from
things lowest? Because it is necessary that they who place attributes on
that which is above every attribute, should place the attributive
affirmation from that which is more cognate to it; but that they who
abstract, with regard to that which is above every abstraction, should
make the abstraction from things which are further removed from it. Are
not <span id="page_136">p. 136</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii.iii-Page_136"></span>life and goodness more (cognate) than
air and stone? and He is not given to debauch and to wrath, more
(removed) than He is not expressed nor conceived.
