### <span id="iv.ii.ii-p0.1"></span>CAPUT II.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p1"></span>That Divine and Heavenly things are
appropriately revealed, even through dissimilar symbols.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p2"></span>Section I.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p3"></span>It is necessary then, as I think, first to
set forth what we think is the purpose of every Hierarchy, and what
benefit each one confers upon its followers; and next to celebrate the
Heavenly Hierarchies according to their revelation in the Oracles; then
following these Oracles, to say in what sacred forms the holy writings
of the Oracles depict the celestial orders, and to what sort of
simplicity we must be carried through the representations; in order that
we also may not, like the vulgar, irreverently think that the heavenly
and Godlike minds are certain many-footed <span
id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) and many-faced <span
id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) creatures, or moulded to the
brutishness of oxen <span id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) , or the
savage form of lions<span id="iv.ii.ii-p3.7"></span>[Ezekiel
1:10](../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#010.md)<span id="iv.ii.ii-p3.7"></span>, and
fashioned like the hooked beaks of eagles<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p3.8"></span>[Ezekiel
1:10](../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#010.md)<span id="iv.ii.ii-p3.8"></span>, or
the feathery down of birds <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md) , and
should imagine that there are certain wheels <span
id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) of fire above the heaven, <span
id="page_5">p. 5</span> <span id="iv.ii.ii-Page_5"></span>or material
thrones <span id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) upon which the Godhead
may recline, or certain many-coloured <span
id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) horses, and spear-bearing leaders of
the host <span id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) , and whatever else was
transmitted by the Oracles to us under multifarious symbols of sacred
imagery.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p4"></span>And indeed, the Word of God <span
id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md) artlessly makes use of poetic
representations of sacred things, respecting the shapeless minds, out of
regard to our intelligence, so to speak, consulting a mode of education
proper and natural to it, and moulding the inspired writings for it.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p5"></span>Section II.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p6"></span>But if any one think well to accept the
sacred compositions as of things simple and unknown in their own nature,
and beyond our contemplation, but thinks the imagery of the holy minds
in the Oracles is incongruous, and that all this is, so to speak, a rude
scenic representation of the angelic names; and further says that the
theologians ought, when they have come to the bodily representation of
creatures altogether without body, to represent and display them by
appropriate and, as far as possible, cognate figures, taken, at any
rate, from our most honoured and immaterial and exalted beings, and
ought not to clothe the heavenly and Godlike simple essences with the
many forms of the lowest creatures to be found on the earth (for the one
would perhaps be more adapted to our instruction, and would not <span
id="page_6">p. 6</span> <span id="iv.ii.ii-Page_6"></span> degrade the
celestial explanations to incongruous dissimilitudes; but the other both
does violence without authority to the Divine powers, and likewise leads
astray our minds, through dwelling upon these irreverent descriptions);
and perhaps he will also think that the super-heavenly places are filled
with certain herds of lions, and troops of horses, and bellowing songs
of praise, and flocks of birds, and other living creatures, and material
and less honourable things, and whatever else the similitudes of the
Oracles, in every respect dissimilar, describe, for a so-called
explanation, but which verge towards the absurd, and pernicious, and
impassioned; now, in my opinion, the investigation of the truth
demonstrates the most sacred wisdom of the Oracles, in the descriptions
of the Heavenly Minds, taking forethought, as that wisdom does, wholly
for each, so as neither, as one may say, to do violence to the Divine
Powers, nor at the same time to enthral us in the grovelling passions of
the debased imagery. For any one might say that the cause why forms are
naturally attributed to the formless, and shapes to the shapeless, is
not alone our capacity which is unable immediately to elevate itself to
the intelligible contemplations, and that it needs appropriate and
cognate instructions which present images, suitable to us, of the
formless and supernatural objects of contemplation; but further, that it
is most agreeable to the revealing Oracles to conceal, through mystical
and sacred enigmas, and to keep the holy and secret truth respecting the
supermundane minds inaccessible to the multitude. <span id="page_7">p.
7</span> <span id="iv.ii.ii-Page_7"></span> For it is not every one that
is holy, nor, as the Oracles affirm, does knowledge belong to all <span
id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) .

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p7"></span>Section III.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p8"></span>But if any one should blame the
descriptions as being incongruous, by saying that it is shameful to
attribute shapes so repugnant to the Godlike and most holy Orders, it is
enough to reply that the method of Divine revelation is twofold; one,
indeed, as is natural, proceeding through likenesses that are similar,
and of a sacred character, but the other, through dissimilar forms,
fashioning them into entire unlikeness and incongruity. No doubt, the
mystical traditions of the revealing Oracles sometimes extol the august
Blessedness of the super-essential Godhead, as Word <span
id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) , and Mind <span
id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) , and Essence <span
id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) , manifesting its God-becoming
expression and wisdom, both as really being Origin, and true Cause of
the origin of things being, and they describe It as light <span
id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) , and call it life. While such sacred
descriptions are more reverent, and seem in a certain way to be superior
to the material images, they yet, even thus, in reality fall short of
the supremely Divine similitude. For It is above every essence and life.
No light, indeed, expresses its character, and every description and
mind incomparably fall short of Its similitude.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p9"></span>But at other times its praises are
supermundanely sung, by the Oracles themselves, through dissimilar
revelations, when they affirm that it is invisible <span
id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md) , and <span id="page_8">p. 8</span>
<span id="iv.ii.ii-Page_8"></span>infinite <span
id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) , and incomprehensible <span
id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) ; and when there is signified, not
what it is, but what it is not. For this, as I think, is more
appropriate to It, since, as the secret and sacerdotal tradition taught,
we rightly describe its non-relationship to things created, but we do
not know its superessential, and inconceivable, and unutterable
indefinability. If, then, the negations respecting things Divine are
true, but the affirmations are inharmonious, the revelation as regards
things invisible, through dissimilar representations, is more
appropriate to the hiddenness of things unutterable. Thus the sacred
descriptions of the Oracles honour, and do not expose to shame, the
Heavenly Orders, when they make them known by dissimilar pictorial
forms, and demonstrate through these their supermundane superiority over
all. material things. And I do not suppose that any sensible man will
gainsay that the incongruous elevate our mind more than the similitudes;
for there is a likelihood, with regard to the more sublime
representations of heavenly things, that we should be led astray, so as
to think that the Heavenly Beings are certain creatures with the
appearance of gold, and certain men with the appearance of light <span
id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) , and glittering like lightning <span
id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) , handsome <span
id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md) , clothed in bright shining raiment,
shedding forth innocuous flame, and so with regard to all the other
shapes and appropriate forms, with which the Word of God has depicted
the Heavenly Minds. In order that men might not suffer from this, by
<span id="page_9">p. 9</span> <span id="iv.ii.ii-Page_9"></span>thinking
they are nothing more exalted than their beau tiful appearance, the
elevating wisdom of the pious theologians reverently conducts to the
incongruous dissimilarities, not permitting our earthly part to rest
fixed in the base images, but urging the upward tendency of the soul,
and goading it by the unseemliness of the phrases (to see) that it
belongs neither to lawful nor seeming truth, even for the most earthly
conceptions, that the most heavenly and Divine visions are actually like
things so base. Further also this must particularly be borne in mind,
that not even one of the things existing is altogether deprived of
participation in the beautiful, since, as is evident and the truth of
the Oracles affirms, all things are very beautiful <span
id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) .

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p10"></span>Section IV.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p11"></span>It is, then, possible to frame in one’s
mind good contemplations from everything, and to depict, from things
material, the aforesaid dissimilar similitudes, both for the
intelligible and the intelligent; since the intelligent hold in a
different fashion things which are attributed to things sensible
differently. For instance, appetite, in the irrational creatures, takes
its rise in the passions, and their movement, which takes the form of
appetite, is full of all kinds of unreasonableness. But with regard to
the intelligent, we must think of the appetite in another fashion, as
denoting, according to my judgment, their manly style, and their
determined persistence <span id="page_10">p. 10</span> <span
id="iv.ii.ii-Page_10"></span>in their Godlike and unchangeable
steadfastness. In like manner we say, with regard to the irrational
creatures, that lust is a certain uncircumspect and earthly passionate
attachment, arising incontinently from an innate movement, or intimacy
in things subject to change, and the irrational supremacy of the bodily
desire, which drives the whole organism towards the object of sensual
inclination. But when we attribute "lust" to spiritual beings, by
clothing them with dissimilar similitudes, we must think that it is a
Divine love of the immaterial, above expression and thought, and the
inflexible and determined longing for the supernally pure and
passionless contemplation, and for the really perpetual and intelligible
fellowship in that pure and most exalted splendour, and in the abiding
and beautifying comeliness. And 'incontinence’ we may take for the
persistent and inflexible, which nothing can repulse, on account of the
pure and changeless love for the Divine beauty, and the whole tendency
towards the really desired. But with regard to the irrational living
beings, or soulless matter, we appropriately call their irrationality
and want of sensible perception a deprivation of reason and sensible
perception. And with regard to the immaterial and intelligent beings, we
reverently acknowledge their superiority, as supermundane beings, over
our discursive and bodily reason, and the material perception of the
senses which is alien to the incorporeal Minds. It is, then, permissible
to depict forms, which are not discordant, to the celestial beings, even
from <span id="page_11">p. 11</span> <span
id="iv.ii.ii-Page_11"></span>portions of matter which are the least
honourable, since even it, having had its beginning from the Essentially
Beautiful, has throughout the whole range of matter some echoes of the
intellectual comeliness; and it is possible through these to be led to
the immaterial archetypes--things most similar being taken, as has been
said, dissimilarly, and the identities being denned, not in the same
way, but harmoniously, and appropriately, as regards the intellectual
and sensible beings.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p12"></span>Section V.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p13"></span>We shall find the Mystic Theologians
enfolding these things not only around the illustrations of the Heavenly
Orders, but also, sometimes, around the supremely Divine Revelations
Themselves. At one time, indeed, they extol It under exalted imagery as
Sun <span id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md) of Righteousness, as
Morning <span id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) Star rising divinely in
the mind, and as Light <span id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) illuming
without veil and for contemplation; and at other times, through things
in our midst, as Fire <span id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) , shedding
its innocuous light; as Water <span id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) ,
furnishing a fulness of life, and, to speak symbolically, flowing into a
belly, and bubbling forth rivers flowing irresistibly; and at other
times, from things most remote, as sweet-smelling ointment <span
id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) , as Head Corner-stone <span
id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) . But they also clothe It in forms of
wild beasts, and attach to It identity with a Lion <span
id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md) , and Panther <span
id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) , and say that it shall be a
Leopard <span id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) , and a rushing
Bear<span id="iv.ii.ii-p13.22"></span>[Hosea
13:8](../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.ii.ii-p13.22"></span>.
But, <span id="page_12">p. 12</span> <span
id="iv.ii.ii-Page_12"></span>I will also add, that which seems to be
more dishonourable than all, and the most incongruous, viz. that
distinguished theologians have shewn it to us as representing Itself
under the form of a worm <span id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) . Thus
do all the godly-wise, and interpreters of the secret inspiration,
separate the holy of holies <span id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) from
the uninitiated and the unholy, to keep them undefined, and prefer the
dissimilar description of holy things, so that Divine things should
neither be easily reached by the profane, nor those who diligently
contemplate the Divine imagery rest in the types as though they were
true; and so Divine things should be honoured by the true negations, and
by comparisons with the lowest things, which are diverse from their
proper resemblance. There is then nothing absurd if they depict even the
Heavenly Beings under incongruous dissimilar similitudes, for causes
aforesaid. For probably not even we should have come to an
investigation, from not seeing our way,--not to say to mystic meaning
through an accurate enquiry into Divine things,--unless the deformity of
the descriptions representing the Angels had shocked us, not permitting
our mind to linger in the discordant representations, but rousing us
utterly to reject the earthly proclivities, and accustoming us to
elevate ourselves through things that are seen, to their supermundane
mystical meanings. Let these things suffice to have been said on account
of the material and incongruous descriptions of the holy Angels in the
Holy Oracles. And next, it is <span id="page_13">p. 13</span> <span
id="iv.ii.ii-Page_13"></span>necessary to define what we think the
Hierarchy is in itself, and what benefit those who possess a Hierarchy
derive; from the same. But let Christ lead the discourse--if it be
lawful to me to say--He Who is mine,--the Inspiration of all
Hierarchical revelation. And thou, my son, after the pious rule of our
Hierarchical tradition, do thou religiously listen to things religiously
uttered, becoming inspired through instruction in inspired things; and
when thou hast enfolded the Divine things in the secret recesses of thy
mind, guard them closely from the profane multitude as being uniform,
for it is not lawful, as the Oracles say, to cast to swine the unsullied
and bright and beautifying comeliness of the intelligible pearls.
