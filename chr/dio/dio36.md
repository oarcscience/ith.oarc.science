## <span id="ii.v.i-p0.1"></span>PREFACE TO LITURGY.

<span id="ii.v.i-p1"></span>THIS Liturgy gives the doctrine of Dionysius
in a liturgical form. The Greek original might be restored from the
writings of Dionysius. No one could reasonably doubt that the Author of
the Writings and the Liturgy was the same. This Liturgy should be
compared with the Coptic Liturgy of Dionysius, Bishop of Athens,
disciple of Paul, and with the Liturgy of St. Basil, adapted from this,
as used by the Uniat Copts, translated by the Marquess of Bute. In my
opinion, this Liturgy was written for the Therapeutae near Alexandria,
described by Philo in his "contemplative life," who were Christians; who
occupied themselves with the contemplation of the Divine Names, and the
heavenly Hierarchy. It was written not earlier than the death of James,
Apostle and Martyr, A.D. 42, and probably not later than A.D. 67; when
Dionysius, at the request of St. Paul, left Athens to meet the Apostle
at Rome, for the purpose of being sent by him to Gaul. A note of
primitive antiquity is found in the description of the Church, as "from
one end of the earth to the other." There is no "one, only, holy,
Catholic, and Apostolic Orthodox Church," as in the later Liturgy of St.
Basil. Some expressions are obscure, from the Latin <span

and it would be rash, without profound study, to venture to suggest the
Greek text. In consequence of this, and other Liturgies, and his
excellent writings, Dionysius was frequently commemorated in the
diptychs as one of the Doctors of the Church.
