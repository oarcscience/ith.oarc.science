### <span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p0.1"></span>CAPUT II.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p1"></span>Concerning common and distinctive
theology, and what is the Divine Union and distinction.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p2"></span>SECTION I.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p3"></span>LET then the self-existent Goodness be
sung from the Oracles as defining and manifesting the whole <span
id="page_13">p. 13</span> <span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-Page_13"></span>
supremely-Divine-Subsistence in its essential nature. For, what else is
there to learn from the sacred theology, when it affirms that the
Godhead Itself, leading the way, says, "Why dost thou ask me concerning
the Good?--None is Good except God alone." Now, this, we have thoroughly
demonstrated elsewhere, that always, all the God-becoming Names of God,
are celebrated by the Oracles, not partitively, but as applied to the
whole and entire and complete and full Godhead, and that all of them are
referred impartitively, absolutely, unreservedly, entirely, to all the
Entirety of the entirely complete and every Deity. And verily as we have
mentioned in the *Theological Outlines,* if any one should say that this
is not spoken concerning the whole Deity, he blasphemes, and dares,
without right, to cleave asunder the super-unified Unity.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p4"></span>We must affirm, then, that this is to
be received respecting the whole Deity. For even the essentially Good
Word Himself said, "I am Good <span id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md) ."
And a certain one of the God-rapt Prophets celebrates the Spirit as "the
Good <span id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md) ." And again this, "I am He,
Who is <span id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md) ." If they shall say that
this is said, not of the whole Deity, but should violently limit it to
one part, how will they understand this? "These things, saith He, Who
is, Who was, Who is to come, the Almighty <span
id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md) ," and "Thou art the same <span
id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) ," and this, "Spirit of truth, which is,
which proceedeth from the Father <span id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) ."
And if they say that the supremely Divine Life is not coextensive with
the <span id="page_14">p. 14</span> <span
id="ii.ii.ii.ii-Page_14"></span> whole, how is the sacred Word true
which said, "As the Father raiseth the dead and maketh alive, so also
the Son maketh alive whom He will <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md)
," and that "the Spirit is He, Who maketh alive <span
id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23)  <span id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md) .
But the Spirit also is Lord <span id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) . And
"the beautiful and the wise" are also sung respecting the whole Deity.
And the light, and the deifying, and the cause, and whatever pertains to
the whole Godhead, the Oracles introduce into all the supremely Divine
hymnody--collectively, when they say "all things are from Almighty God;
"but, specifically, as when they say, "all things were made through Him
and to Him," and "all things in Him consist," and "Thou shalt send forth
Thy Spirit, and they shall be made." And, that one may speak summarily,
the supremely Divine Word Himself said, "I and the Father are One," and
"all that the Father hath are Mine," and, "All Mine are Thine, and
Thine, Mine." And again, whatever pertains to the Father and Himself, He
attributes. to the supremely Divine Spirit, collectively and in
common--the works of God--the homage, the fontal and ceaseless cause and
the distribution of the goodly gifts. And I think, none of those, who
have been nourished in the Divine Oracles with unprejudiced conceptions,
<span id="page_15">p. 15</span> <span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-Page_15"></span>
will oppose this, that all things befitting God belong to the whole
Godhead, according to the divinely perfect Word. Since, then, we have
demonstrated and defined these things from the Oracles,--here indeed
partially, but elsewhere sufficiently--we will undertake to unfold every
Divine Name whatsoever, which is to be received as referring to the
whole Deity.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p5"></span>SECTION II.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p6"></span>But if any one should say that we
introduce in so doing a confusion, in disparagement of the distinction
which befits God, we do not think that such a statement as this is
itself sufficient to convince that it is true. For, if there is any one
who has placed himself entirely in opposition to the Oracles, he will be
also entirely apart from our. philosophy; and, if he has no care for the
divine Wisdom of the Oracles, how shall we care for his guidance to the
theological science? But, if he regards the truth of the Oracles, we
also, using this canon and illumination, will advance unwaveringly to
the answer, as best we can, by affirming that theology transmits some
things as common, but others as distinctive; and neither is it meet to
divide the common, nor to confuse the distinctive; but that following It
according to our ability, we ought to rise to the Divine splendours;
for, by taking thence the Divine revelations, as a most excellent canon
of truth, we strive to guard the things lying there, in their native
simplicity and integrity and identity--being ourselves guarded in our
guard of <span id="page_16">p. 16</span> <span
id="ii.ii.ii.ii-Page_16"></span> the Oracles, and from these receiving
strength to guard those who guard them.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p7"></span>SECTION III.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p8"></span>The (Names) then, common to the whole
Deity, as we have demonstrated from the Oracles, by many instances in
the *Theological Outlines,* are the Super-Good, the Super-God, the
Super-essential, the Super-Living, the Super-Wise, and whatever else
belongs to the superlative abstraction; with which also, all those
denoting Cause, the Good, the Beautiful, the Being, the Life-producing,
the Wise, and whatever Names are given to the Cause of all Good, from
His goodly gifts. But the distinctive Names are the superessential name
and property of Father, and Son and Spirit, since no interchange or
community in these is in any way introduced. But there is a further
distinction, viz., the complete and unaltered existence of Jesus amongst
us, and all the mysteries of love towards man actually existing within
it.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p9"></span>SECTION IV.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p10"></span>But it is rather necessary, I suppose,
to resume and to set forth the complete fashion of the Divine union and
distinction, in order that the whole discourse may be seen at a glance
to reject everything ambiguous and indistinct, and to define critically
and distinctly the proper Names, as far as possible. For, as I said
elsewhere, the sacred instructors of our theological tradition call the
"Divine Unions" the hidden and unrevealed sublimities of the <span
id="page_17">p. 17</span> <span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-Page_17"></span>
super-unutterable and super-unknown Isolation; but the "distinctions,"
the goodly progressions and manifestations of the Godhead; and,
following the sacred Oracles, they mention also properties of the
aforesaid "Union; "and again of the distinction, that there are certain
specific unions and distinctions. For example, with regard to the Divine
Union, that is, the Superessentiality, there is kindred and common to
the One-springing Triad, the superessential sustaining Source, the
super-Divine Deity, the super-good Goodness, the supreme identity of the
whole supreme Idiosyncrasy, the Oneness above source of one; the
Unspeakable; the Much-speaking, the Agnosia, the Comprehended by all,
the Placing of all, the Abstraction of all, that which is above all
affirmation and abstraction, the abiding and steadfastness in each
other, if I may so speak, wholly super-united and in no part commingled
of the One-springing Persons, just as lights of lamps (to use sensible
illustrations familiar to our capacity), when in one house, are both
wholly distinct in each other throughout, and keep the distinction from
each other specifically and perfectly maintained, being one in
distinction and distinct in union; and then, indeed, we may see in a
house, in which are many lamps, the lights of all united to form one
certain light and lighting up one combined radiance; and, as I suppose,
no one would be able to distinguish in the air containing all the lights
the light of one or other lamp from the rest, <span id="page_18">p.
18</span> <span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-Page_18"></span> and to see one without
the other, since whole in whole are mixed together without being
mingled. But, if any one were to take out from the chamber one
particular burner, the whole light belonging to it will depart with it;
no particle of the other lights being drawn along with it, nor any of
its own light left with the other. For there was, as I said, the
complete union of all with all, unmingled throughout, and in no part
confused, and this actually in a body, the air, the light even itself
being dependent on the material fire. Whence we affirm that the
superessential Union is fixed above not only the unions in bodies, but
also above those in souls themselves, and in minds themselves, which, in
a manner unmingled and supermundane, the Godlike and supercelestial
Illuminations, whole through whole, possess, as beseems a participation
analogous to those who participate in the Union elevated above all.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p11"></span>SECTION V.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p12"></span>But there is a distinction in the
superessential nomenclature of God, not only that which I have
mentioned, namely, that each of the One-springing Persons is fixed in
the union itself, unmingled and unconfused; but also that the properties
of the superessential Divine Production are not convertible in regard to
one another. The Father is sole Fountain of the superessential Deity,
since the Father is not Son, nor the Son, Father; since the hymns
reverently guard their own characteristics for each of the supremely
Divine Persons. These then<span id="page_19">p. 19</span> <span
id="ii.ii.ii.ii-Page_19"></span> are the unions and distinctions within
the unutterable Union and sustaining Source. But, if the goodly
progression of the Divine Union, multiplying itself super-uniquely
through Goodness, and taking to itself many forms, is also a Divine
distinction, yet, common within the Divine distinction, are the
resistless distributions, the substance-giving, the life-giving, the
wise-making, and the other gifts of the Goodness, Cause of all, after
which from the participations and those participating are celebrated the
things imparticipatively participated. And this is kindred and common,
and one, to the whole Divinity, that it is all entire, participated by
each of the Participants, and by none partially. Just as a point in a
circle’s centre participates in all the circumjacent <span
id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md) straight lines in the circle, and as many
impressions of a seal participate in the archetypal seal, and in each of
the impressions the seal is whole and the same, and in none partial in
any respect. But superior to these is the impartibility of the
Deity--Cause of all--from the fact that there is no contact with it. Nor
has it any commingled communion with the things participating.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p13"></span>SECTION VI.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p14"></span>And yet some one might say the seal is
not whole and the same in the images throughout. But of this the seal is
not the cause, for it imparts itself all and the same to each; but the
difference of the recipients makes the figures dissimilar, since the
<span id="page_20">p. 20</span> <span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-Page_20"></span>
archetype is one and complete and the same. For instance, if the wax
were soft and impressionable, and smooth and unstamped, and neither
unimpressionable and hard, nor running and dissolving, it will have the
figure clear and sharp and fixed. But if it should lack any of the
aforesaid aptitudes, this will be the cause of the non-participative and
un-figured and indistinct, and whatever else arises from inaptitude for
reception. Further, there is a distinction from the goodly work of God
towards us, in that the superessential Word was invested with being
amongst us--from us--wholly and truly, and did and suffered whatever
things are choice and pre-eminent in His human work of God. For in
these, the Father and the Spirit in no respect communicated, except
perhaps, one might say, as regards the benign and philanthropic purpose,
and as regards all the pre-eminent and unutterable work of God which the
unchangeable, *qua* God and Word of God, did when He had been born
amongst us. Thus we, too, strive to unite and distinguish in the Word
the things Divine, as the things Divine themselves, are united and
distinguished.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p15"></span>SECTION VII.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p16"></span>Now we have set forth in the
*Theological Outlines* whatever Divine Causes we have found in the
Oracles, of these unions, and distinctions, by treating each separately,
according to our ability; by explaining some things, by the infallible
Word, and <span id="page_21">p. 21</span> <span
id="ii.ii.ii.ii-Page_21"></span> unfolding them; and by conducting the
religious and unpolluted mind to the bright visions of the Oracles; but
others, as being full of mystery, by approaching them according to the
Divine tradition, which is superior to mental energy. For all the Divine
properties, even those revealed to us, are known by the participations
alone; and themselves, such as they are in their own source and abode,
are above mind and all essence and knowledge. For instance, if we have
named the superessential Hiddenness, God, or Life, or Essence, or Light,
or Word (<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p16.1"></span>λόγος), we have no other
thought than that the powers brought to us from It are deifying, or
essentiating, or life-bearing, or wisdom-imparting; but to Itself we
approach during the cessation of all the intellectual energies, seeing
no deification, or life, or essence whatever, such as is strictly like
the Cause pre-eminently elevated above all. Again, that the Father is
fontal Deity, but the Lord Jesus and the Spirit are, if one may so
speak, God-planted shoots, and as it were Flowers and superessential
Lights of the God-bearing Deity, we have received from the holy Oracles;
but how these things are, it is neither possible to say, nor to
conceive.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p17"></span>SECTION VIII.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p18"></span>But. up to this point, our utmost
power of mental energy carries us, namely, that all divine paternity and
sonship have been bequeathed from the Source of paternity and Source of
sonship--pre-eminent above all--both to us and to the supercelestial
<span id="page_22">p. 22</span> <span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-Page_22"></span>
powers, from which the godlike become both gods, and sons of gods, and
fathers of gods, and are named Minds, such a paternity and sonship being
of course accomplished spiritually, i.e. incorporeally, immaterially,
intellectually,-- since the supremely Divine Spirit is seated above all
intellectual immateriality, and deification, and the Father and the Son
are pre-eminently elevated above all divine paternity and sonship. For
there is no strict likeness, between the caused and the causes. The
caused indeed possess the accepted likenesses of the causes, but the
causes themselves are elevated and established above the caused,
according to the ratio of their proper origin. And, to use illustrations
suitable to ourselves, pleasures and pains are said to be productive of
pleasure and pain, but these themselves feel neither pleasure nor pain.
And fire, whilst heating and burning, is not said to be burnt and
heated. And, if any one should say that the self-existent Life lives, or
that the self-existent Light is enlightened, in my view he will not
speak correctly, unless, perhaps, he should say this after another
fashion, that the properties of the caused are abundantly and
essentially pre-existent in the causes.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p19"></span>SECTION IX.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p20"></span>Further also, the most conspicuous
fact of all theology--the God-formation of Jesus amongst us--is both
unutterable by every expression and unknown to every mind, even to the
very foremost of the most reverend angels. The fact indeed that. He took
<span id="page_23">p. 23</span> <span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-Page_23"></span>
substance as man, we have received as a mystery, but we do not know in
what manner, from virginal bloods, by a different law, beyond nature, He
was formed, and how, with dry feet, having a bodily bulk and weight of
matter, He marched upon the liquid and unstable substance <span
id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md) ; and so, with regard to all the other
features of the super-physical physiology of Jesus. Now, we have
elsewhere sufficiently spoken of these things, and they have been
celebrated by our illustrious leader, in his *Theological Elements,* in
a manner far beyond natural ability--things which that illustrious man
acquired, either from the sacred theologians, or comprehended from the
scientific, search of the Oracles, from manifold struggles and
investigations respecting the same, or was instructed from a sort of
more Divine Inspiration, not only having learnt, but having felt the
pangs of things Divine, and from his sympathy with them, if I may so
speak, having been perfected to their untaught and mystic union and
acceptance. And that we may display, in fewest words, the many and
blessed visions of his most excellent intelligence, the following are
the things he says, concerning the Lord Jesus, in the *Theological
Elements* compiled by him.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p21"></span>SECTION X.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p22"></span>From the Theological Elements of the
most holy Hierotheus.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p23"></span>Deity of the Lord Jesus,-- the Cause
and Completing of all, which preserves the parts concordant <span
id="page_24">p. 24</span> <span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-Page_24"></span> with
the whole, and is neither part nor whole, and whole and part, as
embracing in Itself everything both part and whole, and being above and
before--is perfect indeed in the imperfect, as source of perfection, but
imperfect in the perfect, as super-perfect, and pre-perfect--Form
producing form, in things without form, as Source of form--formless in
the forms, as above form,--Essence, penetrating without stain the
essences throughout, and superessential, exalted above every
essence--setting bounds to the whole principalities and orders, and
established above every principality and order. It is measure also of
things existing, and age, and above age, and before age--full, in things
that need, super-full in things full, unutterable, unspeakable, above
mind, above life, above essence. It has the supernatural,
supernaturally,--the superessential, superessentially. Hence, since
through love towards man, He has come even to nature, and really became
substantial, and the Super-God lived as Man <span
id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md) (may He be merciful with regard to the
things we are celebrating, which are beyond mind and expression), and in
these He has the supernatural and super-substantial, not only in so far
as He communicated with us without alteration and without confusion,
suffering no loss as regards His super-fulness, from His unutterable
emptying of Himself--but also, because the newest of all new things, He
was in our physical condition super-physical--in things substantial,
super-substantial, excelling all the things--of us--from us--above us.
<span id="page_25">p. 25</span> <span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-Page_25"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p24"></span>SECTION XI.

<span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-p25"></span>This then is sufficient on these
matters, let us now advance to the purpose of the discourse by
unfolding, to the best of our ability, the kindred and common Names of
the Divine distinction. And, in order that we may first distinctly
define everything, in order, we call Divine distinction, as we have
said, the goodly progressions of the Godhead. For, by being given to all
things existing, and pouring forth the whole imparted goods in
abundance, It is distinguished uniformly, and multiplied uniquely, and
is moulded into many from the One, whilst being self-centred. For
example, since Almighty God is superessentially Being, but the Being is
bequeathed to things being, and produces the whole Essences; that One
Being is said to be fashioned in many forms, by the production from
Itself of the many beings, whilst It remains undiminished, and One in
the multiplicity, and Unified during the progression, and complete in
the distinction, both by being superessentially exalted above all
beings, and by the unique production of the whole; and by the
un-lessened stream of His undiminished distributions. Further, being
One, and having distributed the One, both to every part and whole, both
to one and to multitude, He is One, as it were, superessentially, being
neither a part of the multitude, nor whole from parts; and thus is
neither one, nor partakes of one, nor has the one. But, beyond these, He
is One, above the one, to things existing--One, and multitude
indivisible, unfilled super-fulness, producing <span id="page_26">p.
26</span> <span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-Page_26"></span> and perfecting and
sustaining every one thing and multitude. Again, by the Deification from
Itself, by the Divine likeness of many who become gods, according to
their several capacity, there seems, and is said to be, a distinction
and multiplication of the One God, but. He is none the less the Supreme
God, and super-God, superessentially One God,--undivided in things
divided, unified in Himself, both unmingled and unmultiplied in the
many. And when the common conductor of ourselves, and of our leader to
the Divine gift of light,--he, who is great in Divine mysteries--the
light of the world--had thought out this in a manner above natural
ability,--he speaks as follows, from the inspiration of God, in his
sacred writings--"For, even if there are who are called gods, whether in
heaven or upon earth, as there are gods many and lords many; but to us
there is One God, the Father, from Whom are all things, and we unto
Him,--and One Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom are all things, and we,
through Him <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md) ." For, with regard to
things Divine, the unions overrule the distinctions, and precede them,
and are none the less unified, even after the self-centred and unified
distinction. These, the mutual and common distinctions, or rather the
goodly progressions of the whole Deity, we will endeavour to the best of
our ability to celebrate from the Names of God, which make them known in
the Oracles;--first, having laid down, as we have said, that every
beneficent Name of God, to whichever of the supremely <span
id="page_27">p. 27</span> <span id="ii.ii.ii.ii-Page_27"></span> Divine
Persons it may be applied, is to be understood with reference to the
whole Supremely Divine wholeness unreservedly.
