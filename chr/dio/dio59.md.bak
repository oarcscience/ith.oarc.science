## <span id="iv.iii-p0.1"></span>ECCLESIASTICAL HIERARCHY.

<span id="iv.iii.i"></span>

### <span id="iv.iii.i-p0.1"></span>CAPUT I.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p1"></span>To my Fellow Presbyter Timothy. Dionysius
the Presbyter.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p2"></span>What is the traditional view of the
Ecclesiastical Hierarchy and what is its purpose?

<span id="iv.iii.i-p3"></span>Section I.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p4"></span>We must, then, most pious of pious sons,
demonstrate from the supermundane and most sacred Oracles and
traditions, that ours is a Hierarchy of the inspired and Divine and
Deifying science, and of operation, and of consecration, for those who
have been initiated with the initiation of the sacred revelation derived
from the hierarchical mysteries. See, however, that you do not put to
scorn things most holy (Holy of Holies); but rather treat them
reverently, and you will honour the things of the hidden God by
intellectual and obscure researches, carefully guarding them from the
participation and defilement of the uninitiated, and reverently sharing
holy things with the holy alone, by a holy enlightenment. For thus, as
the Word of God has taught us who feast at His Banquet, even Jesus
Himself--the most supremely Divine <span id="page_68">p. 68</span> <span
id="iv.iii.i-Page_68"></span> Mind and superessential, the Source and
Essence, and most supremely Divine Power of every Hierarchy and
Sanctification and Divine operation--illuminates the blessed Beings who
are superior to us, in a manner more clear, and at the same time more
intellectual, and assimilates them to His own Light, as far as possible;
and by our love of things beautiful elevated to Him, and which elevates
us, folds together our many diversities, and after perfecting into a
uniform and Divine life and habit and operation, holily bequeaths the
power of the Divine Priesthood; from which by approaching to the holy
exercise of the priestly office, we ourselves become nearer to the
Beings above us, by assimilation, according to our power, to their
abiding and: unchangeable holy steadfastness; and thus by looking
upwards to the blessed and supremely Divine self of Jesus, and
reverently gazing upon whatever. we are permitted to see, and
illuminated with the knowledge of the visions, we shall be able to
become, as regards the science of Divine mysteries, purified and
purifiers; images of Light, and workers, with God, perfected and
perfecting.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p5"></span>Section II.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p6"></span>Then what is the Hierarchy of the
Angels <span id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) and Archangels, and of
supermundane Principalities and Authorities, Powers and Lordships, and
Divine Thrones, or of the Beings of the same ranks as the Thrones--which
the Word of God declares to <span id="page_69">p. 69</span> <span
id="iv.iii.i-Page_69"></span>be near, and always about God, and
with <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md) God, naming them in the
Hebrew tongue Cherubim and Seraphim--by pondering the sacred ranks and
divisions of their Orders and Hierarchies, you will find in the books we
have written--not as befits their dignity but to the best of our
ability--and as the Theology of the most holy Scriptures guided, when
they extolled their Hierarchy. Nevertheless, it is necessary to say
this, that both that, and every Hierarchy extolled now by us, has one
and the same power, throughout the whole Hierarchical transaction; and
that the Hierarch himself, according to his essence, and analogy, and
rank, is initiated in Divine things, and is deified and imparts to the
subordinates, according to the meetness of each for the sacred
deification which comes to him from God; also that the subordinates
follow the superior, and elevate the inferior towards things in advance;
and that some go before, and, as far as possible, give the lead to
others; and that each, as far as may be, participates in the truly
Beautiful, and Wise, and Good, through this the inspired and sacerdotal
harmony.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p7"></span>But the Beings and ranks above us, of whom
we have already made a reverent mention, are both incorporeal, and their
Hierarchy is both intelligible and supermundane; but let us view our
Hierarchy, comformably to ourselves, abounding in the variety of the
sensible symbols, by which, in proportion to our capacity, we are
conducted, hierarchically <span id="page_70">p. 70</span> <span
id="iv.iii.i-Page_70"></span>according to our measure, to the uniform
deification --God and Divine virtue. They indeed, as minds, think,
according to laws laid down for themselves; but we are led by sensible
figures to the Divine contemplations, as is possible to us. And, to
speak truly, there is One, to Whom all the Godlike aspire, but they do
not partake uniformly of this One and the Same, but as the Divine
balance distributes to each the meet inheritance. Now these things have
been treated more systematically in the Treatise concerning
"Intelligible and Sensible <span id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) ."
But now I will attempt to describe our Hierarchy, both its source and
essence, as best I can; invoking Jesus, the source and Perfecting of all
Hierarchies.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p8"></span>Section III.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p9"></span>Every Hierarchy, then, is, according to
our august tradition, the whole account of the sacred things falling
under it, a most complete summary of the sacred rites of this or that
Hierarchy, as the case may be. Our Hierarchy, then, is called, and is,
the comprehensive system of the whole sacred rites included within it,
according to which the divine Hierarch, being initiated, will have the
communication of all the most sacred things within himself, as chief of
Hierarchy. For as he who speaks of Hierarchy speaks of the order of the
whole sacred rites collectively, so he, who mentions Hierarch, denotes
the inspired and godly man--the skilled in all sacred knowledge--in whom
the whole <span id="page_71">p. 71</span> <span
id="iv.iii.i-Page_71"></span>Hierarchy is clearly completed and
recognized within himself.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p10"></span>Head of this Hierarchy is the Fountain of
Life, the Essence of Goodness, the one Triad, Cause of things that be,
from Which both being and well-being come to things that be, by reason
of goodness <span id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md) . Of this most
supremely Divine blessedness --exalted beyond all, the threefold Monad,
the really Being,--the Will, inscrutable to us, but known to Itself, is
the rational preservation of beings amongst us and above us; but that
(preservation) cannot otherwise take place, except those who are, being
saved are being deified. Now the assimilation to, and union with, God,
as far as attainable, is deification. And this is the common goal of
every Hierarchy,--the clinging love towards God and Divine things
divinely and uniformly ministered; and previous to this, the complete
and unswerving removal of things contrary, the knowledge of things as
they are in themselves; the vision and science of sacred truth; the
inspired communication of the uniform perfection of the One Itself, as
far as attainable; the banquet of contemplation, nourishing
intelligibly, and deifying every man elevated towards it.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p11"></span>Section IV.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p12"></span>Let us affirm, then, that the supremely
Divine Blessedness, the essential Deity, the Source of <span
id="page_72">p. 72</span> <span
id="iv.iii.i-Page_72"></span>deification, from Which comes the
deification of those deified, bequeathed, by Divine Goodness, the
Hierarchy, for preservation, and deification of all rational and
intellectual Beings. And to the supermundane and blessed inheritances
there is bequeathed something more immaterial and intellectual (for
Almighty God does not move them to things divine, from without, but
intelligibly, since they are illuminated as to the most Divine will from
within, with brilliancy pure and immaterial), but to us--that which has
been bequeathed to them, uniformly, and enveloped, is bequeathed from
the Divinely transmitted Oracles, in a variety and multitude of
divisible symbols, as we are able to receive it. For the Divinely
transmitted Oracles are essence of our Hierarchy. And we affirm that
these Oracles--all such as were given from our godly initiators in
inspired Letters of the Word of God --are most august; and further,
whatever our leaders have revealed to us from the same holy men, by a
less material initiation, and already akin, as it were, to the Heavenly
Hierarchy, from mind to mind, through the medium of speech, corporeal,
indeed, but nevertheless more immaterial, without writing. Nor did the
inspired Hierarchs transmit these things, in conceptions clear to the
commonalty of worshippers, but in sacred symbols. For it is not every
one that is hallowed; nor, as the Oracles affirm, does knowledge belong
to all. <span id="page_73">p. 73</span> <span
id="iv.iii.i-Page_73"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i-p13"></span>Section V.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p14"></span>Necessarily, then, the first leaders of
our Hierarchy, after having been filled themselves with the sacred gift,
from the superessential Godhead, and sent, by the supremely Divine
Goodness, to extend the same gift successively, and, as godly, earnestly
desiring themselves the elevation and deification of those after them,
presented to us--by their written and unwritten revelations--in
accordance with their sacred injunctions, things supercelestial, by
sensible images, the enfolded, by variety and multitude, and things
Divine, by things human, and things immaterial, by things material, and
the superessential, by things belonging to us. Nor did they do this
merely on account of the unhallowed, to whom it is not permitted even to
touch the symbols, but because our Hierarchy is, as I said, a kind of
symbol adapted to our condition, which needs things sensible, for our
more Divine elevation from these to things intelligible. Nevertheless
the reasons of the symbols have been revealed to the Divine initiators,
which it is not permitted to explain to those who are yet being
initiated, knowing that the Lawgivers of things divinely transmitted
deliberately arranged the Hierarchy in well-established and unconfused
ranks, and in proportionate and sacred distributions of that which was
convenient to each, according to fitness. Wherefore trusting in thy
sacred promises (for it is a pious duty to recall them to thy
recollection) -- that, since every Hierarchical sacred word is of
binding <span id="page_74">p. 74</span> <span
id="iv.iii.i-Page_74"></span> force, thou wilt not communicate to any
other but those Godlike initiators of the same rank with thyself, and
wilt persuade them to promise, according to hierarchical regulation, to
touch pure things purely, and to communicate the mysteries of God to the
godly alone, and things perfect to those capable of perfection, and
things altogether most holy to the holy, I have entrusted this Divine
gift to thee, in addition to many other Hierarchical gifts.
