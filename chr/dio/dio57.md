### <span id="iv.ii.xiv-p0.1"></span>CAPUT XIV.

<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p1"></span>What the traditional number of the Angels
signifies.

<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p2"></span>This also is worthy, in my opinion, of
intellectual attention, that the tradition of the Oracles concerning the
Angels affirms that they are thousand thousands, and myriad myriads,
accumulating and multiplying, to themselves, the supreme limits of our
numbers, and, through these, shewing clearly, that the ranks of the
Heavenly Beings cannot be numbered by us. For many are the blessed hosts
of the supermundane minds, surpassing the weak and contracted
measurement of our material number, and being definitely known by their
own supermundane and heavenly intelligence and science alone, which is
given to them in profusion by the supremely Divine and Omniscient Framer
of Wisdom, and essentiating <span id="page_54">p. 54</span> <span

encompassing Term of all created things together.
