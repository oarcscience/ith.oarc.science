### <span id="iv.ii.vi-p0.1"></span>CAPUT VI.

<span id="iv.ii.vi-p1"></span>Which is the first Order of the Heavenly
Beings? which the middle? and which the last?

<span id="iv.ii.vi-p2"></span>How many, and of what sort, are the Orders
of the supercelestial Beings, and how the Hierarchies are classified
amongst themselves, I affirm, the deifying Author of their consecration
alone distinctly knows; and further, that they know their own proper
powers and illuminations, and their sacred and supermundane regularity.
For it is impossible that we should know the mysteries of the
supercelestial Minds and their most holy perfections, except, some one
might say, so far as the Godhead has revealed to us, through them, as
knowing perfectly their own condition. We, then, will utter nothing as
from ourselves, but whatever angelic visions have been gazed upon by the
holy Prophets of God, we, as initiated in these, will set forth as best
we can. The Word of God has designated the whole Heavenly Beings as
nine, by appellations, which shew their functions. These our Divine
Initiator divides into three threefold Orders. He also says that that
which is always around God is first and is declared by tradition to be
united closely and immediately, to Him, before all the rest. For he says
that the teaching of the Holy Oracles declares, that the most Holy
Thrones, and the many-eyed and many-winged hosts, named in the Hebrew
tongue Cherubim and Seraphim, are established immediately <span
id="page_24">p. 24</span> <span id="iv.ii.vi-Page_24"></span> around
God, with a nearness superior to all. This threefold order, then, our
illustrious Guide spoke of as one, and of equal rank, and really first
Hierarchy, than which there is not another more Godlike or immediately
nearer to the earliest illuminations of the Godhead. But he says, that
which is composed of the Authorities, and Lordships, and Powers is
second; and, as respects the lowest of the Heavenly Hierarchies, the
Order of the Angels and Archangels and Principalities is third.
