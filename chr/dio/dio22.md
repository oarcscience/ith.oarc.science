<span id="ii.iii.ii.iv"></span>

### <span id="ii.iii.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>CAPUT IV.

<span id="ii.iii.ii.iv-p1"></span>That the pre-eminent Cause of every
object of sensible perception is none of the objects of sensible
perception.

<span id="ii.iii.ii.iv-p2"></span>SECTION I.

<span id="ii.iii.ii.iv-p3"></span>WE say then- that the Cause of all,
which is above all, is neither without being, nor without life--nor
with- out reason, nor without mind, nor is a body--nor has shape--nor
form--nor quality, or quantity, or bulk--nor is in a place--nor is
seen--nor has sensible contact--nor perceives, nor is perceived, by the
senses--nor has disorder and confusion, as being vexed by earthly
passions,--nor is powerless, as being subject to casualties of
sense,--nor is in need of light;--neither is It, nor has It, change, or
decay, or division, or deprivation, or flux,--or any other of the
objects of sense.
