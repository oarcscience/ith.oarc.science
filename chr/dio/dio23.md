### <span id="ii.iii.ii.v-p0.1"></span>CAPUT V.

<span id="ii.iii.ii.v-p1"></span>That the pre-eminent Cause of every
object of intelligible perception is none of the objects of intelligible
perception.

<span id="ii.iii.ii.v-p2"></span>ON the other hand, ascending, we say,
that It is neither soul, nor mind, nor has imagination, or opinion, or
reason, or conception; neither is <span id="page_137">p. 137</span>
<span id="ii.iii.ii.v-Page_137"></span>expressed, nor conceived; neither
is number, nor order, nor greatness, nor littleness; nor equality, nor
inequality; nor similarity, nor dissimilarity; neither is standing, nor
moving; nor at rest; neither has power, nor is power, nor light; neither
lives, nor is life; neither is essence nor eternity, nor time; neither
is Its touch intelligible, neither is It science, nor truth; nor
kingdom, nor wisdom; neither one, nor oneness; neither Deity, nor
Goodness; nor is It Spirit according to our understanding; nor Sonship,
nor Paternity; nor any other thing of those known to us, or to any other
existing being; neither is It any of non-existing nor of existing
things, nor do things existing know It, as It is; nor does It know
existing things, *qua* existing; neither is there expression of It, nor
name, nor knowledge; neither is It darkness, nor light; nor error, nor
truth; neither is there any definition at all of It, nor any
abstraction. But when making the predications and abstractions of things
after It, we neither predicate, nor abstract from It; since the
all-perfect and uniform Cause of all is both above every definition and
the pre-eminence of Him, Who is absolutely freed from all, and beyond
the whole, is also above every abstraction.
