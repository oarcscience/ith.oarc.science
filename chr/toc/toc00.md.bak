TO

ERNEST BANCROFT CONANT,

Professor of Law, Christian Gentleman and My Good Friend, whose emphasis
upon the modernity of Ancient Truths first stimulated in me an interest
in Roman Law, and whose friendship through the years will always be an
inspiration—this little book is affectionately dedicated.
