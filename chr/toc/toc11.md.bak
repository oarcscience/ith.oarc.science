### CHAPTER VIII

### A LESSON IN CITIZENSHIP

The Author has spoken before meetings of various ward organizations in
St. Louis on the subject, "Political Lessons from the Trial of Christ."
Under such circumstances the utmost care is taken to avoid religious
differences and to point out that the trial of Christ has a three-fold
significance: the Technical aspect, the Citizenship aspect, and the
Messianic aspect. To an unlearned political audience the technical
portion which we have reviewed has to be stated in simple terms, in
order to put the larger emphasis on the idea that the remedy for legal
laxity is to honestly endeavor to get reform.

To illustrate, when the Lindbergh defendant, Hauptmann, <span
id="fr_116"></span>[116](#fn_116.md) assigned in an Appellate Court some 57
alleged errors in his trial for the kidnapping and murder of young
Lindbergh, a good church friend of mine ventured

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

the opinion that he would "get off on a technicality." We are glad he
did not. At the time, I told my friend that the technicalities of the
law are for the protection of all people, innocent and guilty alike. The
duty of a good citizen is not to wail over apparent technical
miscarriages of justice but rather to join hands with his fellows to
correct the existing procedural evils. How many of those who condemned
the Supreme Court for avoiding a Child Labor law some twenty-five years
ago, <span id="fr_117"></span>[117](#fn_117.md) ever turned their hands to
aid in the campaign to amend the Constitution of The United States so as
to permit regulation of this evil? How many of those who scorn politics
as "dirty" ever do anything to clean them up? How many so-called
professing Christians ever let their voice be heard in a political
meeting?

Intelligent reform of the law requires not only desire on the part of
the reformer for a betterment of conditions, not only the political
stamina and influence to get the legislative group to adopt his program,
but most of all an intelligent understanding of legal history

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

and precedent leading up to the existing dilemma, in order that the
reformer will be able to point out to this age the factual errors of
history. In drawing from the errors of the trial of Christ, therefore, a
lesson in citizenship, it is well that we have in mind the history of
law and the theory of human government. Archeology has its place in such
a study but is quite beyond the scope of our brief presentation. <span
id="fr_118"></span>[118](#fn_118.md) The basic principles of the law have
remained unchanged for four thousand years, <span
id="fr_119"></span>[119](#fn_119.md) and most of the great lawgivers of
history have either been trained in the law or inspired of God.
Somewhere the author has read that it was not mere accident that Moses
was rescued from the river by Pharaoh's daughter, but that as a result
of his upbringing in the royal palace Moses was educated in the Egyptian
universities of that day and had some knowledge of existing law

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

and of medicine as well. No doubt he had access to the Code of
[Hammurabi](errata.htm#6.md). Roman Law in force when Christ was tried, as
we have pointed out, was the Laws of the Twelve Tables. <span
id="fr_120"></span>[120](#fn_120.md) Some years ago the author wrote his
graduation thesis (unpublished) on "The Twelve Tables in Modern American
Law" and demonstrated that 87 of the 113 sections of The Twelve Tables
were in accord with our law, in principle if not in detail, in 1930
A.D., Two Thousand Three Hundred Eighty Years after they were
promulgated! <span id="fr_121"></span>[121](#fn_121.md) My brother <span
id="fr_122"></span>[122](#fn_122.md) has quite properly reminded the
writer, time and time again, that the law is not an end unto itself but
a means of enforcing some semblance of earthly justice until the world
is raptured by the

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Second Coming of
Christ: No man was ever saved by mere law!

The writings of St. Paul are very rich in their legal references. <span
id="fr_123"></span>[123](#fn_123.md) In our Appendix we mention the
legalism of Paul in more detail. The Bible tells us he had been a
student under the great and learned Gamaliel. <span
id="fr_124"></span>[124](#fn_124.md) Whether or not Paul was learned in the
law, the idea of the Church as the Body of Christ is clearer to a legal
mind if one remembers that corporations were known to law as far back as
500 B. C., <span id="fr_125"></span>[125](#fn_125.md) and that corporate
existence is the only worldly example of anything that resembles
immortality. <span id="fr_126"></span>[126](#fn_126.md)

Our point is that the legalisms in Paul's

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

writings and the existence of corporations in those days in Greek and
Roman Law—even the Hebrew corporate existence of the Sanhedrin—all aid
one in understanding Christ. We will refer again to the precious promise
that, "In My Father's house are many mansions, . . . I go to prepare a
place for you. " <span id="fr_127"></span>[127](#fn_127.md) Archeology has
discovered court records in Egypt in the [Koine](errata.htm#7.md) Greek
language in which the word "Mansion" used in the passage quoted is used
in the sense of "Habitable real estate acceptable for bail bond." <span
id="fr_128"></span>[128](#fn_128.md) We are sure our Heavenly Home will be
habitable like that.

A great sage once said that one cannot stand still. The minute a
movement stops growing, it deteriorates. As long as there were other
worlds to conquer, Rome was a powerful state but when progress stopped
the Empire fell. The public is prone to point out the laxities in our
laws and government and lay the blame to two groups—the lawyers and the
politicians. A failure of the Roman government to enforce the rigid laws
in that great trial in Jerusalem caused the greatest

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

public murder in history. From that failure we can learn the value of
enforcement—the political lesson that the technicalities of a system of
law should be enforced. We can learn that the remedy for a defective law
is not wholesale violation but amendment.

So let us now as Christians use what influence we have to bring about
those changes in Government and in law that will be for the greatest
public good, remembering that good earthly government derives its power
from the just consent of the governed. Let us teach the public to vote
intelligently at every election, and to respect and obey the legal
technicalities of existing government while working for their
improvement. If we can thus educate the public to the intelligent use of
elections we shall render real service to the people of the United
States.
