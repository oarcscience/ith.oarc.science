### ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

In preparing this little study with the purpose of being both legally
accurate and theologically sound, I wish to make special acknowledgement
to Myrt A. Rollins, Jr., Esq., for permission to draw heavily upon
materials collected by his late grandfather Senator James M. Rollins; to
my office associate Oliver Blackinton, Esq., for kindly advice in some
legal questions and for reading the manuscript, and to my brother, Rev.
M. Edwards Breed, for great assistance in locating and collecting the
Christian sources, and reading and criticising the manuscript.

I am also thankful to Dr. Macartney for his very gracious "Foreword."

D. K. B.
