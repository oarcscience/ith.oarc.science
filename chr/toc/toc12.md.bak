### EPILOGUE—OUR REDEEMER

"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give
you rest." <span id="fr_129"></span>[129](#fn_129.md) Thus spoke Jesus of
Nazareth, the Christ of God, the Saviour of the world—who in His earthly
ministry never once used the word "religion." <span
id="fr_130"></span>[130](#fn_130.md) Christianity is not a religion; it is
a revelation.

The word "religion" comes from a Greek root meaning the act of man
searching out for God, pagan man trying to find God. But when Very God
became flesh and dwelt among us, revealed Himself in the person of
Christ, and died to save us from our sins, religion ceased for all
believers in Jesus. True, many laymen and ministers use the term
"Christian Religion" in a broad sense to embrace that which is actually
Christian Revelation. We could quote columns of the words of The Master,
and each would emphasize our point. During the trial before

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pilate, Jesus made
this startling statement: "Thou couldest have no power at all against
me, except it were given thee from above." <span
id="fr_131"></span>[131](#fn_131.md) To a thief on a neighboring cross who
confessed, He said: "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise." <span
id="fr_132"></span>[132](#fn_132.md) To His disciples; in that poignant
fourteenth chapter of John, Jesus discussed the heavenly mansions He has
gone to prepare for us, promised to return to take us there, and told us
that the Father dwelleth in him to do the works.

Who could make these startling promises? Could an imposter make them and
not be found out? What does the trial teach us of Our Redeemer? Did the
Jews prove Jesus an imposter? If the trial proved Jesus was an imposter,
why did Pilate have it inscribed on the cross, "THE KING OF THE
JEWS" <span id="fr_133"></span>[133](#fn_133.md) instead of, "He said he
was king of the Jews."?

The reason is that the Jews failed to see the true import of the trial.
This was not a trial of Christ by the Jews or by the Romans

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

for that matter. It was a trial of the whole world by God Himself in the
person of Christ, posing as a defendant, come to save the world, come in
fulfillment of prophecy, come to die as the Lamb of God—the Paschal,
sacrificial Lamb of God crucified to save men from their sins. The New
Testament record constitutes not only an accurate fulfillment of
prophecy, but its very words in some places quote the actual language of
the great Jewish prophets. The crowd did spit in his face. <span
id="fr_134"></span>[134](#fn_134.md) He was crucified between two
thieves <span id="fr_135"></span>[135](#fn_135.md) and reviled by the
crowd. <span id="fr_136"></span>[136](#fn_136.md) The trial did follow the
pattern of Isaiah 53. Jesus was trying the world. As the omnipotent Son
of God, co-equal with God, Jesus knew everything. He knew the law. He
had astonished the Rabbis with his legal knowledge when He was but
twelve years old. He had power to make a legal record, to take an
Appeal, to rely on the technicalities of the law, had He desired: but He
knew He had to die to save the sinful world of men—and He went
gloriously

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

to his death saying, "Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit." <span
id="fr_137"></span>[137](#fn_137.md)

No one can fully understand the technical legal violations of the Trial
of Christ and not be impressed again with the accuracy in which God in
His Grace has fulfilled such prophecies as that beautiful fifty-third
chapter of Isaiah with which we close our study:

"1. *Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD
revealed?*

2\. *For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root
out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall
see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him*.

3\. *He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and
acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was
despised, and we esteemed him not*.

4\. *Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we
did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted*.

5\. *But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
iniquities: the*

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

*chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are
healed*.

6\. *All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his
own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all*.

7\. *He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his
mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before
her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth*.

8\. *He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare
his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for
the transgression of my people was he stricken*.

9\. *And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his
death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his
mouth*.

10\. *Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief:
when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his
seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall
prosper in his hand*.

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

11\. *He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied:
by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall
bear their iniquities*.

12\. *Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall
divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul
unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the
sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors*."
