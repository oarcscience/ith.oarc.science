### CHAPTER IV

### REVERSIBLE ERRORS

"Reversible Error" is defined in modern law as "such an error as
warrants the appellate court in reversing the judgment and remanding the
cause." <span id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) For generations an error has
been held not reversible unless, at the time it was made, the party
against whom it was made, through his attorney, made specific objection
to the action of the trial court and saved a specific "exception" to the
ruling; but in 1943 Missouri abolished exceptions and provided in its
new Code for Civil Procedure that "it is sufficient that a party, at the
time the ruling of the Court is made or sought, makes known to the court
the action which he desires the court to take or his objection to the
action of the court and his grounds therefor; and if a party has no
opportunity to object to a ruling or order at the time it is made, the
absence of an objection does not thereafter prejudice him." <span
id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md)

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The said Code,
Section 140, goes on to say that "No Appellate court shall reverse any
judgment, unless it believes that error was committed by the trial court
against appellant, <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) and materially
affecting the merits of the action." <span id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md)
Exceptions still have to be saved in criminal causes in Missouri, and
from a purely technical standpoint there may have been no reversible
error in the Trial of Christ, merely because Jesus saved no exceptions,
made no objection,—"opened not his mouth." <span
id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md) The only statements Jesus did make were
in the nature of admissions of His power. <span
id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md)

**IF**, however, errors had been pointed out to the trial courts—Annas,
Caiaphas, The Sanhedrin, Pilate and Herod—then IF an appeal had been
had, Jesus would have been able to assign seventeen errors in the
trials. <span id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md)

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> We shall note
these errors here and annotate them in the footnotes, before passing on
to discuss the trials in detail.

These errors are:

1\. *No process could take place on the Jewish Sabbath or on feast
days*. <span id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13.md)

2\. *No process could be started at night or even afternoon for a trial
before a regular Sanhedrin court*. <span id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md)

3\. *It was error for Caiaphas, acting as Judge, to have sought words
from the mouth of Christ upon which to convict Him, without first making
a prima-facie case with other witnesses*. <span
id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md)

4\. *Caiaphas’ Palace was not the meeting place of the Sanhedrin: it was
error to hold a trial there*. <span id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md)

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

5\. *It was error for Caiaphas to have acted as Judge after having
publicly declared that Christ deserved death*. <span
id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md)

6\. *It was error to have left Him unguarded, to the unrestrained
license of the mob in the gallery of Caiaphas’ palace or court for an
hour or more*. <span id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md)

7\. *The Sanhedrin had no jurisdiction in Capital Cases, having been
divested of that jurisdiction by the Romans forty years before*. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md)

8\. *The Sanhedrin, if existent, had no power except at a regular
meeting*. <span id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md)

9\. *It was error not to appoint someone to defend Him—Jesus had no
counsel*. <span id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md)

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

10\. *It was error not to have "warned" the witnesses in this capital
case, in a Sanhedrin court*. <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md)

11\. *The courts erred by not taking into consideration the guilt or
innocence of Jesus*. <span id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md)

12\. *It was error to take Christ, as prisoner, before Annas*. <span
id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md)

13\. *In modern times it would have been error to require Christ to
testify y as a witness against Himself*, <span
id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) *but in those days in a trial for
Blasphemy there seems to have been authority in favor of requiring what
we know as "self incrimination"* <span
id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md)—*this will be discussed in detail in a
later chapter*.

14\. *Roman Law required trials to be public, and the private trial of
Christ before Annas and Caiaphas was error*. <span
id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md)

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

15\. *It was error to convict a man on the testimony of false
witnesses;* <span id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md)—*under modern law the
Jury determines the credibility of the Witnesses*. <span
id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md)

16\. *Pilate having announced Jesus not guilty, erred in permitting the
verdict of the "mob" to stand. <span id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) The
record shows Christ, after Pilate found "no harm" in Him*, <span
id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) *was sent to Herod, then back to Pilate,
then turned over to be crucified*.

17\. *It was unlawful and therefore error for the Sanhedrin to convict
on the same day as the trial; they could acquit the same day but had to
hold a verdict of "guilty" under advisement at least two days*. <span
id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md)

<span id="fn_15"></span>[40:16](toc07.htm#fr_15.md) Some authorities
dispute this assertion in Blasphemy cases where the witness would become
guilty upon testifying; see discussion infra, next chapter.

II, p. 556; Drucker, op. cit., p. 8.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[41:18](toc07.htm#fr_17.md) This point is also in
dispute, as we discuss in next chapter, because a desire for Jesus death
may not be an opinion that He was guilty of Blasphemy; see, John 11:50;
Drucker, op. cit., p. 7; Chandler, op. cit., I, 238; Chandler says there
ought to have been several judges; MISHNA Pirke Aboth, IV, 8.

had power over capital offenses at various times but scholars differ on
this point; cf., Drucker, op. cit., p. 5; Chandler, op. cit., I, 176
ff., points out that although Herod had put 45 members of the Sanhedrin
to death about 30 A.D., the Sanhedrin did exist and had power; see also,
