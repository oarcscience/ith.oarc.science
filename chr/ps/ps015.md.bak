### CHAPTER 11

<span class="margnote">Jesus putteth on his vesture.</span>"It came to
pass then, when I saw the mystery of all these words in the vesture
which was sent me, that straightway I clothed myself therewith, and I
shone most exceedingly and soared into the height.

<span class="margnote">He entereth the firmament.</span>"I came before
the \[first\] gate of the firmament, shining most exceedingly, and there
was no measure for the light which was about me, and the gates of the
firmament were shaken one over against another and all opened at once.

<span class="margnote">The powers of the firmament are amazed and fall
down and adore him.</span>"And all rulers and all authorities and all
angels therein were thrown all together into agitation because of the
great light which was on me. And they gazed at the radiant vesture of

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

light with which I was clad, and they saw the mystery which contains
their names, \|<span class="rmargnote">**21**.</span> and they feared
most exceedingly. And all their bonds with which they were bound, were
unloosed and every one left his order, and they all fell down before me,
adored and said: 'How hath the lord of the universe passed through us
without our knowing?' And they all sang praises together to the
interiors of the interiors; but me they saw not, but they saw only the
light. And they were in great fear and were exceedingly agitated and
sang praises to the interiors of the interiors.
