### CHAPTER 77

"It came to pass then, when that time came on,--and I was in the world
of men, \|<span class="rmargnote">**170**.</span> sitting with you in
this region, which is the Mount of Olives,--that Adamas looked down out
of the twelve æons and looked down at the regions of the chaos and saw
his demon power which is in the chaos, that no light at all was in it,
because I had taken its light from it; and he saw it, that it was dark
and<span class="margnote">Adamas sendeth forth two emanations of
darkness to plague Sophia.</span> could not go to his region, that is to
the twelve moons. Thereon Adamas again remembered Pistis Sophia and
became most exceedingly wroth against her, thinking that it was she who
had imprisoned his power in the chaos, and thinking that it was she who
had taken its light from it. And he was exceedingly embittered; he piled
wrath on wrath and emanated out of himself a dark emanation and another,
chaotic and evil, the violent \[one\], so as through them to harass
Pistis Sophia. And he made a dark region in his region, so as to
constrain Sophia therein. And he took many of his rulers; they pursued
after Sophia, in order that the two dark emanations which Adamas had
emanated, might lead her into the dark chaos which he had made, and
constrain her in that region and harass her, until they should take her
whole light from her, and Adamas should take the light from Pistis
Sophia and give it to the two dark violent emanations, and they should
carry it to the great chaos which is below and dark, \|<span
class="rmargnote">**171**.</span> and cast it into his dark power which
is chaotic, if perchance it might be able to come to his

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

region, because it had become exceedingly dark, for I had taken its
light-power from it.

"It came to pass then, when they pursued after Pistis Sophia, that she
cried out again and sang praises to the Light, since I had said unto
her: 'If thou shalt be constrained and singest praises unto me, I will
come quickly and help thee.' It came to pass then, when she was
constrained,--and I sat with you in this region, that is on the Mount of
Olives,--that she sang praises to the Light, saying:

<span class="margnote">Sophia again singeth a song to the
Light.</span>"'1. O Light of lights, I have had faith in thee. Save me
from all these rulers who pursue after me, and help me,

"'2. That in sooth they may never take from me my light, as the
lion-faced power \[did\]. For thy light is not with me and thy
light-stream to save me. Nay, Adamas is the more enraged against me,
saying unto me: Thou hast imprisoned my power in the chaos.

"'3. Now, therefore, O Light of lights, if I have done this and have
imprisoned it, if I have done any injustice at all to that power,

"'4. Or if I have constrained it, as it hath constrained me, then let
all these rulers who pursue after me, take my light from me and leave me
empty;

"'5. And let foe Adamas pursue after my power and seize upon it and take
my light from me and cast it into his dark power which is in the chaos,
and keep my power in the chaos.

"'6. Now, therefore, O Light, lay hold on me in thy wrath and lift up
thy power above my foes who have lifted themselves up against me to the
very end.

"'7. Quicken me quickly, as thou hast said unto me: I will help thee.'
