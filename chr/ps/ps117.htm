<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the ascension after death of the good soul that hath received the mysteries.</FONT></span>Jesus continued again in the discourse and said: "If on the contrary it is a soul which hath not hearkened unto the counterfeiting spirit in all its works, but hath become good and hath received the mysteries of the Light which are in the second space or even those which are in the third space which is within, when the time [of the coming-forth] of that soul out of the body is completed, then the counterfeiting spirit followeth that soul, it and the destiny; and</p>  
<p><a name="page_239"><font size="1" color="green">p. 239</font></A></p>  
<p>it followeth it on the way on which it will go above.</p>  
<p>"And before it removeth itself above, it uttereth the mystery of the undoing of the seals and all the bonds of the counterfeiting spirit with which the rulers have bound it to the soul; and when it is uttered, the bonds of the counterfeiting spirit undo themselves, and it ceaseth to come into that soul and releaseth the soul according to the commandments which |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>287</b>.</FONT></span> the rulers of the great Fate have commanded it, saying: 'Release not this soul until it tell thee the mystery of the undoing of all the seals with which we have bound thee to the soul.'</p>  
<p>"If then the soul shall have uttered the mystery of the undoing of the seals and of all the bonds of the counterfeiting spirit, and if it ceaseth to come into the soul and ceaseth to be bound to it, then it uttereth in that moment a mystery and releaseth the destiny to its region to the rulers who are on the way of the midst. And it uttereth the mystery and releaseth the counterfeiting spirit to the rulers of the Fate to the region in which it was bound to it.</p>  
<p>"And in that moment it becometh a great light-stream, shining exceedingly, and the retributive receivers who have led it forth out of the body, are afraid of the light of that soul and fall on their faces. And in that moment that soul becometh a great light-stream, it becometh entirely wings of light, and penetrateth all the regions of the rulers and all the orders of the Light, until it reacheth the region of its kingdom up to which it hath received mysteries.</p>  
<p>"If on the other hand it is a soul which hath</p>  
<p><a name="page_240"><font size="1" color="green">p. 240</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the state after death of one who hath received the mysteries, and yet hath transgressed.</FONT></span>received mysteries in the first space which is without, and if after it |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>288</b>.</FONT></span> hath received the mysteries it hath accomplished them, it [then] turneth and committeth sin after the accomplishing of the mysteries, and if the time of the coming-forth of that soul is completed, then the retributive receivers come to lead that soul out of the body.</p>  
<p>"And the destiny and the counterfeiting spirit follow that soul. Because the counterfeiting spirit is bound to it with the seals and the bonds of the rulers, it followeth thus that soul which travelleth on the ways with the counterfeiting spirit.</p>  
<p>"It uttereth the mystery of the undoing of all the bonds and all the seals with which the rulers have bound the counterfeiting spirit to the soul. And when the soul uttereth the mystery of the undoing of the seals, straightway the bonds of the seals which are bound in the counterfeiting spirit to the soul undo themselves. And when the soul uttereth the mystery of the undoing of the seals, straightway the counterfeiting spirit undoeth itself and ceaseth to be assigned to the soul. And in that moment the soul uttereth a mystery and restraineth the counterfeiting spirit and the destiny and dischargeth them which follow it. But no one of them is in its power; |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>289</b>.</FONT></span> but it is in their power.</p>  
<p>"And in that moment the receivers of that soul come with the mysteries which it hath received, come and snatch that soul out of the hands of the retributive receivers, and the [latter] receivers go back to the works of the rulers for the purpose of the economy of the leading-forth of the souls.</p>  
<p><a name="page_241"><font size="1" color="green">p. 241</font></A></p>  
<p>"And the receivers of that soul on the other hand who belong to the Light, become wings of light for that soul and become vestures of light for it and they do not lead it into the chaos, because it is not lawful to lead into the chaos souls which have received mysteries, but they lead it on the way of the rulers of the midst. And when it reacheth the rulers of the midst, those rulers meet the soul, they being in great fear and violent fire and with different faces, in a word in great immeasurable fear.</p>  
<p>"And in that moment the soul uttereth the mystery of their apology. And they are exceedingly afraid and fall on their faces, being in fear of the mystery which it hath uttered, and of their apology. |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>290</b>.</FONT></span> And that soul surrendereth their destiny, saying unto them: Take your destiny!<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The apology of the rulers of the ways of the midst.</FONT></span> I come not to your regions from this moment onwards. I have become a stranger unto you for ever, being about to go unto the region of my inheritance.</p>  
<p>"And when the soul shall have said this, the receivers of the Light fly with it on high and lead it into the &aelig;ons of the Fate, it giving every region its apology and its seals,--which I will tell you at the expansion of the universe. And it giveth the counterfeiting spirit to the rulers and telleth them the mystery of the bonds with which it is bound to it, and sayeth unto them: There have<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The apology of the rulers of the Fate.</FONT></span> ye your counterfeiting spirit! I come not to your region from this moment onwards. I have become a stranger unto you for ever. And it giveth every one his seal and his apology.</p>  
<p>"And when the soul shall have said this, the receivers of the Light fly with it on high and lead</p>  
<p><a name="page_242"><font size="1" color="green">p. 242</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the ascension of that soul into the Inheritance.</FONT></span>it |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>291</b>.</FONT></span> out of the &aelig;ons of the Fate and lead it up into all the &aelig;ons [above], it giving to every region its apology and the apology of all the regions and the seals to the tyrants of the king, the Adamas. And it giveth the apology of all the rulers of all the regions of the Left,--whose collective apologies and seals I will one day tell you when I shall tell you the expansion of the universe.</p>  
<p>"And moreover those receivers lead that soul to the Virgin of Light and that soul giveth the Virgin of Light the seals and the glory of the songs of praise. And the Virgin of Light and also the seven other virgins of the Light together prove that soul and find together their signs in it and their seals and their baptisms and their chrism. And the Virgin of Light |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>292</b>.</FONT></span> sealeth that soul and the receivers of the Light baptize that soul and give it the spiritual chrism; and every one of the virgins of the Light sealeth it with her seals.</p>  
<p>"And moreover the receivers of the Light hand it over to the great Saba&#333;th, the Good, who is at the gate of the Life in the region of those of the Right, who is called 'Father.' And that soul giveth him the glory of his songs of praise and his seals and his apologies. And Saba&#333;th, the Great and Good, sealeth it with his seals. And the soul giveth its science and the glory of the songs of praise and the seals to the whole region of those of the Right. They all seal it with their seals; and Melchisedec, the great Receiver of the Light who is in the region of those of the Right, sealeth that soul and all the receivers of Melchisedec seal that soul and lead it into the Treasury of the Light.</p>  
<p>"And it giveth the glory and the honour and</p>  
<p><a name="page_243"><font size="1" color="green">p. 243</font></A></p>  
<p>the laud of the songs of praise and. all the seals of all the regions of the Light. And all those of the region of the Treasury of the Light seal it with their seals and it goeth unto the region of the Inheritance."</p>
