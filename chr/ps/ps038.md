### CHAPTER 34

It came to pass then, when Mary had finished speaking these words unto
Jesus in the midst of the disciples, that she said unto him: "My Lord,
this is the solution of the mystery of the repentance of Pistis
Sophia."\|<span class="rmargnote">**56**.</span>

It came to pass then, when Jesus had heard Mary speak these words, that
he said unto her: "Well said, Mary, blessed one, the fulness, or
all-blessed fulness, thou who shalt be sung of as blessed in all
generations."
