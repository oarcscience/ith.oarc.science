<p>And when the Saviour had said this, he said unto his disciples: "Understand ye in what manner I speak with you?"</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Mary interpreteth the same from a former saying.</FONT></span>Mary answered |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>308</b>.</FONT></span> and said: "I have seized on the words which thou hast said. Now, therefore, my Lord, this is the word which thou hast said: 'They who shall receive the mysteries of the Ineffable,--blessed indeed are those souls;</p>  
<p>but if they turn, transgress, and cease in their faith, and if they go forth out of the body without having repented, they are no more fit from this hour onwards to return to the changes of the body, nor for anything at all, but they are cast out into the outer darkness, they will perish in that region and be non-existent for ever,'--concerning [this] word thou hast spoken unto us aforetime, saying: 'Salt is good; but if the salt becometh sterile, with what are they to salt it? It is fit neither for the dunghill nor for the earth; but they throw it away,'--that is: Blessed are all the souls which shall receive of the mysteries of the Ineffable; but if they once transgress, they are not fit to return to the body henceforth from this hour onwards nor for anything at all, but they are cast into the outer darkness and perish in that region."</p>  
<p>And when she had said this, the Saviour said: "Well said, thou spiritual light-pure Mary. This is the solution of the word."</p>  
<p>And Mary continued again |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>309</b>.</FONT></span> and said: "My Lord, all men who have received the mysteries of the First Mystery and the mysteries of the Ineffable, those who have not transgressed, but</p>  
<p><a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="green">p. 256</font></A></p>  
<p>whose faith in the mysteries was in sincerity, without play-acting,--they then have again sinned through the compulsion of the Fate and have again turned and repented and again prayed in any of the mysteries, how often will it be forgiven them?"</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the unending compassion of the great mysteries for the repentant.</FONT></span>And the Saviour answered and said unto Mary in the midst of his disciples: "Am&#275;n, am&#275;n, I say unto you: All men who shall receive the mysteries of the Ineffable and moreover the mysteries of the First Mystery, sin every time through the compulsion of the Fate, and if they, when they are still in life, turn and repent and abide in any of their mysteries, it will be forgiven them at every time, because those mysteries are compassionate and forgiving for all time. For this cause then have I said unto you before: Those mysteries will not only forgive them their sins which they have committed from the beginning onwards, but they do not impute them to them from this hour onwards,--of which I have said unto you that they receive repentance at any time, and that they also will forgive the sins which they commit anew.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the unrepentant.</FONT></span>"If on the other hand those who shall receive mysteries of |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>310</b>.</FONT></span> the mystery of the Ineffable and of the mysteries of the First Mystery, turn and sin and come out of the body without having repented, then they will be even as those will be who have transgressed and not repented. Their dwelling also is in the midst of the jaws of the dragon of the outer darkness and they will perish and be non-existent for ever. For this cause have I said unto you: All men who shall receive the mysteries, if they knew the time when they come</p>  
<p><a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="green">p. 257</font></A></p>  
<p>out of the body, would watch themselves and not sin, in order that they may inherit the Light-kingdom for ever."</p>
