### CHAPTER 14

<span class="margnote">He entereth the æons.</span>"And I left that
region behind me and ascended to the great æons of the rulers and came
before their veils and their gates, shining most exceedingly, and there
was no measure for the light which was about me. It came to pass then,
when I arrived at the twelve æons, that their veils and their gates were
shaken one over against the other. Their veils drew themselves apart of
their own accord, and their gates opened one

over against the other. And I entered into the æons, shining most
exceedingly, and there was no measure for the light that was about me,
forty-and-nine times more than the light with which I shone in the
houses of the Fate.

<span class="margnote">The powers of the æons are amazed and fall down
and adore him.</span>"And all the angels of the æons and their
archangels and their rulers and their gods and their lords and their
authorities and their tyrants and their powers and their light-sparks
and their light-givers and their unpaired and their invisibles and their
forefathers and their triple-powers saw me, shining most exceedingly,
and there was no measure for the light which was about me. And they were
thrown into agitation the one over against the other and great fear fell
upon them, when they saw the great light that was about me. And in their
great agitation and their great fear they withdrew as far as \|<span
class="rmargnote">**24**.</span> the region of the great invisible
Forefather, and of the three great triple-powers. And because of the
great fear of their agitation, the great Forefather, he and the three
triple-powers, kept on running hither and thither in his region, and
they could not close all their regions because of the great fear in
which they were. And they agitated all their æons together and all their
spheres and all their orders, fearing and being greatly agitated because
of the great light which was about me--not of the former quality that it
was about me when I was on the earth of man-kind, when the light-vesture
came over me,--for the world could not bear the light such as it was in
its truth, else would the world at once be destroyed and all upon
it,--but the light which was about me in the twelve æons was

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

eight-thousand-and-seven-hundred-myriad times greater than that which
was about me in the world among you.
