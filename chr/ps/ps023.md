### CHAPTER 19

It came to pass then, when Mary had finished saying these words, that he
said: "Well said, Mary, for thou art blessed before all women on the
earth, \|<span class="rmargnote">**29**.</span> because thou shalt be
the fulness of all fulnesses and the perfection of all perfections."

<span class="margnote">Jesus commendeth Mary. She further questioneth
him on the changing of the spheres.</span>Now when Mary had heard the
Saviour speak these words, she exulted greatly, and she came before
Jesus, fell down before him, adored his feet and said unto him: "My
Lord, hearken unto me, that I may question thee on this word, before
that thou discoursest with us about the regions whither thou didst go."

Jesus answered and said unto Mary: "Discourse in openness and fear not;
all things on which thou questionest, I will reveal unto thee."
