### CHAPTER 80

Martha again came forward and said: "My Lord, \|<span
class="rmargnote">**175**.</span> I am sober in my spirit and understand
the words which thou sayest. Now, therefore, give me commandment to set
forth their solution in openness."

And the First Mystery answered and said unto Martha: "I give thee
commandment, Martha, to set forth the solution of the words which Pistis
Sophia hath uttered in her song."

And Martha answered and said: "My Lord, these are the words which thy
light-power hath prophesied aforetime through David in the seventh
Psalm, saying:

"'12. God is a righteous vindicator and strong and long-suffering, who
bringeth not on his wrath every day.

<span class="margnote">Martha interpreteth the words of Sophia from
Psalm vii.</span>"'13. If ye turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath
bent his bow and made it ready.

"'14. And he hath made ready for him instruments of death; he hath made
his arrows for those who will be burnt up.

"'15. Behold, injustice hath been in labour, hath conceived wrong and
brought forth iniquity.

"'16. It hath digged a pit and hollowed it out. It will fall into the
hole which it hath made.

"'17. Its wrong will return on its own head, and its injustice will come
down on its pate.'"

When Martha had said this, the First Mystery which looketh without, said
unto her: "Well said, finely, Martha, blessed \[one\]."
