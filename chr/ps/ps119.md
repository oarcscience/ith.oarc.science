### CHAPTER 114

It came to pass then, when Jesus had heard Mary say these words, that he
said: "Well said, all-blessed Mary, spiritual \[one\]. These are the
solutions of the words which I have spoken."

<span class="margnote">Mary continueth to question Jesus.</span>Mary
answered and said: "Still, my Lord, do I question thee, because from now
on I will begin to question thee on all things with sureness. For this
cause, therefore, my Lord, be patient with us and reveal unto us all
things on which we shall question thee for the sake of the manner, how
my brethren are to herald it to the whole race of men."

And when she had said this to the Saviour,

the Saviour answered and said unto her in great compassion towards her:
"Amēn, amēn, I say unto you: Not only will I reveal unto you all things
on which ye shall question me, but from now on I will reveal unto you
other things on which ye have not thought to question, which have not
entered into the heart of man, and which also all the gods, who are
below man, know not. Now, therefore, Mary, question on what thou mayest
question, and I will reveal it unto thee face to face without
similitude."
