### CHAPTER 4

But the disciples sat together in fear and were in exceedingly great
agitation and were afraid because of the great earthquake which took
place, and they wept together, saying: "What will then be? Peradventure
the Saviour will destroy all regions?" Thus saying, they wept together.

<span class="margnote">Jesus deseendeth again.</span>While they then
said this and wept together, then, on the ninth hour of the morrow, the
heavens opened, and they saw Jesus descend, shining most exceedingly,
and there was no measure for his light in which he was. For he shone
more \[radiantly\] than at the hour when he had ascended to the heavens,
so that men in the world cannot describe the light which was on him; and
it shot forth light-rays in great abundance, and there was no measure
for its rays, and its light was not alike together, but it was of divers
kind and of divers type, some \[rays\] being more excellent than others
. . .; and the whole light consisted together.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span
class="margnote">The nature of his glory</span>It was of threefold kind,
and the one \[kind\] was more excellent than the other. . . . The
second, that in the midst, was more excellent than the first which was
below, and the third, which was above them all, was more excellent than
the two which were below. And the first glory, which was placed below
them all, was like to the light which had come over Jesus before he had
ascended \|<span class="rmargnote">**8**.</span> into the heavens, and
was like only itself in its light. And the three light-modes were of
divers light-kinds, and they were of divers type, one being more
excellent than the other. . . .
