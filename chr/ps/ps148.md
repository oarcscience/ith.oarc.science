### CHAPTER 143

<span class="margnote">Of three other mystic rites.</span>Thereafter his
disciples said unto him: "Rabbi, reveal unto us the mystery of the Light
of thy father, since we heard thee say: 'There is still a fire-baptism
and there is still a baptism of the holy spirit of the Light, and there
is \|<span class="rmargnote">**378**.</span> a spiritual chrism; these
lead the souls into the Treasury of the Light.' Tell us, therefore,
their mystery, so that we ourselves may inherit the kingdom of thy
father."

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

<span class="margnote">Of the highest mysteries and of the great
name.</span>Jesus said unto them: "There is no mystery which is more
excellent than these mysteries on which ye question, in that it will
lead your souls into the Light of the lights, into the regions of Truth
and Goodness, into the region of the Holy of all holies, into the region
in which there is neither female nor male, nor are there forms in that
region, but a perpetual indescribable Light. Nothing more excellent is
there, therefore, than these mysteries on which ye question, save only

darkness nor authority nor ruler of the Fate-sphere nor angel nor
archangel nor power can hold down the soul which knoweth that name; but
if it cometh out of the world and sayeth that name to the fire, it is
quenched and the darkness withdraweth.

"And if it sayeth it to the demons \|<span

darkness and their rulers and their authorities and their powers, they
will all sink down and their flame will burn and they will cry out:
'Holy, holy art thou, most holy of all holies.'

"And if one sayeth that name to the receivers of the wicked
chastisements and their authorities and all their powers and also to
Barbēlō and the invisible god and the three triple-powered gods,
straightway if one will say this name in those regions, they will all
fall one on another, will be undone and destroyed and cry out: 'O Light

of all lights, which is in the boundless lights, remember us and purify
us.'"

And when Jesus had finished saying these words, all his disciples cried
out, wept with loud sobbing, saying: . . .
