### CHAPTER 78

It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had finished saying these
words unto the disciples, that he said: "Who hath understood the words
which I have spoken, let him come forward and set forth their solution."

James came forward and said: "My Lord, concerning this song which Pistis
Sophia hath sung, thus thy light-power hath prophesied aforetime through
David in the seventh Psalm:

<span class="margnote">James interpreteth the song from Psalm
vii.</span>"'1. O Lord, my God, in thee have I hoped. Free me from my
pursuers and save me,

"'2. That in sooth he may never steal away my soul as a lion, without
any one to deliver and save.

"'3. O Lord, my God, if I have done this, if injustice is on my hands,

"'4. If I have requited those who requite me with evil, then let me fall
down empty through my foes.

"'5. And let the foe pursue after my soul and seize it, and trample my
life to the ground and lay my honour in the dust. (Selah.)

"'6. Arise, O Lord, in thy wrath, raise thyself up for the end of my
foes.

"'7. Arise according to the commandment which thou hast commanded.'"

It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had heard James speak these
words, that he said: "Well said, James, beloved."
