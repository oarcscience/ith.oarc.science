<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The disciples bewail the fate of sinners.</FONT></span>And when the Saviour had said this unto Mary, she smote her breast, she cried out and wept, she and all the disciples together, and said: "Woe unto sinners, for their chastisements are exceedingly numerous!"</p>  
<p>Mary came forward, she fell down at the feet of Jesus, kissed them and said: "My Lord, bear with me if I question thee, and be not wroth with me, that I trouble thee oft; for from now on I will begin to question thee on all things with determination."</p>  
<p>The Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "Question concerning all things on which thou desirest to question, and I will reveal them unto thee in openness without similitude."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Mary further questioneth Jesus.</FONT></span>Mary answered and said: "My Lord, if a good man hath accomplished all the mysteries and he hath a kinsman, in a word he hath a man, and that man is an impious [one] who hath committed all sins and is deserving of the outer darkness, and he hath not repented, or he hath completed his number of circuits in the changes of the body, and that man hath done nothing useful,</p>  
<p><a name="page_270"><font size="1" color="green">p. 270</font></A></p>  
<p>and he hath come out of. the body, and we have known certainly of him, that he hath sinned |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>326</b>.</FONT></span> and is deserving of the outer darkness,--what are we to do with him, to save him from the chastisements of the dragon of the outer darkness, and that he may be removed into a righteous body which shall find the mysteries of the Light-kingdom, in order that it may be good and go on high and inherit the Light-kingdom?"</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">How to save the souls of sinners.</FONT></span>The Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "If a sinner is deserving of the outer darkness, or hath sinned according to the chastisements of the rest of the chastisements and hath not repented, or a sinning man who hath completed his number of circuits in the changes of the body and hath not repented,--if then these men of whom I have spoken, shall come out of the body and be led into the outer darkness, now, therefore, if ye desire to remove them out of the chastisements of the outer darkness and all the judgments and to remove them into a righteous body which shall find the mysteries of the Light, that it may go on high and inherit the Light-kingdom,--then perform this same mystery of the Ineffable which forgiveth sins at every time, and when ye have finished performing the mystery then say:</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">A summary of the formul&aelig;.</FONT></span>"The soul of such or such a man of whom I think in my heart,--if it is in the region of the chastisements of the dungeons of the outer darkness, or if it is in the rest of the chastisements of the dungeons of the outer darkness and in the rest of the chastisements |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>327</b>.</FONT></span> of the dragons,--then is it to be removed out of them all. And if it hath completed its number of its circuits of the changes,</p>  
<p><a name="page_271"><font size="1" color="green">p. 271</font></A></p>  
<p>then is it to be led before the Virgin of Light, and the Virgin of Light is to seal it with the seal of the Ineffable and cast it down in whatever month into a righteous body which shall find the mysteries of the Light, so that it may be good, go on high and inherit the Light-kingdom. And moreover if it hath completed the circuits of changes, then is that soul to be led before the seven virgins of the Light who [are set] over the baptisms, and they are to apply them to the soul and seal it with the sign of the kingdom of the Ineffable and lead it into the orders of the Light.</p>  
<p>"This then will ye say when ye perform the mystery.</p>  
<p>"Am&#275;n, I say unto you: The soul for which ye shall pray, if it indeed is in the dragon of the outer darkness, he will draw his tail out of his mouth and let go that soul. And moreover if it is in all the regions of the judgments of the rulers, am&#275;n, I say unto you: The receivers of Melchisedec will with haste snatch it away, whether the dragon let it go or it is in the judgments of the rulers; in a word, the receivers of Melchisedec |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>328</b>.</FONT></span> will snatch it away out of all the regions in which it is, and will lead it into the region of the Midst before the Virgin of Light, and the Virgin of Light proveth it and seeth the sign of the kingdom of the Ineffable which is on that soul.</p>  
<p>"And if it hath not yet completed its number of circuits in the changes of the soul, or [in the changes] of the body, the Virgin of Light sealeth it with an excellent seal and hasteth to have it cast down in any month into a righteous body which shall find the mysteries of the Light, be good and go on high into the Light-kingdom.</p>  
<p><a name="page_272"><font size="1" color="green">p. 272</font></A></p>  
<p>"And if that soul hath had its number of the circuits, then the Virgin of Light proveth it, and doth not have it chastized, because it hath had its number of circuits, but handeth it over to the seven virgins of the Light. And the seven virgins of the Light prove that soul, baptize it with their baptisms and give it the spiritual chrism and lead it into the Treasury of the Light and put it in the last order of the Light until the ascension of all the perfect souls. And when they prepare to draw apart the veils of the region of those of the Right, they cleanse that soul anew and purify it and put it in the orders of the first saviour who [is] in the |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>329</b>.</FONT></span> Treasury of the Light."</p>
