### CHAPTER 24

<span class="margnote">Mary questioneth him again.</span>It came to pass
then, when Jesus had finished saying these words unto his disciples,
that Mary, the fair in her discourse and the blessed one, came forward,
fell at the feet of Jesus and said: "My Lord, suffer me that I speak
before thee, and be \|<span class="rmargnote">**34**.</span> not wroth
with me, if oft I give thee trouble questioning thee."

The Saviour, full of compassion, answered and said unto Mary: "Speak the
word which thou willest, and I will reveal it to thee in all openness."

Mary answered and said unto Jesus: "My Lord, in what way will the souls
have delayed themselves here outside, and in what type will they be
quickly purified?"
