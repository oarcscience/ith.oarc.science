### CHAPTER 123

Mary continued again and said unto the Saviour: "My Lord, a man who hath
received mysteries and hath not done what is worthy of

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

them, but he hath turned and hath sinned, thereafter he hath again
repented and hath been in great repentance,--is it then lawful for my
brethren to renew for him the mystery which he hath received, or \|<span
class="rmargnote">**314**.</span> rather give him a mystery out of the
lower mysteries,--is it lawful, or not?"

<span class="margnote">In the case of repentance only higher mysteries
than those previously received can remit sins.</span>The Saviour
answered and said unto Mary: "Amēn, amēn, I say unto you: Neither the
mystery which he hath received, nor the lower hearken unto him, to
forgive his sins; but it is the mysteries which are higher than those
which he hath received, which hearken unto him and forgive his sins.
Now, therefore, Mary, let thy brethren give him the mystery which is
higher than that which he hath received, and they are to accept his
repentance from him and forgive his sins,--the latter indeed, because he
hath received it once more, and the former, because he hath towered over
them \[the lower mysteries\] upward,--the latter indeed hearkeneth not
unto him to forgive his sin; but it is the mystery which is higher than
that which he hath received, that forgiveth his sins. But if on the
other hand he hath received the three mysteries in the two spaces or in
the third from within, and he hath turned and transgressed, no mystery
hearkeneth unto him to help him in his repentance, neither the higher
nor the lower, save the mystery of the First Mystery and the mysteries
of the Ineffable,--it is they which hearken unto him and accept his
repentance from him."

Mary answered and said: "My Lord, a man who hath received mysteries up
to two or three \|<span class="rmargnote">**315**.</span> in the second
or third space, and he hath not transgressed, but is still in his faith
in uprightness

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

and without play-acting, \[what will befall him\]?"

<span class="margnote">There is no limit to the number of mysteries the
faithful may receive.</span>And the Saviour answered and said unto Mary:
"Every man who hath received mysteries in the second and in the third
space, and hath not transgressed, but is still in his faith without
play-acting, it is lawful for such an one to receive mysteries in the
space which pleaseth him, from the first to the last, because they have
not transgressed."
