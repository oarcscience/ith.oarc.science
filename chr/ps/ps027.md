### CHAPTER 23

<span class="margnote">Why the path of the æons was changed</span>And
Jesus answered and said unto Philip and to all the disciples together:
"I have \|<span class="rmargnote">**33**.</span> changed their path for
the salvation of all souls. Amēn, amēn, I say unto you If I had not
changed their path, a host of souls would have been destroyed, and they
would have spent a long time, if the rulers of the æons and the rulers
of

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

the Fate and of the sphere and of all their regions and all their
heavens and all their æons had not been brought to naught; and the souls
would have continued a long time here outside, and the completion of the
number of perfect souls would have been delayed, which \[souls\] shall
be counted in the Inheritance of the Height through the mysteries and
shall be in the Treasury of the Light. For this cause then I have
changed their path, that they might be deluded and fall into agitation
and yield up the power which is in the matter of their world and which
they fashion into souls, in order that those who shall be saved, might
be quickly purified and raised on high, they and the whole power, and
that those who shall not be saved, might be quickly destroyed."
