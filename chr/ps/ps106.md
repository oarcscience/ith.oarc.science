### CHAPTER 101

### \[THE CONCLUSION OF ANOTHER BOOK\]

<span class="margnote">Of the Limbs of the Ineffable.</span>"AND those
who are worthy of the mysteries which abide in the Ineffable, which are
those which have not gone forth,--these exist before the First Mystery,
and to use a likeness and similitude, that ye may understand it, they
are as the Limbs of the Ineffable. And every one existeth according to
the dignity of its glory: the head according

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

to the dignity of the head and the eye according to the dignity \|<span
class="rmargnote">**253**.</span> of the eyes and the ear according to
the dignity of the ears and the rest of the Limbs \[in like fashion\];
so that the matter is manifest: There is a multitude of limbs but one
only body. Of this indeed have I spoken in a pattern and similitude and
likeness, but not in a form in truth; nor have I revealed the word in
truth, but the mystery \[only\] of the Ineffable.

<span class="margnote">The Saviour is their treasury.</span>"And all the
Limbs which are in it,--according to the word with which I have made
comparison,--that is, those which abide on the mystery of the Ineffable,
and those which abide in it, and also the three spaces which are after
them according to the mysteries,--of all these in truth and verity I am
their treasury beside whom there is no other treasury, who hath not his
like in the world; but there are still words and mysteries and other
regions.

<span class="margnote">Of the dignity of those who have received the
mysteries.</span>"Now, therefore, blessed is he who hath found the
\[words of the\] mysteries \[of the first space\] which is from without;
and he is a god who hath found these words of the mysteries of the
second space, which is in the midst; and he is a saviour and an
uncontainable who hath found the words of the mysteries of the third
space, which is within, and he is more excellent than the universe and
like unto those who are in that third space. Because he hath found the
mystery in which they are and in which they stand,--\|<span
class="rmargnote">**254**.</span> for this cause, therefore, is he like
unto them. He on the other hand who hath found the words of the
mysteries which I have described unto you according to a likeness, that
they are the Limbs of the Ineffable,--amēn, I say unto you: That man who
hath

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

found the words of these mysteries in divine truth, is the first in
truth and like unto him \[*sc.* the First, i.e. the Ineffable\], for
through those words and mysteries . . . and the universe itself standeth
through that First. For this cause he who hath found the words of those
mysteries, is like unto the First. For it is the gnosis of the gnosis of
the Ineffable concerning which I have discoursed with you this day."
