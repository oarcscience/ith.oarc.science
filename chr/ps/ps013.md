### CHAPTER 9

It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished saying these words to his
disciples, that he continued again in the discourse, and said unto them:
"Lo, I have then put on my Vesture, and all authority hath been given me
through the First Mystery. Yet a little while and I will tell you the
mystery of the universe and the fulness of the universe; and I will hide
nothing from you from this hour on, but in fulness will I perfect you in
all fulness and \|<span class="rmargnote">**16**.</span> in all
perfection and in all mysteries, which are the perfection of all
perfections and the fulness of all fulnesses and the gnosis of all
gnoses,--those which are in my Vesture. I will tell you all mysteries
from the exteriors of the exteriors to the interiors of the interiors.
But hearken that I may tell you all things which have befallen me.
