### \[THE NOTE OF A SCRIBE\]

<span class="margnote">A note by a later hand, copied from another
scripture.</span> \|<span class="rmargnote">**125**.</span>(Now these
are the names which I will give from the Boundless onward. Write them
with a sign, that the Sons of God may be revealed from here on.

This is the name of the Immortal: *aaa*, *ōōō*; and this is the name of
the Voice, for the sake of which the Perfect Man hath set himself in
motion: *iii*. And these are the interpretations of the names of these
mysteries: the first \[name\], which is *aaa*, its interpretation is
*fff*; the second, which is *mmm* or ōōō, its interpretation is *aaa*;
the third, which is *ps ps ps*, its interpretation is *ooo*; the fourth,
which is *fff*, its interpretation is *nnn*; the fifth, which is *ddd*,
its interpretation is *aaa*. He on the throne is *aaa*. This is the
interpretation of the second: *aaaa*, *aaaa*, *aaaa*; this is the
interpretation of the whole name.)
