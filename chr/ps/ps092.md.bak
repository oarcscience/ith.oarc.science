### CHAPTER 87

"It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished speaking these words,
that Mary Magdalene started forward and said:

<span class="margnote">Mary interpreteth the discourse from the
scriptures.</span>"My Lord, my indweller of light hath ears and I
comprehend every word which thou sayest. Now, therefore, my Lord, on
account of the word which thou hast spoken: 'All the souls of the race
of men who shall receive the mysteries of the Light, will go into the
Inheritance of the Light before all the rulers who will repent, and
before those of the whole region of the Right and before the whole
region of the Treasury of the Light,'--on account of this word, my Lord,
thou hast said unto us aforetime: 'The first will be last and the last
will be first,'--that is, the 'last' are the whole race of men which
will enter into the Light-kingdom sooner than all those of the region of
the Height, who are the first.' On this account, therefore, my Lord,
hast thou said unto us: 'Who hath ears to hear, let him hear,'--that is
thou desirest to know whether we \|<span
class="rmargnote">**198**.</span> comprehend every word which thou
speakest. This, therefore, is the word, my Lord."

It came to pass then, when Mary had finished saying these words, that
the Saviour was greatly astonished at the definitions of the words which

she spake, for she had become pure spirit utterly. Jesus answered again
and said unto her: "Well said, spiritual and pure Mary. This is the
solution of the word."
