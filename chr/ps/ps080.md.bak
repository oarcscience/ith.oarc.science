### CHAPTER 75

And he continued again in the discourse and said unto the disciples:
"These are all adventures which have befallen Pistis Sophia. \|<span
class="rmargnote">**166**.</span> It came to pass then, when I had led
her to the region which is below the thirteenth æon, and was

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

about to go unto the Light and depart from her, that she said unto me:

<span class="margnote">The conversation of Sophia and the
Light.</span>"'O Light of lights, thou wilt go to the Light and depart
from me. And Tyrant Adamas will know that thou hast departed from me and
will know that my saviour is not at hand. And he will come again to this
region, he and all his rulers who hate me, and Self-willed also will
bestow power unto his lion-faced emanation, so that they all will come
and constrain me all together and take my whole light from me, in order
that I may become powerless and again without light. Now, therefore, O
Light and my Light, take from them the power of their light, so that
they may not be able to constrain me from now on.'

<span class="margnote">The Light promiseth to seal the regions of
Self-willed.</span>"It came to pass then, when I heard these words which
Pistis Sophia had spoken unto me, that I answered her, saying: 'My
Father, who hath emanated me, hath not yet given me commandment to take
their light from them; but I will seal the regions of Self-willed and of
all his rulers who hate thee because thou hast had faith in the Light.
And I will also seal the regions of Adamas and of his rulers, so that
none of them may be able to fight with thee, until their time is
completed and the season cometh that my Father give me commandment to
take their light from them.'
