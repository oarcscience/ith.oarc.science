### CHAPTER 124

Mary continued again and said: "My Lord, a man who hath known the
godhead and hath received of the mysteries of the Light, and hath turned
and transgressed and done lawlessly and hath not turned to repent, and a
man on the other hand who hath not found the godhead nor known it, and
that man is a sinner and moreover impious, and they both have come out
of the body,--which of them will get more suffering in the judgments?"

<span class="margnote">The fate of the gnostic who sinneth is more
terrible than that of the ignorant sinner.</span>The Saviour answered
again and said unto Mary: "Amēn, amēn, I say unto thee: The man who hath
known the godhead and hath received the mysteries of the Light, and
sinned and hath not turned to repent, he will get suffering in the
chastisements of the judgments in great sufferings and \|<span
class="rmargnote">**316**.</span> judgments exceedingly far more in
comparison with the impious and law-breaking man who hath not known the
godhead. Now, therefore, who hath ears to hear, let him hear."

<span class="margnote">Mary interpreteth the same from a former
saying.</span>When then the Saviour had said this, Mary started forward
and said: "My Lord, my light-man hath ears, and I have understood the
whole word which thou hast spoken. Concerning this word then thou hast
spoken unto us in a similitude:

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'The slave who
knew the will of his lord and made not ready nor did the will of his
lord, will receive great blows; but he who knew not and did not, will be
deserving of less. For from every one to whom more is entrusted, of him
will more be demanded, and to whom much is handed over, of him much is
required,'--that is, my Lord: He who knew the godhead and hath found the
mysteries of the Light and hath transgressed, will be chastized in a far
greater chastisement than he who hath not known the godhead. This, my
Lord, is the solution of the word."
