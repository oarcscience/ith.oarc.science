have taught them, if they invoke them in their mysteries, that is in
their evil magic, to the hindering of good deeds,--will they accomplish
them henceforth from now on or not?"

<span class="margnote">Jesus explaineth further the conversion of the
spheres.</span>Jesus answered and said unto Mary: "They will not
accomplish them as they accomplished them from the beginning, because I
have taken away a third of their power; but they will raise a loan from
those who know the mysteries of the magic of the thirteenth æon. And if
they invoke the mysteries of the magic of those who are in the
thirteenth æon, \|<span class="rmargnote">**30**.</span> they will
accomplish them well and surely, because I have not taken away power
from that region, according to the command of the First Mystery."
