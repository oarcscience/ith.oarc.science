### CHAPTER 129

It came to pass then, when the Saviour had finished speaking these words
unto his disciples, that Mary answered and said unto Jesus: "My Lord, I
have heard thee say: 'He who shall receive of the mysteries of the
Ineffable or who shall receive of the mysteries of the First
Mystery,--they become flames of light-beams and light-streams and
penetrate all the regions until they reach the region of their
inheritance.'"

Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "If they receive the mystery when
still in life, and if they come out of the body, they become light-beams
and light-streams and penetrate all the regions until they reach the
region of their inheritance.

repented, and if ye perform for them the mystery of the Ineffable, in
order that they may be removed out of all the chastisements and be cast
into a righteous body, which is good and inheriteth the Light-kingdom or

brought into the last order of the Light, then they will not be able to
penetrate the regions, because they do not perform the mystery
\[themselves\]. But the receivers of Melchisedec follow them and lead
them before the Virgin of Light. And \|<span

rulers make frequent haste to take those souls and hand them over from
one to the other until they lead them before the Virgin of Light."
