### CHAPTER 60

<span class="margnote">The commandment of the First Mystery is fulfilled
for taking Sophia entirely out of the chaos.</span>And Jesus continued
again in the discourse and said unto his disciples: "It came to pass
when Pistis Sophia had uttered the thirteenth repentance,--in that hour
was fulfilled the commandment of all the tribulations which were
de-creed for Pistis Sophia for the fulfilment of the First Mystery,
which was from the beginning, and the time had come to save her out of
the chaos and lead her out from all the darknesses. For her repentance
was accepted from her through the First Mystery; and that mystery sent
me a great light-power out of the height, that I might help Pistis
Sophia \|<span class="rmargnote">**118**.</span> and lead her up out of
the chaos. <span class="margnote">The First Mystery and Jesus sent forth
two light-powers to help Sophia.</span>So I looked towards the æons into
the height and saw that light-power which the First Mystery had sent me,
that I might save Pistis Sophia out of the chaos. It came to pass,
therefore, when I had seen it, coming forth from the æons and hastening
down to me,--I was above

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

the chaos,--that another light-power went forth out of me, that it too
might help Pistis Sophia. And the light-power which had come from the
height through the First Mystery, came down upon the light-power which
had gone out of me; and they met together and became a great stream of
light."

When then Jesus had said this unto his disciples, he said: "Understand
ye in what manner I discourse with you?"

<span class="margnote">Mary Magdalene interpreteth the mystery from
Psalm lxxxiv.</span>Mary started forward again and said: "My Lord, I
understand what thou sayest. Concerning the solution of this word thy
light-power hath prophesied aforetime through David in the eighty-fourth
Psalm, saying:

"'10. Grace and truth met together, and righteousness and peace kissed
each other.

"'11. Truth sprouted forth out of the earth, and righteousness looked
down from heaven.'

"'Grace' then is the light-power which hath come down through the First
Mystery; for the First Mystery hath hearkened unto Pistis Sophia and
hath had \|<span class="rmargnote">**119**.</span> mercy on her in all
her tribulations. 'Truth' on the other hand is the power which hath gone
forth out of thee, for that thou hast fulfilled the truth, in order to
save her out of the chaos. And 'righteousness' again is the power which
hath come forth through the First Mystery, which will guide Pistis
Sophia. And 'peace' again is the power which hath gone forth out of
thee, so that it should enter into the emanations of Self-willed and
take from them the lights which they have taken away from Pistis Sophia,
that is, so that thou mayest gather them together into Pistis Sophia and
make them at peace with

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

her power. 'Truth' on the other hand is the power which went forth out
of thee, when thou wast in the lower regions of the chaos. For this
cause thy power hath said through David

'Truth sprouted out of the earth,' because thou wert in the lower
regions of the chaos. 'Righteousness' on the other hand which hath
'looked down from heaven,'--it is the power which hath come down from
the height through the First Mystery and hath entered into Pistis
Sophia."
