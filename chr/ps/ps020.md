### CHAPTER 16

"It came to pass then, when I came into their region, that they mutinied
and fought against the light. And I took the third of their power, in
order that they should not be able to accomplish their evil deeds. And
the Fate and the sphere, over which they rule, I have changed, and set
them facing the left six months and accomplishing their influences, and
I have set them turned another six months to the right and accomplishing
their influences."
