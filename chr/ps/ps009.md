### CHAPTER 5

<span class="margnote">Jesus addresseth them.</span>And it came to pass
then, when the disciples saw this, that they feared exceedingly, and
were in agitation. Then Jesus, the compassionate and tender-hearted,
when he saw his disciples, that they were in great agitation, spake with
them, saying: "Take courage. It is I, be not afraid."
