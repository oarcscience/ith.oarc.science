### CHAPTER 3

<span class="margnote">Jesus ascendeth into heaven.</span>It came to
pass then, when that light-power had come down over Jesus, that it
gradually surrounded him entirely. Then Jesus ascended or soared into
the height, shining most exceedingly in an immeasurable light. And the
disciples gazed after him and none of them spake, until he had reached
unto heaven; but they all kept in deep silence. This then came to pass
on the fifteenth day of the moon, on the day on which it is full in the
month Tybi.

<span class="margnote">The confusion of the powers and the great
earthquake.</span>It came to pass then, when Jesus had reached the
heaven, after three hours, that all the powers of the heaven fell into
agitation, and all were set in motion one against the other, they and
all their

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

æons and all their regions and all their orders, and the whole earth was
agitated and all they who dwell thereon. And all men who are in the
world fell into agitation, and also the disciples, and all thought:
Peradventure the world will be rolled up.

And all the powers in the heavens ceased not from their agitation, they
and the whole world, and all were moved one against the other, from the
third hour of the fifteenth day of the moon of Tybi until the ninth hour
of the morrow. And all the angels and their archangels and all the
powers of the height, all sang praises to the interiors of the \|<span

their voices, without their ceasing till the ninth hour of the morrow.
