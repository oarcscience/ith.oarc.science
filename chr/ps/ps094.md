### CHAPTER 89

<span class="margnote">Mary further questioneth Jesus.</span>It came to
pass then, when Mary had heard the Saviour say these words, that she
rejoiced with great joy and exulted exceedingly and said unto Jesus: "My
Lord, by how much

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

greatness then is the second Helper greater than the first Helper? By
how much distance is he distant from him, or rather how many times more
does he shine than the latter?"

<span class="margnote">Of the second Helper.</span>Jesus answered and
said unto Mary in the midst of the disciples: "Amēn, amēn, I say unto
you: The second Helper is distant from the first Helper in great
immeasurable distance in regard to the height above and the depth below
and the length and the breadth. For he is exceedingly distant from him
in great immeasurable distance through the angels and all the archangels
and through the gods and all the invisibles. And he is very considerably
greater than the latter in an incalculable measure \|<span
class="rmargnote">**201**.</span> through the angels and archangels and
through the gods and all the invisibles. And he shineth more than the
latter in an utterly immeasurable measure, there being no measure for
the light in which he is, and no measure for him through angels and
archangels and through the gods and all the invisibles, as I have
already said unto you at another time.

<span class="margnote">Of the third, fourth, and fifth
Helpers.</span>"In like manner also the third Helper and fourth and
fifth Helper,--one is greater than the other . . . and shineth more than
the latter and is distant from him in a great immeasurable distance
through the angels and archangels and the gods and all the invisibles,
as I have already said unto you at another time. And I will tell unto
you also the type of every one \[of them\] at their expansion."
