<p>And when Mary had said this, the First Mystery said unto her, "Well said, finely, Mary, blessed one."</p>  
<p>And he continued |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>162</b>.</FONT></span> again in the discourse and said unto the disciples: "Sophia again continued in this song and said:</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Sophia continueth her song.</FONT></span>"'1. The Light hath become my saviour.</p>  
<p>"'2. And it hath changed my darkness into light, and it has rent the chaos which surrounded me and girded me with light.'"</p>  
<p>It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had finished saying these words, that Martha came forward and said: "My Lord, thy power hath prophesied aforetime through David concerning these words:</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Martha interpreteth from Psalm xxix.</FONT></span>"'10. The Lord hath become my helper.</p>  
<p>"'11. He hath changed my lamentation into joy; he hath rent my mourning-robe and girded me with joy.'"</p>  
<p>And it came to pass when the First Mystery had heard Martha speak these words, that he said: "Well said, and finely, Martha."</p>  
<p><a name="page_137"><font size="1" color="green">p. 137</font></A></p>  
<p>And the First Mystery continued again and said unto the disciples: "Pistis Sophia again continued in the song and said:</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Sophia continueth her song.</FONT></span>"'1. My power, sing praises to the Light and forget not all the powers of the Light which it hath given unto thee.</p>  
<p>"'2. And the powers which are in thee, sing praises to the name of his holy mystery;</p>  
<p>"'3. Who forgiveth all thy transgression, who saveth thee from all the afflictions with which the emanations of Self-willed have constrained thee;</p>  
<p>"'4. Who hath saved thy light |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>163</b>.</FONT></span> from the emanations of Self-willed which belong to destruction; who hath wreathed thee with light in his compassion, until he saved thee;</p>  
<p>"'5. Who hath filled thee with purified light; and thy beginning will renew itself as an invisible of the Height.'</p>  
<p>"With these words Pistis Sophia sang praises, because she was saved and remembered all things which I had done unto her."</p>
