### CHAPTER 137

<span class="margnote">Of the powers which Yew bound into the five
regents.</span>Jesus continued and said: "Hearken then, that I may tell
you their mystery. It came to pass then, when Yew had thus bound them,
that he drew forth a power out of the great Invisible and bound it to
him who is called Kronos. And he drew another power out of
Ipsantachounchaïnchoucheōch, who is one of the three triple-powered
gods, and bound it to Arēs. And he drew a power out of Chaïnchōōōch, who
also is one of the three triple-powered gods, and bound it to Hermēs.
Again he drew a power out of the Pistis the Sophia daughter of Barbēlō
and bound it to Aphroditē.

<span class="margnote">Of the functions of Zeus, the chief
regent.</span>"And moreover he perceived that they needed a helm to
steer the world and the æons of the sphere, so that they might not wreck
it \[the world\] in their wickedness. He went into the Midst, drew forth
a power out of the little Sabaōth, the Good, him of the Midst, and bound
it to Zeus, because he is a good \[regent\], so that he may steer them
in his goodness. And he set thus established the circling of his order,
\|<span class="rmargnote">**362**.</span> that he should spend thirteen
\[? three\] months in every æon

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

confirming \[it\], so that he may set free all the rulers over whom he
cometh, from the evil of their wickedness. And he gave him two æons,
which are in face of those of Hermēs, for his dwelling.

<span class="margnote">The incorruptible names of the regents.</span>"I
have told you for the first time the names of these five great rulers
with which the men of the world are wont to call them. Hearken now then
that I may tell you also their incorruptible names, which are: Ōrimouth
correspondeth to Kronos; Mounichounaphōr correspondeth to Arēs;
Tarpetanouph correspondeth to Hermēs; Chōsi correspondeth to Aphroditē;
Chōnbal correspondeth to Zeus. These are their incorruptible names."
