### CHAPTER 73

And when Mary had said this, the First Mystery said unto her, "Well
said, finely, Mary, blessed one."

And he continued \|<span class="rmargnote">**162**.</span> again in the
discourse and said unto the disciples: "Sophia again continued in this
song and said:

<span class="margnote">Sophia continueth her song.</span>"'1. The Light
hath become my saviour.

"'2. And it hath changed my darkness into light, and it has rent the
chaos which surrounded me and girded me with light.'"

It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had finished saying these
words, that Martha came forward and said: "My Lord, thy power hath
prophesied aforetime through David concerning these words:

<span class="margnote">Martha interpreteth from Psalm xxix.</span>"'10.
The Lord hath become my helper.

"'11. He hath changed my lamentation into joy; he hath rent my
mourning-robe and girded me with joy.'"

And it came to pass when the First Mystery had heard Martha speak these
words, that he said: "Well said, and finely, Martha."

And the First Mystery continued again and said unto the disciples:
"Pistis Sophia again continued in the song and said:

<span class="margnote">Sophia continueth her song.</span>"'1. My power,
sing praises to the Light and forget not all the powers of the Light
which it hath given unto thee.

"'2. And the powers which are in thee, sing praises to the name of his
holy mystery;

"'3. Who forgiveth all thy transgression, who saveth thee from all the
afflictions with which the emanations of Self-willed have constrained
thee;

"'4. Who hath saved thy light \|<span class="rmargnote">**163**.</span>
from the emanations of Self-willed which belong to destruction; who hath
wreathed thee with light in his compassion, until he saved thee;

"'5. Who hath filled thee with purified light; and thy beginning will
renew itself as an invisible of the Height.'

"With these words Pistis Sophia sang praises, because she was saved and
remembered all things which I had done unto her."
