<p>When then the Saviour had said this unto his disciples, he said unto them: "Understand ye in what manner I speak with you?"</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Mary interpreteth from a former saying.</FONT></span>Mary answered and said: "Yea, my Lord, with precision have I precisely followed all the words which thou hast said. Concerning this word then thou hast spoken unto us aforetime: 'If the house-holder knew at what hour in the night the thief cometh to break into the house, he would keep awake and not suffer the man to break into his house.'"</p>  
<p>When then Mary had said this, the Saviour said: "Well said, thou spiritual Mary. This is the word."</p>  
<p>The Saviour continued again and said unto his disciples: "Now, therefore, herald ye unto all men who shall receive mysteries in the Light, and speak |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>311</b>.</FONT></span> unto them, saying: Keep watch over yourselves and sin not, lest ye heap evil on evil and go out of the body without having repented and become strangers to the Light-kingdom for ever."</p>  
<p>When the Saviour had said this, Mary answered and said: "My Lord, great is the compassion of those mysteries which forgive sins at every time."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">If even men on earth are compassionate, how much more then the highest mysteries?</FONT></span>The Saviour answered and said unto Mary in the midst of the disciples: "If to-day a king who is a man of the world, giveth a gift to men of his like, and also forgiveth murderers and those who have intercourse with males, and the rest of the very grievous sins which are deserving of death,--if it becometh him who is a man of the</p>

<p>world, to have done this, much more then have the Ineffable and the First Mystery, who are the lords of the universe, the authority to act in all things as it pleaseth them, that they forgive every one who shall receive mysteries.</p>  
<p>"Or if on the other hand a king to-day investeth a soldier with a royal vesture and sendeth him into foreign regions, and he committeth murders and other grievous sins which are deserving of death, then they will not impute them to him, and are not able to do him any evil because he is invested with the royal vesture,--how much more then those who wear the mysteries of the vestures of the Ineffable and those of the First Mystery, who are lords over all those of the height and all those of the depth!"</p>
