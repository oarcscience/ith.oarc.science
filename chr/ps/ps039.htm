<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The second repentance of Sophia.</FONT></span>Jesus continued again in the discourse and said: "Pistis Sophia again continued and still sang praises in a second repentance, saying thus:</p>  
<p>"'1. Light of lights, in whom I have had faith, leave me not in the darkness until the end of my time.</p>  
<p>"'2. Help me and save me through thy mysteries; incline thine ear unto me and save me.</p>  
<p>"'3. May the power of thy light save me and carry me to the higher &aelig;ons; for thou wilt save me and lead me into the height of thy &aelig;ons.</p>  
<p>"'4. Save me, O Light, from the hand of this lion-faced power and from the hands of the emanations of god Self-willed.</p>  
<p>"'5. For it is thou, O Light, in whose light I have had faith and in whose light I have trusted from the beginning.</p>  
<p>"'6. And I have had faith in it from the time when it emanated me, and thou thyself didst make me to emanate; and I have had faith in thy light from the beginning.</p>  
<p><a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="green">p. 46</font></A></p>  
<p>"'7. And when I had faith in thee, the rulers of the &aelig;ons mocked at me, saying: She hath ceased in her mystery. Thou art |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>57</b>.</FONT></span> my saviour and thou art my deliverer and thou art my mystery, O Light.</p>  
<p>"'8. My mouth was filled with glorifying, that I may tell of the mystery of thy grandeur at all times.</p>  
<p>"'9. Now, therefore, O Light, leave me not in the chaos for the completion of my whole time; forsake me not, O Light.</p>  
<p>"'10. For all the emanations of Self-willed have taken from me my whole light-power and have surrounded me. They desired to take away my whole light from me utterly and have set a watch on my power,</p>  
<p>"'11. Saying one to another together: The Light hath forsaken her, let us seize her and take away the whole light in her.</p>  
<p>"'12. Therefore then, O Light, cease not from me; turn thee, O Light, and save me from the hands of the merciless.</p>  
<p>"'13. May they who would take away my power, fall down and become powerless. May they who would take away my light-power from me, be enwrapped in darkness and sink into powerlessness.'</p>  
<p>"This then is the second repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, singing praises to the Light."</p>
