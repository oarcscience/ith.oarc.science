### CHAPTER 12

<span class="margnote">He entereth the first sphere.</span>"And I left
that region behind me and ascended to the first sphere, shining most
exceedingly, forty-and-nine-times more brightly than I had shone in the
firmament. It came to pass then, when I had reached the gate of the
first sphere, that its gates were shaken and opened of themselves at
once.

<span class="margnote">The powers of the first sphere are amazed and
fall down and adore him.</span>"I entered into the houses of the sphere,
shining most exceedingly, and there was no measure to the light that was
about me. And all the rulers and all those who are in that sphere, fell
into agitation one against another. And they saw the great light that
was about me, and they gazed upon my vesture and saw thereon the mystery
of their name. And they fell into still greater agitation, and were in
great fear, saying: 'How hath the lord of the universe passed through us
without our knowing?' \|<span class="rmargnote">**22**.</span> And all
their bonds were unloosed and their regions and their orders; and every
one left his order, and they fell down all together, adored before me,
or before my vesture, and all sang

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

praises together to the interiors of the interiors, being in great fear
and great agitation.
