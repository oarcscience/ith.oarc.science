### CHAPTER 53

When then Jesus had said this unto his disciples, he said unto them:
"Now, therefore, let him whom his spirit stirreth, come forward and
speak the solution of the tenth repentance of Pistis Sophia."

Peter answered and said: "O Lord, concerning this thy light-power
prophesied aforetime through David in the one-hundred-and-nineteenth
Psalm; saying:

<span class="margnote">Peter interpreteth the tenth repentance from
Psalm cxix.</span>"'1. I cried unto thee, O Lord, in my oppression, and
thou hearkenest unto me.

"'2. O Lord, save \|<span class="rmargnote">**101**.</span> my soul from
unjust lips and from crafty tongues.

"'3. What will be given unto thee or what will be added unto thee with a
crafty tongue?

"'4. The arrows of the strong \[one\] are made sharp with the coal of
the desert.

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

"'5. Woe unto me, that my dwelling is far off, and I dwelt in the tents
of Kedar.

"'6. My soul hath dwelt in many regions as a guest.

"'7. I was peaceful with them who hate peace; if I spake unto them, they
fought against me without a cause.'

"This is now, therefore, O Lord, the solution of the tenth repentance of
Pistis Sophia, which she hath uttered when the material emanations of
Self-willed oppressed her, they and his lion-faced power, and when they
oppressed her exceedingly."

<span class="margnote">Jesus commendeth Peter.</span>Jesus said unto
him: "Well said, Peter, and finely. This is the solution of the tenth
repentance of Pistis Sophia."
