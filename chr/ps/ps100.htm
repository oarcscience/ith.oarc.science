<p>It came to pass then, when Jesus had heard Mary say these words and knew that the disciples had heard and had begun to let go, that he encouraged them and said unto them: "Grieve</p>  
<p><a name="page_182"><font size="1" color="green">p. 182</font></A></p>  
<p>no more, my disciples, concerning the mystery of, the Ineffable, thinking that ye will not understand it. Am&#275;n, I say unto you: That mystery is yours, and every one's who will give ear unto you, so that they renounce this whole world and the whole matter therein and renounce all the evil thoughts therein and renounce all the cares of this &aelig;on.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Jesus explaineth that that mystery is really simpler than all mysteries.</FONT></span>"Now, therefore, I say unto you: |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>218</b>.</FONT></span> For every one who will renounce the whole world and all therein and will submit himself to the godhead, that mystery is far easier than all the mysteries of the Light-kingdom and it is sooner to understand than them all and it is easier [?] than them all. He who reacheth unto the gnosis of that mystery, renounceth this whole world and all the cares therein.</p>  
<p>"For this cause have I said to you aforetime: 'All ye who are heavy under your burden, come hither unto me, and I will quicken you. For my burden is easy and my yoke is soft.' Now, therefore, he who will receive that mystery, renounceth the whole world and the cares of all the matter therein. For this cause, therefore, my disciples, grieve not, thinking that ye will not understand that mystery. Am&#275;n, I say unto you: That mystery is far sooner to understand than all mysteries. And am&#275;n, I say unto you: That mystery is yours and every one's who will renounce the whole world and the whole matter therein.</p>  
<p>"Now, therefore, hearken, my disciples and my companions and my brethren, that I may urge you on to the gnosis of the mystery of the Ineffable |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>219</b>.</FONT></span> concerning which I discourse with you,</p>  
<p><a name="page_183"><font size="1" color="green">p. 183</font></A></p>  
<p>because I have in Booth gotten as far as to tell you the whole gnosis at the expansion of the universe; for the expansion of the universe is its gnosis.</p>  
<p>"But now then hearken that I may discourse with you progressively concerning the gnosis of that mystery.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the rending asunder and emanation of the powers of the universe.</FONT></span>"That mystery knoweth wherefor the five Helpers have rent themselves asunder and wherefor they have come forth from the Fatherless [<i>pl</i>.].</p>  
<p>"And that mystery knoweth wherefor the great Light of lights hath rent itself asunder and wherefor it hath come forth from the Fatherless.</p>

<p>"And that mystery knoweth wherefor all the Imperishables, being their twelve orders, have rent themselves asunder and wherefor they have settled themselves, being expanded in a single order, and wherefor they have divided themselves and formed different orders, being uncontainable and boundless, and wherefor they have come forth from the Fatherless.</p>  
<p>"And that mystery knoweth wherefor the Impassables have rent themselves asunder and wherefor they have set themselves up, being twelve boundless spaces, and have settled themselves, being three orders of spaces, according to the economy of the One and Only, the Ineffable, and wherefor they have come forth from the Fatherless.</p>

<p>"And that mystery knoweth wherefor the four-and-twenty myriads of Praise-singers have rent themselves asunder and wherefor they have extended themselves outside the veil of the First Mystery, which is the twin-mystery, that which looketh within and without, of the One and Only, the Ineffable, and wherefor they have come forth from the Fatherless.</p>
