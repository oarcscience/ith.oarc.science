<p>"It came to pass, when the sun rose in the east, thereafter then through the First Mystery, which existed from the beginning, on account of which the universe hath arisen, |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>10</b>.</FONT></span> out of which also I am myself now come, not in the time before my</p>  
<p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="green">p. 8</font></A></p>  
<p>crucifixion, but now,--it came to pass, through the command of that mystery, that there should<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">How the Vesture of Light was sent unto him.</FONT></span> be sent me my Light-vesture, which it had given me from the beginning, and which I had left behind in the last mystery, that is the four-and-twentieth mystery from within without,--those which are in the orders of the second space of the First Mystery. That Vesture then I left behind in the last mystery, until the time should be completed to put it on, and I should begin to discourse with the race of men and reveal unto them all from the beginning of the Truth to its completion, and discourse with them from the interiors of the interiors to the exteriors of the exteriors and from the exteriors of the exteriors to the interiors of the interiors. Rejoice then and exult and rejoice more and more greatly, for to you it is given that I speak first with you from the beginning of the Truth to its completion.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the souls of the disciples and their incarnation.</FONT></span>"For this cause have I chosen you verily from the beginning through the First Mystery. Rejoice then and exult, for when I set out for the world, |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>11</b>.</FONT></span> I brought from the beginning with me twelve powers, as I have told you from the beginning, which I have taken from the twelve saviours of the Treasury of the Light, according to the command of the First Mystery. These then I cast into the womb of your mothers, when I came into the world, that is those which are in your bodies to-day. For these powers have been given unto you before the whole world, because ye are they who will save the whole world, and that ye may be able to endure the threat of the rulers of the world and the pains of the world and its dangers and all its persecutions, which the rulers of the height will</p>  
<p><a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="green">p. 9</font></A></p>  
<p>bring upon you. For many times have I said unto you that I have brought the power in you out of the twelve saviours who are in the Treasury of the Light. For which cause I have said unto you indeed from the beginning that ye are not of the world. I also am not of it. For all men who are in the world have gotten their souls out of [the power of] the rulers of the &aelig;ons. But the power which is in you is from me; your souls belong to the height. I have brought twelve powers of the twelve saviours of the Treasury of the Light, taking them out of the portion of my power which |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>13</b>.</FONT></span> I did first receive. And when I had set forth for the world, I came into the midst of the rulers of the sphere and had the form of Gabri&#275;l the angel of the &aelig;ons; and the rulers of the &aelig;ons did not know me, but they thought that I was the angel Gabri&#275;l.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the incarnation of John the Baptizer.</FONT></span>"It came to pass then, when I had come into the midst of the rulers of the &aelig;ons, that I looked down on the world of mankind, by command of the First Mystery. I found Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptizer, before she had conceived him, and I sowed into her a power which I had received from the little Ia&#333;, the Good, who is in the Midst, that he might be able to make proclamation before me and make ready my way, and baptize with the water of the forgiveness of sins. That power then is in the body of John.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">That John was Elias in a former birth.</FONT></span>"Moreover in place of the soul of the ruler which he was appointed to receive, I found the soul of the prophet Elias in the &aelig;ons of the sphere; and I took him thence, and took hi soul and brought it to the Virgin of Light, and</p>  
<p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="green">p. 10</font></A></p>  
<p>she gave it over to her receivers; they brought it to the sphere of the rulers and cast it into the womb of Elizabeth. So the power of the little Ia&#333;, who is in the Midst, and the soul of the prophet Elias, they were bound into the body of John the Baptizer. For this cause then were ye in doubt aforetime, I when I said unto you: 'John said: I am not the Christ,' and ye said unto me: 'It standeth written in the scripture: When the Christ shall come, Elias cometh before him and maketh ready his way.' But when ye said this unto me, I said unto you: 'Elias verily is come and hath made ready all things, as it standeth written, and they have done unto him as they would.' And when I knew that ye had not understood that I had discoursed with you concerning the soul of Elias which is bound into John the Baptizer, I answered you in the discourse in openness face to face: 'If ye like to accept John the Baptizer: he is Elias, of whom I have said that he will come.'"</p>
