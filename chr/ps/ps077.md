### CHAPTER 72

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had heard Matthew speak
these words, that he said: "Well said, Matthew, and finely, beloved.
This is the solution of the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered."

And the First Mystery continued again and said:

<span class="margnote">Sophia continueth to sing.</span>"'1. I will
declare: Thou art the higher Light, for that hast saved me and led me
unto thee, and thou hast not let the emanations of Self-willed, which
are hostile unto me, take my light.

"'2. O Light of lights, I sing praises unto thee; thou hast saved me.

"'3. O Light, thou hast led up my power out of the chaos; thou hast
saved me from them which have gone down into the darkness.'

"These words again hath Pistis Sophia uttered, Now, therefore, whose
mind hath become understanding, comprehending the words which Pistis
Sophia hath uttered, let him come forward and set forth their solution."

<span class="margnote">Mary is afraid of Peter.</span>It came to pass
then, when the First Mystery had finished speaking these words unto the
disciples, that Mary came forward and said: "My Lord, my \|<span
class="rmargnote">**161**.</span> mind is ever understanding, at every
time to come forward and set forth the solution of the words which she
hath uttered; but I am afraid of Peter, because he threatened me and
hateth our sex."

And when she had said this, the First Mystery said unto her: "Every one
who shall be filled with the spirit of light to come forward and set
forth the solution of what I say,--no one shall be able to prevent him.
Now, therefore, O Mary, set forth then the solution of the words which
Pistis Sophia hath uttered."

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

Then Mary answered and said unto the First Mystery in the midst of the
disciples: "My Lord, concerning the solution of the words which Pistis
Sophia hath uttered, thus hath thy light-power prophesied aforetime
through David:

<span class="margnote">Mary interpreteth the song of Sophia from Psalm
xxix.</span>"'1. I will exalt thee, O Lord, for thou hast received me,
and thou hast not made glad my foes over me.

"'2. O Lord, my God, I cried up unto thee, and thou hast healed me.

"'3. O Lord, thou hast led up my soul out of hell; thou hast saved me
from them which have gone down into the pit.'"
