It was by W. that the New Testament, according to the text of the famous
Codex Alexandrinus, was edited, in uncial types cast to imitate those of
the MS., in 1786. In an Appendix to this great undertaking, in 1799 (see
below, 5), he added certain fragments of the New Testament in the
Thebaico-Coptic dialect, together with a dissertation on the Coptic
version of the New Testament. The date of the C.A. is generally assigned
to the 5th cent., and, with the exception of the Codex Vaticanus and the
Codex Sinaiticus, which are sometimes assigned to the 4th cent., is the
oldest extant MS. of the New Testament. This being the case, it is of
interest to quote from the *Beiträge* W.'s opinion on the date of the
MS. of P.S., which was lent to this careful scholar by Dr. Askew and
which he copied from the first word to the last:

"It \[P.S.\] is a very old MS. in 4to on parchment in Greek uncial
characters, which are *not so round* as those in the Alexandrine MS. in
London, and in the Claromontain MS. in Paris \[Codex Regius Parisiensis,
also an Alexandrine text\]. The characters of the MS. \[P.S.\] are
somewhat longer and more angular, so that I take them to be *older* than
both the latter MSS., in which the letters eta, theta, omicron, rho and
sigma are much rounder."

Thus W. would date the MS. towards the end of the 4th cent.

Under date 1773 there is a letter from Woide to Michaelis, in which the
former says in reference to the P.S. Codex that Askew had picked it up
by chance in a book-shop. There follows a description of the MS.

W. gives the date of the P.S. Codex as about the 4th cent., and
considers the writer of the Greek original to have been Valentinus.

Bishop Münter, a learned Dane, probably got his text from Woide's copy.
His brief pamphlet is of no particular importance; nevertheless it was
solely upon these few selections, the five Odes of Solomon, that, with
the exception of Dulaurier, scholars formed their opinion of the P.S. up
to the time of the publication of Schwartze's translation in 1851.
Münter believed that the original treatise belonged to the 2nd cent. For
Odes of Solomon see below, 49, 53 and 60.

contains no reference to P.S. In Dörner's German translation the
references are ii. 69 ff. and 163 ff.</span>

M. rejects the authorship of Valentinus, though he bases himself
otherwise entirely on Woide. He vaguely places the date of the original
treatise between the end of the 2nd and the end of the 5th cent., but
gives no opinion as to the school to which it belongs (p. 352).

<span class="small">9. 1847. Dulaurier (É.). Art. in the *Journal
Asiatique*, 4<sup>e</sup> série, tom. ix., juin, pp. 534-548, '*Notice

Publication projetée du Texte et de la Traduction française de ce
Manuscript*.'</span>

D. had prepared a translation of the P.S. He writes: "The translation of
the Pistis Sophia and the glossary which forms a complement to it are
finished, and will be sent to the printers, when I have convinced myself
that I have fulfilled the requirements that this task imposes, taking
into consideration the present state of science and my own capabilities.
The MS. from which I have made my translation is a copy which I have
taken from the original, during my stay in England in 1838-1840, when I
was charged by MM. de

<span id="page_liv">p. liv</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Salvandy and
Villemain, successive ministers of public instruction, with the
commission of proceeding to London to study this curious monument." (p.
542). D., however, did not publish his labours, nor have I as yet come
across any record of the fate of his MS. He ascribes the treatise to
Valentinus.

<span class="small">10. 1851. Schwartze (M. G.). *Pistis Sophia, Opus
Gnosticum Valentino adjudicatum, e Codice Manuscripto Coptico Londinensi
descriptum*. Latine vertit M. G. Schwartze, edidit J. H. Petermann
(Berlin).</span>

In 1848 Schwartze made a copy of the Codex in London, but unfortunately
died before the completion of his labours on the P.S., and the MS.
translation he left behind contained a number of blanks and passages
which he intended to fill up and correct. His friend Petermann confined
himself in his notes strictly to verbal corrections and suggestions as
to *variæ lectiones*. The consequence is that we have a translation
without the notes of the translator and without a word of introduction.
P. says the task of editing was so severe that he frequently suffered
from fits of giddiness. In spite of numerous blemishes this first
edition is said to be 'an outstanding achievement.' S. considers the
original treatise, as we see from the title of his work, to have been
written by Valentinus; but P. is of the opinion that it is the work of
an Ophite, and promises to set forth his reasons at length in a
treatise, which has unfortunately never seen the light. A review of S.'s
work appeared in the *Journal des Savants* of 1852 (p. 333).

<span class="small">11. 1852. Bunsen (C. C. J.). *Hippolytus and seine
Zeit, Anfänge and Aussichten des Christenthums and der Menschheit*
(Leipzig), i. 47, 48. Hippolytus and his Age (London, 1852), i. 61,
62.</span>

"Great, therefore, were my hopes in 1842, that the ancient Coptic
manuscript of the British Museum, inscribed Sophia, might be a
translation, or at least an extract, from that lost text-book of
Gnosticism \[the work quoted by Hippolytus, *sub* Valent.\]: but
unfortunately the accurate and trustworthy labours of that patient and
conscientious Coptic scholar, Dr. Schwartze, so early taken away from
us, have proved to me (for I have seen and perused his manuscript, which
I hope will soon appear), that this Coptic treatise is a most worthless
(I trust, purely Coptic) offshoot of the Marcosian heresy, of the latest
and stupidest mysticism about letters, sounds and words."

<span id="page_lv">p. lv</span>

B.'s Marcosian theory has been partially revived by Legge (below, 57),
but is supported by no one else, and we doubt whether B. could have read
Schwartze's MS. with any great care.

<span class="small">12. 1853. Baur (F. C.). *Das Christenthum and die
christliche Kirche der drei ersten Jahrhunderte* (Tübingen), notes on
pp. 185, 186, and 205, 206.</span>

B. evidently added these notes at the last moment before publication. On
page 206 he leans to the idea of an Ophite origin.

<span class="small">13. 1854. Köstlin (K. R.). Two arts. in Baur and
Zeller's *Theologische Jahrbücher* (Tübingen), xiii. 1--104 and
137--196, '*Das gnostische System des Ruches Pistis Sophia*.'</span>

K. was the first to make an exhaustive analysis of the contents of the
treatise, with the special object of setting forth the system of P.S.,
and his labours were used later by Lipsius in his art, in Smith and
Wace's *Dictionary of Christian Biography* (below, 20). He assigns its
date to the first half of the 3rd cent., and thinks that it is of Ophite
origin. In a note to page 1, K. writes:

"The MS. from which the work is published belongs to the collection of
MSS. collected by Dr. Askew of London during his travels in Italy and
Greece, of which *The British Theological Magazine* (*Das Brittische
theol. Magazin*) for the year 1770 (vol. i. part 4, p. 223) gives more
particulars."

We know nothing of these travels, and there is no such magazine in the
catalogue of the British Museum. *The Theological Repository* for 1770
contains no information on the subject; and no permutation of names
solves the mystery. There were very few magazines published at that
early date, so that the choice is limited.

<span class="small">14. 1856. An Anonymous Translation in Migne's
*Dictionnaire des Apocryphes*, tom. i. app. part. ii. coll. 1181--1286;
this tome forms vol. xxiii. of his third *Encyclopédie
Théologique*.</span>

The translation is a sorry piece of work, more frequently a mere
paraphrase from Schwartze's version than translation; there are also
frequent omissions, sometimes as many as 40 pages of Schwartze's text;
*e.g.* pp. 18, 19, 36 ff., 50, 51, 72, 73, 86-90, 108-135, 139, 157-160,
162, 171, 179, 180, 184-186, 221-243, 245-255, 281-320, 324-342. These
are some of the omissions; but there are many more. It is, therefore,
entirely useless to the student. The anonymous

<span id="page_lvi">p. lvi</span>

writer vaguely suggests a late date for the treatise because of the
complicated nature of the system.

L. considers P.S. an Egypto-Ophite treatise, and with Köstlin assigns
its date to the first half of the 3rd cent. See his Art. in *Dict. of
Christ. Biog.* (1887).

K. regards the P.S. as the most precious relic of Gnosticism. Besides
many references scattered throughout the volume, there are translations
from Schwartze of pages 227-239, 242-244, 247-248, 255-259, 261-263,
282-292, 298-308, 341, 342, 358, 375. K. does not venture an opinion on
either the date or author.

A still valuable study. "We may regard ourselves as justified in
assigning (with Petermann and Köstlin) the book Pistis Sophia to one of
the large groups of Ophite sects, though nevertheless the system it
contains is not identical with any one of the other Ophite systems known
to us." Of importance is L.'s suggestion that P.S. may be indirectly one
of the sources of the Manichæan religion. In any case,

<span id="page_lvii">p. lvii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "it may be assumed
as probable that the book Pistis Sophia was written before the time of
the Manichæan system, and therefore before A.D. 270. Moreover, as the
system contained in it is evidently more recent than the other Ophitic
systems known to us, we shall have, with Köstlin, to assign its
composition to the first half of the 3rd cent." (p. 414b).

These views have been severely criticized, especially by Schmidt (below,
28; also 25-27).

<span class="small">24a. 1891. Harnack (A.). *Über das gnostische Buch
Pistis-Sophia* (Leipzig). (*Texte u. Untersuch.* vii. 2.)</span>

A study (144 pp.) of the first importance, in which this high authority
on the history and chronology of early Christian literature and the
history of the development of dogma submits the contents of the Latin
version of Schwartze to a careful analysis, and gives 8/9 reasons for
placing the P.S. in the second half of the 3rd cent. H. is mainly
valuable in his analysis of the Biblical references in the P.S.,
especially the uses it makes of the N.T., and in his estimate of the
stage of development of the general Christian and Catholic elements in
P.S. H. thinks that Div. iii. should be called 'Questions of Mary' (pp.
94, 108). Unknown to H., Renan (*Marc Aurèle*, p. 120) had already
hazarded the suggestion that the whole P.S. might be identical with the
*Little Questions* 

<span id="page_lviii">p. lviii</span>

*of Mary*, mentioned by Epiphanius. But R. shows (p. 145) that he has no
direct acquaintance with the subject. H. assigns the P.S. to an
'Ophitic' sect, but not the 'Ophites' in the narrower meaning, for here,
as elsewhere often in the use of the name, no sign of the worship of the
serpent is found (p. 110). He brings the P.S. sect into close connection
with the Syrian Ophitic group, which had offshoots in Egypt, and opens
up those investigations into the statements of Epiphanius which Schmidt
has surveyed in greater detail in his edition of the Codex Brucianus
(below, 28). In fact these two scholars have been in close touch with
one another in their work on the P.S. as to its origin, date and place.
The concluding remark of H. on the general religious status of the
P.S.--that is to say, its bearing on Early Christian and Catholic
religion, in other words its place within the general history of
Christianity--is noteworthy. He writes (p. 114): "In this respect the
P.S. is a document of first rank, for we possess no second work which
brings before our eyes so clearly the previous history of Catholic
sacramentism. What we meet with here more sharply brought out and at one
stroke among the Gnostics of the end of the third century, was
accomplished by the Catholic Church toilsomely and gradually in the
following century. This Gnosticism is not the father of Catholicism, but
rather an elder brother who gained by assault what the younger brother
attained subsequently amid a thousand exigencies."

<span class="small">28. 1892. Schmidt (C.). *Gnostische Schriften in
koptischer Sprache aus dem Codex Brucianus* (Leipzig), 692 pp. (*T. u.
U.* viii.)</span>

S.'s masterly edition entirely supersedes that of Amélineau, who worked
on Woide's copy of the confused heap of leaves preserved in the
Bodleian. His minute examination of the

<span id="page_lix">p. lix</span>

original discovered that the chaos could first of all be sorted out into
two totally different MSS. The larger work is entitled *The Book of the
Great Logos according to the Mystery*. The contents fall naturally into
two divisions, which S. calls respectively 'The First' and 'The Second
Book of Jeû.' The system is closely related to that of the P.S.
miscellany. S. devotes pp. 334-538 to a penetrating study of this
relation-ship, in which he makes a most valuable contribution to the
analysis of the contents of the P.S. His labours here are practically an
Introduction to his subsequent translation of the P.S. in 1905 (below,
45). Among much else of the greatest value he gives us a minutely
detailed investigation of the system of the P.S., which supersedes
Köstlin's pains-taking pioneer effort (1854). S. is rightly of opinion
that P.S. is a more or less happy compilation from other works (p. 318),
as Köstlin had already pointed out (p. 344). He seems to think little of
the possible objection that, whereas the 'Two Books of Yew,' mentioned
twice in the P.S., are said to have been dictated to Enoch by Jesus
before the Flood and hidden away, the contents of the first document of
the C.B. are revealed by Jesus himself to the disciples (p. 343). The
statement in the P.S. is in keeping with common apocalyptic claims, and
in any case the sect as a matter of fact did possess two Yew Books, and
the contents of C.B. I. are what we should expect from the references in
the P.S., while the intimate relationship between P.S. Div. iv. and C.B.
I.b is patent to the most casual reader. He agrees with Harnack as to
the date of the P.S.--namely, the latter half of the 3rd cent. for Divv.
i.-iii., and a few decades earlier for Div. iv. C.B. I. is thus to be
placed in the first half of the 3rd cent. (pp. 540, 598). C.B. II. is a
work without a title, the contents of which have roused S. to enthusiasm
(pp. 34, 35). It is plainly of an earlier date, and so S. here
conjectures for it about 160-200 A.D. (p. 542); but he has subsequently
changed his view as to date (see 47, below).

After a close methodical investigation, in which in particular he
submits the statements of Epiphanius to a searching criticism, S. thinks
that everything points to the Severians as being most probably the sect
to which the writings contained in P.S. and C.B. I. can be attributed
(p. 596). C.B. II., he concludes, may be assigned to Sethian-Archontics
(p. 659). But the whole question bristles with difficulties when precise
names are in question. It is to be noted that in his researches

<span id="page_lx">p. lx</span>

S. lays under contribution as very pertinent to the inquiry his prior
labours on the puzzling problem of the Gnostics of Plotinus, in his
treatise Plotin's *Stellung zum Gnosticismus und kirchlichen
Christentum* (Leipzig), 1900, 168 pp. (*T. u. U. N.F.* v. 4.). There is
much criticism of Amélineau's work and views scattered throughout this
C.B. volume.

I am aware, which has not appeared in C.'s larger works.

A. advocates strongly the Valentinian origin of the treatise,

<span id="page_lxi">p. lxi</span>

and leans almost exclusively to an Egyptian origin of the ideas. These
views have been severely criticized, especially by Schmidt. The MS.
itself, however, A. places very late, writing on page xi of his
Introduction as follows:--"After an examination of the enormous faults
which the scribe has committed, I cannot attribute to the MS. which has
preserved the Pistis-Sophia to us, a date later than the ninth or tenth
century, and that too the minimum. For this I have several reasons.
Firstly, the MS. is written on parchment, and parchment was hardly ever
commonly used in Egypt before the sixth or seventh century. Secondly,
the writing, which is uncial, though passable in the first pages of the
MS., becomes bastard in a large number of leaves, when the scribe's hand
is fatigued; no longer is it the beautiful writing of the Egyptian
scribes of the great periods, but slack, inconsistent, almost round and
hurried. Thirdly, the faults of orthography in the use of Greek words
evidently show that the scribe belonged to a period when Greek was
almost no longer known."

In a footnote Amélineau says that he is perfectly aware that this
opinion of his will 'raise a tempest,' and begs for a suspension of
judgment till he has published his reasons, especially as to the late
use of parchment, at greater length. The storm broke, and no one has
accepted A.'s arguments. Among other things he failed to notice that in
the first place the Askew Codex is the work of two scribes, and not of
one, and that the various portions of their common task can be
unquestionably assigned to each. The parchment argument has never seen
the light, as far as I am aware.

On p. 7 R. calls attention to a remarkable difference in the versions of
the Psalms quoted in the P.S. While the citations in pp. 53-82 and
111-181 (Schw.-Pet. ed.) vary relatively only slightly from the usual
Sahidic version, those in pp. 86-110 are so totally different that they
must be an independent translation from the Greek. If this is so, we are
confronted by the high probability that Repentances 8-13 are a later
addition, and that there were thus originally only 7 Repentances. If
this hypothesis stands, it is of great importance for the internal
analysis of the literature. R.'s view is criticized by Rendel Harris
(below, 60).

In his analysis of the composition of the P.S., L. introduces a novelty.
He thinks that pp. 128 (ch. 64)-175 (end of ch. 80), subsequent to the
thirteen Repentances, are a later insertion in the Sophia-episode, and
regards the opening lines of ch. 81 ("It came to pass after all this")
as a redactor's connecting paragraph.

With regard to the appropriateness of the suggested title, 'The
Questions of Mary,' for Div. iii., and of 'The Gospel of Philip' (P.S.
ch. 42) as a possible title for Divv. i. and ii.,--he tries to get over
the difficulty that those two titles are mentioned by Epiphanius among
the books of a group of sects to which the Church Father ascribes the
most filthy, blasphemous and obscene rites, in the following conjecture
(p. 242):--" A Gnostic sect in Egypt possessed a rich, apocalyptic

<span id="page_lxiii">p. lxiii</span>

literature, among which was to be found a *Gospel of Philip* and
*Questions of Mary*. This sect was divided into an ascetic and a
libertinist branch, and each group worked over the sacred literature
which had come down to them." Epiphanius (Hær. xxvi.) got hold of the
libertinist redaction; the ascetic is preserved for us in P.S., Divv.
i.-iii. Div. iv. is an earlier stratum. 'The Books of Yew' mentioned in
P.S. are said to have been revealed to Enoch; accordingly, like
Preuschen, he thinks that these cannot be the treatise of the Bruce
Codex to which Schmidt has assigned this title, for the latter is
revealed to the Disciples (p. 251).

H. repeats, from his detailed study (above, 24a), his reasons for
assigning the contents of P.S. Divv. i.-iii. to the latter half of 3rd
cent. He says that Liechtenhan's final opinion (above, 41) on 'The
Questions of Mary' problem is not far from his own view. Why H. assigns
the treatises of the Bruce Codex to the 5th or 6th cent. (!) is not set
forth.

but the only reason he advances is the hazardous statement that: "The

fourth and following centuries."

pp. 839 ff., entitled '*Bin vorirenaeisches gnostisches Original-werk in

the light. The contents are of great value, for *The Apocryphon of
John*, in its original Greek form, lay before Irenæus, and in an
appendix to Schmidt's notice Harnack ventures the query: Can *The Wisdom
(Sophia) of Jesus Christ* possibly be the lost famous writing of
Valentinus so entitled?

In the Introduction (pp. ix-xviii) S. sums up the results of his prior
studies. The Translation of the P.S. occupies pp. 1-254, and is
deserving of the highest praise.

This is a very important study, in which S. again treats of *The
Apocryphon of John* in the unpublished Coptic Gnostic Berlin Codex, on
which he had already specially dwelt in reporting for the first time the
contents of the Codex to the Prussian Academy in 1896. The Greek
original is early, and a copy of it lay before Irenæus. We are thus in a
position to estimate the nature of the Church Father's method of
quotation and summarizing, and it is clearly proved to be unreliable. S.
definitely assigns this special document to a Sethian circle in Egypt,
and brings its æon-lore into close touch with Valentinian ideas. He says
nothing, unfortunately, of how this document and the other two of the
Codex--namely, *The Gospel of Mary* and *The Wisdom of Jesus
Christ*--bear on the line of descent of the doctrines of the P.S.
Doubtless he is reserving his treatment of the subject for his
long-expected edition of the whole Berlin Codex, which for the first
time will give us first-hand knowledge of second-century Gnosticism,
and, judging by what little S. has already disclosed to us, throw a
brilliant light on some of the most puzzling obscurities in the history
of the development of Gnostic doctrine.

This is a study of the greatest value from the comparative

<span id="page_lxv">p. lxv</span>

standpoint. Though Lipsius (above, 20) had already drawn attention to
the point, B. goes further by showing in detail the close connection
between some main notions of the Manichæan religion and some features of
the P.S., whereas Schmidt (1892, pp. 375, 404, 417, 564) had previously
drawn attention to isolated parallels only. In dealing with the system
of the P.S. (pp. 346-350) B. writes: "There can be no doubt at all on
the affinity between the two systems. The only possible question which
remains is whether in the P.S. and II. Jeû direct dependence on the
Manichæan system comes up for discussion, or whether a common source
underlies both systems. The latter appears to me provisionally to be the
more probable hypothesis. Many of the kindred ideas appear in the P.S.
in their more original and purer form, the figure of the Virgin of Light
has in the P.S. meaning and great importance, whereas in the Manichæan
system she is a shadowy form by the side of the Third Envoy. If the
latter supposition proves correct, Mani would have far less right of
claim to originality for his system than has hitherto seemed to be the
case."

R. H. devotes pp. 16-35 to treating of the use of the Odes in the P.S.
On p. 35 he writes: "The *Pistis Sophia*, in which the Odes are
imbedded, dates from the third century, and the author of the *Pistis*
had, as we have shown, the Odes bound up with his Canonical Psalter; at
the time intimated there was no Coptic \[Thebaic\] Bible from which the
extracts could have been made; so we may be sure the Odes were taken
from a Greek Bible, and, with almost equal certainty, that the *Pistis
Sophia* itself was a Greek book."

B., following the prevailing German view, assigns P.S. to the 2nd half
of 3rd cent.; he, however, thinks that both treatises of the Bruce Codex
are later than P.S., but does not argue this important question.

B. here, in § 10, treats of the P.S. and the C.B. as belonging to the
period when Gnosticism had got out of hand or was running wild ('*Die
Verwilderung der Gnosis*'). He does not, however, repeat his view of the
later date of C.B., and says that the eschatology of the P.S. is
strongly reminiscent of Valentinian speculations.

Coptic and Syriac and seems to blame R. Harris for using Schwartze's
Latin version instead of Schmidt's more modern rendering in his
quotations from the P.S.

"There can be little doubt that the Coptic writings (Pistis Sophia,
etc.) present a variety of the Barbelo-Gnosis" (p. 239a). P.S. was
written in Egypt at close of 3rd cent. (p. 241b). This is by no means
certain; we must wait for Schmidt's full translation and commentary on
The Apocryphon of John before any definite conclusion can be reached.

Langue copte*,' pp. 247-311.</span>

D. F. agrees with Harnack and Schmidt as to the most probable date being
the 2nd half of the 3rd cent. (p. 254). He thinks that Div. iii. is the
lost Little Questions of Mary, favouring Harnack against Schmidt, whom
he blames (p. 266) for abandoning this view in the Introduction (p.
xviii) to his Translation (above, 45), after first adopting it in his
earlier work. He thinks that Schmidt has made out his case for the two
Jell Books against the reservations of Preuschen and Liechtenhan (p.
291). D. F. is strongly opposed to the hypothesis of a Valentinian
origin (p. 251); he is also very critical of the general Ophite theory
(p. 327) and of the special Severian theory of Schmidt (p. 355). He has
no precise view of his own as to origin; but, in keeping with his
general thesis, which would make most, if not all, of the anonymous and
pseudonymous systems later and degenerate

<span id="page_lxvii">p. lxvii</span>

forms of the more metaphysical views of a Basilides, a Valentinus and a
Marcion, he is content to leave the P.S. to a later, period of
degeneration. His general metaphysical test can hardly be said to be a
criterion for history. Metaphysic does not come first; philosophizing is
a secondary stage, and this is certainly the case in the general
development of the Gnosis which starts in a strongly mythological and
apocalyptic circle of ideas.

Christianity in Egypt* (Cambridge), pp. 148-182, ch. vii., 'Some Aspects
of Gnosticism: Pistis Sophia.'</span>

After a review of contents and literature, with regard to place of
origin the author writes (p. 175): "But if of Syrian origin the scheme
betrays here and there marked signs of Egyptian influence, and the fact
that the work was sufficiently important to be translated into the
native tongue shows without doubt that the sect which inspired it was an
Egyptian branch who dwelt in Egypt." This is of course generally
evident. S.-M. thinks, however, that the question of translation may be
pressed too much. Without attempting any justification of his opinion,
he asserts that "the Coptic text is at the earliest a fifth-century work
when Gnosticism was fast dying out and could only be practised
furtively." Surely the author is here confusing the probable date of the
Askew Codex copy with the question of date of the original?

Pistis Sophia and its Related Texts.'</span>

Divv. i. and ii. presuppose belief in a system resembling those of the
Ophites and of Valentinus (p. 135). Divv. iii. and iv. are probably
Marcosian in origin (p. 173), in any case later (!) than Divv. i. and
ii. (p. 184). In this L. partially revives Bunsen's rejected theory
(above, 11). He accepts translation from a Greek original, and continues
(p. 177): "We must . . . look for an author who, though an Egyptian and
acquainted with the native Egyptian religion, would naturally have
written in Greek; and on the whole there is no one who fulfils these
requirements so well as Valentinus himself. The fact that the author
never quotes from the Gospel according to St. John indicates that it had
not come to his knowledge." L.'s criticism (pp. 161 f.) of Harnack's
parallels from this Gospel (above, 24a), however, does not seem

<span id="page_lxviii">p. lxviii</span>

to me satisfactory. The first commentary on the Fourth Gospel was made
by a Valentinian. L.'s view of authorship of the P.S. revives the
Valentinian hypothesis in its most radical form. The two books of the
Bruce Codex, which Schmidt calls 'The Books of Jeû,' are not the books
referred to in the P.S. "which therefore remains the parent document"
(p. 194).

<span class="small">58. 1918. Moffat (J.). Art. 'Pistis Sophia,' in
Hastings' *Encycl. of Relig. and Ethics* (Edinburgh), x. 45-48.</span>

This is a useful, if brief, summary of contents and prior opinions. M.
takes up a moderate position when he says that, though the P.S. is to be
assigned to some Gnostic circles in Egypt, its particular type of
Gnosticism cannot be identified. He thinks, however, on the whole that
the occurrence of the name Barbelo assigns our miscellany "to some
circle more or less allied to the pious theosophists of the 2nd cent.
whom we know as the Ophites collectively, and as the Nicolaitans,
Simonians and Barbelo-Gnostics specifically." H. thinks the Yew Books
mentioned in the P.S. can hardly be the books of C.B. I.

xliii.)</span>

The external form of this interesting and important document is an
Epistle, resembling that of the Catholic Epistles of the N.T. But
within, it passes into the form of an apocalypse, and that too of
Discourses between Jesus and his Disciples after the Resurrection. This
latter characteristic is otherwise not found in Catholic documents; it
is a Gnostic peculiarity, of which the P.S. is a classical example, the
other instances being what Schmidt calls the 'Two Books of Jeû' of the
Bruce Codex and of *The Gospel of Mary* and of *The Wisdom of Jesus
Christ* of the Berlin Codex. *The Questions of Mary*, *The Great* and
*The Little*, of Epiphanius' 'Gnostici' were also of this
post-resurrectional type of discourses (p. 206).

S. does not re-discuss the question of date of the P.S. by the light of
this new find, but it is clearly of importance, seeing that with regard
to the new document he concludes

<span id="page_lxix">p. lxix</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (p. 402): "The
Epistola Apostolorum is written by a representative of the Catholic
Church with the intention of attacking the Gnostic heresies, especially
Docetism. The country of origin is Asia Minor, and the date is the
second half of the second century, more precisely 160-170 A.D."

Odes and Psalms of Solomon*, re-edited for the Governors of the John
Rylands Library (Manchester), 2 vols. Text, 1912; Tr. and Notes,
1920.</span>

Here R. H. entirely changes his view of P.S. being a translation from
the Greek. He now thinks that (p. 117): "Unless . . . the P.S. has
substituted the Sahidic \[Bible\] version for some other version which
lay before the author, of which he has avoided the trouble of making a
fresh translation, there is a strong presumption that the P.S. is a
genuine Coptic book, and not a rendering of some other work (Greek or
Syriac) into Coptic." He rejects (p. 183) Worrell's theory (above, 53)
of a Gnostic Hymn- and Psalm-book, and criticizes (pp. 186 f.) Rahlfs'
discovery of two versions of the Psalms (above, 40). He is accordingly
opposed to the general view of translation from the Greek, and suggests
(p. 186) that the matter needs some further elucidation. It cannot,
however, be said that his argument is in any way convincing.

As to the Odes of Solomon themselves, which have produced so large and
instructive a literature since the first edition was published, their
lucky discoverer and able editor, in reviewing the whole question,
thinks we cannot go far wrong if we conclude that they were written at
Antioch in the 1st century (p. 69).
