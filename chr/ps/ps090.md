### CHAPTER 85

It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished speaking these words unto
his disciples, that Mary Magdalene started forward and said: "My Lord,
be not wroth with me if I question thee, because we question thee
concerning all with precision."

And Jesus answered and said unto Mary: "Question concerning what thou
desirest to question, and I will reveal it unto thee in openness without
similitude, and all concerning which thou questionest, I will say unto
thee with precision and certainty. I will perfect you in all power and
all fulnesses, from the interior of the interiors to the exterior of the
exteriors, from that Ineffable to the darkness of darknesses, so that ye
shall be called 'the fulnesses perfected

in all gnoses.' Now, therefore, Mary, question concerning what thou
mayest question, and I will reveal it to thee with great joy and great
exultation."

<span class="margnote">Mary again questioneth Jesus.</span>It came to
pass then, when Mary had heard the Saviour say these words, that she
rejoiced in exceedingly great joy and exulted, and said: "My Lord, will
then the men of the world who have received the mysteries of the Light,
\|<span class="rmargnote">**188**.</span> be superior to the emanations
of the Treasury in thy kingdom? For I have heard thee say: If I lead you
into the region of those who have received the mysteries of the Light,
then will the region of the \[emanations of the\] Light-land count for
you as a speck of dust because of the great distance in which it is
distant from it, and because of the great light in which it is,'--that
is the Light-land is the Treasury, the region of the emanations,--will
therefore then, my Lord, the men who have received the mysteries, be
superior to the Light-land and superior to those \[emanations\] in the
kingdom of the Light?"
