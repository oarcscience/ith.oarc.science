This is the liturgy known as the Ordinary of the Mass, derived from a
Missal with an imprimatur date of 1921. It is an example of the
Tridentine Mass, a traditional form used for about four centuries until
the mid-20th century by the Roman Catholic Church. It includes both the
Latin text, which was used during the ceremony, and an English
translation from the same edition, presented in parallel. The Vatican
decided to revise the liturgy in the 1960s, moving toward using
vernacular languages instead of Latin in their rituals, so this text
will be primarily of historical or nostalgic interest. It is also useful
for traditionalist Catholics who want a baseline reading.

Keep in mind that this is only the core text of the Latin Mass; a
standard Missal is sort of a construction kit for Masses. So it would be
inaccurate to say that this is 'The' Latin Mass. This text occupies only
ten pages out of fifteen hundred in the Missal it was transcribed from.
On any given day, there could be a special reading for the Saint of that
day, as well as a sermon based on a scripture passage, plus other
components, including portions only celebrated by priests in the absence
of the congregation. There are also special Masses and additional
prayers for funerals, dedicating a Church, the election of a Pope, and
other extraordinary events.
