### <span id="v.i.xxvii-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XXVIII. How Pope Gregory wrote to the bishop of Aries to help Augustine in the work of God. \[601 A.D.\]

<span id="v.i.xxvii-p1"></span>Thus far the answers of the holy Pope
Gregory, to the questions of the most reverend prelate, Augustine. Now
the letter, which he says he had written to the bishop of Aries, was
directed to Vergilius, successor to Aetherius, and was in the following
words:

<span id="v.i.xxvii-p2"></span>"To his most reverend and holy brother
and fellow bishop, Vergilius; Gregory, servant of the servants of God.
With how much kindness brethren, coming of their own accord, are to be
entertained, is shown by this, that they are for the most part invited
for the sake of brotherly love. Therefore, if our common brother, Bishop
Augustine, shall happen to come to you, let your love, as is becoming,
receive him with so great kindness and affection, that it may refresh
him by the benefit of its consolation and show to others how brotherly
charity is to be cultivated. And, since it often happens that those who
are at a distance first learn from others the things that need
correction, if he bring before you, my brother, any sins of bishops or
others, do you, in conjunction with him, carefully inquire into the
same, and show yourself so strict and earnest with regard to those
things which offend God and provoke His wrath, that for the amendment of
others, the punishment may fall upon the guilty, and the innocent may
not suffer under false report. God keep you in safety, most reverend
brother. Given the 22nd day of June, in the nineteenth year of the reign
of our most religious lord, Mauritius Tiberius Augustus, the eighteenth
year after the consulship of our said lord, and the fourth indiction."
