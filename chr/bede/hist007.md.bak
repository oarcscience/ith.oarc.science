### <span id="v.i.iv-p0.1"></span>CHAP. IV. How Lucius, king of Britain, writing to Pope Eleutherus, desired to be made a Christian.

<span id="v.i.iv-p1"></span>In the year of our Lord 156, Marcus
Antoninus Verus, the fourteenth from Augustus, was made emperor,
together with his brother, Aurelius Commodus. \[Editor’s note: Marcus
Antoninus Verus, commonly called Marcus Aurelius, succeeded in 161 A.D.
His colleague in the empire was his adopted brother, Lucius Verus, whose
full adoptive name was Lucius Aurelius Antoninus Verus Commodus. He died
in 169. Eleutherus became Pope between 171 and 177. Bede’s chronology is
therefore wrong.\] In their time, whilst the holy Eleutherus presided
over the Roman Church, Lucius, king of Britain, sent a letter to him,
entreating that by a mandate from him he might be made a Christian. He
soon obtained his pious request, and the Britons preserved the faith,
which they had received, uncorrupted and entire, in peace and
tranquillity until the time of the Emperor Diocletian.
