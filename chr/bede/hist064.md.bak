### <span id="v.iii.viii-p0.1"></span>CHAP. VIII. How Earconbert, King of Kent, ordered the idols to be destroyed, and of his daughter Earcongota, and his kinswoman Ethelberg, virgins consecrated to God. \[640 A.D.\]

<span id="v.iii.viii-p1"></span> IN the year of our Lord 640,
Eadbald,king of Kent, departed this life, and left his kingdom to his
son Earconbert, who governed it most nobly twenty-four years and some
months. He was the first of the English kings that of his supreme
authority commanded the idols throughout his whole kingdom to be
forsaken and destroyed, and the fast of forty days to be observed; and
that the same might not be lightly neglected, he appointed fitting and
condign punishments for the offenders. His daughter Earcongota, as
became the offspring of such a parent, was a most virtuous virgin,
serving God in a monastery in the country of the Franks, built by a most
noble abbess, named Fara, at a place called In Brige; for at that time
but few monasteries had been built in the country of the Angles, and
many were wont, for the sake of monastic life, to repair to the
monasteries of the Franks or Gauls; and they also sent their daughters
there to be instructed, and united to their Heavenly Bridegroom,
especially in the monasteries of Brige, of Cale,and Andilegum.Among whom
was also Saethryth,daughter of the wife of Anna, king of the East
Angles, above mentioned; and Ethelberg,the king’s own daughter; both of
whom, though strangers, were for their virtue made abbesses of the
monastery of Brige. Sexburg, that king’s elder daughter, wife to
Earconbert, king of Kent, had a daughter called Earcongota,of whom we
are about to speak.

<span id="v.iii.viii-p2"></span> Many wonderful works and miracles of
this virgin, dedicated to God, are to this day related by the
inhabitants of that place; but for us it shall suffice to say something
briefly of her departure out of this world to the heavenly kingdom. The
day of her summoning drawing near, she began to visit in the monastery
the cells of the infirm handmaidens of Christ, and particularly those
that were of a great age, or most noted for their virtuous life, and
humbly commending herself to their prayers, she let them know that her
death was at hand, as she had learnt by revelation, which she said she
had received in this manner. She had seen a band of men, clothed in
white, come into the monastery, and being asked by her what they wanted,
and what they did there, they answered, "They had been sent thither to
carry away with them the gold coin that had been brought thither from
Kent." Towards the close of that same night, as morning began to dawn,
leaving the darkness of this world, she departed to the light of heaven.
Many of the brethren of that monastery who were in other houses,
declared they had then plainly heard choirs of singing angels, and, as
it were, the sound of a multitude entering the monastery. Whereupon
going out immediately to see what it might be, they beheld a great light
coming down from heaven, which bore that holy soul, set loose from the
bonds of the flesh, to the eternal joys of the celestial country. They
also tell of other miracles that were wrought that night in the same
monastery by the power of God; but as we must proceed to other matters,
we leave them to be related by those whose concern they are. The body of
this venerable virgin and bride of Christ was buried in the church of
the blessed protomartyr, Stephen. It was thought fit, three days after,
to take up the stone that covered the tomb, and to raise it higher in
the same place, and whilst they were doing this, so sweet a fragrance
rose from below, that it seemed to all the brethren and sisters there
present, as if a store of balsam had been opened.

<span id="v.iii.viii-p3"></span> Her aunt also, Ethelberg, of whom we
have spoken, preserved the glory, acceptable to God, of perpetual
virginity, in a life of great self-denial, but the extent of her virtue
became more conspicuous after her death. Whilst she was abbess, she
began to build in her monastery a church, in honour of all the Apostles,
wherein she desired that her body should be buried; but when that work
was advanced half way, she was prevented by death from finishing it, and
was buried in the place in the church which she had chosen. After her
death, the brothers occupied themselves with other things, and this
structure was left untouched for seven years, at the expiration whereof
they resolved, by reason of the greatness of the work, wholly to abandon
the building of the church, and to remove the abbess’s bones thence to
some other church that was finished and consecrated. On opening her
tomb, they found the body as untouched by decay as it had been free from
the corruption of carnal concupiscence, and having washed it again and
clothed it in other garments, they removed it to the church of the
blessed Stephen, the Martyr. And her festival is wont to be celebrated
there with much honour on the 7th of July.
