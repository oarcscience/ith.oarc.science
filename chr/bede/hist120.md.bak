### <span id="v.v.ii-p0.1"></span>CHAP. II. How Bishop John cured a dumb man by his blessing. \[687 A.D.\]

<span id="v.v.ii-p1"></span>IN the beginning of Aldfrid’s reign, Bishop
Eata died, and was succeeded in the bishopric of the church of Hagustald
by the holy man John, of whom those that knew him well are wont to tell
many miracles, and more particularly Berthun, a man worthy of all
reverence and of undoubted truthfulness, and once his deacon, now abbot
of the monastery called Inderauuda, that is, "In the wood of the Deiri":
some of which miracles we have thought fit to hand on to posterity.
There is a certain remote dwelling enclosed by a mound, among scattered
trees, not far from the church of Hagustald, being about a mile and a
half distant and separated from it by the river Tyne, having an oratory
dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel, where the man of God used
frequently, as occasion offered, and specially in Lent, to abide with a
few companions and in quiet give himself to prayer and study. Having
come hither once at the beginning of Lent to stay, he bade his followers
find out some poor man labouring under any grievous infirmity, or want,
whom they might keep with them during those days, to receive alms, for
so he was always used to do.

<span id="v.v.ii-p2"></span>There was in a township not far off, a
certain youth who was dumb, known to the bishop, for he often used to
come into his presence to receive alms. He had never been able to speak
one word; besides, he had so much scurf and scab on his head, that no
hair could ever grow on the top of it, but only some rough hairs stood
on end round about it. The bishop caused this young man to be brought,
and a little hut to be made for him within the enclosure of the
dwelling, in which he might abide, and receive alms from him every day.
When one week of Lent was over, the next Sunday he bade the poor man
come to him, and when he had come, he bade him put his tongue out of his
mouth and show it him; then taking him by the chin, he made the sign of
the Holy Cross on his tongue, directing him to draw it back so signed
into his mouth and to speak. "Pronounce some word," said he; "say ‘gae,’
" which, in the language of the English, is the word of affirming and
consenting, that is, yes. The youth’s tongue was immediately loosed, and
he spoke as he was bidden. The bishop then added the names of the
letters: "Say A." He said A. "Say B;" he said B also. When he had
repeated all the letters after the bishop, the latter proceeded to put
syllables and words to him, and when he had repeated them all rightly he
bade him utter whole sentences, and he did it. Nor did he cease all that
day and the next night, as long as he could keep awake, as those who
were present relate, to say something, and to express his private
thoughts and wishes to others, which he could never do before; after the
manner of the man long lame, who, when he was healed by the Apostles
Peter and John, leaping up, stood and walked, and entered with them into
the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising the Lord, rejoicing to
have the use of his feet, which he had so long lacked. The bishop,
rejoicing with him at his cure, caused the physician to take in hand the
healing of the sores of his head. He did as he was bidden, and with the
help of the bishop’s blessing and prayers, a goodly head of hair grew as
the skin was healed. Thus the youth became fair of countenance, ready of
speech, with hair curling in comely fashion, whereas before he had been
ill-favoured, miserable, and dumb. Thus filled with joy at his recovered
health, notwithstanding that the bishop offered to keep him in his own
household, he chose rather to return home.
