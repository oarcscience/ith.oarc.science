### <span id="v.iii.vii-p0.1"></span>CHAP. VII. How the West Saxons received the Word of God by the preaching of Birinus; and of his successors, Agilbert and Leutherius. \[635-670 A. D.\]

<span id="v.iii.vii-p1"></span> AT that time, the West Saxons, formerly
called Gewissae,in the reign of Cynegils,received the faith of Christ,
through the preaching of Bishop Birinus,who came into Britain by the
counsel of Pope Honorius ; having promised in his presence that he would
sow the seed of the holy faith in the farthest inland regions of the
English, where no other teacher hadbeen before him. Hereupon at the
bidding of the Pope he received episcopal consecration from Asterius,
bishop of Genoa, but on his arrival in Britain, he first came to the
nation of the Gewissae, and finding all in that place confirmed pagans,
he thought it better to preach the Word there, than to proceed further
to seek for other hearers of his preaching.

<span id="v.iii.vii-p2"></span> Now, as he was spreading the Gospel in
the aforesaid province, it happened that when the king himself, having
received instruction as a catechumen, was being baptized together with
his people, Oswald, the most holy and victorious king of the
Northumbrians, being present, received him as he came forth from
baptism, and by an honourable alliance most acceptable to God, first
adopted as his son, thus born again and dedicated to God, the man whose
daughterhe was about to receive in marriage. The two kings gave to the
bishop the city called Dorcic,there to establish his episcopal see;
where having built and consecrated churches, and by his pious labours
called many to the Lord, he departed to the Lord, and was buried in the
same city; but many years after, when Haedde was bishop," he was
translated thence to the city of Venta,and laid in the church of the
blessed Apostles, Peter and Paul.

<span id="v.iii.vii-p3"></span> When the king died, his son Coinwalch
succeeded him on the throne, but refused to receive the faith and the
mysteries of the heavenly kingdom; and not long after he lost also the
dominion of his earthly kingdom; for he put away the sister of Penda,
king of the Mercians, whom he had married, and took another wife;
whereupon a war ensuing, he was by him deprived of his kingdom, and
withdrew to Anna, king of the East Angles, where he lived three years in
banishment, and learned and received the true faith; for the king, with
whom he lived in his banishment, was a good man, and happy in a good and
saintly offspring, as we shall show hereafter.

<span id="v.iii.vii-p4"></span>But when Coinwalch was restored to his
kingdom, there came into that province out of Ireland, a certain bishop
called Agilbert, a native of Gaul, but who had then lived a long time in
Ireland, for the purpose of reading the Scriptures. He attached himself
to the king, and voluntarily undertook the ministry of preaching. The
king, observing his learning and industry, desired him to accept an
episcopal see there and remain as the bishop of his people. Agilbert
complied with the request. And presided over that nation as their bishop
for many years. At length the king, who understood only the language of
the Saxons, weary of his barbarous tongue, privately brought into the
province another bishop, speaking his own language, by name Wini,who had
also been ordained in Gaul; and dividing his province into two dioceses,
appointed this last his episcopal see in the city of Venta, by the
Saxons called Wintancaestir. (Winchester) Agilbert, being highly
offended, that the king should do this without consulting him, returned
into Gaul, and being made bishop of the city of Paris, died there, being
old and full of days. Not many years after his departure out of Britain,
Wini was also expelled from his bishopric by the same king, and took
refuge with Wulfhere, king of the Mercians, of whom he purchased for
money the see of the city of London,and remained bishop thereof till his
death. Thus the province of the West Saxons continued no small time
without a bishop.

<span id="v.iii.vii-p5"></span> During which time, the aforesaid king of
that nation, sustaining repeatedly very great losses in his kingdom from
his enemies, at length bethought himself, that as he had been before
expelled from the throne for his unbelief, he had been restored when he
acknowledged the faith of Christ; and he perceived that his kingdom,
being deprived of a bishop, was justly deprived also of the Divine
protection. He, therefore, sent messengers into Gaul to Agilbert, with
humble apologies entreating him to return to the bishopric of his
nation. But he excused himself, and protested that he could not go,
because he was bound to the bishopric of his own city and diocese;
notwithstanding, in order to give him some help in answer to his earnest
request, he sent thither in his stead the priest Leutherius,his nephew,
to be ordained as his bishop, if he thought fit, saying that he thought
him worthy of a bishopric. The king and the people received him
honourably, and asked Theodore, then Archbishop of Canterbury, to
consecrate him as their bishop. He was accordingly consecrated in the
same city, and many years diligently governed the whole bishopric of the
West Saxons by synodical authority.
