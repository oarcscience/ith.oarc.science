### <span id="v.ii.v-p0.1"></span>CHAP. V.

<span id="v.ii.v-p1"></span> IN the year of our Lord 616, which is the
twenty-first year after Augustine and his company were sent to preach to
the English nation, Ethelbert, king of Kent, having most gloriously
governed his temporal kingdom fifty-six years, entered into the eternal
joys of the kingdom of Heaven. He was the third of the English kings who
ruled over all the southern provinces that are divided from the northern
by the river Humber and the borders contiguous to it; but the first of
all that ascended to the heavenly kingdom. The first who had the like
sovereignty was Aelli, king of the South-Saxons; the second, Caelin,
king of the West-Saxons, who, in their own language, is called Ceaulin;
the third, as has been said, was Ethelbert, king of Kent; the fourth was
Redwald, king of the East-Angles, who, even in the life-time of
Ethelbert, had been acquiring the leadership for his own race. The fifth
was Edwin, king of the Northumbrian nation, that is, of those who live
in the district to the north of the river H umber; his power was
greater; he had the overlordship over all the nations who inhabit
Britain, both English and British, except only the people of Kent; and
he reduced also under the dominion of the English, the Mevanian Islands
of the Britons, lying between Ireland and Britain; the sixth was Oswald,
the most Christian king of the Northumbrians, whose kingdom was within
the same bounds; the seventh, his brother Oswy, ruled over a kingdom of
like extent for a time, and for the most part subdued and made tributary
the nations of the Picts and Scots, who occupy the northern parts of
Britain: but of that hereafter.  
  
King Ethelbert died on the 24th day of the month of February, twenty-one
years after he had received the faith, and was buried in St. Martin's
chapel within the church of the blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, where
also lies his queen, Bertha. Among other benefits which he conferred
upon his nation in his care for them, he established, with the help of
his council of wise men, judicial decisions, after the Roman model;
which are written in the language of the English, and are still kept and
observed by them. Among which, he set down first what satisfaction
should be given by any one who should steal anything belonging to the
Church, the bishop, or the other clergy, for he was resolved to give
protection to those whom he had received along with their doctrine.  
  
This Ethelbert was the son of Irminric, whose father was Octa, whose
father was Oeric, surnamed Oisc, from whom the kings of Kent are wont to
be called Oiscings. His father was Hengist, who, being invited by
Vortigern, first came into Britain, with his son Oisc, as has been said
above.  
  
But after the death of Ethelbert, the accession of his son Eadbald
proved very harmful to the still tender growth of the new Church; for he
not only refused to accept the faith of Christ, but was also defiled
with such fornication, as the Apostle testifies, as is not so much as
named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife. By
both which crimes he gave occasion to those to return to their former
uncleanness, who, under his father, had, either for favour or fear of
the king, submitted to the laws of the faith and of a pure life. Nor did
the unbelieving king escape without the scourge of Divine severity in
chastisement and correction; for he was troubled with frequent fits of
madness, and possessed by an unclean spirit. The storm of this
disturbance was increased by the death of Sabert, king of the East
Saxons, who departing to the heavenly kingdom, left three sons, still
pagans, to inherit his temporal crown. They immediately began openly to
give themselves up to idolatry, which, during their father's lifetime,
they had seemed somewhat to abandon, and they granted free licence to
their subjects to serve idols. And when they saw the bishop, whilst
celebrating Mass in the church, give the Eucharist to the people,
filled, as they were, with folly and ignorance, they said to him, as is
commonly reported, "Why do you not give us also that white bread, which
you used to give to our father Saba (for so they were wont to call him),
and which you still continue to give to the people in the church?" To
whom he answered, "If you will be washed in that font of salvation, in
which your father was washed, you may also partake of the holy Bread of
which he partook; but if you despise the laver of life, you can in no
wise receive the Bread of life." They replied, "We will not enter into
that font, because we know that we do not stand in need of it, and yet
we will be refreshed by that bread." And being often earnestly
admonished by him, that this could by no means be done, nor would any
one be admitted to partake of the sacred Oblation without the holy
cleansing, at last, they said, filled with rage, "If you will not comply
with us in so small a matter as that which we require, you shall not
stay in our province." And they drove him out and bade him and his
company depart from their kingdom. Being driven thence, he came into
Kent, to take counsel with his fellow bishops, Laurentius and Justus,
and learn what was to be done in that case; and with one consent they
determined that it was better for them all to return to their own
country, where they might serve God in freedom of mind, than to continue
to no purpose among barbarians, who had revolted from the faith.
Mellitus and Justus accordingly went away first, and withdrew into the
parts of Gaul, intending there to await the event. But the kings, who
had driven from them the herald of the truth, did not continue long
unpunished in their worship of devils. For marching out to battle
against the nation of the Gewissi, they were all slain with their army.
Nevertheless, the people having been once turned to wickedness, though
the authors of it were destroyed, would not be corrected, nor return to
the unity of faith and charity which is in Christ.
