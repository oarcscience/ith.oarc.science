THE same pope also wrote to King Edwin's consort, Ethelberg, to this
effect:  
  
THE COPY OF THE LETTER OF THE MOST BLESSED AND APOSTOLIC BONIFACE, POPE
OF THE CITY OF ROME, TO ETHELBERG, KING EDWIN'S QUEEN.  
  
"To the illustrious lady his daughter, Queen Ethelberg, Boniface,
bishop, servant of the servants of God. The goodness of our Redeemer has
in His abundant Providence offered the means of salvation to the human
race, which He rescued, by the shedding of His precious Blood, from the
bonds of captivity to the Devil; to the end that, when He had made known
His name in divers ways to the nations, they might acknowledge their
Creator by embracing the mystery of the Christian faith. And this the
mystical purification of your regeneration plainly shows to have been
bestowed upon the mind of your Highness by God's gift. Our heart,
therefore, has greatly rejoiced in the benefit bestowed by the bounty of
the Lord, for that He has vouchsafed, in your confession, to kindle a
spark of the orthodox religion, by which He might the more easily
inflame with the love of Himself the understanding, not only of your
illustrious consort, but also of all the nation that is subject to
you.  
  
"For we have been informed by those, who came to acquaint us with the
laudable conversion of our illustrious son, King Eadbald, that your
Highness, also, having received the wonderful mystery of the Christian
faith, continually excels in the performance of works pious and
acceptable to God; that you likewise carefully refrain from the worship
of idols, and the deceits of temples and auguries, and with unimpaired
devotion, give yourself so wholly to the love of your Redeemer, as never
to cease from lending your aid in spreading the Christian faith. But
when our fatherly love earnestly inquired concerning your illustrious
consort, we were given to understand, that he still served abominable
idols, and delayed to yield obedience in giving ear to the voice of the
preachers. This occasioned us no small grief, that he that is one flesh
with you still remained a stranger to the knowledge of the supreme and
undivided Trinity. Whereupon we, in our fatherly care, have not delayed
to admonish and exhort your Christian Highness, to the end that, filled
with the support of the Divine inspiration, you should not defer to
strive, both in season and out of season, that with the co-operating
power of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, your husband also may be
added to the number of Christians; that so you may uphold the rights of
marriage in the bond of a holy and unblemished union. For it is written,
'They twain shall be one flesh.' How then can it be said, that there is
unity in the bond between you, if he continues a stranger to the
brightness of your faith, separated from it by the darkness of
detestable error?  
  
"Wherefore, applying yourself continually to prayer, do not cease to beg
of the long-suffering of the Divine Mercy the benefits of his
illumination; to the end, that those whom the union of carnal affection
has manifestly made in a manner to be one body, may, after this life
continue in perpetual fellowship, by the unity of faith. Persist,
therefore, illustrious daughter, and to the utmost of your power
endeavour to soften the hardness of his heart by carefully making known
to him the Divine precepts; pouring into his mind a knowledge of the
greatness of that mystery which you have received by faith, and of the
marvellous reward which, by the new birth, you have been made worthy to
obtain. Inflame the coldness of his heart by the message of the Holy
Ghost, that he may put from him the deadness of an evil worship, and the
warmth of the Divine faith may kindle his understanding through your
frequent exhortations; and so the testimony of Holy Scripture may shine
forth clearly, fulfilled by you, 'The unbelieving husband shall be saved
by the believing wife.' For to this end you have obtained the mercy of
the Lord's goodness, that you might restore with increase to your
Redeemer the fruit of faith and of the benefits entrusted to your hands.
That you may be able to fulfil this task, supported by the help of His
loving kindness we do not cease to implore with frequent prayers.  
  
"Having premised thus much, in pursuance of the duty of our fatherly
affection, we exhort you, that when the opportunity of a bearer shall
offer, you will with all speed comfort us with the glad tidings of the
wonderful work which the heavenly Power shall vouchsafe to perform by
your means in the conversion of your consort, and of the nation subject
to you; to the end, that our solicitude, which earnestly awaits the
fulfilment of its desire in the soul's salvation of you and yours, may,
by hearing from you, be set at rest; and that we, discerning more fully
the light of the Divine propitiation shed abroad in you, may with a
joyful confession abundantly return due thanks to God, the Giver of all
good things, and to the blessed Peter, the chief of the Apostles.  
  
We have, moreover, sent you the blessing of your protector, the blessed
Peter, the chief of the Apostles, to wit, a silver looking-glass, and a
gilded ivory comb, which we pray your Highness to accept with all the
goodwill with which it is sent by us.
