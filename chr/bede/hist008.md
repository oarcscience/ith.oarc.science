### <span id="v.i.v-p0.1"></span>CHAP. V. How the Emperor Severus divided from the rest by a rampart that part of Britain which had been recovered.

<span id="v.i.v-p1"></span>In the year of our Lord 189, Severus, an
African, born at Leptis, in the province of Tripolis, became emperor. He
was the seventeenth from Augustus; and reigned seventeen years. Being
naturally of a harsh disposition, and engaged in many wars, he governed
the state vigorously, but with much trouble. Having been victorious in
all the grievous civil wars which happened in his time, he was drawn
into Britain by the revolt of almost all the confederated tribes; and,
after many great and severe battles, he thought fit to divide that part
of the island, which he had recovered, from the other unconquered
nations, not with a wall, as some imagine, but with a rampart. For a
wall is made of stones, but a rampart, with which camps are fortified to
repel the assaults of enemies, is made of sods, cut out of the earth,
and raised high above the ground, like a wall, having in front of it the
trench whence the sods were taken, with strong stakes of wood fixed
above it. Thus Severus drew a great trench and strong rampart, fortified
with several towers, from sea to sea. And there, at York, he fell sick
afterwards and died, leaving two sons, Bassianus and Geta; of whom Geta
died, adjudged an enemy of the State; but Bassianus, having taken the
surname of Antonius, obtained the empire.
