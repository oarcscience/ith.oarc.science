### <span id="v.iv.xxxii-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XXXII. Of one who was lately cured of a disease in his eye at the relics of St. Cuthbert.

<span id="v.iv.xxxii-p1"></span>NOR is that cure to be passed over in
silence, which was performed by his relics three years ago, and was told
me lately by the brother himself, on whom it was wrought. It happened in
the monastery, which, being built near the river Dacore,has taken its
name from the same, over which, at that time, the religious
Suidbertpresided as abbot. In that monastery was a youth whose eyelid
was disfigured by an unsightly tumour, which growing daily greater,
threatened the loss of the eye. The physicians endeavoured to mitigate
it by applying ointments, but in vain. Some said it ought to be cut off;
others opposed this course, for fear of greater danger. The brother
having long laboured under this malady, when no human means availed to
save his eye, but rather, it grew daily worse, on a sudden, through the
grace of the mercy of God, it came to pass that he was cured by the
relics of the holy father, Cuthbert. For when the brethren found his
body uncorrupted, after having been many years buried, they took some
part of the hair, to give, as relics, to friends who asked for them, or
to show, in testimony of the miracle.

<span id="v.iv.xxxii-p2"></span>One of the priests of the monastery,
named Thruidred, who is now abbot there, had a small part of these
relics by him at that time. One day he went into the church and opened
the box of relics, to give some part of them to a friend who asked for
it, and it happened that the youth who had the diseased eye was then in
the church. The priest, having given his friend as much as he thought
fit, gave the rest to the youth to put back into its place. But he
having received the hairs of the holy head, prompted by some salutary
impulse, applied them to the diseased eyelid, and endeavoured for some
time, by the application of them, to abate and mitigate the tumour.
Having done this, he again laid the relics in the box, as he had been
bidden, believing that his eye would soon be cured by the hairs of the
man of God, which had touched it; nor did his faith disappoint him. It
was then, as he is wont to relate, about the second hour of the day; but
while he was occupied with other thoughts and business of the day, on a
sudden, about the sixth hour of the same, touching his eye, he found it
and the eyelid as sound as if there never had been any disfigurement or
tumour on it.
