			 <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="v.iv.xx-p0.1"></A>CHAP. XX. A Hymn concerning her.</h3> 

			 <p><a name="v.iv.xx-p1"></A>IT seems fitting to insert in this history a hymn concerning virginity, which we composed in elegiac verse many years ago, in praise and honour of the same queen and bride of Christ, and therefore truly a queen, because the bride of Christ; and to imitate the method of Holy Scripture, wherein many songs are inserted in the history, and these, as is well known, are composed in metre and verse.</p>

			 <p><a name="v.iv.xx-p2"></A>"Trinity,Gracious, Divine, Who rulest all the ages; favour my task, Trinity, Gracious, Divine.<br>
				"Let Maro sound the trumpet of war, let us sing the gifts of peace; the gifts of Christ we sing, let Maro sound the trumpet of war.</p>

			 <p><a name="v.iv.xx-p3"></A>"Chaste is my song, no rape of guilty Helen; light tales shall be told by the wanton, chaste is my song.<br>
				"I will tell of gifts from Heaven, not wars of hapless Troy; I will tell of gifts from Heaven, wherein the earth is glad.<br>
				"Lo! the high God comes to the womb of a holy virgin, to be the Saviour of men, lo! the high God comes.<br>
				"A hallowed maid gives birth to Him Who gave the world its being; Mary, the gate of God, a maiden gives Him, birth.<br>
				"The company of her fellows rejoices over the Virgin Mother of Him Who wields the thunder; a shining virgin band, the company of her fellows rejoices.<br>
				"Her honour has made many a blossom to spring from that pure shoot, virgin blossoms her honour has made to spring.<br>
				"Scorched by the fierce flames, the maiden Agatha yielded not; in like manner Eulalia endures, scorched by the fierce flames.<br>
				"The lofty soul of chaste Tecla overcomes the wild beasts; chaste Euphemia overcomes the accursed wild beasts.<br>
				"Agnes joyously laughs at the sword, herself stronger than steel, Cecilia joyously laughs at the foemen's sword.<br>
				"Many a triumph is mighty throughout the world in temperate hearts; throughout the world love of the temperate life is mighty.<br>
				"Yea, and our day likewise a peerless maiden has blessed; peerless our Ethelthryth shines.<br>
				"Child of a noble sire, and glorious by royal birth, more noble in her Lord&#8217;s sight, the child of a noble sire.<br>
				"Thence she receives queenly honour and a sceptre in this world; thence she receives honour, awaiting higher honour above.<br>
				"What need, gracious lady, to seek an earthly lord, even now given to the Heavenly Bridegroom?<br>
				"Christ is at hand, the Bridegroom (why seek an earthly lord?) that thou mayst follow even now, methinks, in the steps of the Mother of Heaven&#8217;s King, that thou too mayst be a mother in God.<br>
				"Twelve years she had reigned, a bride dedicated to God, then in the cloister dwelt, a bride dedicated to God.<br>
				"To Heaven all consecrated she lived, abounding in lofty deeds, then to Heaven all consecrated she gave up her soul.<br>
				"Twice eight Novembers the maid&#8217;s fair flesh lay in the tomb, nor did the maid&#8217;s fair flesh see corruption in the tomb.<br>
				"This was Thy work, O Christ, that her very garments were bright and undefiled even in the grave; O Christ, this was Thy work.<br>
				"The dark serpentflies before the honour due to the holy raiment; disease is driven away, and the dark serpent flies.<br>
				Rage fills the foe who of old conquered Eve; exultant the maiden triumphs and rage fills the foe.<br>
				"Behold, O bride of God, thy glory upon earth; the glory that awaits thee in the Heavens behold, O bride of God.<br>
				"In gladness thou receivest gifts, bright amidst the festal torches; behold! the Bridegroom comes, in gladness thou receivest gifts.<br>
				"And a new song thou singest to the tuneful harp; a new-made bride, thou exultest in the tuneful hymn.<br>
				"None can part her from them which follow the Lamb enthroned on high, whom none had severed from the Love enthroned on high."</p>
