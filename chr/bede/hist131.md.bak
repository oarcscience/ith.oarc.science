### <span id="v.v.xiii-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XIV. How another in like manner, being at the point of death, saw the place of punishment appointed for him in Hell.

<span id="v.v.xiii-p1"></span>I MYSELF knew a brother, would to God I
had not known him, whose name I could mention if it were of any avail,
dwelling in a famous monastery, but himself living infamously. He was
oftentimes rebuked by the brethren and elders of the place, and
admonished to be converted to a more chastened life; and though he would
not give ear to them, they bore with him long and patiently, on account
of their need of his outward service, for he was a cunning artificer.
But he was much given to drunkenness, and other pleasures of a careless
life, and more used to stop in his workshop day and night, than to go to
church to sing and pray and hear the Word of life with the brethren. For
which reason it befell him according to the saying, that he who will not
willingly humble himself and enter the gate of the church must needs be
led against his will into the gate of Hell, being damned. For he falling
sick, and being brought to extremity, called the brethren, and with much
lamentation, like one damned, began to tell them, that he saw Hell
opened, and Satan sunk in the depths thereof; and Caiaphas, with the
others that slew our Lord, hard by him, delivered up to avenging flames.
"In whose neighbourhood," said he, "I see a place of eternal perdition
prepared for me, miserable wretch that I am." The brothers, hearing
these words, began diligently to exhort him, that he should repent even
then, whilst he was still in the flesh. He answered in despair, "There
is no time for me now to change my course of life, when I have myself
seen my judgement passed."

<span id="v.v.xiii-p2"></span>Whilst uttering these words, he died
without having received the saving Viaticum, and his body was buried in
the farthest parts of the monastery, nor did any one dare either to say
Masses or sing psalms, or even to pray for him. Oh how far asunder hath
God put light from darkness! The blessed Stephen, the first martyr,
being about to suffer death for the truth, saw the heavens opened, and
the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God; and where
he was to be after death, there he fixed the eyes of his mind, that he
might die the more joyfully. But this workman, of darkened mind and
life, when death was at hand, saw Hell opened, and witnessed the
damnation of the Devil and his followers; he saw also, unhappy wretch!
his own prison among them, to the end that, despairing of salvation, he
might himself die the more miserably, but might by his perdition afford
cause of salvation to the living, who should hear of it. This befell of
late in the province of the Bernicians, and being noised abroad far and
near, inclined many to do penance for their sins without delay. Would to
God that this also might come to pass through the reading of our words!
