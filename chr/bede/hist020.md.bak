### <span id="v.i.xvii-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XVIII. How the same holy man gave sight to the blind daughter of a tribune, and then coming to St. Alban, there received of his relics, and left other relics of the blessed Apostles and other martyrs. \[429 A.D.\]

<span id="v.i.xvii-p1"></span>After this, a certain man, who held the
office of tribune, came forward with his wife, and brought his blind
daughter, a child of ten years of age, to be healed of the bishops. They
ordered her to be brought to their adversaries, who, being rebuked by
their own conscience, joined their entreaties to those of the child’s
parents, and besought the bishops that she might be healed. They,
therefore, perceiving their adversaries to yield, poured forth a short
prayer, and then Germanus, full of the Holy Ghost, invoking the Trinity,
at once drew from his side a casket which hung about his neck,
containing relics of the saints, and, taking it in his hands, applied it
in the sight of all to the girl’s eyes, which were immediately delivered
from darkness and filled with the light of truth. The parents rejoiced,
and the people were filled with awe at the miracle; and after that day,
the heretical beliefs were so fully obliterated from the minds of all,
that they thirsted for and sought after the doctrine of the bishops.

<span id="v.i.xvii-p2"></span>This damnable heresy being thus
suppressed, and the authors thereof confuted, and all the people settled
in the purity of the faith, the bishops went to the tomb of the martyr,
the blessed Alban, to give thanks to God through him. There Germanus,
having with him relics of all the Apostles, and of divers martyrs, after
offering up his prayers, commanded the tomb to be opened, that he might
lay therein the precious gifts; judging it fitting, that the limbs of
saints brought together from divers countries, as their equal merits had
procured them admission into heaven, should find shelter in one tomb.
These being honourably bestowed, and laid together, he took up a handful
of dust from the place where the blessed martyr’s blood had been shed,
to carry away with him. In this dust the blood had been preserved,
showing that the slaughter of the martyrs was red, though the persecutor
was pale in death.’ In consequence of these things, an innumerable
multitude of people was that day converted to the Lord.

his prayers quenched a fire \[429 A.D.\]](hist021.md)
