### <span id="v.v.x-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XI. How the venerable Suidbert in Britain, and Wilbrord at Rome, were ordained bishops for Frisland. \[692 A.D.\]

<span id="v.v.x-p1"></span>AT their first coming into Frisland, as soon
as Wilbrord found that he had leave given him by the prince to preach
there, he made haste to go to Rome, where Pope Sergius then presided
over the Apostolic see, that he might undertake the desired work of
preaching the Gospel to the nations, with his licence and blessing; and
hoping to receive of him some relics of the blessed Apostles and martyrs
of Christ; to the end, that when he destroyed the idols, and erected
churches in the nation to which he preached, he might have the relics of
saints at hand to put into them, and having deposited them there, might
accordingly dedicate each of those places to the honour of the saint
whose relics they were. He desired also there to learn or to receive
many other things needful for so great a work. Having obtained his
desire in all these matters, he returned to preach.

<span id="v.v.x-p2"></span>At which time, the brothers who were in
Frisland, attending on the ministry of the Word, chose out of their own
number a man of sober life, and meek of heart, called Suidbert, to be
ordained bishop for them. He, being sent into Britain, was consecrated,
at their request, by the most reverend Bishop Wilfrid, who, having been
driven out of his country, chanced then to be living in banishment among
the Mercians; for Kent had no bishop at that time, Theodore being dead,
and Bertwald, his successor, who had gone beyond the sea to be ordained,
having not yet returned to his episcopal see.

<span id="v.v.x-p3"></span>The said Suidbert, being made bishop,
returned from Britain, and not long after departed to the Boructuari;
and by his preaching brought many of them into the way of truth; but the
Boructuari being not long after subdued by the Old Saxons, those who had
received the Word were dispersed abroad; and the bishop himself with
certain others went to Pippin, who, at the request of his wife,
Blithryda, gave him a place of abode in a certain island on the Rhine,
called in their tongue, Inlitore; there he built a monastery, which his
successors still possess, and for a time dwelt in it, leading a most
continent life, and there ended his days.

<span id="v.v.x-p4"></span>When they who had gone thither had spent some
years teaching in Frisland, Pippin, with the consent of them all, sent
the venerable Wilbrord to Rome, where Sergius was still pope, desiring
that he might be consecrated archbishop over the nation of the Frisians;
which was accordingly done, as he had made request, in the year of our
Lord 696. He was consecrated in the church of the Holy Martyr Cecilia,
on her festival; and the said pope gave him the name of Clement, and
forthwith sent him back to his bishopric, to wit, fourteen days after
his arrival in the city.

<span id="v.v.x-p5"></span>Pippin gave him a place for his episcopal
see, in his famous fort, which in the ancient language of those people
is called Wiltaburg, that is, the town of the Wilts; but, in the Gallic
tongue, Trajectum. The most reverend prelate having built a church
there, and preaching the Word of faith far and near, drew many from
their errors, and built many churches and not a few monasteries. For not
long after he himself constituted other bishops in those parts from the
number of the brethren that either came with him or after him to preach
there; of whom some are now fallen asleep in the Lord; but Wilbrord
himself, surnamed Clement, is still living, venerable for his great age,
having been thirty-six years a bishop, and now, after manifold conflicts
of the heavenly warfare, he longs with all his heart for the recompense
of the reward in Heaven.’
