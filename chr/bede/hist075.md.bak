### <span id="v.iii.xix-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XIX. How Fursa built a monastery among the East Angles, and of his visions and sanctity, to which, his flesh remaining uncorrupted after death bore testimony. \[Circ. 633 A.D.\]

<span id="v.iii.xix-p1"></span> WHILST Sigbert still governed the
kingdom, there came out of Ireland a holy man called Fursa, renowned
both for his words and actions, and remarkable for singular virtues,
being desirous to live as a stranger and pilgrim for the Lord’s sake,
wherever an opportunity should offer. On coming into the province of the
East Angles, he was honourably received by the aforesaid king, and
performing his wonted task of preaching the Gospel, by the example of
his virtue and the influence of his words, converted many unbelievers to
Christ, and confirmed in the faith and love of Christ those that already
believed.

<span id="v.iii.xix-p2"></span> Here he fell into some infirmity of
body, and was thought worthy to see a vision of angels; in which he was
admonished diligently to persevere in the ministry of the Word which he
had undertaken, and indefatigably to apply himself to his usual watching
and prayers; inasmuch as his end was certain, but the hour thereof
uncertain, according to the saying of our Lord, "Watch therefore, for ye
know neither the day nor the hour." Being confirmed by this vision, he
set himself with all speed to build a monastery on the ground which had
been given him by King Sigbert, and to establish a rule of life therein.
This monastery was pleasantly situated in the woods, near the sea; it
was built within the area of a fort, which in the English language is
called Cnobheresburg, that is, Cnobhere’s Town; afterwards, Anna, king
of that province, and certain of the nobles, embellished it with more
stately buildings and with gifts.

<span id="v.iii.xix-p3"></span> This man was of noble Scottishblood, but
much more noble in mind than in birth. From his boyish years, he had
earnestly applied himself to reading sacred books and observing monastic
discipline, and, as is most fitting for holy men, he carefully practised
all that he learned to be right.

<span id="v.iii.xix-p4"></span> Now, in course of time he himself built
a monastery, wherein he might with more freedom devote himself to his
heavenly studies. There, falling sick, as the book concerning his life
clearly informs us, he fell into a trance, and quitting his body from
the evening till cockcrow, he accounted worthy to behold the sight of
the choirs of angels, and to hear their glad songs of praise. He was
wont to declare, that among other things he distinctly heard this
refrain: "The saints shall go from strength to strength."And again, "The
God of gods shall be seen in Sion." Being restored to his body, and
again taken from it three days after, he not only saw the greater joys
of the blessed, but also fierce conflicts of evil spirits, who by
frequent accusations wickedly endeavoured to obstruct his journey to
heaven; but the angels protected him, and all their endeavours were in
vain. Concerning all these matters, if any one desires to be more fully
informed, to wit, with what subtlety of deceit the devils recounted both
his actions and idle words, and even his thoughts, as if they had been
written down in a book; and what joyous or grievous tidings he learned
from the holy angels and just men who appeared to him among the angels;
let him read the little book of his life which I have mentioned, and I
doubt not that he will thereby reap much spiritual profit.

<span id="v.iii.xix-p5"></span> But there is one thing among the rest,
which we have thought it may be beneficial to many to insert in this
history. When he had been taken up on high, he was bidden by the angels
that conducted him to look back upon the world. Upon which, casting his
eyes downward, he saw, as it were, a dark valley in the depths
underneath him. He also saw four fires in the air, not far distant from
each other. Then asking the angels, what fires those were, he was told,
they were the fires which would kindle and consume the world. One of
them was of falsehood, when we do not fulfil that which we promised in
Baptism, to renounce the Devil and all his works. The next was of
covetousness, when we prefer the riches of the world to the love of
heavenly things. The third was of discord, when we do not fear to offend
our neighbour even in needless things. The fourth was of ruthlessness
when we think it a light thing to rob and to defraud the weak. These
fires, increasing by degrees, extended so as to meet one another, and
united in one immense flame. When it drew near, fearing for himself, he
said to the angel, "Lord, behold the fire draws near to me." The angel
answered, "That which you did not kindle will not burn you; for though
this appears to be a terrible and great pyre, yet it tries every man
according to the merits of his works; for every man’s concupiscence
shall burn in this fire; for as a man burns in the body through unlawful
pleasure, so, when set free from the body, he shall burn by the
punishment which he has deserved."

<span id="v.iii.xix-p6"></span> Then he saw one of the three angels, who
had been his guides throughout both visions, go before and divide the
flaming fires, whilst the other two, flying about on both sides,
defended him from the danger of the fire. He also saw devils flying
through the fire, raising the flames of war against the just. Then
followed accusations of the envious spirits against himself, the defence
of the good spirits, and a fuller vision of the heavenly hosts; as also
of holy men of his own nation, who, as he had learnt, had worthily held
the office of priesthood in old times, and who were known to fame; from
whom he heard many things very salutary to himself, and to all others
that would listen to them. When they had ended their discourse, and
returned to Heaven with the angelic spirits, there remained with the
blessed Fursa, the three angels of whom we have spoken before, and who
were to bring him back to the body. And when they approached the
aforesaid great fire, the angel divided the flame, as he had done
before; but when the man of God came to the passage so opened amidst the
flames, the unclean spirits, laying hold of one of those whom they were
burning in the fire, cast him against him, and, touching his shoulder
and jaw, scorched them. He knew the man, and called to mind that he had
received his garment when he died. The holy angel, immediately laying
hold of the man, threw him back into the fire, and the malignant enemy
said, "Do not reject him whom you before received; for as you received
the goods of the sinner, so you ought to share in his punishment." But
the angel withstood him, saying, "He did not receive them through
avarice, but in order to save his soul." The fire ceased, and the angel,
turning to him, said, "That which you kindled burned you; for if you had
not received the money of this man that died in his sins, his punishment
would not burn you." And he went on to speak with wholesome counsel of
what ought to be done for the salvation of such as repented in the hour
of death.

<span id="v.iii.xix-p7"></span> Being afterwards restored to the body,
throughout the whole course of his life he bore the mark of the fire
which he had felt in the spirit, visible to all men on his shoulder and
jaw; and the flesh openly showed, in a wonderful manner, what the spirit
had suffered in secret. He always took care, as he had done before, to
teach all men the practice of virtue, as well by his example, as by
preaching. But as for the story of his visions, he would only relate
them to those who, from desire of repentance, questioned him about them.
An aged brother of our monastery is still living, who is wont to relate
that a very truthful and religious man told him, that he had seen Fursa
himself in the province of the East Angles, and heard those visions from
his lips; adding, that though it was in severe winter weather and a hard
frost, and the man was sitting in a thin garment when he told the story,
yet he sweated as if it had been in the heat of mid-summer, by reason of
the great terror or joy of which he spoke.

<span id="v.iii.xix-p8"></span> To return to what we were saying before,
when, after preaching the Word of God many years in Scotland, he could
not well endure the disturbance of the crowds that resorted to him,
leaving all that he looked upon as his own, he departed from his native
island, and came with a few brothers through the Britons into the
province of the English, and preaching the Word there, as has been said,
built a famous monastery.When this was duly carried out, he became
desirous to rid himself of all business of this world, and even of the
monastery itself, and forthwith left the care of it and of its souls, to
his brother Fullan, and the priests Gobban and Dicull,and being himself
free from all worldly affairs, resolved to end his life as a hermit. He
had another brother called Ultan, who, after a long monastic probation,
had also adopted the life of an anchorite. So, seeking him out alone, he
lived a whole year with him in self-denial and prayer, and laboured
daily with his hands.

<span id="v.iii.xix-p9"></span> Afterwards seeing the province thrown
into confusion by the irruptions of the pagans,and foreseeing that the
monasteries would also be in danger, he left all things in order, and
sailed over into Gaul, and being there honourably entertained by Clovis,
king of the Franks, or by the patrician Ercinwald, he built a monastery
in the place called Latineacum,2and falling sick not long after,
departed this life. The same Ercinwald, the patrician, took his body,
and kept it in the porch of a church he was building in his town of
Perrona, till the church itself should be dedicated. This happened
twenty-seven days after, and the body being taken from the porch, to be
re-buried near the altar, was found as whole as if he had died that very
hour. And again, four years after, when a more beautiful shrine had been
built to receive his body to the east of the altar, it was still found
without taint of corruption, and was translated thither with due honour;
where it is well known that his merits, through the divine operation,
have been declared by many miracles. We have briefly touched upon these
matters as well as the incorruption of his body, that the lofty nature
of the man may be better known to our readers. All which, as also
concerning the comrades of his warfare, whosoever will read it, will
find more fully described in the book of his life.
