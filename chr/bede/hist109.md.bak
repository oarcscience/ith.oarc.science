### <span id="v.iv.xxiii-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XXIII. Of the life and death of the Abbess Hilda. \[614-680 A.D.\]

<span id="v.iv.xxiii-p1"></span>IN the year after this, that is the year
of our Lord 680, the most religious handmaid of Christ, Hilda,abbess of
the monastery that is called Streanaeshalch,as we mentioned above, after
having done many heavenly deeds on earth, passed thence to receive the
rewards of the heavenly life, on the 17th of November, at the age of
sixty-six years. Her life falls into two equal parts, for the first
thirty-three years of it she spent living most nobly in the secular
habit; and still more nobly dedicated the remaining half to the Lord in
the monastic life. For she was nobly born, being the daughter of
Hereric, nephew to King Edwin, and with that king she also received the
faith and mysteries of Christ, at the preaching of Paulinus, of blessed
memory,the first bishop of the Northumbrians, and preserved the same
undefiled till she attained to the vision of our Lord in Heaven.

<span id="v.iv.xxiii-p2"></span>When she had resolved to quit the
secular habit, and to serve Him alone, she withdrew into the province of
the East Angles, for she was allied to the king there; being desirous to
cross over thence into Gaul, forsaking her native country and all that
she had, and so to live a stranger for our Lord’s sake in the monastery
of Cale, that she might the better attain to the eternal country in
heaven. For her sister Heresuid, mother to Aldwulf, king of the East
Angles, was at that time living in the same monastery, under regular
discipline, waiting for an everlasting crown; and led by her example,
she continued a whole year in the aforesaid province, with the design of
going abroad; but afterwards, Bishop Aidan recalled her to her home, and
she received land to the extent of one family on the north side of the
river Wear; where likewise for a year she led a monastic life, with very
few companions.

<span id="v.iv.xxiii-p3"></span>After this she was made abbess in the
monastery called Heruteu, (Hartlepool) which monastery had been founded,
not long before, by the pious handmaid of Christ, Heiu, who is said to
have been the first woman in the province of the Northumbrians who took
upon her the vows and habit of a nun, being consecrated by Bishop Aidan;
but she, soon after she had founded that monastery, retired to the city
of Calcaria,which is called Kaelcacaestir (Tadcaster)by the English, and
there fixed her dwelling. Hilda, the handmaid of Christ, being set over
that monastery, began immediately to order it in all things under a rule
of life, according as she had been instructed by learned men; for Bishop
Aidan, and others of the religious that knew her, frequently visited her
and loved her heartily, and diligently instructed her, because of her
innate wisdom and love of the service of God.

<span id="v.iv.xxiii-p4"></span>When she had for some years governed
this monastery, wholly intent upon establishing a rule of life, it
happened that she also undertook either to build or to set in order a
monastery in the place called Streanaeshalch, and this work which was
laid upon her she industriously performed; for she put this monastery
under the same rule of monastic life as the former; and taught there the
strict observance of justice, piety, chastity, and other virtues, and
particularly of peace and charity; so that, after the example of the
primitive Church, no one there was rich, and none poor, for they had all
things common, and none had any private property. Her prudence was so
great, that not only meaner men in their need, but sometimes even kings
and princes, sought and received her counsel; she obliged those who were
under her direction to give so much time to reading of the Holy
Scriptures, and to exercise themselves so much in works of justice, that
many might readily be found there fit for the priesthood and the service
of the altar.

<span id="v.iv.xxiii-p5"></span>Indeed we have seen five from that
monastery who afterwards became bishops, and all of them men of singular
merit and sanctity, whose names were Bosa,Aetla, Oftfor, John,and
Wilfrid.Of the first we have said above that he was consecrated bishop
of York; of the second, it may be briefly stated that he was appointed
bishop of Dorchester. Of the last two we shall tell hereafter, that the
former was ordained bishop of Hagustald, the other of the church of
York; of the third, we may here mention that, having applied himself to
the reading and observance of the Scriptures in both the monasteries of
the Abbess Hilda,at length being desirous to attain to greater
perfection, he went into Kent, to Archbishop Theodore, of blessed
memory; where having spent some time in sacred studies, he resolved to
go to Rome also, which, in those days, was esteemed a very salutary
undertaking. Returning thence into Britain, he took his way into the
province of the Hwiccas,where King Osric then ruled,and continued there
a long time, preaching the Word of faith, and showing an example of good
life to all that saw and heard him. At that time, Bosel, the bishop of
that province,laboured under such weakness of body, that he could not
himself perform episcopal functions; for which reason, Oftfor was, by
universal consent, chosen bishop in his stead, and by order of King
Ethelred, consecrated by Bishop Wilfrid,of blessed memory, who was then
Bishop of the Midland Angles, because Archbishop Theodore was dead, and
no other bishop ordained in his place. A little while before, that is,
before the election of the aforesaid man of God, Bosel, Tatfrid,a man of
great industry and learning, and of excellent ability, had been chosen
bishop for that province, from the monastery of the same abbess, but had
been snatched away by an untimely death, before he could be ordained.

<span id="v.iv.xxiii-p6"></span>Thus this handmaid of Christ, the Abbess
Hilda, whom all that knew her called Mother, for her singular piety and
grace, was not only an example of good life, to those that lived in her
monastery, but afforded occasion of amendment and salvation to many who
lived at a distance, to whom the blessed fame was brought of her
industry and virtue. For it was meet that the dream of her mother,
Bregusuid, during her infancy, should be fulfilled. Now Bregusuid, at
the time that her husband, Hereric, lived in banishment, under
Cerdic,king of the Britons, where he was also poisoned, fancied, in a
dream, that he was suddenly taken away from her and she was seeking for
him most carefully, but could find no sign of him anywhere. After an
anxious search for him, all at once she found a most precious necklace
under her garment, and whilst she was looking on it very attentively, it
seemed to shine forth with such a blaze of light that it filled all
Britain with the glory of its brilliance. This dream was doubtless
fulfilled in her daughter that we speak of, whose life was an example of
the works of light, not only blessed to herself, but to many who desired
to live aright.

<span id="v.iv.xxiii-p7"></span>When she had governed this monastery
many years, it pleased Him Who has made such merciful provision for our
salvation, to give her holy soul the trial of a long infirmity of the
flesh, to the end that, according to the Apostle’s example, her virtue
might be made perfect in weakness. Struck down with a fever, she
suffered from a burning heat, and was afflicted with the same trouble
for six years continually; during all which time she never failed either
to return thanks to her Maker, or publicly and privately to instruct the
flock committed to her charge; for taught by her own experience she
admonished all men to serve the Lord dutifully, when health of body is
granted to them, and always to return thanks faithfully to Him in
adversity, or bodily infirmity. In the seventh year of her sickness,
when the disease turned inwards, her last day came, and about cockcrow,
having received the voyage provision of Holy Housel, and called together
the handmaids of Christ that were within the same monastery, she
admonished them to preserve the peace of the Gospel among themselves,
and with all others; and even as she spoke her words of exhortation, she
joyfully saw death come, or, in the words of our Lord, passed from death
unto life.

<span id="v.iv.xxiii-p8"></span>That same night it pleased Almighty God,
by a manifest vision, to make known her death in another monastery, at a
distance from hers, which she had built that same year, and which is
called Hacanos. There was in that monastery, a certain nun called
Begu,who, having dedicated her virginity to the Lord, had served Him
upwards of thirty years in the monastic life. This nun was resting in
the dormitory of the sisters, when on a sudden she heard in the air the
well-known sound of the bell, which used to awake and call them to
prayers, when any one of them was taken out of this world, and opening
her eyes, as she thought, she saw the roof of the house open, and a
light shed from above filling all the place. Looking earnestly upon that
light, she saw the soul of the aforesaid handmaid of God in that same
light, being carried to heaven attended and guided by angels. Then
awaking, and seeing the other sisters lying round about her, she
perceived that what she had seen had been revealed to her either in a
dream or a vision; and rising immediately in great fear, she ran to the
virgin who then presided in the monastery in the place of the abbess,and
whose name was Frigyth, and, with many tears and lamentations, and
heaving deep sighs, told her that the Abbess Hilda, mother of them all,
had departed this life, and had in her sight ascended to the gates of
eternal light, and to the company of the citizens of heaven, with a
great light, and with angels for her guides. Frigyth having heard it,
awoke all the sisters, and calling them to the church, admonished them
to give themselves to prayer and singing of psalms, for the soul of
their mother; which they did earnestly during the remainder of the
night; and at break of day, the brothers came with news of her death,
from the place where she had died. They answered that they knew it
before, and then related in order how and when they had learnt it, by
which it appeared that her death had been revealed to them in a vision
that same hour in which the brothers said that she had died. Thus by a
fair harmony of events Heaven ordained, that when some saw her departure
out of this world, the others should have knowledge of her entrance into
the eternal life of souls. These monasteries are about thirteen miles
distant from each other.

<span id="v.iv.xxiii-p9"></span>It is also told, that her death was, in
a vision, made known the same night to one of the virgins dedicated to
God, who loved her with a great love, in the same monastery where the
said handmaid of God died. This nun saw her soul ascend to heaven in the
company of angels; and this she openly declared, in the very same hour
that it happened, to those handmaids of Christ that were with her; and
aroused them to pray for her soul, even before the rest of the community
had heard of her death. The truth of which was known to the whole
community in the morning. This same nun was at that time with some other
handmaids of Christ, in the remotest part of the monastery, where the
women who had lately entered the monastic life were wont to pass their
time of probation, till they were instructed according to rule, and
admitted into the fellowship of the community.
