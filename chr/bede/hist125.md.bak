### <span id="v.v.vii-p0.1"></span>CHAP. VIII. How, when Archbishop Theodore died, Bertwald succeeded him as archbishop, and, among many others whom he ordained, he made the learned Tobias bishop of the church of Rochester. \[690 A. D.\]

<span id="v.v.vii-p1"></span>THE year after that in which Caedwalla died
at Rome, that is, 690 after the Incarnation of our Lord, Archbishop
Theodore, of blessed memory, departed this life, being old and full of
days, for he was eighty-eight years of age; which number of years he had
been wont long before to foretell to his friends that he should live,
the same having been revealed to him in a dream. He held the bishopric
twenty-two years, and was buried in St. Peter’s church, where all the
bodies of the bishops of Canterbury are buried. Of whom, as well as of
his fellows of the same degree, it may rightly and truly be said, that
their bodies are buried in peace, and their names shall live to all
generations. For to say all in few words, the English Churches gained
more spiritual increase while he was archbishop, than ever before. His
character, life, age, and death, are plainly and manifestly described to
all that resort thither, by the epitaph on his tomb, in thirty-four
heroic verses. The first whereof are these:

<span id="v.v.vii-p2"></span>"Here in the tomb rests the body of the
holy prelate, called now in the Greek tongue Theodore. Chief pontiff,
blest high priest, pure doctrine he set forth to his disciples."

<span id="v.v.vii-p3"></span>The last are as follows:

<span id="v.v.vii-p4"></span>"For September had reached its nineteenth
day, when his spirit went forth from the prison-bars of the flesh.
Mounting in bliss to the gracious fellowship of the new life, he was
united to the angelic citizens in the heights of Heaven."

<span id="v.v.vii-p5"></span>Bertwald succeeded Theodore in the
archbishopric, being abbot of the monastery called Racuulfe, which
stands at the northern mouth of the river Genlade. He was a man learned
in the Scriptures, and perfectly instructed in ecclesiastical and
monastic teaching, yet in no wise to be compared to his predecessor. He
was chosen bishop in the year of our Lord 692, on the first day of July,
when Wictred and Suaebhard were kings in Kent; but he was ordained the
next year, on Sunday the 29th of June, by Godwin, metropolitan bishop of
Gaul, and was enthroned on Sunday the 31st of August. Among the many
bishops whom he ordained was Tobias, a man instructed in the Latin,
Greek, and Saxon tongues, and otherwise of manifold learning, whom he
consecrated in the stead of Gedmund, bishop of the Church of Rochester,
who had died.
