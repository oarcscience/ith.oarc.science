### <span id="v.i.xxiii-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XXIV. How he wrote to the bishop of Arles to entertain them. \[596 A.D.\]

<span id="v.i.xxiii-p1"></span>THE same venerable pope also sent at the
same time a letter to Aetherius, archbishop of Arles,’ exhorting him to
give favourable entertainment to Augustine on his way to Britain; which
letter was in these words:

<span id="v.i.xxiii-p2"></span>‘To his most reverend and holy brother
and fellow bishop Aetherius, Gregory, the servant of the servants of
God. Although religious men stand in need of no recommendation with
priests who have the charity which is pleasing to God; yet because an
opportunity of writing has occurred, we have thought fit to send this
letter to you, Brother, to inform you, that with the help of God we have
directed thither, for the good of souls, the bearer of these presents,
Augustine, the servant of God, of whose zeal we are assured, with other
servants of God, whom it is requisite that your Holiness readily assist
with priestly zeal, affording him all the comfort in your power. And to
the end that you may be the more ready in your help, we have enjoined
him to inform you particularly of the occasion of his coming; knowing,
that when you are acquainted with it, you will, as the matter requires,
for the sake of God, dutifully dispose yourself to give him comfort. We
also in all things recommend to your charity, Candidus, the priest, our
common son, whom we have transferred to the administration of a small
patrimony in our Church. God keep you in safety, most reverend brother.
Given the 23rd day of July, in the fourteenth year of the reign of our
most religious lord, Mauritius Tiberius Augustus, the thirteenth year
after the consulship of our lord aforesaid, and the fourteenth
indiction."
