### <span id="v.iv.xxi-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XXI. How Bishop Theodore made peace between the kings Egfrid and Etheired. \[679 A. D.\]

<span id="v.iv.xxi-p1"></span>IN the ninth year of the reign of King
Egfrid, a great battlewas fought between him and Ethelred, king of the
Mercians, near the river Trent, and Aelfwine, brother to King Egfrid,
was slain, a youth about eighteen years of age, and much beloved by both
provinces; for King Ethelred had married his sister Osthryth.There was
now reason to expect a more bloody war, and more lasting enmity between
those kings and their fierce nations; but Theodore, the bishop, beloved
of God, relying on the Divine aid, by his wholesome admonitions wholly
extinguished the dangerous fire that was breaking out; so that the kings
and their people on both sides were appeased, and no man was put to
death, but only the due mulct4 paid to the king who was the avenger for
the death of his brother; and this peace continued long after between
those kings and between their kingdoms.
