### <span id="v.i.vii-p0.1"></span>CHAP. VIII. How, when the persecution ceased, the Church in Britain enjoyed peace till the time of the Arian heresy. \[325 AD\]

<span id="v.i.vii-p1"></span>When the storm of persecution ceased, the
faithful Christians, who, during the time of danger, had hidden
themselves in woods and deserts and secret caves, came forth and rebuilt
the churches which had been levelled to the ground; founded, erected,
and finished the cathedrals raised in honour of the holy martyrs, and,
as if displaying their conquering standards in all places, celebrated
festivals and performed their sacred rites with pure hearts and lips.
This peace continued in the Christian churches of Britain until the time
of the Arian madness, which, having corrupted the whole world, infected
this island also, so far removed from the rest of the world, with the
poison of its error; and when once a way was opened across the sea for
that plague, straightway all the taint of every heresy fell upon the
island, ever desirous to hear some new thing, and never holding firm to
any sure belief.

<span id="v.i.vii-p2"></span>At this time Constantius, who, whilst
Diocletian was alive, governed Gaul and Spain, a man of great clemency
and urbanity, died in Britain. This man left his son Constantine
\[Constantine the Great\] born of Helena, his concubine, emperor of the
Gauls. Eutropius writes that Constantine, being created emperor in
Britain, succeeded his father in the sovereignty. In his time the Arian
heresy broke out, and although it was exposed and condemned in the
Council of Nicaea, nevertheless, the deadly poison of its evil spread,
as has been said, to the Churches in the islands, as well as to those of
the rest of the world.
