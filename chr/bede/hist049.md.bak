THE king, hearing these words, answered, that he was both willing and
bound to receive the faith which Paulinus taught; but that he would
confer about it with his chief friends and counsellors, to the end that
if they also were of his opinion, they might all together be consecrated
to Christ in the font of life. Paulinus consenting, the king did as he
said; for, holding a council with the wise men,' he asked of every one
in particular what he thought of this doctrine hitherto unknown to them,
and the new worship of God that was preached? The chief of his own
priests, Coifi, immediately answered him, "0 king, consider what this is
which is now preached to us; for I verily declare to you what I have
learnt beyond doubt, that the religion which we have hitherto professed
has no virtue in it and no profit. For none of your people has applied
himself more diligently to the worship of our gods than I; and yet there
are many who receive greater favours from you, and are more preferred
than I, and are more prosperous in all that they undertake to do or to
get. Now if the gods were good for any thing, they would rather forward
me, who have been careful to serve them with greater zeal. It remains,
therefore, that if upon examination you find those new doctrines, which
are now preached to us, better and more efficacious, we hasten to
receive them without any delay."  
  
Another of the king's chief men, approving of his wise words and
exhortations, added thereafter: "The present life of man upon earth, O
king, seems to me, in comparison with that time which is unknown to us,
like to the swift flight of a sparrow through the house wherein you sit
at supper in winter, with your ealdormen and thegns, while the fire
blazes in the midst, and the hall is warmed, but the wintry storms of
rain or snow are raging abroad. The sparrow, flying in at one door and
immediately out at another, whilst he is within, is safe from the wintry
tempest; but after a short space of fair weather, he immediately
vanishes out of your sight, passing from winter into winter again. So
this life of man appears for a little while, but of what is to follow or
what went before we know nothing at all. If, therefore, this new
doctrine tells us something more certain, it seems justly to deserve to
be followed." The other elders and king's counsellors, by Divine
prompting, spoke to the same effect.  
  
But Coifi added, that he wished more attentively to hear Paulinus
discourse concerning the God Whom he preached. When he did so, at the
king's command, Coifi, hearing his words, cried out, "This long time I
have perceived that what we worshipped was naught; because the more
diligently I sought after truth in that worship, the less I found it.
But now I freely confess, that such truth evidently appears in this
preaching as can confer on us the gifts of life, of salvation, and of
eternal happiness. For which reason my counsel is, O king, that we
instantly give up to ban and fire those temples and altars which we have
consecrated without reaping any benefit from them." In brief, the king
openly assented to the preaching of the Gospel by Paulinus, and
renouncing idolatry, declared that he received the faith of Christ: and
when he inquired of the aforesaid high priest of his religion, who
should first desecrate the altars and temples of their idols, with the
precincts that were about them, he answered, "I; for who can more
fittingly than myself destroy those things which I worshipped in my
folly, for an example to all others, through the wisdom which has been
given me by the true God?" Then immediately, in contempt of his vain
superstitions, he desired the king to furnish him with arms and a
stallion, that he might mount and go forth to destroy the idols; for it
was not lawful before for the high priest either to carry arms, or to
ride on anything but a mare. Having, therefore, girt a sword about him,
with a spear in his hand, he mounted the king's stallion, and went his
way to the idols. The multitude, beholding it, thought that he was mad;
but as soon as he drew near the temple he did not delay to desecrate it
by casting into it the spear which he held; and rejoicing in the
knowledge of the worship of the true God, he commanded his companions to
tear down and set on fire the temple, with all its precincts. This place
where the idols once stood is still shown, not far from York, to the
eastward, beyond the river Derwent, and is now called Godmunddingaham,
where the high priest, by the inspiration of the true God, profaned and
destroyed the altars which he had himself consecrated.
