**EDWIN was so zealous for the true worship, that he likewise persuaded
Earpwald, king of the East Angles, and son of Redwald, to abandonhis
idolatrous superstitions, and with his whole province to receive the
faith and mysteries of Christ. And indeed his father Redwald had long
before been initiated into the mysteries of the Christian faith in Kent,
but in vain; for on his return home, he was seduced by his wife and
certain perverse teachers, and turned aside from the sincerity of the
faith; and thus his latter state was worse than the former; so that,
like the Samaritans of old, he seemed at the same time to serve Christ
and the gods whom he served before; and in the same temple he had an
altar for the Christian Sacrifice, and another small one at which to
offer victims to devils. Aldwulf, king of that same province, who lived
in our time, testifies that this temple had stood until his time, and
that he had seen it when he was a boy. The aforesaid King Redwald was
noble by birth, though ignoble in his actions, being the son of Tytilus,
whose father was Uuffa, from whom the kings of the East Angles are
called Uuffings.  
  
Earpwald, not long after he had embraced the Christian faith, was slain
by one Ricbert, a pagan; and from that time the province was in error
for three years, till Sigbert succeeded to the kingdom, brother to the
same Earpwald, a most Christian and learned man, who was banished, and
went to live in Gaul during his brother's life, and was there initiated
into the mysteries of the faith, whereof he made it his business to
cause all his province to partake as soon as he came to the throne. His
exertions were nobly promoted by Bishop Felix,who, coming to Honorius,
the archbishop, from the parts of Burgundy, where he had been born and
ordained, and having told him what he desired, was sent by him to preach
the Word of life to the aforesaid nation of the Angles. Nor were his
good wishes in vain; for the pious labourer in the spiritual field
reaped therein a great harvest of believers, delivering all that
province (according to the inner signification of his name) from long
iniquity and unhappiness, and bringing it to the faith and works of
righteousness, and the gifts of everlasting happiness. He had the see of
his bishopric appointed him in the city Dommoc, and having presided over
the same province with pontifical authority seventeen years, he ended
his days there in peace.
