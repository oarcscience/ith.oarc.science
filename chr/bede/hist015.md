### <span id="v.i.xii-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XIII. How in the reign of Theodosius the younger, in whose time Palladius was sent to the Scots that believed in Christ, the Britons begging assistance of Aetius, the consul, could not obtain it. \[446 A.D.\]

<span id="v.i.xii-p1"></span>In the year of our Lord 423, Theodosius,
the younger, the forty-fifth from Augustus, succeeded Honorius and
governed the Roman empire twenty-six years. In the eighth year of his
reign, Palladius was sent by Celestinus, the Roman pontiff, to the Scots
that believed in Christ, to be their first bishop. In the twenty-third
year of his reign, Aetius, a man of note and a patrician, discharged his
third consulship with Symmachus for his colleague. To him the wretched
remnant of the Britons sent a letter, which began thus :—"To Aetius,
thrice Consul, the groans of the Britons." And in the sequel of the
letter they thus unfolded their woes:—" The barbarians drive us to the
sea; the sea drives us back to the barbarians: between them we are
exposed to two sorts of death; we are either slaughtered or drowned."
Yet, for all this, they could not obtain any help from him, as he was
then engaged in most serious wars with Bledla and Attila, kings of the
Huns. And though the year before this Bledla had been murdered by the
treachery of his own brother Attila, yet Attila himself remained so
intolerable an enemy to the Republic, that he ravaged almost all Europe,
attacking and destroying cities and castles. At the same time there was
a famine at Constantinople, and soon after a plague followed; moreover,
a great part of the wall of that city, with fifty-seven towers, fell to
the ground. Many cities also went to ruin, and the famine and
pestilential state of the air destroyed thousands of men and cattle.
