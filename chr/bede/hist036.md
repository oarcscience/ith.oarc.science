### <span id="v.i.xxxiii-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XXXIV. How Ethelfrid, king of the Northumbrians, having vanquished the nations of the Scots, expelled them from the territories of the English. \[603 A. D.\]

<span id="v.i.xxxiii-p1"></span>At this time, the brave and ambitious
king, Ethelfrid, governed the kingdom of the Northumbrians, and ravaged
the Britons more than all the chiefs of the English, insomuch that he
might be compared to Saul of old, king of the Israelites, save only in
this, that he was ignorant of Divine religion. For he conquered more
territories from the Britons than any other chieftain or king, either
subduing the inhabitants and making them tributary, or driving them out
and planting the English in their places. To him might justly be applied
the saying of the patriarch blessing his son in the person of Saul,
"Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf; in the morning he shall devour the
prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil." Hereupon, Aedan, king of
the Scots that dwell in Britain, being alarmed by his success, came
against him with a great and mighty army, but was defeated and fled with
a few followers; for almost all his army was cut to pieces at a famous
place, called Degsastan, that is, Degsa Stone. In which battle also
Theodbald, brother to Ethelfrid, was killed, with almost all the forces
he commanded. This war Ethelfrid brought to an end in the year of our
Lord 603, the eleventh of his own reign, which lasted twenty-four years,
and the first year of the reign of Phocas, who then was at the head of
the Roman empire. From that time, no king of the Scots durst come into
Britain to make war on the English to this day.
