### <span id="v.iii.ix-p0.1"></span>CHAP. IX. How miracles of healing have been frequently wrought in the place where King Oswald was killed; and how, first, a traveller’s horse was restored and afterwards a young girl cured of the palsy. \[642 A.D.\]

<span id="v.iii.ix-p1"></span> OSWALD, the most Christian king of the
Northumbrians, reigned nine years, including that year which was held
accursed for the barbarous cruelty of the king of the Britons and the
reckless apostacy of the English kings; for, as was said above,it is
agreed by the unanimous consent of all, that the names and memory of the
apostates should be erased from the catalogue of the Christian kings,
and no year assigned to their reign. After which period, Oswald was
killed in a great battle, by the same pagan nation and pagan king of the
Mercians, who had slain his predecessor Edwin, at a place called in the
English tongue Maserfelth, in the thirty-eighth year of his age, on the
fifth day of the month of August.

<span id="v.iii.ix-p2"></span> How great his faith was towards God, and
how remarkable his devotion, has been made evident by miracles even
after his death; for, in the place where he was killed by the pagans,
fighting for his country, sick men and cattle are frequently healed to
this day. Whence it came to pass that many took up the very dust of the
place where his body fell, and putting it into water, brought much
relief with it to their friends who were sick. This custom came so much
into use, that the earth being carried away by degrees, a hole was made
as deep as the height of a man. Nor is it surprising that the sick
should be healed in the place where he died; for, whilst he lived, he
never ceased to provide for the poor and the sick, and to bestow alms on
them, and assist them.

<span id="v.iii.ix-p3"></span> Many miracles are said to have been
wrought in that place, or with the dust carried from it; but we have
thought it sufficient to mention two, which we have heard from our
elders.

<span id="v.iii.ix-p4"></span> It happened, not long after his death,
that a man was travelling on horseback near that place, when his horse
on a sudden fell sick, stood still, hung his head, and foamed at the
mouth, and, at length, as his pain increased, he fell to the ground; the
rider dismounted, and taking off his saddle,waited to see whether the
beast would recover or die. At length, after writhing for a long time in
extreme anguish, the horse happened in his struggles to come to the very
place where the great king died. Immediately the pain abated, the beast
ceased from his frantic kicking, and, after the manner of horses, as if
resting from his weariness, he rolled from side to side, and then
starting up, perfectly recovered, began to graze hungrily on the green
herbage. The rider observing this, and being an intelligent man,
concluded that there must be some wonderful sanctity in the place where
the horse had been healed, and he marked the spot. After which he again
mounted his horse, and went on to the inn where he intended to stop. On
his arrival he found a girl, niece to the landlord, who had long been
sick of the palsy; and when the members of the household, in his
presence, lamented the girl’s grievous calamity, he gave them an account
of the place where his horse had been cured. In brief, she was put into
a wagon and carried to the place and laid down there. At first she slept
awhile, and when she awoke, found herself healed of her infirmity. Upon
which she called for water, washed her face, arranged her hair, put a
kerchief on her head, and returned home on foot, in good health, with
those who had brought her.
