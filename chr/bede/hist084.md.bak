### <span id="v.iii.xxviii-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XXVIII. How, when Tuda was dead, Wilfrid was ordained, in Gaul, and Ceadda, among the West Saxons, to be bishops for the province of the Northumbrians. \[664 A.D.\]

<span id="v.iii.xxviii-p1"></span> IN the meantime, King Alchfrid sent
the priest, Wilfrid, to the king of Gaul, in order that he should cause
him to be consecrated bishop for himself and his people. That prince
sent him to be ordained by Agilbert,of whom we have before spoken, and
who, having left Britain, was made bishop of the city of Paris;and by
him Wilfrid was honourably consecrated, several bishops meeting together
for that purpose in a village belonging to the king, called In
Compendio.He stayed some time in the parts beyond the sea for his
ordination, and King Oswy, following the example of his son’s zeal, sent
into Kent a holy man, of modest character, well read in the Scripture,
and diligently practising those things which he had learned therein, to
be ordained bishop of the church of York. This was a priest called
Ceadda, brother to the most reverend prelate Cedd, of whom mention has
been often made, and abbot of the monastery of Laestingaeu. With him the
king also sent his priest Eadhaed,who was afterwards, in the reign of
Egfrid,made bishop of the church of Ripon. Now when they arrived in
Kent, they found that Archbishop Deusdedit had departed this life, and
no other bishop was as yet appointed in his place; whereupon they betook
themselves to the province of the West Saxons, where Wini was bishop,
and by him Ceadda was consecrated; two bishops of the British nation,
who kept Easter Sunday, as has been often said, contrary to the
canonical manner, from the fourteenth to the twentieth moon, being
called in to assist at the ordination; for at that time there was no
other bishop in all Britain canonically ordained, except Wini.

<span id="v.iii.xxviii-p2"></span> So Ceadda, being consecrated bishop,
began immediately to labour for ecclesiastical truth and purity of
doctrine; to apply himself to humility, self-denial, and study; to
travel about, not on horseback, but after the manner of the Apostles, on
foot, to preach the Gospel in towns, the open country, cottages,
villages, and castles; for he was one of the disciples of Aidan, and
endeavoured to instruct his people by the same manner of life and
character, after his and his own brother Cedd’s example. Wilfrid also
having been now made a bishop, came into Britain, and in like manner by
his teaching brought into the English Church many rules of Catholic
observance. Whence it followed, that the Catholic principles daily
gained strength, and all the Scots that dwelt in England either
conformed to these, or returned into their own country.
