### <span id="v.iv.xv-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XV. How King Caedwalla, king of the Gewissae, having slain Ethelwalch, wasted that Province with cruel slaughter and devastation. \[685 A.D.\]

<span id="v.iv.xv-p1"></span>IN the meantime, Caedwalla,a young man of
great vigour, of the royal race of the Gewissae,an exile from his
country, came with an army, slew Ethelwalch,and wasted that province
with cruel slaughter and devastation; but he was soon expelled by
Berthun and Andhun, the king’s ealdormen, who held in succession the
government of the province. The first of them was afterwards killed by
the same Caedwalla, when he was king of the Gewissae, and the province
was reduced to more grievous slavery: Ini, likewise, who reigned after
Caedwalla, oppressed that country with the like servitude for many
years; for which reason, during all that time, they could have no bishop
of their own; but their first bishop, Wilfrid, having been recalled
home, they were subject to the bishop of the Gewissae, that is, the West
Saxons, who were in the city of Venta. (Winchester)
