### <span id="v.iii.xxiv-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XXIV. How when King Penda was slain, the province of the Mercians received the faith of Christ, and Oswy gave possessions and territories to God, for building monasteries, as a thank offering for the victory obtained. \[655 A.D.\]

<span id="v.iii.xxiv-p1"></span> AT this time, King Oswy was exposed to
the cruel and intolerable invasions of Penda, king of the Mercians, whom
we have so often mentioned, and who had slain his brother; at length,
compelled by his necessity, he promised to give him countless gifts and
royal marks of honour greater than can be believed, to purchase peace;
provided that he would return home, and cease to waste and utterly
destroy the provinces of his kingdom. The pagan king refused to grant
his request, for he had resolved to blot out and extirpate all his
nation, from the highest to the lowest; whereupon King Oswy had recourse
to the protection of the Divine pity for deliverance from his barbarous
and pitiless foe, and binding himself by a vow, said, "If the pagan will
not accept our gifts, let us offer them to Him that will, the Lord our
God." He then vowed, that if he should win the victory, he would
dedicate his daughter to the Lord in holy virginity, and give twelve
pieces of land whereon to build monasteries. After this he gave battle
with a very small army: indeed, it is reported that the pagans had
thirty times the number of men; for they had thirty legions, drawn up
under most noted commanders. King Oswy and his son Alchfrid met them
with a very small army, as has been said, but trusting in Christ as
their Leader; his other son, Egfrid was then kept as a hostage at the
court of Queen Cynwise,in the province of the Mercians. King Oswald’s
son Oidilwald, who ought to have supported them, was on the enemy’s
side, and led them on to fight against his country and his uncle;
though, during the battle, he withdrew, and awaited the event in a place
of safety. The engagement began, the pagans were put to flight or
killed, the thirty royal commanders, who had come to Penda’s assistance,
were almost all of them slain; among whom was Ethelhere, brother and
successor to Anna, king of the East Angles. He had been the occasion of
the war, and was now killed, having lost his army and auxiliaries. The
battle was fought near the river Winwaed, which then, owing to the great
rains, was in flood, and had overflowed its banks, so that many more
were drowned in the flight than destroyed in battle by thc sword.

<span id="v.iii.xxiv-p2"></span> Then King Oswy, according to the vow he
had made to the Lord, returned thanks to God for the victory granted
him, and gave his daughter Elfled, who was scarce a year old, to be
consecrated to Him in perpetual virginity; bestowing also twelve small
estates of land, wherein the practice of earthly warfare should cease,
and place and means should be afforded to devout and zealous monks to
wage spiritual warfare, and pray for the eternal peace of his nation. Of
these estates six were in the province of the Deiri, and the other six
in that of the Bernicians. Each of the estates contained ten families,
that is, a hundred and twenty in all. The aforesaid daughter of King
Oswy, who was to be dedicated to God, entered the monastery called
Heruteu,or, "The Island of the Hart," at that time ruled by the Abbess
Hilda, who, two years after, having acquired an estate of ten families,
at the place called Streanaeshalch,built a monastery there, in which the
aforesaid king’s daughter was first trained in the monastic life and
afterwards became abbess; till, at the age of fifty-nine, the blessed
virgin departed to be united to her Heavenly Bridegroom. In this
monastery, she and her father, Oswy, her mother, Eanfled, her mother’s
father, Edwin, and many other noble persons, are buried in the church of
the holy Apostle Peter. King Oswy concluded this war in the district of
Loidis, in the thirteenth year of his reign, on the 15th of November, to
the great benefit of both nations; for he delivered his own people from
the hostile depredations of the pagans, and, having made an end of their
heathen chief, converted the Mercians and the adjacent provinces to the
grace of the Christian faith.

<span id="v.iii.xxiv-p3"></span> Diuma was made the first bishop of the
Mercians, as also of Lindsey and the Midland Angles, as has been said
above,and he died and was buried among the Midland Angles. The second
was Ceollach, who, giving up his episcopal office before his death,
returned into Scotland. Both these bishops belonged to the nation of the
Scots. The third was Trumhere, an Englishman, but educated and ordained
by the Scots. He was abbot of the monastery that is called
Ingetlingum,and is the place where King Oswin was killed, as has been
said above; for Queen Eanfled, his kinswoman, in expiation of his unjust
death, begged of King Oswy that he would give Trumhere, the aforesaid
servant of God, a place there to build a monastery, because he also was
kinsman to the slaughtered king; in which monastery continual prayers
should be offered up for the eternal welfare of the kings, both of him
that was murdered, and of him that commanded the murder. The same King
Oswy governed the Mercians, as also the people of the other southern
provinces, three years after he had slain King Penda; and he likewise
subdued the greater part of the Picts to the dominion of the English.

<span id="v.iii.xxiv-p4"></span> At this time he gave to the
above-mentioned Peada, son to King Penda, because he was his kinsman,
the kingdom of the Southern Mercians,consisting, as is said, of 5,000
families, divided by the river Trent from the Northern Mercians, whose
land contains 7,000 families; but Peada was foully slain in the
following spring, by the treachery, as is said, of his wife,during the
very time of the Easter festival. Three years after the death of King
Penda, the Mercian chiefs, Immin, and Eafa, and Eadbert, rebelled
against King Oswy, setting up for their king, Wulfhere,son to the said
Penda, a youth whom they had kept concealed; and expelling the ealdormen
of the foreign king, they bravely recovered at once their liberty and
their lands; and being thus free, together with their king, they
rejoiced to serve Christ the true King, for the sake of an everlasting
kingdom in heaven. This king governed the Mercians seventeen years, and
had for his first bishop Trumhere, above spoken of; the second was
Jaruman; the third Ceadda; the fourth Wynfrid. All these, succeeding
each other in order under King Wulfhere, discharged episcopal duties to
the Mercian nation.
