### <span id="v.iii.xvi-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XVI. How the same Aidan, by his prayers, saved the royal city when it was fired by the enemy. \[Before 651 A.D.\]

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p1"></span> ANOTHER notable miracle of the same
father is related by many such as were likely to have knowledge thereof;
for during the time that he was bishop, the hostile army of the
Mercians, under the command of Penda, cruelly ravaged the country of the
Northumbrians far and near, even to the royal city,which has its name
from Bebba, formerly its queen. Not being able to take it by storm or by
siege, he endeavoured to burn it down; and having pulled down all the
villages in the neighbourhood of the city, he brought thither an immense
quantity of beams, rafters, partitions, wattles and thatch, wherewith he
encompassed the place to a great height on the land side, and when he
found the wind favourable, he set fire to it and attempted to burn the
town.

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p2"></span>At that time, the most reverend Bishop
Aidan was dwelling in the Isle of Fame,which is about two miles from the
city; for thither he was wont often to retire to pray in solitude and
silence; and, indeed, this lonely dwelling of his is to this day shown
in that island. When he saw the flames of fire and the smoke carried by
the wind rising above the city walls, he is said to have lifted up his
eyes and hands to heaven, and cried with tears, "Behold, Lord, how great
evil is wrought by Penda!" These words were hardly uttered, when the
wind immediately veering from the city, drove back the flames upon those
who had kindled them, so that some being hurt, and all afraid, they
forebore any further attempts against the city, which they perceived to
be protected by the hand of God.

when he died, could not be consumed when the rest of the Church was on
fire; and concerning his inward life. \[651 A. D.\]](hist073)
