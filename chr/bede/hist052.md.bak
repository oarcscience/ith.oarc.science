**PAULINUS also preached the Word to the province of Lindsey, which is
the first on the south side of the river H umber, stretching as far as
the sea; and he first converted to the Lord the reeve of the city of
Lincoln, whose name was Blaecca, with his whole house. He likewise
built, in that city, a stone church of beautiful workmanship; the roof
of which has either fallen through long neglect, or been thrown down by
enemies, but the walls are still to be seen standing, and every year
miraculous cures are wrought in that place, for the benefit of those who
have faith to seek them. In that church, when Justus had departed to
Christ, Paulinus consecrated Honorius bishop in his stead, as will be
hereafter mentioned in its proper place. A certain priest and abbot of
the monastery of Peartaneu,(Partney in Lincolnshire)a man of singular
veracity, whose name was Deda, told me concerning the faith of this
province that an old man had informed him that he himself had been
baptized at noon-day, by Bishop Paulinus, in the presence of King Edwin,
and with him a great multitude of the people, in the river Trent, near
the city, which in the English tongue is called Tiouulfingacaestir; and
he was also wont to describe the person of the same Paulinus, saying
that he was tall of stature, stooping somewhat, his hair black, his
visage thin, his nose slender and aquiline, his aspect both venerable
and awe-inspiring. He had also with him in the ministry, James, the
deacon, a man of zeal and great fame in Christ and in the church, who
lived even to our days.  
  
It is told that there was then such perfect peace in Britain,
wheresoever the dominion of King Edwin extended, that, as is still
proverbially said, a woman with her new-born babe might walk throughout
the island, from sea to sea, without receiving any harm. That king took
such care for the good of his nation, that in several places where he
had seen clear springs near the highways, he caused stakes to be fixed,
with copper drinking-vessels hanging on them, for the refreshment of
travellers; nor durst any man touch them for any other purpose than that
for which they were designed, either through the great dread they had of
the king, or for the affection which they bore him. His dignity was so
great throughout his dominions, that not only were his banners borne
before him in battle, but even in time of peace, when he rode about his
cities, townships, or provinces, with his thegns, the standard-bearer
was always wont to go before him. Also, when he walked anywhere along
the streets, that sort of banner which the Romans call Tufa, and the
English, Thuuf, was in like manner borne before him.
