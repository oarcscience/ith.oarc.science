### <span id="v.i.xxiv-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XXV. How Augustine, coming into Britain, first preached in the Isle of Thanet to the King of Kent, and having obtained licence from him, went into Kent, in order to preach therein. \[597 A. D.\]

<span id="v.i.xxiv-p1"></span>Augustine, thus strengthened by the
encouragement of the blessed Father Gregory, returned to the work of the
Word of God, with the servants of Christ who were with him, and arrived
in Britain. The powerful Ethelbert was at that time king of Kent; he had
extended his dominions as far as the boundary formed by the great river
Humber, by which the Southern Saxons are divided from the Northern. On
the east of Kent is the large Isle of Thanet, containing, according to
the English way of reckoning, 600 families, divided from the mainland by
the river Wantsum, which is about three furlongs in breadth, and which
can be crossed only in two places; for at both ends it runs into the
sea. On this island landed the servant of the Lord, Augustine, and his
companions, being, as is reported, nearly forty men. They had obtained,
by order of the blessed Pope Gregory, interpreters of the nation of the
Franks, and sending to Ethelbert, signified that they were come from
Rome, and brought a joyful message, which most undoubtedly assured to
those that hearkened to it everlasting joys in heaven, and a kingdom
that would never end, with the living and true God. The king hearing
this, gave orders that they, should stay in the island where they had
landed, and be furnished with necessaries, till he should consider what
to do with them. For he had before heard of the Christian religion,
having a Christian wife of the royal family of the Franks, called
Bertha; whom he had received from her parents, upon condition that she
should be permitted to preserve inviolate the rites of her religion with
the Bishop Liudhard, who was sent with her to support her in the faith.
Some days after, the king came into the island, and sitting in the open
air, ordered Augustine and his companions to come and hold a conference
with him. For he had taken precaution that they should not come to him
in any house, lest, by so coming, according to an ancient superstition,
if they practised any magical arts, they might impose upon him, and so
get the better of him. But they came endued with Divine, not with magic
power, bearing a silver cross for their banner, and the image of our
Lord and Saviour painted on a board; and chanting litanies, they offered
up their prayers to the Lord for the eternal salvation both of
themselves and of those to whom and for whom they had come. When they
had sat down, in obedience to the king’s commands, and preached to him
and his attendants there present the Word of life, the king answered
thus: "Your words and promises are fair, but because they are new to us,
and of uncertain import, I cannot consent to them so far as to forsake
that which I have so long observed with the whole English nation. But
because you are come from far as strangers into my kingdom, and, as I
conceive, are desirous to impart to us those things which you believe to
be true, and most beneficial, we desire not to harm you, but will give
you favourable entertainment, and take care to supply you with all
things necessary to your sustenance; nor do we forbid you to preach and
gain as many as you can to your religion." Accordingly he gave them an
abode in the city of Canterbury, which was the metropolis of all his
dominions, and, as he had promised, besides supplying them with
sustenance, did not refuse them liberty to preach. It is told that, as
they drew near to the city, after their manner, with the holy cross, and
the image of our sovereign Lord and King, Jesus Christ, they sang in
concert this litany: "We beseech thee, Lord, for Thy great mercy, that
Thy wrath and anger be turned away from this city, and from Thy holy
house, for we have sinned. Hallelujah."
