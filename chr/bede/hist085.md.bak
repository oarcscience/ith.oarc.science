### <span id="v.iii.xxix-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XXIX. How the priest Wighard was sent from Britain to Rome, to be ordained archbishop; of his death there, and of the letters of the Apostolic Pope giving an account thereof. \[667 A.D.\]

<span id="v.iii.xxix-p1"></span> AT this time the most noble kings of
the English, Oswy, of the province of the Northumbrians, and Egbert of
Kent, consulted together to determine what ought to be done about the
state of the English Church, for Oswy, though educated by the Scots, had
rightly perceived that the Roman was the Catholic and Apostolic Church.
They selected, with the consent and by the choice of the holy Church of
the English nation, a priest named Wighard, one of Bishop Deusdedit’s
clergy, a good man and fitted for the episcopate, and sent him to Rome
to be ordained bishop, to the end that, having been raised to the rank
of an archbishop, he might ordain Catholic prelates for the Churches of
the English nation throughout all Britain. But Wighard, arriving at
Rome, was cut off by death, before he could be consecrated bishop, and
the following letter was sent back into Britain to King Oswy:— "To the
most excellent lord, our son, Oswy, king of the Saxons, Vitalian,
bishop, servant of the servants of God. We have received to our comfort
your Excellency’s letters; by reading whereof we are acquainted with
your most pious devotion and fervent love of the blessed life; and know
that by the protecting hand of God you have been converted to the true
and Apostolic faith, in hope that even as you reign in your own nation,
so you may hereafter reign with Christ. Blessed be the nation,
therefore, that has been found worthy to have as its king one so wise
and a worshipper of God; forasmuch as he is not himself alone a
worshipper of God, but also studies day and night the conversion of all
his subjects to the Catholic and Apostolic faith, to the redemption of
his own soul. Who would not rejoice at hearing such glad tidings? Who
would not exult and be joyful at these good works? For your nation has
believed in Christ the Almighty God, according to the words of the
Divine prophets, as it is written in Isaiah, ‘In that day there shall be
a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it
shall the Gentiles seek.’ And again, ‘Listen, O isles, unto me, and
hearken ye people from far.’And a little after, ‘It is a light thing
that thou shouldst be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to
restore the outcast of Israel. I have given thee for a light to the
Gentiles, that thou mayst be my salvation unto the end of the earth.’
And again, ‘ Kings shall see, princes also shall arise and worship.’ And
immediately after, ‘I have given thee for a covenant of the people, to
establish the earth, and possess the scattered heritages; that thou
mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness,
Show yourselves.’And again, ‘I the Lord have called thee in
righteousness, and have held thine hand, and have kept thee, and have
given thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; to
open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoner from the prison, and them
that sit in darkness from the prison-house.

<span id="v.iii.xxix-p2"></span> "Behold, most excellent son, how it is
plain as day that it was prophesied not only of you, but also of all the
nations, that they should believe in Christ, the Creator of all things.
Wherefore it behoves your Highness, as being a member of Christ, in all
things continually to follow the pious rule of the chief of the
Apostles, in celebrating Easter, and in all things delivered by the holy
Apostles, Peter and Paul, whose doctrine daily enlightens the hearts of
believers, even as the two lights of heaven illumine the world."

<span id="v.iii.xxix-p3"></span> And after some lines, wherein he speaks
of celebrating the true Easter uniformly throughout all the world,—
"Finally," he adds, "we have not been able now, on account of the length
of the journey, to find a man, apt to teach, and qualified in all
respects to be a bishop, according to the tenor of your letters.But,
assuredly, as soon as such a fit person shall be found, we will send him
well instructed to your country, that he may, by word of mouth, and
through the Divine oracles, with the blessing of God, root out all the
enemy’s tares throughout your island. We have received the presents sent
by your Highness to the blessed chief of the Apostles, for an eternal
memorial of him, and return you thanks, and always pray for your safety
with the clergy of Christ. But he that brought these presents has been
removed out of this world, and is buried at the threshold of the
Apostles, for whom we have been much grieved, because he died here.
Nevertheless, we have caused the blessed gifts of the saints, that is,
the relics of the blessed Apostles, Peter and Paul, and of the holy
martyrs, Laurentius, John, and Paul, and Gregory, and Pancratius,to be
given to your servants, the bearers of these our letters, to be by them
delivered to your Excellency. And to your consort also, our spiritual
daughter, we have by the aforesaid bearers sent a cross, with a gold key
to it, made out of the most holy chains of the blessed Apostles, Peter
and Paul; for, hearing of her pious zeal, all the Apostolic see rejoices
with us, even as her pious works smell sweet and blossom before God.

<span id="v.iii.xxix-p4"></span> "We therefore desire that your Highness
should hasten, according to our wish, to dedicate all your island to
Christ our God; for assuredly you have for your Protector, the Redeemer
of mankind, our Lord Jesus Christ, Who will prosper you in all things,
that you may gather together a new people of Christ, establishing there
the Catholic and Apostolic faith. For it is written, ‘Seek ye first the
kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be
added unto you.’Truly your Highness seeks, and shall obtain, and all
your islands shall be made subject to you, even as we desire. Saluting
your Excellency with fatherly affection, we never cease to pray to the
Divine Goodness, to vouchsafe to assist you and yours in all good works,
that you may reign with Christ in the world to come. May the Heavenly
Grace preserve your Excellency in safety!"

<span id="v.iii.xxix-p5"></span> In the next book we shall have a more
suitable occasion to show who was selected and consecrated in Wighard’s
place.
