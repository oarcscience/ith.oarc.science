### <span id="v.v.iv-p0.1"></span>CHAP. IV. How he healed a thegn’s wife that was sick, with holy water.

<span id="v.v.iv-p1"></span>THE same abbot related another miracle, not
unlike the former, of the aforesaid bishop. "Not very far from our
monastery," he said, "to wit, about two miles off, was the township of
one Puch, a thegn, whose wife had lain sick of a very grievous disease
for nearly forty days, insomuch that for three weeks she could not be
carried out of the chamber where she lay. It happened that the man of
God was, at that time, called thither by the thegn to consecrate a
church; and when that was done, the thegn desired him to come into his
house and dine. The bishop declined, saying that he must return to the
monastery, which was very near. The thegn, entreating him more
earnestly, vowed he would also give alms to the poor, if so be that the
bishop would vouchsafe to enter his house that day and break his fast. I
joined my entreaties to his, promising in like manner to give alms for
the relief of the poor, if he would but go and dine at the thegn’s
house, and give his blessing. Having at length, with much difficulty,
prevailed, we went in to refresh ourselves. The bishop had sent to the
woman that lay sick some of the holy water, which he had blessed for the
consecration of the church, by one of the brothers who had come with me,
ordering him to give her some to drink, and wash that part of her where
he found that her pain was greatest, with some of the same water. This
being done, the woman immediately got up whole and sound, and perceiving
that she had not only been delivered from her long sickness, but at the
same time had recovered the strength which she had lost for so great a
time, she presented the cup to the bishop and to us, and continued
serving us with meat and drink as she had begun, till dinner was over;
following the example of the blessed Peter’s wife’s mother, who, having
been sick of a fever, arose at the touch of our Lord’s hand, and having
forthwith received health and strength, ministered to them."
