### <span id="v.v.xviii-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XIX. How Coinred, king of the Mercians, and Offa, king of the East Saxons, ended their days at Rome, in the monastic habit; and of the life and death of Bishop Wilfrid. \[709 A. D.\]

<span id="v.v.xviii-p1"></span>IN the fourth year of the reign of Osred,
Coenred, who had for some time nobly governed the kingdom of the
Mercians, much more nobly quitted the sceptre of his kingdom. For he
went to Rome, and there receiving the tonsure and becoming a monk, when
Constantine was pope, he continued to his last hour in prayer and
fasting and alms-deeds at the threshold of the Apostles.

<span id="v.v.xviii-p2"></span>He was succeeded in the throne by
Ceolred, the son of Ethelred, who had governed the kingdom before
Coenred. With him went the son of Sighere, the king of the East Saxons
whom we mentioned before, by name Offa, a youth of a most pleasing age
and comeliness, and greatly desired by all his nation to have and to
hold the sceptre of the kingdom. He, with like devotion, quitted wife,
and lands, and kindred and country, for Christ and for the Gospel, that
he might "receive an hundred-fold in this life, and in the world to come
life everlasting." He also, when they came to the holy places at Rome,
received the tonsure, and ending his life in the monastic habit,
attained to the vision of the blessed Apostles in Heaven, as he had long
desired.

<span id="v.v.xviii-p3"></span>The same year that they departed from
Britain, the great bishop, Wilfrid, ended his days in the province
called Inundalum, after he had been bishop forty-five years. His body,
being laid in a coffin, was carried to his monastery, which is called
Inhrypum, and buried in the church of the blessed Apostle Peter, with
the honour due to so great a prelate. Concerning whose manner of life,
let us now turn back, and briefly make mention of the things which were
done. Being a boy of a good disposition, and virtuous beyond his years,
he conducted himself so modestly and discreetly in all points, that he
was deservedly beloved, respected, and cherished by his elders as one of
themselves. At fourteen years of age he chose rather the monastic than
the secular life; which, when he had signified to his father, for his
mother was dead, he readily consented to his godly wishes and desires,
and advised him to persist in that wholesome purpose. Wherefore he came
to the isle of Lindisfarne, and there giving himself to the service of
the monks, he strove diligently to learn and to practise those things
which belong to monastic purity and piety; and being of a ready wit, he
speedily learned the psalms and some other books, having not yet
received the tonsure, but being in no small measure marked by those
virtues of humility and obedience which are more important than the
tonsure; for which reason he was justly loved by his elders and his
equals. Having served God some years in that monastery, and being a
youth of a good understanding, he perceived that the way of virtue
delivered by the Scots was in no wise perfect, and he resolved to go to
Rome, to see what ecclesiastical or monastic rites were in use at the
Apostolic see. When he told the brethren, they commended his design, and
advised him to carry out that which he purposed. He forthwith went to
Queen Eanfled, for he was known to her, and it was by her counsel and
support that he had been admitted into the aforesaid monastery, and he
told her of his desire to visit the threshold of the blessed Apostles.
She, being pleased with the youth’s good purpose, sent him into Kent, to
King Earconbert, who was her uncle’s son, requesting that he would send
him to Rome in an honourable manner. At that time, one of the disciples
of the blessed Pope Gregory, a man very highly instructed in
ecclesiastical learning, was archbishop there. When he had tarried there
for a space, and, being a youth of an active spirit, was diligently
applying himself to learn those things which came under his notice,
another youth, called Biscop, surnamed Benedict, of the English
nobility, arrived there, being likewise desirous to go to Rome, of whom
we have before made mention.

<span id="v.v.xviii-p4"></span>The king gave him Wilfrid for a
companion, and bade Wilfrid conduct him to Rome. When they came to
Lyons, Wilfrid was detained there by Dalfinus, the bishop of that city;
but Benedict hastened on to Rome. For the bishop was delighted with the
youth’s prudent discourse, the grace of his comely countenance, his
eager activity, and the consistency and maturity of his thoughts; for
which reason he plentifully supplied him and his companions with all
necessaries, as long as they stayed with him; and further offered, if he
would have it, to commit to him the government of no small part of Gaul,
to give him a maiden daughter of his own brother to wife, and to regard
him always as his adopted son. But Wilfrid thanked him for the
loving-kindness which he was pleased to show to a stranger, and
answered, that he had resolved upon another course of life, and for that
reason had left his country and set out for Rome.

<span id="v.v.xviii-p5"></span>Hereupon the bishop sent him to Rome,
furnishing him with a guide and supplying plenty of all things requisite
for his journey, earnestly requesting that he would come that way, when
he returned into his own country. Wilfrid arriving at Rome, and daily
giving himself with all earnestness to prayer and the study of
ecclesiastical matters, as he had purposed in his mind, gained the
friendship of the most holy and learned Boniface, the archdeacon, who
was also counsellor to the Apostolic Pope, by whose instruction he
learned, in their order the four Gospels, and the true computation of
Easter; and many other things appertaining to ecclesiastical discipline,
which he could not learn in his own country, he acquired from the
teaching of that same master. When he had spent some months there, in
successful study, he returned into Gaul, to Dalfinus; and having stayed
with him three years, received from him the tonsure, and Dalfinus
esteemed him so highly in love that he had thoughts of making him his
heir; but this was prevented by the bishop’s cruel death, and Wilfrid
was reserved to be a bishop of his own, that is, the English, nation.
For Queen Baldhild sent soldiers with orders to put the bishop to death;
whom Wilfrid, as his clerk, attended to the place where he was to be
beheaded, being very desirous, though the bishop strongly opposed it, to
die with him; but the executioners, understanding that he was a
stranger, and of the English nation, spared him, and would not put him
to death with his bishop.

<span id="v.v.xviii-p6"></span>Returning to Britain, he won the
friendship of King Alchfrid, who had learnt to follow always and love
the catholic rules of the Church; and therefore finding him to be a
Catholic, he gave him presently land of ten families at the place called
Stanford; and not long after, the monastery, with land of thirty
families, at the place called Inhrypum; which place he had formerly
given to those that followed the doctrine of the Scots, to build a
monastery there. But, forasmuch as they afterwards, being given the
choice, had rather quit the place than adopt the Catholic Easter and
other canonical rites, according to the custom of the Roman Apostolic
Church, he gave the same to him whom he found to be instructed in better
discipline and better customs.

<span id="v.v.xviii-p7"></span>At the same time, by the said king’s
command, he was ordained priest in the same monastery, by Agilbert,
bishop of the Gewissae above-mentioned, the king being desirous that a
man of so much learning and piety should attend him constantly as his
special priest and teacher; and not long after, when the Scottish sect
had been exposed and banished, as was said above, he, with the advice
and consent of his father Oswy, sent him into Gaul, to be consecrated as
his bishop, when he was about thirty years of age, the same Agilbert
being then bishop of the city of Paris. Eleven other bishops met at the
consecration of the new bishop, and that function was most honourably
performed. Whilst he yet tarried beyond the sea, the holy man, Ceadda,
was consecrated bishop of by command of King Oswy, as has been said
above; and having nobly ruled that church three years, he retired to
take charge of his monastery of Laestingaeu, and Wilfrid was made bishop
of all the province of the Northumbrians.

<span id="v.v.xviii-p8"></span>Afterwards, in the reign of Egfrid, he
was expelled from his bishopric, and others were consecrated bishops in
his stead, of whom mention has been made above. Designing to go to Rome,
to plead his cause before the Apostolic Pope, he took ship, and was
driven by a west wind into Frisland, and honourably received by that
barbarous people and their King Aldgils, to whom he preached Christ, and
he instructed many thousands of them in the Word of truth, washing them
from the defilement of their sins in the Saviour’s font. Thus he began
there the work of the Gospel which was afterwards finished with great
devotion by the most reverend bishop of Christ, Wilbrord. Having spent
the winter there successfully among this new people of God, he set out
again on his way to Rome, where his cause being tried before Pope Agatho
and many bishops, he was by the judgement of them all acquitted of all
blame, and declared worthy of his bishopric.

<span id="v.v.xviii-p9"></span>At the same time, the said Pope Agatho
assembling a synod at Rome, of one hundred and twenty-five bishops,
against those who asserted that there was only one will and operation in
our Lord and Saviour, ordered Wilfrid also to be summoned, and, sitting
among the bishops, to declare his own faith and the faith of the
province or island whence he came; and he and his people being found
orthodox in their faith, it was thought fit to record the same among the
acts of that synod, which was done in this manner: "Wilfrid, the beloved
of God, bishop of the city of York, appealing to the Apostolic see, and
being by that authority acquitted of every thing, whether specified
against him or not, and being appointed to sit in judgement with one
hundred and twenty-five other bishops in the synod, made confession of
the true and catholic faith, and confirmed the same with his
subscription in the name of all the northern part of Britain and
Ireland, and the islands inhabited by the nations of the English and
Britons, as also by the Scots and Picts."

<span id="v.v.xviii-p10"></span>After this, returning into Britain, he
converted the province of the South Saxons from their idolatrous worship
to the faith of Christ. He also sent ministers of the Word to the Isle
of Wight; and in the second year of Aldfrid, who reigned after Egfrid,
was restored to his see and bishopric by that king’s invitation.
Nevertheless, five years after, being again accused, he was deprived of
his bishopric by the same king and certain bishops. Coming to Rome, he
was allowed to make his defence in the presence of his accusers, before
a number of bishops and the Apostolic Pope John. It was shown by the
judgement of them all, that his accusers had in part laid false
accusations to his charge; and the aforesaid Pope wrote to the kings of
the English, Ethelred and Aldfrid, to cause him to be restored to his
bishopric, because he had been unjustly condemned.

<span id="v.v.xviii-p11"></span>His acquittal was much forwarded by the
reading of the acts of the synod of Pope Agatho, of blessed memory,
which had been formerly held, when Wilfrid was in Rome and sat in
council among the bishops, as has been said before. For the acts of that
synod being, as the case required, read, by order of the Apostolic Pope,
before the nobility and a great number of the people for some days, they
came to the place where it was written, "Wilfrid, the beloved of God,
bishop of the city of York, appealing to the Apostolic see, and being by
that authority acquitted of everything, whether specified against him or
not," and the rest as above stated. This being read, the hearers were
amazed, and the reader ceasing, they began to ask of one another, who
that Bishop Wilfrid was. Then Boniface, the Pope’s counsellor, and many
others, who had seen him there in the days of Pope Agatho, said that he
was the same bishop that lately came to Rome, to be tried by the
Apostolic see, being accused by his people, and "who, said they, having
long since come here upon the like accusation, the cause and contention
of both parties being heard and examined, was proved by Pope Agatho, of
blessed memory, to have been wrongfully expelled from his bishopric, and
was held in such honour by him, that he commanded him to sit in the
council of bishops which he had assembled, as a man, of untainted faith
and an upright mind." This being heard, the Pope and all the rest said,
that a man of so great authority, who had held the office of a bishop
for nearly forty years, ought by no means to be condemned, but being
altogether cleared of the faults laid to his charge, should return home
with honour.

<span id="v.v.xviii-p12"></span>When he came to Gaul, on his way back to
Britain, on a sudden he fell sick, and the sickness increasing, he was
so weighed down by it, that he could not ride, but was carried in his
bed by the hands of his servants. Being thus come to the city of
Maeldum, in Gaul, he lay four days and nights, as if he had been dead,
and only by his faint breathing showed that he had any life in him.
Having continued thus four days, without meat or drink, without speech
or hearing, at length, on the fifth day, at daybreak, as it were
awakening out of a deep sleep, he raised himself and sat up, and opening
his eyes, saw round about him a company of brethren singing psalms and
weeping. Sighing gently, he asked where Acca, the priest, was. This man,
straightway being called, came in, and seeing him somewhat recovered and
able to speak, knelt down, and gave thanks to God, with all the brethren
there present. When they had sat awhile and begun to discourse, with
great awe, of the judgements of heaven, the bishop bade the rest go out
for a time, and spoke to the priest, Acca, after this manner:

<span id="v.v.xviii-p13"></span>"A dread vision has even now appeared to
me, which I would have you hear and keep secret, till I know what God
will please to do with me. There stood by me a certain one, glorious in
white raiment, and he told me that he was Michael, the Archangel, and
said, "I am sent to call you back from death: for the Lord has granted
you life, through the prayers and tears of your disciples and brethren,
and the intercession of His Blessed Mother Mary, of perpetual virginity;
wherefore I tell you, that you shall now recover from this sickness; but
be ready, for I will return and visit you at the end of four years. And
when you come into your country, you shall recover the greater part of
the possessions that have been taken from you, and shall end your days
in peace and quiet." The bishop accordingly recovered, whereat all men
rejoiced and gave thanks to God, and setting forward on his journey, he
arrived n Britain.

<span id="v.v.xviii-p14"></span>Having read the letters which he brought
from the Apostolic Pope, Bertwald, the archbishop, and sometime king,
but then abbot, readily took his part; for the said Ethelred, calling to
him Coenred, whom he had made king in his own stead, begged him to be
friends with Wilfrid, in which request he prevailed; nevertheless
Aldfrid, king of the Northumbrians, disdained to receive him. But he
died soon after, and so it came to pass that, during the reign of his
son Osred, when a synod was assembled before long by the river Nidd,
after some contention on both sides, at length, by the consent of all,
he was restored to the government of his own church; and thus he lived
in peace four years, till the day of his death. He died in his
monastery, which he had in the province of Undalum, under the government
of the Abbot Cuthbald; and by the ministry of the brethren, he was
carried to his first monastery which is called Inhrypum, and buried in
the church of the blessed Apostle Peter, hard by the altar on the south
side, as has been mentioned above, and this epitaph was written over
him:

<span id="v.v.xviii-p15"></span>"Here rests the body of the great Bishop
Wilfrid, who, for love of piety, built these courts and consecrated them
with the noble name of Peter, to whom Christ, the Judge of all the
earth, gave the keys of Heaven. And devoutly he clothed them with gold
and Tyrian purple; yea, and he placed here the trophy of the Cross, of
shining ore, uplifted high; moreover he caused the four books of the
Gospel to be written in gold in their order, and he gave a case meet for
them of ruddy gold. And he also brought the holy season of Easter,
returning in its course, to accord with the true teaching of the
catholic rule which the Fathers fixed, and, banishing all doubt and
error, gave his nation sure guidance in their worship. And in this place
he gathered a great throng of monks, and with all diligence safeguarded
the precepts which the Fathers’ rule enjoined. And long time sore vexed
by many a peril at home and abroad, when he had held the office of a
bishop forty-five years, he passed away and with joy departed to the
heavenly kingdom. Grant, Jesus, that the flock may follow in the path of
the shepherd."
