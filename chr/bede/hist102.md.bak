### <span id="v.iv.xvi-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XVI. How the Isle of Wight received Christian inhabitants, and two royal youths of that island were killed immediately after Baptism. \[686 A. D.\]

<span id="v.iv.xvi-p1"></span>AFTER Caedwalla had obtained possession of
the kingdom of the Gewissae, he took also the Isle of Wight, which till
then was entirely given over to idolatry, and by merciless slaughter
endeavoured to destroy all the inhabitants thereof, and to place in
their stead people from his own province; binding himself by a vow,
though it is said that he was not yet regenerated in Christ, to give the
fourth part of the land and of the spoil to the Lord, if he took the
island. He fulfilled this vow by giving the same for the service of the
Lord to Bishop Wilfrid, who happened at the time to have come thither
from his own people.The measure of that island, according to the
computation of the English, is of twelve hundred families, wherefore an
estate of three hundred families was given to the Bishop. The part which
he received, he committed to one of his clerks called Bernwin, who was
his sister’s son, assigning to him a priest, whose name was Hiddila, to
administer the Word and layer of life to all that would be saved.

<span id="v.iv.xvi-p2"></span>Here I think it ought not to be omitted
that, as the first fruits of those of that island who believed and were
saved, two royal boys, brothers to Arwald, king of the island, were
crowned with the special grace of God. For when the enemy approached,
they made their escape out of the island, and crossed over into the
neighbouring province of the Jutes.Coming to the place called At the
Stone, they thought to be concealed from the victorious king, but they
were betrayed and ordered to be killed. This being made known to a
certain abbot and priest, whose name was Cynibert, who had a monastery
not far from there, at a place called Hreutford, (Redbridge) that is,
the Ford of Reeds, he came to the king, who then lay in concealment in
those parts to be cured of the wounds which he had received whilst he
was fighting in the Isle of Wight, and begged of him, that if the boys
must needs be killed, he might be allowed first to instruct them in the
mysteries of the Christian faith. The king consented, and the bishop
having taught them the Word of truth, and cleansed them in the font of
salvation, assured to them their entrance into the kingdom of Heaven.
Then the executioner came, and they joyfully underwent the temporal
death, through which they did not doubt they were to pass to the life of
the soul, which is everlasting. Thus, after this manner, when all the
provinces of Britain had received the faith of Christ, the Isle of Wight
also received the same; yet because it was suffering under the
affliction of foreign subjection, no man there received the office or
see of a bishop, before Daniel, who is now bishop of the West Saxons.

<span id="v.iv.xvi-p3"></span>The island is situated opposite the
borders of the South Saxons and the Gewissae, being separated from it by
a sea, three miles wide, which is called Solvente. (The Solent) In this
sea, the two tides of the ocean, which break upon Britain all round its
coasts from the boundless northern ocean, daily meet in conflict beyond
the mouth of the river Homelea, (The Hamble)which runs into the
aforesaid sea, through the lands of the Jutes, belonging to the country
of the Gewissae; and after this struggle of the tides, they fall back
and return into the ocean whence they come.
