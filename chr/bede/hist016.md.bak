### <span id="v.i.xiii-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XIV. How the Britons, compelled by the great famine, drove the barbarians out of the their territories, and soon after there ensued, along with abundance of corn, decay of morals, pestilence, and the downfall of the nation.

<span id="v.i.xiii-p1"></span>IN the meantime, the aforesaid famine
distressing the Britons more and more, and leaving to posterity a
lasting memory of its mischievous effects, obliged many of them to
submit themselves to the depredators; though others still held out,
putting their trust in God, when human help failed. These continually
made raids from the mountains, caves, and woods, and, at length, began
to inflict severe losses on their enemies, who had been for so many
years plundering the country. The bold Irish robbers thereupon returned
home, intending’ to come again before long. The Picts then settled down
in the farthest part of the island and afterwards remained there; but
they did not fail to plunder and harass the Britons from time to time.

<span id="v.i.xiii-p2"></span>Now, when the ravages of the enemy at
length abated, the island began to abound with such plenty of grain as
had never been known in any age before; along with plenty, evil living
increased, and this was immediately attended by the taint of all manner
of crime; in particular, cruelty, hatred of truth, and love of
falsehood; insomuch, that if any one among them happened to be milder
than the rest, and more inclined to truth, all the rest abhorred and
persecuted him unrestrainedly, as if he had been the enemy of Britain.
Nor were the laity only guilty of these things, but even our Lord’s own
flock, with its shepherds, casting off the easy yoke of Christ, gave
themselves up to drunkenness, enmity, quarrels, strife, envy, and other
such sins. In the meantime, on a sudden, a grievous plague fell upon
that corrupt generation, which soon destroyed such numbers of them, that
the living scarcely availed to bury the dead: yet, those that survived,
could not be recalled from the spiritual death, which they had incurred’
through their sins, either by the death of their friends, or the fear of
death. Whereupon, not long after, a more severe vengeance for their
fearful crimes fell upon the sinful nation. They held a council to
determine what was to be done, and where they should seek help to
prevent or repel the cruel and frequent incursions of the northern
nations; and in concert with their King Vortigern, it was unanimously
decided to call the Saxons to their aid from beyond the sea, which, as
the event plainly showed, was brought about by the Lord’s will, that
evil might fall upon them for their wicked deeds.

[Next: XV. How the Angles, being invited into Britain, at first drove
off the enemy; but not long after, making a league with them, turned
their weapons against their allies.](hist017.md)
