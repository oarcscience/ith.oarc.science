### <span id="v.i.xix-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XX. How the same Bishops brought help from Heaven to the Britons in a battle, and then returned home. \[430 A.D.\]

<span id="v.i.xix-p1"></span>IN the meantime, the Saxons and Picts, with
their united forces, made war upon the Britons, who in these straits
were compelled to take up arms. In their terror thinking themselves
unequal to their enemies, they implored the assistance of the holy
bishops; who, hastening to them as they had promised, inspired so much
confidence into these fearful people, that one would have thought they
had been joined by a mighty army. Thus, by these apostolic leaders,
Christ Himself commanded in their camp. The holy days of Lent were also
at hand, and were rendered more sacred by the presence of the bishops,
insomuch that the people being instructed by daily sermons, came
together eagerly to receive the grace of baptism. For a great multitude
of the army desired admission to the saving waters, and a wattled church
was constructed for the Feast of the Resurrection of our Lord, and so
fitted up for the army in the field as if it were in a city. Still wet
with the baptismal water the troops set forth; the faith of the people
was fired; and where arms had been deemed of no avail, they looked to
the help of God. News reached the enemy of the manner and method of
their purification, who, assured of success, as if they had to deal with
an unarmed host, hastened forward with renewed eagerness. But their
approach was made known by scouts. When, after the celebration of
Easter, the greater part of the army, fresh from the font, began to take
up arms and prepare for war, Germanus offered to be their leader. He
picked out the most active, explored the country round about, and
observed, in the way by which the enemy was expected, a valley
encompassed by hills of moderate height. In that place he drew up his
untried troops, himself acting as their general. And now a formidable
host of foes drew near, visible, as they approached, to his men lying in
ambush. Then, on a sudden, Germanus, bearing the standard, exhorted his
men, and bade them all in a loud voice repeat his words. As the enemy
advanced in all security, thinking to take them by surprise, the bishops
three times cried, "Hallelujah." A universal shout of the same word
followed, and the echoes from the surrounding hills gave back the cry on
all sides, the enemy was panic-stricken, fearing, not only the
neighbouring rocks, but even the very frame of heaven above them; and
such was their terror, that their feet were not swift enough to save
them. They fled in disorder, casting away their arms, and well satisfied
if, even with unprotected bodies, they could escape the danger; many of
them, flying headlong in their fear, were engulfed by the river which
they had crossed. The Britons, without a blow, inactive spectators of
the victory they had gained, beheld their vengeance complete. The
scattered spoils were gathered up, and the devout soldiers rejoiced in
the success which Heaven had granted them. The prelates thus triumphed
over the enemy without bloodshed, and gained a victory by faith, without
the aid of human force. Thus, having settled the affairs of the island,
and restored tranquillity by the defeat of the invisible foes, as well
as of enemies in the flesh, they prepared to return home. Their own
merits, and the intercession of the blessed martyr Alban, obtained for
them a calm passage, and the happy vessel restored them in peace to the
desires of their people.
