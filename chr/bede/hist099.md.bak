### <span id="v.iv.xiii-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XIII. How Bishop Wilfrid converted the province of the South Saxons to Christ. \[681 A.D.\]

<span id="v.iv.xiii-p1"></span>BUT Wilfrid was expelled from his
bishopric, and having long travelled in many lands, went to Rome, and
afterwards returned to Britain. Though he could not, by reason the
enmity of the aforesaid king, be received into his own country or
diocese, yet he could not be restrained from the ministry of the Gospel;
for, taking his way into the province of the South Saxons,which extends
from Kent to the south and west, as far as the West Saxons, containing
land of 7,000 families, and was at that time still in bondage to pagan
rites, he administered to them the Word of faith, and the Baptism of
salvation. Ethelwalch,king of that nation, had been, not long before,
baptized in the province of the Mercians, at the instance of King Wulf
here, who was present, and received him as his godson when he came forth
from the font, and in token of this adoption gave him two provinces, to
wit, the Isle of Wight, and the province of the Meanware, in the country
of the West Saxons.The bishop, therefore, with the king’s consent, or
rather to his great joy, cleansed in the sacred font the foremost
ealdormen and thegns of that country; and the priests, Eappa and Padda,
and Burghelm, and Oiddi, either then, or afterwards, baptized the rest
of the people. The queen, whose name was Eabae, had been baptized in her
own country, the province of the Hwiccas. She was the daughter of
Eanfrid, the brother of Aenhere,who were both Christians, as were their
people; but all the province of the South Saxons was ignorant of the
Name of God and the faith. But there was among them a certain monk of
the Scottish nation, whose name was Dicul, who had a very small
monastery, at the place called Bosanhamm, (Bosham near Chichester)
encompassed by woods and seas, and in it there were five or six
brothers, who served the Lord in humility and poverty; but none of the
natives cared either to follow their course of life, or hear their
preaching.

<span id="v.iv.xiii-p2"></span>But Bishop Wilfrid, while preaching the
Gospel to the people, not only delivered them from the misery of eternal
damnation, but also from a terrible calamity of temporal death. For no
rain had fallen in that district for three years before his arrival in
the province, whereupon a grievous famine fell upon the people and
pitilessly destroyed them; insomuch that it is said that often forty or
fifty men, wasted with hunger, would go together to some precipice, or
to the sea-shore, and there, hand in hand, in piteous wise cast them
themselves down either to perish by the fall, or be swallowed up by the
waves. But on the very day on which the nation received the Baptism of
the faith, there fell a soft but plentiful rain; the earth revived, the
fields grew green again, and the season was pleasant and fruitful. Thus
the old superstition was cast away, and idolatry renounced, the heart
and flesh of all rejoiced in the living God, for they perceived that He
Who is the true God had enriched them by His heavenly grace with both
inward and outward blessings. For the bishop, when he came into the
province, and found so great misery from famine there, taught them to
get their food by fishing; for their sea and rivers abounded in fish,
but the people had no skill to take any of them, except eels alone. The
bishop’s men having gathered eel-nets everywhere, cast them into the
sea, and by the blessing of God took three hundred fishes of divers
sorts, which being divided into three parts, they gave a hundred to the
poor, a hundred to those of whom they had the nets, and kept a hundred
for their own use. By this benefit the bishop gained the affections of
them all, and they began more readily at his preaching to hope for
heavenly blessings, seeing that by his help they had received those
which are temporal.

<span id="v.iv.xiii-p3"></span>At this time, King Ethelwalch gave to the
most reverend prelate, Wilfrid, land to the extent of eighty-seven
families, to maintain his company who were wandering in exile. The place
is called Selaeseu, (Selsey, south of Chichester) that is, the Island of
the Sea-Calf; it is encompassed by the sea on all sides, except the
west, where is an entrance about the cast of a sling in width; which
sort of place is by the Latins called a peninsula, by the Greeks, a
cherronesos. Bishop Wilfrid, having this place given him, founded
therein a monastery, chiefly of the brethren he had brought with him,
and established a rule of life; and his successors are known to be there
to this day. He himself, both in word and deed performed the duties of a
bishop in those parts during the space of five years, until the death of
King Egfrid,and was justly honoured by all. And forasmuch as the king,
together with the said place, gave him all the goods that were therein,
with the lands and men, he instructed all the people in the faith of
Christ, and cleansed them in the water of Baptism. Among whom were two
hundred and fifty bondsmen and bondswomen, all of whom he saved by
Baptism from slavery to the Devil, and in like manner, by giving them
their liberty, set them free from slavery to man.
