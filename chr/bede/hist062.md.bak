### <span id="v.iii.vi-p0.1"></span>CHAP. VI. Of King Oswald’s wonderful piety and religion. \[635-642 A.D.\]

<span id="v.iii.vi-p1"></span> KING OSWALD, with the English nation
which he governed, being instructed by the teaching of this bishop, not
only learned to hope for a heavenly kingdom unknown to his fathers, but
also obtained of the one God, Who made heaven and earth, a greater
earthly kingdom than any of his ancestors. In brief, he brought under
his dominion all the nations and provinces of Britain, which are divided
into four languages, to wit, those of the Britons, the Picts, the Scots,
and the English. Though raised to that height of regal power, wonderful
to relate, he was always humble, kind, and generous to the poor and to
strangers.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p2"></span> To give one instance, it is told, that
when he was once sitting at dinner, on the holy day of Easter, with the
aforesaid bishop, and a silver dish full of royal dainties was set
before him, and they were just about to put forth their hands to bless
the bread, the servant, whom he had appointed to relieve the needy, came
in on a sudden, and told the king, that a great multitude of poor folk
from all parts was sitting in the streets begging alms of the king; he
immediately ordered the meat set before him to be carried to the poor,
and the dish to be broken in pieces and divided among them. At which
sight, the bishop who sat by him, greatly rejoicing at such an act of
piety, clasped his right hand and said, "May this hand never decay."
This fell out according to his prayer, for his hands with the arms being
cut off from his body, when he was slain in battle, remain uncorrupted
to this day, and are kept in a silver shrine, as revered relics, in St.
Peter’s church in the royal city, which has taken its name from Bebba,
one of its former queens. Through this king’s exertions the provinces of
the Deiri and the Bernicians, which till then had been at variance, were
peacefully united and moulded into one people. He was nephew to King
Edwin through his sister Acha; and it was fit that so great a
predecessor should have in his own family such an one to succeed him in
his religion and sovereignty.
