### <span id="v.iv.xxii-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XXII. How a certain captive’s chains fell off when Masses were sung for Him. \[679 A. D.\]

<span id="v.iv.xxii-p1"></span>IN the aforesaid battle, wherein King
Aelfwine was killed, a memorable incident is known to have happened,
which I think ought by no means to be passed over in, silence; for the
story will be profitable to the salvation of many. In that battle a
youth called Imma, one of the king’s thegns, was struck down, and having
lain as if dead all that day and the next night among the bodies of the
slain, at length he came to himself and revived, and sitting up, bound
his own wounds as best as he could. Then having rested awhile, he stood
up, and went away to see if he could find any friends to take care of
him; but in so doing he was discovered and taken by some of the enemy’s
army, and carried before their lord, who was one of King Ethelred’s
nobles. Being asked by him who he was, and fearing to own himself a
thegn, he answered that he was a peasant, a poor man and married, and he
declared that he had come to the war with others like himself to bring
provisions to the army." The noble entertained him, kind ordered his
wounds to be dressed, and when he began to recover, to prevent his
escaping, he ordered him to be bound at night. But he could not be
bound, for as soon as they that bound him were gone, his bonds were
loosed.

<span id="v.iv.xxii-p2"></span>Now he had a brother called Tunna, who
was a priest and abbot of a monastery in the city which is still called
Tunnacaestir after him.(Towcester) This man, hearing that his brother
had been killed in the battle, went to see if haply he could find his
body; and finding another very like him in all respects, he believed it
to be his. So he carried it to his monastery, and buried it honourably,
and took care often to say Masses for the absolution of his soul; the
celebration whereof occasioned what I have said, that none could bind
him but he was presently loosed again. In the meantime, the noble that
had kept him was amazed, and began to inquire why he could not be bound;
whether perchance he had any spells about him, such as are spoken of in
stories. He answered that he knew nothing of those arts; "but I have,"
said he, "a brother who is a priest in my country, and I know that he,
supposing me to be killed, is saying frequent Masses for me; and if I
were now in the other life, my soul there, through his intercession,
would be delivered from penalty."

<span id="v.iv.xxii-p3"></span>When he had been a prisoner with the
noble some time, those who attentively observed him, by his countenance,
habit, and discourse, took notice, that he was not of the meaner sort,
as he had said, but of some quality. The noble then privately sending
for him, straitly questioned him, whence he came, promising to do him no
harm on that account if he would frankly confess who he was. This he
did, declaring that he had been a thegn of the king’s, and the noble
answered, "I perceived by all your answers that you were no peasant. And
now you deserve to die, because all my brothers and relations were
killed in that fight; yet I will not put you to death, that I may not
break my promise."

<span id="v.iv.xxii-p4"></span>As soon, therefore, as he was recovered,
he sold him to a certain Frisian at London, but he could not in any wise
be bound either by him, or as he was being led thither. But when his
enemies had put all manner of bonds on him, and the buyer perceived that
he could in no way be bound, he gave him leave to ransom himself if he
could. Now it was at the third hour, when the Masses were wont to be
said, that his bonds were most frequently loosed. He, having taken an
oath that he would either return, or send his owner the money for the
ransom, went into Kent to King Hlothere, who was son to the sister of
Queen Ethelthryth,above spoken of, for he had once been that queen’s
thegn. From him he asked and obtained the price of his freedom, and as
he had promised, sent it to his master for his ransom.

<span id="v.iv.xxii-p5"></span>Returning afterwards into his own
country, and coming to his brother, he gave him an exact account of all
his misfortunes, and the consolation afforded to him in them; and from
what his brother told him he understood, that his bonds had been
generally loosed at those times when Masses had been celebrated for him;
and he perceived that other advantages and blessings which had fallen to
his lot in his time of danger, had been conferred on him from Heaven,
through the intercession of his brother, and the Oblation of the saving
Sacrifice. Many, on hearing this account from the aforesaid man, were
stirred up in faith and pious devotion to prayer, or to alms-giving, or
to make an offering to God of the Sacrifice of the holy Oblation, for
the deliverance of their friends who had departed this world; for they
knew that such saving Sacrifice availed for the eternal redemption both
of body and soul. This story was also told me by some of those who had
heard it related by the man himself to whom it happened; therefore,
since I had a clear understanding of it, I have not hesitated to insert
it in my Ecclesiastical History.
