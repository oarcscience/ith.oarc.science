### <span id="v.i.xxi-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XXII. How the Britons, being for a time at rest from foreign invasions, wore themselves out by civil wars, and at the same time gave themselves up to more heinous crimes.

<span id="v.i.xxi-p1"></span>IN the meantime, in Britain, there was some
respite from foreign, but not from civil war. The cities destroyed by
the enemy and abandoned remained in ruins; and the natives, who had
escaped the enemy, now fought against each other. Nevertheless, the
kings, priests, private men, and the nobility, still remembering the
late calamities and slaughters, in some measure kept within bounds; but
when these died, and another generation succeeded, which knew nothing of
those times, and was only acquainted with the existing peaceable state
of things, all the bonds of truth and justice were so entirely broken,
that there was not only no trace of them ‘remaining, but only very few
persons seemed to retain any memory of them at all. To other crimes
beyond description, which their own historian, Gildas, mournfully
relates, they added this—that they never preached the faith to the
Saxons, or English, who dwelt amongst them. Nevertheless, the goodness
of God did not forsake his people, whom he foreknew, but sent to the
aforesaid nation much more worthy heralds of the truth, to bring it to
the faith.
