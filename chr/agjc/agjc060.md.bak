#### Chapter 57

Meeting of the sages, continued. Opening addresses. Seven days'
silence.  
  
**1.** Ashbina said, Assyria is the land of doubt; the chariot of my
people, that in which they mostly ride, is labelled Doubt.  
**2.** Once Faith walked forth in Babylon; and she was bright and fair;
but she clothed in such white robes that men became afraid of her.  
**3.** And every wheel began to turn, and Doubt made war on her, and
drove her from the land; and she came back no more.  
**4.** In form men worship God, the One; in heart they are not sure that
God exists.  
**5.** Faith worships at the shrine of one not seen; but Doubt must see
her God.  
**6.** The greatest need of all Assyria is faith--a faith that seasons
every thing that is, with certainty.  
**7.** And then Apollo said, The greatest needs of Greece are true
concepts of God.  
**8.** Theogony in Greece is rudderless, for every thought may be a god,
and worshipped as a god.  
**9.** The plane of thought is broad, and full of sharp antagonists; and
so the circle of the gods is filled with enmity, with wars and base
intrigues.  
**10.** Greece needs a master mind to stand above the gods; to raise the
thoughts of men away from many gods to God the One.  
**11.** We know that light is coming o'er the hills. God speed the
light.  
**12.** Matheno said, Behold this land of mystery! this Egypt of the
dead!  
**13.** Our temples long have been the tombs of all the hidden things of
time; our temples, crypts and caves are dark.  
**14.** In light there are no secret things. The sun reveals all hidden
truth. There are no mysteries in God.  
**15.** Behold the rising sun! His beams are entering every door; yea,
every crevice of the mystic crypt of Mizraim.  
**16.** We hail the light! All Egypt craves the light.  
**17.** And Philo said, The need of Hebrew thought and life is
liberty.  
**18.** The Hebrew prophets, seers, and givers of the law, were men of
power, men of holy thought, and they bequeathed to us a system of
philosophy that is ideal; one strong enough and good enough to lead our
people to the goal of perfectness.  
**19.** But carnal minds repudiated holiness; a priesthood filled with
selfishness arose, and purity in heart became a myth; the people were
enslaved.  
**20.** The priesthood is the curse of Israel; but when he comes, who is
to come, he will proclaim emancipation for the slaves; my people will be
free.  
**21.** Behold, for God has made incarnate wisdom, love and light, which
he has called Immanuel.  
**22.** To him is given the keys to open up the dawn; and here, as man,
he walks with us.  
**23.** And then the council chamber door was opened and the Logos stood
among the sages of the world.  
**24.** Again the sages sat in silence seven days.
