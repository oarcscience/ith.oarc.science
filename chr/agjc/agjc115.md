#### Chapter 112

The Christines in the home of Mary of Magdala. Jesus calls his
disciples, "Little Flock," and charges them to place their affections on
divine things. He teaches them regarding the inner life.  
  
**1.** And Jesus left the multitudes and went with his disciples up to
Mary's home; and as they sat about the board to dine he said,  
**2.** My little flock, fear not; it is your Father's will that you
shall rule the kingdom of the soul.  
**3.** A ruler in the house of God is servant of the Lord of Hosts, and
man cannot serve God except by serving men.  
**4.** A servant in the house of God cannot be servant in the house of
wealth; nor in the synagogue of sense.  
**5.** If you are tied to lands, or bonds, or wealth of earth, your
hearts are knit to things of earth; for where your treasures are there
are your hearts.  
**6.** Dispose of all your wealth, distribute it among the poor, and put
your trust in God, and you nor yours will ever come to want.  
**7.** This is a test of faith, and God will not accept the service of
faithless one.  
**8.** The time is ripe; your Master comes upon the clouds; the eastern
sky is glowing with his presence now.  
**9.** Put on reception robes; gird up your loins; trim up your lamps
and fill them well with oil, and be prepared to meet your Lord; when you
are ready, he will come.  
**10.** Thrice blessed are the servants who are ready to receive their
Lord.  
**11.** Behold, for he will gird himself, and will prepare a sumptuous
feast for every one, and he himself will serve.  
**12.** It matters not when he shall come; it may be at the second
watch; it may be at the third; but blessed are the servants who are
ready to receive.  
**13.** You cannot leave your door ajar and go to sleep, and wait in
blissful ignorance of the fleeting time;  
**14.** For thieves will surely come and take away your goods and bind
and carry you away to robbers' dens.  
**15.** And if you are not carried forth, the Master when he comes will
not regard a sleeping guard as friend, but as a foe.  
**16.** Beloved, these are times when every man must be awake and at his
post, for none can tell the hour nor the day when man shall be
revealed.  
**17.** And Peter said, Lord is this parable for us, or for the
multitudes?  
**18.** And Jesus, Why need you ask? God is not a man that he should
show respect for one and cast another off.  
**19.** Whoever will may come and gird himself, and trim his lamp, and
find a turret in the tower of life where he may watch, and be prepared
to meet the Lord.  
**20.** But you, as children of the light, have come, and you have
learned the language of the court, and may stand forth and lead the
way.  
**21.** But you may wait, and think that you are ready to receive the
Lord, and still he does not come.  
**22.** And you may grow impatient and begin to long for carnal ways
again, and may begin to exercise your rule;  
**23.** To beat, and otherwise maltreat the servants of the house, and
fill yourselves with wine and meat.  
**24.** And what will say the Lord when he shall come?  
**25.** Behold, for he will cast the faithless servant from his house;
and many years will come and go before he can be cleansed, and be
thought worthy to receive his Lord.  
**26.** The servant who has come into the light, who knows the Master's
will and does it not; the trusted guard who goes to sleep within the
turret of the tower of life,  
**27.** Shall feel the lash of justice many times, while he who does not
know his Master's will and does it not, will not receive the graver
punishment.  
**28.** The man who comes and stands before the open door of opportunity
and does not enter in, but goes his way,  
**29.** Will come again and find the door made fast, and when he calls,
the door will open not,  
**30.** The guard will say, you had the pass-word once, but you threw it
away and now the Master knows you not; depart.  
**31.** And verily I say to you, To whom much has been given, much is
required; to whom a little has been given, a little only is required.
