#### Chapter 30

Jesus receives news of the death of his father. He writes a letter to
his mother. The letter. He sends it on its way by a merchant.  
  
**1.** One day as Jesus stood beside the Ganges busy with his work, a
caravan, returning from the West, drew near.  
**2.** And one, approaching Jesus, said, We come to you from your native
land and bring unwelcome news.  
**3.** Your father is no more on earth; your mother grieves; and none
can comfort her. She wonders whether you are still alive or not; she
longs to see you once again.  
**4.** And Jesus bowed his head in silent thought; and then he wrote. Of
what he wrote this is the sum:  
**5.** My mother, noblest of the womankind; A man just from my native
land has brought me word that father is no more in flesh, and that you
grieve, and are disconsolate.  
**6.** My mother, all is well; is well for father and is well for you.  
**7.** His work in this earth-round is done, and it is nobly done.  
**8.** In all the walks of life men cannot charge him with deceit,
dishonesty, nor wrong intent.  
**9.** Here in this round he finished many heavy tasks, and he has gone
from hence prepared to solve the problems of the round of soul.  
**10.** Our Father-God is with him there, as he was with him here; and
there his angel guards his footsteps lest he goes astray.  
**11.** Why should you weep? Tears cannot conquer grief. There is no
power in grief to mend a broken heart.  
**12.** The plane of grief is idleness; the busy soul can never grieve;
it has no time for grief.  
**13.** When grief come trooping through the heart, just lose yourself;
plunge deep into the ministry of love, and grief is not.  
**14.** Yours is a ministry of love, and all the world is calling out
for love.  
**15.** Then let the past go with the past; rise from the cares of
carnal things and give your life for those who live.  
**16.** And if you lose your life in serving life you will sure to find
in it the morning sun, the evening dews, in song of bird, in flowers,
and in the stars of night.  
**17.** In just a little while your problems of this earth-round will be
solved; and when your sums are all worked out it will be pleasure
unalloyed for you to enter wider fields of usefulness, to solve the
greater problems of the soul.  
**18.** Strive, then, to be content, and I will come to you some day and
bring you richer gifts than gold or precious stones.  
**19.** I'm sure that John will care for you, supplying all your needs;
and I am with you all the way, Jehoshua.  
**20.** And by the hand of one, a merchant, going to Jerusalem, he sent
this letter on its way.
