#### Chapter 34

The Jubilee in Kapavistu. Jesus teaches in the plaza and the people are
astonished. He relates the parable of the unkept vineyard and the vine
dresser. The priests are angered by his words.  
  
**1.** It was a gala day in sacred Kapavista; a throng of Buddhist
worshippers had met to celebrate a Jubilee.  
**2.** And priests and masters from all parts of India were there; they
taught; but they embellished little truth with many words.  
**3.** And Jesus went into an ancient plaza and taught; he spoke of
Father-Mother-God; he told about the brotherhood of life.  
**4.** The priests and all the people were astounded at his words and
said, Is this not Buddha come again in flesh? No other one could speak
with such simplicity and power.  
**5.** And Jesus spoke a parable; he said, There was a vineyard all
unkept; the vines were high, the growth of leaves and branches great.  
**6.** The leaves were broad and shut the sunlight from the vines; the
grapes were sour, and few, and small.  
**7.** The pruner came; with his sharp knife he cut off every branch,
and not a leaf remained; just root and stalk, and nothing more.  
**8.** The busy neighbours came with one accord and were amazed, and
said to him who pruned, You foolish man! the vineyard is despoiled.  
**9.** Such desolation! There is no beauty left, and when the harvest
time shall come the gathers will find no fruit.  
**10.** The pruner said, Content yourselves with what you think, and
come again at harvest time and see.  
**11.** And when the harvest time came on the busy neighbours came
again; they were surprised.  
**12.** The naked stalks had put forth branch and leaf, and heavy
clusters of delicious grapes weighed every branch to earth.  
**13.** The gatherers rejoiced as, day by day, they carried the rich
fruitage to the press.  
**14.** Behold the vineyard of the Lord! the earth is spread with human
vines.  
**15.** The gorgeous forms and rites of men are branches, and their
words are leaves; and these have grown so great that sunlight can no
longer reach the heart; there is no fruit.  
**16.** Behold, the pruner comes, and with a two-edged knife he cuts
away the branches and the leaves of words,  
**17.** And naught is left but unclothed stalks of human life.  
**18.** The priests and they of pompous show, rebuke the pruner, and
would stay him in his work.  
**19.** They see no beauty in the stalks of human life; no promises of
fruit.  
**20.** The harvest time will come and they who scorned the pruner will
look on again and be amazed, for they will see the human stalks that
seemed so lifeless, bending low with precious fruit.  
**21.** And they will hear the harvesters rejoice, because the harvest
is so great.  
**22.** The priests were not well pleased with Jesus' words; but they
rebuked him not; they feared the multitude.
