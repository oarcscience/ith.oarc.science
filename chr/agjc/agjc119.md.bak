#### Chapter 116

The Christines are in Philip's home. Jesus interprets the parable of the
wheat and tares. He explains the unfoldment of the kingdom by parables:
the good seed; the growth of the tree; the leaven; the hidden treasure.
He goes to a mountain to pray.  
  
**1.** The Christines were in Philip's home and Peter said to Jesus,
Lord, will you explain to us the meaning of the parables you spoke
to-day? The one about the wheat and tares, especially?  
**2.** And Jesus said, God's kingdom is a duality; it has an outer and
an inner form.  
**3.** As seen by man it is composed of men, of those who make
confession of the name of Christ.  
**4.** For various reasons various people crowd this outer kingdom of
our God.  
**5.** The inner kingdom is the kingdom of the soul, the kingdom of the
pure in heart.  
**6.** The outer kingdom I may well explain in parables. Behold, for I
have seen you cast a great net out into the sea,  
**7.** And when you hauled it in, lo, it was full of every kind of fish,
some good, some bad, some great, some small; and I have seen you save
the good and throw the bad away.  
**8.** This outer kingdom is the net, and every kind of man is caught;
but in the sorting day the bad will all be cast away, the good
reserved.  
**9.** Hear, then, the meaning of the parable of the wheat and tares:  
**10.** The sower is the son of man; the field, the world; the good seed
are the children of the light; the tares, the children of the dark; the
enemy, the carnal self; the harvest day, the closing of the age; the
reapers are the messengers of God.  
**11.** The reckoning day will come to every man; then will the tares be
gathered up, and cast into the fire and be burned.  
**12.** Then will the good shine forth as suns in the kingdom of the
soul.  
**13.** And Philip said, Must men and women suffer in the flames because
they have not found the way of life?  
**14.** And Jesus said, The fire purifies. The chemist throws into the
fire the ores that hold all kinds of dross.  
**15.** The useless metal seems to be consumed; but not a grain of gold
is lost.  
**16.** There is no man that has not in him gold that cannot be
destroyed. The evil things of men are all consumed in fire; the gold
survives.  
**17.** The inner kingdom of the soul I may explain in parables:  
**18.** The son of man goes forth and scatters seeds of truth; God
waters well the soil; the seeds show life and grow; first comes the
blade, and then the stalk, and then the ear, and then the full wheat in
the ear.  
**19.** The harvest comes and, lo, the reapers bear the ripened sheaves
into the garner of the Lord.  
**20.** Again, this kingdom of the soul is like a little seed that men
may plant in fertile soil.  
**21.** (A thousand of these seeds would scarcely be a shekel's
weight.)  
**22.** The tiny seed begins to grow; it pushes through the earth, and
after years of growth it is a mighty tree and birds rest in its leafy
bowers and men find refuge 'neath its sheltering boughs from sun and
storm.  
**23.** Again, the truth, the spirit of the kingdom of the soul, is like
a ball of leaven that a woman hid in measures, three, of flour and in a
little time the whole was leavened.  
**24.** Again, the kingdom of the soul is like a treasure hidden in a
field which one has found, and straightway goes his way and sells all
that he has and buys the field.  
**25.** When Jesus had thus said he went alone into a mountain pass near
by to pray.
