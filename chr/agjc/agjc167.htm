<p></p> <h4>Chapter 164</h4> <i>
<p>Judas betrays his Lord with a kiss. Jesus is seized by the mob and the disciples flee to save their lives. Jesus is taken unto Jerusalem, Peter and John follow the mob.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>The Lord with the eleven were in the orchard of Massalian, and as they talked they saw a band of men with lanterns and with swords and clubs approaching them.<br> <b>2. </b>And Jesus said, Behold the emissaries of the evil one! and Judas leads the way.<br> <b>3. </b>And the disciples said, Lord, let us flee to save our lives.<br> <b>4. </b>But Jesus said, Why should we flee to save our lives when this is the fulfilment of the words of prophets and of seers?<br> <b>5. </b>And Jesus went alone to meet the men; and as they came he said, Why are you here, you men? whom do you seek?<br> <b>6. </b>And they replied, We seek the man from Galilee. We seek for Jesus, one who calls himself the Christ.<br> <b>7. </b>And Jesus answered, Here am I.<br> <b>8. </b>And then he raised his hands and with a mighty thought he brought the ethers to the state of light; and all the orchard was aglow with light.<br> <b>9. </b>The frenzied men were driven back and many fled and tarried not until they reached Jerusalem; and others fell upon their faces on the ground.<br> <b>10. </b>The bravest men, and they with hardest hearts, remained, and when the light had paled, the Lord again inquired, Whom do you seek?<br> <b>11. </b>And Ananias said, We seek the man from Galilee; we seek for Jesus, he who calls himself the Christ.<br> <b>12. </b>And Jesus answered him and said, I told you once before; but now I tell you once again that I am he.<br> <b>13. </b>By Ananias, Judas stood; but in a moment he had gone and coming up behind the Lord he said, My Lord; and then he kissed him as a sign that he was Jesus whom they sought.<br> <b>14. </b>And Jesus said, Do you, Iscariot, come and thus betray your master with a kiss?<br> <b>15. </b>This thing must need be done; but woe to him who does betray his Lord.<br> <b>16. </b>Your carnal greed has seared your conscience and you know not what you do; but in a little time your conscience will assert itself, and in remorse, lo, you will close your span and take your life.<br> <b>17. </b>Then the eleven came, laid hold of Judas and would have done him harm; but Jesus said,<br> <b>18. </b>You must not harm this man; you have no right to judge this man; his conscience is his judge, will sentence him and he will execute himself.<br> <b>19. </b>And then the mob led on by Malchus, servant of Caiaphas, laid hold of Jesus, and was binding him with chains.<br> <b>20. </b>And Jesus said, Why do you come in dead of night with swords and clubs to take me in this sacred place?<br> <b>21. </b>Have I not spoken in the public places of Jerusalem? Have I not healed you sick, and opened up your blinded eyes, and made your lame to walk, your deaf to hear? You could have found me any day.<br> <b>22. </b>And now you try to bind me down with chains, what are these chains but links of reeds? And then he raised his hands; the chains were broken and they fell to earth.<br> <b>23. </b>And Malchus thought the Lord would flee to save his life, and with a club he fain would smite him in the face.<br> <b>24. </b>But Peter had a sword, and rushing up he smote the man and wounded him.<br> <b>25. </b>But Jesus said, Stay, Peter, stay; put up your sword; you are not called to fight with swords and clubs. Whoever wields the sword shall perish by the sword.<br> <b>26. </b>I do not need protection by the sons of men, for I could call this moment and a legion, yea, twelve legions of the messengers of God, would come and stand in my defence; but then it is not well.<br> <b>27. </b>And then he said to Malchus, Man, I would not have you harmed. And then he laid his hand upon the wound that Peter made, and it was healed.<br> <b>28. </b>Then Jesus said, Be not concerned lest I should tear myself away from you and flee to save my life. I have no wish to save my life; do with me as you wish.<br> <b>29. </b>And then the mob rushed up to seize the eleven to take them back to stand for trial as the aids of Jesus in his crimes.<br> <b>30. </b>But the disciples, every one of them, deserted Jesus, and they fled to save their lives.<br> <b>31. </b>Now, John was last to flee; the mob laid hold of him and tore his garments all to shreds; but he escaped in nakedness.<br> <b>32. </b>Massalian saw the man, and took him to his home and gave him other clothes; and then he followed after them who led the Lord away.<br> <b>33. </b>And Peter was ashamed because of his weak cowardice, and when he was himself again he joined with John and followed close behind the mob, and came into Jerusalem.</p>
