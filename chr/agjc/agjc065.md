#### Chapter 62

John, the harbinger, again visits Jerusalem. Speaks to the people.
Promises to meet them at Gilgal in seven days. Goes to Bethany and
attends a feast.  
  
**1.** Next day John went again into the temple courts and said,  
**2.** Prepare, O Israel, prepare to meet your king.  
**3.** The chief priests and the scribes would know the meaning of his
words; they said.  
**4.** Bold man, what is the purport of this message that you bring to
Israel? If you be seer and prophet tell us plainly who has sent you
here?  
**5.** And John replied, I am the voice of one who cries out in the
wilderness, Prepare the way, make straight the paths, for, lo, the
Prince of Peace will come to rule in love.  
**6.** Your prophet Malachi wrote down the words of God:  
**7.** And I will send Elijah unto you before the retribution day shall
come, to turn again the hearts of men to God, and if they will not turn,
lo, I will smite them with a curse.  
**8.** You men of Israel; you know your sins. As I passed by I saw a
wounded bird prone in your streets, and men of every class were beating
it with clubs; and then I saw that Justice was its name.  
**9.** I looked again and saw that its companion had been killed; the
pure white wings of Righteousness were trampled in the dust.  
**10.** I tell you men, your awfulness of guilt has made a cesspool of
iniquity that sends a fearful stench to heaven.  
**11.** Reform, O Israel, reform; prepare to meet your king.  
**12.** And then John turned away and as he went he said,  
**13.** In seven days, lo, I will stand at Gilgal, by the Jordan ford,
where Israel first crossed into the promised land.  
**14.** And then he left the temple court to enter it no more; but many
people followed him as far as Bethany, and there he tarried at the home
of Lazarus, his kin.  
**15.** The anxious people gathered all about the home and would not go;
then John came forth and said,  
**16.** Reform, O Israel, reform; prepare to meet your king.  
**17.** The sins of Israel do not all lie at the door of priest and
scribe. O think you not that all the sinners of Judea are found among
the rulers and the men of wealth.  
**18.** It is no sign that man is good and pure because he lives in
want.  
**19.** The listless, shiftless vagabonds of earth are mostly poor and
have to beg for bread.  
**20.** I saw the very men that cheered because I told the priests and
scribes of their injustice unto man, throw stones and beat poor Justice
in the streets.  
**21.** I saw them trample on the poor dead bird of Righteousness;  
**22.** And you who follow after me, you commoners, are not one whit
behind the scribes and priests in crime.  
**23.** Reform, you men of Israel; the king has come; prepare to meet
your king.  
**24.** With Lazarus and his sisters, John remained for certain days.  
**25.** In honour of the Nazarite a feast was spread, and all the people
stood about the board.  
**26.** And when the chief men of the town poured out the sparkling wine
and offered John a cup, he took it, held it high in air, and said,  
**27.** Wine makes glad the carnal heart, and it makes sad the human
soul; it plunges deep in bitterness and gall the deathless spirit of the
man.  
**28.** I took the vow of Nazar when a child, and not a drop has ever
passed my lips.  
**29.** And if you would make glad the coming king, then shun the cup as
you would shun a deadly thing.  
**30.** And then he threw the sparking wine out in the street.
