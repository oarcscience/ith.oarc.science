#### SECTION II  BETH  Birth and Infancy of the Harbinger, and of Jesus

#### Chapter 2

Zacharias and Elizabeth. Prophetic messages of Gabriel to Zacharias,
Elizabeth and Mary. Birth of John. Prophecy of Zacharias.  
  
**1.** Near Hebron in the hills of Judah, Zacharias and Elizabeth
abode.  
**2.** They were devote and just, and every day they read the Law, the
Prophets and the Psalms which told of one to come, strong to redeem; and
they were waiting for the king.  
**3.** Now, Zacharias was a priest, and in his turn he led the temple
service in Jerusalem.  
**4.** It came to pass as Zacharias stood before the Lord and burned the
incense in the Holy Place, that Gabriel came and stood before his
face.  
**5.** And Zacharias was afraid; he thought that some great evil was
about to come upon the Jews.  
**6.** But Gabriel said, O man of God, fear not; I bring to you and all
the world, a message of good will, and peace on earth.  
**7.** Behold, the Prince of Peace, the king you seek, will quickly
come.  
**8.** Your wife will bear to you a son, a holy son, of whom the prophet
wrote,  
**9.** Behold, I send Elijah unto you again before the coming of the
Lord; and he will level down the hills and fill the valleys up, and pave
the way for him who shall redeem.  
**10.** From the beginning of the age your son has borne the name of
John, the mercy of the Lord; his name is John.  
**11.** He will be honoured in the sight of God, and he will drink no
wine, and from his birth he will be filled with Holy Breath.  
**12.** And Gabriel stood before Elizabeth as she was in the silence of
her home, and told her all the words that he had said to Zacharias in
Jerusalem.  
**13.** When he had done the service of his course, the priest went
home, and with Elizabeth rejoiced.  
**14.** Five months passed by and Gabriel came to Mary in her home in
Nazareth and said,  
**15.** Hail Mary, hail! Once blessed in the name of God; twice blessed
in the name of Holy Breath; thrice blessed in the name of Christ; for
you are worthy, and will bear a son who shall be called Immanuel.  
**16.** His name is Jesus, for he saves his people from their sins.  
**17.** When Joseph's daily task was done he came, and Mary told him all
the words that Gabriel spoke to her, and they rejoiced; for they
believed that he, the man of God, had spoken words of truth.  
**18.** And Mary went with haste to tell Elizabeth about the promises of
Gabriel; together they rejoiced.  
**19.** And in the home of Zacharias and Elizabeth did Mary tarry ninety
days; then she returned to Nazareth.  
**20.** To Zacharias and Elizabeth a son was born, and Zacharias said,  
**21.** Most blessed be the name of God, for he has opened up the fount
of blessings for his people, Israel.  
**22.** His promises are verified; for he has brought to pass the words
which holy prophets spoke in olden times.  
**23.** And Zacharias looked upon infant John, and said,  
**24.** You shall be called the prophet of the Holy One; and you will go
before his face, and will prepare his way.  
**25.** And you will give a knowledge of salvation unto Israel; and you
will preach the gospel of repentance and the blotting out of sins.  
**26.** Behold, for soon the Day Star from on high will visit us, to
light the way for those who sit within the darkness of the shadow-land,
and guide our ways to the feet of peace.
