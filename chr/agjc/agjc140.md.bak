#### Chapter 137

Jesus and his disciples go into a retired place to pray. Jesus teaches
Lazarus how to pray. The model prayer. The value of importunate prayer.
Parable of the importunate housewife.  
  
**1.** Now, in the evening Jesus, Peter, James and John, with Lazarus,
went out beyond the village gates to pray. And Lazarus said, Teach me to
pray.  
**2.** And Jesus said, The prayer I taught the twelve to pray while we
were up in Galilee is one acceptable to God; and when you pray just
say,  
**3.** Our Father-God who art in heaven; holy is thy name; thy kingdom
come; they will be done on earth as it is done in heaven;  
**4.** Give us this day our needed bread;  
**5.** Help us forget the debts that other people owe to us, that all
our debts may be discharged;  
**6.** And shield us from the tempter's snares that are too great for us
to bear;  
**7.** And when they come give us the strength to overcome.  
**8.** And Jesus said, The answer to your prayer may not appear in
fulness in a little time.  
**9.** Be not discouraged; pray again and then again, for God will
hear.  
**10.** And then he spoke a parable; he said, A housewife was alone at
night and, lo, some guests arrived, and they were hungry, having had no
food for all the day.  
**11.** The housewife had no bread, and so at midnight she went forth
and called a friend and said, Loan me three loaves of bread, for guests
have come, and I have naught for them to eat.  
**12.** The friend replied, Why do you trouble me at midnight hour? My
door is shut; my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise to give you
bread; to-morrow you can be supplied.  
**13.** The housewife asked again, and then again, and then because she
pled, and would not be refused, the friend arose and gave her bread.  
**14.** Behold, I say to you, Ask firmly and you shall receive; seek
trustingly and you shall find; knock earnestly, the door will open up.  
**15.** All things are yours, and when you ask, not as a begging man
would ask, but as a child, you shall be satisfied.  
**16.** A son may ask his father for a loaf of bread; the father will
not give to him a stone;  
**17.** Or he may ask him for a fish; he will not give a crab; or he may
ask him for an egg; the father will not give a pebble from the brook.  
**18.** Behold, if men of flesh know how to give abundantly to children
of the flesh, will not your heavenly Father give abundantly to you when
you shall pray?
