#### Chapter 55

Jesus passes the seventh brotherhood test, and in the purple room of the
temple receives the seventh, the highest degree, THE CHRIST. He leaves
the temple a conqueror.  
  
**1.** The work of Jesus in the Chamber of the Dead was done, and in the
temple purple room he stood before the hierophant,  
**2.** And he was clothed in purple robes; and all the brothers stood.
The hierophant arose and said,  
**3.** This is a royal day for all the hosts of Israel. In honour of
their chosen son we celebrate the great Passover Feast.  
**4.** And then he said to Jesus, Brother, man, most excellent of men,
in all the temple tests you have won out.  
**5.** Six times before the bar of right you have been judged; six times
you have received the highest honours man can give; and now you stand
prepared to take the last degree.  
**6.** Upon your brow I place this diadem, and in the Great Lodge of the
heavens and earth you are THE CHRIST.  
**7.** This is your Passover rite. You are a neophyte no more; but now a
master mind.  
**8.** Now, man can do no more; but God himself will speak, and will
confirm your title and degree.  
**9.** Go on your way, for you must preach the gospel of good will to
men and peace on earth; must open up the prison doors and set the
captives free.  
**10.** And while the hierophant yet spoke the temple bells rang out; a
pure white dove descended from above and sat on Jesus' head.  
**11.** And then a voice that shook the very temple said, THIS IS THE
CHRIST; and every living creature said, AMEN.  
**12.** The great doors of the temple swung ajar; the Logos journeyed on
his way a conqueror.
