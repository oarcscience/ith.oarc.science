#### Chapter 11

Elihu's lessons. Buddhism and the precepts of Buddha. The mysteries of
Egypt.  
  
**1.** Again Elihu taught; he said, The Indian priests became corrupt;
Brahm was forgotten in the streets; the rights of men were trampled in
the dust.  
**2.** And the a mighty master came, a Buddha of enlightenment, who
turned away from wealth and all the honours of the world, and found the
Silence in the quiet groves and caves; and he was blest.  
**3.** He preached a gospel of the higher life, and taught man how to
honour man.  
**4.** He had no doctrine of the gods to teach; he just knew man, and so
his creed was justice, love and righteousness.  
**5.** I quote for you a few of many of the helpful words which Buddha
spoke:  
**6.** Hate is a cruel word. If men hate you regard it not; and you can
turn the hate of men to love and mercy and goodwill, and mercy is as
large as all the heavens.  
**7.** And there is good enough for all. With good destroy the bad; with
generous deeds make avarice ashamed; with truth make straight the
crooked lines that error draws, for error is but truth distorted, gone
astray.  
**8.** And pain will follow him who speaks or acts with evil thoughts,
as does the wheel the foot of him who draws the cart.  
**9.** He is a greater man who conquers self than he who kills a
thousand men in war.  
**10.** He is the noble man who is himself what he believes what other
men should be.  
**11.** Return to him who does you wrong your purest love, and he will
cease from doing wrong; for love will purify the heart of him who is
beloved as truly as it purifies the heart of him who loves.  
**12.** The words of Buddha are recorded in the Indian sacred books;
attend to them, for they are part of the instructions of the Holy
Breath.  
**13.** The land of Egypt is the land of secret things.  
**14.** The mysteries of the ages lie lock-bound in our temples and our
shines.  
**15.** The masters of all times and climes come here to learn; and when
your sons have grown to manhood they will finish all their studies in
Egyptian schools.  
**16.** But I have said enough. To-morrow at the rising of the sun we
meet again.
