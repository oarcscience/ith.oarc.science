#### Chapter 76

Jesus in Bethlehem. Explains the Empire of Peace to the shepherds. An
unusual light appears. The shepherds recognise Jesus as the Christ.  
  
**1.** The Logos went to Bethlehem, and many people followed him.  
**2.** He found the shepherd's home where he was cradled when a babe;
here he abode.  
**3.** He went up to the hills where more than thirty years before the
shepherds watched their flocks and heard the messenger of peace
exclaim:  
**4.** At midnight in a cave in Bethlehem the Prince of Peace is born.  
**5.** And shepherds still were there, and sheep still fed upon the
hills.  
**6.** And in the valley near great flocks of snow-white doves were
flying to and fro.  
**7.** And when the shepherds knew that Jesus, whom the people called
the king, had come, they came from near and far to speak to him.  
**8.** And Jesus said to them, Behold the life of innocence and peace!  
**9.** White is the symbol of the virtuous and pure! the lamb of
innocence; the dove of peace;  
**10.** And it was meet that love should come in human form amid such
scenes as these.  
**11.** Our father Abraham walked through these vales, and on these very
hills he watched his flocks and herds.  
**12.** And here it was that one, the Prince of Peace, the king of
Salim, came; the Christ in human form; a greater far than Abraham was
he.  
**13.** And here it was that Abraham gave to this king of Salim, tithes
of all he had.  
**14.** This Prince of Peace went forth in battle everywhere. He had no
sword; no armour of defence; no weapons of offence;  
**15.** And yet he conquered men, and nations trembled at his feet.  
**16.** The hosts of Egypt quailed before this sturdy king of right; the
kings of Egypt placed their crowns upon his head,  
**17.** And gave into his hands the sceptre of all Egypt land, and not a
drop of blood was shed, and not a captive placed in chains;  
**18.** But everywhere the conqueror threw wide the prison doors and set
the captives free.  
**19.** And, once again, the Prince of Peace has come, and from these
blessed hills he goes again to fight.  
**20.** And he is clothed in white; his sword is truth, his shield is
faith; his helmet is innocence; his breath is love; his watchword
peace.  
**21.** But this is not a carnal war; it is not man at war with man; but
it is right against the wrong.  
**22.** And love is captain, love is warrior, love is armour, love is
all, and love shall win.  
**23.** And then again the hills of Bethlehem were clothed with light,
again the messenger exclaimed,  
**24.** Peace, peace on earth, good will to men.  
**25.** And Jesus taught the people; healed the sick; revealed the
mysteries of the kingdom of the Holy One.  
**26.** And many said, He is the Christ; the king who was to come has
come; Praise God.
