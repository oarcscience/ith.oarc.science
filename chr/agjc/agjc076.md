#### Chapter 73

Jesus again visits the temple, and is favourably received by the people.
Tells the parable of a king and his sons. Defines messiahship.  
  
**1.** Next day the multitudes were surging through the temple courts,
intent on hearing Jesus speak.  
**2.** And when he came the people said, All hail! behold the king!  
**3.** And Jesus spoke a parable; he said, A king had vast domains; his
people all were kin, and lived in peace.  
**4.** Now, after many years the king said to his people, Take these
lands and all I have; enhance their values; rule yourselves, and live in
peace.  
**5.** And then the people formed their states; selected governors and
petty kings.  
**6.** But pride, ambition, selfish greed, and base ingratitude grew
fast, and kings began to war.  
**7.** They wrote in all their statute books that might is right; and
then the strong destroyed the weak, and chaos reigned through all the
vast domain.  
**8.** A long time passed, and then the king looked out on his domain.
He saw his people in their cruel wars; he saw them sick and sore
distressed; he saw the strong enslave the weak,  
**9.** And then he said, What shall I do? Shall I send forth a scourge?
shall I destroy my people all?  
**10.** And then his heart was stirred with pity and he said, I will not
send a scourge; I will send forth my only son, heir to the throne, to
teach the people love, and peace, and righteousness.  
**11.** He sent his son; the people scorned him and maltreated him, and
nailed him to a cross.  
**12.** He was entombed; but death was far too weak to hold the prince,
and he arose.  
**13.** He took a form man could not kill; and then he went again to
teach the people love, and peace and righteousness.  
**14.** And thus God deals with men.  
**15.** A lawyer came and asked, What does messiah mean? and who has
right to make messiah of a man?  
**16.** And Jesus said, Messiah is one sent from God to seek and save
the lost. Messiahs are not made by men.  
**17.** In first of every age Messiah comes to light the way; to heal up
broken hearts; to set the prisoners free. Messiah and the Christ are
one.  
**18.** Because a man claims to be Christ is not a sign that he is
Christ.  
**19.** A man may cause the streams to flow from flinty rocks; may bring
storms at will; may stay tempestuous winds; may heal the sick and raise
the dead, and not be sent from God.  
**20.** All nature is subservient to the will of man, and evil man, as
well as good, have all the powers of mind, and may control the
elements.  
**21.** The head gives not the proof of true messiahship, for man by
means of intellect, can never know of God, nor bring himself to walk in
light.  
**22.** Messiah lives not in the head, but in the heart, the seat of
mercy and of love.  
**23.** Messiah never works for selfish gains; he stands above the
carnal self; his words and deeds are for the universal good.  
**24.** Messiah never tries to be a king, to wear a crown and sit upon
an earthly throne.  
**25.** The king is earthy, of the earth; Messiah is the man from
heaven.  
**26.** And then the lawyer asked, Why do you pose as king?  
**27.** And Jesus said, No man has ever heard me say that I am king. I
could not sit in Cæsar's place and be the Christ.  
**28.** Give unto Cæsar what belongs to him; give unto God the treasures
of your heart.
