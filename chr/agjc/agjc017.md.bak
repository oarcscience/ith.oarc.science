#### Chapter 14

Matheno's lessons. The doctrine of universal law. The power of man to
choose and to attain. The benefits of antagonisms. Ancient sacred books.
The place of John and Jesus in the world's history.  
  
**1.** Matheno and his pupil, John, were talking of the sacred books of
olden times, and of the golden precepts they contained, and John
exclaimed,  
**2.** These golden precepts are sublime; what need have we of other
sacred books?  
**3.** Matheno said, The Spirit of the Holy One cause every thing to
come and go in proper time.  
**4.** The sun has his own time to set, the moon to rise, to wax and
wane, the stars to come and go, the rain to fall, the winds to blow;  
**5.** The seed times and the harvest times to come; man to be born and
man to die.  
**6.** These mighty Spirits cause the nations to be born; they rock them
in their cradles, nurtures them to greatest power, and when their tasks
are done they wrap them in their winding sheets and lay them in their
tombs.  
**7.** Events are many in a nation's life, and in the life of man, that
are not pleasant for the time; but in the end the truth appears:
whatever comes is for the best.  
**8.** Man was created for a noble part; but he could not be made a free
man filled with wisdom, truth and might.  
**9.** If he were hedged about, confined in straits from which he could
not pass, then he would be a toy, a mere machine.  
**10.** Creative spirits gave to man a will; and so he has the power to
choose.  
**11.** He may attain the greatest heights, or sink to deepest depths;
for what he wills to gain he has the power to gain.  
**12.** If he desires strength he has the power to gain that strength;
but he must overcome resistances to reach the goal; no strength is ever
gained in idleness.  
**13.** So, in the whirl of many-sided conflicts man is placed where he
must strive to extricate himself.  
**14.** In every conflict man gains strength; with every conquest he
attains to greater heights. With every day he finds new duties and new
cares.  
**15.** Man is not carried over dangerous pits, nor helped to overcome
his foes. He is himself his army, and his sword and shield; and he is
captain of his hosts.  
**16.** The Holy Ones just light his way. Man never has been left
without a beacon light to guide.  
**17.** And he has ever had a lighted lamp in hand that he may see the
dangerous rocks, the turbid streams and treacherous pits.  
**18.** And so the Holy Ones have judged; when men have needed added
light a master soul has come to earth to give the light.  
**19.** Before the Vedic days the world had many sacred books to light
the way; and when man needed greater light the Vedas, the Avesta and the
books of Tao Great appeared to show the way to greater heights.  
**20.** And in the proper place the Hebrew Bible, with its Law, its
Prophets and its Psalms, appeared for man's enlightenment.  
**21.** But years have passed and men have need of greater light.  
**22.** And now the Day Star from on high begins to shine; and Jesus is
the flesh-made messenger to show that light to men.  
**23.** And you, my pupil, you have been ordained to harbinger the
coming day.  
**24.** But you must keep that purity of heart you now possess; and you
must light your lamp directly from the coals that burn upon the altar of
the Holy Ones.  
**25.** And then your lamp will be transmuted to a boundless flame, and
you will be a living torch whose light will shine wherever man abides.  
**26.** But in the ages yet to come, man will attain to greater heights,
and lights still more intense will come.  
**27.** And then, at last, a mighty master soul will come to earth to
light the way up to the throne of perfect man.
