#### Chapter 179

Jesus appears, fully materialised, to the apostles at the sea of
Galilee. Appears to a multitude of people. Tells his apostles to go
again to Jerusalem and he would meet them there.  
  
**1.** Now, the apostles were at home in Galilee; the women tarried in
Judea until the Pentecost.  
**2.** And Peter, James and John, and Andrew, Philip and Nathaniel were
in Capernaum. They joined with Jonah and with Zebedee, and in their
boats went out to fish,  
**3.** They toiled all night and when the morning came they had no
fish.  
**4.** And as they neared the shore a man stood on the shore and said,
How many fish have you?  
**5.** And Peter answered, None.  
**6.** Again the man called out and said, A school of fish is passing
now upon the right side of your boat; cast out your net.  
**7.** They cast their net, and it was filled; and John exclaimed, It is
the Lord who stands upon the shore.  
**8.** And Peter plunged into the sea and swam to shore. The other men
brought in the net, and it contained a hundred fifty and three fish and
yet it did not break.  
**9.** And Jesus said, My children, let us break our fast together
here.  
**10.** They found some living coals upon the beach and Peter brought
and dressed the fish; they had some bread.  
**11.** And when the meal had been prepared they broke their fast, and
Jesus ate of both the fish and bread.  
**12.** Now, after breakfast all the men were sitting on the beach, and
Jesus said to Peter, Do you love the Lord your God with all your heart,
and do you love your neighbour as you love yourself?  
**13.** And Peter said, Yea, Lord, I love the Lord my God with all my
heart; I love my neighbour as I love myself.  
**14.** And Jesus said, Then feed my sheep.  
**15.** And then he said to James, Do you love her, the Holy Breath,
with all your heart, and do you love your neighbour as you love
yourself?  
**16.** And James replied, Yea, Lord, I love the Holy Breath with all my
heart; I love my neighbour as I love myself.  
**17.** Then Jesus said, Protect my sheep.  
**18.** And then he said to John, Do you love Christ, the love divine
made manifest, with all your heart, and do you love your neighbour as
you love yourself?  
**19.** And John replied, Yea, Lord, I love the Christ with all my
heart; I love my neighbour as I love myself.  
**20.** And Jesus said, Then feed my lambs.  
**21.** Then Jesus rose and said to Peter, Follow me. And Peter followed
him.  
**22.** When Peter saw that John was following him he said to Jesus,
LOrd, behold, John follows you! What shall he do?  
**23.** Now Peter did not hear the master when he said to John, Then
feed my lambs.  
**24.** And Jesus spoke to Peter and he said, It matters not to you what
John shall do; not even though I will that he remain until I come
again.  
**25.** Just do your duty; follow me.  
**26.** And Jesus passed, they knew not where he went.  
**27.** The news soon spread through all Capernaum that Jesus had risen
from the dead, that he had walked with his disciples by the sea and ate
with them the morning meal. The multitudes came forth to see.  
**28.** Now Peter, James and John, together with the other men who had
been called to be apostles of the Lord, went to the mountains near
Capernaum to pray.  
**29.** And as they prayed the master came; they saw him and they talked
with him.  
**30.** He said to them, The Pentecost is near at hand; go to Jerusalem
and I will meet you there.  
**31.** And as he talked, a multitude of people came; they saw the Lord;
they said,  
**32.** Behold, for now we know that he, the Nazarene, has risen from
the dead for we have seen him face to face.
