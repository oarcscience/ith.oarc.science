#### Chapter 70

Jesus and his disciples at a marriage feast in Cana. Jesus speaks on
marriage. He turns water into wine. The people are amazed.  
  
**1.** In Cana, Galilee, there was a marriage feast, and Mary and her
sister Miriam, and Jesus and his six disciples were among the guests.  
**2.** The ruler of the feast had heard that Jesus was a master sent
from God, and he requested him to speak.  
**3.** And Jesus said, There is no tie more sacred than the marriage
tie.  
**4.** The chain that binds two souls in love is made in heaven, and man
can never sever it in twain.  
**5.** The lower passions of the twain may cause a union of the twain, a
union as when oil and water meet.  
**6.** And then a priest may forge a chain, and bind the twain. This is
not marriage genuine; it is a counterfeit.  
**7.** The twain are guilty of adultery; the priest is party to the
crime. And that was all that Jesus said.  
**8.** As Jesus stood apart in silent thought his mother came and said
to him, The wine has failed; what shall we do?  
**9.** And Jesus said, Pray what is wine? It is but water with the
flavouring of grapes.  
**10.** And what are grapes? They are but certain kinds of thought made
manifest, and I can manifest that thought, and water will be wine.  
**11.** He called the servants, and he said to them, Bring in six water
pots of stone, a pot for each of these, my followers, and fill them up
with water to the brims.  
**12.** The servants brought the water pots, and filled them to their
brims.  
**13.** And Jesus with a mighty thought stirred up the ethers till they
reached the manifest, and, lo, the water blushed, and turned to wine.  
**14.** The servants took the wine and gave it to the ruler of the feast
who called the bridegroom in and said to him,  
**15.** This wine is best of all; most people when they give a feast
bring in the best wine at first; but, lo, you have reserved the best
until last.  
**16.** And when the ruler and the guests were told that Jesus, by the
power of thought, had turned the water into wine, they were amazed;  
**17.** They said, This man is more than man; he surely is the christed
one who prophets of the olden times declared would come.  
**18.** And many of the guests believed on him, and gladly would have
followed him.
