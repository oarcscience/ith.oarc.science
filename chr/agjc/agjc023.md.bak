#### Chapter 20

After the feast. The homeward journey. The missing Jesus. The search for
him. His parents find him in the temple. He goes with them to Nazareth.
Symbolic meaning of carpenter's tools.  
  
**1.** The great feast of the pasch was ended and the Nazarenes were
journeying towards their homes.  
**2.** And they were in Samaria, and Mary said, Where is my son? No one
had seen the boy.  
**3.** And Joseph sought among their kindred who were on their way to
Galilee; but they had seen him not.  
**4.** Then Joseph, Mary, and a son of Zebedee, returned and sought
through all Jerusalem, but they could find him not.  
**5.** And then they went up to the temple courts and asked the guards,
Have you seen Jesus, a fair-haired boy, with deep blue eyes, twelve
years of age, about these courts?  
**6.** The guards replied, Yes, he is in the temple now disputing with
the doctors of the law.  
**7.** And they went in, and found him as the guards had said.  
**8.** And Mary said, Why Jesus, why do you treat your parents thus? Lo,
we have sought two days for you. We feared that some great harm had
overtaken you.  
**9.** And Jesus said, Do you not know that I must be about my Father's
work?  
**10.** But he went round and pressed the hand of every doctor of the
law and said, I trust that we may meet again.  
**11.** And then he went forth with his parents on their way to
Nazareth; and when they reached their home he wrought with Joseph as a
carpenter.  
**12.** One day as he was bringing forth the tools for work he said,  
**13.** These tools remind me of the ones we handle in the workshop of
the mind where things were made of thought and where we build up
character.  
**14.** We use the square to measure all our lines, to straighten out
the crooked places of the way, and make the corners of our conduct
square.  
**15.** We use the compass to draw circles round our passions and
desires to keep them in the bounds of righteousness.  
**16.** We use the axe to cut away the knotty, useless and ungainly
parts and make the character symmetrical.  
**17.** We use the hammer to drive home the truth, and pound it in until
it is a part of every part.  
**18.** We use the plane to smooth the rough, uneven surfaces of joint,
and block, and board that go to build the temple for the truth.  
**19.** The chisel, line, the plummet and the saw all have their uses in
the workshop of the mind.  
**20.** And then this ladder with its trinity of steps, faith, hope and
love; on it we climb up to the dome of purity in life.  
**21.** And on the twelve-step ladder we ascend until we reach the
pinnacle of that which life is spent to build--the Temple of Perfected
Man.
