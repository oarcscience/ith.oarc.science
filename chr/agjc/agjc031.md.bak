#### Chapter 28

Udraka gives a feast in Jesus' honour. Jesus speaks on the unity of God
and the brotherhood of life. Criticises the priesthood. Becomes the
guest of a farmer.  
  
**1.** Benares is the sacred city of the Brahms, and in Benares Jesus
taught; Udraka was his host.  
**2.** Udraka made a feast in honour of his guest, and many high born
Hindu priests and scribes were there.  
**3.** And Jesus said to them, With much delight I speak to you
concerning life--the brotherhood of life.  
**4.** The universal God is one, yet he is more than one; all things are
God; all things are one.  
**5.** By the sweet breaths of God all life is bound in one; so if you
touch a fibre of a living thing you send a thrill from the centre to the
outer bounds of life.  
**6.** And when you crush beneath your foot the meanest worm, you shake
the throne of God, and cause the sword of right to tremble in its
sheath.  
**7.** The bird sings out its song for men, and men vibrate in unison to
help it sing.  
**8.** The ant constructs her home, the bee its sheltering comb, the
spider weaves her web, and flowers breath to them a spirit in their
sweet perfumes that gives them strength to toil.  
**9.** Now, men and birds and beasts and creeping things are deities,
made flesh; and how dare men kill anything?  
**10.** 'Tis cruelty that makes the world awry. When men have learned
that when they harm a living thing they harm themselves, they surely
will not kill, nor cause a thing that God has made to suffer pain.  
**11.** A lawyer said, I pray you, Jesus, tell who is this God you speak
about; where are his priests, his temples and his shrines?  
**12.** And Jesus said, The God I speak about is everywhere; he cannot
be compassed with walls, nor hedged about with bounds of any kind.  
**13.** All people worship God, the One; but all the people see him not
alike.  
**14.** This universal God is wisdom, will and love.  
**15.** All men see not the Triune God. One sees him as the God of
might; another as the God of thought; another as the God of love.  
**16.** A man's ideal is his God, and so, as man unfolds. Man's God
to-day, to-morrow is not God.  
**17.** The nations of the earth see God from different points of view,
and so he does not seem the same to every one.  
**18.** Man names the part of God he sees, and this to him is all of
God; and every nation sees a part of God, and every nation has a name
for God.  
**19.** You Brahmans call him Parabrahm; in Egypt he is Thoth; and Zeus
is his name in Greece; Jehovah is his Hebrew name; but everywhere he is
the causeless Cause, the rootless Root from which all things have
grown.  
**20.** When men become afraid of God, and take him for a foe, they
dress up other men in fancy garbs and call them priests.  
**21.** And charge them to restrain the wrath of God by prayers; and
when they fail to win his favour by their prayers, to buy him off with
sacrifice of animal, or bird.  
**22.** When man sees God as one with him, as Father-God, he needs no
middle man, no priest to intercede;  
**23.** He goes straight up to him and says, My Father-God! and then he
lays his hand in God's own hand, and all is well.  
**24.** And this is God. You are, each one, a priest, just for yourself;
and sacrifice of blood God does not want.  
**25.** Just give your life in sacrificial service to all of life, and
God is pleased.  
**26.** When Jesus had thus said he stood aside; the people were amazed,
but strove among themselves.  
**27.** Some said, He is inspired by Holy Brahm; and others said, He is
insane; and others said, He is obsessed; he speaks as devils speak.  
**28.** But Jesus tarried not. Among the guests was one, a tiller of the
soil, a generous soul, a seeker after truth, who loved the words that
Jesus spoke, and Jesus went with him, and in his home abode.
