#### Chapter 178

Jesus appears, fully materialised, before Apollo and the Silent
Brotherhood in Greece. Appears to Claudia and Juliet on the Tiber near
Rome. Appears to the priest in the Egyptian temple at Heliopolis.  
  
**1.** Apollo, with the Silent Brotherhood of Greece, was sitting in a
Delphian grove. The Oracle had spoken loud and long.  
**2.** The priests were in the sanctuary and as they looked the Oracle
became a blaze of light; it seemed to be on fire, and all consumed.  
**3.** The priests were filled with fear. They said, A great disaster is
to come; our gods are mad; they have destroyed our Oracle.  
**4.** But when the flames had spent themselves, a man stood on the orac
pedestal and said,  
**5.** God speaks to man, not by an oracle of wood and gold, but by the
voice of man.  
**6.** The gods have spoken to the Greeks, and kindred tongues, through
images made by man, but God, the One, now speaks to man through Christ
the only son, who was, and is and evermore will be.  
**7.** This Oracle shall fail; the Living Oracle of God, the One, will
never fail.  
**8.** Apollo knew the man who spoke; he knew it was the Nazarene who
once had taught the wise men in the Acropolis and had rebuked the idol
worshippers upon the Athen's beach;  
**9.** And in a moment Jesus stood before Apollo and the Silent
Brotherhood, and said,  
**10.** Behold, for I have risen from the dead with gifts for men. I
bring to you the title of your vast estate.  
**11.** All power in heaven and earth is mine; to you I give all power
in heaven and earth.  
**12.** Go forth and teach the nations of the earth the gospel of the
resurrection of the dead and of eternal life through Christ, the love of
God made manifest to men.  
**13.** And then he clasped Apollo's hand and said, My human flesh was
changed to higher form by love divine and I can manifest in flesh, or in
the higher planes of life, at will.  
**14.** What I can do all men can do. Go preach the gospel of the
omnipotence of man.  
**15.** Then Jesus disappeared; but Greece and Crete and all the nations
heard.  
**16.** Claudas and Juliet, his wife, lived on the Palatine in Rome and
they were servants of Tiberius; but they had been in Galilee;  
**17.** Had walked with Jesus by the sea, had heard his words and seen
his power; and they believed that he was Christ made manifest.  
**18.** Now Claudas and his wife were on the Tiber in a little boat; a
storm swept from the sea, the boat was wrecked and Claudas and his wife
were sinking down to death.  
**19.** And Jesus came and took them by the hands and said, Claudas and
Juiet, arise and walk with me upon the waves.  
**20.** And they arose and walked with him upon the waves.  
**21.** A thousand people saw the three walk on the waves, and saw them
reach the land, and they were all amazed.  
**22.** And Jesus said, You men of Rome, I am the resurrection and the
life. They that are dead shall live, and many that shall live will never
die.  
**23.** By mouth of gods and demi-gods God spoke unto your fathers long
ago; but now he speaks to you through perfect man.  
**24.** He sent his son, the Christ, in human flesh, to save the world,
and as I lifted from the watery grave and saved these servants of
Tiberius,  
**25.** So Christ will lift the sons and daughters of the human race,
yea, every one of them, from darkness and from graves of carnal things,
to light and everlasting life.  
**26.** I am the manifest of love raised from the dead; Behold my hands,
my feet, my side which carnal men have pierced.  
**27.** Claudas and Juliet whom I have saved from death, are my
ambassadors to Rome.  
**28.** And they will point the way and preach the gospel of the Holy
Breath and of the resurrection of the dead.  
**29.** And that was all he said, but Rome and all of Italy heard.  
**30.** The priests of Heliopolis were in their temple met to celebrate
the resurrection of their brother Nazarite; they knew that he had risen
from the dead.  
**31.** The Nazarite appeared and stood upon a sacred pedestal on which
no man had ever stood.  
**32.** This was an honour that had been reserved for him who first
would demonstrate the resurrection of the dead.  
**33.** And Jesus was the first of all the human race to demonstrate the
resurrection of the dead.  
**34.** When Jesus stood upon the sacred pedestal the masters stood and
said, All hail! The great bells of the temple rang and all the temple
was ablaze with light.  
**35.** And Jesus said, All honour to the masters of this Temple of the
Sun.  
**36.** In flesh of man there is the essence of the resurrection of the
dead. This essence, quickened by the Holy Breath, will raise the
substance of the body to a higher tone,  
**37.** And make it like the substance of the bodies of the planes
above, which human eyes cannot behold.  
**38.** There is a holy ministry in death. The essence of the body
cannot be quickened by the Holy Breath until the fixed is solved; the
body must disintegrate, and this is death.  
**39.** And then upon these pliant substances God breathes, just as he
breathed upon the chaos of the deep when worlds were formed,  
**40.** And life springs forth from death; the carnal form is changed to
form divine.  
**41.** The will of man makes possible the action of the Holy Breath.
When will of man and will of God are one, the resurrection is a fact.  
**42.** In this we have the chemistry of mortal life, the ministry of
death, the mystery of deific life.  
**43.** My human life was wholly given to bring my will to tune with the
deific will; when this was done my earth-tasks all were done.  
**44.** And you, my brother, know full well the foes I had to meet; you
know about my victories in Gethsemane; my trials in the courts of men;
my death upon the cross.  
**45.** You know that all my life was one great drama for the sons of
men; a pattern for the sons of men. I lived to show the possibilities of
man.  
**46.** What I have done all men can do, and what I am all men shall
be.  
**47.** The masters looked; the form upon the sacred pedestal had gone,
but every temple priest, and every living creature said, Praise God.
