#### Chapter 152

Jesus rebukes a barren fig tree. Drives the merchants out of the temple.
Teaches the people. Returns to Bethany.  
  
**1.** Next day, the Monday of the week, the master with the twelve,
went to Jerusalem.  
**2.** And as they passed along the way they saw a fig tree full of
leaves without a sign of fruit.  
**3.** And Jesus spoke unto the tree; he said, You useless cumberer of
the ground; you fig tree fair to look upon, but a delusive thing.  
**4.** You take from the earth and air the food that fruitful trees
should have.  
**5.** Go back to earth and be yourself the food for other trees to
eat.  
**6.** When Jesus had thus spoken to the tree he went his way.  
**7.** And when he reached the temple, lo, the rooms were filled with
petty merchants selling doves and animals, and other things, for
sacrifice; the temple was a mart of trade.  
**8.** And Jesus was indignant at the sight, and said, You men of
Israel, for shame! This is supposed to be the house of prayer; but it is
now a den of thieves. Remove this plunder from this holy place.  
**9.** The merchants only laughed and said, We are protected in our
trade by those who bear the rule; we will not go.  
**10.** Then Jesus made a scourge of cords, as he did once before, and
rushed among the merchantmen, threw all their money on the floor;  
**11.** Threw wide the cages of the doves, and cut the cords that held
the bleating lambs and set them free.  
**12.** And then he drove the merchants from the place, and with a
clean, new broom he swept the floors.  
**13.** Chief priests and scribes were filled with wrath, but feared to
touch or even to rebuke the Lord, for all the people stood in his
defence.  
**14.** And Jesus taught the people all day long and healed a multitude
of those diseased,  
**15.** And when the evening came he went again to Bethany.
