#### Chapter 12

Salome's lessons. Prayer. Elihu's concluding lessons. Sums up the three
years' course of study. The pupils return to their homes.  
  
**1.** Now, when the morning sun arose the masters and their pupils all
were in the sacred grove.  
**2.** Salome was the first to speak; she said, Behold the sun! It
manifests the power of God who speaks to us through sun and moon and
stars;  
**3.** Through mountain, hill and vale; through flower, and plant and
tree.  
**4.** God sings for us through bird, and harpsichord, and human voice;
he speaks to us through wind and rain and thunder roll; why should we
not bow down and worship at his feet?  
**5.** God speaks to hearts apart; and hearts apart must speak to him;
and this is prayer.  
**6.** It is not prayer to shout at God, to stand, or sit, or kneel and
tell him all about the sins of men.  
**7.** It is not prayer to tell the Holy One how great he is, how good
he is, how strong and how compassionate.  
**8.** God is not man to be bought up by praise of man.  
**9.** Prayer is the ardent wish that every way of life be light; that
every act be crowned with good; that every living thing be prospered by
our ministry.  
**10.** A noble deed, a helpful word is prayer; a fervent, an effectual
prayer.  
**11.** The fount of prayer is in the heart; by thought, not words, the
heart is carried up to God, where it is blest, Then let us pray.  
**12.** They prayed, but not a word was said; but in that holy Silence
every heart was blest.  
**13.** And then Elihu spoke. He said to Mary and Elizabeth, Our words
are said; you need not tarry longer here; the call has come; the way is
clear, you may return unto your native land.  
**14.** A mighty work is given you to do; you shall direct the minds
that will direct the world.  
**15.** Your sons are set apart to lead men up to righteous thoughts,
and words, and deeds;  
**16.** To make men know the sinfulness of sin; to lead them from the
adoration of the lower self, and all illusive things, and make them
conscious of the self that lives with Christ in God.  
**17.** In preparation for their work your sons must walk in many thorny
paths.  
**18.** Fierce trials and temptations they will meet, like other men;
their loads will not be light, and they will weary be, and faint.  
**19.** And they will know the pangs of hunger and of thirst; and
without cause they will be mocked, imprisoned, scourged.  
**20.** To many countries they will go, and at the feet of many masters
they will sit, for they must learn like other men.  
**21.** But we have said enough. The blessings of the Three and of the
Seven, who stand before the throne, will surely rest upon you
evermore.  
**22.** Thus closed the lessons of Elihu and Salome. Three years they
taught their pupils in the sacred grove, and if their lessons all were
written in a book, lo, it would be a mighty book; of what they said we
have the sum.  
**23.** Now, Mary, Joseph and Elizabeth with Jesus and his harbinger,
set forth upon their homeward way. They went not by Jerusalem, for
Archelaus reigned.  
**24.** They journeyed by the Bitter Sea, and when they reached Engedi
hills they rested in the home of Joshua, a near of kin; and here
Elizabeth and John abode.  
**25.** But Joseph, Mary and their son went by the Jordan way, and after
certain days they reached their home in Nazareth.
