#### Chapter 147

Jesus speaks to the people in the temple regarding the messiahship.
Rebukes the Jews for treachery. The Jews attempt to stone him, but are
prevented by Joseph. The Christines go to Jericho, and later to
Bethabara.  
  
**1.** Now, many Jews from Galilee, Judea and Samaria were in Jerusalem
and at the feast.  
**2.** The porch of Solomon was filled with scribes and Pharisees and
doctors of the law, and Jesus walked with them.  
**3.** A scribe approaching Jesus said, Rabboni, why do you keep the
people waiting in suspense? If you are the Messiah that the prophets
said would come, will you not tell us now?  
**4.** And Jesus said, Lo, I have told you many times, but you believed
me not.  
**5.** No man can do the work that I have done and bring to men the
truth as I have brought the truth who did not come from God.  
**6.** What I have done and said are witnesses for me.  
**7.** God calls, and they whose ears have attuned to hear the heavenly
voice have heard the call and have believed in me; because God testifies
for me.  
**8.** You cannot hear the voice of God, because your ears are closed.
You cannot comprehend the works of God, because your hearts are full of
self.  
**9.** And you are busybodies, mischief-makers, hypocrites. You take
these men whom God has given me into your haunts and try to poison them
with sophistries and lies, and think that you will snatch them from the
fold of God.  
**10.** I tell you, men, these men are tried and you can snatch not one
of them away.  
**11.** My Father who has given them to me is greater than you all, and
he and I are one.  
**12.** And then the Jews took stones to throw at him and cried, Now we
have heard enough; away with him; let him be stoned.  
**13.** But Joseph, member of the great Sanhedrim of the Jews, was in
the porch and he came forth and said,  
**14.** You men of Israel, do nothing rash; throw down those stones;
your reason is a better guide than passion in such times as these.  
**15.** You do not know your accusations to be true, and if this man
should prove himself to be the Christ, and you should take his life, the
wrath of God would rest upon you evermore.  
**16.** And Jesus said to them, Lo, I have healed your sick, have caused
your blind to see, your deaf to hear, your lame to walk, and cast out
unclean spirits from your friends;  
**17.** For which of these great works would you desire to take my
life?  
**18.** The Jews replied, We would not stone you for your works of
grace, but for your vile, blasphemous words. You are but man and still
you say that you are God.  
**19.** And Jesus said, A prophet of your own said to the sons of men,
Lo, you are gods!  
**20.** Now, hark, you men, if he could say that to the men who simply
heard the word of God, why should you think that I blaspheme the name of
God because I say, I am a son of God?  
**21.** If you believe not what I say you must have faith in what I do,
and you should see the Father in these works, and know that I dwell in
the Father-God, and that the Father dwells in me.  
**22.** and then again the Jews took stones and would have stoned him in
the temple court; but he withdrew himself from sight and left the porch
and court and went his way:  
**23.** And with the twelve he went to Jericho, and after certain days
they crossed the Jordan and in Bethabara abode for many days.
