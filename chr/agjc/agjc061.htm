<p></p> <h4>Chapter 58</h4> <i>
<p>Meeting of the sages, continued. Presentation of the seven universal postulates.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>Now, when the sages were refreshed they opened up the Book of Life and read.<br> <b>2. </b>They read the story of the life of man; of all his struggles, losses, gains; and in the light of past events and needs, they saw what would be best for him in coming years.<br> <b>3. </b>They knew the kind of laws and precepts suited best to his estate; they saw the highest God-ideal that the race could comprehend.<br> <b>4. </b>Upon the seven postulates these sages were to formulate, the great philosophy of life and worship of the coming age must rest.<br> <b>5. </b>Now Meng-ste was the oldest sage; he took the chair of chief, and said,<br> <b>6. </b>Man is not far enough advanced to live by faith; he cannot comprehend the things his eyes see not.<br> <b>7. </b>He yet is child, and during all the coming age he must be taught by pictures, symbols, rites and forms.<br> <b>8. </b>His God must be a human God; he cannot see a God by faith.<br> <b>9. </b>And then he cannot rule himself; the king must rule; the man must serve.<br> <b>10. </b>The age that follows this will be the age of man, the age of faith.<br> <b>11. </b>In that blest age the human race will see without the aid of carnal eyes; will hear the soundless sound; will know the Spirit-God.<br> <b>12. </b>The age we enter is the Preparation age, and all the schools and governments and worship rites must be designed in simple way that men may comprehend.<br> <b>13. </b>And man cannot originate; he builds by patterns that he sees; so in this council we must carve out pattern for the coming age.<br> <b>14. </b>And we must formulate the gnosis of the Empire of the soul, which rests on seven postulates.<br> <b>15. </b>Each sage in turn shall form a postulate; and these shall be the basis of the creeds of men until the perfect age shall come.<br> <b>16. </b>Then Meng-ste wrote the first:<br> <b>17. </b>All things are thought; all life is thought activity. The multitude of beings are but phases of the one great thought made manifest. Lo, God is Thought, and Thought is God.<br> <b>18. </b>Then Vidyapati wrote the second postulate:<br> <b>19. </b>Eternal Thought is one; in essence it is two--Intelligence and Force; and when they breathe a child is born; this child is Love.<br> <b>20. </b>And thus the Triune God stands forth, whom men call Father-Mother-Child.<br> <b>21. </b>This Triune God is one; but like the one of light, in essence he is seven.<br> <b>22. </b>And when the Triune God breathes forth, lo, seven Spirits stand before his face; these are creative attributes.<br> <b>23. </b>Men call them lesser gods, and in their image they made man.<br> <b>24. </b>And Kaspar wrote the third:<br> <b>25. </b>Man was a thought of God, formed in the image of the Septonate, clothed in the substances of soul.<br> <b>26. </b>And his desires were strong; he sought to manifest on every plane of life, and for himself he made a body of the ethers of the earthly forms, and so descended to the plane of earth.<br> <b>27. </b>In this descent he lost his birthright; lost his harmony with God, and made discordant all the notes of life.<br> <b>28. </b>Inharmony and evil are the same; so evil is the handiwork of man.<br> <b>29. </b>Ashbina wrote the fourth:<br> <b>30. </b>Seeds do not germinate in light; they do not grow until they find the soil, and hide themselves away from light.<br> <b>31. </b>Man was evolved a seed of everlasting life; but in the ethers of the Triune God the light was far too great for seeds to grow;<br> <b>32. </b>And so man sought the soil of carnal life, and in the darksomeness of earth he found a place where he could germinate and grow.<br> <b>33. </b>The seed has taken root and grown full well.<br> <b>34.</b> The tree of human life is rising from the soil of earthy things, and, under natural law, is reaching up to perfect form.<br> <b>35. </b>There are no supernatural acts of God to lift a man from carnal life to spirit blessedness; he grows as grows the plant, and in due time is perfected.<br> <b>36. </b>The quality of soul that makes it possible for man to rise to spirit life is purity.</p>
