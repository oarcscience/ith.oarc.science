<p></p> <h4>Chapter 8</h4> <i>
<p>Elihu's lessons. The unity of life. The two selfs. The devil. Love the saviour of men. The David of the light. Goliath of the dark.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>Again Elihu met his pupils in the sacred grove and said,<br> <b>2. </b>No man lives unto himself; for every living thing is bound by cords to every other living thing.<br> <b>3. </b>Blest are the pure in heart; for they will love and not demand love in return.<br> <b>4. </b>They will not do to other men what they would not have other men do unto them.<br> <b>5. </b>There are two selfs; the higher and the lower self.<br> <b>6. </b>The higher self is human spirit clothed with soul, made in the form of God.<br> <b>7. </b>The lower self, the carnal self, the body of desires, is a reflection of the higher self, distorted by the murky ethers of the flesh.<br> <b>8. </b>The lower self is an illusion, and will pass away; the higher self is God in man, and will not pass away.<br> <b>9. </b>The higher self is the embodiment of truth reversed, and so is falsehood manifest.<br> <b>10. </b>The higher self is justice, mercy, love and right; the lower self is what the higher self is not.<br> <b>11. </b>The lower self breeds hatred, slander, lewdness, murders, theft, and everything that harms; the higher self is mother of the virtues and the harmonies of life.<br> <b>12. </b>The lower self is rich in promises, but poor in blessedness and peace; it offers pleasure, joy and satisfying gains; but gives unrest and misery and death.<br> <b>13. </b>It gives men apples that are lovely to the eye and pleasant to the smell; their cores are full of bitterness and gall.<br> <b>14. </b>If you would ask me what to study I would say, yourselves; and when you will have studied them, and then would ask me what to study next, I would reply, yourselves.<br> <b>15. </b>He who knows well his lower self, knows the illusions of the world, knows of the things that pass away; and he who knows his higher self, know God; knows well the things that cannot pass away.<br> <b>16. </b>Thrice blessed is the man who has made purity and love his very own; he has been ransomed from the perils of the lower self and is himself his higher self.<br> <b>17. </b>Men seek salvation from an evil that they deem a living monster of the nether world; and they have gods that are but demons in disguise; all powerful, yet full of jealousy and hate and lust;<br> <b>18. </b>Whose favours must be bought with costly sacrifice of fruits, and of the lives of birds, and animals, and human kind.<br> <b>19. </b>And yet these gods possess no ears to hear, no eyes to see, no heart to sympathise, no power to save.<br> <b>20. </b>This evil is myth; these gods are made of air, clothed with shadows of a thought.<br> <b>21. </b>The only devil from which men must be redeemed is self, the lower self. If man would find his devil he must look within; his name is self.<br> <b>22. </b>If man would find his saviour he must look within; and when the demon self has been dethroned the saviour, Love, will be exulted to the throne of power.<br> <b>23. </b>The David of the light is Purity, who slays the strong Goliath of the dark, and seats the saviour, Love, upon the throne.</p>
