#### SECTION VI  VAU  Life and Works of Jesus in India

#### Chapter 21

Ravanna sees Jesus in the temple and is captivated. Hillel tells him
about the boy. Ravanna finds Jesus in Nazareth and gives a feast in his
honour. Ravanna becomes patron of Jesus, and takes him to India to study
the Brahmic religion.  
  
**1.** A royal prince of India, Ravanna of Orissa in the south, was at
the Jewish feast.  
**2.** Ravanna was a man of wealth; and he was just, and with a band of
Brahmic priests sought wisdom in the West.  
**3.** When Jesus stood among the Jewish priests and read and spoke,
Ravanna heard and was amazed.  
**4.** And when he asked who Jesus was, from whence he came and what he
was, chief Hillel said,  
**5.** We call this child the Day Star from on high, for he has come to
bring to men a light, the light of life; to lighten up the way of men
and to redeem his people, Israel.  
**6.** And Hillel told Ravanna all about the child; about the prophecies
concerning him; about the wonders of the night when he was born; about
the visit of the magian priests;  
**7.** About the way in which he was protected from the wrath of evil
men; about his flight to Egypt-land, and how he then was serving with
his father as a carpenter in Nazareth.  
**8.** Ravanna was entranced, and asked to know the way to Nazareth,
that he might go and honour such a one as son of God.  
**9.** And with his gorgeous train he journeyed on the way and came to
Nazareth of Galilee.  
**10.** He found the object of his search engaged in building dwellings
for the sons of men.  
**11.** And when he first saw Jesus he was climbing up a twelve step
ladder, and he carried in his hands a compass, square and axe.  
**12.** Ravanna said, All hail, most favoured son of heaven!  
**13.** And at the inn Ravanna made a feast for all the people of the
town; and Jesus and his parents were honoured guests.  
**14.** For certain days Ravanna was a guest in Joseph's home on Marmion
Way; he sought to learn the secret of the wisdom of the son; but it was
all to great for him.  
**15.** And then he asked that he might be the patron of the child;
might take him to the East where he could learn the wisdom of the
Brahms.  
**16.** And Jesus longed to go that he might learn; and after many days
his parents gave consent.  
**17.** Then, with proud heart, Ravanna with his train, began the
journey towards the rising sun; and after many days they crossed the
Sind, and reached the province of Orissa, and the palace of the
prince.  
**18.** The Brahmic priests were glad to welcome home the prince; with
favour they received the Jewish boy.  
**19.** And Jesus was accepted as a pupil in the temple Jagannath; and
here learned the Vedas and the Manic laws.  
**20.** The Brahmic masters wondered at the clear conceptions of the
child, and often were amazed when he explained to them the meaning of
the laws.
