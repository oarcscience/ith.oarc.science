#### Chapter 86

The Christines are in Nazareth. Jesus speaks in the synagogue. He
offends the people and they attempt to kill him. He mysteriously
disappears, and returns to the synagogue.  
  
**1.** The Christines were in Nazareth. It was the Sabbath day, and
Jesus went up to the synagogue.  
**2.** The keeper of the books gave one to Jesus and he opened it and
read:  
**3.** The Spirit of the Lord has overshadowed me; he has anointed me to
preach the gospel to the poor; to set the captives free; to open
sightless eyes;  
**4.** To bring relief to those oppressed and bruised, and to proclaim,
The year of jubilee has come.  
**5.** When he had read these words he closed the book and said, This
scripture is fulfilled before your eyes this day. The year of jubilee
has come; the time when Israel shall bless the world.  
**6.** And then he told them many thing about the kingdom of the Holy
One; about the hidden way of life; about forgiveness of sins.  
**7.** Now, many people knew not who the speaker was: And others said,
Is not this Joseph's son? Does not his mother live on Marmion way?  
**8.** And one spoke out and said, This is the man who did such mighty
works in Cana, in Capernaum, and in Jerusalem.  
**9.** And then the people said, Physician heal yourself. Do here among
your kindred all the mighty works that you have done in other towns.  
**10.** And Jesus said, No prophet is received with honour by the people
of his native land; and prophets are not sent to every one.  
**11.** Elijah was a man of God; he had the power and he closed the
gates of heaven, and it did not rain for forty months; and when he spoke
the Word, the rain come on, the earth brought forth again.  
**12.** And there were many widows in the land; but this Elijah went to
none but Zarephath, and she was blessed.  
**13.** And when Elisha lived, lo, many lepers were in Israel, but none
were cleansed save one--the Syrian who had faith.  
**14.** You have no faith; you seek for signs to satisfy your curious
whims; but you shall see not till you open up your eyes of faith.  
**15.** And then the people were enraged; they rushed upon him, bound
him down with cords, and took him to a precipice not far away, intent to
cast him down to death;  
**16.** But when they thought they held him fast, he disappeared; unseen
he passed among the angry men, and went his way.  
**17.** The people were confounded and they said, What manner of a man
is this?  
**18.** And when they came again to Nazareth, they found him teaching in
the synagogue.  
**19.** They troubled him no more for they were sore afraid.
