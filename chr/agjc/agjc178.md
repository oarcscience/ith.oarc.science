#### Chapter 175

Jesus appears, fully materialised to the ten apostles in Simon's house,
and to Lazarus and his sisters.  
  
**1.** The evening of the resurrection day had come; the ten apostles
were in Simon's house in Bethany. The lawyer, Thomas, was not there.  
**2.** The doors were closed and barred, because the Jews had said that
they would drive the Galileans from the land.  
**3.** And as they talked, lo, Jesus came and stood in their midst, and
said, Peace! peace!  
**4.** And the disciples shrank in fear; they thought it was a phantom
that they saw.  
**5.** And Jesus said, Why are you troubled thus? Why do you fear? I am
no phantom form. I am your Lord, and I have risen from the dead.  
**6.** I often said, I will arise; but you believed me not; and now come
here and see. A phantom has not flesh and bones and brawn, like I
possess.  
**7.** Come now, and clasp my hands, and touch my feet, and lay your
hands upon my head.  
**8.** And every one came up and clasped his hands, and touched his
feet, and laid his hands upon his head.  
**9.** And Jesus said, Have you here anything to eat.  
**10.** And they brought out a fragment of a fish; he ate it in the
presence of them all and then the ten believed.  
**11.** Nathaniel said, And now we know that he has risen from the dead;
he stands a surety of the resurrection of the dead. And Jesus
disappeared.  
**12.** Now, Mary, Martha, Ruth and Lazarus were in their home, and they
had heard the rumour that their Lord had risen from the dead, and Martha
said,  
**13.** It cannot be, for such a thing has never happened since the
world began.  
**14.** But Mary said, Did not the Lord bring back our brother from the
dead? and he could surely bring himself to life again.  
**15.** And as they talked, the Lord stood in their midst and said,  
**16.** All hail! For I am risen from the dead, first fruitage of the
grave!  
**17.** And Martha ran and brought the chair in which the Lord had ever
loved to sit, and Jesus sat down on the chair.  
**18.** And for a long, long time they talked about the trial, and the
scenes of Calvary and of the garden of Siloam.  
**19.** Then Jesus said, Fear not, for I will be your boon companion all
the way; and then he disappeared.
