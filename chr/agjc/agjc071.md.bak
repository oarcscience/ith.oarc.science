#### Chapter 68

Jesus speaks to the people in Bethany. Tells them how to become pure in
heart. Goes to Jerusalem and in the temple reads from a prophetic book.
Goes to Nazareth.  
  
**1.** The news soon spread abroad that Jesus, king of Israel, had come
to Bethany, and all the people of the town came forth to greet the
king.  
**2.** And Jesus, standing in the midst of them, exclaimed, Behold,
indeed, the king has come, but Jesus is not king.  
**3.** The kingdom truly is at hand; but men can see it not with carnal
eyes; they cannot see the king upon the throne.  
**4.** This is the kingdom of the soul; its throne is not an earthly
throne; its king is not a man.  
**5.** When human kings found kingdoms here, they conquer other kings by
force of arms; one kingdom rises on the ruins of another one.  
**6.** But when our Father-God sets up the kingdom of the soul, he pours
his blessings forth, like rain, upon the thrones of earthly kings who
rule in righteousness.  
**7.** It is not rule that God would overthrow; his sword is raised
against injustice, wantonness and crime.  
**8.** Now, while the kings of Rome do justice, and love mercy and walk
humbly with their God, the benediction of the Triune God will rest upon
them all.  
**9.** They need not fear a messenger whom God sends forth to earth.  
**10.** I am not sent to sit upon a throne to rule as Cæsar rules; and
you may tell the ruler of the Jews that I am not a claimant for his
throne.  
**11.** Men call me Christ, and God has recognised the name; but Christ
is not a man. The Christ is universal love, and Love is king.  
**12.** This Jesus is but man who has been fitted by temptations
overcome, by trials multiform, to be the temple through which Christ can
manifest to men.  
**13.** Then hear, you men of Israel, hear! Look not upon the flesh; it
is not king. Look to the Christ within, who shall be formed in every one
of you, as he is formed in me.  
**14.** When you have purified your hearts by faith, the king will enter
in, and you will see his face.  
**15.** And then the people asked, What must we do that we may make our
bodies fit abiding places for the king?  
**16.** And Jesus said, Whatever tends to purity in thought, and word,
and deed will cleanse the temple of the flesh.  
**17.** There are no rules that can apply to all, for men are
specialists in sin; each has his own besetting sin,  
**18.** And each must study for himself how he can best transmute his
tendency to evil things to that of righteousness and love.  
**19.** Until men reach the higher plane, and get away from selfishness,
this rule will give the best results:  
**20.** Do unto other men what you would have them do to you.  
**21.** And many of the people said, We know that Jesus is the Christ,
the king who was to come, and blessed be his name.  
**22.** Now, Jesus and his six disciples turned their faces toward
Jerusalem, and many people followed them.  
**23.** But Matthew, son of Alpheus, ran on before, and when he reached
Jerusalem, he said, Behold the Christines come! The multitudes came
forth to see the king.  
**24.** But Jesus did not speak to any one until he reached the temple
court, and then he opened up a book and read:  
**25.** Behold, I send my messenger, and he will pave the way, and
Christ, for whom you wait, will come unto his temple unannounced.
Behold, for he will come, says God, the Lord of hosts.  
**26.** And then he closed the book; he said no more; he left the temple
halls, and with his six disciples, went his way to Nazareth,  
**27.** And they abode with Mary, Jesus' mother, and her sister, Miriam.
