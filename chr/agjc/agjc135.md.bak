#### Chapter 132

Jesus defends a man who has been convicted of stealing bread. The
verdict is reversed. The man goes free, and the people supply the needs
of his starving family.  
  
**1.** A Multitude of people thronged the streets. The officers were on
the way to court with one, a man accused of stealing bread.  
**2.** And in a little while the man was brought before the judge to
answer to the charge.  
**3.** And Jesus and the twelve were there. The man showed in his face
and hands the hard drawn lines of toil and want.  
**4.** A woman richly clad, the accuser of the man, stood forth and
said, I caught this man myself: I know him well, for yesterday he came
to beg for bread.  
**5.** And when I drove him from my door, he should have known that I
would harbour not a man like him; and then to-day he came and took the
bread.  
**6.** He is a thief and I demand that he be sent to jail.  
**7.** The servants also testified against the man; he was adjudged a
thief, and officers were leading him away.  
**8.** But Jesus standing forth exclaimed, You officers and judge, be
not in haste to lead this man away.  
**9.** Is this a land of justice and of right? can you accuse and
sentence men to punishment for any crime until they testify
themselves?  
**10.** The Roman law will not permit such travesty on right, and I
demand that you permit this man to speak.  
**11.** And then the judge recalled the man and said, If you have any
tale to tell, say on. 12 In tears the man stood forth and said, I have a
wife and little ones and they are perishing for bread, and I have told
my story oft, and begged for bread; but none would hear.  
**13.** This morning when I left our cheerless hut in search of work my
children cried for bread, and I resolved to feed them or to die.  
**14.** I took the bread, and I appeal to God, Was it a crime?  
**15.** This woman snatched the loaf away and threw it to the dogs, and
called the officers and I am here.  
**16.** Good people, do with me whate'er you will, but save my wife and
little ones from death.  
**17.** Then Jesus said, Who is the culprit in this case?  
**18.** I charge this woman as a felon in the sight of God.  
**19.** I charge this judge as criminal before the bar of human
rights.  
**20.** I charge these servants and these officers as parties to the
crime.  
**21.** I charge the people of Capernaum with cruelty and theft, because
they heeded not the cries of poverty and want, and have withheld from
helpless ones that which is theirs by every law of right;  
**22.** And I appeal unto these people here, and ask, Are not my charges
based on righteousness and truth?  
**23.** And every man said, Yes.  
**24.** The accused woman blushed for shame; the judge shrank back in
fear; the officers threw off the shackles from the man and ran away.  
**25.** Then Jesus said, Give this man what he needs and let him go and
feed his wife and little ones.  
**26.** The people gave abundantly; the man went on his way.  
**27.** And Jesus said, There is no standard law to judge of crime. The
facts must all be stated e'er a judgment can be rendered in a case.  
**28.** You men with hearts; go forth and stand where stood this man and
answer me, What would you do?  
**29.** The thief thinks every other man a thief and judges him
accordingly.  
**30.** The man who judges harshly is the man whose heart is full of
crime.  
**31.** The courtesan who keeps her wickedness concealed by what she
calls respectability, has not a word of pity for the honest courtesan
who claims to be just what she is.  
**32.** I tell you, men, if you would censure not till you are free from
sin, the world would soon forget the meaning of the word, accused.
