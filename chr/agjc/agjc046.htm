<p></p> <h4>Chapter 43</h4> <i>
<p>Jesus and Ashbina visit Babylon and remark its desolation. The two masters remain in company seven days; then Jesus resumes his homeward journey. Arrives in Nazareth. His mother gives a feast in his honour. His brothers are displeased. Jesus tells his mother and aunt the story of his journeys.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>The ruined Babylon was near, and Jesus and the sage went through her gates and walked among her fallen palaces.<br> <b>2. </b>They trod the streets where Israel once was held in base captivity.<br> <b>3. </b>They saw where Judah's sons and daughters hung their harps upon the willows, and refused to sing.<br> <b>4. </b>They saw where Daniel and the Hebrew children stood as living witnesses of faith.<br> <b>5. </b>And Jesus lifted up his hand and said, Behold the grandeur of the works of man!<br> <b>6. </b>The king of Babylon destroyed the temple of the Lord in old Jerusalem; he burned the holy city, bound in chains my people and my kin, and brought them here as slaves.<br> <b>7. </b>But retribution comes; for whatsoever men shall do to other men the righteous Judge will do to them.<br> <b>8. </b>The sun of Babylon has gone down; the songs of pleasure will be heard no more within her walls.<br> <b>9. </b>And every kind of creeping thing and unclean bird will, in these ruins, find their homes.<br> <b>10. </b>And in the temple Belus, Jesus and Ashbina stood in silent thought.<br> <b>11. </b>Then Jesus spoke and said, Behold this monument of folly and of shame.<br> <b>12. </b>Man tried to shake the very throne of God, and he assayed to build a tower to reach to heaven, when, lo, his very speech was snatched away, because in lofty words he boasted of his power.<br> <b>13. </b>And on these heights the heathen Baal stood--the god wrought out by hands of man.<br> <b>14. </b>Upon yon altar, birds, and beasts, and men, yea children have been burned in awful sacrifice to Baal.<br> <b>15. </b>But now the gory priests are dead; the very rocks have shuddered and have fallen down; the place is desolate.<br> <b>16. </b>Now, in the plains of Shinar Jesus tarried yet for seven days, and, with Ashbina, meditated long upon the needs of men, and how the sages could best serve the coming age.<br> <b>17. </b>Then Jesus went his way, and after many days he crossed the Jordan to his native land. At once he sought his home in Nazareth.<br> <b>18. </b>His mother's heart was filled with joy; she made a feast for him, inviting all her kindred and her friends.<br> <b>19. </b>But Jesus' brothers were not pleased that such attention should be paid to one they deemed a sheer adventurer, and they went not in to the feast.<br> <b>20. </b>They laughed their brother's claims to scorn; they called him indolent, ambitious, vain; a worthless fortune hunter; searcher of the world for fame, who, after many years returns to mother's home with neither gold, nor any other wealth.<br> <b>21. </b>And Jesus called aside his mother and her sister, Miriam, and told them of his journey to the East.<br> <b>22. </b>He told them of the lessons he had learned, and of the works that he had done. To others he told not the story of his life.</p>
