#### Chapter 105

Under the patronage of a number of wealthy woman, the Christines make a
grand missionary tour. In his teaching Jesus lauds sincerity and rebukes
hypocrisy. He speaks concerning the sin against the Holy Breath.  
  
**1.** Now, many women who possessed much wealth, and abode in other
towns of Galilee, implored that Jesus and the twelve, together with the
masters from the foreign lands, would thither go and preach and heal.  
**2.** Among these anxious ones were Mary Magdalene, who was obsessed by
seven homeless spirits of the air, which had been driven out by the
Omnific Word which Jesus spoke;  
**3.** Susanna, who owned vast estates at Cæsarea-Philippi;  
**4.** Johanna, wife of Chuza, one of Herod's court;  
**5.** And Rachel from the coast of Tyre;  
**6.** And other from beyond the Jordan and the sea of Galilee.  
**7.** And they provided ample means and three times seven men went
forth.  
**8.** They preached the gospel of the Christ and they baptised the
multitudes who made confession of their faith; they healed the sick and
raised the dead.  
**9.** And Jesus wrought and taught from early morn until the day had
gone, and then into the night, he did not stop to eat.  
**10.** His friends became alarmed lest he should fail from loss of
strength, and they laid hold of him and would, by force, have taken him
away to a place of rest.  
**11.** But he rebuked them not; he said, Have you not read that God
will give his angels charge concerning me?  
**12.** That they would hold me fast and suffer not that I should come
to want?  
**13.** I tell you, men, while I am giving out my strength unto these
anxious, waiting throngs I find myself at rest within the arms of God,  
**14.** Whose blessed messengers bring down to me the bread of life.  
**15.** There is a tide just once in human life.  
**16.** These people now are willing to receive the truth; their
opportunity is now; our opportunity is now,  
**17.** And if we do not teach them while we may, the tide will ebb;  
**18.** They may not care again to hear the truth; then tell me, Who
will bear the guilt?  
**19.** And so he taught and healed.  
**20.** Among the multitudes were men of every shade of thought. They
were divided in their views concerning everything that Jesus said.  
**21.** Some saw in him a God, and would have worshipped him; and others
saw in him a devil of the nether world and would have cast him in a
pit.  
**22.** And some were trying hard to lead a double life; like little
lions of the ground that take upon themselves the colour of the thing
they rest upon.  
**23.** These people without anchorage of any sort, are friends or foes
as seemed to serve them best.  
**24.** And Jesus said, No man can serve two masters at a time. No man
can be a friend and foe at once.  
**25.** All men are rising up, or sinking down; are building up, or
tearing down.  
**26.** If you are gathering not the precious grain, then you are
throwing it away.  
**27.** He is a coward who would feign to be a friend, or foe, to please
another man.  
**28.** You men, do not deceive yourselves in thought; your hearts are
known;  
**29.** Hypocrisy will blight a soul as surely as the breath of
Beelzebul. An honest evil man is more esteemed by guardians of the soul
than a dishonest pious man.  
**30.** If you would curse the son of man, just curse him out aloud.  
**31.** A curse is poison to the inner man, and if you hold and swallow
down a curse it never will digest; lo, it will poison every atom of your
soul.  
**32.** And if you sin against a son of man, you may be pardoned and
your guilt be cleansed by acts of kindness and of love;  
**33.** But if you sin against the Holy Breath by disregarding her when
she would open up the doors of life for you;  
**34.** By closing up the windows of the soul when she would pour the
light of love into your hearts, and cleanse them with the fires of
God;  
**35.** Your guilt shall not be blotted out in this, nor in the life to
come.  
**36.** An opportunity has gone to come no more, and you must wait until
the ages roll again.  
**37.** Then will the Holy Breath again breathe on your fires of life,
and fan them to a living flame.  
**38.** Then she will open up the doors again, and you may let her in to
sup with you for evermore, or you may slight her once again, and then
again.  
**39.** You men of Israel, your opportunity is now.  
**40.** Your tree of life is an illusive tree; it has a generous crop of
leaves; its boughs hang low with fruit.  
**41.** Behold, your words are leaves; your deeds the fruit.  
**42.** Behold, for men have plucked the apples of your tree of life,
and found them full of bitterness; and worms have eaten to the core.  
**43.** Behold that fig tree by the way so full of leaves and worthless
fruit!  
**44.** Then Jesus spoke a word that nature spirits know, and lo, the
fig tree stood a mass of withered leaves.  
**45.** And then he spoke again, Behold, for God will speak the Word,
and you will stand a withered fig tree in the setting sun.  
**46.** You men of Galilee, send forth and call the pruner in before it
is too late, and let him prune away your worthless branches and illusive
leaves, and let the sunshine in.  
**47.** The sun is life, and it can change your worthlessness to
worth.  
**48.** Your tree of life is good; but you have nurtured it so long with
dews of self, and mists of carnal things that you have shut the sunshine
out.  
**49.** I tell you, men, that you must give account to God for every
idle word you speak and every evil deed you do.
