<p></p> <h4>Chapter 62</h4> <i>
<p>John, the harbinger, again visits Jerusalem. Speaks to the people. Promises to meet them at Gilgal in seven days. Goes to Bethany and attends a feast.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>Next day John went again into the temple courts and said,<br> <b>2. </b>Prepare, O Israel, prepare to meet your king.<br> <b>3. </b>The chief priests and the scribes would know the meaning of his words; they said.<br> <b>4. </b>Bold man, what is the purport of this message that you bring to Israel? If you be seer and prophet tell us plainly who has sent you here?<br> <b>5. </b>And John replied, I am the voice of one who cries out in the wilderness, Prepare the way, make straight the paths, for, lo, the Prince of Peace will come to rule in love.<br> <b>6. </b>Your prophet Malachi wrote down the words of God:<br> <b>7. </b>And I will send Elijah unto you before the retribution day shall come, to turn again the hearts of men to God, and if they will not turn, lo, I will smite them with a curse.<br> <b>8. </b>You men of Israel; you know your sins. As I passed by I saw a wounded bird prone in your streets, and men of every class were beating it with clubs; and then I saw that Justice was its name.<br> <b>9. </b>I looked again and saw that its companion had been killed; the pure white wings of Righteousness were trampled in the dust.<br> <b>10. </b>I tell you men, your awfulness of guilt has made a cesspool of iniquity that sends a fearful stench to heaven.<br> <b>11. </b>Reform, O Israel, reform; prepare to meet your king.<br> <b>12. </b>And then John turned away and as he went he said,<br> <b>13. </b>In seven days, lo, I will stand at Gilgal, by the Jordan ford, where Israel first crossed into the promised land.<br> <b>14. </b>And then he left the temple court to enter it no more; but many people followed him as far as Bethany, and there he tarried at the home of Lazarus, his kin.<br> <b>15. </b>The anxious people gathered all about the home and would not go; then John came forth and said,<br> <b>16. </b>Reform, O Israel, reform; prepare to meet your king.<br> <b>17. </b>The sins of Israel do not all lie at the door of priest and scribe. O think you not that all the sinners of Judea are found among the rulers and the men of wealth.<br> <b>18. </b>It is no sign that man is good and pure because he lives in want.<br> <b>19. </b>The listless, shiftless vagabonds of earth are mostly poor and have to beg for bread.<br> <b>20. </b>I saw the very men that cheered because I told the priests and scribes of their injustice unto man, throw stones and beat poor Justice in the streets.<br> <b>21. </b>I saw them trample on the poor dead bird of Righteousness;<br> <b>22. </b>And you who follow after me, you commoners, are not one whit behind the scribes and priests in crime.<br> <b>23. </b>Reform, you men of Israel; the king has come; prepare to meet your king.<br> <b>24. </b>With Lazarus and his sisters, John remained for certain days.<br> <b>25. </b>In honour of the Nazarite a feast was spread, and all the people stood about the board.<br> <b>26. </b>And when the chief men of the town poured out the sparkling wine and offered John a cup, he took it, held it high in air, and said,<br> <b>27. </b>Wine makes glad the carnal heart, and it makes sad the human soul; it plunges deep in bitterness and gall the deathless spirit of the man.<br> <b>28. </b>I took the vow of Nazar when a child, and not a drop has ever passed my lips.<br> <b>29. </b>And if you would make glad the coming king, then shun the cup as you would shun a deadly thing.<br> <b>30. </b>And then he threw the sparking wine out in the street.</p>
