#### Chapter 155

Jesus recognises the justice of paying secular taxes. He teaches a
lesson on family relationships in the life beyond. The greatest of the
commandments is comprised in love. He warns his disciples against the
hypocrisy of scribes and Pharisees.  
  
**1.** As Jesus spoke, the Pharisees came up to question him; they
thought to criminate him by what he said,  
**2.** A strict Herodian spoke and said, My Lord, you are a man of
truth; you show the way to God, and you do not regard the personality of
men;  
**3.** Tell us, what do you think; should we, who are the seed of
Abraham, pay tribute unto Cæsar? or should we not?  
**4.** And Jesus knew his wickedness of heart and said, Why do you come
to tempt me thus? Show me the tribute money that you speak about.  
**5.** The man brought forth a piece of coin on which an image was
engraved.  
**6.** And Jesus said, Whose image and whose name is on this coin?  
**7.** The man replied, 'Tis Cæsar's image and his name.  
**8.** And Jesus said, Give unto Cæsar that which is Cæsar's own; but
give to God the things of God.  
**9.** And they who heard him said, He answers well.  
**10.** And then a Sadducee, who thinks there is no resurrection of the
dead, came up and said, Rabboni, Moses wrote that if a married man shall
die, and have no child, his widow shall become his brother's wife.  
**11.** Now, there were seven brothers and the eldest had a wife; he
died and had no child; a brother took his widow for his wife, and then
he died;  
**12.** And every brother had this woman for his wife; in course of time
the woman died;  
**13.** Now which will have this woman for a wife in the resurrection
day?  
**14.** And Jesus said, Here in this plane of life men marry just to
gratify their selfish selfs, or to perpetuate the race; but in the world
to come, and in the resurrection day, men do not take upon themselves
the marriage vows.  
**15.** But, like the angels and the other sons of God, they form not
unions for the pleasure of the self, nor to perpetuate the race.  
**16.** Death does not mean the end of life. The grave is not the goal
of men, no more than is the earth the goal of seeds.  
**17.** Life is the consequence of death. The seed may seem to die, but
from its grave the tree arises into life.  
**18.** So man may seem to die, but he lives on, and from the grave he
springs up into life.  
**19.** If you could comprehend the word that Moses spoke about the
burning bush that burned and still was not consumed, then you would know
that death cannot destroy the life.  
**20.** And Moses said that God is God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of
Israel.  
**21.** God is not God of dead men's bones, but the living man.  
**22.** I tell you, men, man goes down to the grave, but he will rise
again and manifest the life;  
**23.** For every life is hid with Christ in God, and man shall live
while God shall live.  
**24.** The Pharisees and scribes who heard the Lord, exclaimed, He
speaks the truth; and they were glad to have the Sadducees
discomfited.  
**25.** And then an honest scribe came forth and said to Jesus, Lord,
you speak as one whom God has sent, and may I ask,  
**26.** Which is the greatest and the first of the Commandments of the
Law?  
**27.** And Jesus said, The first is Hear O Israel, the Lord our God is
one; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all
your mind, with all your soul, with all your strength;  
**28.** And you shall love your neighbour as yourself.  
**29.** These are the greatest of the ten, and on them hang the Law, the
Prophets and the Psalms.  
**30.** The scribe replied, My soul gives witness that you speak the
truth, for love fulfils the law, and far transcends burnt offerings and
sacrifice.  
**31.** And Jesus said to him, Lo, you have solved a mystery; you are
within the kingdom and the kingdom is in you.  
**32.** To his disciples Jesus spoke, and all the people heard; he said,
Beware you of the scribes and Pharisees who pride themselves in wearing
long and richly decorated robes,  
**33.** And Love to be saluted in the market place, and seek the highest
seats at feasts, and take the hard-earned wages of the poor to satisfy
their carnal selves, and pray in public, long and loud.  
**34.** These are the wolves who clothe themselves to look like sheep.  
**35.** And then he said to all, The scribes and Pharisees are placed by
law in Moses' seat, and by the law they interpret law;  
**36.** So what they bid you do, that do; but do not imitate their
deeds.  
**37.** They say the things that Moses taught; they do the things of
Beelzebul.  
**38.** They talk of mercy, yet they bind on human shoulders burdens
grievous to bear.  
**39.** They talk of helpfulness, and yet they put not forth the
slightest helpful efforts for their brother man.  
**40.** They make a show of doing things, and yet they do not anything
but show their gaudy robes, and broad phylacteries, and smile when
people call them honoured masters of the law.  
**41.** They strut about and show their pride when people call them
father, so and so.  
**42.** Hear, now, you men, Call no man father here. The God of heaven
and earth, and he alone, is Father of the race of men.  
**43.** Christ is the hierarch, the high, exalted master of the sons of
men.  
**44.** If you would be exalted, sit down at the master's feet and
serve. He is the greatest man who serves the best.
