#### Chapter 98

The Sermon on the Mount, continued. Jesus reveals to the twelve the
spiritual aspects of the seventh, eight and tenth Commandments.  
  
**1.** The law forbids adultery; but in the eyes of law adultery is an
overt act, the satisfaction of the sensuous self outside the marriage
bonds.  
**2.** Now, marriage in the sight of law is but a promise made by man
and woman, by the sanction of a priest, to live for aye in harmony and
love.  
**3.** No priest nor officer has power from God to bind two souls in
wedded love.  
**4.** What is the marriage tie? Is it comprised in what a priest or
officer may say?  
**5.** Is it the scroll on which the officer or priest has written the
permission for the two to live in marriage bonds?  
**6.** Is it the promise of the two that they will love each other until
death?  
**7.** Is love a passion that is subject to the will of man?  
**8.** Can man pick up his love, as he would pick up precious gems, and
lay it down, or give it out to any one?  
**9.** Can love be bought and sold like sheep?  
**10.** Love is the power of God that binds two souls and makes them
one; there is no power on earth that can dissolve the bond.  
**11.** The bodies may be forced apart by man or death for just a little
time; but they will meet again.  
**12.** Now, in this bond of God we find the marriage tie; all other
unions are but bonds of straw, and they who live in them commit
adultery.  
**13.** The same as they who satisfy their lust without the sanction of
an officer or priest.  
**14.** But more than this; the man or woman who indulges lustful
thoughts commits adultery.  
**15.** Whom God has joined together man cannot part; whom man has
joined together live in sin.  
**16.** Upon a table of the law, the great lawgiver wrote, Thou shalt
not steal.  
**17.** Before the eyes of law a man to steal must take a thing that can
be seen with eyes of flesh, without the knowledge or consent of him to
whom the thing belongs.  
**18.** But, lo, I say that he who in his heart desires to possess that
which is not his own, and would deprive the owner of the thing without
his knowledge or consent, is in the sight of God, a thief.  
**19.** The things that men see not with eyes of flesh are of more worth
than are the things that man can see.  
**20.** A man's good name is worth a thousand mines of gold, and he who
says a word or does a deed that injures or defames that name has taken
what is not his own, and is a thief.  
**21.** Upon a table of the law we also read: Thou shalt not covet
anything.  
**22.** To covet is an all-consuming wish to have what is not right for
one to have.  
**23.** And such a wish, within the spirit of the law, is theft.
