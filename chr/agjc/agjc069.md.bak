#### Chapter 66

Six of John's disciples follow Jesus and become his disciples. He
teaches them. They sit in the Silence.  
  
**1.** Among the followers of John were many men from Galilee. The most
devout were Andrew, Simon, James, and John, with Philip and his brother
of Bethsaida.  
**2.** One day as Andrew, Philip and a son of Zebedee, were talking with
the harbinger, the Logos came, and John exclaimed, Behold the Christ!  
**3.** And then the three disciples followed Jesus, and he asked, What
do you seek?  
**4.** And the disciples asked, Where do you live? And Jesus answered,
Come and see.  
**5.** And Andrew called his brother Simon, saying, Come with me, for I
have found the Christ.  
**6.** When Jesus looked in Simon's face he said, Behold a rock! and
Peter is your name.  
**7.** And Philip found Nathaniel sitting by a tree, and said, My
brother, come with me, for I have found the Christ! In Nazareth he
abides.  
**8.** Nathaniel said, Can anything of good come out of Nazareth? And
Philip answered, Come and see.  
**9.** When Jesus saw Nathaniel come he said, Behold an Israelite indeed
in whom there is no guile!  
**10.** Nathaniel said, How can you speak about me thus?  
**11.** And Jesus said, I saw you as you sat beneath the fig tree over
there, before your brother called.  
**12.** Nathaniel lifted up his hands and said, This surely is the
Christ, the king, for whom the harbinger has often testified.  
**13.** And John went forth and found his brother James, and brought him
to the Christ.  
**14.** The six disciples went with Jesus to the place where he abode.  
**15.** And Peter said, We long have sought for Christ. We came from
Galilee to John; we thought that he was Christ, but he confessed to us
that he was not;  
**16.** That he was but the harbinger sent forth to clear the way, and
make the pathway easy for the coming king; and when you came he said,
Behold the Christ!  
**17.** And we would gladly follow where you go. Lord, tell us what to
do.  
**18.** And Jesus said, The foxes of the earth have homes, the birds
have nests; I have no, place to lay my head.  
**19.** He who would follow me must give up all cravings of the self and
lose his life in saving life.  
**20.** I come to save the lost, and man is saved when he is rescued
from himself. But men are slow to comprehend this doctrine of the
Christ.  
**21.** And Peter said, I cannot speak for any other man, but for myself
I speak: I will leave all and follow where you lead.  
**22.** And then the others spoke and said, You have the words of truth;
you came from God, and if we follow in your footsteps we cannot miss the
way.  
**23.** Then Jesus and the six disciples sat a long, long time in silent
thought.
