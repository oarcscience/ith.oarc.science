#### Chapter 53

Jesus passes the sixth brotherhood test and receives the sixth degree,
LOVE DIVINE.  
  
**1.** In all the land there is no place more grandly furnished than the
Beauty Parlours of the temple of the sun.  
**2.** Few students ever entered these rich rooms; the priests regarded
them with awe, and called them Halls of Mysteries.  
**3.** When Jesus had attained the victory over fear, he gained the
right to enter here.  
**4.** The guide led on the way, and after passing many richly furnished
rooms they reached the Hall of Harmony; and here was Jesus left alone.  
**5.** Among the instruments of music was a harpsichord, and Jesus sat
in thoughtful mood inspecting it, when, quietly, a maiden of entrancing
beauty came into the hall.  
**6.** She did not seem to notice Jesus as he sat and mused, so busy
with his thoughts.  
**7.** She found her place beside the harpsichord; she touched the
chords most gently, and she sung the songs of Israel.  
**8.** And Jesus was entranced; such beauty he had never seen; such
music he had never heard.  
**9.** The maiden sung her songs; she did not seem to know that any one
was near; she went her way.  
**10.** And Jesus, talking with himself, said out, What is the meaning
of this incident? I did not know that such entrancing beauty and such
queen-like loveliness were ever found among the sons of men.  
**11.** I did not know that voice of angel ever graced a human form, or
that seraphic music ever came from human lips.  
**12.** For days he sat entranced; the current of his thoughts was
changed; he thought of nothing but the singer and her songs.  
**13.** He longed to see her once again; and after certain days she
came; she spoke and laid her hand upon his head.  
**14.** Her touch thrilled all his soul, and for the time, forgotten was
the work that he was sent to do.  
**15.** Few were the words the maiden said; she went her way; but then
the heart of Jesus had been touched.  
**16.** A love-flame had been kindled in his soul, and he was brought to
face the sorest trial of his life.  
**17.** He could not sleep nor eat. Thoughts of the maiden came; they
would not go. His carnal nature called aloud for her companionship.  
**18.** And then he said, Lo, I have conquered every foe that I have
met, and shall I now be conquered by this carnal love?  
**19.** My Father sent me here to show the power of love divine, that
love that reaches every living thing.  
**20.** Shall this pure, universal love be all absorbed by carnal love?
Shall I forget all creatures else, and lose my life in this fair maiden,
though she is the highest type of beauty, purity and love?  
**21.** Into its very depths his soul was stirred, and long he wrestled
with this angel-idol of his heart.  
**22.** But when the day was almost lost, his higher ego rose in might;
he found himself again, and then he said,  
**23.** Although my heart shall break I will not fail in this my hardest
task; I will be victor over carnal love.  
**24.** And when again the maiden came, and offered him her hand and
heart, he said,  
**25.** Fair one, your very presence thrills me with delight; your voice
is benediction to my soul; my human self would fly with you, and be
contented in your love;  
**26.** But all the world is craving for a love that I have come to
manifest.  
**27.** I must, then, bid you go; but we will meet again; our ways on
earth will not be cast apart.  
**28.** I see you in the hurrying throngs of earth as minister of love;
I hear your voice in song, that wins the hearts of men to better
things.  
**29.** And then in sorrow and in tears the maiden went away, and Jesus
was again alone.  
**30.** And instantly the great bells of the temple rang; the singers
sung a new, new song; the grotto blazed with light.  
**31.** The hierophant himself appeared, and said, All hail! triumphant
Logos, hail! The conqueror of carnal love stands on the heights.  
**32.** And then he placed in Jesus' hands a scroll on which was
written, LOVE DIVINE.  
**33.** Together they passed through the grotto of the beautiful, and in
the banquet hall a feast was served, and Jesus was the honoured guest.
