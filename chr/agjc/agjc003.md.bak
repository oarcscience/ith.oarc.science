# INTRODUCTION

BY

EVA S. DOWLING, A.Ph.D.,

SCRIBE TO THE MESSENGER.

### THE BOOK.

The full title of this book is "The Aquarian Age Gospel of Jesus, the
Christ of the Piscean Age," and the critical reader is apt to ask a
number of pertinent questions concerning it. Among the many anticipated
questions these are perhaps the most important:

1 What is an Age?

2 What is the Piscean Age?

3 What is the Aquarian Age?

4 What is meant by the Christ as the word is used in this book?

5 What relationship existed between Jesus of Nazareth and the Christ?

6 Who is Levi, the transcriber of this book?

7 What are the Akashic Records?

1 *What is an Age*? Astronomers tell us that our sun and his family of
planets revolve around a central sun, which is millions of miles
distant, and that it requires something less than 26,000 years to make
one revolution. His orbit is called the Zodiac, which is divided into
twelve signs, familiarly known as Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo,
Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces. It
requires our Solar System a little more than 2,100 years to pass through
one of these signs, and this time is the measurement of an Age or
Dispensation. Because of what Astronomers call "the precession of the
Equinoxes" the movement of the sun through the signs of the Zodiac is in
order reverse from that given above.

Exact Time of the Beginning of an Age. Regarding this matter there is a
disagreement among astronomers; but in this Introduction we are not
called upon to give the reasons of the various investigators for their
opinions, there are enough well authenticated facts for our present
purposes. It is conceded by all critical students that the sun entered
the zodiacal sign Taurus in the days of our historic Adam when the
Taurian Age began, that Abraham lived not far from the beginning of the
Arian Age, when the sun entered the sign Aries. About the time of the
rise of the Roman empire the sun entered the sign Pisces, the Fishes,
and the Piscean Age began, so that early in this Age Jesus of Nazareth
lived.

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

2 *What is the Piscean Age*? This question requires further
consideration. The Piscean Age is identical with the Christian
Dispensation. The word Pisces means fish. The sign is known as a water
sign, and the Piscean Age has been distinctly the age of the fish and
its element, water.

In the establishment of their great institutions John the Harbinger and
Jesus both introduced the rite of water baptism, which has been used in
some form in all the so-called Christian Churches and cults, even to the
present time. Water is the true symbol of purification. Jesus himself
said to the Harbinger before he was baptised: "All men must be washed,
symbolic of the cleansing of the soul." (Aquarian Gospel 64:7.)

Fish was a Christian Symbol. In the earlier centuries of the Christian
Dispensation the fish was everywhere used as a symbol. In his remarkable
book, "Christian Iconography," Didron says:

"The fish, in the opinion of antiquarians generally, is the symbol of
Jesus Christ. The fish is sculptured upon a number of Christian
monuments, and more particularly upon the ancient sarcophagi. It is also
upon medals, bearing the name of our Saviour and also upon engraved
stones, cameos and intaglios, The fish is also to be remarked upon the
amulets worn suspended from the necks by children, and upon ancient
glasses and sculptured lamps.

"Baptismal fonts are more particularly ornamented with the fish. The
fish is constantly exhibited placed upon a dish in the middle of the
table, at the Last Supper, among the loaves, knives and cups used at the
banquet."

In the writings of Tertullian we find this statement: "We are little
fishes in Christ our great fish."

The last two thousand years, comprising the Piscean Age, has certainly
been one of water and the many uses of that element have been
emphasised, and sea and lake and river navigation has been brought to a
high degree of efficiency.

3 *What is the Aquarian Age*? The human race is to-day standing upon the
cusp of the Piscean-Aquarian Ages. Aquarius is an air sign and the New
Age is already noted for remarkable inventions for the use of air,
electricity, magnetism, etc. Men navigate the air as fish do the sea,
and send their thoughts spinning around the world with the speed of
lightning.

The word Aquarius is derived from the Latin word aqua, meaning water.
Aquarius is, however, the *water bearer*, and the symbol of the sign,
which is the, eleventh sign of the Zodiac, is a man carrying in his
right hand a pitcher of water. Jesus referred to the beginning of the
Aquarian Age in these words:

"And then the man who bears the pitcher will walk forth across an are of
heaven; the sign and signet of the Son of Man will stand forth in the
eastern sky. The wise will then lift up their heads and know that the
redemption of the earth is near." (Aquarian Gospel 157: 29, 30.)

The Aquarian Age is pre-eminently a spiritual age, and the spiritual
side of the great lessons that Jesus gave to the world may now be
comprehended by multitudes of people, for the many are now coming into
an advanced stage of spiritual consciousness; so with much propriety
this book is called "The Aquarian (or Spiritual) Gospel of Jesus, the
Christ."

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

An Important Event. The transfer of dominion from one Age to another is
an important event in the world of Cherubim and Seraphim. Among the
manuscripts of Levi we have found a most remarkable paper describing the
transfer of dominion from the Piscean Age to the Aquarian Age, but it is
difficult to determine whether it is a recital of facts or a prophetic
statement. We reproduce the paper in full.

THE CUSP OF THE AGES.

"In Spirit I was caught away into the realms of Akasha; I stood alone
within the circle of the sun.

And there I found the secret spring that opens up the door to Wisdom and
an understanding heart.

I entered in and then I knew.

I saw the four and twenty Cherubim and Seraphim that guard 'the circle
of the sun, the mighty ones who were proclaimed by masters long ago 'the
four and twenty ancient ones.'

"I heard the names of every Cherubim and Seraphim, and learned that
every sign in all the Zodiac is ruled by two--a Cherubim and Seraphim.

"And then I stood upon the cusp where Ages meet. The Piscean Age had
passed; the Aquarian Age had just begun.

"I saw the guardian Spirits of the Piscean Age; Ramasa is the Cherubim;
Vacabiel is Seraphim.

"I saw the guardian Spirits of the Aquarian Age, and Archer is the
Cherubim; Sakmaquil is the Seraphim.

"These four great spirits of the Triune God stood close together on the
cusp, and in the presence of the sacred Three-the God of Might, the God
of Wisdom, and the God of Love--the sceptre of Domain, of Might, of
Wisdom and of Love was there transferred.

"I heard the charges of the Triune God; but these I may not now reveal.

"I heard the history of the Piscean Age from Piscean Cherubim and
Seraphim, and when I took my pen to write Ramasa said:

"Not now, my son, not now; but you may write it down for men when men
have learned the sacred laws of Brotherhood, of Peace on earth,
good-will to every living thing.

"And then I beard the Aquarian Cherubim and Seraphim proclaim the Gospel
of the coming Age, the age of Wisdom, of the Son of Man.

"And when the crown was lifted from the head of Ramasa and placed upon
the head of Archer of the Aquarian Age; and when the royal sceptre was
transferred from Seraphim Vacabiel to Seraphim Sakmaquil there was deep
silence in the courts of heaven.

"And then the goddess Wisdom spoke, and with her hands outstretched she
poured the benedictions of the Holy Breath upon the rulers of Aquarius.

"I may not write the words she spoke, but I may tell the Gospel of the
coming age that Archer told when he received the crown.

"And I may breathe to men the song of praise that Seraphim Sakmaquil
sung when she received the royal sceptre of the newborn age.

"This Gospel I will tell, and I will sing this song in every land, to
all the people, tribes and tongues of earth."

4\. *What is Meant by "the Christ," as the Word is Used in This Book*?
The word Christ is derived from the Greek word Kristos and means
anointed. It is identical with the Hebrew word Messiah. The word Christ,
per se, does not refer to any particular person; every anointed person
is christed. When the definite article "the" is placed before the word
christ a definite personality is indicated, and this personality is none
other than a member of the Trinity, the Son who had a glory with the
Father-Mother before the worlds were formed.

According to the teachings of all ancient masters this Son is Love; so
the Christ is Love, and Love is God, since God is Love.

Another remarkable manuscript found in Levi's Akashic portfolio gives
the clearest possible ideal of the Christ, or Love of God. It is
presumed that this manuscript is a direct transcription from the Akashic
Records and its importance demands its reproduction here in full.

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

THE CHRIST.

Before creation was the Christ walked with the Father God and Mother God
in Akasha.

"The Christ is son, the only son begotten by Almighty God, the God of
Force and God omniscient, God of thought; and Christ is God, the God of
Love.

"Without the Christ there was no light. Through Christ all life was
manifest; and so through him all things were done, and naught was done
in forming worlds or peopling worlds without the Christ.

"Christ is the Logos of Infinities and through the word alone are
Thought and Force made manifest.

"The Son is called the Christ, because the Son, the Love, the universal
Love, was set apart, ordained to be creator, Lord, preserver and
redeemer of all things, of everything that is, or evermore will be.

"Through Christ, the protoplast, the earth, the plant, the beast, the
man, the angel and the cherubim took up their stations on their planes
of life.

"Through Christ they are preserved and if they fall it is the Christ who
lifts them up; and if they sell themselves to sin the Christ redeems.

"Now Christ, the universal Love, pervades all spaces of infinity, and so
there is no end to love.

"From the great heart of Love unnumbered spirits were sent forth to
demonstrate the height, the depth, the width, the boundlessness of Love.

"To every world and star and moon and sun a master spirit of this Love
divine was sent; and all were full anointed with the oil of helpfulness,
and each became a Christ.

"All glorious in his majesty is Christ, who spread the pure white robe
of Love o'er all the planes of earth--The Christ of earth, its heaven,
its graves.

"In course of time the protoplast, the earth, the plant, the beast, the
man sold out their birthrights unto sin; but Christ was present to
redeem.

"Hid in the holiest place in all infinities is locked the scroll that
bears the record of the purposes of God, the Triune God, and there we
read:

"Perfection is the ultimate of life. A seed is perfect in its embryotic
life, but it is destined to unfold, to grow.

"Into the soil of every plane these seeds, which were the Thoughts of
God, were cast-the seeds of protoplast, of earth, of plant, of beast, of
man, of angel and of cherubim, and they who sowed the seeds, through
Christ, ordained that they should grow, and should return at last, by
effort of unnumbered years, to the great granary of thought, and each be
a perfection of its kind.

"And in the boundless blessedness of Love the man was made the Lord of
protoplast of earth, of plant, of beast; and Christ proclaimed: Man
shall have full dominion over everything that is upon these planes of
life; and it was so.

"And he who gave the lordship unto man declared that he must rule by
Love.

"But men grew cruel and they lost their power to rule, and protoplast,
and earth, and plant and beast became at enmity with man; he lost his
heritage; but Christ was present to redeem.

"But man had lost his consciousness of right; he could no longer
comprehend the boundlessness of Love; he could see naught but self, and
things of self; but Christ was there to seek the lost and save.

"So that he might be close to man in all the ways of life, that man
might comprehend the mighty spirit of the Love, the Christ of earth made
manifest to human eyes and ears by taking his abode in some pure person,
well prepared by many lives to be a fit abiding place of Love.

"Thus Christ made manifest Love's power to save; but, men forgot so
soon, and so Christ must manifest again, and then again.

"And ever since man took his place in form of flesh the Christ has been
manifest in flesh at first of every age."

5 *What relationship existed between Jesus of Nazareth an the Christ*?
Orthodox Christian ecclesiastics tell us that Jesus of Nazareth and the
Christ were one; that the true name of this remarkable person was Jesus
Christ. They tell us that this man of Galilee was the very eternal God
clothed in flesh of man that men might see his glory. Of course this

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

doctrine is wholly at variance with the teachings of Jesus himself and
of his apostles. The Aquarian Masters in council have formulated an
answer to this question that so well covers all the information required
that we give it in full:

"Jesus was an ideal Jew, born in Bethlehem of Judea. His mother was a
beautiful Jewish girl named Mary. As a child Jesus differed but little
from other children only that in past lives be had overcome carnal
propensities to such an extent that he could be tempted like others and
not yield. Paul was right when to the Hebrews he said: 'He was in all
points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.'--Hebrews 4:15.

Jesus suffered as other men suffer, and was made perfect through
suffering; for this is the only way to perfection. His life was an
example of attainment by the way of crosses and cruel treatment. Paul
was right again when he said: 'It became him, for whom are all things
and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons into glory to make the
captain of their salvation perfect through suffering.'--Hebrews 2:10.

"In many respects Jesus was a remarkable child, for by ages of strenuous
preparation he was qualified to be an avatar, a saviour of the world,
and from childhood he was endowed with superior wisdom and was conscious
of the fact that he was competent to lead the race into the higher ways
of spiritual living. But he was conscious also of the fact that he must
attain the mastery by trials, buffetings, temptations and sufferings.
And all his life was spent in attaining. After his death, burial and
resurrection he appeared in materialised form before the Silent Brothers
in the temple of Heliopolis, in Egypt, and said:

"'My human life was wholly given to bring my will to tune with the
deific will; when this was done my earth-tasks all were done.

"'You know that all my life was one great drama for the sons of men; a
pattern for the sons of men. I lived to show the possibilities of man.

"'What I have done all men can do, and what I am all men shall
be.'"--Aquarian Gospel 178:43, 46.

"Jesus was the name of the man and it was the only appropriate name for
this kind of a man. The word means Saviour, and Jesus was in more senses
than one a saviour.

The word Christ means "the anointed one," and then it is an official
title. It means, The Master of Love. When we say "Jesus the Christ" we
refer to the man and to his office; just as we do when we say Edward,
the King, or Lincoln, the President. Edward was not always King, and
Lincoln was not always President, and Jesus was not always Christ. Jesus
won his Christship by a strenuous life, and in the Aquarian Gospel,
chapter 65, we have a record of the events of his christing, or
receiving the degree Christ. Here is where he was coronated by the
highest earth authorities as the Christ-King; properly speaking, 'The
Master of Love'; and after this was done he entered at once upon his
Judean and Galilean ministry.

"We recognise the facts that Jesus was man and that Christ was God, so
that in very truth Jesus the Christ was the God-man of the ages."

The Nazarene's Testimony. Jesus himself made the matter clear. Once when
he was speaking to a congregation in Bethany the people called him King
and he stood forth and said:

"'I am not sent to sit upon a throne to rule as Cæsar rules; and you may
tell the ruler of the Jews that I am not a claimant for his throne.

"'Men call me Christ, and God has recognised the name; but Christ is not
a man. The Christ is universal Love, and Love is King.

"'This Jesus is but man who has been fitted by temptations overcome, by
trials multiform, to be the temple through which the Christ can manifest
to men.

"'Then hear, you men of Israel, hear I Look not upon the flesh; it is
not king. Look to the Christ within who shall be formed in every one of
you, as he is formed in me.

"'When you have purified your hearts by faith, the king will enter in
and you will see his face.'"--Aquarian Gospel 68:10-14.

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

Surely this question has been answered. Jesus was man; Christ was Divine
Love-the Love of God, and after thirty years of strenuous life the man
had made his body fit to be the temple of the holy breath and Love took
full possession, and John well said when he declared:

"'And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld the glory
of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.'"

6 *Who was Levi, the Transcriber of this Book*? Regarding the
personality of Levi we are permitted to write but little. Suffice it to
say that he is an American citizen, and has been a close student of the
religions of the world from childhood. When but a boy he was impressed
with the sensitiveness of the finer ethers and believed that in some
manner they were sensitised plates on which sounds, even thoughts, were
recorded. With avidity he entered into the deeper studies of etheric
vibration, determined to solve the great mysteries of the heavens for
himself. Forty years he spent in study and silent meditation, and then
he found himself in that stage of spiritual consciousness that permitted
him to enter the domain of these superfine ethers and become familiar
with their mysteries. He then learned that the imaginings of his boyhood
days were founded upon veritable facts, and that every thought of every
living thing is there recorded.

In his manuscript entitled "The Cusp of the Ages," a part of which we
have already reproduced in this Introduction, we find the following copy
of the Commission, which Levi received from Visel, the Goddess of
Wisdom, or the Holy Breath.

LEVI'S COMMISSION.

"And then Visel the holy one stood forth and said:

"O Levi, son of man, behold, for you are called to be the message bearer
of the coming age-the age of spirit blessedness.

"Give heed, O son of man, for men must know the Christ, the Love of God;
for Love is sovereign balm for all the wounds of men, the remedy for
every ill.

"And man must, be endowed with Wisdom and with Power and with an
Understanding heart.

"Behold the Akasha I Behold the Record Galleries of Visel where every
thought and word and deed of every living thing is written down.

"The needs of men are manifold, and men must know their needs.

"Now, Levi, hearken to my words go forth into these mystic Galleries and
read. There you will find a message for the world; for every man; for
every living thing.

"I breathe upon you now the Holy Breath; you will discriminate, and you

will know the lessons that these Record Books of God are keeping now for
men of this new age.

"This age will be an age of splendour and of light, because it is the
home age of the Holy Breath; and Holy Breath will testify anew for
Christ, the Logos of eternal Love.

"At first of every age this Logos Is made manifest in flesh so man can
see and know and comprehend a Love that is not narrow, circumscribed.

"Twelve times in every revolution of the sun this christed Love of God
is made full manifest in flesh upon the planes of earth, and you may
read in Akasha the wondrous lessons that these Christs have taught to
men; but you shall publish not to men the lessons of the Christs of
ancient times.

"Now, Levi, message bearer of the Spirit Age, take up your pen and
write.

"Write full the story of The Christ who built upon the Solid Rock of
yonder circle of the sun-the Christ who men have known as Enoch the
Initiate.

"Write of his works as prophet, priest and seer; write of his life of
purity

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

and love, and how he changed his carnal flesh to flesh divine without
descending through the gates of death.

"And you may write the story of Melchizedec, the Christ who lived when
Abram lived, and pointed out to men the way to life through sacrifice;
who gave his life a willing sacrifice for men.

"And you may write the story of the Prince of Peace, The Christ who came
as babe in Bethlehem, and travelled every way of life that man must
tread.

"He was despised, rejected and abused; was spit upon, was crucified, but
he revived and rose a conqueror over death that he might show the
possibilities of man.

"A thousand times be said to men: 'I came to show the possibilities of
man; what I have done all men may do, and what I am all men shall be.'

"These stories of The Christ will be enough, for they contain the true
philosophy of life, of death and of the resurrection of the dead.

"They show the spiral journey of the soul until the man of earth and God
are one for evermore."

Levi in Prophecy. About two thousand years ago Elihu, who conducted a
school of the prophets in Zoan Egypt, referred to Levi thus:

"This age will comprehend but little of the works of Purity and Love;
but not a word is lost, for in the Book of God's Remembrance a registry"
is made of every thought and word and deed;

"And when the world is ready to receive, lo, God will send a messenger
to open up the book and copy from its sacred pages all the messages of
Purity and Love.

"Then every man of earth will read the words of life in the language of
his native land, and men will see the light.

"And man again will be at one with God."--Aquarian Gospel 7:25-28.

Further references to the personality of Levi are, seemingly,
unnecessary. It matters but little who he is; his work in the
transcription of the

Aquarian Gospel of Jesus, the Christ, stands unimpeachable. The lessons
of this book all bear the stamp of the Nazarene, for no man except the
world's greatest master could have touched the high chords of divine
Love and Wisdom which characterise the pages of this marvellous book.

7 *What are the Akashic Records*? Akasha is a Sanskrit word, and means
"Primary substance," that out of which all things are formed. According
to Aquarian philosophy, it is the first stage of the crystallisation of
spirit. This philosophy recognises the fact that all primordial
substance is spirit; that matter is spirit moving at a lower rate of
vibration, becoming, as one master expressed it, a coagulum.

This Akashic, or primary substance, is of exquisite fineness and is so
sensitive that the slightest vibrations of an ether any place in the
universe registers an indelible impression upon it.

This primal substance is not relegated to any particular part of the
universe, but is everywhere present. It is in very fact the "Universal
Mind" of which our metaphysicians speak.

When the mind of man is in exact accord with the Universal Mind man
enters into a conscious recognition of these Akashic impressions, and
may collect them and translate them into any language of earth with
which he is familiar.

In the infinite One manifest we note the attributes of Force,
Intelligence and Love, and a person may be in full accord with one of
these attributes and not with the others. One may enter fully into the
spirit of the God of Force and not he imbued with the spirit of
Intelligence; or one may

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

be Wholly absorbed with the spirit of Divine Love and be far removed
from both Intelligence and Force. Furthermore, a person may enter fully
into the consciousness of Holy Breath, or Supreme Intelligence, and be
not at all in rapport with either Love or Force. Knowledge is not gained
through the spirit of either Force or Love. It is only from Universal
Mind, which is Supreme Intelligence, called by Oriental scholars the
Akashic Records, and by Hebrew masters, the Book of God's Remembrance,
that knowledge of any kind can be obtained.

Consciousness; we note three phases of it

1 Consciousness of the omnipotence of God and man.

2 Christ consciousness, or consciousness of Divine Love.

3 Consciousness of the Holy Breath, or of Supreme Intelligence.

We must bear in mind that one of these phases of consciousness does not
necessarily imply either of the others. People are frequently found who
are completely filled with the Love of God, are far advanced in the
science of Christ consciousness, who are absolutely ignorant; have not
the slightest conception of the laws of natural things or of spiritual
things; are not in rapport with the great Teacher which is the Holy
Spirit.

The Akashic Records. The imperishable records of life, known as the
Akashic Records, are wholly in the domain of Supreme Intelligence, or
Universal Mind, and the Akashic Record reader must be in such close
touch with the Holy Spirit, or the Holy Breath, as the ancient masters
call this spirit of Supreme Intelligence, that every thought vibration
is instantly felt in every fibre of his being.

Differentiation. Since all space is charged with the vibrations of
thoughts of all kinds how may the Akashic Record reader differentiate
and gather only the thoughts and life events of a particular person or
group of persons?

Every person has his own distinct vibration and when the reader fully
understands the law of discrimination his whole being is tuned for the
reception of the one particular tone and rhythm, and it is impossible
for any other tone or rhythm to make the slightest impression upon him.
This principle is demonstrated in wireless telegraphy.

It required many years for Levi to learn the Law of Differentiation, and
to come in rapport with the tones and rhythms of Jesus of Nazareth,
Enoch and Melchizedec and their co-labourers. But under the direction of
the Spirit of Supreme Intelligence, he has attained unto this
accomplishment, and now he instantly feels in all his being the
slightest vibrations that come from any of these great centres and, of
course, all of his transcriptions are true to the letter.

MAN.

"What is man that thou art mindful of him, or the son of man that thou
visiteth him?" This was the earnest question of David, the Hebrew
Psalmist, and the 8th Psalm is given wholly to the contemplation of
man--the crowning work of manifest creation. Among the many great
lessons, that Levi has been permitted to gather from the Akashic
Records, or the

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Universal Mind, we
find one on Man in which his descent into physical matter and his final
ascent into an eternal oneness with God is so graphically described that
it certainly merits a place in this Introduction, and we give it in
full:

"Time never was when man was not.

"If life of man at any time began a time would come when it would end.

"The thought of God cannot be circumscribed. No finite mind can
comprehend things infinite.

"All finite things are subject unto change. All finite things will cease
to be, because there was a time when they were not.

"The bodies and the soul of men are finite things, and they will change,
yes, from the finite point of view the time will come when they will be
no more.

"But man himself is not the body, nor the soul; he is a spirit and is
part of God.

"Creative Fiat gave to man, to spirit man, a soul that he might function
on the plane of soul; gave him a body of the flesh, that he might
function on the plane of things made manifest.

"Why did creative Fiat give to spirit man a soul that he might function
on the plane of soul?

"Why did creative Fiat give to soul a body of the flesh that it might
function on the plane of things that are made manifest?

"Hear, now, ye worlds, dominions, powers and thrones!

"Hear, now, ye cherubim, ye seraphim, ye angels and ye men!

"Hear, now, O protoplast, and earth, and plant and beast!

"Bear, now, ye creeping things of earth, ye fish that swim, ye birds
that fly!

"Hear, now, ye winds that blow, ye thunders and ye lightnings of the
sky!

"Hear, now, ye spirits of the fire, of water, earth and air!

"Hear, now, O everything that is, or was, or evermore will be, for
Wisdom speaks from out of the highest plane of spirit life:

"Man is a thought of God; all thoughts of God are infinite; they are not
measured up by time, for things that are concerned With time begin and
end.

"The thoughts of God are from the everlasting of the past unto the never
ending days to come--And so is man, the Spirit-man.

"But man, like every other thought of God, was but a seed, a seed that
held within itself the potencies of God, just as the seed of any plant
of earth holds deep within itself the attributes of every part of that
especial plant.

"So spirit-man, as seed of God, held deep within himself the attributes
of every part of God.

"Now, seeds are perfect, yea, as perfect as the source from which they
come; but they are not unfolded into life made manifest.

"The child in utero is perfect as the mother is.

"So man, the seed, must be deep planted in a soil that he might grow,
untold, as does the bud unfold to show the flower.

"The human seed that came forth from the heart of God was full ordained
to be the lord of plane of soul, and of the plane of things made
manifest.

"So God, the husbandman of every thing that is, threw forth this human
seed into the soil of soul; it grew apace, and man became a living soul;
and he became the lord of all the kingdom of the soul.

"Hark, now, let every creature hear, The plane of soul is but the ether
of the spirit plane vibrating not so fast, and in the slower rhythm of
this plane the essences of life are manifest; the perfumes and the
odours, the true sensations and the all of love are manifest.

"And these soul attributes become a body beautiful.

"A multitude of lessons man must learn upon the plane of soul; and here
he tarries many ages until his lessons are all learned.

"Upon the boundary of the plane of soul the ether began to vibrate
slower still, and then the essences took on a garb; the perfumes and the
odours and the true sensations and the all of love were clothed in
flesh; and man was clothed in flesh.

"Perfected man must pass through all the ways of life, and so a carnal
nature was full manifest, a nature that sprang forth from fleshly
things.

"Without a foe a soldier never knows his strength, and thought must be
developed by the exercise of strength.

"And so this carnal nature soon became a foe that man must fight, that

might be the strength of God made manifest.

"Let every living thing stand still and hear!

Man is the lord of all the plane of manifests; of protoplast, of
mineral, of plant, of beast; but he has given up his birthright, just to
gratify his lower self, his carnal self.

"But man will full regain his lost estate, his heritage; but he must do
it in a conflict that cannot be told in words.

"Yea, he must suffer trials and temptations manifold; but let him know
that cherubim and seraphim that rule the stations of the sun, and
spirits of the mighty God who rule the solar stars are his protectors
and his guides, and they will lead to victory.

"Man will be fully saved, redeemed, perfected by the things he suffers
on the plane of flesh, and on the plane of soul.

"When man has conquered carnal things his garb of flesh will then have
served its purpose well and it will fall, will be no more.

"Then he will stand untrammeled on the plane of soul where he must full
complete his victories.

"Unnumbered foes will stand before the man upon the plane of soul; there
he must overcome, yea, overcome them every one.

"Thus hope will ever be his beacon light; there is no failure for the
human soul, for God is leading on and victory is sure.

"Man cannot die; the spirit man in one with God, and while God lives man
cannot die.

"When man has conquered every foe upon the plane of soul the seed will
have full opened out, will have unfolded in the Holy Breath.

"The garb of soul will then have served its purpose well, and man will
need it never more, and it will pass and be no more.

"And man will then attain unto the blessedness of perfectness and be at
one with God."
