#### Chapter 88

Jesus walks by the sea. Stands in a fishing boat and speaks to the
people. Under his direction the fishermen secure a great catch of fish.
He selects and calls his twelve apostles.  
  
**1.** Beside the sea of Galilee the Christine master walked, and
multitudes of people followed him.  
**2.** The fishing boats had just come in, and Peter and his brother
waited in their boats; their helpers were ashore repairing broken
nets.  
**3.** And Jesus went into a boat and Peter pushed it out a little ways
from shore; and Jesus standing in the boat spoke to the multitude. He
said,  
**4.** Isaiah, prophet of the Lord of hosts, looked forward and he saw
this day; he saw the people standing by the sea, and he exclaimed,  
**5.** The land of Zebulon and Napthali, land beyond the Jordan and
toward the sea, the Gentile Galilee,  
**6.** The people were in darkness, knowing not the way; but, lo, they
saw the Day Star rise; a light streamed forth; they saw the way of life;
they walked therein.  
**7.** And you are blest beyond all people of the earth to-day, because
you first may see the light, and may become the children of the light.  
**8.** Then Jesus said to Peter, Bring your nets aboard, and put out in
the deep.  
**9.** And Peter did as Jesus bade him do; but in a faithless way he
said, This is a useless trip; there are no fish upon this shore of
Galilee to-day; with Andrew I have toiled all night, and taken naught.  
**10.** But Jesus saw beneath the surface of the sea; he saw a multitude
of fish. He said to Peter,  
**11.** Cast out your net upon the right side of the boat.  
**12.** And Peter did as Jesus said, and, lo, the net was filled; it
scarce was strong enough to hold the multitude of fish.  
**13.** And Peter called to John and James, who were near by, for help;
and when the net was hauled to boat, both boats were well nigh filled
with fish.  
**14.** When Peter saw the heavy catch, he was ashamed of what he said;
ashamed because he had no faith, and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and
said, Lord, I believe!  
**15.** And Jesus said, Behold the catch! from henceforth you shall fish
no more for fish;  
**16.** You shall cast forth the Christine net into the sea of human
life, upon the right side of the boat; you shall ensnare the multitudes
to holiness and peace.  
**17.** Now, when they reached the shore the Christine master called to
Peter, Andrew, James and John and said,  
**18.** You fishermen of Galilee, the masters have a mighty work for us
to do; I go, and you may follow me. And they left all and followed
him.  
**19.** And Jesus walked along the shore, and seeing Philip and
Nathaniel walking on the beach he said to them.  
**20.** You teachers of Bethsaida, who long have taught the people Greek
philosophy, the masters have a higher work for you and me to do; I go
and you may follow me; and then they followed him.  
**21.** A little farther on there stood a Roman tribute house, and Jesus
saw the officer in charge; his name was Matthew, who once abode in
Jericho;  
**22.** The youth who once ran on before the Lord into Jerusalem and
said, Behold the Christines come.  
**23.** And Matthew was a man of wealth, and learned in wisdom of the
Jews, the Syrians and the Greeks.  
**24.** And Jesus said to him, Hail, Matthew, trusted servant of the
Cæsars, hail! the masters call us to the tribute house of souls; I go
and you may follow me. And Matthew followed him.  
**25.** Ischariot and his son, whose name was Judas, were employed by
Matthew and were at the tribute house.  
**26.** And Jesus said to Judas, Stay your work; the masters call us to
a duty in the savings bank of souls; I go and you may follow me. and
Judas followed him.  
**27.** And Jesus met a lawyer who heard about the Christine master and
had come from Antioch to study in the school of Christ.  
**28.** This man was Thomas, man of doubt, and yet a Greek philosopher
of culture and of power.  
**29.** But Jesus saw in him the lines of faith, and said to him, The
masters have a need of men who can interpret law; I go, and you may
follow me. And Thomas followed him.  
**30.** And when the evening came and Jesus was at home, behold, there
came his kindred, James and Jude, the sons of Alpheus and Miriam.  
**31.** And these were men of faith, and they were carpenters of
Nazareth.  
**32.** And Jesus said to them, Behold, for you have toiled with me, and
with my father Joseph, building houses for the homes of men. The masters
call us now to aid in building homes for souls; homes built without the
sound of hammer, axe, or saw;  
**33.** I go, and you may follow me. And James and Jude exclaimed, Lord,
we will follow you.  
**34.** And on the morrow Jesus sent a message unto Simon, leader of the
Zelotes, a strict exponent of the Jewish law.  
**35.** And in the message Jesus said, The masters call for men to
demonstrate the faith of Abraham; I go, and you may follow me. and Simon
followed him.
