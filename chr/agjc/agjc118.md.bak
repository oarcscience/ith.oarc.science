#### Chapter 115

Jesus teaches by the sea. He relates the parable of the sower. Tells why
he teaches in parables. Explains the parable of the sower. Relates the
parable of the wheat and tares.  
  
**1.** And Jesus stood beside the sea and taught; the multitudes pressed
close upon him and he went into a boat that was near by and put a little
ways from shore, and then he spoke in parables; he said,  
**2.** Behold, a sower took his seed and went into his field to sow.  
**3.** With lavish hand he scattered forth the seed and some fell in the
hardened paths that men had made,  
**4.** And soon were crushed beneath the feet of other men; and birds
came down and carried all the seeds away.  
**5.** Some seed fell on rocky ground where there was little soil; they
grew and soon the blades appeared and promised much;  
**6.** But then there was no depth of soil, no chance for nourishment,
and in the heat of noonday sun they withered up and died.  
**7.** Some seed fell where thistles grew, and found no earth in which
to grow and they were lost;  
**8.** But other seed found lodgement in the rich and tender soil and
grew apace, and in the harvest it was found that some brought forth a
hundred fold, some sixty fold, some thirty fold.  
**9.** They who have ears to hear may hear; they who hearts to
understand may know.  
**10.** Now, his disciples were beside him in the boat, and Thomas
asked, Why do you speak in parables?  
**11.** And Jesus said, My words, like every master's words, are dual in
their sense.  
**12.** To you who know the language of the soul, my words have meanings
far too deep for other men to comprehend.  
**13.** The other sense of what I say is all the multitude can
understand; these words are food for them; the inner thoughts are food
for you.  
**14.** Let every one reach forth and take the food that he is ready to
receive.  
**15.** And then he spoke that all might hear; he said, Hear you the
meaning of the parable:  
**16.** Men hear my words and understand them not, and then the carnal
self purloins the seed, and not a sign of spirit life appears.  
**17.** This is the seed that fell within the beaten paths of men.  
**18.** And others hear the words of life, and with a fiery zeal receive
them all; they seem to comprehend the truth and promise well;  
**19.** But troubles come; discouragements arise; there is no depth of
thought; their good intentions wither up and die.  
**20.** These are the seeds that fell in stony ground.  
**21.** And others hear the words of truth and seem to know their worth;
but love of pleasure, reputation, wealth and fame fill all the soil; the
seeds are nourished not and they are lost.  
**22.** These are the seeds that fell among the thistles and the
thorns.  
**23.** But others hear the words of truth and comprehend them well;
they sink down deep into their souls; they live the holy life and all
the world is blest.  
**24.** These are the seeds that fell in fertile soil, that brought
forth fruit abundantly.  
**25.** You men of Galilee, take heed to how you hear and how you
cultivate your fields; for if you slight the offers of this day, the
sower may not come to you again in this or in the age to come.  
**26.** Then Jesus spoke another parable; he said:  
**27.** Then kingdom I may liken to a field in which a man sowed
precious seed;  
**28.** But while he slept an evil one went forth and sowed a measure
full of darnel seed; then went his way.  
**29.** The soil was good, and so the wheat and darnel grew; and when
the servants saw the tares among the wheat, they found the owner of the
field and said,  
**30.** You surely sowed good seed; from whence these tares?  
**31.** The owner said, Some evil one out has sown the seed of tares.  
**32.** The servants said, Shall we go out and pull up by the roots the
tares and burn them in the fire?  
**33.** The owner said, No, that would not be well. The wheat and tares
grow close together in the soil, and while you pull the tares you would
destroy the wheat.  
**34.** So we will let them grow together till the harvest time. Then to
the reapers I will say,  
**35.** Go forth and gather up the tares and bind them up and burn them
in the fire, and gather all the wheat into my barns.  
**36.** When he had spoken thus, he left the boat and went up to the
house, and his disciples followed him.
