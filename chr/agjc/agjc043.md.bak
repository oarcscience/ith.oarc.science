#### Chapter 40

Jesus teaches the magians. Explains the Silence and how to enter it.
Kaspar extols the wisdom of Jesus. Jesus teaches in the groves of
Cyrus.  
  
**1.** Now, in the early morning Jesus came again to teach and heal. A
light not comprehended shown about, as though some mighty spirit
overshadowed him.  
**2.** A magus noted this and asked him privately to tell from whence
his wisdom came, and what the meaning of the light.  
**3.** And Jesus said, There is a Silence where the soul may meet its
God, and there the fount of wisdom is, and all who enter are immersed in
light, and filled with wisdom, love and power.  
**4.** The magus said, Tell me about this Silence and this light, that I
may go and there abide.  
**5.** And Jesus said, The Silence is not circumscribed; is not a place
closed in with wall, or rocky steeps, nor guarded by the sword of man.  
**6.** Men carry with them all the time the secret place where they
might meet their God.  
**7.** It matters not where men abide, on mountain top, in deepest vale,
in marts of trade, or in the quiet home; they may at once, at any time,
fling wide the door, and find the Silence, find the house of God; it is
within the soul.  
**8.** One may not be so much disturbed by noise of business, and the
words and thoughts of men if he goes all alone into the valley or the
mountain pass.  
**9.** And when life's heavy load is pressing hard, it is far better to
go out and seek a quiet place to pray and meditate.  
**10.** The Silence is the kingdom of the soul which is not seen by
human eyes.  
**11.** When in the Silence, phantom forms mat flit before the mind; but
they are all subservient to the will; the master soul may speak and they
are gone.  
**12.** If you would find this Silence of the soul you must yourself
prepare the way. None but the pure in heart may enter here.  
**13.** And you must lay aside all tenseness of the mind, all business
cares, all fears, all doubts and troubled thoughts.  
**14.** Your human will must be absorbed by the divine; then you will
come into a consciousness of holiness.  
**15.** You are in the Holy Place, and you will see upon a living shrine
the candle of the Lord aflame.  
**16.** And when you see it burning there, look deep into the temple of
your brain, and you will see it all aglow.  
**17.** In every part, from head to foot. are candles all in place, just
waiting to be lighted by the flaming torch of love.  
**18.** And when you see the candles all aflame, just look, and you will
see, with eyes of soul, the waters of the fount of wisdom rushing on;
and you may drink, and there abide.  
**19.** And then the curtains part, and you are in the Holiest of All,
where rests the Arc of God, whose covering is the Mercy Seat.  
**20.** Fear not to lift the sacred board; the Tables of the Law are in
the Ark concealed.  
**21.** Take them and read them well; for they contain all precepts and
commands that men will ever need.  
**22.** And in the Ark, the magic wand of prophecy lies waiting for your
hand; it is the key to all the hidden meanings of the present, future,
past.  
**23.** And then, behold, the manna there, the hidden bread of life; and
he who eats shall never die.  
**24.** The cherubim have guarded well for every soul this treasure box,
and whosoever will enter in and find his own.  
**25.** Now Kaspar heard the Hebrew master speak and he exclaimed,
Behold, the wisdom of the gods has come to men!  
**26.** And Jesus went his way, and in the sacred groves of Cyrus, where
the multitudes were met, he taught and healed the sick.
