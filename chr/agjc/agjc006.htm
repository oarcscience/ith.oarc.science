<p></p> <h4>Chapter 3</h4> <i>
<p>Birth of Jesus. Masters honour the child. The shepherds rejoice. Zacharias and Elizabeth visit Mary. Jesus is circumcised.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>The time was nearly due for Jesus to be born, and Mary longed to see Elizabeth, and she and Joseph turned their faces toward the Judean hills.<br> <b>2. </b>And when upon their way they came to Bethlehem the day was done, and they must tarry for the night.<br> <b>3. </b>But Bethlehem was thronged with people going to Jerusalem; the inns and homes were filled with guests, and Joseph and his wife could find no place to rest but in a cave where animals were kept; and there they slept.<br> <b>4. </b>At midnight came a cry, a child is born in yonder cave among the beasts. And lo, the promised son of man was born.<br> <b>5. </b>And strangers took the little one and wrapped him in the dainty robes that Mary had prepared and laid him in a trough from which the beasts of burden fed.<br> <b>6. </b>Three persons clad in snow-white robes came in and stood before the child and said,<br> <b>7. </b>All strength, all wisdom and all love be your, Immanuel.<br> <b>8. </b>Now, on the hills of Bethehem were many flocks of sheep with shepherds guarding them.<br> <b>9. </b>The shepherds were devout, were men of prayer, and they were waiting for a strong deliverer to come.<br> <b>10. </b>And when the child of promise came, a man in snow-white robe appeared to them, and they fell back in fear. The man stood forth and said,<br> <b>11. </b>Fear not! behold I bring you joyful news. At midnight in a cave in Bethehem was born the prophet and the king that you have long been waiting for.<br> <b>12. </b>And then the shepherds all were glad; they felt that all the hills were filled with messengers of light, who said,<br> <b>13. </b>All glory be to God on high; peace, peace on earth, good will to men.<br> <b>14. </b>And then the shepherds came with haste to Bethlehem and to the cave, that they might see and honour him whom men had called Immanuel.<br> <b>15. </b>Now, when the morning came, a shepherdess whose home was near, prepared a room for Mary, Joseph and the child; and here they tarried many days.<br> <b>16. </b>And Joseph sent a messenger in haste to Zacharias and Elizabeth to say, The child is born in Bethlehem.<br> <b>17. </b>And Zacharias and Elizabeth took John and came to Bethlehem with words of cheer.<br> <b>18. </b>And Mary and Elizabeth recounted all the wonderous things that had transpired. The people joined with them in praising God.<br> <b>19. </b>According to the custom of the Jews, the child was circumcised; and when they asked, What will you call the child? the mother said, His name is Jesus, as the man of God declared.</p>
