#### SECTION VII  ZAIN  Life and Works of Jesus in Tibet and Western India

#### Chapter 36

Jesus in Lassa. He meets Meng-ste who aids him in reading the ancient
manuscripts. He goes to Ladak. Heals a child. Relates the parable of the
king's son.  
  
**1.** In Lassa of Tibet there was a master's temple, rich in
manuscripts of ancient lore.  
**2.** The Indian sage had read these manuscripts, and he revealed to
Jesus many of the secret lessons they contained; but Jesus wished to
read them for himself.  
**3.** Now, Meng-ste, greatest sage of all the farther East, was in this
temple of Tibet.  
**4.** The path across Emodus heights was difficult; but Jesus started
on his way, and Vidyapati sent with him a trusted guide.  
**5.** And Vidyapati sent a message to Meng-ste, in which he told about
the Hebrew sage, and spoke for him a welcome by the temple priests.  
**6.** Now, after many days, and perils great, the guide and Jesus
reached the Lassa temple in Tibet.  
**7.** And Meng-ste opened wide the temple doors, and all the priests
and masters gave a welcome to the Hebrew sage.  
**8.** And Jesus had access to all the sacred manuscripts, and, with the
help of Meng- ste, read them all.  
**9.** And Meng-ste often talked with Jesus of the coming age, and of
the sacred service best adapted to the people of the age.  
**10.** In Lassa Jesus did not teach. When he finished all his studies
in the temple schools he journeyed toward the West. In many villages he
tarried for a time and taught.  
**11.** At last he reached the pass, and in the Ladak city, Leh, he was
received with favour by the monks, the merchants, and the men of low
estate.  
**12.** And in the monastery he abode, and taught; and then he sought
the common people in the marts of trade; and there he taught.  
**13.** Not far away a woman lived, whose infant son was sick nigh unto
death. The doctors had declared, There is no hope; the child must die.  
**14.** The woman heard that Jesus was a teacher sent from God, and she
believed that he had power to heal her son.  
**15.** And so she clasped the dying infant in her arms and ran with
haste and asked to see the man of God.  
**16.** When Jesus saw her faith he lifted up his eyes to heaven and
said,  
**17.** My Father-God, let power divine o'ershadow me, and let the Holy
Breath fill full this child that it may live.  
**18.** And in the presence of the multitude he laid his hand upon the
child and said,  
**19.** Good woman you are blest; your faith has saved your son. And
then the child was well.  
**20.** The people were astonished and they said, This surely is the
Holy One made flesh, for man alone cannot a fever thus and save a child
from death.  
**21.** Then many of the people brought their sick, and Jesus spoke the
Word, and they were healed.  
**22.** Among the Ladaks Jesus tarried many days; he taught them how to
heal; how sins are blotted out, and how to make on earth a heaven of
joy.  
**23.** The people loved him for his words and works, and when he must
depart they grieved as children grieve when mother goes away.  
**24.** And on the morning when he started on his way the multitudes
were there to press his hand.  
**25.** To them he spoke a parable; he said, A certain king so loved the
people of his land that he sent forth his only son with precious gifts
for all.  
**26.** The son went everywhere and scattered forth the gifts with
lavish hand.  
**27.** But there were priests who ministered at shrines of foreign
gods, who were not pleased because the king did not through them bestow
the gifts.  
**28.** And so they sought to cause the people all to hate the son. They
said, These gifts are not of any worth; they are but counterfeits.  
**29.** And so the people threw the precious gems, and gold and silver
in the streets. They caught the son and beat him, spit upon him, drove
him from their midst.  
**30.** The son resented not their insults and their cruelties; but thus
he prayed, My Father-God, forgive these creatures of thy hand; they are
but slaves; they know not what they do.  
**31.** And while they yet were beating him he gave them food, and blest
them with a boundless love.  
**32.** In certain cities was the son received with joy, and he would
gladly have remained to bless the homes; but he could tarry not, for he
must carry gifts to every one in all the king's domain.  
**33.** And Jesus said, My Father-God is king of all mankind, and he has
sent me forth with all the bounties of his matchless love and boundless
wealth.  
**34.** To all the people of all lands, lo, I must bear these
gifts--this water and this bread of life.  
**35.** I go my way, but we will meet again; for in my Fatherland is
room for all; I will prepare a place for you.  
**36.** And Jesus raised his hand in silent benediction; then he went
his way.
