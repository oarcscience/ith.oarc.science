#### Chapter 3

Birth of Jesus. Masters honour the child. The shepherds rejoice.
Zacharias and Elizabeth visit Mary. Jesus is circumcised.  
  
**1.** The time was nearly due for Jesus to be born, and Mary longed to
see Elizabeth, and she and Joseph turned their faces toward the Judean
hills.  
**2.** And when upon their way they came to Bethlehem the day was done,
and they must tarry for the night.  
**3.** But Bethlehem was thronged with people going to Jerusalem; the
inns and homes were filled with guests, and Joseph and his wife could
find no place to rest but in a cave where animals were kept; and there
they slept.  
**4.** At midnight came a cry, a child is born in yonder cave among the
beasts. And lo, the promised son of man was born.  
**5.** And strangers took the little one and wrapped him in the dainty
robes that Mary had prepared and laid him in a trough from which the
beasts of burden fed.  
**6.** Three persons clad in snow-white robes came in and stood before
the child and said,  
**7.** All strength, all wisdom and all love be your, Immanuel.  
**8.** Now, on the hills of Bethehem were many flocks of sheep with
shepherds guarding them.  
**9.** The shepherds were devout, were men of prayer, and they were
waiting for a strong deliverer to come.  
**10.** And when the child of promise came, a man in snow-white robe
appeared to them, and they fell back in fear. The man stood forth and
said,  
**11.** Fear not! behold I bring you joyful news. At midnight in a cave
in Bethehem was born the prophet and the king that you have long been
waiting for.  
**12.** And then the shepherds all were glad; they felt that all the
hills were filled with messengers of light, who said,  
**13.** All glory be to God on high; peace, peace on earth, good will to
men.  
**14.** And then the shepherds came with haste to Bethlehem and to the
cave, that they might see and honour him whom men had called Immanuel.  
**15.** Now, when the morning came, a shepherdess whose home was near,
prepared a room for Mary, Joseph and the child; and here they tarried
many days.  
**16.** And Joseph sent a messenger in haste to Zacharias and Elizabeth
to say, The child is born in Bethlehem.  
**17.** And Zacharias and Elizabeth took John and came to Bethlehem with
words of cheer.  
**18.** And Mary and Elizabeth recounted all the wonderous things that
had transpired. The people joined with them in praising God.  
**19.** According to the custom of the Jews, the child was circumcised;
and when they asked, What will you call the child? the mother said, His
name is Jesus, as the man of God declared.
