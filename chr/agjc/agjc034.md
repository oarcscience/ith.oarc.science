#### Chapter 31

Brahmic priests are enraged because of Jesus' teaching and resolve to
drive him from India. Lamaas pleads for him. Priests employ a murderer
to kill him. Lamaas warns him and he flees to Nepel.  
  
**1.** The words and works of Jesus caused unrest through all the
land.  
**2.** The common people were his friends, believed in him and followed
him in thongs.  
**3.** The priests and rulers were afraid of him, his very name sent
terror to their hearts.  
**4.** He preached the brotherhood of life, the righteousness of equal
rights, and taught the uselessness of priests, and sacrificial rites.  
**5.** He shook the very sand on which the Brahmic system stood; he made
the Brahmic idols seem so small, and sacrifice so fraught with sin, that
shrines and wheels of prayer were all forgot.  
**6.** The priests declared that if this Jewish boy should tarry longer
in the land a revolution would occur; the common people would arise and
kill the priests, and tear the temples down.  
**7.** And so they sent a call abroad, and priests from every province
came. Benares was on fire with Brahmic zeal.  
**8.** Lamaas from the temple Jagannath, who knew the inner life of
Jesus well, was in their midst, and heard the rantings of the priests,  
**9.** And he stood forth and said, My brother priests, take heed, be
careful what you do; this is a record-making day.  
**10.** The world is looking on; the very life of Brahmic thought is now
on trial.  
**11.** If we are reason-blind; if prejudice be king to-day; if we
resort to beastly force, and dye our hands in blood that may, in sight
of Brahm, be innocent and pure,  
**12.** His vengeance may fall down on us; the very rock on which we
stand may burst beneath our feet; and our beloved priesthood, and our
laws and shrines will go into decay.  
**13.** But they would let him speak no more. The wrathful priests
rushed up and beat him, spit upon him, called him traitor, threw him,
bleeding, to the street.  
**14.** And then confusion reigned; the priests became a mob; the sight
of human blood led on to fiendish acts and called for more.  
**15.** The rulers, fearing war, sought Jesus, and they found him calmly
teaching in the market place.  
**16.** They urged him to depart, that he might save his life; but he
refused to go.  
**17.** And then the priests sought cause for his arrest; but he had
done no crime.  
**18.** And then false charges were preferred; but when the soldiers
went to bring him to the judgement hall they were afraid, because the
people stood in his defence.  
**19.** The priests were baffled, and they resolved to take his life by
stealth.  
**20.** They found a man who was a murderer by trade, and sent him out
by night to slay the object of their wrath.  
**21.** Lamaas heard about their plotting and their plans, and sent a
messenger to warn his friend; and Jesus hastened to depart.  
**22.** By night he left Benares, and with haste he journeyed to the
north; and everywhere, the farmers, merchants and sudras helped him on
his way.  
**23.** And after many days he reached the mighty Himalayas, and in the
city of Kapivastu he abode.  
**24.** The priests of Buddha opened wide their temple doors for him.
