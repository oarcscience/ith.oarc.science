#### Chapter 85

John, the harbinger, censures Herod for his wickedness. Herod sends him
to prison in Machaerus. Jesus tells why God permitted the imprisonment
of John.  
  
**1.** Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Paraca and of Galilee was
dissipated, selfish and tyrannical.  
**2.** He drove his wife away from home that he might take as wife
Herodias, the wife of one, a near of kin, a woman, like himself, immoral
and unjust.  
**3.** The city of Tiberius, upon the shores of Galilee, was Herod's
home.  
**4.** Now John, the harbinger, had left the Salim Springs to teach the
people by the sea of Galilee; and he rebuked the wicked ruler and his
stolen wife for all their sins.  
**5.** Herodias was enraged because the preacher dared accuse her and
her husband of their crimes;  
**6.** And she prevailed on Herod to arrest the harbinger and cast him
in a dungeon in the castle of Machaerus that stood beside the Bitter
Sea.  
**7.** And Herod did as she required; then she lived in peace in all her
sins, for none were bold enough to censure her again.  
**8.** The followers of John were warned to speak not of the trial and
imprisonment of John.  
**9.** By order of the court, they were restrained from teaching in the
public halls.  
**10.** They could not talk about this better life that Herod called the
Heresy of John.  
**11.** When it was known that John had been imprisoned by the tetrarch
court, the friends of Jesus thought it best that he should not remain in
Galilee.  
**12.** But Jesus said, I have no need of fear; my time has not yet
come; no man can stay me till my work is done.  
**13.** And when they asked why God permitted Herod to imprison John, he
said,  
**14.** Behold yon stalk of grain to perfectness, it is of no more
worth; it falls, becoming part of earth again from which it came.  
**15.** John is a stalk of golden wheat; he brought unto maturity the
richest grain of all the earth; his work is done.  
**16.** If he had said another word it might have marred the symmetry of
what is now a noble life.  
**17.** And when my work is done the rulers will do unto me what they
have done to John, and more.  
**18.** All these events are part of God's own plan. The innocent will
suffer while the wicked are in power; but woe to them who cause the
suffering of the innocents.
