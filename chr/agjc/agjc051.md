#### Chapter 48

Jesus receives from the hierophant his mystic name and number. Passes
the first brotherhood test, and receives his first degree, SINCERITY.  
  
**1.** The master took down from the wall a scroll on which was written
down the number and the name of every attribute and character. He
said,  
**2.** The circle is the symbol of the perfect man, and seven is the
number of the perfect man;  
**3.** The Logos is the perfect word; that which creates; that which
destroys, and that which saves.  
**4.** This Hebrew master is the Logos of the Holy One, the Circle of
the human race, the Seven of time.  
**5.** And in the record book the scribe wrote down, The
Logos-Circle-Seven; and thus was Jesus known.  
**6.** The master said, The Logos will give heed to what I say: No man
can enter into light till he has found himself. Go forth and search till
you have found your soul and then return.  
**7.** The guide led Jesus to a room in which the light was faint and
mellow, like the light of early dawn.  
**8.** The chamber walls were marked with mystic signs, with hieroglyphs
and sacred texts; and in this chamber Jesus found himself alone where he
remained for many days.  
**9.** He read the sacred texts; thought out the meaning of the
hieroglyphs and sought the import of the master's charge to find
himself.  
**10.** A revelation came; he got acquainted with his soul; he found
himself; then he was not alone.  
**11.** One night he slept and at the midnight hour, a door that he had
not observed, was opened, and a priest in sombre garb came in and
said,  
**12.** My brother, pardon me for coming in at this unseemly hour; but I
have come to save your life.  
**13.** You are the victim of a cruel plot. The priests of Heliopolis
are jealous of your fame, and they have said that you shall never leave
these gloomy crypts alive.  
**14.** The higher priests do not go forth to teach the world, and you
are doomed to temple servitude.  
**15.** Now, if you would be free, you must deceive these priests; must
tell them you are here to stay for life;  
**16.** And then, when you have gained all that you wish to gain, I will
return, and by a secret way will lead you forth that you may go in
peace.  
**17.** And Jesus said, My brother man, would you come here to teach
deceit? Am I within these holy walls to learn the wiles of vile
hypocrisy?  
**18.** Nay, man, my Father scorns deceit, and I am here to do his
will.  
**19.** Deceive these priests! Not while the sun shall shine. What I
have said, that I have said; I will be true to them, to God, and to
myself.  
**20.** And then the tempter left, and Jesus was again alone; but in a
little time a white- robed priest appeared and said,  
**21.** Well done! The Logos has prevailed. This is the trial chamber of
hypocrisy. And then he led the way, and Jesus stood before the judgement
seat.  
**22.** And all the brothers stood; the hierophant came forth and laid
his hand on Jesus' head, and placed within his hands a scroll, on which
was written just one word, SINCERITY; and not a word was said.  
**23.** The guide again appeared, and led the way, and in a spacious
room replete with everything a student craves was Jesus bade to rest and
wait.
