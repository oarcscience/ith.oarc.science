#### Chapter 93

The Christines go through a field of ripe wheat, and the disciples eat
of the wheat. Jesus exonerates them. The Christines return to Capernaum.
Jesus heals a withered hand on the Sabbath, and defends his deed.  
  
**1.** Another Sabbath day had come and Jesus and the twelve walked
through a field of ripened wheat.  
**2.** And they were hungry and they took the heads of wheat and in
their hands threshed out the grain and ate.  
**3.** Among the men who followed them were Pharisees of strictest sect,
and when they saw the twelve thresh out the wheat and eat, they said to
Jesus,  
**4.** Sir, why do the twelve do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath
day?  
**5.** And Jesus said, Have you not heard what David did when he and
those who followed him had need of food?  
**6.** How he went to the house of God and from the table in the Holy
Place took of the presence bread and ate, and gave to those who followed
him?  
**7.** I tell you, men, the needs of man are higher than the law of
rites.  
**8.** And in our sacred books we read how priests profane the Sabbath
day in many ways while they are serving in the Holy Place, and still are
free from guilt.  
**9.** The Sabbath day was made for man; man was not made to fit the
Sabbath day.  
**10.** The man is son of God and under the eternal law of right, which
is the highest law, he may annul the statute laws.  
**11.** The law of sacrifice is but the law of man, and in our law we
read that God desires mercy first; and mercy stands above all statute
laws.  
**12.** The son of man is Lord of every law. Did not a prophet sum the
duties of the man when in the book he wrote: In mercy follow justice and
walk humbly with your God?  
**13.** Then Jesus and the twelve returned to Galilee, and on the day
before the Sabbath day they reached the home of Jesus in Capernaum.  
**14.** And on the Sabbath day they went up to the synagogue. The
multitudes were there and Jesus taught.  
**15.** Among the worshippers was one, a man who had a withered hand.
The scribes and Pharisees observed that Jesus saw the man, and then they
said,  
**16.** What will he do? Will he attempt to heal upon the Sabbath day?  
**17.** And Jesus knew their thoughts and he called to the man who had
the withered hand and said, Arise, stand forth before these men.  
**18.** And Jesus said, You scribes and Pharisees, speak out and answer
me: Is it a crime to save a life upon the Sabbath day?  
**19.** If you had sheep and one of them fell in a pit upon the Sabbath
day would you do wrong to take it out?  
**20.** Or would it please your God to let it suffer in the mire until
another day?  
**21.** But his accusers held their peace.  
**22.** And then he said to them, Are sheep of greater value than a
man?  
**23.** The law of God is written on the rock of Right; and Justice
wrote the law, and Mercy was the pen.  
**24.** And then he said, Man, raise your hand and stretch it forth. He
raised his hand; it was restored.  
**25.** The Pharisees were filled with rage. They called in secret
council the Herodians, and they began to plot and plan how they might
bring about his death.  
**26.** They were afraid to publicly accuse, because the multitudes
stood forth in his defence.  
**27.** And Jesus and the twelve went down and walked beside the sea,
and many people followed them.
