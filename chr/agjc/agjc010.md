#### SECTION III  GIMEL  Education of Mary and Elizabeth in Zoan

#### Chapter 7

Archelaus reigns. Mary and Elizabeth with their sons are in Zoan and are
taught by Elihu and Salome. Elihu's introductory lesson. Tells of an
interpreter.  
  
**1.** The son of Herod, Archelaus, reigned in Jerusalem. He was a
selfish, cruel king; he put to death all those who did not honour him.  
**2.** He called in council all the wisest men and asked about the
infant claimant to his throne.  
**3.** The council said that John and Jesus both were dead; then he was
satisfied.  
**4.** Now Joseph, Mary and their sons were down in Egypt in Zoan, and
John was with his mother in the Judean Hills.  
**5.** Elihu and Salome sent messengers in haste to find Elizabeth and
John. They found them and they brought them to Zoan.  
**6.** Now, Mary and Elizabeth were marvelling much because of their
deliverance.  
**7.** Elihu said, It is not strange; there are no happenings; law
governs all events.  
**8.** From olden times it was ordained that you should be with us, and
in this sacred school be taught.  
**9.** Elihu and Salome took Mary and Elizabeth out to the sacred grove
near by where they were wont to teach.  
**10.** Elihu said to Mary and Elizabeth, You may esteem yourself thrice
blest, for you are chosen mothers of long promised sons,  
**11.** Who are ordained to lay in solid rock a sure foundation stone on
which the temple of the perfect man shall rest--a temple that shall
never be destroyed.  
**12.** We measure time by cycle ages, and the gate to every age we deem
a mile stone in the journey of the race.  
**13.** An age has passed; the gate unto another age flies open at the
touch of time. This is the preparation age of soul, the kingdom of
Immanuel, of God in man;  
**14.** And these, your sons, will be the first to tell the news, and
preach the gospel of good will to men, and peace on earth.  
**15.** A mighty work is theirs; for carnal men want not the light, they
love the dark, and when the light shines in the dark they comprehend it
not.  
**16.** We call these sons, Revealers of the Light; but they must have
the light before they can reveal the light.  
**17.** And you must teach your sons, and set their souls on fire with
love and holy zeal, and make them conscious of their missions to the
sons of men.  
**18.** Teach them that God and man are one; but that through carnal
thoughts and words and deeds, man tore himself away from God; debased
himself.  
**19.** Teach that the Holy Breath would make them one again, restoring
harmony and peace;  
**20.** That naught can make them one but Love; that God so loved the
world that he has clothed his son in flesh that man may comprehend.  
**21.** The only Saviour of the world is love, and Jesus, son of Mary,
comes to manifest that love to men.  
**22.** Now, love cannot manifest until its way has been prepared, and
naught can rend the rocks and bring down lofty hills and fill the
valleys up, and thus prepare the way, but purity.  
**23.** But purity in life men do not comprehend; and so, it, too, come
in flesh.  
**24.** And you, Elizabeth, are blest because your son is purity made
flesh, and he shall pave the way for love.  
**25.** This age will comprehend but little of the works of Purity and
Love; but not a word is lost, for in the Book of God's Remembrance a
registry is made of every thought, and word, and deed;  
**26.** And when the world is ready to receive, lo, God will sent a
messenger to open up the book and copy from its sacred pages all the
messages of Purity and Love.  
**27.** Then every man of earth will read the words of life in language
of his native land, and men will see the light, walk in the light and be
the light.  
**28.** And man again will be at one with God.
