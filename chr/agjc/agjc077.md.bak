#### Chapter 74

Jesus heals on the Sabbath, and is censured by the Pharisees. Restores a
drowned child. Rescued a wounded dog. Cares for a homeless child. Speaks
on the law of kindness.  
  
**1.** It was the Sabbath day, and Jesus stood among the surging masses
of the people in the temple courts and sacred halls.  
**2.** The blind, the deaf, the dumb, and those obsessed were there, and
Jesus spoke the Word, and they were healed.  
**3.** On some he laid his hands, and they were healed; to others he
just spoke the Word, and they were full restored to health; but others
had to go and wash in certain pools; and others he anointed with a holy
oil.  
**4.** A doctor asked him why he healed in divers ways, and he
replied,  
**5.** Disease is discord in the human form, and discords are produced
in many ways.  
**6.** The body is a harpsichord; sometimes the strings are too relaxed,
and then inharmony results.  
**7.** Sometimes we find the strings too tense, and then another form of
discord is induced.  
**8.** Disease is many-formed, and these are many ways to cure, to tune
anew the mystic harpsichord.  
**9.** Now when the Pharisees were told that Jesus healed the people on
the Sabbath day they were enraged, and they commanded him to quit the
place.  
**10.** But Jesus said, Was man designed to fit the Sabbath, or was the
Sabbath day designed to fit the man?  
**11.** If you had fallen in a pit and, lo, the Sabbath day had come,
and I should pass your way, would you cry out.  
**12.** Let me alone; it is a sin to help me on the Sabbath day; I'll
swelter in this filth until another day?  
**13.** You Pharisees, you hypocrites! you know you would be glad to
have my help upon the Sabbath day, or any other day.  
**14.** These people all have fallen into pits, and they are calling
loud for me to help them out, and man and God would curse me should I
pass along and heed them not.  
**15.** And then the Pharisees returned to say their prayers, and curse
the man of God because he heeded not their words.  
**16.** Now, in the evening Jesus stood beside a pool; a playful child
had fallen in, and it was drowned, and friends were bearing it away.  
**17.** But Jesus called the carriers to stop; and then he stretched
himself upon the lifeless form, and breathed into its mouth the breath
of life.  
**18.** And then he called aloud unto the soul that had gone out, and it
returned; the child revived and lived.  
**19.** And Jesus saw a wounded dog; it could not move; it lay beside
the way and groaned with pain. He took it in his arms and bore it to the
home where he abode.  
**20.** He poured the healing oil into the wounds; he cared for it as
though it were a child till it was strong and well.  
**21.** And Jesus saw a little boy who had no home, and he was hungry;
when he called for bread the people turned away.  
**22.** And Jesus took the child and gave him bread; he wrapped him in
his own warm coat, and found for him a home.  
**23.** To those who followed him the master said, If man would gain
again his lost estate he must respect the brotherhood of life.  
**24.** Whoever is not kind to every form of life--to man, to beast, to
bird, and creeping thing--cannot expect the blessings of the Holy One;
for as we give, so God will give to us.
