#### Chapter 52

Jesus spends forty days in the temple groves. Passes the fifth
brotherhood test and receives the fifth degree, HEROISM.  
  
**1.** The sacred temple groves were rich in statues, monuments and
shrines; here Jesus loved to walk and meditate.  
**2.** And after he had conquered self he talked with nature in these
groves for forty days.  
**3.** And then the guide took chains and bound him hand and foot; and
then cast him into a den of hungry beasts, of unclean birds, and
creeping things.  
**4.** The den was dark as night; the wild beasts howled; the birds in
fury screamed; the reptiles hissed.  
**5.** And Jesus said, Who was it that did bind me thus? Why did I
meekly sit to be bound down with chains?  
**6.** I tell you, none has power to bind a human soul. Of what are
fetters made?  
**7.** And in his might he rose, and what he thought were chains were
only worthless cords that parted at his touch.  
**8.** And then he laughed and said, The chains that bind men to the
carcasses of earth are forged in fancy's shop; are made of air, and
welded in illusion's fires.  
**9.** If man will stand erect, and use the power of will, his chains
will fall, like worthless rags; for will and faith are stronger than the
stoutest chains that men have ever made.  
**10.** And Jesus stood erect among the hungry beasts, and birds, and
said, What is this darkness that envelops me?  
**11.** 'Tis but the absence of the light. And what is light? 'Tis but
the breath of God vibrating in the rhythm of rapid thought.  
**12.** And then he said, Let there be light; and with a mighty will he
stirred the ethers up, and their vibrations reached the plane of light;
and there was light.  
**13.** The darkness of that den of night became the brightness of a
newborn day.  
**14.** And then he looked to see the beasts, and birds, and creeping
things; lo, they were not.  
**15.** And Jesus said, Of what are souls afraid? Fear is the chariot in
which man rides to death;  
**16.** And when he finds himself within the chamber of the dead, he
learns that he has been deceived; his chariot was a myth, and death a
fancy child.  
**17.** But some day all man's lessons will be learned, and from the den
of unclean beasts, and birds, and creeping things he will arise to walk
in light.  
**18.** And Jesus saw a ladder made of gold, on which he climbed, and at
the top the white-robed priest awaited him.  
**19.** Again he stood before the council bar; again no word was said;
again the hierophant reached forth his hand to bless.  
**20.** He placed in Jesus' hand another scroll, and on this one was
written, HEROISM.  
**21.** The Logos had encountered fear and all his phantom host, and in
the conflict he achieved the victory.
