#### Chapter 104

Jesus teaches the multitudes. Attends a feast in Simon's house. A
wealthy courtesan anoints him with precious balm. Simon rebukes him and
he preaches a sermon on false respectability.  
  
**1.** And Jesus looked upon the multitudes who pressed about for
selfish gain.  
**2.** The men of learning and of wealth, of reputation and of power,
were there; but they knew not the Christ.  
**3.** Their eyes were blinded by the tinselled glitter of their selfish
selves; they could not see the king.  
**4.** And though they walked within the light, they groped about in
dark--a darkness like the night of death.  
**5.** And Jesus cast his eyes to heaven and said,  
**6.** I thank thee, Holy One of heaven and earth, that while the light
is hidden from the wise and great, it is revealed to babes.  
**7.** Then turning to the multitudes he said, I come to you not in the
name of man, nor in a strength my own;  
**8.** The wisdom and the virtue that I bring to you are from above;
they are the wisdom and the virtue of the God whom we adore.  
**9.** The words I speak are not my words; I give to you what I
receive.  
**10.** Come unto me all you who labour and pull heavy loads and I will
give you aid.  
**11.** Put on the yoke of Christ with me; it does not chafe; it is an
easy yoke.  
**12.** Together we will pull the load of life with ease; and so
rejoice.  
**13.** A Pharisee, whose name was Simon, made a feast, and Jesus was
the honoured guest.  
**14.** And as they sat about the board, a courtesan who had been cured
of her desire to sin by what she had received and seen in Jesus'
ministry, came uninvited to the feast.  
**15.** She brought an alabaster box of costly balm and as the guests
reclined she came to Jesus in her joy, because she been freed from
sin.  
**16.** Her tears fell fast, she kissed his feet, and dried them with
her hair, and she anointed them with balm.  
**17.** And Simon thought, he did not speak aloud, This man is not a
prophet or he would know the kind of woman that approaches him, and
would drive her away.  
**18.** But Jesus knew his thoughts, and said to him, My host, I have a
word to say to you.  
**19.** And Simon said, Say on.  
**20.** And Jesus said, Sin is a monster of iniquity; it may be small;
it may be large; it may be something left undone.  
**21.** Behold, one person leads a life of sin and is at last redeemed;
another, in a careless mood, forgets to do the things he ought to do but
he reforms and is forgiven. Now, which of these has merited the higher
praise?  
**22.** And Simon said, The one who overcame the error of a life.  
**23.** And Jesus said, You speak the truth.  
**24.** Behold this woman who has bathed my feet with tears and dried
them with her hair and covered them with balm!  
**25.** For years she led a life of sin, but when she heard the words of
life she sought forgiveness and she found.  
**26.** But when I came into your house as guest you gave me not a bowl
of water that I might wash my hands and feet, which every loyal Jew must
do before he feasts.  
**27.** Now, tell me, Simon, which of these, this woman or yourself, is
worthy of most praise?  
**28.** But Simon answered not.  
**29.** Then to the woman Jesus said, Your sins are all forgiven; your
faith has saved you; go in peace.  
**30.** And then the guests who sat around the board, began to say
within themselves, What manner of a man is this who says, Thy sins are
all forgiven?
