#### Chapter 29

Ajainin, a priest from Lahore, comes to Benares to see Jesus, and abides
in the temple. Jesus refuses an invitation to visit the temple. Ajainin
visits him at night in the farmer's home, and accepts his philosophy.  
  
**1.** Among Benares' temple priests was one, a guest, Ajainan, from
Lahore.  
**2.** By merchantmen Ajainin heard about the Jewish boy, about his
words of wisdom, and he girt himself and journeyed from Lahore that he
might see the boy, and hear him speak.  
**3.** The Brahmic priests did not accept the truth that Jesus brought,
and they were angered much by what he said at the Udraka feast.  
**4.** But they had never seen the boy, and they desired much to hear
him speak, and they invited him to be a temple guest.  
**5.** But Jesus said to them, The light is most abundant, and it shines
for all; if you would see the light come to the light.  
**6.** If you would hear the message that the Holy One has given me to
give to men, come unto me.  
**7.** Now, when the priests were told what Jesus said they were
enraged.  
**8.** Ajainin did not share their wrath, and he sent forth another
messenger with costly gifts to Jesus at the farmer's home; he sent this
message with the gifts:  
**9.** I pray you master, listen to my words; The Brahmic law forbids
that any priest shall go into the home of any one of low estate; but you
can come to us;  
**10.** And I am sure these priests will gladly hear you speak. I pray
that you will come and dine with us this day.  
**11.** And Jesus said, The Holy One regards all men alike; the dwelling
of my host is good enough for any council of the sons of men.  
**12.** If pride of cast keeps you away, you are not worthy of the
light. My Father-God does not regard the laws of man.  
**13.** Your presents I return; you cannot buy the knowledge of the Lord
with gold, or precious gifts.  
**14.** These words of Jesus angered more and more the priests, and they
began to plot and plan how they might drive him from the land.  
**15.** Ajainin did not join with them in plot and plan; he left the
temple in the night, and sought the home where Jesus dwelt.  
**16.** And Jesus said, There is no night where shines the sun; I have
no secret messages to give; in light all secrets are revealed.  
**17.** Ajainin said, I came from far-away Lahore, that I might learn
about this ancient wisdom, and this kingdom of the Holy One of which you
speak.  
**18.** Where is the kingdom? where the king? Who are the subjects? what
its laws?  
**19.** And Jesus said, This kingdom is not far away, but man with
mortal eyes can see it not; it is within the heart.  
**20.** You need not seek the king in earth, or sea, or sky; he is not
there, and yet is everywhere. He is the Christ of God; is universal
love.  
**21.** The gate of this dominion is not high, and he who enters it must
fall down on his knees. It is not wide, and none can carry carnal
bundles through.  
**22.** The lower self must be transmuted into spirit-self; the body
must be washed in living streams of purity.  
**23.** Ajainin asked, Can I become a subject of this king?  
**24.** And Jesus said, You are yourself a king, and you may enter
through the gate and be a subject of the King of kings.  
**25.** But you must lay aside your priestly robes; must cease to serve
the Holy One for gold; must give your life, and all you have, in willing
service to the sons of men.  
**26.** And Jesus said no more; Ajainin went his way; and while he could
not comprehend the truth that Jesus spoke, he saw what he had never seen
before.  
**27.** The realm of faith he never had explored; but in his heart the
seeds of faith and universal brotherhood had found good soil.  
**28.** And as he journeyed to his home he seemed to sleep, to pass
through darkest night, and when he woke the Sun of Righteousness had
arisen; he had found the king.  
**29.** Now, in Benares Jesus tarried many days and taught.
