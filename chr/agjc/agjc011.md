#### Chapter 8

Elihu's lessons. The unity of life. The two selfs. The devil. Love the
saviour of men. The David of the light. Goliath of the dark.  
  
**1.** Again Elihu met his pupils in the sacred grove and said,  
**2.** No man lives unto himself; for every living thing is bound by
cords to every other living thing.  
**3.** Blest are the pure in heart; for they will love and not demand
love in return.  
**4.** They will not do to other men what they would not have other men
do unto them.  
**5.** There are two selfs; the higher and the lower self.  
**6.** The higher self is human spirit clothed with soul, made in the
form of God.  
**7.** The lower self, the carnal self, the body of desires, is a
reflection of the higher self, distorted by the murky ethers of the
flesh.  
**8.** The lower self is an illusion, and will pass away; the higher
self is God in man, and will not pass away.  
**9.** The higher self is the embodiment of truth reversed, and so is
falsehood manifest.  
**10.** The higher self is justice, mercy, love and right; the lower
self is what the higher self is not.  
**11.** The lower self breeds hatred, slander, lewdness, murders, theft,
and everything that harms; the higher self is mother of the virtues and
the harmonies of life.  
**12.** The lower self is rich in promises, but poor in blessedness and
peace; it offers pleasure, joy and satisfying gains; but gives unrest
and misery and death.  
**13.** It gives men apples that are lovely to the eye and pleasant to
the smell; their cores are full of bitterness and gall.  
**14.** If you would ask me what to study I would say, yourselves; and
when you will have studied them, and then would ask me what to study
next, I would reply, yourselves.  
**15.** He who knows well his lower self, knows the illusions of the
world, knows of the things that pass away; and he who knows his higher
self, know God; knows well the things that cannot pass away.  
**16.** Thrice blessed is the man who has made purity and love his very
own; he has been ransomed from the perils of the lower self and is
himself his higher self.  
**17.** Men seek salvation from an evil that they deem a living monster
of the nether world; and they have gods that are but demons in disguise;
all powerful, yet full of jealousy and hate and lust;  
**18.** Whose favours must be bought with costly sacrifice of fruits,
and of the lives of birds, and animals, and human kind.  
**19.** And yet these gods possess no ears to hear, no eyes to see, no
heart to sympathise, no power to save.  
**20.** This evil is myth; these gods are made of air, clothed with
shadows of a thought.  
**21.** The only devil from which men must be redeemed is self, the
lower self. If man would find his devil he must look within; his name is
self.  
**22.** If man would find his saviour he must look within; and when the
demon self has been dethroned the saviour, Love, will be exulted to the
throne of power.  
**23.** The David of the light is Purity, who slays the strong Goliath
of the dark, and seats the saviour, Love, upon the throne.
