#### SECTION X  JOD  Life and Works of Jesus in Greece

#### Chapter 44

Jesus visits Greece and is welcomed by the Athenians. Meets Apollo.
Addresses the Grecian masters in the Amphitheatre. The address.  
  
**1.** The Greek philosophy was full of pungent truth, and Jesus longed
to study with the masters in the schools of Greece.  
**2.** And so he left his home in Nazareth and crossed the Carmel hills,
and at the port took ship, and soon was in the Grecian capital.  
**3.** Now, the Athenians had heard of him as teacher and philosopher,
and they were glad to have him come to them that they might hear his
words of truth.  
**4.** Among the masters of the Greeks was one, Apollo, who was called,
Defender of the Oracle, and recognised in many lands as Grecian sage.  
**5.** Apollo opened up for Jesus all the doors of Grecian lore, and in
the Areopagus he heard the wisest masters speak.  
**6.** But Jesus brought to them a wisdom greater far than theirs; and
so he taught.  
**7.** Once in the Amphitheatre he stood, and when Apollo bade him speak
he said,  
**8.** Athenian masters, hear! In ages long ago, men, wise in nature's
laws, sought out and found the place on which your city stands.  
**9.** Full well you know that there are parts of earth where its great
beating heart throws heavenward etheric waves that meet the ethers from
above:  
**10.** Where spirit-light and understanding, like the stars of night,
shine forth.  
**11.** Of all the parts of earth there is no place more sensitised,
more truly spirit-blest, than that where Athens stands.  
**12.** Yea, all of Greece is blest. No other land has been the homeland
of such mighty men of thought as grace your scrolls of fame.  
**13.** A host of sturdy giants of philosophy, of poetry, of science,
and of art, were born upon the soil of Greece, and rocked to manhood in
your cradle of pure thought.  
**14.** I come not here to speak of science, of philosophy, or art; of
these you are the world's best masters now.  
**15.** But all your high accomplishments are but stepping stones to
worlds beyond the realm of sense; are but illusive shadows flitting on
the walls of time.  
**16.** But I would tell you of a life beyond, within; a real life that
cannot pass away.  
**17.** In science and philosophy there is no power strong enough to fit
a soul to recognise itself, or to commune with God.  
**18.** I would not stay the flow of your great streams of thought; but
I would turn them to the channels of the soul.  
**19.** Unaided by the Spirit-breath, the work of intellection tends to
solve the problems of the things we see, and nothing more.  
**20.** The senses were ordained to bring into the mind mere pictures of
the things that pass away; they do not deal with real things; they do
not comprehend eternal law.  
**21.** But man has something in his soul, a something that will tear
the veil apart that he may see the world of real things.  
**22.** We call this something, spirit consciousness; it sleeps in every
soul, and cannot be awakened till the Holy Breath becomes a welcome
guest.  
**23.** This Holy Breath knocks at the door of every soul, but cannot
enter in until the will of man throws wide the door.  
**24.** There is no power in intellect to turn the key; philosophy and
science both have toiled to get a glimpse behind the veil; but they have
failed.  
**25.** The secret spring that throws ajar the door of soul is touched
by nothing else than purity in life, by prayer and holy thought.  
**26.** Return, O mystic stream of Grecian thought, and mingle your
clear waters with the flood of Spirit-life; and then the spirit
consciousness will sleep no more, and man will know, and God will
bless.  
**27.** When Jesus had thus said he stepped aside. The Grecian masters
were astonished at the wisdom of his words; they answered not.
