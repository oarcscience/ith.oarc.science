#### Chapter 145

Jesus speaks on the establishment of the Christine kingdom and the
future coming of the Lord in power. Exhorts to faithfulness. Parable of
the unjust judge. Parable of the Pharisee and the publican.  
  
**1.** A company of Pharisees came up to speak with Jesus and they said,
Rabboni, we have heard you say, The kingdom is at hand.  
**2.** We read in Daniel that the God of heaven will form a kingdom, and
we ask, Is this the kingdom of the God you speak about? If so, when will
it come?  
**3.** And Jesus said, The prophets all have told about this kingdom of
the God, and it is just at hand; but men can never see it come.  
**4.** It never can be seen with carnal eyes; it is within.  
**5.** Lo, I have said, and now I say again, None but the pure in heart
can see the king, and all the pure in heart are subjects of the king.  
**6.** Reform, and turn away form sin; prepare you, O prepare! the
kingdom is at hand.  
**7.** And then he spoke to his disciples and he said, The seasons of
the son of man are past.  
**8.** The time will come when you will wish above all else to see again
one of these days; but you can see it not.  
**9.** And many men will say, Lo, here is Christ; lo, there is Christ.
Be not deceived; go not into their ways.  
**10.** For when the son of man will come again no man need point the
way; for as the lightning lights the heavens, so will the son of man
light up the heavens and earth.  
**11.** But, lo, I say, that many generations will have come and gone
before the son of man shall come in power; but when he comes no one will
say, Lo, here is Christ; lo, there.  
**12.** But as it was before the flood in Noah's day, so shall it be.
The people ate, they drank,were filled with merriment and sang for
joy,  
**13.** And did not know their doom until the ark was done and Noah
entered in; but then the flood came on and swept them all away.  
**14.** So, also, in the days of Lot; the people ate and drank; they
bought, they sold, they planted and they reaped, they went their ways in
sin, and they cared not;  
**15.** But when the righteous Lot went from their city's gates the
earth beneath the city shook, and brimstone fires fell from heaven;  
**16.** The gapping jaws of earth flew wide, and swallowed up their
homes, their wealth, and they went down to rise no more.  
**17.** So shall it be when comes the son of man in power.  
**18.** I charge you men, as I will charge men then, Seek not to save
your wealth, or you will lose your lives. Go forth, and look not back
upon the crumbling walls of sin. Do not forget Lot's wife.  
**19.** Whoever tries to save his life will lose his life; whoever
freely gives his life in serving life will save his life.  
**20.** Then comes the sifting time. Two men will be in bed; one will be
called, the other left; two women will be working side by side; one will
be snatched away, the other left.  
**21.** And his disciples said, Explain to us this parable; or is it not
a parable?  
**22.** And Jesus said, The wise will understand, for where the bread of
heaven is, there you will find the pure in heart; and where the carcass
lies will gather all the birds of prey.  
**23.** But lo, I say, before these days will come, the son of man will
be betrayed by one of you into the hands of wicked men, and he will give
his life for you and all the world.  
**24.** Yea, more; the Holy Breath will come in power and fill you with
the wisdom of the just.  
**25.** And you will tell the wondrous story in Judea and in Samaria and
in the farther lands of earth.  
**26.** And then to teach that men should pray and never faint, he told
this parable:  
**27.** There was a judge who feared not God, nor yet regarded man.  
**28.** There was a widow who oft implored the judge to right her wrongs
and to avenge her foes.  
**29.** At first the judge would hear her not, but after many days he
said,  
**30.** I fear not God, and I regard not man, yet, lest this widow wear
me out by pleading every day I will avenge her on her foes.  
**31.** When the disciples asked the meaning of this parable, the Lord
replied, The wise can understand; the foolish have no need to know.  
**32.** And then to teach a lesson unto certain of his followers who
trusted in themselves and thought that they were holier than other men,
he told this parable:  
**33.** Two men went to the synagogue to pray; one was a Pharisee, the
other was a publican.  
**34.** The Pharisee stood forth and prayed thus with himself, O God, I
thank thee that I am not like other men, who are extortioners, unjust,
adulterers;  
**35.** Not even like this publican. I fast two times a week, and I give
tithes of all I get.  
**36.** The publican came not a-near; he would not lift his eyes to
heaven, but smote his breast and said,  
**37.** O lord, be merciful to me; I am a sinner in thy sight; I am
undone.  
**38.** And now, you men, I say to you, The publican knew how to pray,
and he was justified.  
**39.** The Pharisee knew how to talk, but still he went away
condemned.  
**40.** Lo, every one who lauds himself shall be abased, and he who does
not praise himself shall be exalted in the sight of God.
