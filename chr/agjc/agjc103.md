#### Chapter 100

The Sermon on the Mount, continued. Jesus formulates and presents to the
twelve a practical code of spiritual ethics.  
  
**1.** There is a rule that carnal man has made, and which he rigidly
observes:  
**2.** Do unto other men as they do unto you. As others judge, they
judge; as others give, they give.  
**3.** Now, while you walk with men as men, judge not, and you shall not
be judged.  
**4.** For as you judge you shall be judged, and as you give it shall be
given to you. If you condemn, you are condemned.  
**5.** When you show mercy, men are merciful to you, and if you love in
such a way that carnal man can comprehend your love, you will be well
beloved.  
**6.** And so the wise man of this world does unto other men as he would
have them do to him.  
**7.** The carnal man does good to other men for selfish gain, for he
expects to have his blessings multiplied and then returned; he does not
stop to note the end.  
**8.** Man is himself the field; his deeds are seeds, and what he does
to others grows apace; the harvest time is sure.  
**9.** Behold the yield! If he has sown the wind, he reaps the wind; if
he has sown the noxious seeds of scandal, theft and hate; of sensuality
and crime,  
**10.** The harvest is assured and he must reap what he has sown; yea,
more; the seeds produce an hundred fold.  
**11.** The fruit of righteousness and peace and love and joy can never
spring from noxious seeds; the fruit is like the seed.  
**12.** And when you sow, sow seeds of right, because it is the right,
and not in the way of trade, expecting rich rewards.  
**13.** The carnal man abhors the spirit law, because it takes away his
liberty to live in sin; beneath its light he cannot satisfy his passions
and desires.  
**14.** He is at enmity with him who walks in Holy Breath. The carnal
man has killed the holy men of old, the prophets and the seers.  
**15.** And he will buffet you; will charge you falsely, scourge you and
imprison you, and think he does the will of God to slay you in the
streets.  
**16.** But you may not prejudge nor censure him who does you wrong.  
**17.** Each one has problems to be solved, and he must solve them for
himself.  
**18.** The man who scourges you may have a load of sin to bear; but how
about your own?  
**19.** A little sin in one who walks in Holy Breath is greater in the
sight of God than monster sins in him who never knew the way.  
**20.** How can you see the splinter in your brother's eye while you
have chunks within your own?  
**21.** First take the chunks from out your eye and then you may behold
the splinter in your brother's eye and help him take it out,  
**22.** And while your eyes are full of foreign things you cannot see
the way, for you are blind,  
**23.** And when the blind lead forth the blind, both lose the way and
fall into the slough.  
**24.** If you would lead the way to God you must be clear in sight, as
well as pure in heart.
