#### Chapter 39

Jesus attends a feast in Persepolis. Speaks to the people, reviewing the
magian philosophy. Explains the origin of evil. Spends the night in
prayer.  
  
**1.** A feast in honour of the magian God was being held, and many men
were gathered in Persepolis.  
**2.** And on the great day of the feast the ruling magian master said,
Within these sacred walls is liberty; whoever wills to speak may
speak.  
**3.** And Jesus standing in the midst of all the people, said, My
brothers, sisters, children of our Father-God:  
**4.** Most blest are you among the sons of men today, because you have
such just conceptions of the Holy One and man.  
**5.** Your purity in worship and in life is pleasing unto God; and to
your master, Zarathustra, praise is due.  
**6.** Well say you all, There is one God from whose great being there
came forth the seven Spirits that created heaven and earth; and manifest
unto the sons of men are these great Spirits in the sun, and moon, and
stars.  
**7.** But in your sacred books we read that two among these seven are
of superior strength; that one of these created all the good; the other
one created all that evil is.  
**8.** I pray you, honoured masters, tell me how that evil can be born
of that which is all good?  
**9.** A magus rose and said, If you will answer me, your problem will
be solved.  
**10.** We all do recognize the fact that evil is. Whatever is, must
have a cause, If God, the One, made not this evil, then, where is the
God who did?  
**11.** And Jesus said, Whatever God, the One, has made is good, and
like the great first Cause, the seven Spirits all are good, and
everthing that comes from their creative hands is good.  
**12.** Now, all created things have colours, tones and forms their own;
but certain tones, though good and pure themselves, when mixed, produce
inharmonies, discordant tones.  
**13.** And certain things, though good and pure, when mixed, produce
discordant things, yea, poisonous things, that men call evil things.  
**14.** So evil is the inharmonious blending of the colours, tones, or
forms of good.  
**15.** Now, man is not all-wise, and yet has will his own. He has the
power, and he uses it, to mix God's good things in a multitude of ways,
and every day he makes discordant sounds, and evil things.  
**16.** And every tone and form, be it of good, or ill, becomes a living
thing, a demon, sprite, or spirit of a good or vicious kind.  
**17.** Man makes his evil thus; and then becomes afraid of him and
flees; his devil is emboldened, follows him away and casts him into
torturing fires.  
**18.** The devil and the burning fires are both the works of man, and
none can put the fires out and dissipate the evil one, but man who made
them both.  
**19.** Then Jesus stood aside, and not a magus answered him.  
**20.** And he departed from the throng and went into a secret place to
pray.
