#### Chapter 50

Jesus passes the third brotherhood test, and receives the third degree,
FAITH.  
  
**1.** The Logos waited seven days, and then was taken to the Hall of
Fame, a chamber rich in furnishings, and lighted up with gold and silver
lamps.  
**2.** The colours of its ceilings, decorations, furnishings and walls
were blue and gold.  
**3.** Its shelves were filled with books of master minds; the paintings
and the statues were the works of highest art.  
**4.** And Jesus was entranced with all this elegance and these
manifests of thought. He read the sacred books, and sought the meanings
of the symbols and the hieroglyphs.  
**5.** And when he was absorbed in deepest thought, a priest approached
and said,  
**6.** Behold the glory of this place: my brother, you are highly blest.
Few men of earth, so young, have reached such heights of fame.  
**7.** Now, if you do not waste your life in search for hidden things
that men can never comprehend, you may be founder of a school of thought
that will insure you endless fame;  
**8.** For your philosophy is deeper far than that of Plato, and your
teachings please the common people more than those of Socrates.  
**9.** Why seek for mystic light within these antiquated dens? Go forth
and walk with men, and think with men, and they will honour you.  
**10.** And, after all, these weird initiations may be myths, and your
Messiah hopes but base illusions of the hour.  
**11.** I would advise you to renounce uncertain things and choose the
course that leads to certain fame.  
**12.** And thus the priest, a demon in disguise, sung syren songs of
unbelief; and Jesus meditated long and well on what he said.  
**13.** The conflict was a bitter one, for king Ambition is a sturdy foe
to fight.  
**14.** For forty days the higher wrestled with the lower self, and then
the fight was won.  
**15.** Faith rose triumphant; unbelief was not. Ambition covered up his
face and fled away, and Jesus said,  
**16.** The wealth, the honour, and the fame of earth are but the
baubles of an hour.  
**17.** When this short span of earthly life has all been measured out,
man's bursting baubles will be buried with his bones,  
**18.** Yea, what a man does for his selfish self will make no markings
on the credit side of life.  
**19.** The good that men for other men shall do becomes a ladder strong
on which the soul may climb to wealth, and power and fame of God's own
kind, that cannot pass away.  
**20.** Give me the poverty of men, the consciousness of duty done in
love, the approbation of my God, and I will be content.  
**21.** And then he lifted up his eyes to heaven and said,  
**22.** My Father-God, I thank thee for this hour. I ask not for the
glory of thyself; I fain would be a keeper of thy temple gates, and
serve my brother man.  
**23.** Again was Jesus called to stand before the hierophant; again no
word was said, but in his hands the master placed a scroll on which was
written, FAITH.  
**24.** And Jesus bowed his head in humble thanks; then went his way.
