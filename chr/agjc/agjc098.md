#### Chapter 95

The Sermon on the Mount, continued. Jesus pronounces the eight
beatitudes and the eight woes. Speaks words of encouragement. Emphasises
the exalted character of the apostolic work.  
  
**1.** And Jesus and the twelve went to the mountain top, and Jesus
said,  
**2.** Twelve pillars of the church, apostles of the Christ;
light-bearers of the sun of life and ministers of God to men:  
**3.** In just a little while you must go forth alone, and preach the
gospel of the king, first to the Jews and then to all the world.  
**4.** And you shall go, not with a scourge of cords to drive; you
cannot drive men to the king;  
**5.** But you shall go in love and helpfulness and lead the way to
right and light.  
**6.** Go forth and say, The kingdom is at hand.  
**7.** Worthy are the strong in spirit; theirs the kingdom is.  
**8.** Worthy are the meek; they shall possess the land.  
**9.** Worthy they who hunger and thirst for right; they shall be
satisfied.  
**10.** Worthy are the merciful; and mercy shall be shown to them.  
**11.** Worthy they who gain the mastery of self; they have the key of
power.  
**12.** Worthy are the pure in heart; and they shall see the king.  
**13.** Worthy they who are maligned and wronged because they do the
right; their persecutors they shall bless.  
**14.** Worthy is the trustful child of faith; he shall sit in the
throne of power.  
**15.** Be not discouraged when the world shall persecute and call you
curst; but rather be exceeding glad.  
**16.** The prophets and the seers, and all the good of earth, have been
maligned.  
**17.** If you are worthy of the crown of life you will be slandered,
vilified and curst on earth.  
**18.** Rejoice when evil men shall drive you from their ways and cause
your name to be a hiss and by-word in the street.  
**19.** I say, rejoice; but deal in mercy with the doers of the wrong;
they are but children at their play; they know not what they do.  
**20.** Rejoice not over fallen foes. As you help men rise from the
depth of sin, so God will help you on to greater heights.  
**21.** Woe to the rich is gold and lands; they have temptations
multiforms.  
**22.** Woe unto men who walk at will in pleasure's paths; their ways
are full of snares and dangerous pits.  
**23.** Woe to the proud; they stand upon a precipice; destruction waits
for them.  
**24.** Woe to the man of greed; for what he has is not his own; and lo,
another comes; wealth is gone.  
**25.** Woe to the hypocrite; his form is fair to look upon; his heart
is filled with carcasses and dead men's bones.  
**26.** Woe to the cruel and relentless man; he is himself the victim of
his deeds.  
**27.** The evil he would do to other men rebounds; the scourger is the
scourged.  
**28.** Woe to the libertine who preys upon the virtues of the weak. The
hour comes when he will be the weak, the victim of a libertine of
greater power.  
**29.** Woe unto you when all the world shall speak in praise of you.
The world speaks not in praise of men who live within the Holy Breath;
It speaks in praise of prophets false, and of illusions base.  
**30.** You men who walk in Holy Breath are salt, the salt of earth; but
if you lose your virtue you are salt in name alone, worth nothing more
than dust.  
**31.** And you are light; are called to light the world.  
**32.** A city on a hill cannot be hid; its lights are seen afar; and
while you stand upon the hills of life men see your light and imitate
your works and honour God.  
**33.** Men do not light a lamp and hide it in a cask; they put it on a
stand that it may light the house.  
**34.** You are the lamps of God; must not stand in the shade of earth
illusions, but in the open, high upon the stand.  
**35.** I am not come to nullify the law, nor to destroy; but to
fulfil.  
**36.** The Law, the Prophets and the Psalms were written in the wisdom
of the Holy breath and cannot fail.  
**37.** The heavens and earth that are will change and pass away; the
word of God is sure; it cannot pass until it shall accomplish that where
unto it hath been sent.  
**38.** Whoever disregards the law of God and teaches men to do the
same, becomes a debtor unto God and cannot see his face until he has
returned and paid his debt by sacrifice of life.  
**39.** But he who hearkens unto God and keeps his law and does his will
on earth, shall rule with Christ.  
**40.** The scribes and Pharisees regard the letter of the law; they
cannot comprehend the spirit of the law;  
**41.** And if your righteousness does not exceed the righteousness of
scribe and Pharisee you cannot come into the kingdom of the soul.  
**42.** It is not what man does that gives him right to enter through
the gates; his pass word is his character and desire is his character.  
**43.** The letter of the law deals with the acts of man; the spirit of
the law takes note of his desires.
