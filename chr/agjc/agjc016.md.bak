#### SECTION IV  DALETH  Childhood and Early Education of John the Harbinger

#### Chapter 13

Elizabeth in Engedi. Teaches her son. John becomes the pupil of Matheno,
who reveals to him the meaning of sin and the law of forgiveness.  
  
**1.** Elizabeth was blest; she spent her time with John, and gave to
him the lessons that Elihu and Salome had given her.  
**2.** And John delighted in the wilderness of his home and in the
lessons that he learned.  
**3.** Now in the hills were many caves. The cave of David was a-near in
which the Hermit of Engedi lived.  
**4.** This hermit was Matheno, priest of Egypt, master from the temple
of Sakara.  
**5.** When John was seven years of age Matheno took him to the
wilderness and in the cave of David they abode.  
**6.** Matheno taught, and John was thrilled with what the master said,
and day by day Matheno opened up to him the mysteries of life.  
**7.** John loved the wilderness; he loved his master and his simple
fare. Their food was fruits, and nuts, wild honey and the carob bread.  
**8.** Matheno was an Isrealite, and he attended all the Jewish
feasts.  
**9.** When John was nine years old Matheno took him to a great feast in
Jerusalem.  
**10.** The wicked Archelaus had been deposed and exiled to a distant
land because of selfishness and cruelty, and John was not afraid.  
**11.** John was delighted with his visit to Jerusalem. Matheno told him
all about the service of the Jews; the meaning of their rites.  
**12.** John could not understand how sin could be forgiven by killing
animals and birds and burning them before the Lord.  
**13.** Matheno said, The God of heaven and earth does not require
sacrifice. This custom with its cruel rites was borrowed from the idol
worshippers of other lands.  
**14.** No sin was ever blotted out by sacrifice of animal, of bird, or
man.  
**15.** Sin is the rushing forth of man into fens of wickedness. If one
would get away from sin he must retrace his steps, and find his way out
of the fens of wickedness.  
**16.** Return and purify your hearts by love and righteousness and you
shall be forgiven.  
**17.** This is the burden of the message that the harbinger shall bring
to men.  
**18.** What is forgiveness? John inquired.  
**19.** Matheno said, It is the paying up of debts. A man who wrongs
another man can never be forgiven until he rights the wrong.  
**20.** The Vedas says that none can right the wrong but him who does
the wrong.  
**21.** John said, If this be true where is the power to forgive except
the power that rests in man himself? Can man forgive himself?  
**22.** Matheno said, The door is wide ajar; you see the way of man's
return to right, and the forgiveness of his sins.
