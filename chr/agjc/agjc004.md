#### SECTION I  ALEPH  Birth and Early Life of Mary, Mother of Jesus

#### Chapter 1

Palestine. Birth of Mary, Joachim's feast. Mary is blessed by the
priests. His prophecy. Mary abides in the temple. Is betrothed to
Joseph.  
  
**1.** Augustus Cæsar reigned and Herod Antipas was ruler of
Jerusalem.  
**2.** Three provinces comprised the land of Palistine: Judea, and
Samaria, and Galilee.  
**3.** Joachim was a master of the Jewish law, a man of wealth; he lived
in Nazareth of Galilee; and Anna, of the tribe of Judah, was his wife.  
**4.** To them was born a child, a goodly female child, and they were
glad; and Mary was the name they gave the child.  
**5.** Joachim made a feast in honour of the child; but he invited not
the rich, the honoured and the great; he called the poor the halt and
the lame, the blind, and to each one he gave a gift of raiment, food or
other needful thing.  
**6.** He said, The Lord has given me this wealth; I am his steward by
his grace, and if I give not to his children when in need, then he will
make this wealth a curse.  
**7.** Now, when the child was three years old her parents took her to
Jerusalem, and in the temple she received the blessings of the
priests.  
**8.** The high priest was a prophet and a seer, and when he saw the
child he said,  
**9.** Behold, this child will be the mother of an honoured prophet and
a master of the law; she shall abide within this holy temple of the
Lord.  
**10.** And Mary did abide within the temple of the Lord; and Hillel,
chief of the Sanhedrim, taught her all the precepts of Jews, and she
delighted in the law of God.  
**11.** When Mary reached the age of womanhood she was betrothed to
Joseph, son of Jacob, and a carpenter of Nazareth.  
**12.** And Joseph was an upright man, and a devoted Essenes.
