#### Chapter 150

Jesus heals blind Bartimaeus. With the twelve he goes to Bethany. The
multitudes come to welcome him and to speak with Lazarus.  
  
**1.** The Christines started on their way to Bethany, and as they went,
while yet in Jericho, they passed a beggar sitting by the way; and he
was blind Bartimaeus.  
**2.** And when the beggar heard the multitude pass by he said, What is
it that I hear?  
**3.** The people said to him, Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.  
**4.** And instantly the man cried out, Lord Jesus, son of David, stay!
have mercy on poor blind Bartimaeus!  
**5.** The people said to him, Be quiet; hold your peace.  
**6.** But blind Bartimaeus called again, Thou son of David, hear! have
mercy on poor blind Bartiaeus!  
**7.** And Jesus stopped and said, Bring him to me.  
**8.** And then the people brought the blind man to the Lord, and as
they brought him up they said, Be cheerful, now, Bartimaeus, the Lord is
calling you.  
**9.** And then he threw his cloak aside, and ran to Jesus as he waited
by the way.  
**10.** And Jesus said, What will you have, Bartimaeus?  
**11.** The blind man said, Rabboni, open up mine eyes that I may see.  
**12.** And Jesus said, Bartimaeus, look up; receive your sight; your
faith has made you whole.  
**13.** And he at once received his sight, and from the fulness of his
heart he said, Praise God.  
**14.** And all the people said, Praise God.  
**15.** Then Jesus and the twelve went on to Bethany. It was six days
before the feast.  
**16.** And when the people knew that Jesus was in Bethany they came
from near and far to see him and to hear him speak.  
**17.** And they were anxious all to talk with Lazarus, whom Jesus had
awakened form the dead.  
**18.** Now in Jerusalem the priests and Pharisees were all alert; they
said, This Jesus will be at the feast, and we must not permit that he
shall slip away again.  
**19.** And they commanded every man to be alert and help to apprehend
the Lord that they might take his life.
