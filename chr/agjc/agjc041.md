#### SECTION VIII  CHETH  Life and Works of Jesus in Persia

#### Chapter 38

Jesus crosses Persia. Teaches and heals in many places. Three magian
priests meet him as he nears Persepolis. Kaspar, and two other Persian
masters, meet him in Persepolis. The seven masters sit in silence seven
days.  
  
**1.** Four-and-Twenty years of age was Jesus when he entered Persia on
his homeward way.  
**2.** In many a hamlet, town and neighbourhood he paused a while and
taught and healed.  
**3.** The priests and ruling classes did not welcome him, because he
censured them for cruelty to those of low estate.  
**4.** The common people followed him in throngs  
**5.** At times the chiefs made bold to try to hinder him, forbidding
him to teach or heal the sick. But he regarded not their angry threats;
he taught, and healed the sick.  
**6.** In time he reached Persepolis, the city where the kings of Persia
were entombed; the city of the learned magi, Hor, and Lun, and Mer, the
three wise men.  
**7.** Who, four-and-twenty years before, had seen the star of promise
rise above Jerusalem, and who had journeyed to the West to find the
new-born king;  
**8.** And were the first to honour Jesus as the master of the age, and
gave him gifts of gold, gum-thus and myrrh.  
**9.** These magi knew, by ways that masters always know, when Jesus
neared Persepolis; and then they girt themselves, and went to meet him
on the way.  
**10.** And when they met, a light much brighter than the light of day,
surrounded them, and men who saw the four stand in the way declared they
were transfigured; seeming more like gods than men.  
**11.** Now, Hor and Lun were aged men, and Jesus placed them on his
beast to ride into Persepolis; whilst he and Mer led on the way.  
**12.** And when they reached the magi's home they all rejoiced. And
Jesus told the thrilling story of his life, and Hor and Lun and Mer
spoke not; they only looked to heaven, and in their hearts praised
God.  
**13.** Three wise men from the North were Persepolis; and they were
Kaspar, Zara and Melzone; and Kaspar was the wisest master of the Magian
land. These three were at the home of Hor and Lun and Mer when Jesus
came.  
**14.** For seven days these seven men spoke not; they sat in silence in
the council hall in close communion with the Silent Brotherhood.  
**15.** They sought for light, for revelation and for power. The laws
and precepts of the coming age required all the wisdom of the masters of
the world.
