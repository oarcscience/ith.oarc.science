#### SECTION XVII  PE  The Third Annual Epoch of the Christine Ministry of Jesus

#### Chapter 124

The Christines cross the sea. Jesus gives to his disciples lessons on
secret doctrines. Teaches the people. Feeds five thousand. The disciples
start to recross the sea. A storm arises. Jesus, walking on the waters,
comes to them. Trial of Peter's faith. They land in Gennesaret.  
  
**1.** The twelve apostles now had reached the stage of spirit
consciousness, and Jesus could reveal to them the deeper meanings of his
mission to the world.  
**2.** Next week the great feast of the Jews would be observed, and
Matthew said, Shall we not gird ourselves and go unto Jerusalem?  
**3.** But Jesus said, We will not go up to the feast; the time is short
and I have many things to say to you; come you apart into a desert place
and rest a while.  
**4.** And then they took their boats and crossed the sea, and came into
a desert place near Julius Bethsaida.  
**5.** The people saw them go, and in vast multitudes they followed
them.  
**6.** And Jesus had compassion on the anxious throng, and he stood
forth and taught them all the day, because they sought a light and were
like sheep without a fold.  
**7.** And as the night came on the twelve were doubting what the
multitudes would do, and Thomas said,  
**8.** Lord, we are in a desert place; the multitudes have naught to eat
and they are faint from lack of food; what shall we do?  
**9.** And Jesus said, Go to and feed the multitudes.  
**10.** And Judas said, Shall we go down and buy two hundred pennies'
worth of bread for them to eat?  
**11.** And Jesus, Go look into our larder and see how many loaves we
have.  
**12.** And Andrew said, We have no bread, but we have found a lad who
has five barley loaves and two small fish; but this would not be food
enough for one in ten.  
**13.** But Jesus said, Command these people all to sit upon the grass
in companies of twelve; and they all sat down in companies of twelve.  
**14.** Then Jesus took the loaves and fish, and looking up to heaven he
spoke the sacred Word.  
**15.** And then he broke the bread and gave it to the twelve; he also
gave the fish unto the twelve, and said, Go to and feed the
multitudes.  
**16.** And all the people ate and were refreshed.  
**17.** There were about five thousand men, a company of little ones,
and women not a few.  
**18.** And when the people all were filled the master said,  
**19.** Let not a crumb be lost; Go to and gather up the pieces of the
bread and fish for others that may want.  
**20.** They gathered up the fragments and they filled twelve baskets
full.  
**21.** The people were bewildered by this wondrous act of power; they
said, And now we know that Jesus is the prophet that our prophets said
would come; and then they said, All hail the king!  
**22.** Whne Jesus heard them say, All hail the king! he called the
twelve and bade them take their boats and go before him to the other
side;  
**23.** And he went all alone into a mountain pass to pray.  
**24.** The twelve were on the sea and hoped to reach Capernaum in just
a little time, when all at once a fearful storm arose, and they were at
the mercy of the waves.  
**25.** And in the fourth watch of the night the wind became a whirling
wind, and they were filled with fear.  
**26.** And in the blinding storm they saw a form move on the waves; it
seemed to be a man, one spoke out and said, It is a ghost, a sign of
evil things.  
**27.** But John discerned the form and said, It is the Lord.  
**28.** And then the wind blew not so hard, and Peter, standing in the
midst, exclaimed:  
**29.** My Lord! my Lord! If this be truly you, bid me to come to you
upon the waves.  
**30.** The form reached forth his hand and said, Come on.  
**31.** And Peter stepped upon the waves and they were solid as a rock;
he walked upon the waves.  
**32.** He walked until he thought within himself, What if the waves
should break beneath my feet?  
**33.** And then the waves did break beneath his feet, and he began to
sink, and in the fearfulness of soul he cried, O save me, Lord, or I am
lost!  
**34.** And Jesus took him by the hand and said, O you of little faith!
why did you doubt? And Jesus led the way unto the boat.  
**35.** The storm had spent its force; the winds were still, and they
were near the shore, and when they landed they were in the valley of
Gennesaret.
