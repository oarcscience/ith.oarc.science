#### Chapter 162

Jesus reveals more fully the mission of the Holy Breath. Tells his
disciples plainly that he is about to die, and they are sad. He prays
for them and all the world of believers. They leave the banquet hall.  
  
**1.** Now, John was deeply grieved because the master said, I go away,
and where I go you cannot come.  
**2.** He wept and said, Lord, I would go with you through every trial
and to death.  
**3.** And Jesus said, And you shall follow me through trials and
through death; but now you cannot go where I will go; but you shall
come.  
**4.** And Jesus spoke again unto the eleven and said, Grieve not
because I go away, for it is best that I should go away. If I go not the
Comforter will not come to you.  
**5.** These things I speak while with you in the flesh, but when the
Holy Breath shall come in power, lo, she will teach you more and more,
and bring to your remembrance all the words that I have said to you.  
**6.** There are a multitude of things yet to be said; things that this
age cannot receive, because it cannot comprehend.  
**7.** But, lo, I say, Before the great day of the Lord shall come, the
Holy Breath will make all mysteries known--  
**8.** The mysteries of the soul, of life, of death, of immortality; the
oneness of a man with every other man and with his God.  
**9.** Then will the world be led to truth, and man will be the truth.  
**10.** When she has come, the Comforter, she will convince the world of
sin, and of the truth of what I speak, and of the judgement of the just;
and then the prince of carnal life will be cast out.  
**11.** And when the Comforter shall come I need not intercede for you;
for you will stand approved, and God will know you then as he knows
me.  
**12.** The hour has come when you will weep; the wicked will rejoice,
because I go away; but I will come again, and all your sorrows shall be
turned to joy;  
**13.** Yea, verily, you will rejoice as one who welcomes back a brother
from the dead.  
**14.** And the disciples said, Our Lord, speak not in proverbs any
more; speak plainly unto us; we know that you are wise and know all
things.  
**15.** What is the meaning of your words, I go away, but I will come
again?  
**16.** And Jesus said, The hour is come when you will all be scattered
forth, and every man will be afraid;  
**17.** Will flee to save his life and leave me alone; yet I will not be
all alone; my Father-God is with me all the way.  
**18.** And wicked men will take me to the judgment seat of wicked men
and in the presence of the multitudes I will give up my life, a pattern
for the sons of men.  
**19.** But I will rise again and come to you.  
**20.** These things I speak that you may be established in the faith
when they shall come to pass.  
**21.** And you shall bear the buffetings of men, and follow in the
thorny path I tread.  
**22.** Be not dismayed; be of good cheer, Lo, I have overcome the
world, and you shall overcome the world.  
**23.** Then Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, My Father-God,
the hour has come;  
**24.** The son of man must now be lifted from the earth, and may he
falter not, that all the world may know the power of sacrifice;  
**25.** For as I give my life for men, lo, men must give their lives for
other men.  
**26.** I came to do thy will, O God, and in the sacred name, the Christ
is glorified, that men may see the Christ as life, as light, as truth.  
**27.** And through the Christ become themselves the life, the light,
the love, the truth.  
**28.** I praise thy name because of these whom thou hast given me, for
they have honoured thee and they will honour thee;  
**29.** And none of them are lost, and none are gone away, except the
blinded son of carnal life, who hath gone forth to sell his Lord.  
**30.** O God, forgive this man because he knows not what he does.  
**31.** And now, O God, I come to thee, and am no more in mortal life;
keep thou these men to whom I have made known thy wisdom and thy love.  
**32.** As they believe in me, and in the words I speak, may all the
worlds believe in them and in the words they speak.  
**33.** As thou hast sent me forth into the world, so I have sent them
forth. I pray that thou wouldst honour them as thou hast honoured me.  
**34.** I do not pray that thou wouldst take them from the world, but
that they may be guarded from the evil of the world, and not be subject
to temptations that are too great for them to bear.  
**35.** They once were of the world, but now are of the world no more,
as I am of the world no more.  
**36.** Thy word is truth, O God, and by thy word let them be
sanctified.  
**37.** I do not pray for these alone, O God; I also pray for all who
will believe on me, and will accept the Christ because of what they do
and say, that they may all be one.  
**38.** As I am one with thee, and thou art one with me, may they be one
with us,  
**39.** That all the world may know that thou hast sent me forth to do
thy will, and that thou lovest them as thou hast ever loved me.  
**40.** When Jesus had thus said, they sung the Jewish song of praise,
and then arose and went their way.
