<p></p> <h4>Chapter 95</h4> <i>
<p>The Sermon on the Mount, continued. Jesus pronounces the eight beatitudes and the eight woes. Speaks words of encouragement. Emphasises the exalted character of the apostolic work.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>And Jesus and the twelve went to the mountain top, and Jesus said,<br> <b>2. </b>Twelve pillars of the church, apostles of the Christ; light-bearers of the sun of life and ministers of God to men:<br> <b>3. </b>In just a little while you must go forth alone, and preach the gospel of the king, first to the Jews and then to all the world.<br> <b>4. </b>And you shall go, not with a scourge of cords to drive; you cannot drive men to the king;<br> <b>5. </b>But you shall go in love and helpfulness and lead the way to right and light.<br> <b>6. </b>Go forth and say, The kingdom is at hand.<br> <b>7. </b>Worthy are the strong in spirit; theirs the kingdom is.<br> <b>8. </b>Worthy are the meek; they shall possess the land.<br> <b>9. </b>Worthy they who hunger and thirst for right; they shall be satisfied.<br> <b>10. </b>Worthy are the merciful; and mercy shall be shown to them.<br> <b>11. </b>Worthy they who gain the mastery of self; they have the key of power.<br> <b>12. </b>Worthy are the pure in heart; and they shall see the king.<br> <b>13. </b>Worthy they who are maligned and wronged because they do the right; their persecutors they shall bless.<br> <b>14. </b>Worthy is the trustful child of faith; he shall sit in the throne of power.<br> <b>15. </b>Be not discouraged when the world shall persecute and call you curst; but rather be exceeding glad.<br> <b>16. </b>The prophets and the seers, and all the good of earth, have been maligned.<br> <b>17. </b>If you are worthy of the crown of life you will be slandered, vilified and curst on earth.<br> <b>18. </b>Rejoice when evil men shall drive you from their ways and cause your name to be a hiss and by-word in the street.<br> <b>19. </b>I say, rejoice; but deal in mercy with the doers of the wrong; they are but children at their play; they know not what they do.<br> <b>20. </b>Rejoice not over fallen foes. As you help men rise from the depth of sin, so God will help you on to greater heights.<br> <b>21. </b>Woe to the rich is gold and lands; they have temptations multiforms.<br> <b>22. </b>Woe unto men who walk at will in pleasure's paths; their ways are full of snares and dangerous pits.<br> <b>23. </b>Woe to the proud; they stand upon a precipice; destruction waits for them.<br> <b>24. </b>Woe to the man of greed; for what he has is not his own; and lo, another comes; wealth is gone.<br> <b>25. </b>Woe to the hypocrite; his form is fair to look upon; his heart is filled with carcasses and dead men's bones.<br> <b>26. </b>Woe to the cruel and relentless man; he is himself the victim of his deeds.<br> <b>27. </b>The evil he would do to other men rebounds; the scourger is the scourged.<br> <b>28. </b>Woe to the libertine who preys upon the virtues of the weak. The hour comes when he will be the weak, the victim of a libertine of greater power.<br> <b>29. </b>Woe unto you when all the world shall speak in praise of you. The world speaks not in praise of men who live within the Holy Breath; It speaks in praise of prophets false, and of illusions base.<br> <b>30. </b>You men who walk in Holy Breath are salt, the salt of earth; but if you lose your virtue you are salt in name alone, worth nothing more than dust.<br> <b>31. </b>And you are light; are called to light the world.<br> <b>32. </b>A city on a hill cannot be hid; its lights are seen afar; and while you stand upon the hills of life men see your light and imitate your works and honour God.<br> <b>33. </b>Men do not light a lamp and hide it in a cask; they put it on a stand that it may light the house.<br> <b>34. </b>You are the lamps of God; must not stand in the shade of earth illusions, but in the open, high upon the stand.<br> <b>35. </b>I am not come to nullify the law, nor to destroy; but to fulfil.<br> <b>36. </b>The Law, the Prophets and the Psalms were written in the wisdom of the Holy breath and cannot fail.<br> <b>37. </b>The heavens and earth that are will change and pass away; the word of God is sure; it cannot pass until it shall accomplish that where unto it hath been sent.<br> <b>38. </b>Whoever disregards the law of God and teaches men to do the same, becomes a debtor unto God and cannot see his face until he has returned and paid his debt by sacrifice of life.<br> <b>39. </b>But he who hearkens unto God and keeps his law and does his will on earth, shall rule with Christ.<br> <b>40. </b>The scribes and Pharisees regard the letter of the law; they cannot comprehend the spirit of the law;<br> <b>41. </b>And if your righteousness does not exceed the righteousness of scribe and Pharisee you cannot come into the kingdom of the soul.<br> <b>42. </b>It is not what man does that gives him right to enter through the gates; his pass word is his character and desire is his character.<br> <b>43. </b>The letter of the law deals with the acts of man; the spirit of the law takes note of his desires.</p>
