#### Chapter 58

Meeting of the sages, continued. Presentation of the seven universal
postulates.  
  
**1.** Now, when the sages were refreshed they opened up the Book of
Life and read.  
**2.** They read the story of the life of man; of all his struggles,
losses, gains; and in the light of past events and needs, they saw what
would be best for him in coming years.  
**3.** They knew the kind of laws and precepts suited best to his
estate; they saw the highest God-ideal that the race could comprehend.  
**4.** Upon the seven postulates these sages were to formulate, the
great philosophy of life and worship of the coming age must rest.  
**5.** Now Meng-ste was the oldest sage; he took the chair of chief, and
said,  
**6.** Man is not far enough advanced to live by faith; he cannot
comprehend the things his eyes see not.  
**7.** He yet is child, and during all the coming age he must be taught
by pictures, symbols, rites and forms.  
**8.** His God must be a human God; he cannot see a God by faith.  
**9.** And then he cannot rule himself; the king must rule; the man must
serve.  
**10.** The age that follows this will be the age of man, the age of
faith.  
**11.** In that blest age the human race will see without the aid of
carnal eyes; will hear the soundless sound; will know the Spirit-God.  
**12.** The age we enter is the Preparation age, and all the schools and
governments and worship rites must be designed in simple way that men
may comprehend.  
**13.** And man cannot originate; he builds by patterns that he sees; so
in this council we must carve out pattern for the coming age.  
**14.** And we must formulate the gnosis of the Empire of the soul,
which rests on seven postulates.  
**15.** Each sage in turn shall form a postulate; and these shall be the
basis of the creeds of men until the perfect age shall come.  
**16.** Then Meng-ste wrote the first:  
**17.** All things are thought; all life is thought activity. The
multitude of beings are but phases of the one great thought made
manifest. Lo, God is Thought, and Thought is God.  
**18.** Then Vidyapati wrote the second postulate:  
**19.** Eternal Thought is one; in essence it is two--Intelligence and
Force; and when they breathe a child is born; this child is Love.  
**20.** And thus the Triune God stands forth, whom men call
Father-Mother-Child.  
**21.** This Triune God is one; but like the one of light, in essence he
is seven.  
**22.** And when the Triune God breathes forth, lo, seven Spirits stand
before his face; these are creative attributes.  
**23.** Men call them lesser gods, and in their image they made man.  
**24.** And Kaspar wrote the third:  
**25.** Man was a thought of God, formed in the image of the Septonate,
clothed in the substances of soul.  
**26.** And his desires were strong; he sought to manifest on every
plane of life, and for himself he made a body of the ethers of the
earthly forms, and so descended to the plane of earth.  
**27.** In this descent he lost his birthright; lost his harmony with
God, and made discordant all the notes of life.  
**28.** Inharmony and evil are the same; so evil is the handiwork of
man.  
**29.** Ashbina wrote the fourth:  
**30.** Seeds do not germinate in light; they do not grow until they
find the soil, and hide themselves away from light.  
**31.** Man was evolved a seed of everlasting life; but in the ethers of
the Triune God the light was far too great for seeds to grow;  
**32.** And so man sought the soil of carnal life, and in the
darksomeness of earth he found a place where he could germinate and
grow.  
**33.** The seed has taken root and grown full well.  
**34.** The tree of human life is rising from the soil of earthy things,
and, under natural law, is reaching up to perfect form.  
**35.** There are no supernatural acts of God to lift a man from carnal
life to spirit blessedness; he grows as grows the plant, and in due time
is perfected.  
**36.** The quality of soul that makes it possible for man to rise to
spirit life is purity.
