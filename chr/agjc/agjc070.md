#### Chapter 67

Jesus visits John at the Jordan. Delivers his first Christine address to
the people. The address. He goes with his disciples to Bethany.  
  
**1.** Now, on the morrow Jesus came again and stood with John beside
the ford; and John prevailed on him to speak, and standing forth he
said.  
**2.** You men of Israel, Hear! The kingdom is at hand.  
**3.** Behold the great key-keeper of the age stands in your midst; and
with the spirit of Elijah he has come.  
**4.** Behold, for he has turned the key; the mighty gates fly wide and
all who will may greet the king.  
**5.** Behold these multitudes of women, children, men! they throng the
avenues, they crowd the outer courts; each seems to be intent to be the
first to meet the king.  
**6.** Behold, the censor comes and calls, Whoever will may come; but he
who comes must will to prune himself of every evil thought;  
**7.** Must overcome desire to gratify the lower self; must give his
life to save the lost.  
**8.** The nearer to the kingdom gate you come, more spacious is the
room; the multitudes have gone.  
**9.** If men could come unto the kingdom with their carnal thoughts,
their passions and desires, there scarcely would be room for all.  
**10.** But when they cannot take these through the narrow gate they
turn away; the few are ready to go in and see the king.  
**11.** Behold, John is a mighty fisher, fishing for the souls of men.
He throws his great net out into the sea of human life; he draws it in
and it is full.  
**12.** But what a medley catch! a catch of crabs, and lobsters, sharks
and creeping things, with now and then a fish of better kind.  
**13.** Behold the thousands come to hear the Wild Man of the hills;
they come in crowds that he may wash them in the crystal flood, and with
their lips they do confess their sins.  
**14.** But when the morrow comes we find them in their haunts of vice
again, reviling John, and cursing God, and heaping insults on the
king.  
**15.** But blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see the
king.  
**16.** And blessed are the strong in heart, for they shall not be cast
about by every wind that blows;  
**17.** But while the fickle and the thoughtless have gone back to Egypt
land for leeks and carnal herbs to satisfy their appetites, the pure in
heart have found the king.  
**18.** But even those whose faith is weak, and who are naught but
carnal manifests, will some day come again, and enter in with joy to see
the king.  
**19.** O men of Israel, take heed to what this prophet has to say! Be
strong in mind; be pure in heart; be vigilant in helpfulness; the
kingdom is at hand.  
**20.** When Jesus had thus said he went his way, and with his six
disciples came to Bethany; and they abode with Lazarus many days.
