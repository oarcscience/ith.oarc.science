#### SECTION XII  LAMED  The Council of the Seven Sages of the World

#### Chapter 56

The seven sages of the world meet in Alexandria. The purposes of the
meeting. The opening addresses.  
  
**1.** In every age since time began have seven sages lived.  
**2.** At first of every age these sages meet to note the course of
nations, peoples, tribes and tongues;  
**3.** To note how far toward justice, love and righteousness the race
has gone;  
**4.** To formulate the code of laws, religious postulates and plans of
rule best suited to the coming age.  
**5.** An age had passed, and lo, another age had come; the sages must
convene.  
**6.** Now, Alexandria was the centre of the world's best thought, and
here in Philo's home the sages met.  
**7.** From China came Meng-ste; from India Viyapati came; from Persia
Kaspar came; and from Assyria Ashbina came; from Greece Apollo; Matheno
was the Egyptian sage, and Philo was the chief of Hebrew thought.  
**8.** The time was due; the council met and sat in silence seven
days.  
**9.** And then Meng-ste arose and said, The wheel of time has turned
once more; the race is on a higher plane of thought.  
**10.** The garments that or fathers wove have given out; the cherubim
have woven a celestial cloth; have placed it in our hands and we must
make for men new garbs.  
**11.** The sons of men are looking up for greater light. No longer do
they care for gods hewn out of wood, or made of clay. They seek a Gob
not made with hands.  
**12.** They see the beams of coming day, and yet they comprehend them
not.  
**13.** The time is ripe, and we must fashion well these garments for
the race.  
**14.** And let us make for men new garbs of justice, mercy,
righteousness and love, that they may hide their nakedness when shines
the light of coming day.  
**15.** And Vidyapati said, Our priests have all gone mad; they saw a
demon in the wilds and at him cast their lamps and they are broken up,
and not a gleam of light has any priest for men.  
**16.** The night is dark; the heart of India calls for light.  
**17.** The priesthood cannot be reformed; it is already dead; its
greatest needs are graves and funeral chants.  
**18.** The new age calls for liberty; the kind that makes each man a
priest, enables him to go alone, and lay his offerings on the shrine of
God.  
**19.** And Kaspar said, In Persia people walk in fear; they do the good
for fear to do the wrong.  
**20.** The devil is the greatest power in our land, and though a myth,
he dandles on his knee both youth and age.  
**21.** Our land is dark, and evil prospers in the dark.  
**22.** Fear rides on every passing breeze, and lurks in every form of
life.  
**23.** The fear of evil is a myth, is an illusion and a snare; but it
will live until some mighty power shall come to raise the ethers to the
plane of light.  
**24.** When this shall come to pass the magian land will glory in the
light. The soul of Persia calls for light.
