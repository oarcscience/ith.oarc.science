#### Chapter 99

The Sermon on the Mount, continued. Jesus unfolds to the twelve the
spiritual aspects of the ninth Commandment.  
  
**1.** The law has said: Thou shalt not lie; but in the eyes of law a
man to lie must tell in words what is not true.  
**2.** Now, in the light of spirit law, deceit in any form is nothing
but a lie.  
**3.** A man may lie by look or act; yea, even by his silence may
deceive, and thus be guilty in the eyes of Holy Breath.  
**4.** It has been said in olden times: Thou shalt not swear by thine
own life.  
**5.** But, lo, I say, Swear not at all; not by the head, the heart, the
eye, nor hand; not by the sun, the moon, nor stars;  
**6.** Not by the name of God, nor by the name of any spirit, good or
bad.  
**7.** You shall not swear by anything; for in an oath there is no
gain.  
**8.** A man whose word must be propped up by oath of any kind is not
trustworthy in the sight of God or man.  
**9.** By oath you cannot make a leaf to fall, nor turn the colour of a
hair.  
**10.** The man of worth just speaks and men know that he speaks the
truth.  
**11.** The man who pours out many words to make think he speaks the
truth, is simply making smoke to hide a lie.  
**12.** And there are many men with seeming double hearts; men who would
serve two masters at a time--two masters quite adverse.  
**13.** Men feign to worship God upon the Sabbath day and then pay court
to Beelzebul on every other day.  
**14.** No man can serve two masters at a time no more than he can ride
two asses at a time that go in different ways.  
**15.** The man who feigns to worship God and Beelzebul is foe of God, a
pious devil and a curse of men.  
**16.** And men cannot lay treasures up in heaven and earth at once.  
**17.** Then, lo, I say, Lift up your eyes and see the safety vaults of
heaven, and there deposit every gem.  
**18.** Where moth and rust cannot corrupt; where thieves cannot break
in and steal.  
**19.** There are no safety vaults on earth; no place secure from moth,
and rust and thieves.  
**20.** The treasures of the earth are but illusive things that pass
away.  
**21.** Be not deceived; your treasures are the anchor of the soul, and
where your treasures are your heart will be.  
**22.** Fix not your heart upon the things of earth; be anxious not
about the things to eat, or drink or wear.  
**23.** God cares for those who trust in him and serve the race.  
**24.** Behold the birds! They praise God in their songs; the earth is
made more glorious by their ministry of joy; God keeps them in the
hollow of his hand,  
**25.** And not a sparrow falls to earth without his care; and every one
that falls shall rise again.  
**26.** Behold the flowers of earth! they trust in God and grow; they
make the earth resplendent with their beauty and perfume.  
**27.** Look at the lilies of the field, the messengers of holy love. No
son of man, not even Solomon in all his excellence, was ever clothed
like one of these.  
**28.** And yet they simply trust in God; they feed from out his hand;
they lay their heads to rest upon his breast.  
**29.** If God so clothes and feeds the flowers and birds that do his
will, will he not feed and clothe his children when they trust in him?  
**30.** Seek first the kingdom of the soul, the righteousness of God,
the good of men, and feed, and clothe.
