### CHAPTER 28

### The Third Angel's Message

 

As the ministration of Jesus closed in the Holy place, and he passed
into the Holiest, and stood before the ark containing the law of God, he
sent another mighty angel to earth with the third message.  He placed a
parchment in the angel's hand, and as he descended to earth in majesty
and power, he proclaimed a fearful warning, the most terrible
threatening ever borne to man.  This message was designed to put the
children of God upon their guard, and show them the hour of temptation
and anguish that was before them.  Said the angel, They will be brought
into close combat with the beast and his image.  Their only hope of
eternal life is to remain steadfast.  Although their lives are at stake,
yet they must hold fast the truth.  The third angel closes his message
with these words, Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that
keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.  As he repeated
these words he pointed to the heavenly Sanctuary.  The minds of all who
embrace this message are directed to the Most Holy place where Jesus
stands before the ark, making his final intercession for all those for
whom mercy still lingers, and for those who have ignorantly broken the
law of God.  This atonement is made for the righteous dead as well as
for the righteous living.  Jesus makes an atonement for those who died,
not receiving the light upon God's commandments, who sinned ignorantly.

After Jesus opened the door of the Most Holy the light of the Sabbath
was seen, and the people of God were to be tested and proved, as God
proved the children of Israel anciently, to see if they would keep his
law.  I saw the third angel pointing upward, showing the disappointed
ones the way to the Holiest of the heavenly Sanctuary.  They followed
Jesus by faith into the Most Holy.  Again they have found Jesus, and joy
and hope spring up anew.  I saw them looking back reviewing the past,
from the proclamation of the second advent of Jesus, down through their
travels to the passing of the time in 1844.  They see their
disappointment explained, and joy and certainty again animate them.  The
third angel has lighted up the past, present and future, and they know
that God has indeed led them by his mysterious providence.

It was represented to me that the remnant followed Jesus into the Most
Holy place, and beheld the ark, and the mercy-seat, and were captivated
with their glory.  Jesus raised the cover of the ark, and behold! the
tables of stone, with the ten commandments written upon them.  They
trace down the lively oracles; but they start back with trembling when
they see the fourth commandment living among the ten holy precepts,
while a brighter light shines upon it than upon the other nine, and a
halo of glory is all around it.  They find nothing there informing them
that the Sabbath has been abolished, or changed to the first day of the
week.  It reads as when spoken by the mouth of God in solemn and awful
grandeur upon the mount, while the lightnings flashed and the thunders
rolled, and when written with his own holy finger in the tables of
stone.  Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work; but the seventh
day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.  They are amazed as they behold
the care taken of the ten commandments.  They see them placed close by
Jehovah, overshadowed and protected by his holiness.  They see that they
have been trampling upon the fourth commandment of the decalogue, and
have observed a day handed down by the heathen and papists, instead of
the day sanctified by Jehovah.  They humble themselves before God, and
mourn over their past transgressions.

I saw the incense in the censer smoke as Jesus offered their confessions
and prayers to his Father.  And as it ascended, a bright light rested
upon Jesus, and upon the mercy-seat; and the earnest, praying ones, who
were troubled because they had discovered themselves to be transgressors
of God's law, were blest, and their countenances lighted up with hope
and joy.  They joined in the work of the third angel, and raised their
voices and proclaimed the solemn warning.  But few at first received the
message, yet they continued with energy to proclaim the warning.  Then I
saw many embrace the message of the third angel, and unite their voices
with those who had first proclaimed the warning, and they exalted God
and magnified him by observing his sanctified Rest-day.

Many who embraced the third message had not an experience in the two
former messages.  Satan understood this, and his evil eye was upon them
to overthrow them; but the third angel was pointing them to the Most
Holy place, and those who had an experience in the past messages were
pointing them the way to the heavenly Sanctuary.  Many saw the perfect
chain of truth in the angels' messages, and gladly received it.  They
embraced them in their order, and followed Jesus by faith into the
heavenly Sanctuary.  These messages were represented to me as an anchor
to hold the body.  And as individuals receive and understand them, they
are shielded against the many delusions of Satan.

After the great disappointment in 1844, Satan and his angels were busily
engaged in laying snares to unsettle the faith of the body.  He was
affecting the minds of individuals who had a personal experience in
these things.  They had an appearance of humility.  They changed the
first and second messages, and pointed to the future for their
fulfilment, while others pointed far back in the past, declaring that
they had been there fulfilled.  These individuals were drawing the minds
of the inexperienced away, and unsettling their faith.  Some were
searching the Bible to try to build up a faith of their own, independent
of the body.  Satan exulted in all this; for he knew that those who
broke loose from the anchor, he could affect by different errors and
drive about with winds of doctrine.  Many who had led in the first and
second messages, denied them, and division and scattering was throughout
the body.  I then saw Wm. Miller.  He looked perplexed, and was bowed
with sorrow and distress for his people.  He saw the company who were
united and loving in 1844, losing their love for each other, and
opposing one another.  He saw them fall back into a cold, backslidden
state.  Grief wasted his strength.  I saw leading men watching Wm.
Miller, and fearing lest he should embrace the third angel's message and
the commandments of God.  And as he would lean towards the light from
heaven, these men would lay some plan to draw his mind away.  I saw a
human influence exerted to keep his mind in darkness, and to retain his
influence among them.  At length Wm. Miller raised his voice against the
light from heaven.  He failed in not receiving the message which would
have fully explained his disappointment, and cast a light and glory on
the past, which would have revived his exhausted energies, brightened up
his hope, and led him to glorify God.  But he leaned to human wisdom
instead of divine, and being broken with arduous labor in his Master's
cause, and by age, he was not as accountable as those who kept him from
the truth.  They are responsible, and the sin rests upon them.  If Wm.
Miller could have seen the light of the third message, many things which
looked dark and mysterious to him would have been explained.  His
brethren professed such deep love and interest for him, he thought he
could not tear away from them.  His heart would incline towards the
truth; but then he looked at his brethren.  They opposed it.  Could he
tear away from those who had stood side and shoulder with him in
proclaiming Jesus' coming?  He thought they surely would not lead him
astray.

God suffered him to come under the power of Satan, and death to have
dominion over him.  He hid him in the grave, away from those who were
constantly drawing him from God.  Moses erred just as he was about to
enter the promised land.  So also, I saw that Wm. Miller erred as he was
soon to enter the heavenly Canaan, in suffering his influence to go
against the truth.  Others led him to this.  Others must account for
it.  But angels watch the precious dust of this servant of God, and he
will come forth at the sound of the last trump.
