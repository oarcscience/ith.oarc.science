### CHAPTER 20

### The Reformation

 

But notwithstanding all the persecution and the putting to death of the
saints, yet living witnesses were raised up on every hand.  The angels
of God were doing the work committed to their trust.  They were
searching in the darkest places, and were selecting out of the darkness,
men who were honest at heart.  They were all buried up in error, yet God
selected them as he did Saul, as chosen vessels to bear his truth, and
raise their voices against the sins of his professed people.  The angels
of God moved upon Martin Luther, Melancthon, and others in different
places, to thirst for the living testimony of the word of God.  The
enemy had come in like a flood, and the standard must be raised up
against him.  Luther was chosen to breast the storm, and stand up
against the ire of a fallen church, and strengthen the few who were
faithful to their holy profession.  He was ever fearful of offending
God.  He tried through works to obtain the favor of God; but he was not
satisfied until a gleam of light from heaven drove the darkness from his
mind, and led him to trust, not in works, but in the merits of the blood
of Christ; and to come to God for himself, not through popes nor
confessors, but through Jesus Christ alone.  O how precious was this
knowledge to Luther!  He prized this new and precious light which had
dawned upon his dark understanding, and had driven away his
superstition, higher than the richest earthly treasure.  The word of God
was new.  Every thing was changed.  The Book he had dreaded because he
could not see beauty in it, was *life*, **LIFE** to him.  It was his
joy, his consolation, his blessed teacher.  Nothing could induce him to
leave its study.  He had feared death; but as he read the word of God,
all his terrors disappeared, and he admired the character of God, and
loved him.  He searched the word of God for himself.  He feasted upon
the rich treasures it contained, and then he searched it for the
church.  He was disgusted with the sins of those in whom he had trusted
for salvation.  He saw very many enshrouded in the same darkness which
had covered him.  He anxiously sought an opportunity to point them to
the Lamb of God, who alone taketh away the sin of the world.  He raised
his voice against the errors and sins of the Papal church, and earnestly
longed to break the chain of darkness which was confining thousands, and
causing them to trust in works for salvation.  He longed to be enabled
to open to their minds the true riches of the grace of God, and the
excellence of salvation obtained through Jesus Christ.  He raised his
voice zealously, and in the power of the Holy Spirit, cried against the
existing sins of the leaders of the church; and as he met the storm of
opposition from the priests, his courage did not fail; for he firmly
relied upon the strong arm of God, and confidently trusted in him for
victory.  And as he pushed the battle closer and closer, the rage of the
priests was kindled against him.  They did not wish to be reformed. 
They chose to be left in ease, in wanton pleasure, in wickedness.  They
wished the church kept in darkness.

I saw that Luther was ardent and zealous, fearless and bold in reproving
sin, and advocating the truth.  He cared not for wicked men and devils. 
He knew that he had One with him mightier than they all.  Luther
possessed fire, zeal, courage and boldness, and at times might go too
far; but God raised up Melancthon, who was just the opposite in
character, to aid Luther, and carry on the work of reformation. 
Melancthon was timid, fearful, cautious, and possessed great patience. 
He was greatly beloved of God.  His knowledge was great in the
Scriptures, and his judgment and wisdom was excellent.  His love for the
cause of God was equal to Luther's.  These hearts, the Lord knit
together; they were friends which were never to be separated.  Luther
was a great help to Melancthon when he was in danger of being fearful
and slow, and Melancthon was also a great help to Luther to keep him
from moving too fast.  Melancthon's far-seeing cautiousness often
averted trouble which would have come upon the cause, if the work had
been left alone to Luther; and the work would often have failed in being
pushed forward, if it had been left to Melancthon alone.  I was shown
the wisdom of God in choosing these two men, of different characters to
carry on the work of reformation.

I was then carried back to the days of the apostles, and saw that God
chose as companions an ardent and zealous Peter, and a mild, patient,
meek John.  Sometimes Peter was impetuous.  And the beloved disciple
often checked Peter, when his zeal and ardor led him too far; but it did
not reform him.  But after Peter had denied his Lord, and repented, and
was converted, all he needed was a mild caution from John to check his
ardor and zeal.  The cause of Christ would often have suffered had it
been left alone to John.  Peter's zeal was needed.  His boldness and
energy often delivered them from difficulty, and silenced their
enemies.  John was winning.  He gained many to the cause of Christ by
his patient forbearance, and deep devotedness.

God raised up men to cry against the existing sins of the Papal church,
and carry forward the reformation.  Satan sought to destroy these living
witnesses; but God made a hedge about them.  Some, for the glory of his
name, were permitted to seal the testimony they had borne with their
blood; but there were other powerful men, like Luther and Melancthon,
who could best glorify God by living and crying aloud against the sins
of popes, priests and kings.  They trembled before the voice of Luther. 
Through those chosen men, rays of light began to scatter the darkness,
and very many joyfully received the light and walked in it.  And when
one witness was slain, two or more were raised up to fill his place.

But Satan was not satisfied.  He could only have power over the body. 
He could not make believers yield their faith and hope.  And even in
death they triumphed with a bright hope of immortality at the
resurrection of the just.  They had more than mortal energy.  They dared
not sleep for a moment.  They kept the Christian armor girded about
them, prepared for a conflict, not merely with spiritual foes, but with
Satan in the form of men, whose constant cry was, Give up your faith, or
die.  Those few Christians were strong in God, and more precious in his
sight than half a world bearing the name of Christ, yet cowards in his
cause.  While the church was persecuted, they were united and loving. 
They were strong in God.  Sinners were not permitted to unite themselves
with it; neither the deceiver nor the deceived.  Those only who were
willing to forsake all for Christ could be his disciples.  They loved to
be poor, humble and Christ-like.
