### CHAPTER 22

### William Miller

 

I saw that God sent his angel to move upon the heart of a farmer who had
not believed the Bible, and led him to search the prophecies.  Angels of
God repeatedly visited that chosen one, and guided his mind, and opened
his understanding to prophecies which had ever been dark to God's
people.  The commencement of the chain of truth was given to him, and he
was led on to search for link after link, until he looked with wonder
and admiration upon the word of God.  He saw there a perfect chain of
truth.  That Word which he had regarded as uninspired, now opened before
his vision with beauty and glory.  He saw that one portion of scripture
explained another, and when one portion was closed to his understanding,
he found in another portion of the Word that which explained it.  He
regarded the sacred word of God with joy, and with the deepest respect
and awe.

As he followed down the prophecies, he saw that the inhabitants of earth
were living in the closing scenes of this world's history, and they knew
it not.  He looked at the corruptions of the churches, and saw that
their love was taken from Jesus, and placed on the world, and that they
were seeking for worldly honor instead of that honor which cometh from
above; ambitious for worldly riches, instead of laying up their treasure
in heaven.  Hypocrisy, darkness and death he could see everywhere.  His
spirit was stirred within him.  God called him to leave his farm, as
Elisha was called to leave his oxen and the field of his labor to follow
Elijah.  With trembling, William Miller began to unfold the mysteries of
the kingdom of God to the people.  He gained strength with every
effort.  He carried the people down through the prophecies to the second
advent of Christ.  As John the Baptist heralded the first advent of
Jesus, and prepared the way for his coming, so also, Wm. Miller and
those who joined with him, proclaimed the second advent of the Son of
God.

I was carried back to the days of the disciples, and was shown the
beloved John, that God had a special work for him to accomplish.  Satan
was determined to hinder this work, and he led on his servants to
destroy John.  But God sent his angel and wonderfully preserved him. 
All who witnessed the great power of God manifested in the deliverance
of John, were astonished, and many were convinced that God was with him,
and that the testimony which he bore concerning Jesus was correct. 
Those who sought to destroy him were afraid to again attempt to take his
life, and he was permitted to suffer on for Jesus.  He was falsely
accused by his enemies, and was shortly banished to a lonely island,
where the Lord sent his angel to reveal to him things which were to take
place upon the earth, and the state of the church down through to the
end; her backslidings, and the position the church should occupy if she
would please God, and finally overcome.  The angel from heaven came to
John in majesty.  His countenance beamed with the excellent glory of
heaven.  He revealed to John scenes of deep and thrilling interest
concerning the church of God, and brought before him the perilous
conflicts they were to endure.  John saw them pass through fiery trials,
and made white and tried, and, finally, victorious overcomers,
gloriously saved in the kingdom of God.  The countenance of the angel
grew radiant with joy, and was exceeding glorious, as he showed to John
the final triumph of the church of God.  John was enraptured as he
beheld the final deliverance of the church, and as he was carried away
with the glory of the scene, with deep reverence and awe he fell at the
feet of the angel to worship him.  The angel instantly raised him up,
and gently reproved him, saying, See thou do it not; I am thy
fellow-servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus;
worship God; for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.  The
angel then showed John the heavenly city with all its splendor and
dazzling glory.  John was enraptured and overwhelmed with the glory of
the city.  He did not bear in mind his former reproof from the angel,
but again fell to worship before the feet of the angel, who again gave
the gentle reproof, See thou do it not; for I am thy fellow-servant, and
of thy brethren the prophets, and of them that keep the sayings of this
book; worship God.

Preachers and people have looked upon the book of Revelation as
mysterious, and of less importance than other portions of the sacred
Scriptures.  But I saw that this book is indeed a revelation given for
the especial benefit of those who should live in the last days, to guide
them in ascertaining their true position, and their duty.  God led the
mind of Wm. Miller into the prophecies, and gave him great light upon
the book of Revelation.

If Daniel's visions had been understood, the people could better have
understood the visions of John.  But at the right time, God moved upon
his chosen servant, who with clearness and in the power of the Holy
Spirit, opened the prophecies, and showed the harmony of the visions of
Daniel and John, and other portions of the Bible, and pressed home upon
the hearts of the people the sacred, fearful warnings of the Word, to
prepare for the coming of the Son of man.  Deep and solemn convictions
rested upon the minds of those who heard him, and ministers and people,
sinners and infidels, turned to the Lord, to seek a preparation to stand
in the judgment.

Angels of God accompanied Wm. Miller in his mission.  He was firm and
undaunted.  He fearlessly proclaimed the message committed to his
trust.  A world lying in wickedness, and a cold, worldly church were
enough to call into action his energy, and lead him to willingly endure
toil, privation and suffering.  Although opposed by professed Christians
and the world, and buffeted by Satan and his angels, he ceased not to
preach the everlasting gospel to crowds wherever he was invited, and
sound the cry, Fear God and give glory to him; for the hour of his
judgment is come.
