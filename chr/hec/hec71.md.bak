style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Theoctistus
of the Studium.</span>

\+ circ. A.D. 890.

He is said to have been the friend of S. Joseph; but is only known-to us
by the "Suppliant Canon to Jesus," to be found at the end of the
Paracletice. The following is a Cento formed from it.

Ἰησοῦ γλυκύτατε.

<span class="smallcaps">Jesu</span>, Name all names above,  
  <span class="smallcaps">Jesu</span>, best and dearest,  
<span class="smallcaps">Jesu</span>, Fount of perfect love,  
  Holiest, tenderest, nearest;  
<span class="smallcaps">Jesu</span>, source of grace completest,  
<span class="smallcaps">Jesu</span> purest, <span
class="smallcaps">Jesu</span> sweetest,  
  <span class="smallcaps">Jesu</span>, Well of power Divine,  
  Make me, keep me, seal me Thine!

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Jesu</span>, open me the gate  
  That of old he enter’d,  
Who, in that most lost estate,  
  Wholly on Thee ventur’d;  
Thou, Whose Wounds are ever pleading,  
And Thy Passion interceding,  
  From my misery let me rise  
  To a Home in Paradise!

Thou didst call the Prodigal:  
  Thou didst pardon Mary:  
Thou Whose words can never fall,  
  Love can never vary:  
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, to heal my lost condition,  
Give—for Thou canst give—contrition;  
  Thou canst pardon all mine ill  
  If Thou wilt: O say, "I will!"

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

Woe, that I have turned aside  
  After fleshly pleasure!  
Woe, that I have never tried  
  For the Heavenly Treasure!  
Treasure, safe in Home supernal;  
Incorruptible, eternal!  
  Treasure no less price hath won  
  Than the Passion of The <span class="smallcaps">Son</span>!

<span class="smallcaps">Jesu</span>, crown’d with Thorns for me,  
  Scourged for my transgression,  
Witnessing, through agony,  
  That Thy good confession!  
<span class="smallcaps">Jesu</span>, clad in purple raiment,  
For my evils making payment;  
  Let not all Thy woe and pain,  
  Let not Calvary, be in vain!

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

When I reach Death's bitter sea  
  And its waves roll higher,  
Help the more forsaking me  
  As the storm draws nigher:  
<span class="smallcaps">Jesu</span>, leave me not to languish,  
Helpless, hopeless, full of anguish!  
  Tell me,—"Verily I say,  
  Thou shalt be with Me to-day!"
