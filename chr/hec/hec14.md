### <span style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">S. Andrew of Crete.</span>

A.D. 660. . . .A.D. 732.

Andrew was born at Damascus, about the year 660, and embraced the
monastic life at Jerusalem, from which city he sometimes takes his name.
Hence he was sent on ecclesiastical business to Constantinople, where he
became a Deacon of the Great Church, and Warden of the Orphanage. His
first entrance on public life does no credit to his sanctity. During the
reign of Philippicus Bardanes, (711–714) he was raised by that usurper
to the Archiepiscopate of Crete; and shortly afterwards was one of the
Pseudo-Synod of Constantinople, held under the Emperor's auspices in
A.D. 712, which condemned the Sixth Œcumenical Council, and

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

restored the Monothelite heresy. At a later period, however, he returned
to the faith of the Church, and refuted the error into which he had
fallen. Seventeen of his Homilies, rather laboured than eloquent, remain
to us: that in which he rises highest is, not unnaturally, his sermon on
S. Titus, Apostle of Crete. He died in the island of Hierissus, near
Mitylene, about the year 732.

As a poet, his most ambitious composition is the Great Canon; which,
partially used during other days of Lent, is sung right through on the
Thursday of Mid-Lent week, called, indeed, from that hymn. His Triodia
in Holy Week, and Canon on Mid-Pentecost, are fine; and he has a great
variety of spirited Idiomela scattered through the Triodion and
Pentecostarion.
