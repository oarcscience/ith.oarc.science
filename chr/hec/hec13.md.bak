### SECOND EPOCH.

A.D. 726 . . . A.D. 820.

The second period of Greek Hymnology is very nearly, as I said,
coincident with the Iconoclastic controversy. Its first writer, indeed,
died shortly after the commencement of that stormy age, and took no
share in its Councils or sufferings; while the last hymnographer who
bore a part in its proceedings, S. Joseph of the Studium, belongs to the
decline of his art. With these two exceptions, the ecclesiastical poets
of this period were [not](errata.htm#1.md) only thrown into the midst of
that great struggle, but, with scarcely one exception, took an active
share in it.

A few words on that conflict of one hundred

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

and sixteen years are absolutely necessary, if we would understand the
progress and full development of Greek Hymnography. No controversy has
been more grossly misapprehended; none, without the key of subsequent
events, could have been so difficult to appreciate. Till Calvinism, and
its daughter Rationalism, showed the ultimate development of Iconoclast
principles, it must have been well nigh impossible to realize the depth
of feeling on the side of the Church, or the greatness of the interests
attacked by her opponents. We may, perhaps, doubt whether even the
Saints of that day fully understood the character of the battle; whether
they did not give up ease, honour, possessions, life itself, rather from
an intuitive perception that their cause was the cause of the Catholic
faith, than from a logical appreciation of the results to which the
Image-destroyers were

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

tending. Just as in the early part of the Nestorian controversy, many
and many a simple soul must have felt intuitively that the title of
*Theotocos* was to be defended, without seeing the full consequences to
which its denial would subsequently lead. The supporters of Icons, by
universal consent, numbered amongst their ranks all that was pious and
venerable in the Eastern Church. The Iconoclasts seem to have been a
legitimate outbreak of that secret creeping Manichæism, which, under the
various names of Turlupins, Bogomili, or Good-men, so long devastated
<span class="smallcaps">Christ's</span> fold.

We must keep the landmarks of the controversy in sight. Commenced by Leo
the Isaurian, in A.D. 726, the persecution was carried on by his
despicable son, Constantine Copronymus, who also endeavoured to destroy
monasticism. The great Council of Constantinople, attended by

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 338 prelates, in
752, which rejected the use of images, was the culminating success of
the Iconoclasts. Lulling at the death of Constantine, the persecution
again raged in the latter years of his successor Leo, and was only
terminated by the death of that prince, and the succession of
Constantine and Irene. The Second Council of Nicæa, Seventh (Ecumenical
(A.D. 787), attended by 377 Bishops, seemed to end the heresy; but it
again broke out under the Iconoclast Emperor, Leo the Armenian (813),
and after having been carried on under the usurper Michael, and his son
Theophilus, ended with the death of the latter in 842. In the
Hymnographers of this epoch, it may be noticed that the Second Council
of Nicæa forms the culminating point of ecclesiastical poetry. Up to
that date, there is a vigour and freshness which the twenty-eight years
of

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

peace succeeding the Council corrupted, and that rapidly, with the
fashionable language of an effete court, and deluged with Byzantine
bombast.
