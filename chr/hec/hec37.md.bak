### CANON FOR CHRISTMAS DAY.

This is perhaps the finest, on the whole, of the Canons of Cosmas; and
may fairly be preferred to the rival composition of S. John Damascene.

### ODE I.

by S. Cosmas

Χριστὸς γεννᾶται· δοξάσατε

<span class="smallcaps">Christ</span> is born! Tell forth His fame!  
<span class="smallcaps">Christ</span> from Heaven! His love proclaim!  
<span class="smallcaps">Christ</span> on earth! Exalt His Name!  
Sing to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, O world, with
exultation!  
Break forth in glad thanksgiving, every nation!  
                For He hath triumphed gloriously!

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

Man, in <span class="smallcaps">God's</span> own Image made,  
Man, by Satan's wiles betrayed,  
Man, on whom corruption preyed,  
Shut out from hope of life and of salvation,  
To-day <span class="smallcaps">Christ</span> maketh him a new
creation,  
                For He hath triumphed gloriously!

For the Maker, when His foe,  
Wrought the creature death and woe,  
Bowed the Heav’ns, and came below, <span id="fr_3"></span>[\*](#fn_3.md)  
And in the Virgin's womb His dwelling making,  
Became true man, man's very nature taking;  
                For He hath triumphed gloriously!

He, the Wisdom, <span class="smallcaps">Word</span>, and Might,  
<span class="smallcaps">God</span>, and &lt;sc; Son, and Light of
light,  
Undiscovered by the sight <span id="page_132">p. 132</span>  
Of earthly monarch, or infernal spirit,  
Incarnate was, that we might Heav’n inherit;  
                For He hath triumphed gloriously!

\[<span class="small">In Mr. Young's book. The melody by Dr.
Schroeder.</span>\]

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_3"></span>[131:\*](hec37.htm#fr_3.md) The reference is, of
course, to Psalm xviii. 9; "He bowed the Heavens also, and came down."
