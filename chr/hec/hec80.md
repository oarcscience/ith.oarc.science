### THE RETURN HOME.

by S. Joseph of the Studium

  Safe home, safe home in port!  
  —Rent cordage, shattered deck,  
  Torn sails, provisions short,  
  And only not a wreck:  
But oh! the joy upon the shore  
To tell our voyage-perils o’er!

  The prize, the prize secure!  
  The athlete nearly tell;  
  Bare all he *could* endure,  
  And bare not always well:  
But he may smile at troubles gone  
Who sets the victor-garland on!

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

  No more the foe can harm:  
  No more of leaguer’d camp,  
  And cry of night-alarm,  
  And need of ready lamp:  
And yet how nearly he had failed,—  
How nearly had that foe prevailed!

  The lamb is in the fold  
  In perfect safety penn’d:  
  The lion once had hold,  
  And thought to make an end:  
But One came by with Wounded Side,  
And for the sheep the Shepherd died.

  The exile is at Home  
  —O nights and days of tears,  
  O longings not to roam,  
  O sins, and doubts, and fears,—  
What matter now (when so men say)  
The King has wip’d those tears away?

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

  O happy, happy Bride!  
  Thy widow’d hours are past,  
  The Bridegroom at thy side,  
  Thou all His own at last!  
The sorrows of thy former cup  
In full fruition swallow’d up!

\[<span class="small">No. 5 in H. E. C. This, of all the melodies
written for, or adapted to, these hymns, is my own especial favourite.
One feels that the anonymous writer of such a plaintive, yet soothing,
melody, must have been one—to quote Archbishop Trench's words with
regard to the author of Veni, Sancte Spiritus,— acquainted with great
sorrows, but also with great consolations.</span>\]
