John Damascene.</span>

\+ circ. A.D. 780.

S. John Damascene has the double honour of being the last but one of the
Fathers of the Eastern Church, and the greatest of her poets. It is
surprising, however, how little is known of his life. That he was born
of a good family at Damascus,—that he made great progress in
philosophy,—that he administered some charge under the Caliph,—that he
retired to the monastery of S. Sabas, in Palestine,—that he was the most
learned and eloquent writer with whom the Iconoclasts had to
contend,—that at a comparatively late period of life he was ordained
Priest of the Church of Jerusalem, and that he died after

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 754, and before
787, seems to comprise all that has reached us of his biography. His
enemies, from an unknown reason, called him *Mansur:* <span
id="fr_2"></span>[\*](#fn_2.md) whether he were the same with John Arklas,
also an ecclesiastical poet, is not so certain.

As a poet, he had a principal share in the Octoechus, of which I have
already spoken. His three great canons are those on Easter, the
Ascension, and S. Thomas's Sunday, the first and third of which I shall
give either wholly or in part. Probably, however, many of the Idiomela
and Stichera which are scattered about the office-books under the title
of *John* and *John the Hermit*, are his. His eloquent defence of Icons
has deservedly procured him the title of *The Doctor of Christian Art*.
