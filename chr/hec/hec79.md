### THE PILGRIMS OF JESUS

by S. Joseph of the Studium

O happy band of pilgrims,  
  If onward ye will tread  
With <span class="smallcaps">Jesus</span> as your Fellow  
  To <span class="smallcaps">Jesus</span> as your Head!

O happy, if ye labour  
  As <span class="smallcaps">Jesus</span> did for men:  
O happy, if ye hunger  
  As <span class="smallcaps">Jesus</span> hunger’d then!

The Cross that <span class="smallcaps">Jesus</span> carried  
  He carried as your due:  
The Crown that <span class="smallcaps">Jesus</span> weareth  
  He weareth it for you.

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

The Faith by which ye see Him,  
  The Hope, in which ye yearn,  
The Love that through all troubles  
  To Him alone will turn,—

What are they, but vaunt-couriers  
  To lead you to His Sight?  
What are they, save the effluence  
  Of Uncreated Light?

The trials that beset you,  
  The sorrows ye endure,  
The manifold temptations  
  That Death alone can cure,—

What are they, but His jewels  
  Of right celestial worth?  
What are they but the ladder,  
  Set up to Heav’n on earth?

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

O happy band of pilgrims,  
  Look upward to the skies:—  
Where such a light affliction  
  Shall win you such a prize!
