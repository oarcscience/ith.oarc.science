### PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> following Translations have occupied
a portion of my leisure time for me last twelve years: and some of them
have already appeared in more than one ecclesiastical periodical. So has
also great part of the Introduction. It is a most remarkable fact, and
one which shows how very little interest has been hitherto felt in the
Eastern Church, that these are literally, I believe, the only English
versions of any part of the treasures of Oriental Hymnology. There is
scarcely a first or second-rate hymn of the Roman Breviary which has not
been translated: of many we have six or eight versions. The eighteen
quarto volumes of Greek Church-poetry

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

can only at present be known to the English reader by my little book.

Yet surely, if in the future Hymnal of the English Church we are to
build an eclectic superstructure on the foundation of the Sarum Book,
the East ought to yield its full share of compositions. And hence, I
cannot but marvel that the compilers of eclectic Hymnals, such as the
(modern) Sarum, the *Hymns Ancient and Modern*, and others, have never
turned to this source. Here was a noble field open to them; and to me it
is incomprehensible that they should have so utterly neglected it.

There are difficulties in the task to which it is as well to revert.
Though the superior terseness and brevity of the Latin Hymns renders a
translation which shall represent those qualities a work of great
labour, yet still the versifier has the help of the same metre; his
version may be line for

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

line; and there is a great analogy between the Collects and the Hymns,
most helpful to the translator. Above all, we have examples enough of
former translation by which we may take pattern.

But in attempting a Greek Canon, from the fact of its being in
prose,—(metrical Hymns, as the reader will learn, are unknown,)—one is
all at sea. What measure shall we employ? why this more than that? Might
we attempt the rhythmical prose of the original, and design it to be
chanted?—Again, the great length of the Canons renders them unsuitable
for our churches, as *wholes*. Is it better simply to form centos of the
more beautiful passages? or can separate Odes, each necessarily
imperfect, be employed as separate Hymns? And above all, we have no
pattern or example of any kind to direct our labour.

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

These questions, and many others, have as yet received no reply; but
will, in time, no doubt, work out their answer. My own belief is, that
the best way to employ Greek Hymnology for the uses of the English
Church would be by centos.

The reader will find, in the following pages, examples of different
methods of treatment. The following are short *Idiomela*, &c., which
might serve as separate Hymns:—

5\. *The day is past and over*. (Evening.)

20\. *O the mystery, passing wonder*. (Maundy Thursday.)

28\. *Christian! dost thou see them?* (A Sunday in Lent.)

35\. *By fruit the ancient foe's device*. (Easter Tide.)

65\. *Those eternal bowers*. (All Saints.)

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

84\. *The choirs of ransomed Israel*. (Transfiguration.)

124\. *Are thy toils and woes increasing?* (Passion or Holy Week.)

Centos might perhaps be made from

| „             | „           | p\. | 176\. |

I trust the reader will not forget the immense difficulty of an attempt
so perfectly new as the present, where I have had no predecessors, and
therefore could have no master. If I have opened the way for others to
do better what I have done imperfectly, I shall have every reason to be
thankful. I have kept most of the translations by me for at least the
nine years recommended

by Horace; and now offer them as a contribution to the hymnology of our
own Church. And while fully sensible of their imperfections, I may yet
(by way of excuse rather than of boast) say, almost in Bishop Hall's
words—
