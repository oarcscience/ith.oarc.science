### THE GREAT CANON, <span class="small">CALLED ALSO</span> THE KING OF CANONS.

by S. Andrew of Crete.

It would be unpardonable not to give a portion of that which the Greeks
regard as the King of Canons—the Great Canon of the Mid-Lent week. It is
a collection of Scriptural examples, turned to the purpose of
penitential Confession. It is impossible to deny the beauty of many
stanzas, and the ingenuity of some tropological applications. But the
immense length of the Canon, for it exceeds three hundred stanzas, and
its necessary tautology, must render it wearisome, unless devotionally
used under the peculiar circumstances for which it is appointed. The
following is a part of the earlier portion.

Πόθεν ἄρξομαι θρηνεῖν;

    Whence shall my tears begin?  
    What first-fruits shall I bear  
  Of earnest sorrow for my sin?  
    Or how my woes declare? <span id="page_79">p. 79</span>  
O Thou! the Merciful and Gracious One  
Forgive the foul transgressions I have done.

    With Adam I have vied,  
    Yea, pass’d him, in my fall;  
  And I am naked now, by pride  
    And lust made bare of all;  
Of Thee, O <span class="smallcaps">God</span>, and that Celestial
Band,  
And all the glory of the Promised Land.

    No earthly Eve beguil’d  
    My body into sin:  
  A spiritual temptress smiled,  
    Concupiscence within:  
Unbridled passion grasp’d the unhallow’d sweet:  
Most bitter—ever bitter—was the meat.

    If Adam's righteous doom,  
    Because he dared transgress  
  Thy one decree, lost Eden's bloom  
    And Eden's loveliness: <span id="page_80">p. 80</span>  
What recompence, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, must I expect,  
Who all my life Thy quickening laws neglect?

    By mine own act, like Cain,  
    A murderer was I made:  
  By mine own act my soul was slain,  
    When Thou wast disobeyed:  
And lusts each day are quickened, warring still  
Against Thy grace with many a deed of ill.

    Thou formed’st me of clay,  
    O Heav’nly Potter! Thou  
  In fleshly vesture didst array,  
    With life and breath endow.  
Thou Who didst make, didst ransom, and dost know,  
To Thy repentant creature pity show!

    My guilt for vengeance cries;  
    But yet Thou pardonest all, <span id="page_81">p. 81</span>  
  And whom Thou lov’st Thou dost chastise,  
    And mourn’st for them that fall:  
Thou, as a Father, mark’st our tears and pain,  
And welcomest the prodigal again.

    I lie before Thy door,  
    O turn me not away!  
  Nor in mine old age give me o’er  
    To Satan for a prey!  
But ere the end of life and term of grace,  
Thou Merciful! my many sins efface!

    The Priest beheld, and pass’d  
    The way he had to go:  
  A careless glance the Levite cast,  
    And left me to my woe:  
But Thou, O <span class="smallcaps">Jesu</span>, Mary’s Son, console,  
Draw nigh, and succour me, and make me whole!

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

    Thou Spotless Lamb divine,  
    Who takest sins away,  
  Remove, remove, the load that mine  
    Upon my conscience lay:  
And, of Thy tender mercy, grant Thou me  
To find remission of iniquity!
