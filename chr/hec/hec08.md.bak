### S. Anatolius.

### + 458.

The first poet who emancipated himself from the tyranny of the old
laws—hence to be compared to Venantius Fortunatus in the West—and who
boldly struck out the new path of harmonious prose, was S. Anatolius of
Constantinople. His commencements were not promising. He had been
*apocrisiarius*, or legate, from the arch-heretic Dioscorus, to the
Emperor's Court: and at the death of S. Flavian, in consequence of the
violence received in the "*Robbers’ Meeting*" at Ephesus, A.D. 449, was,
by the influence of his Pontiff, raised to the vacant throne of
Constantinople. He soon, however, vindicated his orthodoxy: and in the
Council of Chalcedon, he procured

the enactment of the famous 28th Canon, by which, (in spite of all the
efforts of Rome,) Constantinople was raised to the second place among
Patriarchal Sees. Having governed his Church eight years in peace, he
departed to his rest in A.D. 458. His compositions are not numerous, and
are almost all short, but they are usually very spirited.
