### S. THOMAS'S SUNDAY.

by S. John Damascene.

<span class="small">The four following Odes are the first four of our
Saint's Canon for S. Thomas's Sunday, called also Renewal Sunday: with
us Low Sunday. The first Stanzas are marked with inverted commas, as
being *Hirmoi*.</span>

### ODE I.

ἄσωμεν πάντες λαοί.

"Come, ye faithful, raise the strain  
  "Of triumphant gladness  
"<span class="smallcaps">God</span> hath brought His Israel  
  "Into joy from sadness:  
"Loosed from Pharaoh's bitter yoke  
  "Jacob's sons and daughters;  
"Led them with unmoistened foot  
  "Through the Red Sea waters."

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

’Tis the Spring of souls to-day;  
  <span class="smallcaps">Christ</span> hath burst His prison;  
And from three days' sleep in death,  
 —As a sun, hath risen.  
All the winter of our sins,  
  Long and dark, is flying  
From His Light, to Whom we give  
  Laud and praise undying.

Now the Queen of Seasons, bright  
  With the day of Splendour,  
With the royal Feast of feasts,  
  Comes its joy to render;  
Comes to glad Jerusalem,  
  Who with true affection  
Welcomes, in unwearied strains,  
  <span class="smallcaps">Jesu's</span> Resurrection.

Neither might the gates of death,  
  Nor the tomb's dark portal, <span id="page_120">p. 120</span>  
Nor the watchers, nor the seal,  
  Hold Thee as a mortal:  
But to-day amidst the Twelve  
  Thou didst stand, bestowing  
That Thy peace, which evermore  
  Passeth human knowing.

*Catavasia*. "’Tis the day of Resurrection." (p. 38.)
