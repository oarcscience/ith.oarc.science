Canon for Christmas Day

### ODE VI.

by S. Cosmas

σπλάγχνων Ἰωνᾶν.

As Jonah, issuing from his three days’ tomb,  
  At length was cast, uninjured, on the earth;  
So, from the Virgin's unpolluted womb  
  The Incarnate <span class="smallcaps">Word</span>, That dwelt there,
had His Birth:  
For He, Who knew no taint of mortal stain,  
Willed that His Mother spotless should remain.

<span class="smallcaps">Christ</span> comes, Incarnate <span
class="smallcaps">God</span>, amongst us now,  
  Begotten of the <span class="smallcaps">Father</span> ere the day:  
And He, to Whom the sinless legions bow,  
  Lies cradled, ’midst unconscious beasts on hay:  
And, by His homely swaddling-bands girt in,  
Looses the many fetters of our sin.

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

Now the New Child of Adam's race draws nigh,  
  To us, the faithful, given: This, this is He  
That shall the Father of Eternity,  
  The Angel of the Mighty Counsel, be:  
This the eternal <span class="smallcaps">God</span>, by Whose strong
hands  
The fabric of the world supported stands.
