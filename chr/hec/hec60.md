### LET OUR CHOIR NEW ANTHEMS RAISE.

<span class="small">A Cento from the Canon for SS. Timothy and Maura;
May 3rd.</span>

by S. Joseph of the Studium

τῶν ἱερῶν ἀθλοφόρων.

Let our Choir new anthems raise:  
  Wake the morn with gladness:  
<span class="smallcaps">God</span> Himself to joy and praise  
  Turns the Martyrs’ sadness:  
This the day that won their crown,  
  Opened Heav’n's bright portal;  
As they laid the mortal down.  
  And put on th’ immortal.

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

Never flinched they from the flame,  
  From the torture, never;  
Vain the foeman's sharpest aim,  
  Satan's best endeavour:  
For by faith they saw the Land  
  Decked in all its glory,  
Where triumphant now they stand  
  With the victor's story.

Faith they had that knew not shame,  
  Love that could not languish;  
And eternal Hope o’ercame  
  Momentary anguish.  
He Who trod the self-same road,  
  Death and Hell defeated;  
Wherefore these their passions show'd  
  Calvary repeated.

Up and follow, Christian men!  
  Press through toil and sorrow! <span id="page_203">p. 203</span>  
Spurn the night of fear, and then,—  
  Oh the glorious morrow!  
Who will venture on the strife?  
  Who will first begin it?  
Who will seize the Land of Life?  
  Warriors, up and win it?
