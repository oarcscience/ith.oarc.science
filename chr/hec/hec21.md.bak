### CANON FOR EASTER DAY,

##### CALLED THE "GOLDEN CANON," OR, THE "QUEEN OF CANONS."

by S. John Damascene.

The circumstances under which the Canon is sung are thus eloquently
described by a modern writer. The scene is at Athens.

"As midnight approached, the Archbishop, with his priests, accompanied
by the King and Queen, left the Church, and stationed themselves on the
platform, which was raised considerably from the ground, so that they
were distinctly seen by the people. Every one now remained in breathless
expectation, holding their unlighted tapers in readiness when the glad
moment should arrive, while the priests still continued murmuring their
melancholy chant in a low half-whisper. Suddenly a single report

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

of a cannon announced that twelve o'clock had struck, and that Easter
day had begun; then the old Archbishop elevating the cross, exclaimed in
a loud exulting tone, 'Christos anesti!' '<span
class="smallcaps">Christ</span> is risen!' and instantly every single
individual of all that host took up the cry, and the vast multitude
broke through and dispelled for ever the intense and mournful silence
which they had maintained so long, with one spontaneous shout of
indescribable joy and triumph, '<span class="smallcaps">Christ</span> is
risen!' '<span class="smallcaps">Christ</span> is risen!' At the same
moment, the oppressive darkness was succeeded by a blaze of light from
thousands of tapers, which, communicating one from another, seemed to
send streams of fire in all directions, rendering the minutest objects
distinctly visible, and casting the most vivid glow on the expressive
faces full of exultation, of the rejoicing crowd; bands of music struck
up their gayest strains; the roll of

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

the drum through the town, and further on the pealing of the cannon
announced far and near these 'glad tidings of great joy;' while from
hill and plain, from the sea-shore and the far olive-grove, rocket after
rocket ascending to the clear sky, answered back with their mute
eloquence, that <span class="smallcaps">Christ</span> is risen indeed,
and told of other tongues that were repeating those blessed words, and
other hearts that leap for joy; everywhere men clasped each other's
hands, and congratulated one another, and embraced with countenances
beaming with delight, as though to each one separately some wonderful
happiness had been proclaimed and so in truth it was and all the while,
rising above the mingling of many sounds, each one of which was a sound
of gladness, the aged priests were distinctly heard chanting forth a
glorious old hymn of victory in tones so loud and clear, that they
seemed to have regained

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

their youth and strength to tell the world how  '<span
class="smallcaps">Christ</span> is risen from the dead, having trampled
death beneath His feet, and henceforth they that are in the tombs have
everlasting life.'"

That which follows is the "glorious old Hymn of Victory."
