THE LATE REV. DR. NEALE,

<span class="small">SACKVILLE COLLEGE, EAST GRINSTED.</span>

'It had long been my wish, especially when I had occasion to notice the
great favour which <span class="smallcaps">God</span> had bestowed on my
translations from Mediæval Hymnology, to collect some of my own Hymns
and Sequences as a poor little offering to the Great Treasury. Laid
aside in spring last from all active work by a severe and dangerous
illness, the wish was more strongly impressed on my mind, and I felt
that no kind of composition could be more suitable for one who might
soon be called to have done with earthly composition for ever.'—Preface
(1866).

<span class="small">BY</span>

THE LATE DR. NEALE.

'The companion Sequence to the *Stabat Mater Dolorosa* is now presented
to the reader—*Stabat Mater Speciosa;* this is the hymn of the Cradle,
as the other of the Cross. . . . I cannot but wonder that it has never
hitherto appeared in an English translation; nor even, so far as I know,
been reprinted in this country.'—*Author's Preface*.

\*<sub>\*</sub>\* *The above Work, and the* <span
class="smallcaps">Original Sequences</span>, *were the last efforts of*
<span class="smallcaps">Dr. Neale</span> *on his Sick Bed, and were only
finished two or three days before his decease*.

THE LATE DR. NEALE.

'And Bernard, minstrel of the Cross;  
  And Bernard, who with home-sick view,  
Counting all other joys but loss,  
  <span class="smallcaps">Jerusalem the Golden</span> drew.'  
                  *Neale's Original Sequences*.

This <span class="smallcaps">Rhythm</span> is that which will most
surely enshrine <span class="smallcaps">John Mason Neale's</span> memory
in the Church of England as a dear and honoured treasure. His song will
long he the solace of sad hearts on earth, but he is now learning a
brighter and sweeter one.' *Dr. Littledales Preface to the Eighth
Edition*.

and Glories of Paradise</span>.

<span class="small">BY</span>

THE LATE DR. NEALE.

Dr. <span class="smallcaps">Neale</span> has intended this volume as a
companion to his translation of "Bernard of Morlaix," but it is much
more miscellaneous in its contents, which, were it not for the gravity
and unity of their subjects, would be almost grotesquely
varied.'—*Guardian*.

'This little book contains some perfect gems.'—*Ecclesiastic*.

<span class="small">BY</span>

THE LATE DR. NEALE.

<span class="small">WITH PREFACE BY DR. LITTLEDALE.</span>

'The hymns in this neat little collection are selected from various
volumes of his Sacred Poetry, and are admirably suited to form a
companion to his "Readings for the Aged." Almost all of them are
well-known favourites with persons acquainted with Dr. <span
class="smallcaps">Neale's</span> poetry, and they are such as to lead
those who are yet strangers to it to lose no time in filling up this gap
in their knowledge of contemporary poetry.'—*Literary Churchman*.

'This beautiful collection should be in the hands of every one who
visits the sick.'—*Church Review*.

Song of Songs:</span>

A VOLUME OF SERMONS THEREON.

<span class="small">BY</span>

THE LATE DR. NEALE.

\*<sub>\*</sub>\* *Many Sermons have been added which have never
hitherto been published*.

'Its style is that of Dr. <span class="smallcaps">Neale</span>
himself—peculiar, forcible, attractive, epigrammatic, and thoroughly
original; while the Biblical knowledge displayed in it, and the deep
lessons brought out by a mystical treatment of words of Sacred Writ,
would no doubt astonish some professing Bible Christians of another
school.'—*Union Review*.
