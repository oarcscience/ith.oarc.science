### <span style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">S. Theophanes.</span>

A.D. 759 . . . A.D. 818.

S. Theophanes, who holds the third place among Greek Church-poets, was
born in 759, his father being Governor of the Archipelago. Betrothed in
childhood to a lady named Megalis, he persuaded her, on their
wedding-day, to embrace the monastic life. He retired to the monastery
of Syngriana, in the early part of the reign of Constantine and Irene.
From the fiftieth year of his age he was nearly bedridden; but his
devotion to the cause of Icons marked him out as one of the earliest
victims of Leo the Armenian, who, after imprisoning him for two

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

years, banished him to Samothrace. On the third day after his arrival in
that inhospitable region, worn out with sufferings and sickness, he
departed this life: A.D. 818. He is chiefly famous for his History, with
which we have now nothing to do. With the one exception of S. Joseph of
the Studium, Theophanes is the most prolific of Eastern Hymnographers;
and in his writings we first see that which has been the bane and ruin
of later Greek poetry, the composition of hymns, not from the
spontaneous effusion of the heart, but because they were wanted to fill
up a gap in the Office-book.

Because the great festivals and the chief Saints of the Church had their
Canon and their Stichera, therefore, every martyr, every confessor, who
happened to give his name to a day, must have his Canon and Stichera
also, just for uniformity. How different the Latin use, where not even
the

Apostles have separate hymns received by the whole Church, but supply
themselves from the Common! Hence the deluge of worthless compositions
that occur in the Menæa: hence tautology, repeated till it becomes
almost sickening; the merest commonplace, again and again decked in the
tawdry shreds of tragic language, and twenty or thirty times presenting
the same thought in slightly varying terms. Theophanes, indeed, must be
distinguished from the host of inferior writers that about his time
began to overwhelm the Church. Many of his subjects are of world-wide
interest. The Eastern martyrs, whom he celebrates, are, for the most
part, those who have won for themselves the greatest name in the annals
of history. But still we find him thus honouring some, of whom all that
can be said is, that they died for the Name of <span
class="smallcaps">Christ</span>. And though the poet brings more matter
to his task

than do others, many long stanzas, that keep pretty close to their
subject, concerning a Saint of whom there is nothing especial to say,
must become tedious.
