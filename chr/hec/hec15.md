### STICHERA FOR GREAT THURSDAY.

by S. Andrew of Crete.

τὸ μέγα μυστήριον.

O the mystery, passing wonder,  
  When, reclining at the board,  
"Eat," Thou saidst to Thy Disciples,  
  "That True Bread with quickening stored:  
"Drink in faith the healing Chalice  
  "From a dying <span class="smallcaps">God</span> outpoured."

Then the glorious upper chamber  
  A celestial tent was made,  
When the bloodless rite was offered,  
  And the soul's true service paid, <span id="page_74">p. 74</span>  
And the table of the feasters  
  As an altar stood displayed.

<span class="smallcaps">Christ</span> is now our mighty Pascha,  
  Eaten for our mystic bread:  
Take we of His broken Body,  
  Drink we of the Blood He shed,  
As a lamb led out to slaughter,  
  And for this world offered.

To the Twelve spake Truth eternal,  
  To the Branches spake the Vine:  
"Never more from this day forward  
  Shall I taste again this wine,  
Till I drink it in the kingdom  
  Of My <span class="smallcaps">Father</span>, and with Mine."

Thou hast stretched those hands for silver  
  That had held the Immortal Food; <span id="page_75">p. 75</span>  
With those lips that late had tasted  
  Of the Body and the Blood,  
Thou hast given the kiss, O Judas;  
  Thou hast heard the woe bestowed.

<span class="smallcaps">Christ</span> to all the world gives banquet  
  On that most celestial Meat:  
Him, albeit with lips all earthly,  
  Yet with holy hearts we greet:  
Him, the sacrificial Pascha,  
  Priest and Victim all complete.

\[In Mr. Young's book. Melody of *Pange lingua*, harmonised by Dr.
Schroeder. I may add that I purposely chose this Stanza to suit the
melody of S. Thomas's great hymn.\]
