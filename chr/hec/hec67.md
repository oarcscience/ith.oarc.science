Canon for Ascension Day

### ODE VI.

by S. Joseph of the Studium

ῥανάτωσαν ἠμῖν ἄνωθεν,

R   ain down, ye heav'ns, eternal bliss!  
      The Cherub-cloud to-day  
    Bears <span class="smallcaps">Jesus</span> where His Father is,  
      Along the starry way!

S   under’d of old were Heaven and Earth:  
      But Thou, Incarnate King!  
    Hast made them one by that Thy Birth,  
      And this Thy triumphing.

'T   hy victor-raiment, wherefore red?  
      What mean the marks of pain  
    That print Thy form?'—the Angels said,  
      The ascending Monarch's train.

*Catavasía*.

V   ery Oblation, by the scourges torn!  
    Nailed to the bitter Cross, O Virgin-born!  
    As once the Prophet from the monster's maw,  
    So now Thy love, accomplishing the Law,  
    Adam from utter death to perfect Life would draw.

*Oicos*.

τὰ τῆς γῆς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.

V   anities earthly in earth will we lay,  
    Ashes with ashes, the dust with the clay:  
    Lift up the heart, and the eye, and the love,  
    Lift up thyself, to the regions above:  
    Since the Immortal hath entered of late,  
    Mortals may pass at the heavenly gate.

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

    Stand we on Olivet: mark Him ascend,  
    Whose is the glory and might without end;  
    There, with His own ones, the Giver of Good  
    Blessing them once more, a little while stood.  
    "Nothing can part us,—nor distance, nor foes,  
    Lo! I am for you, and who can oppose?"
