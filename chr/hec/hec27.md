Canon for Easter Day

### ODE VII.

by S. John Damascene.

Ὁ παῖδας ἐκ καμίνου.

Who from the fiery furnace saved the Three,  
Suffers as mortal; that, His Passion o’er,  
This mortal, triumphing o’er death, might be  
Vested with immortality once more:  
    He Whom our fathers still confest  
    <span class="smallcaps">God</span> over all, for ever blest.

The women with their ointment seek the Tomb:  
And Whom they mourned as dead, with many a tear,  
They worship now, joy dawning on their gloom,  
As Living <span class="smallcaps">God</span>, as mystic Passover;  
    Then to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord's</span> Disciples gave  
    The tidings of the vanquished grave.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

We keep the festal of the death of death;  
Of hell o’erthrown: the first-fruits pure and bright,  
Of life eternal; and with joyous breath  
Praise Him that won the victory by His might:  
    Him Whom our fathers still confest  
    <span class="smallcaps">God</span> over all, for ever blest.

All hallowed festival, in splendour born!  
Night of salvation and of glory! Night  
Fore-heralding the Resurrection morn!  
When from the tomb the everlasting Light,  
    A glorious frame once more his own,  
    Upon the world in splendour shone.
