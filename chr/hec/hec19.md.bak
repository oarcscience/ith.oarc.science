style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">S.
Germanus</span>

A.D. 631 . . . A D 734.

S. Germanus of Constantinople was born in that city about 634. His
father, Justinian, a patrician, had the ill-fortune to excite the
jealousy of the Emperor Constantine Pogonatus, who put him to death, and
obliged Germanus to enrol himself among the Clergy of the Great Church.
Here he became distinguished for piety and learning, and in process of
time was made Bishop of Cyzicus. In this capacity he assisted, with S.
Andrew of Crete, in the Synod of Constantinople of which I have just
spoken: and no doubt, he might be the more favourably disposed to
Monothelitism, because he had been so deeply injured by its great
opponent, Pogonatus. However, he also,

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

at a late period, expressly condemned that heresy. Translated to the
throne of Constantinople in 715, he governed his Patriarchate for some
time in tranquillity. At the beginning of the attack of Leo the Isaurian
on Icons, his letters, in opposition to the Imperial mandate, were the
first warnings which the Church received of the impending storm.
Refusing to sign the decrees of the Synod which was convoked by that
Emperor in A.D. 730, and stripping off his Patriarchal robes, with the
words—"It is impossible for me, Sire, to innovate, without the sanction
of the Œcumenical Council," he was driven from his See, not, it is said,
without blows, and returned to his own house at Platanias, where he
thenceforth led a quiet and private life. He died shortly afterwards,
aged about one hundred years, and is regarded by the Greeks as one of
their most glorious Confessors.

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

The poetical compositions of S. Germanus are few.

He has stanzas on S. Simeon Stylites, on the Prophet Elias, and on the
Decollation of S. John Baptist. His most poetical work is perhaps his
Canon on the Wonder-working Image in Edessa. But probably the following
simpler stanzas, for Sunday in the Week of the First Tone, will better
commend themselves to the English reader.

By fruit, the ancient Foe's device  
Drave Adam forth from Paradise:  
<span class="smallcaps">Christ</span>, by the cross of shame and pain,  
Brought back the dying Thief again:  
"When in Thy kingdom, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>," said he,  
"Thou shalt return, remember me!"

Thy Holy Passion we adore  
And Resurrection evermore: <span id="page_88">p. 88</span>  
With heart and voice to Thee on high,  
As Adam and the Thief we cry:  
"When in Thy kingdom Thou shalt be  
"Victor o’er all things, think of me!"

Thou, after three appointed days,  
Thy Body's Temple didst upraise:  
And Adam's children, one and all,  
With Adam, to New Life didst call:  
"When Thou," they cry, "shalt Victor be  
"In that Thy kingdom, think of me!"

Early, O <span class="smallcaps">Christ</span>, to find Thy Tomb,  
The weeping Ointment-bearers come:  
The Angel, cloth’d in white, hath said,  
"Why seek the <span class="smallcaps">Living</span> with the dead?  
"The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Life hath burst death's
chain,  
"Whom here ye mourn and seek in vain."

The Apostles, on Thy Vision bent,  
To that appointed mountain went: <span id="page_89">p. 89</span>  
And there they worship when they see,  
And there the message comes from Thee,  
That every race beneath the skies  
They should disciple and baptize.

We praise the <span class="smallcaps">Father</span>, <span
class="smallcaps">God</span> on High,  
The Holy <span class="smallcaps">Son</span> we magnify:  
Nor less our praises shall adore  
The <span class="smallcaps">Holy Ghost</span> for evermore;  
This grace, Blest <span class="smallcaps">Trinity</span>, we crave;  
Thy suppliant servants hear and save.
