### TRANSFIGURATION.

by S. Cosmas

I shall, perhaps, render the following Canon more acceptable to most
readers if, instead of translating the Odes in detail, I make a cento
from the more remarkable Troparia.

They are principally from the first four Odes.

χορὸς Ἰσραήλ.

The choirs of ransomed Israel,  
  The Red Sea’s passage o’er,  
Uprais’d the hymn of triumph  
  Upon the further shore:  
And shouted, as the foeman  
  Was whelm’d beneath the sea,—  
'Sing we to Judah's Saviour,  
  For glorified is He!'

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

Amongst His Twelve Apostles  
  <span class="smallcaps">Christ</span> spake the Words of Life,  
And show’d a realm of beauty  
  Beyond a world of strife:  
'When all My <span class="smallcaps">Father's</span> glory  
  Shall shine expressed in Me,  
Then praise Him, then exalt Him,  
  For magnified is He!'

Upon the Mount of Tabor  
  The promise was made good;  
When, baring all the Godhead,  
  In light itself He stood:  
And they, in awe beholding,  
  The Apostolic Three,  
Sang out to <span class="smallcaps">God</span> their Saviour,  
  For magnified was He!

In days of old, on Sinai,  
  The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Sabaoth came, <span
id="page_152">p. 152</span>  
In majesty of terror,  
  In thunder-cloud and flame:  
On Tabor, with the glory  
  Of sunniest light for vest,  
The excellence of beauty  
  In <span class="smallcaps">Jesus</span> was express’d.

All hours and days inclin’d there,  
  And did Thee worship meet,  
The sun himself adored Thee,  
  And bow’d him at Thy feet:  
White Moses and Elias,  
  Upon the Holy Mount,  
The co-eternal glory  
  Of <span class="smallcaps">Christ</span> our <span
class="smallcaps">God</span> recount.

O holy, wonderous Vision!  
  But what, when this life past,  
The beauty of Mount Tabor  
  Shall end in Heav’n at last? <span id="page_153">p. 153</span>  
But what, when all the glory  
  Of uncreated light  
Shall be the promis’d guerdon  
  Of them that win the fight?
