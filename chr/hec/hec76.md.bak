*Hymns of the Eastern Church*, by J.M. Neale, \[1884\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

### <span style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">John Mauropus.</span>

\+ A.D. 1060.

John Mauropus, Metropolitan of Euchaïta, sometimes called the last of
the Greek Fathers, left a number of hymns, printed at Eton in 1610; and
if not boasting much poetical fire, at least graced with a gentle and
Isocratean eloquence. As they have not been employed by the Church, they
claim no further notice here.

With this Metropolitan, Greek Hymnology well-nigh ceased: at least the
only other name that need be mentioned is that of Philotheus, Patriarch
of Constantinople, who died in 1376. This man, the warm supporter of the
dogma of the *Uncreated Light*, was the composer of several stanzas for
Orthodoxy Sunday, and the Canon for July 16th, on the Holy Fathers: both
in the very worst taste.
