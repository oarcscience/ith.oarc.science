Canon for Christmas Day

### ODE VII.

by S. Cosmas

οἱ παῖδες εὐσεβείᾳ.

The Holy Children boldly stand  
Against the tyrant's fierce command:  
The kindled furnace they defy,—  
No doom can shake their constancy  
They in the midmost flame confess’d,  
"<span class="smallcaps">God</span> of our Fathers! Thou art bless’d!"

The Shepherds keep their flocks by night;  
The Heav’n glows out with wondrous light;  
The glory of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is there,  
The Angel-bands their King declare:  
The watchers of the night confess’d,  
"<span class="smallcaps">God</span> of our Fathers! Thou art bless’d!"

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

The Angel ceas’d; and suddenly  
Seraphic legions fill’d the sky:  
"Glory to <span class="smallcaps">God</span>," they cry again:  
"Peace upon earth, good will to men:  
"<span class="smallcaps">Christ</span> comes! "—And they that heard
confess’d,  
"<span class="smallcaps">God</span> of our fathers! Thou art bless’d!"

What said the Shepherds?—"Let us turn  
This new-born miracle to learn."  
To Bethlehem’s gate their footsteps drew:  
The Mother with the Child they view:  
They knelt and worshipp’d, and confess’d,  
"<span class="smallcaps">God</span> of our Fathers! Thou art bless’d!"
