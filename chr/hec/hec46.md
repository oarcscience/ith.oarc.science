\+ A.D. 806.

Tarasius, raised by Constantine and Irene from the post of Secretary of
State, at one step, though a layman, to the Patriarchate of
Constantinople, (A.D. 784) was the chief mover in the restoration of
Icons and the Second Council of Nicæa. Strongly opposing the divorce of
Constantine from Maria, he refused to celebrate that Emperor's nuptials
with Theodora. But when they had been performed, he was with some
difficulty persuaded to pardon the priest who had officiated at them. On
this, S. Plato, and the monks of the all-influential Studium, forsook
his communion;

nor was the schism composed till the Patriarch yielded and retracted his
pardon. He died February 25th, A.D. 806, on which day he is commemorated
both by the East and West. His hymns are unimportant. The longest is the
Canon on the Invention of S. John Baptist, May 25th. It is in no wise
remarkable. Nor do I know any of his compositions which would be
sufficiently interesting to the English reader, to make it worth
versification here.
