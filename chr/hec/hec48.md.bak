### IDIOMELA

### ON FRIDAY OF CHEESE-SUNDAY,

##### THAT IS,

### OF QUINQUAGESIMA.

by S. Theophanes

<span class="small">At this period of the year the weeks are named, not
from the Sundays that precede, but from those that follow them.
Quinquagesima is termed Tyrophagus, because up to that time, but not
beyond, cheese is allowed. The Friday previous is appropriated to the
Commemoration of All Holy Ascetes; in order, as the Synaxarion says,
that, by the remembrance of their conflict, we may be invigorated for
the race that is set before us.</span>

Δεῦτε ἃπαντες πιστοί.

Hither, and with one accord,  
Sing the servants of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>:  
Sing each great ascetic sire:—  
Anthony shall lead the choir: <span id="page_161">p. 161</span>  
Let Euthymius next him stand;  
Then in order all the band.  
Make we joyous celebration  
Of their heavenly conversation;  
Of their glory, how they rise,  
Like another Paradise;  
These the trees our <span class="smallcaps">God</span> hath plac’d,  
Trees, with fruit immortal grac’d;  
Bringing forth, for <span class="smallcaps">Christ</span> on high,  
Flowers of Life that cannot die;  
With the sweetness that they fling  
Mortal spirits nourishing.  
    Filled with <span class="smallcaps">God</span>, and ever blest,  
    For our pardon make request!

Egypt, hail, thou faithful strand!  
Hail, thou holy Libyan land!  
Nurturing for the realm on high  
Such a glorious company! <span id="page_162">p. 162</span>  
They by many a toil intense,  
Chastity and continence,  
Perfect men to <span class="smallcaps">God</span> upreared,  
Stars to guide us have appeared:  
They, by many a glorious sign,  
Many a beam of Power Divine,  
To the earth's remotest shore  
Far and wide their radiance pour.  
    Holy Fathers, bright and blest,  
    For our pardon make request!

By what skill of mortal tongue  
Shall your wondrous acts be sung?  
All the conflicts of the soul,  
All your struggles towards the goal;  
And your virtues' prize immense,  
And your victories over sense,  
How perpetual watch ye kept  
Over passion, prayed and wept: <span id="page_163">p. 163</span>  
Yea, every angels came,  
Visible in earthly frame,  
And with Satan girt for fight  
Utterly o’erthrew his might.  
Fam’d for signs and wonders rare,  
Join to ours, great Saints, your prayer:  
    Ask that we, ye ever blest,  
    May attain the Land of Rest!
