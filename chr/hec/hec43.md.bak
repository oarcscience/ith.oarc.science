Canon for Christmas Day

### ODE VIII.

by S. Cosmas

θαύματος ὑπερφυοῦς ἡ δροσοβόλος.

The dewy freshness that the furnace flings  
Works out a wond'rous type of future things:  
Nor did the flame the Holy Three consume,  
Nor did the Godhead's fire thy frame entomb,  
  Thou, on Whose bosom hung the <span class="smallcaps">Word</span>:  
  Wherefore we cry with hearts endeavour,  
  "Let all Creation bless the Loin,  
  And magnify His Name for ever!"

Babel's proud daughter once led David's race  
From Sion, to their exile's woful place:  
Babel now bids her wise men, gifts in hand,  
Before King David's Royal Daughter stand, <span id="page_146">p.
146</span>  
  The Mother of the Incarnate Word:  
  Wherefore we cry with heart's endeavour,  
  "Let all Creation bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,  
  And magnify His Name for ever!"

From music grief held back the exile's hand:  
"How sing the <span class="smallcaps">Lord's</span> song in an alien
land?"  
But Babel's exile here is done away,  
And Bethlehem's harmony this glorious day  
  By Thee, Incarnate <span class="smallcaps">God</span>, restored:  
  Wherefore we cry with heart's endeavour,  
  "Let all Creation bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,  
  And magnify His Name for ever!"

Of old victorious Babel bore away,  
The spoils of Royal Sion and her prey:  
But Babel's treasure now, and Babel's kings,  
<span class="smallcaps">Christ</span>, by the guiding star, to Sion
brings, <span id="page_147">p. 147</span>  
  There they knelt, and there ador’d:  
  Wherefore we cry with heart's endeavour,  
  Let all Creation bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,  
  And magnify His Name for ever!"
