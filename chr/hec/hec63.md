### CANON FOR ASCENSION DAY.

This is the crowning glory of the poet Joseph; he has here with a happy
boldness entered into the lists with S. John Damascene, to whom, on this
one occasion, he must be pronounced superior. I have preserved the
alphabetic arrangement, and "Joseph's Ode" at the end. All the
Catavasias are in Iambics.

### ODE. I.

by S. Joseph of the Studium

ἀνέστης τριήμερος.

A   fter three days Thou didst rise  
    Visible to mortal eyes:  
    First the Eleven worshipped Thee,—  
    Then the rest in Galilee:  
    Then a cloud in glory bore  
    Thee to Thine own native shore.

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

B   oldly David pour'd the strain:  
    <span class="smallcaps">God</span> ascends to Heav’n again:  
    With the trumpet's pealing note  
    Alleluias round Him float;  
    As He now, by hard-won right,  
    Seeks the Fount of purest Light!

C   rime on crime, and grief on grief,  
    Left the world without relief:  
    Now that aged, languid race,  
    <span class="smallcaps">God</span> hath quickened by His grace:  
    As Thy going up we see,  
    Glory to Thy Glory be!

*Catavasía*.

θέιῳ καλυφθείς.

D   arkness and awe, when Sinai's top he trod,  
    Taught him of faltering tongue the Law of <span
class="smallcaps">God</span>: <span id="page_211">p. 211</span>  
    The mist was scattered from his spirit's eye,  
    He prais’d and hymn’d the Maker of the sky,  
    When He That is and was and shall be, passed by.
