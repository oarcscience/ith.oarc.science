Canon for Apocreos

### ODE III.

by Theodore of the Studium

Ὁ Κύριος ἔρχεται.

<span class="smallcaps">God</span> comes;—and who shall stand before His
fear?  
Who bide His Presence, when He draweth near?

        My soul, my soul, prepare  
        To kneel before Him there!

Haste,—weep,—be reconciled to Him before  
The fearful judgment knocketh at the door

        Where, in the Judge's eyes,  
        All bare and naked lies.

Have mercy, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, have mercy, <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, I cry,  
When with Thine angels Thou appear’st on high:

        And each shall doom inherit,  
        According to his merit.

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

How can I bear Thy fearful anger, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>?  
I, that have so often transgressed Thy word?

        But put my sins away,  
        And spare me in that day!

O miserable soul, return, lament,  
Ere earthly converse end, and life be spent:

        Ere, time for sorrow o’er,  
        The Bridegroom close the door!

Yea, I have sinned, as no man sinned beside:  
With more than human guilt my soul is dyed:

        But spare, and save me here,  
        Before that day appear!

Three Persons in One Essence uncreate,  
On Whom, both Three and One, our praises wait,

        Give everlasting light,  
        To them that sing Thy might!
