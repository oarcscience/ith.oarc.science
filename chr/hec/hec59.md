### SUNDAY OF THE PRODIGAL SON.

### (SEPTUAGESIMA.)

by S. Joseph of the Studium

The Sunday before Septuagesima, and Septuagesima itself are,
respectively, in the Greek Church, the Sunday of the Pharisee and
Publican,—and the Sunday of the Prodigal Son,—those parables forming the
Gospel for the day, and serving for the key-note to the offices. The
following Troparia are from the Canon at Lauds on Septuagesima. (Ode VI.
and Ode VIII. Trop. 2, 3.)

βυθὸς ἁμαρτημάτων.

The abyss of many a former sin  
Encloses me, and bars me in:  
Like billows my transgressions roll:  
Be Thou the Pilot of my soul;  
And to Salvation's harbour bring,  
Thou Saviour and Thou glorious King!

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

My Father's heritage abused,  
Wasted by lust, by sin misused;  
To shame and want and misery brought,  
The slave to many a fruitless thought,  
I cry to Thee, Who lovest men,  
O pity and receive again!

In hunger now,—no more possessed  
Of that my portion bright and blest,  
The exile and the alien see  
Who yet would fain return to Thee .  
And save me, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, who seek to raise  
To Thy dear love the hymn of praise!

With that blest thief my prayer I make,  
*Remember* for Thy mercy's sake!  
With that poor publican I cry,  
*Be merciful*, O <span class="smallcaps">God</span> most High!  
With that lost Prodigal I fain  
Back to my home would turn again!

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

Mourn, mourn, my soul, with earnest care,  
And raise to <span class="smallcaps">Christ</span> the contrite
prayer:—  
O Thou, Who freely wast made poor,  
My sorrows and my sins to cure,  
Me, poor of all good works, embrace,  
Enriching with Thy boundless grace

Himmelreich: harmonised by Ch. H. Pink. A striking melody.</span>\]
