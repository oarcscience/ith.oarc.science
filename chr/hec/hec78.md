### IDIOMELA IN THE WEEK OF THE FIRST OBLIQUE TONE.

by S. Stephen the Sabaite

<span class="small">These Stanzas, which strike me as very sweet, are
not in all the editions of the Octoechus.</span>

κόπον τε καὶ κάματον.

Art thou weary, art thou languid,  
  Art thou sore distrest?  
"Come to me "—saith One—"and coming,  
                   Be at rest!"

Hath He marks to lead me to Him,  
  If He be my Guide?  
"In Hip Feet and Hands are Wound-prints,  
                   And His Side."

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

Is there Diadem, as Monarch,  
  That His Brow adorns?  
"Yea, a Crown, in very surety,  
                   But of Thorns!"

If I find Him, if I follow,  
  What His guerdon here?  
"Many a sorrow, many a labour,  
                   Many a tear."

If I still hold closely to Him,  
  What hath He at last?  
"Sorrow vanquish’d, labour ended,  
                   Jordan past!"

If I ask Him to receive me,  
  Will He say me nay?  
"Not till earth, and not till Heaven  
                   Pass away!"

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

Finding, following, keeping, struggling,  
  Is He sure to bless?  
"Angels, Martyrs, Prophets, Virgins,  
                   Answer, Yes!"

\[<span class="small">No. 4. in Mr. Sedding's book: also No. 4 in H. E.
C. Both very sweet melodies;—but that in H. E. C., which gives a
different version of the 4th line throughout, is, to my mind, singularly
touching.</span>\]
