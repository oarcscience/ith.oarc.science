### ORTHODOXY SUNDAY.

by Theodore of the Studium

The first Sunday in Lent is kept in memory: primarily, of the final
triumph of the Church over the Iconoclasts in 842; and, incidentally, of
her victory over all other heresies. It has a kind of comminution
appropriate to itself alone. The fallowing Canon is ascribed to S.
Theodore of the Studium, though Baronius has thought that it cannot be
his, because it implies that peace was restored to the Church, whereas
that hymnographer died while the persecution still continued. Very
possibly, however, it was written en the temporary victory of the
Church, which did occur in the time of S. Theodore; and then, in 842,
may have been lengthened and adapted to

the then state of things, perhaps by Naucratius, the favourite disciple
of S. Theodore. It is, perhaps, the most spirited of all the Canons,
though many of its expressions savour too much of bitterness and
personal feeling to be well defended, and the reader must constantly
bear in mind that the poet feels the cause, not so much of Icons, as of
the Incarnation itself, to be at stake. I have only given about
one-third of the poem. The stanzas are these: Ode I. Tropar. I, 2; III.
6; IV. 1, 2, 3; V. 1, 3, 4, 5; VI. 1; IX. 2, 3, 4, 5.

Χαριστήριον ᾠδήν.

A song, a song of gladness!  
  A song of thanks and praise  
The horn of our salvation  
Hath <span class="smallcaps">God</span> vouchsafed to raise! <span
id="page_186">p. 186</span>  
A monarch true and faithful,  
And glorious in her might,  
To champion <span class="smallcaps">Christ's</span> own quarrel,  
  And Orthodoxy's right!

Now manifest is glory;  
  Now grace and virtue shine:  
Now joys the Church regaining  
  Her ornaments divine:  
And girds them on in gladness,  
  As fits a festal day,  
After long months of struggle,  
  Long years of disarray.

Now cries the blood for vengeance,  
  By persecutors poured,  
Of them that died defending  
  The likeness of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>: <span
id="page_187">p. 187</span>  
The likeness, as a mortal  
  That He vouchsaf’d to take,  
Long years ago, in Bethlem,  
  Incarnate for our sake.

Awake, O Church, and triumph  
  Exult, each realm and land!  
And open let the houses,  
  The ascetic houses stand!  
And let the holy virgins  
  With joy and song take in  
Their relics and their Icons,  
  Who died this day to win!

Assemble ye together  
  So joyous and so bold,  
The ascetic troops, and pen them  
  Once more within the fold! <span id="page_188">p. 188</span>  
If strength again he gather, <span id="fr_5"></span>[\*](#fn_5.md)  
  Again the foe shall fall:  
If counsel he shall counsel,  
  Our <span class="smallcaps">God</span> shall scatter all.

The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> hath triumphed:  
  Let all the world rejoice!  
Hush’d is the turmoil, silent  
  His servants’ tearful voice: <span id="page_189">p. 189</span>  
And the One Faith, the True Faith,  
  Goes forth from East to West,  
Enfolding, in its beauty,  
  The earth as with a vest.

They rise, the sleepless watchmen  
  Upon the Church's wall;  
With yearning supplication  
  On <span class="smallcaps">God</span> the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> they call:  
And He, though long time silent,  
  Bow'd down a gracious ear,  
His people's earnest crying  
  And long complaint to hear.

Sing, sing for joy, each desert!  
  Exult, each realm of earth  
Ye mountains, drop down sweetness!  
  Ye hillocks, leap for mirth! <span id="page_190">p. 190</span>  
For <span class="smallcaps">Christ</span> the <span
class="smallcaps">Word</span>, bestowing  
  His blessed peace on men,  
In Faith's most holy union  
  Hath knit His Church again.

The <span class="smallcaps">God</span> of vengeance rises:  
  And <span class="smallcaps">Christ</span> attacks the foe,  
And makes His servants mighty  
  The wicked to o’erthrow:  
And now Thy condescension  
  In boldness may we hymn,  
And now in peace and safety  
  Thy sacred Image limn.

O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of loving kindness,  
  How wondrous are Thy ways!  
What tongue of man suffices  
  Thy gentleness to praise? <span id="page_191">p. 191</span>  
Because of Thy dear Image  
  Men dared Thy Saints to kill,  
Yet didst Thou not consume them,  
  But bear’st their insults still.

Thou Who has fixed unshaken  
  Thy Church's mighty frame,  
So that hell-gates shall never  
  Prevail against the same;—  
Bestow upon Thy people  
  Thy peace, that we may bring  
One voice, one hymn, one spirit,  
  To glorify our King!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_5"></span>[188:\*](hec56.htm#fr_5.md) This is from the
magnificent Emmanuel Ode sung at Great Compline on high festivals.

"Having become mighty, ye have been subdued.  
        "For God is with us.

"And if ye shall again become mighty, again ye shall be subdued.  
        "For God is with us.

"And if ye shall devise any device, the  
    <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> shall scatter it,  
        "For God is with us."
