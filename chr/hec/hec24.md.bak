Canon for Easter Day

### ODE IV.

by S. John Damascene.

ἐπὶ τῆς θείας φυλακῆς.

Stand on thy watch-tower, Habakkuk the Seer,  
And show the Angel, radiant in his light:  
'To-day,' saith he, 'Salvation shall appear,  
'Because the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> hath ris’n, as <span
class="smallcaps">God</span> of Might.'

The male that opes the Virgin's womb is He;  
The Lamb of Whom His faithful people eat;  
Our truer Passover from blemish free;  
Our very <span class="smallcaps">God</span>, Whose name is all complete.

This yearling Lamb, our Sacrifice most blest,  
Our glorious Crown, for all men freely dies:  
Behold our Pascha, beauteous from His rest,  
The healing Sun of Righteousness arise.

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

Before the ark, a type to pass away,  
David of old time danced: we, holier race,  
Seeing the Antitype come forth to-day,  
Hail, with a shout, <span class="smallcaps">Christ's</span> own Almighty
grace.
