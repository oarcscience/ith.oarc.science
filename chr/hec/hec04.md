### PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.

It is of course a matter of deep thankfulness to me that the Eastern
Church should now be more and more widely brought before ordinary
congregations by means of some of the following versions. <span
class="smallcaps">God</span> grant that this may be one little help
towards the great work of Re-union.

I have been more than once asked to what tunes any of the hymns
contained in this little book may be sung. The following is a list of
all the settings with which I am acquainted:—

"Peace! It is I!" by the Rev. T. Helmore, M.A. Second Edition. Novello.
1863.

"The Day of Resurrection:" by the Rev. T. Helmore, M.A. Novello. 1863.

"The Day is past and over:" by the Rev. T. Helmore, M.A. Second Edition.
Novello. 1865.

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

"The Day is past and over:" by Arthur Henry Brown Organist of Brentwood.
Second Edition. Masters.

"Fierce was the wild billow:" by Edith Kerr. Novello.

Fortitude: a Sacred Song. \[*i.e.*, "Christian, dost thou see them?"\]
Music by M. E. H. S. Novello.

Hymns of the Holy Eastern Church; set to music for four voices by Edmund
Sedding. London, Masters. \[This contains five.\]

Hymns of the Eastern Church. In competent score for four voices. Second
Edition. London: Novello. Leicester: Crossley and Clarke. \[This
contains six. As it has no distinguishing title, it is referred to in
the following page as H.E.C.\]

In the Church Hymnal of the Rev. J. F. Young, which having appeared in
Philadelphia is reprinting in London, eleven of these hymns occur; the
Greek being given as well as the English.

Each of the above melodies will be found noticed at the end of the Hymn
which has been set to it.

And so once more I commit this attempt to

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

further the cause of English Hymnology to <span
class="smallcaps">God's</span> blessing: and I cannot do it better than
in the quaint old words of a forgotten poet:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I long have long’d to do some little good,  
 (According to the best I understood,)  
 By Thy good grace assisting, which I do  
 Most humbly beg for: O adjoin it to  
 My longing ardent soul; and have respect  
 To this my weak endeavour, and accept  
 (In Thy great mercy) both of it and me,  
 Ev’n as we dedicate ourselves to Thee."</span>
