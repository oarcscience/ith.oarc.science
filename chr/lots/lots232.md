### July 23.—ST. APOLLINARIS, Bishop and Martyr.

ST. APOLLINARIS was the first Bishop of Ravenna; he sat twenty years,
and was crowned with martyrdom in the reign of Vespasian. He was a
disciple of St. Peter, and made by him Bishop of Ravenna. St. Peter
Chrysologus, the most illustrious among his successors, has left us a
sermon in honor of our Saint, in which he often styles him a martyr; but
adds, that though he frequently suffered for the Faith, and ardently
desired to lay down his life for

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Christ, yet God
preserved him a long time to His Church, and did not allow the
persecutors to take away his life. So he seems to have been a martyr
only by the torments he endured for Christ, which he survived at least
some days. His body lay first at Classis, four miles from Ravenna, still
a kind of suburb to that city, and its seaport till it was choked up by
the sands. In the year 549 his relics were removed into a more secret
vault in the same church. St. Fortunatus exhorted his friends to make
pilgrimages to the tomb, and St. Gregory the Great ordered parties in
doubtful suits at law to be sworn before it. Pope Honorius built a
church under the name of Apollinaris in Rome, about the year 630. It
occurs in all martyrologies, and the high veneration which the Church
paid early to his memory is a sufficient testimony of his eminent
sanctity and apostolic spirit.

**Reflection**.—The virtue of the Saints was true and heroic, because
humble and proof against all trials. Persevere in your good resolutions:
it is not enough to begin well; you must so continue to the end.
