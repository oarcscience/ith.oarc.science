### September 8.—THE NATIVITY OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN.

THE birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary announced joy and the near approach
of salvation to the lost world. Mary was brought forth in the world not
like other children of Adam, infected with the loathsome contagion of
sin, but pure, holy, beautiful, and glorious, adorned with all the most
precious graces which became her who was chosen to be the Mother of God.
She appeared indeed in the weak state of our mortality; but in the eyes
of Heaven she already transcended the highest seraph in purity,
brightness, and the richest ornaments of grace. If we celebrate the
birthdays of the great ones of this earth, how ought we to rejoice in
that of the Virgin Mary, presenting to God the best homage of our
praises and thanksgiving for the great mercies He has shown in her, and
imploring her mediation with her Son in our behalf! Christ will not
reject the supplications of His mother, whom He was pleased to obey
whilst on earth. Her love, care, and tenderness for Him, the title and
qualities which she bears, the charity and graces with which she is
adorned, and the crown of glory with which she is honored, must incline
Him readily to receive her recommendations and petitions.
