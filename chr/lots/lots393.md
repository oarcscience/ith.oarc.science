### December 24.—ST. DELPHINUS, Bishop.—STS. THRASILLA and EMILIANA, Virgins.

LITTLE is known of St. Delphinus before his elevation to the episcopate.
He assisted at the Council of Saragossa, in 330, in which the
Priscillianists were condemned, and also at the Council of Bordeaux,
which condemned the same schismatics. He baptized St. Paulerius in 388,
and the latter, in several letters, speaks of him as his father and his
master. St. Delphinus died on the 24th of December, 403.

STS. THRASILLA and EMILIANA were aunts of St. Gregory the Great. They
lived in their father's house as retired as in a monastery, far removed
from the conversation of men; and, exciting one another to virtue by
discourse and example, soon made considerable progress in spiritual
life. Thrasilla was favored one night with a vision of her uncle, St.
Felix, Pope, who showed her a seat prepared for her in heaven, saying:
"Come; I will receive you into this habitation of light." She fell sick
of a fever the next day. When in her agony, with her eyes fixed on
heaven, she cried out to those that were present: "Depart! make room!
Jesus is coming." Soon after these words she breathed out her pious soul
into the hands of God on the 24th of December. A few days after she
appeared to her sister Emiliana, and invited her to celebrate with her
the Epiphany in eternal bliss. Emiliana fell sick, and died on the 8th
of January.

**Reflection**.—We may often think the austerities of the Saints are
beyond our strength; let us, then, imitate the

guard they kept over their tongue. This is within the reach of all.
