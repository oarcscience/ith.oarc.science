### November 27.—ST. MAXIMUS, Bishop.

ST. MAXIMUS, abbot of Lerins, in succession to St. Honoratus, was
remarkable not only for the spirit of recollection, fervor, and piety
familiar to him from very childhood, but still more for the gentleness
and kindliness with which he governed the monastery which at that time
contained many religious, and was famous for the learning and piety of
its brethren. Exhibiting in his own person an example of the most
sterling virtues, his exhortations could not fail to prove
all-persuasive: loving all his religious, whom it was his delight to
consider as one family, he established amongst them that sweet concord,
union, and holy emulation for well-doing which render the exercise of
authority needless, and makes submission a pleasure. The clergy and
people of Frejus, moved by such a shining example, elected Maximus for
their bishop, but he took to flight; subsequently be was compelled,
however, to accept the see of Riez, where he practised virtue in all
gentleness, and died in 460, regretted as the best of fathers.

**Reflection**.—"Masters, do to your servants that which is just and
equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven."
