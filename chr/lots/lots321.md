### October 15.—ST. TERESA.

WHEN a child of seven years, Teresa ran away from her home at Avila in
Spain, in the hope of being martyred by the Moors. Being brought back
and asked the reason of her flight, she replied, "I want to see God, and
I must die before I can see Him." She then began with her brother to
build a hermitage in the garden, and was often heard repeating "Forever,
forever" Some years later she became a Carmelite nun. Frivolous
conversations checked her progress towards perfection, but at last, in
her thirty-first year, she gave herself wholly to God. A vision showed
her the very place in hell to which her own light faults would have led
her, and she lived ever after in the deepest distrust of self. She was
called to reform her Order, favored with distinct commands from Our
Lord, and her heart was pierced with divine love; but she dreaded
nothing so much as delusion, and to the last acted only under obedience
to her confessors, which both made her strong and kept her safe. She
died on October 4, 1582.

**Reflection**.—"After all I die a child of the Church." These were the
Saint's last words. They teach us the lesson of her life—to trust in
humble, childlike obedience to our spiritual guides as the surest means
of salvation.
