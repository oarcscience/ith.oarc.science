### May 11.—ST. MAMMERTUS, Archbishop.

ST. MAMMERTUS, Archbishop of Vienne in Dauphin, was a prelate renowned
for his sanctity, learning, and miracles. He instituted in his diocese
the fasts and supplications called the Rogations, on the following
occasions. Almighty God, to punish the sins of the people, visited them
with wars and other public calamities, and awaked them from their
spiritual lethargy by the terrors of earthquakes, fires, and ravenous
wild beasts, which last were sometimes seen in the very market-place of
cities. These evils the impious ascribed to blind chance; but religious
and prudent persons considered them as tokens of the divine anger, which
threatened their entire destruction. Amidst these scourges, St.
Mammertus received a token of the divine mercy. A terrible fire happened
in the city of Vienne, which baffled the efforts of men; but by the
prayers of the good bishop the fire on a sudden went out. This miracle
strongly affected the minds of the people. The holy prelate took this
opportunity to make them sensible of the necessity and efficacy of
devout prayer, and formed a pious design of instituting an annual fast
and supplication of three days, in which all the faithful should join,
with sincere compunction of heart, to appease the divine indignation by
fasting, prayer, tears, and the confession of sins. The Church of
Auvergne, of which St. Sidonius was bishop, adopted this pious
institution before the year 475, and it became in a very short time a
universal practice. St. Mammertus died about the year 477.

**Reflection**.—"Know ye that the Lord will hear your prayers, if you
continue with perseverance in fastings and prayers in the sight of the
Lord" (Judith iv. 11).
