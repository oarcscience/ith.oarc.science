### October 31.—ST. QUINTIN, Martyr.

ST. QUINTIN was a Roman, descended from a senatorial family. Full of
zeal for the kingdom of Jesus Christ, he left his country, and, attended
by St. Lucian of Beauvais, made his way to Gaul. They preached the Faith
together in that country till they reached Amiens in Picardy, where they
parted. Lucian went to Beauvais, and, having sown the seeds of divine
faith in the hearts of many, received the crown of martyrdom in that
city. St. Quintin stayed at Amiens, endeavoring by his prayers and
labors to make that country a portion of Our Lord's inheritance. He was
seized, thrown into prison, and loaded with chains. Finding the holy
preacher proof against promises

and threats, the magistrate condemned him to the most barbarous torture.
His body was then pierced with two iron wires from the neck to the
thighs, and iron nails were thrust under his nails, and in his flesh in
many places, particularly into his skull; and, lastly, his head was cut
off. His death happened on the 31st of October, 287.

**Reflection**.—Let us bear in mind that the ills of this life are not
worthy to be compared to the glory "God has reserved for those who love
Him."
