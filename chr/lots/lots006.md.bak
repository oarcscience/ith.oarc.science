### ST. JOAN OF ARC.

AT Domremy, on the Upper Meuse, was born on January 6, 1412, of pious
parentage, the illustrious heroine of all time, St. Joan of Arc. Taught
by her mother from earliest years to pray each night "O God, save
France," she could not help but conceive that ardent love for her
country which later consumed her life. While the English were
overrunning the north of France, their future conqueror, untutored in
worldly wisdom, was peacefully tending her flock, and learning the
wisdom of God at a wayside shrine. But hearing Voices from heaven and
bidden by St. Michael, who appeared to her, to deliver her country from
the enemy, she hastened to the King and convinced him of her divine
mission. Scarcely did her banner, inscribed "Jesus, Mary," appear on the
battlefield than she raised the siege of Orleans and led Charles VII. to
be crowned at Rheims. Later, abandoned by her King, she fell into the
hands of the English, who gave her a mock trial and burned her as a
heretic.

But the Maid of Orleans has at last come into her own, for with greater
pomp than ever a king was crowned, and amid the acclamations of the
whole world, on May 13, 1920, Pope Benedict XV. proclaimed her St. Joan
of Arc.
