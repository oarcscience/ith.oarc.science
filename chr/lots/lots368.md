### November 29.—ST. SATURNINUS, Martyr.

SATURNINUS went from Rome, by direction of Pope Fabian, about the year
245, to preach the faith in Gaul. He fixed his episcopal see at
Toulouse, and thus became the first Christian bishop of that city. There
were but few Christians in the place. However, their number grew fast
after the coming of the Saint; and his power was felt by the spirits of
evil, who received the worship of the heathen. His power was felt the
more because he had to pass daily through the capitol, the high place of
the heathen worship, on the way to his own church. One day a great
multitude was gathered by an altar, where a bull stood ready for the
sacrifice. A man in the crowd pointed out Saturninus, who was passing
by, and the people would have forced him to idolatry; but the holy
bishop answered: "I know but one God, and to Him I will offer the
sacrifice of praise. How can I fear gods who, as you say, are afraid of
me?" On this he was fastened to the bull, which was driven down the
capitol. The brains of the Saint were

scattered on the steps. His mangled body was taken up and buried by two
devout women.

**Reflection**.—When beset by the temptations of the devil, let us call
upon the Saints, who reign with Christ. They were powerful during their
lives against the devil and his angels. They are more powerful now that
they have passed from the Church on earth to the Church triumphant.
