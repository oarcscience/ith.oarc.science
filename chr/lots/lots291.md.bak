### September 15.—ST. CATHERINE OF GENOA.

NOBLE in birth, rich, and exceedingly beautiful, Catherine had as a
child rejected the solicitations of the world, and begged her divine
Master for some share in His sufferings. At sixteen years of age she
found herself promised in marriage to a young nobleman of dissolute
habits, who treated her with such harshness that, after five years,
wearied out by his cruelty, she somewhat relaxed the strictness of her
life and entered into the worldly society of Genoa. At length,
enlightened by divine grace as to the danger of her state, she
resolutely broke with the world and gave herself up to a life of
rigorous penance and prayer. The charity with which she devoted herself
to the service of the hospitals, undertaking the vilest of offices with
joy, induced her husband to amend his evil ways and he died penitent.
Her heroic fortitude was sustained by the constant thought of the Holy
Souls, whose sufferings were revealed to her, and whose state she has
described in a treatise full of heavenly wisdom. A long and grievous
malady during the last years of her life only served to perfect her
union with God, till, worn out in body and purified in soul, she
breathed her last on September 14, 1510.

**Reflection**.—The constant thought of purgatory will help us not only
to escape its dreadful pains, but also to avoid the least imperfection
which hinders our approach to God.
