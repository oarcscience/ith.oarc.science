### November 10:—ST. ANDREW AVELLINO.

AFTER a holy youth, Lancelot Avellino was ordained priest at Naples. At
the age of thirty-six he entered the Theatine Order, and took the name
of Andrew, to show his love for the cross. For fifty years he was
afflicted with a most painful rupture; yet he would never use a
carriage. Once when he was carrying the Viaticum, and a storm had
extinguished the lamps, a heavenly light

encircled him, guided his steps, and sheltered him from the rain. But as
a rule, his sufferings were unrelieved by God or man. On the last day of
his life, St. Andrew rose to say Mass. He was in his eighty-ninth year,
and so weak that he could scarcely reach the altar. He began the
"Judica," and fell forward in a fit of apoplexy. Laid on a straw
mattress, his whole frame was convulsed in agony, while the fiend in
visible form advanced to seize his soul, Then, as his brethren prayed
and wept, the voice of Mary was heard, bidding the Saint's guardian
angel send the tempter back to hell. A calm and holy smile settled on
the features of the dying Saint, as, with a grateful salutation to the
image of Mary, he breathed forth his soul to God. His death happened on
the 10th of November, 1608.

**Reflection**.—St. Andrew, who suffered so terrible an agony, is the
special patron against sudden death. Ask him to be with you in your last
hour, and to bring Jesus and Mary to your aid.
