### July 10.—THE SEVEN BROTHERS, Martyrs, and ST. FELICITAS, their Mother.

THE illustrious martyrdom of these Saints happened at Rome, under the
Emperor Antoninus. The seven brothers were the sons of St. Felicitas, a
noble, pious, Christian widow in Rome, who, after the death of her
husband, served God in a state of continency and employed herself wholly
in prayer, fasting, and works of charity. By the public and edifying
example of this lady and her whole family many idolaters were moved to
renounce the worship of their false gods, and to embrace the Faith of
Christ. This excited the anger of the heathen priests, who complained to
the emperor that the boldness with which Felicitas publicly practised
the Christian religion drew many from the worship of the immortal gods,
who were the guardians and protectors of the empire, and that, in order
to appease these false gods, it was necessary to compel this lady and
her children to sacrifice to them. Publius, the prefect of Rome, caused
the mother and her sons to be apprehended and brought before him, and,
addressing her, said, "Take pity on your children, Felicitas; they are
in the bloom of youth, and may aspire to the greatest honors and
preferments." The holy mother answered, "Your pity is really impiety,
and the compassion to which you exhort me would make me the most cruel
of mothers." Then turning herself towards her children, she said to
them, "My sons, look up to heaven, where Jesus Christ with His Saints
expects you. Be faithful in His love, and fight courageously for your
souls." Publius, being exasperated at this behavior, commanded her to be
cruelly buffeted; he then called the children to him one after another,
and used many artful speeches, mingling promises with threats to induce
them to adore the gods. His arguments

and threats were equally in vain, and the brothers were condemned to be
scourged. After being whipped, they were remanded to prison, and the
prefect, despairing to overcome their resolution, laid the whole process
before the emperor. Antoninus gave an order that they should be sent to
different judges, and be condemned to different deaths. Januarius was
scourged to death with whips loaded with plummets of lead. The two next,
Felix and Philip, were beaten with clubs till they expired. Sylvanus,
the fourth, was thrown headlong down a steep precipice. The three
youngest, Alexander, Vitalis, and Martialis, were beheaded, and the same
sentence was executed upon the mother four months after.

**Reflection**.—What afflictions do parents daily meet with from the
disorders into which their children fall through their own bad example
or neglect! Let them imitate the earnestness of St. Felicitas in forming
to perfect virtue the tender souls which God hath committed to their
charge, and with this Saint they will have the greatest of all comforts
in them, and will by His grace count as many Saints in their family as
they are blessed with children.
