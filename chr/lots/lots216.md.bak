### July 8.—ST. ELIZABETH OF PORTUGAL.

ELIZABETH was born in 1271. She was daughter of Pedro III. of Arragon,
being named after her aunt, St. Elizabeth of Hungary. At twelve years of
age she was given in marriage to Denis, King of Portugal, and from a
holy child became a saintly wife. She heard Mass and recited the Divine
Office daily, but her devotions were arranged with such prudence that
they interfered with no duty of her state. She prepared for her frequent
communions by severe austerities, fasting thrice a week, and by heroic
works of charity. She was several times called on to make peace between
her husband and her son Alphonso, who had taken up arms against him. Her
husband tried her much, both by his unfounded jealousy and by his
infidelity to herself. A slander affecting Elizabeth and one of her
pages made the king determine to slay the youth, and he told a
lime-burner to cast into his kiln the first page who should arrive with
a royal message. On the day fixed the page was sent; but the boy, who
was in the habit of hearing Mass daily, stopped on his way to do so. The
king, in suspense, sent a second page, the very originator of the
calumny, who, coming first to the kiln, was at once cast into the
furnace and burned. Shortly after, the first page arrived from the
church, and took back to the king the lime-burner's reply that his
orders had been fulfilled. Thus hearing Mass saved the page's life and
proved the queen's innocence. Her patience, and the wonderful sweetness
with which she even cherished the children of her rivals, completely won
the king from his evil ways, and he became a devoted husband and a truly
Christian king. She built many charitable institutions and religious
houses, among others a convent of Poor Clares. After her husband's
death, she wished to enter their Order; but being dissuaded by her
people, who could not do without her, she took the habit of the Third
Order of St. Francis, and spent the rest of her life in redoubled
austerities and almsgiving. She died at the age of sixty-five, while in
the act of making peace between her children.

**Reflection**.—In the Holy Sacrifice of the Altar St. Elizabeth daily
found strength to bear with sweetness suspicion and cruelty; and by that
same Holy Sacrifice her innocence was proved. What succor do we forfeit
by neglect of daily Mass!
