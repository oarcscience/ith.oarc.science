### May 9.—ST. GREGORY NAZIANZEN.

GREGORY was born of saintly parents, and was the chosen friend of St.
Basil. They studied together at Athens, turned at the same time from the
fairest worldly prospects, and for some years lived together in
seclusion, self-discipline, and toil. Gregory was raised, almost by
force, to the priesthood; and was in time made Bishop of Nazianzum by
St. Basil, who had become Archbishop of Cæsarea. When he was fifty years
old, he was chosen, for his rare gifts and his conciliatory disposition,
to be Patriarch of Constantinople, then distracted and laid waste by
Arian and other heretics. In that city he labored with wonderful
success. The Arians were so irritated at the decay of their heresy that
they pursued the Saint with outrage, calumny, and violence, and at
length resolved to take away his life. For this purpose they chose a
resolute young man, who readily undertook the sacrilegious commission.
But God did not allow him to carry it out. He was touched with remorse,
and cast himself at the Saint's feet, avowing his sinful intent. St.
Gregory at once forgave him, treated him with all kindness, and received
him amongst his friends, to the wonder and edification of the whole
city, and to the confusion of the heretics, whose crime had served only
as a foil to the virtue of the Saint. St. Jerome boasts that he had sat
at his feet, and calls him his master and his catechist in Holy
Scripture. But his lowliness, his austerities, the insignificance of his
person, and above all his very success, drew down on him the hatred of
the enemies of the Faith. He was persecuted by the magistrates, stoned
by the rabble, and thwarted and deserted even by his brother bishops.
During the second General Council he resigned his see, hoping thus to
restore peace to the tormented city, and retired to his native town,
where he died in 390. He was a graceful poet, a preacher at once
eloquent and solid; and as a champion of the Faith so well equipped, so
strenuous, and so exact, that he is called St. Gregory the Theologian.

**Reflection**.—"We must overcome our enemies," said St. Gregory, "by
gentleness; win them over by forbearance. Let them be punished by their
own conscience, not by our wrath. Let us not at once wither the
fig-tree, from which a more skilful gardener may yet entice fruit."
