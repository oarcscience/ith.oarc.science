### SAINT PETER CLAVER.

PETER CLAVER was a Spanish Jesuit. In Majorca he fell in with the holy
lay-brother Alphonsus Rodriguez, who, having already learned by
revelation the saintly career of Peter, became his spiritual guide,
foretold to him the labors he would undergo in the Indies, and the
throne he would gain in heaven. Ordained priest in New Granada, Peter
was sent to Cartagena, the great slave-mart of the West Indies, and
there he consecrated himself by vow to the salvation of those ignorant
and miserable creatures. For more than forty years he labored in this
work. He called himself "the slave of the slaves." He was their apostle,
father, physician, and friend. He fed them, nursed. them with the utmost
tenderness in their loathsome diseases, often applying his own lips to
their hideous sores. His cloak, which was the constant covering of the
naked, though soiled with their filthy ulcers, sent forth a miraculous
perfume. His rest after his great labors was in nights of penance and
prayer. However tired he might be, when news arrived of a fresh
slave-ship, Saint Peter immediately revived, his eyes brightened, and he
was at once on board amongst his dear slaves, bringing them comfort for
body and soul. A false charge of reiterating Baptism for a while stopped
his work. He submitted without a murmur till the calumny was refuted,
and then God so blessed his toil that 40,000 negroes were baptized
before he went to his reward, in 1654.

**Reflection**.—When you see any one standing in need of your
assistance, either for body or soul, do not ask yourself why some one
else did not help him, but think to yourself that you have found a
treasure.
