### February 16.—BLESSED JOHN DE BRITTO, Martyr.

DON PEDRO II. of Portugal, when a child, had among his little pages a
modest boy of rich and princely parents. Much had John de Britto—for so
was he called—to bear from his careless-living companions, to whom his
holy life was a reproach. A terrible illness made him turn for aid to
St. Francis Xavier, a Saint so well loved by the Portuguese; and when,
in answer to his prayers, he recovered, his mother vested him for a year
in the dress worn in those days by the Jesuit Fathers. From that time
John's heart burned to follow the example of the Apostle of the Indies.
He gained his wish. On December 17, 1662, he entered the novitiate of
the Society at Lisbon; and eleven years later, in spite of the most
determined opposition of his family and of the court, he left all to go
to convert the Hindus of Madura. When Blessed John's mother knew that
her son was going to the Indies, she used all her influence to prevent
him leaving his own country, and persuaded the Papal Nuncio to
interfere. "God, Who called me from the world into religious life, now
calls me from Portugal to India," was the reply of the future martyr.
"Not to answer the vocation as I ought, would be to provoke the justice
of God. As long as I live, I shall never cease striving to gain a
passage to India." For fourteen years he toiled, preaching, converting,
baptizing multitudes, at the cost of privations, hardships, and
persecutions. At last, after being seized, tortured, and nearly
massacred by the heathens, he was banished from the country. Forced to
return to Portugal, John once more broke through every obstacle, and
went back again to his labor of love. Like St. John the Baptist, he died
a victim to the anger of a guilty woman, whom a convert king had put
aside, and, like the Precursor, he was beheaded after a painful
imprisonment.

**Reflection**.—"It is a great honor, a great glory to serve; God, and
to contemn all things for God. They will have a great grace who freely
subject themselves to God's most holy will."—*The Imitation of Christ*.
