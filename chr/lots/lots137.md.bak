### April 28.—ST. PAUL OF THE CROSS.

THE eighty-one years of this Saint's life were modelled on the Passion
of Jesus Christ. In his childhood, when praying in church, a heavy bench
fell on his foot, but the boy took no notice of the bleeding wound, and
spoke of it as "a rose sent from God." A few years later, the vision of
a scourge with "love" written on its lashes assured him that his thirst
for penance would be satisfied. In the hope of dying for the faith, he
enlisted in a crusade against the Turks; but a voice from the Tabernacle
warned him that he was to serve Christ alone, and that he should found a
congregation in His honor. At the command of his bishop he began while a
layman to preach the Passion, and a series of crosses tried the reality
of his vocation. All his first companions, save his brother, deserted
him; the Sovereign Pontiff refused him an audience; and it was only
after a delay of seventeen years that the Papal approbation was
obtained, and the first house of the Passionists was opened on Monte
Argentario, the spot which Our Lady had pointed out. St. Paul chose as
the badge of his Order a heart with three nails, in memory of the
sufferings of Jesus, but for himself he invented a more secret and
durable sign. Moved by the same holy impulse as Blessed Henry Suso, St.
Jane Frances, and other Saints, he branded on his side the Holy Name,
and its characters were found there after death. His heart beat with a
supernatural palpitation, which was especially vehement on Fridays, and
the heat at times was so intense as to scorch his shirt in the region of
his heart. Through fifty years of incessant bodily pain, and amidst all
his trials, Paul read the love of Jesus everywhere, and would cry out to
the flowers and grass, "Oh! be quiet, be quiet," as if they were
reproaching him with ingratitude. He died whilst the Passion was being
read to him, and so passed with Jesus from the cross to glory.
