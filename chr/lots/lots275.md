### September 1.—ST. GILES, Abbot.

ST. GILES, whose name has been held in great veneration for several ages
in France and England, is said to have been an Athenian by birth, and of
noble extraction. His extraordinary piety and learning drew the
admiration of the world upon him in such a manner that it was impossible
for him to enjoy in his own country that obscurity and retirement which
was the chief object of his desires on earth. He therefore sailed to
France, and chose a hermitage first in the open deserts near the mouth
of the Rhone, afterward near the river Gard, and lastly in a forest in
the diocese of Nismes. He passed many years in this close solitude,
living on wild herbs or roots and water, and conversing only with God.
We read in his life that he was for some time nourished with the milk of
a hind in the forest, which, being pursued by hunters, fled for refuge
to the Saint, who was thus discovered. The reputation of the sanctity of
this holy hermit was much increased by many miracles which he wrought,
and which rendered his name

famous throughout all France. St. Giles was highly esteemed by the
French king, but could not be prevailed upon to forsake his solitude.
He, however, admitted several disciples, and settled excellent
discipline in the monastery of which he was the founder, and which, in
succeeding ages, became a flourishing abbey of the Benedictine Order.

**Reflection**.—He who accompanies the exercises of contemplation and
arduous penance with zealous and undaunted endeavors to conduct others
to the same glorious term with himself, shall be truly great in the
kingdom of heaven.
