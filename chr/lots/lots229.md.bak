### ST. JEROME EMILIANI.

ST. JEROME EMILIANI was a member of one of the patrician families of
Venice, and, like many other Saints, in early life a soldier. He was
appointed governor of a fortress among the mountains of Treviso, and
whilst bravely defending his post, was made prisoner by the enemy. In
the misery of his dungeon he invoked the great Mother of God, and
promised, if she would set him free, to lead a new and a better life.
Our Lady appeared, broke his fetters, and led him forth through the
midst of his enemies. At Treviso he hung up his chains at her altar,
dedicated himself to her service, and on reaching his home at Venice
devoted himself to a life of active charity. His special love was for
the deserted orphan children whom, in the times of the plague and
famine, he found wandering in the streets. He took them home, clothed
and fed them, and taught them the Christian truths. From Venice he
passed to Padua and Verona, and in a few years had founded orphanages
through Northern Italy. Some pious clerics and laymen, who had been his
fellow-workers, fixed their abode in one of these establishments, and
devoted themselves to the cause of education. The Saint drew up for them
a rule of life and thus was founded the Congregation, which still
exists, of the Clerks Regular of Somascha. St. Jerome died February 8,
1537, of an illness which he had caught in visiting the sick.

**Reflection**.—Let us learn from St. Jerome to exert ourselves in
behalf of the many hundred children whose souls are perishing around us
for want of some one to show them the way to heaven.
