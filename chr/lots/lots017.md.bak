### January 7.—ST. LUCIAN, Martyr.

ST. LUCIAN was born at Samosata in Syria. Having lost his parents in his
youth, he distributed all his worldly goods, of which he inherited an
abundant share, to the poor, and withdrew to Edessa, to live near a holy
man named Macarius, who imbued his mind with a knowledge of the Holy
Scriptures, and led him to the practice of the Christian virtues. Having
become a priest, his time was divided between the external duties of his
holy state, the performance of works of charity, and the study of sacred
literature. He revised the books of the Old and New Testaments,
expunging the errors which had found their way into the text either
through the negligence of copyists or the malice of heretics, thus
preparing the way for St. Jerome, who shortly after was to give to the
world the Latin translation known as "The Vulgate." Having been
denounced as a Christian, Lucian was thrown into prison and condemned to
the torture, which was protracted for twelve whole days. Some Christian
visited him in prison, on the feast of the Epiphany, and brought bread
and wine to him; while bound and chained down on his back, he
consecrated the divine mysteries upon his own breast, and communicated
the faithful who were present. He finished his glorious career in
prison, and died with the words, "I am a Christian," on his lips.

**Reflection**.—If we would keep our faith pure, we must study its holy
truths. We cannot detect falsehood till we know and love the truth; and
to us the truth is not an abstraction, but a Person, Jesus Christ, God
and Man.
