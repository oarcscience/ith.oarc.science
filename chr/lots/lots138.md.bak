### ST. VITALIS, Martyr.

ST. VITALIS was a citizen of Milan, and is said to have been the father
of Sts. Gervasius and Protasius. The divine providence conducted him to
Ravenna, where he saw a Christian named Ursicinus, who was condemned to
lose his head for his faith, standing aghast at the sight of death, and
seeming ready to yield. Vitalis was extremely moved at this spectacle.
He knew his double obligation of preferring the glory of God and the
eternal salvation of his neighbor to his own corporal life: he therefore
boldly and successfully encouraged Ursicinus to triumph over death, and
after his martyrdom carried off his body, and respectfully interred it.
The judge, whose name was Paulinus, being informed of this, caused
Vitalis to be apprehended, stretched on the rack, and, after other
torments, to be buried alive in a place called the Palm-tree, in
Ravenna. His wife, Valeria, returning from Ravenna to Milan, was beaten
to death by peasants, because she refused to join them in an idolatrous
festival and riot.

**Reflection**.—We are not all called to the sacrifice of martyrdom; but
we are all bound to make our lives a continued sacrifice of ourselves to
God, and to perform every action in this perfect spirit of sacrifice.
Thus we shall both live and die to God, perfectly resigned to His holy
will in all His appointments.
