### September 16.—ST. CYPRIAN, Bishop, Martyr.

CYPRIAN was an African of noble birth, but of evil life, a pagan, and a
teacher of rhetoric. In middle life he was converted to Christianity,
and shortly after his baptism was ordained priest, and made Bishop of
Carthage, notwithstanding his resistance. When the persecution of Decius
broke out, he fled from his episcopal city, that he might be the better
able to minister to the wants of his flock, but returned on occasion of
a pestilence. Later on he was banished, and saw in a vision his future
martyrdom.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Being recalled
from exile, sentence of death was pronounced against him, which he
received with the words "Thanks be to God." His great desire was to die
whilst in the act of preaching the faith of Christ, and he had the
consolation of being surrounded at his martyrdom by crowds of his
faithful children. He was beheaded on the 14th of September, 258, and
was buried with great solemnity. Even the pagans respected his memory.

**Reflection**.—The duty of almsgiving is declared both by nature and
revelation: by nature, because it flows from the principle imprinted
within us of doing to others as we would they should do to us; by
revelation, in many special commands of Scripture, and in the precept of
divine charity which binds us to love God for His own sake, and our
neighbor for the sake of God.
