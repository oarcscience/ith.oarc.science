### April 16.—EIGHTEEN MARTYRS OF SARAGOSSA, and ST. ENCRATIS, or ENGRATIA, Virgin, Martyr.

ST. OPTATUS and seventeen other holy men received the crown of martyrdom
on the same day, at Saragossa, under the cruel Governor Dacian, in the
persecution of Diocletian, in 304. Two others, Caius and Crementius,
died of their torments after a second conflict.

The Church also celebrates on this day the triumph of St. Encratis, or
Engratia, Virgin. She was a native of Portugal. Her father had promised
her in marriage to a man of quality in Rousillon; but fearing the
dangers and despising the vanities of the world, and resolving to
preserve her virginity, in order to appear more agreeable to her
heavenly Spouse and serve Him without hindrance, she stole from her
father's house and fled privately to Saragossa, where the persecution
was hottest, under the eyes of Dacian. She even reproached him with his
barbarities, upon which he ordered her to be long tormented in the

most inhuman manner: her sides were torn with iron hooks, and one of her
breasts was cut off, so that the inner parts of her chest were exposed
to view, and part of her liver was pulled out. In this condition she was
sent back to prison, being still alive, and died by the mortifying of
her wounds, in 304. The relics of all these martyrs were found at
Saragossa in 1389.

**Reflection**.—Men do not pursue temporal goods at haphazard, or by
fits and starts. Let us be as punctual and orderly in the service of
God, not casting about for new paths, but perfecting our ordinary
devotions. If we persevere in these, Paradise is ours.
