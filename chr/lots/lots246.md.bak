### August 5.—THE DEDICATION OF ST. MARY AD NIVES.

THERE are in Rome three patriarchal churches, in which the Pope
officiates on different festivals. These are the Basilics of St. John
Lateran, St. Peter's on the Vatican Hill, and St. Mary Major. This last
is so called because it is, both in antiquity and dignity, the first
church in Rome among those that are dedicated to God in honor of the
Virgin Mary. The name of the Liberian Basilic was given it because it
was founded in the time of Pope Liberius, in the fourth century; it was
consecrated, under the title of the Virgin Mary, by Sixtus III., about
the year 435. It is also called St. Mary ad Nives, or *at the snow*,
from a popular tradition that the Mother of God chose this place for a
church under her invocation by a miraculous snow that fell upon this
spot in summer, and by a vision in which she appeared to a patrician
named John, who munificently founded and endowed this church in the
pontificate of Liberius. The same Basilic has sometimes been known by
the name of St. Mary *ad Præsepe*, from the holy crib or manger of
Bethlehem, in which Christ was laid at His birth. It resembles an
ordinary manger, is kept in a case of massive silver, and in it lies an
image of a little child, also of silver. On Christmas Day the holy
Manger is taken out of the case, and exposed. It is kept in a sumptuous
subterraneous chapel in this church.

**Reflection**.—To render our supplications the more efficacious, we
ought to unite them in spirit to those of all fervent penitents and
devout souls, in invoking this advocate for sinners.
