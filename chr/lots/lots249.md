### August 8.—ST. CYRIACUS and His Companions, Martyrs.

ST. CYRIACUS was a holy deacon at Rome, under the Popes Marcellinus and
Marcellus. In the persecution of Diocletian, in 303, he was crowned with
a glorious martyrdom in that city. With him suffered also Largua and
Smaragdus, and twenty others. Their bodies were first buried near the
place of their execution, on the Salarian Way, but were soon after
removed to a farm of the devout Lady Lucina, on the Ostian Road, on the
eighth day of August.

**Reflection**.—To honor the martyrs and duly celebrate their festivals,
we must learn their spirit and study to imitate them according to the
circumstances of our state. We must, like them, resist evil, must subdue
our passions, suffer afflictions with patience, and bear with others
without murmuring or complaining. The cross is the ladder by which we
must ascend to heaven.
