### September 27.—STS. COSMAS and DAMIAN, Martyrs.

STS. COSMAS and DAMIAN were brothers, and born in Arabia, but studied
the sciences in Syria, and became eminent for their skill in physic.
Being Christians, and full of that holy temper of charity in which the
spirit of our divine religion consists, they practised their profession
with great application and wonderful success, but never took any fee.
They were loved and respected by the people on account of the good
offices received from their charity, and for their zeal for the
Christian faith, which they took every opportunity to propagate. When
the persecution of Diocletian began to rage, it was impossible for
persons of so distinguished a character to lie concealed. They were
therefore apprehended by the order of Lysias, Governor of Cilicia, and
after various torments were bound hand and foot and thrown into the sea.

**Reflection**.—We may sanctify our labor or industry, if actuated by
the motive of charity toward others, even whilst we fulfil the
obligation we owe to ourselves and our families of procuring an honest
and necessary subsistence, which of itself is no less noble a virtue, if
founded in motives equally pure and perfect.
