### March 28.—ST. GONTRAN, King.

ST. GONTRAN was the son of King Clotaire, and grandson of Clovis I. and
St. Clotildis. Being the second son, whilst his brothers Charibert
reigned at Paris, and Sigebert in Ostrasia, residing at Metz, he was
crowned king of Orleans and Burgundy in 561, making Chalons his capital.
When compelled to take up arms against his ambitious brothers and the
Lombards, he made no other use of his victories, under the conduct of a
brave general called Mommol, than to give peace to his dominions. The
crimes in which the barbarous manners of his nation involved him he
effaced by tears of repentance. The prosperity of his reign, both in
peace and war, condemns those who think that human policy cannot be
modelled by the maxims of the Gospel, whereas nothing can render a
government more flourishing. He always treated the pastors of the Church
with respect and veneration. He was the protector of the oppressed, and
the tender parent of his subjects. He gave the greatest attention to the
care of the sick. He fasted, prayed, wept, and offered himself to God
night and day as a victim ready to be sacrificed on the altar of His
justice, to avert His indignation which he believed he himself had
provoked and drawn down upon his innocent people. He was a severe
punisher of crimes in his officers and others, and, by many wholesome
regulations, restrained the barbarous licentiousness of his troops; but
no man was more ready to forgive offences against his own person. With
royal magnificence he built and endowed many churches and monasteries.
This good king died on the 23rd of March in 593, in the sixty-eighth
year of his age, having reigned thirty-one years and some months.

**Reflection**.—There is no means of salvation more reliable than the
practice of mercy, since Our Lord has said it: "Blessed are the
merciful, for they shall find mercy."
