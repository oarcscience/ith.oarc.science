### January 25.—THE CONVERSION OF ST. PAUL.

THE great apostle Paul, named Saul at his circumcision, was born at
Tarsus, the capital of Silicia, and was by privilege a Roman citizen, to
which quality a great distinction and several exemptions were granted by
the laws of the empire. He was early instructed in the strict observance
of the Mosaic law, and lived up to it in the most scrupulous manner. In
his zeal for the Jewish law, which he thought the cause of God, he
became a violent persecutor of the Christians. He was one of those who
combined to murder St. Stephen, and in the violent persecution of the
faithful which followed the martyrdom of the holy deacon, Saul
signalized himself above others. By virtue of the power he had received
from the high priest, he dragged the Christians out of their houses,
loaded them with chains, and thrust them into prison. In the fury of his
zeal he applied for a commission to take up all Jews at Damascus who
confessed Jesus Christ, and bring them bound to Jerusalem, that they
might serve as examples for

the others. But God was pleased to show forth in him His patience and
mercy. While on his way to Damascus, he and his party were surrounded by
a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, and suddenly struck to the
ground. And then a voice was heard saying, "Saul, Saul, why dost thou
persecute Me?" And Saul answered, "Who art Thou, Lord?" and the voice
replied, "I am Jesus, Whom thou dost persecute." This mild expostulation
of Our Redeemer, accompanied with a powerful interior grace, cured
Saul's pride, assuaged his rage, and wrought at once a total change in
him. Wherefore, trembling and astonished, he cried out, "Lord, what wilt
Thou have me to do?" Our Lord ordered him to arise and to proceed on his
way to the city, where he should be informed of what was expected from
him. Saul, arising from the ground, found that, though his eyes were
open, he saw nothing. He was led by hand into Damascus, where he was
lodged in the house of a Jew named Judas. To this house came by divine
appointment a holy man named Ananias, who, laying his hands on Saul,
said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, Who appeared to thee on thy
journey, hath sent me that thou mayest receive thy sight and be filled
with the Holy Ghost." Immediately something like scales fell from Saul's
eyes, and he recovered his sight. Then he arose and was baptized; he
stayed some few days with the disciples at Damascus, and began
immediately to preach in the synagogues that Jesus was the Son of God.
Thus a blasphemer and a persecutor was made an apostle, and chosen as
one of God's principal instruments in the con. version of the world.

**Reflection**.—Listen to the words of the "Imitation of Christ," and
let them sink into your heart: "He who would keep the grace of God, let
him be grateful for grace when it is given, and patient when it is taken
away. Let him pray that it may be given back to him, and be careful and
humble, lest he lose it."
