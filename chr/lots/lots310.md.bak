### October 4.—ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI.

ST. FRANCIS, the son of a merchant of Assisi, was born in that city in
1182. Chosen by God to be a living manifestation to the world of
Christ's poor and suffering life on earth, he was early inspired with a
high esteem and burning love of poverty and humiliation. The thought of
the Man of Sorrows, Who had not where to lay His head, filled him with
holy envy of the poor, and constrained him to renounce the wealth and
worldly station which he abhorred. The scorn and hard usage which he met
with from his father and townsmen when he appeared among them in the
garb of poverty were delightful to him. "Now," he exclaimed, "I can say
truly, 'Our Father Who art in heaven.'" But divine love burned in him
too mightily not to kindle like desires in other hearts. Many joined
themselves to him, and were constituted by Pope Innocent III. into a
religious Order, which spread rapidly throughout Christendom. St.
Francis, after visiting the East in the vain quest of martyrdom, spent
his life like his Divine Master—now in preaching to the multitudes, now
amid desert solitudes in fasting and contemplation. During one of these
retreats he received on his hands, feet, and side the print of the five
bleeding wounds of Jesus. With the cry, "Welcome, sister Death," he
passed to the glory of his God October 4, 1226.

**Reflection**.—"My God and my all," St. Francis’ constant prayer,
explains both his poverty and his wealth.
