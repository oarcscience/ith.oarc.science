### November 1.—ALL-SAINTS.

THE Church pays, day by day, a special veneration to some one of the
holy men and women who have helped to establish it by their blood,
develop it by their labors, or edify it by their virtues. But, in
addition to those whom the Church honors by special designation, or has
inscribed in her calendar, how many martyrs are there whose names are
not recorded! How many humble virgins and holy penitents! How many just
and holy anchorites or young children snatched away in their innocence!
How many Christians who have died in grace, whose merits are known only
to God, and who are themselves known only in heaven! Now should we
forget those who remember us in their intercessions? Besides, are they
not our brethren, our ancestors, friends, and fellow-Christians, with
whom we have lived in daily companionship—in other words, our own
family? Yea, it is one family; and our place is marked out in this home
of eternal light and eternal love.

**Reflection**.—Let us have a solicitude to render ourselves worthy of
"that chaste generation, so beautiful amid the glory where it dwells."
