### May 20.—ST. BERNARDINE OF SIENA.

IN 1408 St. Vincent Ferrer once suddenly interrupted his sermon to
declare that there was among his hearers a young Franciscan who would be
one day a greater preacher than himself, and would be set before him in
honor by the Church. This unknown friar was Bernardine. Of noble birth,
he had spent his youth in works of mercy, and had then entered religion.
Owing to a defective utterance, his success as a preacher at first
seemed doubtful, but, by the prayers of Our Lady, this obstacle was
miraculously removed, and Bernardine began an apostolate which lasted
thirty-eight years. By his burning words and by the power of the Holy
Name of Jesus, which he displayed on a tablet at the end of his sermons,
he obtained miraculous conversions, and reformed the greater part of
Italy. But this success had to be exalted by the cross. The Saint was
denounced as a heretic and his devotion as idolatrous. After many trials
he lived to see his innocence proved, and a lasting memorial of his work
established in a church. The Feast of the Holy Name commemorates at once
his sufferings and his triumph. He died on Ascension Eve, 1444, while
his brethren were chanting the antiphon, "Father, I have manifested Thy
Name to men." St. Bernardine, when a youth, undertook the charge of a
holy old woman, a relation of his, who had been left destitute. She was
blind and bedridden, and during her long illness could only utter the
Holy Name. The Saint watched over her till she died, and thus learned
the devotion of his life.

**Reflection**.—Let us learn from the life of St. Bernardine the power
of the Holy Name in life and death.
