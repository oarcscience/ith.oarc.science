### August 30.—ST. ROSE OF LIMA.

THIS lovely flower of sanctity, the first canonized Saint of the New
World, was born at Lima in 1586. She was christened Isabel, but the
beauty of her infant face earned for her the title of Rose, which she
ever after bore. As a child, while still in the cradle, her silence
under a painful surgical operation proved the thirst for suffering
already consuming her heart. At an early age she took service to support
her impoverished parents, and worked for them day and night. In spite of
hardships and austerities her beauty ripened with increasing age, and
she was much and openly admired. From fear of vanity she cut off her
hair, blistered her face with pepper and her hands with lime. For
further security she enrolled herself in the Third Order of St. Dominic,
took St. Catherine of Siena as her model, and redoubled her penance. Her
cell was a garden hut, her couch a box of broken tiles. Under her habit
Rose wore a hair-shirt studded with iron nails, while, concealed by her
veil, a silver crown armed with ninety points encircled her head. More
than once, when she shuddered at the prospect of a night of torture, a
voice said, "My cross was yet more painful." The Blessed Sacrament
seemed almost her only food. Her love for it was intense. When the Dutch
fleet prepared to attack the town, Rose took her place before the
tabernacle, and wept that she was not worthy to die in its defence. All
her sufferings were offered for the conversion of sinners, and the
thought of the multitudes in hell was ever before her soul. She died in
1617, at the age of thirty-one.

**Reflection**.—Rose, pure as driven snow, was filled with deepest
contrition and humility, and did constant and terrible penance. Our sins
are continual, our repentance passing, our contrition slight, our
penance nothing. How will it fare with us?
