### September 19.—ST. JANUARIUS, Martyr.

MANY centuries ago, St. Januarius died for the Faith in the persecution
of Diocletian, and to this day God confirms the faith of His Church, and
works a continual miracle, through the blood which Januarius shed for
Him. The Saint was Bishop of Beneventum, and on one occasion he
travelled to Misenum in order to visit a deacon named Sosius. During
this visit Januarius saw the head of Sosius, who was singing the gospel
in the church, girt with flames, and took this for a sign that ere long
Sosius would wear the crown of martyrdom. So it proved. Shortly after
Sosius was arrested, and thrown into prison. There St. Januarius visited
and encouraged him, till the bishop also was arrested in turn. Soon the
number of the confessors was swollen by some of the neighboring clergy.
They were exposed to the wild beasts in the amphitheatre. The beasts,
however, did them no harm; and at last the Governor of Campania ordered
the Saints to be beheaded. Little did the heathen governor think that he
was the instrument in God's hand of ushering in the long succession of
miracles which attest the faith of Januarius. The relics of St.
Januarius rest in the cathedral of Naples, and it is there that the
liquefaction of his blood occurs. The blood is congealed in two glass
vials, but when it is brought near the martyr's head it melts and flows
like the blood of a living man.

**Reflection**.—Thank God Who has given you superabundant motives for
your faith; and pray for the spirit of the first Christians, the spirit
which exults and rejoices in belief.
