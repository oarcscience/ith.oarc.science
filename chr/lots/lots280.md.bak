### September 6.—ST. ELEUTHERIUS, Abbot.

WONDERFUL simplicity and spirit of compunction were the distinguishing
virtues of this holy man. He was chosen abbot of St. Mark's near
Spoleto, and favored by God with the gift of miracles. A child who was
possessed by the devil, being delivered by being educated in his
monastery, the abbot said one day: "Since the child is among the
servants of God, the devil dares not approach him." These words seemed
to savor of vanity, and thereupon the devil again entered and tormented
the child. The abbot humbly confessed his fault, and fasted and prayed
with his whole community till the child was again freed from the tyranny
of the fiend. St. Gregory the Great not being able to fast on Easter-eve
on account of extreme weakness, engaged this Saint to go with him to the
church of St. Andrew's and put up his prayers to God for his health,
that he might join the faithful in that solemn practice of penance.
Eleutherius prayed with many tears, and the Pope, coming out of the
church, found his breast suddenly strengthened, so that he was enabled
to perform the fast as he desired. St. Eleutherius raised a dead man to
life. Resigning his abbacy, he died in St. Andrew's monastery in Rome,
about the year 585.

**Reflection**.—"Appear not to men to fast, but to thy Father Who is in
heaven, and thy Father, Who seeth in secret, He will repay thee."
