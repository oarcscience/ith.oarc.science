### December 25.—THE NATIVITY OF CHRIST, OR CHRISTMAS DAY.

THE world had subsisted about four thousand years when Jesus Christ, the
eternal Son of God, having taken human flesh in the womb of the Virgin
Mary, and being made man, was born of her, for the redemption of
mankind, at Bethlehem of Judea. Joseph and Mary had come up to Bethlehem
to be enrolled, and, unable to find shelter elsewhere, they took refuge
in a stable, and in this lowly place Jesus Christ was born. The Blessed
Virgin wrapped the divine Infant in swaddling-clothes, and laid Him in
the manger. While the sensual and the proud were asleep, an angel
appeared to some poor shepherds. They were seized with great fear, but
the heavenly messenger said to them: "Fear not: for behold I bring you
good tidings of exceeding great joy, that shall be to all the people.
For this day is born to you a Saviour, Who is Christ the Lord, in the
city of David. And this shall be a sign to you: you shall find the Child
wrapped in swaddling-clothes, and laid in a manger." After the departure
of the angel the wondering shepherds said to one another: "Let us go
over to Bethlehem, and let us see the word that is come to pass, which
the Lord hath shown to us." They immediately hastened thither, and found
Mary and Joseph, and the Infant lying in the manger. Bowing down they
adored Him, and then returned to their flocks, glorifying and praising
God.

**Reflection**.—Our Saviour sanctified our flesh by taking it on
Himself, and with His last breath He commended us to the care of His
Virgin Mother. Day by day He still feeds us at the altar with the food
of incorruption—His body and His blood.
