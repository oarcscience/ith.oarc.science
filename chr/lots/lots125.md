### April 17.—ST. ANICETUS, Pope, Martyr.

ST. ANICETUS succeeded St. Pius, and sat about eight years, from 165 to
173. If he did not shed his blood for the Faith, he at least purchased
the title of martyr by great sufferings and dangers. He received a visit
from St. Polycarp, and tolerated the custom of the Asiatics in
celebrating Easter on the 14th day of the first moon after the vernal
equinox, with the Jews. His vigilance protected his flock from the wiles
of the heretics Valentine and Marcion, who sought to corrupt the faith
in the capital of the world.

The first thirty-six bishops at Rome, down to Liberius, and, this one
excepted, all the popes to Symmachus, the fifty-second, in 498, are
honored among the Saints; and out of two hundred and forty-eight popes,
from St. Peter to Clement XIII. seventy-eight are named in the Roman
Martyrology. In the primitive ages, the spirit of fervor and perfect
sanctity, which is nowadays so rarely to be found, was conspicuous in
most of the faithful, and especially in their pastors. The whole tenor
of their lives breathed it in such a manner as to render them the
miracles of the world, angels on earth, living copies of their divine
Redeemer, the odor of whose virtues and holy law and religion they
spread on every side.

**Reflection**.—If, after making the most solemn protestations of
inviolable friendship and affection for a fellow-creature,

we should the next moment revile and contemn him, without having
received any provocation or affront, and this habitually, would not the
whole world justly call our protestations hypocrisy, and our pretended
friendship a mockery? Let us by this rule judge if our love of God be
sovereign, so long as our inconstancy betrays the insincerity of our
hearts.
