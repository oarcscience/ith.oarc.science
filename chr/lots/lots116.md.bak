### April 9.—ST. MARY OF EGYPT.

AT the tender age of twelve, Mary left her father's house that she might
sin without restraint, and for seventeen years she lived in shame at
Alexandria. Then she accompanied a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and
entangled many in grievous sin. She was in that city on the Feast of the
Exaltation of the Holy Cross, and went with the crowd to the church
which contained the precious wood. The rest entered and adored; but Mary
was invisibly held back. In that instant her misery and pollution burst
upon her. Turning to the Immaculate Mother, whose picture faced her in
the porch, she vowed thenceforth to do penance if she might enter and
stand like Magdalen beside the Cross. Then she entered in. As she knelt
before Our Lady on leaving the church, a voice came to her which said,
"Pass

over Jordan, and thou shalt find rest." She went into the wilderness,
and there, in 420, forty-seven years after, the Abbot Zosimus met her.
She told him that for seventeen years the old songs and scenes had
haunted her; ever since, she had had perfect peace. At her request he
brought her on Holy Thursday the sacred body of Christ. She bade him
return again after a year, and this time he found her corpse upon the
sand, with an inscription sayings "Bury here the body of Mary the
sinner."

**Reflection**.—Blessed John Colombini was converted to God by reading
St. Mary's life. Let us, too, learn from her not to be content with
confessing and lamenting our sins, but to fly from what leads us to
commit them.
