### September 23.—ST. THECLA, Virgin, Martyr.

ST. THECLA is one of the most ancient, as she is one of the most
illustrious, Saints in the calendar of the Church. It was at Iconium
that St. Paul met St. Thecla, and kindled the love of virginity in her
heart. She had been promised in marriage to a young man who was rich and
generous. But at the Apostle's words she died to the thought of earthly
espousals; she forgot her beauty; she was deaf to her parents threats,
and at the first opportunity she fled from a luxurious home and followed
St. Paul. The rage of her parents and of her intended spouse followed
hard upon her; and the Roman power did its worst against the virgin whom
Christ had chosen for His own. She was stripped and placed in the public
theatre; but her innocence shrouded her like a garment. Then the lions
were let loose against her; they fell crouching at her feet, and licked
them as if in veneration. Even fire could not harm her. Torment after
torment was inflicted upon her without effect, till at last her Spouse
spoke the word and called her to Himself, with the double crown of
virginity and martyrdom on her head.

**Reflection**.—It is purity in soul and body which will make you strong
in pain, in temptation, and in the hour of death. Imitate the purity of
this glorious virgin, and take her for your special patroness in your
last agony.
