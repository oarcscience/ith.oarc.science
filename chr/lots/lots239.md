### July 30.—ST. GERMANUS, Bishop.

IN his youth Germanus gave little sign of sanctity. He was of noble
birth, and at first practised the law at Rome. After a time the emperor
placed him high in the army. But his one passion was the chase. He was
so carried away as even to retain in his sports the superstitions of the
pagan huntsmen. Yet it was revealed to the Bishop of Auxerre that
Germanus would be his successor, and he gave him the tonsure almost by
main force. Forthwith Germanus became another man, and, making ever his
lands to the Church, adopted a life of humble penance. At that time the
Pelagian heresy was laying waste England, and Germanus was chosen by the
reigning Pontiff to rescue the Britons from the snare of Satan. With St.
Lupus he preached in the fields and highways throughout the land. At
last, near Verulam, he met the heretics face to face, and overcame them
utterly with the Catholic and Roman faith. He ascribed this triumph to
the intercession of St. Alban, and offered public thanks at his shrine.
Towards the end of his stay, his old skill in arms won over the Picts
and Scots the complete but bloodless "Alleluia" victory, so called
because the newly-baptized Britons, led by the Saint, routed the enemy
with the Paschal cry. Germanus visited England a second

time with St. Severus. He died in 448, while interceding with the
emperor for the people of Brittany.

**Reflection**.—"Hold the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of
me in faith, and in the love which is in Christ Jesus" (II. Tim. i. 13).
