### March 25.—THE ANNUNCIATION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY.

THIS great festival takes its name from the happy tidings brought by the
angel Gabriel to the Blessed Virgin, concerning the Incarnation of the
Son of God. It commemorates the most important embassy that was ever

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

known: an embassy sent by the King of kings, performed by one of the
chief princes of His heavenly court; directed, not to the great ones of
this earth, but to a poor, unknown virgin, who, being endowed with the
most angelic purity of soul and body, being withal perfectly humble and
devoted to God, was greater in His eyes than the mightiest monarch in
the world. When the Son of God became man, He could have taken upon Him
our nature without the cooperation of any creature; but He was pleased
to be born of a woman. In the choice of her whom He raised to this most
sublime of all dignities, He pitched upon the one who, by the riches of
His grace and virtues, was of all others the most holy and the most
perfect. The design of this embassy of the archangel is to give a
Saviour to the world, a victim of propitiation to the sinner, a model to
the just, a son to this Virgin, remaining still a virgin, and a new
nature to the Son of God, the nature of man, capable of suffering pain
and anguish in order to satisfy God's justice for our transgressions.

When the angel appeared to Mary and addressed her, the Blessed Virgin
was troubled: not at the angel's appearance, says St. Ambrose, for
heavenly visions and a commerce with the blessed spirits had been
familiar to her; but what alarmed her, he says, was the angel's
appearing in human form, in the shape of a young man. What might add to
her fright on the occasion was his addressing her in words of praise.
Mary, guarded by her modesty, is in confusion at expressions of this
sort, and dreads the least appearance of deluding flattery. Such high
commendations make her cautious how she answers, till in silence she has
more fully considered of the matter: "She revolved in her mind," says
St. Luke, "what manner of salutation this should be." Ah, what numbers
of innocent souls have been corrupted for want of using the like
precautions!

The angel, to calm her, says: "Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favor
before God." He then informs her that she is to conceive and bring forth
a Son Whose name shall be Jesus, Who shall be great, and the Son of the
Most High, and possessed of the throne of David, her illustrious
ancestor. Mary, out of a just concern to know how she

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

may comply with the will of God without prejudice to her vow of
virginity, inquires, "How shall this be?" Nor does she give her consent
till the heavenly messenger acquaints her that it is to be a work of the
Holy Ghost, who, in making her fruitful, will not intrench in the least
upon her virginal purity.

In submission, therefore, to God's will, without any further inquiries,
she expresses her assent in these humble but powerful words: "Behold the
handmaid of the Lord; be it done to me according to Thy word" What faith
and confidence does her answer express! what profound humility and
perfect obedience!

**Reflection**.—From the example of the Blessed Virgin in this mystery,
how ardent a love ought we to conceive of purity and humility! The Holy
Ghost is invited by purity to dwell in souls, but is chased away by the
filth of the contrary vice. Humility is the foundation of a spiritual
life. By it Mary was prepared for the extraordinary graces and all
virtues with which she was enriched, and for the eminent dignity of
Mother of God.
