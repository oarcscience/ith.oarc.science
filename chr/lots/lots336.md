### October 30.—ST. MARCELLUS, THE CENTURION, Martyr.

THE birthday of the Emperor Maximian Herculeus, in the year 298, was
celebrated with extraordinary feasting and solemnity. Marcellus, a
Christian centurion or captain in the legion of Trajan, then posted in
Spain, not to defile himself with taking part in those impious
abominations, left his company, declaring aloud that he was a soldier of
Jesus Christ, the eternal King. He was at once committed to prison. When
the festival was over, Marcellus was brought before a judge, and, having
declared his faith, was sent under a strong guard to Aurelian
Agricolaus, vicar to the prefect of the prætorium, who passed sentence
of death upon him. St. Marcellus was forthwith led to execution, and
beheaded on the 30th of October. Cassian, the secretary or notary of the
court, refused to write the sentence pronounced against the martyr,
because it was unjust. He was immediately hurried to prison, and was
beheaded, about a month after, on the 3d of December.

**Reflection**.—"We are ready to die rather than to transgress the laws
of God!" exclaimed one of the Machabees. This sentiment should ever be
that of a Christian in presence of temptation.
