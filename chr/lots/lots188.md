### June 11.—ST. BARNABAS, Apostle.

WE read that in the first days of the Church, "the multitude of
believers had but one heart and one soul; neither did any one say that
aught of the things which he possessed was his own." Of this fervent
company, one only is singled out by name, Joseph, a rich Levite, from
Cyprus. "He having land sold it, and brought the price and laid it at
the feet of the apostles." They now gave him a new name, Barnabas, the
son of consolation. He was a good man, full of the Holy Ghost and of
faith, and was soon chosen for an important mission to the
rapidly-growing Church of Antioch. Here he perceived the great work
which was to be done among the Greeks, so he hastened to fetch St. Paul
from his retirement at Tarsus. It was at Antioch that the two Saints
were called to the apostolate of the Gentiles, and hence they set out
together to Cyprus and the cities of Asia Minor. Their preaching struck
men with amazement, and some cried out, "The gods are come down to us in
the likeness of men," calling Paul *Mercury*, and Barnabas *Jupiter*.
The Saints travelled together to the Council of Jerusalem, but shortly
after this they parted. When Agabus prophesied a great famine, Barnabas,
no longer rich, was chosen by the faithful at Antioch as most fit to
bear, with St. Paul, their generous offerings to the Church of
Jerusalem. The gentle Barnabas, keeping with him John, surnamed Mark,
whom St. Paul distrusted, betook

himself to Cyprus, where the sacred history leaves him; and here, at a
later period, he won his martyr's crown.

**Reflection**.—St. Barnabas's life is full of suggestions to us who
live in days when once more the abundant alms of the faithful are sorely
needed by the whole Church, from the Sovereign Pontiff to the poor
children in our streets.
