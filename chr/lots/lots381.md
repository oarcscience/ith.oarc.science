### December 12.—ST. VALERY, Abbot.—ST. FINIAN, Bishop.

THIS Saint was born at Auvergne, in the sixth century, O and in his
childhood kept his father's sheep. He was yet young when he took the
monastic habit in the neighboring monastery of St. Antony. Seeking the
most perfect means of advancing in the paths of all virtues, he passed
from this house to the more austere monastery of St. Germanus of
Auxerre, and finally to that of Luxeuil, where he spent many years. He
travelled into Neustria, where he converted many infidels, and assembled
certain fervent disciples, and laid the foundation of a monastery. Saint
Valery went to receive the recompense of his happy perseverance on the
12th of December in 622.

ST. FINIAN was a native of Leinster, was instructed in the elements of
Christian virtue by the disciples of St. Patrick, and passed over into
Wales; but about the year 520 he returned into Ireland. To propagate the
work of God, our Saint established several monasteries and schools. St.
Finian was chosen and consecrated Bishop of Clonard. In the love of his
flock and his zeal for their salvation he was infirm with the infirm,
and wept with those that wept. He healed the souls, and often also the
bodies, of those that applied to him. He departed to Our Lord on the
12th of December in 552.
