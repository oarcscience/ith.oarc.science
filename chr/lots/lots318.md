### October 12.—ST. WILFRID, Bishop.

"A QUICK walker, expert at all good works, with never a sour face"—such
was the great St. Wilfrid, whose glory it was to secure the happy links
which bound England to Rome. He was born about the year 634, and was
trained by the Celtic monks at Lindisfarne in the peculiar rites and
usages of the British Church. Yet even as a boy Wilfrid longed for
perfect conformity in discipline, as in doctrine, with the Holy See, and
at the first chance set off himself for Rome. On his return he founded
at Ripon a strictly Roman monastery, under the rule of St. Benedict. In
the year 664 he was elected Bishop of Lindisfarne, and five years later
was transferred to the see of York. He had to combat the passions of
wicked kings, the cowardice of worldly prelates, the errors of holy men.
He was twice exiled and once imprisoned; yet the battle which he fought
was won. He swept away the abuses of many years and a too national
system, and substituted instead a vigorous Catholic discipline, modelled
and dependent on Rome. He died October 12, 709, and at his death was
heard the sweet melody of the angels conducting his soul to Christ.

**Reflection**.—To look towards Rome is an instinct planted in us for
the preservation of the Faith. Trust in the Vicar of Christ necessarily
results from the reign of His love in our hearts.
