### July 27.—ST. PANTALEON, Martyr.

T. PANTALEON was physician to the Emperor Galerius Maximianus, and a
Christian, but, deceived by often hearing the false maxims of the world
applauded, was unhappily seduced into an apostasy. But a zealous

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Christian called
Hermolaus awakened his conscience to a sense of his guilt, and brought
him again into the fold of the Church. The penitent ardently wished to
expiate his crime by martyrdom; and to prepare himself for the conflict,
when Diocletian's bloody persecution broke out at Nicomedia, in 303, he
distributed all his possessions among the poor. Not long after this
action he was taken up, and in his house were also apprehended
Hermolaus, Hermippus, and Hermocrates. After suffering many torments,
they were all condemned to lose their heads. St. Pantaleon suffered the
day after the rest. His relics were translated to Constantinople, and
there kept with great honor. The greatest part of them are now shown in
the abbey of St. Denys near Paris, but his head is at Lyons.

**Reflection**.—"With the elect thou shalt be elect, and with the
perverse wilt be perverted."
