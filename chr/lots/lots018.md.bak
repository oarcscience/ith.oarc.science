### January 8.—ST. APOLLINARIS, THE APOLOGIST, Bishop.

CLAUDIUS APOLLINARIS, Bishop of Hierapolis in Phrygia, was one of the
most illustrious prelates of the second age. Notwithstanding the great
encomiums bestowed on him by Eusebius, St. Jerome, Theodoret, and
ethers, but little is known of his actions; and his writings,

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

which then were held in great esteem, seem now to be all lost. He wrote
many able treatises against the heretics, and pointed out, as St. Jerome
testifies, from what philosophical sect each heresy derived its errors.
Nothing rendered his name so illustrious, however, as his noble apology
for the Christian religion which he addressed to the Emperor Marcus
Aurelius, about the year 175, soon after the miraculous victory that
prince had obtained over the Quadi by the prayers of the Christians. St.
Apollinaris reminded the emperor of the benefit he had received from God
through the prayers of his Christian subjects, and implored protection
for them against the persecution of the pagans. Marcus Aurelius
published an edict in which he forbade any one, under pain of death, to
accuse a Christian on account of his religion; by a strange
inconsistency, he had not the courage to abolish the laws then in force
against the Christians, and, as a consequence, many of them suffered
martyrdom, though their accusers were also put to death. The date of St.
Apollinaris' death is not known; the Roman Martyrology mentions him on
the 8th of January.

**Reflection**.—"Therefore I say unto you, all things whatsoever you ask
when you pray, believe that you shall receive: and they shall come unto
you."
