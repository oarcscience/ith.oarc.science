### September 7.—ST. CLOUD, Confessor.

ST. CLOUD is the first and most illustrious Saint among the princes of
the royal family of the first race in France. He was son of Chlodomir,
King of Orleans, the eldest son of St. Clotilda, and was born in 522. He
was scarce three years old when his father was killed in Burgundy; but
his grandmother Clotilda brought up him and his two brothers at Paris,
and loved them extremely. Their ambitious uncles divided the kingdom of
Orleans between them, and stabbed with their own hands two of their
nephews. Cloud, by a special providence, was saved from the massacre,
and, renouncing the world, devoted himself to the service of God in a
monastic state. After a time he put himself under the discipline of St.
Severinus, a holy recluse who lived near Paris, from whose hands he
received the monastic habit. Wishing to live unknown to the world, he
withdrew secretly into Provence, but his hermitage being made public, he
returned to Paris, and was received with the greatest joy imaginable. At
the earnest request of the people, he was ordained priest by Eusebius,
Bishop of Paris, in 551, and served that Church some time in the
functions of the sacred ministry. He afterward retired to St. Cloud, two
leagues below Paris, where he built a monastery. Here he assembled many
pious men, who fled out of the world for fear of losing their souls in
it. St. Cloud was regarded by them as their superior, and he animated
them to all virtue both by word and example. He was indefatigable in
instructing and exhorting the people of the neighboring country, and
piously ended his days about the year 560.

**Reflection**.—Let us remember that "the just shall live for evermore;
they shall receive a kingdom of glory, and a grown of beauty at the hand
of the Lord."
