### July 28.—STS. NAZARIUS and CELSUS, Martyrs.

T. NAZARIUS's father was a heathen, and held a considerable post in the
Roman army. His mother, Perpetua, was a zealous Christian, and was
instructed by St. Peter, or his disciples, in the most perfect maxims of
our holy faith. Nazarius embraced it with so much ardor that he copied
in his life all the great virtues he saw in his teachers; and out of
zeal for the salvation of others, he left Rome, his native city, and
preached the Faith in many places with a fervor and disinterestedness
becoming a disciple of the apostles. Arriving at Milan, he was there
beheaded for the Faith, together with Celsus, a youth whom he carried
with him to assist him in his travels. These martyrs suffered soon after
Nero had raised the first persecution. Their bodies were buried
separately in a garden without the city, where they were discovered and
taken up by St. Ambrose, in 395. In the tomb of St. Nazarius, a vial of
the Saint's blood was found as fresh and red as if it had been spilt
that day. The faithful stained handkerchiefs with some drops, and also
formed a certain paste with it, a portion of which St. Ambrose sent to
St. Gaudentius, Bishop of Brescia. St. Ambrose conveyed

the bodies of the two martyrs into the new church .of the apostles,
which he had just built. A woman was delivered of an evil spirit in
their presence. St. Ambrose sent some of these relics to St. Paulinus of
Nola, who received them with great respect, as a most valuable present,
as he testifies.

**Reflection**.—The martyrs died as the outcasts of the world, but are
crowned by God with immortal honor. The glory of the world is false and
transitory, and an empty bubble or shadow, but that of virtue is true,
solid, and permanent, even in the eyes of men.
