### May 31.—ST. PETRONILLA, Virgin.

AMONG the disciples of the apostles in the primitive age of saints this
holy virgin shone as a bright star in the Church. She lived when
Christians were more solicitous to live well than to write much: they
knew how to die for Christ, but did not compile long books in which
vanity has often a greater share than charity. Hence no particular
account of her actions has been handed down to us. But how eminent her
sanctity was we may judge from the lustre by which it was distinguished
among apostles, prophets, and martyrs. She is said to have been a
daughter of the apostle St. Peter; that St. Peter was married before his
vocation to the apostleship we learn from the Gospel. St. Clement of
Alexandria assures us that his wife attained to the glory of martyrdom,
at which Peter himself encouraged her, bidding her to remember Our Lord.
But it seems not certain whether St. Petronilla was more than the
spiritual daughter of that apostle. She flourished at Rome, and was
buried on the way to Ardea,

where in ancient times a cemetery and a church bore her name.

**Reflection**.—With the saints the great end for which they lived was
always present to their minds, and they thought every moment lost in
which they did not make some advances toward eternal bliss. How will
their example condemn at the last day the trifling fooleries and the
greatest part of the conversation and employments of the world, which
aim at nothing but present amusements, and forget the only important
affair—the business of eternity.
