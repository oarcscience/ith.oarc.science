### October 6.—ST. BRUNO.

BRUNO was born at Cologne, about 1030, of an illustrious family. He was
endowed with rare natural gifts, which he cultivated with care at Paris.
He became canon of Cologne, and then of Rheims, where he had the
direction of theological studies. On the death of the bishop the see
fell for a time into evil hands, and Bruno retired with a few friends
into the country. There he resolved to forsake the world, and to live a
life of retirement and penance. With six companions he applied to Hugh,
Bishop of Grenoble, who led them into a wild solitude called the
Chartreuse. There they lived in poverty, self-denial, and silence, each
apart in his own cell, meeting

only for the worship of God, and employing themselves in copying books.
From the name of the spot the Order of St. Bruno was called the
Carthusian. Six years later, Urban II. called Bruno to Rome, that he
might avail himself of his guidance. Bruno tried to live there as he had
lived in the desert; but the echoes of the great city disturbed his
solitude, and, after refusing high dignities, he wrung from the Pope
permission to resume his monastic life in Calabria. There he lived, in
humility and mortification and great peace, till his blessed death in
1101.

**Reflection**.—"O everlasting kingdom," said St. Augustine; "kingdom of
endless ages, whereon rests the untroubled light and the peace of God
which passeth all understanding, where the souls of the Saints are in
rest, and everlasting joy is on their heads, and sorrow and sighing have
fled away! When shall I come and appear before God?"
