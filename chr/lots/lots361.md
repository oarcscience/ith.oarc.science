### November 22.—ST. CECILIA, Virgin, Martyr.

IN the evening of her wedding-day, with the music of the marriage-hymn
ringing in her ears, Cecilia, a rich, beautiful, and noble Roman maiden,
renewed the vow by which she had consecrated her virginity to God. "Pure

be my heart and undefiled my flesh; for I have a spouse you know not
of—an angel of my Lord." The heart of her young husband Valerian was
moved by her words; he 'received Baptism, and within a few days he and
his brother Tiburtius, who had been brought by him to a knowledge of the
Faith, sealed their confession with their blood. Cecilia only remained.
"Do you not know," was her answer to the threats of the prefect, "that I
am the bride of my Lord Jesus Christ?" The death appointed for her was
suffocation, and she remained a day and a night in a hot-air bath,
heated seven times its wont. But "the flames had no power over her body,
neither was a hair of her head singed." The lictor sent to dispatch her
struck with trembling hand the three blows which the law allowed, and
left her still alive. For two days and nights Cecilia lay with her head,
half severed on the pavement of her bath, fully sensible, and joyfully
awaiting her crown; on the third the agony was over, and in 177 the
virgin Saint gave back her pure spirit to Christ.

**Reflection**.—St. Cecilia teaches us to rejoice in every sacrifice as
a pledge of our love of Christ, and to welcome sufferings and death as
hastening our union with Him.
