### June 9.—STS. PRIMUS and FELICIANUS, Martyrs.

THESE two martyrs were brothers, and lived in Rome, toward the latter
part of the third century, for many years, mutually encouraging each
other in the practice of all good works. They seemed to possess nothing
but for the poor, and often spent both nights and days with the
confessors in their dungeons, or at the places of their torments and
execution. Some they encouraged to perseverance, others, who had fallen,
they raised again, and they made themselves the servants of all in
Christ, that all might attain to salvation through Him. Though their
zeal was most remarkable, they had escaped the dangers of many bloody
persecutions, and were grown old in the heroic exercises of virtue, when
it pleased God to crown their labors with a glorious martyrdom. The
pagans raised so great an outcry against them that they were both
apprehended and put in chains. They were inhumanly scourged, and then
sent to a town twelve miles from Rome to be farther chastised, as avowed
enemies to the gods. There they were cruelly tortured, first both
together, afterward separately. But the grace of God strengthened them,
and they were at length both beheaded on the 9th of June.

**Reflection**.—A soul which truly loves God regards all the things of
this world as nothing. The loss of goods, the disgrace of the world,
torments, sickness, and other afflictions are bitter to the senses, but
appear light to him that loves. If we cannot bear our trials with
patience and silence, it is because we love God only in words. "One who
is slothful and lukewarm complains of everything,

and calls the lightest precepts hard," says Thomas à Kempis.
