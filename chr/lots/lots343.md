ST. BERTILLE was born of one of the most illustrious families in the
territory of Soissons, in the reign of Dagobert I. As she grew up she
learned perfectly to despise the world, and earnestly desired to
renounce it. Not daring to tell this to her parents, she first consulted
St. Ouen, by whom she was encouraged in her resolution. The Saint's
parents were then made acquainted with her desire, which God inclined
them not to oppose. They conducted her to Jouarre, a great monastery in
Brie, four leagues from Meaux, where she was received with great joy and
trained up in the strictest practice of monastic perfection. By her

and acquitted herself with such great charity land edification that she
was chosen prioress to assist the

abbess in her administration. About the year 646 she was appointed first
abbess of the abbey of Chelles, which she governed for forty-six years
with equal vigor and discretion, until she closed her penitential life
in 692.
