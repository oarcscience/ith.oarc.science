### July 20.—ST. MARGARET, Virgin and Martyr.

ACCORDING to the ancient Martyrologies, St. Margaret suffered at Antioch
in Pisidia, in the last general persecution. She is said to have been
instructed in the Faith by a Christian nurse, to have been persecuted by
her own father, a pagan priest, and, after many torments, to have
gloriously finished her martyrdom by the sword. From the East, her
veneration was exceedingly propagated in England, France, and Germany,
in the eleventh century, during the holy wars. Her body is now kept at
Monte-Fiascone in Tuscany.
