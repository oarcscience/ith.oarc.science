### October 21.—ST. URSULA, Virgin and Martyr.

A NUMBER of Christian families had intrusted the education of their
children to the care of the pious Ursula, and some persons of the world
had in like manner placed themselves under her direction. England being
then harassed by the Saxons, Ursula deemed that she ought, after the
example of many of her compatriots, to seek an asylum in Gaul. She met
with an abiding-place on the borders of the Rhine, not far from Cologne,
where she hoped to find undisturbed repose; but a horde of Huns having
invaded the country, she was exposed, together with all those who were
under her guardianship, to the most shameful outrages. Without wavering,
they preferred one and all to meet death rather than incur shame. Ursula
herself gave the example, and was, together with her companions, cruelly
massacred in the year 453. The name of St. Ursula has from remote ages
been held in great honor throughout the Church; she has always been
regarded as the patroness of young persons and the model of teachers.

Reflection.—In the estimation of the wise man, "the guarding of virtue"
is the most important part of the education of youth.
