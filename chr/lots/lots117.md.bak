### ST. JOHN THE ALMONER.

ST. JOHN was married, but when his wife and two children died he
considered it a call from God to lead a perfect life. He began to give
away all he possessed in alms, and became known throughout the East as
the Almoner. He was appointed Patriarch of Alexandria; but before he
would take possession of his see he told his servants to go over the
town and bring him a list of his lords—meaning the poor. They brought
word that there were seventy-five hundred of them, and these he
undertook to feed every day. On Wednesday and Friday in every week he
sat on a bench before the church, to hear the complaints of the needy
and aggrieved; nor would he permit his servants to taste food until
their wrongs were redressed. The fear of death was ever before him, and
he never spoke an idle word. He turned those out of church whom he saw
talking, and forbade all detractors to enter his house. He left seventy
churches in Alexandria, where he had found but seven. A merchant
received from St. John five pounds weight of gold to buy merchandise.
Having suffered shipwreck and lost all, he had again recourse to John,
who said, "Some of your merchandise was ill-gotten," and gave him ten
pounds more; but the next voyage he lost ship as well as goods. John
then said, "The ship was wrongfully acquired. Take fifteen pounds of
gold, buy

corn with it, and put it on one of my ships." This time the merchant was
carried by the winds without his own knowledge to England, where there
was a famine; and he sold the corn for its weight in tin, and on his
return he found the tin changed to finest silver. St. John died in
Cyprus, his native place, about the year 619.

**Reflection**.—What sacrifices can we make for the poor which will seem
enough, when we reflect that mercy to them is our only means of repaying
Jesus Christ, Who sacrificed His life for us?
