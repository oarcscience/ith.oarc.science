### ST. IGNATIUS, Bishop, Martyr.

ST. IGNATIUS, Bishop of Antioch, was the disciple of St. John. When
Domitian persecuted the Church, St. Ignatius obtained peace for his own
flock by fasting and prayer. But for his part he desired to suffer with
Christ, and to prove himself a perfect disciple. In the year 107, Trajan
came to Antioch, and forced the Christians to choose between apostasy
and death. "Who art thou, poor devil," the emperor said when Ignatius
was brought before him, "who settest our commands at naught?" "Call not
him 'poor devil,'" Ignatius answered, "who bears God within him." And
when the emperor questioned him about his meaning, Ignatius explained
that he bore in his heart Christ crucified for his sake. Thereupon the
emperor condemned him to be torn to pieces by wild beasts at Rome. St.
Ignatius thanked God, Who had so honored him, "binding him in the chains
of Paul, His apostle."

He journeyed to Rome, guarded by soldiers, and with no fear except of
losing the martyr's crown. He was devoured by lions in the Roman
amphitheatre. The wild beasts left nothing of his body, except a few
bones, which were reverently treasured at Antioch, until their removal
to the Church of St. Clement at Rome, in 637. After the

martyr's death, several Christians saw him in vision standing before
Christ, and interceding for them.

**Reflection**.—Ask St. Ignatius to obtain for you the grace of
profiting by all you have to suffer, and rejoicing in it as a means of
likeness to your crucified Redeemer.
