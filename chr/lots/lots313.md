### October 7.—ST. MARK, Pope.

ST. MARK was by birth a Roman, and served God with such fervor among the
clergy of that Church, that, advancing continually in sincere humility
and the knowledge and sense of his own weakness and imperfections. he
strove every day to surpass himself in the fervor of his charity and
zeal, and in the exercise of all virtues. The persecution ceased in the
West, in the beginning of the year 305, but was revived a short time
after by Maxentius. St. Mark abated nothing of his watchfulness, but
endeavored rather to redouble his zeal during the peace of the Church;
knowing that if men sometimes cease openly to persecute the faithful,
the devil never allows them any truce, and his snares are generally most
to be feared in the time of the calm. St. Mark succeeded St. Sylvester
in the apostolic chair on the 18th of January, 336. He held that dignity
only eight months and twenty days, dying on the 7th of October
following. He was buried in a cemetery in the Ardeatine Way, which has
since borne his name.

**Reflection**.—A Christian ought to be afraid of no enemy more than
himself, whom he carries always about with him, and from whom he is not
able to flee. He should therefore never cease to cry out to God, "Unless
Thou, O Lord, art my light and support, I watch in vain."
