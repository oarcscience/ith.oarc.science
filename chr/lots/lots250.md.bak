### BLESSED PETER FAVRE.

BORN in 1506 of poor Savoyard shepherds, Peter, at his earnest request,
was sent to school, and in after years to the University of Paris. His
college friends were St. Ignatius of Loyola and St. Francis Xavier.
Ignatius found the young man's heart ready for his thoughts of apostolic
zeal; Peter became his first companion, and in the year of England's
revolt was ordained the first priest of the new Society of Jesus. From
that day to the close of his life he was ever in the van of the Church's
struggles

with falsehood and sin. Boldly facing heresy in Germany, he labored not
less diligently to rouse up the dormant faith and charity of Catholic
courts and Catholic lands. The odor of Blessed Peter's virtues drew
after him into religion the Duke of Gandia, Francis Borgia, and a young
student of Nimeguen, Peter Canisius, both to become Saints like their
master. The Pope, Paul III., had chosen Blessed Favre to be his
theologian at the Council of Trent, and King John III., of Portugal,
wished to send him as patriarch and apostle into Abyssinia. Sick and
worn with labor, but obedient unto death, the father hastened back to
Rome, where his last illness came upon him. He died, in his fortieth
year, as one would wish to die, in the very arms of his best friend and
spiritual father, St. Ignatius.

**Deflection**.—As the body sinks under fatigue unless supported by
food, so external works, however holy, wear rut the soul which is not
regularly nourished by prayer. In the most crowded day we can make time
briefly and secretly to lift our soul to God and draw new strength from
Him.
