### November 25.—ST. CATHERINE OF ALEXANDRIA.

CATHERINE was a noble virgin of Alexandria. Before her Baptism, it is
said, she saw in vision the Blessed Virgin ask her Son to receive her
among His servants, but the Divine Infant turned away. After Baptism,
Catherine saw the same vision, when Jesus Christ received her with great
affection, and espoused her before the court of heaven. When the impious
tyrant Maximin II. came to Alexandria, fascinated by the wisdom, beauty
and wealth of the Saint, he in vain urged his suit. At last in his rage
and disappointment he ordered her to be stripped and scourged. She fled
to the Arabian mountains, where the soldiers overtook her, and after
many torments put her to death. Her body was laid on Mount Sinai, and a
beautiful legend relates that Catherine having prayed that no man might
see or touch her body after death, angels bore it to the grave.

**Reflection**.—The constancy displayed by the Saints in their glorious
martyrdom cannot be isolated from their previous lives, but is their
natural sequence. If we wish to emulate their perseverance, let us first
imitate their fidelity to grace.
