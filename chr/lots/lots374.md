ST. SABAS, one of the most renowned patriarchs of the monks of
Palestine, was born in the year 439, near Cæsarea. In order to settle a

been ten years in this monastery, being eighteen years old, he went to
Jerusalem to visit the holy places, and attached himself to a monastery
then under control of St. Euthymius; but on the death of the holy abbot
our Saint sought the wilderness, where he chose his dwelling in a cave
on the top of a high mountain, at the bottom of which ran the brook

made Superior-General of all the anchorites of Palestine. He lived to be
ninety-four, and died on the 5th of December, 532.
