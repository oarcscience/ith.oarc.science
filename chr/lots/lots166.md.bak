### May 25.—ST. GREGORY VII.

GREGORY VII., by name Hildebrand, was born in Tuscany, about the year
1013. He was educated in Rome. From thence he went to France, and became
a monk at Cluny. Afterwards he returned to Rome, and for many years
filled high trusts of the Holy See. Three great evils then afflicted the
Church: simony, concubinage, and the custom of receiving investiture
from lay hands. Against these three corruptions Gregory never ceased to
contend. As legate of Victor II. he held a Council at Lyons, where
simony was condemned. He was elected Pope in 1073, and at once called
upon the pastors of the Catholic world to lay down their lives rather
than betray the laws of God to the will of princes. Rome was in
rebellion through the ambition of the Cenci. Gregory excommunicated
them. They laid hands on him at Christmas during the midnight Mass,
wounded him, and cast him into prison. The following day he was rescued
by the people. Next arose his conflict with Henry IV., Emperor of
Germany. This monarch, after openly relapsing into simony, pretended to
depose the Pope. Gregory excommunicated the emperor. His subjects turned
against him, and at last

he sought absolution of Gregory at Canossa. But he did not persevere. He
set up an antipope, and besieged Gregory in the castle of St. Angelo.
The aged pontiff was obliged to flee, and on May 25, 1085, about the
seventy-second year of his life and the twelfth year of his pontificate,
Gregory entered into his rest. His last words were full of a divine
wisdom and patience. As he was dying, he said, "I have loved justice and
hated iniquity, therefore I die in exile." His faithful attendant
answered, "Vicar of Christ, an exile thou canst never be, for to thee
God has given the Gentiles for an inheritance, and the uttermost ends of
the earth for thy possession."

**Reflection**.—Eight hundred years are passed since St. Gregory died,
and we see the same conflict renewed before our eyes. Let us learn from
him to suffer any persecution from the world or the state, rather than
betray the rights of the Holy See.
