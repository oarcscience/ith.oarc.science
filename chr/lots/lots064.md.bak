### February 20.—ST. EUCHERIUS, Bishop.

THIS Saint was born at Orleans, of a very illustrious family. At his
birth his parents dedicated him to God, and set him to study when he was
but seven years old, resolving to omit nothing that could be done toward
cultivating his mind or forming his heart His improvement in virtue kept
pace with his progress in learning: he meditated assiduously on the
sacred writings, especially on St. Paul's manner of speaking on the
world and its enjoyments as mere empty shadows that deceive us and
vanish away. These reflections at length sank so deep into his mind that
he resolved to quit the world. To put this design in execution, about
the year 714 he retired to the abbey of Jumiége in Normandy, where he
spent six or seven years in the practice of penitential austerities and
obedience. Suavaric, his uncle, Bishop of Orleans, having died, the
senate and people, with the clergy of that city, begged permission to
elect Eucherius to the vacant see. The Saint entreated his monks to
screen him from the

dangers that threatened him; but they preferred the public good to their
private inclinations, and resigned him for that important charge. He was
consecrated with universal applause in 721. Charles Martel, to defray
the expenses of his wars and other undertakings, often stripped the
churches of their revenues. St. Eucherius reproved these encroachments
with so much zeal that, in the year 737, Charles banished him to
Cologne. The extraordinary esteem which his virtue procured him in that
city moved Charles to order him to be conveyed thence to a strong place
in the territory of Liege. Robert, the governor of that country, was so
charmed with his virtue that he made him the distributor of his large
alms, and allowed him to retire to the monastery of Sarchinium, or St.
Tron's. Here prayer and contemplation were his whole employment till the
year 743, in which he died, on the 20th of February.

**Reflection**.—Nothing softens the soul and weakens piety so much as
frivolous indulgence. God has revealed what high store He sets by
"retirement" in these words: "I will lead her into solitude, and I will
speak to her heart."
