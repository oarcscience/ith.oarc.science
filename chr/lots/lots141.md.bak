### April 30.—ST. CATHERINE OF SIENA.

CATHERINE, the daughter of a humble tradesman, was raised up to be the
guide and guardian of the Church in one of the darkest periods of its
history, the fourteenth century. As a child, prayer was her delight. She
would say the "Hail Mary" on each step as she mounted the stairs, and
was granted in reward a vision of Christ in glory. When but seven years
old, she made a vow of virginity, and afterwards endured bitter
persecution for refusing to marry. Our Lord gave her His Heart in
exchange for her own, communicated her with His own hands, and stamped
on her body the print of His wounds. At the age of fifteen she entered
the Third Order of St. Dominic, but continued to reside in her father's
shop, where she united a life of active charity with the prayer of a
contemplative Saint. From this obscure home the seraphic virgin was
summoned to defend the Church's cause. Armed with Papal authority, and
accompanied by three confessors, she travelled through Italy, reducing
rebellious cities to the obedience of the Holy See, and winning hardened
souls to God. In the face well-nigh of the whole world she sought out
Gregory XI. at Avignon, brought him back to Rome, and by her letters to
the kings and queens of Europe made good the Papal cause. She was the
counsellor of Urban VI., and sternly rebuked the disloyal cardinals who
had part in electing an antipope. Long had the holy virgin foretold the
terrible schism which

began ere she died. Day and night she wept and prayed for unity and
peace. But the devil excited the Roman people against the Pope, so that
some sought the life cf Christ's Vicar. With intense earnestness did St.
Catherine beg Our Lord to prevent this enormous crime. In spirit she saw
the whole city full of demons tempting the people to resist and even
slay the Pope. The seditious temper was subdued by Catherine's prayers;
but the devils vented their malice by scourging the Saint herself, who
gladly endured all for God and His Church. She died at Rome, in 1380, at
the age of thirty-three.

**Reflection**.—The seraphic St. Catherine willingly sacrificed the
delights of contemplation to labor for the Church and the Apostolic See.
How deeply do the troubles of the Church and the consequent loss of
souls afflict us? How often do we pray for the Church and the Pope?
