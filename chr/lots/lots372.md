### December 3.—ST. FRANCIS XAVIER.

YOUNG Spanish gentleman, in the dangerous days of the Reformation, was
making a name for himself as a Professor of Philosophy in the University
of Paris, and had seemingly no higher aim, when St. Ignatius of Loyola
won him to heavenly thoughts. After a brief apostolate amongst his
countrymen in Rome he was sent by St. Ignatius to the Indies, where for
twelve years he was to wear himself out, bearing the Gospel to
Hindostan, to Malacca, and to Japan. Thwarted by the jealousy,
covetousness, and carelessness of those who should have helped and
encouraged him, neither their opposition nor the difficulties of every
sort which he encountered could make him slacken his labors for souls.
The vast kingdom of China appealed to his charity, and he was resolved
to risk his life to force an entry, when God took him to Himself, and on
the 2d of December, 1552, he died, like Moses, in sight of the land of
promise.

**Reflection**.—Some are specially called to work for souls; but there
is no one who cannot help much in their salvation. Holy example, earnest
intercession, the offerings of our actions in their behalf—all this
needs only the spirit which animated St. Francis Xavier, the desire to
make some return to God.
