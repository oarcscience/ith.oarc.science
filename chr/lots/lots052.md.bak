### February 9.—ST. APOLLONIA AND THE MARTYRS OF ALEXANDRIA.

AT Alexandria, in 249, the mob rose in savage fury against the
Christians. Metras, an old man, perished first. His eyes were pierced
with reeds, and he was stoned to death. A woman named Quinta was the
next victim. She was led to a heathen temple and bidden worship. She
replied by cursing the false god again and again, and she too was stoned
to death. After this the houses of the Christians were sacked and
plundered. They took the spoiling of their goods with all joy.

St. Apollonia, an aged virgin, was the most famous among the martyrs.
Her teeth were beaten out; she was led outside the city, a huge fire was
kindled, and she was told she must deny Christ, or else be burned alive.

was silent for a while, and then, moved by a special inspiration of the
Holy Ghost, she leaped into the fire and died in its flames. The same
courage showed itself the next year, when Decius became emperor, and the
persecution grew till it seemed as if the very elect must fall away. The
story of Dioscorus illustrates the courage of the Alexandrian
Christians, and the esteem they had for martyrdom. He was a boy of
fifteen. To the arguments of the judge he returned wise answers: he was
proof against torture. His older companions were executed, but Dioscorus
was spared on account of his tender years; yet the Christians could not
bear to think that he had been deprived of the martyr's crown, except to
receive it afterwards more gloriously. "Dioscorus," writes Dionysius,
Bishop of Alexandria at this time, "remains with us, reserved for some
longer and greater combat." There were indeed many Christians who came,
pale and trembling, to offer the heathen sacrifices. But the judges
themselves were struck with horror at the multitudes who rushed to
martyrdom. Women triumphed over torture, till at last the judges were
glad to execute them at once and put an end to the ignominy of their own
defeat.

**Reflection**.—Many saints, who were not martyrs, have longed to shed
their blood for Christ. We, too, may pray for some portion of their
spirit; and the least suffering for the faith, borne with humility and
courage, is the proof that Christ has heard our prayer.
