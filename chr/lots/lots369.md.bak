### November 30.—ST. ANDREW, Apostle.

ST. ANDREW was one of the fishermen of Bethsaida, and brother, perhaps
elder brother, of St. Peter, and became a disciple of St. John Baptist.
He seemed always eager to bring others into notice; when called himself
by Christ on the banks of the Jordan, his first thought was to go in
search of his brother, and he said, "We have found the Messias," and he
brought him to Jesus. It was he again who, when Christ wished to feed
the five thousand in the desert, pointed out the little lad with the
five loaves and fishes. St. Andrew went forth upon his mission to plant
the Faith in Scythia and Greece, and at the end of years of toil to win
a martyr's crown. After suffering a cruel scourging at Patræ in Achaia,
he was left, bound by cords, to die upon a cross. When St. Andrew first
caught sight of the gibbet on which he was to die, he greeted the
precious wood with joy. "O good cross! " he cried, "made beautiful by
the limbs of Christ, so long desired, now so happily found! Receive me
into thy arms and present me to my Master, that He Who redeemed me
through thee may now accept me from thee." Two whole days the martyr
remained hanging on this cross alive, preaching, with outstretched arms
from this chair of truth, to all who came near, and entreating them not
to hinder his passion.

**Reflection**.—If we would do good to others, we must, like St. Andrew,
keep close to the cross.
