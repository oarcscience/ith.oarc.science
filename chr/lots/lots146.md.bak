### May 5.—ST. PIUS V.

A DOMINICAN friar from his fifteenth year, Michael Ghislieri, as a
simple religious, as inquisitor, as bishop, and as cardinal, was famous
for his intrepid defence of the Church's faith and discipline, and for
the spotless purity of his own life. His first care as Pope was to
reform

the Roman court and capital by the strict example of his household and
the severe punishment of all offenders. He next endeavored to obtain
from the Catholic powers the recognition of the Tridentine decrees, two
of which he urgently enforced—the residence of bishops, and the
establishment of diocesan seminaries. He revised the Missal and
Breviary, and reformed the ecclesiastical music. Nor was he less active
in protecting the Church without. We see him at the same time supporting
the Catholic King of France against the Huguenot rebels, encouraging
Mary Queen of Scots, in the bitterness of her captivity, and
excommunicating her rival the usurper Elizabeth, when the best blood of
England had flowed upon the scaffold, and the measure of her crimes was
full. But it was at Lepanto that the Saint's power was most manifest;
there, in October, 1571, by the holy league which he had formed, but
still more by his prayers to the great Mother of God, the aged Pontiff
crushed the Ottoman forces, and saved Christendom from the Turk. Six
months later, St. Pius died, having reigned but six years. St. Pius was
accustomed to kiss the feet of his crucifix on leaving or entering his
room. One day the feet moved away from his lips. Sorrow filled his
heart, and he made acts of contrition, fearing that he must have
committed some secret offence, but still he could not kiss the feet. It
was afterwards found that they had been poisoned by an enemy.

**Reflection**.—"Thy cross, O Lord, is the source of all blessings, the
cause of all graces: by it the faithful find strength in weakness, glory
in shame, life in death."—St. Leo.
