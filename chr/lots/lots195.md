### June 18.—STS. MARCUS and MARCELLIANUS, Martyrs.

MARCUS AND MARCELLIANUS were twin brothers of an illustrious family in
Rome, who had been converted to the Faith in their youth and were
honorably married. Diocletian ascending the imperial throne in 284, the
heathens raised persecutions. These martyrs were thrown into prison, and
condemned to be beheaded. Their friends obtained a respite of the
execution for thirty days, that they might prevail on them to worship
the false gods, Tranquillinus and Martia, their afflicted heathen
parents, in company with their sons’ own wives and their little babes,
endeavored to move them by the most tender entreaties and tears. St.
Sebastian, an officer of the emperor's household, coming to Rome soon
after their commitment, daily visited and encouraged them. The issue of
the conferences was the happy conversion of the father, mother, and
wives, also of Nicostratus, the public register, and soon after of
Chromatius, the judge, who set the Saints at liberty, and, abdicating
the magistracy, retired into the country. Marcus and Marcellianus were
hid by a Christian officer of the household in his apartments in the
palace; but they were betrayed by an apostate, and retaken. Fabian, who
had succeeded Chromatius, condemned them to be bound to two pillars,
with their feet nailed to the same. In this posture they remained a day
and a night, and on the following day were stabbed with lances.

**Reflection**.—We know not what we are till we have been tried. It
costs nothing to say we love God above all things, and to show the
courage of martyrs at a distance from the danger; but that love is
sincere which has stood the proof. "Persecution shows who is a hireling,
and who a true pastor," says St. Bernard.
