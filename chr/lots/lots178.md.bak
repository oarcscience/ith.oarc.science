### June 3.—ST. CLOTILDA, Queen.

ST. CLOTILDA was daughter of Chilperic, younger brother to Gondebald,
the tyrannical King of Burgundy, who put him and his wife, and his other
brothers, except one, to death, in order to usurp their dominions.
Clotilda was brought up in her uncle's court, and, by a singular
providence, was instructed in the Catholic religion, though she was
educated in the midst of Arians. Her wit, beauty, meekness, modesty, and
piety made her the adoration of all the neighboring kingdoms, and Clovis
I., surnamed the Great, the victorious king of the Franks, demanded and
obtained her in marriage. She honored her royal husband, studied to
sweeten his warlike temper by Christian meekness, conformed herself to
his humor in things that were indifferent, and, the better to gain his
affections, made those things the subject of her discourse and praises
in which she knew him to take the greatest delight. When she saw herself
mistress of his heart she did

not defer the great work of endeavoring to win him to God, but the fear
of giving offence to his people made him delay his conversion. His
miraculous victory over the Alemanni, and his entire conversion in 496,
were at length the fruit of our Saint's prayers. Clotilda, having gained
to God this great monarch, never ceased to excite him to glorious
actions for the divine honor; among other religious foundations, he
built in Paris, at her request, about the year 511, the great church of
Sts. Peter and Paul, now called St. Genevieve's. This great prince died
on the 27th of November, in the year 511, at the age of forty-five,
having reigned thirty years. His eldest son, Theodoric, reigned at
Rheims over the eastern parts of France, Clodomir reigned at Orleans,
Childebert at Paris, and Clotaire I. at Soissons. This division produced
wars and mutual jealousies, till in 560 the whole monarchy was reunited
under Clotaire, the youngest of these brothers. The dissension in her
family contributed more perfectly to wean Clotilda's heart from the
world. She spent the remaining part of her life in exercises of prayer,
almsdeeds, watching, fasting, and penance, seeming totally to forget
that she had been queen or that her sons sat on the throne. Eternity
filled her heart and employed all her thoughts. She foretold her death
thirty days before it happened. On the thirtieth day of her illness, she
received the sacraments, made a public confession of her faith, and
departed to the Lord on the 3d of June, in 545.

**Reflection**.—St. Peter defines the mission of the Christian woman; to
win the heart of those who believe not the word.
