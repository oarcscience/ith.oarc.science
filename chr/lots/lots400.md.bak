### December 31.—ST. SYLVESTER, Pope.

SYLVESTER was born in Rome toward the close of the third century. He was
a young priest when the persecution of the Christians broke out under
the tyrant Diocletian. Idols were erected at the corners of the streets,
in the market-places, and over the public fountains, so that it was
scarcely possible for a Christian to go abroad without being put to the
test of offering sacrifice, with the alternative of apostasy or death.
During this fiery trial, Sylvester strengthened the confessors and
martyrs, God preserving his life from many dangers. In 312 a new era set
in. Constantine, having triumphed under the " standard of the Cross,"
declared himself the protector of the Christians, and built them
splendid churches. At this juncture Sylvester was elected to the chair
of Peter, and was thus the first of the Roman Pontiffs to rule the flock
of Christ in security and peace. He profited by these blessings to renew
the discipline of the Church, and in two great Councils confirmed her
sacred truths. In the Council of Arles he condemned the schism of the
Donatists; and in that of Nicæa, the first general Council of the
Church, he dealt Arianism its death-blow by declaring that Jesus Christ
is the true and very God. Sylvester died A. D. 335.
