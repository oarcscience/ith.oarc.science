### April 20.—ST. MARCELLINUS, Bishop.

ST. MARCELLINUS was born in Africa, of a noble family; accompanied by
Vincent and Domninus, he went over into Gaul, and there preached the
Gospel, with great success, in the neighborhood of the Alps. He
afterwards settled at Embrun, where he built a chapel in which he passed
his nights in prayer, after laboring all the day in the exercise of his
sacred calling. By his pious example as well as by his earnest words, he
converted many of the heathens among whom he lived. He was afterwards
made bishop of the people whom he had won over to Christ, but the date
of his consecration is not positively known. Burning with zeal for the
glory of God, he sent Vincent and Domninus to preach the faith in those
parts which he could not visit in person. He died at Embrun about the
year 374, and was there interred. St. Gregory of Tours, who speaks of
Marcellinus in terms of highest praise, mentions many miracles as
happening at his tomb.

**Reflection**.—Though you may not be called upon to preach, at least
endeavor to set a good example, remembering that deeds often speak
louder than words.
