### November 2.—ALL-SOULS.

THE Church teaches us that the souls of the just who have left this
world soiled with the stain of venial sin remain for a time in a place
of expiation, where they suffer such punishment as may be due to their
offences. It

is a matter of faith that these suffering souls are relieved by the
intercession of the Saints in heaven and by the prayers of the faithful
upon earth. To pray for the dead is, then, both an act of charity and of
piety. We read in Holy Scripture: "It is a holy and wholesome thought to
pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins." And when Our Lord
inspired St. Odilo, Abbot of Cluny, towards the close of the tenth
century, to establish in his Order a general commemoration of all the
faithful departed, it was soon adopted by the whole Western Church, and
has been continued unceasingly to our day. Let us, then, ever bear in
mind the dead and offer up our prayers for them. By showing this mercy
to the suffering souls in purgatory, we shall be particularly entitled
to be treated with mercy at our departure from this world, and to share
more abundantly in the general suffrages of the Church, continually
offered for all who have slept in Christ.
