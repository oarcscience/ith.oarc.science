### October 27.—ST. FRUMENTIUS, Bishop.

ST. FRUMENTIUS was yet a child when his uncle, Meropins of Tyre, took
him and his brother Edesius on a voyage to Ethiopia. In the course of
their voyage the vessel touched at a certain port, and the barbarians of
that country put the crew and all the passengers to the sword, except
the two children. They were carried to the king, at Axuma, who, charmed
with the wit and sprightliness of the two boys, took special care of
their education; and, not long after made Edesius his cup-bearer, and
Frumentius, who was the elder, his treasurer and secretary of state; on
his death-bed he thanked them for their services, and in recompense gave
them their liberty. After his death the queen begged them to remain a
court, and assist her in the government of the state until the young
king carne of age. Edesius went back to Tyre, but St. Athanasius
ordained Frumentius Bishop of the Ethiopians, and vested with this
sacred character he gained great numbers to the Faith, and continued to
feed and defend his flock until it pleased the Supreme Pastor to
recompense his fidelity and labors.

**Reflection**.—"The soul that journeys in the light and the truths of
the Faith is safe against all error."
