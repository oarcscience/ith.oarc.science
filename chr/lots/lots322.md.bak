### October 16.—ST. GALL, Abbot.

ST. GALL was born in Ireland soon after the middle of the sixth century,
of pious, noble, and rich parents. When St. Columban left Ireland, St.
Gall accompanied him into England, and afterward into France, where they

arrived in 585. St. Columban founded the monastery of Anegray, in a wild
forest in the diocese of Besançon, and two years afterward another in
Luxeuil. Being driven thence by King Theodoric, the Saints both withdrew
into the territories of Theodebert. St. Columban, however, retired into
Italy, but St. Gall was prevented from bearing him company by a grievous
fit of illness. St. Gall was a priest before he left Ireland, and having
learned the language of the country where he settled, near the Lake of
Constance, he converted to the faith a great number of idolaters. The
cells which this Saint built there for those who desired to serve God
with him, he gave to the monastery which bears his name. A synod of
bishops, with the clergy and people, earnestly desired to place the
Saint in the episcopal see of Constance; but his modesty refused the
dignity. He died in the year 646.

**Reflection**.—"If any one would be My disciple," says Our Saviour,
"let him deny himself." The denial of self is, then, the royal road to
perfection.
