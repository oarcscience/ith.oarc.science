### March 5.—STS. ADRIAN and EUBULUS, Martyrs.

IN the seventh year of Diocletian's persecution, continued by Galerius
Maximianus, when Firmilian, the most bloody governor of Palestine, had
stained Cæsarea with the blood of many illustrious martyrs, Adrian and
Eubulus came out of the country called Magantia to Cæsarea, in order to
visit the holy confessors there. At the gates of the city they were
asked, as others were, whither they were going, and upon what errand.
They ingenuously confessed the truth, and were brought before the
president, who ordered them to be tortured and their sides to be torn
with iron hooks, and then condemned them to be exposed to wild beasts.
Two days after, when the pagans at Cæsarea celebrated the festival of
the public Genius, Adrian was exposed to a lion, and not being
despatched by that beast, but only mangled, was at length killed by the
sword. Eubulus was treated in the same manner two days later. The judge
offered him his liberty if he would sacrifice to idols; but the Saint
preferred a glorious death, and was the last that suffered in this
persecution at Cæsarea, which had now continued twelve years, under
three successive governors, Flavian, Urban, and Firmilian. Divine
vengeance pursuing the cruel Firmilian, he was that same year beheaded
for his crimes, by the emperor's order, as his predecessor Urban had
been two years before.

**Reflection**.—It is in vain that we take the name of Christians, or
pretend to follow Christ, unless we carry our crosses after Him. It is
in vain that we hope to share in His glory, and in His kingdom, if we
accept not the condition. We cannot arrive at heaven by any other road
but that which Christ held, Who bequeathed His cross to all His elect as
their portion and inheritance in this world.
