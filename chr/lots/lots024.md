### January 14.—ST. HILARY OF POITIERS.

ST. HILARY was a native of Poitiers in Aquitaine. Born and educated a
pagan, it was not till near middle age that he embraced Christianity,
moved thereto mainly by the idea of God presented to him in the Holy
Scriptures. He soon converted his wife and daughter, and separated
himself rigidly from all un-Catholic company. In the beginning of his
conversion St. Hilary would not eat with Jews or heretics, nor salute
them by the way; but afterwards, for their sake, he relaxed this
severity. He entered Holy Orders, and in 353 was chosen bishop of his
native city. Arianism, under the protection of the Emperor Constantius,
was just then in the height of its power, and St. Hilary found himself
called upon to support the orthodox cause in several Gallic councils, in
which Arian bishops formed an overwhelming majority. He was in
consequence accused to the emperor, who banished him to Phrygia. He
spent his three years and more of exile in composing his great works on
the Trinity. In 359 he attended the Council of Seleucia, in which
Arians, semi-Arians, and Catholics contended for the mastery. With the
deputies of the council he proceeded to Constantinople, and there so
dismayed the heads of the Arian party that they prevailed upon the
emperor to let him return to Gaul. He traversed Gaul, Italy, and
Illyria, wherever he came discomfiting the heretics and procuring
triumph of orthodoxy. After seven or eight years of missionary travel he
returned to Poitiers, where he died in peace in 368.

**Reflection**.—Like St. Hilary, we, too, are called to a lifelong
contest with heretics; we shall succeed in proportion as we combine
hatred of heresy, with compassion for its victims.
