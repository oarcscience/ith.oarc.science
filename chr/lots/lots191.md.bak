### June 14.—ST. BASIL THE GREAT.

ST. BASIL was born in Asia Minor. Two of his brothers became bishops,
and, together with his mother and sister, are honored as Saints. He
studied with great success at Athens, where he formed with St. Gregory
Nazianzen the most tender friendship. He then taught oratory; but
dreading the honors of the world, he gave up all, and became the father
of the monastic life in the East. The Arian heretics, supported by the
court, were then persecuting the Church; and Basil was summoned from his
retirement by his bishop to give aid against them. His energy and zeal
soon mitigated the disorders of the Church, and his solid and eloquent
words silenced the heretics. On the death of Eusebius, he was chosen
Bishop of Cæsarea. His commanding character, his firmness and energy,
his learning and eloquence, and not less his humility and the exceeding
austerity of his life, made him a model for bishops. When St. Basil was
required to admit the Arians to Communion, the prefect, finding that
soft words had no effect, said to him, "Are you mad, that you resist the
will before which the whole world bows? Do you not dread the wrath of
the emperor, nor exile, nor death?" "No," said Basil calmly; "he who has
nothing to lose need not dread loss of goods; you cannot exile me, for
the whole earth is my home; as for death, it would be the greatest
kindness you could bestow upon me; torments cannot harm me: one blow
would end my frail life and my sufferings together." "Never," said the
prefect, "has any one

dared to address me thus." "Perhaps," suggested Basil, "you never before
measured your strength with a Christian bishop." The emperor desisted
from his commands. St. Basil's whole life was one of suffering. He lived
amid jealousies and misunderstandings and seeming disappointments. But
he sowed the seed which bore goodly fruit in the next generation, and
was God's instrument in beating back the Arian and other heretics in the
East, and restoring the spirit of discipline and fervor in the Church.
He died in 379, and is venerated as a Doctor of the Church.

**Reflection**.—"Fear God," says the Imitation of Christ, "and thou
shalt have no need of being afraid of any man."
