### July 18.—ST. CAMILLUS OF LELLIS.

THE early years of Camillus gave no sign of sanctity. At the age of
nineteen he took service with his father, an Italian noble, against the
Turks, and after four years’ hard campaigning found himself, through his
violent temper, reckless habits, and inveterate passion for gambling, a
discharged soldier, and in such straitened circumstances that he was
obliged to work as a laborer on a Capuchin convent which was then
building. A few words from a Capuchin friar brought about his
conversion, and he resolved to become a religious. Thrice he entered the
Capuchin novitiate, but each time an obstinate wound in his leg forced
him to leave. He repaired to Rome for medical treatment, and there took
St. Philip as his confessor,

and entered the hospital of St. Giacomo, of which he became in time the
superintendent. The carelessness of the paid chaplains and nurses
towards the suffering patients now inspired him with the thought of
founding a congregation to minister to their wants. With this end he was
ordained priest, and in 1586 his community of the Servants of the Sick
was confirmed by the Pope. Its usefulness was soon felt, not only in
hospitals, but in private houses. Summoned at every hour of the day and
night, the devotion of Camillus never grew cold. With a woman's
tenderness he attended to the needs of his patients. He wept with them,
consoled them, and prayed with them. He knew miraculously the state of
their souls; and St. Philip saw angels whispering to two Servants of the
Sick who were consoling a dying person. One day a sick man said to the
Saint, "Father, may I beg you to make up my bed? it is very hard."
Camillus replied, "God forgive you, brother! You beg me! Don't you know
yet that you are to command me, for I am your servant and slave." "Would
to God," he would cry, "that in the hour of my death one sigh or one
blessing of these poor creatures might fall upon me!" His prayer was
heard. He was granted the same consolations in his last hour which he
had so often procured for others. In the year 1614 he died with the full
use of his faculties, after two weeks' saintly preparation, as the
priest was reciting the words of the ritual, "May Jesus Christ appear to
thee with a mild and joyful countenance!"

**Reflection**.—St. Camillus venerated the sick as living images of
Christ, and by ministering to them in this spirit did penance for the
sins of his youth, led a life precious in merit, and from a violent and
quarrelsome soldier became a gentle and tender Saint.
