### November 4.—ST. CHARLES BORROMEO.

ABOUT fifty years after the Protestant heresy had broken out, Our Lord
raised up a mere youth to renew the face of His Church. In 1560 Charles
Borromeo, then twenty-two years of age, was created cardinal, and by

the side of his uncle, Pius IV., administered the affairs of the Holy
See. His first care was the direction of the Council of Trent. He urged
forward its sessions, guided its deliberations by continual
correspondence from Rome, and by his firmness carried it to its
conclusion. Then he entered upon a still more arduous work—the execution
of its decrees. As Archbishop of Milan he enforced their observance, and
thoroughly restored the discipline of his see. He founded schools for
the poor, seminaries for the clerics, and by his community of Oblates
trained his priests to perfection. Inflexible in maintaining discipline,
to his flock he was a most tender father. He would sit by the roadside
to teach a poor man the Pater and Ave, and would enter hovels the stench
of which drove his attendants from the door. During the great plague he
refused to leave Milan, and was ever by the sick and dying, and sold
even his bed for their support. So he lived and so he died, a faithful
image of the Good Shepherd, up to his last hour giving his life for his
sheep.

**Reflection**.—Daily resolutions to fulfil, at all cost, every duty
demanded by God, is the lesson taught by St. Charles; and a lesson we
must learn if we would overcome our corrupt nature and reform our lives.
