### November 12.—ST. MARTIN, Pope.

ST. MARTIN, who occupied the Roman See from A. D. 649 to 655, incurred
the enmity of the Byzantine court by his energetic opposition to the
Monothelite heresy, and the Exarch Olympius went so far as to endeavor
to procure the assassination of the Pope as he stood at the altar in the
Church of St. Mary Major; but the would-be murderer was miraculously
struck blind, and his master refused to have any further hand in the
matter. His successor had no such scruples: he seized Martin, and
conveyed him on board a vessel bound for Constantinople. After a three
months' voyage the island of Naxos was reached, where the Pope was kept
in confinement for a year, and finally in 654 brought in chains to the
imperial city. He was then banished to the Tannic Chersonese, where he
lingered on for four months, in sickness and starvation, till God
released him by death on the 12th of November, 655.

**Reflection**.—There have been times in the history of Christianity
when its truths have seemed on the verge of extinction. But there is one
Church whose testimony has never failed: it is the Church of St. Peter,
the Apostolic and Roman See. Put your whole trust in her teaching!'
