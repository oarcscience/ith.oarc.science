### THE FESTIVAL, ON THE SUNDAY WITHIN THE OCTAVE OF HER NATIVITY, OF THE HOLY NAME OF MARY.

THIS festival was appointed by Pope Innocent XI., that on it the
faithful may be called upon in a particular manner to recommend to God,
through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin, the necessities of His
Church, and to return Him thanks for His gracious protection and
numberless mercies. What gave occasion to the institution of this feast
was a solemn thanksgiving for the relief of Vienna when it was besieged
by the Turks in 1683. If we desire to deprecate the divine anger, justly
provoked by our sins, with our prayers, we must join the tears of
sincere compunction

with a perfect conversion of our manners. The first grace we should
always beg of God is that He will bring us to the disposition of condign
penance. Our supplications for the divine mercies, and our thanksgivings
for benefits received, will only thus be rendered acceptable. By no
other means can we deserve the blessing of God, or be recommended to it
by the patronage of His holy mother. To the invocation of Jesus it is a
pious and wholesome practice to join our application to the Blessed
Virgin, that, through her intercession, we may more easily and more
abundantly obtain the effects of our petitions. In this sense devout
souls pronounce, with great affection and confidence, the holy names of
Jesus and Mary.
