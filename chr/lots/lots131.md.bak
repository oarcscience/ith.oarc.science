### ST. LEONIDES, Martyr.

THE Emperor Severus, in the year 202, which was the tenth of his reign,
raised a bloody persecution, which filled the whole empire with martyrs,
but especially Egypt. The most illustrious of those who by their
triumphs ennobled and edified the city of Alexandria was Leonides,
father of the great Origen. He was a Christian philosopher, and
excellently versed both in the profane and sacred sciences. He had seven
sons, the eldest of whom was Origen, whom he brought up with abundance
of care, returning God thanks for having blessed him with a son of such
an excellent disposition for learning, and a very great zeal for piety.
These qualifications endeared him greatly to his father, who, after his
son was baptized, would come to his bedside while he was asleep, and,
opening his bosom, kiss it respectfully, as being the temple of the Holy
Ghost. When the persecution raged at Alexandria, under Lætus, governor
of Egypt, in the tenth year of Severus, Leonides was cast into prison.
Origen, who was then only seventeen years of age, burned with an
incredible desire of martyrdom, and sought every opportunity of meeting
with it. But his mother conjured him not to forsake her, and his ardor
being redoubled at the sight of his father's chains, she was forced to
lock up all his clothes to oblige him to stay at home. So, not being
able to do any more, he wrote a letter to his father in very moving
terms, strongly exhorting him to look on the crown that was offered him
with courage and joy, adding this clause, "Take heed, sir. that for our
sakes you do not change your mind." Leonides was accordingly beheaded
for the faith in 202. His estates and goods being all confiscated, and
seized for the emperor's use, his widow was left with seven children to
maintain in the poorest condition imaginable; but Divine Providence was
both her comfort and support.
