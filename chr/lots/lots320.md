### October 14.—ST. CALLISTUS, Pope, Martyr.

EARLY in the third century, Callistus, then a deacon, was intrusted by
Pope St. Zephyrinus with the rule of the clergy, and set by him over the
cemeteries of the Christians at Rome; and, at the death of Zephyrinus,
Callistus, according to the Roman usage, succeeded to the Apostolic See.
A decree is ascribed to him appointing the four fasts of the Ember
seasons, but his name is best known in connection with the old cemetery
on the Appian Way, which was enlarged and adorned by him, and is called
to this day the Catacomb of St. Callistus. During the persecution under
the Emperor Severus, St. Callistus was driven to take shelter in the
poor and populous quarters of the city; yet, in spite of these troubles,
and of the care of the Church, he made diligent search for the body of
Calipodius, one of his clergy who had suffered martyrdom shortly before,
by being cast into the Tiber. When he found it he was full of joy, and
buried it, with hymns of praise. Callistus was martyred October 14, 223.

**Reflection**.—In the body of a Christian we see that which has been
the temple of the Holy Ghost, which even now is precious in the eyes of
God, Who will watch over it, and one day raise it up in glory to shine
forever in His kingdom. Let our actions bear witness to our belief in
these truths.
