### March 6.—ST. COLETTE, Virgin.

AFTER a holy childhood, Colette joined a society of devout women called
the Beguines; but not finding their state sufficiently austere, she
entered the Third Order of St. Francis, and lived in a hut near her
parish church of Corbie in Picardy. Here she had passed four years of
extraordinary penance when St. Francis, in a vision, bade her undertake
the reform of her Order, then much relaxed. Armed with due authority,
she established her reform throughout a large part of Europe, and, in
spite of the most violent opposition, founded seventeen convents of the
strict observance. By the same wonderful prudence she assisted in
healing the great schism which then afflicted. the Church. The Fathers
in council at Constance were in doubt how to deal with the three
claimants to the tiara—John XXIII., Benedict XIII., and Gregory XII. At
this crisis Colette, together with St. Vincent Ferrer, wrote to the
Fathers to depose Benedict XIII., who alone refused his consent to a new
election. This was done, and Martin V. was elected, to the great good of
the Church. Colette equally assisted the Council of Basle by her advice
and prayers; and when, later, God revealed to her the spirit ' of revolt
that was rising, she warned the bishops and legates to retire from the
council. St. Colette never ceased to pray for the Church, while the
devils, in turn, never ceased to assault her. They swarmed round her as
hideous insects, buzzing and stinging her tender skin. They brought into
her cell the decaying corpses of public criminals, and assuming
themselves monstrous forms struck her savage blows; or they would appear
in the most seductive guise, and tempt her by many deceits to sin. St.
Colette once complained to Our Lord that the demons prevented her from
praying. "Cease, then," said the devil to her, "your prayers to the
great Master of the Church, and we will cease to torment you; for you
torment us more by your prayers than we do you." Yet the virgin of
Christ triumphed alike over their threats and their allurements, and
said she would count that day the unhappiest of her life in which she
suffered nothing for her God. She died

a transport of intercession for sinners and the Church.

**Reflection**.—One of the greatest tests of being a good Catholic is
zeal for the Church and, devotion to Christ's Vicar.
