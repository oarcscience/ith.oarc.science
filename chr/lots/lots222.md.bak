### July 14.—ST. BONAVENTURE.

SANCTITY and learning raised Bonaventure to the Church's highest honors,
and from a child he was the companion of Saints. Yet at heart he was
ever the poor Franciscan friar, and practised and taught humility and
mortification. St. Francis gave him his name; for, having miraculously
cured him of a mortal sickness, he prophetically exclaimed of the child,
"O bona ventura!"—good luck. He is known also as the "Seraphic Doctor,"
from the fervor of divine love which breathes in his writings. He was
the friend of St. Thomas Aquinas, who asked him one day whence he drew
his great learning. He replied by pointing to his crucifix. At another
time St. Thomas found him in ecstasy while writing the life of St.
Francis, and exclaimed, "Let us leave a Saint to write of a Saint." They
received the Doctor's cap together. He was the guest and adviser of St.
Louis, and the director of St. Isabella, the king's sister. At the age
of thirty-five he was made general of his Order; and only escaped
another dignity, the Archbishopric of York, by dint of tears and
entreaties. Gregory X. appointed him Cardinal Bishop of Albano. When the
Saint heard of the Pope's resolve to create him a Cardinal, he quietly
made his escape from Italy. But Gregory sent him a summons to return to
Rome. On his way, he stopped to rest himself at a convent of his Order
near Florence; and there two Papal

messengers, sent to meet him with the Cardinal's hat, found him washing
the dishes. The Saint desired them to hang the hat on a bush that was
near, and take a walk in the garden until he had finished what he was
about. Then taking up the hat with unfeigned sorrow, he joined the
messengers, and paid them the respect due to their character. He sat at
the Pontiff's right hand, and spoke first at the Council of Lyons. His
piety and eloquence won over the Greeks to Catholic union, and then his
strength failed. He died while the Council was sitting, and was buried
by the assembled bishops, A. D. 1274.

**Reflection**.—"The fear of God," says St. Bonaventure, "forbids a man
to give his heart to transitory things, which are the true seeds of
sin."
