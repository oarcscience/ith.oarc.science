### September 13.—ST. EULOGIUS, Patriarch of Alexandria.

ST. EULOGIUS was a Syrian by birth, and while young embraced the
monastic state in that country. The Eutychian heresy had thrown the
Churches of Syria and Egypt into much confusion, and a great part of the
monks of Syria were at that time become remarkable for their loose
morals and errors against faith. Eulogius learned from the fall of
others to stand more watchfully and firmly upon his guard, and was not
less distinguished by the innocence and sanctity of his manners than by
the purity of his doctrine. Having, by an enlarged pursuit of learning,
attained to a great variety of useful knowledge in the different
branches of literature, he set himself to the study of divinity in the
sacred sources of that science, which are the Holy Scriptures, the
tradition of the Church as explained in its councils, and the approved
writings of its eminent pastors. In the great dangers and necessities cf
the Church he was drawn out of his solitude, and made priest of Antioch
by the patriarch St. Anastasius. Upon the death of John, the Patriarch
of Alexandria, St. Eulogius was raised to that patriarchal dignity
toward the close of the year 583. About two years after his promotion
our Saint was obliged to make a journey to Constantinople, in order to
concert measures concerning certain affairs of his Church. He met at
court St. Gregory the Great, and contracted with him a holy friendship,
so that from that time they seemed to be one heart and one soul. Among
the letters of St. Gregory we have several extant which he wrote to our
Saint. St. Eulogius composed many excellent works against different
heresies, and died in the year 606.

**Reflection**.—We admire the great actions and the glorious triumph of
the Saints; yet it is not so much in these that their sanctity
consisted, as in the constant, habitual heroic disposition of their
souls. There is no one who does not sometimes do good actions; but he
can never be called virtuous who does well only by humor, or by fits and
starts, not by steady habits.
