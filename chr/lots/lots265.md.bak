### August 23.—ST. PHILIP BENIZI.

ST. PHILIP BENIZI was born in Florence, on the Feast of the Assumption,
1233. That same day the Order of Servites was founded by the Mother of
God. As an infant at the breast, Philip broke out into speech at the
sight of these new religious, and begged his mother to give them alms.
Amidst all the temptations of his youth, he longed to become himself a
servant of Mary, and it was only the fear of his own unworthiness which
made him yield to his father's wish and begin to practise medicine.
Alter long and weary waiting, his doubts were solved by Our Lady
herself, who in a vision bade him enter her Order. Still Philip dared
only offer himself as a lay brother, and in this humble state he strove
to do penance for his sins. In spite of his reluctance, he was promoted
to the post of master of novices; and as his rare abilities were daily
discovered, he was bidden to prepare for the priesthood. Thenceforth
honors were heaped upon him; he became general of the Order, and only
escaped by flight elevation to the Papal throne. His preaching restored
peace to Italy, which was wasted by civil wars; and at the Council of
Lyons, he spoke to the assembled prelates with the gift of tongues. Amid
all these favors Philip lived in extreme penitence, constantly examining
his soul before the judgment-seat of God, and condemning himself as only
fit for hell. St. Philip, though he was free from the stain of mortal
sin, was never weary of beseeching God's mercy. From the time he was ten
years old he said daily the Penitential Psalms. On his death-bed he kept
reciting the verses of the *Miserere*, with his cheeks streaming with
tears; and during his agony he went through a terrible contest to
overcome the fear of damnation. But a few

minutes before he died, all his doubts disappeared and were succeeded by
a holy trust. He uttered the responses in a low but audible voice; and
when at last the Mother of God appeared before him, he lifted up his
arms with joy and breathed a gentle sigh, as if placing his soul in her
hand. He died on the Octave of the Assumption, 1285.

**Reflection**.—Endeavor so to act as you would wish to have acted when
you stand before your Judge. This is the rule of the Saints, and the
only safe rule for all.
