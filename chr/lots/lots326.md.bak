### October 20.—ST. JOHN CANTIUS.

ST. JOHN was born at Kenty in Poland in 1403, and studied at Cracow with
great ability, industry, and success, while his modesty and virtue drew
all hearts to him. He was for a short time in charge of a parish; but he
shrank from the burden of responsibility, and returned to his life of
professor at Cracow. There for many years he lived a life of unobtrusive
virtue, self-denial, and charity. His love for the Holy See led him
often in pilgrimage to Rome, on foot and alone, and his devotion to the
Passion drew him once to Jerusalem, where he hoped to win a martyr's
crown by preaching to the Turks. He died in 1473, at the age of seventy.

**Reflection**.—He who orders all his doings according to the will of
God may often be spoken of by the world as simple and stupid; but in the
end he wins the esteem and confidence of the world itself, and the
approval and peace of God.
