### June 1.—ST. JUSTIN, Martyr.

ST. JUSTIN was born of heathen parents at. Neapolis in Samaria, about
the year 103. He was well educated, and gave himself to the study of
philosophy, but always with one object, that he might learn the
knowledge of God. He sought this knowledge among the contending schools
of philosophy, but always in vain, till at last God himself appeased the
thirst which He had created. One day, while Justin was walking by the
seashore, meditating on the thought of God, an old man met him and
questioned him on the subject of his doubts; and when he had made Justin
confess that the philosophers taught nothing certain about God, he told
him of the writings of the inspired prophets and of Jesus Christ Whom
they announced, and bade him seek light and understanding through
prayer. The Scriptures and the constancy of the Christian martyrs led
Justin from the darkness of human reason to the light of faith. In his
zeal for the Faith he travelled to Greece, Egypt, and Italy, gaining
many to Christ. At Rome he sealed his testimony with his blood,
surrounded by his disciples. "Do you think," the prefect said to Justin,
"that by dying you will enter heaven, and be rewarded by God?" "I do not
think," was the Saint's answer; "I know." Then, as now, there were many
religious opinions, but only one certain—the certainty of the Catholic
faith. This certainty should be the measure of our confidence and our
zeal.

**Reflection**.—We have received the gift of faith with little labor of
our own. Let us learn how to value it from those who reached it after
long search, and lived in the misery of a world which did not know God.
Let us fear, as St. Justin did, the account we shall have to render for
the gift of God.
