### December 20.—ST. PHILOGONIUS, Bishop.

ST. PHILOGONIUS was educated for the law, and appeared at the bar with
great success. He was admired for his eloquence, but still more for his
integrity and the sanctity of his life. This was considered a sufficient
motive for dispensing with the canons, which require some time spent
among the clergy before a person be advanced to the highest station in
the Church. Philogonius was placed in the see of Antioch, upon the death
of Vitalis in

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 318. When Arius
broached his blasphemies at Alexandria in 318, St. Alexander condemned
him, and sent the sentence in a synodal letter to St. Philogonius, who
strenuously defended the Catholic faith before the assembly of the
Council of Nice. In the storms which were raised -against the Church,
first by Maximin II. and afterward by Licinius, St. Philogonius deserved
the title of Confessor; he died in the year 322, the fifth of his
episcopal dignity.

**Reflection**.—St. Philogonius had so perfectly renounced the world,
and crucified its inordinate desires in his heart, that he received in
this life the earnest of Christ's Spirit, was admitted to the sacred
council of the heavenly King, and had free access to the Almighty. A
soul must here learn the heavenly spirit, and be well versed in the
occupations of the blessed, that hopes to reign with them hereafter.
