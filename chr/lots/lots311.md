### October 5.—ST. PLACID, Martyr.

ST. PLACID was born in Rome, in the year 515, of a patrician family, and
at seven years of age was taken by his father to the monastery of
Subiaco. At thirteen years of age he followed St. Benedict to the new
foundation at Monte Casino, where he grew up in the practice of a
wonderful austerity and innocence of life. He had scarcely completed his
twenty-first year when he was selected to establish a monastery in
Sicily upon some estates which had been given by his father to St.
Benedict. He spent four years in building his monastery, and the fifth
had not elapsed before an inroad of barbarians burned everything to the
ground, and put to a lingering death not only St. Placid and thirty
monks who had joined him, but also his two brothers, Eutychius and
Victorinus, and his holy sister Flavia, who had come to visit him. The
monastery was rebuilt, and still stands under his invocation.

**Reflection**.—Adversity is the touchstone of the soul, because it
discovers the character of the virtue which it possesses. One act of
thanksgiving when matters go wrong with us is worth a thousand thanks
when things are agreeable to our inclinations.
