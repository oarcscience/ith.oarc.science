### September 21.—ST. MATTHEW, Apostle.

ONE day, as Our Lord was walking by the Sea of Galilee, He saw, sitting
at the receipt of custom, Matthew the publican, whose business it was to
collect the taxes from the people for their Roman masters. Jesus said to
him, "Follow Me;" and leaving all, Matthew arose and followed Him. Now
the publicans were abhorred by the Jews as enemies of their country,
outcasts, and notorious sinners, who enriched themselves by extortion
and fraud. No Pharisee would sit with one at table. Our Saviour alone
had compassion for them. So St. Matthew made a great feast, to which he
invited Jesus and His disciples, with a number of these publicans, who
henceforth began

eagerly to listen to Him. It was then, in answer to the murmurs of the
Pharisees, that He said, "They that are in health need not the
physician. I have not come to call the just, but sinners to penance."
After the Ascension, St. Matthew remained some years in Judæa, and there
wrote his gospel, to teach his countrymen that Jesus was their true Lord
and King, foretold by the prophets. St. Matthew afterward preached the
Faith far and wide, and is said to have finished his course in Parthia.

**Reflection**.—Obey all inspirations of Our Lord as promptly as St.
Matthew, who, at a single word, "laid down," says St. Bridget, "the
heavy burden of the world to put on the light and sweet yoke of Christ."
