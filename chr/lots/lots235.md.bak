### July 26.—ST. ANNE.

ST. ANNE was the spouse of St. Joachim, and was chosen by God to be the
mother of Mary, His own blessed Mother on earth. They were both of the
royal house of David, and their lives were wholly occupied in prayer and
good works. One thing only was wanting to their union.—they were
childless, and this was held as a bitter misfortune among the Jews. At
length, when Anne was an aged woman, Mary was born, the fruit rather of
grace than of nature, and the child more of God than of man. With the
birth of Mary the aged Anne began a new life: she watched her every
movement with reverent tenderness, and felt herself hourly sanctified by
the presence of her immaculate child. But she had vowed her daughter to
God, to God Mary had consecrated herself again, and to Him Anne gave her
back. Mary was three years old when Anne and Joachim led her up the
Temple steps, saw her pass by herself into the inner sanctuary, and then
saw her no more. Thus was Anne left childless in her lone old age, and
deprived of her purest earthly joy just when she needed it most. She
humbly adored the Divine Will, and began again to watch and pray, till
God called her to unending rest with the Father and the Spouse of Mary
in the home of Mary's Child.

**Reflection**.—St. Anne is glorious among the Saints, not only as the
mother of Mary, but because she gave Mary to God. Learn from her to
reverence a divine vocation as the highest privilege, and to sacrifice
every natural tie, however holy, at the call of God.
