### March 3.—ST. CUNEGUNDES, Empress.

ST. CUNEGUNDES was the daughter of Siegfried, the first Count of
Luxemburg, and Hadeswige, his pious wife. They instilled into her from
her cradle the most tender sentiments of piety, and married her to St.
Henry, Duke of Bavaria, who, upon the death of the Emperor Otho III.,
was chosen king of the Romans, and crowned on the 6th of June, 1002. She
was crowned at Paderborn on St. Laurence's day. In the year 1014 she
went with her husband to Rome, and received the imperial crown with him
from the hands of Pope Benedict VIII. She had, by St. Henry's consent,
before her marriage made a vow of virginity. Calumniators afterwards
made vile accusations against her, and the holy empress, to remove the
scandal of such a slander, trusting in God to prove her innocence,
walked over red-hot ploughshares without being hurt. The emperor
condemned his too scrupulous fears and credulity, and from that time
they lived in the strictest union

of hearts, conspiring to promote in everything God's honor and the
advancement of piety.

Going once to make a retreat in Hesse, she fell dangerously ill, and
made a vow to found a monastery, if she recovered, at Kaffungen, near
Cassel, in the diocese of Paderborn, which she executed in a stately
manner, and gave it to nuns of the Order of St. Benedict. Before it was
finished St. Henry died, in 1024. She earnestly recommended his soul to
the prayers of others, especially to her blear nuns, and expressed her
longing desire of joining them. She had already exhausted her treasures
in founding bishoprics and monasteries, and in relieving the poor, and
she had therefore little left now to give. But still thirsting to
embrace perfect evangelical poverty, and to renounce all to serve God
without obstacle, she assembled a great number of prelates to the
dedication of her church of Kaffungen on the anniversary day of her
husband's death, 1025; and after the gospel was sung at Mass she offered
on the altar a piece of the true cross, and then, putting off her
imperial robes, clothed herself with a poor habit; her hair was cut off,
and the bishop put on her a veil, and a ring as a pledge of her fidelity
to her heavenly Spouse. After she was consecrated to God in religion,
she seemed entirely to forget that she had been empress, and behaved as
the last in the house, being persuaded that she was 30 before God. She
prayed and read much, worked with her hands, and took a singular
pleasure in visiting and comforting the sick. Thus she passed the last
fifteen years of her life. Her mortifications at length reduced her to a
very weak condition, and brought on her last sickness. Perceiving that
they were preparing a cloth fringed with gold to cover her corpse after
her death, she changed color and ordered it to be taken away; nor could
she be at rest till she was promised she should be buried as a poor
religious in her habit. She died on the 3d of March, 1040. Her body was
carried to Bamberg and buried near that of her husband. She was solemnly
canonized by Innocent III. in 1200.

**Reflection**.—Detachment of the mind, at least, is needful to those
who cannot venture on an effectual renunciation.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "So likewise every
one of you," saith Jesus Christ, "that doth not renounce all that he
possesseth, cannot be My disciple."
