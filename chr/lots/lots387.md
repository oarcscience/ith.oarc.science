### December 18.—ST. GATIAN, Bishop.

ST. GATIAN came from Rome with St. Dionysius of Paris, about the middle
of the third century, and preached the Faith principally at Tours in
Gaul, where he fixed his episcopal see. The Gauls in that part were
extremely addicted to the worship of their idols. But no contradictions
or sufferings were able to discourage or daunt this true apostle, and by
perseverance he gained several to Christ. He assembled his little flock
in grots and caves, and there celebrated the divine mysteries. He was
obliged often to lie hid in lurking holes a long time in order to escape
a cruel death, with which the heathens frequently threatened him, and
which he was always ready to receive with joy if he had fallen into
their hands. Having continued his labors with unwearied zeal amidst
frequent sufferings and dangers for near the space of fifty years, he
died in peace, and was honored with miracles.

goodness He gives us all some things to renounce

or to suffer for Him, and it is by our loving submission to His will
that we show ourselves to be Christians.
