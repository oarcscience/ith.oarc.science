### April 6.—ST. CELESTINE, Pope.

ST. CELESTINE was a native of Rome, and upon the demise of Pope Boniface
he was chosen to succeed him, in September 422, by the wonderful consent
of the whole city. His first official act was to confirm the
condemnation of an African bishop who had been convicted of grave
crimes. He wrote also to the bishops of the provinces of Vienne and
Narbonne in Gaul, to correct several abuses, and ordered, among other
things, that absolution or reconciliation should never be refused to any
dying sinner who sincerely asked it; for repentance depends not so much
on time as on the heart. He assembled a synod at Rome in 430, in which
the writings of Nestorius were examined, and his blasphemies in
maintaining in Christ a divine and a human person were condemned. The
Pope pronounced sentence of excommunication against Nestorius, and
deposed him. Being informed that Agricola, the son of a British bishop
called Saverianus, who had been married before he was raised to the
priesthood, had spread the seeds of the Pelagian heresy in Britain, St.
Celestine sent thither St. Germanus of Auxerre, whose zeal and conduct
happily prevented the threatening danger. He also sent St. Palladius, a
Roman, to preach the Faith to the Scots, both in North Britain and in
Ireland, and many authors of the life of St. Patrick say that apostle
likewise received his commission to preach to the Irish from St.
Celestine, in 431.

died on the 1st of August, in 432, having reigned almost ten years.

**Reflection**.—Vigilance is truly needful to those to whom the care of
souls has been confided. "Blessed are the servants whom the Lord at His
coming shall find watching."
