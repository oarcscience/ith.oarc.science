### February 8.—ST. JOHN OF MATHA.

THE life of St. John of Matha was one long course of self-sacrifice for
the glory of God and the good of his neighbor. As a child, his chief
delight was serving the poor; and he often told them he had come into
the world for no other end but to wash their feet. He studied at Paris
with such distinction that his professors advised him to become a
priest, in order that his talents might render greater service to
others; and, for this end, John gladly sacrificed his high rank and
other worldly advantages. At his first Mass an angel appeared, clad in
white, with a red and blue cross on his breast, and his hands reposing
on the heads of a Christian and a Moorish captive. To ascertain what
this signified, John repaired to St. Felix of Valois, a holy hermit
living near Meaux, under whose direction he led a life of extreme
penance. The angel again appeared, and they then set out for Rome, to
learn the will of God from the lips of the Sovereign Pontiff, who told
them to devote themselves to the redemption of

captives. For this purpose they founded the Order of the Holy Trinity.
The religious fasted every day, and gathering alms throughout Europe
took them to Barbary, to redeem the Christian slaves. They devoted
themselves also to the sick and prisoners in all countries. The charity
of St. John in devoting his life to the redemption of captives was
visibly blessed by God. On his second return from Tunis he brought back
one hundred and twenty liberated slaves. But the Moors attacked him at
sea, over- i powered his vessel, and doomed it to destruction, with all
on board, by taking away the rudder and sails, and leaving it to the
mercy of the winds. St. John tied his cloak to the mast, and prayed,
saying, "Let God arise, and let His enemies be scattered. O Lord, Thou
wilt save the humble, and wilt bring down the eyes of the proud."
Suddenly the wind filled the small sail, and, without guidance, carried
the ship safely in a few days to Ostia, the port of Rome, three hundred
leagues from Tunis. Worn out by his heroic labors, John died in 1213, at
the age of fifty-three.

**Reflection**.—Let us never forget that our blessed Lord, bade us love
our neighbor not only as ourselves, but as He loved us, Who afterwards
sacrificed Himself for us.
