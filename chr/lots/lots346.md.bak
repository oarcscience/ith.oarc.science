### November 8.—THE FEAST OF THE HOLY RELICS.

PROTESTANTISM pretends to regard the veneration which the Church pays to
the relics of the Saints as a sin, and contends that this pious practice
is a remnant of paganism. The Council of Trent, on the contrary, has
decided that the bodies of the martyrs and other Saints, who were living
members of Jesus Christ and temples of the Holy Ghost, are to be honored
by the faithful. This decision was based upon the established usage of
the earliest days of the Church, and upon the teaching of the Fathers
and of the Councils. The Council orders, however, that all abuse of this
devotion is to be avoided carefully, and forbids any relics to be
exposed which have not been approved by the bishops, and these prelates
are recommended to instruct the people faithfully in the teaching of the
Church on this subject. While we regret, then, the errors of the impious
and of heretics, let us profit by the advantages which we gain by
hearkening to the voice of the Church.
