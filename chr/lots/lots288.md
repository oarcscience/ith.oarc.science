### September 12.—ST. GUY OF ANDERLECHT.

AS a child Guy had two loves, the Church and the poor. The love of
prayer growing more and more, he left his poor home at Brussels to seek
greater poverty and closer union with God. He arrived at Laeken, near
Brussels, and there showed such devotion before Our Lady's shrine that
the priest besought him to stay and serve the Church. Thenceforth his
great joy was to be always in the church, sweeping the floor and
ceiling, polishing the altars, and cleansing the sacred vessels. By day
he still found time and means to befriend the poor, so that his
almsgiving became famous in all those parts. A merchant of Brussels,
hearing of the generosity of this poor sacristan, came to Laeken, and
offered him a share in his business. Guy could not bear to leave the
church; but the offer seemed providential, and he at last closed with
it. Their ship, however, was lost on the first voyage, and on returning
to Laeken Guy found his place filled. The rest of his life was one long
penance for his inconstancy. About the year 1033, finding his end at
hand, he returned to Anderlecht,

in his own country. As he died, a light shone round him, and a voice was
heard proclaiming his eternal reward.

**Reflection**.—Jesus was only nine months in the womb of Mary, three
hours on the cross, three days in the sepulchre, but He is always in the
tabernacle. Does our reverence before Him bear witness to this most
blessed truth?
