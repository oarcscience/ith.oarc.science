### August 9.—ST. ROMANUS, Martyr.

ST. ROMANUS was a soldier in Rome at the time of the martyrdom of St.
Laurence. Seeing the joy and constancy with which that holy martyr
suffered his torments, he was moved to embrace the Faith, and addressing
himself to St. Laurence, was instructed and baptized by him in prison.
Confessing aloud what he had done, he was arraigned, condemned, and
beheaded the day before the martyrdom of St. Laurence. Thus he arrived
at his crown before his guide and master. The body of St. Romanus was
first buried on the road to Tibur, but his remains were translated to
Lucca, where they are kept under the high altar of a beautiful church
which bears his name.

men. It was the usual saying of the apostle St. Matthias, "The faithful
sins if his neighbor sins." Such ought to be the zeal of every one to
instruct and edify his neighbor by word and example.
