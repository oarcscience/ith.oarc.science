### August 12.—ST. CLARE, Abbess.

ON Palm Sunday, March 17, 1212, the Bishop of Assisi left the altar to
present a palm to a noble maiden, eighteen years of age, whom
bashfulness had detained in her place. This maiden was St. Clare.
Already she had

learnt from St. Francis to hate the world, and was secretly resolved to
live for God alone. The same night she escaped, with one companion, to
the Church of the Portiuncula, where she was met by St. Francis and his
brethren. At the altar of Our Lady, St. Francis cut off her hair,
clothed her in his habit of penance, a piece of sack-cloth, with his
cord as a girdle. Thus she was espoused to Christ. In a miserable house
outside Assisi she founded her Order, and was joined by her sister,
fourteen years of age, and afterwards by her mother and other noble
ladies. They went barefoot, observed perpetual abstinence, constant
silence, and perfect poverty. While the Saracen army of Frederick II.
was ravaging the valley of Spoleto, a body of infidels advanced to
assault St. Clare's convent, which stood outside Assisi. The Saint
caused the Blessed Sacrament to be placed in a monstrance, above the
gate of the monastery facing the enemy, and kneeling before it, prayed,
"Deliver not to beasts, O Lord, the souls of those who confess to Thee."
A voice from the Host replied, "My protection will never fail you." A
sudden panic seized the infidel host, which took to flight, and the
Saint's convent was spared. During her illness of twenty-eight years the
Holy Eucharist was her only support and spinning linen for the altar the
one work of her hands. She died in 1253, as the Passion was being read,
and Our Lady and the angels conducted her to glory.

**Reflection**.—In a luxurious and effeminate age, the daughters of St.
Clare still bear the noble title of poor, and preach by their daily
lives the poverty of Jesus Christ.
