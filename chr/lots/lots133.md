### April 24.—ST. FIDELIS OF SIGMARINGEN.

FIDELIS was born at Sigmaringen in 1577, of noble parents. In his youth
he frequently approached the sacraments, visited the sick and the poor,
and spent moreover many hours before the altar. For a time he followed
the legal profession, and was remarkable for his advocacy of the poor
and his respectful language towards his opponents. Finding it difficult
to become both a rich lawyer and a good Christian, Fidelis entered the
Capuchin. Order, and embraced a life of austerity and prayer. Hair
shirts, iron-pointed girdles, and disciplines were penances too light
for his fervor; and being filled with a desire of martyrdom, he rejoiced
at being sent to Switzerland by the newly-founded Congregation of
Propaganda, and braved every peril to rescue souls from the diabolical
heresy of Calvin. When preaching at Sevis he was fired at by a
Calvinist, but the fear of death could not deter him from proclaiming
divine truth. After his sermon he was waylaid by a body of Protestants
headed by a minister, who attacked him and tried to force him to embrace
their so-called. reform. But he said, "I came to refute your errors, not
to embrace them; I will never renounce Catholic doctrine, which is the
truth of all ages, and I fear not death." On this they fell upon him
with their poignards, and the first martyr of Propaganda went to receive
his palm.

**Reflection**.—We delight in decorating the altars of God with flowers,
lights, and jewels, and it is right to do so; but if we wish to offer to
God gifts of higher value, let us, in imitation of St. Fidelis, save the
souls who but for us would be lost; for so we shall offer Him, as it
were, the jewels of paradise.
