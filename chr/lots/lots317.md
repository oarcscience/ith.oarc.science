### October 11.—ST. TARACHUS and his Companions.

IN the year 304, Tarachus, Probus, and Andronicus, differing in age and
nationality, but united in the bonds of faith, being denounced as
Christians to Numerian, Governor of Cilicia, were arrested at
Pompeiopolis, and conducted to Tharsis. They underwent a first
examination in that town, after which their limbs were torn with iron
hooks, and they were taken back to prison covered with wounds. Being
afterwards led to Mopsuestia, they were submitted to a second
examination, ending in a manner equally cruel as the first. They
underwent a third examination at Anazarbis, followed by greater torments
still. The governor, unable to shake their constancy, had them kept
imprisoned that he might torture them further at the approaching games.
They were borne to the amphitheatre, but the most ferocious animals, on
being let loose on them, came crouching to their feet and licked their
wounds. The judge, reproaching the jailers with connivance, ordered the
martyrs to be despatched by the gladiators.

**Reflection**.—Such is true Christian devotion. "Neither death nor life
shall be able to separate us from the love that is in Christ Jesus."
