### April 13.—ST. HERMENEGILD, Martyr.

LEOVIGILD, King of the Visigoths, had two sons, Hermenegild and Recared,
who reigned conjointly with him. All three were Arians, but Hermenegild
married a. zealous Catholic, the daughter of Sigebert, Ring of France,
and by her holy example was converted to the faith. His father, on
hearing the news, denounced him as a traitor, and marched to seize his
person. Hermenegild tried to rally the Catholics of Spain in his
defence, but they were too weak to make any stand, and, after a two
years fruitless struggle, he surrendered on the assurance of a free
pardon. When safely in the royal camp, the king had him loaded with
fetters and cast into a foul dungeon at Seville. Tortures and bribes
were in turn employed to shake his faith, but Hermenegild wrote to his
father that he held the crown as nothing, and preferred to lose sceptre
and life rather than betray the truth of God. At length, on Easter

night, an Arian bishop entered his cell, and promised him his father's
pardon if he would but receive Communion at his hands. Hermenegild
indignantly rejected the offer, and knelt with joy for his depth-stroke.
The same night a light streaming from his cell told the Christians who
were watching near that the martyr had won his crown, and was keeping
his Easter with the Saints in glory.

Leovigild on his death-bed, though still an Arian, bade Recared seek out
St. Leander, whom he had himself cruelly persecuted, and, following
Hermenegild's example, be received by him into the Church. Recared did
so, and on his father's death labored so earnestly for the extirpation
of Arianism that he brought over the whole nation of the Visigoths to
the Church. "Nor is it to be wondered," says St. Gregory, "that he came
thus to be a preacher of the true faith, seeing that he was brother of a
martyr, whose merits did help him to bring so many into the lap of God's
Church."

**Reflection**.—St. Hermenegild teaches us that constancy and sacrifice
are the hest arguments for the Faith, and the surest way to win souls to
God.
