### June 26.—STS. JOHN AND PAUL, Martyrs.

THESE two Saints were both officers in the army under Julian the
Apostate, and received the crown of martyrdom, probably in 362. They
glorified God by a double victory; they despised the honors of the
world, and triumphed over its threats and torments. They saw many wicked
men prosper in their impiety, but were not dazzled by their example.
They considered that worldly prosperity which attends impunity in sin is
the most dreadful of all judgments; and how false and short-lived was
this glittering prosperity of Julian, who in a moment fell into the pit
which he himself had dug! But the martyrs, by the momentary labor of
their conflict, purchased an immense weight of never-fading glory; their
torments were, by their heroic patience and invincible virtue and
fidelity, a spectacle worthy of God, Who looked down upon them from the
throne of His glory, and held His arm stretched out to strengthen them,
and to put on their heads immortal crowns in the happy moment of their
victory.

**Reflection**.—The Saints always accounted that they had done nothing
for Christ so long as they had not resisted to blood, and by pouring
forth the last drop completed their sacrifice. Every action of our lives
ought to spring from this fervent motive, and we should consecrate
ourselves to the divine service with our whole strength; we must always
bear in mind that we owe to God all that we are, and, after all we can
do, are unprofitable servants, and do only what we are bound to do.
