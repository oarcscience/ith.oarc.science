### April 4.—ST. ISIDORE, Archbishop.

ISIDORE was born of a ducal family, at Carthagena in Spain. His two
brothers, Leander, Archbishop of Seville, Fulgentius, Bishop of Ecija,
and his sister Florentina, are Saints. As a boy he despaired at his ill
success in study, and ran away from school. Resting in his flight at a
roadside spring, he observed a stone, which was hollowed out by the
dripping water. This decided him to return, and by hard application he
succeeded where he had failed. He went back to his master, and with the
help of God became, even as a youth, one of the most learned men of the
time. He assisted in converting Prince Recared, the leader of the Arian
party; and with his aid, though at the constant peril of his own life,
he expelled that heresy from Spain. Then, following a call from God, he
turned a deaf ear to the entreaties of his friends, and embraced a
hermit's life. Prince Recared and many of the nobles and clergy of
Seville went to persuade him to come forth, and represented the needs of
the times, and the good he could do, and had already done, among the
people. He refused, and, as far as we can judge, that refusal gave him
the necessary opportunity of acquiring the virtue and the power which
afterwards made him an illustrious Bishop and Doctor of the Church. On
the death of his brother Leander he was called

to fill the vacant see. As a teacher, ruler, founder, and reformer, he
labored not only in his own diocese, but throughout Spain, and even in
foreign countries. He died in Seville on April 4, 636, and within
sixteen years of his death was declared a Doctor of the Catholic Church.

**Reflection**.—The strength of temptation usually lies in the fact that
its object is something flattering to our pride, soothing to our sloth,
or in some way attractive to the meaner passions. St. Isidore teaches us
to listen neither to the promptings of nature nor the plausible advice
of friends when they contradict the voice of God.
