### May 12.—ST. EPIPHANIUS, Archbishop.

ST. EPIPHANIUS was born about the year 310, in Palestine. In his youth
he began the study of the Holy Scriptures, embraced a monastic life, and
went into Egypt to perfect himself in the exercises of that state, in
the deserts of that country. He returned to Palestine about the year
333, and built a monastery near the place of his birth. His labors in
the exercise of virtue seemed to some to surpass his strength; but his
apology always was: "God gives not the kingdom of heaven but on
condition that we labor; and all we can do bears no proportion to such a
crown." To his corporal austerities he added an indefatigable
application to prayer and study. Most books then in vogue passed through
his hands; and he improved himself very much in learning by his travels
into many parts.

Although the skilful director of many others, St. Epiphanius took the
great St. Hilarion as his master in a spiritual life, and enjoyed the
happiness of his direction and intimate acquaintance from the year 333
to 356. The reputation of his virtue made St. Epiphanius known to
distant countries, and about the year 367 he was chosen Bishop of
Salamis in Cyprus. But he still wore the monastic habit, and continued
to govern his monastery in Palestine, which he visited from time to
time. He sometimes relaxed his austerities in favor of hospitality,
preferring charity to abstinence. No one surpassed him in tenderness and
charity to the poor. The veneration which all men had for his sanctity
exempted him from. the persecution of the Arian Emperor Valens. In 376
he undertook a journey to Antioch in the hope of converting Vitalis, the
Apollinarist bishop; and in 382 he accompanied St. Paulinus from that
city to Rome, where they lodged at the house of St. Paula; our Saint in
return entertained her afterward ten days in Cyprus in 385. The very
name of

an error in faith, or the shadow of danger of evil, affrighted him, and
the Saint fell into some mistakes on certain occasions, which proceeded
from zeal and simplicity. He was on his way back to Salamis, after a
short absence, when he died in 403, having been bishop thirty-six years.

**Reflection**.—"In this is charity: not as though we had loved God, but
because He hath first loved us."
