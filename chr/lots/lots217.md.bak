### July 9.—ST. EPHREM, Deacon.

ST. EPHREM is the light and glory of the Syriac Church. A mere youth, he
entered on the religious life at Nisibis, his native place. Long years
of retirement taught him the science of the Saints, and then God called
him to Edessa, there to teach what he had learned so well. He defended
the Faith against heresies, in books which have made him known as the
Prophet of the Syrians. Crowds hung upon his words. Tears used to stop
his voice when he preached. He trembled and made his hearers tremble at
the thought of God's judgments; but he found in compunction and humility
the way to peace, and he rested with unshaken confidence in the mercy of
our blessed Lord. "I am setting out," he says, speaking of his own
death, "I am setting out on a journey hard and dangerous. Thee, O Son of
God, I have taken for my Viaticum. When I am hungry, I will feed on
Thee. The infernal fire will not venture near me, for it cannot bear the
fragrance of Thy Body and Thy Blood." His hymns won the hearts of the
people, drove out the hymns of the Gnostic heretics, and gained for him
the title which he bears in the Syriac Liturgy to this day—"the Harp of
the Holy Ghost." Passionate as he was by nature, from the time he
entered religion no one ever saw him angry. Abounding in labors till the
last, he toiled for the suffering poor at Edessa in the famine of 378,
and there lay down to die in extreme old age. What was the secret of
success so various and so complete? Humility, which made him distrust
himself and trust God. Till his death, he wept for the slight sins
committed in the thoughtlessness of boyhood. He refused the dignity of
the priesthood. "I," he told St. Basil, whom he went to see at the
bidding of the Holy Spirit, "I am that Ephrem who has wandered from the
path of

heaven." Then bursting into tears, he cried out, "O my father, have pity
on a sinful wretch, and lead me on the narrow way."

**Reflection**.—Humility is the path which leads to abiding peace and
brings us near to the consolations of God.
