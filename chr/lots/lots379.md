### December 10.—ST. EULALIA, Virgin, Martyr.

ST. EULALIA was a native of Merida, in Spain. She was but twelve years
old when the bloody edicts of Diocletian were issued. Eulalia presented
herself before the cruel judge Dacianus, and reproached him for
attempting to destroy souls by compelling them to renounce the only true
God. The governor commanded her to be seized, and at first tried to win
her over by flattery, but failing in this, he had recourse to threats,
and caused the most dreadful instruments of torture to be placed before
her eyes, saying to her: "All this you shall escape if you will but
touch a little salt and frankincense with the tip of your finger."
Provoked at these seducing flatteries, our Saint threw down the idol,
and trampled upon the cake which was laid for the sacrifice. At the
judge's order, two executioners tore her tender sides with iron hooks,
so as to leave the very bones bare. Next lighted torches were applied to
her breasts and sides; under which torment, instead of groans, nothing
was heard from her mouth but thanksgivings. The fire at length catching
her hair, surrounded her head and face, and the Saint was stifled by the
smoke and flame.

**Reflection**.—The apostles rejoiced "that they were accounted worthy
to suffer reproach for the name of Jesus." Do we bear our crosses with
the same spirit?
