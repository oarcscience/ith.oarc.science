### November 20.—ST. FELIX OF VALOIS.

ST. FELIX was son of the Count of Valois. His mother throughout his
youth did all she could to cultivate in him a spirit of charity. The
unjust divorce between his parents matured a long-formed resolution of
leaving the world; and, confiding his mother to her pious brother,
Thibault, Count of Champagne, he took the Cistercian habit at Clairvaux.
His rare virtues drew on him such admiration that, with St. Bernard's
consent, he fled to Italy, where he led an austere life with an aged
hermit. At this time he was ordained priest, and his old counsellor
having died, he returned to France, and for many years lived as a
solitary at Cerfroid. Here God inspired him with the desire of founding
an Order for the redemption of Christian captives, and moved St. John of
Matha, then a youth, to conceive a similar wish. Together they drew up
the rules of the Order of the Holy Trinity. Many disciples gathered
round them; and, seeing that the time had come for further action, the
two Saints made a pilgrimage to Rome to obtain the confirmation of the
Order from Innocent III. Their prayer was granted, and the last fifteen
, years of Felix's long life were spent in organizing and developing his
rapidly increasing foundations. He died in 1213.

**Reflection**.—"Think how much," says St. John Chrysostom, "and how
often thy mouth has sinned, and thou

wilt devote thyself entirely to the conversion of sinners. For by this
one means thou wilt blot out all thy sins, in that thy mouth will become
the mouth of God."
