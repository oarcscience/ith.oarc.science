### September 26.—STS. CYPRIAN and JUSTINA, Martyrs.

THE detestable superstition of St. Cyprian's idolatrous parents devoted
him from his infancy to the devil, and he was brought up in all the
impious mysteries of idolatry, astrology, and the black art. When
Cyprian had learned all the extravagances of these schools of error and
delusion, he hesitated at no crimes, blasphemed Christ, and committed
secret murders. There lived at Antioch a young Christian lady called
Justina, of high birth and great beauty. A pagan nobleman fell deeply in
love with her, and finding her modesty inaccessible, and her resolution
invincible, he applied to Cyprian for assistance. Cyprian, no less
smitten with the lady, tried every secret with which he was acquainted
to conquer her resolution. Justina, perceiving herself vigorously
attacked, studied to arm herself by prayer, watchfulness, and
mortification against all his artifices and the power of his spells.
Cyprian finding himself worsted by a superior power, began to consider
the weakness of the infernal spirits, and resolved to quit their service
and become a Christian. Agladius, who had been the first suitor to the
holy virgin, was likewise converted and baptized. The persecution of
Diocletian breaking out, Cyprian and Justina were seized,

and presented to the same judge. She was inhumanly scourged, and Cyprian
was torn with iron hooks. After this they were both sent in chains to
Diocletian, who commanded their heads to be struck off, which sentence
was executed.

**Reflection**.—If the errors and disorders of St. Cyprian show the
degeneracy of human nature corrupted by sin and enslaved to vice, his
conversion displays the power of grace and virtue to repair it. Let us
beg of God to send us grace to resist temptation, and to do His holy
will in all things.
