### ST. RITA OF CASCIA, WIDOW.

ST. RITA OF CASCIA, whose feast is celebrated on May 22, was born at
Rocca Porena, Italy, about the year 1386, and died at Cascia in the year
1456. Her parents opposed her desire to become a nun, and persuaded her
to marry a man who, in a short time, lost his reputation on account of
his cruelty. After being converted from his wicked ways, he was murdered
by an enemy. Rita's two sons then resolved to take revenge, but through
her prayers they repented. After their death, she applied several times
for admission into the Augustinian Convent at Cascia. Repeatedly refused
until God Himself cleared away all obstacles, she entered the convent,
made her profession and lived the life of a holy and devout Religious
for forty-two years, "a shining example of every Christian virtue, pure
as a lily, simple as a dove, and obedient as an angel." That "God is
wonderful in His Saints" is easily proved in the life of St. Rita, and,
owing to her great number of miracles, she is often styled "The Saint of
the Impossible."
