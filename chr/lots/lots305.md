### September 29.—ST. MICHAEL, Archangel.

"MI-CA-EL," or "Who is like to God?" Such was the cry of the great
Archangel when he smote the rebel Lucifer in the conflict of the
heavenly hosts, and from that hour he has been known as "Michael," the
captain of the armies of God, the type of divine fortitude, the champion
of every faithful soul in strife with the powers of evil.

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Thus he appears in
Holy Scripture as the guardian of the children of Israel, their comfort
and protector in times of sorrow or conflict. He it is who prepares for
their return from the Persian captivity, who leads the valiant Maccabees
to victory, and who rescues the body of Moses from the envious grasp of
the Evil One. And since Christ's coming the Church has ever venerated
St. Michael as her special patron and protector. She invokes him by name
in her confession of sin, summons him to the side of her children in the
agony of death, and chooses him as their escort from the chastening
flames of purgatory to the realms of holy light. Lastly, when Antichrist
shall have set up his kingdom on earth, it is Michael who will unfurl
once more the standard of the Cross, sound the last trumpet, and binding
together the false prophet and the beast, hurl them for all eternity
into the burning pool.

**Reflection**.—"Whenever," says St. Bernard, "any grievous temptation
or vehement sorrow oppresses thee, invoke thy guardian, thy leader; cry
out to him, and say, 'Lord, save us, lest we perish!'"
