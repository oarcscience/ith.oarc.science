### January 28.—ST. CYRIL OF ALEXANDRIA.

ST. CYRIL became Patriarch of Alexandria in 412. Having at first thrown
himself with ardor into the party politics of the place, God called him
to a nobler conflict. In 428, Nestorius, Bishop of Constantinople, began
to deny the unity of Person in Christ, and to refuse to the Blessed
Virgin the title of "Mother of God." He was strongly supported by
disciples and friends throughout the East. As the assertion of the
divine maternity of Our Lady was necessary to the integrity of the
doctrine of the Incarnation, so, with St. Cyril, devotion to the Mother
was the necessary complement of his devotion to the Son. St. Cyril,
after expostulating in vain, accused Nestorius to Pope Celestine. The
Pope commanded retraction, under pain of separation from the Church, and
intrusted St. Cyril with the conduct of the proceedings. The appointed
day, June 7, 431, found Nestorius and Cyril at Ephesus, with over 200
bishops. After waiting twelve days in vain for the Syrian bishops, the
council with Cyril tried Nestorius, and deposed him from his see. Upon
this the Syrians and Nestorians excommunicated St. Cyril, and complained
of him to the emperor as a peace-breaker. Imprisoned and threatened with
banishment, the Saint rejoiced to confess Christ by suffering. In time
it was recognized that St. Cyril was right, and with him the Church
triumphed. Forgetting his wrongs, and careless of controversial
punctilio, Cyril then reconciled himself with all who would consent to
hold the doctrine of the Incarnation intact. He died in 444.

**Reflection**.—The Incarnation is the mystery of God's dwelling within
us, and therefore should be the dearest object of our contemplation. It
was the passion of St. Cyril's life; for it he underwent toil and
persecution, and willingly sacrificed credit and friends.
