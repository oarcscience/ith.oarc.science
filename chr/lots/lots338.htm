<p>THE Church pays, day by day, a special veneration to some one of the holy men and women who have helped to establish it by their blood, develop it by their labors, or edify it by their virtues. But, in addition to those whom the Church honors by special designation, or has inscribed in her calendar, how many martyrs are there whose names are not recorded! How many humble virgins and holy penitents! How many just and holy anchorites or young children snatched away in their innocence! How many Christians who have died in grace, whose merits are known only to God, and who are themselves known only in heaven! Now should we forget those who remember us in their intercessions? Besides, are they not our brethren, our ancestors, friends, and fellow-Christians, with whom we have lived in daily companionship&#8212;in other words, our own family? Yea, it is one family; and our place is marked out in this home of eternal light and eternal love.</p>  
<p><b>Reflection</b>.&#8212;Let us have a solicitude to render ourselves worthy of "that chaste generation, so beautiful amid the glory where it dwells."</p>
