### December 11.—ST. DAMASUS, Pope.

ST. DAMASUS was born at Rome at the beginning of the fourth century. He
was archdeacon of the Roman Church in 355, when Pope Liberius was
banished to Berda, and followed him into exile, but afterward returned
to Rome. On the death of Liberius our Saint was chosen to succeed him.
Ursinus, a competitor for the high office, incited a revolt, but the
holy Pope took only such action as was becoming to the common father of
the faithful. Having freed the Church of this new schism, he turned his
attention to the extirpation of Arianism in the West and of
Apollinarianism in the East, and for this purpose

he convened several councils. He rebuilt the church of St. Laurence,
which to this day is known as St. Laurence *in Damaso;* he made many
valuable presents to this church, and settled upon it houses and lands
in its vicinity. He likewise drained all the springs of the Vatican,
which ran over the bodies that were buried there, and decorated the
sepulchres of a great number of martyrs in the cemeteries, and adorned
them with epitaphs in verse. Having sat eighteen years and two months,
he died on the 10th of December, in 384, being near fourscore years of
age.
