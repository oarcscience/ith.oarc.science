### September 20.—STS. EUSTACHIUS and Companions, Martyrs.

EUSTACHIUS, called Placidus before his conversion, was a distinguished
officer of the Roman army under the Emperor Trajan. One day, whilst
hunting a deer, he suddenly perceived between the horns of the animal
the

image of our crucified Saviour. Responsive to what he considered a voice
from heaven, he lost not a moment in becoming a Christian. In a short
time he lost all his possessions and his position, and his wife and
children were taken from him. Reduced to the most abject poverty, he
took service with a rich land-owner to tend his fields. In the mean time
the empire suffered greatly from the ravages of barbarians. Trajan
sought out our Saint, and placed him in command of the troops sent
against the enemy. During this campaign he found his wife and children,
whom he despaired of ever seeing again. Returning home victorious, he
was received in triumph and loaded with honors; but the emperor having
commanded him to sacrifice to the false gods, he refused. Infuriated at
this, Trajan ordered Eustachius with his wife and children to be exposed
to two starved lions; but instead of harming these faithful servants of
God, the beasts merely frisked and frolicked about them. The emperor,
grown more furious at this, caused the martyrs to be shut up inside a
brazen bull, under which a fire was kindled, and in this horrible manner
they were roasted to death.

**Reflection**.—It is not enough to encounter dangers with resolution;
we must with equal courage and constancy vanquish pleasure and the
softer passions, or we possess not the virtue of true fortitude.
