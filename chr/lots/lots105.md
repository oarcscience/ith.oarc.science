### March 30.—ST. JOHN CLIMACUS.

JOHN made, while still young, such progress in learning that he was
called the Scholastic. At the age of sixteen he turned from the
brilliant future which lay before him, and retired to Mt. Sinai, where
he put himself under the direction of a holy monk. Never was novice more
fervent, more unrelaxing in his efforts for self-mastery. After four
years he took the vows, and an aged abbot foretold that he would some
day be one of the greatest lights of the Church. Nineteen years later,
on the death of his director, he withdrew into a deeper solitude, where
he studied the lives and writings of the Saints, and was raised to an
unusual height of contemplation. The fame of his holiness and practical
wisdom drew crowds around him for advice and consolation. For his
greater profit he visited the solitudes of Egypt. At the age of
seventy-five he was chosen abbot of Mt. Sinai, and there "he dwelt in
the mount of God, and drew from the rich treasure of his heart priceless
riches of doctrine, which he poured forth with wondrous abundance and
benediction." He was induced by a brother abbot to write the rules by
which he had guided his life; and his book called the Climax, or Ladder
of Perfection, has been prized in all ages for its wisdom, its
clearness, and its unction. At the end of four years he would no longer
endure the honors and distractions of his office, and retired to his
solitude, where he died, in 605.

**Reflection**.—"Cast not from thee, my brother," says the Imitation of
Christ," the sure hope of attaining to the spiritual life; still hast
thou the time and the means."
