### June 7.—ST. ROBERT OF NEWMINSTER.

IN 1132 Robert was a monk at Whitby, England, when news arrived that
thirteen religious had been violently expelled from the Abbey of St.
Mary, in York, for having proposed to restore the strict Benedictine
rule. He at once set out to join them, and found them on the banks of
the Skeld, near Ripon, living in the midst of winter in a hut made of
hurdles and roofed with turf. In the spring they affiliated themselves
to St. Bernard's reform at Clairvaux, and for two years struggled on in
extreme poverty. At length the fame of their sanctity brought another
novice, Hugh, Dean of York, who endowed the community with all his
wealth, and thus laid the foundation of Fountains Abbey. In 1137
Raynulph, Baron of Morpeth, was so edified by the example of the monks
at Fountains that he built them a monastery in Northumberland, called
Newminster, of which St. Robert became abbot. The holiness of his life,
even more than his words, guided his brethren to perfection, and within
the next ten years three new communities went forth from this one house
to become centres of holiness in other parts. The abstinence of St.
Robert in refectory alone sufficed to maintain the mortified spirit of
the community. One Easter Day, his stomach, weakened by the fast of
Lent, could take no food, and he at last consented to try to eat some
bread sweetened with honey. Before it was brought, he felt this
relaxation would be a dangerous example for his subjects, and sent the
food untouched to the poor at the gate. The plate was received by a
young man of shining countenance, who

straightway disappeared. At the next meal the plate descended empty, and
by itself, to the abbot's place in the refectory, proving that what the
Saint sacrificed for his brethren had been accepted by Christ. At the
moment of Robert's death, in 1159, St. Godric, the hermit of Finchale,
saw his soul, like a globe of fire, borne up by the angels in a pathway
of light; and as the gates of heaven opened before them, a voice
repeated twice, "Enter now, my friends."

**Reflection**.—Reason and authority prove that virtue aught to be
practised. But facts alone prove that it is practised; and this is why
examples have more power to move our souls, and why our individual
actions are of such fearful importance for ethers as well as for
ourselves.
