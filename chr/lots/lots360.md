### November 21.—THE PRESENTATION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY.

RELIGIOUS parents never fail by devout prayer to consecrate their
children to the divine service and love, both before and after their
birth. Some amongst the Jews, not content with this general consecration
of their children, offered them to God in their infancy, by the hands of
the priests in the Temple, to be lodged in apartments belonging to the
Temple, and brought up in attending the priests and Levites in the
sacred ministry. It is an ancient tradition that the Blessed Virgin Mary
was thus solemnly offered to God in the Temple in her infancy. This
festival of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin the Church celebrates
this day. The tender soul of Mary was then adorned with the most
precious graces, an object of astonishment and praise to the angels, and
of the highest complacence to the adorable Trinity; the Father looking
upon her as His beloved daughter, the Son as one chosen and prepared to
become His mother, and the Holy Ghost as His darling spouse. Mary was
the first who set up the standard of virginity; and, by consecrating it
by a perpetual vow to Our Lord, she opened the way to all virgins who
have since followed her example.

**Reflection**.—Mary's first presentation to God was an offering most
acceptable in His sight. Let our consecration of ourselves to God be
made under her patronage, and assisted by her powerful intercession and
the union of her merits.
