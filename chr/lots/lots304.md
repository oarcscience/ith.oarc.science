### September 28.—ST. WENCESLAS, Martyr.

WENCESLAS was the son of a Christian Duke of Bohemia, but his mother was
a hard and cruel pagan. Through the care of his holy grandmother,
Ludmilla, herself a martyr, Wenceslas was educated in the true faith,
and imbibed a special devotion to the Blessed Sacrament. On the death of
his father, his mother, Drahomira, usurped the government and passed a
series of persecuting laws. In the interests of the Faith Wenceslas
claimed and obtained, through the support of the people, a large portion
of the country as his own kingdom. His mother secured the apostasy and
alliance of her second son, Boleslas, who became henceforth her ally
against the Christians. Wenceslas meanwhile ruled as a brave and pious
king, provided for all the needs of his people, and when his kingdom was
attacked, overcame in single combat, by the sign of the cross, the
leader of an invading army. In the service of God he was most constant,
and planted with his own hands the wheat and grapes for the Holy Mass,
at which he never failed daily to assist. His piety was the occasion of
his death. Once, after a banquet at his brother's palace, to which he
had been treacherously invited, he went, as was his wont at night, to
pray before the tabernacle. There, at midnight on the feast of the
Angels, 938, he received his crown of martyrdom, his brother dealing him
the death-blow.

**Reflection**.—St. Wenceslas teaches us that the safest place to meet
the trials of life, or to prepare for the stroke of death, is before
Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament.
