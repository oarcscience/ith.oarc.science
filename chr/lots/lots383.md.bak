every breast the most heroic sentiments of piety and religion. In
endeavoring to save the lives of his flock he exposed himself to the
swords of the infidels, who, after a thousand insults and indignities,

massacred by his side. His sister Eutropia, a virtuous virgin, fearing
she might be reserved for a fate worse than death, boldly cried out to
the infidels that it was her unalterable resolution rather to sacrifice
her life than her faith or her integrity and virtue. Upon which they
despatched her with their cutlasses.

**Reflection**.—Bear patiently and sweetly bodily sufferings, and
prepare for the day of trial by the courageous endurance of the daily
crosses incident to your state.
