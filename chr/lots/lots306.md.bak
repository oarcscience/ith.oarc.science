### September 30.—ST. JEROME, Doctor.

ST. JEROME, born in Dalmatia, in 329, was sent to school at Rome. His
boyhood was not free from fault. His thirst for knowledge was excessive,
and his love of books a passion. He had studied under the best masters,
visited foreign cities, and devoted himself to the pursuit of science.
But Christ had need of his strong will and active intellect for the
service of His Church. St. Jerome felt and obeyed the call, made a vow
of celibacy, fled from Rome to the wild Syrian desert, and there for
four years learnt in solitude, penance, and prayer a new lesson of
divine wisdom. This was his novitiate. The Pope soon summoned him to
Rome, and there put upon the now famous Hebrew scholar the task of
revising the Latin Bible, which was to be his noblest work. Retiring
thence to his beloved Bethlehem, the eloquent hermit poured forth from
his solitary cell for thirty years a stream of luminous writings upon
the Christian world.

**Reflection**.—"To know," says St. Basil, "how to submit thyself with
thy whole soul, is to know how to imitate Christ."
