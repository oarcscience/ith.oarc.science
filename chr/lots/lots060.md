### ST. ONESIMUS, Disciple of St. Paul.

HE was a Phrygian by birth, slave to Philemon, a person of note of the
city of Colossæ, converted to the faith by St. Paul. Having robbed his
master and being obliged to fly, he providentially met with St. Paul,
then a prisoner for the faith at Rome, who there converted and baptized
him, and sent him with his canonical letter of recommendation to
Philemon, by whom he was pardoned, set at liberty, and sent back to his
spiritual father, whom he afterwards faithfully served. That apostle
made him, with Tychicus, the bearer of his Epistle to the Colossians,
and afterwards, as St. Jerome and other Fathers witness, a preacher of
the Gospel and a bishop. He was crowned with martyrdom under Domitian in
the year 95.

**Reflection**.—With what excess of goodness does God communicate
Himself to souls that open themselves to Him! With what caresses does He
often visit them! With what a profusion of graces does He enrich and
strengthen them! In our trials and temptations let us then offer our
hearts to God, remembering, as St. Paul says, "To them that love God all
things work together unto good."
