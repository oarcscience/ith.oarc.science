### August 3.—THE FINDING OF ST. STEPHEN'S RELICS.

THE second festival in honor of the holy protomartyr St. Stephen was
instituted by the Church on the occasion of the discovery of his
precious remains. His body lay long concealed, under the ruins of an old
tomb, in a place twenty miles from Jerusalem, called Caphargamala, where
stood a church which was served by a venerable priest named Lucian. In
the year 415, on Friday, the 3d of December, about nine o'clock at
night, Lucian was sleeping in his bed in the baptistery, where he
commonly lay in order to guard the sacred vessels of the church. Being
half awake, he saw a tall, comely old man of a venerable aspect, who
approached him, and, calling him thrice by his name, bid him go to
Jerusalem and tell Bishop John to come and open the tombs in which his
remains and those of certain other servants of Christ lay, that through
their means God might open to many the gates of His clemency. This
vision was repeated twice. After the second time, Lucian went to
Jerusalem and laid the whole affair before Bishop John, who bade him go
and search for the relics, which, the Bishop concluded, would be found
under a heap of small stones which lay in a field near his church. In
digging up the earth here, three coffins or chests were found. Lucian
sent immediately to acquaint Bishop John with this. He was then at the
Council of Diospolis, and, taking along with him Eutonius, Bishop of
Sebaste, and Eleutherius, Bishop of Jericho, came to the place. Upon the
opening of St. Stephen's coffin the earth shook, and there came out of
the coffin such an agreeable odor that no one remembered to have ever
smelled anything like it. There was a vast multitude of people assembled
in that place, among whom were many persons afflicted with divers
distempers, of whom seventy-three recovered their health upon the spot.
They kissed the holy relics, and then shut them up. The Bishop consented
to leave a small portion of them at Caphargamala; the rest were carried
in the coffin with singing of psalms and hymns, to the Church of Sion at
Jerusalem. The

translation was performed on the 26th of December, on which day the
Church hath ever since honored the memory of St. Stephen, commemorating
the discovery of his relies on the 3d of August probably on account of
the dedication of some church in his honor.

**Reflection**.—St. Austin, speaking of the miracles of St. Stephen,
addresses himself to his flock as follows: "Let us so desire to obtain
temporal blessings by his intercession that we may merit, in imitating
him, those which are eternal."
