### June 16.—ST. JOHN FRANCIS REGIS.

ST. JOHN FRANCIS REGIS was born in Languedoc, in 1597. From his
tenderest years he showed evidences of uncommon sanctity by his
innocence of life, modesty, and love of prayer. At the age of eighteen
he entered the Society of Jesus. As soon as his studies were over, he
gave himself entirely to the salvation of souls. The winter he spent in
country missions, principally in mountainous districts; and in spite of
the rigor of the weather and the ignorance and roughness of the
inhabitants, he labored with such success that he gained innumerable
souls to God both from heresy and from a bad life. The summer he gave to
the towns. There his time was taken up in visiting hospitals and
prisons, in preaching and instructing, and in assisting all who in any
way stood in need of his services. In his works of mercy God often
helped him by miracles. In November, 1637, the Saint set out for his
second mission at Marthes. His road lay across valleys filled with snow
and over mountains frozen and precipitous. In climbing one of the
highest, a bush to which he was clinging gave way, and he broke his leg
in the fall. By the help of his companion he accomplished the remaining
six miles, and then, instead of seeing a surgeon, insisted on being
taken straight to the confessional. There, after several hours, the
curate of the parish found him still seated, and when his leg was
examined the fracture was found to be miraculously healed. He was so
inflamed with the love of God that he seemed to breathe, think, speak of
that alone, and he offered up the Holy Sacrifice with such attention and
fervor that those who assisted at it could not but feel something of the
fire with which he burned. After twelve years of unceasing labor, he
rendered his pure and innocent soul to his Creator, at the age of
forty-four.

**Reflection**.—When St. John Francis was struck in the face by a sinner
whom he was reproving, he replied, "If you only knew me, you would give
me much more than that" His meekness converted the man, and it is in
this spirit that he teaches us to win souls to God. How much might we do
if we could forget our own wants in remembering those of others, and put
our trust in God!
