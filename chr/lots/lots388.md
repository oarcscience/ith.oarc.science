### December 19.—ST. NEMESION, Martyr.

IN the persecution of Decius, Nemesion, an Egyptian, was apprehended at
Alexandria upon an indictment for theft. The servant of Christ easily
cleared himself of that charge, but was immediately accused of being a
Christian, and after being scourged and tormented more than the thieves,
was condemned to be burnt with the robbers and other malefactors. There
stood at the same time near the prefect's tribunal four soldiers and
another person, who, being Christians, boldly encouraged a confessor who
was hanging on the rack. They were taken before the judge, who condemned
them to be beheaded, but was astonished to see the joy with which they
walked to the place of execution. Heron, Ater, and Isidore, all
Egyptians, with Dioscorus, a youth only fifteen years old, were
committed at Alexandria in the same persecution. After enduring the most
cruel rending and disjointing of their limbs, they were burnt alive,
with the exception of Dioscorus, whom the judge discharged on account of
the tenderness of his years.

**Reflection**.—Can we call to mind the fervor of the Saints in laboring
and suffering cheerfully for God, and not feel a holy ardor glow in our
own breasts, and our souls strongly affected with their heroic
sentiments of virtue?
