### December 29.—ST. THOMAS OF CANTERBURY.

ST. THOMAS, son of Gilbert Becket, was born in Southwark, England, in
1117. When a youth he was attached to the household of Theobald,
Archbishop of Canterbury, who sent him to Paris and Bologna to study
law. He became Archdeacon of Canterbury, then Lord High Chancellor of
England; and in 1160, when Archbishop Theobald died, the king insisted
on the consecration of St. Thomas in his stead. St. Thomas refused,
warning the king that from that hour their friendship would be broken.
In the end he yielded, and was consecrated. The conflict at once broke
out; St. Thomas resisted the royal customs, which violated the liberties
of the Church and the laws of the realm. After six years of contention,
partly spent in. exile, St. Thomas, with full foresight of martyrdom
before him, returned as a good shepherd to his Church. On the 29th of
December, 1170, just as vespers were beginning, four knights broke into
the cathedral, crying: "Where is the archbishop? where is the traitor?"
The monks fled, and St. Thomas might easily have escaped. But he
advanced, saying: "Here I am—no traitor, but archbishop. What seek you?"
"Your life," they cried. "Gladly do I give it," was the reply; and
bowing his head, the invincible martyr was hacked and hewn till his soul
went to God. Six months later Henry II. submitted to be publicly
scourged at the Saint's shrine, and restored to the Church her full
rights.

**Reflection**.—"Learn from St. Thomas," says Father Faber, "to fight
the good fight even to the shedding of blood, or, to what men find
harder, the shedding of their good name by pouring it out to waste on
the earth."
