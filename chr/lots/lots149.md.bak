### May 8.—THE APPARITION OF ST. MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL.

IT is manifest, from the Holy Scriptures, that God is pleased to make
frequent use of the ministry of the heavenly spirits in the
dispensations of His providence in this world, and especially towards
man. Hence the name of Angel (which is not properly a denomination of
nature, but office) has been appropriated to them. The angels are

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

all pure spirits; they are, by a property of their nature, immortal, as
every spirit is. They have the power of moving or conveying themselves
from place to place, and such is their activity that it is not easy for
us to conceive it. Among the holy archangels, there are particularly
distinguished in Holy Writ Sts. Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. St.
Michael, whom the Church honors this day, was the prince of the faithful
angels who opposed Lucifer and his associates in their revolt against
Gad. As the devil is the sworn enemy of God's holy Church, St. Michael
is its special protector against his assaults and stratagems. This holy
archangel has ever been honored in the Christian Church as her guardian
under God, and as the protector of the faithful; for God is pleased to
employ the zeal and charity of the good angels and their leader against
the malice of the devil. To thank His adorable goodness for this benefit
of His merciful providence is this festival instituted by the Church in
honor of the good angels, in which devotion she has been encouraged by
several apparitions of this glorious archangel. Among others, it is
recorded that St. Michael, in a vision, admonished the Bishop of Siponto
to build a church in his honor on Mount Gargano, near Manfredonia, in
the kingdom of Naples. When the Emperor Otho III. had, contrary to his
word, put to death, for rebellion, Crescentius, a Roman senator, being
touched with remorse he cast himself at the feet of St. Romuald, who, in
satisfaction for his crime, enjoined him to walk barefoot, on a
penitential pilgrimage, to St. Michael's on Mount Gargano, which penance
he performed in 1002. It is mentioned in particular of this special
guardian and protector of the Church that, in the persecution of
Antichrist, he will powerfully stand up in her defence: "At that time
shall Michael rise up, the great prince, who standeth for the children
of thy people."

**Reflection**.—St. Michael is not only the protector of the Church, but
of every faithful soul. He defeated the devil by humility: we are
enlisted in the same warfare. His arms were humility and ardent love of
God: the same must be our weapons. We ought to regard this archangel as
our leader under God: and, courageously resisting the

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

devil in all his assaults, to cry out, Who can be compared to God?
