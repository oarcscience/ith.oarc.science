### February 23.—ST. PETER DAMIAN.

ST. PETER DAMIAN was born in 988, and lost both parents at an early age.
His eldest brother, in whose hands he was left, treated him so cruelly
that a younger brother, a priest, moved by his piteous state, sent him
to the University of Parma, where he acquired great distinction. His
studies were sanctified by vigils, fasts, and prayers, till at last,
thinking that all this was only serving God by halves, he resolved to
leave the world. He joined the monks at Font-Avellano, then in the
greatest repute, and by his wisdom and sanctity rose to be Superior. He
was employed on the most delicate and difficult missions, amongst others
the reform of ecclesiastical communities, which was effected by his
zeal. Seven Popes in succession made him their constant adviser, and he
was at last created Cardinal Bishop of Ostia. He withstood Henry IV. of
Germany, and labored in defence of Alexander II. against the Antipope,
whom he forced to yield and seek for pardon. He was charged, as Papal
Legate, with the repression of simony; again, was commissioned to settle
discords amongst various bishops, and finally, in 1072, to adjust the
affairs of the Church at Ravenna. He was laid low by a fever on his
homeward journey, and died at Faenza, in a monastery of his order, on
the eighth day of his sickness, whilst the monks chanted matins around
him.

**Reflection**.—The Saints studied, not in order to be accounted
learned, but to become perfect. This only is wisdom and true greatness,
to account ourselves as ignorant, and to adhere in all things to the
teachings and instincts of the Church.
