### ST. GABRIEL OF THE SORROWFUL MOTHER.

GABRIEL POSSENTI, born March 1, 1838, the eleventh of thirteen children,
was reared in a home that was none the less pious because cultured.
Inordinately vain and passionately devoted to the pleasures of the
world, it is little wonder that his teachers and companions were
incredulous when he announced that he would enter the Passionist Order
immediately upon his graduation.

His life in religion was one of love throughout—joyous love, made all
the sweeter by the penances prescribed by his rule, which he fulfilled
to the letter. There was nothing extraordinary about him except his
fidelity to prayer, his love of mortification and his joyfulness of
spirit. At the age of twenty-three, just as he was finishing his
studies, he was stricken with consumption, of which he died at Isola on
February 27, 1862. His feast is February 27.
