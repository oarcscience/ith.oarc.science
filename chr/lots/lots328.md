### October 22.—ST. MELLO, Bishop.—ST. HILARION, Abbot.

ST. MELLO is said to have been a native of Great Britain; his mal for
the Faith engaged him in the sacred ministry, and God having blessed his
labors with wonderful success, he was consecrated first bishop of Rouen
in Normandy, which see he is said to have held forty years.

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He died in peace,
about the beginning of the fourth century.

ST. HILARION was born of heathen parents, near Gaza, and was converted
while studying grammar in Alexandria. Shortly after, he visited St.
Antony, and, still only in his fifteenth year, he became a solitary in
the Arabian desert. A multitude of monks, attracted by his sanctity,
peopled the desert where he lived. In consequence of this, he fled from
one country to another, seeking to escape the praise of men; but
everywhere his miracles of mercy betrayed his presence. Even his last
retreat at Cyprus was broken by a paralytic, who was cured by St.
Hilarion, and then spread the fame of the Saint. He died with the words,
"Go forth, my soul; why dost thou doubt? Nigh seventy years hast thou
served God, and dost thou fear death?"
