### October 13.—ST. EDWARD THE CONFESSOR.

EDWARD was unexpectedly raised to the throne of England at the age of
forty years, twenty-seven of which he had passed in exile. On the
throne, the virtues of his earlier years, simplicity, gentleness,
lowliness, but above all his angelic purity, shone with new brightness.
By a rare inspiration of God, though he married to content his nobles
and people, he preserved perfect chastity in the wedded state. So little
did he set his heart on riches, that thrice when he saw a servant
robbing his treasury he let

him escape, saying the poor fellow needed the gold more than he. He
loved to stand at his palace-gate, speaking kindly to the poor beggars
and lepers who crowded about him, and many of whom he healed of their
diseases. The long wars had brought the kingdom to a sad state, but
Edward's zeal and sanctity soon wrought a great change. His reign of
twenty-four years was one of almost unbroken peace, the country grew
prosperous, the ruined churches rose under his hand, the weak lived
secure, and for ages afterwards men spoke with affection of the "laws of
good St. Edward." The holy king had a great devotion to building and
enriching churches. Westminster Abbey was his latest and noblest work.
He died January 5, 1066.

Reflection.—David longed to build a temple for God's service. Solomon
reckoned it his glory to accomplish the work. But we, who have God made
flesh dwelling in our tabernacles, ought to think no time, no zeal, no
treasures too much to devote to the splendor and beauty of a Christian
church.
