### October 3.—ST. GERARD, Abbot.

ST. GERARD was of a noble family of the county of Namur, France. An
engaging sweetness of temper, and a strong inclination to piety and
devotion, gained him from the cradle the esteem and affection of every
one. Having been sent on an important mission to the Court of France, he
was greatly edified at the fervor of the monks of St. Denis, at Paris,
and earnestly desired to consecrate himself to God with them. Returning
home he settled his temporal affairs, and went back with great joy to
St. Denis'. He had lived ten years with great fervor in this monastery,
when in 931 he was sent by his abbot to found an abbey upon his estate
at Brogue, three leagues from Namur. He settled this new abbey, and then
built himself a little cell near the church, and lived in it a recluse
until God called him to undertake the reformation of many monasteries,
which he did successfully. When he had spent almost twenty years in
these zealous labors, he shut himself up in his cell, to prepare his
soul to receive the

recompense of his labors, to which he was called on the 3d of October in
959.

**Reflection**.—Though we are in the world, let us strive to separate
ourselves from it and consecrate ourselves to God, remembering that "the
world passeth away, but he that doth the will of God abideth forever."
