### December 30.—ST. SABINUS, Bishop, and his Companions, Martyrs.

THE cruel edicts of Diocletian and Maximin against the Christians being
published in the year 303, Sabinus, Bishop of Assisium, and several of
his clergy, were apprehended and kept in custody till Venustianus, the
Governor

of Etruria and Umbria, came thither. Upon his arrival in that city he
caused the hands of Sabinus, who had made a glorious confession of his
Faith before him, to be cut off; and his two deacons, Marcellus and
Exuperantius, to be scourged, beaten with clubs, and torn with iron
nails, under which torments they both expired. Sabinus is said to have
cured a blind boy, and a weakness in the eyes of Venustianus himself,
who was thereupon converted, and afterward beheaded for the Faith.
Lucius, his successor, commanded Sabinus to be beaten to death with
clubs at Spoleto. The martyr was buried a mile from that city, but his
relics have been since translated to Faënza.

**Reflection**.—How powerfully do the martyrs cry out to us by their
example, exhorting us to despise a false and wicked world!
