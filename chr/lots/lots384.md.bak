### December 15.—ST. MESMIN.

ST. MESMIN was a native of Verdun. The inhabitants of that place having
proved disloyal to King Clovis, an uncle of our Saint's, a priest named
Euspice, brought about a reconciliation between the monarch and his
subjects. Clovis, appreciating the virtues of Euspice, persuaded him to
take up his residence at court, and the servant of God took St. Mesmin
along with him. While journeying to Orleans with Clovis he noticed at
about two leagues from the city, beyond the Loire, a solitary spot
called Micy, which he thought well suited for a retreat. Having asked
for and obtained the place, he with Mesmin and several disciples built
there a monastery, of which he took charge. At his death, which happened
about two years after, our Saint was appointed abbot by Eusebius, Bishop
of Orleans. During a terrible famine he fed nearly the whole city of
Orleans with wheat from his monastery, without perceptibly reducing it;
he also drove an enormous serpent out of the place in which he was
afterwards buried. Having governed his monastery ten years, he died as
he had lived, in the odor of sanctity, on the 15th of December, 520.

**Reflection**.—Few are called to serve God by great actions, but all
are bound to strive after perfection in the ordinary actions of their
daily life.
