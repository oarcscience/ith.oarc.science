### October 26.—ST. EVARISTUS, Pope and Martyr.

ST. EVARISTUS succeeded St. Anacletus in the see of Rome, in the reign
of Trajan, governed the Church nine years, and died in 112. The
institution of cardinal priests is by some ascribed to him, because he
first divided Rome into several titles or parishes, assigning a priest
to each; he also appointed seven deacons to attend the bishop. He
conferred holy orders thrice in the month of December, when that
ceremony was most usually performed, for holy orders were always
conferred in seasons appointed for fasting and prayer. St. Evaristus was
buried near St. Peter's tomb on the Vatican.

**Reflection**.—The disciples of the apostles, by assiduous meditation
on heavenly things, were so swallowed up in the life to come, that they
seemed no longer inhabitants of this world. If Christians esteem and set
their hearts on earthly goods, and lose sight of eternity in the course
of their actions, they are no longer animated by the spirit of the
primitive Saints, and are become children of this world, slaves to its
vanities, and to their own irregular passions. If we do not correct this
disorder of our hearts, and conform our interior to the spirit of
Christ, we cannot be entitled to His promises.
