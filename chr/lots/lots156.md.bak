### May 15.—STS. PETER and DIONYSIA.

IN the Decian persecution the blood of the Christians flowed at
Lampsacus, a city of Asia Minor. St. Peter was the first who was led
before the proconsul and condemned to die for the name of Christ. Young
though he was, he went joyfully to his torments. He was bound to a wheel
by iron chains, and his bones were broken, but he raised his eyes to
heaven with a smiling countenance and said, "I give Thee thanks, O Lord
Jesus Christ, because Thou hast given me patience, and made me
victorious

over the tyrant." The proconsul saw how little suffering availed, and
ordered the martyr to be beheaded. But a little later, in the same city,
the virgin Dionysia showed a like eagerness to suffer. St. Dionysia
gained the crown which an apostate lost, and his history may teach us
that those who lose Christ rather than suffer with Him lose all. With
the strength that was left he cried out, "I never was a Christian. I
sacrifice to the gods." Therefore he was taken down, and he offered
sacrifice. But he was possessed by the devil, whom he had chosen for his
master. He fell to the earth in a fit, bit out his tongue, and so
expired. He escaped a little pain, and instead he went to the endless
torments of hell, and forfeited eternal rest. "O wretched man!" Dionysia
cried, "why have you feared a little suffering and chosen eternal pain
instead?" She was seized and led away to horrible outrage, but her angel
guardian appeared by her side and protected the spouse of Christ.
Escaping from prison, she still burned with the desire to be dissolved
and to be with Christ. She threw herself upon the bodies of the martyrs,
saying, "I would fain die with you on earth, that I may live with you in
heaven." And Christ, Who is the crown of virgins and the strength of
martyrs, gave her the desire of her heart.

**Reflection**.—The martyrs were even like us, with natures which shrank
from suffering. They were patient under it because they looked to the
eternal recompense, and endured as seeing Him Who is invisible.
