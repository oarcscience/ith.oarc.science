### February 24.—ST. MATTHIAS, Apostle.

AFTER our blessed Lord's Ascension His disciples met together, with Mary
His mother and the eleven apostles, in an upper room at Jerusalem. The
little company numbered no more than one hundred and twenty souls. They
were waiting for the promised coining of the Holy Ghost, and they
persevered in prayer. Meanwhile there was a solemn act to be performed
on the part of the Church, which could not be postponed. The place of
the fallen Judas must be filled up, that the elect number of the
apostles might be complete. St. Peter, therefore, as Vicar of Christ,
arose to announce the divine decree. That which the Holy Ghost had
spoken by the mouth of David concerning Judas, he said, must be
fulfilled. Of him it had been written, "His bishopric let another take."
A choice, therefore, was to be made of one among those who had been
their companions from the beginning, who could bear witness to the
Resurrection of Jesus. Two were named of equal merit, Joseph called
Barsabas, and Matthias. Then, after praying to God, Who knows the hearts
of all men, to show which of these He had chosen, they cast lots, and
the lot fell upon Matthias, who was forthwith numbered with the
apostles. It is recorded of the Saint, thus wonderfully

elected to so high a vocation, that he was above all remarkable for his
mortification of the flesh. It was thus that he made his election sure.

**Reflection**.—Our ignorance of many points in St. Matthias's life
serves to fix the attention all the more firmly upon these two—the
occasion of his call to the apostolate, and the fact of his
perseverance. We then naturally turn in thought to our own vocation and
our own end.
