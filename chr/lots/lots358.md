### November 19.—ST. ELIZABETH OF HUNGARY.

ELIZABETH was daughter of a king of Hungary, and niece of St. Hedwige.
She was betrothed in infancy to Louis, Landgrave of Thuringia, and
brought up in his father's court. Not content with receiving daily
numbers of poor in her palace, and relieving all in distress, she built
several hospitals, where she served the sick, dressing the most
repulsive sores with her own hands. Once as she was carrying in the
folds of her mantle some provisions for the poor, she met her husband
returning from the chase. Astonished to see her bending under the weight
of her burden, he opened the mantle which she kept pressed against her,
and found in it nothing but beautiful red and white roses, although it
was not the season for flowers. Bidding her pursue her way, he took one
of the marvellous

roses, and kept it all his life. On her husband's death she was cruelly
driven from her palace, and forced to wander through the streets with
her little children, a prey to hunger and cold; but she welcomed all her
sufferings, and continued to be the mother of the poor, converting many
by her holy life. She died in 1231, at the age of twenty-four.

**Reflection**.—This young and delicate princess made herself the
servant and nurse of the poor. Let her example teach us to disregard the
opinions of the world and to overcome our natural repugnances, in order
to serve Christ in the persons of His poor.
