### September 25.—ST. FIRMIN, Bishop, Martyr.—ST. FINBARR, Bishop.

ST. FIRMIN was a native of Pampelone in Navarre,  initiated in the
Christian faith by Honestus, a disciple of St. Saturninus of Toulouse,
and consecrated bishop by St. Honoratus, successor to St. Saturninus, in
order to preach the Gospel in the remoter parts of Gaul. He preached the
Faith in the countries of Agen, Anjou, and Beauvais, and being arrived
at Amiens, there chose his residence, and founded there a numerous
church of faithful disciples. He received the crown of martyrdom in that
city, whether under the prefect Rictius Varus, or in some other
persecution from Decius, in 250, to Diocletian, in 303, is uncertain.

ST. FINBARR, who lived in the sixth century, was a native of Connaught,
and instituted a monastery or school at

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lough Eire, to
which such numbers of disciples flocked, as changed, as it were, a
desert into a large city. This was the origin of the city of Cork, which
was built chiefly upon stakes, in marshy little islands formed by the
river Lea. The right name of our Saint, under which he was baptized, was
Lochan; the surname Finbarr, or Barr the White, was afterward given him.
He was Bishop of Cork seventeen years, and died in the midst of his
friends at Cloyne, fifteen miles from Cork. His body was buried in his
own cathedral at Cork, and his relics, some years after, were put in a
silver shrine, and kept there, this great church bearing his name to
this day. St. Finbarr's cave or hermitage was shown in a monastery which
seems to have been begun by our Saint, and stood to the west of Cork.
