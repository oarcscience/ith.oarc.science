### October 9.—ST. DIONYSIUS and his Companions, Martyrs.—ST. LOUIS BERTRAND.

OF all the Roman missionaries sent into Gaul, St. Dionysius carried the
Faith the furthest into the country, fixing his see at Paris, and by him
and his disciples the sees of Chartres, Senlis, Meaux, and Cologne were
erected in the fourth century. During the persecution of Valerian he was
arrested and thrown into prison, and after remaining there for some time
was beheaded, together with St. Rusticus, a priest, and Eleutherius, a
deacon.

ST. LOUIS BERTRAND was born at Valencia, in Spain, in 1526, of the same
family as St. Vincent Ferrer. In 1545, after severe trials, he was
professed in the Dominican Order, and at the age of twenty-five was made
master of novices, and trained up many great servants of God. When the
plague broke out in Valencia he devoted himself to the sick and dying,
and with his own hands buried the dead. In 1562 he obtained leave to
embark for the American mission, and there converted vast multitudes to
the Faith. He was favored with the gift of miracles, and while preaching
in his native Spanish was understood in various languages. After seven
years he returned to Spain, to plead the cause of the oppressed Indians,
but he was not permitted to return and labor among them. He spent his
remaining days toiling in his own country, till at length, in 1580, he
was carried from the pulpit in the Cathedral at Valencia to the bed from
whence he never rose. He died on the day he had foretold—October 9,
1581.

**Reflection**.—The Saints fasted, toiled, and wept, not only for love
of God, but for fear of damnation. How shall we, with our self-indulgent
lives and unexamined consciences, face the judgment-seat of Christ?
