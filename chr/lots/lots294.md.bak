### September 18.—ST. THOMAS OF VILLANOVA.

ST. THOMAS, the glory of the Spanish Church in the sixteenth century,
was born in 1488. A thirst for the science of the Saints led him to
enter the house of the Austin Friars at Salamanca. Charles V. listened
to him an oracle, and appointed him Archbishop of Valencia. On being led
to his throne in church, he pushed the silken cushions aside, and with
tears kissed the ground. His first visit was to the prison; the sum with
which the chapter presented him for his palace was devoted to the public
hospital. As a child he had given his meal to the poor, and two thirds
of his episcopal revenues were now annually spent in alms. He daily fed
five hundred needy persons, brought up himself the orphans of the city,
and sheltered the neglected foundlings with a mother's care. During his
eleven years’ episcopate not one poor maiden was married without an alms
from the Saint. Spurred by his example, the rich and the selfish became
liberal and generous; and when, on the Nativity of Our Lady, 1555, St.
Thomas came to die, he was well-nigh the only poor man in his see.

**Reflection**.—"Answer me, O sinner!" St. Thomas would say, "what can
you purchase with your money better or more necessary than the
redemption of your sins?"
