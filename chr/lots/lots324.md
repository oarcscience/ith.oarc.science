### October 18.—ST. LUKE.

ST. LUKE, a physician at Antioch, and a painter, became a convert of St.
Paul, and afterwards his fellow-laborer. He is best known to us as the
historian of the New Testament. Though not an eye-witness of Our Lord's
life, the Evangelist diligently gathered information from the lips of
the apostles, and wrote, as he tells us, all things in order. The acts
of the Apostles were written by this Evangelist as a sequel to his
Gospel, bringing the history .of the Church down to the first
imprisonment of St. Paul at Rome. The humble historian never names
himself, but by his occasional use of "we" for "they" we are able to
detect his presence in the scenes which he describes. We thus find that
he sailed with St. Paul and Silas from Troas to Macedonia; stayed behind
apparently for seven years at Philippi, and, lastly, shared the
shipwreck and perils of the memorable voyage to Rome. Here his own
narrative ends, but from St. Paul's Epistles we learn that St. Luke was
his faithful companion to the end. He died a martyr's death some time
afterwards in Achaia.

**Reflection**.—Christ has given all He had for thee; do thou give all
thou hast for Him.
