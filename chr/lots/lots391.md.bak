### December 22.—ST. ISCHYRION, Martyr.

ISCHYRION was an inferior officer who attended on a magistrate of a
certain city in Egypt. His master commanded him to offer sacrifice to
the idols; and because he refused to commit that sacrilege, reproached
him with the most abusive and threatening speeches. By giving way to
passion and superstition, the officer at length worked himself up to
such a degree of frenzy as to run a stake into the bowels of the meek
servant of Christ, who, by his patient constancy, attained to the glory
of martyrdom.

**Reflection**.—It is not a man's condition, but virtue, that can make
him truly great or truly happy. How mean soever a person's station or
circumstances may be, the road to both is open to him; and there is not
a servant or slave who ought not to be enkindled with a laudable
ambition of arriving at this greatness, which will set him on the same
level with the rich and the most powerful.
