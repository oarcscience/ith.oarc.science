### November 15.—ST. GERTRUDE, Abbess.

GERTRUDE was born in the year 1263, of a noble Saxon family, and placed
at the age of five for education in the Benedictine abbey of Rodelsdorf.
Her strong mind was carefully cultivated, and she wrote Latin with
unusual elegance and force; above all, she was perfect in humility and
mortification, in obedience, and in all monastic observances. Her life
was crowded with wonders. She has in obedience recorded some of her
visions, in which she traces in words of indescribable beauty the
intimate converse of her soul with Jesus and Mary. She was gentle to
all, most gentle to sinners; filled with devotion to the Saints of God,
to the souls in purgatory, and above all to the Passion of Our Lord and
to His Sacred Heart. She ruled her abbey with perfect wisdom and love
for forty years. Her life was one of great and almost continual
suffering, and her longing to be with Jesus was not granted till 1334,
when she had reached her seventy-second year.

**Reflection**.—No preparation for death can be better than to offer and
resign ourselves anew to the Divine Will—humbly, lovingly, with
unbounded confidence in the infinite mercy and goodness of God.
