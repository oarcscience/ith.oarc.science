### ST. TERESA OF THE INFANT JESUS

MARIE-FRANCOISE-THERESE MARTIN, known as "The Little Flower of Jesus,"
was born at Alençon. France, on January 2nd, 1873. Reared in a home of
comfort and surrounded by refinements that would have spoiled an
ordinary child, Teresa's intelligence had an early dawning which enabled
her to comprehend the Divine Goodness far in advance of her tender
years. Our Lord visited upon the child a severe trial—a strange malady
from which there seemed no recovery. Her implicit confidence in God,
however, overcame her infirmity and she progressed rapidly toward
sanctity.

Teresa adopted flowers as the symbol of her love for her Divine Saviour
and offered her practices in virtue, sacrifice, and mortification as
flowers at the feet of Jesus.

At fifteen she entered the Carmelite Convent at Lisieux, France, where
she distinguished herself by punctual observance of the rule, burning
love for God and wonderful trust in Him.

Before she died, this "lily of delicious perfume"—as Pope Pius X. called
her—revealed to the superiors her life story in pages of rarest beauty.

She died in the odor of sanctity on September 30th, 1897, at the age of
24. Since her death countless graces have been attributed to her
intercession. Pope Benedict XV. in 1921 opened the way for the process
of her beatification and she was declared *Blessed* by Pope Pius XI. on
April 29, 1923, and was canonized on May 17, 1925.
