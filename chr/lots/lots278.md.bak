### September 4.—ST. ROSALIA, Virgin.

ST. ROSALIA was daughter of a noble family descended from Charlemagne.
She was born at Palermo in Sicily, and despising in her youth worldly
vanities, made herself an abode in a cave on Mount Pelegrino, three
miles from Palermo, where she completed the sacrifice of her heart to
God by austere penance and manual labor, sanctified by assiduous prayer
and the constant union of her soul with God. She died in 1160. Her body
was found buried in a grot under the mountain, in the year of the
jubilee, 1625, under Pope Urban VIII., and was translated into the
metropolitan church of Palermo, of which she was chosen a patroness. To
her patronage that island ascribes the ceasing of a grievous pestilence
at the same time.

ST. ROSE OF VITERBO, who is honored on this same day, was born in the
spring of 1240, a time when Frederick II, was oppressing the Church and
many were faithless to the Holy See. The infant at once seemed filled
with grace; with tottering steps she sought Jesus in His tabernacle, she
knelt before sacred images, she listened to pious talk, retaining all
she heard, and this when she was scarcely three years old. One coarse
habit covered her flesh; fasts and disciplines were her delight. To
defend the Church's rights was her burning wish, and for this she
received her mission from the Mother of God, who gave her the Franciscan
habit, with the command to go forth and preach. When hardly ten years
old, Rose went down to the public square at Viterbo, called upon the
inhabitants to be faithful to the Sovereign Pontiff, and vehemently
denounced all his opponents. So great was the power of her word, and of
the miracles which accompanied it, that the Imperial party, in fear and
anger, drove her from the city, but she continued to preach till
Innocent IV. was brought back in triumph to Rome and the cause of God
was won. Then she retired to a little cell at Viterbo, and prepared in
solitude for her

end. She died in her eighteenth year. Not long after, she appeared in
glory to Alexander IV., and bade him translate her body. He found it as
the vision had said, but fragrant and beautiful, as if still in life.

**Reflection**.—Rose lived but seventeen years, saved the Church's
cause, and died a Saint. We have lived, perhaps, much longer, and yet
with what result? Every minute something can be done for God. Let us be
up and doing.
