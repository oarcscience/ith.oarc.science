### July 24.—ST. CHRISTINA, Virgin and Martyr.

ST. CHRISTINA was the daughter of a rich and powerful magistrate named
Urbain. Her father, who was deep in the practices of heathenism, had a
number of golden idols, which our Saint destroyed, and distributed the
pieces among the poor. Infuriated by this act, Urbain became the
persecutor of his daughter; he had her whipped with rods and then thrown
into a dungeon. Christina remained unshaken in her faith. Her tormentor
then had her body torn by iron hooks, and fastened her to a rack beneath
which a fire was kindled. But God watched over His servant and turned
the flames upon the lookers-on. Christina was next seized, a heavy stone
tied about her neck, and she was thrown into the lake of Bolsena, but
she was saved by an angel, and outlived her father, who died of spite.
Later, this martyr suffered the most inhuman torments under the judge
who succeeded her father, and finally was thrown into a burning furnace,
where she remained,

unhurt, for five days. By the power of Christ she overcame the serpents
among which she was thrown; then her tongue was cut out, and afterwards,
being pierced with arrows, she gained the martyr's crown at Tyro, a city
which formerly stood on an island in the lake of Bolsena in Italy, but
was long since swallowed up by the waters. Her relics are now at Palermo
in Sicily.
