### September 24.—THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY OF MERCY.

ST. PETER, of the noble family of Nolasco, was born in Languedoc, about
1189. At the age of twenty-five he took a vow of chastity, and made over
his vast estates to the Church. Some time after, he conceived the idea
of establishing an order for the redemption of captives. The

divine will was soon manifested. The Blessed Virgin appeared on the same
night to Peter, to Raymund of Pennafort, his confessor, and to James,
King of Arragon, his ward, and bade them prosecute without fear their
holy designs. After great opposition, the Order was solemnly
established, and approved by Gregory IX., under the name of *Our Lady of
Mercy*. By the grace of God, and under the protection of His Virgin
Mother, the Order spread rapidly, its growth being increased by the
charity and piety of its members, who devoted themselves not only to
collecting alms for the ransom of the Christians, but even gave
themselves up to voluntary slavery to aid the good work. It is to return
thanks to God and the Blessed Virgin that a feast was instituted which
was observed in the Order of Mercy, then in Spain and France, and at
last extended to the whole Church by Innocent XII., and the 24th
September named as the day on which it is to be observed.

**Reflection**.—St. Peter Nolasco and his knights were laymen, not
priests, and yet they considered the salvation of their neighbor
intrusted to them. We can each of us by counsel, by prayer, but above
all by holy example, assist the salvation of our brethren, and thus
secure our own.
