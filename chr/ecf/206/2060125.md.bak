<span id="v.CXIV-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.CXIV-p1.1"></span>Letter CXIV. To Theophilus.</span>

<span id="v.CXIV-p2"></span>Jerome writes to Theophilus to apologize for
his delay in sending Latin versions of the latter’s letter (CXIII.) and
invective against John Chrysostom. Possibly, however, the allusion may
be not to these but to some other work of Theophilus (e.g. a paschal
letter.) This delay he attributes to the disturbed state of Palestine,
the severity of the winter, the prevalent famine, and his own
ill-health. He now sends the translations that he has made and, while he
deprecates criticism on his own work, praises that of Theophilus,
quoting with particular approval the directions given by this latter for
the reverent care of the vessels used in celebrating the holy communion.
The date of the letter is 405 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.CXIV-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.CXIV-p3"></span>To the most blessed pope Theophilus, Jerome.

<span id="v.CXIV-p4"></span>1. My delay in sending back to your holiness
your treatise translated into Latin is accounted for by the many
interruptions and obstacles that I have met with. There has been a
sudden raid of the Isaurians; Phœnicia and Galilee have been laid waste;
Palestine has been panic-stricken, and particularly Jerusalem; we have
all been engaged in making not books but walls. There has also been a
severe winter and an almost unbearable famine; and these have told
heavily upon me who have the charge of many brothers. Amid <span
id="page_215">p. 215</span> <span id="v.CXIV-Page_215"></span>these
difficulties the work of translation went on by night, as I could save
or snatch time to give to it. At last I got it done and by Lent nothing
remained but to collate the fair copy with the original. However, just
then a severe illness seized me and I was brought to the threshold of
death, from which I have only been saved by God’s mercy and your
prayers; perhaps for this very purpose that I might fulfil your behest
and render with its writer’s elegance the charming volume which you have
adorned with the scripture’s fairest flowers. But bodily weakness and
sorrow of heart have, I need hardly say, dulled the edge of my intellect
and obstructed the free flow of my language.

<span id="v.CXIV-p5"></span>2. I admire in your work its practical aim,
designed as it is to instruct by the authority of scripture ignorant
persons in all the churches concerning the reverence with which they
must handle holy things and minister at Christ’s altar; and to impress
upon them that the sacred chalices, veils, <span
id="fr_3054"></span>[3055](#fn_3054.md) and other accessories used in the
celebration of the Lord’s passion are not mere lifeless and senseless
objects devoid of holiness, but that rather, from their association with
the body and blood of the Lord, they are to be venerated with the same
awe as the body and the blood themselves.

<span id="v.CXIV-p7"></span>3. Take back then your book, nay mine or
better still ours; for when you flatter me you will but flatter
yourself. It is for you that my brain has toiled; it is for you that I
have striven with the poor resources of the Latin tongue to find an
equivalent for the eloquence of the Greek. I have not indeed given a
word-for-word rendering, as skilled translators do, nor have I counted
out the money you have given to me coin by coin; but I have given you
full weight. Some words may be missing but none of the sense is lost.
Moreover I have translated into Latin and prefixed to this volume the
letter that you sent to me, so that all who read it may know that I have
acted under the commands of your holiness, and have not rashly and
over-confidently undertaken a task that is beyond my powers. Whether I
have succeeded in it I must leave to your judgment. Even though you may
blame my weakness, you will at least give me credit for my good
intention.
