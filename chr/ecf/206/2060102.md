<span id="v.XCI-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XCI-p1.1"></span>Letter XCI. From Epiphanius to Jerome.</span>

<span id="v.XCI-p2"></span>An exultant letter from Epiphanius in which
he describes the success of his council (convened at the suggestion of
Theophilus), sends Jerome a copy of its synodical letter. and urges him
to go on with his work of translating into Latin documents bearing on
the Origenistic controversy. Written in 400 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XCI-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.XCI-p3"></span>To his most loving lord, son, and brother,
<span id="page_185">p. 185</span> <span id="v.XCI-Page_185"></span>the
presbyter Jerome, Epiphanius sends greeting in the Lord. The general
epistle written <span id="fr_2634"></span>[2635](#fn_2634.md) to all
Catholics belongs particularly to you; for you, having a zeal for the
faith against all heresies, particularly oppose the disciples of Origen
and of Apollinaris whose poisoned roots and deeply planted impiety
almighty God has dragged forth into our midst, that having been
unearthed at Alexandria they might wither throughout the world. For
know, my beloved son, that Amalek has been destroyed root and branch and
that the trophy of the cross has been set up on the hill of
Rephidim. <span id="fr_2635"></span>[2636](#fn_2635.md) For as when the
hands of Moses were held up on high Israel prevailed, so the Lord has
strengthened His servant Theophilus to plant His standard against Origen
on the altar of the church of Alexandria; that in him might be fulfilled
the words: “Write this for a memorial, for I will utterly put out
Origen’s heresy from under heaven together with that Amalek himself.”
And that I may not appear to be repeating the same things over and over
and thus to be making my letter tedious, I send you the actual missive
written to me that you may know what Theophilus has said to me, and what
a great blessing the Lord has granted to my last days in approving the
principles which I have always proclaimed by the testimony of so great a
prelate. I fancy that by this time you also have published something and
that, as I suggested in my former letter to you on this subject, you
have elaborated a treatise for readers of your own language. For I hear
that certain of those who have made shipwreck <span
id="fr_2636"></span>[2637](#fn_2636.md) have come also to the West, and
that, not content with their own destruction, they desire to involve
others in death with them; as if they thought that the multitude of
sinners lessens the guilt of sin and the flames of Gehenna do not grow
in size in proportion as more logs are heaped upon them. With you and by
you we send our best greetings to the reverend brothers who are with you
in the monastery serving God.
