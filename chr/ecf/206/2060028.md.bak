<span id="v.XVII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XVII-p1.1"></span>Letter XVII. To the Presbyter Marcus.</span>

<span id="v.XVII-p2"></span>In this letter, addressed to one who seems
to have had some pre-eminence among the monks of the Chalcidian desert,
Jerome complains of the hard treatment meted out to him because of his
refusal to take any part in the great theological dispute then raging in
Syria. He protests his own orthodoxy, and begs permission to remain
where he is until the return of spring, when he will retire from “the
inhospitable desert.” Written in <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XVII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 378 or 379.

<span id="v.XVII-p3"></span>1. I had made up my mind to use the words of
the psalmist: “While the wicked <span id="page_21">p. 21</span> <span
id="v.XVII-Page_21"></span>was before me I was dumb with silence; I was
humbled, and I held my peace even from good” <span
id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309.md) and “I, as a deaf man, heard not; and
I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. Thus I was as a man that
heareth not.” <span id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310.md) But charity
overcomes all things, <span id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311.md) and my
regard for you defeats my determination. I am, indeed, less careful to
retaliate upon my assailants than to comply with your request. For among
Christians, as one has said, <span id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md) not
he who endures an outrage is unhappy, but he who commits it.

<span id="v.XVII-p8"></span>2. And first, before I speak to you of my
belief (which you know full well), I am forced to cry out against the
inhumanity of this country. A hackneyed quotation best expresses my
meaning:

<span id="v.XVII-p9"></span>What savages are these who will not grant

<span id="v.XVII-p10"></span>A rest to strangers, even on their sands!

<span id="v.XVII-p11"></span>They threaten war and drive us from their
coasts. <span id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md)

<span id="v.XVII-p13"></span>I take this from a Gentile poet that one
who disregards the peace of Christ may at least learn its meaning from a
heathen. I am called a heretic, although I preach the consubstantial
trinity. I am accused of the Sabellian impiety although I proclaim with
unwearied voice that in the Godhead there are three distinct, <span
id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314.md) real, whole, and perfect persons. The
Arians do right to accuse me, but the orthodox forfeit their orthodoxy
when they assail a faith like mine. They may, if they like, condemn me
as a heretic; but if they do they must also condemn Egypt and the West,
Damasus and Peter. <span id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315.md) Why do they
fasten the guilt on one and leave his companions uncensured? If there is
but little water in the stream, it is the fault, not of the channel, but
of the source. I blush to say it, but from the caves which serve us for
cells we monks of the desert condemn the world. Rolling in sack-cloth
and ashes, <span id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316.md) we pass sentence on
bishops. What use is the robe of a penitent if it covers the pride of a
king? Chains, squalor, and long hair are by right tokens of sorrow, and
not ensigns of royalty. I merely ask leave to remain silent. Why do they
torment a man who does not deserve their ill-will? I am a heretic, you
say. What is it to you if I am? Stay quiet, and all is said. You are
afraid, I suppose, that, with my fluent knowledge of Syriac and Greek, I
shall make a tour of the churches, lead the people into error, and form
a schism! I have robbed no man of anything; neither have I taken what I
have not earned. With my own hand <span
id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317.md) daily and in the sweat of my
brow <span id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318.md) I labor for my food,
knowing that it is written by the apostle: “If any will not work,
neither shall he eat.” <span id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319.md)

<span id="v.XVII-p20"></span>3. Reverend and holy father, Jesus is my
witness with what groans and tears I have written all this. “I have kept
silence, saith the Lord, but shall I always keep silence? Surely
not.” <span id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320.md) I cannot have so much as a
corner of the desert. Every day I am asked for my confession of faith;
as though when I was regenerated in baptism I had made none. I accept
their formulas, but they are still dissatisfied. I sign my name to them,
but they still refuse to believe me. One thing only will content them,
that I should leave the country. I am on the point of departure. They
have already torn away from me my dear brothers, who are a part of my
very life. They are, as you see, anxious to depart—nay, they are
actually departing; it is preferable, they say, to live among wild
beasts rather than with Christians such as these. I myself, too, would
be at this moment a fugitive were I not withheld by physical infirmity
and by the severity of the winter. I ask to be allowed the shelter of
the desert for a few months till spring returns; or if this seems too
long a delay, I am ready to depart now. “The earth is the Lord’s and the
fulness thereof.” <span id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321.md) Let them climb
up to heaven alone; <span id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322.md) for them
alone Christ died; they possess all things and glory in all. Be it so.
“But God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the
world.” <span id="fr_323"></span>[324](#fn_323.md)

<span id="v.XVII-p25"></span>4. As regards the questions which you have
thought fit to put to me concerning the faith, I have given to the
reverend Cyril <span id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324.md) a written
confession which sufficiently answers them. He who does not so believe
has no part in Christ. My faith is attested both by your ears and by
those of your blessed brother, Zenobius, to whom, as well as to
yourself, we all of us here send our best greeting.
