<p> <a name="v.CXXIV"></A>
<p class="c30"><a name="v.CXXIV-p1"></A>  <span class="c1"><a name="v.CXXIV-p1.1"></A>Letter CXXIV. To Avitus.</span></p>  
<p class="c16"><a name="v.CXXIV-p2"></A>Avitus to whom this letter is addressed is probably the same person who induced Jerome to write to Salvina (see Letter LXXIX., &sect;I, ante). The occasion of writing is as follows. Ten years previously (that is to say in <span class="c17"><a name="v.CXXIV-p2.1"></A>a.d.</span> 399 or 400) Pammachius had asked Jerome to supply him with a correct version of Origen&#146;s <i>First Principles</i> to enable him to detect the variations introduced by Rufinus into his rendering. This Jerome willingly did (see Letters LXXXIII. and LXXXIV.) but when the work in its integrity was perused by Pammachius he thought it so erroneous in doctrine that he determined not to circulate it. However, &#8220;a certain brother&#8221; induced him to lend the <span class="c17"><a name="v.CXXIV-p2.2"></A>ms.</span> to him for a short time; and then, when he had got it into his hands, had a hasty and incorrect transcript made, which he forthwith published much to the chagrin of Pammachius. Falling into the hands of Avitus a copy of this much perplexed him and he seems to have appealed to Jerome for an explanation. This the latter now gives forwarding at the same time an authentic edition of his version of the <i>First Principles</i>. The date of the letter is <span class="c17"><a name="v.CXXIV-p2.3"></A>a.d.</span> 409 or 410.</p>  
<p class="c16"><a name="v.CXXIV-p3"></A>1. About ten years ago that saintly man Pammachius sent me a copy of a certain person&#146;s rendering,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3353"></A><A HREF="#fn_3353"><FONT SIZE="1">3354</FONT></A>
 or rather misrendering, of Origen&#146;s <i>First Principles;</i> with a request that in a Latin version I should give the true sense of the Greek and should set down the writer&#146;s words for good or for evil without bias in either direction.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3354"></A><A HREF="#fn_3354"><FONT SIZE="1">3355</FONT></A>
 When I did as he wished and sent him the book,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3355"></A><A HREF="#fn_3355"><FONT SIZE="1">3356</FONT></A>
 he was shocked to read it and locked it up in his desk lest being circulated it might wound the souls of many. However, a certain brother, who had &#8220;a zeal for God but not according to knowledge,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3356"></A><A HREF="#fn_3356"><FONT SIZE="1">3357</FONT></A>
 asked for a loan of the manuscript that he might read it; and, as he promised to return it without delay, Pammachius, thinking no harm could happen in so short a time, unsuspectingly consented. Hereupon he who had borrowed the book to read, with the aid of scribes copied the whole of it and gave it back much sooner than he had promised. Then with the same rashness or&#8212;to use a less severe term&#8212;thoughtlessness he made bad worse by confiding to others what he had thus stolen. Moreover, since a bulky treatise on an abstruse subject is difficult to reproduce with accuracy, especially if it has to be taken down surreptitiously and in a hurry, order and sense were sacrificed in several passages. Whence it comes, my dear Avitus, that you ask me to send you a copy of my version as made for Pammachius and not for the public, a garbled edition of which has been published by the aforesaid brother.</p>  
<p><a name="v.CXXIV-p8"></A>2. Take then what you have asked for; but know that there are countless things in the book to be abhorred, and that, as the Lord says, you will have to walk among scorpions and serpents.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3357"></A><A HREF="#fn_3357"><FONT SIZE="1">3358</FONT></A>
 It begins by saying that Christ was made God&#146;s son not born;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3358"></A><A HREF="#fn_3358"><FONT SIZE="1">3359</FONT></A>
 that God the Father, as He is by nature invisible, is invisible even to the Son;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3359"></A><A HREF="#fn_3359"><FONT SIZE="1">3360</FONT></A>
 that the Son, who is the likeness of the invisible Father, compared with the Father is not the truth but compared with us who cannot receive the truth of the almighty Father seems a figure of the truth so that we perceive the majesty and magnitude of the greater in the less, the Father&#146;s glory limited in the Son;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3360"></A><A HREF="#fn_3360"><FONT SIZE="1">3361</FONT></A>
 that God the Father is a light incomprehensible and that Christ compared with him is but a minute brightness, although by reason of our incapacity to us he appears a great one.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3361"></A><A HREF="#fn_3361"><FONT SIZE="1">3362</FONT></A>
 The Father and the Son are compared to two statues, a larger one and a small; the first filling the world and being somehow invisible through its size, the second cognisable by the eyes of men.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3362"></A><A HREF="#fn_3362"><FONT SIZE="1">3363</FONT></A>
 God the Father omnipotent the writer terms good and of perfect goodness; but of the Son he says: &#8220;He is not good but an emanation and likeness of goodness; not good absolutely but only with a qualification, as &#145;the good shepherd&#146; and the like.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3363"></A><A HREF="#fn_3363"><FONT SIZE="1">3364</FONT></A>
 The Holy Spirit he places after the Father and the Son as third in dignity and honour. And while he de<A NAME="page_239"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 239</FONT></A> <a name="v.CXXIV-Page_239"></A>clares that he does not know whether the Holy Spirit is created or uncreated,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3364"></A><A HREF="#fn_3364"><FONT SIZE="1">3365</FONT></A>
 he has later on given his own opinion that except God the Father alone there is nothing uncreated. &#8220;The Son,&#8221; he states, &#8220;is inferior to the Father, inasmuch as He is second and the Father first; and the Holy Spirit which dwells in all the saints is inferior to the Son. In the same way the power of the Father is greater than that of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Likewise the power of the Son is greater than that of the Holy Spirit, and as a consequence the Holy Spirit in its turn has greater virtue than other things called holy.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3365"></A><A HREF="#fn_3365"><FONT SIZE="1">3366</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="v.CXXIV-p18"></A>3. Then, when he comes to deal with rational creatures and to describe their lapse into earthly bodies as due to their own negligence, he goes on to say: &#8220;Surely it argues great negligence and sloth for a soul so far to empty itself as to fall into sin and allow itself to be tied to the material body of an unreasoning brute;&#8221; and in a subsequent passage: &#8220;These reasonings induce me to suppose that it is by their own free act that some are numbered with God&#146;s saints and servants, and that it was through their own fault that others fell from holiness into such negligence that they were changed into forces of an opposite kind.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3366"></A><A HREF="#fn_3366"><FONT SIZE="1">3367</FONT></A>
 He maintains that after every end a fresh beginning springs forth and an end from each beginning, and that wholesale variation is possible; so that one who is now a human being may in another world become a demon, while one who by reason of his negligence is now a demon may hereafter be placed in a more material body and thus become a human being.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3367"></A><A HREF="#fn_3367"><FONT SIZE="1">3368</FONT></A>
 So far does he carry this transforming process that on his theory an archangel may become the devil and the devil in turn be changed back into an archangel. &#8220;Such as have wavered or faltered but have not altogether fallen shall be made subject, for rule and government and guidance, to better things&#8212;to principalities and powers, to thrones and dominations&#8221;; and of these perhaps another human race will be formed, when in the words of Isaiah there shall be &#8220;new heavens and a new earth.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3368"></A><A HREF="#fn_3368"><FONT SIZE="1">3369</FONT></A>
 But such as have not deserved to return through humanity to their former estate shall become the devil and his angels, demons of the worst sort; and according to what they have done shall have special duties assigned to them in particular worlds.&#8221; Moreover, the very demons and rulers of darkness in any world or worlds, if they are willing to turn to better things, may become human beings and so come back to their first beginning. That is to say, after they have borne the discipline of punishment and torture for a longer or a shorter time in human bodies, they may again reach the angelic pinnacles from which they have fallen. Hence it may be shewn that we men may change into any other reasonable beings, and that not once only or on emergency but time after time; we and angels shall become demons if we neglect our duty; and demons, if they will take to themselves virtues, may attain to the rank of angels.</p>  
<p><a name="v.CXXIV-p22"></A>4. Bodily substances too are to pass away utterly or else at the end of all things will become highly rarified like the sky and &aelig;ther and other subtle bodies. It is clear that these principles must affect the writer&#146;s view of the resurrection. The sun also and the moon and the rest of the constellations are alive. Nay more; as we men by reason of our sins are enveloped in bodies material and sluggish; so the lights of heaven have for like reasons received bodies more or less luminous, and demons have been for more serious faults clothed with starry frames. This, he argues, is the view of the apostle who writes:&#8212;&#8220;the creation has been subjected to vanity and shall be delivered for the revealing of the sons of God.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3369"></A><A HREF="#fn_3369"><FONT SIZE="1">3370</FONT></A>
 That it may not be supposed that I am imputing to him ideas of my own I shall give his actual words. &#8220;At the end and consummation of the world,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;when souls and beings endowed with reason shall be released from prison by the Lord, they will move slowly or fly quickly according as they have previously been slothful or energetic. And as all of them have free will and are free to choose virtue or vice, those who choose the latter will be much worse off than they now are. But those who choose the former will improve their condition. Their movements and decisions in this direction or in that will determine their various futures; whether, that is, angels are to become men or demons, and whether demons are to become men or angels.&#8221; Then after adducing various arguments in support of his thesis and maintaining that while not incapable of virtue the devil has yet not chosen to be virtuous, he has finally reasoned with much diffuseness that an angel, a human soul, and a demon&#8212;all according to him of one nature but of different wills&#8212;may in punishment for great negligence or folly be transformed into brutes. Moreover, to avoid the agony of punishment and the burning flame the more sensitive may choose to become low organisms, to dwell in water, to assume the shape of this or that animal; so that we have reason to fear a metamorphosis not only into four-footed things but even into fishes. Then, <A NAME="page_240"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 240</FONT></A> <a name="v.CXXIV-Page_240"></A>lest he should be held guilty of maintaining with Pythagoras the transmigration of souls, he winds up the wicked reasoning with which he has wounded his reader by saying: &#8220;I must not be taken to make dogmas of these things; they are only thrown out as conjectures to shew that they are not altogether overlooked.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="v.CXXIV-p24"></A>5. In his second book he maintains a plurality of worlds; not, however, as Epicurus taught, many like ones existing at once, but a new one beginning each time that the old comes to an end. There was a world before this world of ours, and after it there will be first one and then another and so on in regular succession. He is in doubt whether one world shall be so completely similar to another as to leave no room for any difference between them, or whether one world shall never wholly be indistinguishable from another. And again a little farther on he writes: &#8220;if, as the course of the discussion makes necessary, all things can live without body, all bodily existence shall be swallowed up and that which once has been made out of nothing shall again be reduced to nothing. And yet a time will come when its use will be once more necessary.&#8221; And in the same context: &#8220;but if, as reason and the authority of scripture shew, this corruptible shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality, death shall be swallowed up in victory and corruption in incorruption.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3370"></A><A HREF="#fn_3370"><FONT SIZE="1">3371</FONT></A>
 And it may be that all bodily existence shall be removed, for it is only in this that death can operate.&#8221; And a little farther on: &#8220;if these things are not contrary to the faith, it may be that we shall some day live in a disembodied state. Moreover, if only he is fully subject to Christ who is disembodied, and if all must be made subject to Him, we too shall lose our bodies when we become fully subject to Him.&#8221; And in the same passage: &#8220;if all are to be made subject to God, all shall lay aside their bodies; and then all bodily existence shall be brought to nought. But if through the fall of reasonable beings it is a second time required it will reappear. For God has left souls to strive and struggle, to teach them that full and complete victory is to be attained not by their own efforts but by His grace. And so to my mind worlds vary with the sins which cause them, and those are exploded theories which maintain that all worlds are alike.&#8221; And again: &#8220;three conjectures occur to me with regard to the end; it is for the reader to determine which is nearest to the truth. For either we shall be bodiless when being made subject to Christ we shall be made subject to God and He shall be all in all; or as things made subject to Christ shall be with Christ Himself made subject to God and brought under one law, so all substance shall be refined into its most perfect form and rarified into &aelig;ther which is a pure and uncompounded essence; or else the sphere which I have called motionless and all that it contains will be dissolved into nothing, and the sphere in which the antizone&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3371"></A><A HREF="#fn_3371"><FONT SIZE="1">3372</FONT></A>
 itself is contained shall be called &#145;good ground,&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3372"></A><A HREF="#fn_3372"><FONT SIZE="1">3373</FONT></A>
 and that other sphere which in its revolution surrounds the earth and goes by the name of heaven shall be reserved for the abode of the saints.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="v.CXXIV-p28"></A>6. In speaking thus does he not most clearly follow the error of the heathen and foist upon the simple faith of Christians the ravings of philosophy? In the same book he writes: &#8220;it remains that God is invisible. But if He is by nature invisible, He must be so even to the Saviour.&#8221; And lower down: &#8220;no soul which has descended into a human body has borne upon it so true an impress of its previous character as Christ&#146;s soul of which He says: &#145;no man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.&#146;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3373"></A><A HREF="#fn_3373"><FONT SIZE="1">3374</FONT></A>
 And in another place: &#8220;we must carefully consider whether souls, when they have won salvation and have attained to the blessed life, may not cease to be souls. For as the Lord and Saviour came to seek and to save that which was lost&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3374"></A><A HREF="#fn_3374"><FONT SIZE="1">3375</FONT></A>
 that it might cease to be lost; so the lost soul which the Lord came to save, when saved, will cease to be a soul. We must ask ourselves whether, as the lost was not lost once and again will not be, the soul likewise may have been and again may be not a soul.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3375"></A><A HREF="#fn_3375"><FONT SIZE="1">3376</FONT></A>
 And after a good many remarks upon the soul he brings in the following, &#8220;<span class="Greek"><a name="v.CXXIV-p31.1"></A>&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> or&#8221; intelligence by falling becomes a soul; and by acquiring virtue this will become intelligence again. This at least is a fair inference from the case of Esau who for his old sins is condemned to lead a lower life. And concerning the heavenly bodies we must make a similar acknowledgment. The soul of the sun&#8212;or whatever else you like to call it&#8212;does not date its existence from the creation of the world; it already existed before it entered its shining and glowing body. So also with the moon and stars. From antecedent causes they have been made subject to vanity not willingly but for future reward,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3376"></A><A HREF="#fn_3376"><FONT SIZE="1">3377</FONT></A>
 and are forced to do not their own will but the creator&#146;s who has assigned to them their several spheres.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="v.CXXIV-p33"></A>7. Hellfire, moreover, and the torments with <A NAME="page_241"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 241</FONT></A> <a name="v.CXXIV-Page_241"></A>which holy scripture threatens sinners he explains not as external punishments but as the pangs of guilty consciences when by God&#146;s power the memory of our transgressions is set before our eyes. &#8220;The whole crop of our sins grows up afresh from seeds which remain in the soul, and all our dishonourable and undutiful acts are again pictured before our gaze. Thus it is the fire of conscience and the stings of remorse which torture the mind as it looks back on former self-indulgence.&#8221; And again: &#8220;but perhaps this coarse and earthly body ought to be described as mist and darkness; for at the end of this world and when it becomes necessary to pass into another, the like darkness will lead to the like physical birth.&#8221; In speaking thus he clearly pleads for the transmigration of souls as taught by Pythagoras and Plato.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3377"></A><A HREF="#fn_3377"><FONT SIZE="1">3378</FONT></A>
 And at the end of the second book in dealing with our perfection he has said: &#8220;when we shall have made such progress as not only to cease to be flesh or body but perhaps also to cease to be souls our perfect intelligence and perception, undimmed with any mist of passion, will discern reasonable and intelligible substances face to face.</p>  
<p><a name="v.CXXIV-p35"></A>8. In the third book the following faulty statements are contained. &#8220;If we once admit that, when one vessel is made to honour and another to dishonour,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3378"></A><A HREF="#fn_3378"><FONT SIZE="1">3379</FONT></A>
 this is due to antecedent causes; why may we not revert to the mystery of the soul and allow that it is loved in one and hated in another because of its past actions, before in Jacob it becomes a supplanter and before in Esau it is supplanted?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3379"></A><A HREF="#fn_3379"><FONT SIZE="1">3380</FONT></A>
 And again: &#8220;the fact that souls are made some to honour and some to dishonour is to be explained by their previous history.&#8221; And in the same place: &#8220;on this hypothesis of mine a vessel made to honour which fails to fulfil its object will in another world become a vessel made to dishonour; and contrariwise a vessel which has from a previous fault been condemned to dishonour will, if it accepts correction in this present life, become in the new creation a vessel &#145;sanctified and meet for the Master&#146;s use and prepared unto every good work.&#146;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3380"></A><A HREF="#fn_3380"><FONT SIZE="1">3381</FONT></A>
 And he immediately goes on to say: &#8220;I believe that men who begin with small faults may become so hardened in wickedness that, if they do not repent and turn to better things, they must become inhuman energies;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3381"></A><A HREF="#fn_3381"><FONT SIZE="1">3382</FONT></A>
 and contrariwise that hostile and demonic beings may in course of time so far heal their wounds and check the current of their former sins that they may attain to the abode of the perfect. As I have often said, in those countless and unceasing worlds in which the soul lives and has its being some grow worse and worse until they reach the lowest depths of degradation; while others in those lowest depths grow better and better until they reach the perfection of virtue.&#8221; Thus he tries to shew that men, or rather their souls, may become demons; and that demons in turn may be restored to the rank of angels. In the same book he writes: &#8220;this too must be considered; why the human soul is diversely acted upon now by influences of one kind and now by influences of another.&#8221; And he surmises that this is due to conduct which has preceded birth. It is for this, he argues, that John leaps in his mother&#146;s womb when at Mary&#146;s salutation Elizabeth declares herself unworthy of her notice.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3382"></A><A HREF="#fn_3382"><FONT SIZE="1">3383</FONT></A>
 And he immediately subjoins: &#8220;on the other hand infants that are hardly weaned are possessed with evil spirits and become diviners and soothsayers;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3383"></A><A HREF="#fn_3383"><FONT SIZE="1">3384</FONT></A>
 indeed, some are indwelt from their earliest years with the spirit of a python. Now as they have done nothing to bring upon themselves these visitations, one who holds that nothing happens without God&#146;s permission, and that all things are governed by His justice, cannot suppose that God&#146;s providence has abandoned them without good reason.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="v.CXXIV-p42"></A>9. Again, of the world he writes thus: &#8220;The belief commends itself to me that there was a world before this world and that after it there will be another. Do you wish to know that after the decay of this world there will be a new one? Hear the words of Isaiah: &#145;the new heavens and the new earth which I will make shall remain before me.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3384"></A><A HREF="#fn_3384"><FONT SIZE="1">3385</FONT></A>
 Do you wish to know that before the making of this world there have previously been others? Listen to the Preacher who says: &#145;the thing which hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. Is there anything whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3385"></A><A HREF="#fn_3385"><FONT SIZE="1">3386</FONT></A>
 A passage which proves not only that other worlds have been but that other worlds shall be; not, however, simultaneously and side by side but one after another.&#8221; And he immediately adds: &#8220;I hold that heaven is the abode of the deity, the true place of rest; and that it was there that reasonable creatures enjoyed their ancient bliss, before coming down to a lower plane and exchanging the invisible for the visible, they fell to the earth and came to need material bodies. Now that they have fallen, God the creator has made for them bodies suitable to their surroundings; and has fashioned this visible world, and has sent into it ministers to ensure the salva<A NAME="page_242"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 242</FONT></A> <a name="v.CXXIV-Page_242"></A>tion and correction of the fallen. Of these ministers some have held assigned positions and have been subject to the world&#146;s necessary laws; while others have intelligently performed duties laid upon them in times and seasons determined by God&#146;s plan. To the former class belong the sun, moon, and stars called by the apostle &#145;the creation;&#146; and these have had allotted to them the heights of heaven. Now the creation is subjected to vanity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3386"></A><A HREF="#fn_3386"><FONT SIZE="1">3387</FONT></A>
 because it is encased in material bodies and visible to the eye. And yet it is &#145;made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope.&#146; Others again of the second class, at particular places and times known to their Maker only, we believe to be His angels sent to steer the world.&#8221; A little farther on he says: &#8220;the affairs of the world are so ordered by Providence that while some angels fall from heaven others freely glide down to earth. The former are hurled down against their will; the latter descend from choice alone. The former are forced to continue in a distasteful service for a fixed period; the latter spontaneously embrace the task of lending a hand to those who fall.&#8221; Again he writes: &#8220;whence it follows that these different movements result in the creation of different worlds; and that this world of ours will be succeeded by one quite unlike it. Now, as regards this falling and rising, this rewarding of virtue and punishment of vice, whether they take place in the past, present, or future, God, the creator, can alone apportion desert and make all things converge to one end. For He only knows why He allows some to follow their own inclination and to descend from the higher planes to the lowest; and why He visits others and giving them His hand draws them back to their former state and places them once more in heaven.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="v.CXXIV-p46"></A>10. In discussing the end of the world he has made use of the following language. &#8220;Since, as I have often said, a new beginning springs from the end, it may be asked whether bodies will then continue to exist, or whether, when they have been annihilated, we shall live without bodies and be incorporeal as we know God to be. Now there can be no doubt but that, if bodies or, as the apostle calls them, visible things, belong only to our sensible world, the life of the disembodied will be incorporeal.&#8221; And a little farther on: &#8220;when the apostle writes, &#145;the creation shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God,&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3387"></A><A HREF="#fn_3387"><FONT SIZE="1">3388</FONT></A>
 I explain his words thus. Reasonable and incorporeal beings are the highest of God&#146;s creatures, for not being clothed with bodies they are not the slaves of corruption. Since where there are bodies, there corruption is sure to be found. But hereafter &#145;the creation shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption,&#146; and then men shall receive the glory of the children of God and God shall be all in all.&#8221; And in the same passage he writes: &#8220;that the final state will be an incorporeal one is rendered credible by the words of our Saviour&#146;s prayer: &#145;as thou, Father, art in me and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3388"></A><A HREF="#fn_3388"><FONT SIZE="1">3389</FONT></A>
 For we ought to realize what God is and what the Saviour will finally be, and how the likeness to the Father and the Son here promised to the Saints consists in this that as They are one in Themselves so we shall be one in Them. For if in the end the life of the Saints is to be assimilated to the life of God, we must either admit that the Lord of the universe is clothed with a body and that he is enveloped in matter as we are in flesh; or, if it is unbecoming to suppose this, especially in persons who have but small clues from which to infer God&#146;s majesty and to guess at the glory of His innate and transcendent nature, we are reduced to the following dilemma. Either we shall always have bodies and in that case must despair of ever being like God; or, if the blessedness of the life of God is really promised to us, the conditions of His life must be the conditions of ours.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="v.CXXIV-p49"></A>11. These passages prove what his view is regarding the resurrection. For he evidently maintains that all bodies will perish and that we shall be incorporeal as according to him we were before we received our present bodies. Again when he comes to argue for a variety of worlds and to maintain that angels will become demons, demons either angels or men, and men in their turn demons; in a word that everything will be turned into something else, he thus sums up his own opinion: &#8220;no doubt, after an interval matter will exist afresh and bodies will be formed and a different world will be created to meet the varying wills of reasonable beings who, having forfeited the perfect bliss which continues to the end, have gradually fallen into so great wickedness as to change their nature and refuse to keep their first estate of unalloyed blessedness. Many reasonable beings, it is right to say, keep it until a second, a third, and a fourth world, and give God no ground for changing their condition. Others deteriorate so little that they seem to have lost hardly anything, and others again have to be hurled headlong into the abyss. God who orders all things alone knows how to use each class according to its <A NAME="page_243"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 243</FONT></A> <a name="v.CXXIV-Page_243"></A>deserts in a suitable sphere; for He only understands opportunities and motives and the course in which the world must be steered. Thus one who has borne away the palm for wickedness and has sunk into the lowest degradation will in the world which is hereafter to be fashioned be made a devil, a kind of first fruits of the Lord&#146;s handiwork, to be a laughing stock to the angels who have lost their first virtue.&#8221; What is this but to argue that the sinful men of this world may become a devil and demons in another; and contrariwise that those who are now demons may hereafter become either men or angels? And after a lengthy discussion in which he maintains that all corporeal creatures must exchange their material for subtle and spiritual bodies and that all substance must become one pure and inconceivably bright body, of which the human mind can at present form no conception, he winds up thus:&#8212;&#8220;&#145;God shall be all in all;&#146; that is to say, all bodily existence shall be made as perfect as possible; it shall be brought into the divine essence, than which there is none better.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="v.CXXIV-p50"></A>12. In the fourth and last book of his work the following passages deserve the church&#146;s condemnation. &#8220;It may be that as, when men die in this world by the separation of soul and body, they are allotted different positions in hell according to the difference in their works; so when angels die, out of the system of the heavenly Jerusalem, they come down to this world as a hell and are placed on earth according to their deserts.&#8221; And again: &#8220;as we have compared the souls which pass from this world to hell with those which as they come from heaven to us are in a manner dead; so we must carefully inquire whether this is true of all souls without exception. For in that case souls born on earth when they desire better things rise out of hell and assume human bodies or when they desire worse things come down to us from better worlds; and in the firmament above us likewise there are souls on their way from our world to higher ones, and others who, while they have fallen from heaven, have not sinned so grievously as to be thrust down to earth.&#8221; He thus tries to prove that the firmament, that is the sky, is hell compared with heaven; and that this earth is hell compared with the firmament; and again that our world is heaven to hell. Or in other words what is hell to some is heaven to others. And not content with saying this he goes on: &#8220;at the end of all things when we shall return to the heavenly Jerusalem the hostile powers shall declare war&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3389"></A><A HREF="#fn_3389"><FONT SIZE="1">3390</FONT></A>
 against the people of God to breathe and exercise their valour and strengthen their resolve. For this they cannot have until they have faced and foiled their foes; of whom we read in the book of Numbers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3390"></A><A HREF="#fn_3390"><FONT SIZE="1">3391</FONT></A>
 that they are overcome by reason, discipline, and tactical skill.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="v.CXXIV-p53"></A>13. After saying that according to the apocalypse of John &#8220;the everlasting gospel&#8221; which shall be revealed in heaven&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3391"></A><A HREF="#fn_3391"><FONT SIZE="1">3392</FONT></A>
 as much surpasses our gospel as Christ&#146;s preaching does the sacraments&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3392"></A><A HREF="#fn_3392"><FONT SIZE="1">3393</FONT></A>
 of the ancient law, he has asserted what it is sacrilegious even to think; that Christ will once more suffer in the sky for the salvation of demons. And although he has not expressly said it, it is yet implied in his words that as for men God became man to set men free, so for the salvation of demons when He comes to deliver them He will become a demon. To shew that this is no gloss of mine, I must give his own words: &#8220;As Christ,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;has fulfilled the shadow of the law by the shadow of the gospel, and as all law is a pattern and shadow of things done in heaven, we must inquire whether we are justified in supposing that even the heavenly law and the rites of the celestial worship are still incomplete and need the true gospel which in the apocalypse of John is called everlasting to distinguish it from ours which is only temporal, set forth in a world that shall pass away. Now if we extend our inquiry to the passion of our Lord and Saviour, it may indeed be overbold to suppose that He will suffer in heaven; yet if there is spiritual wickedness in heavenly places&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3393"></A><A HREF="#fn_3393"><FONT SIZE="1">3394</FONT></A>
 and if we confess without a blush that the Lord has once been crucified to destroy those things which He has destroyed by His passion; why need we fear to imagine a like occurrence in the upper world in the fulness of time, so that the nations of all realms shall be saved by a passion of Christ?&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="v.CXXIV-p57"></A>14. Here is another blasphemy which he has spoken of the Son. &#8220;Assuming that the Son knows the Father, it would seem that by this knowledge He can comprehend Him as much as a craftsman can comprehend the rules of his art. And, doubtless, if the Father is in the Son, He is also comprehended by Him in whom He is. But if we mean by comprehension not merely that the knower takes a thing in by perception and insight but that he contains it within himself by virtue of a special faculty; in this sense we cannot say that the Son comprehends the Father. For the Father comprehends all things, and of these the Son is one; therefore, He comprehends the Son.&#8221; And to shew us reasons why, while the Father <A NAME="page_244"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 244</FONT></A> <a name="v.CXXIV-Page_244"></A>comprehends the Son, the Son cannot comprehend the Father, he adds: &#8220;the curious reader may inquire whether the Father knows Himself in the same way that the Son knows Him. But if he recalls the words: &#145;the Father who sent me is greater than I,&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3394"></A><A HREF="#fn_3394"><FONT SIZE="1">3395</FONT></A>
 he will allow that they must be universally true and will admit that, in knowledge as in everything else, the Father is greater than the Son, and knows Himself more perfectly and immediately than the Son can do.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="v.CXXIV-p59"></A>15. The following passage is a convincing proof that he holds the transmigration of souls and annihilation of bodies. &#8220;If it can be shewn that an incorporeal and reasonable being has life in itself independently of the body and that it is worse off in the body than out of it; then beyond a doubt bodies are only of secondary importance and arise from time to time to meet the varying conditions of reasonable creatures. Those who require bodies are clothed with them, and contrariwise, when fallen souls have lifted themselves up to better things, their bodies are once more annihilated. They are thus ever vanishing and ever reappearing.&#8221; And to prevent us from minimizing the impiety of his previous utterances he ends his work by maintaining that all reasonable beings, that is, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, angels, powers, dominations, and virtues, and even man by right of his soul&#146;s dignity, are of one and the same essence. &#8220;God,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;and His only-begotten Son and the Holy Spirit are conscious of an intellectual and reasonable nature. But so also are the angels, the powers, and the virtues, as well as the inward man who is created in the image and after the likeness of God.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3395"></A><A HREF="#fn_3395"><FONT SIZE="1">3396</FONT></A>
 From which I conclude that God and they are in some sort of one essence.&#8221; He adds &#8220;in some sort&#8221; to escape the charge of blasphemy; and while in another place he will not allow the Son and the Holy Spirit to be of one substance with the Father lest by so doing he should appear to make the divine essence divisible, he here bestows the nature of God almighty upon angels and men.</p>  
<p><a name="v.CXXIV-p61"></A>16. This being the nature of Origen&#146;s book, is it anything short of madness to change a few blasphemous passages regarding the Son and the Holy Spirit and then to publish the rest unchanged with an unprincipled eulogy when the parts unaltered as well as the parts altered flow from the same fountain head of gross impiety? This is not the time to confute all the statements made in detail; and indeed those who have written against Arius, Eunomius, Manich&aelig;us, and various other heretics must be supposed to have answered these blasphemies as well. If anyone, therefore, wishes to read the work let him walk with his feet shod towards the land of promise; let him guard against the jaws of the serpent and the crooked jaws of the scorpion; let him read this treatise first and before he enters upon the path let him know the dangers which he will have to avoid.</p>
