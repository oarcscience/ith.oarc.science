<span id="vii.iv.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Jeremiah.</span>

<span id="vii.iv.ix-p2"></span>The Commentary on Jeremiah is in six
books; but Jerome did not live to finish it. It was written between the
years 317 and 319, but only extends to chapter xxxii. It was dedicated
to Eusebius of Cremona. The Prefaces, which are full of vigour, contain
many allusions to the events and controversies of the last years of
Jerome’s life. In the Preface to Book i., after speaking of the Book of
Daniel and the apocryphal Letter of Jeremiah as not belonging to the
prophet’s writings, he continues:

<span id="vii.iv.ix-p3"></span>I pay little heed to the ravings of
disparaging critics who revile not only my words, but the very syllables
of my words, and suppose they give evidence of some little knowledge if
they discredit another man’s work, as was exemplified in that <span
id="fr_5428"></span>[5429](#fn_5428.md) ignorant traducer who lately broke
out, and thought it worth his while to censure my commentaries on Paul’s
Epistle to the Ephesians. He does not understand the rules of commenting
(for he is more asleep than awake and seems utterly dazed), and is not
aware that in our books we give the opinions of many different writers,
the authors’ names being either expressed or understood, so that it is
open to the reader to decide which he may prefer to adopt; although I
must add that, in my Preface to the First Book of that work, I gave fair
notice that my remarks would be partly my own, partly those of other
commentators, and that thus the commentary would be the work conjointly
of the ancient writers and of myself. <span
id="fr_5429"></span>[5430](#fn_5429.md) Grunnius, his precursor, overlooked
the same fact, and once upon a time did his best to cavil. I replied to
him in two books, and there I cleared away the objections which he
adduced in his own name, though the real traducer was some one else; to
say nothing of my treatises against Jovinianus where, you may remember,
I show that he (Jovinianus) laments that virginity is preferred to
marriage, single marriage to digamy, digamy to polygamy. The stupid
fool, <span id="fr_5430"></span>[5431](#fn_5430.md) labouring under his
load of Scotch porridge, does not recollect that we said, in that very
work, “I do not condemn the twice married, nor the thrice married, and,
if it so be, the eight times married; I will go a step farther, and say
that I welcome even a penitent whoremonger; for things equally lawful
must be weighed in an even balance.” Let him read the Apology <span
id="fr_5431"></span>[5432](#fn_5431.md) for the same work which was
directed against his <span id="fr_5432"></span>[5433](#fn_5432.md) master,
and was received by Rome with acclamation many years ago. He will then
observe that his revilings are but the echoes of other men’s voices, and
that his ignorance is so deep that even his abuse is not his own, but
that he employs against us the ravings of foes long since dead and
buried.

<span id="vii.iv.ix-p9"></span>The Preface to Book ii. is short and
contains nothing of special importance. In that to Book iii. Jerome
declares that he will, like Ulysses with the Sirens, close his ears to
the adversary. The devil, who once spoke through Jovinianus, “now barks
through the hound of Albion (Pelagius), who is like a mountain of fat,
and whose fury is more in his heels than in his teeth; for his offspring
is among the Scots, in the neighbourhood of Britain; and, according to
the fables of the poet, he must, like Cerberus, be smitten to death with
a spiritual club, that, in company with his master Pluto, he may forever
hold his peace.”

<span id="vii.iv.ix-p10"></span>In the Preface to Book iv. Jerome says
he has been hindered in his work by the harassing of the Pelagian
controversy. He regards Pelagius as reproducing the doctrines of
impassibility and sinlessness taught by Pythagoras and Zeno, and revived
by Origen, Rufinus, Evagrius Ponticus, and Jovinian. Their doctrines, he
says, were promulgated chiefly in Sicily, Rhodes, and other islands;
they were propagated secretly, and denied in public. They were full of
malice, but were but dumb dogs, and were refuted in “certain writings,”
probably those of Augustin; but he declares his intention of writing
against them, which he did in his anti-Pelagian Dialogue.

<span id="vii.iv.ix-p11"></span>*The Prefaces to Books v. and vi.
contain nothing noteworthy.*

<span id="vii.iv.ix-p5"></span> That is, Rufinus. See Preface to Book
xii. of Isaiah, where Rufinus is called Grunnius Corocotta Porcellus,
and Preface to Book iv. of Jeremiah.

<span id="vii.iv.ix-p6"></span> Scotorum pultibus prægravatus. The words
have been translated “made fat with Scotch flummery” (Stillingfleet).
Another rendering is, “having his belly filled and his head bedulled
with Scotch porridge” (Wall on Infant Baptism, pt. i. c. 19, § 3). Some
think the words refer to Celestius, Pelagius’ supporter.

<span id="vii.iv.ix-p7"></span> The letter to Pammachius (Jer. Letter
XLVIII.) in defence of the book against Jovinianus.

id="vii.iv.ix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.ix-p8"></span> Jovinian was condemned in a Synod at
Rome about 390. Thirty years had thus passed since the events occurred
to which Jerome refers. See Preface to the treatise against Jovinian.
