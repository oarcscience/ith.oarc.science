<span id="v.XXIV-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XXIV-p1.1"></span>Letter XXIV. To Marcella.</span>

<span id="v.XXIV-p2"></span>Concerning the virgin Asella. Dedicated to
God before her birth, Marcella’s sister had been made a church-virgin at
the age of ten. From that time she had lived a life of the severest
asceticism, first as a member and then as the head of Marcella’s
community upon the Aventine. Jerome, who subsequently wrote her a letter
(XLV) on his departure from Rome, now holds her up as a model to be
admired and imitated. Written at Rome <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XXIV-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 384.

<span id="v.XXIV-p3"></span>1. Let no one blame my letters for the
eulogies and censures which are contained in them. To arraign sinners is
to admonish those in like case, and to praise the virtuous is to quicken
the zeal of those who wish to do right. The day before yesterday I spoke
to you concerning Lea of blessed memory, <span
id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696.md) and I had hardly done so, when I was
pricked in my conscience. It would be wrong for me, I thought, to ignore
a virgin after speaking of one who, as a widow, held a lower place.
Accordingly, in my present letter, I mean to give you a brief sketch of
the life of our dear Asella. Please do not read it to her; for she is
sure to be displeased with eulogies of which she is herself the object.
Show it rather to the young girls of your acquaintance, that they may
guide themselves by her example, and may take her behavior as the
pattern of a perfect life.

<span id="v.XXIV-p5"></span>2. I pass over the facts that, before her
birth, she was blessed while still in her mother’s womb, and that,
virgin-like, she was delivered to her father in a dream in a bowl of
shining glass brighter than a mirror. And I say nothing of her
consecration to the blessed life of virginity, a ceremony which took
place when she was hardly more than ten years old, a mere babe still
wrapped in swaddling clothes. For all that comes before works should be
counted of grace; <span id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697.md) although,
doubtless, God foreknew the future when He sanc<span id="page_43">p.
43</span> <span id="v.XXIV-Page_43"></span>tified Jeremiah as yet
unborn, <span id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698.md) when He made John to
leap in his mother’s womb, <span id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699.md) and
when, before the foundation of the world, He set apart Paul to preach
the gospel of His son. <span id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700.md)

<span id="v.XXIV-p10"></span>3. I come now to the life which after her
twelfth year she, by her own exertion, chose, laid hold of, held fast
to, entered upon, and fulfilled. Shut up in her narrow cell she roamed
through paradise. Fasting was her recreation and hunger her refreshment.
If she took food it was not from love of eating, but because of bodily
exhaustion; and the bread and salt and cold water to which she
restricted herself sharpened her appetite more than they appeased it.

<span id="v.XXIV-p11"></span>But I have almost forgotten to mention that
of which I should have spoken first. When her resolution was still fresh
she took her gold necklace made in the lamprey pattern (so called
because bars of metal are linked together so as to form a flexible
chain), and sold it without her parents’ knowledge. Then putting on a
dark dress such as her mother had never been willing that she should
wear, she concluded her pious enterprise by consecrating herself
forthwith to the Lord. She thus showed her relatives that they need hope
to wring no farther concessions from one who, by her very dress, had
condemned the world.

<span id="v.XXIV-p12"></span>4. To go on with my story, her ways were
quiet and she lived in great privacy. In fact, she rarely went abroad or
spoke to a man. More wonderful still, much as she loved her virgin
sister, <span id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701.md) she did not care to see
her. She worked with her own hands, for she knew that it was written:
“If any will not work neither shall he eat.” <span
id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702.md) To the Bridegroom she spoke constantly
in prayer and psalmody. She hurried to the martyrs’ shrines unnoticed.
Such visits gave her pleasure, and the more so because she was never
recognized. All the year round she observed a continual fast, remaining
without food for two or three days at a time; but when Lent came she
hoisted—if I may so speak—every stitch of canvas and fasted well-nigh
from week’s end to week’s end with “a cheerful countenance.” <span
id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703.md) What would perhaps be incredible, were
it not that “with God all things are possible,” <span
id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704.md) is that she lived this life until her
fiftieth year without weakening her digestion or bringing on herself the
pain of colic. Lying on the dry ground did not affect her limbs, and the
rough sackcloth that she wore failed to make her skin either foul or
rough. With a sound body and a still sounder soul <span
id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705.md) she sought all her delight in
solitude, and found for herself a monkish hermitage in the centre of
busy Rome.

<span id="v.XXIV-p18"></span>5. You are better acquainted with all this
than I am, and the few details that I have given I have learned from
you. So intimate are you with Asella that you have seen, with your own
eyes, her holy knees hardened like those of a camel from the frequency
of her prayers. I merely set forth what I can glean from you. She is
alike pleasant in her serious moods and serious in her pleasant ones:
her manner, while winning, is always grave, and while grave is always
winning. Her pale face indicates continence but does not betoken
ostentation. Her speech is silent and her silence is speech. Her pace is
neither too fast nor too slow. Her demeanor is always the same. She
disregards refinement and is careless about her dress. When she does
attend to it it is without attending. So entirely consistent has her
life been that here in Rome, the centre of vain shows, wanton license,
and idle pleasure, where to be humble is to be held spiritless, the good
praise her conduct and the bad do not venture to impugn it. Let widows
and virgins imitate her, let wedded wives make much of her, let sinful
women fear her, and let bishops <span id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706.md)
look up to her.
