<span id="iv.II-p2"></span>The references in this Section, where numbers
alone are given, are to the date A. D.

<span id="iv.II-p3"></span>It seems desirable to prefix to this
Introduction some account of the times of St. Jerome. General and
ecclesiastical history must not be kept too far apart.

<span id="iv.II-p4"></span>Jerome was born in the troubled times which
followed the death of Constantine (337), and before Constantius became
sole Emperor (353). He was still a schoolboy during the reign of Julian
(361–63), and when he heard of his death. During his student life at
Rome, Jovian and Valentinian were Emperors, and at Treves, where he next
sojourned, the latter Emperor held his court. His first letter refers to
a scene in which Ambrose, then Prefect of Liguria, seems to have taken
part (370), and his settlement at Aquileia synchronises with the law of
Valentinian restraining legacies to the clergy (370). He went to the
East in the year of the death of Athanasius (373), and during his stay
in the desert and at Antioch (374-80) occurred the death of Valentinian,
the defeat and death of his brother Valens in the battle of Adrianople,
the elevation of Theodosius to the purple, and the call of Gregory
Nazianzen to Constantinople. He was ordained by Paulinus, one of the
three Bishops of Antioch, and studied under Apollinaris, thus touching
on both the chief points for which the Council of Constantinople was
called (381). At that Council he was probably present, being, as stated
above, a disciple of its president, Gregory Nazianzen. He was present
also at the Western Council held the next year in Rome under Pope
Damasus, whose trusted counsellor he became (pp. 233, 255). His later
life, spent at Bethlehem (386–420), witnessed the division of the <span
id="page_xii">p. xii</span> <span id="iv.II-Page_xii"></span>Empire
between the sons of Theodosius, the fall of the Prefect Rufinus (p.
174), to whom Jerome had been denounced, the triumph of Stilicho and his
death (at which he weakly rejoiced, p. 237), Alaric’s sack of Rome (410)
and his death, the revolt of Heraclian, the marriage of Alaric’s
successor, Adolphus, with the Emperor’s sister, Galla Placidia, and the
death of Arcadius (408); in ecclesiastical matters, it witnessed the
rise of Chrysostom (398) and his exile (403) and death (407), the
condemnation of Origenism (400), and the Pelagian controversy (415). It
is of this period that we are now to give a sketch.

<span id="iv.II-p5"></span>The Emperor Constantius “may be dismissed,”
says Gibbon, “with the remark that he inherited the defects without the
abilities of his father.” He died in Cilicia on November 3, 361; he had
been stained in his youth by the blood of nine of his near relatives; he
had fallen early under the dominion of the eunuchs of his palace; and he
had done little for the defence of the empire. In ecclesiastical matters
he had favoured the Arian cause, and had banished the orthodox Bishops
of the principal sees, and had visited Athanasius of Alexandria with his
especial displeasure. His jealousy of his cousin Julian, who had risen
to fame by his just and vigorous administration and by his victories
over the Germans, led him into acts which provoked the legions of Gaul
and caused them to hail Julian as their Emperor. His overtures of peace
were rejected by Constantius; he marched rapidly toward Constantinople,
and Constantius, leaving the Persian war in which he was engaged, turned
westward to meet him. The death of Constantius saved the world from
civil war.

<span id="iv.II-p6"></span>Julian’s accession was hailed by all who felt
the need of a strong ruler; and his first measures were just and
tolerant. He recalled from exile the Bishops whom Constantius had
banished; his private life was virtuous, and his love of learning
endeared him to some of the best of his subjects. But his contempt of
Christianity made him first impatient and then a persecutor. He forbade
Christians, or Galileans as he called them, to teach in the schools, or
to follow the learned professions; he restored Paganism, though it was
observed that the Paganism he introduced was in many ways modified by
Christian influence; and he favoured the Jews and wished them to rebuild
their temple at Jerusalem. What the result of his retrogressive policy
would have been it is hard to say. He died in a skirmish in the Persian
war, on June 26, 363.

<span id="iv.II-p7"></span>Jovian, who succeeded him, was a Christian;
and his election showed that the anti- Christian policy of Julian had
been without effect. He proclaimed a complete toleration, but died
before reaching Constantinople, only six months after his election.

<span id="iv.II-p8"></span>Valentinian, his successor, was an orthodox
Christian, his brother Valens, whom he associated with himself, an
Arian. Valentinian established his court at Treves, and successfully
kept back the barbarians. Thither in 366 Jerome went for a time, and he
describes the curious customs of the tribes whom he saw there (Against
Jovinian, ii. 7, p. 394). The Emperors proclaimed toleration, which
extended even to the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries. But their
inquisitorial and cruel treatment of all suspected of magic arts had a
repressive effect upon learning. Their foundation of schools and
endowment of physicians for the poorer citizens show that the hopes of
social improvement were not extinguished. Yet the state of society in
Rome and in other large cities, as given at this time by Ammianus
Marcellinus (cxiv. 6, xxviii. 4. See Gibbon, iv. 77. Ed. Milman &
Smith), reveals to us the causes of the fall of Rome.

<span id="iv.II-p9"></span>In the reign of Valentinian many
ecclesiastical events of great importance took place. The election of
Damasus to the Popedom in 366, when the rival factions of Damasus and
Ursinus filled the whole city with their conflict, and churches were
stormed and strewed with the slain, showed how important the Bishopric
of Rome had become. “If you would make me Pope, perhaps I might become a
Christian,” said Prætextatus, the worshipper of the old gods, to
Damasus, who wished to convert him (see p. 428). The law of Valentinian
forbidding legacies to be made to the clergy shows also their wealth and
deterioration (p. 92). But this reign produced some of the greatest
Bishops and leaders whom the Church has known. Athanasius died in 373.
Ambrose became Bishop of Milan in 374. Basil was Bishop of Cæsarea in
Cappadocia from 370 to 379.

<span id="iv.II-p10"></span>Meanwhile, the reign of Valens in the East
was unsuccessful, and ended in a great disaster. The Visigoths, and
Ostrogoths, or Gruthungi, pressed by the Huns, implored permission to
cross the Danube from their settlements in Dacia and to be allowed to
cultivate the waste lands of Thrace and Asia Minor. This was conceded to
them; but they were ill treated and cajoled, and at last asserted their
rights by force; and the Emperor, who attacked them near Adrianople, was
defeated and slain, and his army destroyed (378). The Goths were now a
formidable force within the Empire. It was in the year before the death
of Valens (377) that Stridon, the birth-place of Jerome, was destroyed.

<span id="iv.II-p11"></span><span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span> <span
id="iv.II-Page_xiii"></span>Valentinian had died in 375, leaving two
sons, Gratian, an accomplished youth of eighteen, who became Emperor of
Gaul and the West, and Valentinian II., then a child, who was nominal
Emperor of Italy and the central provinces, and who, with his mother
Justina, had his residence at Milan. Gratian distinguished himself by
his conduct of several expeditions against the German tribes beyond the
Rhine, and, upon the death of his uncle Valens, nominated Theodosius to
be Emperor of the East. But he afterwards yielded to idleness and
frivolous pleasure, and in 383 was murdered by the agents of the usurper
Maximus.

<span id="iv.II-p12"></span>Theodosius, the son of the elder Theodosius,
who had recovered Britain and Africa for the Empire, but had on a false
accusation been put to death at Carthage, was called to the Empire from
his retirement in Spain. He showed himself a great and capable ruler. He
took the Goths in detail and gradually dispossessed them. He put down
the usurper Maximus (383), and on the death of the young Valentinian
(392) fought against the usurper Eugenius, and became sole Emperor (394)
in the year before his death. He reformed the laws, enacting the
Theodosian Code. In his reign Paganism was finally suppressed. He caused
a vote to be taken in the Roman Senate for the establishment of
Christian worship and the suppression of Paganism. He destroyed the
temples—the destruction of the Serapeum at Alexandria in 389 being the
most notable instance of this—and supported Ambrose in his vehement
efforts for the suppression of Paganism. Though he loyally befriended
the Empress Justina, who was an Arian, and her young son Valentinian
II., he did not support their demand for the toleration of Arian worship
at Milan which Ambrose had denied to them, and he suppressed Arianism
throughout the Empire. To settle the doctrinal disputes raised by the
teaching of Apollinaris, Bishop of the Syrian Laodicæa, who held that
the Logos in Christ supplied the place of the human soul, and the
disputed succession at Antioch, where the Episcopal throne was claimed
by the Arian Vitalis, the Trinitarian but Arian-ordained Meletius, and
Paulinus the champion of the uncompromising orthodoxy of the West, he
summoned the Council of Constantinople, which met in 381. The President
of the Council was Gregory Nazianzen, who had come to Constantinople in
379, and, partly through his own eloquence and other great powers,
partly through the influence of Theodosius, had won his way from the
position of minister of a single church, the Anastasis, to the Episcopal
throne. The Egyptian Bishops opposed him and vainly endeavoured to foist
in the Cynic Maximus into his place. The Council did not succeed in
settling the dispute at Antioch, but they maintained the Nicene creed,
and added to it all the articles after “I believe in the Holy Ghost.”
The Council held at Rome in the following year (382), to which Jerome
went with Epiphanius, Bishop of Cyprus, and Paulinus of Antioch (p.
255), contradicted that of Constantinople on the subject of the
succession at Antioch, but agreed with it on the creed. Gregory
Nazianzen soon after the Council resigned the Bishopric of
Constantinople, and Damasus, Bishop of Rome, died in 384.

<span id="iv.II-p13"></span>Theodosius was, like Henry II. of England,
liable to violent accesses of passion. When the people of Antioch rose
in insurrection in 387, and destroyed the busts of the Emperor, he gave
an order that the city should be razed and reduced to the rank of a
village, from which sentence he was only deterred by the entreaties of
the Governor of the city and its Bishop, John Chrysostom. When a similar
rising took place at Thessalonica in 390, he was not similarly appeased,
but ordered that the people when summoned to the theatre should be
massacred by his soldiers, and seven thousand men, women and children
were thus put to death. Ambrose, on Theodosius’ coming to Milan, refused
to admit him to the communion of the Church till he had undergone five
months of penance and showed his repentance for his crime.

<span id="iv.II-p14"></span>On the death of the young Valentinian in
391, Eugenius the rhetorician usurped the throne of the West. Justina
fled to the court of Theodosius, who, after long preparations, marched
against Eugenius, and defeated him at Aquileia in 394. Theodosius,
however, did not long survive his rival. After this last success he gave
himself up to ease and self-indulgence, and died 395.

<span id="iv.II-p15"></span>The Empire was divided between the sons of
Theodosius. Arcadius, who became Emperor of the East, was eighteen years
of age, and Honorius, fourteen. Both were weak characters, ill suited to
cope with the growing dangers of the Empire. Arcadius married Eudoxia, a
woman of a worldly and violent disposition. Honorius married the
daughter of Stilicho, the great semi-barbarian general, who was his
cousin, having married Serena, the daughter of Honorius, brother to the
great Theodosius. Arcadius’ minister, Rufinus, became so unbearable in
his rapacity (see Jerome’s allusion to him, p. 447) that a tumult was
raised against him and he was put to death (395). Honorius removed his
court to Ravenna, among the pine forests of which he was more secure
from invasion; and, so long as he was under the guidance of Stilicho,
was able to live in security.

<span id="iv.II-p16"></span><span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span> <span
id="iv.II-Page_xiv"></span>John Chrysostom became Bishop of
Constantinople in 398, and by his sermons and ascetic discipline exerted
a large influence. But intrigues were raised against him by Theophilus
of Alexandria on account of his reception of the Long Monks, whom
Theophilus had banished in his zeal against Origenism. And the Empress
Eudoxia, whom his plain speaking had offended, endeavoured to work his
ruin. He was banished, after having been once brought back to the
capital by the entreaties of the people, in 404, and died in 407, having
continued to exercise his influence over the Church generally from his
exile at Comana in Pontus. His remains were brought to Constantinople
thirty years later, and were welcomed by Theodosius II. and his consort
Eudocia with tears of repentance for the fault of their predecessors.
Arcadius died in 408, leaving as his heir the young Theodosius, then but
seven years old. His daughter Pulcheria and the Prefect Anthemius
administered the Empire successfully; the Huns, who had entered the
Roman territory and encamped in Thrace, were persuaded to withdraw, and
the Eastern Empire enjoyed peace during the remainder of the reign of
Theodosius II.

<span id="iv.II-p17"></span>Turning to ecclesiastical affairs, we find a
certain calm settling down upon the Church after the Council of
Constantinople, and an unwillingness to reopen the subjects of strife.
Men used the name of heretic rather as something to frighten their
opponents, and sought to identify opinions which they disliked with the
Arianism of the past, which all alike condemned. There were much fewer
Councils of Bishops and no General Council for fifty years (Ephesus,
431). But other subjects of dispute arose, the Christian community being
saturated with Greek contentiousness. The first of these related to
Origenism. The works of the great and original church teacher of
Alexandria of the third century (\~254) had been little studied for
above a hundred years, when a new interest in them arose both in the
East and the West. The earnest study of Scripture which led to the
formation of the Vulgate, or translation from the original into the
vulgar tongue of the Latin world, led to a wish to consult the greatest
textual writer and interpreter of Scripture who had as yet appeared; and
those who learned from his Bible work to admire him were led also to
study his doctrinal views. It happened to Origen, as to many modern
teachers, that his name came to be identified with one or two prominent
doctrines; and, as men speak of Calvinism or Erastianism or Hegelianism,
so they spoke of Origenism. The doctrines which they connected with
Origen were taken from his most important work, the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, “on
First Principles.” They were mainly (1) his expressions relating to the
subordination of the Son to the Father, and (2) his eschatology. As to
the first of these, they took isolated expressions, such as, “The Son
does not see the Father,” or, “the Son is darkness in comparison with
the Father,” and they spoke of him as the father of Arius; as to the
second, they fastened upon his speculative ideas, that the coming of
men’s souls into this world was a fall from a previous state of being;
that men may rise into an angelic state; that the material body is
destined to pass away; and that in the consummation of all things all
spiritual beings, including the fallen angels, will be schooled into
obedience, so that the universe may be brought back into harmony. Men
were incapable of entering into the general system of Origen, and still
more of understanding his historical position. The Pope Anastasius who
condemned him in 404 says plainly that he knows neither who Origen was
nor when he lived (see Vol. iii. 433); and they consequently took his
tenets in an absolute sense, and thought of him as denying the divinity
of Christ, or the condemnation of the wicked, or the resurrection of the
body. His views were most widely spread in Egypt, where the contrary
tendency of Anthropomorphism, that is, the conception of God as the
subject of human properties and passions, was also widely prevalent.
Theophilus, Bishop of Alexandria, at first was generally favourable to
Origen, as was also Jerome; but, through various causes, not unmixed
with personal feeling, he turned against Origenism in a fanatical and
persecuting temper. He procured the condemnation of Origenism by the
Bishops of Egypt, Syria, and Cyprus, and also by those of Rome and
Italy; and he pursued those who had fled from his persecution to
Constantinople, and branded Chrysostom, who had receive them, as a
heretic. In all this he was aided by Jerome, who translated his missives
into Latin (see Letters 86 to 100, 113 and 114). But the whole matter
was transacted without any Council being called; the Bishops were taken
as speaking the general sentiment, and their decisions were reinforced
by a decree of the Emperors (400).

<span id="iv.II-p18"></span>The second controversy (which also was
disposed of without any General Council) was that of Pelagianism.
Pelagius and Cælestius, monks of Britain, had come to Rome in 409, and
maintained the doctrine of Free Will and the possibility of a man living
without sin, against the Augustinian doctrine of Grace, which asserted
the helplessness of man and issued in absolute predestinarianism. They
passed into Africa with the crowds who were escaping from Alaric’s
invasion, and there confronted the influence of Augustin. Condemned by a
Coun<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span> <span id="iv.II-Page_xv"></span>cil
at Carthage in 413, they passed into Palestine, and procured recognition
from Councils held at Jerusalem and Diospolis in 415, notwithstanding
the presence of Orosius, Augustin’s friend, and the accusations of the
Gaulish Bishops, Heros and Lazarus. Jerome was invited to write against
them (pp. 272, 279), and their followers rose against him and burnt his
monasteries (p. 280, Augustin De Gest. Pel. c. 66), after which they
visited Ephesus and Rome, and were at first received by the Pope
Zosimus; and several Bishops, of whom the chief was Julian of Eclana,
espoused their cause. But Augustin’s influence prevailed in the West,
while in the East little interest was taken in a controversy which was
humanistic rather than strictly theological, and men’s minds were being
drawn to the questions of Christology, which led to the Nestorian
controversy and the Council of Ephesus (431).

<span id="iv.II-p19"></span>The forces of the barbarians, which in the
reign of Valens had threatened Constantinople, were diverted to the West
in the reign of the sons of Theodosius. Those who remained within the
boundaries of the Empire imbibed something of Roman civilisation, and,
in many cases, became servants of Rome; and, as the subjects of the
Empire withdrew through love of luxury from military duties, the power
of the barbarians enlisted as mercenaries increased. Alaric, who now
rose to power, occupied an ambiguous position. He marched with his
Gothic army into Greece (396), and, being a Christian, thought himself
justified in plundering the historic fanes of the old religion. He was
attacked by Stilicho near the Isthmus of Corinth, and defeated, but he
contrived to transport his army across the gulf and to take possession
of Epiris (397), and the ministers of Arcadius thought it prudent to
make peace with him. In 398 he became at once Master-General of
Illyricum and King of the Visigoths; and, his rights not being respected
by the Emperor of the West, he invaded the North of Italy. He was
vanquished by Stilicho in the battles of Pollentia and Verona (403); but
the conqueror, who well knew the increasing weakness of Rome, made peace
with Alaric and acknowledged his official position. Alaric retreated for
a time, but another barbarian invader, Radagaisus or Radaghast, with a
mixed host of Vandals, Suevi, and Burgundians, forced his way to
Florence. He was there met by Stilicho who gained over him his last
great victory on the heights of Fiesole (406). The policy of
conciliation adopted by Stilicho might have converted Alaric and his
Goths into the guards of the Empire; but his action was disowned, and he
was treated as a traitor and put to death in 408. Then Alaric advanced
to the attack upon Rome. He was induced by fair promises to raise the
siege; but, finding that no faith could be placed in the court of
Ravenna, he renewed the siege, and took the city on August 26, 410. The
only redeeming feature in the terrible destruction which ensued was the
respect of the Goths for the Christian religion. They spared the clergy
and the churches and those who had taken refuge in them; and even the
rich plate and ornaments of divine worship were held sacred from their
rapacity. But the knell of Roman greatness had been sounded, and the end
of the Empire was near at hand. Alaric on leaving Rome ravaged Italy. He
marched to Rhegium, the flames of which Rufinus saw from the opposite
coast while he wrote his Commentary on the Book of Numbers (Vol. iii. p.
568); but his attempt to cross into Sicily was frustrated by a storm,
and he himself died before the year of the sack of Rome had closed. His
successor, Adolphus, made peace with Rome, and dared to ask for the hand
of Galla Placidia, the sister of Honorius. The King of the Goths was
accepted as the brother-in-law of the Roman Emperor.

<span id="iv.II-p20"></span>The Empire of the West might now be compared
to a ship heaving to and fro in a troubled sea, encompassed by enemies
and without captain or rudder. Britain had revolted in 409. From 409 to
413 Gaul was a prey to revolutions, and the usurper Constantine was with
difficulty overcome by the Roman General Constantius, only to be
followed by fresh usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus. The Count
Heraclian dared to invade Rome itself in 413, though defeat and death
were the penalty. One by one the provinces of the Empire passed into the
hands of the barbarians. The Goths settled in Aquitaine and in Spain;
the Vandals turned down into Africa; the Burgundians settled in the East
and North of France, and the Franks in the centre. The ruin of the
Empire of the West was practically consummated at the time of Jerome’s
death in 419, though sixty years of disaster and disgrace intervened
before its final extinction.

<span id="iv.II-p21"></span>Meanwhile the distressed condition of Italy
had driven large numbers of persons, especially of the clergy and the
upper classes of society, to take refuge in the East, so as almost to
justify Thierry’s designation of the movement as an emigration to the
Holy Land. Jerome and his friends received this tide of fugitives at
Bethlehem, and corresponded with those left behind; and thus the evils
of the time made the Solitary of the East the chief Doctor of the West.
