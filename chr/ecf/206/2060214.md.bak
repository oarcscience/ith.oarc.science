<span id="vii.iv.iv"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Galatians.</span>

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p2"></span>The Commentary is in three books, with
full Prefaces.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p3"></span>Book I., Ch. i. 1–iii. 9.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p4"></span>Addressed to Paula and Eustochium, <span
class="c17"><span id="vii.iv.iv-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span> 387.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p5"></span>The Preface to this book begins with a
striking description of the noble Roman lady Albina, which is as
follows:

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p6"></span>Only a few days have elapsed since,
having finished my exposition of the Epistle of Paul to Philemon, I had
passed to Galatians, turning my course backwards and passing over many
intervening subjects. But all at once letters unexpectedly arrived from
Rome with the news that the venerable Albina has been recalled to the
presence of the Lord, and that the saintly Marcella, bereft of the
company of her mother, demands more than ever such solace as you can
give, my dear Paula and Eustochium. This for the present is impossible
on account of the great distance to be traversed by sea and land, and I
could, therefore, wish to apply to the wound so suddenly inflicted at
least the healing virtue of Scripture. I know full well her zeal and
faith; I know how brightly the fire burns in her bosom, how she rises
superior to her sex, and soars so far above human nature itself, that
she crosses the Red Sea of this world, sounding the loud timbrel of the
inspired volumes. Certainly, when I was at Rome, she never saw me for
ever so short a time without putting some question to me respecting the
Scriptures, and she did not, like the Pythagoreans, accept the “Ipse
dixit” of her teacher, nor did authority, unsupported by the verdict of
reason, influence her; but she tested all things, and weighed the whole
matter so sagaciously that I perceived I had not a disciple so much as a
judge. And so, believing that my labours would be most acceptable to her
who is at a distance, and profitable for you who are with me here, I
will approach a work unattempted by any writers in our language before
me, and which scarcely any of the Greeks themselves have handled in a
manner worthy of the dignity of the subject.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p7"></span><span id="page_497">p. 497</span> <span
id="vii.iv.iv-Page_497"></span>*Jerome then speaks of Victorinus, who
had published a commentary on St. Paul, but “was busily engaged with
secular literature and knew nothing of the Scriptures,” and of the great
Greek writers, Origen, <span id="fr_5418"></span>[5419](#fn_5418.md)
Didymus, and <span id="fr_5419"></span>[5420](#fn_5419.md) Appolinaris,
Eusebius of Emessa, and Theodorus of Heraclea, and says he has plucked
flowers out of their gardens, so that the Commentary is more theirs than
his. The expository part of the Preface is chiefly remarkable as giving
the view of St. Paul’s rebuke of St. Peter in* <span
id="vii.iv.iv-p9.1"></span>*Galatians ii., which occasioned the
controversy between Jerome and Augustin. Jerome says:*

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p10"></span>Paul does not go straight to the point,
but is like a man walking in secret passages: his object is to exhibit
Peter as doing what was expedient for the people of the circumcision
committed to him, since, if a too sudden revolt took place from their
ancient mode of life, they might be offended and not believe in the
Cross; he wished, moreover, to show, inasmuch as the evangelisation of
the Gentiles had been entrusted to himself that he had justice on his
side in defending as true that which another only pretended was a
dispensation. That wretch Porphyry <span
id="fr_5420"></span>[5421](#fn_5420.md) Bataneotes by no means understood
this, and, therefore, in the first book of the work which he wrote
against us, he raised the objection that Peter was rebuked by Paul for
not walking uprightly as an evangelical teacher. His desire was to brand
the former with error and the latter with impudence, and to bring
against us as a body the charge of erroneous notions and false doctrine,
on the ground that the leaders of the Churches are at variance among
themselves.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p12"></span>In the Preface to Book II. Jerome
describes the origin of the Galatians as a Gaulish tribe settled in
Asia; but he takes them as slow of understanding, and says that the
Gauls still preserve this character, just as the Roman Church preserves
the character for which it was praised by St. Paul, for it still has
crowds frequenting its churches and the tombs of its martyrs, and
“nowhere else does the Amen resound so loudly, like spiritual thunder,
and shake the temples of the idols”; and similarly the traits of the
churches of Corinth and Thessalonica are still preserved; in the first,
the looseness of behaviour and of doctrine, and the conceit of worldly
knowledge; in the second, the love of the brethren side by side with the
disorderly conduct of busybodies. And he speaks of the condition of
Galatia in his own day as follows:

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p13"></span>Any one who has seen by how many schisms
Ancyra, the metropolis of Galatia, is rent and torn, and by how many
differences and false doctrines the place is debauched, knows this as
well as I do. I say nothing of <span
id="fr_5421"></span>[5422](#fn_5421.md) Cataphrygians, <span
id="fr_5422"></span>[5423](#fn_5422.md) Ophites, Borborites, and
Manichæans; for these are familiar names of human woe. Who ever heard of
Passaloryncitæ, and <span id="fr_5423"></span>[5424](#fn_5423.md)
Ascodrobi, and <span id="fr_5424"></span>[5425](#fn_5424.md) Artotyritæ,
and other portents—I can hardly call them names—in any part of the Roman
Empire? The traces of the ancient foolishness remain to this day. One
remark I must make, and so fulfil the promise with which I started.
While the Galatians, in common with the whole East, speak Greek, their
own language is almost identical with that of the <span
id="fr_5425"></span>[5426](#fn_5425.md) Treviri; and if through contact
with the Greek they have acquired a few corruptions, it is a matter of
no moment. The Africans have to some extent changed the Phenician
language, and Latin itself is daily undergoing changes through
differences of place and time.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p19"></span>The Preface to Book III. opens with the
following passage, describing, in contrast with his own simple
exposition, the arts of the preachers of his day.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p20"></span>We are now busily occupied with our
third book on Galatians, and, my friends, Paula and Eustochium, we are
well aware of our weakness, and are conscious that our slender ability
flows in but a small stream and makes little roar and rattle. For these
are the qualities (to such a pass have we come) which are now expected
even in the Churches; the simplicity and purity of apostolic language is
neglected; we meet as if we were in the <span
id="fr_5426"></span>[5427](#fn_5426.md) Athenæum, or the lecture rooms, to
kindle the applause of the bystanders; what is now required is a
discourse painted and tricked out with spurious rhetorical skill, and
which, like a strumpet in the streets, does not aim at instructing the
public, but at winning their favour; like a psaltery or a sweet-sounding
lute, it must soothe the ears of the audience; and the passage of the
prophet Ezekiel is suitable for our times, where the Lord says to him,
“Thou art become unto them as the sound of a pleasant lute which is well
made, for they hear thy words but do them not.”

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p22"></span>Jerome then speaks of the composition of
his commentaries as follows:

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p23"></span>How far I have profited by my unflagging
study of Hebrew I leave to others to decide; <span id="page_498">p.
498</span> <span id="vii.iv.iv-Page_498"></span>what I have lost in my
own language, I can tell. In addition to this, on account of the
weakness of my eyes and bodily infirmity generally, I do not write with
my own hand; and I cannot make up for my slowness of utterance by
greater pains and diligence, as is said to have been the case with
Virgil, of whom it is related that he treated his books as a bear treats
her cubs, and licked them into shape. I must summon a secretary, and
either say whatever comes uppermost; or, if I wish to think a little and
hope to produce something superior, my helper silently reproves me,
clenches his fist, wrinkles his brow, and plainly declares by his whole
bearing that he has come for nothing.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p24"></span>He then points out how the Scriptures
have dispossessed the great writers of the pre-Christian world.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p25"></span>How few there are who now read
Aristotle. How many are there who know the books, or even the name of
Plato? You may find here and there a few old men, who have nothing else
to do, who study them in a corner. <span
id="fr_5427"></span>[5428](#fn_5427.md) But the whole world speaks the
language of our Christian peasants and fishermen, the whole world
re-echoes their words. And so their simple words must be set forth with
simplicity of style; for the word *simple* applies to their *words*, not
their meaning. But if, in response to your prayers, I could, in
expounding their epistles, have the same spirit which they had when they
dictated them, you would then see in the Apostles as much majesty and
breadth of true wisdom as there is arrogance and vanity in the learned
men of the world. To make a brief confession of the secrets of my heart,
I should not like any one who wished to understand the Apostle to find a
difficulty in understanding my writings, and so be compelled to find
some one to interpret the interpreter.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p14"></span> “The patriarch (of the Montanists)
resided at Pepuza, a small town or village in Phrygia, to which the
sectaries gave the mystical name of Jerusalem, as believing that it
would be the seat of the Millennial Kingdom, which was the chief subject
of their hopes. Hence they derived the names of Pepuzians and
Cataphrygians.”—Robertson, Ch. Hist., vol. i. p. 76.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p16"></span> The Ben. editor prefers the form
Tascodrogi, and states that it is the Phrygian or Galatian equivalent
for Passaloryncitæ. The sect is said to have been so called from their
habit of putting the finger to the nose when praying.
