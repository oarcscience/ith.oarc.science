id="vii.iii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Book of Job.</span>

<span id="vii.iii.xvii-p2"></span>*This translation was dedicated to
Paula and Eustochium, about the year 388. He complains that even the
revision he was now making was the subject of many cavils. Men prefer
ancient faults to new truths, and would rather have handsome copies than
correct ones; but he boasts that “the blessed Job, who, as far as the
Latins are concerned, was till now lying amidst filth and swarming with
the worms of error, is now whole and free from stain.”*
