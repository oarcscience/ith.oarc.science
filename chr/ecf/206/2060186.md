id="vii.ii.vi-p1.1"></span>Preface to the Commentary on
Ecclesiastes.</span>

<span id="vii.ii.vi-p2"></span>Addressed to Paula and Eustochium,
Bethlehem, <span class="c17"><span

<span id="vii.ii.vi-p3"></span>I remember that, about five years ago,
when I was still living at Rome, I read Ecclesiastes to the saintly
Blesilla, <span id="fr_5384"></span>[5385](#fn_5384) so that I might
provoke her to the contempt of this earthly scene, and to count as
nothing all that she saw in the world; and that she asked me to throw my
remarks upon all the more obscure passages into the form of a short
commentary, so that, when I was absent, she might still understand what
she read. She was withdrawn from us by her sudden death, while girding
herself for our work; we were not counted worthy to have such an one as
the partner of our life; and, therefore, Paula and Eustochium, I kept
silence under the stroke of such a wound. But now, living as I do in the
smaller community of Bethlehem, I pay what I owe to her memory and to
you. I would only point out this, that I have followed no one’s
authority. I have translated direct from the Hebrew, adapting my words
as much as possible to the form of the Septuagint, but only in those
places in which they did not diverge far from the Hebrew. I have
occasionally referred also to the versions of Aquila, Symmachus, and
Theodotion, but so as not to alarm the zealous student by too many
novelties, nor yet to let my commentary follow the side streams of
opinion, turning aside, against my conscientious conviction, from the
fountainhead of truth.
