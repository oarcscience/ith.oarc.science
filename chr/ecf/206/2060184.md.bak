<span id="vii.ii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>Preface to the Book on the Sites and Names of
Hebrew Places.</span>

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p2"></span>For the scope and value of this book see
Prolegomena. It was written <span class="c17"><span
id="vii.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 388.

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p3"></span>Eusebius, who took his second name from
the blessed Martyr Pamphilus, after he had written the ten books of his
“Ecclesiastical History,” the Chronicle of Dates, of which I published a
Latin version, the book in which he set forth the names of the different
nations and those given to them of old by the Jews and by those of the
present day, the topography of the land of Judæa and the portions
allotted to the tribes, together with a representation of Jerusalem
itself and its temple, which he accompanied with a very short
explanation, bestowed his labour at the end of his life upon this little
work, of which the design is to gather for us out of the Holy Scriptures
the names of almost all the cities, mountains, rivers, hamlets, and
other places, whether they remain the same or have since been changed or
in some degree corrupted. I have taken up the work of this admirable
man, and have translated it, following the arrangement of the Greeks,
and taking the words in the order of their initial letters, but <span
id="page_486">p. 486</span> <span id="vii.ii.iv-Page_486"></span>leaving
out those names which did not seem worthy of mention, and making a
considerable number of alterations. I have explained my method once for
all in the Preface to my translation of the Chronicle, where I said that
I might be called at once a translator and the composer of a new work;
but I repeat this especially because one who had hardly the first
tincture of letters has ventured upon a translation of this very book
into Latin, though his language is hardly to be called Latin. His lack
of scholarship will be seen by the observant reader as soon as he
compares it with my translation. I do not pretend to a style which soars
to the skies; but I hope that I can rise above one which grovels on the
earth.
