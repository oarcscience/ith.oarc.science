id="vii.ii.i-p1.1"></span>Prefaces to Jerome’s Early Works.</span>

<span id="vii.ii.i-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="vii.ii.i-p2.1"></span>Preface to the Chronicle of Eusebius.</span>

<span id="vii.ii.i-p3"></span>The “Chronicle” is a book of universal
history, giving the dates from the call of Abraham, and the Olympiads.
For an account of it the reader is referred to the article of Dr. Salmon
in the “Dictionary of Christian Antiquities.” It was translated by
Jerome in the years 381–82, at Constantinople, where he was staying for
the Council. This Preface shows that Jerome was already becoming aware
of the difficulties arising from the various versions of the Old
Testament, and of the necessity of going back to the Hebrew.

<span id="vii.ii.i-p4"></span>Jerome to his friends <span
id="fr_5371"></span>[5372](#fn_5371.md) Vincentius and Gallienus, Greeting:

<span id="vii.ii.i-p6"></span>1. It has long been the practice of
learned men to exercise their minds by rendering into Latin the works of
Greek writers, and, what is more difficult, to translate the poems of
illustrious authors though trammelled by the farther requirements of
verse. It was thus that our Tully literally translated whole books of
Plato; and after publishing an edition of <span
id="fr_5372"></span>[5373](#fn_5372.md) Aratus (who may now be considered a
Roman) in hexameter verse, he amused himself with the economics of
Xenophon. In this latter work the golden river of eloquence again and
again meets with obstacles, around which its waters break and foam to
such an extent that persons unacquainted with the original would not
believe they were reading Cicero’s words. And no wonder! It is hard to
follow another man’s lines and everywhere keep within bounds. It is an
arduous task to preserve felicity and grace unimpaired in a translation.
Some word has forcibly expressed a given thought; I have no word of my
own to convey the meaning; and while I am seeking to satisfy the sense I
may go a long way round and accomplish but a small distance of my
journey. Then we must take into account the ins and outs of
transposition, the variations in cases, the diversity of figures, and,
lastly, the peculiar, and, so to speak, the native idiom of the
language. A literal translation sounds absurd; if, on the other hand, I
am obliged to change either the order or the words themselves, I shall
appear to have forsaken the duty of a translator.

<span id="vii.ii.i-p8"></span>2. So, my dear Vincentius, and you,
Gallienus, whom I love as my own soul, I beseech you, whatever may be
the value of this hurried piece of work, to read it with the feelings of
a friend rather than with those of a critic. And I ask this all the more
earnestly because, as you know, I dictated with great rapidity to my
amanuensis; and how difficult the task <span id="page_484">p. 484</span>
<span id="vii.ii.i-Page_484"></span>is, the sacred records testify; for
the old flavour is not preserved in the Greek version by the Seventy. It
was this that stimulated Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion; and the
result of their labors was to impart a totally different character to
one and the same work; one strove to give word for word, another the
general meaning, while the third desired to avoid any great divergency
from the ancients. A fifth, sixth, and seventh edition, though no one
knows to what authors they are to be attributed, exhibit so pleasing a
variety of their own that, in spite of their being anonymous, they have
won an authoritative position. Hence, some go so far as to consider the
sacred writings somewhat harsh and grating to the ear; which arises from
the fact that the persons of whom I speak are not aware that the
writings in question are a translation from the Hebrew, and therefore,
looking at the surface not at the substance, they shudder at the squalid
dress before they discover the fair body which the language clothes. In
fact, what can be more musical than the Psalter? Like the writings of
our own <span id="fr_5373"></span>[5374](#fn_5373.md) Flaccus and the
Grecian Pindar it now trips along in iambics, now flows in sonorous
alcaics, now swells into sapphics, now <span
id="fr_5374"></span>[5375](#fn_5374.md) marches in half-foot metre. What
can be more lovely than the strains of Deuteronomy and Isaiah? What more
grave than Solomon’s words? What more finished than Job? All these, as
Josephus and Origen tell us, were composed in hexameters and
pentameters, and so circulated amongst their own people. When we read
these in Greek they have *some* meaning; when in Latin they are utterly
incoherent. But if any one thinks that the grace of language does not
suffer through translation, let him render Homer word for word into
Latin. I will go farther and say that, if he will translate this author
into the prose of his own language, the order of the words will seem
ridiculous, and the most eloquent of poets almost dumb.

<span id="vii.ii.i-p11"></span>3. What is the drift of all this? I would
not have you think it strange if here and there we stumble; if the
language lag; if it bristle with consonants or present gaping chasms of
vowels; or be cramped by condensation of the narrative. The most learned
among men have toiled at the same task; and in addition to the
difficulty which all experience, and which we have alleged to attend all
translation, it must not be forgotten that a peculiar difficulty besets
us, inasmuch as the history is manifold, is full of barbarous names,
circumstances of which the Latins know nothing, dates which are tangled
knots, critical marks blended alike with the events and the numbers, so
that it is almost harder to discern the sequence of the words than to
come to a knowledge of what is related.

<span id="vii.ii.i-p12"></span>\[Here follows a long passage showing an
arrangement according to which the dates are distinguished by certain
colours as belonging to one or another of the kingdoms, the history of
which is dealt with. This passage seems unintelligible in the absence of
the coloured figures, and would be of no use unless the book with its
original arrangement were being studied.\]

<span id="vii.ii.i-p13"></span>I am well aware that there will be many
who, with their customary fondness for universal detraction (from which
the only escape is by writing nothing at all), will drive their fangs
into this volume. They will cavil at the dates, change the order, impugn
the accuracy of events, winnow the syllables, and, as is very frequently
the case, will impute the negligence of copyists to the authors. I
should be within my right if I were to rebut them by saying that they
need not read unless they choose; but I would rather send them away in a
calm state of mind, so that they may attribute to the Greek author the
credit which is his due, and may recognize that any insertions for which
we are responsible have been taken from other men of the highest repute.
The truth is that I have partly discharged the office of a translator
and partly that of a writer. I have with the utmost fidelity rendered
the Greek portion, and at the same time have added certain things which
appeared to me to have been allowed to slip, particularly in the Roman
history, which Eusebius, the author of this book, as it seems to me,
only glanced at; not so much because of ignorance, for he was a learned
man, as because, writing in Greek, he thought them of slight importance
to his countrymen. So again from Ninus and Abraham, right up to the
captivity of Troy, the translation is from the Greek only. From Troy to
the twentieth year of Constantine there is much, at one time separately
added, at another intermingled, which I have gleaned with great
diligence from Tranquillus and other famous historians. Moreover, the
portion from the aforesaid year of Constantine to the sixth consulship
of the Emperor Valens and the second of Valentinianus is entirely my
own. Content to end here, I have reserved the remaining period, that of
Gratianus and Theodosius, for a wider historical survey; not that I am
afraid to discuss the living freely and truthfully, for the fear of God
banishes the fear of man; but because while our country is still exposed
to the fury of the barbarians everything is in confusion.
