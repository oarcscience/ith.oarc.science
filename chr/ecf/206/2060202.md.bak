<span id="vii.iii.xiii"></span>

<span id="vii.iii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Daniel.</span>

<span id="vii.iii.xiii-p2"></span>The Preface is interesting as showing
the difficulties caused by the incorporation of apocryphal matter into
this book, the fact that Theodotion’s version, not the LXX., was read in
the Churches, and that the book was reckoned by the Jews not among the
prophets but among the Hagiographa. It was addressed to Paula and
Eustochium about <span class="c17"><span
id="vii.iii.xiii-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 392.

<span id="vii.iii.xiii-p3"></span>The Septuagint version of Daniel the
prophet is not read by the Churches of our Lord and Saviour. They use
Theodotion’s version, but how this came to pass I cannot tell. Whether
it be that the language is Chaldee, which differs in certain
peculiarities from our speech, and the Seventy were unwilling to follow
those deviations in a translation; or that the book was published in the
name of the Seventy, by some one or other not familiar with Chaldee, or
if there be some other reason, I know not; this one thing I can
affirm—that it differs widely from the original, and is rightly
rejected. For we <span id="page_493">p. 493</span> <span
id="vii.iii.xiii-Page_493"></span>must bear in mind that Daniel and
Ezra, the former especially, were written in Hebrew letters, but in the
Chaldee language, as was <span id="fr_5405"></span>[5406](#fn_5405.md) one
section of Jeremiah; and, further, that Job has much affinity with
Arabic. As for myself, when, in lily youth, after reading the flowery
rhetoric of Quintilian and Tully, I entered on the vigorous study of
this language, the expenditure of much time and energy barely enabled me
to utter the puffing and hissing words; I seemed to be walking in a sort
of underground chamber with a few scattered rays of light shining down
upon me; and when at last I met with Daniel, such a sense of weariness
came over me that, in a fit of despair, I could have counted all my
former toil as useless. But there was a certain Hebrew who encouraged
me, and was for ever quoting for my benefit the saying that “Persistent
labour conquers all things”; and so, conscious that among Hebrews I was
only a smatterer, I once more began to study Chaldee. And, to confess
the truth, to this day I can read and understand Chaldee better than I
can pronounce it. I say this to show you how hard it is to master the
book of Daniel, which in Hebrew contains neither the history of Susanna,
nor the hymn of the three youths, nor the fables of Bel and the Dragon;
because, however, they are to be found everywhere, we have formed them
into an appendix, prefixing to them an obelus, and thus making an end of
them, so as not to seem to the uninformed to have cut off a large
portion of the volume. I heard a certain Jewish teacher, when mocking at
the history of Susanna, and saying that it was the fiction of some Greek
or other, raise the same objection which Africanus brought against
Origen—that these etymologies of <span
id="fr_5406"></span>[5407](#fn_5406.md) <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iii.xiii-p5.3"></span>σχίσαι</span> from <span
id="fr_5407"></span>[5408](#fn_5407.md) <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iii.xiii-p6.1"></span>σχίνος</span>, and <span
id="fr_5408"></span>[5409](#fn_5408.md) <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iii.xiii-p7.1"></span>πρίσαι</span> from <span
id="fr_5409"></span>[5410](#fn_5409.md) <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iii.xiii-p8.1"></span>πρίνος</span>, are to be traced to the
Greek. To make the point clear to Latin readers: It is as if he were to
say, playing upon the word *ilex*, *illico pereas*; or upon *lentiscus*,
may the angel make a *lentil* of you, or may you perish *nan lente*, or
may you *lentus* (that is pliant or compliant) be led to death, or
anything else suiting the name of the tree. Then he would captiously
maintain that the three youths in the furnace of raging fire had leisure
enough to amuse themselves with making poetry, and to summon all the
elements in turn to praise God. Or what was there miraculous, he would
say, or what indication of divine inspiration, in the slaying of the
dragon with a lump of pitch, or in frustrating the schemes of the
priests of Bel? Such deeds were more the results of an able man’s
forethought than of a prophetic spirit. But when he came to <span
id="fr_5410"></span>[5411](#fn_5410.md) Habakkuk and read that he was
carried from Judæa into Chaldæa to bring a dish of food to Daniel, he
asked where we found an instance in the whole of the Old Testament of
any saint with an ordinary body flying through the air, and in a quarter
of an hour traversing vast tracts of country. And when one of us who was
rather too ready to speak adduced the instance of Ezekiel, and said that
he was transported from Chaldæa into Judæa, he derided the man and
proved from the book itself that Ezekiel, in spirit, saw himself carried
over. And he argued that even our own Apostle, being an accomplished man
and one who had been taught the law by Hebrews, had not dared to affirm
that he was bodily rapt away, but had said: <span
id="fr_5411"></span>[5412](#fn_5411.md) “Whether in the body, or out of the
body, I know not; God knoweth.” By these and similar arguments he used
to refute the apocryphal fables in the Church’s book. Leaving this for
the reader to pronounce upon as he may think fit, I give warning that
Daniel in Hebrew is not found among the prophets, but amongst the
writers of the Hagiographa; for all Scripture is by them divided into
three parts: the law, the Prophets, and the Hagiographa, which have
respectively five, eight, and eleven books, a point which we cannot now
discuss. But as to the objections which <span
id="fr_5412"></span>[5413](#fn_5412.md) Porphyry raises against this
prophet, or rather brings against the book, <span
id="fr_5413"></span>[5414](#fn_5413.md) Methodius, Eusebius, and
Apollinaris may be cited as witnesses, for they replied to his folly in
many thousand lines of writing, whether with satisfaction to the curious
reader I know not. Therefore, I beseech you, Paula and Eustochium, to
pour out your supplications for me to the Lord, that so long as I am in
this poor body, I may write something pleasing to you, useful to the
Church, worthy of posterity. As for my contemporaries, I am indifferent
to their opinions, for they pass from side to side as they are moved by
love or hatred.
