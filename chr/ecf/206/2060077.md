<span id="v.LXVI-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.LXVI-p1.1"></span>Letter LXVI. To Pammachius.</span>

<span id="v.LXVI-p2"></span>Pammachius a Roman senator, had lost his
wife Paulina one of Paula’s daughters, while she was still in the flower
of her youth. It was not till two years had elapsed that Jerome ventured
to write to him; and when he did so he dwelt but little on the life and
virtues of Paulina. Probably there was but little to tell. The greater
part of the letter is taken up with commendation of Pammachius himself
who, in spite of his high rank and position, had become a monk and was
now living a life of severe self-denial. Jerome speaks approvingly of
the Hospice for Strangers which, in conjunction with Fabiola, Pammachius
had set up at Portus, and describes his own somewhat similar
institutions at Bethlehem. He also mentions Paula, Eustochium, and the
dead Blæsilla, all in terms of the highest praise. The date of the
letter is 397 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.LXVI-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.LXVI-p3"></span>1. Supposing a wound to be healed and a scar
to have been formed upon the skin, any course of treatment designed to
remove the <span id="page_135">p. 135</span> <span
id="v.LXVI-Page_135"></span>mark must in its effort to improve the
appearance renew the smart of the original wound. After two years of
inopportune silence my condolence now comes rather late; yet even so I
am afraid that my present speech may be still more inopportune. I fear
lest in touching the sore spot in your heart I may by my words inflame
afresh a wound which time and reflection have availed to cure. For who
can have ears so dull or hearts so flinty as to hear the name of your
Paulina without weeping? Even though reared on the milk of Hyrcanian
tigresses <span id="fr_1916"></span>[1917](#fn_1916.md) they must still
shed tears. Who can with dry eyes see thus untimely cut down and
withered an opening rose, an undeveloped bud, <span
id="fr_1917"></span>[1918](#fn_1917.md) which has not yet formed itself
into a cup nor spread forth the proud display of its crimson petals? In
her a most priceless pearl is broken. In her a vivid emerald is
shattered. Sickness alone shews us the blessedness of health. We realize
better what we have had when we cease to have it.

<span id="v.LXVI-p6"></span>2. The good ground of which we read in the
parable brought forth fruit, some an hundred-fold, some sixtyfold, and
some thirtyfold. <span id="fr_1918"></span>[1919](#fn_1918.md) In this
threefold yield I recognize an emblem of the three different rewards of
Christ which have fallen to three women <span
id="fr_1919"></span>[1920](#fn_1919.md) closely united in blood and moral
excellence. Eustochium culls the flowers of virginity. Paula sweeps the
toilsome threshing floor of widowhood. Paulina keeps the bed undefiled
of marriage. A mother with such daughters wins for herself on earth all
that Christ has promised to give in heaven. Then to complete the team—if
I may so call it—of four saints turned out by a single family, and to
match the women’s virtues by those of a man, the three have a fit
companion in Pammachius who is a cherub such as Ezekiel describes, <span
id="fr_1920"></span>[1921](#fn_1920.md) brother-in-law to the first,
son-in-law to the second, husband to the third. Husband did I say? Nay,
rather a most devoted brother; for the language of marriage is
inadequate to describe the holy bonds of the Spirit. Of this team Jesus
holds the reins, and it is of steeds like these that Habakkuk sings:
“ride upon thy horses and let thy riding be salvation.” <span
id="fr_1921"></span>[1922](#fn_1921.md) With like resolve if with unlike
speed they strain after the victor’s palm. Their colours are different;
their object is the same. They are harnessed in one yoke, they obey one
driver, not waiting for the lash but answering the call of his voice
with fresh efforts.

<span id="v.LXVI-p11"></span>3. Let me use for a moment the language of
philosophy. According to the Stoics there are four virtues so closely
related and mutually coherent that he who lacks one lacks all. They are
prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. <span
id="fr_1922"></span>[1923](#fn_1922.md) While all of you possess the four,
yet each is remarkable for one. You have prudence, your mother has
justice, your virgin sister has fortitude, your wedded wife has
temperance. I speak of you as wise, for who can be wiser than one who,
despising the folly of the world, has followed Christ “the power of God
and the wisdom of God”? <span id="fr_1923"></span>[1924](#fn_1923.md) Or
what better instance can there be of justice than your mother, who
having divided her substance among her offspring has taught them by her
own contempt of riches the true object on which to fix their affections?
Who has set a better example of courage than Eustochium, who by
resolving to be a virgin has breached the gates of the nobility and
broken down the pride of a consular house? The first of Roman ladies,
she has brought under the yoke the first of Roman families. Has there
ever been temperance greater than that of Paulina, who, reading the
words of the apostle: “marriage is honourable in all and the bed
undefiled,” <span id="fr_1924"></span>[1925](#fn_1924.md) and not presuming
to aspire to the happiness of her virgin sister or the continence of her
widowed mother, has preferred to keep to the safe track of a lower path
rather than treading on air to lose herself in the clouds? When once she
had entered upon the married state, her one thought day and night was
that, as soon as her union should be blessed with offspring, she would
live thenceforth in the second degree of chastity, <span
id="fr_1925"></span>[1926](#fn_1925.md) and

<span id="v.LXVI-p16"></span>Though woman, foremost in the high
emprise, <span id="fr_1926"></span>[1927](#fn_1926.md)

<span id="v.LXVI-p18"></span>would induce her husband to follow a like
course. She would not forsake him but looked for the day when he would
become a companion in salvation. Finding by several miscarriages that
her womb was not barren, she could not give up all hope of having
children and had to allow her own reluctance to give way to the
eagerness of her mother-in-law and the chagrin of her husband. Thus she
suffered much as Rachel suffered, <span
id="fr_1927"></span>[1928](#fn_1927.md) although instead of bringing forth
like her a son of pangs and of the right hand, <span
id="fr_1928"></span>[1929](#fn_1928.md) the heir she had longed for was no
other than her husband. I have learned on good authority that her wish
in submitting herself to her husband was not to take advantage of God’s
primitive command “Be faithful and multiply and replenish the
earth” <span id="fr_1929"></span>[1930](#fn_1929.md) but that she only
desired children that she might bring forth virgins to Christ.

<span id="v.LXVI-p22"></span>4. We read that the wife of Phinehas the
priest, on hearing that the ark of the Lord <span id="page_136">p.
136</span> <span id="v.LXVI-Page_136"></span>had been taken, was seized
suddenly with the pains of travail and that she brought forth a son
Ichabod and died a mother in the hands of the women who nursed
her. <span id="fr_1930"></span>[1931](#fn_1930.md) Rachel’s son is called
Benjamin, that is ‘son of excellence’ or ‘of the right hand’; but the
son of the other, afterwards to be a distinguished priest of God,
derives his name from the ark. <span
id="fr_1931"></span>[1932](#fn_1931.md) The same thing has come to pass in
our own day, for since Paulina fell asleep the Church has posthumously
borne the monk Pammachius, a patrician by his parentage and marriage,
rich in alms, and lofty in lowliness. The apostle writes to the
Corinthians, “Ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men,
not many noble are called.” <span id="fr_1932"></span>[1933](#fn_1932.md)
The conditions of the nascent church required this to be so that the
grain of mustard seed might grow up little by little into a tree, <span
id="fr_1933"></span>[1934](#fn_1933.md) and that the leaven of the gospel
might gradually raise more and more the whole lump of the church. <span
id="fr_1934"></span>[1935](#fn_1934.md) In our day Rome possesses what the
world in days gone by knew not of. Then few of the wise or mighty or
noble were Christians; now many wise powerful and noble are not
Christians only but even monks. And among them all my Pammachius is the
wisest, the mightiest, and the noblest; great among the great, a leader
among leaders, he is the commander in chief of all monks. He and others
like him are the offspring which Paulina desired to have in her life
time and which she has given us in her death. “Sing, O barren, thou that
didst not bear; break forth into singing and cry aloud, thou that didst
not travail with child”; <span id="fr_1935"></span>[1936](#fn_1935.md) for
in a moment thou hast brought forth as many sons as there are poor men
in Rome.

<span id="v.LXVI-p29"></span>5. The glowing gems which in old days
adorned the neck and face of Paulina now purchase food for the needy.
Her silk dresses and gold brocades are exchanged for soft woollen
garments intended to keep out the cold and not to expose the body to
vain admiration. All that formerly ministered to luxury is now at the
service of virtue. That blind man holding out his hand, and often crying
aloud when there is none to hear, is the heir of Paulina, is co-heir
with Pammachius. That poor cripple who can scarcely drag himself along,
owes his support to the help of a tender girl. Those doors which of old
poured forth crowds of visitors, are now beset only by the wretched. One
suffers from a dropsy, big with death; another mute and without the
means of begging, begs the more appealingly because he cannot beg;
another maimed from his childhood implores an alms which he may not
himself enjoy. Still another has his limbs rotted with jaundice and
lives on after his body has become a corpse. To use the language of
Virgil:

<span id="v.LXVI-p30"></span>Had I a hundred tongues, a hundred lips,

<span id="v.LXVI-p31"></span>I could not tell men’s countless
sufferings. <span id="fr_1936"></span>[1937](#fn_1936.md)

<span id="v.LXVI-p33"></span>Such is the bodyguard which accompanies
Pammachius wherever he walks; in the persons of such he ministers to
Christ Himself; and their squalor serves to whiten his soul. Thus he
speeds on his way to heaven, beneficent as a giver of games to the poor,
and kind as a provider of shows for the needy. Other husbands scatter on
the graves of their wives violets, roses, lilies, and purple flowers;
and assuage the grief of their hearts by fulfilling this tender duty.
Our dear Pammachius also waters the holy ashes and the revered bones of
Paulina, but it is with the balm of almsgiving. These are the
confections and the perfumes with which he cherishes the dead embers of
his wife knowing that it is written: “Water will quench a flaming fire;
and alms maketh an atonement for sins.” <span
id="fr_1937"></span>[1938](#fn_1937.md) What great power compassion has and
what high rewards it is destined to win, the blessed Cyprian sets forth
in an extensive work. <span id="fr_1938"></span>[1939](#fn_1938.md) It is
proved also by the counsel of Daniel who desired the most impious of
kings—had he been willing to hear him—to be saved by shewing mercy to
the poor. <span id="fr_1939"></span>[1940](#fn_1939.md) Paulina’s mother
may well be glad of Paulina’s heir. She cannot regret that her
daughter’s wealth has passed into new hands when she sees it still spent
upon the objects she had at heart. Nay, rather she must congratulate
herself that without any exertion of her own her wishes are being
carried out. The sum available for distribution is the same as before:
only the distributor is changed.

<span id="v.LXVI-p37"></span>6. Who can credit the fact that one, who is
the glory of the Furian stock and whose grandfathers and great
grandfathers have been consuls, moves amid the senators in their purple
clothed in sombre garb, and that, so far from blushing when he meets the
eyes of his companions, he actually derides those who deride him! “There
is a shame that leadeth to death and there is a shame that leadeth to
life.” <span id="fr_1940"></span>[1941](#fn_1940.md) It is a monk’s first
virtue to despise the judgments of men and always to remember the
apostle’s words:—“If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of
Christ.” <span id="fr_1941"></span>[1942](#fn_1941.md) In the same sense
the Lord says to the prophets that He has made their face a brazen city
and <span id="page_137">p. 137</span> <span
id="v.LXVI-Page_137"></span>a stone of adamant and an iron pillar, <span
id="fr_1942"></span>[1943](#fn_1942.md) to the end that they shall not be
afraid of the insults of the people but shall by the sternness of their
looks discompose the effrontery of those who sneered at them. A finely
strung mind is more readily overcome by contumely than by terror. And
men whom no tortures can overawe are sometimes prevailed over by the
fear of shame. Surely it is no small thing for a man of birth,
eloquence, and wealth to avoid the company of the powerful in the
streets, to mingle with the crowd, to cleave to the poor, to associate
on equal terms with the untaught, to cease to be a leader and to become
one of the people. The more he humbles himself, the more he is
exalted. <span id="fr_1943"></span>[1944](#fn_1943.md)

<span id="v.LXVI-p42"></span>7. A pearl will shine in the midst of
squalor and a gem of the first water will sparkle in the mire. This is
what the Lord promised when He said: “Them that honour me I will
honour.” <span id="fr_1944"></span>[1945](#fn_1944.md) Others may
understand this of the future when sorrow shall be turned into joy and
when, although the world shall pass away, the saints shall receive a
crown which shall never pass. But I for my part see that the promises
made to the saints are fulfilled even in this present life. Before he
began to serve Christ with his whole heart, Pammachius was a well known
person in the senate. Still there were many other senators who wore the
badges of proconsular rank. The whole world is filled with similar
decorations. He was in the first rank it is true, but there were others
in it besides him. Whilst he took precedence of some, others took
precedence of him. The most distinguished privilege loses its prestige
when lavished on a crowd, and dignities themselves become less dignified
in the eyes of good men when held by persons who have no dignity. Thus
Tully finely says of Cæsar, when he wished to advance some of his
adherents, “he did not so much honour them as dishonour the honourable
positions in which he placed them.” <span
id="fr_1945"></span>[1946](#fn_1945.md) To-day all the churches of Christ
are talking of Pammachius. The whole world admires as a poor man one
whom heretofore it ignored as rich. Can anything be more splendid than
the consulate? Yet the honour lasts only for a year and when another has
succeeded to the post its former occupant gives way. Each man’s laurels
are lost in the crowd and sometimes triumphs themselves are marred by
the shortcomings of those who celebrate them. An office which was once
handed down from patrician to patrician, which only men of noble birth
could hold, of which the consul Marius—victor though he was over Numidia
and the Teutons and the Cimbri—was held unworthy on account of the
obscurity of his family, and which Scipio won before his time as the
reward of valour,—this great office is now obtained by merely belonging
to the army; and the shining robe of victory <span
id="fr_1946"></span>[1947](#fn_1946.md) now envelops men who a little while
ago were country boors. Thus we have received more than we have given.
The things we have renounced are small; the things we possess are great.
All that Christ promises is duly performed and for what we have given up
we have received an hundredfold. <span
id="fr_1947"></span>[1948](#fn_1947.md) This was the ground in which Isaac
sowed his seed, <span id="fr_1948"></span>[1949](#fn_1948.md) Isaac who in
his readiness to die <span id="fr_1949"></span>[1950](#fn_1949.md) bore the
cross of the Gospel before the Gospel came.

<span id="v.LXVI-p49"></span>8. “If thou wilt be perfect,” the Lord
says, “go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor.…and come and
follow me.” <span id="fr_1950"></span>[1951](#fn_1950.md) If thou wilt be
perfect. Great enterprises are always left to the free choice of those
who hear of them. Thus the apostle refrains from making virginity a
positive duty, because the Lord in speaking of eunuchs who had made
themselves such for the kingdom of heaven’s sake finally said: “He that
is able to receive it, let him receive it.” <span
id="fr_1951"></span>[1952](#fn_1951.md) For, to quote the apostle, “it is
not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that
sheweth mercy.” <span id="fr_1952"></span>[1953](#fn_1952.md) If thou wilt
be perfect. There is no compulsion laid upon you: if you are to win the
prize it must be by the exercise of your own free will. If therefore you
will to be perfect and desire to be as the prophets, as the apostles, as
Christ Himself, sell not a part of your substance (lest the fear of want
become an occasion of unfaithfulness, and so you perish with Ananias and
Sapphira <span id="fr_1953"></span>[1954](#fn_1953) .md) but all that you
have. And when you have sold all, give the proceeds not to the wealthy
or to the high-minded but to the poor. Give each man enough for his
immediate need but do not give money to swell what a man has already.
“Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the
corn,” <span id="fr_1954"></span>[1955](#fn_1954.md) and “the labourer is
worthy of his reward.” <span id="fr_1955"></span>[1956](#fn_1955.md) Again
“they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar.” <span
id="fr_1956"></span>[1957](#fn_1956.md) Remember also these words: “having
food and raiment let us be therewith content.” <span
id="fr_1957"></span>[1958](#fn_1957.md) Where you see smoking dishes,
steaming pheasants, massive silver plate, spirited nags, long-haired
boy-slaves, expensive clothing, and embroidered hangings, give nothing
there. For he to whom you would give is richer than you the giver. It is
moreover a kind of sacrilege to give what belongs to the poor to those
who are not poor. Yet to be a <span id="page_138">p. 138</span> <span
id="v.LXVI-Page_138"></span>perfect and complete Christian it is not
enough to despise wealth or to squander and fling away one’s money, a
thing which can be lost and found in a single moment. Crates the
Theban <span id="fr_1958"></span>[1959](#fn_1958.md) did this, so did
Antisthenes and several others, whose lives shew them to have had many
faults. The disciple of Christ must do more for the attainment of
spiritual glory than the philosopher of the world, than the venal slave
of flying rumours and of the people’s breath. It is not enough for you
to despise wealth unless you follow Christ as well. And only he follows
Christ who forsakes his sins and walks hand in hand with virtue. We know
that Christ is wisdom. He is the treasure which in the scriptures a man
finds in his field. <span id="fr_1959"></span>[1960](#fn_1959.md) He is the
peerless gem which is bought by selling many pearls. <span
id="fr_1960"></span>[1961](#fn_1960.md) But if you love a captive woman,
that is, worldly wisdom, and if no beauty but hers attracts you, make
her bald and cut off her alluring hair, that is to say, the graces of
style, and pare away her dead nails. <span
id="fr_1961"></span>[1962](#fn_1961.md) Wash her with the nitre of which
the prophet speaks, <span id="fr_1962"></span>[1963](#fn_1962.md) and then
take your ease with her and say “Her left hand is under my head, and her
right hand doth embrace me.” <span id="fr_1963"></span>[1964](#fn_1963.md)
Then shall the captive bring to you many children; from a
Moabitess <span id="fr_1964"></span>[1965](#fn_1964.md) she shall become an
Israelitish woman. Christ is that sanctification without which no man
shall see the face of God. Christ is our redemption, for He is at once
our Redeemer and our Ransom. <span id="fr_1965"></span>[1966](#fn_1965.md)
Christ is all, that he who has left all for Christ may find One in place
of all, and may be able to proclaim freely, “The Lord is my
portion.” <span id="fr_1966"></span>[1967](#fn_1966.md)

<span id="v.LXVI-p67"></span>9. I see clearly that you have a warm
affection for divine learning and that far from trying—like some rash
persons—to teach that of which you are yourself ignorant you make it
your first object to learn what you are going to teach. Your letters in
their simplicity are redolent of the prophets and savour strongly of the
apostles. You do not affect a stilted eloquence, nor boylike balance
shallow sentences in clauses neatly-turned. The quickly frothing foam
disappears with equal quickness; and a tumour though it enlarges the
size of the body is injurious to health. It is moreover a shrewd maxim,
this of Cato, “Fast enough if well enough.” Long ago it is true in the
days of our youth we laughed outright at this dictum when the finished
orator <span id="fr_1967"></span>[1968](#fn_1967.md) used it in his
exordium. I fancy you remember the mistake <span
id="fr_1968"></span>[1969](#fn_1968.md) shared by the speaker in our
Athenæum and how the whole room resounded with the cry taken up by the
students “Fast enough if well enough.” According to Fabius <span
id="fr_1969"></span>[1970](#fn_1969.md) crafts would be sure to prosper if
none but craftsmen were allowed to criticise them. No man can adequately
estimate a poet unless he is competent himself to write verse. No man
can comprehend philosophers, unless he is acquainted with the various
theories that they have held. Material and visible products are best
appraised by those who make them. To what a cruel lot we men of letters
are exposed you may gather from the fact that we are forced to rely on
the judgment of the public; and many a man is in company a formidable
opponent who would certainly be despised could he be seen alone. I have
touched on this in passing to make you content, if possible, with the
ear of the learned. Disregard the remarks which uneducated persons make
concerning your ability; but day by day imbibe the marrow of the
prophets, that you may know the mystery of Christ and share this mystery
with the patriarchs.

<span id="v.LXVI-p71"></span>10. Whether you read or write, whether you
wake or sleep, let the herdsman’s horn of Amos <span
id="fr_1970"></span>[1971](#fn_1970.md) always ring in your ears. Let the
sound of the clarion arouse your soul, let the divine love carry you out
of yourself; and then seek upon your bed him whom your soul
loveth, <span id="fr_1971"></span>[1972](#fn_1971.md) and boldly say: “I
sleep, but my heart waketh.” <span id="fr_1972"></span>[1973](#fn_1972.md)
And when you have found him and taken hold of him, let him not go. And
if you fall asleep for a moment and He escapes from your hands, do not
forthwith despair. Go out into the streets and charge the daughters of
Jerusalem: then shall you find him lying down in the noontide weary and
drunk with passion, or wet with the dew of night by the flocks of his
companions, or fragrant with many kinds of spices, amid the apples of
the garden. <span id="fr_1973"></span>[1974](#fn_1973.md) There give to him
your breasts, let him suck your learned bosom, let him rest in the midst
of his heritage, <span id="fr_1974"></span>[1975](#fn_1974.md) his feathers
as those of a dove overlaid with silver and his inward parts with the
brightness of gold. This young child, this mere boy, who is fed on
butter and honey, <span id="fr_1975"></span>[1976](#fn_1975.md) and who is
reared among curdled mountains, <span
id="fr_1976"></span>[1977](#fn_1976.md) quickly grows up to manhood,
speedily spoils all <span id="fr_1977"></span>[1978](#fn_1977.md) that is
opposed to him in you, and when the time is ripe plunders \[the
spiritual\] Damascus and puts in chains the king of \[the spiritual\]
Assyria.

<span id="v.LXVI-p80"></span>11. I hear that you have erected a hospice
for strangers at Portus and that you have planted a twig from the tree
of Abraham <span id="fr_1978"></span>[1979](#fn_1978.md) <span
id="page_139">p. 139</span> <span id="v.LXVI-Page_139"></span>upon the
Ausonian shore. Like Æneas you are tracing the outlines of a new
encampment; only that, whereas he, when he reached the waters of the
Tiber, under pressure of want had to eat the square flat cakes which
formed the tables spoken of by the oracle, <span
id="fr_1979"></span>[1980](#fn_1979.md) you are able to build a house of
bread to rival this little village of Bethlehem <span
id="fr_1980"></span>[1981](#fn_1980.md) wherein I am staying; and here
after their long privations you propose to satisfy travellers with
sudden plenty. Well done. You have surpassed my poor beginning. <span
id="fr_1981"></span>[1982](#fn_1981.md) You have reached the highest point.
You have made your way from the root to the top of the tree. You are the
first of monks in the first city of the world: you do right therefore to
follow the first of the patriarchs. Let Lot, whose name means ‘one who
turns aside’ choose the plain <span id="fr_1982"></span>[1983](#fn_1982.md)
and let him follow the left and easy branch of the famous letter of
Pythagoras. <span id="fr_1983"></span>[1984](#fn_1983.md) But do you make
ready for yourself a monument like Sarah’s <span
id="fr_1984"></span>[1985](#fn_1984.md) on steep and rocky heights. Let the
City of Books be near; <span id="fr_1985"></span>[1986](#fn_1985.md) and
when you have destroyed the giants, the sons of Anak, <span
id="fr_1986"></span>[1987](#fn_1986.md) make over your heritage to joy and
merriment. <span id="fr_1987"></span>[1988](#fn_1987.md) Abraham was rich
in gold and silver and cattle, in substance and in raiment: his
household was so large that on an emergency he could bring a picked body
of young men into the field, and could pursue as far as Dan and then
slay four kings who had already put five kings to flight. <span
id="fr_1988"></span>[1989](#fn_1988.md) Frequently exercising hospitality
and never turning any man away from his door, he was accounted worthy at
last to entertain God himself. He was not satisfied with giving orders
to his servants and hand-maids to attend to his guests, nor did he
lessen the favour he conferred by leaving others to care for them; but
as though he had found a prize, he and Sarah his wife gave themselves to
the duties of hospitality. With his own hands he washed the feet of his
guests, upon his own shoulders he brought home a fat calf from the herd.
While the strangers dined he stood by to serve them, and set before them
the dishes cooked by Sarah’s hands—though meaning to fast himself.

<span id="v.LXVI-p92"></span>12. The regard which I feel for you, my
dear brother, makes me remind you of these things; for you must offer to
Christ not only your money but yourself, to be a “living sacrifice,
holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service,” <span
id="fr_1989"></span>[1990](#fn_1989.md) and you must imitate the son of man
who “came not to be ministered unto but to minister.” <span
id="fr_1990"></span>[1991](#fn_1990.md) What the patriarch did for
strangers that our Lord and Master did for His servants and disciples.
“Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.
But,” says the devil, “touch his flesh and he will curse thee to thy
face.” <span id="fr_1991"></span>[1992](#fn_1991.md) The old enemy knows
that the battle with impurity is a harder one than that with
covetousness. It is easy to cast off what clings to us from without, but
a war within our borders involves far greater peril. We have to unfasten
things joined together, we have to sunder things firmly united. Zacchæus
was rich while the apostles were poor. He restored fourfold all that he
had taken and gave to the poor the half of his remaining substance. He
welcomed Christ as his guest, and salvation came unto his house. <span
id="fr_1992"></span>[1993](#fn_1992.md) And yet because he was little of
stature and could not reach the apostolic standard of height, he was not
numbered with the twelve apostles. Now as regards wealth the apostles
gave up nothing at all, but as regards will they one and all gave up the
whole world. If we offer to Christ our souls as well as our riches, he
will gladly receive our offering. But if we give to God only those
things which are without while we give to the devil those things which
are within, the division is not fair, and the divine voice says: “Hast
thou not sinned in offering aright, and yet not dividing aright?” <span
id="fr_1993"></span>[1994](#fn_1993.md)

<span id="v.LXVI-p98"></span>13. That you, the leader of the patrician
order, first set the example of turning monk should not be to you an
occasion of boasting but rather one of humility, knowing as you do that
the Son of God became the Son of man. However low you may abase
yourself, you cannot be more lowly than Christ. Even supposing that you
walk barefooted, that you dress in sombre garb, that you rank yourself
with the poor, that you condescend to enter the tenements of the needy,
that you are eyes to the blind, hands to the weak, feet to the lame,
that you carry water and hew wood and make fires—even supposing that you
do all this, where are the chains, the buffets, the spittings, the
scourgings, the gibbet, the death which the Lord endured? And even when
you have done all the things I have mentioned, you are still surpassed
by your sister Eustochium as well as by Paula: for considering the
weakness of their sex they have done more work relatively if less
absolutely, than you. I myself was not at Rome but in the desert—would
that I had continued there—at the time when your father-in-law Toxotius
was still alive and his daughters were still given up to the world. But
I have heard that they were too dainty to walk in the muddy streets,
that <span id="page_140">p. 140</span> <span
id="v.LXVI-Page_140"></span>they were carried about in the arms of
eunuchs, that they disliked crossing uneven ground, that they found a
silk dress a burthen and felt sunshine too scorching. But now, squalid
and sombre in their dress, they are positive heroines in comparison with
what they used to be. They trim lamps, light fires, sweep floors, clean
vegetables, put heads of cabbage in the pot to boil, lay tables, hand
cups, help dishes and run to and fro to wait on others. And yet there is
no lack of virgins under the same roof with them. Is it then that they
have no servants upon whom they can lay these duties? Surely not. They
are unwilling that others should surpass them in physical toil whom they
themselves surpass in rigour of mind. I say all this not because I doubt
your mental ardour but that I may quicken the pace at which you are
running, and in the heat of battle may add warmth to your warmth.

<span id="v.LXVI-p99"></span>14. I for my part am building in this
province a monastery and a hospice close by; so that, if Joseph and Mary
chance to come to Bethlehem, they may not fail to find shelter and
welcome. Indeed, the number of monks who flock here from all quarters of
the world is so overwhelming that I can neither desist from my
enterprise nor bear so great a burthen. The warning of the gospel has
been all but fulfilled in me, for I did not sufficiently count the cost
of the tower I was about to build; <span
id="fr_1994"></span>[1995](#fn_1994.md) accordingly I have been constrained
to send my brother Paulinian <span id="fr_1995"></span>[1996](#fn_1995.md)
to Italy to sell some ruinous villas which have escaped the hands of the
barbarians, and also the property inherited from our common parents. For
I am loth, now that I have begun it, to give up ministering to the
saints, lest I incur the ridicule of carping and envious persons.

<span id="v.LXVI-p102"></span>15. Now that I have come to the conclusion
of my letter I recall my metaphor of the four-horse team, and recollect
that Blæsilla would have made a fifth had she been spared to share your
resolve. I had almost forgotten to mention her, the first of you all to
go to meet the Lord. You who once were five I now see to be two and
three. Blæsilla and her sister Paulina rest in sweet sleep: you with the
two others on either side of you will fly upward to Christ more easily.
