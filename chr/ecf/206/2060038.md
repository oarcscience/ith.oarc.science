<span id="v.XXVII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XXVII-p1.1"></span>Letter XXVII. To Marcella.</span>

<span id="v.XXVII-p2"></span>In this letter Jerome defends himself
against the charge of having altered the text of Scripture, and shows
that he has merely brought the Latin Version of the N.T. into agreement
with the Greek original. Written at Rome 384 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XXVII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.XXVII-p3"></span>1. After I had written my former
letter, <span id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707.md) containing a few remarks
on some Hebrew words, a report suddenly reached me that <span
id="page_44">p. 44</span> <span id="v.XXVII-Page_44"></span>certain
contemptible creatures were deliberately assailing me with the charge
that I had endeavored to correct passages in the gospels, against the
authority of the ancients and the opinion of the whole world. Now,
though I might—as far as strict right goes—treat these persons with
contempt (it is idle to play the lyre for an ass <span
id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708) .md), yet, lest they should follow their
usual habit and reproach me with superciliousness, let them take my
answer as follows: I am not so dull-wilted nor so coarsely ignorant
(qualities which they take for holiness, calling themselves the
disciples of fishermen as if men were made holy by knowing nothing)—I am
not, I repeat, so ignorant as to suppose that any of the Lord’s words is
either in need of correction or is not divinely inspired; but the Latin
manuscripts of the Scriptures are proved to be faulty by the variations
which all of them exhibit, and my object has been to restore them to the
form of the Greek original, from which my detractors do not deny that
they have been translated. If they dislike water drawn from the clear
spring, let them drink of the muddy streamlet, and when they come to
read the Scriptures, let them lay aside <span
id="fr_709"></span>[710](#fn_709.md) the keen eye which they turn on woods
frequented by game-birds and waters abounding in shellfish. Easily
satisfied in this instance alone, let them, if they will, regard the
words of Christ as rude sayings, albeit that over these so many great
intellects have labored for so many ages rather to divine than to
expound the meaning of each single word. Let them charge the great
apostle with want of literary skill, although it is said of him that
much learning made him mad. <span id="fr_710"></span>[711](#fn_710.md)

<span id="v.XXVII-p8"></span>2. I know that as you read these words you
will knit your brows, and fear that my freedom of speech is sowing the
seeds of fresh quarrels; and that, if you could, you would gladly put
your finger on my mouth to prevent me from even speaking of things which
others do not blush to do. But, I ask you, wherein have I used too great
license? Have I ever embellished my dinner plates with engravings of
idols? Have I ever, at a Christian banquet, set before the eyes of
virgins the polluting spectacle of Satyrs embracing bacchanals? or have
I ever assailed any one in too bitter terms? Have I ever complained of
beggars turned millionaires? Have I ever censured heirs for the funerals
which they have given to their benefactors? <span
id="fr_711"></span>[712](#fn_711.md) The one thing that I have
unfortunately said has been that virgins ought to live more in the
company of women than of men, <span id="fr_712"></span>[713](#fn_712.md)
and by this I have made the whole city look scandalized and caused every
one to point at me the finger of scorn. “They that hate me without a
cause are more than the hairs of mine head,” <span
id="fr_713"></span>[714](#fn_713.md) and I am become “a proverb to
them.” <span id="fr_714"></span>[715](#fn_714.md) Do you suppose after this
that I will now say anything rash?

<span id="v.XXVII-p13"></span>3. But “when I set the wheel rolling I
began to form a wine flagon; how comes it that a waterpot is the
result?” <span id="fr_715"></span>[716](#fn_715.md) Lest Horace laugh at me
I come back to my two-legged asses, and din into their ears, not the
music of the lute, but the blare of the trumpet. <span
id="fr_716"></span>[717](#fn_716.md) They may say if they will, “rejoicing
in hope; serving *the time*,” but we will say “rejoicing in hope;
serving *the Lord*.” <span id="fr_717"></span>[718](#fn_717.md) They may
see fit to receive an accusation against a presbyter unconditionally;
but we will say in the words of Scripture, “Against an elder <span
id="fr_718"></span>[719](#fn_718.md) receive not an accusation, *but before
two or three witnesses*. Them that sin rebuke before all.” <span
id="fr_719"></span>[720](#fn_719.md) They may choose to read, “It is *a
man’s* saying, and worthy of all acceptation;” we are content to err
with the Greeks, that is to say with the apostle himself, who spoke
Greek. Our version, therefore, is, it is “a *faithful* saying, and
worthy of all acceptation.” <span id="fr_720"></span>[721](#fn_720.md)
Lastly, let them take as much pleasure as they please in their Gallican
“geldings;” <span id="fr_721"></span>[722](#fn_721.md) we will be satisfied
with the simple “ass” of Zechariah, loosed from its halter and made
ready for the Saviour’s service, which received the Lord on its back,
and so fulfilled Isaiah’s prediction: “Blessed is he that soweth beside
all waters, where the ox and the ass tread under foot.” <span

<span id="v.XXVII-p15"></span> Perhaps an allusion to the Greek proverb,
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.XXVII-p15.1"></span>῎</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.XXVII-p15.2"></span>ονος λύρας ἤκουσε καὶ
σάλπιγγος ὗς</span>. “The ass listened to the lyre, and the pig to the
trumpet.”

The reading <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.XXVII-p16.2"></span>κυρίω</span> “Lord” is probably correct. The
R.V. says, “Some ancient authorities read the opportunity,” (<span
class="Greek"><span id="v.XXVII-p16.3"></span>καιρῷ</span>).

<span id="v.XXVII-p20"></span> Jerome’s detractors suggested this word
instead of the simpler “ass” in [Zech.

21:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#002.md)<span id="v.XXVII-p20.1"></span>.
The phrase “Gallican geldings” appears to be a quotation from Plaut.
Aul. iii. 5, 21.
