<span id="v.CXVIII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.CXVIII-p1.1"></span>Letter CXVIII. To Julian.</span>

<span id="v.CXVIII-p2"></span>Jerome writes to Julian, a wealthy
nobleman apparently of Dalmatia (§5), to console him for the loss of his
wife and two daughters all of whom had recently died. He reminds Julian
of the trials of Job and recommends him to imitate the patience of the
patriarch. He also urges him to follow the example set by Pammachius and
Paulinus, that is, to give up his riches and to become a monk for the
sake of Christ. The date of the letter is 406 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.CXVIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.CXVIII-p3"></span>1. At the very instant of his departure
Ausonius, a son to me as he is a brother to you, gave me a late glimpse
of himself but quickly hurried away again, saying good-morning and
good-bye together. Yet he thought that he would return empty-handed
unless he could bring you some trifle from me however hastily written.
Clothed in scarlet as befitted his rank, he had already strapped on his
sword-belt <span id="fr_3071"></span>[3072](#fn_3071.md) and sent down a
requisition to have a stage-horse saddled. Still he made me send for my
secretary and dictate a letter to him. This I did with such rapidity
that his nimble hand could hardly keep pace with my words or manage to
put down my hurried sentences. Thus hasty dictation has taken the place
of careful writing; and, if I break my long silence, it is but to offer
you an expression of good will. This is an impromptu letter without
logical order or charm of style. You must look on me for once as a
friend only; you will find, I assure you, nothing of the orator here.
Bear in mind that it has been dashed off on the spur of the moment and
given as a provision for the way to one in a hurry to depart.

<span id="v.CXVIII-p5"></span>Holy scripture says: “a tale out of season
is as musick in mourning.” <span id="fr_3072"></span>[3073](#fn_3072.md)
Accordingly I have disdained the graces of rhetoric and those charms of
eloquence which boys find so captivating, and have fallen back on the
serious tone of the sacred writings. For in these are to be found true
medicines for wounds and sure remedies for sorrow. In these a mother
receives back her only son even on the bier. <span
id="fr_3073"></span>[3074](#fn_3073.md) In these a crowd of mourners hears
the words: “the maid is not dead but sleepeth.” <span
id="fr_3074"></span>[3075](#fn_3074.md) In these one that is four days dead
comes forth bound at the call of the Lord. <span
id="fr_3075"></span>[3076](#fn_3075.md)

<span id="v.CXVIII-p10"></span>2. I hear that in a short space of time
you have suffered several bereavements, that you have buried in quick
succession two young unmarried daughters, and that Faustina, most chaste
and loyal of wives, your sister in the fervour of her faith and your one
comfort in the loss of your children, has suddenly fallen asleep and
been taken from you. You have been like a shipwrecked man, who has no
sooner reached the shore than he falls into the hands of brigands, or in
the eloquent language of the prophet like one “who did flee from a lion,
and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the
wall, and a serpent bit him.” <span id="fr_3076"></span>[3077](#fn_3076.md)
Pecuniary losses have followed your bereavements; the entire province
has been overrun by a barbarian enemy, and in the general devastation
your private property has been destroyed, your flocks and herds have
been driven off, and your poor slaves either made prisoners or else
slain. To crown all, your only daughter, made all the more dear to you
by the loss of the others, has for her husband a young nobleman who, to
say nothing worse of him, has given you more occasion for sorrow than
for rejoicing. Such is the list of the trials that have been laid upon
you; such is the conflict waged by the old enemy against Julian a raw
recruit to Christ’s standard. If you look only to yourself your troubles
are indeed great but if you look to the strong Warrior, <span
id="fr_3077"></span>[3078](#fn_3077.md) they are but child’s play and the
conflict is only the semblance of one. After <span id="page_221">p.
221</span> <span id="v.CXVIII-Page_221"></span>untold trials a wicked
wife was still left to the blessed Job, the devil hoping that he might
learn from her to blaspheme God. You on the other hand have been
deprived of an excellent one that you might learn to go without
consolation in the hour of misfortune. Yet it is far harder to put up
with a wife whom you dislike than it is to mourn for one whom you dearly
love. Moreover when Job’s children died they found a common tomb beneath
the ruins of his house, and all he could do to shew his parental
affection was to rend his garments, to fall upon the ground and to
worship, saying: “Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall
I return thither: the Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away: it has
been as the Lord pleased: blessed be the name of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3078"></span>[3079](#fn_3078.md) But you, to put the matter briefly,
have been allowed to perform the obsequies of your dear ones; and those
obsequies have been attended by many respectful kinsmen and comforting
friends. Again Job lost all his wealth at once; and, as, one after
another, the messengers of woe unfolded new calamities, he flinched as
little as the sage of whom Horace writes: <span
id="fr_3079"></span>[3080](#fn_3079.md) —

<span id="v.CXVIII-p15"></span>Shatter the world to atoms if you will.

<span id="v.CXVIII-p16"></span>Fearless will be the man on whom it
falls.

<span id="v.CXVIII-p17"></span>But with you the case is different. The
greater part of your substance has been left to you, and your trials
have not been greater than you can bear. For you have not yet attained
to such perfection that the devil has to marshal all his forces against
you.

<span id="v.CXVIII-p18"></span>3. Long ago this wealthy proprietor and
still wealthier father was made by a sudden stroke destitute and
bereaved. But as, in spite of all that befel him, he had not sinned
before God or spoken foolishly, the Lord—exulting in the victory of his
servant and regarding Job’s patience as His own triumph—said to the
devil: “Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him
in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God and
escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity?” <span
id="fr_3080"></span>[3081](#fn_3080.md) He finely adds the last clause
because it is difficult for innocence to refrain from murmuring when it
is overborne by misfortune; and to avoid making a shipwreck of faith
when it sees that its sufferings are unjustly inflicted. The devil
answered the Lord and said: “Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath
will he give for his life. But put forth thine hand now, and touch his
bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.” <span
id="fr_3081"></span>[3082](#fn_3081.md) See how crafty the adversary is,
and how hardened in sin his evil days have made him! He knows the
difference between things external and internal. He knows that even the
philosophers of the world call the former <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.CXVIII-p20.2"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.CXVIII-p20.3"></span>διάφορα</span>, that is indifferent, and that
the perfection of virtue does not consist in losing or disdaining them.
It is the latter, those that are internal and objects of
preference, <span id="fr_3082"></span>[3083](#fn_3082.md) the loss of which
inevitably causes chagrin. Wherefore he boldly contradicts what God has
said and declares that Job deserves no praise at all; since he has
yielded up no part of himself but only what is outside himself, since he
has given for his own skin the skins of his children, and since he has
but laid down his purse to secure the health of his body. From this your
sagacity may perceive that your trials have so far only reached the
point at which you give hide for hide, skin for skin, and are ready to
give all that you have for your life. The Lord has not yet stretched
forth His hand upon you, or touched your flesh, or broken your bones.
Yet it is when such afflictions as these are laid upon you that it is
hard not to groan and not to ‘bless’ God to His face, that is to curse
Him. The word ‘bless’ is used in the same way in the books of Kings
where it is said of Naboth that he ‘blessed’ God and the king and was
therefore stoned by the people. <span
id="fr_3083"></span>[3084](#fn_3083.md) But the Lord knew His champion and
felt sure that this great hero would even in this last and severest
conflict prove unconquerable. Therefore He said: “Behold he is in thine
hand; but save his life.” <span id="fr_3084"></span>[3085](#fn_3084.md) The
holy man’s flesh is placed at the devil’s disposal, but his vital powers
are withheld. For if the devil had smitten that on which sensation and
mental judgment depend, the guilt arising from a misuse of these
faculties I would have lain at the door not of him who committed the sin
but of him who had overthrown the balance of his mind.

<span id="v.CXVIII-p24"></span>4. Others may praise you if they will,
and celebrate your victories over the devil. They may eulogize you for
the smiling face with which you bore the loss of your daughters, or for
the resolution with which, forty days after they fell asleep, you
exchanged your mourning for a white robe to attend the dedication of a
martyr’s bones; unconcerned for a bereavement which was the concern of
the whole city, and anxious only to share in a martyr’s triumph. Nay,
say they, when you bore your wife to burial, it was not as one dead but
as one setting forth on a journey. But I shall not deceive you with
flattering words or take the ground from under your feet with slippery
praises. Rather will I say what it is good for you to hear: “My son, if
thou come to serve <span id="page_222">p. 222</span> <span
id="v.CXVIII-Page_222"></span>the Lord, prepare thy soul for
temptation,” <span id="fr_3085"></span>[3086](#fn_3085.md) and “when thou
shalt have done all those things which are commanded thee, say, I am an
unprofitable servant; I have done that which was my duty to do.” <span
id="fr_3086"></span>[3087](#fn_3086.md) Say to God: “the children that thou
hast taken from me were Thine own gift. The hand-maiden that Thou hast
taken to Thyself Thou also didst lend to me for a season to be my
solace. I am not aggrieved that Thou hast taken her back, but thankful
rather that Thou hast previously given her to me.”

<span id="v.CXVIII-p27"></span>Once upon a time a rich young man boasted
that he had fulfilled all the requirements of the law, but the Lord said
to him (as we read in the gospel): “One thing thou lackest: if thou wilt
be perfect, go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor;
and come and follow me.” <span id="fr_3087"></span>[3088](#fn_3087.md) He
who declared that he had done all things gave way at the first onset to
the power of riches. Wherefore they who are rich find it hard to enter
the kingdom of heaven, a kingdom which desires for its citizens souls
that soar aloft free from all ties and hindrances. “Go thy way,” the
Lord says, “and sell” not a part of thy substance but “all that thou
hast, and give to the poor;” not to thy friends or kinsfolk or
relatives, not to thy wife or to thy children. I will even go farther
and say: keep back nothing for yourself because you fear to be some day
poor, lest by so doing you share the condemnation of Ananias and
Sapphira; <span id="fr_3088"></span>[3089](#fn_3088.md) but give everything
to the poor and make to yourself friends of the mammon of
unrighteousness that they may receive you into everlasting
habitations. <span id="fr_3089"></span>[3090](#fn_3089.md) Obey the
Master’s injunction “follow me,” <span
id="fr_3090"></span>[3091](#fn_3090.md) and take the Lord of the world for
your possession; that you may be able to sing with the prophet, “The
Lord is my portion,” <span id="fr_3091"></span>[3092](#fn_3091.md) and like
a true Levite <span id="fr_3092"></span>[3093](#fn_3092.md) may possess no
earthly inheritance. I cannot but advise you thus if you wish to be
perfect, if you desire to attain the pinnacle of the apostles’ glory, if
you wish to take up your cross and to follow Christ. When once you have
put your hand to the plough you must not look back; <span
id="fr_3093"></span>[3094](#fn_3093.md) when once you stand on the housetop
you must think no more of your clothes within; to escape your Egyptian
mistress <span id="fr_3094"></span>[3095](#fn_3094.md) you must abandon the
cloak that belongs to this world. Even Elijah, in his quick translation
to heaven could not take his mantle with him, but left in the world the
garments of the world. <span id="fr_3095"></span>[3096](#fn_3095.md) Such
conduct, you will object, is for him who would emulate the apostles, for
the man who aspires to be perfect. But why should not you aspire to be
perfect? Why should not you who hold a foremost place in the world hold
a foremost place also in Christ’s household? Is it because you have been
married? Peter was married too, but when he forsook his ship and his
nets he forsook his wife also. <span
id="fr_3096"></span>[3097](#fn_3096.md) The Lord who wills that all men
shall be saved and prefers the repentance of a sinner to his death <span
id="fr_3097"></span>[3098](#fn_3097.md) has, in His almighty providence,
removed from you this excuse. Your wife can no longer draw you
earthwards, but you can follow her as she draws you heavenwards. Provide
good things for your children who have gone home before you to the Lord.
Do not let their portions go to swell their sister’s fortune, but use
them to ransom your own soul and to give sustenance to the needy. These
are the necklaces your daughters expect from you; these are the jewels
they wish to see sparkle on their foreheads. The money which they would
have wasted in buying silks may well be considered saved when it
provides cheap clothing for the poor. They ask you for their portions.
Now that they are united to their spouse they are loth to appear poor
and undistinguished: they desire to have the ornaments that befit their
rank.

<span id="v.CXVIII-p39"></span>5. Nor may you excuse yourself on the
score of your noble station and the responsibilities of wealth. Look at
Pammachius and at Paulinus that presbyter of glowing faith both of whom
have offered to the Lord not only their riches but themselves. In spite
of the devil and his shuffling they have by no means given skin for
skin, but have consecrated their own flesh and bones, yea and their very
souls unto the Lord. Surely these may lead you to higher things both by
their example and by their preaching, that is, by their deeds and words.
You are of noble birth, so are they: but in Christ they are made nobler
still. You are rich and held in repute, so once were they: but now
instead of being rich and held in repute they are poor and obscure, yet,
because it is for Christ’s sake, they are really richer and more famous
than ever. You too, it is true, shew yourself beneficent, you are said
to minister to the wants of the saints, to entertain monks, and to
present large sums of money to churches. This however is only the a b c
of your soldiership. You despise money; the world’s philosophers have
done the same. One of these <span id="fr_3098"></span>[3099](#fn_3098.md)
—to say nothing of the rest—cast the price of many possessions into the
sea, saying as he did so “To the bottom with you, ye provokers of evil
lusts. I shall drown you in the sea that you may never drown me in sin.”
If then a philosopher—a creature of <span id="page_223">p. 223</span>
<span id="v.CXVIII-Page_223"></span>vanity whom popular applause can buy
and sell—laid down all his burthen at once, how can you think that you
have reached virtue’s crowning height when you have yielded up but a
portion of yours? It is you yourself that the Lord wishes for, “a living
sacrifice…acceptable unto God.” <span
id="fr_3099"></span>[3100](#fn_3099.md) Yourself, I say, and not what you
have. And therefore, as he trained Israel by subjecting it to many
plagues and afflictions, so does He now admonish you by sending you
trials of different kinds. “For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and
scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.” <span
id="fr_3100"></span>[3101](#fn_3100.md) The poor widow did but cast two
mites into the treasury; yet because she cast in all that she had it is
said of her that she surpassed all the rich in offering gifts to
God. <span id="fr_3101"></span>[3102](#fn_3101.md) Such gifts are valued
not by their weight but by the good-will with which they are made. You
may have spent your substance upon numbers of people, and a portion of
your fellows may have reason to rejoice in your bounty; yet those who
have received nothing at your hands are still more numerous. Neither the
wealth of Darius nor the riches of Crœsus would suffice to satisfy the
wants of the world’s poor. But if you once give yourself to the Lord and
resolve to follow the Saviour in the perfection of apostolic virtue,
then you will come to see what your place has hitherto been, and how you
have lagged in the rear of Christ’s army. Hardly had you begun to mourn
for your dead daughters when the fear of Christ dried the tears of
paternal affection upon your cheeks. It was a great triumph of faith,
true. But how much greater was that won by Abraham who was content to
slay his only son, of whom he had been told that he was to inherit the
world, yet did not cease to hope that after death Isaac would live
again. <span id="fr_3102"></span>[3103](#fn_3102.md) Jephthah too offered
up his virgin daughter, and for this is placed by the apostle in the
roll of the saints. <span id="fr_3103"></span>[3104](#fn_3103.md) I would
not therefore have you offer to the Lord only what a thief may steal
from you or an enemy fall upon, or a proscription confiscate, what is
liable to fluctuations in value now going up and now down, what belongs
to a succession of masters who follow each other as fast as in the sea
wave follows wave, and—to say everything in a word—what, whether you
like it or not, you must leave behind you when you die. Rather offer to
God that which no enemy can carry off and no tyrant take from you, which
will go down with you into the grave, nay on to the kingdom of heaven
and the enchantments of paradise. You already build monasteries and
support in the various islands of Dalmatia a large number of holy men.
But you would do better still if you were to live among these holy men
as a holy man yourself. “Be ye holy, saith the Lord, for I am
holy.” <span id="fr_3104"></span>[3105](#fn_3104.md) The apostles boasted
that they had left all things and had followed the Saviour. <span
id="fr_3105"></span>[3106](#fn_3105.md) We do not read that they left
anything except their ship and their nets; yet they were crowned with
the approval of Him who was to be their judge. Why? Because in offering
up themselves they had indeed left all that they had.

<span id="v.CXVIII-p48"></span>6. I say all this not in disparagement of
your good works or because I wish to under-rate your generosity in
almsgiving, but because I do not wish you to be a monk among men of the
world and a man of the world among monks. I shall require every
sacrifice of you for I hear that your mind is devoted to the service of
God. If some friend, or follower, or kinsman tries to combat this
counsel of mine and to recall you to the pleasures of a handsome table,
be sure that he is thinking less of your soul than of his own belly, and
remember that death in a moment terminates both elegant entertainments
and all other pleasures provided by wealth. Within the short space of
twenty days you have lost two daughters, the one eight years old and the
other six; and do you suppose that one so old as you are yourself can
live much longer? David tells you how long a time you can look for: “the
days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of
strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and
sorrow.” <span id="fr_3106"></span>[3107](#fn_3106.md) Happy is he and to
be held worthy of the highest bliss whom old age shall find a servant of
Christ and whom the last day shall discover fighting for the Saviour’s
cause. “He shall not be ashamed when he speaketh with his enemies in the
gate.” <span id="fr_3107"></span>[3108](#fn_3107.md) On his entrance into
paradise it shall be said to him: “thou in thy lifetime receivedst evil
things but nowhere thou art comforted.” <span
id="fr_3108"></span>[3109](#fn_3108.md) The Lord will not avenge the same
sin twice. Lazarus, formerly poor and full of ulcers, whose sores the
dogs licked and who barely managed to live, poor wretch, on the crumbs
that fell from the rich man’s table, is now welcomed into Abraham’s
bosom and has the joy of finding a father in the great patriarch. It is
difficult nay impossible for a man to enjoy both the good things of the
present and those of the future, to satisfy his belly here and his mind
yonder, to pass from the pleasures of this life to the pleasures of
that, to be first in both worlds, and to be held in honour both on earth
and in heaven.

<span id="v.CXVIII-p52"></span>7. And if in your secret thoughts you are
troubled because I who give you this advice am not myself what I desire
you to be, and <span id="page_224">p. 224</span> <span
id="v.CXVIII-Page_224"></span>because you have seen some after beginning
well fall midway on their journey; I shall briefly plead in reply that
the words which I speak are not mine but those of the Lord and Saviour,
and that I urge upon you not the standard which is possible to myself
but the ideal which every true servant of Christ must wish for and
realize. Athletes as a rule are stronger than their backers; yet the
weaker presses the stronger to put forth all his efforts. Look not upon
Judas denying his Lord but upon Paul confessing Him. Jacob’s father was
a man of great wealth; yet, when Jacob went to Mesopotamia, he went
alone and destitute leaning upon his staff. When he felt weary he had to
lie down by the wayside and, delicately nurtured as he had been by his
mother Rebekah, was forced to content himself with a stone for a pillow.
Yet it was then <span id="fr_3109"></span>[3110](#fn_3109.md) that he saw
the ladder set up from earth to heaven, and the angels ascending and
descending on it, and the Lord above it holding out a helping hand to
such as fall and encouraging the climbers to fresh efforts by the vision
of Himself. Therefore is the spot called Bethel or the house of God; for
there day by day there is ascending and descending. When they are
careless, even holy men lose their footing; and sinners, if they wash
away their stains with tears regain their place. I say this not that
those coming down may frighten you but that those going up may stimulate
you. For evil can never supply a model and even in worldly affairs
incentives to virtue come always from the brighter side.

<span id="v.CXVIII-p54"></span>But I have forgotten my purpose and the
limits set to my letter. I should have liked to say a great deal more.
Indeed all that I can say is inadequate alike to satisfy the seriousness
of the subject and the claims of your rank. But here is our Ausonius
beginning to be impatient for the sheets, hurrying the secretaries, and
in his impatience at the neighing of his horse, accusing my poor wits of
slowness. Remember me, then, and prosper in Christ. And one thing more;
follow the example set you at home by the holy Vera, <span
id="fr_3110"></span>[3111](#fn_3110.md) who like a true follower of Christ
does not fear to endure the hardships of pilgrimage. Find in a woman
your ‘leader in this high emprise.’ <span
