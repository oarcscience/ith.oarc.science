<span id="v.XV-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XV-p1.1"></span>Letter XV. To Pope Damasus.</span>

<span id="v.XV-p2"></span>This letter, written in 376 or 377 <span
class="c17"><span id="v.XV-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>, illustrates
Jerome’s attitude towards the see of Rome at this time held by Damasus,
afterwards his warm friend and admirer. Referring to Rome as the scene
of his own baptism and as a church where the true faith has remained
unimpaired (§1), and laying down the strict doctrine of salvation only
within the pale of the church (§2), Jerome asks “the successor of the
fisherman” two questions, viz.: (1) who is the true bishop of the three
claimants of the see of Antioch, and (2) which is the correct
terminology, to speak of three “hypostases” in the Godhead, or of one?
On the latter question he expresses fully his own opinion.

<span id="v.XV-p3"></span>1. Since the East, shattered as it is by the
long-standing feuds, subsisting between its peoples, is bit by bit
tearing into shreds the seamless vest of the Lord, “woven from the top
throughout,” <span id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) since the foxes are
destroying the vineyard of Christ, <span
id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) and since among the broken cisterns
that hold no water it is hard to discover “the sealed fountain” and “the
garden inclosed,” <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) I think it my
duty to consult the chair of Peter, and to turn to a church whose faith
has been praised by Paul. <span id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) I
appeal for spiritual food to the church whence I have received the garb
of Christ. <span id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) The wide space of sea
and land that lies between us cannot deter me from searching for “the
pearl of great price.” <span id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md)
“Wheresoever the body is, there will the eagles be gathered
together.” <span id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md) Evil children have
squandered their patrimony; you alone keep your heritage intact. The
fruitful soil of Rome, when it receives the pure seed of the Lord, bears
fruit an hundredfold; but here the seed corn is choked in the furrows
and nothing grows but darnel or oats. <span
id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) In the West the Sun of
righteousness <span id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) is even now
rising; in the East, Lucifer, who fell from heaven, <span
id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269.md) has once more set his throne above the
stars. <span id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270.md) “Ye are the light of the
world,” <span id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271.md) “ye are the salt of the
earth,” <span id="fr_272"></span>[273](#fn_272.md) ye are “vessels of gold
and of silver.” Here are vessels of wood or of earth, <span
id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273.md) which wait for the rod of iron, <span
id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274.md) and eternal fire.

<span id="v.XV-p19"></span>2. Yet, though your greatness terrifies me,
your kindness attracts me. From the priest I demand the safe-keeping of
the victim, from the shepherd the protection due to the sheep. Away with
all that is overweening; let the state of Roman majesty withdraw. My
words are spoken to the successor of the fisherman, to the disciple of
the cross. As I follow no leader save Christ, so I communicate with none
but your blessedness, that is with the chair of Peter. For this, I know,
is the rock on which the church is built! <span
id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md) This is the house where alone the
paschal lamb can be rightly eaten. <span
id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md) This is the ark of Noah, and he who is
not found in it shall perish when the flood prevails. <span
id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md) But since by reason of my sins I have
betaken myself to this desert which lies between Syria and the
uncivilized waste, I cannot, owing to the great distance between us,
always ask of your sanctity the holy thing of the Lord. <span
id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md) Con<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>
<span id="v.XV-Page_19"></span>sequently I here follow the Egyptian
confessors <span id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md) who share your faith,
and anchor my frail craft under the shadow of their great argosies. I
know nothing of Vitalis; I reject Meletius; I have nothing to do with
Paulinus. <span id="fr_280"></span>[281](#fn_280.md) He that gathers not
with you scatters; <span id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md) he that is
not of Christ is of Antichrist.

<span id="v.XV-p27"></span>3. Just now, I am sorry to say, those Arians,
the Campenses, <span id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md) are trying to
extort from me, a Roman Christian, their unheard-of formula of three
hypostases. <span id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283.md) And this, too, after
the definition of Nicæa <span id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284.md) and the
decree of Alexandria, <span id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285.md) in which
the West has joined. Where, I should like to know, are the apostles of
these doctrines? Where is their Paul, their new doctor of the Gentiles?
I ask them what three hypostases are supposed to mean. They reply three
persons subsisting. I rejoin that this is my belief. They are not
satisfied with the meaning, they demand the term. Surely some secret
venom lurks in the words. “If any man refuse,” I cry, “to acknowledge
three hypostases in the sense of three things hypostatized, that is
three persons subsisting, let him be anathema.” Yet, because I do not
learn their words, I am counted a heretic. “But, if any one,
understanding by hypostasis essence, <span
id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286.md) deny that in the three persons there
is one hypostasis, he has no part in Christ.” Because this is my
confession I, like you, am branded with the stigma of
Sabellianism. <span id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287.md)

<span id="v.XV-p34"></span>4. If you think fit enact a decree; and then
I shall not hesitate to speak of three hypostases. Order a new creed to
supersede the Nicene; and then, whether we are Arians or orthodox, one
confession will do for us all. In the whole range of secular learning
hypostasis never means anything but essence. And can any one, I ask, be
so profane as to speak of three essences or substances in the Godhead?
There is one nature of God and one only; and this, and this alone, truly
*is.* For absolute being is derived from no other source but is all its
own. All things besides, that is all things created, although they
appear to be, are not. For there was a time when they were not, and that
which once was not may again cease to be. God alone who is eternal, that
is to say, who has no beginning, really deserves to be called an
essence. Therefore also He says to Moses from the bush, “I am that I
am,” and Moses says of Him, “I am hath sent me.” <span
id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288.md) As the angels, the sky, the earth, the
seas, all existed at the time, it must have been as the absolute being
that God claimed for himself that name of essence, which apparently was
common to all. But because His nature alone is perfect, and because in
the three persons there subsists but one Godhead, which truly is and is
one nature; whosoever in the name of religion declares that there are in
the Godhead three elements, three hypostases, that is, or essences, is
striving really to predicate three natures of God. And if this is true,
why are we severed by walls from Arius, when in dishonesty we are one
with him? Let Ursicinus be made the colleague of your blessedness; let
Auxentius be associated with Ambrose. <span
id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289.md) But may the faith of Rome never come
to such a pass! May the devout hearts of your people never be infected
with such unholy doctrines! Let us be satisfied to speak of one
substance and of three subsisting persons—perfect, equal, coeternal. Let
us keep to one hypostasis, if such be your pleasure, and say nothing of
three. It is a bad sign when those who mean the same thing use different
words. Let us be satisfied with the form of creed which we have hitherto
used. Or, if you think it right that I should speak of three hypostases,
explaining what I mean by them, I am ready to submit. But, believe me,
there is poison hidden under their honey; the angel of Satan has
transformed himself into an angel of light. <span
id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290.md) They give a plausible explanation of
the term hypostasis; yet when I profess to hold it in the same sense
they count me a heretic. Why are they so tenacious of a word? Why do
they shelter themselves under ambiguous language? If their belief
corresponds to their explanation of it, I do not condemn them for
keeping it. On the other hand, if <span id="page_20">p. 20</span> <span
id="v.XV-Page_20"></span>my belief corresponds to their expressed
opinions, they should allow me to set forth their meaning in my own
words.

<span id="v.XV-p38"></span>5. I implore your blessedness, therefore, by
the crucified Saviour of the world, and by the consubstantial trinity,
to authorize me by letter either to use or to refuse this formula of
three hypostases. And lest the obscurity of my present abode may baffle
the bearers of your letter, I pray you to address it to Evagrius, the
presbyter, with whom you are well acquainted. I beg you also to signify
with whom I am to communicate at Antioch. Not, I hope, with the
Campenses; <span id="fr_291"></span>[292](#fn_291.md) for they—with their
allies the heretics of Tarsus <span id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292.md)
—only desire communion with you to preach with greater authority their
traditional doctrine of three hypostases.

so called because, denied access to the churches of the city, they had
to worship in the open air outside the walls.

id="v.XV-p29.1"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span

in [Heb. i. 3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md)<span
id="v.XV-p29.3"></span>, “The express image of his person \[R.V.
substance\].” Except at Alexandria it was usual to speak of one
*hypostasis* as of one *ousia* in the Divine Nature. But at Alexandria
from Origen downwards three hypostases had been ascribed to the Deity.
Two explanations are given of the latter formula: (1) That at Alexandria
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.XV-p29.4"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.XV-p29.5"></span>πόστασις</span> was taken in
the sense of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.XV-p29.6"></span>πρόσωπον</span>, so that by “three hypostases”
was meant only “three persons.” (2) That “three hypostases” was an
inexact expression standing for “three hypostatic persons” or “a
threefold hypostasis.” This latter seems to be the true account of the
matter. See an interesting note in Newman, Arians of the Fourth Century,
Appendix IV.
