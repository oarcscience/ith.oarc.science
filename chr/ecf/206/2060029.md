id="v.XVIII-p1.1"></span>Letter XVIII. To Pope Damasus.</span>

<span id="v.XVIII-p2"></span>This (written from Constantinople in <span
class="c17"><span id="v.XVIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 381) is the
earliest of Jerome’s expository letters. In it he explains at length the
vision recorded in the sixth chapter of Isaiah, and enlarges upon its
mystical meaning. “Some of my predecessors,” he writes, “make ‘the Lord
sitting upon a throne’ God the Father, and suppose the seraphim to
represent the Son and the Holy Spirit. I do not agree with them, for
John expressly tells us <span id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325) that it
was Christ and not the Father whom the prophet saw.” And again, “The
word seraphim means either ‘glow’ or ‘beginning of speech,’ and the two
seraphim thus stand for the Old and New Testaments. <span
id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326) ‘Did not our heart burn within us,’
said the disciples, ‘while he opened to us the Scriptures?’ <span
id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327) Moreover, the Old Testament is written
in Hebrew, and this unquestionably was man’s original language.” Jerome
then speaks of the unity of the sacred books. “Whatever,” he asserts,
“we read in the Old Testament we find also in the Gospel; and what we
read in the Gospel is deduced from the Old Testament. <span
id="fr_328"></span>[329](#fn_328) There is no discord between them, no
disagreement. In both Testaments the Trinity is preached.”

<span id="v.XVIII-p7"></span>The letter is noticeable for the evidence
it affords of the thoroughness of Jerome’s studies. Not only does he
cite the several Greek versions of Isaiah in support of his argument,
but he also reverts to the Hebrew original. So far as the West was
concerned he may be said to have discovered this anew. Even educated men
like Augustine had ceased to look beyond the LXX., and were more or less
aghast at the boldness with which Jerome rejected its time-honored but
inaccurate renderings. <span id="fr_329"></span>[330](#fn_329)

<span id="v.XVIII-p9"></span>The letter also shows that independence of
judgment which always marked Jerome’s work. At the time when he wrote it
he was much under the sway of Origen. But great as was his admiration
for the master, he was not afraid to discard his exegesis when, as in
the case of the seraphim, he believed it to be erroneous.
