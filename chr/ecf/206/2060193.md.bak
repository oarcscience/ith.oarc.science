<span id="vii.iii.iv"></span>

<span id="vii.iii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>The Books of Samuel and Kings.</span>

<span id="vii.iii.iv-p2"></span>This Preface was the first in order of
publication. It was set forth as an exposition of the principles adopted
by Jerome in all his translations from the Hebrew—the “Helmeted
Preface,” as he calls it in the beginning of the last paragraph, with
which he was prepared to do battle against all who impugn his design and
methods. It was addressed to Paula and Eustochium, and published about
<span class="c17"><span id="vii.iii.iv-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 391.

<span id="vii.iii.iv-p3"></span>That the Hebrews have twenty-two letters
is testified by the Syrian and Chaldæan languages which are nearly
related to the Hebrew, for they have twenty-two elementary sounds which
are pronounced the same way, but are differently written. The Samaritans
also employ just the same number of letters in their copies of the
Pentateuch of Moses, and differ only in the shape and outline of the
letters. And it is certain that Esdras, the scribe and teacher of the
law, after the capture of Jerusalem and the restoration of the temple by
Zerubbabel, invented <span id="fr_5391"></span>[5392](#fn_5391.md) other
letters which we now use, although up to that time the Samaritan and
Hebrew characters were the same. In the <span
id="fr_5392"></span>[5393](#fn_5392.md) book of Numbers, also, where we
have the census of the Levites and priests, the mystic teaching of
Scripture conducts us to the same result. And we find the four-lettered
name of the Lord in certain Greek books written to this day in the
ancient characters. The thirty-seventh Psalm, moreover, the one hundred
and eleventh, the one hundred and twelfth, the one hundred and
nineteenth, and the one hundred and forty-fifth, although they are
written in different metres, have for their <span
id="fr_5393"></span>[5394](#fn_5393.md) acrostic framework an alphabet of
the same number of letters. The Lamentations of Jeremiah, and his
Prayer, the Proverbs of Solomon also, towards the end, from the place
where we read “Who will find a brave woman?” are instances of the same
number of letters forming the division into sections. And, again, five
are double letters, viz., *Caph*, *Mem*, *Nun*, *Phe*, *Sade*, for at
the beginning and in the middle of words they are written one way, and
at the end another way. Whence it happens that, by most people, five of
the books are reckoned as double, viz., Samuel, Kings, Chronicles, Ezra,
Jeremiah, with *Kinoth, i.e*., his Lamentations. As, then, there are
twenty-two elementary characters by means of which we write in Hebrew
all we say, and the compass of the human voice is contained within their
limits, so we reckon twenty-two books, by which, as by the alphabet of
the doctrine of God, a righteous man is instructed in tender infancy,
and, as it were, while still at the breast.

<span id="vii.iii.iv-p7"></span>The first of these books is called
*Bresith*, to which we give the name Genesis. The second, *Elle Smoth*,
which bears the name Exodus; the third, *Vaiecra*, that is Leviticus;
the fourth, *Vaiedabber*, which we call Numbers; the fifth, *Elle
Addabarim*, which is entitled Deuteronomy. These are the five books of
Moses, which they properly call <span
id="fr_5394"></span>[5395](#fn_5394.md) *Thorath*, that is *law*.

<span id="vii.iii.iv-p9"></span>The second class is composed of the
Prophets, and they begin with *Jesus* the son of Nave, who among them is
called Joshua the son of Nun. Next in the series is *Sophtim*, that is
the book of Judges; and in the same book they include Ruth, because the
events narrated occurred in the days of the Judges. Then comes Samuel,
which we call First and Second Kings. The fourth is *Malachim*, that is,
Kings, which is contained in the third and fourth volumes of Kings. And
it is far better to say *Malachim*, that is Kings, than *Malachoth*,
that is Kingdoms. For the author does not describe the Kingdoms of many
nations, but that of one people, the people of Israel, which is
comprised in the twelve tribes. The fifth is Isaiah, the sixth, <span
id="page_490">p. 490</span> <span
id="vii.iii.iv-Page_490"></span>Jeremiah, the seventh, Ezekiel, the
eighth is the book of the Twelve Prophets, which is called among the
Jews <span id="fr_5395"></span>[5396](#fn_5395.md) *Thare Asra*.

<span id="vii.iii.iv-p11"></span>To the third class belong the
*Hagiographa*, of which the first book begins with Job, the second with
David, whose writings they divide into five parts and comprise in one
volume of Psalms; the third is Solomon, in three books, Proverbs, which
they call *Parables*, that is *Masaloth*, Ecclesiastes, that is
*Coeleth*, the Song of Songs, which they denote by the title *Sir
Assirim*; the sixth is Daniel; the seventh, *Dabre Aiamim*, that is,
*Words of Days*, which we may more expressively call a chronicle of the
whole of the sacred history, the book that amongst us is called First
and Second <span id="fr_5396"></span>[5397](#fn_5396.md) Chronicles; the
eighth, Ezra, which itself is likewise divided amongst Greeks and Latins
into <span id="fr_5397"></span>[5398](#fn_5397.md) two books; the ninth is
Esther.

<span id="vii.iii.iv-p14"></span>And so there are also twenty-two books
of the Old Testament; that is, five of Moses, eight of the prophets,
nine of the Hagiographa, though some include Ruth and Kinoth
(Lamentations) amongst the Hagiographa, and think that these books ought
to be reckoned separately; we should thus have twenty-four books of the
old law. And these the Apocalypse of John represents by the twenty-four
elders, who adore the Lamb, and with downcast looks offer their crowns,
while in their presence stand the four living creatures with eyes before
and behind, that is, looking to the past and the future, and with
unwearied voice crying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, who wast,
and art, and art to come.

<span id="vii.iii.iv-p15"></span>This preface to the Scriptures may
serve as a “helmeted” introduction to all the books which we turn from
Hebrew into Latin, so that we may be assured that what is not found in
our list must be placed amongst the Apocryphal writings. Wisdom,
therefore, which generally bears the name of Solomon, and the book of
Jesus, the Son of Sirach, and Judith, and Tobias, and the Shepherd are
not in the canon. The first book of Maccabees I have found to be Hebrew,
the second is Greek, as can be proved from the very style. Seeing that
all this is so, I beseech you, my reader, not to think that my labours
are in any sense intended to disparage the old translators. For the
service of the tabernacle of God each one offers what he can; some gold
and silver and precious stones, others linen and blue and purple and
scarlet; we shall do well if we offer skins and goats’ hair. And yet the
Apostle pronounces our more contemptible parts more necessary than
others. Accordingly, the beauty of the tabernacle as a whole and in its
several kinds (and the ornaments of the church present and future) was
covered with skins and goats’-hair cloths, and the heat of the sun and
the injurious rain were warded off by those things which are of less
account. First read, then, my Samuel and Kings; mine, I say, mine. For
whatever by diligent translation and by anxious emendation we have
learnt and made our own, is ours. And when you understand that whereof
you were before ignorant, either, if you are grateful, reckon me a
translator, or, if ungrateful, a paraphraser, albeit I am not in the
least conscious of having deviated from the Hebrew original. At all
events, if you are incredulous, read the Greek and Latin manuscripts and
compare them with these poor efforts of mine, and wherever you see they
disagree, ask some Hebrew (though you ought rather to place confidence
in me), and if he confirm our view, I suppose you will not think him a
soothsayer and suppose that he and I have, in rendering the same
passage, divined alike. But I ask you also, the <span
id="fr_5398"></span>[5399](#fn_5398.md) handmaidens of Christ, who anoint
the head of your reclining Lord with the most precious ointment of
faith, who by no means seek the Saviour in the tomb, for whom Christ has
long since ascended to the Father—I beg you to confront with the shields
of your prayers the mad dogs who bark and rage against me, and go about
the city, and think themselves learned if they disparage others. I,
knowing my lowliness, will always remember what we are told. <span
id="fr_5399"></span>[5400](#fn_5399.md) “I said, I will take heed to my
ways that I offend not in my tongue. I have set a guard upon my mouth
while the sinner standeth against me. I became dumb, and was humbled,
and kept silence from good words.”
