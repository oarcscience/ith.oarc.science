<span id="v.XLII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XLII-p1.1"></span>Letter XLII. To Marcella.</span>

<span id="v.XLII-p2"></span>At Marcella’s request Jerome explains to her
what is “the sin against the Holy Ghost” spoken of by Christ, and shows
Novatian’s <span id="fr_891"></span>[892](#fn_891) explanation of it to
be untenable. Written at Rome in 385 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XLII-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.XLII-p4"></span>1. The question you send is short and the
answer is clear. There is this passage in the gospel: “Whosoever
speaketh a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but
whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him
neither in this world nor in the world to come.” <span
id="fr_892"></span>[893](#fn_892) Now if Novatian affirms that none but
Christian renegades can sin against the Holy Ghost, it is plain that the
Jews who blasphemed Christ were not guilty of this sin. Yet they were
wicked husbandmen, they had slain the prophets, they were then
compassing the death of the Lord; <span
id="fr_893"></span>[894](#fn_893) and so utterly lost were they that the
Son of God told them that it was they whom he had come to save. <span
id="fr_894"></span>[895](#fn_894) It must be proved to Novatian,
therefore, that the sin which shall never be forgiven is not the
blasphemy of men disembowelled by torture who in their agony deny their
Lord, but is the captious clamor of those who, while they see that God’s
works are the fruit of virtue, ascribe the virtue to a demon and declare
the signs wrought to belong not to the divine excellence but to the
devil. And this is the whole gist of our Saviour’s argument, when He
teaches that Satan cannot be cast out by Satan, and that his kingdom is
not divided against itself. <span id="fr_895"></span>[896](#fn_895) If
it is the devil’s object to injure God’s creation, how can he wish to
cure the sick and to expel himself from the bodies possessed by him? Let
Novatian prove that of those who have been compelled to sacrifice before
a judge’s tribu<span id="page_57">p. 57</span> <span
id="v.XLII-Page_57"></span>nal any has declared of the things written in
the gospel that they were wrought not by the Son of God but by
Beelzebub, the prince of the devils; <span
id="fr_896"></span>[897](#fn_896) and then he will be able to make good
his contention that this <span id="fr_897"></span>[898](#fn_897) is the
blasphemy against the Holy Ghost which shall never be forgiven.

<span id="v.XLII-p11"></span>2. But to put a more searching question
still: let Novatian tell us how he distinguishes speaking against the
Son of Man from blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. For I maintain that on
his principles men who have denied Christ under persecution have only
spoken against the Son of Man, and have not blasphemed the Holy Ghost.
For when a man is asked if he is a Christian, and declares that he is
not; obviously in denying Christ, that is the Son of Man, he does no
despite to the Holy Ghost. But if his denial of Christ involves a denial
of the Holy Ghost, this heretic can perhaps tell us how the Son of Man
can be denied without sinning against the Holy Ghost. If he thinks that
we are here intended by the term Holy Ghost to understand the Father, no
mention at all of the Father is made by the denier in his denial. When
the apostle Peter, taken aback by a maid’s question, denied the Lord,
did he sin against the Son of Man or against the Holy Ghost? If Novatian
absurdly twists Peter’s words, “I know not the man,” <span
id="fr_898"></span>[899](#fn_898) to mean a denial not of Christ’s
Messiahship but of His humanity, he will make the Saviour a liar, for He
foretold <span id="fr_899"></span>[900](#fn_899) that He Himself, that
is His divine Sonship, must be denied. Now, when Peter denied the Son of
God, he wept bitterly and effaced his threefold denial by a threefold
confession. <span id="fr_900"></span>[901](#fn_900) His sin, therefore,
was not the sin against the Holy Ghost which can never be forgiven. It
is obvious, then, that this sin involves blasphemy, calling one
Beelzebub for his actions, whose virtues prove him to be God. If
Novatian can bring an instance of a renegade who has called Christ
Beelzebub, I will at once give up my position and admit that after such
a fall the denier can win no forgiveness. To give way under torture and
to deny oneself to be a Christian is one thing, to say that Christ is
the devil is another. And this you will yourself see if you read the
passage <span id="fr_901"></span>[902](#fn_901) attentively.

<span id="v.XLII-p16"></span>3. I ought to have discussed the matter
more fully, but some friends have visited my humble abode, and I cannot
refuse to give myself up to them. Still, as it might seem arrogant not
to answer you at once, I have compressed a wide subject into a few
words, and have sent you not a letter but an explanatory note. <span

id="v.XLII-p2.1"></span>

<span id="v.XLII-p3"></span> Novatian, a Roman presbyter in the middle
of the third century, held that the “lapsed,” who had failed during the
persecutions, could not be readmitted to the church. His sect upheld an
extreme moral puritanism, as is shown in the speech of Constantine to
their bishop at the Council of Nicæa: “Acesius, you should set up a
ladder to heaven, and go up by yourself alone.”
