<span id="vii.iv.xi-p2"></span>*The Commentary on Daniel was dedicated
to Pammachius and Marcella in the year 407. It is in a single book, and
is aimed at the criticisms of Porphyry, who, like most modern critics,
took the predictions in the Book of Daniel as relating to the time of
Antiochus Epiphanes and the Maccabees, and written near that date. The
Preface is very similar to that prefixed to the Vulgate translation of
Daniel.*
