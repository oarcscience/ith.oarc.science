id="vii.iii.i-p1.1"></span>Prefaces to the Books of the Vulgate Version
of the Old Testament.</span>

<span id="vii.iii.i-p2"></span>This version was not undertaken with
ecclesiastical sanction as was the case with the Gospels, but at the
request of private friends, or from Jerome’s “own sense of the imperious
necessity of the work.” It was wholly made at Bethlehem, and was begun
about <span class="c17"><span id="vii.iii.i-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>
391, and finished about <span class="c17"><span
id="vii.iii.i-p2.2"></span>a.d.</span> 404. The approximate dates of the
several books are given before each Preface in the following pages.
