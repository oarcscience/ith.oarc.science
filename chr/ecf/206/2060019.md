<span id="v.VIII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.VIII-p1.1"></span>Letter VIII. To Niceas, Sub-Deacon of
Aquileia.</span>

<span id="v.VIII-p2"></span>Niceas, the sub-deacon, had accompanied
Jerome to the East but had now returned home. In after-years he became
bishop of Aquileia in succession to Chromatius. The date of the letter
is 374 <span class="c17"><span id="v.VIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.VIII-p3"></span>The comic poet Turpilius <span
id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) says of the exchange of letters that
it alone makes the absent present. The remark, though occurring in a
work of fiction, is not untrue. For what more real presence—if I may so
speak—can there be between absent friends than speaking to those whom
they love in letters, and in letters hearing their reply? Even those
Italian savages, the Cascans of Ennius, who—as Cicero tells us in his
books on rhetoric—hunted their food like beasts of prey, were wont,
before paper and parchment came into use, to exchange letters written on
tablets of wood roughly planed, or on strips of bark torn from the
trees. For this reason men called letter-carriers tablet-bearers, <span
id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) and letter-writers bark-users, <span
id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) because they used the bark of trees.
How much more then are we, who live in a civilized age, bound not to
omit a social duty performed by men who lived in a state of gross
savagery, and were in some respects entirely ignorant of the refinements
of life. The saintly Chromatius, look you, and the reverend Eusebius,
brothers as much by compatibility of disposition as by the ties of
nature, have challenged me to diligence by the letters which they have
showered upon me. You, however, who have but just left me, have not
merely unknit our new-made friendship; you have torn it asunder—a
process which Lælius, in Cicero’s treatise, <span
id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md) wisely forbids. Can it be that the
East is so hateful to you that you dread the thought of even your
letters coming hither? Wake up, wake up, arouse yourself from sleep,
give to affection at least one sheet of paper. Amid the pleasures of
life at home sometimes heave a sigh over the journeys which we have made
together. If you love me, write in answer to my prayer. If you are angry
with me, though angry still write. I find my longing soul much comforted
when I receive a letter from a friend, even though that friend be out of
temper with me.
