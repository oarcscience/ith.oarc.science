<span id="v.LIV-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.LIV-p1.1"></span>Letter LIV. To Furia.</span>

<span id="v.LIV-p2"></span>A letter of guidance to a widow on the best
means of preserving her widowhood (according to Jerome ‘the second of
the three degrees of chastity’). Furia had at one time thought of
marrying again but eventually abandoned her intention and devoted
herself to the care of her young children and her aged father. Jerome
draws a vivid picture of the dangers to which she is exposed at Rome,
lays down rules of conduct for her guidance, and commends her to the
care of the presbyter Exuperius (afterwards bishop of Toulouse). The
date of the letter is 394 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.LIV-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.LIV-p3"></span>1. You beg and implore me in your letter to
write to you—or rather write back to you—what mode of life you ought to
adopt to preserve the crown of widowhood and to keep your reputation for
chastity unsullied. My mind rejoices, my reins exult, and my heart is
glad that you desire to be after marriage what your mother Titiana of
holy memory was for a long time in marriage. <span
id="fr_1538"></span>[1539](#fn_1538.md) Her prayers and supplications are
heard. She has succeeded in winning afresh in her only daughter that
which she herself when living possessed. It is a high privilege of your
family that from the time of Camillus <span
id="fr_1539"></span>[1540](#fn_1539.md) few or none of your house are
described as contracting second marriages. Therefore it will not redound
so much to your praise if you continue a widow as to your shame if being
a Christian you fail <span id="page_103">p. 103</span> <span
id="v.LIV-Page_103"></span>to keep what heathen women have jealously
guarded for so many centuries.

<span id="v.LIV-p6"></span>2. I say nothing of Paula and Eustochium, the
fairest flowers of your stock; for, as my object is to exhort you, I do
not wish it to appear that I am praising them. Blæsilla too I pass over
who following her husband—your brother—to the grave, fulfilled in a
short time of life a long time of virtue. <span
id="fr_1540"></span>[1541](#fn_1540.md) Would that men would imitate the
laudable examples of women, and that wrinkled old age would pay at last
what youth gladly offers at first! In saying this I am putting my hand
into the fire deliberately and with my eyes open. Men will knit their
brows and shake their clenched fists at me;

<span id="v.LIV-p8"></span>In swelling tones will angry Chremes
rave. <span id="fr_1541"></span>[1542](#fn_1541.md)

<span id="v.LIV-p10"></span>The leaders will rise as one man against my
epistle; the mob of patricians will thunder at me. They will cry out
that I am a sorcerer and a seducer; and that I should be transported to
the ends of the earth. They may add, if they will, the title of
Samaritan; for in it I shall but recognize a name given to my Lord. But
one thing is certain. I do not sever the daughter from the mother, I do
not use the words of the gospel: “let the dead bury their dead.” <span
id="fr_1542"></span>[1543](#fn_1542.md) For whosoever believes in Christ is
alive; and he who believes in Him “ought himself also so to walk even as
He walked.” <span id="fr_1543"></span>[1544](#fn_1543.md)

<span id="v.LIV-p13"></span>3. A truce to the calumnies which the malice
of backbiters continually fastens upon all who call themselves
Christians to keep them through fear of shame from aspiring to virtue.
Except by letter we have no knowledge of each other; and where there is
no knowledge after the flesh, there can be no motive for intercourse
save a religious one. “Honour thy father,” <span
id="fr_1544"></span>[1545](#fn_1544.md) the commandment says, but only if
he does not separate you from your true Father. Recognize the tie of
blood but only so long as your parent recognizes his Creator. Should he
fail to do so, David will sing to you: “hearken, O daughter, and
consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people and thy
father’s house. So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty, for he is
thy Lord.” <span id="fr_1545"></span>[1546](#fn_1545.md) Great is the prize
offered for the forgetting of a parent, “the king shall desire thy
beauty.” You have heard, you have considered, you have inclined your
ear, you have forgotten your people and your father’s house; therefore
the king shall desire your beauty and shall say to you:—“thou art all
fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.” <span
id="fr_1546"></span>[1547](#fn_1546.md) What can be fairer than a soul
which is called the daughter of God, <span
id="fr_1547"></span>[1548](#fn_1547.md) and which seeks for herself no
outward adorning. <span id="fr_1548"></span>[1549](#fn_1548.md) She
believes in Christ, and, dowered with this hope of greatness <span
id="fr_1549"></span>[1550](#fn_1549.md) makes her way to her spouse; for
Christ is at once her bridegroom and her Lord.

<span id="v.LIV-p20"></span>4. What troubles matrimony involves you have
learned in the marriage state itself; you have been surfeited with
quails’ flesh <span id="fr_1550"></span>[1551](#fn_1550.md) even to
loathing; your mouth has been filled with the gall of bitterness; you
have expelled the indigestible and unwholesome food; you have relieved a
heaving stomach. Why will you again swallow what has disagreed with you?
“The dog is turned to his own vomit again and the sow that was washed to
her wallowing in the mire.” <span id="fr_1551"></span>[1552](#fn_1551.md)
Even brute beasts and flying birds do not fall into the same snares
twice. Do you fear extinction for the line of Camillus if you do not
present your father with some little fellow to crawl upon his breast and
slobber his neck? As if all who marry have children! and as if when they
do come, they always resemble their forefathers! Did Cicero’s son
exhibit his father’s eloquence? Had your own Cornelia, <span
id="fr_1552"></span>[1553](#fn_1552.md) pattern at once of chastity and of
fruitfulness, cause to rejoice that she was mother of her Gracchi? It is
ridiculous to expect as certain the offspring which many, as you can
see, have not got, while others who have had it have lost it again. To
whom then are you to leave your great riches? To Christ who cannot die.
Whom shall you make your heir? The same who is already your Lord. Your
father will be sorry but Christ will be glad; your family will grieve
but the angels will rejoice with you. Let your father do what he likes
with what is his own. You are not his to whom you have been born, but
His to whom you have been born again, and who has purchased you at a
great price with His own blood. <span
id="fr_1553"></span>[1554](#fn_1553.md)

<span id="v.LIV-p25"></span>5. Beware of nurses and waiting maids and
similar venomous creatures who try to satisfy their greed by sucking
your blood. They advise you to do not what is best for you but what is
best for them. They are for ever dinning into your ears Virgil’s lines:—

<span id="v.LIV-p26"></span>Will you waste all your youth in lonely
grief

<span id="v.LIV-p27"></span>And children sweet, the gifts of love,
forswear? <span id="fr_1554"></span>[1555](#fn_1554.md)

<span id="v.LIV-p29"></span>Wherever there is holy chastity, there is
also frugal living; and wherever there is frugal living, servants lose
by it. What they do not get is in their minds so much taken from them.
The actual sum received is what they look to, and not its relative
amount. The <span id="page_104">p. 104</span> <span
id="v.LIV-Page_104"></span>moment they see a Christian they at once
repeat the hackneyed saying:—“The Greek! The impostor!” <span
id="fr_1555"></span>[1556](#fn_1555.md) They spread the most scandalous
reports and, when any such emanates from themselves, they pretend that
they have heard it from others, managing thus at once to originate the
story and to exaggerate it. A lying rumour goes forth; and this, when it
has reached the married ladies and has been fanned by their tongues,
spreads through the provinces. You may see numbers of these—their faces
painted, their eyes like those of vipers, their teeth rubbed with
pumice-stone—raving and carping at Christians with insane fury. One of
these ladies,

<span id="v.LIV-p31"></span>A violet mantle round her shoulders thrown,

<span id="v.LIV-p32"></span>Drawls out some mawkish stuff, speaks
through her nose,

<span id="v.LIV-p33"></span>And minces half her words with tripping
tongue. <span id="fr_1556"></span>[1557](#fn_1556.md)

<span id="v.LIV-p35"></span>Hereupon the rest chime in and every bench
expresses hoarse approval. They are backed up by men of my own order
who, finding themselves assailed, assail others. Always fluent in
attacking me, they are dumb in their own defence; just as though they
were not monks themselves, and as though every word said against monks
did not tell also against their spiritual progenitors the clergy. Harm
done to the flock brings discredit on the shepherd. On the other hand we
cannot but praise the life of a monk who holds up to veneration the
priests of Christ and refuses to detract from that order to which he
owes it that he is a Christian.

<span id="v.LIV-p36"></span>6. I have spoken thus, my daughter in
Christ, not because I doubt that you will be faithful to your
vows, <span id="fr_1557"></span>[1558](#fn_1557.md) (you would never have
asked for a letter of advice had you been uncertain as to the
blessedness of monogamy): but that you may realize the wickedness of
servants who merely wish to sell you for their own advantage, the snares
which relations may set for you and the well meant but mistaken
suggestions of a father. While I allow that this latter feels love
toward you, I cannot admit that it is love according to knowledge. I
must say with the apostle: “I bear them record that they have a zeal of
God, but not according to knowledge.” <span
id="fr_1558"></span>[1559](#fn_1558.md) Imitate rather—I cannot say it too
often—your holy mother <span id="fr_1559"></span>[1560](#fn_1559.md) whose
zeal for Christ comes into my mind as often as I remember her, and not
her zeal only but the paleness induced in her by fasting, the alms given
by her to the poor, the courtesy shewn by her to the servants of God,
the lowliness of her garb and heart, and the constant moderation of her
language. Of your father too I speak with respect, not because he is a
patrician and of consular rank but because he is a Christian. Let him be
true to his profession as such. Let him rejoice that he has begotten a
daughter for Christ and not for the world. Nay rather let him grieve
that you have in vain lost your virginity as the fruits of matrimony
have not been yours. Where is the husband whom he gave to you? Even had
he been lovable and good, death would still have snatched all away, and
his decease would have terminated the fleshly bond between you. Seize
the opportunity, I beg of you, and make a virtue of necessity. In the
lives of Christians we look not to the beginnings but to the endings.
Paul began badly but ended well. The start of Judas wins praise; his end
is condemned because of his treachery. Read Ezekiel, “The righteousness
of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression;
as for the wickedness of the wicked he shall not fall thereby in the day
that he turneth from his wickedness.” <span
id="fr_1560"></span>[1561](#fn_1560.md) The Christian life is the true
Jacob’s ladder on which the angels ascend and descend, <span
id="fr_1561"></span>[1562](#fn_1561.md) while the Lord stands above it
holding out His hand to those who slip and sustaining by the vision of
Himself the weary steps of those who ascend. But while He does not wish
the death of a sinner, but only that he should be converted and live, He
hates the lukewarm <span id="fr_1562"></span>[1563](#fn_1562.md) and they
quickly cause him loathing. To whom much is forgiven, the same loveth
much. <span id="fr_1563"></span>[1564](#fn_1563.md)

<span id="v.LIV-p44"></span>7. In the gospel a harlot wins salvation.
How? She is baptized in her tears and wipes the Lord’s feet with that
same hair with which she had before deceived many. She does not wear a
waving headdress or creaking boots, she does not darken her eyes with
antimony. Yet in her squalor she is lovelier than ever. What place have
rouge and white lead on the face of a Christian woman? The one simulates
the natural red of the cheeks and of the lips; the other the whiteness
of the face and of the neck. They serve only to inflame young men’s
passions, to stimulate lust, and to indicate an unchaste mind. How can a
woman weep for her sins whose tears lay bare her true complexion and
mark furrows on her cheeks? Such adorning is not of the Lord; a mask of
this kind belongs to Antichrist. With what confidence can a woman raise
features to heaven which her Creator must fail to recognize? It is idle
to allege in excuse for such practices girlishness and youthful vanity.
A widow who has ceased to have a husband to please, and who in the
apostle’s language is a widow indeed, <span
id="fr_1564"></span>[1565](#fn_1564.md) needs nothing more but <span
id="page_105">p. 105</span> <span
id="v.LIV-Page_105"></span>perseverance only. She is mindful of past
enjoyments, she knows what gave her pleasure and what she has now lost.
By rigid fast and vigil she must quench the fiery darts of the
devil. <span id="fr_1565"></span>[1566](#fn_1565.md) If we are widows, we
must either speak as we are dressed, or else dress as we speak. Why do
we profess one thing, and practise another? The tongue talks of
chastity, but the rest of the body reveals incontinence.

<span id="v.LIV-p47"></span>8. So much for dress and adornment. But a
widow “that liveth in pleasure”—the words are not mine but those of the
apostle—“is dead while she liveth.” <span
id="fr_1566"></span>[1567](#fn_1566.md) What does that mean—“is dead while
she liveth”? To those who know no better she seems to be alive and not,
as she is, dead in sin; yes, and in another sense dead to Christ, from
whom no secrets are hid. “The soul that sinneth it shall die.” <span
id="fr_1567"></span>[1568](#fn_1567.md) “Some men’s sins are open…going
before to judgment: and some they follow after. Likewise also good works
are manifest, and they that are otherwise cannot be hid. <span
id="fr_1568"></span>[1569](#fn_1568.md) The words mean this:—Certain
persons sin so deliberately and flagrantly that you no sooner see them
than you know them at once to be sinners. But the defects of others are
so cunningly concealed that we only learn them from subsequent
information. Similarly the good deeds of some people are public
property, while those of others we come to know only through long
intimacy with them. Why then must we needs boast of our chastity, a
thing which cannot prove itself to be genuine without its companions and
attendants, continence and plain living? The apostle macerates his body
and brings it into subjection to the soul lest what he has preached to
others he should himself fail to keep; <span
id="fr_1569"></span>[1570](#fn_1569.md) and can a mere girl whose passions
are kindled by abundance of food, can a mere girl afford to be confident
of her own chastity?

<span id="v.LIV-p52"></span>9. In saying this, I do not of course
condemn food which God created to be enjoyed with thanksgiving, <span
id="fr_1570"></span>[1571](#fn_1570.md) but I seek to remove from youths
and girls what are incentives to sensual pleasure. Neither the fiery
Etna nor the country of Vulcan, <span
id="fr_1571"></span>[1572](#fn_1571.md) nor Vesuvius, nor Olympus, burns
with such violent heat as the youthful marrow of those who are flushed
with wine and filled with food. Many trample covetousness under foot,
and lay it down as readily as they lay down their purse. An enforced
silence serves to make amends for a railing tongue. The outward
appearance and the mode of dress can be changed in a single hour. All
other sins are external, and what is external can easily be cast away.
Desire alone, implanted in men by God to lead them to procreate
children, is internal; and this, if it once oversteps its own bounds,
becomes a sin, and by a law of nature cries out for sexual intercourse.
It is therefore a work of great merit, and one which requires
unremitting diligence to overcome that which is innate in you; while
living in the flesh not to live after the flesh; to strive with yourself
day by day and to watch the foe shut up within you with the hundred eyes
of the fabled Argus. <span id="fr_1572"></span>[1573](#fn_1572.md) This is
what the apostle says in other words: “Every sin that a man doeth is
without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his
own body.” <span id="fr_1573"></span>[1574](#fn_1573.md) Physicians and
others who have written on the nature of the human body, and
particularly Galen in his books entitled *On matters of health*, say
that the bodies of boys and of young men and of full grown men and women
glow with an interior heat and consequently that for persons of these
ages all food is injurious which tends to promote this heat: while on
the other hand it is highly conducive to health in eating and in
drinking to take things cold and cooling. Contrariwise they tell us that
warm food and old wine are good for the old who suffer from humours and
from chilliness. Hence it is that the Saviour says “Take heed to
yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting
and drunkenness, and cares of this life.” <span
id="fr_1574"></span>[1575](#fn_1574.md) So too speaks the apostle: “Be not
drunk with wine, wherein is excess.” <span
id="fr_1575"></span>[1576](#fn_1575.md) No wonder that the potter spoke
thus of the vessel which He had made when even the comic poet whose only
object is to know and to describe the ways of men tells us that

<span id="v.LIV-p59"></span>Where Ceres fails and Liber, Venus
droops. <span id="fr_1576"></span>[1577](#fn_1576.md)

<span id="v.LIV-p61"></span>10. In the first place then, till you have
passed the years of early womanhood, take only water to drink, for this
is by nature of all drinks the most cooling. This, if your stomach is
strong enough to bear it; but if your digestion is weak, hear what the
apostle says to Timothy: “use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and
thine often infirmities.” <span id="fr_1577"></span>[1578](#fn_1577.md)
Then as regards your food you must avoid all heating dishes. I do not
speak of flesh dishes only (although of these the chosen vessel declares
his mind thus: “it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine” <span
id="fr_1578"></span>[1579](#fn_1578) .md) but of vegetables as well.
Everything provocative or indigestible is to be refused. Be assured that
nothing is so good for young Christians as <span id="page_106">p.
106</span> <span id="v.LIV-Page_106"></span>the eating of herbs.
Accordingly in another place he says: “another who is weak eateth
herbs.” <span id="fr_1579"></span>[1580](#fn_1579.md) Thus the heat of the
body must be tempered with cold food. Daniel and the three children
lived on pulse. <span id="fr_1580"></span>[1581](#fn_1580.md) They were
still boys and had not come yet to that frying-pan on which the King of
Babylon fried the elders <span id="fr_1581"></span>[1582](#fn_1581.md) who
were judges. Moreover, by an express privilege of God’s own giving their
bodily condition was improved by their regimen. We do not expect that it
will be so with us, but we look for increased vigour of soul which
becomes stronger as the flesh grows weaker. Some persons who aspire to
the life of chastity fall midway in their journey from supposing that
they need only abstain from flesh. They load their stomachs with
vegetables which are only harmless when taken sparingly and in
moderation. If I am to say what I think, there is nothing which so much
heats the body and inflames the passions as undigested food and
breathing broken with hiccoughs. As for you, my daughter, I would rather
wound your modesty than endanger my case by understatement. Regard
everything as poison which bears within it the seeds of sensual
pleasure. A meagre diet which leaves the appetite always unsatisfied is
to be preferred to fasts three days long. It is much better to take a
little every day than some days to abstain wholly and on others to
surfeit oneself. That rain is best which falls slowly to the ground.
Showers that come down suddenly and with violence wash away the soil.

<span id="v.LIV-p67"></span>11. When you eat your meals, reflect that
you must immediately afterwards pray and read. Have a fixed number of
lines of holy scripture, and render it as your task to your Lord. On no
account resign yourself to sleep until you have filled the basket of
your breast with a woof of this weaving. After the holy scriptures you
should read the writings of learned men; of those at any rate whose
faith is well known. You need not go into the mire to seek for gold; you
have many pearls, buy the one pearl with these. <span
id="fr_1582"></span>[1583](#fn_1582.md) Stand, as Jeremiah says, in more
ways than one that so you may come on the true way that leads to the
Father. <span id="fr_1583"></span>[1584](#fn_1583.md) Exchange your love of
necklaces and of gems and of silk dresses for earnestness in studying
the scriptures. Enter the land of promise that flows with milk and
honey. <span id="fr_1584"></span>[1585](#fn_1584.md) Eat fine flour and
oil. Let your clothing be, like Joseph’s, of many colors. <span
id="fr_1585"></span>[1586](#fn_1585.md) Let your ears like those of
Jerusalem <span id="fr_1586"></span>[1587](#fn_1586.md) be pierced by the
word of God that the precious grains of new corn may hang from them. In
that reverend man Exuperius <span id="fr_1587"></span>[1588](#fn_1587.md)
you have a man of tried years and faith ready to give you constant
support with his advice.

<span id="v.LIV-p74"></span>12. Make to yourself friends of the mammon
of unrighteousness that they may receive you into everlasting
habitations. <span id="fr_1588"></span>[1589](#fn_1588.md) Give your riches
not to those who feed on pheasants but to those who have none but common
bread to eat, such as stays hunger while it does not stimulate lust.
Consider the poor and needy. <span id="fr_1589"></span>[1590](#fn_1589.md)
Give to everyone that asks of you, <span
id="fr_1590"></span>[1591](#fn_1590.md) but especially unto them who are of
the household of faith. <span id="fr_1591"></span>[1592](#fn_1591.md)
Clothe the naked, feed the hungry, visit the sick. <span
id="fr_1592"></span>[1593](#fn_1592.md) Every time that you hold out your
hand, think of Christ. See to it that you do not, when the Lord your God
asks an alms of you, increase riches which are none of His.

<span id="v.LIV-p80"></span>13. Avoid the company of young men. Let long
baited youths dandified and wanton never be seen under your roof. Repel
a singer as you would some bane. Hurry from your house women who live by
playing and singing, the devil’s choir whose songs are the fatal ones of
sirens. Do not arrogate to yourself a widow’s license and appear in
public preceded by a host of eunuchs. It is a most mischievous thing for
those who are weak owing to their sex and youth to misuse their own
discretion and to suppose that things are lawful because they are
pleasant. “All things are lawful, but all things are not
expedient.” <span id="fr_1593"></span>[1594](#fn_1593.md) No frizzled
steward nor shapely foster brother nor fair and ruddy footman must
dangle at your heels. Sometimes the tone of the mistress is inferred
from the dress of the maid. Seek the society of holy virgins and widows;
and, if need arises for holding converse with men, do not shun having
witnesses, and let your conversation be marked with such confidence that
the entry of a third person shall neither startle you nor make you
blush. The face is the mirror of the mind and a woman’s eyes without a
word betray the secrets of her heart. I have lately seen a most
miserable scandal traverse the entire East. The lady’s age and style,
her dress and mien, the indiscriminate company she kept, her dainty
table and her regal appointments bespoke her the bride of a Nero or of a
Sardanapallus. The scars of others should teach us caution. ‘When he
that causeth trouble is scourged the fool will be wiser.’ <span
id="fr_1594"></span>[1595](#fn_1594.md) A holy love knows no impatience. A
false rumor is quickly crushed and the after life passes judgment on
that which has gone <span id="page_107">p. 107</span> <span
id="v.LIV-Page_107"></span>before. It is not indeed possible that any
one should come to the end of life’s race without suffering from
calumny; the wicked find it a consolation to carp at the good, supposing
the guilt of sin to be less, in proportion as the number of those who
commit it is greater. Still a fire of straw quickly dies out and a
spreading flame soon expires if fuel to it be wanting. Whether the
report which prevailed a year ago was true or false, when once the sin
ceases, the scandal also will cease. I do not say this because I fear
anything wrong in your case but because, owing to my deep affection for
you, there is no safety that I do not fear. <span
id="fr_1595"></span>[1596](#fn_1595.md) Oh! that you could see your
sister <span id="fr_1596"></span>[1597](#fn_1596.md) and that it might be
yours to hear the eloquence of her holy lips and to behold the mighty
spirit which animates her diminutive frame. You might hear the whole
contents of the old and new testaments come bubbling up out of her
heart. Fasting is her sport, and prayer she makes her pastime. Like
Miriam after the drowning Pharaoh she takes up her timbrel and sings to
the virgin choir, “Let us sing to the Lord for He hath triumphed
gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.” <span
id="fr_1597"></span>[1598](#fn_1597.md) She teaches her companions to be
music girls but music girls for Christ, to be luteplayers but
luteplayers for the Saviour. In this occupation she passes both day and
night and with oil ready to put in the lamps she waits the coming of the
Bridegroom. <span id="fr_1598"></span>[1599](#fn_1598.md) Do you therefore
imitate your kinswoman. Let Rome have in you what a grander city than
Rome, I mean Bethlehem, has in her.

<span id="v.LIV-p87"></span>14. You have wealth and can easily therefore
supply food to those who want it. Let virtue consume what was provided
for self-indulgence; one who means to despise matrimony need fear no
degree of want. Have about you troops of virgins whom you may lead into
the king’s chamber. Support widows that you may mingle them as a kind of
violets with the virgins’ lilies and the martyrs’ roses. Such are the
garlands you must weave for Christ in place of that crown of
thorns <span id="fr_1599"></span>[1600](#fn_1599.md) in which he bore the
sins of the world. Let your most noble father thus find in you his joy
and support, let him learn from his daughter the lessons he used to
learn from his wife. His hair is already gray, his knees tremble, his
teeth fall out, his brow is furrowed through years, death is nigh even
at the doors, the pyre is all but laid out hard by. Whether we like it
or not, we grow old. Let him provide for himself the provision which is
needful for his long journey. Let him take with him what otherwise he
must unwillingly leave behind, nay let him send before him to heaven
what if he declines it, will be appropriated by earth.

<span id="v.LIV-p89"></span>15. Young widows, of whom some “are already
turned aside after Satan, when they have begun to wax wanton against
Christ ” <span id="fr_1600"></span>[1601](#fn_1600.md) and wish to marry,
generally make such excuses as these. “My little patrimony is daily
decreasing, the property which I have inherited is being squandered, a
servant has spoken insultingly to me, a maid has neglected my orders.
Who will appear for me before the authorities? Who will be responsible
for the rents of my estates? <span id="fr_1601"></span>[1602](#fn_1601.md)
Who will see to the education of my children, and to the bringing up of
my slaves?” Thus, shameful to say, they put that forward as a reason for
marrying again, which alone should deter them from doing so. For by
marrying again a mother places over her sons not a guardian but a foe,
not a father but a tyrant. Inflamed by her passions she forgets the
fruit of her womb, and among the children who know nothing of their sad
fate the lately weeping widow dresses herself once more as a bride. Why
these excuses about your property and the insolence of slaves? Confess
the shameful truth. No woman marries to avoid cohabiting with a husband.
At least, if passion is not your motive, it is mere madness to play the
harlot just to increase wealth. You do but purchase a paltry and passing
gain at the price of a grace which is precious and eternal! If you have
children already, why do you want to marry? If you have none, why do you
not fear a recurrence of your former sterility? Why do you put an
uncertain gain before a certain loss of self-respect?

<span id="v.LIV-p92"></span>A marriage-settlement is made in your favour
to-day but in a short time you will be constrained to make your will.
Your husband will feign sickness and will do for you what he wants you
to do for him. Yet he is sure to live and you are sure to die. Or if it
happens that you have sons by the second husband, domestic strife is
certain to result and intestine disputes. You will not be allowed to
love your first children, nor to look kindly on those to whom you have
yourself given birth. You will have to give them their food secretly;
yet even so your present husband will bear a grudge against your
previous one and, unless you hate your sons, he will think that you
still love their father. But your husband may have issue by a former
wife. If so when he takes you to his home, though you should be the
kindest person in the world, <span id="page_108">p. 108</span> <span
id="v.LIV-Page_108"></span>all the commonplaces of rhetoricians and
declamations of comic poets and writers of mimes will be hurled at you
as a cruel stepmother. If your stepson fall sick or have a headache you
will be calumniated as a poisoner. If you refuse him food, you will be
cruel, while if you give it, you will be held to have bewitched him. I
ask you what benefit has a second marriage to confer great enough to
compensate for these evils?

<span id="v.LIV-p93"></span>16. Do we wish to know what widows ought to
be? Let us read the gospel according to Luke. “There was one Anna,” he
says, “a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of
Aser.” <span id="fr_1602"></span>[1603](#fn_1602.md) The meaning of the
name Anna is grace. Phanuel is in our tongue the face of God. Aser may
be translated either as blessedness or as wealth. From her youth up to
the age of fourscore and four years she had borne the burden of
widowhood, not departing from the temple and giving herself to fastings
and prayers night and day; therefore she earned spiritual grace,
received the title ‘daughter of the face of God,’ <span
id="fr_1603"></span>[1604](#fn_1603.md) and obtained a share in the
‘blessedness and wealth’ <span id="fr_1604"></span>[1605](#fn_1604.md)
which belonged to her ancestry. Let us recall to mind the widow of
Zarephath <span id="fr_1605"></span>[1606](#fn_1605.md) who thought more of
satisfying Elijah’s hunger than of preserving her own life and that of
her son. Though she believed that she and he must die that very night
unless they had food, she determined that her guest should survive. She
preferred to sacrifice her life rather than to neglect the duty of
almsgiving. In her handful of meal she found the seed from which she was
to reap a harvest sent her by the Lord. She sows her meal and lo! a
cruse of oil comes from it. In the land of Judah grain was scarce for
the corn of wheat had died there; <span
id="fr_1606"></span>[1607](#fn_1606.md) but in the house of a heathen widow
oil flowed in streams. In the book of Judith—if any one is of opinion
that it should be received as canonical—we read of a widow wasted with
fasting and wearing the sombre garb of a mourner, whose outward squalor
indicated not so much the regret which she felt for her dead husband as
the temper <span id="fr_1607"></span>[1608](#fn_1607.md) in which she
looked forward to the coming of the Bridegroom. I see her hand armed
with the sword and stained with blood. I recognize the head of
Holofernes which she has carried away from the camp of the enemy. Here a
woman vanquishes men, and chastity beheads lust. Quickly changing her
garb, she puts on once more in the hour of victory her own mean dress
finer than all the splendours of the world. <span
id="fr_1608"></span>[1609](#fn_1608.md)

<span id="v.LIV-p101"></span>17. Some from a misapprehension number
Deborah among the widows, and suppose that Barak the leader of the army
is her son, though the scripture tells a different story. I will mention
her here because she was a prophetess and is reckoned among the judges,
and again because she might have said with the psalmist:—“How sweet are
thy words unto my taste! yea sweeter than honey to my mouth.” <span
id="fr_1609"></span>[1610](#fn_1609.md) Well was she called the bee <span
id="fr_1610"></span>[1611](#fn_1610.md) for she fed on the flowers of
scripture, was enveloped with the fragrance of the Holy Spirit, and
gathered into one with prophetic lips the sweet juices of the nectar.
Then there is Naomi, in Greek <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.LIV-p103.1"></span>παρακεκλημένη</span> <span
id="fr_1611"></span>[1612](#fn_1611.md) or she who is consoled, who, when
her husband and her children died abroad, carried her chastity back home
and, being supported on the road by its aid, kept with her her Moabitish
daughter-in-law, that in her the prophecy of Isaiah <span
id="fr_1612"></span>[1613](#fn_1612.md) might find a fulfilment. “Send out
the lamb, O Lord, to rule over the land from the rock of the desert to
the mount of the daughter of Zion.” <span
id="fr_1613"></span>[1614](#fn_1613.md) I pass on to the widow in the
gospel who, though she was but a poor widow was yet richer than all the
people of Israel. <span id="fr_1614"></span>[1615](#fn_1614.md) She had but
a grain of mustard seed, but she put her leaven in three measures of
flour; and, combining her confession of the Father and of the Son with
the grace of the Holy Spirit, she cast her two mites into the treasury.
All the substance that she had, her entire possessions, she offered in
the two testaments of her faith. These are the two seraphim which
glorify the Trinity with threefold song <span
id="fr_1615"></span>[1616](#fn_1615.md) and are stored among the treasures
of the church. They also form the legs of the tongs by which the live
coal is caught up to purge the sinner’s lips. <span
id="fr_1616"></span>[1617](#fn_1616.md)

<span id="v.LIV-p110"></span>18. But why should I recall instances from
history and bring from books types of saintly women, when in your own
city you have many before your eyes whose example you may well imitate?
I shall not recount their merits here lest I should seem to flatter
them. It will suffice to mention the saintly Marcella <span
id="fr_1617"></span>[1618](#fn_1617.md) who, while she is true to the
claims of her birth and station, has set before us a life which is
worthy of the gospel. Anna “lived with an husband seven years from her
virginity”; <span id="fr_1618"></span>[1619](#fn_1618.md) Marcella lived
with one for seven months. Anna looked for the coming of Christ;
Marcella holds fast the Lord whom Anna received in her arms. Anna sang
His praise when He was still a <span id="page_109">p. 109</span> <span
id="v.LIV-Page_109"></span>wailing infant; Marcella proclaims His glory
now that He has won His triumph. Anna spoke of Him to all those who
waited for the redemption of Israel; Marcella cries out with the nations
of the redeemed: “A brother redeemeth not, yet a man shall
redeem,” <span id="fr_1619"></span>[1620](#fn_1619.md) and from another
psalm: “A man was born in her, and the Highest Himself hath established
her.” <span id="fr_1620"></span>[1621](#fn_1620.md)

<span id="v.LIV-p115"></span>About two years ago, as I well remember, I
published a book against Jovinian in which by the authority of scripture
I crushed the objections raised on the other side on account of the
apostle’s concession of second marriages. It is unnecessary that I
should repeat my arguments afresh here, as you can find them all in this
treatise. That I may not exceed the limits of a letter, I will only give
you this one last piece of advice. Think every day that you must die,
and you will then never think of marrying again.
