<span id="v.LIII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.LIII-p1.1"></span>Letter LIII. To Paulinus.</span>

<span id="v.LIII-p2"></span>Jerome urges Paulinus, bishop of Nola, (for
whom see Letter LVIII.) to make a diligent study of the Scriptures and
to this end reminds him of the zeal for learning displayed not only by
the wisest of the pagans but also by the apostle Paul. Then going
through the two Testaments in detail he describes the contents of the
several books and the lessons which may be learned from them. He
concludes with an appeal to Paulinus to divest himself wholly of his
earthly wealth and to devote himself altogether to God. Written in 394
<span class="c17"><span id="v.LIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.LIII-p3"></span>1. Our brother Ambrose along with your
little gifts has delivered to me a most charming letter which, though it
comes at the beginning of our friendship, gives assurance of tried
fidelity and of long continued attachment. A true intimacy cemented by
Christ Himself is not one which depends upon material considerations, or
upon the presence of the persons, or upon an insincere and exaggerated
flattery; but one such as ours, wrought by a common fear of God and a
joint study of the divine scriptures.

<span id="v.LIII-p4"></span>We read in old tales that men traversed
provinces, crossed seas, and visited strange peoples, simply to see face
to face persons whom they only knew from books. Thus Pythagoras visited
the prophets of Memphis; and Plato, besides visiting Egypt and Archytas
of Tarentum, most carefully explored that part of the coast of Italy
which was formerly called Great Greece. In this way the influential
Athenian master with whose lessons the schools <span
id="fr_1396"></span>[1397](#fn_1396.md) of the Academy resounded became at
once a pilgrim and a pupil choosing modestly to learn what others had to
teach rather than over confidently to propound views of his own. Indeed
his pursuit of learning—which seemed to fly before him all the world
over—finally led to his capture by pirates who sold him into slavery to
a cruel tyrant. <span id="fr_1397"></span>[1398](#fn_1397.md) Thus he
became a prisoner, a bond-man, and a slave; yet, as he was always a
philosopher, he was greater still than the man who purchased him. Again
we read that certain noblemen journeyed from the most remote parts of
Spain and Gaul to visit Titus Livius, <span
id="fr_1398"></span>[1399](#fn_1398.md) and listen to his eloquence which
flowed like a fountain of milk. Thus the fame of an individual had more
power to draw men to Rome than the attractions of the city itself; and
the age displayed an unheard of and noteworthy portent in the shape of
men who, entering the great city, bestowed their attention not upon it
but upon something else. Apollonius <span
id="fr_1399"></span>[1400](#fn_1399.md) too was a traveller—the one <span
id="page_97">p. 97</span> <span id="v.LIII-Page_97"></span>I mean who is
called the sorcerer <span id="fr_1400"></span>[1401](#fn_1400.md) by
ordinary people and the philosopher by such as follow Pythagoras. He
entered Persia, traversed the Caucasus and made his way through the
Albanians, the Scythians, the Massagetæ, and the richest districts of
India. At last, after crossing that wide river the Pison, <span
id="fr_1401"></span>[1402](#fn_1401.md) he came to the Brahmans. There he
saw Hiarcas <span id="fr_1402"></span>[1403](#fn_1402.md) sitting upon his
golden throne and drinking from his Tantalus-fountain, and heard him
instructing a few disciples upon the nature, motions, and orbits of the
heavenly bodies. After this he travelled among the Elamites, the
Babylonians, the Chaldeans, the Medes, the Assyrians, the Parthians, the
Syrians, the Phenicians, the Arabians, and the Philistines. <span
id="fr_1403"></span>[1404](#fn_1403.md) Then returning to Alexandria he
made his way to Ethiopia to see the gymnosophists and the famous table
of the sun spread in the sands of the desert. <span
id="fr_1404"></span>[1405](#fn_1404.md) Everywhere he found something to
learn, and as he was always going to new places, he became constantly
wiser and better. Philostratus has written the story of his life at
length in eight books.

<span id="v.LIII-p14"></span>2. But why should I confine my allusions to
the men of this world, when the Apostle Paul, the chosen vessel <span
id="fr_1405"></span>[1406](#fn_1405.md) the doctor <span
id="fr_1406"></span>[1407](#fn_1406.md) of the Gentiles, who could boldly
say: “Do ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me?” <span
id="fr_1407"></span>[1408](#fn_1407.md) knowing that he really had within
him that greatest of guests—when even he after visiting Damascus and
Arabia “went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and abode with him fifteen
days.” <span id="fr_1408"></span>[1409](#fn_1408.md) For he who was to be a
preacher to the Gentiles had to be instructed in the mystical numbers
seven and eight. And again fourteen years after he took Barnabas and
Titus and communicated his gospel to the apostles lest by any means he
should have run or had run in vain. <span
id="fr_1409"></span>[1410](#fn_1409.md) Spoken words possess an indefinable
hidden power, and teaching that passed directly from the mouth of the
speaker into the ears of the disciples is more impressive than any
other. When the speech of Demosthenes against Æschines was recited
before the latter during his exile at Rhodes, amid all the admiration
and applause he sighed “if you could but have heard the brute deliver
his own periods!” <span id="fr_1410"></span>[1411](#fn_1410.md)

<span id="v.LIII-p21"></span>3. I do not adduce these instances because
I have anything in me from which you either can or will learn a lesson,
but to show you that your zeal and eagerness to learn—even though you
cannot rely on help from me—are in themselves worthy of praise. A mind
willing to learn deserves commendation even when it has no teacher. What
is of importance to me is not what you find but what you seek to find.
Wax is soft and easy to mould even where the hands of craftsman and
modeller are wanting to work it. It is already potentially all that it
can be made. The apostle Paul learned the Law of Moses and the prophets
at the feet of Gamaliel and was glad that he had done so, for armed with
this spiritual armour, he was able to say boldly “the weapons of our
warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of
strongholds;” armed with these we war “casting down imaginations and
every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and
bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; and
being in a readiness to revenge all disobedience.” <span
id="fr_1411"></span>[1412](#fn_1411.md) He writes to Timothy who had been
trained in the holy writings from a child exhorting him to study them
diligently <span id="fr_1412"></span>[1413](#fn_1412.md) and not to neglect
the gift which was given him with the laying on of the hands of the
presbytery. <span id="fr_1413"></span>[1414](#fn_1413.md) To Titus he gives
commandment that among a bishop’s other virtues (which he briefly
describes) he should be careful to seek a knowledge of the scriptures: A
bishop, he says, must hold fast “the faithful word as he hath been
taught that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to
convince the gainsayers.” <span id="fr_1414"></span>[1415](#fn_1414.md) In
fact want of education in a clergyman <span
id="fr_1415"></span>[1416](#fn_1415.md) prevents him from doing good to any
one but himself and much as the virtue of his life may build up Christ’s
church, he does it an injury as great by failing to resist those who are
trying to pull it down. The prophet Haggai says—or rather the Lord says
it by the mouth of Haggai—“Ask now the priests concerning the
law.” <span id="fr_1416"></span>[1417](#fn_1416.md) For such is the
important function of the priesthood to give answers to those who
question them concerning the law. And in Deuteronomy we read “Ask thy
father and he will shew thee; thy elders and they will tell thee.” <span
id="fr_1417"></span>[1418](#fn_1417.md) Also in the one hundred and
nineteenth psalm “thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my
pilgrimage.” <span id="fr_1418"></span>[1419](#fn_1418.md) David too, in
the description of the righteous man whom he compares to the tree of
life in paradise, amongst his other excellences speaks of this, “His
delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day
and night.” <span id="fr_1419"></span>[1420](#fn_1419.md) In the close of
his most solemn vision Daniel declares that “the righteous shall shine
as the stars; and the wise, that is the learned, as the
firmament.” <span id="fr_1420"></span>[1421](#fn_1420.md) You can see,
therefore, how great is the difference between righteous ignorance and
instructed righteous<span id="page_98">p. 98</span> <span
id="v.LIII-Page_98"></span>ness. Those who have the first are compared
with the stars, those who have the second with the heavens. Yet,
according to the exact sense of the Hebrew, both statements may be
understood of the learned, for it is to be read in this way:—“They that
be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that
turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.” Why is the
apostle Paul called a chosen vessel? <span
id="fr_1421"></span>[1422](#fn_1421.md) Assuredly because he is a repertory
of the Law and of the holy scriptures. The learned teaching of our Lord
strikes the Pharisees dumb with amazement, and they are filled with
astonishment to find that Peter and John know the Law although they have
not learned letters. For to these the Holy Ghost immediately suggested
what comes to others by daily study and meditation; and, as it is
written, <span id="fr_1422"></span>[1423](#fn_1422.md) they were “taught of
God.” The Saviour had only accomplished his twelfth year when the scene
in the temple took place; <span id="fr_1423"></span>[1424](#fn_1423.md) but
when he interrogated the elders concerning the Law His wise questions
conveyed rather than sought information.

<span id="v.LIII-p35"></span>4. But perhaps we ought to call Peter and
John ignorant, both of whom could say of themselves, “though I be rude
in speech, yet not in knowledge.” <span
id="fr_1424"></span>[1425](#fn_1424.md) Was John a mere fisherman, rude and
untaught? If so, whence did he get the words “In the beginning was the
word, and the word was with God and the word was God.” <span
id="fr_1425"></span>[1426](#fn_1425.md) *Logos* in Greek has many meanings.
It signifies word and reason and reckoning and the cause of individual
things by which those which are subsist. All of which things we rightly
predicate of Christ. This truth Plato with all his learning did not
know, of this Demosthenes with all his eloquence was ignorant. “I will
destroy,” it is said, “the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing
the understanding of the prudent.” <span
id="fr_1426"></span>[1427](#fn_1426.md) The true wisdom must destroy the
false, and, although the foolishness of preaching <span
id="fr_1427"></span>[1428](#fn_1427.md) is inseparable from the Cross, Paul
speaks “wisdom among them that are perfect, yet not the wisdom of this
world, nor of the princes of this world that come to nought,” but he
speaks “the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which
God ordained before the world.” <span
id="fr_1428"></span>[1429](#fn_1428.md) God’s wisdom is Christ, for Christ,
we are told, is “the power of God and the wisdom of God.” <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[1430](#fn_1429.md) He is the wisdom which is hidden in
a mystery, of which also we read in the heading of the ninth psalm “for
the hidden things of the son.” <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430.md) In Him are hidden all the treasures
of wisdom and knowledge. He also who was hidden in a mystery is the same
that was foreordained before the world. Now it was in the Law and in the
Prophets that he was foreordained and prefigured. For this reason too
the prophets were called seers, <span
id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431.md) because they saw Him whom others
did not see. Abraham saw His day and was glad. <span
id="fr_1432"></span>[1433](#fn_1432.md) The heavens which were sealed to a
rebellious people were opened to Ezekiel. “Open thou mine eyes,” saith
David, “that I may behold wonderful things out of thy Law.” <span
id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433.md) For “the law is spiritual” <span
id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434.md) and a revelation is needed to
enable us to comprehend it and, when God uncovers His face, to behold
His glory.

<span id="v.LIII-p47"></span>5. In the apocalypse a book is shewn sealed
with seven seals, <span id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435.md) which if
you deliver to one that is learned saying, Read this, he will answer
you, I cannot, for it is sealed. <span
id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436.md) How many there are to-day who fancy
themselves learned, yet the scriptures are a sealed book to them, and
one which they cannot open save through Him who has the key of David,
“he that openeth and no man shutteth; and shutteth and no man
openeth.” <span id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437.md) In the Acts of the
Apostles the holy eunuch (or rather “man” for so the scripture calls
him <span id="fr_1438"></span>[1439](#fn_1438) .md) when reading Isaiah he
is asked by Philip “Understandest thou what thou readest?”, makes
answer:—“How can I except some man should guide me?” <span
id="fr_1439"></span>[1440](#fn_1439.md) To digress for a moment to myself,
I am neither holier nor more diligent than this eunuch, who came from
Ethiopia, that is from the ends of the world, to the Temple leaving
behind him a queen’s palace, and was so great a lover of the Law and of
divine knowledge that he read the holy scriptures even in his chariot.
Yet although he had the book in his hand and took into his mind the
words of the Lord, nay even had them on his tongue and uttered them with
his lips, he still knew not Him, whom—not knowing—he worshipped in the
book. Then Philip came and shewed him Jesus, who was concealed beneath
the letter. Wondrous excellence of the teacher! In the same hour the
eunuch believed and was baptized; he became one of the faithful and a
saint. He was no longer a pupil but a master; and he found more in the
church’s font there in the wilderness than he had ever done in the
gilded temple of the synagogue.

<span id="v.LIII-p53"></span>6. These instances have been just touched
upon by me (the limits of a letter forbid a more discursive treatment of
them) to convince you that in the holy scriptures you can make no
progress unless you have a guide to shew you the way. I say nothing of
the knowledge of grammarians, rhetoricians, philoso<span id="page_99">p.
99</span> <span id="v.LIII-Page_99"></span>phers, geometers, logicians,
musicians, astronomers, astrologers, physicians, whose several kinds of
skill are most useful to mankind, and may be ranged under the three
heads of teaching, method, and proficiency. I will pass to the less
important crafts which require manual dexterity more than mental
ability. Husbandmen, masons, carpenters, workers in wood and metal,
wool-dressers and fullers, as well as those artisans who make furniture
and cheap utensils, cannot attain the ends they seek without instruction
from qualified persons. As Horace says <span
id="fr_1440"></span>[1441](#fn_1440.md)

<span id="v.LIII-p55"></span>Doctors alone profess the healing art

<span id="v.LIII-p56"></span>And none but joiners ever try to join.

<span id="v.LIII-p57"></span>7. The art of interpreting the scriptures
is the only one of which all men everywhere claim to be masters. To
quote Horace again

<span id="v.LIII-p58"></span>Taught or untaught we all write
poetry. <span id="fr_1441"></span>[1442](#fn_1441.md)

<span id="v.LIII-p60"></span>The chatty old woman, the doting old man,
and the wordy sophist, one and all take in hand the Scriptures, rend
them in pieces and teach them before they have learned them. Some with
brows knit and bombastic words, balanced one against the other
philosophize concerning the sacred writings among weak women. Others—I
blush to say it—learn of women what they are to teach men; and as if
even this were not enough, they boldly explain to others what they
themselves by no means understand. I say nothing of persons who, like
myself have been familiar with secular literature before they have come
to the study of the holy scriptures. Such men when they charm the
popular ear by the finish of their style suppose every word they say to
be a law of God. They do not deign to notice what Prophets and apostles
have intended but they adapt conflicting passages to suit their own
meaning, as if it were a grand way of teaching—and not rather the
faultiest of all—to misrepresent a writer’s views and to force the
scriptures reluctantly to do their will. They forget that we have read
centos from Homer and Virgil; but we never think of calling the
Christless Maro <span id="fr_1442"></span>[1443](#fn_1442.md) a Christian
because of his lines:—

<span id="v.LIII-p62"></span>Now comes the Virgin back and Saturn’s
reign,

<span id="v.LIII-p63"></span>Now from high heaven comes a Child
newborn. <span id="fr_1443"></span>[1444](#fn_1443.md)

<span id="v.LIII-p65"></span>Another line might be addressed by the
Father to the Son:—

<span id="v.LIII-p66"></span>Hail, only Son, my Might and Majesty. <span
id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444.md)

<span id="v.LIII-p68"></span>And yet another might follow the Saviour’s
words on the cross:—

<span id="v.LIII-p69"></span>Such words he spake and there transfixed
remained. <span id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445.md)

<span id="v.LIII-p71"></span>But all this is puerile, and resembles the
sleight-of-hand of a mountebank. It is idle to try to teach what you do
not know, and—if I may speak with some warmth—is worse still to be
ignorant of your ignorance.

<span id="v.LIII-p72"></span>8. Genesis, we shall be told, needs no
explanation; its topics are too simple—the birth of the world, the
origin of the human race, <span id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446.md) the
division of the earth, <span id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447.md) the
confusion of tongues, <span id="fr_1448"></span>[1449](#fn_1448.md) and the
descent of the Hebrews into Egypt! <span
id="fr_1449"></span>[1450](#fn_1449.md) Exodus, no doubt, is equally plain,
containing as it does merely an account of the ten plagues, <span
id="fr_1450"></span>[1451](#fn_1450.md) the decalogue, <span
id="fr_1451"></span>[1452](#fn_1451.md) and sundry mysterious and divine
precepts! The meaning of Leviticus is of course self-evident, although
every sacrifice that it describes, nay more every word that it contains,
the description of Aaron’s vestments, <span
id="fr_1452"></span>[1453](#fn_1452.md) and all the regulations connected
with the Levites are symbols of things heavenly! The book of Numbers
too—are not its very figures, <span id="fr_1453"></span>[1454](#fn_1453.md)
and Balaam’s prophecy, <span id="fr_1454"></span>[1455](#fn_1454.md) and
the forty-two camping places in the wilderness <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455.md) so many mysteries? Deuteronomy
also, that is the second law or the foreshadowing of the law of the
gospel,—does it not, while exhibiting things known before, put old
truths in a new light? So far the ‘five words’ of the Pentateuch, with
which the apostle boasts his wish to speak in the Church. <span
id="fr_1456"></span>[1457](#fn_1456.md) Then, as for Job, <span
id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457.md) that pattern of patience, what
mysteries are there not contained in his discourses? Commencing in prose
the book soon glides into verse and at the end once more reverts to
prose. By the way in which it lays down propositions, assumes
postulates, adduces proofs, and draws inferences, it illustrates all the
laws of logic. Single words occurring in the book are full of meaning.
To say nothing of other topics, it prophesies the resurrection of men’s
bodies at once with more clearness and with more caution than any one
has yet shewn. “I know,” Job says, “that my redeemer liveth, and that at
the last day I shall rise again from the earth; and I shall be clothed
again with my skin, and in my flesh shall I see God. Whom I shall see
for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another. This my hope is
stored up in my own bosom.” <span id="fr_1458"></span>[1459](#fn_1458.md) I
will pass on to Jesus the son of Nave <span
id="fr_1459"></span>[1460](#fn_1459.md) —a type of the Lord in name as well
as in deed—who crossed over Jordan, subdued hostile kingdoms, divided
the land among the conquering people and <span id="page_100">p.
100</span> <span id="v.LIII-Page_100"></span>who, in every city,
village, mountain, river, hill-torrent, and boundary which he dealt
with, marked out the spiritual realms of the heavenly Jerusalem, that
is, of the church. <span id="fr_1460"></span>[1461](#fn_1460.md) In the
book of Judges every one of the popular leaders is a type. Ruth the
Moabitess fulfils the prophecy of Isaiah:—“Send thou a lamb, O Lord, as
ruler of the land from the rock of the wilderness to the mount of the
daughter of Zion.” <span id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461.md) Under the
figures of Eli’s death and the slaying of Saul Samuel shews the
abolition of the old law. Again in Zadok and in David he bears witness
to the mysteries of the new priesthood and of the new royalty. The third
and fourth books of Kings called in Hebrew *Malâchim* give the history
of the kingdom of Judah from Solomon to Jeconiah, <span
id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462.md) and of that of Israel from Jeroboam
the son of Nebat to Hoshea who was carried away into Assyria. If you
merely regard the narrative, the words are simple enough, but if you
look beneath the surface at the hidden meaning of it, you find a
description of the small numbers of the church and of the wars which the
heretics wage against it. The twelve prophets whose writings are
compressed within the narrow limits of a single volume, <span
id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463.md) have typical meanings far different
from their literal ones. Hosea speaks many times of Ephraim, of Samaria,
of Joseph, of Jezreel, of a wife of whoredoms and of children of
whoredoms, <span id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464.md) of an adulteress
shut up within the chamber of her husband, sitting for a long time in
widowhood and in the garb of mourning, awaiting the time when her
husband will return to her. <span id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465.md)
Joel the son of Pethuel describes the land of the twelve tribes as
spoiled and devastated by the palmerworm, the canker-worm, the locust,
and the blight, <span id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466.md) and predicts
that after the overthrow of the former people the Holy Spirit shall be
poured out upon God’s servants and handmaids; <span
id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467.md) the same spirit, that is, which was
to be poured out in the upper chamber at Zion upon the one hundred and
twenty believers. <span id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468.md) These
believers rising by gradual and regular gradations from one to fifteen
form the steps to which there is a mystical allusion in the “psalms of
degrees.” <span id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469.md) Amos, although he
is only “an herdman” from the country, “a gatherer of sycomore
fruit,” <span id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470.md) cannot be explained
in a few words. For who can adequately speak of the three transgressions
and the four of Damascus, of Gaza, of Tyre, of Idumæa, of Moab, of the
children of Ammon, and in the seventh and eighth place of Judah and of
Israel? He speaks to the fat kine that are in the mountain of
Samaria, <span id="fr_1471"></span>[1472](#fn_1471.md) and bears witness
that the great house and the little house shall fall. <span
id="fr_1472"></span>[1473](#fn_1472.md) He sees now the maker of the
grasshopper, <span id="fr_1473"></span>[1474](#fn_1473.md) now the Lord,
standing upon a wall <span id="fr_1474"></span>[1475](#fn_1474.md)
daubed <span id="fr_1475"></span>[1476](#fn_1475.md) or made of
adamant, <span id="fr_1476"></span>[1477](#fn_1476.md) now a basket of
apples <span id="fr_1477"></span>[1478](#fn_1477.md) that brings doom to
the transgressors, and now a famine upon the earth “not a famine of
bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the
Lord.” <span id="fr_1478"></span>[1479](#fn_1478.md) Obadiah, whose name
means the servant of God, thunders against Edom red with blood and
against the creature born of earth. <span
id="fr_1479"></span>[1480](#fn_1479.md) He smites him with the spear of the
spirit because of his continual rivalry with his brother Jacob. Jonah,
fairest of doves, whose shipwreck shews in a figure the passion of the
Lord, recalls the world to penitence, and while he preaches to Nineveh,
announces salvation to all the heathen. Micah the Morasthite a joint
heir with Christ <span id="fr_1480"></span>[1481](#fn_1480.md) announces
the spoiling of the daughter of the robber and lays siege against her,
because she has smitten the jawbone of the judge of Israel. <span
id="fr_1481"></span>[1482](#fn_1481.md) Nahum, the consoler of the world,
rebukes “the bloody city” <span id="fr_1482"></span>[1483](#fn_1482.md) and
when it is overthrown cries:—“Behold upon the mountains the feet of him
that bringeth good tidings.” <span id="fr_1483"></span>[1484](#fn_1483.md)
Habakkuk, like a strong and unyielding wrestler, <span
id="fr_1484"></span>[1485](#fn_1484.md) stands upon his watch and sets his
foot upon the tower <span id="fr_1485"></span>[1486](#fn_1485.md) that he
may contemplate Christ upon the cross and say “His glory covered the
heavens and the earth was full of his praise. And his brightness was as
the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding
of his power.” <span id="fr_1486"></span>[1487](#fn_1486.md) Zephaniah,
that is the bodyguard and knower of the secrets of the Lord, <span
id="fr_1487"></span>[1488](#fn_1487.md) hears “a cry from the fishgate, and
an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.” <span
id="fr_1488"></span>[1489](#fn_1488.md) He proclaims “howling to the
inhabitants of the mortar; <span id="fr_1489"></span>[1490](#fn_1489.md)
for all the people of Canaan are undone; all they that were laden with
silver are cut off.” <span id="fr_1490"></span>[1491](#fn_1490.md) Haggai,
that is he who is glad or joyful, who has sown in tears to reap in
joy, <span id="fr_1491"></span>[1492](#fn_1491.md) is occupied with the
rebuilding of the temple. He represents the Lord (the Father, that is)
as saying “Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens,
and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; and I will shake all
nations <span id="page_101">p. 101</span> <span
id="v.LIII-Page_101"></span>and he who is desired <span
id="fr_1492"></span>[1493](#fn_1492.md) of all nations shall come.” <span
id="fr_1493"></span>[1494](#fn_1493.md) Zechariah, he that is mindful of
his Lord, <span id="fr_1494"></span>[1495](#fn_1494.md) gives us many
prophecies. He sees Jesus, <span id="fr_1495"></span>[1496](#fn_1495.md)
“clothed with filthy garments,” <span
id="fr_1496"></span>[1497](#fn_1496.md) a stone with seven eyes, <span
id="fr_1497"></span>[1498](#fn_1497.md) a candle-stick all of gold with
lamps as many as the eyes, and two olive trees on the right side of the
bowl <span id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498.md) and on the left. After
he has described the horses, red, black, white, and grisled, <span
id="fr_1499"></span>[1500](#fn_1499.md) and the cutting off of the chariot
from Ephraim and of the horse from Jerusalem <span
id="fr_1500"></span>[1501](#fn_1500.md) he goes on to prophesy and predict
a king who shall be a poor man and who shall sit “upon a colt the foal
of an ass.” <span id="fr_1501"></span>[1502](#fn_1501.md) Malachi, the last
of all the prophets, speaks openly of the rejection of Israel and the
calling of the nations. “I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of
hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. For from the
rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same, my name is great
among the Gentiles: and in every place incense <span
id="fr_1502"></span>[1503](#fn_1502.md) is offered unto my name, and a pure
offering.” <span id="fr_1503"></span>[1504](#fn_1503.md) As for Isaiah,
Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, who can fully understand or adequately
explain them? The first of them seems to compose not a prophecy but a
gospel. The second speaks of a rod of an almond tree <span
id="fr_1504"></span>[1505](#fn_1504.md) and of a seething pot with its face
toward the north, <span id="fr_1505"></span>[1506](#fn_1505.md) and of a
leopard which has changed its spots. <span
id="fr_1506"></span>[1507](#fn_1506.md) He also goes four times through the
alphabet in different metres. <span id="fr_1507"></span>[1508](#fn_1507.md)
The beginning and ending of Ezekiel, the third of the four, are involved
in so great obscurity that like the commencement of Genesis they are not
studied by the Hebrews until they are thirty years old. Daniel, the
fourth and last of the four prophets, having knowledge of the times and
being interested in the whole world, in clear language proclaims the
stone cut out of the mountain without hands that overthrows all
kingdoms. <span id="fr_1508"></span>[1509](#fn_1508.md) David, who is our
Simonides, Pindar, and Alcæus, our Horace, our Catullus, and our Serenus
all in one, sings of Christ to his lyre; and on a psaltery with ten
strings calls him from the lower world to rise again. Solomon, a lover
of peace <span id="fr_1509"></span>[1510](#fn_1509.md) and of the Lord,
corrects morals, teaches nature, unites Christ and the church, and sings
a sweet marriage song <span id="fr_1510"></span>[1511](#fn_1510.md) to
celebrate that holy bridal. Esther, a type of the church, frees her
people from danger and, after having slain Haman whose name means
iniquity, hands down to posterity a memorable day and a great
feast. <span id="fr_1511"></span>[1512](#fn_1511.md) The book of things
omitted <span id="fr_1512"></span>[1513](#fn_1512.md) or epitome of the old
dispensation <span id="fr_1513"></span>[1514](#fn_1513.md) is of such
importance and value that without it any one who should claim to himself
a knowledge of the scriptures would make himself a laughing stock in his
own eyes. Every name used in it, nay even the conjunction of the words,
serves to throw light on narratives passed over in the books of Kings
and upon questions suggested by the gospel. Ezra and Nehemiah, that is
the Lord’s helper and His consoler, are united in a single book. They
restore the Temple and build up the walls of the city. In their pages we
see the throng of the Israelites returning to their native land, we read
of priests and Levites, of Israel proper and of proselytes; and we are
even told the several families to which the task of building the walls
and towers was assigned. These references convey one meaning upon the
surface, but another below it.

<span id="v.LIII-p141"></span>9. \[In Migne, 8.\] You see how, carried
away by my love of the scriptures, I have exceeded the limits of a
letter yet have not fully accomplished my object. We have heard only
what it is that we ought to know and to desire, so that we too may be
able to say with the psalmist:—“My soul breaketh out for the very
fervent desire that it hath alway unto thy judgments.” <span
id="fr_1514"></span>[1515](#fn_1514.md) But the saying of Socrates about
himself—“this only I know that I know nothing” <span
id="fr_1515"></span>[1516](#fn_1515.md) —is fulfilled in our case also. The
New Testament I will briefly deal with. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John are
the Lord’s team of four, <span id="fr_1516"></span>[1517](#fn_1516.md) the
true cherubim or store of knowledge. <span
id="fr_1517"></span>[1518](#fn_1517.md) With them the whole body is full of
eyes, <span id="fr_1518"></span>[1519](#fn_1518.md) they glitter as
sparks, <span id="fr_1519"></span>[1520](#fn_1519.md) they run and return
like lightning, <span id="fr_1520"></span>[1521](#fn_1520.md) their feet
are straight feet, <span id="fr_1521"></span>[1522](#fn_1521.md) and lifted
up, their backs also are winged, ready to fly in all directions. They
hold together each by each and are interwoven one with another: <span
id="fr_1522"></span>[1523](#fn_1522.md) like wheels within wheels they roll
along <span id="fr_1523"></span>[1524](#fn_1523.md) and go whithersoever
the breath of the Holy Spirit wafts them. <span
id="fr_1524"></span>[1525](#fn_1524.md) The apostle Paul writes to seven
churches <span id="fr_1525"></span>[1526](#fn_1525.md) (for the eighth
epistle—that to the Hebrews—is not generally counted in with the
others). He instructs Timothy and Titus; he intercedes with Philemon for
his runaway slave. <span id="fr_1526"></span>[1527](#fn_1526.md) Of him I
think it better to say nothing than to write inadequately. The Acts of
the Apostles seem to relate a mere unvarnished narrative descrip<span
id="page_102">p. 102</span> <span id="v.LIII-Page_102"></span>tive of
the infancy of the newly born church; but when once we realize that
their author is Luke the physician whose praise is in the gospel, <span
id="fr_1527"></span>[1528](#fn_1527.md) we shall see that all his words are
medicine for the sick soul. The apostles James, Peter, John, and Jude,
have published seven epistles at once spiritual and to the point, short
and long, short that is in words but lengthy in substance so that there
are few indeed who do not find themselves in the dark when they read
them. The apocalypse of John has as many mysteries as words. In saying
this I have said less than the book deserves. All praise of it is
inadequate; manifold meanings lie hid in its every word.

<span id="v.LIII-p156"></span>10. \[In Migne, 9.\] I beg of you, my dear
brother, to live among these books, to meditate upon them, to know
nothing else, to seek nothing else. Does not such a life seem to you a
foretaste of heaven here on earth? Let not the simplicity of the
scripture or the poorness of its vocabulary offend you; for these are
due either to the faults of translators or else to deliberate purpose:
for in this way it is better fitted for the instruction of an unlettered
congregation as the educated person can take one meaning and the
uneducated another from one and the same sentence. I am not so dull or
so forward as to profess that I myself know it, or that I can pluck upon
the earth the fruit which has its root in heaven, but I confess that I
should like to do so. I put myself before the man who sits idle and,
while I lay no claim to be a master, I readily pledge myself to be a
fellow-student. “Every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.” <span
id="fr_1528"></span>[1529](#fn_1528.md) Let us learn upon earth that
knowledge which will continue with us in heaven.

<span id="v.LIII-p158"></span>11. \[In Migne, 10.\] I will receive you
with open hands and—if I may boast and speak foolishly like
Hermagoras <span id="fr_1529"></span>[1530](#fn_1529.md) —I will strive to
learn with you whatever you desire to study. Eusebius who is here
regards you with the affection of a brother; he <span
id="fr_1530"></span>[1531](#fn_1530.md) has made your letter twice as
precious by telling me of your sincerity of character, your contempt for
the world, your constancy in friendship, and your love to Christ. The
letter bears on its face (without any aid from him) your prudence and
the charm of your style. Make haste then, I beseech you, and cut instead
of loosing the hawser which prevents your vessel from moving in the sea.
The man who sells his goods because he despises them and means to
renounce the world can have no desire to sell them dear. Count as money
gained the sum that you must expend upon your outfit. There is an old
saying that a miser lacks as much what he has as what he has not. The
believer has a whole world of wealth; the unbeliever has not a single
farthing. Let us always live “as having nothing and yet possessing all
things.” <span id="fr_1531"></span>[1532](#fn_1531.md) Food and raiment,
these are the Christian’s wealth. <span
id="fr_1532"></span>[1533](#fn_1532.md) If your property is in your own
power, <span id="fr_1533"></span>[1534](#fn_1533.md) sell it: if not, cast
it from you. “If any man…will take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke
also.” <span id="fr_1534"></span>[1535](#fn_1534.md) You are all for delay,
you wish to defer action: unless—so you argue—unless I sell my goods
piecemeal and with caution, Christ will be at a loss to feed his poor.
Nay, he who has offered himself to God, has given Him everything once
for all. The apostles did but forsake ships and nets. <span
id="fr_1535"></span>[1536](#fn_1535.md) The widow cast but two brass coins
into the treasury <span id="fr_1536"></span>[1537](#fn_1536.md) and yet she
shall be preferred before Crœsus <span
id="fr_1537"></span>[1538](#fn_1537.md) with all his wealth. He readily
despises all things who reflects always that he must die.
