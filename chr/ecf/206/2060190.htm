<p class="c16"><a name="vii.iii.i-p2"></A>This version was not undertaken with ecclesiastical sanction as was the case with the Gospels, but at the request of private friends, or from Jerome&#146;s &#8220;own sense of the imperious necessity of the work.&#8221; It was wholly made at Bethlehem, and was begun about <span class="c17"><a name="vii.iii.i-p2.1"></A>a.d.</span> 391, and finished about <span class="c17"><a name="vii.iii.i-p2.2"></A>a.d.</span> 404. The approximate dates of the several books are given before each Preface in the following pages.</p>
