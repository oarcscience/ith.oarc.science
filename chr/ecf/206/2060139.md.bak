<span id="v.CXXVIII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.CXXVIII-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXVIII. To Gaudentius.</span>

<span id="v.CXXVIII-p2"></span>Gaudentius had written from Rome to ask
Jerome’s advice as to the bringing up of his infant daughter; whom after
the religious fashion of the day he had dedicated to a life of
virginity. Jerome’s reply may be compared with his advice to Laeta
(Letter CVII.) which it closely resembles. It is noticeable also for the
vivid account which it gives of the sack of Rome by Alaric in <span
class="c17"><span id="v.CXXVIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 410. The date
of the letter is <span class="c17"><span
id="v.CXXVIII-p2.2"></span>a.d.</span> 413.

<span id="v.CXXVIII-p3"></span>1. It is hard to write to a little girl
who cannot understand what you say, of whose mind you know nothing, and
of whose inclinations it would be rash to prophesy. In the words of a
famous orator “she is to be praised more for what she will be than for
what she is.” <span id="fr_3584"></span>[3585](#fn_3584.md) For how can you
speak of self-control to a child who is eager for cakes, who babbles on
her mother’s knee, and to whom honey is sweeter than any words? Will she
hear the deep things of the apostle when all her delight is in nursery
tales? Will she heed the dark sayings of the prophets when her nurse can
frighten her by a frowning face? Or will she comprehend the majesty of
the gospel, when its splendour dazzles the keenest intellect? Shall I
urge her to obey her parents when with her chubby hand she beats her
smiling mother? For such reasons as these my dear Pacatula must read
some other time the letter that I send her now. Meanwhile let her learn
the alphabet, spelling, grammar, and syntax. To induce her to repeat her
lessons with her little shrill voice, hold out to her as rewards cakes
and mead and sweetmeats. <span id="fr_3585"></span>[3586](#fn_3585.md) She
will make haste to perform her task if she hopes afterwards to get some
bright bunch of flowers, some glittering bauble, some enchanting doll.
She must also learn to spin, shaping the yarn with her tender thumb;
for, even if she constantly breaks the threads, a day will come when she
will no longer break them. Then when she has finished her lessons she
ought to have some recreation. At such times she may hang round her
mother’s neck, or snatch kisses from her relations. Reward her for
singing psalms that she may love what she has to learn. Her task will
then become a pleasure to her and no compulsion will be necessary.

<span id="v.CXXVIII-p6"></span>2. Some mothers when they have vowed a
daughter to virginity clothe her in sombre garments, wrap her up in a
dark cloak, and let her have neither linen nor gold ornaments. They
wisely refuse to accustom her to what she will afterwards have to lay
aside. Others act on the opposite principle. “What is the use,” say
they, “of keeping such things from her? Will she not see them with
others? Women are fond of finery and many whose chastity is beyond
question dress not for men but for themselves. Give her what she asks
for, but shew her that those are most praised who ask for nothing. It is
better that she should enjoy things to the full and so learn to despise
them than that from not having them she should wish to have them.”
“This,” they continue, “was the plan which the Lord adopted with the
children of Israel. When they longed for the fleshpots of Egypt He sent
them flights of quails and allowed them to gorge themselves until they
were sick. <span id="fr_3586"></span>[3587](#fn_3586.md) Those who have
once lived worldly lives more readily forego the pleasures of sense than
such as from their youth up have known nothing of desire.” For while the
former—so they argue—trample on what they know, the latter are attracted
by what is to them unknown. While the former penitently shun the
insidious advances which pleasure makes, the latter coquet with the
allurements of sense and fancying them to be as sweet as honey find them
to be deadly poison. They quote the passage which says that “the lips of
a strange woman drop as an honeycomb;” <span
id="fr_3587"></span>[3588](#fn_3587.md) which is sweet indeed in the
eater’s mouth but is afterwards found more bitter than gall. <span
id="fr_3588"></span>[3589](#fn_3588.md) This they argue, is the reason that
neither honey nor wax is offered in the sacrifices of the Lord, <span
id="fr_3589"></span>[3590](#fn_3589.md) and that oil the product of the
bitter olive is burned in His temple. <span
id="fr_3590"></span>[3591](#fn_3590.md) Moreover it is with bitter herbs
that the passover is eaten, <span id="fr_3591"></span>[3592](#fn_3591.md)
and “with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.” <span
id="fr_3592"></span>[3593](#fn_3592.md) He that receives these shall suffer
persecution in the world. Wherefore the prophet symbolically sings: “I
sat alone because I was filled with bitterness.” <span
id="fr_3593"></span>[3594](#fn_3593.md)

<span id="v.CXXVIII-p15"></span>3. What then, I reply? Is youth to run
riot that self-indulgence may afterwards be more resolutely rejected?
Far from it, they rejoin: “let every man, wherein he is called, therein
abide. <span id="fr_3594"></span>[3595](#fn_3594.md) Is any called being
circumcised,”—<span id="page_259">p. 259</span> <span
id="v.CXXVIII-Page_259"></span>that is, as a virgin?—“let him not become
uncircumcised” <span id="fr_3595"></span>[3596](#fn_3595.md) —that is, let
him not seek the coat of marriage given to Adam on his expulsion from
the paradise of virginity. <span id="fr_3596"></span>[3597](#fn_3596.md)
“Is any called in uncircumcision,”—that is, having a wife and enveloped
in the skin of matrimony? let him not seek the nakedness of
virginity <span id="fr_3597"></span>[3598](#fn_3597.md) and of that eternal
chastity which he has lost once for all. No, let him “possess his vessel
in sanctification and honour,” <span
id="fr_3598"></span>[3599](#fn_3598.md) let him drink of his own wells not
out of the dissolute cisterns <span id="fr_3599"></span>[3600](#fn_3599.md)
of the harlots which cannot hold within them the pure waters of
chastity. <span id="fr_3600"></span>[3601](#fn_3600.md) The same Paul also
in the same chapter, when discussing the subjects of virginity and
marriage, calls those who are married slaves of the flesh, but those not
under the yoke of wedlock freemen who serve the Lord in all
freedom. <span id="fr_3601"></span>[3602](#fn_3601.md)

<span id="v.CXXVIII-p24"></span>What I say I do not say as universally
applicable; my treatment of the subject is only partial. I speak of some
only, not of all. However my words are addressed to those of both sexes,
and not only to “the weaker vessel.” <span
id="fr_3602"></span>[3603](#fn_3602.md) Are you a virgin? Why then do you
find pleasure in the society of a woman? Why do you commit to the high
seas your frail patched boat, why do you so confidently face the great
peril of a dangerous voyage? You know not what you desire, and yet you
cling to her as though you had either desired her before or, to put it
as leniently as possible, as though you would hereafter desire her.
Women, you will say, make better servants than men. In that case choose
a misshapen old woman, choose one whose continence is approved in the
Lord. Why should you find pleasure in a young girl, pretty, and
voluptuous? You frequent the baths, walk abroad sleek and ruddy, eat
flesh, abound in riches, and wear the most expensive clothes; and yet
you fancy that you can sleep safely beside a death-dealing serpent. You
tell me perhaps that you do not live in the same house with her. This is
only true at night. But you spend whole days in conversing with her. Why
do you sit alone with her? Why do you dispense with witnesses? By so
doing if you do not actually sin you appear to do so, and (so important
is your influence) you embolden unhappy men by your example to do what
is wrong. You too, whether virgin or widow, why do you allow a man to
detain you in conversation so long? Why are you not afraid to be left
alone with him? At least go out of doors to satisfy the wants of nature,
and for this at any rate leave the man with whom you have given yourself
more liberty than you would with your brother, and have behaved more
immodestly than you would with your husband. You have some question, you
say, to ask concerning the holy scriptures. If so, ask it publicly; let
your maids and your attendants hear it. “Everything that is made
manifest is light.” <span id="fr_3603"></span>[3604](#fn_3603.md) He who
says only what he ought does not look for a corner to say it in; he is
glad to have hearers for he likes to be praised. He must be a fine
teacher, on the other hand, who thinks little of men, does not care for
the brothers, and labours in secret merely to instruct just one weak
woman!

<span id="v.CXXVIII-p27"></span>3*a.* I have wandered for a little from
my immediate subject to discuss the procedure of others in such a case
as yours; and while it is my object to train, nay rather to nurse, the
infant Pacatula, I have in a moment drawn upon myself the hostility of
many women who are by no means daughters of peace. <span
id="fr_3604"></span>[3605](#fn_3604.md) But I shall now return to my proper
theme.

<span id="v.CXXVIII-p29"></span>A girl should associate only with girls,
she should know nothing of boys and should dread even playing with them.
She should never hear an unclean word, and if amid the bustle of the
household she should chance to hear one, she should not understand it.
Her mother’s nod should be to her as much a command as a spoken
injunction. She should love her as her parent, obey her as her mistress,
and reverence her as her teacher. She is now a child without teeth and
without ideas, but, as soon as she is seven years old, a blushing girl
knowing what she ought not to say and hesitating as to what she ought,
she should until she is grown up commit to memory the psalter and the
books of Solomon; the gospels, the apostles and the prophets should be
the treasure of her heart. She should not appear in public too freely or
too frequently attend crowded churches. All her pleasure should be in
her chamber. She must never look at young men or turn her eyes upon
curled fops; and the wanton songs of sweet voiced girls which wound the
soul through the ears must be kept from her. The more freedom of access
such persons possess, the harder is it to avoid them when they come; and
what they have once learned themselves they will secretly teach her and
will thus contaminate our secluded Danaë by the talk of the crowd. Give
her for guardian and companion a mistress and a governess, one not given
to much wine or in the apostle’s words idle and a tattler, but sober,
grave, industrious in spinning wool <span
id="fr_3605"></span>[3606](#fn_3605.md) and one whose words will form her
childish mind to the practice of virtue. For, as water follows a finger
drawn <span id="page_260">p. 260</span> <span
id="v.CXXVIII-Page_260"></span>through the sand, so one of soft and
tender years is pliable for good or evil; she can be drawn in whatever
direction you choose to guide her. Moreover spruce and gay young men
often seek access for themselves by paying court to nurses or dependants
or even by bribing them, and when they have thus gently effected their
approach they blow up the first spark of passion until it bursts into
flame and little by little advance to the most shameless requests. And
it is quite impossible to check them then, for the verse is proved true
in their case: “It is ill rebuking what you have once allowed to become
ingrained.” <span id="fr_3606"></span>[3607](#fn_3606.md) I am ashamed to
say it and yet I must; high born ladies who have rejected more high born
suitors cohabit with men of the lowest grade and even with slaves.
Sometimes in the name of religion and under the cloak of a desire for
celibacy they actually desert their husbands in favour of such
paramours. You may often see a Helen following her Paris without the
smallest dread of Menelaus. Such persons we see and mourn for but we
cannot punish, for the multitude of sinners procures tolerance for the
sin.

<span id="v.CXXVIII-p32"></span>4. The world sinks into ruin: yes! but
shameful to say our sins still live and flourish. The renowned city, the
capital of the Roman Empire, is swallowed up in one tremendous fire; and
there is no part of the earth where Romans are not in exile. Churches
once held sacred are now but heaps of dust and ashes; and yet we have
our minds set on the desire of gain. We live as though we are going to
die tomorrow; yet we build as though we are going to live always in this
world. <span id="fr_3607"></span>[3608](#fn_3607.md) Our walls shine with
gold, our ceilings also and the capitals of our pillars; yet Christ dies
before our doors naked and hungry in the persons of His poor. The
pontiff Aaron, we read, faced the raging flames, and by putting fire in
his censer checked the wrath of God. The High Priest stood between the
dead and the living, and the fire dared not pass his feet. <span
id="fr_3608"></span>[3609](#fn_3608.md) On another occasion God said to
Moses, “Let me alone.…that I may consume this people,” <span
id="fr_3609"></span>[3610](#fn_3609.md) shewing by the words “let me alone”
that he can be withheld from doing what he threatens. The prayers of His
servant hindered His power. Who, think you, is there now under heaven
able to stay God’s wrath, to face the flame of His judgment, and to say
with the apostle, “I could wish that I myself were accursed for my
brethren”? <span id="fr_3610"></span>[3611](#fn_3610.md) Flocks and
shepherds perish together, because as it is with the people, so is it
with the priest. <span id="fr_3611"></span>[3612](#fn_3611.md) Of old it
was not so. Then Moses spoke in a passion of pity, “yet now if thou wilt
forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy
book.” <span id="fr_3612"></span>[3613](#fn_3612.md) He is not satisfied to
secure his own salvation, he desires to perish with those that perish.
And he is right, for “in the multitude of people is the king’s
honour.” <span id="fr_3613"></span>[3614](#fn_3613.md)

<span id="v.CXXVIII-p40"></span>Such are the times in which our little
Pacatula is born. Such are the swaddling clothes in which she draws her
first breath; she is destined to know of tears before laughter and to
feel sorrow sooner than joy. And hardly does she come upon the stage
when she is called on to make her exit. Let her then suppose that the
world has always been what it is now. Let her know nothing of the past,
let her shun the present, and let her long for the future.

<span id="v.CXXVIII-p41"></span>These thoughts of mine are but hastily
mustered. For my grief for lost friends has known no intermission and
only recently have I recovered sufficient composure to write an old
man’s letter to a little child. My affection for you, brother
Gaudentius, has induced me to make the attempt and I have thought it
better to say a few words than to say nothing at all. The grief that
paralyses my will will excuse my brevity; whereas, were I to say
nothing, the sincerity of my friendship might well be doubted.
