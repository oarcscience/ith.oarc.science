<span id="v.CXXXII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.CXXXII-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXXII. From Augustine.</span>

<span id="v.CXXXII-p2"></span>In this letter Augustine deals with the
statement of [James ii. 10](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010.md)<span
id="v.CXXXII-p2.1"></span> (“whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet
offend in one point, he is guilty of all”) and explains it by saying
that every breach of the law is a breach of love. He also takes occasion
to criticise two doctrines of the schools then prevalent, (1) that all
sins are equal and (2) that he who has one virtue has all and that all
virtues are wanting to him who lacks one.

<span id="v.CXXXII-p3"></span>The date of the letter is 415 <span
class="c17"><span id="v.CXXXII-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> Its number in
the Letters of Augustine is CLXVII.
