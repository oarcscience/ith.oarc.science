id="v.CXXXIV-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXXIV. To Augustine.</span>

<span id="v.CXXXIV-p2"></span>Jerome acknowledges the receipt of Letters
CXXXI. and CXXXII. and excuses himself from answering the questions
raised in them on the twofold ground (1) that the times are evil and (2)
that it is inexpedient that he should be supposed to differ from
Augustine. He prays for the speedy extinction of Pelagianism, regrets
that he cannot send Augustine a critical Latin text of the O.T., and
concludes with a number of salutations from himself and those with him.
The date of the letter is 416 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.CXXXIV-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> Its number in Augustine’s Letters
is CLXXII.
