<span id="v.CXXVII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.CXXVII-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXVII. To Principia.</span>

<span id="v.CXXVII-p2"></span>This letter is really a memoir of Marcella
(for whom see note on Letter XXIII.) addressed to her greatest friend.
After describing her history, character, and favourite studies, Jerome
goes on to recount her eminent services in the cause of orthodoxy at a
time when, through the efforts of Rufinus, it seemed likely that
Origenism would prevail at Rome (§§9, 10). He briefly relates the fall
of the city and the horrors consequent upon it (§§12, 13) which appear
to have been the immediate cause of Marcella’s death (§14). The date of
the letter is 412 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.CXXVII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.CXXVII-p3"></span>1. You have besought me often and
earnestly, Principia, <span id="fr_3521"></span>[3522](#fn_3521.md) virgin
of Christ, to dedicate a letter to the memory of that holy woman
Marcella, <span id="fr_3522"></span>[3523](#fn_3522.md) and to set forth
the goodness long enjoyed by us for others to know and to imitate. I am
so anxious myself to do justice to her merits that it grieves me that
you should spur me on and fancy that your entreaties are needed when I
do not yield even to you in love of her. In putting upon record her
signal virtues I shall receive far more benefit myself than I can
possibly confer upon others. If I have hitherto remained silent and have
allowed two years to go over without making any sign, this has not been
owing to a wish to ignore her as you wrongly suppose, but to an
incredible sorrow which so overcame my mind that I judged it better to
remain silent for a while than to praise her virtues in inadequate
language. Neither will I now follow the rules of rhetoric in eulogizing
one so dear to both of us and to all the saints, Marcella the glory of
her native Rome. I will not set forth her illustrious family and lofty
lineage, nor will I trace her pedigree through a line of consuls and
prætorian prefects. I will praise her for nothing but the virtue which
is her own and which is the more noble, because forsaking both wealth
and rank she has sought the true nobility of poverty and lowliness.

<span id="v.CXXVII-p6"></span>2. Her father’s death left her an orphan,
and she had been married less than seven months when her husband was
taken from her. Then as she was young, and highborn, as well as
distinguished for her beauty—always an attraction to men—and her
self-control, an illustrious consular named Cerealis paid court to her
with great assiduity. Being an old man he offered to make over to her
his fortune so that she might consider herself less his wife than his
daughter. Her mother Albina went out of her way to secure for the young
widow so exalted a protector. But Marcella answered: “had I a wish to
marry and not rather to dedicate myself to perpetual chastity, I should
look for a husband and not for an inheritance;” and when her suitor
argued that sometimes old men live long while young men die early, she
cleverly retorted: “a young man may indeed die early, but an old man
cannot live long.” This decided rejection of Cerealis convinced others
that they had no hope of winning her hand.

<span id="v.CXXVII-p7"></span>In the gospel according to Luke we read
the following passage: “there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter
of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of great age, and had lived
with an husband seven years from her virginity; and she was a widow of
about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple but
served God with fastings and prayers night and day.” <span
id="fr_3523"></span>[3524](#fn_3523.md) It was no marvel that she won the
vision of the Saviour, whom she sought so earnestly. Let us then compare
her case with that of Marcella and we shall see that the latter has
every way the advantage. Anna lived with her husband seven years;
Marcella seven months. Anna only hoped for Christ; Marcella held Him
fast. Anna confessed him at His birth; Marcella believed in Him
crucified. Anna did not deny the Child; Marcella rejoiced in the Man as
king. I do not wish to draw distinctions between holy women on the score
of their merits, as some persons have made it a custom to do as regards
holy men and leaders of churches; the conclusion at which I aim is that,
as both have one task, so both have one reward.

<span id="v.CXXVII-p9"></span><span id="page_254">p. 254</span> <span
id="v.CXXVII-Page_254"></span>3. In a slander-loving community such as
Rome, filled as it formerly was with people from all parts and bearing
the palm for wickedness of all kinds, detraction assailed the upright
and strove to defile even the pure and the clean. In such an atmosphere
it is hard to escape from the breath of calumny. A stainless reputation
is difficult nay almost impossible to attain; the prophet yearns for it
but hardly hopes to win it: “Blessed,” he says, “are the undefiled in
the way who walk in the law of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3524"></span>[3525](#fn_3524.md) The undefiled in the way of this
world are those whose fair fame no breath of scandal has ever sullied,
and who have earned no reproach at the hands of their neighbours. It is
this which makes the Saviour say in the gospel: “agree with,” or be
complaisant to, “thine adversary whilst thou art in the way with
him.” <span id="fr_3525"></span>[3526](#fn_3525.md) Who ever heard a
slander of Marcella that deserved the least credit? Or who ever credited
such without making himself guilty of malice and defamation? No; she put
the Gentiles to confusion by shewing them the nature of that Christian
widowhood which her conscience and mien alike set forth. For women of
the world are wont to paint their faces with rouge and white-lead, to
wear robes of shining silk, to adorn themselves with jewels, to put gold
chains round their necks, to pierce their ears and hang in them the
costliest pearls of the Red Sea, <span
id="fr_3526"></span>[3527](#fn_3526.md) and to scent themselves with musk.
While they mourn for the husbands they have lost they rejoice at their
own deliverance and freedom to choose fresh partners—not, as God wills,
to obey these <span id="fr_3527"></span>[3528](#fn_3527.md) but to rule
over them.

<span id="v.CXXVII-p14"></span>With this object in view they select for
their partners poor men who contented with the mere name of husbands are
the more ready to put up with rivals as they know that, if they so much
as murmur, they will be cast off at once. Our widow’s clothing was meant
to keep out the cold and not to shew her figure. Of gold she would not
wear so much as a seal-ring, choosing to store her money in the stomachs
of the poor rather than to keep it at her own disposal. She went nowhere
without her mother, and would never see without witnesses such monks and
clergy as the needs of a large house required her to interview. Her
train was always composed of virgins and widows, and these women serious
and staid; for, as she well knew, the levity of the maids speaks ill for
the mistress and a woman’s character is shewn by her choice of
companions. <span id="fr_3528"></span>[3529](#fn_3528.md)

<span id="v.CXXVII-p16"></span>4. Her delight in the divine scriptures
was incredible. She was for ever singing, “Thy words have I hid in mine
heart that I might not sin against thee,” <span
id="fr_3529"></span>[3530](#fn_3529.md) as well as the words which describe
the perfect man, “his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law
doth he meditate day and night.” <span
id="fr_3530"></span>[3531](#fn_3530.md) This meditation in the law she
understood not of a review of the written words as among the Jews the
Pharisees think, but of action according to that saying of the apostle,
“whether, therefore, ye eat or drink or what soever ye do, do all to the
glory of God.” <span id="fr_3531"></span>[3532](#fn_3531.md) She remembered
also the prophet’s words, “through thy precepts I get
understanding,” <span id="fr_3532"></span>[3533](#fn_3532.md) and felt sure
that only when she had fulfilled these would she be permitted to
understand the scriptures. In this sense we read elsewhere that “Jesus
began both to do and teach.” <span id="fr_3533"></span>[3534](#fn_3533.md)
For teaching is put to the blush when a man’s conscience rebukes him;
and it is in vain that his tongue preaches poverty or teaches
alms-giving if he is rolling in the riches of Crœsus and if, in spite of
his threadbare cloak, he has silken robes at home to save from the moth.

<span id="v.CXXVII-p22"></span>Marcella practised fasting, but in
moderation. She abstained from eating flesh, and she knew rather the
scent of wine than its taste; touching it only for her stomach’s sake
and for her often infirmities. <span
id="fr_3534"></span>[3535](#fn_3534.md) She seldom appeared in public and
took care to avoid the houses of great ladies, that she might not be
forced to look upon what she had once for all renounced. She frequented
the basilicas of apostles and martyrs that she might escape from the
throng and give herself to private prayer. So obedient was she to her
mother that for her sake she did things of which she herself
disapproved. For example, when her mother, careless of her own
offspring, was for transferring all her property from her children and
grandchildren to her brother’s family, Marcella wished the money to be
given to the poor instead, and yet could not bring herself to thwart her
parent. Therefore she made over her ornaments and other effects to
persons already rich, content to throw away her money rather than to
sadden her mother’s heart.

<span id="v.CXXVII-p24"></span>5. In those days no highborn lady at Rome
had made profession of the monastic life, or had ventured—so strange and
ignominious and degrading did it then seem—publicly to call herself a
nun. It was from some priests of Alexandria, and from pope Athanasius,
and subsequently from Peter, <span id="fr_3535"></span>[3536](#fn_3535.md)
who, to escape the persecution of the Arian heretics, had all fled for
refuge to Rome as the safest haven in which they could find communion—it
was from these that Marcella heard of the life of the blessed Antony,
then still alive, and of the <span id="page_255">p. 255</span> <span
id="v.CXXVII-Page_255"></span>monasteries in the Thebaid founded by
Pachomius, and of the discipline laid down for virgins and for widows.
Nor was she ashamed to profess a life which she had thus learned to be
pleasing to Christ. Many years after her example was followed first by
Sophronia and then by others, of whom it may be well said in the words
of Ennius: <span id="fr_3536"></span>[3537](#fn_3536.md)

<span id="v.CXXVII-p27"></span>Would that ne’er in Pelion’s woods

<span id="v.CXXVII-p28"></span>Had the axe these pinetrees felled.

<span id="v.CXXVII-p29"></span>My revered friend Paula was blessed with
Marcella’s friendship, and it was in Marcella’s cell that Eustochium,
that paragon of virgins, was gradually trained. Thus it is easy to see
of what type the mistress was who found such pupils.

<span id="v.CXXVII-p30"></span>The unbelieving reader may perhaps laugh
at me for dwelling so long on the praises of mere women; yet if he will
but remember how holy women followed our Lord and Saviour and ministered
to Him of their substance, and how the three Marys stood before the
cross and especially how Mary Magdalen—called the tower <span
id="fr_3537"></span>[3538](#fn_3537.md) from the earnestness and glow of
her faith—was privileged to see the rising Christ first of all before
the very apostles, he will convict himself of pride sooner than me of
folly. For we judge of people’s virtue not by their sex but by their
character, and hold those to be worthy of the highest glory who have
renounced both rank and wealth. It was for this reason that Jesus loved
the evangelist John more than the other disciples. For John was of noble
birth <span id="fr_3538"></span>[3539](#fn_3538.md) and known to the high
priest, yet was so little appalled by the plottings of the Jews that he
introduced Peter into his court, <span
id="fr_3539"></span>[3540](#fn_3539.md) and was the only one of the
apostles bold enough to take his stand before the cross. For it was he
who took the Saviour’s parent to his own home; <span
id="fr_3540"></span>[3541](#fn_3540.md) it was the virgin son <span
id="fr_3541"></span>[3542](#fn_3541.md) who received the virgin mother as a
legacy from the Lord.

<span id="v.CXXVII-p36"></span>6. Marcella then lived the ascetic life
for many years, and found herself old before she bethought herself that
she had once been young. She often quoted with approval Plato’s saying
that philosophy consists in meditating on death. <span
id="fr_3542"></span>[3543](#fn_3542.md) A truth which our own apostle
indorses when he says: “for your salvation I die daily.” <span
id="fr_3543"></span>[3544](#fn_3543.md) Indeed according to the old copies
our Lord himself says: “whosoever doth not bear His cross daily and come
after me cannot be my disciple.” <span
id="fr_3544"></span>[3545](#fn_3544.md) Ages before, the Holy Spirit had
said by the prophet: “for thy sake are we killed all the day long: we
are counted as sheep for the slaughter.” <span
id="fr_3545"></span>[3546](#fn_3545.md) Many generations afterwards the
words were spoken: “remember the end and thou shalt never do
amiss,” <span id="fr_3546"></span>[3547](#fn_3546.md) as well as that
precept of the eloquent satirist: “live with death in your mind; time
flies; this say of mine is so much taken from it.” <span
id="fr_3547"></span>[3548](#fn_3547.md) Well then, as I was saying, she
passed her days and lived always in the thought that she must die. Her
very clothing was such as to remind her of the tomb, and she presented
herself as a living sacrifice, reasonable and acceptable, unto
God. <span id="fr_3548"></span>[3549](#fn_3548.md)

<span id="v.CXXVII-p44"></span>7. When the needs of the Church at length
brought me to Rome <span id="fr_3549"></span>[3550](#fn_3549.md) in company
with the reverend pontiffs, Paulinus and Epiphanius—the first of whom
ruled the church of the Syrian Antioch while the second presided over
that of Salamis in Cyprus,—I in my modesty was for avoiding the eyes of
highborn ladies, yet she pleaded so earnestly, “both in season and out
of season” <span id="fr_3550"></span>[3551](#fn_3550.md) as the apostle
says, that at last her perseverance overcame my reluctance. And, as in
those days my name was held in some renown as that of a student of the
scriptures, she never came to see me that she did not ask me some
question concerning them, nor would she at once acquiesce in my
explanations but on the contrary would dispute them; not, however, for
argument’s sake but to learn the answers to those objections which
might, as she saw, be made to my statements. How much virtue and
ability, how much holiness and purity I found in her I am afraid to say;
both lest I may exceed the bounds of men’s belief and lest I may
increase your sorrow by reminding you of the blessings that you have
lost. This much only will I say, that whatever in me was the fruit of
long study and as such made by constant meditation a part of my nature,
this she tasted, this she learned and made her own. Consequently after
my departure from Rome, in case of a dispute arising as to the testimony
of scripture on any subject, recourse was had to her to settle it. And
so wise was she and so well did she understand what philosophers call
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.CXXVII-p46.2"></span>τό πρέπον</span>,
that is, the becoming, in what she did, that when she answered questions
she gave her own opinion not as her own but as from me or some one else,
thus admitting that what she taught she had herself learned from others.
For she knew that the apostle had said: “I suffer not a <span
id="page_256">p. 256</span> <span id="v.CXXVII-Page_256"></span>woman to
teach,” <span id="fr_3551"></span>[3552](#fn_3551.md) and she would not
seem to inflict a wrong upon the male sex many of whom (including
sometimes priests) questioned her concerning obscure and doubtful
points.

<span id="v.CXXVII-p48"></span>8. I am told that my place with her was
immediately taken by you, that you attached yourself to her, and that,
as the saying goes, you never let even a hair’s-breadth <span
id="fr_3552"></span>[3553](#fn_3552.md) come between her and you. You both
lived in the same house and occupied the same room so that every one in
the city knew for certain that you had found a mother in her and she a
daughter in you. In the suburbs you found for yourselves a monastic
seclusion, and chose the country instead of the town because of its
loneliness. For a long time you lived together, and as many ladies
shaped their conduct by your examples, I had the joy of seeing Rome
transformed into another Jerusalem. Monastic establishments for virgins
became numerous, and of hermits there were countless numbers. In fact so
many were the servants of God that monasticism which had before been a
term of reproach became subsequently one of honour. Meantime we consoled
each other for our separation by words of mutual encouragement, and
discharged in the spirit the debt which in the flesh we could not pay.
We always went to meet each other’s letters, tried to outdo each other
in attentions, and anticipated each other in courteous inquiries. Not
much was lost by a separation thus effectually bridged by a constant
correspondence.

<span id="v.CXXVII-p50"></span>9. While Marcella was thus serving the
Lord in holy tranquillity, there arose in these provinces a tornado of
heresy which threw everything into confusion; indeed so great was the
fury into which it lashed itself that it spared neither itself nor
anything that was good. And as if it were too little to have disturbed
everything here, it introduced a ship <span
id="fr_3553"></span>[3554](#fn_3553.md) freighted with blasphemies into the
port of Rome itself. The dish soon found itself a cover; <span
id="fr_3554"></span>[3555](#fn_3554.md) and the muddy feet of heretics
fouled the clear waters <span id="fr_3555"></span>[3556](#fn_3555.md) of
the faith of Rome. No wonder that in the streets and in the market
places a soothsayer can strike fools on the back or, catching up his
cudgel, shatter the teeth of such as carp at him; when such venomous and
filthy teaching as this has found at Rome dupes whom it can lead astray.
Next came the scandalous version <span
id="fr_3556"></span>[3557](#fn_3556.md) of Origen’s book *On First
Principles,* and that ‘fortunate’ disciple <span
id="fr_3557"></span>[3558](#fn_3557.md) who would have been indeed
fortunate had he never fallen in with such a master. Next followed the
confutation set forth by my supporters, which destroyed the case of the
Pharisees <span id="fr_3558"></span>[3559](#fn_3558.md) and threw them into
confusion. It was then that the holy Marcella, who had long held back
lest she should be thought to act from party motives, threw herself into
the breach. Conscious that the faith of Rome—once praised by an
apostle <span id="fr_3559"></span>[3560](#fn_3559.md) —was now in danger,
and that this new heresy was drawing to itself not only priests and
monks but also many of the laity besides imposing on the bishop <span
id="fr_3560"></span>[3561](#fn_3560.md) who fancied others as guileless as
he was himself, she publicly withstood its teachers choosing to please
God rather than men.

<span id="v.CXXVII-p59"></span>10. In the gospel the Saviour commends
the unjust steward because, although he defrauded his master, he acted
wisely for his own interests. <span id="fr_3561"></span>[3562](#fn_3561.md)
The heretics in this instance pursued the same course; for, seeing how
great a matter a little fire had kindled, <span
id="fr_3562"></span>[3563](#fn_3562.md) and that the flames applied by them
to the foundations had by this time reached the housetops, and that the
deception practised on many could no longer be hid, they asked for and
obtained letters of commendation from the church, <span
id="fr_3563"></span>[3564](#fn_3563.md) so that it might appear that till
the day of their departure they had continued in full communion with it.
Shortly afterwards <span id="fr_3564"></span>[3565](#fn_3564.md) the
distinguished Anastasius succeeded to the pontificate; but he was soon
taken away, for it was not fitting that the head of the world should be
struck off <span id="fr_3565"></span>[3566](#fn_3565.md) during the
episcopate of one so great. He was removed, no doubt, that he might not
seek to turn away by his prayers the sentence of God passed once for
all. For the words of the Lord to Jeremiah concerning Israel applied
equally to Rome: “pray not for this people for their good. When they
fast I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt-offering and
oblation, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword
and by the famine and by the pestilence.” <span
id="fr_3566"></span>[3567](#fn_3566.md) You will say, what has this to do
with the praises of Marcella? I reply, She it was who originated the
condemnation of the heretics. She it was who furnished witnesses first
taught by them and then carried away by their heretical teaching. She it
was who showed how large a number they had deceived and who brought up
against them the impious books *On First Principles,* books which were
passing from hand to hand after being ‘improved’ by the hand of the
scorpion. <span id="fr_3567"></span>[3568](#fn_3567.md) <span
id="page_257">p. 257</span> <span id="v.CXXVII-Page_257"></span>She it
was lastly who called on the heretics in letter after letter to appear
in their own defence. They did not indeed venture to come, for they were
so conscience-stricken that they let the case go against them by default
rather than face their accusers and be convicted by them. This glorious
victory originated with Marcella, she was the source and cause of this
great blessing. You who shared the honour with her know that I speak the
truth. You know too that out of many incidents I only mention a few, not
to tire out the reader by a wearisome recapitulation. Were I to say
more, ill natured persons might fancy me, under pretext of commending a
woman’s virtues, to be giving vent to my own rancour. I will pass now to
the remainder of my story.

<span id="v.CXXVII-p67"></span>11. The whirlwind <span
id="fr_3568"></span>[3569](#fn_3568.md) passed from the West into the East
and threatened in its passage to shipwreck many a noble craft. Then were
the words of Jesus fulfilled: “when the son of man cometh, shall he find
faith on the earth?” <span id="fr_3569"></span>[3570](#fn_3569.md) The love
of many waxed cold. <span id="fr_3570"></span>[3571](#fn_3570.md) Yet the
few who still loved the true faith rallied to my side. Men openly sought
to take their lives and every expedient was employed against them. So
hotly indeed did the persecution rage that “Barnabas also was carried
away with their dissimulation;” <span
id="fr_3571"></span>[3572](#fn_3571.md) nay more he committed murder, if
not in actual violence at least in will. Then behold God blew and the
tempest passed away; so that the prediction of the prophet was
fulfilled, “thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their
dust. <span id="fr_3572"></span>[3573](#fn_3572.md) In that very day his
thoughts perish,” <span id="fr_3573"></span>[3574](#fn_3573.md) as also the
gospel-saying, “Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of
thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?” <span
id="fr_3574"></span>[3575](#fn_3574.md)

<span id="v.CXXVII-p75"></span>12. Whilst these things were happening in
Jebus <span id="fr_3575"></span>[3576](#fn_3575.md) a dreadful rumour came
from the West. Rome had been besieged <span
id="fr_3576"></span>[3577](#fn_3576.md) and its citizens had been forced to
buy their lives with gold. Then thus despoiled they had been besieged
again so as to lose not their substance only but their lives. My voice
sticks in my throat; and, as I dictate, sobs choke my utterance. The
City which had taken the whole world was itself taken; <span
id="fr_3577"></span>[3578](#fn_3577.md) nay more famine was beforehand with
the sword and but few citizens were left to be made captives. In their
frenzy the starving people had recourse to hideous food; and tore each
other limb from limb that they might have flesh to eat. Even the mother
did not spare the babe at her breast. In the night was Moab taken, in
the night did her wall fall down. <span
id="fr_3578"></span>[3579](#fn_3578.md) “O God, the heathen have come into
thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have made
Jerusalem an orchard. <span id="fr_3579"></span>[3580](#fn_3579.md) The
dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of
the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. Their
blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was
none to bury them.” <span id="fr_3580"></span>[3581](#fn_3580.md)

<span id="v.CXXVII-p82"></span>Who can set forth the carnage of that
night?

<span id="v.CXXVII-p83"></span>What tears are equal to its agony?

<span id="v.CXXVII-p84"></span>Of ancient date a sovran city falls;

<span id="v.CXXVII-p85"></span>And lifeless in its streets and houses
lie

<span id="v.CXXVII-p86"></span>Unnumbered bodies of its citizens.

<span id="v.CXXVII-p87"></span>In many a ghastly shape doth death
appear. <span id="fr_3581"></span>[3582](#fn_3581.md)

<span id="v.CXXVII-p89"></span>13. Meantime, as was natural in a scene
of such confusion, one of the bloodstained victors found his way into
Marcella’s house. Now be it mine to say what I have heard, <span
id="fr_3582"></span>[3583](#fn_3582.md) to relate what holy men have seen;
for there were some such present and they say that you too were with her
in the hour of danger. When the soldiers entered she is said to have
received them without any look of alarm; and when they asked her for
gold she pointed to her coarse dress to shew them that she had no buried
treasure. However they would not believe in her self-chosen poverty, but
scourged her and beat her with cudgels. She is said to have felt no pain
but to have thrown herself at their feet and to have pleaded with tears
for you, that you might not be taken from her, or owing to your youth
have to endure what she as an old woman had no occasion to fear. Christ
softened their hard hearts and even among bloodstained swords natural
affection asserted its rights. The barbarians conveyed both you and her
to the basilica of the apostle Paul, that you might find there either a
place of safety or, if not that, at least a tomb. Hereupon Marcella is
said to have burst into great joy and to have thanked God for having
kept you unharmed in answer to her prayer. She said she was thankful too
that the taking of the city had found her poor, not made her so, that
she was now in want of daily bread, that Christ satisfied her needs so
that she no longer felt hunger, that she was able to say in word and in
deed: “naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return
thither: the Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name
of the Lord.” <span id="fr_3583"></span>[3584](#fn_3583.md)

<span id="v.CXXVII-p92"></span>14. After a few days she fell asleep in
the Lord; but to the last her powers remained unimpaired. You she made
the heir of her <span id="page_258">p. 258</span> <span
id="v.CXXVII-Page_258"></span>poverty, or rather the poor through you.
When she closed her eyes, it was in your arms; when she breathed her
last breath, your lips received it; you shed tears but she smiled
conscious of having led a good life and hoping for her reward hereafter.

<span id="v.CXXVII-p93"></span>In one short night I have dictated this
letter in honour of you, revered Marcella, and of you, my daughter
Principia; not to shew off my own eloquence but to express my heartfelt
gratitude to you both; my one desire has been to please both God and my
readers.
