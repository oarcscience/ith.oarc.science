<span id="v.XLVII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XLVII-p1.1"></span>Letter XLVII. To Desiderius.</span>

<span id="v.XLVII-p2"></span>Jerome invites two of his old friends at
Rome, Desiderius and his sister (or wife) Serenilla, to join him at
Bethlehem. It is possible but not probable that this Desiderius is the
same with Desiderius of Aquitaine, who afterwards induced Jerome to
write against Vigilantius.

<span id="v.XLVII-p3"></span>An interval of seven years separates this
letter (of which the date is 393 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XLVII-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span>) from the preceding, and all the
letters written during this period have wholly perished.

<span id="v.XLVII-p4"></span>1. Surprised as I have been, my excellent
friend, to read the language which your kindness has prompted you to
hold concerning me, I have rejoiced that I possess the testimony of one
both eloquent and sincere; but when I turn from you to myself I feel
vexed that, owing to my unworthiness, your words of praise and eulogy
rather weigh me down than lift me up. You know, of course, that I make
it a principle to raise the standard of humility, and to prepare for
scaling the heights by walking for the present in the lowest places. For
what am I or what is my significance that I should have the voice of
learning raised to bear witness of me, or that the palm of eloquence
should be laid at my feet by one whose style is so charming that it has
almost deterred me from writing a letter at all? I must, however, make
the attempt in order that charity which seeks not <span id="page_66">p.
66</span> <span id="v.XLVII-Page_66"></span>her own <span
id="fr_1026"></span>[1027](#fn_1026) but always her neighbor’s good, may
at least return a compliment, since it cannot convey a lesson.

<span id="v.XLVII-p6"></span>2. I offer my congratulations to you and to
your holy and revered sister, <span id="fr_1027"></span>[1028](#fn_1027)
Serenilla, who, true to her name, <span
id="fr_1028"></span>[1029](#fn_1028) has trodden down the troubled waves
of the world, and has passed to Christ’s calm haven: a happiness
which—if we may trust the augury of your name—is in store for you also.
For we read that the holy Daniel was called “a man of desires,” <span
id="fr_1029"></span>[1030](#fn_1029) and the friend of God, because he
desired to know His mysteries. Therefore, I do with pleasure what the
revered Paula has asked of me. I urge and implore you both by the
charity of the Lord that you will give your presence to us, and that a
visit to the holy places may induce you to enrich us with this great
gift. Even supposing that you do not care for our society, it is still
your duty as believers to worship on the spot where the Lord’s feet once
stood and to see for yourselves the still fresh traces of His birth, His
cross, and His passion.

<span id="v.XLVII-p10"></span>3. Several of my little pieces have flown
away out of their nest, and have rashly sought for themselves the honor
of publication. I have not sent you any lest I should send works which
you already have. But if you care to borrow copies of them, you can do
so either from our holy sister, Marcella, who has her abode upon the
Aventine, or from that holy man, Domnio, who is the Lot of our
times. <span id="fr_1030"></span>[1031](#fn_1030) Meantime, I look for
your arrival, and will give you all I have when you once come; or, if
any hindrances prevent you from joining us, I will gladly send you such
treatises as you shall desire. Following the example of
Tranquillus <span id="fr_1031"></span>[1032](#fn_1031) and of Apollonius
the Greek, <span id="fr_1032"></span>[1033](#fn_1032) I have written a
book concerning illustrious men <span
id="fr_1033"></span>[1034](#fn_1033) from the apostles’ time to our own;
and after enumerating a great number I have put myself down on the last
page as one born out of due time, and the least of all Christians. <span
id="fr_1034"></span>[1035](#fn_1034) Here I have found it necessary to
give a short account of my writings down to the fourteenth year <span
id="fr_1035"></span>[1036](#fn_1035) of the Emperor Theodosius. If you
find, on procuring this treatise from the persons mentioned above, that
there are any pieces mentioned which you have not already got, I will
have them copied for you by degrees, if you wish it.
