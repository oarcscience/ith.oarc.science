<span id="v.XII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XII-p1.1"></span>Letter XII. To Antony, Monk.</span>

<span id="v.XII-p2"></span>The subject of this letter is similar to that
of the preceding. Of Antony nothing is known except that some <span
class="c17"><span id="v.XII-p2.1"></span>mss.</span> describe him as “of
Æmona.” The date of the letter is 374 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XII-p2.2"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.XII-p3"></span>While the disciples were disputing concerning
precedence our Lord, the teacher of <span id="page_13">p. 13</span>
<span id="v.XII-Page_13"></span>humility, took a little child and said:
“Except ye be converted and become as little children ye cannot enter
the kingdom of heaven.” <span id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157) And lest
He should seem to preach more than he practised, He fulfilled His own
precept in His life. For He washed His disciples’ feet, <span
id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158) he received the traitor with a
kiss, <span id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159) He conversed with the
woman of Samaria, <span id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160) He spoke of
the kingdom of heaven with Mary at His feet, <span
id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161) and when He rose again from the dead
He showed Himself first to some poor women. <span
id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162) Pride is opposed to humility, and
through it Satan lost his eminence as an archangel. The Jewish people
perished in their pride, for while they claimed the chief seats and
salutations in the market place, <span id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163)
they were superseded by the Gentiles, who had before been counted as “a
drop of a bucket.” <span id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164) Two poor
fishermen, Peter and James, were sent to confute the sophists and the
wise men of the world. As the Scripture says: “God resisteth the proud
and giveth grace to the humble.” <span id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165)
Think, brother, what a sin it must be which has God for its opponent. In
the Gospel the Pharisee is rejected because of his pride, and the
publican is accepted because of his humility. <span
id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166)

<span id="v.XII-p14"></span>Now, unless I am mistaken, I have already
sent you ten letters, affectionate and earnest, whilst you have not
deigned to give me even a single line. The Lord speaks to His servants,
but you, my brother servant, refuse to speak to me. Believe me, if
reserve did not check my pen, I could show my annoyance in such
invective that you would have to reply—even though it might be in anger.
But since anger is human, and a Christian must not act injuriously, I
fall back once more on entreaty, and beg you to love one who loves you,
and to write to him as a servant should to his fellow-servant. Farewell
in the Lord.
