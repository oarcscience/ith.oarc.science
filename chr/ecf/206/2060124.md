<span id="v.CXIII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.CXIII-p1.1"></span>Letter CXIII. From Theophilus to Jerome.</span>

<span id="v.CXIII-p2"></span>Theophilus, bishop of Alexandria, had
compiled an invective against John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople
who was nosy (largely through his efforts) an exile from his see. This
he now sends to Jerome with a request that the latter will render it
into Latin for dissemination in the West. The invective (of which only a
few fragments remain) is of the most violent kind. Nevertheless Jerome
translated it along with this letter, the date of which is 405 <span
class="c17"><span id="v.CXIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> The latter part
of the letter has perished.

<span id="v.CXIII-p3"></span>To the well-beloved and most loving brother
Jerome, Theophilus sends greeting in the Lord.

<span id="v.CXIII-p4"></span>1. At the outset the verdict which is in
accordance with the truth satisfies but few. But the Lord speaking by
the prophet says: “my judgment goeth forth as the light:” <span
id="fr_3051"></span>[3052](#fn_3051.md) and they who are surrounded with a
horror of darkness and do not with clear comprehension perceive the
nature of things, are covered with eternal shame and know by the issues
of their acts that their efforts have been in vain. Wherefore we also
have always desired for John who has for a time ruled the church of
Constantinople grace that he might please God, and we have been slow to
attribute to him the rash acts which have caused his downfall. But, not
to speak of his other misdeeds, he has taken the Origenists into his
confidence, has advanced many of them to the priesthood, and by
committing this crime has saddened with no slight grief that man of God,
Epiphanius of blessed memory, who has shone throughout all the world a
bright star among bishops. And therefore he has rightly come to hear the
words of doom: “Babylon is fallen, is fallen.” <span
id="fr_3052"></span>[3053](#fn_3052.md)

<span id="v.CXIII-p7"></span>2. Knowing then that the Saviour has said:
“judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous
judgment.” <span id="fr_3053"></span>[3054](#fn_3053.md) …
