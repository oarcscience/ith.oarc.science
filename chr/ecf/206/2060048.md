id="v.XXXVII-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXVII. To Marcella.</span>

<span id="v.XXXVII-p2"></span>Marcella had asked Jerome to lend her a
copy of a commentary by Rhetitius, bishop of Augustodunum (Autun), on
the Song of Songs. He now refuses to do so on the ground that the work
abounds with errors, of which the two following are samples: (1)
Rhetitius identifies Tharshish with Tarsus, and (2) he supposes that
Uphaz (in the phrase “gold of Uphaz”) is the same as Cephas. Written at
Rome <span class="c17"><span id="v.XXXVII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 384.
