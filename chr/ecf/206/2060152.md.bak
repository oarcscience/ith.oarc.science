<span id="v.CXLI-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.CXLI-p1.1"></span>Letter CXLI. To Augustine</span>

<span id="v.CXLI-p2"></span>A short note in which Jerome praises
Augustine for the determined stand which he has made against heresy and
speaks of him as “the restorer of the ancient faith.” The allusion seems
to be to his action in the Pelagian controversy. If so, the date is
probably 418 <span class="c17"><span id="v.CXLI-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>
This letter is among those of Augustine, number 195.
