<span id="vii.iii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span

<span id="vii.iii.ix-p2"></span>*Dedicated to Sophronius about the year
392. Jerome had, while at Rome, made a translation of the Psalms from
the LXX., which he had afterwards corrected by collation with the Hebrew
text (see the Preface addressed to Paula and Eustochium, infra). His
friend Sophronius, in quoting the Psalms to the Jews, was constantly met
with the reply, “It does not so stand in the Hebrew.” He, therefore,
urged Jerome to translate them direct from the original. Jerome, in
presenting the translation to his friend, records the intention which he
had expressed of translating the new Latin version into Greek. This we
know was done by Sophronius, not only for the Psalms, but also for the
rest of the Vulgate, and was valued by the Greeks (Apol. ii. 24, vol.
iii. of this series, p. 515).*
