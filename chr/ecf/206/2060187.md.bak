id="vii.ii.vii-p1.1"></span>Prefaces to the Vulgate Version of the New
Testament.</span>

<span id="vii.ii.vii-p2"></span>This version was made at Rome between
the years 382 and 385. The only Preface remaining is that to the
translation of the Gospels, but Jerome speaks of, and quotes from, his
version of the other parts also. The work was undertaken at the request
and under the sanction of Pope Damasus, who had consulted Jerome in
<span class="c17"><span id="vii.ii.vii-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 383 on
certain points of Scriptural criticism, and apparently in the same year
urged him to revise the current Latin version by help of the Greek
original. It is to be observed that Jerome’s aim was “to revise the old
Latin, and not to make a new version. When Augustin expressed to him his
gratitude for ‘his *translation* of the Gospels,’ he tacitly corrected
him by substituting for this phrase ‘the *correction* of the New
Testament.’ Yet, although he proposed to himself this limited object,
the various forms of corruption which had been introduced were, as he
describes, so numerous that the difference of the old and revised
(Hieronymian) text is throughout clear and striking.” See article by
Westcott in “Dictionary of Bible,” on the Vulgate, and Fremantle’s
article on Jerome in “Dictionary of Christian Biography.”
