<span id="v.LX-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.LX-p1.1"></span>Letter LX. To Heliodorus.</span>

<span id="v.LX-p2"></span>One of Jerome’s finest letters, written to
console his old friend, Heliodorus, now Bp. of Altinum, for the loss of
his nephew Nepotian who had died of fever a short time previously.
Jerome tries to soothe his friend’s grief (1) by contrasting pagan
despair or resignation with Christian hope, (2) by an eulogy of the
departed both as man and presbyter, and (3) by a review of the evils
which then beset the Empire and from which, as he contended, Nepotian
had been removed. The letter is marked throughout with deep and sincere
feeling. Its date is 396 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.LX-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.LX-p3"></span>1. Small wits cannot grapple large themes but
venturing beyond their strength fail in the very attempt; and, the
greater a subject is, the more completely is he overwhelmed who cannot
find words to unfold its grandeur. Nepotian who was mine and yours and
ours—or rather who was Christ’s and because Christ’s all the more
ours—has forsaken us his elders so that we are smitten with pangs of
regret and overcome with a grief which is past bearing. We supposed him
our heir, yet now his corpse is all that is ours. For whom shall my
intellect now labour? Whom shall my poor <span id="page_124">p.
124</span> <span id="v.LX-Page_124"></span>letters desire to please?
Where is he, the impeller of my work, whose voice was sweeter than a
swan’s last song? My mind is dazed, my hand trembles, a mist covers my
eyes, stammering seizes my tongue. Whatever my words, they seem as good
as unspoken seeing that he no longer hears them. My very pen seems to
feel his loss, my very wax tablet looks dull and sad; the one is covered
with rust, the other with mould. As often as I try to express myself in
words and to scatter the flowers of this encomium upon his tomb, my eyes
fill with tears, my grief returns, and I can think of nothing but his
death. It was a custom in former days for children over the dead bodies
of their parents publicly to proclaim their praises and (as when
pathetic songs are sung) to draw tears from the eyes and sighs from the
breasts of those who heard them. But in our case, behold, the order of
things is changed: to deal us this blow nature has forfeited her rights.
For the respect which the young man should have paid to his elders, we
his elders are paying to him.

<span id="v.LX-p4"></span>2. What shall I do then? Shall I join my tears
to yours? The apostle forbids me for he speaks of dead Christians as
“them which are asleep.” <span id="fr_1804"></span>[1805](#fn_1804.md) So
too in the gospel the Lord says, “the damsel is not dead but
sleepeth,” <span id="fr_1805"></span>[1806](#fn_1805.md) and Lazarus when
he is raised from the dead is said to have been asleep. <span
id="fr_1806"></span>[1807](#fn_1806.md) No, I will be glad and rejoice that
“speedily he was taken away lest that wickedness should alter his
understanding” for “his soul pleased the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1807"></span>[1808](#fn_1807.md) But though I am loth to give way
and combat my feelings, tears flow down my cheeks, and in spite of the
teachings of virtue and the hope of the resurrection a passion of regret
crushes my too yielding mind. O death that dividest brothers knit
together in love, how cruel, how ruthless thou art so to sunder them!
“The Lord hath fetched a burning wind that cometh up from the
wilderness: which hath dried thy veins and hath made thy well spring
desolate.” <span id="fr_1808"></span>[1809](#fn_1808.md) Thou didst swallow
up our Jonah, but even in thy belly He still lived. Thou didst carry Him
as one dead, that the world’s storm might be stilled and our Nineveh
saved by His preaching. He, yes He, conquered thee, He slew thee, that
fugitive prophet who left His home, gave up His inheritance and
surrendered his dear life into the hands of those who sought it. He it
was who of old threatened thee in Hosea: “O death, I will be thy
plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction.” <span
id="fr_1809"></span>[1810](#fn_1809.md) By His death thou art dead; by His
death we live. Thou hast swallowed up and thou art swallowed up. Whilst
thou art smitten with a longing for the body assumed by Him, and whilst
thy greedy jaws fancy it a prey, thy inward parts are wounded with
hooked fangs.

<span id="v.LX-p11"></span>3. To Thee, O Saviour Christ, do we Thy
creatures offer thanks that, when Thou wast slain, Thou didst slay our
mighty adversary. Before Thy coming was there any being more miserable
than man who cowering at the dread prospect of eternal death did but
receive life that he might perish! For “death reigned from Adam to Moses
even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s
transgression.” <span id="fr_1810"></span>[1811](#fn_1810.md) If Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob be in hell, who can be in the kingdom of heaven? If Thy
friends—even those who had not sinned themselves—were yet for the sins
of another liable to the punishment of offending Adam, what must we
think of those who have said in their hearts “There is no God;” who “are
corrupt and abominable” <span id="fr_1811"></span>[1812](#fn_1811.md) in
their self-will, and of whom it is said “they are gone out of the way,
they are become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no not
one”? <span id="fr_1812"></span>[1813](#fn_1812.md) Even if Lazarus is seen
in Abraham’s bosom and in a place of refreshment, still the lower
regions cannot be compared with the kingdom of heaven. Before Christ’s
coming Abraham is in the lower regions: after Christ’s coming the robber
is in paradise. And therefore at His rising again “many bodies of the
saints which slept arose, and were seen in the heavenly
Jerusalem.” <span id="fr_1813"></span>[1814](#fn_1813.md) Then was
fulfilled the saying: “Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the
dead, and Christ shall give thee light.” <span
id="fr_1814"></span>[1815](#fn_1814.md) John the Baptist cries in the
desert: “repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” <span
id="fr_1815"></span>[1816](#fn_1815.md) For “from the days of John the
Baptist the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it
by force.” <span id="fr_1816"></span>[1817](#fn_1816.md) The flaming sword
that keeps the way of paradise and the cherubim that are stationed at
its doors <span id="fr_1817"></span>[1818](#fn_1817.md) are alike quenched
and unloosed by the blood of Christ. <span
id="fr_1818"></span>[1819](#fn_1818.md) It is not surprising that this
should be promised us in the resurrection: for as many of us as living
in the flesh do not live after the flesh, <span
id="fr_1819"></span>[1820](#fn_1819.md) have our citizenship in
heaven, <span id="fr_1820"></span>[1821](#fn_1820.md) and while we are
still here on earth we are told that “the kingdom of heaven is within
us.” <span id="fr_1821"></span>[1822](#fn_1821.md)

<span id="v.LX-p24"></span>4. Moreover before the resurrection of Christ
God was “known in Judah” only and “His name was great in Israel”
alone. <span id="fr_1822"></span>[1823](#fn_1822.md) And they who knew Him
were despite their knowledge dragged down to hell. Where in those days
were the inhabitants of the globe from India to Britain, from the frozen
zone of the North to the burning heat of the Atlantic ocean? <span
id="page_125">p. 125</span> <span id="v.LX-Page_125"></span>Where were
the countless peoples of the world? Where the great multitudes?

<span id="v.LX-p26"></span>Unlike in tongue, unlike in dress and
arms? <span id="fr_1823"></span>[1824](#fn_1823.md)

<span id="v.LX-p28"></span>They were crushed like fishes and locusts,
like flies and gnats. For apart from knowledge of his Creator every man
is but a brute. But now the voices and writings of all nations proclaim
the passion and the resurrection of Christ. I say nothing of the Jews,
the Greeks, and the Romans, peoples which the Lord has dedicated to His
faith by the title written on His cross. <span
id="fr_1824"></span>[1825](#fn_1824.md) The immortality of the soul and its
continuance after the dissolution of the body—truths of which Pythagoras
dreamed, which Democritus refused to believe, and which Socrates
discussed in prison to console himself for the sentence passed upon
him—are now the familiar themes of Indian and of Persian, of Goth and of
Egyptian. The fierce Bessians <span id="fr_1825"></span>[1826](#fn_1825.md)
and the throng of skinclad savages who used to offer human sacrifices in
honour of the dead have broken out of their harsh discord into the sweet
music of the cross and Christ is the one cry of the whole world.

<span id="v.LX-p31"></span>5. What can we do, my soul? Whither must we
turn? What must we take up first? What must we pass over? Have you
forgotten the precepts of the rhetoricians? Are you so preoccupied with
grief, so overcome with tears, so hindered with sobs, that you forget
all logical sequence? Where are the studies you have pursued from your
childhood? Where is that saying of Anaxagoras and Telamon (which you
have always commended) “I knew myself to have begotten a mortal”? <span
id="fr_1826"></span>[1827](#fn_1826.md) I have read the books of Crantor
which he wrote to soothe his grief and which Cicero has imitated. <span
id="fr_1827"></span>[1828](#fn_1827.md) I have read the consolatory
writings of Plato, Diogenes, Clitomachus, Carneades, Posidonius, who at
different times strove by book or letter to lessen the grief of various
persons. Consequently, were my own wit to dry up, it could be watered
anew from the fountains which these have opened. They set before us
examples without number; and particularly those of Pericles and of
Socrates’s pupil Xenophon. The former of these after the loss of his two
sons put on a garland and delivered a harangue; <span
id="fr_1828"></span>[1829](#fn_1828.md) while the latter, on hearing when
he was offering sacrifice that his son had been slain in war, is said to
have laid down his garland; and then, on learning that he had fallen
fighting bravely, is said to have put it on his head again. What shall I
say of those Roman generals whose heroic virtues glitter like stars on
the pages of Latin history? Pulvillus was dedicating the capitol <span
id="fr_1829"></span>[1830](#fn_1829.md) when receiving the news of his
son’s sudden death, he gave orders that the funeral should take place
without him. Lucius Paullus <span id="fr_1830"></span>[1831](#fn_1830.md)
entered the city in triumph in the week which intervened between the
funerals of his two sons. I pass over the Maximi, the Catos, the Galli,
the Pisos, the Bruti, the Scævolas, the Metelli, the Scauri, the Marii,
the Crassi, the Marcelli, the Aufidii, men who shewed equal fortitude in
sorrow and war, and whose bereavements Tully has set forth in his book
*Of consolation*. I pass them over lest I should seem to have chosen the
words and woes of others in preference to my own. Yet even these
instances may suffice to ensure us mortification if our faith fails to
surpass the achievements of unbelief.

<span id="v.LX-p37"></span>6. Let me come then to my proper subject. I
will not beat my breast with Jacob and with David for sons dying in the
Law, but I will receive them rising again with Christ in the Gospel. The
Jew’s mourning is the Christian’s joy. “Weeping may endure for a night
but joy cometh in the morning.” <span
id="fr_1831"></span>[1832](#fn_1831.md) “The night is far spent, the day is
at hand.” <span id="fr_1832"></span>[1833](#fn_1832.md) Accordingly when
Moses dies, mourning is made for him, <span
id="fr_1833"></span>[1834](#fn_1833.md) but when Joshua is buried, it is
without tears or funeral pomp. <span
id="fr_1834"></span>[1835](#fn_1834.md) All that can be drawn from
scripture on the subject of lamentation I have briefly set forth in the
letter of consolation which I addressed to Paula at Rome. <span
id="fr_1835"></span>[1836](#fn_1835.md) Now I must take another path to
arrive at the same goal. Otherwise I shall seem to be walking anew in a
track once beaten but now long disused.

<span id="v.LX-p43"></span>7. We know indeed that our Nepotian is with
Christ and that he has joined the choirs of the saints. What here with
us he groped after on earth afar off and sought for to the best of his
judgment, there he sees nigh at hand, so that he can say: “as we have
heard so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of
our God.” <span id="fr_1836"></span>[1837](#fn_1836.md) Still we cannot
bear the feeling of his absence, and grieve, if not for him, for
ourselves. The greater the happiness which he enjoys, the deeper the
sorrow in which the loss of a blessing so great plunges us. The sisters
of Lazarus could not help weeping for him, although they knew that he
would rise again. And the Saviour himself—to shew that he possessed true
human feeling—mourned for him whom He was about to raise. <span
id="fr_1837"></span>[1838](#fn_1837.md) His apostle also, though he says:
“I desire to depart and to be with Christ,” <span
id="fr_1838"></span>[1839](#fn_1838.md) and elsewhere “to <span
id="page_126">p. 126</span> <span id="v.LX-Page_126"></span>me to live
is Christ and to die is gain,” <span
id="fr_1839"></span>[1840](#fn_1839.md) thanks God that Epaphras <span
id="fr_1840"></span>[1841](#fn_1840.md) (who had been “sick nigh unto
death”) has been given back to him that he might not have sorrow upon
sorrow. <span id="fr_1841"></span>[1842](#fn_1841.md) Words prompted not by
the fear that springs of unbelief but by the passionate regret that
comes of true affection. How much more deeply must you who were to
Nepotian both uncle and bishop, (that is, a father both in the flesh and
in the spirit), deplore the loss of one so dear, as though your heart
were torn from you. Set a limit, I pray you, to your sorrow and remember
the saying “in nothing overmuch.” <span
id="fr_1842"></span>[1843](#fn_1842.md) Bind up for a little while your
wound and listen to the praises of one in whose virtue you have always
delighted. Do not grieve that you have lost such a paragon: rejoice
rather that he has once been yours. As on a small tablet men depict the
configuration of the earth, so in this little scroll of mine you may see
his virtues if not fully depicted at least sketched in outline. I beg
that you will take the will for the performance.

<span id="v.LX-p51"></span>8. The advice of the rhetoricians in such
cases is that you should first search out the remote ancestors of the
person to be eulogized and recount their exploits, and then come
gradually to your hero; so as to make him more illustrious by the
virtues of his forefathers, and to show either that he is a worthy
successor of good men, or that he has conferred lustre upon a lineage in
itself obscure. But as my duty is to sing the praises of the soul, I
will not dwell upon those fleshly advantages which Nepotian for his part
always despised. Nor will I boast of his family, that is of the good
points belonging not to him but to others; for even those holy men
Abraham and Isaac had for sons the sinners Ishmael and Esau. And on the
other hand Jephthah who is reckoned by the apostle in the roll of the
righteous <span id="fr_1843"></span>[1844](#fn_1843.md) is the son of a
harlot. <span id="fr_1844"></span>[1845](#fn_1844.md) It is said “the soul
that sinneth, it shall die.” <span id="fr_1845"></span>[1846](#fn_1845.md)
The soul therefore that has not sinned shall live. Neither the virtues
nor the vices of parents are imputed to their children. God takes
account of us only from the time when we are born anew in Christ. Paul,
the persecutor of the church, who is in the morning the ravening wolf of
Benjamin, <span id="fr_1846"></span>[1847](#fn_1846.md) in the evening
“gave food,” <span id="fr_1847"></span>[1848](#fn_1847.md) that is yields
himself up to the sheep Ananias. <span
id="fr_1848"></span>[1849](#fn_1848.md) Let us likewise reckon our Nepotian
a crying babe and an untutored child who has been born to us in a moment
fresh from the waters of Jordan.

<span id="v.LX-p58"></span>9. Another would perhaps describe how for his
salvation you left the east and the desert and how you soothed me your
dearest comrade by holding out hopes of a return: and all this that you
might save, if possible, both your sister, then a widow with one little
child, or, should she reject your counsels, at any rate your sweet
little nephew. It was of him that I once used the prophetic words:
“though your little nephew cling to your neck.” <span
id="fr_1849"></span>[1850](#fn_1849.md) Another, I say, would relate how
while Nepotian was still in the service of the court, beneath his
uniform and his brilliantly white linen, <span
id="fr_1850"></span>[1851](#fn_1850.md) his skin was chafed with sackcloth;
how, while standing before the powers of this world, his lips were
discoloured with fasting; how still in the uniform of one master he
served another; and how he wore the sword-belt only that he might
succour widows and wards, the afflicted and the unhappy. For my part I
dislike men to delay the complete dedication of themselves to God. When
I read of the centurion Cornelius <span
id="fr_1851"></span>[1852](#fn_1851.md) that he was a just man I
immediately hear of his baptism.

<span id="v.LX-p62"></span>10. Still we may approve these things as the
swathing bands of an infant faith. He who has been a loyal soldier under
a strange banner is sure to deserve the laurel when he comes to serve
his own king. When Nepotian laid aside his baldrick and changed his
dress, he bestowed upon the poor all the pay that he had received. For
he had read the words: “if thou wilt be perfect, sell that thou hast,
and give to the poor and follow me,” <span
id="fr_1852"></span>[1853](#fn_1852.md) and again: “ye cannot serve two
masters, God and Mammon.” <span id="fr_1853"></span>[1854](#fn_1853.md) He
kept nothing for himself but a common tunic and cloak to cover him and
to keep out the cold. Made in the fashion of his province his attire was
not remarkable either for elegance or for squalor. He burned daily to
make his way to the monasteries of Egypt, or to visit the communities of
Mesopotamia, or at least to live a lonely life in the Dalmatian
islands, <span id="fr_1854"></span>[1855](#fn_1854.md) separated from the
mainland only by the strait of Altinum. But he had not the heart to
forsake his episcopal uncle in whom he beheld a pattern of many virtues
and from whom he could take lessons without going abroad. In one and the
same person he both found a monk to imitate and a bishop to revere. What
so often happens did not happen here. Constant intimacy did not produce
familiarity, nor did familiarity breed contempt. He revered him as a
father and every day admired him for some new virtue. To be brief, he
became a clergyman, and after passing through the usual stages was
ordained a presbyter. Good <span id="page_127">p. 127</span> <span
id="v.LX-Page_127"></span>Jesus! how he sighed and groaned! how he
fasted and fled the eyes of all! For the first and only time he was
angry with his uncle, complaining that the burthen laid upon him was too
heavy for him and that his youth unfitted him for the priesthood. But
the more he struggled against it, the more he drew to himself the hearts
of all: his refusal did but prove him worthy of an office which he was
reluctant to assume, and all the more worthy because he declared himself
unworthy. We too in our day have our Timothy; we too have seen that
wisdom which is as good as gray hairs; <span
id="fr_1855"></span>[1856](#fn_1855.md) our Moses has chosen an elder whom
he has known to be an elder indeed. <span
id="fr_1856"></span>[1857](#fn_1856.md) Nepotian regarded the clerical
state less as an honour than a burthen. He made it his first care to
silence envy by humility, and his next to give no cause for scandal that
such as assailed his youth might marvel at his continence. He helped the
poor, visited the sick, stirred men up to hospitality, soothed them with
soft words, rejoiced with those who rejoiced and wept with those who
wept. <span id="fr_1857"></span>[1858](#fn_1857.md) He was a staff to the
blind, food to the hungry, hope to the dejected, consolation to the
bereaved. Each single virtue was as conspicuous in him as if he
possessed no other. Among his fellow-presbyters while ever foremost in
work, he was ever satisfied with the lowest place. Any good that he did
he ascribed to his uncle: but if the result did not correspond to his
expectations, he would say that his uncle knew nothing of it, that it
was his own mistake. In public he recognized him as a bishop; at home he
looked upon him as a father. The seriousness of his disposition was
mitigated by a cheerful expression. But while his laughter was joyous it
was never loud. Christ’s virgins and widows he honoured as mothers and
exhorted as sisters “with all purity.” <span
id="fr_1858"></span>[1859](#fn_1858.md) When he returned home he used to
leave the clergyman outside and to give himself over to the hard rule of
a monk. Frequent in supplication and watchful in prayer he would offer
his tears not to man but to God. His fasts he regulated—as a driver does
the pace of his horses—according to the weariness or vigour of his body.
When at his uncle’s table he would just taste what was set before him,
so as to avoid superstition and yet to preserve self-control. In
conversing at entertainments his habit was to propose some topic from
scripture, to listen modestly, to answer diffidently, to support the
right, to refute the wrong, but both without bitterness; to instruct his
opponent rather than to vanquish him. Such was the ingenuous modesty
which adorned his youth that he would frankly confess from what sources
his several arguments came; and in this way, while disclaiming a
reputation for learning, he came to be held most learned. This he would
say is the opinion of Tertullian, that of Cyprian; this of Lactantius,
that of Hilary; to this effect speaks Minucius Felix, thus Victorinus,
after this manner Arnobius. Myself too he would sometimes quote, for he
loved me because of my intimacy with his uncle. Indeed by constant
reading and long-continued meditation he had made his breast a library
of Christ.

<span id="v.LX-p70"></span>11. How often in letters from beyond the sea
he urged me to write something to him! How often he reminded me of the
man in the gospel who sought help by night <span
id="fr_1859"></span>[1860](#fn_1859.md) and of the widow who importuned the
cruel judge! <span id="fr_1860"></span>[1861](#fn_1860.md) And when I
silently ignored his request and made my petitioner blush by blushing to
reply, he put forward his uncle to enforce his suit, knowing that as the
boon was for another he would more readily ask it, and that as I held
his episcopal office in respect he would more easily obtain it.
Accordingly I did what he wished and in a brief essay <span
id="fr_1861"></span>[1862](#fn_1861.md) dedicated our mutual friendship to
everlasting remembrance. On receiving this Nepotian boasted that he was
richer than Crœsus and wealthier than Darius. He held it in his hands,
devoured it with his eyes, kept it in his bosom, repeated it with his
lips. And often when he unrolled it upon his couch, he fell asleep with
the cherished page upon his breast. When a stranger came or a friend, he
rejoiced to let them know my witness to him. The deficiencies of my
little book he made good by careful punctuation and varied emphasis, so
that when it was read aloud it was always he not I who seemed to please
or to displease. Whence came such zeal, if not from the love of God?
Whence came such untiring study of Christ’s law, if not from a yearning
for Him who gave it? Let others add coin to coin till their purses are
chock-full; let others demean themselves to sponge on married ladies;
let them be richer as monks than they were as men of the world; let them
possess wealth in the service of a poor Christ such as they never had in
the service of a rich devil; let the church lose breath at the opulence
of men who in the world were beggars. Our Nepotian spurns gold and begs
only for written books. But while he despises himself in the flesh and
walks abroad more splendid than ever in his poverty, he still seeks out
everything that may adorn the church.

<span id="v.LX-p74"></span>12. In comparison with what has gone before
what I am now about to say may appear trivial, <span id="page_128">p.
128</span> <span id="v.LX-Page_128"></span>but even in trifles the same
spirit makes itself manifest. For as we admire the Creator not only as
the framer of heaven and earth, of sun and ocean, of elephants, camels,
horses, oxen, pards, bears, and lions; but also as the maker of the most
tiny creatures, ants, gnats, flies, worms, and the like, whose shapes we
know better than their names, and as in all alike we revere the same
creative skill; so the mind that is given to Christ shews the same
earnestness in things of small as of great importance, knowing that it
must render an account of every idle word. <span
id="fr_1862"></span>[1863](#fn_1862.md) Nepotian took pains to keep the
altar bright, the church walls free from soot and the pavement duly
swept. He saw that the doorkeeper was constantly at his post, that the
doorhangings were in their places, the sanctuary clean and the vessels
shining. The careful reverence that he shewed to every rite led him to
neglect no duty small or great. Whenever you looked for him in church
you found him there.

<span id="v.LX-p76"></span>In Quintus Fabius <span
id="fr_1863"></span>[1864](#fn_1863.md) antiquity admired a nobleman and
the author of a history of Rome, yet his paintings gained him more
renown than his writings. Our own Bezaleel <span
id="fr_1864"></span>[1865](#fn_1864.md) also and Hiram, the son of a Tyrian
woman, <span id="fr_1865"></span>[1866](#fn_1865.md) are spoken of in
scripture as filled with wisdom and the spirit of God because they
framed, the one the furniture of the tabernacle, the other that of the
temple. For, as it is with fertile tillage-fields and rich plough-lands
which at times go out into redundant growths of stalk or ear, so is it
with distinguished talents and a mind filled with virtue. They are sure
to overflow into elegant and varied accomplishments. Accordingly among
the Greeks we hear of a philosopher <span
id="fr_1866"></span>[1867](#fn_1866.md) who used to boast that everything
he wore down to his cloak and ring was made by himself. We may pass the
same eulogy on our friend, for he adorned both the basilicas of the
church and the halls <span id="fr_1867"></span>[1868](#fn_1867.md) of the
martyrs with sketches of flowers, foliage, and vine-tendrils, so that
everything attractive in the church, whether made so by its position or
by its appearance, bore witness to the labour and zeal of the presbyter
set over it.

<span id="v.LX-p82"></span>13. Go on blessed in thy goodness! What kind
of ending should we expect after such a beginning! Ah! hapless plight of
mortal men and vanity of all life that is not lived in Christ! Why, O my
words, do you shrink back? Why do you shift and turn? I fear to come to
the end, as if I could put off his death or make his life longer. “All
flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of
grass.” <span id="fr_1868"></span>[1869](#fn_1868.md) Where now are that
handsome face and dignified figure with which as with a fair garment his
beautiful soul was clothed? The lily began to wither, alas! when the
south wind blew, and the purple violet slowly faded into paleness. Yet
while he burned with fever and while the fire of sickness was drying up
the fountains of his veins, gasping and weary he still tried to comfort
his sorrowing uncle. His countenance shone with gladness, and while all
around him wept he and he only smiled. He flung aside his cloak, put out
his hand, saw what others failed to see, and even tried to rise that he
might welcome new comers. You would have thought that he was starting on
a journey instead of dying and that in place of leaving all his friends
behind him he was merely passing from some to others. <span
id="fr_1869"></span>[1870](#fn_1869.md) Tears roll down my cheeks and,
however much I steel my mind, I cannot disguise the grief that I feel.
Who could suppose that at such an hour he would remember his intimacy
with me, and that while he struggled for life he would recall the
sweetness of study? Yet grasping his uncle’s hand he said to him: “Send
this tunic that I wore in the service of Christ to my dear friend, my
father in age, but my brother in office, and transfer the affection
hitherto claimed by your nephew to one who is as dear to you as he is to
me.” With these words he passed away holding his uncle’s hand and with
my name upon his lips.

<span id="v.LX-p85"></span>14. I know how unwilling you were to prove
the affection of your people at such a cost, and that you would have
preferred to win your countrymen’s love while retaining your happiness.
Such expressions of feeling, pleasant as they are when all goes well,
are doubly welcome in time of sorrow. All Altinum, all Italy mourned
Nepotian. The earth received his body; his soul was given back to
Christ. You lost a nephew, the church a priest. He who should have
followed you went before you. To the office which you held, he in the
judgment of all deserved to succeed. And so one family has had the
honour of producing two bishops, the first to be congratulated because
he has held the office, the second to be lamented because he has been
taken away too soon to hold it. Plato thinks that a wise man’s whole
life ought to be a meditation of death; <span
id="fr_1870"></span>[1871](#fn_1870.md) and philosophers praise the
sentiment and extol it to the skies. But much more full of power are the
words of the apostle: “I die daily through your glory.” <span
id="fr_1871"></span>[1872](#fn_1871.md) For to have an ideal is one thing,
to realize it another. It is one thing to live so as to die, another to
die <span id="page_129">p. 129</span> <span id="v.LX-Page_129"></span>so
as to live. The sage and Christian must both of them die: but the one
always dies out of his glory, the other into it. Therefore we also
should consider beforehand the end which must one day overtake us and
which, whether we wish it or not, cannot be very far distant. For though
we should live nine hundred years or more, as men did before the deluge,
and though the days of Methuselah <span
id="fr_1872"></span>[1873](#fn_1872.md) should be granted us, yet that long
space of time, when once it should have passed away and come to an end,
would be as nothing. For to the man who has lived ten years and to him
who has lived a thousand, when once the end of life comes and death’s
inexorable doom, all the past whether long or short is just the same;
except that the older a man is, the heavier is the load of sin that he
has to take with him.

<span id="v.LX-p89"></span>First hapless mortals lose from out their
life

<span id="v.LX-p90"></span>The fairest days: disease and age come next;

<span id="v.LX-p91"></span>And lastly cruel death doth claim his
prey. <span id="fr_1873"></span>[1874](#fn_1873.md)

<span id="v.LX-p93"></span>The poet Nævius too says that

<span id="v.LX-p94"></span>Mortals must many woes perforce endure.

<span id="v.LX-p95"></span>Accordingly antiquity has feigned that Niobe
because of her much weeping was turned to stone and that other women
were metamorphosed into beasts. Hesiod also bewails men’s birthdays and
rejoices in their deaths, and Ennius wisely says:

<span id="v.LX-p96"></span>The mob has one advantage o’er its king:

<span id="v.LX-p97"></span>For it may weep while tears for him are
shame.

<span id="v.LX-p98"></span>If a king may not weep, neither may a bishop;
indeed a bishop has still less license than a king. For the king rules
over unwilling subjects, the bishop over willing ones. The king compels
submission by terror; the bishop exercises lordship by becoming a
servant. The king guards men’s bodies till they die; the bishop saves
their souls for life eternal. The eyes of all are turned upon you. Your
house is set on a watchtower; your life fixes for others the limits of
their self-control. Whatever you do, all think that they may do the
same. Do not so commit yourself that those who seek ground for cavil may
be thought to have rightly assailed you, or that those who are eager to
imitate you may be forced to do wrong. Overcome as much as you can—nay
even more than you can—the sensitiveness of your mind and check the
copious flow of your tears. Else your deep affection for your nephew may
be construed by unbelievers as indicating despair of God. You must
regretim not as dead but as absent. You must seem to be looking for him
rather than have lost him.

<span id="v.LX-p99"></span>15. But why do I try to heal a sorrow which
has already, I suppose, been assuaged by time and reason? Why do I not
rather unfold to you—they are not far to seek—the miseries of our rulers
and the calamities of our time? He who has lost the light of life is not
so much to be pitied as he is to be congratulated who has escaped from
such great evils. Constantius, <span
id="fr_1874"></span>[1875](#fn_1874.md) the patron of the Arian heresy, was
hurrying to do battle with his enemy <span
id="fr_1875"></span>[1876](#fn_1875.md) when he died at the village of
Mopsus and to his great vexation left the empire to his foe.
Julian <span id="fr_1876"></span>[1877](#fn_1876.md) , the betrayer of his
own soul, the murderer of a Christian army, felt in Media the hand of
the Christ whom he had previously denied in Gaul. Desiring to annex new
territories to Rome, he did but lose annexations previously made.
Jovian <span id="fr_1877"></span>[1878](#fn_1877.md) had but just tasted
the sweets of sovereignty when a coal-fire suffocated him: a good
instance of the transitoriness of human power. Valentinian <span
id="fr_1878"></span>[1879](#fn_1878.md) died of a broken blood vessel, the
land of his birth laid waste, and his country unavenged. His brother
Valens <span id="fr_1879"></span>[1880](#fn_1879.md) defeated in Thrace by
the Goths, was buried where he died. Gratian, betrayed by his army and
refused admittance by the cities on his line of march, became the
laughing-stock of his foe; and your walls, Lyons, still bear the marks
of that bloody hand. <span id="fr_1880"></span>[1881](#fn_1880.md)
Valentinian was yet a youth—I may say, a mere boy—when, after flight and
exile and the recovery of his power by bloodshed, he was put to
death <span id="fr_1881"></span>[1882](#fn_1881.md) not far from the city
which had witnessed his brother’s end. And not only so but his lifeless
body was gibbeted to do him shame. What shall I say of Procopius, of
Maximus, of Eugenius, <span id="fr_1882"></span>[1883](#fn_1882.md) who
while they held sovereign sway were a terror to the nations, yet stood
one and all as prisoners in the presence of their conquerors,
and—cruellest wound of all to the great and powerful—felt the pang of an
ignominious slavery before they fell by the edge of the sword.

<span id="v.LX-p109"></span>16. Some one may say: such is the lot of
kings:

<span id="v.LX-p110"></span>The lightning ever smites the
mountain-tops. <span id="fr_1883"></span>[1884](#fn_1883.md)

<span id="v.LX-p112"></span>I will come therefore to persons of private
position, and in speaking of these I will not go farther back than the
last two years. In fact I will content myself—omitting all others—with
recounting the respective fates of three recent consulars. Abundantius
is a beggared exile at Pityus. <span
id="fr_1884"></span>[1885](#fn_1884.md) The head of Rufinus has <span
id="page_130">p. 130</span> <span id="v.LX-Page_130"></span>been carried
on a pike to Constantinople, and his severed hand has begged alms from
door to door to shame his insatiable greed. <span
id="fr_1885"></span>[1886](#fn_1885.md) Timasius, <span
id="fr_1886"></span>[1887](#fn_1886.md) hurled suddenly from a position of
the highest rank thinks it an escape that he is allowed to live in
obscurity at Assa. I am describing not the misfortunes of an unhappy few
but the thread upon which human fortunes as a whole depend. I shudder
when I think of the catastrophes of our time. For twenty years and more
the blood of Romans has been shed daily between Constantinople and the
Julian Alps. Scythia, Thrace, Macedonia, Dardania, Dacia, Thessaly,
Achaia, Epirus, Dalmatia, the Pannonias—each and all of these have been
sacked and pillaged and plundered by Goths and Sarmatians, Quades and
Alans, Huns and Vandals and Marchmen. How many of God’s matrons and
virgins, virtuous and noble ladies, have been made the sport of these
brutes! Bishops have been made captive, priests and those in minor
orders have been put to death. Churches have been overthrown, horses
have been stalled by the altars of Christ, the relics of martyrs have
been dug up.

<span id="v.LX-p116"></span>Mourning and fear abound on every side

<span id="v.LX-p117"></span>And death appears in countless shapes and
forms. <span id="fr_1887"></span>[1888](#fn_1887.md)

<span id="v.LX-p119"></span>The Roman world is falling: yet we hold up
our heads instead of bowing them. What courage, think you, have the
Corinthians now, or the Athenians or the Lacedæmonians or the Arcadians,
or any of the Greeks over whom the barbarians bear sway? I have
mentioned only a few cities, but these once the capitals of no mean
states. The East, it is true, seemed to be safe from all such evils: and
if men were panic-stricken here, it was only because of bad news from
other parts. But lo! in the year just gone by the wolves (no longer of
Arabia but of the whole North <span id="fr_1888"></span>[1889](#fn_1888.md)
) were let loose upon us from the remotest fastnesses of Caucasus and in
a short time overran these great provinces. What a number of monasteries
they captured! What many rivers they caused to run red with blood! They
laid siege to Antioch and invested other cities on the Halys, the
Cydnus, the Orontes, and the Euphrates. They carried off troops of
captives. Arabia, Phenicia, Palestine and Egypt, in their terror fancied
themselves already enslaved.

<span id="v.LX-p121"></span>Had I a hundred tongues, a hundred lips,

<span id="v.LX-p122"></span>A throat of iron and a chest of brass,

<span id="v.LX-p123"></span>I could not tell men’s countless
sufferings. <span id="fr_1889"></span>[1890](#fn_1889.md)

<span id="v.LX-p125"></span>And indeed it is not my purpose to write a
history: I only wish to shed a few tears over your sorrows and mine. For
the rest, to treat such themes as they deserve, Thucydides and Sallust
would be as good as dumb.

<span id="v.LX-p126"></span>17. Nepotian is happy who neither sees these
things nor hears them. We are unhappy, for either we suffer ourselves or
we see our brethren suffer. Yet we desire to live, and regard those
beyond the reach of these evils as miserable rather than blessed. We
have long felt that God is angry, yet we do not try to appease Him. It
is our sins which make the barbarians strong, it is our vices which
vanquish Rome’s soldiers: and, as if there were here too little material
for carnage, civil wars have made almost greater havoc among us than the
swords of foreign foes. Miserable must those Israelites have been
compared with whom Nebuchadnezzar was called God’s servant. <span
id="fr_1890"></span>[1891](#fn_1890.md) Unhappy too are we who are so
displeasing to God that He uses the fury of the barbarians to execute
His wrath against us. Still when Hezekiah repented, one hundred and
eighty-five thousand Assyrians were destroyed in one night by a single
angel. <span id="fr_1891"></span>[1892](#fn_1891.md) When Jehosaphat sang
the praises of the Lord, the Lord gave His worshipper the victory. <span
id="fr_1892"></span>[1893](#fn_1892.md) Again when Moses fought against
Amalek, it was not with the sword but with prayer that he
prevailed. <span id="fr_1893"></span>[1894](#fn_1893.md) Therefore, if we
wish to be lifted up, we must first prostrate ourselves. Alas! for our
shame and folly reaching even to unbelief! Rome’s army, once victor and
lord of the world, now trembles with terror at the sight of the foe and
accepts defeat from men who cannot walk afoot and fancy themselves dead
if once they are unhorsed. <span id="fr_1894"></span>[1895](#fn_1894.md) We
do not understand the prophet’s words: “One thousand shall flee at the
rebuke of one.” <span id="fr_1895"></span>[1896](#fn_1895.md) We do not cut
away the causes of the disease, as we must do to remove the disease
itself. Else we should soon see the enemies’ arrows give way to our
javelins, their caps to our helmets, their palfreys to our chargers.

<span id="v.LX-p133"></span>18. But I have gone beyond the office of a
consoler, and while forbidding you to weep for one dead man I have
myself mourned the dead of the whole world. Xerxes the mighty king who
rased mountains and filled up seas, looking from high ground upon the
untold host, the countless army before him, is said <span
id="fr_1896"></span>[1897](#fn_1896.md) to have wept at the thought that in
a hundred years not one of those whom he then saw would be alive. Oh! if
we could but get up into a watch-tower so high that from it we might
behold the whole earth spread out under our feet, then I would shew you
the <span id="page_131">p. 131</span> <span
id="v.LX-Page_131"></span>wreck of a world, nation warring against
nation and kingdom in collision with kingdom; some men tortured, others
put to the sword, others swallowed up by the waves, some dragged away
into slavery; here a wedding, there a funeral; men born here, men dying
there; some living in affluence, others begging their bread; and not the
army of Xerxes, great as that was, but all the inhabitants of the world
alive now but destined soon to pass away. Language is inadequate to a
theme so vast and all that I can say must fall short of the reality.

<span id="v.LX-p135"></span>19. Let us return then to ourselves and
coming down from the skies let us look for a few moments upon what more
nearly concerns us. Are you conscious, I would ask, of the stages of
your growth? Can you fix the time when you became a babe, a boy, a
youth, an adult, an old man? Every day we are changing, every day we are
dying, and yet we fancy ourselves eternal. The very moments that I spend
in dictation, in writing, in reading over what I write, and in
correcting it, are so much taken from my life. Every dot that my
secretary makes is so much gone from my allotted time. We write letters
and reply to those of others, our missives cross the sea, and, as the
vessel ploughs its furrow through wave after wave, the moments which we
have to live vanish one by one. Our only gain is that we are thus knit
together in the love of Christ. “Charity suffereth long and is kind;
charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up;
beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth
all things. Charity never faileth.” <span
id="fr_1897"></span>[1898](#fn_1897.md) It lives always in the heart, and
thus our Nepotian though absent is still present, and widely sundered
though we are has a hand to offer to each. Yes, in him we have a hostage
for mutual charity. Let us then be joined together in spirit, let us
bind ourselves each to each in affection and let us who have lost a son
shew the same fortitude with which the blessed pope Chromatius <span
id="fr_1898"></span>[1899](#fn_1898.md) bore the loss of a brother. Let
every page that we write echo his name, let all our letters ring with
it. If we can no longer clasp him to our hearts, let us hold him fast in
memory; and if we can no longer speak with him, let us never cease to
speak of him.
