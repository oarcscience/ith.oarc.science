<span id="v.LXXIX-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.LXXIX-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXIX. To Salvina.</span>

<span id="v.LXXIX-p2"></span>A letter of consolation addressed by Jerome
to Salvina (a lady of the imperial court) on the death of her husband
Nebridius. After excusing his temerity in addressing a complete stranger
Jerome eulogizes the virtues of Nebridius, particularly his chastity and
his bounty to the poor. He next warns Salvina (in no courtier-like
terms) of the dangers that will beset her as a widow and recommends her
to devote all her energies to the careful training of the son and
daughter who are now her principal charge. The tone of the letter is
somewhat arrogant and it can hardly be regarded as one of Jerome’s
happiest efforts. Salvina, however, consecrated her life to deeds of
piety, and became one of Chrysostom’s deaconesses. Its date is 400 <span
class="c17"><span id="v.LXXIX-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.LXXIX-p3"></span>1. My desire to do my duty may, I fear,
expose me to a charge of self-seeking; and although I do but follow the
example of Him who said: “learn of me for I am meek and lowly of
heart,” <span id="fr_2388"></span>[2389](#fn_2388.md) the course that I am
taking may be attributed to a desire for notoriety. Men may say that I
am not so much trying to console a widow in affliction as endeavouring
to creep into the imperial court; and that, while I make a pretext of
offering comfort, I am really seeking the friendship of the great.
Clearly this will not be the opinion of any one who knows the
commandment: “thou shalt not respect the person of the poor,” <span
id="fr_2389"></span>[2390](#fn_2389.md) a precept given lest under pretext
of shewing pity we should judge unjust judgment. For each individual is
to be judged not by his personal importance but by the merits of his
case. His wealth need not stand in the way of the rich man, if he makes
a good use of it; and poverty can be no recommendation to the poor if in
the midst of squalor and want he fails to keep clear of wrong doing.
Proofs of these things are not wanting either in scriptural times or our
own; for Abraham, in spite of his immense wealth, was “the friend of
God” <span id="fr_2390"></span>[2391](#fn_2390.md) and poor men are daily
arrested and punished for their crimes by law. She whom I now address is
both rich and poor so that she cannot say what she actually has. For it
is not of her purse that I am speaking but of the purity of her soul. I
do not know her face but I am well acquainted with her virtues; for
report speaks well of her and her youth makes her chastity all the more
commendable. By her grief for her young husband she has set an example
to all wives; and by her resignation she has proved that she believes
him not lost but gone before. The greatness of her bereavement has
brought out the reality of her religion. For while she forgets her lost
Nebridius, she knows that in Christ he is with her still.

<span id="v.LXXIX-p7"></span>But why do I write to one who is a stranger
to me? For three reasons. First, because (as a priest is bound to do) I
love all Christians as my children and find my glory in promoting their
welfare. Secondly because the father of Nebridius was bound to me by the
closest ties. <span id="fr_2391"></span>[2392](#fn_2391.md) Lastly—and this
is a stronger reason than the others—because I have failed to say no to
my son Avitus. <span id="fr_2392"></span>[2393](#fn_2392.md) With an
importunacy surpassing that of the widow towards the unjust judge <span
id="fr_2393"></span>[2394](#fn_2393.md) he wrote to me so frequently and
put before me so many instances in which I had previously dealt with a
similar theme, that he overcame my modest reluctance and made the
resolve to do not what would best become me but what would most nearly
meet his wishes.

<span id="v.LXXIX-p11"></span>2. As the mother of Nebridius was sister
to the empress <span id="fr_2394"></span>[2395](#fn_2394.md) and as he was
brought up in the bosom of his aunt, another might perhaps praise him
for having so much endeared himself to the unvanquished emperor.
Theodosius, indeed, procured him from Africa a wife of the highest
rank, <span id="fr_2395"></span>[2396](#fn_2395.md) who, as her native land
at this time was distracted by civil wars, became a kind of hostage for
its loyalty. I ought to say at the very outset that Nebridius seems to
have had a presentiment that he would die early. For amid the splendour
of the palace and in the high positions to which his rank and not his
years entitled him he lived always as one who believed that he must soon
go to meet Christ. Of Cornelius, the centurion of the Italian band, the
sacred narrative tells us that God so fully accepted him as to send to
him an angel; and that this angel told him that to his merit was due the
mystery whereby Peter from the narrow limits of the circumcision was
conveyed to the wide field of the uncircumcision. He was the first
Gentile baptized by the apostle, and in him the Gentiles were set apart
to salvation. Now of this man it is written: “there <span
id="page_164">p. 164</span> <span id="v.LXXIX-Page_164"></span>was a
certain man in Cæsarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called
the Italian band, a devout man and one that feared God with all his
house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God
alway.” <span id="fr_2396"></span>[2397](#fn_2396.md) All this that is said
of him I claim—with a change of name only—for my dear Nebridius. So
“devout” was this latter and so enamoured of chastity that at his
marriage he was still pure. So truly did he “fear God with all his
house” that forgetting his high position he spent all his time with
monks and clergymen. So profuse were the alms which he gave to the
people that his doors were continually beset with swarms of sick and
poor. And assuredly he “prayed to God alway” that what was for the best
might happen to him. Therefore “speedily was he taken away lest that
wickedness should alter his understanding…for his soul pleased the
Lord.” <span id="fr_2397"></span>[2398](#fn_2397.md) Thus I may truthfully
apply to him the apostle’s words: “Of a truth I perceive that God is no
respecter of persons: but in every nation he that feareth Him and
worketh righteousness, is accepted with Him.” <span
id="fr_2398"></span>[2399](#fn_2398.md) As a soldier Nebridius took no harm
from his cloak and sword-belt and troops of orderlies; for while he wore
the uniform of the emperor he was enlisted in the service of God. On the
other hand nothing is gained by men who while they affect coarse
mantles, sombre tunics, dirt, and poverty, belie by their deeds their
lofty pretensions. Of another centurion we find in the gospel this
testimony from our Lord:—“I have not found so great faith, no not in
Israel.” <span id="fr_2399"></span>[2400](#fn_2399.md) And, to go back to
earlier times, we read of Joseph who gave proof of his integrity both
when he was in want and when he was rich, and who inculcated freedom of
soul both as slave and as lord. He was made next to Pharaoh and invested
with the emblems of royalty; <span id="fr_2400"></span>[2401](#fn_2400.md)
yet so dear was he to God that, alone of all the patriarchs, he became
the father of two tribes. <span id="fr_2401"></span>[2402](#fn_2401.md)
Daniel and the three children were set over the affairs of Babylon and
were numbered among the princes of the state; yet although they wore the
dress of Nebuchadnezzar, in their hearts they served God. Mordecai also
and Esther amid purple and silk and jewels overcame pride with humility;
and although captives were so highly esteemed as to be able to impose
commands upon their conquerors.

<span id="v.LXXIX-p20"></span>3. These remarks are intended to shew that
the youth of whom I speak used his kinship to the royal family, his
abundant wealth, and the outward tokens of power, as helps to virtue.
For, as the preacher says, “wisdom is a defence and money is a
defence” <span id="fr_2402"></span>[2403](#fn_2402.md) also. We must not
hastily conclude that this statement conflicts with that of the Lord:
“verily I say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the
kingdom of heaven; and again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to
go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the
kingdom of heaven.” <span id="fr_2403"></span>[2404](#fn_2403.md) Were it
so, the salvation of Zacchæus the publican, described in scripture as a
man of great wealth, would contradict the Lord’s declaration. But that
what is impossible with men is possible with God <span
id="fr_2404"></span>[2405](#fn_2404.md) we are taught by the counsel of the
apostle who thus writes to Timothy:—“charge them that are rich in this
world that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in
the living God who giveth us richly all things to enjoy, that they do
good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute. willing to
communicate, laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against
the time to come that they may lay hold on the true life.” <span
id="fr_2405"></span>[2406](#fn_2405.md) We have learned how a camel can
pass through a needle’s eye, how an animal with a hump on its
back, <span id="fr_2406"></span>[2407](#fn_2406.md) when it has laid down
its packs, can take to itself the wings of a dove <span
id="fr_2407"></span>[2408](#fn_2407.md) and rest in the branches of the
tree which has grown from a grain of mustard seed. <span
id="fr_2408"></span>[2409](#fn_2408.md) In Isaiah we read of camels, the
dromedaries of Midian and Ephah and Sheba, which carry gold and incense
to the city of the Lord. <span id="fr_2409"></span>[2410](#fn_2409.md) On
like typical camels the Ishmaelitish merchantmen <span
id="fr_2410"></span>[2411](#fn_2410.md) bring down to the Egyptians perfume
and incense and balm (of the kind that grows in Gilead good for the
healing of wounds <span id="fr_2411"></span>[2412](#fn_2411) .md); and so
fortunate are they that in the purchase and sale of Joseph they have for
their merchandise the Saviour of the world. <span
id="fr_2412"></span>[2413](#fn_2412.md) And Æsop’s fable tells us of a
mouse which after eating its fill can no longer creep out as before it
crept in. <span id="fr_2413"></span>[2414](#fn_2413.md)

<span id="v.LXXIX-p33"></span>4. Daily did my dear Nebridius revolve the
words: “they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare” of the
devil “and into many lusts.” <span id="fr_2414"></span>[2415](#fn_2414.md)
All the money that the Emperor’s bounty gave him or that his badges of
office procured him he laid out for the benefit of the poor. For he knew
the commandment of the Lord: “If thou wilt be perfect go and sell that
thou hast, and give to the poor, and come and follow me.” <span
id="fr_2415"></span>[2416](#fn_2415.md) And because he could not literally
fulfil these directions, having a wife and little children and a large
household, he made to himself friends of the mammon of unrighteousness
that they might receive him into everlasting habitations. <span
id="fr_2416"></span>[2417](#fn_2416.md) He <span id="page_165">p.
165</span> <span id="v.LXXIX-Page_165"></span>did not once for all cast
away his brethren, as did the apostles who forsook father and nets and
ship, <span id="fr_2417"></span>[2418](#fn_2417.md) but by an equality he
ministered to the want of others out of his own abundance that
afterwards their wealth might be a supply for his own want. <span
id="fr_2418"></span>[2419](#fn_2418.md) The lady to whom this letter is
addressed knows that what I narrate is only known to me by hearsay, but
she is aware also that I am no Greek writer repaying with flattery some
benefit conferred upon me. Far be such an imputation from all
Christians. Having food and raiment we are therewith content. <span
id="fr_2419"></span>[2420](#fn_2419.md) Where there is cheap cabbage and
household bread, a sufficiency to eat and a sufficiency to drink, these
riches are superfluous and no place is left for flattery with its sordid
calculations. You may conclude therefore that, where there is no motive
to tell a falsehood, the testimony given is true.

<span id="v.LXXIX-p40"></span>5. It must not, however, be supposed that
I praise Nebridius only for his liberality in alms-giving, although we
are taught the great importance of this in the words: “water will quench
a flaming fire; and alms maketh an atonement for sins.” <span
id="fr_2420"></span>[2421](#fn_2420.md) I will pass on now to his other
virtues each one of which is to be found but in few men. Who ever
entered the furnace of the King of Babylon without being burned? <span
id="fr_2421"></span>[2422](#fn_2421.md) Was there ever a young man whose
garment his Egyptian mistress did not seize? <span
id="fr_2422"></span>[2423](#fn_2422.md) Was there ever a eunuch’s <span
id="fr_2423"></span>[2424](#fn_2423.md) wife contented with a childless
marriage bed? Is there any man who is not appalled by the struggle of
which the apostle says: “I see another law in my members warring against
the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin
which is in my members?” <span id="fr_2424"></span>[2425](#fn_2424.md) But
wonderful to say Nebridius, though bred up in a palace as a companion
and fellow pupil of the Augusti <span
id="fr_2425"></span>[2426](#fn_2425.md) (whose table is supplied by the
whole world and ministered to by land and sea); Nebridius, I say, though
in the midst of abundance and in the flower of his age, shewed himself
more modest than a girl and never gave occasion, even the slightest, for
scandalous rumours. Again though he was the friend, companion, and
cousin of princes and had been educated along with them—a thing which
makes even strangers intimate—he did not allow pride to inflate him or
frown with contempt upon others who were less fortunate than he: no, he
was kind to all, and while he loved the princes as brothers he revered
them as sovereigns. He used to avow that his own health and safety were
dependent upon theirs. Their attendants and all those officers of the
palace who by their numbers add to the grandeur of the imperial court he
had so well conciliated by shewing his regard for them, that men who
were in reality inferior to him were led by his attention to believe
themselves his peers. It is no easy task to throw one’s rank into the
shade by one’s virtue, or to gain the affection of men who are forced to
yield you precedence. What widow was not supported by his help? What
ward did not find in him a father? To him the bishops of the entire East
used to bring the prayers of the unfortunate and the petitions of the
distressed. Whenever he asked the Emperor for a boon, he sought either
alms for the poor or ransom for captives or clemency for the afflicted.
Accordingly the princes also used gladly to accede to his requests, for
they knew well that their bounty would benefit not one man but many.

<span id="v.LXXIX-p47"></span>6. Why do I farther postpone the end? “All
flesh is grass and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the
field.” <span id="fr_2426"></span>[2427](#fn_2426.md) The dust has returned
to the dust. <span id="fr_2427"></span>[2428](#fn_2427.md) He has fallen
asleep in the Lord and has been laid with his fathers, full of days and
of light and fostered in a good old age. For “wisdom is the grey hair
unto men.” <span id="fr_2428"></span>[2429](#fn_2428.md) “In a short time
he” has “fulfilled a long time.” <span
id="fr_2429"></span>[2430](#fn_2429.md) In his place we now have his
charming children. His wife is the heir of his chastity. To those who
miss his father the tiny Nebridius shews him once more, for

<span id="v.LXXIX-p52"></span>Such were the eyes and hands and looks he
bore. <span id="fr_2430"></span>[2431](#fn_2430.md)

<span id="v.LXXIX-p54"></span>A spark of the parent’s excellence shines
in the son: the child’s face betrays like a mirror a resemblance in
character.

<span id="v.LXXIX-p55"></span>That narrow frame contains a hero’s
heart. <span id="fr_2431"></span>[2432](#fn_2431.md)

<span id="v.LXXIX-p57"></span>And with him there is his sister, a basket
of roses and lilies, a mixture of ivory and purple. Her face though it
takes after that of her father inclines to be still more attractive;
and, while her complexion is that of her mother, she is so like both her
parents that the lineaments of each are reflected in her features. So
sweet and honied is she that she is the pride of all her kinsfolk. The
Emperor <span id="fr_2432"></span>[2433](#fn_2432.md) does not disdain to
hold her in his arms, and the Empress <span
id="fr_2433"></span>[2434](#fn_2433.md) likes nothing better than to nurse
her on her lap. Everyone runs to be the first to catch her up. Now she
clings to the neck of one, and now she is fondled in the arms of
another. She prattles and stammers, and is all the sweeter for her
faltering tongue.

<span id="v.LXXIX-p60"></span>7. You have, therefore, Salvina, those to
<span id="page_166">p. 166</span> <span
id="v.LXXIX-Page_166"></span>nurse who may well represent to you your
absent husband: “Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord; and the fruit
of the womb is his reward.” <span id="fr_2434"></span>[2435](#fn_2434.md)
In the place of one husband you have received two children, and thus
your affection has more objects than before. All that was due to him you
can give to them. Temper grief with love, for if he is gone they are
still with you. It is no small merit in God’s eyes to bring up children
well. Hear the apostle’s counsel: “Let not a widow be taken into the
number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man, well
reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have
lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if she have
relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good
work.” <span id="fr_2435"></span>[2436](#fn_2435.md) Here you learn the
roll of the virtues which God requires of you, what is due to the name
of widow which you bear, and by what good deeds you can attain to that
second degree of chastity <span id="fr_2436"></span>[2437](#fn_2436.md)
which is still open to you. Do not be disturbed because the apostle
allows none to be chosen as a widow under threescore years old, neither
suppose that he intends to reject those who are still young. Believe
that you are indeed chosen by him who said to his disciple, “Let no man
despise thy youth,” <span id="fr_2437"></span>[2438](#fn_2437.md) your want
of age that is, not your want of continence. If this be not his meaning,
all who become widows under threescore years will have to take husbands.
He is training a church still untaught in Christ, and making provision
for people of all stations but especially for the poor, the charge of
whom had been committed to himself and Barnabas. <span
id="fr_2438"></span>[2439](#fn_2438.md) Thus he wishes only those to be
supported by the exertions of the church who cannot labour with their
own hands, and who are widows indeed, <span
id="fr_2439"></span>[2440](#fn_2439.md) approved by their years and by
their lives. The faults of his children made Eli the priest an offence
to God. On the other hand He is appeased by the virtues of such as
“continue in faith and charity and holiness with chastity.” <span
id="fr_2440"></span>[2441](#fn_2440.md) “O Timothy,” cries the apostle,
“keep thyself pure.” <span id="fr_2441"></span>[2442](#fn_2441.md) Far be
it from me to suspect you capable of doing anything wrong; still it is
only a kindness to admonish one whose youth and opulence lead her into
temptation. You must take what I am going to say as addressed not to you
but to your girlish years. A widow “that liveth in pleasure is dead
while she liveth.” <span id="fr_2442"></span>[2443](#fn_2442.md) So speaks
the “chosen vessel” <span id="fr_2443"></span>[2444](#fn_2443.md) and the
words are brought out from his treasure who could boldly say: “Do ye
seek a proof of Christ speaking in me?” <span
id="fr_2444"></span>[2445](#fn_2444.md) Yet they are the words of one who
in his own person admitted the weakness of the human body, saying: “The
good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not that I
do.” <span id="fr_2445"></span>[2446](#fn_2445.md) And again: Therefore “I
keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means
when I have preached to others I myself should be a castaway.” <span
id="fr_2446"></span>[2447](#fn_2446.md) If Paul is afraid, which of us can
venture to be confident? If David the friend of God and Solomon who
loved God <span id="fr_2447"></span>[2448](#fn_2447.md) were overcome like
other men, if their fall is meant to warn us and their penitence to lead
us to salvation, who in this slippery life can be sure of not falling?
Never let pheasants be seen upon your table, or plump turtledoves or
black cock from Ionia, or any of those birds so expensive that they fly
away with the largest properties. And do not fancy that you eschew meat
diet when you reject pork, hare, and venison and the savoury flesh of
other quadrupeds. <span id="fr_2448"></span>[2449](#fn_2448.md) It is not
the number of feet that makes the difference but delicacy of flavour. I
know that the apostle has said: “every creature of God is good and
nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving.” <span
id="fr_2449"></span>[2450](#fn_2449.md) But the same apostle says: “it is
good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine,” <span
id="fr_2450"></span>[2451](#fn_2450.md) and in another place: “be not drunk
with wine wherein is excess.” <span id="fr_2451"></span>[2452](#fn_2451.md)
“Every creature of God is good”—the precept is intended for those who
are careful how they may please their husbands. <span
id="fr_2452"></span>[2453](#fn_2452.md) Let those feed on flesh who serve
the flesh, whose bodies boil with desire, who are tied to husbands, and
who set their hearts on having offspring. Let those whose wombs are
burthened cram their stomachs with flesh. But you have buried every
indulgence in your husband’s tomb: over his bier you have cleansed with
tears a face stained with rouge and whitelead; you have exchanged a
white robe and gilded buskins for a sombre tunic and black shoes; and
only one thing more is needed, perseverance in fasting. Let paleness and
squalor be henceforth your jewels. Do not pamper your youthful limbs
with a bed of down or kindle your young blood with hot baths. Hear what
words a heathen poet <span id="fr_2453"></span>[2454](#fn_2453.md) puts
into the mouth of a chaste widow: <span
id="fr_2454"></span>[2455](#fn_2454.md)

<span id="v.LXXIX-p82"></span>He, my first spouse, has robbed me of my
loves.

<span id="v.LXXIX-p83"></span>So be it: let him keep them in the tomb.

<span id="v.LXXIX-p84"></span>If common glass is worth so much, what
must be the value of a pearl of price? <span
id="fr_2455"></span>[2456](#fn_2455.md) If in def<span id="page_167">p.
167</span> <span id="v.LXXIX-Page_167"></span>erence to a law of nature
a Gentile widow can condemn all sensual indulgence, what must we expect
from a Christian widow who owes her chastity not to one who is dead but
to one with whom she shall reign in heaven?

<span id="v.LXXIX-p86"></span>8. Do not, I pray you, regard these
general remarks—applying as they do to all young women—as intended to
insult you or to take you to task. I write in a spirit of apprehension,
yet pray that you may never know the nature of my fears. A woman’s
reputation is a tender plant; it is like a fair flower which withers at
the slightest blast and fades away at the first breath of wind.
Especially is this so when she is of an age to fall into temptation and
the authority of a husband is wanting to her. For the very shadow of a
husband is a wife’s safeguard. What has a widow to do with a large
household or with troops of retainers? As servants, it is true, she must
not despise them, but as men she ought to blush before them. If a grand
establishment requires such domestics, let her at least set over them an
old man of spotless morals whose dignity may guard the honour of his
mistress. I know of many widows who, although they live with closed
doors, have not escaped the imputation of too great intimacy with their
servants. These latter become objects of suspicion when they dress above
their degree, or when they are stout and sleek, or when they are of an
age inclined to passion, or when knowledge of the favour in which they
are secretly held betrays itself in a too confident demeanour. For such
pride, however carefully concealed, is sure to break out in a contempt
for fellow-servants as servants. I make these seemingly superfluous
remarks that you may keep your heart with all diligence <span
id="fr_2456"></span>[2457](#fn_2456.md) and guard against every scandal
that may be broached concerning you.

<span id="v.LXXIX-p88"></span>9. Take no well-curled steward to walk
with you, no effeminate actor, no devilish singer of poisoned sweetness,
no spruce and smooth-shorn youth. Let no theatrical compliments, no
obsequious adulation be associated with you. Keep with you bands of
widows and virgins; and let your consolers be of your own sex. The
character of the mistress is judged by that of the maid. So long as you
have with you a holy mother, so long as an aunt vowed to virginity is at
your side, you ought not to neglect them and at your own risk to seek
the company of strangers. Let the divine scripture be always in your
hands, and give yourself so frequently to prayer that such shafts of
evil thoughts as ever assail the young may thereby find a shield to
repel them. It is difficult, nay more it is impossible, to escape the
beginnings of those internal motions which the Greeks with much
significance call <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.LXXIX-p88.1"></span>προπάθειαι</span> that is ‘predispositions to
passion.’ The fact is that suggestions of sin tickle all our minds, and
the decision rests with our own hearts either to admit or to reject the
thoughts which come. The Lord of nature Himself says in the gospel:—“out
of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications,
thefts, false witness, blasphemies.” <span
id="fr_2457"></span>[2458](#fn_2457.md) It is clear from the testimony of
another book that “the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his
youth,” <span id="fr_2458"></span>[2459](#fn_2458.md) and that the soul
wavers between the works of the flesh and of the spirit enumerated by
the apostle, <span id="fr_2459"></span>[2460](#fn_2459.md) desiring now the
former and now the latter. For

<span id="v.LXXIX-p92"></span>From faults no mortal man is wholly free;

<span id="v.LXXIX-p93"></span>The best is he who has but few of
them. <span id="fr_2460"></span>[2461](#fn_2460.md)

<span id="v.LXXIX-p95"></span>And, to quote the same poet,

<span id="v.LXXIX-p96"></span>At moles men cavil when they mark fair
skins. <span id="fr_2461"></span>[2462](#fn_2461.md)

<span id="v.LXXIX-p98"></span>To the same effect in different words the
prophet says:—“I am so troubled that I cannot speak,” <span
id="fr_2462"></span>[2463](#fn_2462.md) and in the same book, “Be ye angry
and sin not.” <span id="fr_2463"></span>[2464](#fn_2463.md) So Archytas of
Tarentum <span id="fr_2464"></span>[2465](#fn_2464.md) once said to a
careless steward: “I should have flogged you to death had I not been in
a passion.” For “the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of
God.” <span id="fr_2465"></span>[2466](#fn_2465.md) Now what is here said
of one form of perturbation may be applied to all. Just as anger is
human and the repression of it Christian, so it is with other passions.
The flesh always lusts after the things of the flesh, and by its
allurements draws the soul to partake of deadly pleasures; but it is for
us Christians to restrain the desire for sensual indulgence by an
intenser love for Christ. It is for us to break in the mettlesome brute
within us by fasting, in order that it may desire not lust but food and
amble easily and steadily forward having for its rider the Holy Spirit.

<span id="v.LXXIX-p103"></span>10. Why do I write thus? To shew you that
you are but human and subject, unless you guard against them, to human
passions. We are all of us made of the same clay and formed of the same
elements. Whether we wear silk or rags we are all at the mercy of the
same desire. It does not fear the royal purple; it does not disdain the
squalor of the mendicant. It is better then to suffer in stomach than in
soul, to rule the body than to serve it, to lose one’s balance than to
lose one’s chastity. Let us not lull ourselves with the delusion that we
can always fall back on penitence. For this is at best but a remedy
<span id="page_168">p. 168</span> <span id="v.LXXIX-Page_168"></span>for
misery. Let us shrink from incurring a wound which must be painful to
cure. For it is one thing to enter the haven of salvation with ship safe
and merchandise uninjured, and another to cling naked to a plank and, as
the waves toss you this way and that, to be dashed again and again on
the sharp rocks. A widow should be ignorant that second marriage is
permitted; she should know nothing of the apostle’s words:—“It is better
to marry than to burn.” <span id="fr_2466"></span>[2467](#fn_2466.md)
Remove what is said to be worse, the risk of burning, and marriage will
cease to be regarded as good. Of course I repudiate the slanders of the
heretics; I know that “marriage is honourable…and the bed
undefiled.” <span id="fr_2467"></span>[2468](#fn_2467.md) Yet Adam even
after he was expelled from paradise had but one wife. The accursed and
blood-stained Lamech, descended from the stock of Cain, was the first to
make out of one rib two wives; and the seedling of digamy then planted
was altogether destroyed by the doom of the deluge. It is true that in
writing to Timothy the apostle from fear of fornication is forced to
countenance second marriage. His words are these:—“I will therefore that
the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none
occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.” But he immediately
adds as a reason for this concession; “for some are already turned aside
after Satan.” <span id="fr_2468"></span>[2469](#fn_2468.md) Thus we see
that he is offering not a crown to those who stand but a helping hand to
those who are down. What must a second marriage be if it is looked on
merely as an alternative to the brothel! “For some,” he writes, “are
already turned aside after Satan.” The upshot of the whole matter is
that, if a young widow cannot or will not contain herself, she had
better take a husband to her bed than the devil.

<span id="v.LXXIX-p107"></span>A noble alternative truly which is only
to be embraced in preference to Satan! In old days even Jerusalem went
a-whoring and opened her feet to every one that passed by. <span
id="fr_2469"></span>[2470](#fn_2469.md) It was in Egypt that she was first
deflowered and there that her teats were bruised. <span
id="fr_2470"></span>[2471](#fn_2470.md) And afterwards when she had come to
the wilderness and, impatient of the delays of her leader Moses, had
said when maddened by the stings of lust: “these be thy gods, O Israel,
which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt,” <span
id="fr_2471"></span>[2472](#fn_2471.md) she received statutes that were not
good and commandments that were altogether evil whereby she should not
live <span id="fr_2472"></span>[2473](#fn_2472.md) but should be punished
through them. Is it surprising then that when the apostle had said in
another place of young widows: “when they have begun to wax wanton
against Christ they will marry, having damnation because they have cast
off their first faith,” <span id="fr_2473"></span>[2474](#fn_2473.md) he
granted to such as should wax wanton statutes of digamy that were not
good and commandments that were altogether evil? For the reason which he
gives for allowing a second husband would justify a woman in marrying a
third or even, if she liked, a twentieth. He evidently wished to shew
them that he was not so much anxious that they should take husbands as
that they should avoid paramours. These things, dearest daughter in
Christ, I impress upon you and frequently repeat, that you may forget
those things which are behind and reach forth unto those things which
are before. <span id="fr_2474"></span>[2475](#fn_2474.md) You have widows
like yourself worthy to be your models, Judith renowned in Hebrew story
and Anna the daughter of Phanuel famous in the gospel. Both these lived
day and night in the temple and preserved the treasure of their chastity
by prayer and by fasting. One was a type of the Church which cuts off
the head of the devil <span id="fr_2475"></span>[2476](#fn_2475.md) and the
other first received in her arms the saviour of the world and had
revealed to her the holy mysteries which were to come. <span
id="fr_2476"></span>[2477](#fn_2476.md) In conclusion I beg you to
attribute the shortness of my letter not to want of language or scarcity
of matter but to a deep sense of modesty which makes me fear to force
myself too long upon the ears of a stranger, and causes me to dread the
secret verdict of those who read my words.
