<span id="v.LXXXVII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.LXXXVII-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXXVII. From Theophilus to
Jerome.</span>

<span id="v.LXXXVII-p2"></span>Theophilus informs Jerome that he has
expelled the Origenists from the monasteries of Nitria, and urges him to
shew his zeal for the faith by writing against the prevalent heresy. The
date of the letter is 400 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.LXXXVII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.LXXXVII-p3"></span>Theophilus, bishop, to the well-beloved
and most loving brother, the presbyter Jerome. The reverend bishop
Agatho with the well-beloved deacon Athanasius is accredited to you with
tidings relating to the church. When you learn their import I feel no
doubt but that you will approve my resolution and will exult in the
church’s victory. For we have cut down with the prophet’s sickle <span
id="fr_2618"></span>[2619](#fn_2618) certain wicked fanatics who were
eager to sow broadcast in the monasteries of Nitria the heresy of
Origen. We have remembered the warning words of the apostle, “rebuke
with all authority.” <span id="fr_2619"></span>[2620](#fn_2619) Do you
therefore on your part, as you hope to receive a share in this reward,
make haste to bring back with scriptural discourses those who have been
deceived. It is our desire, if possible, to guard in our days not only
the Catholic faith and the rules of the church, but the people committed
to our charge, and to give a quietus to all strange doctrines.
