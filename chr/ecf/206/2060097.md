<span id="v.LXXXVI-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.LXXXVI-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXXVI. To Theophilus.</span>

<span id="v.LXXXVI-p2"></span>Jerome congratulates Theophilus on the
success of his crusade against Origenism, and speaks of the good work
done in Palestine by his emissaries Priscus and Eubulus. He then (by a
singular change in his sentiments) asks Theophilus to forgive John of
Jerusalem for having unwittingly received an excommunicated Egyptian.
The date of the Letter is 400 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.LXXXVI-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.LXXXVI-p3"></span>Jerome to the most blessed Pope
Theophilus. I have recently received despatches from your blessedness
setting right your long silence and summoning me to return to my duty.
So, though the reverend brothers Priscus and Eubulus have been slow in
bringing me your letters, yet, as they are now hastening in the ardour
of faith from end to end of Palestine and scattering and driving into
their holes the basilisks of heresy, I write a few lines to congratulate
you on your success. The whole world glories in your victories. An
exultant crowd of all nations gazes on the standard of the cross raised
by you at Alexandria and upon the shining trophies which mark your
triumph over heresy. Blessings on your courage! blessings on your zeal!
You have shewn that your long silence has been due to policy and not to
inclination. I speak quite openly to your reverence. I grieved to find
you too forbearing, and, knowing nothing of the course shaped by the
pilot, I yearned for the destruction of those abandoned men. But, as I
now see, you have had your hand raised and, if you have delayed to
strike, it has only been that you might strike harder. As regards the
welcome given to a certain person, <span
id="fr_2616"></span>[2617](#fn_2616) you have no reason to be vexed with
<span id="page_183">p. 183</span> <span
id="v.LXXXVI-Page_183"></span>the prelate of this city; <span
id="fr_2617"></span>[2618](#fn_2617) for as you gave no instructions on
the point in your letter, it would have been rash in him to decide a
case of which he knew nothing. Still I think that he would neither wish
nor venture to annoy you in any way.

<span id="v.LXXXVI-p4"></span> Doubtless some Egyptian monk or
ecclesiastic placed under ban by Theophilus on account of Origenism.

id="v.LXXXVI-p4.1"></span>

<span id="v.LXXXVI-p5"></span> John of Jerusalem. He had probably, like
Rufinus, been reconciled to Jerome, and seems to have taken no part in
the subsequent quarrel between Jerome and Rufinus.
