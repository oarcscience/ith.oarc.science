<span id="v.CXXXIX"></span>

<span id="v.CXXXIX-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.CXXXIX-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXXIX. To Apronius.</span>

<span id="v.CXXXIX-p2"></span>Of Apronius nothing is known; but from the
mention of Innocent (for whom see Letter CXLIII.) it seems a fair
inference that he lived in the West. Jerome here congratulates him on
his steadfastness in the faith and exhorts him to come to Bethlehem. He
then touches on the mischief done by Pelagius and complains that his own
monastery has been destroyed by him or by his partisans. The date of the
letter is <span class="c17"><span id="v.CXXXIX-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>
417.

<span id="v.CXXXIX-p3"></span>I know not by what wiles of the devil it
has come to pass that all your toil and the efforts of the reverend
presbyter Innocent <span id="fr_3890"></span>[3891](#fn_3890.md) and my own
prayers and wishes seem for the moment to produce no effect. God be
thanked that you are well and that the fire of faith glows in you even
when you are in the midst of the devil’s wiles. My greatest joy is to
hear that my spiritual sons are fighting in the cause of Christ; and
assuredly He in whom we believe will so quicken this zeal of ours that
we shall be glad freely to shed our blood in defence of His faith.

<span id="v.CXXXIX-p5"></span>I grieve to hear that a noble family has
been subverted, <span id="fr_3891"></span>[3892](#fn_3891.md) for what
reason I cannot learn; for the bearer of the letter could give me no
information. We may well grieve over the loss of our common friends and
ask Christ the only potentate and Lord <span
id="fr_3892"></span>[3893](#fn_3892.md) to have mercy upon them. At the
same time we have deserved to receive punishment at God’s hand for
we <span id="fr_3893"></span>[3894](#fn_3893.md) have harboured the enemies
of the Lord.

<span id="v.CXXXIX-p9"></span>The best course you can take is to leave
everything and to come to the East, before all to the holy places; for
everything is now quiet here. The heretics have not, it is true, purged
the venom from their breasts, but they do not venture to open their
impious mouths. They are “like the deaf adder that stoppeth her
ear.” <span id="fr_3894"></span>[3895](#fn_3894.md) Salute your reverend
brothers on my behalf.

<span id="v.CXXXIX-p11"></span>As for our house, <span
id="fr_3895"></span>[3896](#fn_3895.md) so far as fleshly wealth is
concerned, it has been completely destroyed by the onslaughts of the
heretics; but by the mercy of Christ it is still filled with spiritual
riches. To live on bread is better than to lose the faith.

<span id="fn_3890"></span>[282:3891](2060150.htm#fr_3890.md) <span
id="v.CXXXIX-p3.1"></span>

<span id="v.CXXXIX-p4"></span> At this time in Palestine whither he had
come as the bearer of letters from Augustine to Jerome and others.

<span id="fn_3891"></span>[282:3892](2060150.htm#fr_3891.md) <span
id="v.CXXXIX-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.CXXXIX-p6"></span> The family meant is probably the one
warned by Jerome in his letter to Ctesiphon (CXXXIII, § 13). In that
case the troubler of its peace is of course Pelagius.

<span id="fn_3892"></span>[282:3893](2060150.htm#fr_3892.md) <span

<span id="fn_3893"></span>[282:3894](2060150.htm#fr_3893.md) <span
id="v.CXXXIX-p7.2"></span>

<span id="v.CXXXIX-p8"></span> It would seem as if Jerome, like
Augustine, had at first thought favourably of Pelagius.

Jerome’s guidance at Bethlehem. See Letters CXXXV.–CXXXVII.
