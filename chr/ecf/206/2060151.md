id="v.CXL-p1.1"></span>Letter CXL. To Cyprian the Presbyter.</span>

<span id="v.CXL-p2"></span>Cyprian had visited Jerome at Bethlehem and
had asked him to write an exposition of Psalm XC. in simple language
such as might be readily understood. With this request Jerome now
complies, giving a very full account of the psalm, verse by verse, and
bringing the treasures of his learning and especially his knowledge of
Hebrew to bear upon it. He asserts its Mosaic authorship but is careful
to add that “the man of God” may have spoken not for himself but in the
name of the Jewish people. He speaks of the five books into which the
psalter is divisible and says that it is a mistake to ascribe all the
psalms to David. An allusion to the doctrine of Pelagius shows that the
letter must belong to Jerome’s last years, and Vallarsi is probably
right in assigning it to <span class="c17"><span
id="v.CXL-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 418.
