id="v.CXXXI-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXXI. From Augustine.</span>

<span id="v.CXXXI-p2"></span>At the suggestion of Jerome, Marcellinus
(for whom see Letter CXXVI.) had consulted Augustine on the difficult
question of the origin of the soul but had failed to get any definite
opinion from this latter. Augustine now writes to Jerome confessing his
inability to decide the question and asking for advice upon it. He
begins by reciting—and justifying—his own belief that the soul is
immortal and incorporeal and that its fall into sin is due not to God
but to its own free choice. He then goes on to say that he is quite
ready to accept creationism as a solution of the difficulty if Jerome
will shew him how this theory is reconcilable with the church’s
condemnation of Pelagius and its assertion of the doctrine of original
sin. The damnation of unbaptized infants is assumed throughout.

<span id="v.CXXXI-p3"></span>The date of the letter is 415 <span
class="c17"><span id="v.CXXXI-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> Its number in the
Letters of Augustine is CLXVI.
