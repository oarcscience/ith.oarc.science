<span id="v.XLVIII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XLVIII-p1.1"></span>Letter XLVIII. To Pammachius.</span>

<span id="v.XLVIII-p2"></span>An “apology” for the two books “against
Jovinian” which Jerome had written a short time previously, and of which
he had sent copies to Rome. These Pammachius and his other friends had
withheld from publication, thinking that Jerome had unduly exalted
virginity at the expense of marriage. He now writes to make good his
position, and to do this makes copious extracts from the obnoxious
treatise. The date of the letter is 393 or 394 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XLVIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.XLVIII-p3"></span>1. Your own silence is my reason for not
having written hitherto. For I feared that, if I were to write to you
without first hearing from you, you would consider me not so much a
conscientious as a troublesome correspondent. But, now that I have been
challenged by your most delightful letter, a letter which calls upon me
to defend my views by an appeal to first principles, I receive my old
fellow-learner, companion, and friend with open arms, as the saying
goes; and I look forward to having in you a champion of my poor
writings; if, that is to say, I can first conciliate your judgment to
give sentence in my favor, and can instruct my advocate in all those
points on which I am assailed. For both your favorite, Cicero, and
before him—in his one short treatise—Antonius, <span
id="fr_1036"></span>[1037](#fn_1036.md) write to this effect, that the
chief requisite for victory is to acquaint one’s self carefully with the
case which one has to plead.

<span id="v.XLVIII-p5"></span>2. Certain persons find fault with me
because in the books which I have written against Jovinian I have been
excessive (so they say) in praise of virginity and in depreciation of
marriage; and they affirm that to preach up chastity till no comparison
is left between a wife and a virgin is equivalent to a condemnation of
matrimony. If I remember aright the point of the dispute, the question
at issue between myself and Jovinian is that he puts marriage on a level
with virginity, while I make it inferior; he declares that there is
little or no difference between the two states, I assert that there is a
great deal. Finally—a result due under God to your agency—he has been
condemned because he has dared to set matrimony on an equality with
perpetual chastity. Or, if a virgin and a wife are to be looked on as
the same, how comes it that Rome has refused to listen to this impious
doctrine? A virgin owes her being to a man, but a man does not owe his
to a virgin. There can be no middle course. Either my view of the matter
must be embraced, or else that of Jovinian. If I am blamed for putting
wed<span id="page_67">p. 67</span> <span
id="v.XLVIII-Page_67"></span>lock below virginity, he must be praised
for putting the two states on a level. If, on the other hand, he is
condemned for supposing them equal, his condemnation must be taken as
testimony in favor of my treatise. If men of the world chafe under the
notion that they occupy a position inferior to that of virgins, I wonder
that clergymen and monks—who both live celibate lives—refrain from
praising what they consistently practise. They cut themselves off from
their wives to imitate the chastity of virgins, and yet they will have
it that married women are as good as these. They should either be joined
again to their wives whom they have renounced, or, if they persist in
living apart from them, they will have to confess—by their lives if not
by their words—that, in preferring virginity to marriage, they have
chosen the better course. Am I then a mere novice in the Scriptures,
reading the sacred volumes for the first time? And is the line there
drawn between virginity and marriage so fine that I have been unable to
observe it? I could know nothing, forsooth, of the saying, “Be not
righteous overmuch!” <span id="fr_1037"></span>[1038](#fn_1037.md) Thus,
while I try to protect myself on one side, I am wounded on the other; to
speak more plainly still, while I close with Jovinian in hand-to-hand
combat, Manichæus stabs me in the back. Have I not, I would ask, in the
very forefront of my work set the following preface: <span
id="fr_1038"></span>[1039](#fn_1038.md) “We are no disciples of
Marcion <span id="fr_1039"></span>[1040](#fn_1039.md) or of
Manichæus, <span id="fr_1040"></span>[1041](#fn_1040.md) to detract from
marriage. Nor are we deceived by the error of Tatian, <span
id="fr_1041"></span>[1042](#fn_1041.md) the chief of the Encratites, <span
id="fr_1042"></span>[1043](#fn_1042.md) into supposing all cohabitation
unclean. For he condemns and reprobates not marriage only, but foods
also which God has created for us to enjoy. <span
id="fr_1043"></span>[1044](#fn_1043.md) We know that in a large house there
are vessels not only of silver and of gold, but of wood also and of
earth. <span id="fr_1044"></span>[1045](#fn_1044.md) We know, too, that on
the foundation of Christ which Paul the master builder has laid, some
build up gold, silver, and precious stones; others, on the contrary,
hay, wood, and stubble. <span id="fr_1045"></span>[1046](#fn_1045.md) We
are not ignorant that ‘marriage is honorable…and the bed
undefiled.’ <span id="fr_1046"></span>[1047](#fn_1046.md) We have read the
first decree of God: ‘Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the
earth.’ <span id="fr_1047"></span>[1048](#fn_1047.md) But while we allow
marriage, we prefer the virginity which springs from it. Gold is more
precious than silver, but is silver on that account the less silver? Is
it an insult to a tree to prefer its apples to its roots or its leaves?
Is it an injury to corn to put the ear before the stalk and the blade?
As apples come from the tree and grain from the straw, so virginity
comes from wedlock. Yields of one hundredfold, of sixtyfold, and of
thirtyfold <span id="fr_1048"></span>[1049](#fn_1048.md) may all come from
one soil and from one sowing, yet they will differ widely in quantity.
The yield thirtyfold signifies wedlock, for the joining together of the
fingers to express that number, suggestive as it is of a loving gentle
kiss or embracing, aptly represents the relation of husband and wife.
The yield sixtyfold refers to widows who are placed in a position of
distress and tribulation. Accordingly, they are typified by that finger
which is placed under the other to express the number sixty; for, as it
is extremely trying when one has once tasted pleasure to abstain from
its enticements, so the reward of doing this is proportionately great.
Moreover, a hundred—I ask the reader to give me his best
attention—necessitates a change from the left hand to the right; but
while the hand is different the fingers are the same as those which on
the left hand signify married women and widows; only in this instance
the circle formed by them indicates the crown of virginity.” <span
id="fr_1049"></span>[1050](#fn_1049.md)

<span id="v.XLVIII-p19"></span>3. Does a man who speaks thus, I would
ask you, condemn marriage? If I have called virginity gold, I have
spoken of marriage as silver. I have set forth that the yields an
hundredfold, sixtyfold, and thirtyfold—all spring from one soil and from
one sowing, although in amount they differ widely. Will any of my
readers be so unfair as to judge me, not by my words, but by his own
opinion? At any rate, I have dealt much more gently with marriage than
most Latin and Greek writers; <span id="fr_1050"></span>[1051](#fn_1050.md)
who, by referring the hundredfold yield to martyrs, the sixtyfold to
virgins, and the thirtyfold to widows, show that in their opinion
married persons are excluded from the good ground and from the seed of
the great Father. <span id="fr_1051"></span>[1052](#fn_1051.md) But, lest
it might be supposed that, though cautious at the outset, I was
imprudent in the remainder of my work, have I not, after <span
id="page_68">p. 68</span> <span id="v.XLVIII-Page_68"></span>marking out
the divisions of it, on coming to the actual questions immediately
introduced the following: <span id="fr_1052"></span>[1053](#fn_1052.md) “I
ask all of you of both sexes, at once those who are virgins and
continent and those who are married or twice married, to aid my efforts
with your prayers.” Jovinian is the foe of all indiscriminately, but can
I condemn as Manichæan heretics persons whose prayers I need and whose
assistance I entreat to help me in my work?

<span id="v.XLVIII-p23"></span>4. As the brief compass of a letter does
not suffer us to delay too long on a single point, let us now pass to
those which remain. In explaining the testimony of the apostle, “The
wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband; and likewise,
also, the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife,” <span
id="fr_1053"></span>[1054](#fn_1053.md) we have subjoined the
following: <span id="fr_1054"></span>[1055](#fn_1054.md) “The entire
question relates to those who are living in wedlock, whether it is
lawful for them to put away their wives, a thing which the Lord also has
forbidden in the Gospel. <span id="fr_1055"></span>[1056](#fn_1055.md)
Hence, also, the apostle says: ‘It is good for a man not to touch’ a
wife or ‘a woman,’ <span id="fr_1056"></span>[1057](#fn_1056.md) as if
there were danger in the contact which he who should so touch one could
not escape. Accordingly, when the Egyptian woman desired to touch Joseph
he flung away his cloak and fled from her hands. <span
id="fr_1057"></span>[1058](#fn_1057.md) But as he who has once married a
wife cannot, except by consent, abstain from intercourse with her or
repudiate her, so long as she does not sin, he must render unto his wife
her due, <span id="fr_1058"></span>[1059](#fn_1058.md) because he has of
his own free will bound himself to render it under compulsion.” Can one
who declares that it is a precept of the Lord that wives should not be
put away, and that what God has joined together man must not, without
consent, put asunder <span id="fr_1059"></span>[1060](#fn_1059.md) —can
such an one be said to condemn marriage? Again, in the verses which
follow, the apostle says: “But every man hath his proper gift of God,
one after this manner, and another after that.” <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[1061](#fn_1060.md) In explanation of this saying we
made the following remarks: <span id="fr_1061"></span>[1062](#fn_1061.md)
“What I myself would wish, he says, is clear. But since there are
diversities of gifts in the church, <span
id="fr_1062"></span>[1063](#fn_1062.md) I allow marriage as well, that I
may not appear to condemn nature. Reflect, too, that the gift of
virginity is one thing, that of marriage another. For had there been one
reward for married women and for virgins he would never, after giving
the counsel of continence, have gone on to say: ‘But every man hath his
proper gift of God, one after this manner and another after that.’ Where
each class has its proper gift, there must be some distinction between
the classes. I allow that marriage, as well as virginity, is the gift of
God, but there is a great difference between gift and gift. Finally, the
apostle himself says of one who had lived in incest and afterwards
repented: ‘Contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort
him,’ <span id="fr_1063"></span>[1064](#fn_1063.md) and ‘To whom ye forgive
anything, I forgive also.’ <span id="fr_1064"></span>[1065](#fn_1064.md)
And, lest we might suppose a man’s gift to be but a small thing, he has
added: ‘For if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes
forgave I it in the sight <span id="fr_1065"></span>[1066](#fn_1065.md) of
Christ.’ <span id="fr_1066"></span>[1067](#fn_1066.md) The gifts of Christ
are different. Hence Joseph as a type of Him had a coat of many
colors. <span id="fr_1067"></span>[1068](#fn_1067.md) So in the
forty-fourth psalm <span id="fr_1068"></span>[1069](#fn_1068.md) we read of
the Church: ‘Upon thy right hand did stand the queen in a vesture of
gold, wrought about with divers colors.’ <span
id="fr_1069"></span>[1070](#fn_1069.md) The apostle Peter, too, speaks (of
husbands and wives) ‘as being heirs together of the manifold grace of
God.’ <span id="fr_1070"></span>[1071](#fn_1070.md) In Greek the expression
is still more striking, the word used being <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.XLVIII-p41.2"></span>ποικίλη</span>, that is, ‘many-colored.’”

<span id="v.XLVIII-p42"></span>5. I ask, then, what is the meaning of
men’s obstinate determination to shut their eyes and to refuse to look
on what is as clear as day? I have said that there are diversities of
gifts in the Church, and that virginity is one gift and wedlock another.
And shortly after I have used the words: “I allow marriage also to be a
gift of God, but there is a great difference between gift and gift.” Can
it be said that I condemn that which in the clearest terms I declare to
be the gift of God? Moreover, if Joseph is taken as a type of the Lord,
his coat of many colors is a type of virgins and widows, celibates and
wedded. Can any one who has any part in Christ’s tunic be regarded as an
alien? Have we not spoken of the very queen herself—that is, the Church
of the Saviour—as wearing a vesture of gold wrought about with divers
colors? Moreover, when I came to discuss marriage in connection with the
following verses, <span id="fr_1071"></span>[1072](#fn_1071.md) I still
adhered to the same view. <span id="fr_1072"></span>[1073](#fn_1072.md)
“This passage,” I said, “has indeed no relation to the present
controversy; for, following the decision of the Lord, the apostle
teaches that a wife must not be put away saving for fornication, and
<span id="page_69">p. 69</span> <span id="v.XLVIII-Page_69"></span>that,
if she has been put away, she cannot during the lifetime of her husband
marry another man, or, at any rate, that she ought, if possible, to be
reconciled to her husband. In another verse he speaks to the same
effect: ‘The wife is bound…as long as her husband liveth; but if her
husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband; <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[1074](#fn_1073.md) she is at liberty to be married to
whom she will; only in the Lord,’ <span
id="fr_1074"></span>[1075](#fn_1074.md) that is to a Christian. Thus the
apostle, while he allows a second or a third marriage in the Lord,
forbids even a first with a heathen.”

<span id="v.XLVIII-p47"></span>6. I ask my detractors to open their ears
and to realize the fact that I have allowed second and third marriages
“in the Lord.” If, then, I have not condemned second and third
marriages, how can I have proscribed a first? Moreover, in the passage
where I interpret the words of the apostle, “Is any man called being
circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in
uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised” <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[1076](#fn_1075.md) (a passage, it is true, which some
most careful interpreters of Scripture refer to the circumcision and
slavery of the Law), do I not in the clearest terms stand up for the
marriage-tie? My words are these: <span
id="fr_1076"></span>[1077](#fn_1076.md) “‘If any man is called in
uncircumcision, let him not be circumcised.’ You had a wife, the apostle
says, when you believed. Do not fancy your faith in Christ to be a
reason for parting from her. For ‘God hath called us in peace.’ <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[1078](#fn_1077.md) ‘Circumcision is nothing and
uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of
God.’ <span id="fr_1078"></span>[1079](#fn_1078.md) Neither celibacy nor
wedlock is of the slightest use without works, since even faith, the
distinguishing mark of Christians, if it have not works, is said to be
dead, <span id="fr_1079"></span>[1080](#fn_1079.md) and on such terms as
these the virgins of Vesta or of Juno, who was constant to one <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080.md) husband, might claim to be numbered
among the saints. And a little further on he says: ‘Art thou called
being a servant, care not for it; but, if thou mayest be made free, use
it rather;’ <span id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081.md) that is to say,
if you have a wife, and are bound to her, and render her her due, and
have not power of your own body—or, to speak yet more plainly—if you are
the slave of a wife, do not allow this to cause you sorrow, do not sigh
over the loss of your virginity. Even if you can find pretexts for
parting from her to enjoy the freedom of chastity, do not seek your own
welfare at the price of another’s ruin. Keep your wife for a little, and
do not try too hastily to overcome her reluctance. Wait till she follows
your example. If you only have patience, your wife will some day become
your sister.”

<span id="v.XLVIII-p55"></span>7. In another passage we have discussed
the reasons which led Paul to say: “Now concerning virgins, I have no
commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath
obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.” <span
id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082.md) Here also, while we have extolled
virginity, we have been careful to give marriage its due. <span
id="fr_1083"></span>[1084](#fn_1083.md) “Had the Lord commanded virginity,”
we said, “He would have seemed to condemn marriage and to do away with
that seed-plot of humanity from which virginity itself springs. Had He
cut away the root how could He have looked for fruit? Unless He had
first laid the foundations, how could He have built the edifice or
crowned it with a roof made to cover its whole extent?” If we have
spoken of marriage as the root whose fruit is virginity, and if we have
made wedlock the foundation on which the building or the roof of
perpetual chastity is raised, which of my detractors can be so captious
or so blind as to ignore the foundation on which the fabric and its roof
are built, while he has before his eyes both the fabric and the roof
themselves? Once more, in another place, we have brought forward the
testimony of the apostle to this effect: “Art thou bound unto a wife?
Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a
wife.” <span id="fr_1084"></span>[1085](#fn_1084.md) To this we have
appended the following remarks: <span
id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085.md) “Each of us has his own sphere
allotted to him. Let me have mine, and do you keep yours. If you are
bound to a wife, do not put her away. If I am loosed from a wife, let me
not seek a wife. Just as I do not loose marriage-ties when they are once
made, so do you refrain from binding together what at present is loosed
from such ties.” Yet another passage bears unmistakable testimony to the
view which we have taken of virginity and of wedlock: <span
id="fr_1086"></span>[1087](#fn_1086.md) “The apostle casts no snare upon
us, <span id="fr_1087"></span>[1088](#fn_1087.md) nor does he compel us to
be what we do not wish. He only urges us to what is honorable and
seemly, inciting us earnestly to serve the Lord, to be anxious always to
please Him, and to look for His will which He has prepared for us to do.
We are to be like alert and armed soldiers, who immediately execute the
orders given to them and perform them without that travail of mind <span
id="fr_1088"></span>[1089](#fn_1088.md) which, <span id="page_70">p.
70</span> <span id="v.XLVIII-Page_70"></span>according to the preacher,
is given to the men of this world ‘to be exercised therewith.’” <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[1090](#fn_1089.md) At the end, also, of our comparison
of virgins and married women we have summed up the discussion
thus: <span id="fr_1090"></span>[1091](#fn_1090.md) “When one thing is good
and another thing is better; when that which is good has a different
reward from that which is better; and when there are more rewards than
one, then, obviously, there exists a diversity of gifts. The difference
between marriage and virginity is as great as that between not doing
evil and doing good—or, to speak more favorably still, as that between
what is good and what is still better.”

<span id="v.XLVIII-p65"></span>8. In the sequel we go on to speak
thus: <span id="fr_1091"></span>[1092](#fn_1091.md) “The apostle, in
concluding his discussion of marriage and of virginity, is careful to
observe a mean course in discriminating between them, and, turning
neither to the right hand nor to the left, he keeps to the King’s
highway, <span id="fr_1092"></span>[1093](#fn_1092.md) and thus fulfils the
injunction, ‘Be not righteous overmuch.’ <span
id="fr_1093"></span>[1094](#fn_1093.md) Moreover, when he goes on to
compare monogamy with digamy, he puts digamy after monogamy, just as
before he subordinated marriage to virginity.” Do we not clearly show by
this language what is typified in the Holy Scriptures by the terms right
and left, and also what we take to be the meaning of the words “Be not
righteous overmuch”? We turn to the left if, following the lust of Jews
and Gentiles, we burn for sexual intercourse; we turn to the right if,
following the error of the Manichæans, we under a pretence of chastity
entangle ourselves in the meshes of unchastity. But we keep to the
King’s highway if we aspire to virginity yet refrain from condemning
marriage. Can any one, moreover, be so unfair in his criticism of my
poor treatise as to allege that I condemn first marriages, when he reads
my opinion on second ones as follows: <span
id="fr_1094"></span>[1095](#fn_1094.md) “The apostle, it is true, allows
second marriages, but only to such women as are bent upon them, to such
as cannot contain, <span id="fr_1095"></span>[1096](#fn_1095.md) lest ‘when
they have begun to wax wanton against Christ they marry, having
condemnation because they have rejected their first faith,’ <span
id="fr_1096"></span>[1097](#fn_1096.md) and he makes this concession
because many ‘are turned aside after Satan.’ <span
id="fr_1097"></span>[1098](#fn_1097.md) But they will be happier if they
abide as widows. To this he immediately adds his apostolical authority,
‘after my judgment.’ Moreover, lest any should consider that authority,
being human, to be of small weight, he goes on to say, ‘and I think also
that I have the spirit of God.’ <span
id="fr_1098"></span>[1099](#fn_1098.md) Thus, where he urges men to
continence he appeals not to human authority, but to the Spirit of God;
but when he gives them permission to marry he does not mention the
Spirit of God, but allows prudential considerations to turn the balance,
relaxing the strictness of his code in favor of individuals according to
their several needs.” Having thus brought forward proofs that second
marriages are allowed by the apostle, we at once added the remarks which
follow: <span id="fr_1099"></span>[1100](#fn_1099.md) “As marriage is
permitted to virgins by reason of the danger of fornication, and as what
in itself is not desirable is thus made excusable, so by reason of the
same danger widows are permitted to marry a second time. For it is
better that a woman should know one man (though he should be a second
husband or a third) than that she should know several. In other words,
it is preferable that she should prostitute herself to one rather than
to many.” Calumny may do its worst. We have spoken here not of a first
marriage, but of a second, of a third, or (if you like) of a fourth. But
lest any one should apply my words (that it is better for a woman to
prostitute herself to one man than to several) to a first marriage when
my whole argument dealt with digamy and trigamy, I marked my own view of
these practices with the words: <span
id="fr_1100"></span>[1101](#fn_1100.md) “‘All things are lawful, but all
things are not expedient.’ <span id="fr_1101"></span>[1102](#fn_1101.md) I
do not condemn digamists nor yet trigamists, nor even, to put an
extreme, case, octogamists. I will make a still greater concession: I am
ready to receive even a whore-monger, if penitent. In every case where
fairness is possible, fair consideration must be shown.”

<span id="v.XLVIII-p77"></span>9. My calumniator should blush at his
assertion that I condemn first marriages when he reads my words just now
quoted: “I do not condemn digamists or trigamists, or even, to put an
extreme case, octogamists.” Not to condemn is one thing, to commend is
another. I may concede a practice as allowable and yet not praise it as
meritorious. But if I seem severe in saying, “In every case where
fairness is possible, fair consideration must be shown,” no one, I
fancy, will judge me either cruel or stern who reads that the places
prepared for virgins and for wedded persons are different from those
prepared for trigamists, octogamists, and penitents. That Christ
Himself, although in the flesh a virgin, was in the spirit a monogamist,
<span id="page_71">p. 71</span> <span
id="v.XLVIII-Page_71"></span>having one wife, even the Church, <span
id="fr_1102"></span>[1103](#fn_1102.md) I have shown in the latter part of
my argument. <span id="fr_1103"></span>[1104](#fn_1103.md) And yet I am
supposed to condemn marriage! I am said to condemn it, although I use
such words as these: <span id="fr_1104"></span>[1105](#fn_1104.md) “It is
an undoubted fact that the levitical priests were descended from the
stock of Aaron, Eleazar, and Phinehas; and, as all these were married
men, we might well be confronted with them if, led away by the error of
the Encratites, we were to contend that marriage is in itself deserving
of condemnation.” Here I blame Tatian, the chief of the Encratites, for
his rejection of marriage, and yet I myself am said to condemn it! Once
more, when I contrast virgins with widows, my own words show what my
view is concerning wedlock, and set forth the threefold gradation which
I propose of virgins, widows—whether in practice or in fact <span
id="fr_1105"></span>[1106](#fn_1105.md) —and wedded wives. “I do not
deny”—these are my words <span id="fr_1106"></span>[1107](#fn_1106.md)
—“the blessedness of widows who continue such after their baptism, nor
do I undervalue the merit of wives who live in chastity with their
husbands; but, just as widows receive a greater reward from God than
wives obedient to their husbands, they, too, must be content to see
virgins preferred before themselves.”

<span id="v.XLVIII-p83"></span>10. Again, when explaining the witness of
the apostle to the Galatians, “By the works of the law shall no flesh be
justified,” I have spoken to the following effect: “Marriages also are
works of the law. And for this reason there is a curse upon such as do
not produce offspring. They are permitted, it is true, even under the
Gospel; but it is one thing to concede an indulgence to what is a
weakness and quite another to promise a reward to what is a virtue.” See
my express declaration that marriage is allowed in the Gospel, yet that
those who are married cannot receive the rewards of chastity so long as
they render their due one to another. If married men feel indignant at
this statement, let them vent their anger not on me but on the Holy
Scriptures; nay, more, upon all bishops, presbyters, and deacons, and
the whole company of priests and levites, who know that they cannot
offer sacrifices if they fulfil the obligations of marriage. Again, when
I adduce evidence from the Apocalypse, <span
id="fr_1107"></span>[1108](#fn_1107.md) is it not clear what view I take
concerning virgins, widows, and wives? “These are they who sing a new
song <span id="fr_1108"></span>[1109](#fn_1108.md) which no man can sing
except he be a virgin. These are ‘the first fruits unto God and unto the
Lamb,’ <span id="fr_1109"></span>[1110](#fn_1109.md) and they are without
spot. If virgins are the first fruits unto God, then widows and wives
who live in continence must come after the first fruits—that is to say,
in the second place and in the third.” We place widows, then, and wives
in the second place and in the third, and for this we are charged by the
frenzy of a heretic with condemning marriage altogether.

<span id="v.XLVIII-p87"></span>11. Throughout the book I have made many
remarks in a tone of great moderation on virginity, widowhood, and
marriage. But for the sake of brevity, I will here adduce but one
passage, and that of such a kind that no one, I think, will be found to
gainsay it save some one who wishes to prove himself malicious or mad.
In describing our Lord’s visit to the marriage at Cana in Galilee, <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[1111](#fn_1110.md) after some other remarks I have
added these: <span id="fr_1111"></span>[1112](#fn_1111.md) “He who went but
once to a marriage has taught us that a woman should marry but once; and
this fact might tell against virginity if we failed to give marriage its
due place—after virginity that is, and chaste widowhood. But, as it is
only heretics who condemn marriage and tread under foot the ordinance of
God, we listen with gladness to every word said by our Lord in praise of
marriage. For the Church does not condemn marriage, but only
subordinates it. It does not reject it altogether, but regulates it,
knowing (as I have said above) that ‘in a great house there are not only
vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some
to honor and some to dishonor. If a man, therefore, purge himself…he
shall be a vessel unto honor meet…and prepared unto every good
work.’” <span id="fr_1112"></span>[1113](#fn_1112.md) I listen with
gladness, I say here, to every word said by the apostle in praise of
marriage. Do I listen with gladness to the praise of marriage, and do I
yet condemn marriage? The Church, I say, does not condemn wedlock, but
subordinates it. Whether you like it or not, marriage is subordinated to
virginity and widowhood. Even when marriage continues to fulfil its
function, the Church does not condemn it, but only subordinates it; it
does not reject it, but only regulates it. It is in your power, if you
will, to mount the second step of chastity. <span
id="fr_1113"></span>[1114](#fn_1113.md) Why are you angry if, standing on
the third and lowest step, you will not make haste to go up higher?

<span id="v.XLVIII-p92"></span>12. Since, then, I have so often reminded
my reader of my views; and since I have picked <span id="page_72">p.
72</span> <span id="v.XLVIII-Page_72"></span>my way like a prudent
traveller over every inch of the road, stating repeatedly that, while I
receive marriage as a thing in itself admissible, I yet prefer
continence, widowhood, and virginity, the wise and generous reader ought
to have judged what seemed hard sayings by my general drift, and not to
have charged me with putting forward inconsistent opinions in one and
the same book. For who is so dull or so inexperienced in writing as to
praise and to condemn one and the same object, as to destroy what he has
built up, and to build up what he has destroyed; and when he has
vanquished his opponent, to turn his sword, last of all against himself?
Were my detractors country bred or unacquainted with the arts of
rhetoric or of logic, I should pardon their want of insight; nor should
I censure them for accusing me if I saw that their ignorance was in
fault and not their will. As it is men of intellect who have enjoyed a
liberal education make it their object less to understand me than to
wound me, and for such I have this short answer, that they should
correct my faults and not merely censure me for them. The lists are
open, I cry; your enemy has marshalled his forces, his position is
plain, and (if I may quote Virgil <span
id="fr_1114"></span>[1115](#fn_1114) .md)—

<span id="v.XLVIII-p94"></span>The foeman calls you: meet him face to
face.

<span id="v.XLVIII-p95"></span>Such men should answer their opponent.
They ought to keep within the limits of debate, and not to wield the
schoolmaster’s rod. Their books should aim at showing in what my
statements have fallen short of the truth, and in what they have
exceeded it. For, although I will not listen to fault-finders, I will
follow the advice of teachers. To direct the fighter how to fight when
you yourself occupy a post of vantage on the wall is a kind of teaching
that does not commend itself; and when you are yourself bathed in
perfumes, it is unworthy to charge a bleeding soldier with cowardice.
Nor in saying this do I lay myself open to a charge of boasting that
while others have slept I only have entered the lists. My meaning simply
is that men who have seen me wounded in this warfare may possibly be a
little too cautious in their methods of fighting. I would not have you
engage in an encounter in which you will have nothing to do but to
protect yourself, your right hand remaining motionless while your left
manages your shield. You must either strike or fall. I cannot account
you a victor unless I see your opponent put to the sword.

<span id="v.XLVIII-p96"></span>13. You are, no doubt, men of vast
acquirements; but we too have studied in the schools, and, like you, we
have learned from the precepts of Aristotle—or, rather, from those which
he has derived from Gorgias—that there are different ways of speaking;
and we know, among other things, that he who writes for display uses one
style, and he who writes to convince, another. <span
id="fr_1115"></span>[1116](#fn_1115.md) In the former case the debate is
desultory; to confute the opposer, now this argument is adduced and now
that. One argues as one pleases, saying one thing while one means
another. To quote the proverb, “With one hand one offers bread, in the
other one holds a stone.” <span id="fr_1116"></span>[1117](#fn_1116.md) In
the latter case a certain frankness and openness of countenance are
necessary. For it is one thing to start a problem and another to expound
what is already proved. The first calls for a disputant, the second for
a teacher. I stand in the thick of the fray, my life in constant danger:
you who profess to teach me are a man of books. “Do not,” you say,
“attack unexpectedly or wound by a side-thrust. Strike straight at your
opponent. You should be ashamed to resort to feints instead of force.”
As if it were not the perfection of fighting to menace one part and to
strike another. Read, I beg of you, Demosthenes or Cicero, or (if you do
not care for pleaders whose aim is to speak plausibly rather than truly)
read Plato, Theophrastus, Xenophon, Aristotle, and the rest of those who
draw their respective rills of wisdom from the Socratic fountain-head.
Do they show any openness? Are they devoid of artifice? Is not every
word they say filled with meaning? And does not this meaning always make
for victory? Origen, Methodius, Eusebius, and Apollinaris <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[1118](#fn_1117.md) write at great length against
Celsus and Porphyry. <span id="fr_1118"></span>[1119](#fn_1118.md) Consider
how subtle are the arguments, how insidious the engines with which they
overthrow what the spirit of the devil has wrought. Sometimes, it is
true, they are compelled to say not what they think but what is needful;
and for this reason they employ against their opponents the assertions
of the Gentiles themselves. I say nothing of the Latin authors, of
Tertullian, Cyprian, Minutius, Victorinus, Lactantius, Hilary, lest I
should appear not so much to be defending myself as to be assailing
<span id="page_73">p. 73</span> <span
id="v.XLVIII-Page_73"></span>others. I will only mention the Apostle
Paul, whose words seem to me, as often as I hear them, to be not words,
but peals of thunder. Read his epistles, and especially those addressed
to the Romans, to the Galatians, and to the Ephesians, in all of which
he stands in the thick of the battle, and you will see how skilful and
how careful he is in the proofs which he draws from the Old Testament,
and how warily he cloaks the object which he has in view. His words seem
simplicity itself: the expressions of a guileless and unsophisticated
person—one who has no skill either to plan a dilemma or to avoid it.
Still, whichever way you look, they are thunderbolts. His pleading
halts, yet he carries every point which he takes up. He turns his back
upon his foe only to overcome him; he simulates flight, but only that he
may slay. He, then, if any one, ought to be calumniated; we should speak
thus to him: “The proofs which you have used against the Jews or against
other heretics bear a different meaning in their own contexts to that
which they bear in your epistles. We see passages taken captive by your
pen and pressed into service to win you a victory which in the volumes
from which they are taken have no controversial bearing at all.” May he
not reply to us in the words of the Saviour: “I have one mode of speech
for those that are without and another for those that are within; the
crowds hear my parables, but their interpretation is for my disciples
alone”? <span id="fr_1119"></span>[1120](#fn_1119.md) The Lord puts
questions to the Pharisees, but does not elucidate them. To teach a
disciple is one thing; to vanquish an opponent, another. “My mystery is
for me,” says the prophet; “my mystery is for me and for them that are
mine.” <span id="fr_1120"></span>[1121](#fn_1120.md)

<span id="v.XLVIII-p103"></span>14. You are indignant with me because I
have merely silenced Jovinian and not instructed him. You, do I say?
Nay, rather, they who grieve to hear him anathematized, and who impeach
their own pretended orthodoxy by eulogizing in another the heresy which
they hold themselves. I should have asked him, forsooth, to surrender
peaceably! I had no right to disregard his struggles and to drag him
against his will into the bonds of truth! I might use such language had
the desire of victory induced me to say anything counter to the rule
laid down in Scripture, and had I taken the line—so often adopted by
strong men in controversy—of justifying the means by the result. As it
is, however, I have been an exponent of the apostle rather than a
dogmatist on my own account; and my function has been simply that of a
commentator. Anything, therefore, which seems a hard saying should be
imputed to the writer expounded by me rather than to me the expounder;
unless, indeed, he spoke otherwise than he is represented to have done,
and I have by an unfair interpretation wrested the plain meaning of his
words. If any one charges me with this disingenuousness let him prove
his charge from the Scriptures themselves.

<span id="v.XLVIII-p104"></span>I have said in my book, <span
id="fr_1121"></span>[1122](#fn_1121.md) “If ‘it is good for a man not to
touch a woman,’ then it is bad for him to touch one, for bad, and bad
only, is the opposite of good. But, if though bad it is made venial,
then it is allowed to prevent something which would be worse than bad,”
and so on down to the commencement of the next chapter. The above is my
comment upon the apostle’s words: “It is good for a man not to touch a
woman. Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own
wife, and let every woman have her own husband.” <span
id="fr_1122"></span>[1123](#fn_1122.md) In what way does my meaning differ
from that intended by the apostle? Except that where he speaks decidedly
I do so with hesitation. He defines a dogma, I hazard an inquiry. He
openly says: “It is good for a man not to touch a woman.” I timidly ask
*if* it is good for a man not to touch one. If I thus waver, I cannot be
said to speak positively. He says: “It is good not to touch.” I add what
is a possible antithesis to “good.” And immediately afterwards I speak
thus: <span id="fr_1123"></span>[1124](#fn_1123.md) “Notice the apostle’s
carefulness. He does not say: ‘It is good for a man not to have a wife,’
but, ‘It is good for a man not to touch a woman’; as if there is danger
in the very touching of one—danger which he who touches cannot escape.”
You see, therefore, that I am not expounding the law as to husbands and
wives, but simply discussing the general question of sexual
intercourse—how in comparison with chastity and virginity, the life of
angels, “It is good for a man not to touch a woman.”

<span id="v.XLVIII-p108"></span>“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher,
“all is vanity.” <span id="fr_1124"></span>[1125](#fn_1124.md) But if all
created things are good, <span id="fr_1125"></span>[1126](#fn_1125.md) as
being the handiwork of a good Creator, how comes it that all things are
vanity? If the earth is vanity, are the heavens vanity too?—and the
angels, the thrones, the dominations, the powers, and the rest of the
virtues? <span id="fr_1126"></span>[1127](#fn_1126.md) No; if things which
are <span id="page_74">p. 74</span> <span
id="v.XLVIII-Page_74"></span>good in themselves as being the handiwork
of a good Creator are called vanity, it is because they are compared
with things which are better still. For example, compared with a lamp, a
lantern is good for nothing; compared with a star, a lamp does not shine
at all; the brightest star pales before the moon; put the moon beside
the sun, and it no longer looks bright; compare the sun with Christ, and
it is darkness. “I am that I am,” God says; <span
id="fr_1127"></span>[1128](#fn_1127.md) and if you compare all created
things with Him they have no existence. “Give not thy sceptre,” says
Esther, “unto them that be nothing” <span
id="fr_1128"></span>[1129](#fn_1128.md) —that is to say, to idols and
demons. And certainly they were idols and demons to whom she prayed that
she and hers might not be given over. In Job also we read how Bildad
says of the wicked man: “His confidence shall be rooted out of his
tabernacle, and destruction as a king shall trample upon him. The
companions also of him who is not shall abide in his tabernacle.” <span
id="fr_1129"></span>[1130](#fn_1129.md) This evidently relates to the
devil, who must be in existence, otherwise he could not be said to have
companions. Still, because he is lost to God, he is said not to be.

<span id="v.XLVIII-p115"></span>Now it was in a similar sense that I
declared it to be a bad thing to touch a woman—I did not say a
wife—because it is a good thing not to touch one. And I added: <span
id="fr_1130"></span>[1131](#fn_1130.md) “I call virginity fine corn,
wedlock barley, and fornication cow-dung.” Surely both corn and barley
are creatures of God. But of the two multitudes miraculously supplied in
the Gospel the larger was fed upon barley loaves, and the smaller on
corn bread. <span id="fr_1131"></span>[1132](#fn_1131.md) “Thou, Lord,”
says the psalmist, “shalt save both man and beast.” <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[1133](#fn_1132.md) I have myself said the same thing
in other words, when I have spoken of virginity as gold and of wedlock
as silver. <span id="fr_1133"></span>[1134](#fn_1133.md) Again, in
discussing <span id="fr_1134"></span>[1135](#fn_1134.md) the one hundred
and forty-four thousand sealed virgins who were not defiled with
women, <span id="fr_1135"></span>[1136](#fn_1135.md) I have tried to show
that all who have not remained virgins are reckoned as defiled when
compared with the perfect chastity of the angels and of our Lord Jesus
Christ. But if any one thinks it hard or reprehensible that I have
placed the same interval between virginity and wedlock as there is
between fine corn and barley, let him read the book of the holy Ambrose
“On Widows,” and he will find, among other statements concerning
virginity and marriage, the following: <span
id="fr_1136"></span>[1137](#fn_1136.md) “The apostle has not expressed his
preference for marriage so unreservedly as to quench in men the
aspiration after virginity; he commences with a recommendation of
continence, and it is only subsequently that he stoops to mention the
remedies for its opposite. And although to the strong he has pointed out
the prize of their high calling, <span
id="fr_1137"></span>[1138](#fn_1137.md) yet he suffers none to faint by the
way; <span id="fr_1138"></span>[1139](#fn_1138.md) whilst he applauds those
who lead the van, he does not despise those who bring up the rear. For
he had himself learned that the Lord Jesus gave to some barley bread,
lest they should faint by the way, but offered to others His own body,
that they should strive to attain His kingdom;” <span
id="fr_1139"></span>[1140](#fn_1139.md) and immediately afterwards: “The
nuptial tie, then, is not to be avoided as a crime, but to be refused as
a hard burden. For the law binds the wife to bring forth children in
labor and in sorrow. Her desire is to be to her husband that he should
rule over her. <span id="fr_1140"></span>[1141](#fn_1140.md) It is not the
widow, then, but the bride, who is handed over to labor and sorrow in
childbearing. It is not the virgin, but the married woman, who is
subjected to the sway of a husband.” And in another place, “Ye are
bought,” says the apostle, “with a price; <span
id="fr_1141"></span>[1142](#fn_1141.md) be not therefore the servants of
men.” <span id="fr_1142"></span>[1143](#fn_1142.md) You see how clearly he
defines the servitude which attends the married state. And a little
farther on: “If, then, even a good marriage is servitude, what must a
bad one be, in which husband and wife cannot sanctify, but only mutually
destroy each other?” What I have said about virginity and marriage
diffusely, Ambrose has stated tersely and pointedly, compressing much
meaning into a few words. Virginity is described by him as a means of
recommending continence, marriage as a remedy for incontinence. And when
he descends from broad principles to particular details, he
significantly holds out to virgins the prize of the high calling, yet
comforts the married, that they may not faint by the way. While
eulogizing the one class, he does not despise the other. Marriage he
compares to the barley bread set before the multitude, virginity to the
body of Christ given to the disciples. There is much less difference, it
seems to me, between barley and fine corn than between barley and the
body of Christ. Finally, he speaks of marriage as a hard burden, to be
avoided if possible, and as a badge of the most unmistakable servi<span
id="page_75">p. 75</span> <span id="v.XLVIII-Page_75"></span>tude. He
makes, also, many other statements, which he has followed up at length
in his three books “On Virgins.”

<span id="v.XLVIII-p129"></span>15. From all which considerations it is
clear that I have said nothing at all new concerning virginity and
marriage, but have followed in all respects the judgment of older
writers—of Ambrose, that is to say, and others who have discussed the
doctrines of the Church. “And I would sooner follow them in their faults
than copy the dull pedantry of the writers of to-day.” <span
id="fr_1143"></span>[1144](#fn_1143.md) Let married men, if they please,
swell with rage because I have said, <span
id="fr_1144"></span>[1145](#fn_1144.md) “I ask you, what kind of good thing
is that which forbids a man to pray, and which prevents him from
receiving the body of Christ?” When I do my duty as a husband, I cannot
fulfil the requirements of continence. The same apostle, in another
place, commands us to pray always. <span
id="fr_1145"></span>[1146](#fn_1145.md) “But if we are always to pray we
must never yield to the claims of wedlock for, as often as I render her
due to my wife, I incapacitate myself for prayer.” When I spoke thus it
is clear that I relied on the words of the apostle: “Defraud ye not one
the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give
yourselves to…prayer.” <span id="fr_1146"></span>[1147](#fn_1146.md) The
Apostle Paul tells us that when we have intercourse with our wives we
cannot pray. If, then, sexual intercourse prevents what is less
important—that is, prayer—how much more does it prevent what is more
important—that is, the reception of the body of Christ? Peter, too,
exhorts us to continence, that our “prayers be not hindered.” <span
id="fr_1147"></span>[1148](#fn_1147.md) How, I should like to know, have I
sinned in all this? What have I done? How have I been in fault? If the
waters of a stream are thick and muddy, it is not the river-bed which is
to blame, but the source. Am I attacked because I have ventured to add
to the words of the apostle these words of my own: “What kind of good
thing is that which prevents a man from receiving the body of Christ?”
If so, I will make answer briefly thus: Which is the more important, to
pray or to receive Christ’s body? Surely to receive Christ’s body. If,
then, sexual intercourse hinders the less important thing, much more
does it hinder that which is the more important.

<span id="v.XLVIII-p135"></span>I have said in the same treatise <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[1149](#fn_1148.md) that David and they that were with
him could not have lawfully eaten the shew-bread had they not made
answer that for three days they had not been defiled with women <span
id="fr_1149"></span>[1150](#fn_1149.md) —not, of course, with harlots,
intercourse with whom was forbidden by the law, but with their own
wives, to whom they were lawfully united. Moreover, when the people were
about to receive the law on Mount Sinai they were commanded to keep away
from their wives for three days. <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[1151](#fn_1150.md) I know that at Rome it is customary
for the faithful always to receive the body of Christ, a custom which I
neither censure nor indorse. “Let every man be fully persuaded in his
own mind.” <span id="fr_1151"></span>[1152](#fn_1151.md) But I appeal to
the consciences of those persons who after indulging in sexual
intercourse on the same day receive the communion—having first, as
Persius puts it, “washed off the night in a flowing stream,” <span
id="fr_1152"></span>[1153](#fn_1152.md) and I ask such why they do not
presume to approach the martyrs or to enter the churches. <span
id="fr_1153"></span>[1154](#fn_1153.md) Is Christ of one mind abroad and of
another at home? What is unlawful in church cannot be lawful at home.
Nothing is hidden from God. “The night shineth as the day” before
Him. <span id="fr_1154"></span>[1155](#fn_1154.md) Let each man examine
himself, and so let him approach the body of Christ. <span
id="fr_1155"></span>[1156](#fn_1155.md) Not, of course, that the deferring
of communion for one day or for two makes a Christian any the holier or
that what I have not deserved to-day I shall deserve to-morrow or the
day after. But if I grieve that I have not shared in Christ’s body it
does help me to avoid for a little while my wife’s embraces, and to
prefer to wedded love the love of Christ. A hard discipline, you will
say, and one not to be borne. What man of the world could bear it? He
that can bear it, I reply, let him bear it; <span
id="fr_1156"></span>[1157](#fn_1156.md) he that cannot must look to
himself. It is my business to say, not what each man can do or will do,
but what the Scriptures inculcate.

<span id="v.XLVIII-p145"></span>16. Again, objection has been taken to
my comments on the apostle in the following passage: <span
id="fr_1157"></span>[1158](#fn_1157.md) “But lest any should suppose from
the context of the words before quoted (namely, ‘that ye may give
yourselves…to prayer and come together again’) that <span
id="page_76">p. 76</span> <span id="v.XLVIII-Page_76"></span>the apostle
desires this consummation, and does not merely concede it to obviate a
worse downfall, he immediately adds, ‘that Satan tempt you not for your
incontinency.’ <span id="fr_1158"></span>[1159](#fn_1158.md) ‘And come
together again.’ What a noble indulgence the words convey! One which he
blushes to speak of in plainer words, which he prefers only to Satan’s
temptation, and which has its root in incontinence. Do we labor to
expound this as a dark saying when the writer has himself explained his
meaning? “I speak this,” he says, ‘by way of permission, and not as a
command.’ <span id="fr_1159"></span>[1160](#fn_1159.md) Do we still
hesitate to speak of wedlock as a thing permitted instead of as a thing
enjoined? or are we afraid that such permission will exclude second or
third marriages or some other case?” What have I said here which the
apostle has not said? The phrase, I suppose, “which he blushes to speak
of in plainer words.” I imagine that when he says “come together,” and
does not mention for what, he takes a modest way of indicating what he
does not like to name openly—that is, sexual intercourse. Or is the
objection to the words which follow—“which he prefers only to Satan’s
temptation, and which has its root in incontinence”? Are they not the
very words of the apostle, only differently arranged—“that Satan tempt
you not for your incontinency”? Or do people cavil because I said, “Do
we still hesitate to speak of wedlock as a thing permitted instead of as
a thing enjoined?” If this seems a hard saying, it should be ascribed to
the apostle, who says, “But I speak this by way of permission, and not
as a command,” and not to me, who, except that I have rearranged their
order, have changed neither the words nor their meaning.

<span id="v.XLVIII-p149"></span>17. The shortness of a letter compels me
to hasten on. I pass, accordingly, to the points which remain. “I say,”
remarks the apostle, “to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them
if they abide even as I. But if they cannot contain, let them marry; for
it is better to marry than to burn.” <span
id="fr_1160"></span>[1161](#fn_1160.md) This section I have interpreted
thus: <span id="fr_1161"></span>[1162](#fn_1161.md) “When he has granted to
those who are married the use of wedlock, and has made clear his own
wishes and concessions, he passes on to those who are unmarried or
widows, and sets before them his own example. He calls them happy if
they abide even as he, <span id="fr_1162"></span>[1163](#fn_1162.md) but he
goes on, ‘if they cannot contain, let them marry.’ He thus repeats his
former language, ‘but only to avoid fornication,’ and ‘that Satan tempt
you not for your incontinence.’ And when he says, ‘If they cannot
contain, let them marry,’ he gives as a reason for his words that ‘it is
better to marry than to burn.’ It is only good to marry, because it is
bad to burn. But take away the fire of lust, and he will not say ‘it is
better to marry.’ For a thing is said to be better in antithesis to
something which is worse, and not simply in contrast with what is
admittedly good. It is as though he said, ‘It is better to have one eye
than none.’” Shortly afterwards, apostrophizing the apostle, I spoke
thus: <span id="fr_1163"></span>[1164](#fn_1163.md) “If marriage is good in
itself, do not compare it with a conflagration, but simply say, ‘It is
good to marry.’ I must suspect the goodness of a thing which only
becomes a lesser evil in the presence of a greater one. I, for my part,
would have it not a lighter evil but a downright good.” The apostle
wishes unmarried women and widows to abstain from sexual intercourse,
incites them to follow his own example, and calls them happy if they
abide even as he. But if they cannot contain, and are tempted to quench
the fire of lust by fornication rather than by continence, it is better,
he tells them, to marry than to burn. Upon which precept I have made
this comment: “It is good to marry, simply because it is bad to burn,”
not putting forward a view of my own, but only explaining the apostle’s
precept, “It is better to marry than to burn;” that is, it is better to
take a husband than to commit fornication. If, then, you teach that
burning or fornication is good, the good will still be surpassed by what
is still better. <span id="fr_1164"></span>[1165](#fn_1164.md) But if
marriage is only a degree better than the evil to which it is preferred,
it cannot be of that unblemished perfection and blessedness which
suggest a comparison with the life of angels. Suppose I say, “It is
better to be a virgin than a married woman;” in this case I have
preferred to what is good what is still better. But suppose I go a step
further and say, “It is better to marry than to commit fornication;” in
that case I have preferred, not a better thing to a good thing, but a
good thing to a bad one. There is a wide difference between the two
cases; for, while virginity is related to marriage as better is to good,
marriage is related to fornication as good is to bad. How, I should like
to know, have I sinned in this explanation? My fixed purpose was not to
bend the Scriptures to my own wishes, but simply to <span
id="page_77">p. 77</span> <span id="v.XLVIII-Page_77"></span>say what I
took to be their meaning. A commentator has no business to dilate on his
own views; his duty is to make plain the meaning of the author whom he
professes to interpret. For, if he contradicts the writer whom he is
trying to expound, he will prove to be his opponent rather than his
interpreter. When I am freely expressing my own opinion, and not
commenting upon the Scriptures, then any one that pleases may charge me
with having spoken hardly of marriage. But if he can find no ground for
such a charge, he should attribute such passages in my commentaries as
appear severe or harsh to the author commented on, and not to me, who am
only his interpreter.

<span id="v.XLVIII-p155"></span>18. Another charge brought against me is
simply intolerable! It is urged that in explaining the apostle’s words
concerning husbands and wives, “Such shall have trouble in the flesh,” I
have said: <span id="fr_1165"></span>[1166](#fn_1165.md) “We in our
ignorance had supposed that in the flesh at least wedlock would have
rejoicing. But if married persons are to have trouble in the flesh, the
only thing in which they seemed likely to have pleasure, what motive
will be left to make women marry? for, besides having trouble in spirit
and soul, they will also have it even in the flesh.” <span
id="fr_1166"></span>[1167](#fn_1166.md) Do I condemn marriage if I
enumerate its troubles, such as the crying of infants, the death of
children, the chance of abortion, domestic losses, and so forth? Whilst
Damasus of holy memory was still living, I wrote a book against
Helvidius “On the Perpetual Virginity of the Blessed Mary,” in which,
duly to extol the bliss of virginity, I was forced to say much of the
troubles of marriage. Did that excellent man—versed in Scripture as he
was, and a virgin doctor of the virgin Church—find anything to censure
in my discourse? Moreover, in the treatise which I addressed to
Eustochium <span id="fr_1167"></span>[1168](#fn_1167.md) I used much
harsher language regarding marriage, and yet no one was offended at it.
Nay, every lover of chastity strained his ears to catch my eulogy of
continence. Read Tertullian, read Cyprian, read Ambrose, and either
accuse me with them or acquit me with them. My critics resemble the
characters of Plautus. Their only wit lies in detraction; and they try
to make themselves out men of learning by assailing all parties in turn.
Thus they bestow their censure impartially upon myself and upon my
opponent, and maintain that we are both beaten, although one or other of
us must have succeeded.

<span id="v.XLVIII-p159"></span>Moreover, when in discussing digamy and
trigamy I have said, <span id="fr_1168"></span>[1169](#fn_1168.md) “It is
better for a woman to know one man, even though he be a second husband
or a third, than several; it is more tolerable for her to prostitute
herself to one man than to many,” have I not immediately subjoined my
reason for so saying? “The Samaritan woman in the Gospel, when she
declares that her present husband is her sixth, is rebuked by the Lord
on the ground that he is not her husband.” <span
id="fr_1169"></span>[1170](#fn_1169.md) For my own part, I now once more
freely proclaim that digamy is not condemned in the Church—no, nor yet
trigamy—and that a woman may marry a fifth husband, or a sixth, or a
greater number still just as lawfully as she may marry a second; but
that, while such marriages are not condemned, neither are they
commended. They are meant as alleviations of an unhappy lot, and in no
way redound to the glory of continence. I have spoken to the same effect
elsewhere. <span id="fr_1170"></span>[1171](#fn_1170.md) “When a woman
marries more than once—whether she does so twice or three times matters
little—she ceases to be a monogamist. ‘All things are lawful…but all
things are not expedient.’ <span id="fr_1171"></span>[1172](#fn_1171.md) I
do not condemn digamists or trigamists, or even, to put an impossible
case, octogamists. Let a woman have an eighth husband if she must; only
let her cease to prostitute herself.”

<span id="v.XLVIII-p164"></span>19. I will come now to the passage in
which I am accused of saying that—at least according to the true Hebrew
text—the words “God saw that it was good” <span
id="fr_1172"></span>[1173](#fn_1172.md) are not inserted after the second
day of the creation, as they are after the first, third, and remaining
ones, and of adding immediately the following comment: <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[1174](#fn_1173.md) “We are meant to understand that
there is something not good in the number two, separating us as it does
from unity, and prefiguring the marriage-tie. Just as in the account of
Noah’s ark all the animals that enter by twos are unclean, but those of
which an uneven number is taken are clean.” <span
id="fr_1174"></span>[1175](#fn_1174.md) In this statement a passing
objection is made to what I have said concerning the second day, whether
on the ground that the words mentioned really occur in the passage,
although I say that they do not occur, or because, assuming them to
occur, I have understood them in a sense different from that which the
context evidently requires. As regards the non-occurrence of the words
in question (viz., “God saw that it was good”), let them take not my
evidence, but that of all the Jew<span id="page_78">p. 78</span> <span
id="v.XLVIII-Page_78"></span>ish and other translators—Aquila <span
id="fr_1175"></span>[1176](#fn_1175.md) namely, Symmachus, <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[1177](#fn_1176.md) and Theodotion. <span
id="fr_1177"></span>[1178](#fn_1177.md) But if the words, although
occurring in the account of the other days, do not occur in the account
of this, either let them give a more plausible reason than I have done
for their non-occurrence, or, failing such, let them, whether they like
it or not, accept the suggestion which I have made. Furthermore, if in
Noah’s ark all the animals that enter by twos are unclean, whilst those
of which an uneven number is taken are clean, and if there is no dispute
about the accuracy of the text, let them explain if they can why it is
so written. But if they cannot explain it, then, whether they will or
not, they must embrace my explanation of the matter. Either produce
better fare and ask me to be your guest, or else rest content with the
meal that I offer you, however poor it may be. <span
id="fr_1178"></span>[1179](#fn_1178.md)

<span id="v.XLVIII-p172"></span>I must now mention the ecclesiastical
writers who have dealt with this question of the odd number. They are,
among the Greeks, Clement, Hippolytus, Origen, Dionysius, Eusebius,
Didymus; and, among ourselves, Tertullian, Cyprian, Victorinus,
Lactantius, Hilary. What Cyprian said to Fortunatus about the number
seven is clear from the letter which he sent to him. <span
id="fr_1179"></span>[1180](#fn_1179.md) Or perhaps I ought to bring forward
the reasonings of Pythagoras, Archytas of Tarentum, and Publius Scipio
in (Cicero’s) sixth book “Concerning the Common Weal.” If my detractors
will not listen to any of these I will make the grammar schools shout in
their ears the words of Virgil:

<span id="v.XLVIII-p174"></span>Uneven numbers are the joy of God. <span
id="fr_1180"></span>[1181](#fn_1180.md)

<span id="v.XLVIII-p176"></span>20. To say, as I have done, that
virginity is cleaner than wedlock, that the even numbers must give way
to the odd, that the types of the Old Testament establish the truth of
the Gospel: this, it appears, is a great sin subversive of the churches
and intolerable to the world. The remaining points which are censured in
my treatise are, I take it, of less importance, or else resolve
themselves into this. I have, therefore, refrained from answering them,
both that I may not exceed the limit at my disposal, and that I may not
seem to distrust your intelligence, knowing as I do that you are ready
to be my champion even before I ask you. With my last breath, then, I
protest that neither now nor at any former time have I condemned
marriage. I have merely answered an opponent without any fear that they
of my own party would lay snares for me. I extol virginity to the skies,
not because I myself possess it, but because, not possessing it, I
admire it all the more. Surely it is a modest and ingenuous confession
to praise in others that which you lack yourself. The weight of my body
keeps me fixed to the ground, but do I fail to admire the flying birds
or to praise the dove because, in the words of Virgil, <span
id="fr_1181"></span>[1182](#fn_1181.md) it

<span id="v.XLVIII-p178"></span>Glides on its liquid path with
motionless swift wings?

<span id="v.XLVIII-p179"></span>Let no man deceive himself, let no man,
giving ear to the voice of flattery, rush upon ruin. The first virginity
man derives from his birth, the second from his second birth. <span
id="fr_1182"></span>[1183](#fn_1182.md) The words are not mine; it is an
old saying, “No man can serve two masters;” <span
id="fr_1183"></span>[1184](#fn_1183.md) that is, the flesh and the spirit.
For “the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the
flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other,” so that we cannot
do the things that we would. <span id="fr_1184"></span>[1185](#fn_1184.md)
When, then, anything in my little work seems to you harsh, have regard
not to my words, but to the Scripture, whence they are taken.

<span id="v.XLVIII-p183"></span>21. Christ Himself is a virgin; <span
id="fr_1185"></span>[1186](#fn_1185.md) and His mother is also a virgin;
yea, though she is His mother, she is a virgin still. For Jesus has
entered in through the closed doors, <span
id="fr_1186"></span>[1187](#fn_1186.md) and in His sepulchre—a new one hewn
out of the hardest rock—no man is laid either before Him or after
Him. <span id="fr_1187"></span>[1188](#fn_1187.md) Mary is “a garden
enclosed…a fountain sealed,” <span id="fr_1188"></span>[1189](#fn_1188.md)
and from that fountain flows, according to Joel, <span
id="fr_1189"></span>[1190](#fn_1189.md) the river which waters the torrent
bed either <span id="fr_1190"></span>[1191](#fn_1190.md) of cords or of
thorns; <span id="fr_1191"></span>[1192](#fn_1191.md) of cords being those
of the sins by which we were beforetime bound, <span
id="fr_1192"></span>[1193](#fn_1192.md) the thorns those which choked the
seed the goodman of the house had sown. <span
id="fr_1193"></span>[1194](#fn_1193.md) She is the east gate, spoken of by
the prophet Ezekiel, <span id="fr_1194"></span>[1195](#fn_1194.md) always
shut and always shining, and either concealing or revealing the Holy of
Holies; and through her “the Sun of Righteousness,” <span
id="fr_1195"></span>[1196](#fn_1195.md) our “high priest after the order of
Melchizedek,” <span id="fr_1196"></span>[1197](#fn_1196.md) goes in and
out. Let my critics explain to me how Jesus can have entered in through
closed doors when He allowed His hands and His side to be handled, and
showed that He had bones and flesh, <span
id="fr_1197"></span>[1198](#fn_1197.md) thus proving that His was a true
body and no <span id="page_79">p. 79</span> <span
id="v.XLVIII-Page_79"></span>mere phantom of one, and I will explain how
the holy Mary can be at once a mother and a virgin. A mother before she
was wedded, she remained a virgin after bearing her son. Therefore, as I
was going to say, the virgin Christ and the virgin Mary have dedicated
in themselves the first fruits of virginity for both sexes. <span
id="fr_1198"></span>[1199](#fn_1198.md) The apostles have either been
virgins or, though married, have lived celibate lives. Those persons who
are chosen to be bishops, priests, and deacons are either virgins or
widowers; or at least when once they have received the priesthood, are
vowed to perpetual chastity. Why do we delude ourselves and feel vexed
if while we are continually straining after sexual indulgence, we find
the palm of chastity denied to us? We wish to fare sumptuously, and to
enjoy the embraces of our wives, yet at the same time we desire to reign
with Christ among virgins and widows. Shall there be but one reward,
then, for hunger and for excess, for filth and for finery, for sackcloth
and for silk? Lazarus, <span id="fr_1199"></span>[1200](#fn_1199.md) in his
lifetime, received evil things, and the rich man, clothed in purple, fat
and sleek, while he lived enjoyed the good things of the flesh but, now
that they are dead, they occupy different positions. Misery has given
place to satisfaction, and satisfaction to misery. And it rests with us
whether we will follow Lazarus or the rich man.

<span id="v.XLVIII-p141"></span> That what is now known as reservation
of the elements was practised in the early church there is abundant
evidence to show. Justin Martyr (Apol. I. 65) writes: “The deacons
communicate each of those present and carry away to the absent of the
blest bread and wine and water.” And those to whom the eucharist was
thus taken were not bound to consume it immediately, or all at once, but
might reserve a part or all for future occasions. According to Basil
(Ep. 93<span id="v.XLVIII-p141.1"></span>), “in Egypt the laity for the
most part had every one the communion in their own houses”—and “all
those who dwell alone in the desert, when there is no priest, keep the
communion at home and receive it at their own hands.” So Jerome speaks
(Letter CXXV. 20) of Exuperius as “carrying the Lord’s body in a wicker
basket, His blood in a vessel of glass.” See the article “Reservation”
in Smith and Cheetham’s Dict. of Christian Antiquities.
