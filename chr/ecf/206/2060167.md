<span id="vi.v-p1"></span> <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.v-p1.1"></span>The Perpetual Virginity of Blessed Mary.</span>

<span id="vi.v-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="vi.v-p3"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="vi.v-p3.1"></span>Against Helvidius.</span>

<span id="vi.v-p4"></span>This tract appeared about <span
class="c17"><span id="vi.v-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span> 383. The question
which gave occasion to it was whether the Mother of our Lord remained a
Virgin after His birth. Helvidius maintained that the mention in the
Gospels of the “sisters” and “brethren” of our Lord was proof that the
Blessed Virgin had subsequent issue, and he supported his opinion by the
writings of Tertullian and Victorinus. The outcome of his views was that
virginity was ranked below matrimony. Jerome vigorously takes the other
side, and tries to prove that the “sisters” and “brethren” spoken of,
were either children of Joseph by a former marriage, or first cousins,
children of the sister of the Virgin. A detailed account of the
controversy will be found in Farrar’s “Early Days of Christianity,” pp.
124 sq. When Jerome wrote this treatise both he and Helvidius were at
Rome, and Damasus was Pope. The only contemporary notice preserved of
Helvidius is that by Jerome in the following pages.

<span id="vi.v-p5"></span>Jerome maintains against Helvidius three
propositions:—

<span id="vi.v-p6"></span>1st. That Joseph was only putatively, not
really, the husband of Mary.

<span id="vi.v-p7"></span>2d. That the “brethren” of the Lord were his
cousins, not his own brethren.

<span id="vi.v-p8"></span>3d. That virginity is better than the married
state.

<span id="vi.v-p9"></span>1. The first of these occupies ch. 3–8. It
turns upon the record in [Matt. i.
18-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018.md)<span id="vi.v-p9.1"></span>, and
especially on the words, “Before they came together” (c. 4), “knew her
not till, &c.” (5–8).

<span id="vi.v-p10"></span>2. The second (c. 9–17) turns upon the words
“first-born son” (9, 10), which, Jerome argues, are applicable not only
to the eldest of several, but also to an only son: and the mention of
brothers and sisters, whom Jerome asserts to have been children of Mary
the wife of Cleophas or Clopas (11–16); he appeals to many Church
writers in support of this view (17).

<span id="vi.v-p11"></span><span id="page_335">p. 335</span> <span
id="vi.v-Page_335"></span>3. In support of his preference of virginity
to marriage, Jerome argues that not only Mary but Joseph also remained
in the virgin state (19); that, though marriage may sometimes be a holy
estate, it presents great hindrances to prayer (20), and the teaching of
Scripture is that the states of virginity and continency are more
accordant with God’s will than that of marriage (21, 22).

<span id="vi.v-p12"></span>1. I was requested by certain of the brethren
not long ago to reply to a pamphlet written by one Helvidius. I have
deferred doing so, not because it is a difficult matter to maintain the
truth and refute an ignorant boor who has scarce known the first glimmer
of learning, but because I was afraid my reply might make him appear
worth defeating. There was the further consideration that a turbulent
fellow, the only individual in the world who thinks himself both priest
and layman, one who, <span id="fr_4167"></span>[4168](#fn_4167.md) as has
been said, thinks that eloquence consists in loquacity and considers
speaking ill of anyone to be the witness of a good conscience, would
begin to blaspheme worse than ever if opportunity of discussion were
afforded him. He would stand as it were on a pedestal, and would publish
his views far and wide. There was reason also to fear that when truth
failed him he would assail his opponents with the weapon of abuse. But
all these motives for silence, though just, have more justly ceased to
influence me, because of the scandal caused to the brethren who were
disgusted at his ravings. The axe of the Gospel must therefore be now
laid to the root of the barren tree, and both it and its fruitless
foliage cast into the fire, so that Helvidius who has never learnt to
speak, may at length learn to hold his tongue.

<span id="vi.v-p14"></span>2. I must call upon the Holy Spirit to
express His meaning by my mouth and defend the virginity of the Blessed
Mary. I must call upon the Lord Jesus to guard the sacred lodging of the
womb in which He abode for ten months from all suspicion of sexual
intercourse. And I must also entreat God the Father to show that the
mother of His Son, who was a mother before she was a bride, continued a
Virgin after her son was born. We have no desire to career over the
fields of eloquence, we do not resort to the snares of the logicians or
the thickets of Aristotle. We shall adduce the actual words of
Scripture. Let him be refuted by the same proofs which he employed
against us, so that he may see that it was possible for him to read what
is written, and yet to be unable to discern the established conclusion
of a sound faith.

<span id="vi.v-p15"></span>3. His first statement was: “Matthew
says, <span id="fr_4168"></span>[4169](#fn_4168.md) Now the birth of Jesus
Christ was on this wise: When his mother Mary had been betrothed to
Joseph, before they came together she was found with child of the Holy
Ghost. And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to
make her a public example, was minded to put her away privately. But
when he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared
unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take
unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the
Holy Ghost.” Notice, he says, that the word used is *betrothed*, not
*intrusted* as you say, and of course the only reason why she was
betrothed was that she might one day be married. And the Evangelist
would not have said *before they came together* if they were not to come
together, for no one would use the phrase *before he dined* of a man who
was not going to dine. Then, again, the angel calls her *wife* and
speaks of her as *united* to Joseph. We are next invited to listen to
the declaration of Scripture: <span id="fr_4169"></span>[4170](#fn_4169.md)
“And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord
commanded him, and took unto him his wife; and knew her not till she had
brought forth her son.”

<span id="vi.v-p18"></span>4. Let us take the points one by one, and
follow the tracks of this impiety that we may show that he has
contradicted himself. He admits that she was betrothed, and in the next
breath will have her to be a man’s wife whom he has admitted to be his
betrothed. Again, he calls her wife, and then says the only reason why
she was betrothed was that she might one day be married. And, for fear
we might not think that enough, “the word used,” he says, “is
*betrothed* and not *intrusted,* that is to say, not yet a wife, not yet
united by the bond of wedlock.” But when he continues, “the Evangelist
would never have applied the words, *before they came together* to
persons who were not to come together, any more than one says, before he
dined, when the man is not going to dine,” I know not whether to grieve
or laugh. Shall I convict him of ignorance, or accuse him of rashness?
Just as if, supposing a person to say, “Before dining in harbour I
sailed to Africa,” his words could not hold good unless he were
compelled some day to dine in harbour. If I choose to say, “the apostle
Paul before he went to Spain was put in fetters at Rome,” or (as I
certainly might) “Helvidius, before he repented, was cut off by death,”
must Paul on being released at once go to Spain, or must Helvidius
repent after death, although the Scripture says <span
id="fr_4170"></span>[4171](#fn_4170.md) “In sheol who shall give thee
thanks?” Must we not rather understand <span id="page_336">p. 336</span>
<span id="vi.v-Page_336"></span>that the preposition *before,* although
it frequently denotes order in time, yet sometimes refers only to order
in thought? So that there is no necessity, if sufficient cause
intervened to prevent it, for our thoughts to be realized. When, then,
the Evangelist says *before they came together*, he indicates the time
immediately preceding marriage, and shows that matters were so far
advanced that she who had been betrothed was on the point of becoming a
wife. As though he said, before they kissed and embraced, before the
consummation of marriage, she was found to be with child. And she was
found to be so by none other than Joseph, who watched the swelling womb
of his betrothed with the anxious glances, and, at this time, almost the
privilege, of a husband. Yet it does not follow, as the previous
examples showed, that he had intercourse with Mary after her delivery,
when his desires had been quenched by the fact that she had already
conceived. And although we find it said to Joseph in a dream, “Fear not
to take Mary thy wife”; and again, “Joseph arose from his sleep, and did
as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto him his wife,” no
one ought to be disturbed by this, as though, inasmuch as she is called
*wife,* she ceases to be *betrothed,* for we know it is usual in
Scripture to give the title to those who are betrothed. The following
evidence from Deuteronomy establishes the point. <span
id="fr_4171"></span>[4172](#fn_4171.md) “If the man,” says the writer,
“find the damsel that is betrothed in the field, and the man force her,
and lie with her, he shall surely die, because he hath humbled his
neighbour’s wife.” And in another place, <span
id="fr_4172"></span>[4173](#fn_4172.md) “If there be a damsel that is a
virgin betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and
lie with her; then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that
city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel,
because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath
humbled his neighbour’s wife: so thou shalt put away the evil from the
midst of thee.” Elsewhere also, <span
id="fr_4173"></span>[4174](#fn_4173.md) “And what man is there that hath
betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his
house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.” But if
anyone feels a doubt as to why the Virgin conceived after she was
betrothed rather than when she had no one betrothed to her, or, to use
the Scripture phrase, no husband, let me explain that there were three
reasons. First, that by the genealogy of Joseph, whose kinswoman Mary
was, Mary’s origin might also be shown. Secondly, that she might not in
accordance with the law of Moses be stoned as an adulteress. Thirdly,
that in her flight to Egypt she might have some solace, though it was
that of a guardian rather than a husband. For who at that time would
have believed the Virgin’s word that she had conceived of the Holy
Ghost, and that the angel Gabriel had come and announced the purpose of
God? and would not all have given their opinion against her as an
adulteress, like Susanna? for at the present day, now that the whole
world has embraced the faith, the Jews argue that when Isaiah
says, <span id="fr_4174"></span>[4175](#fn_4174.md) “Behold, a virgin shall
conceive and bear a son,” the Hebrew word denotes a young woman, not a
virgin, that is to say, the word is <span class="c17"><span
id="vi.v-p23.2"></span>Almah</span>, not <span class="c17"><span
id="vi.v-p23.3"></span>Bethulah</span>, a position which, farther on, we
shall dispute more in detail. Lastly, excepting Joseph, and Elizabeth,
and Mary herself, and some few others who, we may suppose, heard the
truth from them, all considered Jesus to be the son of Joseph. And so
far was this the case that even the Evangelists, expressing the
prevailing opinion, which is the correct rule for a historian, call him
the father of the Saviour, as, for instance, <span
id="fr_4175"></span>[4176](#fn_4175) “And he (that is, Simeon.md) came in
the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child
Jesus, that they might do concerning him after the custom of the law;”
and elsewhere, <span id="fr_4176"></span>[4177](#fn_4176.md) “And his
parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.” And
afterwards, <span id="fr_4177"></span>[4178](#fn_4177.md) “And when they
had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus tarried
behind in Jerusalem; and his parents knew not of it.” Observe also what
Mary herself, who had replied to Gabriel with the words, <span
id="fr_4178"></span>[4179](#fn_4178.md) “How shall this be, seeing I know
not a man?” says concerning Joseph, <span
id="fr_4179"></span>[4180](#fn_4179.md) “Son, why hast thou thus dealt with
us? behold, thy father and I sought thee sorrowing.” We have not here,
as many maintain, the utterance of Jews or of mockers. The Evangelists
call Joseph father: Mary confesses he was father. Not (as I said before)
that Joseph was really the father of the Saviour: but that, to preserve
the reputation of Mary, he was regarded by all as his father, although,
before he heard the admonition of the angel, <span
id="fr_4180"></span>[4181](#fn_4180.md) “Joseph, thou son of David, fear
not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her
is of the Holy Ghost,” he had thoughts of putting her away privily;
which shows that he well knew that the child conceived was not his. But
we have said enough, more with the aim of imparting instruction than of
answering an opponent, to show why Joseph is called the father of our
Lord, and why Mary is called Joseph’s wife. This also <span
id="page_337">p. 337</span> <span id="vi.v-Page_337"></span>at once
answers the question why certain persons are called his brethren.

<span id="vi.v-p30"></span>5. This, however, is a point which will find
its proper place further on. We must now hasten to other matters. The
passage for discussion now is, “And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did
as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto him his wife and
knew her not till she had brought forth a son, and he called his name
Jesus.” Here, first of all, it is quite needless for our opponent to
show so elaborately that the word *know* has reference to coition,
rather than to intellectual apprehension: as though anyone denied it, or
any person in his senses could ever imagine the folly which Helvidius
takes pains to refute. Then he would teach us that the adverb *till*
implies a fixed and definite time, and when that is fulfilled, he says
the event takes place which previously did not take place, as in the
case before us, “and knew her not till she had brought forth a son.” It
is clear, says he, that she was known after she brought forth, and that
that knowledge was only delayed by her engendering a son. To defend his
position he piles up text upon text, waves his sword like a blind-folded
gladiator, rattles his noisy tongue, and ends with wounding no one but
himself.

<span id="vi.v-p31"></span>6. Our reply is briefly this,—the words
*knew* and *till* in the language of Holy Scripture are capable of a
double meaning. As to the former, he himself gave us a dissertation to
show that it must be referred to sexual intercourse, and no one doubts
that it is often used of the knowledge of the understanding, as, for
instance, “the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem, and his parents
knew it not.” Now we have to prove that just as in the one case he has
followed the usage of Scripture, so with regard to the word *till* he is
utterly refuted by the authority of the same Scripture, which often
denotes by its use a fixed time (he himself told us so), frequently time
without limitation, as when God by the mouth of the prophet says to
certain persons, <span id="fr_4181"></span>[4182](#fn_4181.md) “Even to old
age I am he.” Will He cease to be God when they have grown old? And the
Saviour in the Gospel tells the Apostles, <span
id="fr_4182"></span>[4183](#fn_4182.md) “Lo, I am with you alway, even unto
the end of the world.” Will the Lord then after the end of the world has
come forsake His disciples, and at the very time when seated on twelve
thrones they are to judge the twelve tribes of Israel will they be
bereft of the company of their Lord? Again Paul the Apostle writing to
the Corinthians <span id="fr_4183"></span>[4184](#fn_4183.md) says, “Christ
the first-fruits, afterward they that are Christ’s, at his coming. Then
cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even
the Father, when he shall have put down all rule, and all authority and
power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.”
Granted that the passage relates to our Lord’s human nature, we do not
deny that the words are spoken of Him who endured the cross and is
commanded to sit afterwards on the right hand. What does he mean then by
saying, “for he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his
feet”? Is the Lord to reign only until His enemies begin to be under His
feet, and once they are under His feet will He cease to reign? Of course
His reign will then commence in its fulness when His enemies begin to be
under His feet. David also in the fourth Song of Ascents <span
id="fr_4184"></span>[4185](#fn_4184.md) speaks thus, “Behold, as the eyes
of servants look unto the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maiden
unto the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look unto the Lord our God,
until he have mercy upon us.” Will the prophet, then, look unto the Lord
until he obtain mercy, and when mercy is obtained will he turn his eyes
down to the ground? although elsewhere he says, <span
id="fr_4185"></span>[4186](#fn_4185.md) “Mine eyes fail for thy salvation,
and for the word of thy righteousness.” I could accumulate countless
instances of this usage, and cover the verbosity of our assailant with a
cloud of proofs; I shall, however, add only a few, and leave the reader
to discover like ones for himself.

<span id="vi.v-p37"></span>7. The word of God says in Genesis, <span
id="fr_4186"></span>[4187](#fn_4186.md) “And they gave unto Jacob all the
strange gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their
ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem, and lost
them until this day.” Likewise at the end of Deuteronomy, <span
id="fr_4187"></span>[4188](#fn_4187.md) “So Moses the servant of the Lord
died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord. And
he buried him in the valley, in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor:
but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.” We must certainly
understand by *this day* the time of the composition of the history,
whether you prefer the view that Moses was the author of the Pentateuch
or that Ezra re-edited it. In either case I make no objection. The
question now is whether the words *unto this day* are to be referred to
the time of publishing or writing the books, and if so it is for him to
show, now that so many years have rolled away since that day, that
either the idols hidden beneath the oak have been found, or the grave of
Moses discovered; for he obstinately maintains that what does not happen
so long as the point of time indicated by *until* and *unto* has not
been attained, begins to be when that point <span id="page_338">p.
338</span> <span id="vi.v-Page_338"></span>has been reached. He would do
well to pay heed to the idiom of Holy Scripture, and understand with us,
(it was here he stuck in the mud) that some things which might seem
ambiguous if not expressed are plainly intimated, while others are left
to the exercise of our intellect. For if, while the event was still
fresh in memory and men were living who had seen Moses, it was possible
for his grave to be unknown, much more may this be the case after the
lapse of so many ages. And in the same way must we interpret what we are
told concerning Joseph. The Evangelist pointed out a circumstance which
might have given rise to some scandal, namely, that Mary was not known
by her husband until she was delivered, and he did so that we might be
the more certain that she from whom Joseph refrained while there was
room to doubt the import of the vision was not known after her delivery.

<span id="vi.v-p40"></span>8. In short, what I want to know is why
Joseph refrained until the day of her delivery? Helvidius will of course
reply, because he heard the angel say, <span
id="fr_4188"></span>[4189](#fn_4188.md) “that which is conceived in her is
of the Holy Ghost.” And in turn we rejoin that he had certainly heard
him say, <span id="fr_4189"></span>[4190](#fn_4189.md) “Joseph, thou son of
David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife.” The reason why he was
forbidden to forsake his wife was that he might not think her an
adulteress. Is it true then, that he was ordered not to have intercourse
with his wife? Is it not plain that the warning was given him that he
might not be separated from her? And could the just man dare, he says,
to think of approaching her, when he heard that the Son of God was in
her womb? Excellent! We are to believe then that the same man who gave
so much credit to a dream that he did not dare to touch his wife, yet
afterwards, when he had learnt from the shepherds that the angel of the
Lord had come from heaven and said to them, <span
id="fr_4190"></span>[4191](#fn_4190.md) “Be not afraid: for behold I bring
you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people, for there is
born to you this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the
Lord;” and when the heavenly host had joined with him in the
chorus <span id="fr_4191"></span>[4192](#fn_4191.md) “Glory to God in the
highest, and on earth peace among men of good will;” and when he had
seen just Simeon embrace the infant and exclaim, <span
id="fr_4192"></span>[4193](#fn_4192.md) “Now lettest thou thy servant
depart, O Lord, according to thy word in peace: for mine eyes have seen
thy salvation;” and when he had seen Anna the prophetess, the Magi, the
Star, Herod, the angels; Helvidius, I say, would have us believe that
Joseph, though well acquainted with such surprising wonders, dared to
touch the temple of God, the abode of the Holy Ghost, the mother of his
Lord? Mary at all events “kept all these sayings in her heart.” You
cannot for shame say Joseph did not know of them, for Luke tells
us, <span id="fr_4193"></span>[4194](#fn_4193.md) “His father and mother
were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning Him.” And yet
you with marvellous effrontery contend that the reading of the Greek
manuscripts is corrupt, although it is that which nearly all the Greek
writers have left us in their books, and not only so, but several of the
Latin writers have taken the words the same way. Nor need we now
consider the variations in the copies, since the whole record both of
the Old and New Testament has since that time been <span
id="fr_4194"></span>[4195](#fn_4194.md) translated into Latin, and we must
believe that the water of the fountain flows purer than that of the
stream.

<span id="vi.v-p48"></span>9. Helvidius will answer, “What you say, is
in my opinion mere trifling. Your arguments are so much waste of time,
and the discussion shows more subtlety than truth. Why could not
Scripture say, as it said of Thamar and Judah, <span
id="fr_4195"></span>[4196](#fn_4195.md) ‘And he took his wife, and knew her
again no more’? Could not Matthew find words to express his meaning? ‘He
knew her not,’ he says, ‘until she brought forth a son.’ He did then,
after her delivery, know her, whom he had refrained from knowing until
she was delivered.”

<span id="vi.v-p50"></span>10. If you are so contentious, your own
thoughts shall now prove your master. You must not allow any time to
intervene between delivery and intercourse. You must not say, <span
id="fr_4196"></span>[4197](#fn_4196.md) “If a woman conceive seed and bear
a man child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the
separation of her sickness shall she be unclean. And in the eighth day
the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. And she shall continue
in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days. She shall touch no
hallowed thing,” and so forth. On your showing, Joseph must at once
approach, her, and be subject to Jeremiah’s <span
id="fr_4197"></span>[4198](#fn_4197.md) reproof, “They were as mad horses
in respect of women: every one neighed after his neighbour’s wife.”
Otherwise, how can the words stand good, “he knew her not, till she had
brought forth a son,” if he waits after the time of another purifying
has expired, if his lust must brook another long delay of forty days?
The mother must go unpurged from her child-bed taint, and the wailing
infant be attended to by the midwives, while the husband clasps his
exhausted wife. Thus for<span id="page_339">p. 339</span> <span
id="vi.v-Page_339"></span>sooth must their married life begin so that
the Evangelist may not be convicted of falsehood. But God forbid that we
should think thus of the Saviour’s mother and of a just man. No midwife
assisted at His birth; no women’s officiousness intervened. With her own
hands she wrapped Him in the swaddling clothes, herself both mother and
midwife, <span id="fr_4198"></span>[4199](#fn_4198.md) “and laid Him,” we
are told, “in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn”;
a statement which, on the one hand, refutes the ravings of the
apocryphal accounts, for Mary herself wrapped Him in the swaddling
clothes, and on the other makes the voluptuous notion of Helvidius
impossible, since there was no place suitable for married intercourse in
the inn.

<span id="vi.v-p54"></span>11. An ample reply has now been given to what
he advanced respecting the words *before they came together,* and *he
knew her not till she had brought forth a son*. I must now proceed, if
my reply is to follow the order of his argument, to the third point. He
will have it that Mary bore other sons, and he quotes the passage, <span
id="fr_4199"></span>[4200](#fn_4199.md) “And Joseph also went up to the
city of David to enroll himself with Mary, who was betrothed to him,
being great with child. And it came to pass, while they were there, the
days were fulfilled that she should be delivered, and she brought forth
her first-born son.” From this he endeavours to show that the term
*first-born* is inapplicable except to a person who has brothers, just
as he is called *only begotten* who is the only son of his parents.

<span id="vi.v-p56"></span>12. Our position is this: Every only begotten
son is a first-born son, but not every first-born is an only begotten.
By first-born we understand not only one who is succeeded by others, but
one who has had no predecessor. <span
id="fr_4200"></span>[4201](#fn_4200.md) “Everything,” says the Lord to
Aaron, “that openeth the womb of all flesh which they offer unto the
Lord, both of man and beast, shall be thine: nevertheless the first born
of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts
shalt thou redeem.” The word of God defines *first-born* as everything
that openeth the womb. Otherwise, if the title belongs to such only as
have younger brothers, the priests cannot claim the firstlings until
their successors have been begotten, lest, perchance, in case there were
no subsequent delivery it should prove to be the first-born but not
merely the only begotten. <span id="fr_4201"></span>[4202](#fn_4201.md)
“And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shalt thou
redeem, according to thine estimation for the money of five shekels,
after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs). But the
firstling of an ox, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a
goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy.” The word of God compels me
to dedicate to God everything that openeth the womb if it be the
firstling of clean beasts: if of unclean beasts, I must redeem it, and
give the value to the priest. I might reply and say, Why do you tie me
down to the short space of a month? Why do you speak of the first-born,
when I cannot tell whether there are brothers to follow? Wait until the
second is born. I owe nothing to the priest, unless the birth of a
second should make the one I previously had the first-born. Will not the
very points of the letters cry out against me and convict me of my
folly, and declare that first-born is a title of him who opens the womb,
and is not to be restricted to him who has brothers? And, then, to take
the case of John: we are agreed that he was an only begotten son: I want
to know if he was not also a first-born son, and whether he was not
absolutely amenable to the law. There can be no doubt in the matter. At
all events Scripture thus speaks of the Saviour, <span
id="fr_4202"></span>[4203](#fn_4202.md) “And when the days of her
purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought
him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the
law of the Lord, every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy
to the Lord) and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in
the law of the Lord, a pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons.” If
this law relates only to the first-born, and there can be no first-born
unless there are successors, no one ought to be bound by the law of the
first-born who cannot tell whether there will be successors. But
inasmuch as he who has no younger brothers is bound by the law of the
first-born, we gather that he is called the first-born who opens the
womb and who has been preceded by none, not he whose birth is followed
by that of a younger brother. Moses writes in Exodus, <span
id="fr_4203"></span>[4204](#fn_4203.md) “And it came to pass at midnight,
that the Lord smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the
first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the first-born of the
captive that was in the dungeon: And all the first-born of cattle.” Tell
me, were they who then perished by the destroyer, only your first-born,
or, something more, did they include the only begotten? If only they who
have brothers are called first-born, the only begotten were saved from
death. And if it be the fact that the only begotten were slain, it was
contrary to the sentence pronounced, for the only begotten to die as
well as the first-born. You must either release the only begotten from
the penalty, and in that case you become ridiculous: or, if you allow
that they were slain, we gain our point, though <span id="page_340">p.
340</span> <span id="vi.v-Page_340"></span>we have not to thank you for
it, that only begotten sons also are called first-born.

<span id="vi.v-p61"></span>13. The last proposition of Helvidius was
this, and it is what he wished to show when he treated of the
first-born, that brethren of the Lord are mentioned in the Gospels. For
example, <span id="fr_4204"></span>[4205](#fn_4204.md) “Behold, his mother
and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.” And
elsewhere, <span id="fr_4205"></span>[4206](#fn_4205.md) “After this he
went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren.” And
again, <span id="fr_4206"></span>[4207](#fn_4206.md) “His brethren
therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judæa, that thy
disciples also may behold the works which thou doest. For no man doeth
anything in secret, and himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou
doest these things, manifest thyself to the world.” And John adds, <span
id="fr_4207"></span>[4208](#fn_4207.md) “For even his brethren did not
believe on him.” Mark also and Matthew, <span
id="fr_4208"></span>[4209](#fn_4208.md) “And coming into his own country he
taught them in their synagogues, insomuch that they were astonished, and
said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and mighty works? Is not this
the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren
James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas? And his sisters, are they not
all with us?” Luke also in the Acts of the Apostles relates, <span
id="fr_4209"></span>[4210](#fn_4209.md) “These all with one accord
continued stedfastly in prayer, with the women and Mary the mother of
Jesus, and with his brethren.” Paul the Apostle also is at one with
them, and witnesses to their historical accuracy, <span
id="fr_4210"></span>[4211](#fn_4210.md) “And I went up by revelation, but
other of the apostles saw I none, save Peter and James the Lord’s
brother.” And again in another place, <span
id="fr_4211"></span>[4212](#fn_4211.md) “Have we no right to eat and drink?
Have we no right to lead about wives even as the rest of the Apostles,
and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?” And for fear any one should
not allow the evidence of the Jews, since it was they from whose mouth
we hear the name of His brothers, but should maintain that His
countrymen were deceived by the same error in respect of the brothers
into which they fell in their belief about the father, Helvidius utters
a sharp note of warning and cries, “The same names are repeated by the
Evangelists in another place, and the same persons are there brethren of
the Lord and sons of Mary.” Matthew says, <span
id="fr_4212"></span>[4213](#fn_4212.md) “And many women were there
(doubtless at the Lord’s cross) beholding from afar, which had followed
Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him: among whom was Mary Magdalene,
and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of
Zebedee.” Mark also, <span id="fr_4213"></span>[4214](#fn_4213.md) “And
there were also women beholding from afar, among whom were both Mary
Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and
Salome”; and in the same place shortly after, “And many other women
which came up with him unto Jerusalem.” Luke too, <span
id="fr_4214"></span>[4215](#fn_4214.md) “Now there were Mary Magdalene, and
Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them.”

<span id="vi.v-p73"></span>14. My reason for repeating the same thing
again and again is to prevent him from raising a false issue and crying
out that I have withheld such passages as make for him, and that his
view has been torn to shreds not by evidence of Scripture, but by
evasive arguments. Observe, he says, James and Joses are sons of Mary,
and the same persons who were called brethren by the Jews. Observe, Mary
is the mother of James the less and of Joses. And James is called the
less to distinguish him from James the greater, who was the son of
Zebedee, as Mark elsewhere states, <span
id="fr_4215"></span>[4216](#fn_4215.md) “And Mary Magdalene and Mary the
mother of Joses beheld where he was laid. And when the sabbath was past,
they bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.” And, as might
be expected, he says: “What a poor and impious view we take of Mary, if
we hold that when other women were concerned about the burial of Jesus,
she His mother was absent; or if we invent some kind of a second Mary;
and all the more because the Gospel of S. John testifies that she was
there present, when the Lord upon the cross commended her, as His mother
and now a widow, to the care of John. Or must we suppose that the
Evangelists were so far mistaken and so far mislead us as to call Mary
the mother of those who were known to the Jews as brethren of Jesus?”

<span id="vi.v-p75"></span>15. What darkness, what raging madness
rushing to its own destruction! You say that the mother of the Lord was
present at the cross, you say that she was entrusted to the disciple
John on account of her widowhood and solitary condition: as if upon your
own showing, she had not four sons, and numerous daughters, with whose
solace she might comfort herself? You also apply to her the name of
widow which is not found in Scripture. And although you quote all
instances in the Gospels, the words of John alone displease you. You say
in passing that she was present at the cross, that you may not appear to
have omitted it on purpose, and yet not a word about the women who were
with her. I could pardon you if you were ignorant, but I <span
id="page_341">p. 341</span> <span id="vi.v-Page_341"></span>see you have
a reason for your silence. Let me point out then what John says, <span
id="fr_4216"></span>[4217](#fn_4216.md) “But there were standing by the
cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of
Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.” No one doubts that there were two apostles
called by the name James, James the son of Zebedee, and James the son of
Alphæus. Do you intend the comparatively unknown James the less, who is
called in Scripture the son of Mary, not however of Mary the mother of
our Lord, to be an apostle, or not? If he is an apostle, he must be the
son of Alphæus and a believer in Jesus, “For neither did his brethren
believe in him.” If he is not an apostle, but a third James (who he can
be I cannot tell), how can he be regarded as the Lord’s brother, and
how, being a third, can he be called *less* to distinguish him from
*greater*, when *greater* and *less* are used to denote the relations
existing, not between three, but between two? Notice, moreover, that the
Lord’s brother is an apostle, since Paul says, <span
id="fr_4217"></span>[4218](#fn_4217.md) “Then after three years I went up
to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days. But
other of the Apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.” And in
the same Epistle, <span id="fr_4218"></span>[4219](#fn_4218.md) “And when
they perceived the grace that was given unto me, James and Cephas and
John, who were reputed to be pillars,” etc. And that you may not suppose
this James to be the son of Zebedee, you have only to read the Acts of
the Apostles, and you will find that the latter had already been slain
by Herod. The only conclusion is that the Mary who is described as the
mother of James the less was the wife of Alphæus and sister of Mary the
Lord’s mother, the one who is called by John the Evangelist “Mary of
Clopas,” whether after her father, or kindred, or for some other reason.
But if you think they are two persons because elsewhere we read, “Mary
the mother of James the less,” and here, “Mary of Clopas,” you have
still to learn that it is customary in Scripture for the same individual
to bear different names. Raguel, Moses’ father-in-law, is also called
Jethro. Gedeon, <span id="fr_4219"></span>[4220](#fn_4219.md) without any
apparent reason for the change, all at once becomes Jerubbaal. Ozias,
king of Judah, has an alternative, Azarias. Mount Tabor is called
Itabyrium. Again Hermon is called by the Phenicians Sanior, and by the
Amorites Sanir. The same tract of country is known by three names, <span
id="fr_4220"></span>[4221](#fn_4220.md) Negebh, Teman, and Darom in
Ezekiel. Peter is also called Simon and Cephas. Judas the zealot in
another Gospel is called Thaddaeus. And there are numerous other
examples which the reader will be able to collect for himself from every
part of Scripture.

<span id="vi.v-p81"></span>16. Now here we have the explanation of what
I am endeavouring to show, how it is that the sons of Mary, the sister
of our Lord’s mother, who though not formerly believers afterwards did
believe, can be called brethren of the Lord. Possibly the case might be
that one of the brethren believed immediately while the others did not
believe until long after, and that one Mary was the mother of James and
Joses, namely, “Mary of Clopas,” who is the same as the wife of Alphæus,
the other, the mother of James the less. In any case, if she (the
latter) had been the Lord’s mother S. John would have allowed her the
title, as everywhere else, and would not by calling her the mother of
other sons have given a wrong impression. But at this stage I do not
wish to argue for or against the supposition that Mary the wife of
Clopas and Mary the mother of James and Joses were different women,
provided it is clearly understood that Mary the mother of James and
Joses was not the same person as the Lord’s mother. How then, says
Helvidius, do you make out that they were called the Lord’s brethren who
were not his brethren? I will show how that is. In Holy Scripture there
are four kinds of brethren—by nature, race, kindred, love. Instances of
brethren by nature are Esau and Jacob, the twelve patriarchs, Andrew and
Peter, James and John. As to race, all Jews are called brethren of one
another, as in Deuteronomy, <span id="fr_4221"></span>[4222](#fn_4221.md)
“If thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee,
and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go
free from thee.” And in the same book, <span
id="fr_4222"></span>[4223](#fn_4222.md) “Thou shalt in anywise set him king
over thee, whom the Lord thy God shall choose: one from among thy
brethren shalt thou set king over thee; thou mayest not put a foreigner
over thee, which is not thy brother.” And again, <span
id="fr_4223"></span>[4224](#fn_4223.md) “Thou shalt not see thy brother’s
ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely
bring them again unto thy brother. And if thy brother be not nigh unto
thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it home to thine
house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and
thou shalt restore it to him again.” And the Apostle Paul says, <span
id="fr_4224"></span>[4225](#fn_4224.md) “I could wish that I myself were
anathema from Christ for my brethren’s sake, my kinsmen according to the
flesh: who are Israelites.” Moreover they are called brethren by kindred
who are of one family, that is <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.v-p85.2"></span>πατρία</span>, <span id="page_342">p. 342</span>
<span id="vi.v-Page_342"></span>which corresponds to the Latin
*paternitas*, because from a single root a numerous progeny proceeds. In
Genesis <span id="fr_4225"></span>[4226](#fn_4225.md) we read, “And Abram
said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee,
and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we are brethren.” And again,
“So Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan, and Lot journeyed east: and
they separated each from his brother.” Certainly Lot was not Abraham’s
brother, but the son of Abraham’s brother Aram. For Terah begat Abraham
and Nahor and Aram: and Aram begat Lot. Again we read, <span
id="fr_4226"></span>[4227](#fn_4226.md) “And Abram was seventy and five
years old when he departed out of Haran. And Abram took Sarai his wife,
and Lot his brother’s son.” But if you still doubt whether a nephew can
be called a son, let me give you an instance. <span
id="fr_4227"></span>[4228](#fn_4227.md) “And when Abram heard that his
brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his
house, three hundred and eighteen.” And after describing the night
attack and the slaughter, he adds, “And he brought back all the goods,
and also brought again his brother Lot.” Let this suffice by way of
proof of my assertion. But for fear you may make some cavilling
objection, and wriggle out of your difficulty like a snake, I must bind
you fast with the bonds of proof to stop your hissing and complaining,
for I know you would like to say you have been overcome not so much by
Scripture truth as by intricate arguments. Jacob, the son of Isaac and
Rebecca, when in fear of his brother’s treachery he had gone to
Mesopotamia, drew nigh and rolled away the stone from the mouth of the
well, and watered the flocks of Laban, his mother’s brother. <span
id="fr_4228"></span>[4229](#fn_4228.md) “And Jacob kissed Rachel, and
lifted up his voice, and wept. And Jacob told Rachel that he was her
father’s brother, and that he was Rebekah’s son.” Here is an example of
the rule already referred to, by which a nephew is called a brother. And
again, <span id="fr_4229"></span>[4230](#fn_4229.md) “Laban said unto
Jacob. Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me
for nought? Tell me what shall thy wages be.” And so, when, at the end
of twenty years, without the knowledge of his father-in-law and
accompanied by his wives and sons he was returning to his country, on
Laban overtaking him in the mountain of Gilead and failing to find the
idols which Rachel hid among the baggage, Jacob answered and said to
Laban, <span id="fr_4230"></span>[4231](#fn_4230.md) “What is my trespass?
What is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me? Whereas thou
hast felt all about my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household
stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may
judge betwixt us two.” Tell me who are those brothers of Jacob and Laban
who were present there? Esau, Jacob’s brother, was certainly not there,
and Laban, the son of Bethuel, had no brothers although he had a sister
Rebecca.

<span id="vi.v-p92"></span>17. Innumerable instances of the same kind
are to be found in the sacred books. But, to be brief, I will return to
the last of the four classes of brethren, those, namely, who are
brethren by affection, and these again fall into two divisions, those of
the spiritual and those of the general relationship. I say *spiritual*
because all of us Christians are called brethren, as in the verse, <span
id="fr_4231"></span>[4232](#fn_4231.md) “Behold, how good and how pleasant
it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.” And in another psalm the
Saviour says, <span id="fr_4232"></span>[4233](#fn_4232.md) “I will declare
thy name unto my brethren.” And elsewhere, <span
id="fr_4233"></span>[4234](#fn_4233.md) “Go unto my brethren and say to
them.” I say also *general*, because we are all children of one Father,
there is a like bond of brotherhood between us all. <span
id="fr_4234"></span>[4235](#fn_4234.md) “Tell these who hate you,” says the
prophet, “ye are our brethren.” And the Apostle writing to the
Corinthians: <span id="fr_4235"></span>[4236](#fn_4235.md) “If any man that
is named brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a
reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner: with such a one no, not to
eat.” I now ask to which class you consider the Lord’s brethren in the
Gospel must be assigned. They are brethren by nature, you say. But
Scripture does not say so; it calls them neither sons of Mary, nor of
Joseph. Shall we say they are brethren by race? But it is absurd to
suppose that a few Jews were called His brethren when all Jews of the
time might upon this principle have borne the title. Were they brethren
by virtue of close intimacy and the union of heart and mind? If that
were so, who were more truly His brethren than the apostles who received
His private instruction and were called by Him His mother and His
brethren? Again, if all men, as such, were His brethren, it would have
been foolish to deliver a special message, “Behold, thy brethren seek
thee,” for all men alike were entitled to the name. The only alternative
is to adopt the previous explanation and understand them to be called
brethren in virtue of the bond of kindred, not of love and sympathy, nor
by prerogative of race, nor yet by nature. Just as Lot was called
Abraham’s brother, and Jacob Laban’s, just as the daughters of
Zelophehad received a lot among their brethren, just as Abraham himself
had to wife Sarah his sister, for he says, <span
id="fr_4236"></span>[4237](#fn_4236.md) “She is in<span id="page_343">p.
343</span> <span id="vi.v-Page_343"></span>deed my sister, on the
father’s side, not on the mother’s,” that is to say, she was the
daughter of his brother, not of his sister. Otherwise, what are we to
say of Abraham, a just man, taking to wife the daughter of his own
father? Scripture, in relating the history of the men of early times,
does not outrage our ears by speaking of the enormity in express terms,
but prefers to leave it to be inferred by the reader: and God afterwards
gives to the prohibition the sanction of the law, and threatens, <span
id="fr_4237"></span>[4238](#fn_4237.md) “He who takes his sister, born of
his father, or of his mother, and beholds her nakedness, hath commited
abomination, he shall be utterly destroyed. He hath uncovered his
sister’s nakedness, he shall bear his sin.”

<span id="vi.v-p100"></span>18. There are things which, in your extreme
ignorance, you had never read, and therefore you neglected the whole
range of Scripture and employed your madness in outraging the Virgin,
like the man in the story who being unknown to everybody and finding
that he could devise no good deed by which to gain renown, burned the
temple of Diana: and when no one revealed the sacrilegious act, it is
said that he himself went up and down proclaiming that he was the man
who had applied the fire. The rulers of Ephesus were curious to know
what made him do this thing, whereupon he replied that if he could not
have fame for good deeds, all men should give him credit for bad ones.
Grecian history relates the incident. But you do worse. You have set on
fire the temple of the Lord’s body, you have defiled the sanctuary of
the Holy Spirit from which you are determined to make a team of four
brethren and a heap of sisters come forth. In a word, joining in the
chorus of the Jews, you say, <span id="fr_4238"></span>[4239](#fn_4238.md)
“Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his
brethren James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas? and his sisters, are
they not all with us? The word *all* would not be used if there were not
a crowd of them.” Pray tell me, who, before you appeared, was acquainted
with this blasphemy? who thought the theory worth two-pence? You have
gained your desire, and are become notorious by crime. For myself who am
your opponent, although we live in the <span
id="fr_4239"></span>[4240](#fn_4239.md) same city, I don’t know, as the
saying is, whether you are white or black. I pass over faults of diction
which abound in every book you write. I say not a word about your absurd
introduction. Good heavens! I do not ask for eloquence, since, having
none yourself, you applied for a supply of it to your brother Craterius.
I do not ask for grace of style, I look for purity of soul: for with
Christians it is the greatest of solecisms and of vices of style to
introduce anything base either in word or action. I am come to the
conclusion of my argument. I will deal with you as though I had as yet
prevailed nothing; and you will find yourself on the horns of a dilemma.
It is clear that our Lord’s brethren bore the name in the same way that
Joseph was called his father: <span id="fr_4240"></span>[4241](#fn_4240.md)
“I and thy father sought thee sorrowing.” It was His mother who said
this, not the Jews. The Evangelist himself relates that His father and
His mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning
Him, and there are similar passages which we have already quoted in
which Joseph and Mary are called his parents. Seeing that you have been
foolish enough to persuade yourself that the Greek manuscripts are
corrupt, you will perhaps plead the diversity of readings. I therefore
come to the Gospel of John, and there it is plainly written, <span
id="fr_4241"></span>[4242](#fn_4241.md) “Philip findeth Nathanael, and
saith unto him, We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and the
prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” You will
certainly find this in your manuscript. Now tell me, how is Jesus the
son of Joseph when it is clear that He was begotten of the Holy Ghost?
Was Joseph His true father? Dull as you are, you will not venture to say
that. Was he His reputed father? If so, let the same rule be applied to
them when they are called brethren, that you apply to Joseph when he is
called father.

<span id="vi.v-p105"></span>19. Now that I have cleared the rocks and
shoals I must spread sail and make all speed to reach his epilogue.
Feeling himself to be a smatterer, he there produces Tertullian as a
witness and quotes the words of Victorinus bishop of <span
id="fr_4242"></span>[4243](#fn_4242.md) Petavium. Of Tertullian I say no
more than that he did not belong to the Church. But as regards
Victorinus, I assert what has already been proved from the Gospel—that
he spoke of the brethren of the Lord not as being sons of Mary, but
brethren in the sense I have explained, that is to say, brethren in
point of kinship not by nature. We are, however, spending our strength
on trifles, and, leaving the fountain of truth, are following the tiny
streams of opinion. Might I not array against you the whole series of
ancient writers? Ignatius, Polycarp, Irenæus, Justin Martyr, and many
other apostolic and eloquent men, who against Ebion, Theodotus of
Byzantium, and Valentinus, held these same views, and wrote volumes
replete with wisdom. If you had ever read what they wrote, you would be
a wiser man. But I think it better to reply <span id="page_344">p.
344</span> <span id="vi.v-Page_344"></span>briefly to each point than to
linger any longer and extend my book to an undue length.

<span id="vi.v-p107"></span>20. I now direct the attack against the
passage in which, wishing to show your cleverness, you institute a
comparison between virginity and marriage. I could not forbear smiling,
and I thought of the proverb, *did you ever see a camel dance?* “Are
virgins better,” you ask, “than Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were
married men? Are not infants daily fashioned by the hands of God in the
wombs of their mothers? And if so, are we bound to blush at the thought
of Mary having a husband after she was delivered? If they find any
disgrace in this, they ought not consistently even to believe that God
was born of the Virgin by natural delivery. For according to them there
is more dishonour in a virgin giving birth to God by the organs of
generation, than in a virgin being joined to her own husband after she
has been delivered.” Add, if you like, Helvidius, the other humiliations
of nature, the womb for nine months growing larger, the sickness, the
delivery, the blood, the swaddling-clothes. Picture to yourself the
infant in the enveloping membranes. Introduce into your picture the hard
manger, the wailing of the infant, the circumcision on the eighth day,
the time of purification, so that he may be proved to be unclean. We do
not blush, we are not put to silence. The greater the humiliations He
endured for me, the more I owe Him. And when you have given every
detail, you will be able to produce nothing more shameful than the
cross, which we confess, in which we believe, and by which we triumph
over our enemies.

<span id="vi.v-p108"></span>21. But as we do not deny what is written,
so we do reject what is not written. We believe that God was born of the
Virgin, because we read it. That Mary was married after she brought
forth, we do not believe, because we do not read it. Nor do we say this
to condemn marriage, for virginity itself is the fruit of marriage; but
because when we are dealing with saints we must not judge rashly. If we
adopt possibility as the standard of judgment, we might maintain that
Joseph had several wives because Abraham had, and so had Jacob, and that
the Lord’s brethren were the issue of those wives, an invention which
some hold with a rashness which springs from audacity not from piety.
You say that Mary did not continue a virgin: I claim still more, that
Joseph himself on account of Mary was a virgin, so that from a virgin
wedlock a virgin son was born. For if as a holy man he does not come
under the imputation of fornication, and it is nowhere written that he
had another wife, but was the guardian of Mary whom he was supposed to
have to wife rather than her husband, the conclusion is that he who was
thought worthy to be called father of the Lord, remained a virgin.

<span id="vi.v-p109"></span>22. And now that I am about to institute a
comparison between virginity and marriage, I beseech my readers not to
suppose that in praising virginity I have in the least disparaged
marriage, and separated the saints of the Old Testament from those of
the New, that is to say, those who had wives and those who altogether
refrained from the embraces of women: I rather think that in accordance
with the difference in time and circumstance one rule applied to the
former, another to us upon whom the ends of the world have come. So long
as that law remained, <span id="fr_4243"></span>[4244](#fn_4243.md) “Be
fruitful, and multiply and replenish the earth”; and <span
id="fr_4244"></span>[4245](#fn_4244.md) “Cursed is the barren woman that
beareth not seed in Israel,” they all married and were given in
marriage, left father and mother, and became one flesh. But once in
tones of thunder the words were heard, <span
id="fr_4245"></span>[4246](#fn_4245.md) “The time is shortened, that
henceforth those that have wives may be as though they had none”:
cleaving to the Lord, we are made one spirit with Him. And why? <span
id="fr_4246"></span>[4247](#fn_4246.md) Because “He that is unmarried is
careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord: but he
that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may
please his wife. And there is a difference also between the wife and the
virgin. She that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord,
that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married
is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.”
Why do you cavil? Why do you resist? The vessel of election says this;
he tells us that there is a difference between the wife and the virgin.
Observe what the happiness of that state must be in which even the
distinction of sex is lost. The virgin is no longer called a
woman. <span id="fr_4247"></span>[4248](#fn_4247.md) “She that is unmarried
is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body
and in spirit.” A virgin is defined as she that is holy in body and in
spirit, for it is no good to have virgin flesh if a woman be married in
mind.

<span id="vi.v-p115"></span>“But she that is married is careful for the
things of the world, how she may please her husband.” Do you think there
is no difference between one who spends her time in prayer and fasting,
and one who must, at her husband’s approach, make up her countenance,
walk with mincing gait, and feign a shew of endearment? The virgin’s aim
is to appear less comely; she will wrong herself <span id="page_345">p.
345</span> <span id="vi.v-Page_345"></span>so as to hide her natural
attractions. The married woman has the paint laid on before her mirror,
and, to the insult of her Maker, strives to acquire something more than
her natural beauty. Then come the prattling of infants, the noisy
household, children watching for her word and waiting for her kiss, the
reckoning up of expenses, the preparation to meet the outlay. On one
side you will see a company of cooks, girded for the onslaught and
attacking the meat: there you may hear the hum of a multitude of
weavers. Meanwhile a message is delivered that the husband and his
friends have arrived. The wife, like a swallow, flies all over the
house. “She has to see to everything. Is the sofa smooth? Is the
pavement swept? Are the flowers in the cups? Is dinner ready?” Tell me,
pray, where amid all this is there room for the thought of God? Are
these happy homes? Where there is the beating of drums, the noise and
clatter of pipe and lute, the clanging of cymbals, can any fear of God
be found? The parasite is snubbed and feels proud of the honour. Enter
next the half-naked victims of the passions, a mark for every lustful
eye. The unhappy wife must either take pleasure in them, and perish, or
be displeased, and provoke her husband. Hence arises discord, the
seed-plot of divorce. Or suppose you find me a house where these things
are unknown, which is a *rara avis* indeed! yet even there the very
management of the household, the education of the children, the wants of
the husband, the correction of the servants, cannot fail to call away
the mind from the thought of God. <span
id="fr_4248"></span>[4249](#fn_4248.md) “It had ceased to be with Sarah
after the manner of women”: so the Scripture says, and afterwards
Abraham received the command, <span id="fr_4249"></span>[4250](#fn_4249.md)
“In all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice.” She who is
not subject to the anxiety and pain of child-bearing and having passed
the change of life has ceased to perform the functions of a woman, is
freed from the curse of God: nor is her desire to her husband, but on
the contrary her husband becomes subject to her, and the voice of the
Lord commands him, “In all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her
voice.” Thus they begin to have time for prayer. For so long as the debt
of marriage is paid, earnest prayer is neglected.

<span id="vi.v-p118"></span>23. I do not deny that holy women are found
both among widows and those who have husbands; but they are such as have
ceased to be wives, or such as, even in the close bond of marriage,
imitate virgin chastity. The Apostle, Christ speaking in him, briefly
bore witness to this when he said, <span
id="fr_4250"></span>[4251](#fn_4250.md) “She that is unmarried is careful
for the things of the Lord, how she may please the Lord: but she that is
married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her
husband.” He leaves us the free exercise of our reason in the matter. He
lays no necessity upon anyone nor leads anyone into a snare: he only
persuades to that which is proper when he wishes all men to be as
himself. He had not, it is true, a commandment from the Lord respecting
virginity, for that grace surpasses the unassisted power of man, and it
would have worn an air of immodesty to force men to fly in the face of
nature, and to say in other words, I want you to be what the angels are.
It is this angelic purity which secures to virginity its highest reward,
and the Apostle might have seemed to despise a course of life which
involves no guilt. Nevertheless in the immediate context he adds, <span
id="fr_4251"></span>[4252](#fn_4251.md) “But I give my judgment, as one
that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. I think therefore
that this is good by reason of the present distress, namely, that it is
good for a man to be as he is.” What is meant by *present
distress?* <span id="fr_4252"></span>[4253](#fn_4252.md) “Woe unto them
that are with child and to them that give suck in those days!” The
reason why the wood grows up is that it may be cut down. The field is
sown that it may be reaped. The world is already full, and the
population is too large for the soil. Every day we are being cut down by
war, snatched away by disease, swallowed up by shipwreck, although we go
to law with one another about the fences of our property. It is only one
addition to the general rule which is made by those who follow the Lamb,
and who have not defiled their garments, for they have continued in
their virgin state. Notice the meaning of *defiling.* I shall not
venture to explain it, for fear Helvidius may be abusive. I agree with
you, when you say, that some virgins are nothing but tavern women; I say
still more, that even adulteresses may be found among them, and, you
will no doubt be still more surprised to hear, that some of the clergy
are inn-keepers and some monks unchaste. Who does not at once understand
that a tavern woman cannot be a virgin, nor an adulterer a monk, nor a
clergy-man a tavern-keeper? Are we to blame virginity if its counterfeit
is at fault? For my part, to pass over other persons and come to the
virgin, I maintain that she who is engaged in huckstering, though for
anything I know she may be a virgin in body, is no longer one in spirit.

<span id="vi.v-p122"></span>24. I have become rhetorical, and have
disported myself a little like a platform orator. <span id="page_346">p.
346</span> <span id="vi.v-Page_346"></span>You compelled me, Helvidius;
for, brightly as the Gospel shines at the present day, you will have it
that equal glory attaches to virginity and to the marriage state. And
because I think that, finding the truth too strong for you, you will
turn to disparaging my life and abusing my character (it is the way of
weak women to talk tittle-tattle in corners when they have been put down
by their masters), I shall anticipate you. I assure you that I shall
regard your railing as a high distinction, since the same lips that
assail me have disparaged Mary, and I, a servant of the Lord, am
favoured with the same barking eloquence as His mother.
