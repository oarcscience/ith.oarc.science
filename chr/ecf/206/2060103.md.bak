<span id="v.XCII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XCII-p1.1"></span>Letter XCII. The Synodical Letter of Theophilus
to the Bishops of Palestine and of Cyprus.</span>

<span id="v.XCII-p2"></span>The synodical letter of the council held at
Alexandria in 400 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XCII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> to condemn Origenism. Written
originally in Greek it was translated into Latin by Jerome.

<span id="v.XCII-p3"></span>This letter has been sent in identical terms
to the Bishops of Palestine and to those of Cyprus. We reproduce the
headings of both copies. That to the Bishops of Palestine commences
thus: To the well-beloved lords, brothers, and fellow-bishops, Eulogius,
John, Zebianus, Auxentius, Dionysius, Gennadius, Zeno, Theodosius,
Dicterius, Porphyry, Saturninus, Alan, Paul, Ammonius, Helianus,
Eusebius, the other Paul, and to all the Catholic bishops gathered
together at the dedication festival of Ælid, <span
id="fr_2637"></span>[2638](#fn_2637.md) Theophilus \[sends\] greeting in
the Lord.

<span id="v.XCII-p5"></span>The Cyprians he addresses thus: To the
well-beloved lords, brothers, and fellow-bishops, Epiphanius, Marcianus,
Agapetus, Boethius, Helpidius, Entasius, Norbanus, Macedonius. Aristo,
Zeno, Asiaticus, Heraclides, the other Zeno, Cyriacus, and Aphroditus,
Theophilus \[sends\] greeting in the Lord.

<span id="v.XCII-p6"></span>The scope of the letter is as follows:

<span id="v.XCII-p7"></span>We have personally visited the monasteries
of Nitria and find that the Origenistic heresy has made great ravages
among them. It is accompanied by a strange fanaticism: men even maim
themselves or cut out their tongues <span
id="fr_2638"></span>[2639](#fn_2638.md) to show how they despise the body.
I find that some men of this kind have gone from Egypt into Syria and
other countries <span id="fr_2639"></span>[2640](#fn_2639.md) where they
speak against us and the truth.

<span id="v.XCII-p10"></span>The books of Origen have been read before a
council of bishops and unanimously condemned. The following are his
chief errors, mainly found in the <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.XCII-p10.1"></span>περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span>.

<span id="v.XCII-p11"></span>1. The Son compared with us is truth, but
compared with the Father he is falsehood.

<span id="v.XCII-p12"></span>2. Christ’s kingdom will one day come to an
end.

<span id="v.XCII-p13"></span>3. We ought to pray to the Father alone,
not to the Son.

<span id="v.XCII-p14"></span>4. Our bodies after the resurrection will
be corruptible and mortal.

<span id="v.XCII-p15"></span>5. There is nothing perfect even in heaven;
the angels themselves are faulty, and some of them feed on the Jewish
sacrifices.

<span id="v.XCII-p16"></span>6. The stars are conscious of their own
movements, and the demons know the future by their courses.

<span id="v.XCII-p17"></span>7. Magic, if real, is not evil.

<span id="v.XCII-p18"></span>8. Christ suffered once for men; he will
suffer again for the demons.

<span id="v.XCII-p19"></span>The Origenists have tried to coerce me;
they have even stirred up the heathen by denouncing the destruction of
the Serapeum; and have sought to withdraw from the ecclesiastical
jurisdiction two persons accused of grave crimes. One of these is the
woman <span id="fr_2640"></span>[2641](#fn_2640.md) <span id="page_186">p.
186</span> <span id="v.XCII-Page_186"></span>who was wrongly placed on
the list of widows by Isidore, the other Isidore himself. He is the
standard-bearer of the heretical faction, and his wealth supplies them
with unbounded resources for their violent enterprises. They have tried
to murder me; they seized the monastery church at Nitria, and for a time
prevented the bishops from entering and the offices from being
performed. Now, like Zebul (Beelzebub) they go to and fro on the earth.

<span id="v.XCII-p21"></span>I have done them no harm; I have even
protected them. But I would not let an old friendship (with Isidore)
impair our faith and discipline. I implore you to oppose them wherever
they come, and to prevent them from unsettling the brethren committed to
you.

and similar things.

brothers (called the Long or Tall Monks) went first to Syria and then to
Constantinople.

<span id="v.XCII-p20"></span> This woman is said to have brought a
charge of immorality against Isidore and then suppressed it on being
placed by him on the list of widows who received the church’s bounty.
Isidore was now eighty years old, and there were many causes for the
quarrel. Palladius, Socrates and Sozomen intimate that the real cause of
Theophilus’ enmity to his old confidant Isidore was that Isidore knew
secrets unfavorable to Theophilus. He afterwards went with the Long
Monks to Constantinople, where Chrysostom by his reception of them
incurred the hatred of Theophilus. See Jerome Letter CXIII.
