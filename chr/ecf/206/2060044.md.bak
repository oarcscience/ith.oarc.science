<span id="v.XXXIII"></span>

<span id="v.XXXIII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XXXIII-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXIII. To Paula.</span>

<span id="v.XXXIII-p2"></span>A fragment of a letter in which Jerome
institutes a comparison between the industry as writers of M. T. Varro
and Origen. It is noteworthy as passing an unqualified eulogium upon
Origen, which contrasts strongly with the tone adopted by the writer in
subsequent years (see, e.g., Letter LXXXIV.). Its date is probably 384
<span class="c17"><span id="v.XXXIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.XXXIII-p3"></span>1. Antiquity marvels at Marcus Terentius
Varro, <span id="fr_748"></span>[749](#fn_748.md) because of the countless
books which he wrote for Latin readers; and Greek writers are
extravagant in their praise of their man of brass, <span
id="fr_749"></span>[750](#fn_749.md) because he has written more works than
one of us could so much as copy. But since Latin ears would find a list
of Greek writings tiresome, I shall confine myself to the Latin Varro. I
shall try to show that we of to-day are sleeping the sleep of
Epimenides, <span id="fr_750"></span>[751](#fn_750.md) and devoting to the
amassing of riches the energy which our predecessors gave to sound, if
secular, learning.

<span id="v.XXXIII-p7"></span>2. Varro’s writings include forty-five
books of antiquities, four concerning the life of the Roman people.

<span id="v.XXXIII-p8"></span>3. But why, you ask me, have I thus
mentioned Varro and the man of brass? Simply to bring to your notice our
Christian man of brass, or, rather, man of adamant <span
id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751.md) —Origen, I mean—whose zeal for the
study of Scripture has fairly earned for him this latter name. Would you
learn what monuments of his genius he has left us? The following list
exhibits them. His writings comprise thirteen books on Genesis, two
books of Mystical Homilies, notes on Exodus, notes on Leviticus, \* \*
\* \* also single books, <span id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752.md) four
books on First Principles, two books on the Resurrection, two dialogues
on the same subject. <span id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753.md)

<span id="v.XXXIII-p12"></span>\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*

<span id="v.XXXIII-p13"></span>4. So, you see, the labors of this one
man have surpassed those of all previous writers, Greek and Latin. Who
has ever managed to read all that he has written? Yet what reward have
his exertions brought him? He stands condemned by his bishop,
Demetrius, <span id="fr_754"></span>[755](#fn_754.md) only the bishops of
Palestine, Arabia, Phenicia, and Achaia dissenting. Imperial Rome
consents to his condemnation, and even convenes a senate to censure
him, <span id="fr_755"></span>[756](#fn_755.md) not—as the rabid hounds who
now pursue him cry—because of the novelty or heterodoxy of his
doctrines, but because men could not tolerate the incomparable eloquence
and knowledge which, when once he opened his lips, made others seem
dumb.

<span id="v.XXXIII-p16"></span>5. I have written the above quickly and
incautiously, by the light of a poor lantern. You will see why, if you
think of those who to-day represent Epicurus and Aristippus. <span

id="v.XXXIII-p3.1"></span>

<span id="v.XXXIII-p4"></span> Of the 490 books composed by this
voluminous writer only two are extant, a treatise on husbandry and an
essay on the Latin language.

<span id="fn_749"></span>[46:750](2060044.htm#fr_749.md) <span
id="v.XXXIII-p4.1"></span>

<span id="v.XXXIII-p5"></span> The epithet <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.XXXIII-p5.1"></span>χαλκέντερος</span> , “heart of brass,” is
applied by Suidas to the grammarian Didymus, who, according to Athenæus,
wrote 3,500 books. Of these not one is extant.

<span id="fn_750"></span>[46:751](2060044.htm#fr_750.md) <span
id="v.XXXIII-p5.2"></span>

<span id="v.XXXIII-p6"></span> Which lasted 57 years.

<span id="fn_751"></span>[46:752](2060044.htm#fr_751.md) <span

<span id="v.XXXIII-p9"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.XXXIII-p9.1"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.XXXIII-p9.2"></span>Αδαμάντιος</span> —Origen is so called by
Eusebius (H. E. vi. 14, 10). It appears to have been his proper name.

<span id="fn_752"></span>[46:753](2060044.htm#fr_752.md) <span
id="v.XXXIII-p9.3"></span>

<span id="v.XXXIII-p10"></span> “They may have been detached essays on
particular subjects.”—Westcott.

<span id="fn_753"></span>[46:754](2060044.htm#fr_753.md) <span
id="v.XXXIII-p10.1"></span>

<span id="v.XXXIII-p11"></span> All the works mentioned have perished
except the treatise on First Principles, and this in its completeness is
extant only in the Latin version of Rufinus. The version made by Jerome
has perished.

<span id="fn_754"></span>[46:755](2060044.htm#fr_754.md) <span
id="v.XXXIII-p13.1"></span>

<span id="v.XXXIII-p14"></span> Origen left Alexandria for good in 231
<span class="c17"><span id="v.XXXIII-p14.1"></span>a.d.</span>, and it
was in that or the following year that Demetrius convoked the synod
which condemned not so much his writings as his conduct. He appears to
have been excommunicated as a heretic.

<span id="fn_755"></span>[46:756](2060044.htm#fr_755.md) <span
id="v.XXXIII-p14.2"></span>

<span id="v.XXXIII-p15"></span> For Origen’s condemnation in a synod
held at Rome this passage is the principal authority. It is more than
doubtful whether such a synod ever met; if it did it must have been when
Pontianus was pope, in 231 or 232 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XXXIII-p15.1"></span>a.d.</span> Jerome may only mean that the
great men of Rome all agreed in this condemnation.

<span id="fn_756"></span>[46:757](2060044.htm#fr_756.md) <span
id="v.XXXIII-p16.1"></span>

<span id="v.XXXIII-p17"></span> Both these philosophers were hedonists,
and the latter was a sensualist as well. Jerome is probably satirizing
the worldly clergy of Rome, just as in after-years he nicknames his
opponent Jovinian “the Christian Epicurus.”
