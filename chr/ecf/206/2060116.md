<span id="v.CV-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.CV-p1.1"></span>Letter CV. To Augustine.</span>

<span id="v.CV-p2"></span>Jerome’s answer to the foregoing. He complains
that even now he has not received Augustine’s letter and asks him to
send him a copy of it. Popular rumour, he declares, credits Augustine
with a deliberate suppression of the letter in order that he may seem to
win an easy victory over his opponent. Jerome next deals with
Augustine’s denial of having made a written attack upon him and
concludes by refusing for the present all discussion of points of
criticism. The date of the letter is 403 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.CV-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> See Augustine, vol. i., Letter LXXII.
