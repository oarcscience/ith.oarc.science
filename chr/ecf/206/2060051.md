<span id="v.XL-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XL-p1.1"></span>Letter XL. To Marcella.</span>

<span id="v.XL-p2"></span>Onasus, of Segesta, the subject of this
letter, was among Jerome’s Roman opponents. He is here held up to
ridicule in a manner which reflects little credit on the writer’s
urbanity. The date of the letter is 385 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XL-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.XL-p3"></span>1. The medical men called surgeons pass for
being cruel, but really deserve pity. For is it not pitiful to cut away
the dead flesh of another man with merciless knives without being moved
by his pangs? Is it not pitiful that the man who is curing the patient
is callous to his sufferings, and has to appear as his enemy? Yet such
is the order of nature. While truth is always bitter, pleasantness waits
upon evil-doing. Isaiah goes naked without blushing as a type of
captivity to come. <span id="fr_857"></span>[858](#fn_857) Jeremiah is
sent from Jerusalem to the Euphrates (a river in Mesopotamia), and
leaves his girdle to be marred in the Chaldæan camp, among the Assyrians
hostile to his people. <span id="fr_858"></span>[859](#fn_858) Ezekiel
is told to eat bread made of mingled seeds and sprinkled with the dung
of men and cattle. <span id="fr_859"></span>[860](#fn_859) He has to see
his wife die without shedding a tear. <span
id="fr_860"></span>[861](#fn_860) Amos is driven from Samaria. <span
id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861) Why is he driven from it? Surely in
this case as in the others, because he was a spiritual surgeon, who cut
away the parts diseased by sin and urged men to repentance. The apostle
Paul says: “Am I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the
truth?” <span id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862) And so the Saviour
Himself found it, from whom many of the disciples went back because His
sayings seemed hard. <span id="fr_863"></span>[864](#fn_863)

<span id="v.XL-p11"></span>2. It is not surprising, then, that by
exposing their faults I have offended many. I have arranged to operate
on a cancerous nose; <span id="fr_864"></span>[865](#fn_864) let him who
suffers from wens tremble. I wish to rebuke a chattering daw; let the
crow realize that she is offensive. <span
id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865) Yet, after all, is there but one
person in Rome

<span id="v.XL-p14"></span>“Whose nostrils are disfigured by a
scar?” <span id="fr_866"></span>[867](#fn_866)

<span id="v.XL-p16"></span>Is Onasus of Segesta alone in puffing out his
cheeks like bladders and balancing hollow phrases on his tongue?

<span id="v.XL-p17"></span>I say that certain persons have, by crime,
perjury, and false pretences, attained to this or that high position.
How does it hurt you who know that the charge does not touch you? I
laugh at a pleader who has no <span id="page_55">p. 55</span> <span
id="v.XL-Page_55"></span>clients, and sneer at a penny-a-liner’s
eloquence. What does it matter to you who are such a refined speaker? It
is my whim to inveigh against mercenary priests. You are rich already,
why should you be angry? I wish to shut up Vulcan and burn him in his
own flames. Are you his guest or his neighbor that you try to save an
idol’s shrine from the fire? I choose to make merry over ghosts and owls
and monsters of the Nile; and whatever I say, you take it as aimed at
you. At whatever fault I point my pen, you cry out that you are meant.
You collar me and drag me into court and absurdly charge me with writing
satires when I only write plain prose!

<span id="v.XL-p18"></span>So you really think yourself a pretty fellow
just because you have a lucky name! <span
id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867) Why it does not follow at all. A brake
is called a brake just because the light does not break through
it. <span id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868) The Fates are called
“sparers,” <span id="fr_869"></span>[870](#fn_869) just because they
never spare. The Furies are spoken of as gracious, <span
id="fr_870"></span>[871](#fn_870) because they show no grace. And in
common speech Ethiopians go by the name of silverlings. Still, if the
showing up of faults always angers you, I will soothe you now with the
words of Persius: “May you be a catch for my lord and lady’s daughter!
May the pretty ladies scramble for you! May the ground you walk on turn
to a rose-bed!” <span id="fr_871"></span>[872](#fn_871)

<span id="v.XL-p24"></span>3. All the same, I will give you a hint what
features to hide if you want to look your best. Show no nose upon your
face and keep your mouth shut. You will then stand some chance of being
counted both handsome and eloquent.
