<span id="v.XCIII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XCIII-p1.1"></span>Letter XCIII. From the Bishops of Palestine to
Theophilus.</span>

<span id="v.XCIII-p2"></span>The synodical letter of the council of
Jerusalem sent to Theophilus in reply to the preceding. The translation
as before is due to Jerome.

<span id="v.XCIII-p3"></span>The following is an epitome: We have done
all that you wished, and Palestine is almost wholly free from the taint
of heresy. We wish that not only the Origenists, but Jews, Samaritans
and heathen also, could be put down. Origenism does not exist among us.
The doctrines you describe are never heard here. We anathematize those
who hold such doctrines, and also those of Apollinaris, and shall not
receive anyone whom you excommunicate.
