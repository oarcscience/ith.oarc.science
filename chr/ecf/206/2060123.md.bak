id="v.CXII-p1.1"></span>Letter CXII. To Augustine.</span>

<span id="v.CXII-p2"></span>On receiving Letter CIV. together with duly
authenticated copies of Letters LVI. and LXVII. Jerome in three days
completes an exhaustive reply to all the questions which Augustine had
raised. He explains what is the true title of his book *On Illustrious
Men*, deals at great length with the dispute between Paul and Peter,
expounds his views with regard to the Septuagint, and shews by the story
of “the gourd” how close and accurate his translations are. His language
throughout is kind but rather patronising: indeed in this whole
correspondence Jerome seldom sufficiently recognizes the greatness of
Augustine. The date of the letter is 404 <span class="c17"><span
