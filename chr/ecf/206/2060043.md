<span id="v.XXXII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XXXII-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXII. To Marcella.</span>

<span id="v.XXXII-p2"></span>Jerome writes that he is busy collating
Aquila’s Greek version of the Old Testament with the Hebrew, inquires
after Marcella’s mother, and forwards the two preceding letters (XXX.,
XXXI.). Written at Rome in 384 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XXXII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.XXXII-p3"></span>1. There are two reasons for the shortness
of this letter, one that its bearer is impatient <span id="page_46">p.
46</span> <span id="v.XXXII-Page_46"></span>to start, and the other that
I am too busy to waste time on trifles. You ask what business can be so
urgent as to stop me from a chat on paper. Let me tell you, then, that
for some time past I have been comparing Aquila’s version <span
id="fr_743"></span>[744](#fn_743) of the Old Testament with the scrolls
of the Hebrew, to see if from hatred to Christ the synagogue has changed
the text; and—to speak frankly to a friend—I have found several
variations which confirm our faith. After having exactly revised the
prophets, Solomon, <span id="fr_744"></span>[745](#fn_744) the psalter,
and the books of Kings, I am now engaged on Exodus (called by the Jews,
from its opening words, Eleh shemôth <span
id="fr_745"></span>[746](#fn_745) ), and when I have finished this I
shall go on to Leviticus. Now you see why I can let no claim for a
letter withdraw me from my work. However, as I do not wish my friend
Currentius <span id="fr_746"></span>[747](#fn_746) to run altogether in
vain, I have tacked on to this little talk two letters <span
id="fr_747"></span>[748](#fn_747) which I am sending to your sister
Paula, and to her dear child Eustochium. Read these, and if you find
them instructive or pleasant, take what I have said to them as meant for
you also.

<span id="v.XXXII-p9"></span>2. I hope that Albina, your mother and
mine, is well. In bodily health, I mean, for I doubt not of her
spiritual welfare. Pray salute her for me, and cherish her with double
affection, both as a Christian and as a mother.

id="v.XXXII-p3.1"></span>

<span id="v.XXXII-p4"></span> This version, made in the reign of Hadrian
by a Jewish proselyte who is said by some to have been a renegade
Christian, was marked by an exaggerated literalism and a close following
of the Hebrew original. By the Church it was regarded with suspicion as
being designedly anti-Christian. Jerome, however, here acquits Aquila of
the charge brought against him.
