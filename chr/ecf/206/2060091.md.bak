<span id="v.LXXX-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.LXXX-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXX. From Rufinus to Macarius.</span>

<span id="v.LXXX-p2"></span>Rufinus on his return from Bethlehem to Rome
published a Latin version of Origen’s treatise <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.LXXX-p2.1"></span>περι ᾽Αρχῶν</span>, *On First Principles.* To
this he prefixed the preface which is here printed among Jerome’s
letters. Professing to take as his model Jerome’s own translations of
Origen’s commentaries which he greatly praises, he declares that,
following his example, he has paraphrased the obscure passages of the
treatise and has paraphrased the obscure passages of the treatise and
has omitted as due to interpolators such parts as seem heretical. This
preface with its insincere praise of Jerome (whose name, however, is not
mentioned) and its avowed manipulation of Origen’s text caused much
perplexity at Rome (see Letters LXXXI., LXXXIII., and LXXXIV.), and gave
rise to the controversy between Rufinus and Jerome described in the
Prolegomena, and given at length in vol. iii. of this Series. The date
is 398 <span class="c17"><span id="v.LXXX-p2.2"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.LXXX-p3"></span>1. Large numbers of the brethren have, I
know, in their zeal for the knowledge of the scriptures begged learned
men skilled in Greek literature to make Origen a Roman by bringing home
his teaching to Latin ears. One of these scholars, a dear brother and
associate, <span id="fr_2477"></span>[2478](#fn_2477.md) at the request of
bishop Damasus <span id="page_169">p. 169</span> <span
id="v.LXXX-Page_169"></span>translated from Greek into Latin his two
homilies on the Song of Songs and prefaced the work with an eloquent and
eulogistic introduction such as could not fail to arouse in all an
ardent desire to read and to study Origen. To the soul of that just
man—so he declared—the words of the Song were applicable: “the king hath
brought me into his chambers;” <span
id="fr_2478"></span>[2479](#fn_2478.md) and he went on to speak thus:
“while in his other books Origen surpasses all former writers, in
dealing with the Song of Songs he surpasses himself.” In his preface he
pledges himself to give to Roman ears these homilies of Origen and as
many of his other works as he can. His style is certainly attractive but
I can see that he aims at a more ambitious task than that of a mere
translator. Not content with rendering the words of Origen he desires to
be himself the teacher. <span id="fr_2479"></span>[2480](#fn_2479.md) I for
my part do but follow up an enterprise which he has sanctioned and
commenced, but I lack his vigorous eloquence with which to adorn the
sayings of this great man. I am even afraid lest my deficiencies and
inadequate command of Latin may detract seriously from the reputation of
one whom this writer has deservedly termed second only to the apostles
as a teacher of the Church in knowledge and in wisdom.

<span id="v.LXXX-p7"></span>2. Often turning this over in my mind I held
my peace and refused to listen to the brethren when—as frequently
happened—they urged me to undertake the work. But your persistence, most
faithful brother Macarius, is so great that even want of ability cannot
resist it. Thus, to escape the constant importunings to which you
subject me, I have given way contrary to my resolution; yet only on
these terms that, so far as is possible, I am to be free to follow the
rules of translation laid down by my predecessors, and particularly
those acted upon by the writer whom I have just mentioned. He has
rendered into Latin more than seventy of Origen’s homiletical treatises
and a few also of his commentaries upon the apostle; <span
id="fr_2480"></span>[2481](#fn_2480.md) and in these wherever the Greek
text presents a stumbling block, he has smoothed it down in his version
and has so emended the language used that a Latin writer can find no
word that is at variance with our faith. In his steps, therefore, I
propose to walk, if not displaying the same vigorous eloquence at least
observing the same rules. I shall not reproduce passages in Origen’s
books which disagree with or contradict his own statements elsewhere.
The reason of these inconsistencies I have put more fully before you in
the defence of Origen’s writings composed by Pamphilianus <span
id="fr_2481"></span>[2482](#fn_2481.md) which I have supplemented by a
short treatise of my own. I have given what I consider plain proofs that
his books have been corrupted in numbers of places by heretics and
ill-disposed persons, and particularly those which you now urge me to
translate. The books <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.LXXX-p9.1"></span>περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span>, that is of Principles or of
Powers, are in fact in other respects extremely obscure and difficult.
For they treat of subjects on which the philosophers have spent all
their days and yet have been able to discover nothing. In dealing with
these themes Origen has done his best to make belief in a Creator and a
rational account of things created subservient to religion and not, as
with the philosophers, to irreligion. Wherever then in his books I have
found a statement concerning the Trinity contrary to those which in
other places he has faithfully made on the same subject, I have either
omitted the passage as garbled and misleading or have substituted that
view of the matter which I find him to have frequently asserted. Again,
wherever—in haste to get on with his theme—he is brief or obscure
relying on the skill and intelligence of his readers, I, to make the
passage clearer, have sought to explain it by adding any plainer
statements that I have read on the point in his other books. But I have
added nothing of my own. The words used may be found in other parts of
his writings: they are his, not mine. I mention this here to take from
cavillers all pretext for once more <span
id="fr_2482"></span>[2483](#fn_2482.md) finding fault. But let such
perverse and contentious persons look well to what they are themselves
doing.

<span id="v.LXXX-p11"></span>3. Meantime I have taken up this great
task—if so be that God will grant your prayers—not to stop the mouths of
slanderers (an impossible feat except perhaps to God) but to give to
those who desire it the means of making progress in knowledge.

<span id="v.LXXX-p12"></span>In the sight of God, the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, <span id="fr_2483"></span>[2484](#fn_2483.md) I adjure
and require everyone who shall either read or copy these books of mine,
by his belief in a kingdom to come, by the mystery of the resurrection
from the dead, by the eternal fire which is “prepared for the devil and
his angels;” <span id="fr_2484"></span>[2485](#fn_2484.md) as he hopes not
to inherit eternally that place where “there is weeping and gnashing of
teeth,” <span id="fr_2485"></span>[2486](#fn_2485.md) and where “their worm
dieth not and the fire is not quenched,” <span
id="fr_2486"></span>[2487](#fn_2486.md) let him add nothing to what is
written, let him subtract nothing, let him insert nothing, let him alter
nothing, but let him <span id="page_170">p. 170</span> <span
id="v.LXXX-Page_170"></span>compare his transcript with the copies from
which it is made, let him correct it to the letter, and let him
punctuate it aright. Every manuscript that is not properly corrected and
punctuated he must reject: for otherwise the difficulties in the text
arising from the want of punctuation will make obscure arguments still
more obscure to those who read them.
