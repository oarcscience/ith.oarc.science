id="v.CXIX-p1.1"></span>Letter CXIX. To Minervius and Alexander.</span>

<span id="v.CXIX-p2"></span>Minervius and Alexander two monks of
Toulouse had written to Jerome asking him to explain for them a large
number of passages in scripture. Jerome in his reply postpones most of
these to a future time but deals with two in detail viz. (1) “we shall
not all sleep but we shall all be changed,” [1 Cor. xv.
51](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051.md)<span id="v.CXIX-p2.1"></span>; and
(2) “we shall be caught up in the clouds,” [1 Thes. iv.
17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017.md)<span id="v.CXIX-p2.2"></span>. With
regard to (1) Jerome prefers the reading “we shall all sleep but we
shall not all be changed,” and with regard to (2) he looks upon the
language as metaphorical and interprets it to mean that believers will
be ‘assumed’ into the company of the apostles and prophets. The date of
the letter is 406 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.CXIX-p2.3"></span>a.d.</span>
