<span id="v.XLIV-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XLIV-p1.1"></span>Letter XLIV. To Marcella.</span>

<span id="v.XLIV-p2"></span>Marcella had sent some small articles as a
present (probably to Paula and Eustochium) and Jerome now writes in
their name to thank her for them. He notices the appropriateness of the
gifts, not only to the ladies, but also to himself. Written at Rome in
385 <span class="c17"><span id="v.XLIV-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.XLIV-p3"></span>When absent in body we are wont to converse
together in spirit. <span id="fr_914"></span>[915](#fn_914) Each of us
does what he or she can. You send us gifts, we send you back letters of
thanks. And as we are virgins who have taken the veil, <span
id="fr_915"></span>[916](#fn_915) it is our duty to show that hidden
meanings lurk under your nice presents. Sackcloth, then, is a token of
prayer and fasting, the chairs remind us that a virgin should never stir
abroad, and the wax tapers that we should look for the bridegroom’s
coming with our lights burning. <span id="fr_916"></span>[917](#fn_916)
The cups also warn us to mortify the flesh and always to be ready for
martyrdom. “How bright,” says the psalmist, “is the cup of the Lord,
intoxicating them that drink it!” <span
id="fr_917"></span>[918](#fn_917) Moreover, when you offer to matrons
little fly-flaps to brush away mosquitoes, it is a charming way of
hinting that they should at once check voluptuous feelings, for “dying
flies,” we are told, “spoil sweet ointment.” <span
id="fr_918"></span>[919](#fn_918) In such presents, then, as these,
virgins can find a model, and matrons a pattern. To me, too, your gifts
convey a lesson, although one of an opposite kind. For chairs suit
idlers, sackcloth does for penitents, and cups are wanted for the
thirsty. And I shall be glad to light your tapers, if only to banish the
terrors of the night and the fears of an evil conscience.
