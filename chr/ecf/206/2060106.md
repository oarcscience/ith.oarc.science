<span id="v.XCV-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XCV-p1.1"></span>Letter XCV. From Pope Anastasius to
Simplicianus.</span>

<span id="v.XCV-p2"></span>At the request of Theophilus Anastasius,
bishop of Rome, writes to Simplicianus, bishop of Milan, to inform him
that he, like Theophilus, has condemned Origen whose blasphemies have
been brought under his notice by Eusebius of Cremona. This latter had
shown him a copy of the version by Rufinus of the treatise *On First
Principles*. The date of the letter is 400 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XCV-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.XCV-p3"></span>To his lord and brother Simplicianus,
Anastasius.

<span id="v.XCV-p4"></span>1. It is felt right that a shepherd should
bestow great care and watchfulness upon his flock. In like manner too
from his lofty tower the careful watchman keeps a lookout day and night
on behalf of the city. So also in the hour of tempest when the sea is
dangerous the shipmaster suffers keen anxiety <span
id="fr_2641"></span>[2642](#fn_2641.md) lest the gale and the violence of
the waves shall dash his vessel upon the rocks. It is with similar
feelings that the reverend and honourable Theophilus our brother and
fellow-bishop, ceases not to watch over the things that make for
salvation, that God’s people in the different churches may not by
reading Origen run into awful blasphemies.

<span id="v.XCV-p6"></span>2. Being informed, then, by a letter of the
aforesaid bishop, we inform your holiness that we in like manner who are
set in the city of Rome in which the prince of the apostles, the
glorious Peter, first founded the church and then by his faith
strengthened it; to the end that no man may contrary to the commandment
read these books which we have mentioned, have condemned the same; and
have with earnest prayers urged the strict observance of the precepts
which God and Christ have inspired the evangelists to teach. We have
charged men to remember the words of the venerable apostle Paul,
prophetic and full of warning:—“if any than preach any other gospel unto
you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be
accursed.” <span id="fr_2642"></span>[2643](#fn_2642.md) Holding fast,
therefore, this precept, we have intimated that everything written in
days gone by Origen that is contrary to our faith is even by us rejected
and condemned.

<span id="v.XCV-p8"></span>3. I send this letter to your holiness by the
hand of the presbyter Eusebius, <span
id="fr_2643"></span>[2644](#fn_2643.md) a man filled with a glowing faith
and love for the Lord. He has shewn to me some blasphemous chapters
which made me shudder as I passed judgement on them. If Origen has put
forth any other writings, you are to know that they and their author are
alike condemned by me. The Lord have you in safe keeping, my lord and
brother deservedly held in honour.
