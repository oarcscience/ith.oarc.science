<span id="v.XXXVI-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XXXVI-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXVI. To Pope Damasus.</span>

<span id="v.XXXVI-p2"></span>Jerome’s reply to the foregoing. For the
second and fourth questions he refers Damasus to the writings of
Tertullian, Novatian, and Origen. The remaining three he deals with in
detail.

<span id="v.XXXVI-p3"></span>[Gen. iv.
15](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#015.md)<span id="v.XXXVI-p3.1"></span>, he
understands to mean “the slayer of Cain shall complete the sevenfold
vengeance which is to be wreaked upon him.”

<span id="v.XXXVI-p4"></span>[Exodus xiii.
18](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018.md)<span id="v.XXXVI-p4.1"></span>, he
proposes to reconcile with [Gen. xv.
16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016.md)<span id="v.XXXVI-p4.2"></span>, by
supposing that in the one place the tribe of Levi is referred to, in the
other the tribe of Judah. He suggests, however, that the words rendered
by the LXX. “in the fifth generation” more probably mean “harnessed” (so
A.V.) or “laden.” In reply to the question about Isaac he says: “No man
save Him who for our salvation has deigned to put on flesh has full
knowledge and a complete grasp of the truth. Paul, Samuel, David,
Elisha, all make mistakes, and holy men only know what God reveals to
them.” He then goes on to give a mystical interpretation of the passage
suggested by the martyr Hippolytus. Written the day after the previous
letter.
