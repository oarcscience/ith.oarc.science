<span id="v.XLI-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XLI-p1.1"></span>Letter XLI. To Marcella.</span>

<span id="v.XLI-p2"></span>An effort having been made to convert
Marcella to Montanism, <span id="fr_872"></span>[873](#fn_872) Jerome
here summarizes for her its leading doctrines, which he contrasts with
those of the Church. Written at Rome in 385 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XLI-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.XLI-p4"></span>1. As regards the passages brought together
from the gospel of John with which a certain votary of Montanus has
assailed you, passages in which our Saviour promises that He will go to
the Father, and that He will send the Paraclete <span
id="fr_873"></span>[874](#fn_873) —as regards these, the Acts of the
Apostles inform us both for what time the promises were made, and at
what time they were actually fulfilled. Ten days had elapsed, we are
told, from the Lord’s ascension and fifty from His resurrection, when
the Holy Spirit came down, and the tongues of the believers were cloven,
so that each spoke every language. Then it was that, when certain
persons of those who as yet believed not declared that the disciples
were drunk with new wine, Peter standing in the midst of the apostles,
and of all the concourse said: “Ye men of Judæa and all ye that dwell at
Jerusalem, be this known unto you and hearken to my words: for these are
not drunken as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.
But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel. And it shall
come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my spirit
upon all flesh: and your sons and daughters shall prophesy, and your
young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams: and on
my servants, and on my handmaidens I will pour out…of my spirit.” <span
id="fr_874"></span>[875](#fn_874)

<span id="v.XLI-p7"></span>2. If, then, the apostle Peter, upon whom the
Lord has founded the Church, <span id="fr_875"></span>[876](#fn_875) has
expressly said that the prophecy and promise of the Lord were then and
there fulfilled, how can we claim another fulfilment for ourselves? if
the Montanists reply that Philip’s four daughters prophesied <span
id="fr_876"></span>[877](#fn_876) at a later date, and that a prophet is
mentioned named Agabus, <span id="fr_877"></span>[878](#fn_877) and that
in the partition of the spirit, prophets are spoken of as well as
apostles, teachers and others, <span id="fr_878"></span>[879](#fn_878)
and that Paul himself prophesied many things concerning heresies still
future, and the end of the world; we tell them that we do not so much
reject prophecy—for this is attested by the passion of the Lord—as
refuse to receive prophets whose utterances fail to accord with the
Scriptures old and new.

<span id="v.XLI-p12"></span>3. In the first place we differ from the
Montanists regarding the rule of faith. We distinguish the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit as three persons, but unite them as one
substance. They, on the other hand, following the doctrine of
Sabellius, <span id="fr_879"></span>[880](#fn_879) force the Trinity
into the narrow limits of a single personality. We, while we do not
encourage them, yet allow second marriages, since Paul bids the younger
widows to marry. <span id="fr_880"></span>[881](#fn_880) They suppose a
repetition of marriage a sin so awful that he who has committed it is to
be regarded as an adulterer. We, according <span id="page_56">p.
56</span> <span id="v.XLI-Page_56"></span>to the apostolic tradition (in
which the whole world is at one with us), fast through one Lent yearly;
whereas they keep three in the year as though three saviours had
suffered. I do not mean, of course, that it is unlawful to fast at other
times through the year—always excepting Pentecost <span
id="fr_881"></span>[882](#fn_881) —only that while in Lent it is a duty
of obligation, at other seasons it is a matter of choice. With us,
again, the bishops occupy the place of the apostles, but with them a
bishop ranks not first but third. For while they put first the
patriarchs of Pepusa <span id="fr_882"></span>[883](#fn_882) in Phrygia,
and place next to these the ministers called stewards, <span
id="fr_883"></span>[884](#fn_883) the bishops are relegated to the third
or almost the lowest rank. No doubt their object is to make their
religion more pretentious by putting that last which we put first. Again
they close the doors of the Church to almost every fault, whilst we read
daily, “I desire the repentance of a sinner rather than his
death,” <span id="fr_884"></span>[885](#fn_884) and “Shall they fall and
not arise, saith the Lord,” <span id="fr_885"></span>[886](#fn_885) and
once more “Return ye backsliding children and I will heal your
backslidings.” <span id="fr_886"></span>[887](#fn_886) Their strictness
does not prevent them from themselves committing grave sins, far from
it; but there is this difference between us and them, that, whereas they
in their self-righteousness blush to confess their faults, we do penance
for ours, and so more readily gain pardon for them.

<span id="v.XLI-p21"></span>4. I pass over their sacraments <span
id="fr_887"></span>[888](#fn_887) of sin, made up as they are said to
be, of sucking children subjected to a triumphant martyrdom. <span
id="fr_888"></span>[889](#fn_888) I prefer, I say, not to credit these;
accusations of blood-shedding may well be false. But I must confute the
open blasphemy of men who say that God first determined in the Old
Testament to save the world by Moses and the prophets, but that finding
Himself unable to fulfil His purpose He took to Himself a body of the
Virgin, and preaching under the form of the Son in Christ, underwent
death for our salvation. Moreover that, when by these two steps He was
unable to save the world, He last of all descended by the Holy Spirit
upon Montanus and those demented women Prisca and Maximilia; and that
thus the mutilated and emasculate <span
id="fr_889"></span>[890](#fn_889) Montanus possessed a fulness of
knowledge such as was never claimed by Paul; for he was content to say,
“We know in part, and we prophesy in part,” and again, “Now we see
through a glass darkly.” <span id="fr_890"></span>[891](#fn_890)

<span id="v.XLI-p26"></span>These are statements which require no
refutation. To expose the infidelity of the Montanists is to triumph
over it. Nor is it necessary that in so short a letter as this I should
overthrow the several absurdities which they bring forward. You are well
acquainted with the Scriptures; and, as I take it, you have written, not
because you have been disturbed by their cavils, but only to learn my
opinion about them.
