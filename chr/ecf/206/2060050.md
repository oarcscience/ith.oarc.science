<span id="v.XXXIX-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XXXIX-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXIX. To Paula.</span>

<span id="v.XXXIX-p2"></span>Blæsilla died within three months of her
conversion, and Jerome now writes to Paula to offer her his sympathy
and, if possible, to moderate her grief. He asks her to remember that
Blæsilla is now in paradise, and so far to control herself as to prevent
enemies of the faith from cavilling at her conduct. Then he concludes
with the prophecy (since more than fulfilled) that in his writings
Blæsilla’s name shall never die. Written at Rome in 389 <span
class="c17"><span id="v.XXXIX-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.XXXIX-p3"></span>1. “Oh that my head were waters and mine
eyes a fountain of tears: that I might weep,” not as Jeremiah says, “For
the slain of my people,” <span id="fr_788"></span>[789](#fn_788.md) nor as
Jesus, for the miserable fate of Jerusalem, <span
id="fr_789"></span>[790](#fn_789.md) but for holiness, mercy, innocence,
chastity, and all the virtues, for all are gone now that Blæsilla is
dead. For her sake I do not grieve, but for myself I must; my loss is
too great to be borne with resignation. Who can recall with dry eyes the
glowing faith which induced a girl of twenty to raise the standard of
the Cross, and to mourn the loss of her virginity more than the death of
her husband? Who can recall without a sigh the earnestness of her
prayers, the brilliancy of her conversation, the tenacity of her memory,
and the quickness of her intellect? Had you heard her speak Greek you
would have deemed her ignorant of Latin; yet when she used the tongue of
Rome her words were free from a foreign accent. She even rivalled the
great Origen in those acquirements which won for him the admiration of
Greece. For in a few months, or rather days, she so completely mastered
the difficulties of Hebrew as to emulate her mother’s zeal in learning
and singing the psalms. Her attire was plain, but this plainness was
not, as it often is, a mark of pride. Indeed, her self-abasement was so
perfect that she dressed no better than her maids, and was only
distinguished from them by the greater ease of her walk. Her steps
tottered with weakness, her face was pale and quivering, her slender
neck scarcely upheld her head. Still she always had in her hand a
prophet or a gospel. As I think of her my eyes fill with tears, sobs
impede my voice, and such is my emotion that my tongue cleaves to the
roof of my mouth. As she lay there dying, her poor frame parched with
burning fever, and her relatives gathered round her bed, her last words
were: “Pray to the Lord Jesus, that He may pardon me, because what I
would have done I have not been able to do.” Be at peace, dear Blæsilla,
in full assurance that your garments are always white. <span
id="fr_790"></span>[791](#fn_790.md) For yours is the purity of an
everlasting virginity. I feel confident that my words are true:
conversion can never be too late. The words to the dying robber are a
pledge of this: “Verily I say unto thee, today shalt thou be with me in
paradise.” <span id="fr_791"></span>[792](#fn_791.md) When at last her
spirit was delivered from the burden of the flesh, and had returned to
Him who gave it; <span id="fr_792"></span>[793](#fn_792.md) when, too,
after her long pilgrimage, she had ascended up into her ancient
heritage, her obsequies were celebrated with customary splendor. People
of rank headed the procession, a pall made of cloth of gold covered her
bier. But I seemed to hear a voice from heaven, saying: “I do not
recognize these trappings; such is not the garb I used to wear; this
magnificence is strange to me.”

<span id="v.XXXIX-p9"></span>2. But what is this? I wish to check a
mother’s weeping, and I groan myself. I make no secret of my feelings;
this entire letter is written in tears. Even Jesus wept for Lazarus
because He loved him. <span id="fr_793"></span>[794](#fn_793.md) But he is
a poor comforter who is overcome by his own sighs, and from whose
afflicted heart tears are wrung as well as words. Dear Paula, my agony
is as great as yours. Jesus knows it, whom Blæsilla now follows; the
holy angels know it, whose company she now enjoys. I was her father in
the spirit, her foster-father in affection. Sometimes I say: “Let the
day perish wherein I was born,” <span id="fr_794"></span>[795](#fn_794.md)
and again, “Woe is me, my mother, <span id="page_50">p. 50</span> <span
id="v.XXXIX-Page_50"></span>that thou hast borne me a man of strife and
a man of contention to the whole earth.” <span
id="fr_795"></span>[796](#fn_795.md) I cry: “Righteous art thou, O Lord…yet
let me talk with thee of thy judgments. Wherefore doth the way of the
wicked prosper?” <span id="fr_796"></span>[797](#fn_796.md) and “as for me,
my feet were almost gone, my steps had well-nigh slipped. For I was
envious at the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wicked, and I
said: How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most high? Behold
these are the ungodly who prosper in the world; they increase in
riches.” <span id="fr_797"></span>[798](#fn_797.md) But again I recall
other words, “If I say I will speak thus, behold I should offend against
the generation of thy children.” <span id="fr_798"></span>[799](#fn_798.md)
Do not great waves of doubt surge up over my soul as over yours? How
comes it, I ask, that godless men live to old age in the enjoyment of
this world’s riches? How comes it that untutored youth and innocent
childhood are cut down while still in the bud? Why is it that children
three years old or two, and even unweaned infants, are possessed with
devils, covered with leprosy, and eaten up with jaundice, while godless
men and profane, adulterers and murderers, have health and strength to
blaspheme God? Are we not told that the unrighteousness of the father
does not fall upon the son, <span id="fr_799"></span>[800](#fn_799.md) and
that “the soul that sinneth it shall die?” <span
id="fr_800"></span>[801](#fn_800.md) Or if the old doctrine holds good that
the sins of the fathers must be visited upon the children, <span
id="fr_801"></span>[802](#fn_801.md) an old man’s countless sins cannot
fairly be avenged upon a harmless infant. And I have said: “Verily, I
have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency. For
all the day long have I been plagued.” <span
id="fr_802"></span>[803](#fn_802.md) Yet when I have thought of these
things, like the prophet I have learned to say: “When I thought to know
this, it was too painful for me; until I went into the sanctuary of God;
then understood I their end.” <span id="fr_803"></span>[804](#fn_803.md)
Truly the judgments of the Lord are a great deep. <span
id="fr_804"></span>[805](#fn_804.md) “O the depth of the riches both of the
wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His
ways past finding out!” <span id="fr_805"></span>[806](#fn_805.md) God is
good, and all that He does must be good also. Does He decree that I must
lose my husband? I mourn my loss, but because it is His will I bear it
with resignation. Is an only son snatched from me? The blow is hard, yet
it can be borne, for He who has taken away is He who gave. <span
id="fr_806"></span>[807](#fn_806.md) If I become blind a friend’s reading
will console me. If I become deaf I shall escape from sinful words, and
my thoughts shall be of God alone. And if, besides such trials as these,
poverty, cold, sickness, and nakedness oppress me, I shall wait for
death, and regard them as passing evils, soon to give way to a better
issue. Let us reflect on the words of the sapiential psalm: “Righteous
art thou, O Lord, and upright are thy judgments.” <span
id="fr_807"></span>[808](#fn_807.md) Only he can speak thus who in all his
troubles magnifies the Lord, and, putting down his sufferings to his
sins, thanks God for his clemency.

<span id="v.XXXIX-p25"></span>The daughters of Judah, we are told,
rejoiced, because of all the judgments of the Lord. <span
id="fr_808"></span>[809](#fn_808.md) Therefore, since Judah means
confession, and since every believing soul confesses its faith, <span
id="fr_809"></span>[810](#fn_809.md) he who claims to believe in Christ
must rejoice in all Christ’s judgments. Am I in health? I thank my
Creator. Am I sick? In this case, too, I praise God’s will. For “when I
am weak, then am I strong;” and the strength of the spirit is made
perfect in the weakness of the flesh. Even an apostle must bear what he
dislikes, that ailment for the removal of which he besought the Lord
thrice. God’s reply was: “My grace is sufficient for thee; for my
strength is made perfect in weakness.” <span
id="fr_810"></span>[811](#fn_810.md) Lest he should be unduly elated by his
revelations, a reminder of his human weakness was given to him, just as
in the triumphal car of the victorious general there was always a slave
to whisper constantly, amid the cheerings of the multitude, “Remember
that thou art but man.” <span id="fr_811"></span>[812](#fn_811.md)

<span id="v.XXXIX-p30"></span>3. But why should that be hard to bear
which we must one day ourselves endure? And why do we grieve for the
dead? We are not born to live forever. Abraham, Moses, and Isaiah,
Peter, James, and John, Paul, the “chosen vessel,” <span
id="fr_812"></span>[813](#fn_812.md) and even the Son of God Himself have
all died; and are we vexed when a soul leaves its earthly tenement?
Perhaps he is taken away, “lest that wickedness should alter his
understanding…for his soul pleased the Lord: therefore hasted he to take
him away from the people” <span id="fr_813"></span>[814](#fn_813.md) —lest
in life’s long journey he should lose his way in some trackless maze. We
should indeed mourn for the dead, but only for him whom Gehenna
receives, whom Tartarus devours, and for whose punishment the eternal
fire burns. But we who, in departing, are accompanied by an escort of
angels, and met <span id="page_51">p. 51</span> <span
id="v.XXXIX-Page_51"></span>by Christ Himself, should rather grieve that
we have to tarry yet longer in this tabernacle of death. <span
id="fr_814"></span>[815](#fn_814.md) For “whilst we are at home in the
body, we are absent from the Lord.” <span
id="fr_815"></span>[816](#fn_815.md) Our one longing should be that
expressed by the psalmist: “Woe is me that my pilgrimage is prolonged,
that I have dwelt with them that dwell in Kedar, that my soul hath made
a far pilgrimage.” <span id="fr_816"></span>[817](#fn_816.md) Kedar means
darkness, and darkness stands for this present world (for, we are told,
“the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehendeth it
not” <span id="fr_817"></span>[818](#fn_817) .md). Therefore we should
congratulate our dear Blæsilla that she has passed from darkness to
light, <span id="fr_818"></span>[819](#fn_818.md) and has in the first
flush of her dawning faith received the crown of her completed work. Had
she been cut off (as I pray that none may be) while her thoughts were
full of worldly desires and passing pleasures, then mourning would
indeed have been her due, and no tears shed for her would have been too
many. As it is, by the mercy of Christ she, four months ago, renewed her
baptism in her vow of widowhood, and for the rest of her days spurned
the world, and thought only of the religious life. Have you no fear,
then, lest the Saviour may say to you: “Are you angry, Paula, that your
daughter has become my daughter? Are you vexed at my decree, and do you,
with rebellious tears, grudge me the possession of Blæsilla? You ought
to know what my purpose is both for you and for yours. You deny yourself
food, not to fast but to gratify your grief; and such abstinence is
displeasing to me. Such fasts are my enemies. I receive no soul which
forsakes the body against my will. A foolish philosophy may boast of
martyrs of this kind; it may boast of a Zeno <span
id="fr_819"></span>[820](#fn_819.md) a Cleombrotus, <span
id="fr_820"></span>[821](#fn_820.md) or a Cato. <span
id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821.md) My spirit rests only upon him “that is
poor and of a contrite spirit, and that trembleth at my word. <span
id="fr_822"></span>[823](#fn_822.md) Is this the meaning of your vow to me
that you would lead a religious life? Is it for this that you dress
yourself differently from other matrons, and array yourself in the garb
of a nun? Mourning is for those who wear silk dresses. In the midst of
your tears the call will come, and you, too, must die; yet you flee from
me as from a cruel judge, and fancy that you can avoid falling into my
hands. Jonah, that headstrong prophet, once fled from me, yet in the
depths of the sea he was still mine. <span
id="fr_823"></span>[824](#fn_823.md) If you really believed your daughter
to be alive, you would not grieve that she had passed to a better world.
This is the commandment that I have given you through my apostle, that
you sorrow not for them that sleep, even as the Gentiles, which have no
hope. <span id="fr_824"></span>[825](#fn_824.md) Blush, for you are put to
shame by the example of a heathen. The devil’s handmaid <span
id="fr_825"></span>[826](#fn_825.md) is better than mine. For, while she
imagines that her unbelieving husband has been translated to heaven, you
either do not or will not believe that your daughter is at rest with
me.”

<span id="v.XXXIX-p45"></span>4. Why should I not mourn, you say? Jacob
put on sackcloth for Joseph, and when all his family gathered round him,
refused to be comforted. “I will go down,” he said, “into the grave unto
my son mourning.” <span id="fr_826"></span>[827](#fn_826.md) David also
mourned for Absalom, covering his face, and crying: “O my son,
Absalom…my son, Absalom! Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my
son!” <span id="fr_827"></span>[828](#fn_827.md) Moses, <span
id="fr_828"></span>[829](#fn_828.md) too, and Aaron, <span
id="fr_829"></span>[830](#fn_829.md) and the rest of the saints were
mourned for with a solemn mourning. The answer to your reasoning is
simple. Jacob, it is true, mourned for Joseph, whom he fancied slain,
and thought to meet only in the grave (his words were: “I will go down
into the grave unto my son mourning”), but he only did so because Christ
had not yet broken open the door of paradise, nor quenched with his
blood the flaming sword and the whirling of the guardian cherubim. <span
id="fr_830"></span>[831](#fn_830.md) (Hence in the story of Dives and
Lazarus, Abraham and the beggar, though really in a place of
refreshment, are described as being in hell. <span
id="fr_831"></span>[832](#fn_831) .md) And David, who, after interceding in
vain for the life of his infant child, refused to weep for it, knowing
that it had not sinned, did well to weep for a son who had been a
parricide—in will, if not in deed. <span
id="fr_832"></span>[833](#fn_832.md) And when we read that, for Moses and
Aaron, lamentation was made after ancient custom, this ought not to
surprise us, for even in the Acts of the Apostles, in the full blaze of
the gospel, we see that the brethren at Jerusalem made great lamentation
for Stephen. <span id="fr_833"></span>[834](#fn_833.md) This great
lamentation, however, refers not to the mourners, but to the funeral
procession and to the crowds which accompanied it. This <span
id="page_52">p. 52</span> <span id="v.XXXIX-Page_52"></span>is what the
Scripture says of Jacob: “Joseph went up to bury his father: and with
him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and
all the elders of the land of Egypt, and all the house of Joseph and his
brethren”; and a few lines farther on: “And there went up with him both
chariots and horsemen: and it was a great company.” Finally, “they
mourned with a great and very sore lamentation.” <span
id="fr_834"></span>[835](#fn_834.md) This solemn lamentation does not
impose prolonged weeping upon the Egyptians, but simply describes the
funeral ceremony. In like manner, when we read of weeping made for Moses
and Aaron, <span id="fr_835"></span>[836](#fn_835.md) this is all that is
meant.

<span id="v.XXXIX-p56"></span>I cannot adequately extol the mysteries of
Scripture, nor sufficiently admire the spiritual meaning conveyed in its
most simple words. We are told, for instance, that lamentation was made
for Moses; yet when the funeral of Joshua is described <span
id="fr_836"></span>[837](#fn_836.md) no mention at all is made of weeping.
The reason, of course, is that under Moses—that is under the old Law—all
men were bound by the sentence passed on Adam’s sin, and when they
descended into hell <span id="fr_837"></span>[838](#fn_837.md) were rightly
accompanied with tears. For, as the apostle says, “death reigned from
Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned.” <span
id="fr_838"></span>[839](#fn_838.md) But under Jesus, <span
id="fr_839"></span>[840](#fn_839.md) that is, under the Gospel of Christ,
who has unlocked for us the gate of paradise, death is accompanied, not
with sorrow, but with joy. The Jews go on weeping to this day; they make
bare their feet, they crouch in sackcloth, they roll in ashes. And to
make their superstition complete, they follow a foolish custom of the
Pharisees, and eat lentils, <span id="fr_840"></span>[841](#fn_840.md) to
show, it would seem, for what poor fare they have lost their
birthright. <span id="fr_841"></span>[842](#fn_841.md) Of course they are
right to weep, for as they do not believe in the Lord’s resurrection
they are being made ready for the advent of antichrist. But we who have
put on Christ <span id="fr_842"></span>[843](#fn_842.md) and according to
the apostle are a royal and priestly race, <span
id="fr_843"></span>[844](#fn_843.md) we ought not to grieve for the dead.
“Moses,” the Scripture tells us, “said unto Aaron and unto Eleazar, and
unto Ithamar, his sons that were left: Uncover not your heads, neither
rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the
people.” <span id="fr_844"></span>[845](#fn_844.md) Rend not your clothes,
he says, neither mourn as pagans, lest you die. For, for us sin is
death. In this same book, Leviticus, there is a provision which may
perhaps strike some as cruel, yet is necessary to faith: the high priest
is forbidden to approach the dead bodies of his father and mother, of
his brothers and of his children; <span
id="fr_845"></span>[846](#fn_845.md) to the end, that no grief may distract
a soul engaged in offering sacrifice to God, and wholly devoted to the
Divine mysteries. Are we not taught the same lesson in the Gospel in
other words? Is not the disciple forbidden to say farewell to his home
or to bury his dead father? <span id="fr_846"></span>[847](#fn_846.md) Of
the high priest, again, it is said: “He shall not go out of the
sanctuary, and the sanctification of his God shall not be contaminated,
for the anointing oil of his God is upon him.” <span
id="fr_847"></span>[848](#fn_847.md) Certainly, now that we have believed
in Christ, and bear Him within us, by reason of the oil of His anointing
which we have received, <span id="fr_848"></span>[849](#fn_848.md) we ought
not to depart from His temple—that is, from our Christian profession—we
ought not to go forth to mingle with the unbelieving Gentiles, but
always to remain within, as servants obedient to the will of the Lord.

<span id="v.XXXIX-p70"></span>5. I have spoken plainly, lest you might
ignorantly suppose that Scripture sanctions your grief; and that, if you
err, you have reason on your side. And, so far, my words have been
addressed to the average Christian woman. But now it will not be so. For
in your case, as I well know, renunciation of the world has been
complete; you have rejected and trampled on the delights of life, and
you give yourself daily to fasting, to reading, and to prayer. Like
Abraham, <span id="fr_849"></span>[850](#fn_849.md) you desire to leave
your country and kindred, to forsake Mesopotamia and the Chaldæans, to
enter into the promised land. Dead to the world before your death, you
have spent all your mere worldly substance upon the poor, or have
bestowed it upon your children. I am the more surprised, therefore, that
you should act in a manner which in others would justly call for
reprehension. You call to mind Blæsilla’s companionship, her
conversation, and her endearing ways; and you cannot endure the thought
that you have lost them all. I pardon you the tears of a mother, but I
ask you to restrain your grief. When I think of the parent I cannot
blame you for weeping: but when I think of the Christian and the
recluse, the mother disappears from my view. Your wound is still fresh,
and any touch of mine, however gentle, is more <span id="page_53">p.
53</span> <span id="v.XXXIX-Page_53"></span>likely to inflame than to
heal it. Yet why do you not try to overcome by reason a grief which time
must inevitably assuage? Naomi, fleeing because of famine to the land of
Moab, there lost her husband and her sons. Yet when she was thus
deprived of her natural protectors, Ruth, a stranger, never left her
side. <span id="fr_850"></span>[851](#fn_850.md) And see what a great thing
it is to comfort a lonely woman! Ruth, for her reward, is made an
ancestress of Christ. <span id="fr_851"></span>[852](#fn_851.md) Consider
the great trials which Job endured, and you will see that you are
over-delicate. Amid the ruins of his house, the pains of his sores, his
countless bereavements, and, last of all, the snares laid for him by his
wife, he still lifted up his eyes to heaven, and maintained his patience
unbroken. I know what you are going to say: “All this befell him as a
righteous man, to try his righteousness.” Well, choose which alternative
you please. Either you are holy, in which case God is putting your
holiness to the proof; or else you are a sinner, in which case you have
no right to complain. For if so, you endure far less than your deserts.

<span id="v.XXXIX-p74"></span>Why should I repeat old stories? Listen to
a modern instance. The holy Melanium, <span
id="fr_852"></span>[853](#fn_852.md) eminent among Christians for her true
nobility (may the Lord grant that you and I may have part with her in
His day!), while the dead body of her husband was still unburied, still
warm, had the misfortune to lose at one stroke two of her sons. The
sequel seems incredible, but Christ is my witness that my words are
true. Would you not suppose that in her frenzy she would have unbound
her hair, and rent her clothes, and torn her breast? Yet not a tear fell
from her eyes. Motionless she stood there; then casting herself at the
feet of Christ, she smiled, as though she held Him with her hands.
“Henceforth, Lord,” she said, “I will serve Thee more readily, for Thou
hast freed me from a great burden.” But perhaps her remaining children
overcame her determination. No, indeed; she set so little store by them
that she gave up all that she had to her only son, and then, in spite of
the approaching winter, took ship for Jerusalem.

<span id="v.XXXIX-p76"></span>6. Spare yourself, I beseech you, spare
Blæsilla, who now reigns with Christ; at least spare Eustochium, whose
tender years and inexperience depend on you for guidance and
instruction. Now does the devil rage and complain that he is set at
naught, because he sees one of your children exalted in triumph. The
victory which he failed to win over her that is gone he hopes to obtain
over her who still remains. Too great affection towards one’s children
is disaffection towards God. Abraham gladly prepares to slay his only
son, and do you complain if one child out of several has received her
crown? I cannot say what I am going to say without a groan. When you
were carried fainting out of the funeral procession, whispers such as
these were audible in the crowd. “Is not this what we have often said.
She weeps for her daughter, killed with fasting. She wanted her to marry
again, that she might have grandchildren. How long must we refrain from
driving these detestable monks out of Rome? Why do we not stone them or
hurl them into the Tiber? They have misled this unhappy lady; that she
is not a nun from choice is clear. No heathen mother ever wept for her
children as she does for Blæsilla.” What sorrow, think you, must not
Christ have endured when He listened to such words as these! And how
triumphantly must Satan have exulted, eager as he is to snatch your
soul! Luring you with the claims of a grief which seems natural and
right, and always keeping before you the image of Blæsilla, his aim is
to slay the mother of the victress, and then to fall upon her forsaken
sister. I do not speak thus to terrify you. The Lord is my witness that
I address you now as though I were standing at His judgment seat. Tears
which have no meaning are an object of abhorrence. Yours are detestable
tears, sacrilegious tears, unbelieving tears; for they know no limits,
and bring you to the verge of death. You shriek and cry out as though on
fire within, and do your best to put an end to yourself. But to you and
others like you Jesus comes in His mercy and says: “Why weepest thou?
the damsel is not dead but sleepeth.” <span
id="fr_853"></span>[854](#fn_853.md) The bystanders may laugh him to scorn;
such unbelief is worthy of the Jews. If you prostrate yourself in grief
at your daughter’s tomb you too will hear the chiding of the angel, “Why
seek ye the living among the dead?” <span
id="fr_854"></span>[855](#fn_854.md) It was because Mary Magdalene had done
this that when she recognized the Lord’s voice calling her and fell at
His feet, He said to her: “Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my
Father;” <span id="fr_855"></span>[856](#fn_855.md) that is to say, you are
not worthy to touch, as risen, one whom you suppose still in the tomb.

<span id="v.XXXIX-p80"></span>7. What crosses and tortures, think you,
must not our Blæsilla endure to see Christ <span id="page_54">p.
54</span> <span id="v.XXXIX-Page_54"></span>angry with you, though it be
but a little! At this moment she cries to you as you weep: “If ever you
loved me, mother, if I was nourished at your breast, if I was taught by
your precepts, do not grudge me my exaltation, do not so act that we
shall be separated forever. Do you fancy that I am alone? In place of
you I now have Mary the mother of the Lord. Here I see many whom before
I have not known. My companions are infinitely better than any that I
had on earth. Here I have the company of Anna, the prophetess of the
Gospel; <span id="fr_856"></span>[857](#fn_856.md) and—what should kindle
in you more fervent joy—I have gained in three short months what cost
her the labor of many years to win. Both of us widows indeed, we have
been both rewarded with the palm of chastity. Do you pity me because I
have left the world behind me? It is I who should, and do, pity you who,
still immured in its prison, daily fight with anger, with covetousness,
with lust, with this or that temptation leading the soul to ruin. If you
wish to be indeed my mother, you must please Christ. She is not my
mother who displeases my Lord.” Many other things does she say which
here I pass over; she prays also to God for you. For me, too, I feel
sure, she makes intercession and asks God to pardon my sins in return
for the warnings and advice that I bestowed on her, when to secure her
salvation I braved the ill will of her family.

<span id="v.XXXIX-p82"></span>8. Therefore, so long as breath animates
my body, so long as I continue in the enjoyment of life, I engage,
declare, and promise that Blæsilla’s name shall be forever on my tongue,
that my labors shall be dedicated to her honor, and that my talents
shall be devoted to her praise. No page will I write in which Blæsilla’s
name shall not occur. Wherever the records of my utterance shall find
their way, thither she, too, will travel with my poor writings. Virgins,
widows, monks and priests, as they read, will see how deeply her image
is impressed upon my mind. Everlasting remembrance will make up for the
shortness of her life. Living as she does with Christ in heaven, she
will live also on the lips of men. The present will soon pass away and
give place to the future, and that future will judge her without
partiality and without prejudice. As a childless widow she will occupy a
middle place between Paula, the mother of children, and Eustochium the
virgin. In my writings she will never die. She will hear me conversing
of her always, either with her sister or with her mother.
