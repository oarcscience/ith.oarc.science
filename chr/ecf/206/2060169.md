<span id="vi.vi.I-p1"></span> <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.vi.I-p1.1"></span>Against Jovinianus.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.I-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="vi.vi.I-p3"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="vi.vi.I-p3.1"></span>Book I.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.I-p4"></span>Jovinianus, concerning whom we know little
more than is to be found in the two following books, had published at
Rome a Latin treatise containing all, or part of the opinions here
controverted, viz. (1) “That a virgin is no better as such than a wife
in the sight of God. (2) Abstinence is no better than a thankful
partaking of food. (3) A person baptized with the Spirit as well as with
water cannot sin. (4) All sins are equal. (5) There is but one grade of
punishment and one of reward in the future state.” In addition to this
he held the birth of our Lord to have been by a “true parturition,” and
was thus at issue with the orthodoxy of the time, according to which the
infant Jesus passed through the walls of the womb as His Resurrection
body afterwards did out of the tomb or through the closed doors.
Pammachius, Jerome’s friend, brought Jovinian’s book under the notice of
Siricius, bishop of Rome, and it was shortly afterwards condemned in
synods at that city and at Milan (about <span class="c17"><span
id="vi.vi.I-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span> 390). He subsequently sent
Jovinian’s books to Jerome, who answered them in the present treatise in
the year 393. Nothing more is known of Jovinian, but it has been
conjectured from Jerome’s remark in the treatise against Vigilantius,
where Jovinian is said to have “amidst pheasants and pork rather belched
out than breathed out his life,” and by a kind of transmigration to have
transmitted his opinions into Vigilantius, that he had died before 409,
the date of that work.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p5"></span>The first book is wholly on the first
proposition of Jovinianus, that relating to marriage and virginity. The
first three chapters are introductory. The rest may be divided into
three parts:

<span id="vi.vi.I-p6"></span>1 (ch. 4–13). An exposition, in Jerome’s
sense, of St. Paul’s teaching in [1 Cor.
vii](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#000.md)<span id="vi.vi.I-p6.1"></span>.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p7"></span>2 (ch. 14–39). A statement of the teaching
which Jerome derives from the various books of both the Old and the New
Testaments.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p8"></span>3. A denunciation of Jovinianus (c. 40),
and the praises of virginity and of single marriages derived from
examples in the heathen world.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p9"></span>The treatise gives a remarkable specimen of
Jerome’s system of interpreting Scripture, and also of the methods by
which asceticism was introduced into the Church, and marriage brought
into disesteem.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p10"></span>1. Very few days have elapsed since the
holy brethren of Rome sent to me the treatises of a certain Jovinian
with the request that I would reply to the follies contained in them,
and would crush with evangelical and apostolic vigour the <span
id="fr_4253"></span>[4254](#fn_4253.md) Epicurus of Christianity. I read
but could not in the least comprehend them. I began therefore to give
them closer attention, and to thoroughly sift not only words and
sentences, but almost every single syllable; for I wished first to
ascertain his meaning, and then to approve, or refute what he had said.
But the style is so barbarous, and the language so vile and such a heap
of blunders, that I could neither understand what he was talking about,
nor by what arguments he was trying to prove his points. At one moment
he is all bombast, at another he grovels: from time to time he lifts
himself up, and then like a wounded snake finds his own effort too much
for him. Not satisfied with the language of men, he attempts something
loftier.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p12"></span> <span
id="fr_4254"></span>[4255](#fn_4254.md) “The mountains labour; a poor mouse
is born.”

<span id="vi.vi.I-p14"></span> <span
id="fr_4255"></span>[4256](#fn_4255.md) “That he’s gone mad ev’n mad
Orestes swears.”

<span id="vi.vi.I-p16"></span>Moreover he involves everything in such
inextricable confusion that the saying of <span
id="fr_4256"></span>[4257](#fn_4256.md) Plautus might be applied to
him:—“This is what none but a Sibyl will ever read.”

<span id="vi.vi.I-p20"></span>To understand him we must be prophets. We
read Apollo’s <span id="fr_4257"></span>[4258](#fn_4257.md) raving
prophetesses. We remember, too, what <span
id="fr_4258"></span>[4259](#fn_4258.md) Virgil says of senseless <span
id="page_347">p. 347</span> <span
id="vi.vi.I-Page_347"></span>noise. <span
id="fr_4259"></span>[4260](#fn_4259.md) Heraclitus, also, surnamed the
Obscure, the philosophers find hard to understand even with their utmost
toil. But what are they compared with our riddle-maker, whose books are
much more difficult to comprehend than to refute? Although (we must
confess) the task of refuting them is no easy one. For how can you
overcome a man when you are quite in the dark as to his meaning? But,
not to be tedious to my reader, the introduction to his second book, of
which he has discharged himself like a sot after a night’s debauch, will
show the character of his eloquence, and through what bright flowers of
rhetoric he takes his stately course.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p24"></span>2. “I respond to your invitation, not that
I may go through life with a high reputation, but may live free from
idle rumour. I beseech the ground, the young shoots of our plantations,
the plants and trees of tenderness snatched from the whirlpool of vice,
to grant me audience and the support of many listeners. We know that the
Church through hope, faith, charity, is inaccessible and impregnable. In
it no one is immature: all are apt to learn: none can force a way into
it by violence, or deceive it by craft.”

<span id="vi.vi.I-p25"></span>3. What, I ask, is the meaning of these
portentous words and of this grotesque description? Would you not think
he was in a feverish dream, or that he was seized with madness and ought
to be put into the strait jacket which Hippocrates prescribed? However
often I read him, even till my heart sinks within me, I am still in
uncertainty of his meaning. <span id="fr_4260"></span>[4261](#fn_4260.md)
Everything starts from, everything depends upon, something else. It is
impossible to make out any connection; and, excepting the proofs from
Scripture which he has not dared to exchange for his own lovely flowers
of rhetoric, his words suit all matter equally well, because they suit
no matter at all. This circumstance led me shrewdly to suspect that his
object in proclaiming the excellence of marriage was only to disparage
virginity. For when the less is put upon a level with the greater, the
lower profits by comparison, but the higher suffers wrong. For
ourselves, we do not follow the views of <span
id="fr_4261"></span>[4262](#fn_4261.md) Marcion and Manichæus, and
disparage marriage; nor, deceived by the error of <span
id="fr_4262"></span>[4263](#fn_4262.md) Tatian, the leader of the
Encratites, do we think all intercourse impure; he condemns and rejects
not only marriage but also food which God created for the use of man. We
know that in a great house, there are not only vessels of gold and
silver, but also of wood and earthenware. And that upon the foundation,
Christ, which Paul the master-builder laid, some build gold, silver,
precious stones: others, on the contrary, hay, wood, straw. We are not
ignorant of the words, <span id="fr_4263"></span>[4264](#fn_4263.md)
“Marriage is honourable among all, and the bed undefiled.” We have read
God’s first command, <span id="fr_4264"></span>[4265](#fn_4264.md) “Be
fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth”; but while we honour
marriage we prefer virginity which is the offspring of marriage. Will
silver cease to be silver, if gold is more precious than silver? Or is
despite done to tree and corn, if we prefer the fruit to root and
foliage, or the grain to stalk and ear? Virginity is to marriage what
fruit is to the tree, or grain to the straw. Although the hundred-fold,
the sixty-fold, and the thirty-fold spring from one earth and from one
sowing, yet there is a great difference in respect of number. The
thirty-fold has reference to marriage. The very way the <span
id="fr_4265"></span>[4266](#fn_4265.md) fingers are combined—see how they
seem to embrace, tenderly kiss, and pledge their troth either to
other—is a picture of husband and wife. The sixty-fold applies to
widows, because they are placed in a position of difficulty and
distress. Hence the upper finger signifies their depression, and the
greater the difficulty in resisting the allurements of pleasure once
experienced, the greater the reward. Moreover (give good heed, my
reader), to denote a hundred, the right hand is used instead of the
left: a circle is made with the same fingers which on the left hand
represented widowhood, and thus the crown of virginity is expressed. In
saying this I have followed my own impatient spirit rather than the
course of the argument. For I had scarcely left harbour, and had barely
hoisted sail, when a swelling tide of words suddenly swept me into the
depths of the discussion. I must stay my course, and take in canvas for
a little while; nor will I indulge my sword, anxious as it is to strike
a blow for virginity. The farther back the catapult is drawn, the
greater the force of the missile. To linger is not to lose, if by
lingering victory is better assured. I will briefly set forth our
adversary’s views, and will drag them out from <span id="page_348">p.
348</span> <span id="vi.vi.I-Page_348"></span>his books like snakes from
the holes where they hide, and will separate the venomous head from the
writhing body. What is baneful shall be discovered, that, when we have
the power, it may be crushed.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p32"></span>He says that “virgins, widows, and married
women, who have been once passed through the laver of Christ, if they
are on a par in other respects, are of equal merit.”

<span id="vi.vi.I-p33"></span>He endeavours to show that “they who with
full assurance of faith have been born again in baptism, cannot be
overthrown by the devil.”

<span id="vi.vi.I-p34"></span>His third point is “that there is no
difference between abstinence from food, and its reception with
thanksgiving.”

<span id="vi.vi.I-p35"></span>The fourth and last is “that there is one
reward in the kingdom of heaven for all who have kept their baptismal
vow.”

<span id="vi.vi.I-p36"></span>4. This is the hissing of the old serpent;
by counsel such as this the dragon drove man from Paradise. For he
promised that if they would prefer fulness to fasting they should be
immortal, as though it were an impossibility for them to fall; and while
he promises they shall be as Gods, he drives them from Paradise, with
the result that they who, while naked and unhampered, and as virgins
unspotted enjoyed the fellowship of the Lord were cast down into the
vale of tears, and sewed skins together to clothe themselves withal.
But, not to detain the reader any longer, I will keep to the division
given above and taking his propositions one by one will rely chiefly on
the evidence of Scripture to refute them, for fear he may chatter and
complain that he was overcome by rhetorical skill rather than by force
of truth. If I succeed in this and with the aid of a cloud of witnesses
from both Testaments prove too strong for him, I will then accept his
challenge, and adduce illustrations from secular literature. I will show
that even among philosophers and distinguished statesmen, the virtuous
are wont to be preferred by all to the voluptuous, that is to say men
like <span id="fr_4266"></span>[4267](#fn_4266.md) Pythagoras, <span
id="fr_4267"></span>[4268](#fn_4267.md) Plato and <span
id="fr_4268"></span>[4269](#fn_4268.md) Aristides, to <span
id="fr_4269"></span>[4270](#fn_4269.md) Aristippus, <span
id="fr_4270"></span>[4271](#fn_4270.md) Epicurus and <span
id="fr_4271"></span>[4272](#fn_4271.md) Alcibiades. I entreat virgins of
both sexes and all such as are continent, the married also and the twice
married, to assist my efforts with their prayers. Jovinian is the common
enemy. For he who maintains all to be of equal merit, does no less
injury to virginity in comparing it with marriage than he does to
marriage, when he allows it to be lawful, but to the same extent as
second and third marriages. But to digamists and trigamists also he does
wrong, for he places on a level with them whoremongers and the most
licentious persons as soon as they have repented; but perhaps those who
have been married twice or thrice ought not to complain, for the same
whoremonger if penitent is made equal in the kingdom of heaven even to
virgins. I will therefore explain more clearly and in proper sequence
the arguments he employs and the illustrations he adduces respecting
marriage, and will treat them in the order in which he states them. And
I beg the reader not to be disturbed if he is compelled to read
Jovinian’s nauseating trash. He will all the more gladly drink Christ’s
antidote after the devil’s poisonous concoction. Listen with patience,
ye virgins; listen, I pray you, to the voice of the most voluptuous of
preachers; nay rather close your ears, as you would to the Syren’s
fabled songs, and pass on. For a little while endure the wrongs you
suffer: think you are crucified with Christ, and are listening to the
blasphemies of the Pharisees.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p43"></span>5. First of all, he says, God declares
that <span id="fr_4272"></span>[4273](#fn_4272.md) “therefore shall a man
leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and
they shall be one flesh.” And lest we should say that this is a
quotation from the Old Testament, he asserts that it has been <span
id="fr_4273"></span>[4274](#fn_4273.md) confirmed by the Lord in the
Gospel—“What God hath joined together, let not man put asunder”: and he
immediately adds, <span id="fr_4274"></span>[4275](#fn_4274.md) “Be
fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.” He next repeats the
names of Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalalel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah,
Lamech, Noah, and tells us that they all had wives and in accordance
with the will of God begot sons, as though there could be any table of
descent or any history of mankind without wives and children. “There,”
says he, “is Enoch, who walked with God and was carried up to heaven.
There is Noah, the only person who, except his wife, and his sons and
their wives, was saved at the deluge, although there must have been many
persons not of marriageable age, and therefore presumably virgins.
Again, after the deluge, when the human race started as it were anew,
men and women were paired together and a fresh blessing was pronounced
on procreation, <span id="page_349">p. 349</span> <span
id="vi.vi.I-Page_349"></span> <span id="fr_4275"></span>[4276](#fn_4275.md)
“Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.” Moreover, free
permission was given to eat flesh, <span
id="fr_4276"></span>[4277](#fn_4276.md) “Every moving thing that liveth
shall be food for you; as the green herb have I given you all.” He then
flies off to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, of whom the first had three
wives, the second one, the third four, Leah, Rachel, Billah, and Zilpah,
and he declares that Abraham by his faith merited the blessing which he
received in begetting his son. Sarah, typifying the Church, when it had
ceased to be with her after the manner of women, exchanged the curse of
barrenness for the blessing of child-bearing. We are informed that
Rebekah went like a prophet to inquire of the Lord, and was told, <span
id="fr_4277"></span>[4278](#fn_4277.md) “Two nations and two peoples are in
thy womb,” that Jacob served for his wife, and that when Rachel,
thinking it was in the power of her husband to give her children,
said, <span id="fr_4278"></span>[4279](#fn_4278.md) “Give me children, or
else I die,” he replied, <span id="fr_4279"></span>[4280](#fn_4279.md) “Am
I in God’s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?” so
well aware was he that the fruit of marriage cometh from the Lord and
not from the husband. We next learn that Joseph, a holy man of spotless
chastity, and all the patriarchs, had wives, and that God blessed them
all alike through the lips of Moses. Judah also and Thamar are brought
upon the scene, and he censures Onan, slain by the Lord, because he,
grudging to raise up seed to his brother, marred the marriage rite. He
refers to Moses and the leprosy of Miriam, who, because she chided her
brother on account of his wife, was stricken by the avenging hand of
God. He praises Samson, I may even say extravagantly panegyrizes the
uxorious Nazarite. Deborah also and Barak are mentioned, because,
although they had not the benefit of virginity, they were victorious
over the iron chariots of Sisera and Jabin. He brings forward Jael, the
wife of Heber the Kenite, and extols her for arming herself with
the <span id="fr_4280"></span>[4281](#fn_4280.md) stake. He says there was
no difference between Jephthah and his virgin daughter, who was
sacrificed to the Lord: nay, of the two, he prefers the faith of the
father to that of the daughter who met death with grief and tears. He
then comes to Samuel, another Nazarite of the Lord, who from infancy was
brought up in the tabernacle and was clad in a linen ephod, or, as the
words are rendered, *in linen vestments:* he, too, we are told, begot
sons without a stain upon his priestly purity. He places Boaz and his
wife Ruth side by side in his repository, and traces the descent of
Jesse and David from them. He then points out how David himself, for the
price of two hundred foreskins and at the peril of his life, was bedded
with the king’s daughter. What shall I say of Solomon, whom he includes
in the list of husbands, and represents as a type of the Saviour,
maintaining that of him it was written, <span
id="fr_4281"></span>[4282](#fn_4281.md) “Give the king thy judgments, O
God, and thy righteousness unto the king’s son”? And <span
id="fr_4282"></span>[4283](#fn_4282.md) “To him shall be given of the gold
of Sheba, and men shall pray for him continually.” Then all at once he
makes a jump to Elijah and Elisha, and tells us as a great secret that
the spirit of Elijah rested on Elisha. Why he mentioned this he does not
say. It can hardly be that he thinks Elijah and Elisha, like the rest,
were married men. The next step is to Hezekiah, upon whose praises he
dwells, and yet (I wonder why) forgets to mention that he said, <span
id="fr_4283"></span>[4284](#fn_4283.md) “Henceforth I will beget children.”
He relates that Josiah, a righteous man, in whose time the book of
Deuteronomy was found in the temple, was instructed by Huldah, wife of
Shallum. Daniel also and the three youths are classed by him with the
married. Suddenly he betakes himself to the Gospel, and adduces
Zachariah and Elizabeth, Peter and his father-in-law, and the rest of
the Apostles. His inference is thus expressed: “If they idly urge in
defence of themselves the plea that the world in its early stage needed
to be replenished, let them listen to the words of Paul, <span
id="fr_4284"></span>[4285](#fn_4284.md) ‘I desire therefore that the
younger widows marry, bear children.’ And <span
id="fr_4285"></span>[4286](#fn_4285.md) ‘Marriage is honourable and the bed
undefiled.’ And <span id="fr_4286"></span>[4287](#fn_4286.md) ‘A wife is
bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be
dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.’
And <span id="fr_4287"></span>[4288](#fn_4287.md) ‘Adam was not beguiled,
but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression: but she
shall be saved through the child-bearing, if they continue in faith and
love and sanctification with sobriety.’ Surely we shall hear no more of
the famous Apostolic utterance, <span
id="fr_4288"></span>[4289](#fn_4288.md) ‘And they who have wives as though
they had them not.’ It can hardly be that you will say the reason why he
wished them to be married was that some widows had already turned back
after Satan: as though virgins never fell and their fall was not more
ruinous. All this makes it clear that in forbidding to marry, and to eat
food which God created for use, you have consciences seared as with a
hot iron, and are followers of the Manichæans.” Then comes much more
which it would be unprofitable to discuss. At last he dashes into
rhetoric and apostrophizes virginity thus: “I do you no wrong, Virgin:
you have chosen a life of chastity on account of the present distress:
you determined on <span id="page_350">p. 350</span> <span
id="vi.vi.I-Page_350"></span>the course in order to be holy in body and
spirit: be not proud: you and your married sisters are members of the
same Church.”

<span id="vi.vi.I-p61"></span>6. I have perhaps explained his position
at too great a length, and become tedious to my reader; but I thought it
best to draw up in full array against myself all his efforts, and to
muster all the forces of the enemy with their squadrons and generals,
lest after an early victory there should spring up a series of other
engagements. I will not therefore do battle with single foes, nor will I
be satisfied with skirmishes in which I meet small detachments of my
opponents. The battle must be fought with the whole army of the enemy,
and the disorderly rabble, fighting more like brigands than soldiers,
must be repulsed by the skill and method of regular warfare. In the
front rank I will set the Apostle Paul, and, since he is the bravest of
generals, will arm him with his own weapons, that is to say, his own
statements. For the Corinthians asked many questions about this matter,
and the doctor of the Gentiles and master of the Church gave full
replies. What he decreed we may regard as the law of Christ speaking in
him. At the same time, when we begin to refute the several arguments, I
trust the reader will give me his attention even before the Apostle
speaks, and will not, in his eagerness to discuss the most weighty
points, neglect the premises, and rush at once to the conclusion.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p62"></span>7. Among other things the Corinthians
asked in their letter whether after embracing the faith of Christ they
ought to be unmarried, and for the sake of continence put away their
wives, and whether believing virgins were at liberty to marry. And
again, supposing that one of two Gentiles believed on Christ, whether
the one that believed should leave the one that believed not? And in
case it were allowable to take wives, would the Apostle direct that only
Christian wives, or Gentiles also, should be taken? Let us then consider
Paul’s replies to these inquiries. <span
id="fr_4289"></span>[4290](#fn_4289.md) “Now concerning the things whereof
ye wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman. But, because of
fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have
her own husband. Let the husband render unto the wife her due: and
likewise also the wife unto the husband. The wife hath not power over
her own body, but the husband: And likewise also the husband hath not
power over his own body, but the wife. Defraud ye not one the other,
except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto
prayer, and may be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of
your incontinency. But this I say by way of permission not of
commandment. Yet I would that all men were even as I myself. Howbeit
each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another
after that. But I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for
them if they abide even as I. But if they have not continency, let them
marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.” Let us turn back to the
chief point of the evidence: “It is good,” he says, “for a man not to
touch a woman.” If it is good not to touch a woman, it is bad to touch
one: for there is no opposite to goodness but badness. But if it be bad
and the evil is pardoned, the reason for the concession is to prevent
worse evil. But surely a thing which is only allowed because there may
be something worse has only a slight degree of goodness. He would never
have added “let each man have his own wife,” unless he had previously
used the words “but, because of fornications.” Do away with fornication,
and he will not say “let each man have his own wife.” Just as though one
were to lay it down: “It is good to feed on wheaten bread, and to eat
the finest wheat flour,” and yet to prevent a person pressed by hunger
from devouring cow-dung, I may allow him to eat barley. Does it follow
that the wheat will not have its peculiar purity, because such an one
prefers barley to excrement? That is naturally good which does not admit
of comparison with what is bad, and is not eclipsed because something
else is preferred. At the same time we must notice the Apostle’s
prudence. He did not say, it is good not to have a wife: but, it is good
not to touch a woman: as though there were danger even in the touch: as
though he who touched her, would not escape from her who “hunteth for
the precious life,” who causeth the young man’s understanding to fly
away. <span id="fr_4290"></span>[4291](#fn_4290.md) “Can a man take fire in
his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Or can one walk upon hot
coals, and his feet not be scorched?” As then he who touches fire is
instantly burned, so by the mere touch the peculiar nature of man and
woman is perceived, and the difference of sex is understood. Heathen
fables relate how <span id="fr_4291"></span>[4292](#fn_4291.md) Mithras
and <span id="fr_4292"></span>[4293](#fn_4292.md) Ericthonius were begotten
of the soil, in stone or earth, by raging lust. Hence it was that our
Joseph, because the Egyptian woman wished to touch him, fled from her
hands, and, as if he had been bitten by a mad dog and feared the
spreading poison, <span id="page_351">p. 351</span> <span
id="vi.vi.I-Page_351"></span>threw away the cloak which she had touched.
“But, because of fornications let each man have his own wife, and let
each woman have her own husband.” He did not say, because of fornication
let each man marry a wife: otherwise by this excuse he would have thrown
the reins to lust, and whenever a man’s wife died, he would have to
marry another to prevent fornication, but “have his own wife.” Let him
he says have and use his own wife, whom he had before he became a
believer, and whom it would have been good not to touch, and, when once
he became a follower of Christ, to know only as a sister, not as a wife
unless fornication should make it excusable to touch her. “The wife hath
not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the
husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife.” The whole
question here concerns those who are married men. Is it lawful for them
to do what our Lord forbade in the Gospel, and to put away their wives?
Whence it is that the Apostle says, “It is good for a man not to touch a
woman.” But inasmuch as he who is once married has no power to abstain
except by mutual consent, and may not reject an unoffending partner, let
the husband render unto the wife her due. He bound himself voluntarily
that he might be under compulsion to render it. “Defraud ye not one the
other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves
unto prayer.” What, I pray you, is the quality of that good thing which
hinders prayer? which does not allow the body of Christ to be received?
So long as I do the husband’s part, I fail in continency. The same
Apostle in another place commands us to pray always. If we are to pray
always, it follows that we must never be in the bondage of wedlock, for
as often as I render my wife her due, I cannot pray. The Apostle Peter
had experience of the bonds of marriage. See how he fashions the Church,
and what lesson he teaches Christians: <span
id="fr_4293"></span>[4294](#fn_4293.md) “Ye husbands in like manner dwell
with your wives according to knowledge, giving honour unto the woman, as
unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life;
to the end that your prayers be not hindered.” Observe that, as S. Paul
before, because in both cases the spirit is the same, so S. Peter now,
says that prayers are hindered by the performance of marriage duty. When
he says “likewise,” he challenges the husbands to imitate their wives,
because he has already given them commandment: <span
id="fr_4294"></span>[4295](#fn_4294.md) “beholding your chaste conversation
coupled with fear. Whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of
plaiting the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on
apparel: but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible
apparel of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of
great price.” You see what kind of wedlock he enjoins. Husbands and
wives are to dwell together according to knowledge, so that they may
know what God wishes and desires, and give honour to the weak vessel,
woman. If we abstain from intercourse, we give honour to our wives: if
we do not abstain, it is clear that insult is the opposite of honour. He
also tells the wives to let their husbands “see their chaste behaviour,
and the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible apparel of a meek
and quiet spirit.” Words truly worthy of an apostle, and of Christ’s
rock! He lays down the law for husbands and wives, condemns outward
ornament, while he praises continence, which is the ornament of the
inner man, as seen in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet
spirit. In effect he says this: Since your outer man is corrupt, and you
have ceased to possess the blessing of incorruption characteristic of
virgins, at least imitate the incorruption of the spirit by subsequent
abstinence, and what you cannot show in the body exhibit in the mind.
For these are the riches, and these the ornaments of your union, which
Christ seeks.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p69"></span>8. The words which follow, “that ye may
give yourselves unto prayer, and may be together again,” might lead one
to suppose that the Apostle was expressing a wish and not making a
concession because of the danger of a greater fall. He therefore at once
adds, “lest Satan tempt you for your incontinency.” It is a fine
permission which is conveyed in the words “be together again.” What it
was that he blushed to call by its own name, and thought only better
than a temptation of Satan and the effect of incontinence, we take
trouble to discuss as if it were obscure, although he has explained his
meaning by saying, “this I say by way of permission, not by way of
command.” And do we still hesitate to speak of marriage as a concession
to weakness, not a thing commanded, as though second and third marriages
were not allowed on the same ground, as though the doors of the Church
were not opened by repentance even to fornicators, and what is more, to
the incestuous? Take the case of the man who outraged his step-mother.
Does not the Apostle, after delivering him, in his first Epistle to the
Corinthians, to Satan for the destruction of the flesh that his spirit
might be saved, in the second Epistle take the offender back and strive
to prevent a brother from being swallowed up by overmuch grief. The
Apostle’s wish is one thing, his pardon another. If a wish be ex<span
id="page_352">p. 352</span> <span id="vi.vi.I-Page_352"></span>pressed,
it confers a right; if a thing is only called pardonable, we are wrong
in using it. If you wish to know the Apostle’s real mind, you must take
in what follows: “but I would that all men were as I am.” Happy is the
man who is like Paul! Fortunate is he who attends to the Apostle’s
command, not to his concession. This, says he, I wish, this I desire
that ye be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ, who was a Virgin
born of a Virgin, uncorrupt of her who was uncorrupt. We, because we are
men, cannot imitate our Lord’s nativity; but we may at least imitate His
life. The former was the blessed prerogative of divinity, the latter
belongs to our human condition and is part of human effort. I would that
all men were like me, that while they are like me, they may also become
like Christ, to whom I am like. For <span
id="fr_4295"></span>[4296](#fn_4295.md) “he that believeth in Christ ought
himself also to walk even as He walked.” <span
id="fr_4296"></span>[4297](#fn_4296.md) “Howbeit each man hath his own gift
from God, one after this manner, and another after that.” What I wish,
he says, is clear. But since in the Church there is a diversity of
gifts, I acquiesce in marriage, lest I should seem to condemn nature. At
the same time consider, that the gift of virginity is one, that of
marriage, another. For were the reward the same for the married and for
virgins, he would never after enjoining continence have said: <span
id="fr_4297"></span>[4298](#fn_4297.md) “Each man hath his own gift from
God, one after this manner, and another after that.” Where there is a
distinction in one particular, there is a diversity also in other
points. I grant that even marriage is a gift of God, but between gift
and gift there is great diversity. In fact the Apostle himself speaking
of the same person who had repented of his incestuous conduct,
says: <span id="fr_4298"></span>[4299](#fn_4298.md) “so that contrariwise
ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, and to whom ye forgive
anything, I forgive also.” And that we might not think a man’s gift
contemptible, he added, <span id="fr_4299"></span>[4300](#fn_4299.md) “for
what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes
have I forgiven it, in the presence of Christ.” There is diversity in
the gifts of Christ. Hence it is that by way of type Joseph has a coat
of many colours. And in the forty-fifth psalm we read, <span
id="fr_4300"></span>[4301](#fn_4300.md) “at thy right hand doth stand the
queen in a vesture of gold wrought about with divers colours.” And the
Apostle Peter says, <span id="fr_4301"></span>[4302](#fn_4301.md) “as heirs
together of the manifold grace of God,” where the more expressive Greek
word <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.vi.I-p76.2"></span>ποικίλης</span>, i.e., *varied*, is used.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p77"></span>9. Then come the words <span
id="fr_4302"></span>[4303](#fn_4302.md) “But I say to the unmarried and to
widows, it is good for them if they abide even as I. But if they have
not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.”
Having conceded to married persons the enjoyment of wedlock and pointed
out his own wishes, he passes on to the unmarried and to widows, sets
before them his own practice for imitation, and calls them happy if they
so abide. “But if they have not continency, let them marry,” just as he
said before “But because of fornications,” and “Lest Satan tempt you,
because of your incontinency.” And he gives a reason for saying “If they
have not continency, let them marry,” viz. “It is better to marry than
to burn.” The reason why it is better to marry is that it is worse to
burn. Let burning lust be absent, and he will not say it is better to
marry. The word *better* always implies a comparison with something
worse, not a thing absolutely good and incapable of comparison. It is as
though he said, it is better to have one eye than neither, it is better
to stand on one foot and to support the rest of the body with a stick,
than to crawl with broken legs. What do you say, Apostle? I do not
believe you when you say “Though I be rude in speech, yet am I not in
knowledge.” As humility is the source of the sayings “For I am not
worthy to be called an Apostle,” and “To me who am the least of the
Apostles,” and “As to one born out of due time,” so here also we have an
utterance of humility. You know the meaning of language, or you would
not quote <span id="fr_4303"></span>[4304](#fn_4303.md) Epimenides, <span
id="fr_4304"></span>[4305](#fn_4304.md) Menander, and <span
id="fr_4305"></span>[4306](#fn_4305.md) Aratus. When you are discussing
continence and virginity you say, “It is good for a man not to touch a
woman.” And, “It is good for them if they abide even as I.” And, “I
think that this is good by reason of the present distress.” And, “That
it is good for a man so to be.” When you come to marriage, you do not
say it is good to marry, because you cannot then add “*than to burn;*”
but you say, “It is better to marry than to burn.” If marriage in itself
be good, do not compare it with fire, but simply say “It is good to
marry.” I suspect the goodness of that thing which is forced into the
position of being only the lesser of two evils. What I want is not a
smaller evil, but a thing absolutely good.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p82"></span>10. So far the first section has been
explained. Let us now come to those which follow. <span
id="fr_4306"></span>[4307](#fn_4306.md) “But unto the married I give
charge, yea not I, but the Lord. That the wife depart not from her
husband (but and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be
reconciled to her husband): and that the husband leave not his wife. But
to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving
wife, and she is content to dwell <span id="page_353">p. 353</span>
<span id="vi.vi.I-Page_353"></span>with him, let him not leave her,” and
so on to the words “As God hath called each, so let him walk. And so
ordain I in all the churches.” This passage has no bearing on our
present controversy. For he ordains, according to the mind of the Lord,
that excepting the cause of fornication, a wife must not be put away,
and that a wife who has been put away, may not, so long as her husband
lives, be married to another, or at all events that her duty is to be
reconciled to her husband. But in the case of those who are already
married at the time of conversion, that is to say, supposing one of the
two were a believer, he enjoins that the believer shall not put away the
unbeliever. And after stating his reason, *viz.,* that the unbeliever
who is unwilling to leave the believer becomes thereby a candidate for
the faith, he commands, on the other hand, that if the unbeliever reject
the faithful one on account of the faith of Christ, the believer ought
to depart, lest husband or wife be preferred to Christ, in comparison
with Whom we must hold even life itself cheap. Yet at the present day
many women despising the Apostle’s command, are joined to heathen
husbands, and prostitute the temples of Christ to idols. They do not
understand that they are part of His body though indeed they are His
ribs. The Apostle is lenient to the union of unbelievers, who having
(believing) husbands, afterwards come to believe in Christ. He does not
extend his indulgence to those women who, although Christians, have been
married to heathen husbands. To these he elsewhere says, <span
id="fr_4307"></span>[4308](#fn_4307.md) “Be not unequally yoked with
unbelievers: for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? or
what communion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ
with Belial? or what portion hath a believer with an unbeliever? And
what agreement hath a temple of God with idols? For we are a temple of
the living God.” Although I know that crowds of matrons will be furious
against me: although I know that just as they have shamelessly despised
the Lord, so they will rave at me who am but a flea and the least of
Christians: yet I will speak out what I think. I will say what the
Apostle has taught me, that they are not on the side of righteousness,
but of iniquity: not of light, but of darkness: that they do not belong
to Christ, but to Belial: that they are not temples of the living God,
but shrines and idols of the dead. And, if you wish to see more clearly
how utterly unlawful it is for a Christian woman to marry a Gentile,
consider what the same Apostle says, <span
id="fr_4308"></span>[4309](#fn_4308.md) “A wife is bound for so long time
as her husband liveth: but if the husband be dead, she is free to be
married to whom she will; only in the Lord,” that is, to a Christian. He
who allows second and third marriages in the Lord, forbids first
marriages with a Gentile. Whence Abraham also makes his servant swear
upon his thigh, that is, on Christ, Who was to spring from his seed,
that he would not bring an alien-born as a wife for his son Isaac. And
Ezra checked an offence of this kind against God by making his
countrymen put away their wives. And the prophet Malachi thus
speaks, <span id="fr_4309"></span>[4310](#fn_4309.md) “Judah hath dealt
treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in
Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the Lord which he
loveth, and hath married the daughter of a strange god. The Lord will
cut off the man that doeth this, <span
id="fr_4310"></span>[4311](#fn_4310.md) him that teacheth and him that
learneth, out of the tents of Jacob, and him that offers an offering
unto the Lord of hosts.” I have said this that they who compare marriage
with virginity, may at least know that such marriages as these are on a
lower level than digamy and trigamy.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p88"></span>11. In the above discussion the Apostle
has taught that the believer ought not to depart from the unbeliever,
but remain in marriage as the faith found them, and that each man
whether married or single should continue as he was when baptized into
Christ; and then he suddenly introduces the metaphors of circumcision
and uncircumcision, of bond and free, and under those metaphors treats
of the married and unmarried. <span id="fr_4311"></span>[4312](#fn_4311.md)
“Was any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised.
Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing: but the keeping
of the commandments of God. Let each man abide in that calling wherein
he was called. Wast thou called being a bondservant? Care not for it:
but even if thou canst become free, use it rather. For he that was
called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord’s freedman; likewise
he that was called, being free, is Christ’s bondservant. Ye were bought
with a price; become not bondservants of men. Brethren, let each man,
wherein he was called, therein abide with God.” Some, I suppose, will
find fault with the Apostle’s way of reasoning. I would therefore ask
first, What we are to infer from his suddenly passing in a discussion
concerning husbands and wives to a comparison of Jew and Gentile, bond
and free, and then returning, when this point is settled, to the
question about virgins, and telling us “Concerning virgins I have no
commandment from the Lord”; what has a comparison of Jew and Gentile,
bond and free, to do with wedlock and virginity? In the next <span
id="page_354">p. 354</span> <span id="vi.vi.I-Page_354"></span>place,
how are we to understand the words “Hath any been called in
uncircumcision, let him not be circumcised”? <span
id="fr_4312"></span>[4313](#fn_4312.md) Can a man who has lost his foreskin
restore it again at his pleasure? Then, in what sense are we to explain
“For he that was called in the Lord, being a bondservant, is the Lord’s
freedman: likewise he that was called, being free, is Christ’s
bondservant.” Fourthly, how is it that he who commanded servants to obey
their masters according to the flesh, now says, “Become not bondservants
of men.” Lastly, how are we to connect with slavery, or with
circumcision, his saying “Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called,
therein abide with God,” which even contradicts his previous opinion. We
heard him say “Become not bondservants of men.” How can we then possibly
abide in that vocation wherein we were called, when many at the time
they became believers had masters according to the flesh, whose
bondservants they are now forbidden to be? Moreover, what has the
argument about our abiding in the vocation wherein we were called, to do
with circumcision? for in another place the same Apostle cries aloud
“Behold I Paul tell you that, if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit
you nothing”? We must conclude, therefore, that a higher meaning should
be given to circumcision and uncircumcision, bond and free, and that
these words must be taken in close connection with what has gone before.
“Was anyone called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised.”
If, he says, at the time you were called and became a believer in
Christ, if I say, you were called being circumcised from a wife, that
is, unmarried, do not marry a wife, that is, do not become
uncircumcised, lest you lay upon the freedom of circumcision and
chastity the burden of marriage. Again, if anyone was called in
uncircumcision, let him not be circumcised. You had a wife, he says,
when you believed: do not think the faith of Christ a reason for
disagreement, because God called us in peace. <span
id="fr_4313"></span>[4314](#fn_4313.md) “Circumcision is nothing, and
uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God.”
For neither celibacy nor marriage availeth anything without works, since
even faith, which is specially characteristic of Christians, if it have
not works, is said to be dead, and vestal virgins and Juno’s widows
might upon these terms be numbered with the saints. “Let each man in the
vocation wherein he was called, therein abide.” Whether he had, or had
not, a wife when he believed, let him remain in that condition in which
he was when called. Accordingly he does not so strongly urge virgins to
be married, as forbid divorce. And as he debars those who have wives
from putting them away, so he cuts off from virgins the power of being
married. “Thou wast called being a slave, heed it not; but even if thou
canst become free, use it rather.” Even if you have, he says, a wife,
and are bound to her, and pay her due, and have not power over your own
body; or if, to speak more clearly, you are the bondservant of your
wife, be not sad upon that account, nor sigh for the loss of your
virginity. But even if you can find some causes of discord, do not, for
the sake of thoroughly enjoying the liberty of chastity, seek your own
welfare by destroying another. Keep your wife awhile, and do not go too
fast for her lagging footsteps: wait till she follows. If you are
patient, your spouse will become a sister, “For he that was called in
the Lord, being a bondservant, is the Lord’s freedman: likewise, he that
was called being free, is Christ’s bondservant.” He gives his reasons
for not wishing wives to be forsaken. He therefore says, I command that
Gentiles who believe on Christ do not abandon the married state in which
they were before embracing the faith: for he who had a wife when he
became a believer, is not so strictly devoted to the service of God as
virgins and unmarried persons. But, in a manner, he has more freedom,
and the reins of his bondage are relaxed; and, while he is the
bondservant of a wife, he is, so to speak, the freedman of the Lord.
Moreover, he who when called by the Lord had not a wife and was free
from the bondage of wedlock, he is truly Christ’s bondservant. What
happiness to be the bondservant, not of a wife but of Christ, to serve
not the flesh, but the spirit! <span
id="fr_4314"></span>[4315](#fn_4314.md) “For he who is joined unto the Lord
is one spirit.” There was some fear that by saying “Wast thou called
being a bondservant? Care not for it: but, even if thou canst become
free, use it rather,” he might seem to have flouted continence, and to
have given us up to the slavery of marriage. He therefore makes a remark
which removes all cavil: “Ye were bought with a price, become not
servants of men.” We have been redeemed with the most precious blood of
Christ: the Lamb was slain for us, and having been sprinkled with hyssop
and the warm drops of His blood, we have rejected poisonous pleasure.
Why do we at whose baptism Pharaoh died and all his host was drowned,
again turn back in our hearts to Egypt, and after the manna, angels’
food, sigh for the garlic and the onions and the cucumbers, and
Pharaoh’s meat?

<span id="vi.vi.I-p93"></span><span id="page_355">p. 355</span> <span
id="vi.vi.I-Page_355"></span>12. Having discussed marriage and
continency he at length comes to virginity and says <span
id="fr_4315"></span>[4316](#fn_4315.md) “Now concerning virgins I have no
commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgement, as one that hath
obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. I think therefore that this
is good by reason of the present distress, namely, that it is good for a
man to be as he is.” Here our opponent goes utterly wild with
exultation: this is his strongest battering-ram with which he shakes the
wall of virginity. “See,” says he, “the Apostle confesses that as
regards virgins he has no commandment of the Lord, and he who had with
authority laid down the law respecting husbands and wives, does not dare
to command what the Lord has not enjoined. And rightly too. For what is
enjoined is commanded, what is commanded must be done, and that which
must be done implies punishment if it be not done. For it is useless to
order a thing to be done and yet leave the individual free to do it or
not do it. If the Lord had commanded virginity He would have seemed to
condemn marriage, and to do away with the seed-plot of mankind, of which
virginity itself is a growth. If He had cut off the root, how was He to
expect fruit? If the foundations were not first laid, how was He to
build the edifice, and put on the roof to cover all! Excavators toil
hard to remove mountains; the bowels of the earth are pierced in the
search for gold. And, when the tiny particles, first by the blast of the
furnace, then by the hand of the cunning workman have been fashioned
into an ornament, men do not call him blessed who has separated the gold
from the dross, but him who wears the beautiful gold. Do not marvel then
if, placed as we are, amid temptations of the flesh and incentives to
vice, the angelic life be not exacted of us, but merely recommended. If
advice be given, a man is free to proffer obedience; if there be a
command, he is a servant bound to compliance. “I have no commandment,”
he says, “of the Lord: but I give my judgement, as one that hath
obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.” If you have no commandment
of the Lord, how dare you give judgement without orders? The Apostle
will reply: Do you wish me to give orders where the Lord has offered a
favour rather than laid down a law? The great Creator and Fashioner,
knowing the weakness of the vessel which he made, left virginity open to
those whom He addressed; and shall I, the teacher of the Gentiles, who
have become all things to all men that I might gain all, shall I lay
upon the necks of weak believers from the very first the burden of
perpetual chastity? Let them <span id="fr_4316"></span>[4317](#fn_4316.md)
begin with short periods of release from the marriage bond, and give
themselves unto prayer, that when they have tasted the sweets of
chastity they may desire the perpetual possession of that wherewith they
were temporarily delighted. The Lord, when tempted by the Pharisees, and
asked whether according to the law of Moses it was permitted to put away
a wife, forbade the practice altogether. After weighing His words the
disciples said to Him: <span id="fr_4317"></span>[4318](#fn_4317.md) “If
the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.
But He said unto them, all men cannot receive this saying, but they to
whom it is given. For there are eunuchs, which were so born from their
mother’s womb: and there are eunuchs, which were made eunuchs by men:
and there are eunuchs, which made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of
heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.” The
reason is plain why the Apostle said, “concerning virgins I have no
commandment of the Lord.” Surely; because the Lord had previously said
“All men cannot receive the word, but they to whom it is given,” and “He
that is able to receive it, let him receive it.” <span
id="fr_4318"></span>[4319](#fn_4318.md) The Master of the Christian race
offers the reward, invites candidates to the course, holds in His hand
the prize of virginity, points to the fountain of purity, and cries
aloud <span id="fr_4319"></span>[4320](#fn_4319.md) “If any man thirst, let
him come unto me and drink.” “He that is able to receive it, let him
receive it.” He does not say, you must drink, you must run, willing or
unwilling: but whoever is willing and able to run and to drink, he shall
conquer, he shall be satisfied. And therefore Christ loves virgins more
than others, because they willingly give what was not commanded them.
And it indicates greater grace to offer what you are not bound to give,
than to render what is exacted of you. The apostles, contemplating the
burden of a wife, exclaimed, “If the case of the man is so with his
wife, it is not expedient to marry.” Our Lord thought well of their
view. You rightly think, said He, that it is not expedient for a man who
is hastening to the kingdom of heaven to take a wife: but it is a hard
matter, and all men do not receive the saying, but they to whom it has
been given. Some are eunuchs by nature, others by the violence of men.
Those eunuchs please Me who are such not of necessity, but of free
choice. Willingly do I take them into my bosom who have made themselves
eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake, and in order to worship Me
<span id="page_356">p. 356</span> <span
id="vi.vi.I-Page_356"></span>have renounced the condition of their
birth. We must now explain the words, “Those who have made themselves
eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake.” If they who have made
themselves eunuchs have the reward of the kingdom of heaven, it follows
that they who have not made themselves such cannot be placed with those
who have. He who is able, he says, to receive it, let him receive it. It
is a mark of great faith and of great virtue, to be the pure temple of
God, to offer oneself a whole burnt-offering, and, according to the same
apostle, to be holy both in body and in spirit. These are the eunuchs,
who thinking themselves dry trees because of their impotence, hear by
the mouth of <span id="fr_4320"></span>[4321](#fn_4320.md) Isaiah that they
have a place prepared in heaven for sons and daughters. Their type
is <span id="fr_4321"></span>[4322](#fn_4321.md) Ebed-melech the eunuch in
Jeremiah, and the eunuch of Queen Candace in the <span
id="fr_4322"></span>[4323](#fn_4322.md) Acts of the Apostles, who on
account of the strength of his faith gained the name of a *man.* These
are they to whom Clement, who was the successor of the Apostle Peter,
and of whom the Apostle Paul makes mention, wrote letters, directing
almost the whole of his discourse to the subject of virgin purity. After
them there is a long series of apostolic men, martyrs, and men
illustrious no less for holiness than for eloquence, with whom we may
very easily become acquainted through their own writings. <span
id="fr_4323"></span>[4324](#fn_4323.md) “I think, therefore,” he says,
“that this is good for the present distress.” What is this distress
which, in contempt of the marriage tie, longs for the liberty of
virginity? <span id="fr_4324"></span>[4325](#fn_4324.md) “Woe unto them
that are with child and to them that give suck in those days.” We have
not here a condemnation of harlots and brothels, of whose damnation
there is no doubt, but of the swelling womb, and wailing infancy, the
fruit as well as the work of marriage. “For it is good for a man so to
be.” If it is good for a man so to be, it is bad for a man not so to
be. <span id="fr_4325"></span>[4326](#fn_4325.md) “Art thou bound unto a
wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a
wife.” Each one of us has his appointed bounds; let me have what is
mine, and keep your own. If thou art bound to a wife, give her not a
bill of divorce. If I am loosed from a wife, I will not seek a wife. As
I do not dissolve marriages once contracted: so you should not bind what
is loosed. And at the same time the meaning of the words must be taken
into account. He who has a wife is regarded as a debtor, and is said to
be uncircumcised, to be the servant of his wife, and like bad servants
to be *bound.* But he who has no wife, in the first place owes no man
anything, then is circumcised, thirdly is free, lastly, is loosed.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p105"></span>13. Let us run through the remaining
points, for our author is so voluminous that we cannot linger over every
detail. “But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned.” It is one thing
not to sin, another to do good. “And if a virgin marry, she hath not
sinned.” Not that virgin who has once for all dedicated herself to the
service of God: for, should one of these marry, she will have damnation,
because she has made of no account her first faith. But, if our
adversary objects that this saying relates to widows, we reply that it
applies with still greater force to virgins, since marriage is forbidden
even to widows whose previous marriage had been lawful. For virgins who
marry after consecration are rather incestuous than adulterous. And, for
fear he should by saying, “And if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned,”
again stimulate the unmarried to be married, he immediately checks
himself, and by introducing another consideration, invalidates his
previous concession. “Yet,” says he, “such shall have tribulation in the
flesh.” Who are they who shall have tribulation in the flesh? They to
whom he had before indulgently said “But and if thou marry, thou hast
not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet such shall
have tribulation in the flesh.” We in our inexperience thought that
marriage had at least the joys of the flesh. But if they who are married
have tribulation even in the flesh, which is imagined to be the sole
source of their pleasure, what else is there to marry for, when in the
spirit, and in the mind, and in the flesh itself there is tribulation.
“But I would spare you.” Thus, he says, I allege tribulation as a
motive, as though there were not greater obligations to refrain. “But
this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those
that have wives may be as though they had none.” I am by no means now
discussing virgins, of whose happiness no one entertains a doubt. I am
coming to the married. The time is short, the Lord is at hand. Even
though we lived nine hundred years, as did men of old, yet we ought to
think that short which must one day have an end, and cease to be. But,
as things are, and it is not so much the joy as the tribulation of
marriage that is short, why do we take wives whom we shall soon be
compelled to lose? <span id="fr_4326"></span>[4327](#fn_4326.md) “And those
that weep, and those that rejoice, and those that buy, and those that
use the world, as though they wept not, as though they rejoiced not, as
though they bought not, as though they did not use the world: for the
fashion of this world passeth <span id="page_357">p. 357</span> <span
id="vi.vi.I-Page_357"></span>away.” If the world, which comprehends all
things, passes away, yea if the fashion and intercourse of the world
vanishes like the clouds, amongst the other works of the world, marriage
too will vanish away. For after the resurrection there will be no
wedlock. But if death be the end of marriage, why do we not voluntarily
embrace the inevitable? And why do we not, encouraged by the hope of the
reward, offer to God that which must be wrung from us against our will.
“He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may
please the Lord: but he that is married is careful for the things of the
world, how he may please his wife, and is <span
id="fr_4327"></span>[4328](#fn_4327.md) divided.” Let us look at the
difference between the cares of the virgin, and those of the married
man. The virgin longs to please the Lord, the husband to please his
wife, and that he may please her he is careful for the things of the
world, which will of course pass away with the world. “And he is
divided,” that is to say, is distracted with manifold cares and
miseries. This is not the place to describe the difficulties of
marriage, and to revel in rhetorical commonplaces. I think I delivered
myself fully as regards this point in my argument against <span
id="fr_4328"></span>[4329](#fn_4328.md) Helvidius, and in the book which I
addressed to <span id="fr_4329"></span>[4330](#fn_4329.md) Eustochium. At
all events <span id="fr_4330"></span>[4331](#fn_4330.md) Tertullian, while
still a young man, gave himself full play with this subject. And my
teacher, <span id="fr_4331"></span>[4332](#fn_4331.md) Gregory of
Nazianzus, discussed virginity and marriage in some Greek verses. I now
briefly beg my reader to note that in the Latin manuscripts we have the
reading “there is a difference also between the virgin and the wife.”
The words, it is true, have a meaning of their own, and have by me, as
well as by others, been so explained as showing the bearing of the
passage. Yet they lack apostolic authority, since the Apostle’s words
are as we have translated them—“He is careful for the things of the
world, how he may please his wife, <span
id="fr_4332"></span>[4333](#fn_4332.md) and he is divided.” Having laid
down this, he passes to the virgins and the continent, and says “The
woman that is unmarried and a virgin thinks of the things of the Lord,
that she may be holy in body and in spirit.” Not every unmarried woman
is also a virgin. But every virgin is of course unmarried. It may be,
that regard for elegance of expression led him to repeat the same idea
by means of another word and speak of “a woman unmarried and a virgin”;
or at least he may have wished to give to “unmarried” the definite
meaning of “virgin,” so that we might not suppose him to include
harlots, united to no one by the fixed bonds of wedlock, among the
“unmarried.” Of what, then, does she that is unmarried and a virgin
think? “The things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in
spirit.” Supposing there were nothing else, and that no greater reward
followed virginity, this would be motive enough for her choice, to think
of the things of the Lord. But he immediately points out the contents of
her thought—that she may be holy both in body and spirit. For there are
virgins in the flesh, not in the spirit, whose body is intact, their
soul corrupt. But that virgin is a sacrifice to Christ, whose mind has
not been defiled by thought, nor her flesh by lust. On the other hand,
she who is married thinks of the things of the world, how she may please
her husband. Just as the man who has a wife is anxious for the things of
the world, how he may please his wife, so the married woman thinks of
the things of the world, how she may please her husband. But we are not
of this world, which lieth in wickedness, the fashion of which passeth
away, and concerning which the Lord said to the Apostles, <span
id="fr_4333"></span>[4334](#fn_4333.md) “If ye were of the world, the world
would love its own.” And lest perchance someone might suppose that he
was laying the heavy burden of chastity on unwilling shoulders, he at
once adds his reasons for persuading to it, and says: <span
id="fr_4334"></span>[4335](#fn_4334.md) “And this I say for your profit;
not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and
that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.” The Latin words
do not convey the meaning of the Greek. What words shall we use to
render <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.vi.I-p114.2"></span>Πρὸς τὸ
εὔσχημον κὰι εὐπρόσεδρον τῷ Κυρί& 251· ἀπερισπάστως</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.vi.I-p114.3"></span>́̈</span> The difficulty
of translation accounts for the fact that the clause is completely
wanting in Latin manuscripts. Let us, however, use the passage as we
have translated it. The Apostle does not lay a snare upon us, nor does
he compel us to be what we do not wish to be; but he gives his advice as
to what is fair and seemly, he would have us attend upon the Lord and
ever be anxious about that service, and await the Lord’s will, so that
like active and well-armed soldiers we may obey orders, and may do so
without distraction, which, according to <span
id="fr_4335"></span>[4336](#fn_4335.md) Ecclesiastes, is given to the men
of this world that they may be exercised thereby. But if anyone
considers that his virgin, that is, his flesh, is wanton and boiling
with lust, and cannot be <span id="page_358">p. 358</span> <span
id="vi.vi.I-Page_358"></span>bridled, and he must do one of two things,
either take a wife or fall, let him do what he will, he does not sin if
he marry. Let him do, he says, what he will, not what he ought. He does
not sin if he marry a wife; yet, he does not well if he marry: <span
id="fr_4336"></span>[4337](#fn_4336.md) “But he that standeth stedfast in
his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching his own will,
and hath determined this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin, shall
do well. So then both he that giveth his own virgin in marriage doeth
well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better.” With
marked propriety he had previously said “He who marries a wife does not
sin”: here he tells us “He that keepeth his own virgin doeth well.” But
it is one thing not to sin, another to do well. <span
id="fr_4337"></span>[4338](#fn_4337.md) “Depart from evil,” he says, “and
do good.” The former we forsake, the latter we follow. In this last lies
perfection. But whereas he says “and he that giveth his virgin in
marriage doeth well,” it might be supposed that our remark does not hold
good; he therefore forthwith detracts from this seeming good and puts it
in the shade by comparing it with another, and saying, “and he that
giveth her not in marriage shall do better.” If he had not intended to
draw the inference of doing better, he would never have previously
referred to doing well. But where there is something good and something
better, the reward is not in both cases the same, and where the reward
is not one and the same, there of course the gifts are different. The
difference, then, between marriage and virginity is as great as that
between not sinning and doing well; nay rather, to speak less harshly,
as great as between good and better.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p118"></span>14. He has ended his discussion of
wedlock and virginity, and has carefully steered between the two
precepts without turning to the right hand or to the left. He has
followed the royal road and fulfilled the command <span
id="fr_4338"></span>[4339](#fn_4338.md) not to be righteous over much. Now
again he compares monogamy with digamy, and as he had subordinated
marriage to virginity, so he makes second marriages inferior to first,
and says, <span id="fr_4339"></span>[4340](#fn_4339.md) “A wife is bound
for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she
is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord. But she is
happier if she abide as she is, after my judgement: and I think that I
also have the Spirit of God.” He allows second marriages, but to such
persons as wish for them and are not able to contain; lest, <span
id="fr_4340"></span>[4341](#fn_4340.md) having “waxed wanton against
Christ,” they desire to marry, “having condemnation, because they have
rejected their first faith;” and he makes the concession because many
had already turned aside after Satan. <span
id="fr_4341"></span>[4342](#fn_4341.md) “But,” says he, “they will be
happier if they abide as they are,” and he immediately adds the weight
of Apostolic authority, “after my judgement.” And that an Apostle’s
authority might not, like that of an ordinary man, be without weight, he
added, “and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.” When he incites
to continence, it is not by the judgement or spirit of man, but by the
judgement and Spirit of God; when, however, he grants the indulgence of
marriage, he does not mention the Spirit of God, but weighs his
judgement with wisdom, and adapts the severity of the strain to the
weakness of the individual. In this sense we must take the whole of the
following passage: <span id="fr_4342"></span>[4343](#fn_4342.md) “For the
woman that hath a husband is bound by law to the husband while he
liveth; but if the husband die, she is discharged from the law of the
husband. So then if, while the husband liveth, she be joined to another
man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if the husband die, she is
free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she be joined to
another man.” And similarly the words to Timothy, <span
id="fr_4343"></span>[4344](#fn_4343.md) “I desire therefore that the
younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, give none
occasion to the adversary for reviling: for already some are turned
aside after Satan,” and so on. For as on account of the danger of
fornication he allows virgins to marry, and makes that excusable which
in itself is not desirable, so to avoid this same fornication, he allows
second marriages to widows. For it is better to know a single husband,
though he be a second or third, than to have many paramours: that is, it
is more tolerable for a woman to prostitute herself to one man than to
many. At all events this is so if the Samaritan woman in John’s Gospel
who said she had her sixth husband was reproved by the Lord because he
was not her husband. For where there are more husbands than one the
proper idea of a husband, who is a single person, is destroyed. At the
beginning one rib was turned into one wife. “And they two,” he says,
“shall be one flesh”: not three, or four; otherwise, how can they be any
longer two, if they are several. Lamech, a man of blood and a murderer,
was the first who divided one flesh between two wives. Fratricide and
digamy were abolished by the same punishment—that of the deluge. The one
was avenged seven times, the other seventy times seven. The guilt is as
widely different as are the numbers. What the holiness of second
marriage is, appears from this—that <span id="page_359">p. 359</span>
<span id="vi.vi.I-Page_359"></span>a person twice married <span
id="fr_4344"></span>[4345](#fn_4344.md) cannot be enrolled in the ranks of
the clergy, and so the Apostle tells Timothy, <span
id="fr_4345"></span>[4346](#fn_4345.md) “Let none be enrolled as a widow
under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man.” The whole
command concerns those widows who are supported on the alms of the
Church. The age is therefore limited, so that those only may receive the
food of the poor who can no longer work. And at the same time, consider
that she who has had two husbands, even though she be a widow, decrepit,
and in want, is not a worthy recipient of the Church’s funds. But if she
be deprived of the bread of charity, how much more is she deprived of
that bread which cometh down from heaven, and of which if a man eat
unworthily, he shall be guilty of outrage offered to the body and the
blood of Christ?

<span id="vi.vi.I-p127"></span>15. The passages, however, which I have
adduced in support of my position and in which it is permitted to
widows, if they so desire, to marry again, are interpreted by some
concerning those widows who had lost their husbands and were found in
that condition when they became Christians. For, supposing a person
baptized and her husband dead, it would not be consistent if the Apostle
were to bid her marry another, when he enjoins even those who have wives
to be as though they had them not. And this is why the number of wives
which a man may take is not defined, because when Christian baptism has
been received, even though a third or a fourth wife has been taken, she
is reckoned as the first. Otherwise, if, after baptism and after the
death of a first husband, a second is taken why should not a sixth after
the death of the second, third, fourth, and fifth, and so on? For it is
possible, that through some strange misfortune, or by the judgement of
God cutting short repeated marriages, a young woman may have several
husbands, while an old woman may be left a widow by her first husband in
extreme age. The first Adam was married once: the second was unmarried.
Let the supporters of second marriages shew us as their leader a third
Adam who was twice married. But granted that Paul allowed second
marriages: upon the same grounds it follows that he allows even third
and fourth marriages, or a woman may marry as often as her husband dies.
The Apostle was forced to choose many things which he did not like. He
circumcised Timothy, and shaved his own head, practised going barefoot,
let his hair grow long, and cut it at Cenchrea. And he had certainly
chastised the Galatians, and blamed Peter because for the sake of Jewish
observances he separated himself from the Gentiles. As then in other
points connected with the discipline of the Church he was a Jew to Jews,
a Gentile to Gentiles, and was made all things to all men, that he might
gain all: so too he allowed second marriages to incontinent persons, and
did not limit the number of marriages, in order that women, although
they saw themselves permitted to take a second husband, in the same way
as a third or a fourth was allowed, might blush to take a second, lest
they should be compared to those who were three or four times married.
If more than one husband be allowed, it makes no difference whether he
be a second or a third, because there is no longer a question of single
marriage. <span id="fr_4346"></span>[4347](#fn_4346.md) “All things are
lawful, but not all things are expedient.” I do not condemn second, nor
third, nor, pardon the expression, eighth marriages: I will go still
further and say that I welcome even a penitent whoremonger. Things that
are equally lawful must be weighed in an even balance.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p129"></span>16. But he takes us to the Old Testament,
and beginning with Adam goes on to Zacharias and Elizabeth. He next
confronts us with Peter and the rest of the Apostles. We are therefore
bound to traverse the same course of argument and show that chastity was
always preferred to the condition of marriage. And as regards Adam and
Eve we must maintain that before the fall they were virgins in Paradise:
but after they sinned, and were cast out of Paradise, they were
immediately married. Then we have the passage, <span
id="fr_4347"></span>[4348](#fn_4347.md) “For this cause shall a man leave
his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and the twain shall
become one flesh,” in explanation of which the Apostle straightway
adds, <span id="fr_4348"></span>[4349](#fn_4348.md) “This mystery is great,
but I speak in regard of Christ, and of the Church.” Christ in the flesh
is a virgin, in the spirit he is once married. For he has one Church,
concerning which the same Apostle says, <span
id="fr_4349"></span>[4350](#fn_4349.md) “Husbands, love your wives, even as
Christ also loved the Church.” If Christ loves the Church holily,
chastely, and without spot, let husbands also love their wives in
chastity. And let everyone know how to possess his vessel in
sanctification and honour, not in the lust of concupiscence, as the
Gentiles who know not God: <span id="fr_4350"></span>[4351](#fn_4350.md)
“For God called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification: seeing
that ye have put off the old man with his doings, and have <span
id="page_360">p. 360</span> <span id="vi.vi.I-Page_360"></span>put on
the new man, which is being renewed unto knowledge after the image of
him that created him: where there cannot be male and female, Greek and
Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman,
freeman: but Christ is all, and in all.” The link of marriage is not
found in the image of the Creator. When difference of sex is done away,
and we are putting off the old man, and putting on the new, then we are
being born again into Christ a virgin, who was both born of a virgin,
and is born again through <span id="fr_4351"></span>[4352](#fn_4351.md)
virginity. And whereas he says “Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish
the earth,” it was necessary first to plant the wood and to let it grow,
so that there might be an after-growth for cutting down. And at the same
time we must bear in mind the meaning of the phrase, “replenish the
earth.” Marriage replenishes the earth, virginity fills Paradise. This
too we must observe, at least if we would faithfully follow the Hebrew,
that while Scripture on the first, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth days
relates that, having finished the works of each, “God saw that it was
good,” on the second day it omitted this altogether, leaving us to
understand that two is not a good number because it destroys unity, and
prefigures the marriage compact. Hence it was that all the animals which
Noah took into the ark by pairs were unclean. Odd numbers denote
cleanness. And yet by the double number is represented another mystery:
that not even in beasts and unclean birds is second marriage approved.
For unclean animals went in two and two, and clean ones by sevens, so
that Noah after the flood might be able to immediately offer to God
sacrifices from the latter.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p135"></span>17. But if Enoch was translated, and Noah
was preserved at the deluge, I do not think that Enoch was translated
because he had a wife, but because he was <span
id="fr_4352"></span>[4353](#fn_4352.md) the first to call upon God and to
believe in the Creator; and the Apostle Paul fully instructs us
concerning him in the Epistle to the Hebrews. Noah, moreover, who was
preserved as a kind of second root for the human race, must of course be
preserved together with his wife and sons, although in this there is a
Scripture mystery. The ark, <span id="fr_4353"></span>[4354](#fn_4353.md)
according to the Apostle Peter, was a type of the Church, in which eight
souls were saved. When Noah entered into it, both he and his sons were
separated from their wives; but when he landed from it, they united in
pairs, and what had been separated in the ark, that is, in the Church,
was joined together in the intercourse of the world. And at the same
time if the ark had many compartments and little chambers, and was made
with second and third stories, and was filled with different beasts, and
was furnished with dwellings, great or small, according to the kind of
animal, I think all this diversity in the compartments was a figure of
the manifold character of the Church.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p138"></span>18. He raises the objection that when God
gave his second blessing, permission was granted to eat flesh, which had
not in the first benediction been allowed. He should know that just as
divorce according to the Saviour’s word was not permitted from the
beginning, but on account of the hardness of our heart was a concession
of Moses to the human race, so too the eating of flesh was unknown until
the deluge. But after the deluge, like the quails given in the desert to
the murmuring people, the poison of flesh-meat was offered to our teeth.
The Apostle writing to the Ephesians <span
id="fr_4354"></span>[4355](#fn_4354.md) teaches that God had purposed in
the fulness of time to sum up and renew in Christ Jesus all things which
are in heaven and in earth. Whence also the Saviour himself in the
Revelation of John says, <span id="fr_4355"></span>[4356](#fn_4355.md) “I
am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending.” At the beginning of
the human race we neither ate flesh, nor gave bills of divorce, nor
suffered circumcision for a sign. Thus we reached the deluge. But after
the deluge, together with the giving of the law which no one could
fulfil, flesh was given for food, and divorce was allowed to
hard-hearted men, and the knife of circumcision was applied, as though
the hand of God had fashioned us with something superfluous. But once
Christ has come in the end of time, and Omega passed into Alpha and
turned the end into the beginning, we are no longer allowed divorce, nor
are we circumcised, nor do we eat flesh, for the Apostle says, <span
id="fr_4356"></span>[4357](#fn_4356.md) “It is good not to eat flesh, nor
to drink wine.” For wine as well as flesh was consecrated after the
deluge.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p142"></span>19. What shall I say of Abraham who had
three wives, as Jovinianus says, and received circumcision as a sign of
his faith? If we follow him in the number of his wives, let us also
follow him in circumcision. We must not partly follow, partly reject
him. Isaac, moreover, the husband of one wife, Rebecca, prefigures the
Church of Christ, and reproves the wantonness of second marriage. And if
Jacob had two pairs of wives and concubines, and our opponent will not
admit that blear-eyed Leah, ugly and prolific, was a type of the
synagogue, but that Rachel, beautiful and long barren, indicated the
mystery of the Church, let me remind him that when Jacob did this <span
id="page_361">p. 361</span> <span id="vi.vi.I-Page_361"></span>thing he
was among the Assyrians, and in Mesopotamia in bondage to a hard master.
But when he wished to enter the holy land, he raised on Mount
Galeed <span id="fr_4357"></span>[4358](#fn_4357.md) the heap of witness,
in token that the lord of Mesopotamia had failed to find anything among
his baggage, and there swore that he would never return to the place of
his bondage; and when, <span id="fr_4358"></span>[4359](#fn_4358.md) after
wrestling with the angel at the brook Jabbok, he began to limp, because
the great muscle of his thigh was withered, he at once gained the name
of Israel. <span id="fr_4359"></span>[4360](#fn_4359.md) Then the wife whom
he once loved, and for whom he had served, was slain by the son of
sorrow near Bethlehem which was destined to be the birthplace of our
Lord, the herald of virginity: and the intimacies of Mesopotamia died in
the land of the Gospel.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p146"></span>20. But I wonder why he set <span
id="fr_4360"></span>[4361](#fn_4360.md) Judah and Tamar before us for an
example, unless perchance even harlots give him pleasure; or <span
id="fr_4361"></span>[4362](#fn_4361.md) Onan who was slain because he
grudged his brother seed. Does he imagine that we approve of any sexual
intercourse except for the procreation of children? As regards Moses, it
is clear that he would have been in peril at the inn, if <span
id="fr_4362"></span>[4363](#fn_4362.md) Sephora which is by interpretation
*a bird,* had not circumcised her son, and cut off the foreskin of
marriage with the knife which prefigured the Gospel. This is that Moses
who when he saw a great vision and heard an angel, or the Lord speaking
in the bush, <span id="fr_4363"></span>[4364](#fn_4363.md) could not by any
means approach to him without first loosing the latchet of his shoe,
that is, putting off the bonds of marriage. And we need not be surprised
at this in the case of one who was a prophet, lawgiver, and the friend
of God, seeing that all the people when about to draw nigh to Mount
Sinai, and to hear the voice speaking to them, were commanded to
sanctify themselves in three days, and keep themselves from their wives.
I am out of order in violating historical sequence, but I may point out
that the same thing was said by <span
id="fr_4364"></span>[4365](#fn_4364.md) Ahimelech the priest to David when
he fled to Nob: “If only the young men have kept themselves from women.”
And David answered, “of a truth about these three days.” For the
shew-bread, like the body of Christ, might not be eaten by those who
rose from the marriage bed. And in passing we ought to consider the
words “if only the young men have kept themselves from women.” The truth
is that, in view of the purity of the body of Christ, all sexual
intercourse is unclean. In the law also it is enjoined that the <span
id="fr_4365"></span>[4366](#fn_4365.md) high priest must not marry any but
a virgin, nor must he take to wife a widow. If a virgin and a widow are
on the same level, how is it that one is taken, the other
rejected? <span id="fr_4366"></span>[4367](#fn_4366.md) And the widow of a
priest is bidden abide in the house of her father, and not to contract a
second marriage. <span id="fr_4367"></span>[4368](#fn_4367.md) If the
sister of a priest dies in virginity, just as the priest is commanded to
go to the funeral of his father and mother, so must he go to hers. But
if she be married, she is despised as though she belonged not to him. He
who has <span id="fr_4368"></span>[4369](#fn_4368.md) married a wife, and
he who has planted a vineyard, an image of the propagation of children,
is forbidden to go to the battle. For he who is the slave of his wife
cannot be the Lord’s soldier. And the laver in the tabernacle was cast
from the mirrors of the women who <span
id="fr_4369"></span>[4370](#fn_4369.md) fasted, signifying the bodies of
pure virgins: And within, <span id="fr_4370"></span>[4371](#fn_4370.md) in
the sanctuary, both cherubim, and mercy-seat, and the ark of the
covenant, and the table of shew-bread, and the candle-stick, and the
censer, were made of the purest gold. For silver might not be brought
into the holy of holies.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p158"></span>21. I must not linger over Moses when my
purpose is at full speed to lightly touch on each topic and to sketch
the outline of a proper knowledge of my subject. I will pass to Joshua
the son of Nun, who was previously called *Ause,* or better, as in the
Hebrew, *Osee,* that is, *Saviour*. For he, <span
id="fr_4371"></span>[4372](#fn_4371.md) according to the epistle of Jude,
saved the people of Israel and led them forth out of Egypt, and brought
them into the land of promise. As soon as this Joshua <span
id="fr_4372"></span>[4373](#fn_4372.md) reached the Jordan, the waters of
marriage, which had ever flowed in the land, dried up and stood in one
heap; and the whole people, barefooted and on dry ground, crossed over,
and came to Gilgal, and there was a second time circumcised. If we take
this literally, it cannot possibly stand. For if we had two foreskins,
or if another could grow after the first was cut off, there would be
room for speaking of a second circumcision. But the meaning is that
Joshua circumcised the people who had crossed the desert, with the
Gospel knife, and he circumcised them with a stone <span
id="page_362">p. 362</span> <span id="vi.vi.I-Page_362"></span>knife,
that what in the case of Moses’ son was prefigured in a few might under
Joshua be fulfilled in all. Moreover, the very foreskins were heaped
together and buried, and covered with earth, and the fact that the
reproach of Egypt was taken away, and the name of the place, *Gilgal,*
which is by interpretation <span id="fr_4373"></span>[4374](#fn_4373.md)
*revelation,* show that while the people wandered in the desert
uncircumcised their eyes were blinded. Let us see what follows. After
this Gospel circumcision and the consecration of twelve stones at the
place of revelation, the Passover was immediately celebrated, a lamb was
slain for them, and they ate the food of the Holy Land. Joshua went
forth, and was met by the Prince of the host, sword in hand, that is
either to shew that he was ready to fight for the circumcised people, or
to sever the tie of marriage. And in the same way that Moses was
commanded, so was he: <span id="fr_4374"></span>[4375](#fn_4374.md) “loose
thy shoe, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.” For if
the armed host of the Lord was represented by the trumpets of the
priests, we may see in Jericho a type of the overthrow of the world by
the preaching of the Gospel. And to pass over endless details (for it is
not my purpose now to unfold all the mysteries of the Old
Testament), <span id="fr_4375"></span>[4376](#fn_4375.md) five kings who
previously reigned in the land of promise, and opposed the Gospel army,
were overcome in battle with Joshua. I think it is clearly to be
understood that before the Lord led his people from Egypt and
circumcised them, sight, smell, taste, hearing, and touch had the
dominion, and that to these, as to five princes, everything was subject.
And when they <span id="fr_4376"></span>[4377](#fn_4376.md) took refuge in
the cave of the body and in a place of darkness, Jesus entered the body
itself and slew them, that the source of their power might be the
instrument of their death.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p165"></span>22. But it is now time for us to raise
the standard of Joshua’s chastity. It is written that Moses had a wife.
Now Moses is interpreted both by our Lord and by the Apostle to mean the
law: <span id="fr_4377"></span>[4378](#fn_4377.md) “They have Moses and the
prophets.” And <span id="fr_4378"></span>[4379](#fn_4378.md) “Death reigned
from Adam until Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the
likeness of Adam’s transgression.” And no one doubts that in both
passages Moses signifies the law. We read that Moses, that is the law,
had a wife: shew me then in the same way that Joshua the son of Nun had
either wife or children, and if you can do so, I will confess that I am
beaten. He certainly received the fairest spot in the division of the
land of Judah, and died, not in the *twenties*, which are ever unlucky
in Scripture—by them are reckoned the years of <span
id="fr_4379"></span>[4380](#fn_4379.md) Jacob’s service, <span
id="fr_4380"></span>[4381](#fn_4380.md) the price of Joseph, and <span
id="fr_4381"></span>[4382](#fn_4381.md) sundry presents which Esau who was
fond of them received—but in the <span
id="fr_4382"></span>[4383](#fn_4382.md) *tens,* whose praises we have often
sung; and he was buried in <span id="fr_4383"></span>[4384](#fn_4383.md)
*Thamnath Sare,* that is, *most perfect sovereignty,* or among those *of
a new covering,* to signify the crowds of virgins, covered by the
Saviour’s aid on Mount Ephraim, that is, the *fruitful mountain;* on the
north of the Mountain of Gaash, which is, being interpreted,
*disturbance:* for <span id="fr_4384"></span>[4385](#fn_4384.md) “Mount
Sion is on the sides of the north, the city of the Great King,” is ever
exposed to hatred, and in every trial says <span
id="fr_4385"></span>[4386](#fn_4385.md) “But my feet had well nigh
slipped.” The book which bears the name of Joshua ends with his burial.
Again in the book of Judges we read of him as though he had risen and
come to life again, and by way of summary his works are extolled. We
read too <span id="fr_4386"></span>[4387](#fn_4386.md) “So Joshua sent the
people away, every man unto his inheritance, that they might possess the
land.” And “Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua,” and so on.
There immediately follows: “And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of
the Lord, died, being an hundred and ten years old.” Moses, moreover,
only saw the land of promise; he could not enter: and <span
id="fr_4387"></span>[4388](#fn_4387.md) “he died in the land of Moab, and
the Lord buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against
Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.” Let us
compare the burial of the two: Moses died in the land of Moab, Joshua in
the land of Judæa. The former was buried in a valley over against the
house of Phogor, which is, being interpreted, *reproach* (for the Hebrew
Phogor corresponds to Priapus <span id="fr_4388"></span>[4389](#fn_4388.md)
); the latter in Mount Ephraim on the north of Mount Gaash. And in the
simple expressions of the sacred Scriptures there is always a more
subtle meaning. The Jews gloried in children and child-bearing; and the
barren woman, who had not offspring in Israel, was accursed; but blessed
was he whose seed was in Sion, and his family in Jerusalem; and part of
the highest blessing was, <span id="fr_4389"></span>[4390](#fn_4389.md)
“Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, <span id="page_363">p. 363</span>
<span id="vi.vi.I-Page_363"></span>in the innermost parts of thy house,
thy children like olive plants, round about thy table.” Therefore his
grave is described as placed in a valley over against the house of an
idol which was in a special sense consecrated to lust. But we who fight
under Joshua our leader, even to the present day know not where Moses
was buried. For we despise Phogor, and all his shame, knowing that they
who are in the flesh cannot please God. And the Lord before the flood
had said <span id="fr_4390"></span>[4391](#fn_4390.md) “My spirit shall not
abide in man for ever, for that he also is flesh.” Wherefore, when Moses
died, the people of Israel mourned for him; but Joshua like one on his
way to victory was unmourned. For marriage ends at death; virginity
thereafter begins to wear the crown.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p180"></span>23. Next he brings forward Samson, and
does not consider that the Lord’s Nazarite was once shaven bald by a
woman. And although Samson continues to be a type of the Saviour because
he loved a harlot from among the Gentiles, which harlot corresponds to
the Church, and because he slew more enemies in his death than he did in
his life, yet he does not set an example of conjugal chastity. And he
surely reminds us <span id="fr_4391"></span>[4392](#fn_4391.md) of Jacob’s
prophecy—he was shaken by his runaway steed, bitten by an adder and fell
backwards. But why he enumerated Deborah, and Barak, and the wife of
Heber the Kenite, I am at a loss to understand. For it is one thing to
draw up a list of military commanders in historical sequence, another to
indicate certain figures of marriage which cannot be found in them. And
whereas he prefers the fidelity of the father Jephthah to the tears of
the virgin daughter, that makes for us. For we are not commending
virgins of the world so much as those who are virgins for Christ’s sake,
and most Hebrews blame the father for the rash vow he made, <span
id="fr_4392"></span>[4393](#fn_4392.md) “If thou wilt indeed deliver the
children of Ammon into mine hand, then it shall be, that whatsoever
cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace
from the children of Ammon, it shall be for the Lord’s, and I will offer
it up for a burnt offering.” Supposing (they say) a dog or an ass had
met him, what would he have done? Their meaning is that God so ordered
events that he who had improvidently made a vow, should learn his error
by the death of his daughter. And if Samuel who was brought up in the
tabernacle married a wife, how does that prejudice virginity? As if at
the present day also there were not many married priests, and as though
the Apostle did not <span id="fr_4393"></span>[4394](#fn_4393.md) describe
a bishop as the husband of one wife, having children with all purity. At
the same time we must not forget that Samuel was a Levite, not a priest
or high-priest. Hence it was that his mother made for him a linen ephod,
that is, a linen garment to go over the shoulders, which was the proper
dress of the Levites and of the inferior order. And so he is not named
in the Psalms among the priests, but among those who call upon the name
of the Lord: <span id="fr_4394"></span>[4395](#fn_4394.md) “Moses and Aaron
among his priests, and Samuel among those who call upon his name.”
For <span id="fr_4395"></span>[4396](#fn_4395.md) Levi begat Kohath, Kohath
begat Amminadab, Amminadab begat Korah, Korah begat Assir, Assir begat
Elkanah, Elkanah begat Zuph, Zuph begat Tahath, Tahath begat Eliel,
Eliel begat Jeroham, Jeroham begat Elkanah, Elkanah begat Samuel. And no
one doubts that the priests sprang from the stock of Aaron, Eleazar, and
Phinees. And seeing that they had wives, they would be rightly brought
against us, if, led away by the error of the Encratites, we were to
maintain that marriage deserved censure, and our high priest were not
after the order of Melchizedek, without father, without mother, <span
id="fr_4396"></span>[4397](#fn_4396.md) <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.vi.I-p186.2"></span>Α᾽γενεαλόγητος</span> , that is, unmarried.
And much fruit truly did Samuel reap from his children! he himself
pleased God, but <span id="fr_4397"></span>[4398](#fn_4397.md) begat such
children as displeased the Lord. But if in support of second marriage,
he urges the instance of Boaz and Ruth, let him know that in the Gospel
(S. [Matt. i. 6](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#006.md)<span
id="vi.vi.I-p187.2"></span>) to typify the Church even Rahab the harlot
is reckoned among our Lord’s ancestors.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p188"></span>24. He boasts that David bought his wife
for two hundred foreskins. But he should remember that David had
numerous other wives, and afterwards received Michal, Saul’s daughter,
whom her father had delivered to another, and when he was old got heat
from the embrace of the Shunammite maiden. And I do not say this because
I am bold enough to disparage holy men, but because it is one thing to
live under the law, another to live under the Gospel. David slew Uriah
the Hittite and committed adultery with Bathsheba. And because he was a
man of blood—the reference is not, as some think, to his wars, but to
the <span id="fr_4398"></span>[4399](#fn_4398.md) murder—he was not
permitted to build a temple of the Lord. But as for us, <span
id="fr_4399"></span>[4400](#fn_4399.md) if we cause one of the least to
stumble, and if we say to a brother <span
id="fr_4400"></span>[4401](#fn_4400.md) *Raca,* or <span
id="fr_4401"></span>[4402](#fn_4401.md) use our eyes improperly, it were
good that a millstone <span id="page_364">p. 364</span> <span
id="vi.vi.I-Page_364"></span>were hanged about our neck, we shall be in
danger of Gehenna, and a mere glance will be reckoned to us for
adultery. He passes on to Solomon, through whom wisdom itself sang its
own praises. Seeing that not content with dwelling upon his praises, he
calls him uxorious, I am surprised that he did not add the words of the
Canticles: <span id="fr_4402"></span>[4403](#fn_4402.md) “There are
threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and maidens without
number,” and those of the First Book of Kings; <span
id="fr_4403"></span>[4404](#fn_4403.md) And he had seven hundred wives,
princesses, and three hundred concubines, and others without number.”
These are they who turned away his heart from the Lord: and yet before
he had many wives, and fell into sins of the flesh, at the beginning of
his reign and in his early years he built a temple to the Lord. For
every one is judged not for what he will be, but for what he is. But if
Jovinianus approves the example of Solomon, he will no longer be in
favour of second and third marriages only, but unless he has seven
hundred wives and three hundred concubines, he cannot be the king’s
antitype or attain to his merit. I earnestly again and again remind you,
my reader, that I am compelled to speak as I do, and that I do not
disparage our predecessors under the law, but am well aware that they
served their generation according to their circumstances, and fulfilled
the Lord’s command to increase, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
And what is more they were figures of those that were to come. But we to
whom it is said, <span id="fr_4404"></span>[4405](#fn_4404.md) “The time is
shortened, that henceforth those that have wives may be as though they
had none,” have a different command, and for us virginity is consecrated
by the Virgin Saviour.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p196"></span>25. What folly it was to include Elijah
and Elisha in a list of married men, is plain without a word from me.
For, since John Baptist came in the spirit and power of Elijah, and John
was a virgin, it is clear that he came not only in Elijah’s spirit, but
also in his bodily chastity. Then the passage relating to Hezekiah might
be adduced (though Jovinianus with his wonted stupidity did not notice
it), in which after his recovery and the addition of fifteen years to
his life he said, “Now will I beget children.” It must be remembered,
however, that in the Hebrew texts the passage is not so, but runs
thus: <span id="fr_4405"></span>[4406](#fn_4405.md) “The father to the
children shall make known thy faithfulness.” Nor need we wonder that
Huldah, the prophetess, and wife of Shallum, was <span
id="fr_4406"></span>[4407](#fn_4406.md) consulted by Josiah, King of Judah,
when the captivity was approaching and the wrath of the Lord was falling
upon Jerusalem: since it is the rule of Scripture when holy men fail, to
praise women to the reproach of men. And it is superfluous to speak of
Daniel, for the Hebrews to the present day affirm that the three youths
were eunuchs, in accordance with the declaration of God which Isaiah
utters to Hezekiah: <span id="fr_4407"></span>[4408](#fn_4407.md) “And of
thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they
take away: and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the King of
Babylon.” And again in Daniel we read: <span
id="fr_4408"></span>[4409](#fn_4408.md) “And the king spake unto Ashpenaz
the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in certain of the
children of Israel, even of the seed royal and of the nobles: youth in
whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and
cunning in knowledge, and understanding science.” The conclusion is that
if Daniel and the three youths were chosen from the seed royal, and if
Scripture foretold that that there should be eunuchs of the seed royal,
these men were those who were made eunuchs. If he meets us with the
argument that in Ezekiel <span id="fr_4409"></span>[4410](#fn_4409.md) it
is said that Noah, Daniel and Job in a sinful land could not free their
sons and daughters, we reply that the words are used hypothetically.
Noah and Job were not in existence at that time: we know that they lived
many ages before. And the meaning is this: if there were such and such
men in a sinful land, they shall not be able to save their own sons and
daughters: because the righteousness of the father shall not save the
son, nor shall the sin of one be imputed to another. <span
id="fr_4410"></span>[4411](#fn_4410.md) “For the soul that sinneth, it
shall die.” This, too, must be said, that Daniel, as the history of his
book shows, was taken captive with King Jehoiakim at the same time that
Ezekiel was also led into captivity. How then could he have sons who was
still a youth? And only three years had elapsed when he was brought in
to wait upon the king. Let no one suppose that Ezekiel at this time
remembers Daniel as a man, not as a youth; for “It came to pass,” he
says, <span id="fr_4411"></span>[4412](#fn_4411.md) “in the sixth year,”
that is of King Jehoiakim, “in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the
month:” and, “as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before
me.” Yet on that same day it was said to him, <span
id="fr_4412"></span>[4413](#fn_4412.md) “Though these three men, Noah,
Daniel, and Job were in it.” Daniel was therefore a youth, and known to
the people, either on account of his interpretation of the king’s
dreams, <span id="fr_4413"></span>[4414](#fn_4413.md) or on account of the
release of Susannah, and the slaying of the elders. And it is clearly
proved that at the time these <span id="page_365">p. 365</span> <span
id="vi.vi.I-Page_365"></span>things were spoken of Noah, Daniel, and
Job, Daniel was still a youth and could not have had sons and daughters,
whom he might save by his righteousness. So far concerning the Law.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p206"></span>26. Coming to the Gospel he sets before
us Zacharias and Elizabeth, Peter and his mother-in-law, and, with a
shamelessness to which we have now grown accustomed, fails to understand
that they, too, ought to have been reckoned among those who served the
Law. For the Gospel had no being before the crucifixion of Christ—it was
consecrated by His passion and by His blood. In accordance with this
rule Peter and the other Apostles (I must give Jovinianus something now
and then out of my abundance) had indeed wives, but those which they had
taken before they knew the Gospel. But once they were received into the
Apostolate, they forsook the offices of marriage. For when Peter,
representing the Apostles, says to the Lord: <span
id="fr_4414"></span>[4415](#fn_4414.md) “Lo we have left all and followed
thee,” the Lord answered him, <span id="fr_4415"></span>[4416](#fn_4415.md)
“Verily I say unto you, there is no man that hath left house or wife, or
brethren, or parents, or children for the kingdom of God’s sake, who
shall not receive manifold more in this time, and in the world to come
eternal life.” But if, in order to show that all the Apostles had wives,
he meets us with the words <span id="fr_4416"></span>[4417](#fn_4416.md)
“Have we no right to lead about women or wives” (for <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.vi.I-p209.2"></span>γυνή</span> in Greek has
both meanings) “even as the rest of the apostles, and Cephas, and the
brethren of the Lord?” let him add what is found in the Greek copies,
“Have we no right to lead about women that are sisters, or wives?” This
makes it clear that the writer referred to other holy women, who, in
accordance with Jewish custom, ministered to their teachers of their
substance, as we read was the practice with even our Lord himself. Where
there is a previous reference to eating and drinking, and the outlay of
money, and mention is afterwards made of women that are sisters, it is
quite clear, as we have said, that we must understand, not wives, but
those women who ministered of their substance. And we read the same
account in the Old Testament of the Shunammite who was wont to welcome
Elisha, and to put for him a table, and bread, and a candlestick, and
the rest. At all events if we take <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.vi.I-p209.3"></span>γυναίκας</span> to mean *wives*, not *women*,
the addition of the word *sisters* destroys the effect of the word
*wives*, and shews that they were related in spirit, not by wedlock.
Nevertheless, with the exception of the Apostle Peter, it is not openly
stated that the Apostles had wives; and since the statement is made of
one while nothing is said about the rest, we must understand that those
of whom Scripture gives no such description had no wives. Yet
Jovinianus, who has arrayed against us Zacharias and Elizabeth, Peter
and his wife’s mother, should know, that John was the son of Zacharias
and Elizabeth, that is, a virgin was the offspring of marriage, the
Gospel of the law, chastity of matrimony; so that by a virgin prophet
the virgin Lord might be both announced and baptized. But we might say
concerning Peter, that he had a mother-in-law when he believed, and no
longer had a wife, although in the <span
id="fr_4417"></span>[4418](#fn_4417.md) “Sentences” we read of both his
wife and daughter. But for the present our argument must be based wholly
on Scripture. He has made his appeal to the Apostles, because he thinks
that they, who hold the chief authority in our moral system and are the
typical Christian teachers, were not virgins. If, then, we allow that
they were not virgins (and, with the exception of Peter, the point
cannot be proved), yet I must tell him that it is to the Apostles that
the words of Isaiah relate: <span id="fr_4418"></span>[4419](#fn_4418.md)
“Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a small remnant, we should
have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.” So, then,
they who were by birth Jews could not under the Gospel recover the
virginity which they had lost in Judaism. And yet John, one of the
disciples, who is related to have been the youngest of the Apostles, and
who was a virgin when he embraced Christianity, remained a virgin, and
on that account was more beloved by our Lord, and lay upon the breast of
Jesus. And what Peter, who had had a wife, did not dare ask, <span
id="fr_4419"></span>[4420](#fn_4419.md) he requested John to ask. And after
the resurrection, when Mary Magdalene told them that the Lord had
risen, <span id="fr_4420"></span>[4421](#fn_4420.md) they both ran to the
sepulchre, but John outran Peter. And when they were fishing in the ship
on the lake of Gennesaret, Jesus stood upon the shore, and the Apostles
knew not who it was they saw; <span id="fr_4421"></span>[4422](#fn_4421.md)
the virgin alone recognized a virgin, and said to Peter, “It is the
Lord.” Again, after hearing the prediction that he must be bound by
another, and led whither he would not, and must suffer on the cross,
Peter said, “Lord what shall this man do?” being unwilling to desert
John, with whom he had always been <span id="page_366">p. 366</span>
<span id="vi.vi.I-Page_366"></span>united. Our Lord said to him, “What
is that to thee if I wish him so to be?” Whence the saying went abroad
among the brethren that that disciple should not die. Here we have a
proof that virginity does not die, and that the defilement of marriage
is not washed away by the blood of martyrdom, but virginity abides with
Christ, and its sleep is not death but a passing to another state. If,
however, Jovinianus should obstinately contend that John was not a
virgin, (whereas we have maintained that his virginity was the cause of
the special love our Lord bore to him), let him explain, if he was not a
virgin, why it was that he was loved more than the other Apostles. But
you say, <span id="fr_4422"></span>[4423](#fn_4422.md) the Church was
founded upon Peter: although <span id="fr_4423"></span>[4424](#fn_4423.md)
elsewhere the same is attributed to all the Apostles, and they all
receive the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and the strength of the
Church depends upon them all alike, yet one among the twelve is chosen
so that when a head has been appointed, there may be no occasion for
schism. But why was not John chosen, who was a virgin? Deference was
paid to age, because Peter was the elder: one who was a youth, I may say
almost a boy, could not be set over men of advanced age; and a good
master who was bound to remove every occasion of strife among his
disciples, and who had said to them, <span
id="fr_4424"></span>[4425](#fn_4424.md) “Peace I leave with you, my peace I
give unto you,” and, <span id="fr_4425"></span>[4426](#fn_4425.md) “He that
is the greater among you, let him be the least of all,” would not be
thought to afford cause of envy against the youth whom he had loved. We
maybe sure that John was then a boy because ecclesiastical history most
clearly proves that he lived to the reign of Trajan, that is, he fell
asleep in the sixty-eighth year after our Lord’s passion, as I have
briefly noted in my treatise on *Illustrious Men*. <span
id="fr_4426"></span>[4427](#fn_4426.md) Peter is an Apostle, and John is an
Apostle—the one a married man, the other a virgin; but Peter is an
Apostle only, John is both an Apostle and an Evangelist, and a prophet.
An Apostle, because he wrote to the Churches as a master; an Evangelist,
because he composed a Gospel, a thing which no other of the Apostles,
excepting Matthew, did; a prophet, for he saw in the island of Patmos,
to which he had been banished by the Emperor Domitian as a martyr for
the Lord, an Apocalypse containing the boundless mysteries of the
future. Tertullian, more over, relates that he was sent to Rome, and
that having been plunged into a jar of boiling oil he came out fresher
and more active than when he went in. But his very Gospel is widely
different from the rest. Matthew as though he were writing of a man
begins thus: “The book of the Generation of Jesus Christ, the son of
David, the son of Abraham;” Luke begins with the priesthood of
Zacharias; Mark with a prophecy of the prophets Malachi and Isaiah. The
first has the face of a man, on account of the genealogical table; the
second, the face of a calf, on account of the priesthood; the third, the
face of a lion, on account of the voice of one crying in the
desert, <span id="fr_4427"></span>[4428](#fn_4427.md) “Prepare ye the way
of the Lord, make His paths straight.” But John like an eagle soars
aloft, and reaches the Father Himself, and says, <span
id="fr_4428"></span>[4429](#fn_4428.md) “In the beginning was the Word, and
the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the
beginning with God,” and so on. The virgin writer expounded mysteries
which the married could not, and to briefly sum up all and show how
great was the privilege of John, or rather of virginity in John, the
Virgin Mother <span id="fr_4429"></span>[4430](#fn_4429.md) was entrusted
by the Virgin Lord to the Virgin disciple.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p223"></span>27. But we toil to no purpose. For our
opponent urges against us the Apostolic sentence and says, <span
id="fr_4430"></span>[4431](#fn_4430.md) “Adam was first formed, then Eve;
and Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into
transgression: but she shall be saved through the child-bearing, if they
continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.” Let us
consider what led the Apostle to make this declaration: <span
id="fr_4431"></span>[4432](#fn_4431.md) “I desire therefore that the men
pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and
disputing.” So in due course he lays down rules of life for the women
and says “In like manner that women adorn themselves in modest apparel,
with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with braided hair, and gold or
pearls or costly raiment; but (which becometh women professing
godliness) through good works. Let a woman learn in quietness with all
subjection. But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over
a man, but to be in quietness.” And that the lot of a woman might not
seem a hard one, reducing her to the condition of a slave to her
husband, the Apostle recalls the ancient law and goes back to the first
example: that Adam was first made, then the woman out of his rib; and
that the Devil could not seduce Adam, but did seduce Eve; and that after
displeasing God she was immediately subjected to the man, and began to
turn to her husband; and he points out that she who was once tied with
the bonds of marriage and was reduced to the condition of Eve, might
blot out the <span id="fr_4432"></span>[4433](#fn_4432.md) old
transgression <span id="page_367">p. 367</span> <span
id="vi.vi.I-Page_367"></span>by the <span
id="fr_4433"></span>[4434](#fn_4433.md) procreation of children: provided,
however, that she bring up the children themselves in the faith and love
of Christ, and in sanctification and chastity; for we must not adopt the
faulty reading of the Latin texts, *sobrietas*, but *castitas*, that
is, <span id="fr_4434"></span>[4435](#fn_4434.md) <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.vi.I-p228.1"></span>σωφροσύνη</span> . You see how you are
mastered by the witness of this passage also, and cannot but be driven
to admit that what you thought was on the side of marriage tells in
favour of virginity. For if the woman is saved in child-bearing, and the
more the children the greater the safety of the mothers, why did he add
“if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with chastity”?
The woman will then be saved, if she bear not children who will remain
virgins: if what she has herself lost, she attains in her children, and
makes up for the loss and decay, of the root by the excellence of the
flower and fruit.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p229"></span>28. Above, in passing, when our opponent
adduced Solomon, who, although he had many wives, nevertheless built the
temple, I briefly replied that it was my intention to run over the
remaining points. Now that he may not cry out that both Solomon and
others under the law, prophets and holy men, have been dishonoured by
us, let us show what this very man with his many wives and concubines
thought of marriage. For no one can know better than he who suffered
through them, what a wife or woman is. Well then, he says in the
Proverbs: <span id="fr_4435"></span>[4436](#fn_4435.md) “The foolish and
bold woman comes to want bread.” What bread? Surely that bread which
cometh down from heaven: and he immediately adds <span
id="fr_4436"></span>[4437](#fn_4436.md) “The earth-born perish in her
house, rush into the depths of hell.” Who are the earth-born that perish
in her house? They of course who follow the first Adam, who is of the
earth, and not the second, who is from heaven. And again in another
place: “Like a worm in wood, so a wicked woman destroyeth her husband.”
But if you assert that this was spoken of bad wives, I shall briefly
answer: What necessity rests upon me to run the risk of the wife I marry
proving good or bad? <span id="fr_4437"></span>[4438](#fn_4437.md) “It is
better,” he says, “to dwell in a desert land, than with a contentious
and passionate woman in a wide house.” How seldom we find a wife without
these faults, he knows who is married. Hence that sublime orator, Varius
Geminus <span id="fr_4438"></span>[4439](#fn_4438.md) says well “The man
who does not quarrel is a bachelor.” <span
id="fr_4439"></span>[4440](#fn_4439.md) “It is better to dwell in the
corner of the housetop, than with a contentious woman in a house in
common.” If a house common to husband and wife makes a wife proud and
breeds contempt for the husband: how much more if the wife be the richer
of the two, and the husband but a lodger in her house! She begins to be
not a wife, but mistress of the house; and if she offend her husband,
they must part. <span id="fr_4440"></span>[4441](#fn_4440.md) “A continual
dropping on a wintry day” turns a man out of doors, and so will a
contentious woman drive a man from his own house. She floods his house
with her constant nagging and daily chatter, and ousts him from his own
home, that is the Church. Hence the same Solomon previously
commands: <span id="fr_4441"></span>[4442](#fn_4441.md) “My son flows forth
beyond.” And the Apostle, writing to the Hebrews, says “Therefore we
ought to give the more earnest heed to the things spoken, lest haply we
flow forth beyond.” But who can hide from himself what is thus
enigmatically expressed? <span id="fr_4442"></span>[4443](#fn_4442.md) “The
horseleech had three daughters, dearly loved, but they satisfied her
not, and a fourth is not satisfied when you say Enough; the grave, and
woman’s love, and the earth that is not satisfied with water, and the
fire that saith not, Enough.” The horse-leech is the devil, the
daughters of the devil are dearly loved, and they cannot be satisfied
with the blood of the slain: *the grave, and woman’s love, and the earth
dry and scorched with heat*. It is not the harlot, or the adulteress who
is spoken of; but woman’s love in general is accused of ever being
insatiable; put it out, it bursts into flame; give it plenty, it is
again in need; it enervates a man’s mind, and engrosses all thought
except for the passion which it feeds. What we read in the parable which
follows is to the same effect: “For three things the earth doth tremble,
and for four which it cannot bear: for a servant when he is king: and a
fool when he is filled with meat: for an odious woman when she is
married to a good husband: and an handmaid that is heir to her
mistress.” See how a wife is classed with the greatest evils. But if you
reply that it is an *odious* wife, I will give you the same answer as
before—the mere possibility of such danger is in itself no light matter.
For he who marries a wife is uncertain whether he is marrying an odious
woman or one worthy of his love. If she be odious, she is intolerable.
If worthy of love, her love <span id="page_368">p. 368</span> <span
id="vi.vi.I-Page_368"></span>is compared to the grave, to the parched
earth, and to fire.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p238"></span>29. Let us come to Ecclesiastes and
adduce a few corroborative passages from him also. <span
id="fr_4443"></span>[4444](#fn_4443.md) “To everything there is a season,
and a time to every purpose under the heaven: a time to be born, and a
time to die: a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is
planted.” We brought forth young under the law with Moses, let us die
under the Gospel with Christ. We planted in marriage, let us by chastity
pluck up that which was planted. “A time to embrace, and a time to
refrain from embracing: a time to love, and a time to hate: a time for
war, and a time for peace.” And at the same time he warns us not to
prefer the law to the Gospel; nor to think that virgin purity is to be
placed on a level with marriage: <span
id="fr_4444"></span>[4445](#fn_4444.md) “Better,” he says, “is the end of a
thing than the beginning thereof.” And he immediately adds: “Say not
thou, what is the cause that the former days were better than these? for
thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.” And he gives the reason
why the latter days are better than the former: <span
id="fr_4445"></span>[4446](#fn_4445.md) “For wisdom with an inheritance is
good.” Under the law carnal wisdom was followed by the sword of death;
under the Gospel an eternal inheritance awaits spiritual wisdom.
“Behold, this have I found, <span id="fr_4446"></span>[4447](#fn_4446.md)
saith the Preacher, one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman
among all those have I not found. Behold this only have I found, that
God made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.” He says
that he had found man upright. Consider the force of the words. The word
*man* comprehends both male and female. “But a woman,” he says, “among
all these have I not found.” Let us read the beginning of Genesis, and
we shall find Adam, that is *man,* called both male and female. Having
then been created by God good and upright, by our own fault we have
fallen to a worse condition; and that which in Paradise had been
upright, when we left Paradise was corrupt. If you object that before
they sinned there was a distinction in sex between male and female, and
that they could without sin have come together, it is uncertain what
might have happened. For we cannot know the judgements of God, and
anticipate his sentence as we choose. What really happened is plain
enough,—that they who in Paradise remained in perpetual virginity, when
they were expelled from Paradise were joined together. Or if Paradise
admits of marriage, and there is no difference between marriage and
virginity, what prevented their previous intercourse even in Paradise?
They are driven out of Paradise; and what they did not there, they do on
earth; so that from the very earliest days of humanity virginity was
consecrated by Paradise, and marriage by earth. <span
id="fr_4447"></span>[4448](#fn_4447.md) “Let thy garments be always white.”
The eternal whiteness of our garments is the purity of virginity. In the
morning we sowed our seed, and in the evening let us not cease. Let us
who served marriage under the law, serve virginity under the Gospel.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p244"></span>30. I pass to the Song of Songs, and
whereas our opponent thinks it makes altogether for marriage, I shall
show that it contains the mysteries of virginity. Let us hear what the
bride says before that the bridegroom comes to earth, suffers, descends
to the lower world, and rises again. <span
id="fr_4448"></span>[4449](#fn_4448.md) “We will make for thee likenesses
of gold with ornaments of silver while the king sits at his table.”
Before the Lord rose again, and the Gospel shone, the bride had not
gold, but likenesses of gold. As for the silver, however, which she
professes to have at the marriage, she not only had silver ornaments,
but she had them in variety—in widows, in the continent, and in the
married. Then the bridegroom makes answer to the bride, and teaches her
that the shadow of the old law has passed away, and the truth of the
Gospel has come. <span id="fr_4449"></span>[4450](#fn_4449.md) “Rise up, my
love, my fair one, and come away, for lo, the winter is past, the rain
is over and gone.” This relates to the Old Testament. Once more he
speaks of the Gospel and of virginity: “The flowers appear on the earth,
the time of the pruning of vines has come.” Does he not seem to you to
say the very same thing that the Apostle says: <span
id="fr_4450"></span>[4451](#fn_4450.md) “The time is shortened that
henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none”?
And more plainly does he herald chastity: <span
id="fr_4451"></span>[4452](#fn_4451.md) “The voice,” he says, “of the
turtle is heard in our land.” The turtle, the chastest of birds, always
dwelling in lofty places, is a type of the Saviour. Let us read the
works of naturalists and we shall find that it is the nature of the
turtle-dove, if it lose its mate, not to take another; and we shall
understand that second marriage is repudiated even by dumb birds. And
immediately the turtle says to its fellow: <span
id="fr_4452"></span>[4453](#fn_4452.md) “The fig tree hath put forth its
green figs,” that is, the commandments of the old law have fallen, and
the blossoming vines of the Gospel give forth their fra<span
id="page_369">p. 369</span> <span id="vi.vi.I-Page_369"></span>grance.
Whence the Apostle also says, <span id="fr_4453"></span>[4454](#fn_4453.md)
“We are a sweet savour of Christ.” <span
id="fr_4454"></span>[4455](#fn_4454.md) “Arise, my love, my fair one, and
come away. O my dove, thou art in the clefts of the rock, in the covert
of the steep place. Let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice;
for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.” <span
id="fr_4455"></span>[4456](#fn_4455.md) Whilst thou coveredst thy
countenance like Moses and the veil of the law remained, I neither saw
thy face, nor did I condescend to hear thy voice. I said, <span
id="fr_4456"></span>[4457](#fn_4456.md) “Yea, when ye make many prayers, I
will not hear.” But now with unveiled face behold my glory, and shelter
thyself in the cleft and steep places of the solid rock. On hearing this
the bride disclosed the mysteries of chastity: <span
id="fr_4457"></span>[4458](#fn_4457.md) “My beloved is mine, and I am his:
he feedeth his flock among the lilies,” that is among the pure virgin
bands. Would you know what sort of a throne our true Solomon, the Prince
of Peace, has, and what his attendants are like? <span
id="fr_4458"></span>[4459](#fn_4458.md) “Behold,” he says, “it is the
litter of Solomon: threescore mighty men are about it, of the mighty men
of Israel. They all handle the sword, and are expert in war: every man
hath his sword upon his thigh.” They who are about Solomon have their
sword upon their thigh, like Ehud, the left-handed judge, who slew the
fattest of foes, a man devoted to the flesh, and cut short all his
pleasures. <span id="fr_4459"></span>[4460](#fn_4459.md) “I will get me,”
he says, “to the mountain of myrrh;” to those, that is, who have
mortified their bodies; “and to the hill of frankincense,” to the crowds
of pure virgins; “and I will say to my bride, thou art all fair, my
love, and there is no spot in thee.” Whence too the Apostle: <span
id="fr_4460"></span>[4461](#fn_4460.md) “That he might present the church
to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such
thing.” <span id="fr_4461"></span>[4462](#fn_4461.md) “Come with me from
Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon. Thou shalt come <span
id="fr_4462"></span>[4463](#fn_4462.md) and pass on from the beginning of
faith, from the top of Sanir and Hermon, from the lions’ dens, from the
mountains of the leopards.” Lebanon is, being interpreted, *whiteness*.
Come then, fairest bride, concerning whom it is elsewhere said <span
id="fr_4463"></span>[4464](#fn_4463.md) “Who is she that cometh up, all in
white?” and pass on by way of this world, from the beginning of faith,
and from Sanir, which is by interpretation, *God of light*, as we read
in the psalm: <span id="fr_4464"></span>[4465](#fn_4464.md) “Thy word is a
lantern unto my feet, and light unto my path;” and “from Hermon,” that
is, *consecration*: and “flee from the lions’ dens, and the mountains of
the leopards who cannot change their spots.” Flee, he says, from the
lions’ dens, flee from the pride of devils, that when thou hast been
consecrated to me, I may be able to say unto thee: <span
id="fr_4465"></span>[4466](#fn_4465.md) “Thou hast ravished my heart, my
sister, my bride, thou hast ravished mine heart with one of thine eyes,
with one chain of thy neck.” What he says is something like this—I do
not reject marriage: you have a second eye, the left, which I have given
to you on account of the weakness of those who cannot see the right. But
I am pleased with the right eye of virginity, and if it be blinded the
whole body is in darkness. And that we might not think he had in view
carnal love and bodily marriage, he at once excludes this meaning by
saying <span id="fr_4466"></span>[4467](#fn_4466.md) “Thou hast ravished my
heart, my bride, my sister.” The name sister excludes all suspicion of
unhallowed love. “How fair are thy breasts with wine,” those breasts
concerning which he had said above, My beloved is mine, and I am his:
“betwixt my breasts shall he lie,” that is in the princely portion of
the heart where the Word of God has its lodging. What wine is that which
gives beauty to the breasts of the bride, and fills them with the milk
of chastity? That, forsooth, of which the bridegroom goes on to
speak: <span id="fr_4467"></span>[4468](#fn_4467.md) “I have drunk my wine
with my milk. Eat, O friends: yea, drink and be drunken, my brethren.”
Hence the Apostles also were said to be filled with new wine; with
*new*, he says, not with *old* wine; because <span
id="fr_4468"></span>[4469](#fn_4468.md) new wine is put into fresh
wine-skins, and they <span id="fr_4469"></span>[4470](#fn_4469.md) did not
walk in oldness of the letter, but in newness of the Spirit. This is
wine wherewith when youths and maidens are intoxicated, they at once
thirst for virginity; they are filled with the spirit of chastity, and
the prophecy of Zechariah comes to pass, at least if we follow the
Hebrew literally, for he prophesied concerning virgins: <span
id="fr_4470"></span>[4471](#fn_4470.md) “And the streets of the city shall
be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof. For what is
his goodness, and what is his beauty, but the corn of the elect, and
wine that giveth birth to virgins?” They are virgins of whom it is
written in the forty-fifth psalm: <span
id="fr_4471"></span>[4472](#fn_4471.md) “The virgins her companions that
follow her shall be brought unto thee. With gladness and rejoicing shall
they be led: they shall enter into the King’s palace.”

<span id="vi.vi.I-p269"></span>31. Then follows: <span
id="fr_4472"></span>[4473](#fn_4472.md) “A garden shut up is my <span
id="page_370">p. 370</span> <span id="vi.vi.I-Page_370"></span>sister,
my bride: a garden shut up, a fountain sealed.” That which is shut up
and sealed reminds us of the mother of our Lord who was a mother and a
Virgin. Hence it was that no one before or after our Saviour was laid in
his new tomb, hewn in the solid rock. And yet she that was ever a Virgin
is the mother of many virgins. For next we read: “Thy shoots are an
orchard of pomegranates with precious fruits.” By pomegranates and
fruits is signified the blending of all virtues in virginity. <span
id="fr_4473"></span>[4474](#fn_4473.md) “My beloved is white and ruddy”;
white in virginity, ruddy in martyrdom. And because He is white and
ruddy, therefore it is immediately added <span
id="fr_4474"></span>[4475](#fn_4474.md) “His mouth is most sweet, yea, he
is altogether lovely.” The virgin bridegroom having been praised by the
virgin bride, in turn praises the virgin bride, and says to her: <span
id="fr_4475"></span>[4476](#fn_4475.md) “How beautiful are thy feet in
sandals, <span id="fr_4476"></span>[4477](#fn_4476.md) O daughter of
Aminadab,” which is, being interpreted, *a people that offereth itself
willingly.* For virginity is voluntary, and therefore the steps of the
Church in the beauty of chastity are praised. This is not the time for
me like a commentator to explain all the mysteries of virginity from the
Song of Songs; I have no doubt that the fastidious reader will turn up
his nose at what has already been said.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p275"></span>32. Isaiah tells of the mystery of our
faith and hope: <span id="fr_4477"></span>[4478](#fn_4477.md) “Behold a
virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name
Emmanuel.” I know that the Jews are accustomed to meet us with the
objection that in Hebrew the word *Almah* does not mean a virgin, but *a
young woman.* And, to speak truth, a virgin is properly called
*Bethulah,* but a young woman, or a girl, is not *Almah*, but
*Naarah!* <span id="fr_4478"></span>[4479](#fn_4478.md) What then is the
meaning of *Almah?* A hidden virgin, that is, not merely virgin, but a
virgin and something more, because not every virgin is hidden, shut off
from the occasional sight of men. Then again, Rebecca, on account of her
extreme purity, and because she was a type of the Church which she
represented in her own virginity, is described in Genesis as *Almah*,
not *Bethulah*, as may clearly be proved from the words of Abraham’s
servant, spoken by him in Mesopotamia: <span
id="fr_4479"></span>[4480](#fn_4479.md) “And he said, O Lord, the God of my
master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: behold I stand
by the fountain of water; and let it come to pass, that the maiden which
cometh forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a
little water of this pitcher to drink; and she shall say to me, Both
drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the
woman whom the Lord hath appointed for my master’s son.” Where he speaks
of the maiden coming forth to draw water, the Hebrew word is *Almah*,
that is, a *virgin secluded*, and guarded by her parents with extreme
care. Or, if this be not so, let them at least show me where the word is
applied to married women as well, and I will confess my ignorance.
“Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son.” If virginity be not
preferred to marriage, why did not the Holy Spirit choose a married
woman, or a widow? For at that time Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the
tribe of Aser, was alive, distinguished for purity, and always free to
devote herself to prayers and fasting in the temple of God. If the life,
and good works, and fasting without virginity can merit the advent of
the Holy Spirit, she might well have been the mother of our Lord. Let us
hasten to the rest: <span id="fr_4480"></span>[4481](#fn_4480.md) “The
virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn.”
To her whom he called daughter the prophet also gave the title virgin,
for fear that if he spoke only of a daughter, it might be supposed that
she was married. This is the virgin daughter whom elsewhere he thus
addresses: <span id="fr_4481"></span>[4482](#fn_4481.md) “Sing, O barren,
thou that dost not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou
that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the
desolate, than the children of the married wife, saith the Lord.” This
is she of whom God by the mouth of Jeremiah speaks, saying: <span
id="fr_4482"></span>[4483](#fn_4482.md) “Can a maid forget her ornaments,
or a bride her attire.” Concerning her we read of a great miracle in the
same prophecy <span id="fr_4483"></span>[4484](#fn_4483.md) —that a woman
should compass a man, and that the Father of all things should be
contained in a virgin’s womb.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p283"></span>33. “Granted,” says Jovinianus, “that
there is a difference between marriage and virginity, what have you to
say to this,—Suppose a virgin and a widow were baptized, and continued
as they were, what difference will there be between them?” What we have
already said concerning Peter and John, Anna and Mary, may be of service
here. For if there is no difference between a virgin and a widow, both
being baptized, because baptism makes a new man, upon the same principle
harlots and prostitutes, if they are baptized, will be equal to virgins.
If previous marriage is no prejudice to a baptized widow, and past
pleas<span id="page_371">p. 371</span> <span
id="vi.vi.I-Page_371"></span>ures and the exposure of their bodies to
public lust are no detriment in the case of harlots, once they have
approached the laver they will gain the rewards of virginity. It is one
thing to unite with God a mind pure and free from any stain of memory,
another to remember the foul and forced embraces of a man, and in
recollection to act a part which you do not in person. Jeremiah, who
was <span id="fr_4484"></span>[4485](#fn_4484.md) sanctified in the womb,
and was known in his mother’s belly, enjoyed the high privilege because
he was predestined to the blessing of virginity. And when all were
captured, and even the vessels of the temple were plundered by the King
of Babylon, he alone was <span id="fr_4485"></span>[4486](#fn_4485.md)
liberated by the enemy, knew not the insults of captivity, and was
supported by the conquerors; and Nebuchadnezzar, though he gave
Nebuzaradan no charge concerning the Holy of Holies, did give him charge
concerning Jeremiah. For that is the true temple of God, and that is the
Holy of Holies, which is consecrated to the Lord by pure virginity. On
the other hand, Ezekiel, who was kept captive in Babylon, who saw
the <span id="fr_4486"></span>[4487](#fn_4486.md) storm approaching from
the north, and the whirlwind sweeping all before it, says, <span
id="fr_4487"></span>[4488](#fn_4487.md) “My wife died in the evening and I
did in the morning as I was commanded.” For the Lord had previously told
him that in that day he should open his mouth, and speak, and no longer
keep silence. Mark well, that while his wife was living he was not at
liberty to admonish the people. His wife died, the bond of wedlock was
broken, and without the least hesitation he constantly devoted himself
to the prophetic office. For he who was called being free, is truly the
Lord’s bondservant. I do not deny the blessedness of widows who remain
such after their baptism; nor do I disparage those wives who maintain
their chastity in wedlock; but as they attain a greater reward with God
than married women who pay the marriage due, let widows themselves be
content to give the preference to virginity. For if a chastity which
comes too late, when the glow of bodily pleasure is no longer felt,
makes them feel superior to married women, why should they not
acknowledge themselves inferior to perpetual virginity.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p288"></span>34. All that goes for nothing, says
Jovinianus, because even bishops, priests, and deacons, husbands of one
wife, and having children, were appointed by the Apostle. Just as the
Apostle <span id="fr_4488"></span>[4489](#fn_4488.md) says he has no
commandment respecting virgins, and yet gives his advice, as one who had
obtained mercy from the Lord, and is anxious throughout the whole
discussion to give virginity the preference over marriage, and advises
what he does not venture to command, lest he seem to lay a snare, and to
put a heavier burden upon man’s nature than it can bear; so also in
establishing the constitution of the Church, inasmuch as the elements of
the early Church were drawn from the Gentiles, he made the rules for
fresh believers somewhat lighter that they might not in alarm shrink
from keeping them. Then, again, the Apostles and elders wrote <span
id="fr_4489"></span>[4490](#fn_4489.md) letters from Jerusalem that no
heavier burden should be laid on Gentile believers than that they should
keep themselves from idolatry, and from fornication, and from things
strangled. As though they were providing for infant children, they gave
them milk to drink, not solid food. Nor did they lay down rules for
continence, nor hint at virginity, nor urge to fasting, nor repeat the
directions <span id="fr_4490"></span>[4491](#fn_4490.md) given in the
Gospel to the Apostles, not to have two tunics, nor scrip, nor money in
their girdles, nor staff in their hand, nor shoes on their feet. And
they certainly did not bid them, <span
id="fr_4491"></span>[4492](#fn_4491.md) if they wished to be perfect, go
and sell all that they had and give to the poor, and “come follow me.”
For if the young man who boasted of having done all that the law
enjoins, when he heard this went away sorrowful, because he had great
possessions, and the Pharisees derided an utterance such as this from
our Lord’s lips: how much more would the vast multitude of Gentiles,
whose highest virtue consisted in not plundering another’s goods, have
repudiated the obligation of perpetual chastity and continence, when
they were told in the letter to keep themselves from idols, and from
fornication, seeing that fornication was heard of among them, and such
fornication as was not “even among the Gentiles.” But the very choice of
a bishop makes for me. For he does not say: Let a bishop be chosen who
marries one wife and begets children; but who marries one wife,
and <span id="fr_4492"></span>[4493](#fn_4492.md) has his children in
subjection and well disciplined. You surely admit that he is no bishop
who during his episcopate begets children. The reverse is the case—if he
be discovered, he will not be bound by the ordinary obligations of a
husband, but will be condemned as an adulterer. Either permit <span
id="fr_4493"></span>[4494](#fn_4493.md) priests to perform the work of
marriage with the result that virginity and marriage are on a par: or if
it is unlawful for priests to touch their wives, they are so far holy in
that they imitate virgin chastity. But something more follows. A layman,
or any believer, cannot pray unless he abstain from sexual intercourse.
Now a <span id="page_372">p. 372</span> <span
id="vi.vi.I-Page_372"></span>priest must always offer sacrifices for the
people: he must therefore always pray. And if he must always pray, he
must always be released from the duties of marriage. For even under the
old law they who used to offer sacrifices for the people not only
remained in their houses, but purified themselves for the occasion by
separating from their wives, nor would they drink wine or strong drink
which are wont to stimulate lust. That married men are elected to the
priesthood, I do not deny: the number of virgins is not so great as that
of the priests required. Does it follow that because all the strongest
men are chosen for the army, weaker men should not be taken as well? All
cannot be strong. If an army were constituted of strength only, and
numbers went for nothing, the feebler men might be rejected. As it is,
men of second or third-rate strength are chosen, that the army may have
its full numerical complement. How is it, then, you will say, that
frequently at the ordination of priests a virgin is passed over, and a
married man taken? Perhaps because he lacks other qualifications in
keeping with virginity, or it may be that he is thought a virgin, and is
not: or there may be a stigma on his virginity, or at all events
virginity itself makes him proud, and while he plumes himself on mere
bodily chastity, he neglects other virtues; he does not cherish the
poor: he is too fond of money. It sometimes happens that a man has a
gloomy visage, a frowning brow, a walk as though he were in a solemn
procession, and so offends the people, who, because they have no fault
to find with his life, hate his mere dress and gait. Many are chosen not
out of affection for themselves, but out of hatred for another. In most
cases the election is won by mere simplicity, while the shrewdness and
discretion of another candidate elicit opposition as though they were
evils. Sometimes the judgement of the commoner people is at fault, and
in testing the qualities of the priesthood, the individual inclines to
his own character, with the result that he looks not so much for a good
candidate as for one like himself. Not unfrequently it happens that
married men, who form the larger portion of the people, in approving
married candidates seem to approve themselves, and it does not occur to
them that the mere fact that they prefer a married person to a virgin is
evidence of their inferiority to virgins. What I am going to say will
perhaps offend many. Yet I will say it, and good men will not be angry
with me, because they will not feel the sting of conscience. Sometimes
it is the fault of the bishops, who choose into the ranks of the clergy
not the best, but the cleverest, men, and think the more simple as well
as innocent ones incapable; or, as though they were distributing the
offices of an earthly service, they give posts to their kindred and
relations; or they listen to the dictates of wealth. And, worse than
all, they give promotion to the clergy who besmear them with flattery.
To take the other view, if the Apostle’s meaning be that marriage is
necessary in a bishop, the Apostle himself ought not to have been a
bishop, for he said, <span id="fr_4494"></span>[4495](#fn_4494.md) “Yet I
would that all men were even as I myself.” And John will be thought
unworthy of this rank, and all the virgins, and the continent, the
fairest gems that give grace and ornament to the Church. Bishop, priest,
and deacon, are not honourable distinctions, but names of offices. And
we do not read: <span id="fr_4495"></span>[4496](#fn_4495.md) “If a man
seeketh the office of a bishop, he desireth a good degree,” but, “he
desireth a good work,” because by being placed in the higher order an
opportunity is afforded him, if he choose to avail himself of it, for
the practice of virtue.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p297"></span>35. “The bishop, then, must be without
reproach, so that he is the slave of no vice: “the husband of one wife,”
that is, in the past, not in the present; “sober,” or <span
id="fr_4496"></span>[4497](#fn_4496.md) better, as it is in the Greek,
“vigilant,” that is <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.vi.I-p298.1"></span>νηφάλεον</span>; “chaste,” for that is
the <span id="fr_4497"></span>[4498](#fn_4497.md) meaning of <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.vi.I-p299.1"></span>σὼφρονα</span>; <span
id="fr_4498"></span>[4499](#fn_4498.md) “distinguished,” both by chastity
and conduct: “hospitable,” so that he imitates Abraham, and with
strangers, nay rather *in* strangers, entertains Christ; “apt to teach,”
for it profits nothing to enjoy the consciousness of virtue, unless a
man be able to instruct the people intrusted to him, so that he can
exhort in doctrine, and refute the gainsayers; <span
id="fr_4499"></span>[4500](#fn_4499.md) “not a drunkard,” for he who is
constantly in the Holy of Holies and offers sacrifices, will not drink
wine and strong drink, since wine is a luxury. If a bishop drink at all,
let it be in such a way that no one will know whether he has drunk or
not. “No striker,” that is, <span id="fr_4500"></span>[4501](#fn_4500.md) a
striker of men’s consciences, for the Apostle is not pointing out what a
boxer, but a pontiff ought not to do. He directly teaches what he ought
to do: “but gentle, not contentious, no lover of money, one that ruleth
well his own house, having his children in <span id="page_373">p.
373</span> <span id="vi.vi.I-Page_373"></span>subjection with all
chastity.” See what chastity is required in a bishop! If his child be
unchaste, he himself cannot be a bishop, and he offends God in the same
way as did <span id="fr_4501"></span>[4502](#fn_4501.md) Eli the priest,
who had indeed rebuked his sons, but because he had not put away the
offenders, fell backwards and died before the lamp of God went
out. <span id="fr_4502"></span>[4503](#fn_4502.md) “Women in like manner
must be chaste,” and so on. In every grade, and in both sexes, chastity
has the chief place. You see then that the blessedness of a bishop,
priest, or deacon, does not lie in the fact that they are bishops,
priests, or deacons, but in their having the virtues which their names
and offices imply. Otherwise, if a deacon be holier than his bishop, his
lower grade will not give him a worse standing with Christ. If it were
so, Stephen the deacon, the first to wear the martyr’s crown, would be
less in the kingdom of heaven than many bishops, and than Timothy and
Titus, whom I venture to make neither inferior nor yet superior to him.
Just as in the legions of the army there are generals, tribunes,
centurions, javelin-men, and light-armed troops, common soldiers, and
companies, but once the battle begins, all distinctions of rank are
dropped, and the one thing looked for is valour: so too in this camp and
in this battle, in which we contend against devils, not names but deeds
are needed: and under the true commander, Christ, not the man who has
the highest title has the greatest fame, but he who is the bravest
warrior.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p305"></span>36. But you will say: “If everybody were
a virgin, what would become of the human race”? Like shall here beget
like. If everyone were a widow, or continent in marriage, how will
mortal men be propagated? Upon this principle there will be nothing at
all for fear that something else may cease to exist. To put a case: if
all men were philosophers, there would be no husbandmen. Why speak of
husbandmen? there would be no orators, no lawyers, no teachers of the
other professions. If all men were leaders, what would become of the
soldiers? If all were the head, whose head would they be called, when
there were no other members? You are afraid that if the desire for
virginity were general there would be no prostitutes, no adulteresses,
no wailing infants in town or country. Every day the blood of
adulterers <span id="fr_4503"></span>[4504](#fn_4503.md) is shed,
adulterers are condemned, and lust is raging and rampant in the very
presence of the laws and the symbols of authority and the courts of
justice. Be not afraid that all will become virgins: virginity is a hard
matter, and therefore rare, because it is hard: “Many are called, few
chosen.” Many begin, few persevere. And so the reward is great for those
who have persevered. If all were able to be virgins, our Lord would
never have said: <span id="fr_4504"></span>[4505](#fn_4504.md) “He that is
able to receive it, let him receive it:” and the Apostle would not have
hesitated to give his advice,— <span
id="fr_4505"></span>[4506](#fn_4505.md) “Now concerning virgins I have no
commandment of the Lord.” Why then, you will say, were the organs of
generation created, and why were we so fashioned by the all-wise
creator, that we burn for one another, and long for natural intercourse?
To reply is to endanger our modesty: we are, as it were, between two
rocks, the <span id="fr_4506"></span>[4507](#fn_4506.md) Symplegades of
necessity and virtue, on either side; and must make shipwreck of either
our sense of shame, or of the cause we defend: If we reply to your
suggestions, shame covers our face. If shame secures silence, in a
manner we seem to desert our post, and to leave the ground clear to the
raging foe. Yet it is better, as the story goes, to shut our eyes and
fight like the <span id="fr_4507"></span>[4508](#fn_4507.md) blindfold
gladiators, than not to repel with the shield of truth the darts aimed
at us. I can indeed say: “Our hinder parts which are banished from
sight, and the lower portions of the abdomen, which perform the
functions of nature, are the Creator’s work.” But inasmuch as the
physical conformation of the organs of generation testifies to
difference of sex, I shall briefly reply: Are we never then to forego
lust, for fear that we may have members of this kind for nothing? Why
then should a husband keep himself from his wife? Why should a widow
persevere in chastity, if we were only born to live like beasts? Or what
harm does it do me if another man lies with my wife? For as the teeth
were made for chewing, and the food masticated passes into the stomach,
and a man is not blamed for giving my wife bread: similarly if it was
intended that the organs of generation should always be performing their
office, when my vigour is spent let another take my place, and, if I may
so speak, let my wife quench her burning lust where she can. But what
does the Apostle mean by exhorting to continence, if continence be
contrary to nature? What does our Lord mean when He instructs us in the
various kinds of eunuchs. <span id="fr_4508"></span>[4509](#fn_4508.md)
Surely <span id="fr_4509"></span>[4510](#fn_4509.md) the Apostle who bids
us emulate his own chastity, must be asked, if we are to be consistent,
Why are you like other men, Paul? Why are <span id="page_374">p.
374</span> <span id="vi.vi.I-Page_374"></span>you distinguished from the
female sex by a beard, hair, and other peculiarities of person? How is
it that you have not swelling bosoms, and are not broad at the hips,
narrow at the chest? Your voice is rugged, your speech rough, your
eyebrows more shaggy. To no purpose you have all these manly qualities,
if you forego the embraces of women. I am compelled to say something and
become a fool: but you have forced me to dare to speak. Our Lord and
Saviour, <span id="fr_4510"></span>[4511](#fn_4510.md) Who though He was in
the form of God, condescended to take the form of a servant, and became
obedient to the Father even unto death, yea the death of the cross—what
necessity was there for Him to be born with members which He was not
going to use? He certainly was circumcised to manifest His sex. Why did
he cause John the Apostle and John the Baptist to make themselves
eunuchs through love of Him, after causing them to be born men? Let us
then who believe in Christ follow His example. And if we knew Him after
the flesh, let us no longer know Him according to the flesh. The
substance of our resurrection bodies will certainly be the same as now,
though of higher glory. For the Saviour after His descent into hell had
so far the selfsame body in which He was crucified, that <span
id="fr_4511"></span>[4512](#fn_4511.md) He showed the disciples the marks
of the nails in His hands and the wound in His side. Moreover, if we
deny the identity of His body because <span
id="fr_4512"></span>[4513](#fn_4512.md) He entered though the doors were
shut, and this is not a property of human bodies, we must deny also that
Peter and the Lord had real bodies because they <span
id="fr_4513"></span>[4514](#fn_4513.md) walked upon the water, which is
contrary to nature. <span id="fr_4514"></span>[4515](#fn_4514.md) “In the
resurrection of the dead they will neither marry nor be given in
marriage, but will be like the angels.” What others will hereafter be in
heaven, that virgins begin to be on earth. If likeness to the angels is
promised us (and there is no difference of sex among the angels), we
shall either be of no sex as are the angels, or at all events which is
clearly proved, though we rise from the dead in our own sex, we shall
not perform the functions of sex.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p318"></span>37. But why do we argue, and why are we
eager to frame a clever and victorious reply to our opponent? <span
id="fr_4515"></span>[4516](#fn_4515.md) “Old things have passed away,
behold all things have become new.” I will run through the utterances of
the Apostles, and as to the instances afforded by Solomon I added short
expositions to facilitate their being understood, so now I will go over
the passages bearing on Christian purity and continence, and will make
of many proofs a connected series. By this method I shall succeed in
omitting nothing relating to chastity, and shall avoid being tediously
long. Amongst other passages, Paul the Apostle writes to the
Romans: <span id="fr_4516"></span>[4517](#fn_4516.md) “What fruit then had
ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of
those things is death. But now being made free from sin, and become
servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end
eternal life.” I suppose too that the end of marriage is death. But the
compensating fruit of sanctification, fruit belonging either to
virginity or to continence, is eternal life. And afterwards: <span
id="fr_4517"></span>[4518](#fn_4517.md) “Wherefore, my brethren, ye also
were made dead to the law through the body of Christ; that ye should be
joined to another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we
might bring forth fruit unto God. For when we were in the flesh, the
sinful passions, which were through the law, wrought in our members to
bring forth fruit unto death. But now we have been discharged from the
law, having died to that wherein we were holden; so that we serve in
newness of the Spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.” “When,” he
says, “we were in the flesh, and not in the newness of the Spirit but in
the oldness of the letter,” we did those things which pertained to the
flesh, and bore fruit unto death. But now because we are dead to the
law, through the body of Christ, let us bear fruit to God, that we may
belong to Him who rose from the dead. And elsewhere, having previously
said, <span id="fr_4518"></span>[4519](#fn_4518.md) “I know that the law is
spiritual,” and having discussed at some length the violence of the
flesh which frequently drives us to do what we would not, he at last
continues: “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of the
body of this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.” And
again, “So then I myself with the mind serve the law of God; but with
the flesh the law of sin.” And, <span
id="fr_4519"></span>[4520](#fn_4519.md) “There is therefore now no
condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the
flesh. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free
from the law of sin and death.” And more clearly in what follows he
teaches that Christians do not walk according to the flesh but according
to the Spirit: <span id="fr_4520"></span>[4521](#fn_4520.md) “For they that
are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are
after the spirit the things of the spirit. For the mind of the flesh is
death; but the mind of the spirit is life and peace: because the mind of
the flesh is enmity against <span id="page_375">p. 375</span> <span
id="vi.vi.I-Page_375"></span>God; for it is not subject to the law of
God, neither indeed can it be: and they that are in the flesh cannot
please God. But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be
that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you,” and so on to where he
says, <span id="fr_4521"></span>[4522](#fn_4521.md) “So then, brethren, we
are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh: for if ye live
after the flesh, ye must die; but if by the spirit ye mortify the deeds
of the body, ye shall live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God,
these are sons of God.” If the <span
id="fr_4522"></span>[4523](#fn_4522.md) wisdom of the flesh is enmity
against God, and they who are in the flesh cannot please God, I think
that they who perform the functions of marriage love the wisdom of the
flesh, and therefore are in the flesh. The Apostle being desirous to
withdraw us from the flesh and to join us to the Spirit, says
afterwards: <span id="fr_4523"></span>[4524](#fn_4523.md) “I beseech you
therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a
living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable
service. And be not fashioned according to this world: but be ye
transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the
good and acceptable and perfect will of God. For I say, through the
grace that was given me, to every man that is among you, not to think of
himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think according to
chastity” <span id="fr_4524"></span>[4525](#fn_4524.md) (not *soberly* as
the Latin versions badly render), but “think,” he says, “according to
chastity,” for the Greek words are <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.vi.I-p328.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.vi.I-p328.2"></span>ις τὸ σωφρονεὶν</span>. Let us consider what
the Apostle says: “Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that
ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.”
What he says is something like this—God indeed permits marriage, He
permits second marriages, and if necessary, prefers even third marriages
to fornication and adultery. But we who ought to present our bodies a
living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is our reasonable
service, should consider, not what God permits, but what He wishes: that
we may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. It
follows that what He merely permits is neither good, nor acceptable, nor
perfect. And he gives his reasons for this advice: <span
id="fr_4525"></span>[4526](#fn_4525.md) “Knowing the season, that now it is
high time for you to awake out of sleep: for now is salvation nearer to
us than when we first believed. The night is far spent, and the day is
at hand.” And lastly: “Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not
provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.” God’s will is one
thing, His indulgence another. Whence, writing to the Corinthians, he
says, <span id="fr_4526"></span>[4527](#fn_4526.md) “I, brethren, could not
speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes
in Christ. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye
were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. For ye are yet
carnal.” He who <span id="fr_4527"></span>[4528](#fn_4527.md) is in the
merely animal state, and does not receive the things pertaining to the
Spirit of God (for he is foolish, and cannot understand them, because
they are spiritually discerned), he is not fed with the food of perfect
chastity, but with the coarse milk of marriage. As through man came
death, so also through man came the resurrection of the dead. As in Adam
we all die, so in Christ we shall all be made alive. Under the law we
served the old Adam, under the Gospel let us serve the new Adam. For the
first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a
quickening spirit. <span id="fr_4528"></span>[4529](#fn_4528.md) “The first
man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven. As is the
earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such
are they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the
earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I say,
brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God;
neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.” This is so clear that no
explanation can make it clearer: “Flesh and blood,” he says, “cannot
inherit the Kingdom of God, neither doth corruption inherit
incorruption.” If corruption attaches to all intercourse, and
incorruption is characteristic of chastity, the rewards of chastity
cannot belong to marriage. <span id="fr_4529"></span>[4530](#fn_4529.md)
“For we know that if the earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved,
we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in
the heavens. For verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon
with our habitation which is from heaven. We are willing to be absent
from the body, and to be at home with the Lord. Wherefore also we make
it our aim, whether in the body, or out of the body, to be well-pleasing
unto God.” And by way of more fully explaining what he did not wish them
to be he says elsewhere: <span id="fr_4530"></span>[4531](#fn_4530.md) “I
espoused you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin
to Christ.” But if you choose to apply the words to the whole Assembly
of believers, and in this betrothal to Christ include both married
women, and the twice-<span id="page_376">p. 376</span> <span
id="vi.vi.I-Page_376"></span>married, and widows, and virgins, that also
makes for us. For whilst he invites all to chastity and to the reward of
virginity, he shows that virginity is more excellent than all these
conditions. And again writing to the Galatians he says: <span
id="fr_4531"></span>[4532](#fn_4531.md) “Because by the works of the law
shall no flesh be justified.” Among the works of the law is marriage,
and accordingly under it they are cursed who have no children. And if
under the Gospel it is permitted to have children, it is one thing to
make a concession to weakness, another to hold out rewards to virtue.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p336"></span>38. Something else I will say to my
friends who marry and after long chastity and continence begin to burn
and are as wanton as the brutes: <span
id="fr_4532"></span>[4533](#fn_4532.md) “Are ye so foolish? having begun in
the Spirit, are ye now perfected in the flesh? Did ye suffer so many
things in vain?” If the Apostle in the case of some persons loosens the
cords of continence, and lets them have a slack rein, he does so on
account of the infirmity of the flesh. This is the enemy he has in view
when he once more says: <span id="fr_4533"></span>[4534](#fn_4533.md) “Walk
by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the
flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh.” It
is unnecessary now to speak of the works of the flesh: it would be
tedious, and he who chooses can easily gather them from the letter of
the Apostle. I will only speak of the Spirit and its fruits, love, joy,
peace, long suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, <span
id="fr_4534"></span>[4535](#fn_4534.md) continence. All the virtues of the
Spirit are supported and protected by continence, which is as it were
their solid foundation and crowning point. Against such there is no
law. <span id="fr_4535"></span>[4536](#fn_4535.md) “And they that are of
Christ have crucified their flesh with the passions and the lusts
thereof. If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk.” Why
do we who with Christ have crucified our flesh and its passions and
desires again desire to do the things of the flesh? <span
id="fr_4536"></span>[4537](#fn_4536.md) “Whatsoever a man soweth, that
shall he also reap. For he that soweth unto his own flesh, shall of the
flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth unto the Spirit shall of the
Spirit reap eternal life.” I think that he who has a wife, so long as he
reverts to the practice in question, that Satan may not tempt him, is
sowing to the flesh and not to the Spirit. And he who sows to the flesh
(the words are not mine, but the Apostle’s) reaps corruption. God the
Father chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world, that we
might be holy and without spot before Him. <span
id="fr_4537"></span>[4538](#fn_4537.md) We walked in the lusts of the
flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were
children of wrath, even as the rest. But now He has raised us up with
Him, and made us to sit with Him in the heavenly places in Christ
Jesus, <span id="fr_4538"></span>[4539](#fn_4538.md) that we may put away
according to our former manner of life the old man, which is corrupt
according to the lusts of deceit, and that blessing may be applied to us
which so finely concludes the mystical Epistle to the Ephesians: <span
id="fr_4539"></span>[4540](#fn_4539.md) “Grace be with all them that love
our Lord Jesus Christ in uncorruptness.” <span
id="fr_4540"></span>[4541](#fn_4540.md) “For our citizenship is in heaven;
from whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall
fashion anew the body of our humiliation, that it may be conformed to
the body of his glory. <span id="fr_4541"></span>[4542](#fn_4541.md)
Whatsoever things then are true, whatsoever are chaste, whatsoever
things are just, whatsoever things pertain to purity, let us join
ourselves to these, let us follow these. <span
id="fr_4542"></span>[4543](#fn_4542.md) Christ hath reconciled us in his
body to God the Father through his death, and has presented us holy and
without spot, and without blame before himself: in whom we have been
also circumcised, not with the circumcision made with hands, to the
spoiling of the body of the flesh, but with the circumcision of Christ,
having been buried with him in baptism, wherein also we rose with him.
If then we have risen with Christ, let us seek those things which are
above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God; let us set our
affections on things above, not upon the things that are upon the earth.
For we are dead, and our life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ our
life shall appear, then we also shall appear with him in glory. <span
id="fr_4543"></span>[4544](#fn_4543.md) No soldier on service entangleth
himself in the affairs of this life; that he may please him who enrolled
him as a soldier. <span id="fr_4544"></span>[4545](#fn_4544.md) For the
grace of God hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men, instructing
us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should
live purely and righteously and godly in this present world.”

<span id="vi.vi.I-p350"></span>39. The day would not be long enough were
I to attempt to relate all that the Apostle enjoins concerning purity.
These things are those concerning which our Lord said to the
Apostles: <span id="fr_4545"></span>[4546](#fn_4545.md) “I have yet many
things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit, when he,
the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth.”
After the crucifixion of Christ, we find in the <span
id="fr_4546"></span>[4547](#fn_4546.md) Acts of the Apostles that one
house, that of Philip <span id="page_377">p. 377</span> <span
id="vi.vi.I-Page_377"></span>the Evangelist, produced four virgin
daughters, to the end that Cæsarea, where the Gentile Church had been
consecrated in the person of Cornelius the centurion, might afford an
illustration of virginity. And whereas our Lord said in the
Gospel: <span id="fr_4547"></span>[4548](#fn_4547.md) “The law and the
prophets were until John,” they because they were virgins are related to
have prophesied even after John. For they could not be bound by the law
of the Old Testament, who had shone with the brightness of virginity.
Let us pass on to James, who was called the brother of the Lord, a man
of such sanctity and righteousness, and distinguished by so rigid and
perpetual a virginity, that even <span
id="fr_4548"></span>[4549](#fn_4548.md) Josephus, the Jewish historian,
relates that the overthrow of Jerusalem was due to his death. He, the
first bishop of the Church at Jerusalem, which was composed of Jewish
believers, to whom Paul went, accompanied by Titus and Barnabas, says in
his Epistle: <span id="fr_4549"></span>[4550](#fn_4549.md) “Be not
deceived, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every perfect boon is
from above, coming down from the Father of lights, <span
id="fr_4550"></span>[4551](#fn_4550.md) with whom there is no difference,
neither shadow that is cast by turning. Of his own will he brought us
forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of
his creatures.” Himself a virgin, he teaches virginity in a mystery.
Every perfect gift cometh down from above, where marriage is unknown;
and it cometh down, not from any one you please, but from the Father of
lights, Who says to the apostles, “Ye are the light of the world;” with
Whom there is no difference of Jew, or Gentile, nor does that shadow
which was the companion of the law, trouble those who have believed from
among the nations; but with His word He begat us, and with the word of
truth, because some shadow, image, and likeness of truth went before in
the law, that we might be the first-fruits of His creatures. And as He
who was Himself the <span id="fr_4551"></span>[4552](#fn_4551.md) first
begotten from the dead has raised all that have died in Him: so He who
was a virgin, consecrated the first-fruits of His virgins in His own
virgin self. Let us also consider what Peter thinks of the calling of
the Gentiles: <span id="fr_4552"></span>[4553](#fn_4552.md) “Blessed be the
God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great
mercy begat us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus
Christ from the dead, unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled,
and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who by the power
of God are guarded through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed
in the last time.” Where we read of an inheritance incorruptible, and
undefiled, and that fadeth not away, prepared in heaven and reserved for
the last time, and of the hope of eternal life when they will neither
marry, nor be given in marriage, there, in other words, the privileges
of virginity are described. For he shows as much in what follows: <span
id="fr_4553"></span>[4554](#fn_4553.md) “Wherefore girding up the loins of
your mind, be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to
be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; as children of
obedience, not fashioning yourselves according to your former lusts in
the time of your ignorance; but like as he which called you is holy, be
ye yourselves also holy in all manner of living; because it is written,
ye shall be holy; for I am holy. <span
id="fr_4554"></span>[4555](#fn_4554.md) For we were not redeemed with
contemptible things, with silver or gold; but with the precious blood of
a lamb without spot, Jesus Christ, <span
id="fr_4555"></span>[4556](#fn_4555.md) that we might purify our souls in
obedience to the truth, having been begotten again not of corruptible
seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, <span
id="fr_4556"></span>[4557](#fn_4556.md) who liveth and abideth. And as
living stones let us be built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood
offering up spiritual sacrifices through Christ our Lord. <span
id="fr_4557"></span>[4558](#fn_4557.md) For we are an elect race, a royal
priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession. <span
id="fr_4558"></span>[4559](#fn_4558.md) Christ died for us in the flesh.
Let us arm ourselves with the same conversation as did Christ; for he
that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; that we should no
longer live the rest of our time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but
to the will of God. For the time past is sufficient for us when we
walked in lasciviousness, lusts, and other vices. Great and precious are
the promises attaching to virginity which He has given us, <span
id="fr_4559"></span>[4560](#fn_4559.md) that through it we may become
partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that
is in the world through lust. <span id="fr_4560"></span>[4561](#fn_4560.md)
The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to keep
the unrighteous under punishment unto the day of judgement, but chiefly
them that walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise
dominion, daring, self-willed. For they, as beasts of burden, without
reason, think only of their belly and their lusts, railers who shall in
their corruption be destroyed, and shall receive the reward of iniquity:
men that count unrighteousness delight, spots and blemishes, think<span
id="page_378">p. 378</span> <span id="vi.vi.I-Page_378"></span>ing of
nothing but their pleasures; having eyes full of adultery and insatiable
lust, deceiving souls not yet strengthened by the love of Christ. For
they utter swelling words and easily snare the unlearned with the
seduction of the flesh; promising them liberty while they themselves are
the slaves of vice, luxury, and corruption. For of what a man is
overcome, of the same is he also brought into bondage. But if, after
they had escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of
our Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again overcome by that which they
before overcame, the last state is become worse with them than the
first. And it were better for them not to have known the way of
righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back and forsake the holy
commandment delivered unto them. And it has happened unto them according
to the true proverb, the dog hath turned to his own vomit again, and the
sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire.” I have hesitated, for
fear of being tedious, to quote the whole passage of the second Epistle
of Peter, and have merely shown that the Holy Spirit in prophecy
foretold the teachers of this time and their heresy. Lastly, he more
clearly denotes them, saying, <span id="fr_4561"></span>[4562](#fn_4561.md)
“In the last days seducing mockers shall come, walking after their own
lusts.”

<span id="vi.vi.I-p368"></span>40. The Apostle has described Jovinianus
speaking with swelling cheeks and nicely balancing his inflated
utterances, promising heavenly liberty, when he himself is the slave of
vice and self-indulgence, a dog returning to his vomit. For although he
boasts of being a monk, he has exchanged his dirty tunic, bare feet,
common bread, and drink of water, for a snowy dress, sleek skin,
honey-wine and dainty dishes, for the sauces of <span
id="fr_4562"></span>[4563](#fn_4562.md) Apicius and <span
id="fr_4563"></span>[4564](#fn_4563.md) Paxamus, for baths and rubbings,
and for the cook-shops. Is it not clear that he prefers his belly to
Christ, and thinks his ruddy complexion worth the kingdom of heaven? And
yet that handsome monk so fat and sleek, and of bright appearance, who
always walks with the air of a bridegroom, must either marry a wife if
he is to show that virginity and marriage are equal: or if he does not
marry one, it is useless for him to bandy words with us when his acts
are on our side. And John agrees with this almost to the letter: <span
id="fr_4564"></span>[4565](#fn_4564.md) “Love not the world, neither the
things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the
Father is not in him. For all that is in the world is the lust of the
flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of this life, which is
not of the Father, but is of the world.” And, “The world passeth away,
and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for
ever. A new commandment have I written unto you, which thing is true
both in Christ and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the
true light already shineth.” And again, <span
id="fr_4565"></span>[4566](#fn_4565.md) “Beloved, now are we the children
of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. But we know
that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him: for we shall see
him even as he is. And every one that hath this hope purifieth himself,
even as he is pure. <span id="fr_4566"></span>[4567](#fn_4566.md) Herein is
our love made perfect, if we have boldness in the day of judgement: that
as he is, even so may we be in this world.” The Epistle of Jude also
expresses nearly the same: <span id="fr_4567"></span>[4568](#fn_4567.md)
“Hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.” Let us read the
Apocalypse of John, and we shall there find the Lamb upon Mount
Sion, <span id="fr_4568"></span>[4569](#fn_4568.md) and with Him “a hundred
and forty-four thousand of them that were sealed, having His name and
the name of His Father written in their foreheads, who sing a new song,
and no one can sing that song save they who have been redeemed out of
the earth. These are they who have not defiled themselves with women,
for they continued virgins. These follow the Lamb whithersoever He
goeth: for they were redeemed from among men, first-fruits to God and to
the Lamb, and in their mouth was found no guile, and they are without
spot.” <span id="fr_4569"></span>[4570](#fn_4569.md) Out of each tribe, the
tribe of Dan excepted, the place of which is taken by the tribe of Levi,
twelve thousand virgins who have been sealed are spoken of as future
believers, who have not defiled themselves with women. And that we may
not suppose the reference to be to those who know not harlots, he
immediately added: “For they continued virgins.” Whereby he shows that
all who have not preserved their virginity, in comparison of pure and
angelic chastity and of our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, are
defiled. <span id="fr_4570"></span>[4571](#fn_4570.md) “These are they who
sing a new song which no man can sing except him that is a virgin. These
are first-fruits unto God and unto the Lamb, and are without blemish.”
If virgins are first-fruits, it follows that widows and the continent in
marriage, come after the first-fruits, that is, are in the second and
third rank: nor can a lost people be saved unless it offer such
sacrifices of chastity to God, and with pure victims reconcile the
spotless Lamb. <span id="page_379">p. 379</span> <span
id="vi.vi.I-Page_379"></span>It would be endless work to explain the
Gospel mystery of the ten virgins, five of whom were wise and five
foolish. All I say now is, that as mere virginity without other works
does not save, so all works without virginity, purity, continence,
chastity, are imperfect. And we shall not be hindered in the least from
taking this view by the objection of our opponent that our Lord was at
Cana of Galilee, and joined in the marriage festivities when He turned
water into wine. I shall very briefly reply, that He Who was circumcised
on the eighth day, and for Whom a pair of turtle-doves and two young
pigeons were offered on the day of purification, like others before He
suffered, shewed His approval of Jewish custom, that He might not seem
to give His enemies just cause for putting Him to death on the pretext
that He destroyed the law and condemned nature. And even this was done
for our sakes. For by going once to a marriage, He taught that men
should marry only once. Moreover, at that time it was possible to injure
virginity if marriage were not placed next to it, and the purity of
widowhood in the third rank. But now when heretics are condemning
wedlock, and despise the ordinance of God, we gladly hear anything
he <span id="fr_4571"></span>[4572](#fn_4571.md) may say in praise of
marriage. For the Church does not condemn marriage, but makes it
subordinate; nor does she reject it, but regulates it; for she knows, as
was said before, that <span id="fr_4572"></span>[4573](#fn_4572.md) in a
great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of
wood and earthenware; and that some are to honour, some to dishonour;
and that whoever cleanses himself will be a vessel of honour, necessary,
prepared for every good work.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p380"></span>41. I have given enough and more than
enough illustrations from the divine writings of Christian chastity and
angelic virginity. But as I understand that our opponent in his
commentaries summons us to the tribunal of worldly wisdom, and we are
told that views of this kind are never accepted in the world, and that
our religion has invented a dogma against nature, I will quickly run
through Greek and Roman and Foreign History, and will show that
virginity ever took the lead of chastity. Fable relates that Atalanta,
the virgin of Calydonian fame, lived for the chase and dwelt always in
the woods; in other words that she did not set her heart on marriage
with its troubles of pregnancy and of sickness, but upon the nobler life
of freedom and chastity. <span id="fr_4573"></span>[4574](#fn_4573.md)
Harpalyce too, a Thracian virgin, is described by the famous poet; and
so is <span id="fr_4574"></span>[4575](#fn_4574.md) Camilia, queen of the
Volsci, on whom, when she came to his assistance, Turnus had no higher
praise which he could bestow than to call her a virgin. “O Virgin, Glory
of Italy!” And that famous daughter of <span
id="fr_4575"></span>[4576](#fn_4575.md) Leos, the lady of the brazen house,
ever a virgin, is related to have freed her country from pestilence by
her voluntary death: and the blood of the virgin <span
id="fr_4576"></span>[4577](#fn_4576.md) Iphigenia is said to have calmed
the stormy winds. What need to tell of the Sibyls of Erythræ and Cumæ,
and the eight others? for Varro asserts there were ten whose ornament
was virginity, and divination the reward of their virginity. But if in
the Æolian dialect “Sibyl” is represented by <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.vi.I-p384.1"></span>Θεοβούλη</span>, we must understand that a
knowledge of the *Counsel of God* is rightly attributed to virginity
alone. We read, too, that Cassandra and Chryseis, prophetesses of Apollo
and Juno, were virgins. And there were innumerable priestesses of the
Taurian Diana, and of Vesta. One of these, Munitia, being suspected of
unchastily was <span id="fr_4577"></span>[4578](#fn_4577.md) buried alive,
which would be in my opinion an unjust punishment, unless the violation
of virginity were considered a serious crime. At all events how highly
the Romans always esteemed virgins is clear from the fact that consuls
and generals even in their triumphal chariots and bringing home the
spoils of conquered nations, were wont to make way for them to pass. And
so did men of all ranks. When <span id="fr_4578"></span>[4579](#fn_4578.md)
Claudia, a Vestal Virgin, was suspected of unchastily, and a vessel
containing the image of Cybele was aground in the Tiber, it is related
that she, to prove her chastity, with her girdle drew the ship which a
thousand men could not move. Yet, as <span
id="fr_4579"></span>[4580](#fn_4579.md) the uncle of Lucan the poet says,
it would have been better if this circumstance had decorated a chastity
tried and proved, and had not pleaded in defence of a chastity
equivocal. No wonder that we read such things of human beings, when
heathen error also invented the virgin goddesses Minerva and Diana, and
placed the Virgin among the twelve signs of the Zodiac, by means of
which, as they suppose, the world <span id="page_380">p. 380</span>
<span id="vi.vi.I-Page_380"></span>revolves. It is a proof of the little
esteem in which they held marriage that they did not even among the
scorpions, centaurs, crabs, fishes, and capricorn, thrust in a husband
and wife. When the thirty tyrants of Athens had slain Phidon at the
banquet, they commanded his virgin daughters to come to them, naked like
harlots, and there upon the ground, red with their father’s blood, to
act the wanton. For a little while they hid their grief, and then when
they saw the revellers were intoxicated, going out on the plea of easing
nature, they embraced one another and threw themselves into a well, that
by death they might save their virginity. The virgin daughter of
Demotion, chief of the Areopagites, having heard of the death of her
betrothed, <span id="fr_4580"></span>[4581](#fn_4580.md) Leosthenes, who
had originated the Lamian war, slew herself, for she declared that
although in body she was a virgin, yet if she were compelled to accept
another, she should regard him as her second husband, when she had given
her heart to Leosthenes. So close a friendship long existed between
Sparta and Messene that for the furtherance of certain religious rites
they even exchanged virgins. Well, on one occasion when the men of
Messene attempted to outrage fifty Lacedæmonian virgins, out of so many
not one consented, but they all most gladly died in defence of their
chastity. Whence there arose a long and grievous war, and in the long
run <span id="fr_4581"></span>[4582](#fn_4581.md) Mamertina was destroyed.
Aristoclides, tyrant of Orchomenos, fell in love with a virgin of
Stymphalus, and when after the death of her father she took refuge in
the temple of Diana, and embraced the image of the goddess and could not
be dragged thence by force, she was slain on the spot. Her death caused
such intense grief throughout Arcadia that the people took up arms and
avenged the virgin’s death. <span id="fr_4582"></span>[4583](#fn_4582.md)
Aristomenes of Messene, a just man, at a time when the Lacedæmonians,
whom he had conquered, were celebrating by night the festival called
the <span id="fr_4583"></span>[4584](#fn_4583.md) Hyacinthia, carried off
from the sportive bands fifteen virgins, and fleeing all night at full
speed got away from the Spartan territory. His companions wished to
outrage them, but he admonished them to the best of his power not to do
so, and when certain refused to obey, he slew them, and restrained the
rest by fear. The maidens were afterwards ransomed by their kinsmen, and
on seeing Aristomenes condemned for murder would not return to their
country until clasping the knees of the judges they beheld the protector
of their chastity acquitted. How shall we sufficiently praise the
daughters of Scedasus at Leuctra in Bœotia? It is related that in the
absence of their father they hospitably entertained two youths who were
passing by, and who having drunk to excess violated the virgins in the
course of the night. Being unwilling to survive the loss of their
virginity, the maidens inflicted deadly wounds on one another. Nor would
it be right to omit mention of the Locrian virgins. They were sent to
Ilium according to custom which had lasted for nearly a thousand years,
and yet not one gave occasion to any idle tale or filthy rumour of
virginity defiled. Could any one pass over in silence the seven virgins
of Miletus who, when the Gauls spread desolation far and wide, that they
might suffer no indignity at the hands of the enemy, escaped disgrace by
death, and left to all virgins the lesson of their example—that noble
minds care more for chastity than life? Nicanor having conquered and
overthrown Thebes was himself overcome by a passion for one captive
virgin, whose voluntary self-surrender he longed for. A captive maid, he
thought, must be only too glad. But he found that virginity is dearer to
the pure in heart than a kingdom, when with tears and grief he held her
in his arms slain by her own hand. Greek writers tell also of another
Theban virgin who had been deflowered by a Macedonian foe, and who,
hiding her grief for a while, slew the violator of her virginity as he
slept, and then killed herself with the sword, so that she would neither
live when her chastity was lost, nor die before she had avenged herself.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p392"></span>42. To come to the Gymnosophists of
India, the opinion is authoritatively handed down that Budda, the
founder of their religion, had his birth through the side of a virgin.
And we need not wonder at this in the case of Barbarians when cultured
Greece supposed that Minerva at her birth sprang from the head of Jove,
and Father Bacchus from his thigh. <span
id="fr_4584"></span>[4585](#fn_4584.md) Speusippus also, Plato’s nephew,
and <span id="fr_4585"></span>[4586](#fn_4585.md) Clearchus in his eulogy
of Plato, and <span id="fr_4586"></span>[4587](#fn_4586.md) Anaxelides in
the second book of his <span id="page_381">p. 381</span> <span
id="vi.vi.I-Page_381"></span>philosophy, relates that Perictione, the
mother of Plato, was violated by an apparition of Apollo, and they agree
in thinking that the prince of wisdom was born of a virgin. <span
id="fr_4587"></span>[4588](#fn_4587.md) Timæus writes that the <span
id="fr_4588"></span>[4589](#fn_4588.md) virgin daughter of <span
id="fr_4589"></span>[4590](#fn_4589.md) Pythagoras was at the head of a
band of virgins, and instructed them in chastity. <span
id="fr_4590"></span>[4591](#fn_4590.md) Diodorus, the disciple of Socrates,
is said to have had five daughters skilled in dialectics and
distinguished for chastity, of whom a full account is given by Philo the
master of <span id="fr_4591"></span>[4592](#fn_4591.md) Carneades. And
mighty Rome cannot taunt us as though we had invented the story of the
birth of our Lord and Saviour from a virgin; for the Romans believe that
the founders of their city and race were the offspring of the
virgin <span id="fr_4592"></span>[4593](#fn_4592.md) Ilia and of Mars.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p402"></span>43. Let these allusions to the virgins of
the world, brief and hastily gathered from many histories, now suffice.
I will proceed to married women who were reluctant to survive the
decease or violent death of their husbands for fear they might be forced
into a second marriage, and who entertained a marvellous affection for
the only husbands they had. This may teach us that second marriage was
repudiated among the heathen. Dido, the sister of Pygmalion, having
collected a vast amount of gold and silver, sailed to Africa, and there
built Carthage. And when her hand was sought in marriage by Iarbas, king
of Libya, she deferred the marriage for a while until her country was
settled. Not long after, having raised a <span
id="fr_4593"></span>[4594](#fn_4593.md) funeral pyre to the memory of her
former husband Sichæus, she preferred to “burn rather than to marry.”
Carthage was built by a woman of chastity, and its end was a tribute to
the excellence of the virtue. For the <span
id="fr_4594"></span>[4595](#fn_4594.md) wife of Hasdrubal, when the city
was captured and set on fire, and she saw that she could not herself
escape capture by the Romans, took her little children in either hand
and leaped into the burning ruins of her house.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p405"></span>44. What need to tell of the wife
of <span id="fr_4595"></span>[4596](#fn_4595.md) Niceratus, who, not
enduring to wrong her husband, inflicted death upon herself rather than
subject herself to the lust of the thirty tyrants whom Lysander had set
over conquered Athens? <span id="fr_4596"></span>[4597](#fn_4596.md)
Artemisia, also, wife of Mausolus, is related to have been distinguished
for chastity. Though she was queen of Caria, and is extolled by great
poets and historians, no higher praise is bestowed upon her than that
when her husband was dead she loved him as much as when he was alive,
and built a tomb so great that even to the present day all costly
sepulchres are called after his name, *mausoleums*. <span
id="fr_4597"></span>[4598](#fn_4597.md) Teuta, queen of the Illyrians, owed
her long sway over brave warriors, and her frequent victories over Rome,
to her marvellous chastity. The Indians and almost all the Barbarians
have a plurality of wives. It is a law with them that the favourite wife
must be burned with her dead husband. The wives therefore vie with one
another for the husband’s love, and the highest ambition of the rivals,
and the proof of chastity, is to be considered worthy of death. So then
she that is victorious, having put on her former dress and ornaments,
lies down beside the corpse, embracing and kissing it, and to the glory
of chastity despises the flames which are burning beneath her. I suppose
that she who dies thus, wants no second marriage. The famous Alcibiades,
the friend of Socrates, when Athens was conquered, fled to Pharnabazus,
who took a bribe from Lysander the Lacedæmonian leader and ordered him
to be slain. He was strangled, and when his head had been cut off it was
sent to Lysander as proof of the murder, but the rest of his body lay
unburied. His concubine, therefore, all alone, in defiance of the
command of the cruel enemy, in the midst of strangers, and in the face
of peril, gave him due burial, for she was ready to die for the dead man
whom she had loved when living. Let matrons, Christian matrons at all
events, imitate the fidelity of concubines, and <span id="page_382">p.
382</span> <span id="vi.vi.I-Page_382"></span>exhibit in their freedom
what she in her captivity preserved.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p409"></span>45. Strato, ruler of Sidon, thought of
dying by his own hand, that he might not be the sport of the Persians,
who were close by and whose alliance he had discarded for the friendship
of the king of Egypt. But he drew back in terror, and eying the sword
which he had seized, awaited in alarm the approach of the enemy. His
wife, knowing that he must be immediately taken, wrested the weapon from
his hand, and pierced his side. When the body was properly laid out she
lay down upon it in the agony of death, that she might not violate her
virgin troth in the embraces of another. <span
id="fr_4598"></span>[4599](#fn_4598.md) Xenophon, in describing the early
years of the elder Cyrus, relates that when her husband Abradatas was
slain, Panthea who had loved him intensely, placed herself beside the
mangled body, then stabbed herself, and let her blood run into her
husband’s wounds. The <span id="fr_4599"></span>[4600](#fn_4599.md) queen
whom the king her husband had shewn naked and without her knowledge to
his friend, thought she had good cause for slaying the king. She judged
that she was not beloved if it was possible for her to be exhibited to
another. Rhodogune, daughter of Darius, after the death of her husband,
put to death the nurse who was trying to persuade her to marry
again. <span id="fr_4600"></span>[4601](#fn_4600.md) Alcestis is related in
story to have voluntarily died for Admetus, and Penelope’s chastity is
the theme of Homer’s song. Laodamia’s praises are also sung by the
poets, because, when <span id="fr_4601"></span>[4602](#fn_4601.md)
Protesilaus was slain at Troy, she refused to survive him.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p414"></span>46. I may pass on to Roman women; and the
first that I shall mention is <span id="fr_4602"></span>[4603](#fn_4602.md)
Lucretia, who would not survive her violated chastity, but blotted out
the stain upon her person with her own blood. Duilius, the first Roman
who won a <span id="fr_4603"></span>[4604](#fn_4603.md) naval triumph, took
to wife a virgin, Bilia, of such extraordinary chastity that she was an
example even to an age which held unchastity to be not merely vicious
but monstrous. When he was grown old and feeble he was once in the
course of a quarrel taunted with having bad breath. In dudgeon he betook
himself home, and on complaining to his wife that she had never told him
of it so that he might remedy the fault, he received the reply that she
would have done so, but she thought that all men had foul breath as he
had. In either case this chaste and noble woman deserves praise, whether
she was not aware there was anything wrong with her husband, or if she
patiently endured, and her husband discovered his unfortunate condition
not by the disgust of a wife, but by the abuse of an enemy. At all
events the woman who marries a second time cannot say this. Marcia,
Cato’s younger daughter, on being asked after the loss of her husband
why she did not marry again, replied that she could not find a man who
wanted her more than her money. Her words teach us that men in choosing
their wives look for riches rather than for chastity, and that many in
marrying use not their eyes but their fingers. That *must* be an
excellent thing which is won by avarice! When the same lady was mourning
the loss of her husband, and the matrons asked what day would terminate
her grief, she replied, “The same that terminates my life.” I imagine
that a woman who thus followed her husband in heart and mind had no
thought of marrying again. Porcia, whom <span
id="fr_4604"></span>[4605](#fn_4604.md) Brutus took to wife, was a virgin;
Cato’s wife, <span id="fr_4605"></span>[4606](#fn_4605.md) Marcia, was not
a virgin; but Marcia went to and fro between Hortensius and Cato, and
was quite content to live without Cato; while <span
id="fr_4606"></span>[4607](#fn_4606.md) Porcia could not live without
Brutus; for women attach themselves closely to particular men, and to
keep to one is a strong link in the chain of affection. When a relative
urged Annia to marry again (she was of full age and a goodly person),
she answered, “I shall certainly not do so. For, if I find a good man, I
have no wish to be in fear of losing him: if a bad one, why must I put
up with a bad husband after having had a good one?” <span
id="fr_4607"></span>[4608](#fn_4607.md) Porcia the younger, on hearing a
certain lady of good character, who had a second husband, praised in her
house, replied, “A chaste and happy matron never marries more than
once.” Marcella the elder, on being asked by her mother if she was glad
she was married, answered, “So much so that I want nothing more.” <span
id="fr_4608"></span>[4609](#fn_4608.md) Valeria, sister of the Messalas,
when she lost her husband Servius, would marry no one else. <span
id="page_383">p. 383</span> <span id="vi.vi.I-Page_383"></span>On being
asked why not, she said that to her, her husband Servius was ever alive.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p422"></span>47. I feel that in giving this list of
women I have said far more than is customary in illustrating a point,
and that I might be justly censured by my learned reader. But what am I
to do when the women of our time press me with apostolic authority, and
before the first husband is buried, repeat from morning to night the
precepts which allow a second marriage? Seeing they despise the fidelity
which Christian purity dictates, let them at least learn chastity from
the heathen. A book *On Marriage*, worth its weight in gold, passes
under the name of <span id="fr_4609"></span>[4610](#fn_4609.md)
Theophrastus. In it the author asks whether a wise man marries. And
after laying down the conditions—that the wife must be fair, of good
character, and honest parentage, the husband in good health and of ample
means, and after saying that under these circumstances a wise man
sometimes enters the state of matrimony, he immediately proceeds thus:
“But all these conditions are seldom satisfied in marriage. A wise man
therefore must not take a wife. For in the first place his study of
philosophy will be hindered, and it is impossible for anyone to attend
to his books and his wife. Matrons want many things, costly dresses,
gold, jewels, great outlay, maid-servants, all kinds of furniture,
litters and gilded coaches. Then come curtain-lectures the livelong
night: she complains that one lady goes out better dressed than she:
that another is looked up to by all: ‘I am a poor despised nobody at the
ladies’ assemblies.’ ‘Why did you ogle that creature next door?’ ‘Why
were you talking to the maid?’ ‘What did you bring from the market?’ ‘I
am not allowed to have a single friend, or companion.’ She suspects that
her husband’s love goes the same way as her hate. There may be in some
neighbouring city the wisest of teachers; but if we have a wife we can
neither leave her behind, nor take the burden with us. To support a poor
wife, is hard: to put up with a rich one, is torture. Notice, too, that
in the case of a wife you cannot pick and choose: you must take her as
you find her. If she has a bad temper, or is a fool, if she has a
blemish, or is proud, or has bad breath, whatever her fault may be—all
this we learn after marriage. Horses, asses, cattle, even slaves of the
smallest worth, clothes, kettles, wooden seats, cups, and earthenware
pitchers, are first tried and then bought: a wife is the only thing that
is not shown before she is married, for fear she may not give
satisfaction. Our gaze must always be directed to her face, and we must
always praise her beauty: if you look at another woman, she thinks that
she is out of favour. She must be called my lady, her birth-day must be
kept, we must swear by her health and wish that she may survive us,
respect must be paid to the nurse, to the nursemaid, to the father’s
slave, to the foster-child, to the handsome hanger-on, to the curled
darling who manages her affairs, and to the eunuch who ministers to the
safe indulgence of her lust: names which are only a cloak for adultery.
Upon whomsoever she sets her heart, they must have her love though they
want her not. If you give her the management of the whole house, you
must yourself be her slave. If you reserve something for yourself, she
will not think you are loyal to her; but she will turn to strife and
hatred, and unless you quickly take care, she will have the poison
ready. If you introduce old women, and soothsayers, and prophets, and
vendors of jewels and silken clothing, you imperil her chastity; if you
shut the door upon them, she is injured and fancies you suspect her. But
what is the good of even a careful guardian, when an unchaste wife
cannot be watched, and a chaste one ought not to be? For necessity is
but a faithless keeper of chastity, and she alone really deserves to be
called pure, who is free to sin if she chooses. If a woman be fair, she
soon finds lovers; if she be ugly, it is easy to be wanton. It is
difficult to guard what many long for. It is annoying to have what no
one thinks worth possessing. But the misery of having an ugly wife is
less than that of watching a comely one. Nothing is safe, for which a
whole people sighs and longs. One man entices with his figure, another
with his brains, another with his wit, another with his open hand.
Somehow, or sometime, the fortress is captured which is attacked on all
sides. Men marry, indeed, so as to get a manager for the house, to
solace weariness, to banish solitude; but a faithful slave is a far
better manager, more submissive to the master, more observant of his
ways, than a wife who thinks she proves herself mistress if she acts in
opposition to her husband, that is, if she does what pleases her, not
what she is commanded. But friends, and servants who are under the
obligation of benefits received, are better able to wait upon us in
sickness than a wife who makes us responsible for her tears (she will
sell you enough to make a deluge for the hope of a legacy), boasts of
her anxiety, but drives her sick husband to the distraction of despair.
But if she herself is poorly, we must fall sick with her and never leave
her bedside. Or if she be a good and agreeable wife (how rare a bird she
is!), we have to share <span id="page_384">p. 384</span> <span
id="vi.vi.I-Page_384"></span>her groans in childbirth, and suffer
torture when she is in danger. A wise man can never be alone. He has
with him the good men of all time, and turns his mind freely wherever he
chooses. What is inaccessible to him in person he can embrace in
thought. And, if men are scarce, he converses with God. <span
id="fr_4610"></span>[4611](#fn_4610.md) He is never less alone than when
alone. Then again, to marry for the sake of children, so that our name
may not perish, or that we may have support in old age, and leave our
property without dispute, is the height of stupidity. For what is it to
us when we are leaving the world if another bears our name, when even a
son does not all at once take his father’s title, and there are
countless others who are called by the same name. Or what support in old
age is he whom you bring up, and who may die before you, or turn out a
reprobate? Or at all events when he reaches mature age, you may seem to
him long in dying. Friends and relatives whom you can judiciously love
are better and safer heirs than those whom you must make your heirs
whether you like it or not. Indeed, the surest way of having a good heir
is to ruin your fortune in a good cause while you live, not to leave the
fruit of your labour to be used you know not how.”

<span id="vi.vi.I-p425"></span>48. When Theophrastus thus discourses,
are there any of us, Christians, whose conversation is in heaven and who
daily say <span id="fr_4611"></span>[4612](#fn_4611.md) “I long to be
dissolved, and to be with Christ,” whom he does not put to the blush?
Shall a joint-heir of Christ really long for human heirs? And shall he
desire children and delight himself in a long line of descendants, who
will perhaps fall into the clutches of Antichrist, when we read
that <span id="fr_4612"></span>[4613](#fn_4612.md) Moses and <span
id="fr_4613"></span>[4614](#fn_4613.md) Samuel preferred other men to their
own sons, and did not count as their children those whom they saw to be
displeasing to God? When Cicero after <span
id="fr_4614"></span>[4615](#fn_4614.md) divorcing Terentia was requested
by <span id="fr_4615"></span>[4616](#fn_4615.md) Hirtius to marry his
sister, he <span id="fr_4616"></span>[4617](#fn_4616.md) set the matter
altogether on one side, and said that he could not possibly devote
himself to a wife and to philosophy. Meanwhile that excellent partner,
who had herself drunk wisdom at Tully’s fountains, married <span
id="fr_4617"></span>[4618](#fn_4617.md) Sallust his enemy, and took for her
third husband Messala Corvinus, and thus, as it were, passed through
three degrees of eloquence. Socrates had two wives, Xantippe and Myron,
grand-daughter of Aristides. They frequently quarrelled, and he was
accustomed to banter them for disagreeing about him, he being the
ugliest of men, with snub nose, bald forehead, rough-haired, and
bandy-legged. At last they planned an attack upon him, and having
punished him severely, and put him to flight, vexed him for a long time.
On one occasion when he opposed Xantippe; who from above was heaping
abuse upon him, the termagant soused him with dirty water, but he only
wiped his head and said, “I knew that a shower must follow such thunder
as that.” <span id="fr_4618"></span>[4619](#fn_4618.md) Metella, consort of
L. Sulla the <span id="fr_4619"></span>[4620](#fn_4619.md) Fortunate
(except in the matter of his wife) was <span
id="fr_4620"></span>[4621](#fn_4620.md) openly unchaste. It was the common
talk of Athens, as I learnt in my youthful years when we soon pick up
what is bad, and yet Sulla was in the dark, and first got to know the
secrets of his household through the abuse of his enemies. Cn. Pompey
had an impure wife <span id="fr_4621"></span>[4622](#fn_4621.md) Mucia, who
was surrounded by eunuchs from Pontus and troops of the countrymen of
Mithridates. Others thought that he knew all and submitted to it; but a
comrade told him during the campaign, and the conqueror of the whole
world was dismayed at the sad intelligence. <span
id="fr_4622"></span>[4623](#fn_4622.md) M. Cato, the Censor, had a wife
Actoria Paula, a woman of low origin, fond of drink, violent, and (who
would believe it?) haughty to Cato. I say this for fear anyone may
suppose that in marrying a poor woman he has secured peace. When <span
id="fr_4623"></span>[4624](#fn_4623.md) Philip king of Macedon, against
whom <span id="fr_4624"></span>[4625](#fn_4624.md) Demosthenes thundered in
his Philippics, was entering his bed-room as usual, his wife <span
id="page_385">p. 385</span> <span id="vi.vi.I-Page_385"></span>in a
passion shut him out. Finding himself excluded he held his tongue, and
consoled himself for the insult by reading a tragic poem. <span
id="fr_4625"></span>[4626](#fn_4625.md) Gorgias the Rhetorician recited his
excellent treatise on Concord to the Greeks, then at variance among
themselves, at Olympia. Whereupon <span
id="fr_4626"></span>[4627](#fn_4626.md) Melanthius his enemy observed:
“Here is a man who teaches us concord, and yet could not make concord
between himself his wife, and maid-servant, three persons in one house.”
The truth was that his wife envied the beauty of the girl, and drove the
purest of men wild with daily quarrels. Whole tragedies of Euripides are
censures on women. Hence Hermione says, <span
id="fr_4627"></span>[4628](#fn_4627.md) “The counsels of evil women have
beguiled me.” In the semi-barbarous and remote city <span
id="fr_4628"></span>[4629](#fn_4628.md) Leptis it is the custom for a
daughter-in-law on <span id="fr_4629"></span>[4630](#fn_4629.md) the second
day to beg the loan of a jar from her mother-in-law. The latter at once
denies the request, and we see how true was the remark of <span
id="fr_4630"></span>[4631](#fn_4630.md) Terence, ambiguously expressed on
purpose—“How is this? do all mothers-in-law hate their
daughters-in-law?” We read of a certain Roman noble who, when his
friends found fault with him for having divorced a wife, beautiful,
chaste, and rich, put out his foot and said to them, “And the shoe
before you looks new and elegant, yet no one but myself knows where it
pinches.” Herodotus <span id="fr_4631"></span>[4632](#fn_4631.md) tells us
that a woman puts off her modesty with her clothes. And our own comic
poet <span id="fr_4632"></span>[4633](#fn_4632.md) thinks the man fortunate
who has never been married. Why should I refer to Pasiphaë, <span
id="fr_4633"></span>[4634](#fn_4633.md) Clytemnestra, and Eriphyle, the
first of whom, the wife of a king and swimming in pleasure, is said to
have lusted for a bull, the second to have killed her: husband for the
sake of an adulterer, the third to have betrayed Amphiaraus, and to have
preferred a gold necklace to the welfare of her husband. In all the
bombast of tragedy and the overthrow of houses, cities, and kingdoms, it
is the wives and concubines who stir up strife. Parents take up arms
against their children: unspeakable banquets are served: and on account
of the rape of one wretched woman Europe and Asia are involved in a ten
years’ war. We read of some who were divorced the day after they were
married, and immediately married again. Both husbands are to blame, both
he who was so soon dissatisfied, and he who was so soon pleased.
Epicurus the patron of pleasure (though <span
id="fr_4634"></span>[4635](#fn_4634.md) Metrodorus his disciple married
Leontia) says that a wise man can seldom marry, because marriage has
many drawbacks. And as riches, honours, bodily health, and other things
which we call indifferent, are neither good nor bad, but stand as it
were midway, and become good and bad according to the use and issue, so
wives stand on the border line of good and ill. It is, moreover, a
serious matter for a wise man to be in doubt whether he is going to
marry a good or a bad woman. <span id="fr_4635"></span>[4636](#fn_4635.md)
Chrysippus ridiculously maintains that a wise man should marry, that he
may not outrage Jupiter <span id="fr_4636"></span>[4637](#fn_4636.md)
Gamelius and Genethlius. For upon that principle the Latins would not
marry at all, since they have no Jupiter who presides over marriage. But
if, as he thinks, the life of men is determined by the names of gods,
whoever chooses to sit will offend Jupiter <span
id="fr_4637"></span>[4638](#fn_4637.md) Stator.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p453"></span>49. Aristotle and Plutarch and our Seneca
have written treatises on matrimony, out of which we have already made
some extracts and now add a few more. “The love of beauty is the
forgetting of reason and the near neighbour of madness; a foul blot
little in keeping with a sound mind. It confuses counsel, breaks high
and generous spirits, draws away men from great thoughts to mean ones;
it makes men querulous, ill-tempered, foolhardy, cruelly imperious,
servile flatterers, good for nothing, at last not even for love itself.
For although in the intensity of passion it burns like a raging fire, it
wastes much time through suspicions, tears, and complaints: it begets
hatred of itself, and at last hates itself.” The course of love is laid
bare in Plato’s Phædrus from beginning to end, and Lysias explains all
its drawbacks—how it is led not by reason, but by frenzy, and in
particular is a harsh gaoler over lovely wives. Seneca, too, relates
that he knew an accomplished man who before going out used to tie <span
id="page_386">p. 386</span> <span id="vi.vi.I-Page_386"></span>his
wife’s garter upon his breast, and could not bear to be absent from her
for a quarter of an hour; and this pair would never take a drink unless
husband and wife alternately put their lips to the cup; and they did
other things just as absurd in the extravagant outbursts of their warm
but blind affection. Their love was of honourable birth, but it grew out
of all proportion. And it makes no difference how honourable may be the
cause of a man’s insanity. Hence <span
id="fr_4638"></span>[4639](#fn_4638.md) Xystus in his Sentences tells us
that “He who too ardently loves his own wife is an adulterer.” It is
disgraceful to love another man’s wife at all, or one’s own too much. A
wise man ought to love his wife with judgment, not with passion. Let a
man govern his voluptuous impulses, and not rush headlong into
intercourse. There is nothing blacker than to love a wife as if she were
an adulteress. Men who say they have contracted marriage and are
bringing up children, for the good of their country and of the race,
should at least imitate the brutes, and not destroy their offspring in
the womb; nor should they appear in the character of lovers, but of
husbands. In some cases marriage has grown out of adultery: and,
shameful to relate! men have tried to teach their wives chastity after
having taken their chastity away. Marriages of that sort are quickly
dissolved when lust is satiated. The first allurement gone, the charm is
lost. What shall I say, says Seneca, of the poor men who in numbers are
bribed to take the name of husband in order to evade the laws
promulgated against bachelors? How can he who is married under such
conditions be a guide to morality, teach chastity, and maintain the
authority of a husband? It is the saying of a very learned man, that
chastity must be preserved at all costs, and that when it is lost all
virtue falls to the ground. This holds the primacy of all virtues in
woman. This it is that makes up for a wife’s poverty, enhances her
riches, redeems her deformity, gives grace to her beauty; it makes her
act in a way worthy of her forefathers whose blood it does not taint
with bastard offspring; of her children, who through it have no need to
blush for their mother, or to be in doubt about their father; and above
all, of herself, since it defends her from external violation. There is
no greater calamity connected with captivity than to be the victim of
another’s lust. The consulship sheds lustre upon men; eloquence gives
eternal renown; military glory and a triumph immortalise an obscure
family. Many are the spheres ennobled by splendid ability. The virtue of
woman is, in a special sense, purity. It was this that made <span
id="fr_4639"></span>[4640](#fn_4639.md) Lucretia the equal of Brutus, if it
did not make her his superior, since Brutus learnt from a woman the
impossibility of being a slave. It was this that made <span
id="fr_4640"></span>[4641](#fn_4640.md) Cornelia a fit match for Gracchus,
and <span id="fr_4641"></span>[4642](#fn_4641.md) Porcia for a second
Brutus. <span id="fr_4642"></span>[4643](#fn_4642.md) Tanaquil is better
known than her husband. His name, like the names of many other kings, is
lost in the mists of antiquity. She, through a virtue rare among women,
is too deeply rooted in the hearts of all ages for her memory ever to
perish. Let my married sisters copy the examples of <span
id="fr_4643"></span>[4644](#fn_4643.md) Theano, <span
id="fr_4644"></span>[4645](#fn_4644.md) Cleobuline, Gorgente, <span
id="fr_4645"></span>[4646](#fn_4645.md) Timoclia, the <span
id="fr_4646"></span>[4647](#fn_4646.md) Claudias and Cornelias; and when
they find the Apostle conceding second marriage to depraved women, they
will read that before the light of our religion shone upon the world
wives of one husband ever held high rank among matrons, that by their
hands the sacred rites of Fortuna <span
id="fr_4647"></span>[4648](#fn_4647.md) Muliebris were performed, that a
priest or <span id="fr_4648"></span>[4649](#fn_4648.md) Flamen twice <span
id="fr_4649"></span>[4650](#fn_4649.md) married was unknown, that the
high-priests of Athens to this day <span
id="fr_4650"></span>[4651](#fn_4650.md) emasculate themselves by drinking
hemlock, and once they have been drawn in to the pontificate, cease to
be men.

with him at Rome. Unlike other Gnostics he professed to be purely
Christian in his doctrines. He is specially noted for his violent
treatment of Scripture: he rejected the whole of the Old Testament,
while of the New he acknowledged only the Gospel of S. Luke and ten of
S. Paul’s Epistles, and from these he expunged whatever he did not
approve of. His sect lasted until the sixth century.

The Revised Ver. translates “let marriage be, etc.” There is no verb in
the original, the sentence being probably designed to be a Christian
proverb, and capable of serving either as an *assertion* or as a
precept. The revised rendering is preferred by the chief modern
commentators.

of Themistocles. He fought at Marathon (490), and although in exile did
good service at Salamis (480). He was now recalled, and after commanding

<span id="vi.vi.I-p172"></span> Timnath-Serah was the original name of
Joshua’s inheritance ([Josh. xix.
50](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#050)<span id="vi.vi.I-p172.1"></span>.md),
but in [Judges ii. 9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#009.md)<span
id="vi.vi.I-p172.2"></span>, we find the name changed to Timnath-Heres.
Timnath-Serah and the tomb of its illustrious owner were shown in the
time of Jerome (Letter cviii. 13). “Paula wondered greatly that he who
assigned men their possessions had chosen for himself a rough and rocky
spot.” Jerome is looking at the inheritance with the eyes of an ardent
controversialist when he describes it as “the fairest spot in the land
of Judah.”

The Greek word in the text (“without genealogy”) is unknown to secular
writers, and occurs here only in the New Test. It cannot mean *without
descent* (see verse 6). *Unmarried* appears to be a false inference from
this supposed meaning. Ignatius also (Ep. ad. Philad.) reckoned
Melchizedek among celibates. Rev. Version translates, “without
genealogy,” *i.e.,* his ancestry was *unrecorded.* See Farrar’s “Early
Days of Christianity,” pop. ed., p. 221.

The text has been much tampered with by the advocates or opponents of
celibacy. The reading first quoted by Jerome is that of F, a manuscript
of the eighth or ninth century, and is found in Tertullian; the other
chief readings introduce the Greek equivalent for *sister,* either in
the sing. or plural. The Rev. Version renders, “have we no right to lead
about a *wife* that is a believer” (or sister). Augustine, Tertullian,
Theodoret, &c., together with Cornelius-a-Lapide and Estius among the
moderns, agree with Jerome in referring the passage to holy women who
ministered to the Apostles as they did to the Lord Himself. The third
canon of Nicæa is supposed to be directed against the practice
encouraged by this interpretation of the Apostle’s words.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p385"></span> According to the law of Numa, the
punishment of a Vestal Virgin for violating the vow of chastity was
stoning to death. Tarquinius Priscus first enacted that the offender
should be buried alive, after being stripped of her badges of office,
scourged and attired like a corpse. “From the time of the triumvirs each
\[Vestal\] was preceded by a lictor when she went abroad; consuls and
prætors made way for them, and lowered their fasces; even the tribunes
of the plebs respected their holy character, and if any one passed under
their litter, he was put to death.”

*Stromata* (*i.e.* literally, *patchwork*) or *Miscellanies,* Bk. iv.,
relates the same story and gives the names of the daughters. The
Diodorus referred to in the text lived at Alexandria in the reign of
Ptolemy Sorer (<span class="c17"><span
id="vi.vi.I-p399.2"></span>b.c.</span> 323–285), by whom he was said to
have been surnamed *Cronos* or *Saturn*, on account of his inability to
solve *at once* some dialectic problem when dining with the king,
perhaps with a play upon the word *chronos* (time), or with a sarcastic
allusion to Cronos as the introducer of the arts of civilized life. The
philosopher is said to have taken the disgrace so much to heart, that he
wrote a treatise on the problem, and then died in despair. Another
account derives his name from his teacher Apollonius Cronus.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p413"></span> Protesilaus was the first of the Greeks
to fall at Troy. According to some accounts he was slain by Hector. When
her husband was slain Laodamia begged the gods to allow her to converse
with him for only 3 hours. The request having been granted, Hermes led
Protesilaus back to the upper world, and when he died a second time,
Laodamia died with him.

married to M. Bibulus and had borne him three children. He died in 48.

<span id="vi.vi.I-p421"></span> Jerome, apparently, makes a mistake
here. Valeria, sister of the Messalas, married Sulla towards the end of
his life. Valeria, the widow of Galerius, after the death of her husband
in 311, rejected the proposals of Maximinus. Her consequent sufferings
are related by Gibbon in his fourteenth chapter.

Hirtius and Cicero though opposed to each other in politics were on good

fell ill during the celebration of Sulla’s triumph on account of his
victory over Mithridates in 81; and as her recovery was hopeless, Sulla
for religious reasons divorced her. She soon afterwards died, and Sulla
honoured her memory with a splendid funeral.
