<span id="v.CXXIV-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.CXXIV-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXIV. To Avitus.</span>

<span id="v.CXXIV-p2"></span>Avitus to whom this letter is addressed is
probably the same person who induced Jerome to write to Salvina (see
Letter LXXIX., §I, ante). The occasion of writing is as follows. Ten
years previously (that is to say in <span class="c17"><span
id="v.CXXIV-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 399 or 400) Pammachius had asked
Jerome to supply him with a correct version of Origen’s *First
Principles* to enable him to detect the variations introduced by Rufinus
into his rendering. This Jerome willingly did (see Letters LXXXIII. and
LXXXIV.) but when the work in its integrity was perused by Pammachius he
thought it so erroneous in doctrine that he determined not to circulate
it. However, “a certain brother” induced him to lend the <span
class="c17"><span id="v.CXXIV-p2.2"></span>ms.</span> to him for a short
time; and then, when he had got it into his hands, had a hasty and
incorrect transcript made, which he forthwith published much to the
chagrin of Pammachius. Falling into the hands of Avitus a copy of this
much perplexed him and he seems to have appealed to Jerome for an
explanation. This the latter now gives forwarding at the same time an
authentic edition of his version of the *First Principles*. The date of
the letter is <span class="c17"><span
id="v.CXXIV-p2.3"></span>a.d.</span> 409 or 410.

<span id="v.CXXIV-p3"></span>1. About ten years ago that saintly man
Pammachius sent me a copy of a certain person’s rendering, <span
id="fr_3353"></span>[3354](#fn_3353.md) or rather misrendering, of Origen’s
*First Principles;* with a request that in a Latin version I should give
the true sense of the Greek and should set down the writer’s words for
good or for evil without bias in either direction. <span
id="fr_3354"></span>[3355](#fn_3354.md) When I did as he wished and sent
him the book, <span id="fr_3355"></span>[3356](#fn_3355.md) he was shocked
to read it and locked it up in his desk lest being circulated it might
wound the souls of many. However, a certain brother, who had “a zeal for
God but not according to knowledge,” <span
id="fr_3356"></span>[3357](#fn_3356.md) asked for a loan of the manuscript
that he might read it; and, as he promised to return it without delay,
Pammachius, thinking no harm could happen in so short a time,
unsuspectingly consented. Hereupon he who had borrowed the book to read,
with the aid of scribes copied the whole of it and gave it back much
sooner than he had promised. Then with the same rashness or—to use a
less severe term—thoughtlessness he made bad worse by confiding to
others what he had thus stolen. Moreover, since a bulky treatise on an
abstruse subject is difficult to reproduce with accuracy, especially if
it has to be taken down surreptitiously and in a hurry, order and sense
were sacrificed in several passages. Whence it comes, my dear Avitus,
that you ask me to send you a copy of my version as made for Pammachius
and not for the public, a garbled edition of which has been published by
the aforesaid brother.

<span id="v.CXXIV-p8"></span>2. Take then what you have asked for; but
know that there are countless things in the book to be abhorred, and
that, as the Lord says, you will have to walk among scorpions and
serpents. <span id="fr_3357"></span>[3358](#fn_3357.md) It begins by saying
that Christ was made God’s son not born; <span
id="fr_3358"></span>[3359](#fn_3358.md) that God the Father, as He is by
nature invisible, is invisible even to the Son; <span
id="fr_3359"></span>[3360](#fn_3359.md) that the Son, who is the likeness
of the invisible Father, compared with the Father is not the truth but
compared with us who cannot receive the truth of the almighty Father
seems a figure of the truth so that we perceive the majesty and
magnitude of the greater in the less, the Father’s glory limited in the
Son; <span id="fr_3360"></span>[3361](#fn_3360.md) that God the Father is a
light incomprehensible and that Christ compared with him is but a minute
brightness, although by reason of our incapacity to us he appears a
great one. <span id="fr_3361"></span>[3362](#fn_3361.md) The Father and the
Son are compared to two statues, a larger one and a small; the first
filling the world and being somehow invisible through its size, the
second cognisable by the eyes of men. <span
id="fr_3362"></span>[3363](#fn_3362.md) God the Father omnipotent the
writer terms good and of perfect goodness; but of the Son he says: “He
is not good but an emanation and likeness of goodness; not good
absolutely but only with a qualification, as ‘the good shepherd’ and the
like.” <span id="fr_3363"></span>[3364](#fn_3363.md) The Holy Spirit he
places after the Father and the Son as third in dignity and honour. And
while he de<span id="page_239">p. 239</span> <span
id="v.CXXIV-Page_239"></span>clares that he does not know whether the
Holy Spirit is created or uncreated, <span
id="fr_3364"></span>[3365](#fn_3364.md) he has later on given his own
opinion that except God the Father alone there is nothing uncreated.
“The Son,” he states, “is inferior to the Father, inasmuch as He is
second and the Father first; and the Holy Spirit which dwells in all the
saints is inferior to the Son. In the same way the power of the Father
is greater than that of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Likewise the
power of the Son is greater than that of the Holy Spirit, and as a
consequence the Holy Spirit in its turn has greater virtue than other
things called holy.” <span id="fr_3365"></span>[3366](#fn_3365.md)

<span id="v.CXXIV-p18"></span>3. Then, when he comes to deal with
rational creatures and to describe their lapse into earthly bodies as
due to their own negligence, he goes on to say: “Surely it argues great
negligence and sloth for a soul so far to empty itself as to fall into
sin and allow itself to be tied to the material body of an unreasoning
brute;” and in a subsequent passage: “These reasonings induce me to
suppose that it is by their own free act that some are numbered with
God’s saints and servants, and that it was through their own fault that
others fell from holiness into such negligence that they were changed
into forces of an opposite kind.” <span
id="fr_3366"></span>[3367](#fn_3366.md) He maintains that after every end a
fresh beginning springs forth and an end from each beginning, and that
wholesale variation is possible; so that one who is now a human being
may in another world become a demon, while one who by reason of his
negligence is now a demon may hereafter be placed in a more material
body and thus become a human being. <span
id="fr_3367"></span>[3368](#fn_3367.md) So far does he carry this
transforming process that on his theory an archangel may become the
devil and the devil in turn be changed back into an archangel. “Such as
have wavered or faltered but have not altogether fallen shall be made
subject, for rule and government and guidance, to better things—to
principalities and powers, to thrones and dominations”; and of these
perhaps another human race will be formed, when in the words of Isaiah
there shall be “new heavens and a new earth.’ <span
id="fr_3368"></span>[3369](#fn_3368.md) But such as have not deserved to
return through humanity to their former estate shall become the devil
and his angels, demons of the worst sort; and according to what they
have done shall have special duties assigned to them in particular
worlds.” Moreover, the very demons and rulers of darkness in any world
or worlds, if they are willing to turn to better things, may become
human beings and so come back to their first beginning. That is to say,
after they have borne the discipline of punishment and torture for a
longer or a shorter time in human bodies, they may again reach the
angelic pinnacles from which they have fallen. Hence it may be shewn
that we men may change into any other reasonable beings, and that not
once only or on emergency but time after time; we and angels shall
become demons if we neglect our duty; and demons, if they will take to
themselves virtues, may attain to the rank of angels.

<span id="v.CXXIV-p22"></span>4. Bodily substances too are to pass away
utterly or else at the end of all things will become highly rarified
like the sky and æther and other subtle bodies. It is clear that these
principles must affect the writer’s view of the resurrection. The sun
also and the moon and the rest of the constellations are alive. Nay
more; as we men by reason of our sins are enveloped in bodies material
and sluggish; so the lights of heaven have for like reasons received
bodies more or less luminous, and demons have been for more serious
faults clothed with starry frames. This, he argues, is the view of the
apostle who writes:—“the creation has been subjected to vanity and shall
be delivered for the revealing of the sons of God.” <span
id="fr_3369"></span>[3370](#fn_3369.md) That it may not be supposed that I
am imputing to him ideas of my own I shall give his actual words. “At
the end and consummation of the world,” he writes, “when souls and
beings endowed with reason shall be released from prison by the Lord,
they will move slowly or fly quickly according as they have previously
been slothful or energetic. And as all of them have free will and are
free to choose virtue or vice, those who choose the latter will be much
worse off than they now are. But those who choose the former will
improve their condition. Their movements and decisions in this direction
or in that will determine their various futures; whether, that is,
angels are to become men or demons, and whether demons are to become men
or angels.” Then after adducing various arguments in support of his
thesis and maintaining that while not incapable of virtue the devil has
yet not chosen to be virtuous, he has finally reasoned with much
diffuseness that an angel, a human soul, and a demon—all according to
him of one nature but of different wills—may in punishment for great
negligence or folly be transformed into brutes. Moreover, to avoid the
agony of punishment and the burning flame the more sensitive may choose
to become low organisms, to dwell in water, to assume the shape of this
or that animal; so that we have reason to fear a metamorphosis not only
into four-footed things but even into fishes. Then, <span
id="page_240">p. 240</span> <span id="v.CXXIV-Page_240"></span>lest he
should be held guilty of maintaining with Pythagoras the transmigration
of souls, he winds up the wicked reasoning with which he has wounded his
reader by saying: “I must not be taken to make dogmas of these things;
they are only thrown out as conjectures to shew that they are not
altogether overlooked.”

<span id="v.CXXIV-p24"></span>5. In his second book he maintains a
plurality of worlds; not, however, as Epicurus taught, many like ones
existing at once, but a new one beginning each time that the old comes
to an end. There was a world before this world of ours, and after it
there will be first one and then another and so on in regular
succession. He is in doubt whether one world shall be so completely
similar to another as to leave no room for any difference between them,
or whether one world shall never wholly be indistinguishable from
another. And again a little farther on he writes: “if, as the course of
the discussion makes necessary, all things can live without body, all
bodily existence shall be swallowed up and that which once has been made
out of nothing shall again be reduced to nothing. And yet a time will
come when its use will be once more necessary.” And in the same context:
“but if, as reason and the authority of scripture shew, this corruptible
shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality,
death shall be swallowed up in victory and corruption in
incorruption. <span id="fr_3370"></span>[3371](#fn_3370.md) And it may be
that all bodily existence shall be removed, for it is only in this that
death can operate.” And a little farther on: “if these things are not
contrary to the faith, it may be that we shall some day live in a
disembodied state. Moreover, if only he is fully subject to Christ who
is disembodied, and if all must be made subject to Him, we too shall
lose our bodies when we become fully subject to Him.” And in the same
passage: “if all are to be made subject to God, all shall lay aside
their bodies; and then all bodily existence shall be brought to nought.
But if through the fall of reasonable beings it is a second time
required it will reappear. For God has left souls to strive and
struggle, to teach them that full and complete victory is to be attained
not by their own efforts but by His grace. And so to my mind worlds vary
with the sins which cause them, and those are exploded theories which
maintain that all worlds are alike.” And again: “three conjectures occur
to me with regard to the end; it is for the reader to determine which is
nearest to the truth. For either we shall be bodiless when being made
subject to Christ we shall be made subject to God and He shall be all in
all; or as things made subject to Christ shall be with Christ Himself
made subject to God and brought under one law, so all substance shall be
refined into its most perfect form and rarified into æther which is a
pure and uncompounded essence; or else the sphere which I have called
motionless and all that it contains will be dissolved into nothing, and
the sphere in which the antizone <span
id="fr_3371"></span>[3372](#fn_3371.md) itself is contained shall be called
‘good ground,’ <span id="fr_3372"></span>[3373](#fn_3372.md) and that other
sphere which in its revolution surrounds the earth and goes by the name
of heaven shall be reserved for the abode of the saints.”

<span id="v.CXXIV-p28"></span>6. In speaking thus does he not most
clearly follow the error of the heathen and foist upon the simple faith
of Christians the ravings of philosophy? In the same book he writes: “it
remains that God is invisible. But if He is by nature invisible, He must
be so even to the Saviour.” And lower down: “no soul which has descended
into a human body has borne upon it so true an impress of its previous
character as Christ’s soul of which He says: ‘no man taketh it from me,
but I lay it down of myself.’” <span
id="fr_3373"></span>[3374](#fn_3373.md) And in another place: “we must
carefully consider whether souls, when they have won salvation and have
attained to the blessed life, may not cease to be souls. For as the Lord
and Saviour came to seek and to save that which was lost <span
id="fr_3374"></span>[3375](#fn_3374.md) that it might cease to be lost; so
the lost soul which the Lord came to save, when saved, will cease to be
a soul. We must ask ourselves whether, as the lost was not lost once and
again will not be, the soul likewise may have been and again may be not
a soul.” <span id="fr_3375"></span>[3376](#fn_3375.md) And after a good
many remarks upon the soul he brings in the following, “<span
class="Greek"><span id="v.CXXIV-p31.1"></span>νοῦς</span> or”
intelligence by falling becomes a soul; and by acquiring virtue this
will become intelligence again. This at least is a fair inference from
the case of Esau who for his old sins is condemned to lead a lower life.
And concerning the heavenly bodies we must make a similar
acknowledgment. The soul of the sun—or whatever else you like to call
it—does not date its existence from the creation of the world; it
already existed before it entered its shining and glowing body. So also
with the moon and stars. From antecedent causes they have been made
subject to vanity not willingly but for future reward, <span
id="fr_3376"></span>[3377](#fn_3376.md) and are forced to do not their own
will but the creator’s who has assigned to them their several spheres.”

<span id="v.CXXIV-p33"></span>7. Hellfire, moreover, and the torments
with <span id="page_241">p. 241</span> <span
id="v.CXXIV-Page_241"></span>which holy scripture threatens sinners he
explains not as external punishments but as the pangs of guilty
consciences when by God’s power the memory of our transgressions is set
before our eyes. “The whole crop of our sins grows up afresh from seeds
which remain in the soul, and all our dishonourable and undutiful acts
are again pictured before our gaze. Thus it is the fire of conscience
and the stings of remorse which torture the mind as it looks back on
former self-indulgence.” And again: “but perhaps this coarse and earthly
body ought to be described as mist and darkness; for at the end of this
world and when it becomes necessary to pass into another, the like
darkness will lead to the like physical birth.” In speaking thus he
clearly pleads for the transmigration of souls as taught by Pythagoras
and Plato. <span id="fr_3377"></span>[3378](#fn_3377.md) And at the end of
the second book in dealing with our perfection he has said: “when we
shall have made such progress as not only to cease to be flesh or body
but perhaps also to cease to be souls our perfect intelligence and
perception, undimmed with any mist of passion, will discern reasonable
and intelligible substances face to face.

<span id="v.CXXIV-p35"></span>8. In the third book the following faulty
statements are contained. “If we once admit that, when one vessel is
made to honour and another to dishonour, <span
id="fr_3378"></span>[3379](#fn_3378.md) this is due to antecedent causes;
why may we not revert to the mystery of the soul and allow that it is
loved in one and hated in another because of its past actions, before in
Jacob it becomes a supplanter and before in Esau it is
supplanted?” <span id="fr_3379"></span>[3380](#fn_3379.md) And again: “the
fact that souls are made some to honour and some to dishonour is to be
explained by their previous history.” And in the same place: “on this
hypothesis of mine a vessel made to honour which fails to fulfil its
object will in another world become a vessel made to dishonour; and
contrariwise a vessel which has from a previous fault been condemned to
dishonour will, if it accepts correction in this present life, become in
the new creation a vessel ‘sanctified and meet for the Master’s use and
prepared unto every good work.’” <span
id="fr_3380"></span>[3381](#fn_3380.md) And he immediately goes on to say:
“I believe that men who begin with small faults may become so hardened
in wickedness that, if they do not repent and turn to better things,
they must become inhuman energies; <span
id="fr_3381"></span>[3382](#fn_3381.md) and contrariwise that hostile and
demonic beings may in course of time so far heal their wounds and check
the current of their former sins that they may attain to the abode of
the perfect. As I have often said, in those countless and unceasing
worlds in which the soul lives and has its being some grow worse and
worse until they reach the lowest depths of degradation; while others in
those lowest depths grow better and better until they reach the
perfection of virtue.” Thus he tries to shew that men, or rather their
souls, may become demons; and that demons in turn may be restored to the
rank of angels. In the same book he writes: “this too must be
considered; why the human soul is diversely acted upon now by influences
of one kind and now by influences of another.” And he surmises that this
is due to conduct which has preceded birth. It is for this, he argues,
that John leaps in his mother’s womb when at Mary’s salutation Elizabeth
declares herself unworthy of her notice. <span
id="fr_3382"></span>[3383](#fn_3382.md) And he immediately subjoins: “on
the other hand infants that are hardly weaned are possessed with evil
spirits and become diviners and soothsayers; <span
id="fr_3383"></span>[3384](#fn_3383.md) indeed, some are indwelt from their
earliest years with the spirit of a python. Now as they have done
nothing to bring upon themselves these visitations, one who holds that
nothing happens without God’s permission, and that all things are
governed by His justice, cannot suppose that God’s providence has
abandoned them without good reason.”

<span id="v.CXXIV-p42"></span>9. Again, of the world he writes thus:
“The belief commends itself to me that there was a world before this
world and that after it there will be another. Do you wish to know that
after the decay of this world there will be a new one? Hear the words of
Isaiah: ‘the new heavens and the new earth which I will make shall
remain before me.’ <span id="fr_3384"></span>[3385](#fn_3384.md) Do you
wish to know that before the making of this world there have previously
been others? Listen to the Preacher who says: ‘the thing which hath
been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which
shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. Is there
anything whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already
of old time, which was before us.’ <span
id="fr_3385"></span>[3386](#fn_3385.md) A passage which proves not only
that other worlds have been but that other worlds shall be; not,
however, simultaneously and side by side but one after another.” And he
immediately adds: “I hold that heaven is the abode of the deity, the
true place of rest; and that it was there that reasonable creatures
enjoyed their ancient bliss, before coming down to a lower plane and
exchanging the invisible for the visible, they fell to the earth and
came to need material bodies. Now that they have fallen, God the creator
has made for them bodies suitable to their surroundings; and has
fashioned this visible world, and has sent into it ministers to ensure
the salva<span id="page_242">p. 242</span> <span
id="v.CXXIV-Page_242"></span>tion and correction of the fallen. Of these
ministers some have held assigned positions and have been subject to the
world’s necessary laws; while others have intelligently performed duties
laid upon them in times and seasons determined by God’s plan. To the
former class belong the sun, moon, and stars called by the apostle ‘the
creation;’ and these have had allotted to them the heights of heaven.
Now the creation is subjected to vanity <span
id="fr_3386"></span>[3387](#fn_3386.md) because it is encased in material
bodies and visible to the eye. And yet it is ‘made subject to vanity not
willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope.’
Others again of the second class, at particular places and times known
to their Maker only, we believe to be His angels sent to steer the
world.” A little farther on he says: “the affairs of the world are so
ordered by Providence that while some angels fall from heaven others
freely glide down to earth. The former are hurled down against their
will; the latter descend from choice alone. The former are forced to
continue in a distasteful service for a fixed period; the latter
spontaneously embrace the task of lending a hand to those who fall.”
Again he writes: “whence it follows that these different movements
result in the creation of different worlds; and that this world of ours
will be succeeded by one quite unlike it. Now, as regards this falling
and rising, this rewarding of virtue and punishment of vice, whether
they take place in the past, present, or future, God, the creator, can
alone apportion desert and make all things converge to one end. For He
only knows why He allows some to follow their own inclination and to
descend from the higher planes to the lowest; and why He visits others
and giving them His hand draws them back to their former state and
places them once more in heaven.”

<span id="v.CXXIV-p46"></span>10. In discussing the end of the world he
has made use of the following language. “Since, as I have often said, a
new beginning springs from the end, it may be asked whether bodies will
then continue to exist, or whether, when they have been annihilated, we
shall live without bodies and be incorporeal as we know God to be. Now
there can be no doubt but that, if bodies or, as the apostle calls them,
visible things, belong only to our sensible world, the life of the
disembodied will be incorporeal.” And a little farther on: “when the
apostle writes, ‘the creation shall be delivered from the bondage of
corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God,’ <span
id="fr_3387"></span>[3388](#fn_3387.md) I explain his words thus.
Reasonable and incorporeal beings are the highest of God’s creatures,
for not being clothed with bodies they are not the slaves of corruption.
Since where there are bodies, there corruption is sure to be found. But
hereafter ‘the creation shall be delivered from the bondage of
corruption,’ and then men shall receive the glory of the children of God
and God shall be all in all.” And in the same passage he writes: “that
the final state will be an incorporeal one is rendered credible by the
words of our Saviour’s prayer: ‘as thou, Father, art in me and I in
thee, that they also may be one in us.’ <span
id="fr_3388"></span>[3389](#fn_3388.md) For we ought to realize what God is
and what the Saviour will finally be, and how the likeness to the Father
and the Son here promised to the Saints consists in this that as They
are one in Themselves so we shall be one in Them. For if in the end the
life of the Saints is to be assimilated to the life of God, we must
either admit that the Lord of the universe is clothed with a body and
that he is enveloped in matter as we are in flesh; or, if it is
unbecoming to suppose this, especially in persons who have but small
clues from which to infer God’s majesty and to guess at the glory of His
innate and transcendent nature, we are reduced to the following dilemma.
Either we shall always have bodies and in that case must despair of ever
being like God; or, if the blessedness of the life of God is really
promised to us, the conditions of His life must be the conditions of
ours.”

<span id="v.CXXIV-p49"></span>11. These passages prove what his view is
regarding the resurrection. For he evidently maintains that all bodies
will perish and that we shall be incorporeal as according to him we were
before we received our present bodies. Again when he comes to argue for
a variety of worlds and to maintain that angels will become demons,
demons either angels or men, and men in their turn demons; in a word
that everything will be turned into something else, he thus sums up his
own opinion: “no doubt, after an interval matter will exist afresh and
bodies will be formed and a different world will be created to meet the
varying wills of reasonable beings who, having forfeited the perfect
bliss which continues to the end, have gradually fallen into so great
wickedness as to change their nature and refuse to keep their first
estate of unalloyed blessedness. Many reasonable beings, it is right to
say, keep it until a second, a third, and a fourth world, and give God
no ground for changing their condition. Others deteriorate so little
that they seem to have lost hardly anything, and others again have to be
hurled headlong into the abyss. God who orders all things alone knows
how to use each class according to its <span id="page_243">p. 243</span>
<span id="v.CXXIV-Page_243"></span>deserts in a suitable sphere; for He
only understands opportunities and motives and the course in which the
world must be steered. Thus one who has borne away the palm for
wickedness and has sunk into the lowest degradation will in the world
which is hereafter to be fashioned be made a devil, a kind of first
fruits of the Lord’s handiwork, to be a laughing stock to the angels who
have lost their first virtue.” What is this but to argue that the sinful
men of this world may become a devil and demons in another; and
contrariwise that those who are now demons may hereafter become either
men or angels? And after a lengthy discussion in which he maintains that
all corporeal creatures must exchange their material for subtle and
spiritual bodies and that all substance must become one pure and
inconceivably bright body, of which the human mind can at present form
no conception, he winds up thus:—“‘God shall be all in all;’ that is to
say, all bodily existence shall be made as perfect as possible; it shall
be brought into the divine essence, than which there is none better.”

<span id="v.CXXIV-p50"></span>12. In the fourth and last book of his
work the following passages deserve the church’s condemnation. “It may
be that as, when men die in this world by the separation of soul and
body, they are allotted different positions in hell according to the
difference in their works; so when angels die, out of the system of the
heavenly Jerusalem, they come down to this world as a hell and are
placed on earth according to their deserts.” And again: “as we have
compared the souls which pass from this world to hell with those which
as they come from heaven to us are in a manner dead; so we must
carefully inquire whether this is true of all souls without exception.
For in that case souls born on earth when they desire better things rise
out of hell and assume human bodies or when they desire worse things
come down to us from better worlds; and in the firmament above us
likewise there are souls on their way from our world to higher ones, and
others who, while they have fallen from heaven, have not sinned so
grievously as to be thrust down to earth.” He thus tries to prove that
the firmament, that is the sky, is hell compared with heaven; and that
this earth is hell compared with the firmament; and again that our world
is heaven to hell. Or in other words what is hell to some is heaven to
others. And not content with saying this he goes on: “at the end of all
things when we shall return to the heavenly Jerusalem the hostile powers
shall declare war <span id="fr_3389"></span>[3390](#fn_3389.md) against the
people of God to breathe and exercise their valour and strengthen their
resolve. For this they cannot have until they have faced and foiled
their foes; of whom we read in the book of Numbers <span
id="fr_3390"></span>[3391](#fn_3390.md) that they are overcome by reason,
discipline, and tactical skill.”

<span id="v.CXXIV-p53"></span>13. After saying that according to the
apocalypse of John “the everlasting gospel” which shall be revealed in
heaven <span id="fr_3391"></span>[3392](#fn_3391.md) as much surpasses our
gospel as Christ’s preaching does the sacraments <span
id="fr_3392"></span>[3393](#fn_3392.md) of the ancient law, he has asserted
what it is sacrilegious even to think; that Christ will once more suffer
in the sky for the salvation of demons. And although he has not
expressly said it, it is yet implied in his words that as for men God
became man to set men free, so for the salvation of demons when He comes
to deliver them He will become a demon. To shew that this is no gloss of
mine, I must give his own words: “As Christ,” he writes, “has fulfilled
the shadow of the law by the shadow of the gospel, and as all law is a
pattern and shadow of things done in heaven, we must inquire whether we
are justified in supposing that even the heavenly law and the rites of
the celestial worship are still incomplete and need the true gospel
which in the apocalypse of John is called everlasting to distinguish it
from ours which is only temporal, set forth in a world that shall pass
away. Now if we extend our inquiry to the passion of our Lord and
Saviour, it may indeed be overbold to suppose that He will suffer in
heaven; yet if there is spiritual wickedness in heavenly places <span
id="fr_3393"></span>[3394](#fn_3393.md) and if we confess without a blush
that the Lord has once been crucified to destroy those things which He
has destroyed by His passion; why need we fear to imagine a like
occurrence in the upper world in the fulness of time, so that the
nations of all realms shall be saved by a passion of Christ?”

<span id="v.CXXIV-p57"></span>14. Here is another blasphemy which he has
spoken of the Son. “Assuming that the Son knows the Father, it would
seem that by this knowledge He can comprehend Him as much as a craftsman
can comprehend the rules of his art. And, doubtless, if the Father is in
the Son, He is also comprehended by Him in whom He is. But if we mean by
comprehension not merely that the knower takes a thing in by perception
and insight but that he contains it within himself by virtue of a
special faculty; in this sense we cannot say that the Son comprehends
the Father. For the Father comprehends all things, and of these the Son
is one; therefore, He comprehends the Son.” And to shew us reasons why,
while the Father <span id="page_244">p. 244</span> <span
id="v.CXXIV-Page_244"></span>comprehends the Son, the Son cannot
comprehend the Father, he adds: “the curious reader may inquire whether
the Father knows Himself in the same way that the Son knows Him. But if
he recalls the words: ‘the Father who sent me is greater than I,’ <span
id="fr_3394"></span>[3395](#fn_3394.md) he will allow that they must be
universally true and will admit that, in knowledge as in everything
else, the Father is greater than the Son, and knows Himself more
perfectly and immediately than the Son can do.”

<span id="v.CXXIV-p59"></span>15. The following passage is a convincing
proof that he holds the transmigration of souls and annihilation of
bodies. “If it can be shewn that an incorporeal and reasonable being has
life in itself independently of the body and that it is worse off in the
body than out of it; then beyond a doubt bodies are only of secondary
importance and arise from time to time to meet the varying conditions of
reasonable creatures. Those who require bodies are clothed with them,
and contrariwise, when fallen souls have lifted themselves up to better
things, their bodies are once more annihilated. They are thus ever
vanishing and ever reappearing.” And to prevent us from minimizing the
impiety of his previous utterances he ends his work by maintaining that
all reasonable beings, that is, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,
angels, powers, dominations, and virtues, and even man by right of his
soul’s dignity, are of one and the same essence. “God,” he writes, “and
His only-begotten Son and the Holy Spirit are conscious of an
intellectual and reasonable nature. But so also are the angels, the
powers, and the virtues, as well as the inward man who is created in the
image and after the likeness of God. <span
id="fr_3395"></span>[3396](#fn_3395.md) From which I conclude that God and
they are in some sort of one essence.” He adds “in some sort” to escape
the charge of blasphemy; and while in another place he will not allow
the Son and the Holy Spirit to be of one substance with the Father lest
by so doing he should appear to make the divine essence divisible, he
here bestows the nature of God almighty upon angels and men.

<span id="v.CXXIV-p61"></span>16. This being the nature of Origen’s
book, is it anything short of madness to change a few blasphemous
passages regarding the Son and the Holy Spirit and then to publish the
rest unchanged with an unprincipled eulogy when the parts unaltered as
well as the parts altered flow from the same fountain head of gross
impiety? This is not the time to confute all the statements made in
detail; and indeed those who have written against Arius, Eunomius,
Manichæus, and various other heretics must be supposed to have answered
these blasphemies as well. If anyone, therefore, wishes to read the work
let him walk with his feet shod towards the land of promise; let him
guard against the jaws of the serpent and the crooked jaws of the
scorpion; let him read this treatise first and before he enters upon the
path let him know the dangers which he will have to avoid.
