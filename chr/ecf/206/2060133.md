id="v.CXXII-Page_225"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="v.CXXII-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXII. To Rusticus.</span>

<span id="v.CXXII-p2"></span>Rusticus and Artemia his wife having made a
vow of continence broke it. Artemia proceeded to Palestine to do penance
for her sin and Rusticus promised to follow her. However he failed to do
so, and Jerome was asked to write this letter in the hope that it might
induce him to fulfil his promise. The date is about 408 <span
class="c17"><span id="v.CXXII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.CXXII-p3"></span>1. I am induced to write to you, a stranger
to a stranger, by the entreaties of that holy servant of Christ
Hedibia <span id="fr_3113"></span>[3114](#fn_3113.md) and of my daughter in
the faith Artemia, once your wife but now no longer your wife but your
sister and fellow-servant. Not content with assuring her own salvation
she has sought yours also, in former days at home and now in the holy
places. She is anxious to emulate the thoughtfulness of the apostles
Andrew and Philip; who after Christ had found them, desired in their
turn to find, the one his brother Simon and the other his friend
Nathanael. <span id="fr_3114"></span>[3115](#fn_3114.md) To the former of
these it was said “Thou art Simon, the son of Jona: thou shalt be called
Cephas which is by interpretation a stone;” <span
id="fr_3115"></span>[3116](#fn_3115.md) while the latter, whose name
Nathanael means the gift of God, was comforted by Christ’s witness to
him: “behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile.” <span
id="fr_3116"></span>[3117](#fn_3116.md) So of old Lot <span
id="fr_3117"></span>[3118](#fn_3117.md) desired to rescue his wife as well
as his two daughters, and refusing to leave blazing Sodom and Gomorrah
until he was himself half-on-fire, tried to lead forth one who was tied
and bound by her past sins. But in her despair she lost her composure,
and looking back became a monument of an unbelieving soul. <span
id="fr_3118"></span>[3119](#fn_3118.md) Yet, as if to make up for the loss
of a single woman, Lot’s glowing faith set free the whole city of Zoar.
In fact when he left the dark valleys in which Sodom lay and came to the
mountains, the sun rose upon him as he entered Zoar or the little City;
so-called because the little faith that Lot possessed, though unable to
save greater places, was at least able to preserve smaller ones. For one
who had gone so far astray as to live in Gomorrah could not all at once
reach the noonland where Abraham, the friend of God, <span
id="fr_3119"></span>[3120](#fn_3119.md) entertained God and His
angels. <span id="fr_3120"></span>[3121](#fn_3120.md) (For it was in Egypt
that Joseph fed his brothers, and when the bride speaks to the
Bridegroom her cry is: “tell me where thou feedest, where thou makest
thy flock to rest at noon.” <span id="fr_3121"></span>[3122](#fn_3121) .md)
Good men have always sorrowed for the sins of others. Samuel of old
lamented for Saul <span id="fr_3122"></span>[3123](#fn_3122.md) because he
neglected to treat the ulcers of pride with the balm of penitence. And
Paul wept for the Corinthians <span id="fr_3123"></span>[3124](#fn_3123.md)
who refused to wash out with their tears the stains of fornication. For
the same reason Ezekiel swallowed the book where were written within and
without song, and lamentation and woe; <span
id="fr_3124"></span>[3125](#fn_3124.md) the song in praise of the
righteous, the lamentation over the penitent, and the woe for those of
whom it is written, “When the wicked man falleth into the depths of
evil, then is he filled with scorn.” <span
id="fr_3125"></span>[3126](#fn_3125.md) It is to these that Isaiah alludes
when he says: “in that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping and
to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth: and behold
joy and gladness, slaying oxen; and killing sheep, eating flesh” and
saying, “let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.” <span
id="fr_3126"></span>[3127](#fn_3126.md) Yet of such persons Ezekiel is
bidden to speak thus: “O thou son of man, speak unto the house of
Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be
upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live? Say unto
them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of
the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live,” and again,
“turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of
Israel?” <span id="fr_3127"></span>[3128](#fn_3127.md) Nothing makes God so
angry as when men from despair of better things cleave to those which
are worse; and indeed this despair in itself is a sign of unbelief. One
who despairs of salvation can have no expectation of a judgment to come.
For if he dreaded such, he would by doing good works prepare to meet his
Judge. Let us hear what God says through Jeremiah, “withhold thy foot
from a rough way and thy throat from thirst” <span
id="fr_3128"></span>[3129](#fn_3128.md) and again “shall they fall, and not
arise? Shall he turn away, and not return?” <span
id="fr_3129"></span>[3130](#fn_3129.md) Let us hear also what God says by
Isaiah: “When thou shalt turn and bewail thyself, then shalt thou be
saved, and then shalt thou know where thou hast hitherto been.” <span
id="fr_3130"></span>[3131](#fn_3130.md) We do not realize the miseries of
sickness till returning health reveals them to us. So sins serve as a
foil to the blessedness of virtue; and light shines more brightly when
it is relieved against darkness. Ezekiel uses language like that of the
other prophets because he is animated by a similar spirit. “Repent,” he
cries, “and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity
shall not be your ruin. Cast away from you all your transgressions
whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit:
for why will ye die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the
death of him that dieth, saith the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3131"></span>[3132](#fn_3131.md) Wherefore in a subsequent passage
<span id="page_226">p. 226</span> <span id="v.CXXII-Page_226"></span>he
says: “As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of
the wicked: but that the wicked turn from his way and live.” <span
id="fr_3132"></span>[3133](#fn_3132.md) These words shew us that the mind
must not through disbelief in the promised blessings give way to
despair; and that the soul once marked out for perdition must not refuse
to apply remedies on the ground that its wounds are past curing. Ezekiel
describes God as swearing, that if we refuse to believe His promise in
regard to our salvation we may at least believe His oath. It is with
full confidence that the righteous man prays and says, “Turn us, O God
of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease,” <span
id="fr_3133"></span>[3134](#fn_3133.md) and again, “Lord, by thy favour
thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face and
I was troubled.” <span id="fr_3134"></span>[3135](#fn_3134.md) He means to
say, “when I forsook the foulness of my faults for the beauty of virtue,
God strengthened my weakness with His grace.” Lo, I hear His promise: “I
will pursue mine enemies and overtake them: neither will I turn again
till they are consumed,” <span id="fr_3135"></span>[3136](#fn_3135.md) so
that I who was once thine enemy and a fugitive from thee, shall be laid
hold of by thine hand. Cease not from pursuing me till my wickedness is
consumed, and I return to my old husband who will give me my wool and my
flax, my oil and my fine flour and will feed me with the richest
foods. <span id="fr_3136"></span>[3137](#fn_3136.md) He it was who hedged
up and enclosed my evil ways <span id="fr_3137"></span>[3138](#fn_3137.md)
that I might find Him the true way who says in the gospel, “I am the
way, the truth, and the life.” <span
id="fr_3138"></span>[3139](#fn_3138.md) Hear the words of the prophet:
“they that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and
weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with
rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.” <span
id="fr_3139"></span>[3140](#fn_3139.md) Say also with him: “All the night
make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears” <span
id="fr_3140"></span>[3141](#fn_3140.md) : and again, “As the hart panteth
after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul
thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear
before God? My tears have been my meat day and night,” <span
id="fr_3141"></span>[3142](#fn_3141.md) and in another place, “O God, thou
art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh
longeth for thee in a dry and weary land where no water is. So have I
looked upon thee in the sanctuary.” <span
id="fr_3142"></span>[3143](#fn_3142.md) For although my soul has thirsted
after thee, yet much more have I sought thee by the labour of my flesh
and have not been able to look upon thee in thy sanctuary; not at any
rate till I have first dwelt in a land barren of sin, where the weary
wayfarer is no more assailed by the adversary, and where there are no
pools or rivers of lust.

<span id="v.CXXII-p34"></span>The Saviour also wept over the city of
Jerusalem because its inhabitants had not repented; <span
id="fr_3143"></span>[3144](#fn_3143.md) and Peter washed out his triple
denial with bitter tears, <span id="fr_3144"></span>[3145](#fn_3144.md)
thus fulfilling the words of the prophet: “rivers of waters run down
mine eyes.” <span id="fr_3145"></span>[3146](#fn_3145.md) Jeremiah too
laments over his impenitent people, saying: “Oh that my head were waters
and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night
for…my people!” <span id="fr_3146"></span>[3147](#fn_3146.md) And farther
on he gives a reason for his lamentation: “weep ye not for the dead,” he
writes, “neither bemoan him: but weep sore for him that goeth away: for
he shall return no more.” <span id="fr_3147"></span>[3148](#fn_3147.md) The
Jew and the Gentile therefore are not to be bemoaned, for they have
never been in the Church and have died once for all (it is of these that
the Saviour says: “let the dead bury their dead” <span
id="fr_3148"></span>[3149](#fn_3148) .md); weep rather for those who by
reason of their crimes and sins go away from the Church, and who
suffering condemnation for their faults shall no more return to it. It
is in this sense that the prophet speaks to ministers of the Church,
calling them its walls and towers, and saying to each in turn, “O wall,
let tears run down.” <span id="fr_3149"></span>[3150](#fn_3149.md) In this
way, it is prophetically implied, you will fulfil the apostolic precept:
“rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep,” <span
id="fr_3150"></span>[3151](#fn_3150.md) and by your tears you will melt the
hard hearts of sinners till they too weep; whereas, if they persist in
evil doing they will find these words applied to them, “I…planted thee a
noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the
degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?” <span
id="fr_3151"></span>[3152](#fn_3151.md) and again “saying to a stock, Thou
art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have
turned their back unto me, and not their face.” <span
id="fr_3152"></span>[3153](#fn_3152.md) He means, they would not turn
towards God in penitence; but in the hardness of their hearts turned
their backs upon Him to insult Him. Wherefore also the Lord says to
Jeremiah: “hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? She
is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and
there hath played the harlot. And I said after she” had played the
harlot and “had done all these things, Turn thou unto me. But she
returned not.” <span id="fr_3153"></span>[3154](#fn_3153.md)

<span id="v.CXXII-p46"></span>2. How hard hearted we are and how
merciful God is! who even after our many sins urges us to seek
salvation. Yet not even so are we willing to turn to better things. Hear
the words of the Lord: “If a man put away his wife, and she go from him,
and become another man’s and shall afterwards desire to <span
id="page_227">p. 227</span> <span id="v.CXXII-Page_227"></span>return to
him, will he at all receive her? Will he not loathe her rather? But thou
hast played the harlot with many lovers: yet return again to me, saith
the Lord.” In place of the last clause the true Hebrew text (which is
not preserved in the Greek and Latin versions) gives the following:
“thou hast forsaken me, yet return, and I will receive thee, saith the
Lord.” <span id="fr_3154"></span>[3155](#fn_3154.md) Isaiah also speaking
in the same sense uses almost the same words: “Return,” he cries, “O
children of Israel, ye who think deep counsel and wicked. <span
id="fr_3155"></span>[3156](#fn_3155.md) Return thou unto me and I will
redeem thee. I am God, and there is no God else beside me; a just God
and a Saviour; there is none beside me. Look unto me, and be ye saved,
all the ends of the earth. <span id="fr_3156"></span>[3157](#fn_3156.md)
Remember this and shew yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O ye
transgressors. Return in heart and remember the former things of old:
for I am God and there is none else.” <span
id="fr_3157"></span>[3158](#fn_3157.md) Joel also writes: “turn ye even to
me with all your heart, and with fasting and with weeping and with
mourning: and rend your heart and not your garments and turn unto the
Lord your God; for he is gracious and merciful…and repenteth him of the
evil.” <span id="fr_3158"></span>[3159](#fn_3158.md) How great His mercy is
and how excessive—if I may so say—and unspeakable is His pitifulness,
the prophet Hosea tells us when he speaks in the Lord’s name: “how shall
I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I
make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim? Mine heart is turned
within me, my repentings are kindled together. I will not execute the
fierceness of mine anger.” <span id="fr_3159"></span>[3160](#fn_3159.md)
David also says in a psalm: “in death there is no remembrance of thee;
in the grave who shall give thee thanks?” <span
id="fr_3160"></span>[3161](#fn_3160.md) and in another place: “I
acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said,
I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the
iniquity of my sin. For this shall every one that is godly pray unto
thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great
waters they shall not come nigh unto him.” <span
id="fr_3161"></span>[3162](#fn_3161.md)

<span id="v.CXXII-p55"></span>3. Think how great that weeping must be
which deserves to be compared to a flood of waters. Whosoever so weeps
and says with the prophet Jeremiah “let not the apple of mine eye
cease” <span id="fr_3162"></span>[3163](#fn_3162.md) shall straightway find
the words fulfilled of him: “mercy and truth are met together:
righteousness and peace have kissed each other;” <span
id="fr_3163"></span>[3164](#fn_3163.md) so that, if righteousness and truth
terrify him, mercy and peace may encourage him to seek salvation.

<span id="v.CXXII-p58"></span>The whole repentance of a sinner is
exhibited to us in the fifty-first <span
id="fr_3164"></span>[3165](#fn_3164.md) psalm written by David after he had
gone in unto Bathsheba the wife of Uriah the Hittite, <span
id="fr_3165"></span>[3166](#fn_3165.md) and when, to the rebuke of the
prophet Nathan he had replied, “I have sinned.” Immediately that he
confessed his fault he was comforted by the words: “the Lord also hath
put away thy sin.” <span id="fr_3166"></span>[3167](#fn_3166.md) He had
added murder to adultery; yet bursting into tears he says: “Have mercy
upon me, O God, according to thy loving kindness: according unto the
multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.” <span
id="fr_3167"></span>[3168](#fn_3167.md) A sin so great needed to find great
mercy. Accordingly he goes on to say: “Wash me thoroughly from mine
iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my
transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only
have I sinned”—as a king he had no one to fear but God—“and done this
evil in thy sight; that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest
and be clear when thou judgest.” <span
id="fr_3168"></span>[3169](#fn_3168.md) For “God hath concluded all in
unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.” <span
id="fr_3169"></span>[3170](#fn_3169.md) And such was the progress that
David made that he who had once been a sinner and a penitent afterwards
became a master able to say: “I will teach transgressors thy ways; and
sinners shall be converted unto thee.” <span
id="fr_3170"></span>[3171](#fn_3170.md) For as “confession and beauty are
before God,” <span id="fr_3171"></span>[3172](#fn_3171.md) so a sinner who
confesses his sins and says: “my wounds stink and are corrupt because of
my foolishness” <span id="fr_3172"></span>[3173](#fn_3172.md) loses his
foul wounds and is made whole and clean. But “he that covereth his sins
shall not prosper.” <span id="fr_3173"></span>[3174](#fn_3173.md)

<span id="v.CXXII-p69"></span>The ungodly king Ahab, who shed the blood
of Naboth to gain his vineyard, was with Jezebel, the partner less of
his bed than of his cruelty, severely rebuked by Elijah. “Thus saith the
Lord, hast thou killed and also taken possession?” and again, “in the
place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, shall dogs lick thy blood,
even thine;” and “the dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of
Jezreel.” <span id="fr_3174"></span>[3175](#fn_3174.md) “And it came to
pass”—the passage goes on—“when Ahab heard those words that he rent his
clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in
sackcloth…and the word of the Lord came to Elijah saying, Because Ahab
humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his
days.” <span id="fr_3175"></span>[3176](#fn_3175.md) Ahab’s sin and
Jezebel’s were the same; yet because Ahab repented, his punishment was
postponed so as to fall upon his sons, while Jezebel persisting in her
wickedness met her doom then and there.

<span id="v.CXXII-p72"></span><span id="page_228">p. 228</span> <span
id="v.CXXII-Page_228"></span>Moreover the Lord tells us in the gospel,
“the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and
shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of
Jonas;” <span id="fr_3176"></span>[3177](#fn_3176.md) and again He says “I
am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.” <span
id="fr_3177"></span>[3178](#fn_3177.md) The lost piece of silver is sought
for until it is found in the mire. <span
id="fr_3178"></span>[3179](#fn_3178.md) So also the ninety and nine sheep
are left in the wilderness, while the shepherd carries home on his
shoulders the one sheep which has gone astray. <span
id="fr_3179"></span>[3180](#fn_3179.md) Wherefore also “there is joy in the
presence of the angels over one sinner that repenteth.” <span
id="fr_3180"></span>[3181](#fn_3180.md) What a blessed thought it is that
heavenly beings rejoice in our salvation! For it is of us that the words
are said: “Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” <span
id="fr_3181"></span>[3182](#fn_3181.md) Death and life are contrary the one
to the other; there is no middle term. Yet penitence can knit death to
life. The prodigal son, we are told, wasted all his substance, and in
the far country away from his father “would fain have filled his belly
with the husks that the swine did eat.” Yet, when he comes back to his
father, the fatted calf is killed, a robe and a ring are given to
him. <span id="fr_3182"></span>[3183](#fn_3182.md) That is to say, he
receives again Christ’s robe which he had before defiled, and hears to
his comfort the injunction: “let thy garments be always white.” <span
id="fr_3183"></span>[3184](#fn_3183.md) He receives the signet of God and
cries to the Lord: “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before
thee;” and receiving the kiss of reconciliation, he says to Him: “Now is
the light of thy countenance sealed upon us, O Lord.” <span
id="fr_3184"></span>[3185](#fn_3184.md)

<span id="v.CXXII-p82"></span>Hear the words of Ezekiel: “as for the
wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he
turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live
for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth.” <span
id="fr_3185"></span>[3186](#fn_3185.md) The Lord judges every man according
as he finds him. It is not the past that He looks upon but the present.
Bygone sins there may be, but renewal and conversion remove them. “A
just man,” we read “falleth seven times and riseth up again.” <span
id="fr_3186"></span>[3187](#fn_3186.md) If he falls, how is he just? and if
he is just, how does he fall? The answer is that a sinner does not lose
the name of just if he always repents of his sins and rises again. If a
sinner repents, his sins are forgiven him not only till seven times but
till seventy times seven. <span id="fr_3187"></span>[3188](#fn_3187.md) To
whom much is forgiven, the same loveth much. <span
id="fr_3188"></span>[3189](#fn_3188.md) The harlot washed with her tears
the Saviour’s feet and wiped them with her hair; and to her, as a type
of the Church gathered from the nations, was the declaration made: “Thy
sins are forgiven.” <span id="fr_3189"></span>[3190](#fn_3189.md) The
self-righteous Pharisee perished in his pride, while the humble publican
was saved by his confession. <span id="fr_3190"></span>[3191](#fn_3190.md)

<span id="v.CXXII-p89"></span>God makes asseveration by the mouth of the
prophet Jeremiah: “At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation and
concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, to pull down and to destroy it: if
that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I
will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. And at what
instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom to
build and to plant it; if it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my
voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would benefit
them.” And immediately he adds: “Behold, I frame evil against you, and
devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way,
and make your ways and your doings good. And they said, there is no
hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do
the imagination of his evil heart.” <span
id="fr_3191"></span>[3192](#fn_3191.md) The righteous Simeon says in the
gospel: “Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of
many,” <span id="fr_3192"></span>[3193](#fn_3192.md) for the fall, that is,
of sinners and for the rising again of the penitent. So the apostle
writes to the Corinthians: “it is reported commonly that there is
fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named
among the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife. And ye are
puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed
might be taken away from among you.” <span
id="fr_3193"></span>[3194](#fn_3193.md) And in his second epistle to the
same, “lest such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch
sorrow,” <span id="fr_3194"></span>[3195](#fn_3194.md) he calls him back,
and begs them to confirm their love towards him, so that he who had been
destroyed by incest might be saved by penitence.

<span id="v.CXXII-p94"></span>“There is no man clean from sin; even
though he has lived but for one day.” <span
id="fr_3195"></span>[3196](#fn_3195.md) And the years of man’s life are
many in number. “The stars are not pure in his sight, <span
id="fr_3196"></span>[3197](#fn_3196.md) and his angels he charged with
folly.” <span id="fr_3197"></span>[3198](#fn_3197.md) If there is sin in
heaven, how much more must there be sin on earth? If they are stained
with guilt who have no bodily temptations, how much more must we be,
enveloped as we are in frail flesh and forced to cry each one of us with
the apostle: “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the
body of this death? <span id="fr_3198"></span>[3199](#fn_3198.md) For in my
flesh there dwelleth no good thing.” <span
id="fr_3199"></span>[3200](#fn_3199.md) For we do not what we would but
what we would not; the soul desires to do one <span id="page_229">p.
229</span> <span id="v.CXXII-Page_229"></span>thing, the flesh is
compelled to do another. If any persons are called righteous in
scripture, and not only righteous but righteous in the sight of God,
they are called righteous according to that righteousness mentioned in
the passage I have quoted: “A just man falleth seven times and riseth up
again,” <span id="fr_3200"></span>[3201](#fn_3200.md) and on the principle
laid down that the wickedness of the wicked shall not hurt him in the
day that he turns to repentance. <span
id="fr_3201"></span>[3202](#fn_3201.md) In fact Zachariah the father of
John who is described as a righteous man sinned in disbelieving the
message sent to him and was at once punished with dumbness. <span
id="fr_3202"></span>[3203](#fn_3202.md) Even Job, who at the outset of his
history is spoken of as perfect and upright and uncomplaining, is
afterwards proved to be a sinner both by God’s words and by his own
confession. If Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the prophets also and the
apostles were by no means free from sin and if the finest wheat had
chaff mixed with it, what can be said of us of whom it is written: “What
is the chaff to the wheat, saith the Lord?” <span
id="fr_3203"></span>[3204](#fn_3203.md) Yet the chaff is reserved for
future burning; as also are the tares which at present are mingled with
the growing corn. For one shall come whose fan is in His hand, and shall
purge His floor, and shall gather His wheat into the garner, and shall
burn the chaff in the fire of hell. <span
id="fr_3204"></span>[3205](#fn_3204.md)

<span id="v.CXXII-p105"></span>4. Roaming thus through the fairest
fields of scripture I have culled its loveliest flowers to weave for
your brows a garland of penitence; for my aim is that, flying on the
wings of a dove, you may find rest <span
id="fr_3205"></span>[3206](#fn_3205.md) and make your peace with the Father
of mercy. Your former wife, who is now your sister and fellow-servant,
has told me that, acting on the apostolic precept, <span
id="fr_3206"></span>[3207](#fn_3206.md) you and she lived apart by consent
that you might give yourselves to prayer; but that after a time your
feet sank beneath you as if resting on water and indeed—to speak
plainly—gave way altogether. For her part she heard the Lord saying to
her as to Moses: “as for thee stand thou here by me;” <span
id="fr_3207"></span>[3208](#fn_3207.md) and with the psalmist she said of
Him: “He hath set my feet upon a rock.” <span
id="fr_3208"></span>[3209](#fn_3208.md) But your house—she went on—having
no sure foundation of faith fell before a whirlwind of the devil. <span
id="fr_3209"></span>[3210](#fn_3209.md) Hers however still stands in the
Lord, and does not refuse its shelter to you; you can still be joined in
spirit to her to whom you were once joined in body. For, as the apostle
says, “he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit” with him. <span
id="fr_3210"></span>[3211](#fn_3210.md) Moreover, when the fury of the
barbarians and the risk of captivity separated you again, you promised
with a solemn oath that, if she made her way to the holy places, you
would follow her either immediately or later, and that you would try to
save your soul now that by your carelessness you had seemed to lose it.
Perform, now, the vow which you then made in the presence of God. Human
life is uncertain. Therefore, lest you may be snatched away before you
have fulfilled your promise, imitate her whose teacher you ought to have
been. For shame! the weaker vessel overcomes the world, and yet the
stronger is overcome by it!

<span id="v.CXXII-p112"></span>A woman leadeth in the high
emprise; <span id="fr_3211"></span>[3212](#fn_3211.md)

<span id="v.CXXII-p114"></span>and yet you will not follow her when her
salvation leads you to the threshold of the faith! Perhaps, however, you
desire to save the remnants of your property and to see the last of your
friends and fellow-citizens and of their cities and villas. If so, amid
the horrors of captivity, in the presence of exulting foes, and in the
shipwreck of the province, at least hold fast to the plank of
penitence; <span id="fr_3212"></span>[3213](#fn_3212.md) and remember your
fellow-servant <span id="fr_3213"></span>[3214](#fn_3213.md) who daily
sighs for your salvation and never despairs of it. While you are
wandering about your own country (though, indeed, you no longer have a
country; that which you once had, you have lost) she is interceding for
you in the venerable spots which witnessed the nativity, crucifixion and
resurrection of our Lord and Saviour, and in the first of which He
uttered His infant-cry. She draws you to her by her prayers that you may
be saved, if not by your own exertions, at any rate by her faith. Of old
one lay upon his bed sick of the palsy, so powerless in all his joints
that he could neither move his feet to walk nor his hands to pray; yet
when he was carried to our Lord by others, he was by Him so completely
restored to health as to carry the bed which a little before had carried
him. <span id="fr_3214"></span>[3215](#fn_3214.md) You too—absent in the
body but present to her faith—your fellow-servant offers to her Lord and
Saviour; and with the Canaanite woman she says of you: “my daughter is
grievously vexed with a devil.” <span
id="fr_3215"></span>[3216](#fn_3215.md) Souls are of no sex; therefore I
may fairly call your soul the daughter of hers. For as a mother coaxes
her unweaned child which is as yet unable to take solid food; so does
she call you to the milk suitable for babes and offer to you the
sustenance that a nursing mother gives. Thus shall you be able to say
with the prophet: “I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy
servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.” <span
