id="v.XXXIV-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXIV. To Marcella.</span>

<span id="v.XXXIV-p2"></span>In reply to a request from Marcella for
information concerning two phrases in [Ps.
cxxvii.](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#000.md)<span id="v.XXXIV-p2.1"></span>
(“bread of sorrow,” [Psa. 127.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#002.md)<span
id="v.XXXIV-p2.2"></span>, and “children of the shaken off,” A.V. “of
the youth,” [Psa. 127.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#004.md)<span
id="v.XXXIV-p2.3"></span>). Jerome, after lamenting that Origen’s notes
on the psalm are no longer extant, gives the following explanations:

<span id="v.XXXIV-p3"></span>The Hebrew phrase “bread of sorrow” is
rendered by the LXX. “bread of idols”; by Aquila, “bread of troubles”;
by Symmachus, “bread of misery.” Theodotion follows the LXX. So does
Origen’s Fifth Version. The Sixth renders “bread of error.” In support
of the LXX. the word used here is in [Ps. cxv.
4](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#004.md)<span id="v.XXXIV-p3.1"></span>,
translated “idols.” Either the troubles of life are meant or else the
tenets of heresy.

<span id="v.XXXIV-p4"></span>With the second phrase he deals at greater
length. After showing that Hilary of Poitiers’s view (viz. that the
persons meant are the apostles, who were told to shake the dust off
their feet, [Matt. x. 14](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#014.md)<span
id="v.XXXIV-p4.1"></span>) is untenable and would require “shakers off”
to be substituted for “shaken off,” Jerome reverts to the Hebrew as
before and declares that the true rendering is that of Symmachus and
Theodotion, viz. “children of youth.” He points out that the LXX. (by
whom the Latin translators had been misled) fall into the same mistake
at [Neh. iv. 16](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#016.md)<span
id="v.XXXIV-p4.2"></span>. Finally he corrects a slip of Hilary as to
[Ps. cxxviii. 2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002.md)<span
id="v.XXXIV-p4.3"></span>, where, through a misunderstanding of the
LXX., the latter had substituted “the labors of thy fruits” for “the
labors of thy hands.” He speaks throughout with high respect of Hilary,
and says that it was not the bishop’s fault that he was ignorant of
Hebrew. The date of the letter is probably <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XXXIV-p4.4"></span>a.d.</span> 384.
