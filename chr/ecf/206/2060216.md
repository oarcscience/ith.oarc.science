Preface is a defence of the genuineness of the Epistle against those who
thought its subject beneath the dignity of inspiration. “There are many
degrees of inspiration,” Jerome says, “though in Christ alone it is seen
in its fulness.” Many of the other Epistles touch upon small affairs of
life, like the cloak left at Troas. To suppose that common life is
separate from God is Manichæanism. Jerome mentions that Marcion, who
altered many of the Epistles, did not touch that of Philemon; and
brevity in a document which has in it so much of the beauty of the
Gospel is a mark of its inspiration.*
