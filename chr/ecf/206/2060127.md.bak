id="v.CXVI-p1.1"></span>Letter CXVI. From Augustine.</span>

<span id="v.CXVI-p2"></span>A long letter in which Augustine for the
third time (see Letters LVI., LXVII.) restates his opinion about
Jerome’s theory of the dispute between Peter and Paul at Antioch. In
doing so, however, he disclaims all desire to hurt Jerome’s feelings,
apologizes for the tone of his previous letters, and again explains that
it is not his fault that they have failed so long to reach Jerome.

<span id="v.CXVI-p3"></span>Written shortly after the preceding.
