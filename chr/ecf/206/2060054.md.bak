<span id="v.XLIII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XLIII-p1.1"></span>Letter XLIII. To Marcella.</span>

<span id="v.XLIII-p2"></span>Jerome draws a contrast between his daily
life and that of Origen, and sorrowfully admits his own shortcomings. He
then suggests to Marcella the advantages which life in the country
offers over life in town, and hints that he is himself disposed to make
trial of it. Written at Rome in 385 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XLIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.XLIII-p3"></span>1. Ambrose who supplied Origen, true man of
adamant and of brass, <span id="fr_903"></span>[904](#fn_903.md) with
money, materials and amanuenses to bring out his countless
books—Ambrose, in a letter to his friend from Athens, states that they
never took a meal together without something being read, and never went
to bed till some portion of Scripture had been brought home to them by a
brother’s voice. Night and day, in fact, were so ordered that prayer
only gave place to reading and reading to prayer.

<span id="v.XLIII-p5"></span>2. Have we, brute beasts that we are, ever
done the like? Why, we yawn if we read for over an hour; we rub our
foreheads and vainly try to suppress our languor. And then, after this
great feat, we plunge for relief into worldly business once more.

<span id="v.XLIII-p6"></span>I say nothing of the meals with which we
dull our faculties, and I would rather not estimate the time that we
spend in paying and receiving visits. Next we fall into conversation; we
waste our words, we attack people behind their backs, we detail their
way of living, we carp at them and are carped at by them in turn. Such
is the fare that engages our attention at dinner and afterwards. Then,
when our guests have retired, we make up our accounts, and these are
sure to cause us either anger or anxiety. The first makes us like raging
lions, and the second seeks vainly to make provision for years to come.
We do not recollect the words of the Gospel: “Thou fool, this night thy
soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be which
thou hast provided?” <span id="fr_904"></span>[905](#fn_904.md) The
clothing which we buy is designed not merely for use but for display.
Where there is a chance of saving money we quicken our pace, speak
promptly, and keep our ears open. If we hear of household losses—such as
often occur—our looks become dejected and gloomy. The gain of a
penny <span id="fr_905"></span>[906](#fn_905.md) fills us with joy; the
loss of a half-penny <span id="fr_906"></span>[907](#fn_906.md) plunges us
into sorrow. One man <span id="page_58">p. 58</span> <span
id="v.XLIII-Page_58"></span>is of so many minds that the prophet’s
prayer is: “Lord, in thy city scatter their image.” <span
id="fr_907"></span>[908](#fn_907.md) For created as we are in the image of
God and after His likeness, <span id="fr_908"></span>[909](#fn_908.md) it
is our own wickedness which makes us assume masks. <span
id="fr_909"></span>[910](#fn_909.md) Just as on the stage the same actor
now figures as a brawny Hercules, now softens into a tender Venus, now
shivers in the role of Cybele; so we—who, if we were not of the world,
would be hated by the world <span id="fr_910"></span>[911](#fn_910.md) —for
every sin that we commit have a corresponding mask.

<span id="v.XLIII-p14"></span>3. Wherefore, seeing that we have
journeyed for much of our life through a troubled sea, and that our
vessel has been in turn shaken by raging blasts and shattered upon
treacherous reefs, let us, as soon as may be, make for the haven of
rural quietude. There such country dainties as milk and household bread,
and greens watered by our own hands, will supply us with coarse but
harmless fare. So living, sleep will not call us away from prayer, nor
satiety from reading. In summer the shade of a tree will afford us
privacy. In autumn the quality of the air and the leaves strewn under
foot will invite us to stop and rest. In springtime the fields will be
bright with flowers, and our psalms will sound the sweeter for the
twittering of the birds. When winter comes with its frost and snow, I
shall not have to buy fuel, and, whether I sleep or keep vigil, shall be
warmer than in town. At least, so far as I know, I shall keep off the
cold at less expense. Let Rome keep to itself its noise and bustle, let
the cruel shows of the arena go on, let the crowd rave at the circus,
let the playgoers revel in the theatres and—for I must not altogether
pass over our Christian friends—let the House of Ladies <span
id="fr_911"></span>[912](#fn_911.md) hold its daily sittings. It is good
for us to cleave to the Lord, <span id="fr_912"></span>[913](#fn_912.md)
and to put our hope in the Lord God, so that when we have exchanged our
present poverty for the kingdom of heaven, we may be able to exclaim:
“Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I
desire beside thee.” <span id="fr_913"></span>[914](#fn_913.md) Surely if
we can find such blessedness in heaven we may well grieve to have sought
after pleasures poor and passing here upon earth. Farewell.
