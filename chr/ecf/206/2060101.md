<span id="v.XC-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XC-p1.1"></span>Letter XC. From Theophilus to Epiphanius.</span>

<span id="v.XC-p2"></span>Theophilus writes to Epiphanius to convoke a
council in Cyprus for the condemnation of Origenism and asks him to
transmit to Constantinople by a trustworthy messenger a copy of its
decrees together with the synodical letter of Theophilus himself. His
anxiety about this last point is caused by the news that certain of the
excommunicated monks have set sail for Constantinople to lay their case
before the bishop, John Chrysostom. The date of the letter is 400 <span
class="c17"><span id="v.XC-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.XC-p3"></span>Theophilus to his well-beloved lord, brother,
and fellow-bishop Epiphanius.

<span id="v.XC-p4"></span>The Lord has said to his prophet “See, I have
this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms to root out and
to pull down and to destroy and…to build and to plant.” <span
id="fr_2626"></span>[2627](#fn_2626) In every age he bestows the same
grace upon his church, that His Body <span
id="fr_2627"></span>[2628](#fn_2627) may be preserved intact and that
the poison of heretical opinions may nowhere prevail over it. And now
also do we see the words fulfilled. For the church of Christ “not having
spot or wrinkle or any such thing” <span
id="fr_2628"></span>[2629](#fn_2628) has with the sword of the gospel
cut down the Origenist serpents crawling out of their caves, and has
delivered from their deadly contagion the fruitful host of the monks of
Nitria. I have compressed a short account of my proceedings (it was all
that time would allow) into the general letter <span
id="fr_2629"></span>[2630](#fn_2629) which I have addressed
indiscriminately to all. As your excellency has often fought in contests
of the kind before me, it is your present duty to strengthen the hands
of those who are in the field and to gather together to this end the
bishops of your entire island. <span
id="fr_2630"></span>[2631](#fn_2630) A synodical letter should be sent
to myself and the bishop of Constantinople <span
id="fr_2631"></span>[2632](#fn_2631) and to any others whom you think
fit; that by universal consent Origen himself may be expressly condemned
and also the infamous heresy of which he was the author. I have learned
that certain calumniators of the true faith, named Ammonius, Eusebius,
and Euthymius, filled with a fresh access of enthusiasm in behalf of the
heresy, have taken ship for Constantinople, to ensnare with their
deceits as many new converts as they can and to confer anew with the old
companions of their impiety. Let it be your care, therefore, to set
forth the course of the matter to all the bishops throughout Isauria and
Pamphylia and the rest of the neighbouring provinces: moreover, if you
think fit, you can add my letter, so that all of us gathered together in
one spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ may deliver these men
unto Satan for the destruction of the impiety which possesses
them. <span id="fr_2632"></span>[2633](#fn_2632) And to ensure the
speedy arrival of my despatches at Constantinople, send a diligent
messenger, one of the clergy (as I send fathers from the monasteries of
Nitria with others also of the monks, learned men and continent) that
when they arrive they may be able themselves to relate what has been
done. Above all I beg of you to offer up earnest prayers to the Lord
that we may be able in this contest also to gain the victory; for no
small joy has filled the hearts of the people both in Alexandria and
throughout all Egypt, because a few men have been expelled from the
Church that the body of it might be kept pure. Salute the brothers who
are with you. The people <span id="fr_2633"></span>[2634](#fn_2633) with
us salute you in the Lord.
