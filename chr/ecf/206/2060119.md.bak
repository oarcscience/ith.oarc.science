<span id="v.CVIII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.CVIII-p1.1"></span>Letter CVIII. To Eustochium.</span>

<span id="v.CVIII-p2"></span>This, one of the longest of Jerome’s
letters, was written to console Eustochium for the loss of her mother
who had recently died. Jerome relates the story of Paula in detail;
speaking first of her high birth, marriage, and social success at Rome,
and then narrating her conversion and subsequent life as a Christian
ascetic. Much space is devoted to an account of her journey to the East
which included a visit to Egypt and to the monasteries of Nitria as well
as a tour of the most sacred spots in the Holy Land. The remainder of
the letter describes her daily routine and studies at Bethlehem, and
recounts the many virtues for which she was distinguished. It then
concludes with a touching description of her death and burial and gives
the epitaph placed upon her grave. The date of the letter is 404 <span
class="c17"><span id="v.CVIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.CVIII-p3"></span>1. If all the members of my body were to be
converted into tongues, and if each of my limbs were to be gifted with a
human voice, I could still do no justice to the virtues of the holy and
venerable Paula. Noble in family, she was nobler still in holiness; rich
formerly in this world’s goods, she is now more distinguished by the
poverty that she has embraced for Christ. Of the stock of the Gracchi
and descended from the Scipios, the heir and representative of that
Paulus whose name she bore, the true and legitimate daughter of that
Martia Papyria who was mother to Africanus, she yet preferred Bethlehem
to Rome, and left her palace glittering with gold to dwell in a mud
cabin. We do not grieve that we have lost this perfect woman; rather we
thank God that we have had her, nay that we have her still. For “all
live unto” God, <span id="fr_2730"></span>[2731](#fn_2730.md) and they who
return unto the Lord are still to be reckoned members of his family. We
have lost her, it is true, but the heavenly mansions have gained her;
for as long as she was in the body she was absent from the Lord <span
id="fr_2731"></span>[2732](#fn_2731.md) and would constantly complain with
tears:—“Woe is me that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of
Kedar; my soul hath been this long time a pilgrim.” <span
id="fr_2732"></span>[2733](#fn_2732.md) It was no wonder that she <span
id="page_196">p. 196</span> <span id="v.CVIII-Page_196"></span>sobbed
out that even she was in darkness (for this is the meaning of the word
Kedar) seeing that, according to the apostle, “the world lieth in the
evil one;” <span id="fr_2733"></span>[2734](#fn_2733.md) and that, “as its
darkness is, so is its light;” <span
id="fr_2734"></span>[2735](#fn_2734.md) and that “the light shineth in
darkness and the darkness comprehended it not.” <span
id="fr_2735"></span>[2736](#fn_2735.md) She would frequently exclaim: “I am
a stranger with thee and a sojourner as all my fathers were,” <span
id="fr_2736"></span>[2737](#fn_2736.md) and again, I desire “to depart and
to be with Christ.” <span id="fr_2737"></span>[2738](#fn_2737.md) As often
too as she was troubled with bodily weakness (brought on by incredible
abstinence and by redoubled fastings), she would be heard to say: “I
keep under my body and bring it into subjection; lest that by any means,
when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway;” <span
id="fr_2738"></span>[2739](#fn_2738.md) and “It is good neither to eat
flesh nor to drink wine;” <span id="fr_2739"></span>[2740](#fn_2739.md) and
“I humbled my soul with fasting;” <span
id="fr_2740"></span>[2741](#fn_2740.md) and “thou wilt make all” my “bed
in” my “sickness;” <span id="fr_2741"></span>[2742](#fn_2741.md) and “Thy
hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of
summer.” <span id="fr_2742"></span>[2743](#fn_2742.md) And when the pain
which she bore with such wonderful patience darted through her, as if
she saw the heavens opened <span id="fr_2743"></span>[2744](#fn_2743.md)
she would say “Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly
away and be at rest.” <span id="fr_2744"></span>[2745](#fn_2744.md)

<span id="v.CVIII-p19"></span>2. I call Jesus and his saints, yes and
the particular angel who was the guardian and the companion of this
admirable woman to bear witness that these are no words of adulation and
flattery but sworn testimony every one of them borne to her character.
They are, indeed, inadequate to the virtues of one whose praises are
sung by the whole world, who is admired by bishops, <span
id="fr_2745"></span>[2746](#fn_2745.md) regretted by bands of virgins, and
wept for by crowds of monks and poor. Would you know all her virtues,
reader, in short? She has left those dependent on her poor, but not so
poor as she was herself. In dealing thus with her relatives and the men
and women of her small household—her brothers and sisters rather than
her servants—she has done nothing strange; for she has left her daughter
Eustochium—a virgin consecrated to Christ for whose comfort this sketch
is made—far from her noble family and rich only in faith and grace.

<span id="v.CVIII-p21"></span>3. Let me then begin my narrative. Others
may go back a long way even to Paula’s cradle and, if I may say so, to
her swaddling-clothes, and may speak of her mother Blæsilla and her
father Rogatus. Of these the former was a descendant of the Scipios and
the Gracchi; whilst the latter came of a line distinguished in Greece
down to the present day. He was said, indeed, to have in his veins the
blood of Agamemnon who destroyed Troy after a ten years siege. But I
shall praise only what belongs to herself, what wells forth from the
pure spring of her holy mind. When in the gospel the apostles ask their
Lord and Saviour what He will give to those who have left all for His
sake, He tells them that they shall receive an hundredfold now in this
time and in the world to come eternal life. <span
id="fr_2746"></span>[2747](#fn_2746.md) From which we see that it is not
the possession of riches that is praiseworthy but the rejection of them
for Christ’s sake; that, instead of glorying in our privileges, we
should make them of small account as compared with God’s faith. Truly
the Saviour has now in this present time made good His promise to His
servants and handmaidens. For one who despised the glory of a single
city is to-day famous throughout the world; and one who while she lived
at Rome was known by no one outside it has by hiding herself at
Bethlehem become the admiration of all lands Roman and barbarian. For
what race of men is there which does not send pilgrims to the holy
places? And who could there find a greater marvel than Paula? As among
many jewels the most precious shines most brightly, and as the sun with
its beams obscures and puts out the paler fires of the stars; so by her
lowliness she surpassed all others in virtue and influence and, while
she was least among all, was greater than all. The more she cast herself
down, the more she was lifted up by Christ. She was hidden and yet she
was not hidden. By shunning glory she earned glory; for glory follows
virtue as its shadow; and deserting those who seek it, it seeks those
who despise it. But I must not neglect to proceed with my narrative or
dwell too long on a single point forgetful of the rules of writing.

<span id="v.CVIII-p23"></span>4. Being then of such parentage, Paula
married Toxotius in whose veins ran the noble blood of Æneas and the
Julii. Accordingly his daughter, Christ’s virgin Eustochium, is called
Julia, as he Julius.

<span id="v.CVIII-p24"></span>A name from great Iulus handed down. <span
id="fr_2747"></span>[2748](#fn_2747.md)

<span id="v.CVIII-p26"></span>I speak of these things not as of
importance to those who have them, but as worthy of remark in those who
despise them. Men of the world look up to persons who are rich in such
privileges. We on the other hand praise those who for the Saviour’s sake
despise them; and strangely depreciating all who keep them, we eulogize
those who are unwilling to do so. Thus nobly born, Paula through her
fruitfulness and her chastity won approval from all, from her husband
first, then from <span id="page_197">p. 197</span> <span
id="v.CVIII-Page_197"></span>her relatives, and lastly from the whole
city. She bore five children; Blæsilla, for whose death I consoled her
while at Rome; <span id="fr_2748"></span>[2749](#fn_2748.md) Paulina, who
has left the reverend and admirable Pammachius to inherit both her
vows <span id="fr_2749"></span>[2750](#fn_2749.md) and property, to whom
also I addressed a little book on her death; Eustochium, who is now in
the holy places, a precious necklace of virginity and of the church;
Rufina, whose untimely end overcame the affectionate heart of her
mother; and Toxotius, after whom she had no more children. You can thus
see that it was not her wish to fulfil a wife’s duty, but that she only
complied with her husband’s longing to have male offspring.

<span id="v.CVIII-p29"></span>5. When he died, her grief was so great
that she nearly died herself: yet so completely did she then give
herself to the service of the Lord, that it might have seemed that she
had desired his death.

<span id="v.CVIII-p30"></span>In what terms shall I speak of her
distinguished, and noble, and formerly wealthy house; all the riches of
which she spent upon the poor? How can I describe the great
consideration she shewed to all and her far reaching kindness even to
those whom she had never seen? What poor man, as he lay dying, was not
wrapped in blankets given by her? What bedridden person was not
supported with money from her purse? She would seek out such with the
greatest diligence throughout the city, and would think it a misfortune
were any hungry or sick person to be supported by another’s food. So
lavish was her charity that she robbed her children; and, when her
relatives remonstrated with her for doing so, she declared that she was
leaving to them a better inheritance in the mercy of Christ.

<span id="v.CVIII-p31"></span>6. Nor was she long able to endure the
visits and crowded receptions, which her high position in the world and
her exalted family entailed upon her. She received the homage paid to
her sadly, and made all the speed she could to shun and to escape those
who wished to pay her compliments. It so happened that at that
time <span id="fr_2750"></span>[2751](#fn_2750.md) the bishops of the East
and West had been summoned to Rome by letter from the emperors <span
id="fr_2751"></span>[2752](#fn_2751.md) to deal with certain dissensions
between the churches, and in this way she saw two most admirable men and
Christian prelates, Paulinus bishop of Antioch and Epiphanius, bishop of
Salamis or, as it is now called, Constantia, in Cyprus. Epiphanius,
indeed, she received as her guest; and, although Paulinus was staying in
another person’s house, in the warmth of her heart she treated him as if
he too were lodged with her. Inflamed by their virtues she thought more
and more each moment of forsaking her home. Disregarding her house, her
children, her servants, her property, and in a word everything connected
with the world, she was eager—alone and unaccompanied (if ever it could
be said that she was so)—to go to the desert made famous by its Pauls
and by its Antonies. And at last when the winter was over and the sea
was open, and when the bishops were returning to their churches, she
also sailed with them in her prayers and desires. Not to prolong the
story, she went down to Portus accompanied by her brother, her kinsfolk
and above all her own children eager by their demonstrations of
affection to overcome their loving mother. At last the sails were set
and the strokes of the rowers carried the vessel into the deep. On the
shore the little Toxotius stretched forth his hands in entreaty, while
Rufina, now grown up, with silent sobs besought her mother to wait till
she should be married. But still Paula’s eyes were dry as she turned
them heavenwards; and she overcame her love for her children by her love
for God. She knew herself no more as a mother, that she might approve
herself a handmaid of Christ. Yet her heart was rent within her, and she
wrestled with her grief, as though she were being forcibly separated
from parts of herself. The greatness of the affection she had to
overcome made all admire her victory the more. Among the cruel hardships
which attend prisoners of war in the hands of their enemies, there is
none severer than the separation of parents from their children. Though
it is against the laws of nature, she endured this trial with unabated
faith; nay more she sought it with a joyful heart: and overcoming her
love for her children by her greater love for God, she concentrated
herself quietly upon Eustochium alone, the partner alike of her vows and
of her voyage. Meantime the vessel ploughed onwards and all her
fellow-passengers looked back to the shore. But she turned away her eyes
that she might not see what she could not behold without agony. No
mother, it must be confessed, ever loved her children so dearly. Before
setting out she gave them all that she had, disinheriting herself upon
earth that she might find an inheritance in heaven.

<span id="v.CVIII-p34"></span>7. The vessel touched at the island of
Pontia ennobled long since as the place of exile of the illustrious lady
Flavia Domitilla who under the Emperor Domitian was banished because she
confessed herself a Christian; <span
id="fr_2752"></span>[2753](#fn_2752.md) and Paula, when she saw the cells
in which this lady passed the period of her long martyrdom, taking to
herself the wings of faith, more than ever desired to see Jerusalem
<span id="page_198">p. 198</span> <span id="v.CVIII-Page_198"></span>and
the holy places. The strongest winds seemed weak and the greatest speed
slow. After passing between Scylla and Charybdis <span
id="fr_2753"></span>[2754](#fn_2753.md) she committed herself to the
Adriatic sea and had a calm passage to Methone. <span
id="fr_2754"></span>[2755](#fn_2754.md) Stopping here for a short time to
recruit her wearied frame

<span id="v.CVIII-p38"></span>She stretched her dripping limbs upon the
shore:

<span id="v.CVIII-p39"></span>Then sailed past Malea and Cythera’s isle,

<span id="v.CVIII-p40"></span>The scattered Cyclades, and all the lands

<span id="v.CVIII-p41"></span>That narrow in the seas on every
side. <span id="fr_2755"></span>[2756](#fn_2755.md)

<span id="v.CVIII-p43"></span>Then leaving Rhodes and Lycia behind her,
she at last came in sight of Cyprus, where falling at the feet of the
holy and venerable Epiphanius, she was by him detained ten days; though
this was not, as he supposed, to restore her strength but, as the facts
prove, that she might do God’s work. For she visited all the monasteries
in the island, and left, so far as her means allowed, substantial relief
for the brothers in them whom love of the holy man had brought thither
from all parts of the world. Then crossing the narrow sea she landed at
Seleucia, and going up thence to Antioch allowed herself to be detained
for a little time by the affection of the reverend confessor
Paulinus. <span id="fr_2756"></span>[2757](#fn_2756.md) Then, such was the
ardour of her faith that she, a noble lady who had always previously
been carried by eunuchs, went her way—and that in midwinter—riding upon
an ass.

<span id="v.CVIII-p45"></span>8. I say nothing of her journey through
Cœle-Syria and Phœnicia (for it is not my purpose to give you a complete
itinerary of her wanderings); I shall only name such places as are
mentioned in the sacred books. After leaving the Roman colony of Berytus
and the ancient city of Zidon she entered Elijah’s town on the shore at
Zarephath and therein adored her Lord and Saviour. Next passing over the
sands of Tyre on which Paul had once knelt <span
id="fr_2757"></span>[2758](#fn_2757.md) she came to Acco or, as it is now
called, Ptolemais, rode over the plains of Megiddo which had once
witnessed the slaying of Josiah, <span
id="fr_2758"></span>[2759](#fn_2758.md) and entered the land of the
Philistines. Here she could not fail to admire the ruins of Dor, once a
most powerful city; and Strato’s Tower, which though at one time
insignificant was rebuilt by Herod king of Judæa and named Cæsarea in
honour of Cæsar Augustus. <span id="fr_2759"></span>[2760](#fn_2759.md)
Here she saw the house of Cornelius now turned into a Christian church;
and the humble abode of Philip; and the chambers of his daughters the
four virgins “which did prophesy.” <span
id="fr_2760"></span>[2761](#fn_2760.md) She arrived next at Antipatris, a
small town half in ruins, named by Herod after his father Antipater, and
at Lydda, now become Diospolis, a place made famous by the raising again
of Dorcas <span id="fr_2761"></span>[2762](#fn_2761.md) and the restoration
to health of Æneas. <span id="fr_2762"></span>[2763](#fn_2762.md) Not far
from this are Arimathæa, the village of Joseph who buried the
Lord, <span id="fr_2763"></span>[2764](#fn_2763.md) and Nob, once a city of
priests but now the tomb in which their slain bodies rest. <span
id="fr_2764"></span>[2765](#fn_2764.md) Joppa too is hard by, the port of
Jonah’s flight; <span id="fr_2765"></span>[2766](#fn_2765.md) which also—if
I may introduce a poetic fable—saw Andromeda bound to the rock. <span
id="fr_2766"></span>[2767](#fn_2766.md) Again resuming her journey, she
came to Nicopolis, once called Emmaus, where the Lord became known in
the breaking of bread; <span id="fr_2767"></span>[2768](#fn_2767.md) an
action by which He dedicated the house of Cleopas as a church. Starting
thence she made her way up lower and higher Beth-horon, cities founded
by Solomon <span id="fr_2768"></span>[2769](#fn_2768.md) but subsequently
destroyed by several devastating wars; seeing on her right Ajalon and
Gibeon where Joshua the son of Nun when fighting against the five kings
gave commandments to the sun and moon, <span
id="fr_2769"></span>[2770](#fn_2769.md) where also he condemned the
Gibeonites (who by a crafty stratagem had obtained a treaty) to be
hewers of wood and drawers of water. <span
id="fr_2770"></span>[2771](#fn_2770.md) At Gibeah also, now a complete
ruin, she stopped for a little while remembering its sin, and the
cutting of the concubine into pieces, and how in spite of all this three
hundred men of the tribe of Benjamin were saved <span
id="fr_2771"></span>[2772](#fn_2771.md) that in after days Paul might be
called a Benjamite.

<span id="v.CVIII-p61"></span>9. To make a long story short, leaving on
her left the mausoleum of Helena queen of Adiabene <span
id="fr_2772"></span>[2773](#fn_2772.md) who in time of famine had sent corn
to the Jewish people, Paula entered Jerusalem, Jebus, or Salem, that
city of three names which after it had sunk to ashes and decay was by
Ælius Hadrianus restored once more as Ælia. <span
id="fr_2773"></span>[2774](#fn_2773.md) And although the proconsul of
Palestine, who was an intimate friend of her house, sent forward his
apparitors and gave orders to have his official residence <span
id="fr_2774"></span>[2775](#fn_2774.md) placed at her disposal, she chose a
humble cell in preference to it. Moreover, in visiting the holy places
so great was the passion and the enthusiasm she exhibited for each, that
she could never have torn herself away from one had she not been eager
to visit the rest. Before the Cross she threw herself down in <span
id="page_199">p. 199</span> <span id="v.CVIII-Page_199"></span>adoration
as though she beheld the Lord hanging upon it: and when she entered the
tomb which was the scene of the Resurrection she kissed the stone which
the angel had rolled away from the door of the sepulchre. <span
id="fr_2775"></span>[2776](#fn_2775.md) Indeed so ardent was her faith that
she even licked with her mouth the very spot on which the Lord’s body
had lain, like one athirst for the river which he has longed for. What
tears she shed there, what groans she uttered, and what grief she poured
forth, all Jerusalem knows; the Lord also to whom she prayed knows.
Going out thence she made the ascent of Zion; a name which signifies
either “citadel” or “watch-tower.” This formed the city which David
formerly stormed and afterwards rebuilt. <span
id="fr_2776"></span>[2777](#fn_2776.md) Of its storming it is written, “Woe
to Ariel, to Ariel”—that is, God’s lion, (and indeed in those days it
was extremely strong)—“the city which David stormed:” <span
id="fr_2777"></span>[2778](#fn_2777.md) and of its rebuilding it is said,
“His foundation is in the holy mountains: the Lord loveth the gates of
Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.” <span
id="fr_2778"></span>[2779](#fn_2778.md) He does not mean the gates which we
see to-day in dust and ashes; the gates he means are those against which
hell prevails not <span id="fr_2779"></span>[2780](#fn_2779.md) and through
which the multitude of those who believe in Christ enter in. <span
id="fr_2780"></span>[2781](#fn_2780.md) There was shewn to her upholding
the portico of a church the bloodstained column to which our Lord is
said to have been bound when He suffered His scourging. There was shewn
to her also the spot where the Holy Spirit came down upon the souls of
the one hundred and twenty believers, thus fulfilling the prophecy of
Joel. <span id="fr_2781"></span>[2782](#fn_2781.md)

<span id="v.CVIII-p72"></span>10. Then, after distributing money to the
poor and her fellow-servants so far as her means allowed, she proceeded
to Bethlehem stopping only on the right side of the road to visit
Rachel’s tomb. (Here it was that she gave birth to her son destined to
be not what his dying mother called him, Benoni, that is the “Son of my
pangs” but as his father in the spirit prophetically named him Benjamin,
that is “the Son of the right hand).” <span
id="fr_2782"></span>[2783](#fn_2782.md) After this she came to Bethlehem
and entered into the cave where the Saviour was born. <span
id="fr_2783"></span>[2784](#fn_2783.md) Here, when she looked upon the inn
made sacred by the virgin and the stall where the ox knew his owner and
the ass his master’s crib, <span id="fr_2784"></span>[2785](#fn_2784.md)
and where the words of the same prophet had been fulfilled “Blessed is
he that soweth beside the waters where the ox and the ass trample the
seed under their feet:” <span id="fr_2785"></span>[2786](#fn_2785.md) when
she looked upon these things I say, she protested in my hearing that she
could behold with the eyes of faith the infant Lord wrapped in swaddling
clothes and crying in the manger, the wise men worshipping Him, the star
shining overhead, the virgin mother, the attentive foster-father, the
shepherds coming by night to see “the word that was come to pass” <span
id="fr_2786"></span>[2787](#fn_2786.md) and thus even then to consecrate
those opening phrases of the evangelist John “In the beginning was the
word” and “the word was made flesh.” <span
id="fr_2787"></span>[2788](#fn_2787.md) She declared that she could see the
slaughtered innocents, the raging Herod, Joseph and Mary fleeing into
Egypt; and with a mixture of tears and joy she cried: ‘Hail Bethlehem,
house of bread, <span id="fr_2788"></span>[2789](#fn_2788.md) wherein was
born that Bread that came down from heaven. <span
id="fr_2789"></span>[2790](#fn_2789.md) Hail Ephratah, land of
fruitfulness <span id="fr_2790"></span>[2791](#fn_2790.md) and of
fertility, whose fruit is the Lord Himself. Concerning thee has Micah
prophesied of old, “Thou Bethlehem Ephratah art not <span
id="fr_2791"></span>[2792](#fn_2791.md) the least among the thousands of
Judah, for out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler
in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.
Therefore wilt thou <span id="fr_2792"></span>[2793](#fn_2792.md) give them
up, until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth: then
the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of
Israel.” <span id="fr_2793"></span>[2794](#fn_2793.md) For in thee was born
the prince begotten before Lucifer. <span
id="fr_2794"></span>[2795](#fn_2794.md) Whose birth from the Father is
before all time: and the cradle of David’s race continued in thee, until
the virgin brought forth her son and the remnant of the people that
believed in Christ returned unto the children of Israel and preached
freely to them in words like these: “It was necessary that the word of
God should first have been spoken to you; but seeing ye put it from you
and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the
Gentiles.” <span id="fr_2795"></span>[2796](#fn_2795.md) For the Lord hath
said: “I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of
Israel.” <span id="fr_2796"></span>[2797](#fn_2796.md) At that time also
the words of Jacob were fulfilled concerning Him, “A prince shall not
depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until He come
for whom it is laid up, <span id="fr_2797"></span>[2798](#fn_2797.md) and
He shall be for the expectation of the nations.” <span
id="fr_2798"></span>[2799](#fn_2798.md) Well did David swear, well did he
make a vow saying: “Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my
house nor go up into my bed: I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or
slumber to my eyelids, or rest to the temples of my head, <span
id="fr_2799"></span>[2800](#fn_2799.md) until I find out a place for the
Lord, an habitation for the…God of Jacob.” <span
id="fr_2800"></span>[2801](#fn_2800.md) And immediately he <span
id="page_200">p. 200</span> <span id="v.CVIII-Page_200"></span>explained
the object of his desire, seeing with prophetic eyes that He would come
whom we now believe to have come. “Lo we heard of Him at Ephratah: we
found Him in the fields of the wood.” <span
id="fr_2801"></span>[2802](#fn_2801.md) The Hebrew word *Zo* as have
learned from your lessons <span id="fr_2802"></span>[2803](#fn_2802.md)
means not *her*, that is Mary the Lord’s mother, but *him* that is the
Lord Himself. Therefore he says boldly: “We will go into His tabernacle:
we will worship at His footstool.” <span
id="fr_2803"></span>[2804](#fn_2803.md) I too, miserable sinner though I
am, have been accounted worthy to kiss the manger in which the Lord
cried as a babe, and to pray in the cave in which the travailing virgin
gave birth to the infant Lord. “This is my rest” for it is my Lord’s
native place; “here will I dwell” <span
id="fr_2804"></span>[2805](#fn_2804.md) for this spot has my Saviour
chosen. “I have prepared a lamp for my Christ.” <span
id="fr_2805"></span>[2806](#fn_2805.md) “My soul shall live unto Him and my
seed shall serve Him.” <span id="fr_2806"></span>[2807](#fn_2806.md)

<span id="v.CVIII-p98"></span>After this Paula went a short distance
down the hill to the tower of Edar, <span
id="fr_2807"></span>[2808](#fn_2807.md) that is ‘of the flock,’ near which
Jacob fed his flocks, and where the shepherds keeping watch by night
were privileged to hear the words: “Glory to God in the highest and on
earth peace, goodwill toward men.” <span
id="fr_2808"></span>[2809](#fn_2808.md) While they were keeping their sheep
they found the Lamb of God; whose fleece bright and clean was made wet
with the dew of heaven when it was dry upon all the earth beside, <span
id="fr_2809"></span>[2810](#fn_2809.md) and whose blood when sprinkled on
the doorposts drove off the destroyer of Egypt <span
id="fr_2810"></span>[2811](#fn_2810.md) and took away the sins of the
world. <span id="fr_2811"></span>[2812](#fn_2811.md)

<span id="v.CVIII-p104"></span>11. Then immediately quickening her pace
she began to move along the old road which leads to Gaza, that is to the
‘power’ or ‘wealth’ of God, silently meditating on that type of the
Gentiles, the Ethiopian eunuch, who in spite of the prophet changed his
skin <span id="fr_2812"></span>[2813](#fn_2812.md) and whilst he read the
old testament found the fountain of the gospel. <span
id="fr_2813"></span>[2814](#fn_2813.md) Next turning to the right she
passed from Bethzur <span id="fr_2814"></span>[2815](#fn_2814.md) to Eshcol
which means “a cluster of grapes.” It was hence that the spies brought
back that marvellous cluster which was the proof of the fertility of the
land <span id="fr_2815"></span>[2816](#fn_2815.md) and a type of Him who
says of Himself: “I have trodden the wine press alone; and of the people
there was none with me.” <span id="fr_2816"></span>[2817](#fn_2816.md)
Shortly afterwards she entered the home <span
id="fr_2817"></span>[2818](#fn_2817.md) of Sarah and beheld the birthplace
of Isaac and the traces of Abraham’s oak under which he saw Christ’s day
and was glad. <span id="fr_2818"></span>[2819](#fn_2818.md) And rising up
from thence she went up to Hebron, that is Kirjath-Arba, or the City of
the Four Men. These are Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the great Adam whom
the Hebrews suppose (from the book of Joshua the son of Nun) to be
buried there. <span id="fr_2819"></span>[2820](#fn_2819.md) But many are of
opinion that Caleb is the fourth and a monument at one side is pointed
out as his. After seeing these places she did not care to go on to
Kirjath-sepher, that is “the village of letters;” because despising the
letter that killeth she had found the spirit that giveth life. <span
id="fr_2820"></span>[2821](#fn_2820.md) She admired more the upper springs
and the nether springs which Othniel the son of Kenaz the son of
Jephunneh received in place of a south land and a waterless
possession, <span id="fr_2821"></span>[2822](#fn_2821.md) and by the
conducting of which he watered the dry fields of the old covenant. For
thus did he typify the redemption which the sinner finds for his old
sins in the waters of baptism. On the next day soon after sunrise she
stood upon the brow of Capharbarucha, <span
id="fr_2822"></span>[2823](#fn_2822.md) that is, “the house of blessing,”
the point to which Abraham pursued the Lord when he made intercession
with Him. <span id="fr_2823"></span>[2824](#fn_2823.md) And here, as she
looked down upon the wide solitude and upon the country once belonging
to Sodom and Gomorrah, to Admah and Zeboim, she beheld the balsam vines
of Engedi and Zoar. By Zoar I mean that “heifer of three years
old” <span id="fr_2824"></span>[2825](#fn_2824.md) which was formerly
called Bela <span id="fr_2825"></span>[2826](#fn_2825.md) and in Syriac is
rendered Zoar that is ‘little.’ She called to mind the cave in which Lot
found refuge, and with tears in her eyes warned the virgins her
companions to beware of “wine wherein is excess;” <span
id="fr_2826"></span>[2827](#fn_2826.md) for it was to this that the
Moabites and Ammonites owe their origin. <span
id="fr_2827"></span>[2828](#fn_2827.md)

<span id="v.CVIII-p121"></span>12. I linger long in the land of the
midday sun for it was there and then that the spouse found her
bridegroom at rest <span id="fr_2828"></span>[2829](#fn_2828.md) and Joseph
drank wine with his brothers once more. <span
id="fr_2829"></span>[2830](#fn_2829.md) I will return to Jerusalem and,
passing through Tekoa the home of Amos, <span
id="fr_2830"></span>[2831](#fn_2830.md) I will look upon the glistening
cross of Mount Olivet from which the Saviour made His ascension to the
Father. <span id="fr_2831"></span>[2832](#fn_2831.md) Here year by year a
red heifer was burned as a holocaust to the Lord and its ashes were used
to purify the children of Israel. <span
id="fr_2832"></span>[2833](#fn_2832.md) Here also according to Ezekiel the
Cherubim after leaving the temple founded the church of the Lord. <span
id="fr_2833"></span>[2834](#fn_2833.md)

<span id="v.CVIII-p128"></span>After this Paula visited the tomb of
Lazarus and beheld the hospitable roof of Mary and Martha, as well as
Bethphage, ‘the town of the <span id="page_201">p. 201</span> <span
id="v.CVIII-Page_201"></span>priestly jaws.’ <span
id="fr_2834"></span>[2835](#fn_2834.md) Here it was that a restive foal
typical of the Gentiles received the bridle of God, and covered with the
garments of the apostles <span id="fr_2835"></span>[2836](#fn_2835.md)
offered its lowly back <span id="fr_2836"></span>[2837](#fn_2836.md) for
Him to sit on. From this she went straight on down the hill to Jericho
thinking of the wounded man in the gospel, of the savagery of the
priests and Levites who passed him by, and of the kindness of the
Samaritan, that is, the guardian, who placed the half-dead man upon his
own beast and brought him down to the inn of the church. <span
id="fr_2837"></span>[2838](#fn_2837.md) She noticed the place called
Adomim <span id="fr_2838"></span>[2839](#fn_2838.md) or the Place of Blood,
so-called because much blood was shed there in the frequent incursions
of marauders. She beheld also the sycamore tree <span
id="fr_2839"></span>[2840](#fn_2839.md) of Zacchæus, by which is signified
the good works of repentance whereby he trod under foot his former sins
of bloodshed and rapine, and from which he saw the Most High as from a
pinnacle of virtue. She was shewn too the spot by the wayside where the
blind men sat who, receiving their sight from the Lord, <span
id="fr_2840"></span>[2841](#fn_2840.md) became types of the two
peoples <span id="fr_2841"></span>[2842](#fn_2841.md) who should believe
upon Him. Then entering Jericho she saw the city which Hiel founded in
Abiram his firstborn and of which he set up the gates in his youngest
son Segub. <span id="fr_2842"></span>[2843](#fn_2842.md) She looked upon
the camp of Gilgal and the hill of the foreskins <span
id="fr_2843"></span>[2844](#fn_2843.md) suggestive of the mystery of the
second circumcision: <span id="fr_2844"></span>[2845](#fn_2844.md) and she
gazed at the twelve stones brought thither out of the bed of
Jordan <span id="fr_2845"></span>[2846](#fn_2845.md) to be symbols of those
twelve foundations on which are written the names of the twelve
apostles. <span id="fr_2846"></span>[2847](#fn_2846.md) She saw also that
fountain of the Law most bitter and barren which the true Elisha healed
by his wisdom changing it into a well sweet and fertilising. <span
id="fr_2847"></span>[2848](#fn_2847.md) Scarcely had the night passed away
when burning with eagerness she hastened to the Jordan, stood by the
brink of the river, and as the sun rose recalled to mind the rising of
the sun of righteousness; <span id="fr_2848"></span>[2849](#fn_2848.md) how
the priest’s feet stood firm in the middle of the river-bed; <span
id="fr_2849"></span>[2850](#fn_2849.md) how afterwards at the command of
Elijah and Elisha the waters were divided hither and thither and made
way for them to pass; and again how the Lord had cleansed by His baptism
waters which the deluge had polluted and the destruction of mankind had
defiled.

<span id="v.CVIII-p145"></span>13. It would be tedious were I tell of
the valley of Achor, that is, of ‘trouble and crowds,’ where theft and
covetousness were condemned; <span id="fr_2850"></span>[2851](#fn_2850.md)
and of Bethel, ‘the house of God,’ where Jacob poor and destitute slept
upon the bare ground. Here it was that, having set beneath his head a
stone which in Zechariah is described as having seven eyes <span
id="fr_2851"></span>[2852](#fn_2851.md) and in Isaiah is spoken of as a
corner-stone, <span id="fr_2852"></span>[2853](#fn_2852.md) he beheld a
ladder reaching up to heaven; yes, and the Lord standing high above
it <span id="fr_2853"></span>[2854](#fn_2853.md) holding out His hand to
such as were ascending and hurling from on high such as were careless.
Also when she was in Mount Ephraim she made pilgrimages to the tombs of
Joshua the son of Nun and of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest,
exactly opposite the one to the other; that of Joshua being built at
Timnath-serah “on the north side of the hill of Gaash,” <span
id="fr_2854"></span>[2855](#fn_2854.md) and that of Eleazar “in a hill that
pertained to Phinehas his son.” <span
id="fr_2855"></span>[2856](#fn_2855.md) She was somewhat surprised to find
that he who had had the distribution of the land in his own hands had
selected for himself portions uneven and rocky. What shall I say about
Shiloh where a ruined altar <span id="fr_2856"></span>[2857](#fn_2856.md)
is still shewn to-day, and where the tribe of Benjamin anticipated
Romulus in the rape of the Sabine women? <span
id="fr_2857"></span>[2858](#fn_2857.md) Passing by Shechem (not Sychar as
many wrongly read <span id="fr_2858"></span>[2859](#fn_2858) .md) or as it
is now called Neapolis, she entered the church built upon the side of
Mount Gerizim around Jacob’s well; that well where the Lord was sitting
when hungry and thirsty He was refreshed by the faith of the woman of
Samaria. Forsaking her five husbands by whom are intended the five books
of Moses, and that sixth not a husband of whom she boasted, to wit the
false teacher Dositheus, <span id="fr_2859"></span>[2860](#fn_2859.md) she
found the true Messiah and the true Saviour. Turning away thence Paula
saw the tombs of the twelve patriarchs, and Samaria which in honour of
Augustus Herod renamed Augusta or in Greek Sebaste. There lie the
prophets Elisha and Obadiah and John the Baptist than whom there is not
a greater among those that are born of women. <span
id="fr_2860"></span>[2861](#fn_2860.md) And here she was filled with terror
by the marvels she beheld; for she saw demons screaming under different
tortures before the tombs of the saints, and men howling like wolves,
baying like dogs, roaring like lions, hissing like serpents and
bellowing like bulls. They twisted their heads and bent them backwards
until they touched the ground; women too were suspended head downward
and their clothes did not fall off. <span
id="fr_2861"></span>[2862](#fn_2861.md) Paula pitied them all, and shedding
tears over them prayed Christ to have mercy on them. And weak as she was
she climbed the mountain on foot; for in two of its caves Obadiah in a
time of persecution <span id="page_202">p. 202</span> <span
id="v.CVIII-Page_202"></span>and famine had fed a hundred prophets with
bread and water. <span id="fr_2862"></span>[2863](#fn_2862.md) Then she
passed quickly through Nazareth the nursery of the Lord; Cana and
Capernaum familiar with the signs wrought by Him; the lake of Tiberias
sanctified by His voyages upon it; the wilderness where countless
Gentiles were satisfied with a few loaves while the twelve baskets of
the tribes of Israel were filled with the fragments left by them that
had eaten. <span id="fr_2863"></span>[2864](#fn_2863.md) She made the
ascent of mount Tabor whereon the Lord was transfigured. <span
id="fr_2864"></span>[2865](#fn_2864.md) In the distance she beheld the
range of Hermon; <span id="fr_2865"></span>[2866](#fn_2865.md) and the wide
stretching plains of Galilee where Sisera and all his host had once been
overcome by Barak; and the torrent <span
id="fr_2866"></span>[2867](#fn_2866.md) Kishon separating the level ground
into two parts. Hard by also the town of Nain was pointed out to her,
where the widow’s son was raised. <span
id="fr_2867"></span>[2868](#fn_2867.md) Time would fail me sooner than
speech were I to recount all the places to which the revered Paula was
carried by her incredible faith.

<span id="v.CVIII-p164"></span>14. I will now pass on to Egypt, pausing
for a while on the way at Socoh, and at Samson’s well which he clave in
the hollow place that was in the jaw. <span
id="fr_2868"></span>[2869](#fn_2868.md) Here I will lave my parched lips
and refresh myself before visiting Moresheth; in old days famed for the
tomb of the prophet Micah, <span id="fr_2869"></span>[2870](#fn_2869.md)
and now for its church. Then skirting the country of the Horites and
Gittites, Mareshah, Edom, and Lachish, and traversing the lonely wastes
of the desert where the tracks of the traveller are lost in the yielding
sand, I will come to the river of Egypt called Sihor, <span
id="fr_2870"></span>[2871](#fn_2870.md) that is “the muddy river,” and go
through the five cities of Egypt which speak the language of
Canaan, <span id="fr_2871"></span>[2872](#fn_2871.md) and through the land
of Goshen and the plains of Zoan <span
id="fr_2872"></span>[2873](#fn_2872.md) on which God wrought his marvellous
works. And I will visit the city of No, which has since become
Alexandria; <span id="fr_2873"></span>[2874](#fn_2873.md) and Nitria, the
town of the Lord, where day by day the filth of multitudes is washed
away with the pure nitre of virtue. No sooner did Paula come in sight of
it than there came to meet her the reverend and estimable bishop, the
confessor Isidore, accompanied by countless multitudes of monks many of
whom were of priestly or of Levitical rank. <span
id="fr_2874"></span>[2875](#fn_2874.md) On seeing these Paula rejoiced to
behold the Lord’s glory manifested in them; but protested that she had
no claim to be received with such honour. Need I speak of the Macarii,
Arsenius, Serapion, <span id="fr_2875"></span>[2876](#fn_2875.md) or other
pillars of Christ! Was there any cell that she did not enter? Or any man
at whose feet she did not throw herself? In each of His saints she
believed that she saw Christ Himself; and whatever she bestowed upon
them she rejoiced to feel that she had bestowed it upon the Lord. Her
enthusiasm was wonderful and her endurance scarcely credible in a woman.
Forgetful of her sex and of her weakness she even desired to make her
abode, together with the girls who accompanied her, among these
thousands of monks. And, as they were all willing to welcome her, she
might perhaps have sought and obtained permission to do so; had she not
been drawn away by a still greater passion for the holy places. Coming
by sea from Pelusium to Maioma on account of the great heat, she
returned so rapidly that you would have thought her a bird. Not long
afterwards, making up her mind to dwell permanently in holy Bethlehem,
she took up her abode for three years in a miserable hostelry; till she
could build the requisite cells and monastic buildings, to say nothing
of a guest house for passing travellers where they might find the
welcome which Mary and Joseph had missed. At this point I conclude my
narrative of the journeys that she made accompanied by Eustochium and
many other virgins.

<span id="v.CVIII-p173"></span>15. I am now free to describe at greater
length the virtue which was her peculiar charm; and in setting forth
this I call God to witness that I am no flatterer. I add nothing. I
exaggerate nothing. On the contrary I tone down much that I may not
appear to relate incredibilities. My carping critics must not insinuate
that I am drawing on my imagination or decking Paula, like Æsop’s crow,
with the fine feathers of other birds. Humility is the first of
Christian graces, and hers was so pronounced that one who had never seen
her, and who on account of her celebrity had desired to see her, would
have believed that he saw not her but the lowest of her maids. When she
was surrounded by companies of virgins she was always the least
remarkable in dress, in speech, in gesture, and in gait. From the time
that her husband died until she fell asleep herself she never sat at
meat with a man, even though she might know him to stand upon the
pinnacle of the episcopate. She never entered a bath except when
dangerously ill. Even in the severest fever she rested not on an
ordinary bed but on the hard ground covered only with a mat of goat’s
hair; if that can be called rest which made day and night alike a time
of almost unbroken prayer. Well did she fulfil the words of the psalter:
“All the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my
tears”! <span id="fr_2876"></span>[2877](#fn_2876.md) <span
id="page_203">p. 203</span> <span id="v.CVIII-Page_203"></span>Her tears
welled forth as it were from fountains, and she lamented her slightest
faults as if they were sins of the deepest dye. Constantly did I warn
her to spare her eyes and to keep them for the reading of the gospel;
but she only said: ‘I must disfigure that face which contrary to God’s
commandment I have painted with rouge, white lead, and antimony. I must
mortify that body which has been given up to many pleasures. I must make
up for my long laughter by constant weeping. I must exchange my soft
linen and costly silks for rough goat’s hair. I who have pleased my
husband and the world in the past, desire now to please Christ.’ Were I
among her great and signal virtues to select her chastity as a subject
of praise, my words would seem superfluous; for, even when she was still
in the world, she set an example to all the matrons of Rome, and bore
herself so admirably that the most slanderous never ventured to couple
scandal with her name. <span id="fr_2877"></span>[2878](#fn_2877.md) No
mind could be more considerate than hers, or none kinder towards the
lowly. She did not court the powerful; at the same time, if the proud
and the vainglorious sought her, she did not turn from them with
disdain. If she saw a poor man, she supported him: and if she saw a rich
one, she urged him to do good. Her liberality alone knew no bounds.
Indeed, so anxious was she to turn no needy person away that she
borrowed money at interest and often contracted new loans to pay off old
ones. I was wrong, I admit; but when I saw her so profuse in giving, I
reproved her alleging the apostle’s words: “I mean not that other men be
eased and ye burthened; but by an equality that now at this time your
abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may
be a supply for your want.” <span id="fr_2878"></span>[2879](#fn_2878.md) I
quoted from the gospel the Saviour’s words: “he that hath two coats, let
him impart one of them to him that hath none”; <span
id="fr_2879"></span>[2880](#fn_2879.md) and I warned her that she might not
always have means to do as she would wish. Other arguments I adduced to
the same purpose; but with admirable modesty and brevity she overruled
them all. “God is my witness,” she said, “that what I do I do for His
sake. My prayer is that I may die a beggar not leaving a penny to my
daughter and indebted to strangers for my winding sheet.” She then
concluded with these words: “I, if I beg, shall find many to give to me;
but if this beggar does not obtain help from me who by borrowing can
give it to him, he will die; and if he dies, of whom will his soul be
required?” I wished her to be more careful in managing her concerns, but
she with a faith more glowing than mine clave to the Saviour with her
whole heart and poor in spirit followed the Lord in His poverty, giving
back to Him what she had received and becoming poor for His sake. She
obtained her wish at last and died leaving her daughter overwhelmed with
a mass of debt. This Eustochium still owes and indeed cannot hope to pay
off by her own exertions; only the mercy of Christ can free her from it.

<span id="v.CVIII-p178"></span>16. Many married ladies make it a habit
to confer gifts upon their own trumpeters, and while they are extremely
profuse to a few, withhold all help from the many. From this fault Paula
was altogether free. She gave her money to each according as each had
need, not ministering to self-indulgence but relieving want. No poor
person went away from her empty handed. And all this she was enabled to
do not by the greatness of her wealth but by her careful management of
it. She constantly had on her lips such phrases as these: “Blessed are
the merciful for they shall obtain mercy:” <span
id="fr_2880"></span>[2881](#fn_2880.md) and “water will quench a flaming
fire; and alms maketh an atonement for sins;” <span
id="fr_2881"></span>[2882](#fn_2881.md) and “make to yourselves friends of
the mammon of unrighteousness that…they may receive you into everlasting
habitations;” <span id="fr_2882"></span>[2883](#fn_2882.md) and “give
alms…and behold all things are clean unto you;” <span
id="fr_2883"></span>[2884](#fn_2883.md) and Daniel’s words to King
Nebuchadnezzar in which he admonished him to redeem his sins by
almsgiving. <span id="fr_2884"></span>[2885](#fn_2884.md) She wished to
spend her money not upon these stones, that shall pass away with the
earth and the world, but upon those living stones, which roll over the
earth; <span id="fr_2885"></span>[2886](#fn_2885.md) of which in the
apocalypse of John the city of the great king is built; <span
id="fr_2886"></span>[2887](#fn_2886.md) of which also the scripture tells
us that they shall be changed into sapphire and emerald and jasper and
other gems. <span id="fr_2887"></span>[2888](#fn_2887.md)

<span id="v.CVIII-p187"></span>17. But these qualities she may well
share with a few others and the devil knows that it is not in these that
the highest virtue consists. For, when Job has lost his substance and
when his house and children have been destroyed, Satan says to the Lord:
“Skin for skin, yea all that a man hath, will he give for his life. But
put forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will
curse thee to thy face.” <span id="fr_2888"></span>[2889](#fn_2888.md) We
know that many persons while they have given alms have yet given nothing
which touches their bodily comfort; and while they have held out a
helping hand to those in need are themselves overcome with sensual
indulgences; they white<span id="page_204">p. 204</span> <span
id="v.CVIII-Page_204"></span>wash the outside but within they are “full
of dead men’s bones.” <span id="fr_2889"></span>[2890](#fn_2889.md) Paula
was not one of these. Her self-restraint was so great as to be almost
immoderate; and her fasts and labours were so severe as almost to weaken
her constitution. Except on feast days she would scarcely ever take oil
with her food; a fact from which may be judged what she thought of wine,
sauce, fish, honey, milk, eggs, and other things agreeable to the
palate. Some persons believe that in taking these they are extremely
frugal; and, even if they surfeit themselves with them, they still fancy
their chastity safe.

<span id="v.CVIII-p190"></span>18. Envy always follows in the track of
virtue: as Horace says, it is ever the mountain top that is smitten by
the lightning. <span id="fr_2890"></span>[2891](#fn_2890.md) It is not
surprising that I declare this of men and women, when the jealousy of
the Pharisees succeeded in crucifying our Lord Himself. All the saints
have had illwishers, and even Paradise was not free from the serpent
through whose malice death came into the world. <span
id="fr_2891"></span>[2892](#fn_2891.md) So the Lord stirred up against
Paula Hadad the Edomite <span id="fr_2892"></span>[2893](#fn_2892.md) to
buffet her that she might not be exalted, and warned her frequently by
the thorn in her flesh <span id="fr_2893"></span>[2894](#fn_2893.md) not to
be elated by the greatness of her own virtues or to fancy that, compared
with other women, she had attained the summit of perfection. For my part
I used to say that it was best to give in to rancour and to retire
before passion. So Jacob dealt with his brother Esau; so David met the
unrelenting persecution of Saul. I reminded her how the first of these
fled into Mesopotamia; <span id="fr_2894"></span>[2895](#fn_2894.md) and
how the second surrendered himself to the Philistines, <span
id="fr_2895"></span>[2896](#fn_2895.md) and chose to submit to foreign foes
rather than to enemies at home. She however replied as follows:—‘Your
suggestion would be a wise one if the devil did not everywhere fight
against God’s servants and handmaidens, and did he not always precede
the fugitives to their chosen refuges. Moreover, I am deterred from
accepting it by my love for the holy places; and I cannot find another
Bethlehem elsewhere. Why may I not by my patience conquer this ill will?
Why may I not by my humility break down this pride, and when I am
smitten on the one cheek offer to the smiter the other? <span
id="fr_2896"></span>[2897](#fn_2896.md) Surely the apostle Paul says
“Overcome evil with good.” <span id="fr_2897"></span>[2898](#fn_2897.md)
Did not the apostles glory when they suffered reproach for the Lord’s
sake? Did not even the Saviour humble Himself, taking the form of a
servant and being made obedient to the Father unto death, even the death
of the cross, <span id="fr_2898"></span>[2899](#fn_2898.md) that He might
save us by His passion? If Job had not fought the battle and won the
victory, he would never have received the crown of righteousness, or
have heard the Lord say: “Thinkest thou that I have spoken unto thee for
aught else than this, that thou mightest appear righteous.” <span
id="fr_2899"></span>[2900](#fn_2899.md) In the gospel those only are said
to be blessed who suffer persecution for righteousness’ sake. <span
id="fr_2900"></span>[2901](#fn_2900.md) My conscience is at rest, and I
know that it is not from any fault of mine that I am suffering; moreover
affliction in this world is a ground for expecting a reward hereafter.’
When the enemy was more than usually forward and ventured to reproach
her to her face, she used to chant the words of the psalter: “While the
wicked was before me, I was dumb with silence; I held my peace even from
good:” <span id="fr_2901"></span>[2902](#fn_2901.md) and again, “I as a
deaf man heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his
mouth:” <span id="fr_2902"></span>[2903](#fn_2902.md) and “I was as a man
that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.” <span
id="fr_2903"></span>[2904](#fn_2903.md) When she felt herself tempted, she
dwelt upon the words in Deuteronomy: “The Lord your God proveth you, to
know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all
your soul.” <span id="fr_2904"></span>[2905](#fn_2904.md) In tribulations
and afflictions she turned to the splendid language of Isaiah: “Ye that
are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts, look for
tribulation upon tribulation, for hope also upon hope: yet a little
while must these things be by reason of the malice of the lips and by
reason of a spiteful tongue.” <span id="fr_2905"></span>[2906](#fn_2905.md)
This passage of scripture she explained for her own consolation as
meaning that the weaned, that is, those who have come to full age, must
endure tribulation upon tribulation that they may be accounted worthy to
receive hope upon hope. She recalled to mind also the words of the
apostle, “we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation
worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope: and hope
maketh not ashamed” <span id="fr_2906"></span>[2907](#fn_2906.md) and
“though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by
day”: <span id="fr_2907"></span>[2908](#fn_2907.md) and “our light
affliction which is but for a moment worketh in us <span
id="fr_2908"></span>[2909](#fn_2908.md) an eternal weight of glory; while
we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not
seen: for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which
are not seen are eternal.” <span id="fr_2909"></span>[2910](#fn_2909.md)
She used to say that, although to human impatience the time might seem
slow in coming, yet that it would not be long but that presently help
would come from God who says: “In an acceptable time have I heard thee,
and in a day of salvation have I helped <span id="page_205">p.
205</span> <span id="v.CVIII-Page_205"></span>thee.” <span
id="fr_2910"></span>[2911](#fn_2910.md) We ought not, she declared, to
dread the deceitful lips and tongues of the wicked, for we rejoice in
the aid of the Lord who warns us by His prophet: “fear ye not the
reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings; for the moth
shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like
wool”: <span id="fr_2911"></span>[2912](#fn_2911.md) and she quoted His own
words, “In your patience ye shall win your souls”: <span
id="fr_2912"></span>[2913](#fn_2912.md) as well as those of the apostle,
“the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with
the glory which shall be revealed in us”: <span
id="fr_2913"></span>[2914](#fn_2913.md) and in another place, “we are to
suffer affliction” <span id="fr_2914"></span>[2915](#fn_2914.md) that we
may be patient in all things that befall us, for “he that is slow to
wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth
folly.” <span id="fr_2915"></span>[2916](#fn_2915.md)

<span id="v.CVIII-p217"></span>19. In her frequent sicknesses and
infirmities she used to say, “when I am weak, then am I strong:” <span
id="fr_2916"></span>[2917](#fn_2916.md) “we have our treasure in earthen
vessels” <span id="fr_2917"></span>[2918](#fn_2917.md) until “this
corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have
put on immortality” <span id="fr_2918"></span>[2919](#fn_2918.md) and again
“as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also
aboundeth by Christ:” <span id="fr_2919"></span>[2920](#fn_2919.md) and
then as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the
consolation. <span id="fr_2920"></span>[2921](#fn_2920.md) In sorrow she
used to sing: “Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou
disquieted within me? hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him who is
the health of my countenance and my God.” <span
id="fr_2921"></span>[2922](#fn_2921.md) In the hour of danger she used to
say: “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself and take up
his cross and follow me:” <span id="fr_2922"></span>[2923](#fn_2922.md) and
again “whosoever will save his life shall lose it,” and “whosoever will
lose his life for my sake the same shall save it.” <span
id="fr_2923"></span>[2924](#fn_2923.md) When the exhaustion of her
substance and the ruin of her property were announced to her she only
said: “What is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world and lose
his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul:” <span
id="fr_2924"></span>[2925](#fn_2924.md) and “naked came I out of my
mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither. The Lord gave, and the
Lord hath taken away: blessed be the name of the Lord:” <span
id="fr_2925"></span>[2926](#fn_2925.md) and Saint John’s words, “Love not
the world neither the things that are in the world. For all that is in
the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes and the pride
of life, is not of the Father but is of the world. And the world passeth
away and the lust thereof.” <span id="fr_2926"></span>[2927](#fn_2926.md) I
know that when word was sent to her of the serious illnesses of her
children and particularly of Toxotius whom she dearly loved, she first
by her self-control fulfilled the saying: “I was troubled and I did not
speak,” <span id="fr_2927"></span>[2928](#fn_2927.md) and then cried out in
the words of scripture, “He that loveth son or daughter more than me is
not worthy of me.” <span id="fr_2928"></span>[2929](#fn_2928.md) And she
prayed to the Lord and said: Lord “preserve thou the children of those
that are appointed to die,” <span id="fr_2929"></span>[2930](#fn_2929.md)
that is, of those who for thy sake every day die bodily. I am aware that
a talebearer—a class of persons who do a great deal of harm—once told
her as a kindness that owing to her great fervour in virtue some people
thought her mad and declared that something should be done for her head.
She replied in the words of the apostle, “we are made a spectacle unto
the world and to angels and to men,” <span
id="fr_2930"></span>[2931](#fn_2930.md) and “we are fools for Christ’s
sake” <span id="fr_2931"></span>[2932](#fn_2931.md) but “the foolishness of
God is wiser than men.” <span id="fr_2932"></span>[2933](#fn_2932.md) It is
for this reason she said that even the Saviour says to the Father, “Thou
knowest my foolishness,” <span id="fr_2933"></span>[2934](#fn_2933.md) and
again “I am as a wonder unto many, but thou art my strong refuge.” <span
id="fr_2934"></span>[2935](#fn_2934.md) “I was as a beast before thee;
nevertheless I am continually with thee.” <span
id="fr_2935"></span>[2936](#fn_2935.md) In the gospel we read that even His
kinsfolk desired to bind Him as one of weak mind. <span
id="fr_2936"></span>[2937](#fn_2936.md) His opponents also reviled him
saying “thou art a Samaritan and hast a devil,” <span
id="fr_2937"></span>[2938](#fn_2937.md) and another time “he casteth out
devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.” <span
id="fr_2938"></span>[2939](#fn_2938.md) But let us, she continued, listen
to the exhortation of the apostle, “Our rejoicing is this, the testimony
of our conscience that in simplicity and sincerity…by the grace of God
we have had our conversation in the world.” <span
id="fr_2939"></span>[2940](#fn_2939.md) And let us hear the Lord when He
says to His apostles, “If ye were of the world the world would love his
own; but because ye are not of the world…therefore the world hateth
you.” <span id="fr_2940"></span>[2941](#fn_2940.md) And then she turned to
the Lord Himself, saying, “Thou knowest the secrets of the heart,” <span
id="fr_2941"></span>[2942](#fn_2941.md) and “all this is come upon us; yet
have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy
covenant; our heart is not turned back.” <span
id="fr_2942"></span>[2943](#fn_2942.md) “Yea for thy sake are we killed all
the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.” <span
id="fr_2943"></span>[2944](#fn_2943.md) But “the Lord is on my side: I will
not fear what man doeth unto me.” <span
id="fr_2944"></span>[2945](#fn_2944.md) She had read the words of Solomon,
“My son, honour the Lord and thou shalt be made strong; and beside the
Lord fear thou no man.” <span id="fr_2945"></span>[2946](#fn_2945.md) These
passages and others like them she used as God’s armour against the
assaults of wickedness, and particularly to defend herself against the
furious onslaughts of envy; and thus by patiently enduring wrongs she
soothed the violence of the most savage breasts. Down to the very <span
id="page_206">p. 206</span> <span id="v.CVIII-Page_206"></span>day of
her death two things were conspicuous in her life, one her great
patience and the other the jealousy which was manifested towards her.
Now jealousy gnaws the heart of him who harbours it: and while it
strives to injure its rival raves with all the force of its fury against
itself.

<span id="v.CVIII-p248"></span>20. I shall now describe the order of her
monastery and the method by which she turned the continence of saintly
souls to her own profit. She sowed carnal things that she might reap
spiritual things; <span id="fr_2946"></span>[2947](#fn_2946.md) she gave
earthly things that she might receive heavenly things; she forewent
things temporal that she might in their stead obtain things eternal.
Besides establishing a monastery for men, the charge of which she left
to men, she divided into three companies and monasteries the numerous
virgins whom she had gathered out of different provinces, some of whom
are of noble birth while others belonged to the middle or lower classes.
But, although they worked and had their meals separately from each
other, these three companies met together for psalm-singing and prayer.
After the chanting of the Alleluia—the signal by which they were
summoned to the Collect <span id="fr_2947"></span>[2948](#fn_2947.md) —no
one was permitted to remain behind. But either first or among the first
Paula used to await the arrival of the rest, urging them to diligence
rather by her own modest example than by motives of fear. At dawn, at
the third, sixth, and ninth hours, at evening, and at midnight they
recited the psalter each in turn. <span
id="fr_2948"></span>[2949](#fn_2948.md) No sister was allowed to be
ignorant of the psalms, and all had every day to learn a certain portion
of the holy scriptures. On the Lord’s day only they proceeded to the
church beside which they lived, each company following its own
mother-superior. Returning home in the same order, they then devoted
themselves to their allotted tasks, and made garments either for
themselves or else for others. If a virgin was of noble birth, she was
not allowed to have an attendant belonging to her own household lest her
maid having her mind full of the doings of old days and of the license
of childhood might by constant converse open old wounds and renew former
errors. All the sisters were clothed alike. Linen was not used except
for drying the hands. So strictly did Paula separate them from men that
she would not allow even eunuchs to approach them; lest she should give
occasion to slanderous tongues (always ready to cavil at the religious)
to console themselves for their own misdoing. When a sister was backward
in coming to the recitation of the psalms or shewed herself remiss in
her work, Paula used to approach her in different ways. Was she
quick-tempered? Paula coaxed her. Was she phlegmatic? Paula chid her,
copying the example of the apostle who said: “What will ye? Shall I come
to you with a rod or in love and in the spirit of meekness?” <span
id="fr_2949"></span>[2950](#fn_2949.md) Apart from food and raiment she
allowed no one to have anything she could call her own, for Paul had
said, “Having food and raiment let us be therewith content.” <span
id="fr_2950"></span>[2951](#fn_2950.md) She was afraid lest the custom of
having more should breed covetousness in them; an appetite which no
wealth can satisfy, for the more it has the more it requires, and
neither opulence nor indigence is able to diminish it. <span
id="fr_2951"></span>[2952](#fn_2951.md) When the sisters quarrelled one
with another she reconciled them with soothing words. If the younger
ones were troubled with fleshly desires, she broke their force by
imposing redoubled fasts; for she wished her virgins to be ill in body
rather than to suffer in soul. If she chanced to notice any sister too
attentive to her dress, she reproved her for her error with knitted
brows and severe looks, saying; “a clean body and a clean dress mean an
unclean soul. A virgin’s lips should never utter an improper or an
impure word, for such indicate a lascivious mind and by the outward man
the faults of the inward are made manifest.” When she saw a sister
verbose and talkative or forward and taking pleasure in quarrels, and
when she found after frequent admonitions that the offender shewed no
signs of improvement; she placed her among the lowest of the sisters and
outside their society, ordering her to pray at the door of the refectory
instead of with the rest, and commanding her to take her food by
herself, in the hope that where rebuke had failed shame might bring
about a reformation. The sin of theft she loathed as if it were
sacrilege; and that which among men of the world is counted little or
nothing she declared to be in a monastery a crime of the deepest dye.
How shall I describe her kindness and attention towards the sick or the
wonderful care and devotion with which she nursed them? Yet, although
when others were sick she freely gave them every indulgence, and even
allowed them to eat meat; when she fell ill herself, she made no
concessions to her own weakness, and seemed unfairly to change in her
own case to harshness the kindness which she was always ready to shew to
others.

<span id="v.CVIII-p255"></span>21. No young girl of sound and vigorous
constitution could have delivered herself up to a regimen so rigid as
that imposed upon <span id="page_207">p. 207</span> <span
id="v.CVIII-Page_207"></span>herself by Paula whose physical powers age
had impaired and enfeebled. I admit that in this she was too determined,
refusing to spare herself or to listen to advice. I will relate what I
know to be a fact. In the extreme heat of the month of July she was once
attacked by a violent fever and we despaired of her life. However by
God’s mercy she rallied, and the doctors urged upon her the necessity of
taking a little light wine to accelerate her recovery; saying that if
she continued to drink water they feared that she might become
dropsical. I on my side secretly appealed to the blessed pope Epiphanius
to admonish, nay even to compel her, to take the wine. But she with her
usual sagacity and quickness at once perceived the stratagem, and with a
smile let him see that the advice he was giving her was after all not
his but mine. Not to waste more words, the blessed prelate after many
exhortations left her chamber; and, when I asked him what he had
accomplished, replied, “Only this that old as I am I have been almost
persuaded to drink no more wine.” I relate this story not because I
approve of persons rashly taking upon themselves burthens beyond their
strength (for does not the scripture say: “Burden not thyself above thy
power”? <span id="fr_2952"></span>[2953](#fn_2952) .md) but because I wish
from this quality of perseverance in her to shew the passion of her mind
and the yearning of her believing soul; both of which made her sing in
David’s words, “My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth after
thee.” <span id="fr_2953"></span>[2954](#fn_2953.md) Difficult as it is
always to avoid extremes, the philosophers <span
id="fr_2954"></span>[2955](#fn_2954.md) are quite right in their opinion
that virtue is a mean and vice an excess, or as we may express it in one
short sentence “In nothing too much.” <span
id="fr_2955"></span>[2956](#fn_2955.md) While thus unyielding in her
contempt for food Paula was easily moved to sorrow and felt crushed by
the deaths of her kinsfolk, especially those of her children. When one
after another her husband and her daughters fell asleep, on each
occasion the shock of their loss endangered her life. And although she
signed her mouth and her breast with the sign of the cross, and
endeavoured thus to alleviate a mother’s grief; her feelings overpowered
her and her maternal instincts were too much for her confiding mind.
Thus while her intellect retained its mastery she was overcome by sheer
physical weakness. On one occasion a sickness seized her and clung to
her so long that it brought anxiety to us and danger to herself. Yet
even then she was full of joy and repeated every moment the apostle’s
words: “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of
this death?” <span id="fr_2956"></span>[2957](#fn_2956.md)

<span id="v.CVIII-p261"></span>The careful reader may say that my words
are an invective rather than an eulogy. I call that Jesus whom she
served and whom I desire to serve to be my witness that so far from
unduly eulogizing her or depreciating her I tell the truth about her as
one Christian writing of another; that I am writing a memoir and not a
panegyric, and that what were faults in her might well be virtues in
others less saintly. I speak thus of her faults to satisfy my own
feelings and the passionate regret of us her brothers and sisters, who
all of us love her still and all of us deplore her loss.

<span id="v.CVIII-p262"></span>22. However, she has finished her course,
she has kept the faith, and now she enjoys the crown of
righteousness. <span id="fr_2957"></span>[2958](#fn_2957.md) She follows
the Lamb whithersoever he goes. <span
id="fr_2958"></span>[2959](#fn_2958.md) She is filled now because once she
was hungry. <span id="fr_2959"></span>[2960](#fn_2959.md) With joy does she
sing: “as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of
hosts, in the city of our God.” <span
id="fr_2960"></span>[2961](#fn_2960.md) O blessed change! Once she wept but
now laughs for evermore. Once she despised the broken cisterns of which
the prophet speaks; <span id="fr_2961"></span>[2962](#fn_2961.md) but now
she has found in the Lord a fountain of life. <span
id="fr_2962"></span>[2963](#fn_2962.md) Once she wore haircloth but now she
is clothed in white raiment, and can say: “thou hast put off my
sackcloth, and girded me with gladness.” <span
id="fr_2963"></span>[2964](#fn_2963.md) Once she ate ashes like bread and
mingled her drink with weeping; <span
id="fr_2964"></span>[2965](#fn_2964.md) saying “my tears have been my meat
day and night;” <span id="fr_2965"></span>[2966](#fn_2965.md) but now for
all time she eats the bread of angels <span
id="fr_2966"></span>[2967](#fn_2966.md) and sings: “O taste and see that
the Lord is good;” <span id="fr_2967"></span>[2968](#fn_2967.md) and “my
heart is overflowing with a goodly matter; I speak the things which I
have made touching the king.” <span id="fr_2968"></span>[2969](#fn_2968.md)
She now sees fulfilled Isaiah’s words, or rather those of the Lord
speaking through Isaiah: “Behold, my servants shall eat but ye shall be
hungry: behold, my servants shall drink but ye shall be thirsty: behold,
my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed: behold, my servants
shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and
shall howl for vexation of spirit.” <span
id="fr_2969"></span>[2970](#fn_2969.md) I have said that she always shunned
the broken cisterns: she did so that she might find in the Lord a
fountain of life, and that she might rejoice and sing: “as the hart
panteth after the waterbrooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God.
When shall I come and appear before God?” <span
id="fr_2970"></span>[2971](#fn_2970.md)

<span id="v.CVIII-p277"></span>23. I must briefly mention the manner in
which she avoided the foul cisterns of the heretics whom she regarded as
no better than heathen. A certain cunning knave, in his own estimation
both learned and clever, began with<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>
<span id="v.CVIII-Page_208"></span>out my knowledge to put to her such
questions as these: What sin has an infant committed that it should be
seized by the devil? Shall we be young or old when we rise again? If we
die young and rise young, we shall after the resurrection require to
have nurses. If however we die young and rise old, the dead will not
rise again at all: they will be transformed into new beings. Will there
be a distinction of sexes in the next world? Or will there be no such
distinction? If the distinction continues, there will be wedlock and
sexual intercourse and procreation of children. If however it does not
continue, the bodies that rise again will not be the same. For, he
argued, “the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon
many things,” <span id="fr_2971"></span>[2972](#fn_2971.md) but the bodies
that we shall have in heaven will be subtle and spiritual according to
the words of the apostle: “it is sown a natural body: it is raised a
spiritual body.” <span id="fr_2972"></span>[2973](#fn_2972.md) From all of
which considerations he sought to prove that rational creatures have
been for their faults and previous sins subjected to bodily conditions;
and that according to the nature and guilt of their transgression they
are born in this or that state of life. Some, he said, rejoice in sound
bodies and wealthy and noble parents; others have for their portion
diseased frames and poverty stricken homes; and by imprisonment in the
present world and in bodies pay the penalty of their former sins. Paula
listened and reported what she heard to me, at the same time pointing
out the man. Thus upon me was laid the task of opposing this most
noxious viper and deadly pest. It is of such that the Psalmist speaks
when he writes: “deliver not the soul of thy turtle dove unto the wild
beast,” <span id="fr_2973"></span>[2974](#fn_2973.md) and “Rebuke the wild
beast of the reeds;” <span id="fr_2974"></span>[2975](#fn_2974.md)
creatures who write iniquity and speak lies against the Lord and lift up
their mouths against the Most High. As the fellow had tried to deceive
Paula, I at her request went to him, and by asking him a few questions
involved him in a dilemma. Do you believe, said I, that there will be a
resurrection of the dead or do you disbelieve? He replied, I believe. I
went on: Will the bodies that rise again be the same or different? He
said, The same. Then I asked: What of their sex? Will that remain
unaltered or will it be changed? At this question he became silent and
swayed his head this way and that as a serpent does to avoid being
struck. Accordingly I continued, As you have nothing to say I will
answer for you and will draw the conclusion from your premises. If the
woman shall not rise again as a woman nor the man as a man, there will
be no resurrection of the dead. For the body is made up of sex and
members. But if there shall be no sex and no members what will become of
the resurrection of the body, which cannot exist without sex and
members? And if there shall be no resurrection of the body, there can be
no resurrection of the dead. But as to your objection taken from
marriage, that, if the members shall remain the same, marriage must
inevitably be allowed; it is disposed of by the Saviour’s words: “ye do
err not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God. For in the
resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the
angels.” <span id="fr_2975"></span>[2976](#fn_2975.md) When it is said that
they neither marry nor are given in marriage, the distinction of sex is
shewn to persist. For no one says of things which have no capacity for
marriage such as a stick or a stone that they neither marry nor are
given in marriage; but this may well be said of those who while they can
marry yet abstain from doing so by their own virtue and by the grace of
Christ. But if you cavil at this and say, how shall we in that case be
like the angels with whom there is neither male nor female, hear my
answer in brief as follows. What the Lord promises to us is not the
nature of angels but their mode of life and their bliss. And therefore
John the Baptist is called an angel <span
id="fr_2976"></span>[2977](#fn_2976.md) even before he is beheaded, and all
God’s holy men and virgins manifest in themselves even in this world the
life of angels. When it is said “ye shall be like the angels,” likeness
only is promised and not a change of nature.

<span id="v.CVIII-p284"></span>24. And now do you in your turn answer me
these questions. How do you explain the fact that Thomas felt the hands
of the risen Lord and beheld His side pierced by the spear? <span
id="fr_2977"></span>[2978](#fn_2977.md) And the fact that Peter saw the
Lord standing on the shore <span id="fr_2978"></span>[2979](#fn_2978.md)
and eating a piece of a roasted fish and a honeycomb. <span
id="fr_2979"></span>[2980](#fn_2979.md) If He stood, He must certainly have
had feet. If He pointed to His wounded side He must have also had chest
and belly for to these the sides are attached and without them they
cannot be. If He spoke, He must have used a tongue and palate and teeth.
For as the bow strikes the strings, so to produce vocal sound does the
tongue come in contact with the teeth. If His hands were felt, it
follows that He must have had arms as well. Since therefore it is
admitted that He had all the members which go to make up the body, He
must have also had the whole body formed of them, and that not a woman’s
but a man’s; that is to say, He rose again in the sex in which He died.
And if you cavil farther and say: We shall eat <span id="page_209">p.
209</span> <span id="v.CVIII-Page_209"></span>then, I suppose, after the
resurrection; or How can a solid and material body enter in contrary to
its nature through closed doors? you shall receive from me this reply.
Do not for this matter of food find fault with belief in the
resurrection: for our Lord after raising the daughter of the ruler of
the synagogue commanded food to be given her. <span
id="fr_2980"></span>[2981](#fn_2980.md) And Lazarus who had been dead four
days is described as sitting at meat with Him, <span
id="fr_2981"></span>[2982](#fn_2981.md) the object in both cases being to
shew that the resurrection was real and not merely apparent. And if from
our Lord’s entering in through closed doors <span
id="fr_2982"></span>[2983](#fn_2982.md) you strive to prove that His body
was spiritual and aerial, He must have had this spiritual body even
before He suffered; since—contrary to the nature of heavy bodies—He was
able to walk upon the sea. <span id="fr_2983"></span>[2984](#fn_2983.md)
The apostle Peter also must be believed to have had a spiritual body for
he also walked upon the waters with buoyant step. <span
id="fr_2984"></span>[2985](#fn_2984.md) The true explanation is that when
anything is done against nature, it is a manifestation of God’s might
and power. And to shew plainly that in these great signs our attention
is asked not to a change in nature but to the almighty power of God, he
who by faith had walked on water began to sink for the want of it and
would have done so had not the Lord lifted him up with the reproving
words, “O thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt?” <span
id="fr_2985"></span>[2986](#fn_2985.md) I wonder that you can display such
effrontery when the Lord Himself said, “reach hither thy finger, and
behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side:
and be not faithless but believing,” <span
id="fr_2986"></span>[2987](#fn_2986.md) and in another place, “behold my
hands and my feet that it is I myself: handle me and see; for a spirit
hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have. And when he had thus spoken
he shewed them his hands and his feet.” <span
id="fr_2987"></span>[2988](#fn_2987.md) You hear Him speak of bones and
flesh, of feet and hands; and yet you want to palm off on me the bubbles
and airy nothings of which the stoics rave! <span
id="fr_2988"></span>[2989](#fn_2988.md)

<span id="v.CVIII-p297"></span>25. Moreover, if you ask how it is that a
mere infant which has never sinned is seized by the devil, or at what
age we shall rise again seeing that we die at different ages; my only
answer—an unwelcome one, I fancy—will be in the words of scripture: “The
judgments of God are a great deep,” <span
id="fr_2989"></span>[2990](#fn_2989.md) and “O the depth of the riches both
of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments,
and his ways past finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord?
or who hath been his counsellor?” <span
id="fr_2990"></span>[2991](#fn_2990.md) No difference of age can affect the
reality of the body. Although our frames are in a perpetual flux and
lose or gain daily, these changes do not make us different individuals.
I was not one person at ten years old, another at thirty and another at
fifty; nor am I another now when all my head is gray. <span
id="fr_2991"></span>[2992](#fn_2991.md) According to the traditions of the
church and the teaching of the apostle Paul, the answer must be this;
that we shall rise as perfect men in the measure of the stature of the
fulness of Christ. <span id="fr_2992"></span>[2993](#fn_2992.md) At this
age the Jews suppose Adam to have been created and at this age we read
that the Lord and Saviour rose again. Many other arguments did I adduce
from both testaments to stifle the outcry of this heretic.

<span id="v.CVIII-p302"></span>26. From that day forward so profoundly
did Paula commence to loathe the man—and all who agreed with him in his
doctrines—that she publicly proclaimed them as enemies of the Lord. I
have related this incident less with the design of confuting in a few
words a heresy which would require volumes to confute it, than with the
object of shewing the great faith of this saintly woman who preferred to
subject herself to perpetual hostility from men rather than by
friendships hurtful to herself to provoke or to offend God.

<span id="v.CVIII-p303"></span>27. To revert then to that description of
her character which I began a little time ago; no mind was ever more
docile than was hers. She was slow to speak and swift to hear, <span
id="fr_2993"></span>[2994](#fn_2993.md) remembering the precept, “Keep
silence and hearken, O Israel.” <span
id="fr_2994"></span>[2995](#fn_2994.md) The holy scriptures she knew by
heart, and said of the history contained in them that it was the
foundation of the truth; but, though she loved even this, she still
preferred to seek for the underlying spiritual meaning and made this the
keystone of the spiritual building raised within her soul. She asked
leave that she and her daughter might read over the old and new
testaments <span id="fr_2995"></span>[2996](#fn_2995.md) under my guidance.
Out of modesty I at first refused compliance, but as she persisted in
her demand and frequently urged me to consent to it, I at last did so
and taught her what I had learned not from myself—for self-confidence is
the worst of teachers—but from the church’s most famous writers.
Wherever I stuck fast and honestly confessed myself at fault she would
by no means rest content but would force me by fresh questions to point
out to her which of many different solutions seemed to me the most
probable. I will mention here another fact which to those who are
envious may well seem incredible. While I myself beginning as a young
man have with much toil and effort partially acquired the Hebrew tongue
and study it now unceas<span id="page_210">p. 210</span> <span
id="v.CVIII-Page_210"></span>ingly lest if I leave it, it also may leave
me; Paula, on making up her mind that she too would learn it, succeeded
so well that she could chant the psalms in Hebrew and could speak the
language without a trace of the pronunciation peculiar to Latin. The
same accomplishment can be seen to this day in her daughter Eustochium,
who always kept close to her mother’s side, obeyed all her commands,
never slept apart from her, never walked abroad or took a meal without
her, never had a penny that she could call her own, rejoiced when her
mother gave to the poor her little patrimony, and fully believed that in
filial affection she had the best heritage and the truest riches. I must
not pass over in silence the joy which Paula felt when she heard her
little granddaughter and namesake, the child of Laeta and Toxotius—who
was born and I may even say conceived in answer to a vow of her parents
dedicating her to virginity—when, I say, she heard the little one in her
cradle sing “alleluia” and falter out the words “grandmother” and
“aunt.” One wish alone made her long to see her native land again; that
she might know her son and his wife and child <span
id="fr_2996"></span>[2997](#fn_2996.md) to have renounced the world and to
be serving Christ. And it has been granted to her in part. For while her
granddaughter is destined to take the veil, her daughter-in-law has
vowed herself to perpetual chastity, and by faith and alms emulates the
example that her mother has set her. She strives to exhibit at Rome the
virtues which Paula set forth in all their fulness at Jerusalem.

<span id="v.CVIII-p308"></span>28. What ails thee, my soul? Why dost
thou shudder to approach her death? I have made my letter longer than it
should be already; dreading to come to the end and vainly supposing that
by saying nothing of it and by occupying myself with her praises I could
postpone the evil day. Hitherto the wind has been all in my favour and
my keel has smoothly ploughed through the heaving waves. But now my
speech is running upon the rocks, the billows are mountains high, and
imminent shipwreck awaits both you and me. We must needs cry out:
“Master; save us we perish:” <span id="fr_2997"></span>[2998](#fn_2997.md)
and “awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord?” <span
id="fr_2998"></span>[2999](#fn_2998.md) For who could tell the tale of
Paula’s dying with dry eyes? She fell into a most serious illness and
thus gained what she most desired, power to leave us and to be joined
more fully to the Lord. Eustochium’s affection for her mother, always
true and tried, in this time of sickness approved itself still more to
all. She sat by Paula’s bedside, she fanned her, she supported her head,
she arranged her pillows, she chafed her feet, she rubbed her stomach,
she smoothed down the bedclothes, she heated hot water, she brought
towels. In fact she anticipated the servants in all their duties, and
when one of them did anything she regarded it as so much taken away from
her own gain. How unceasingly she prayed, how copiously she wept, how
constantly she ran to and fro between her prostrate mother and the cave
of the Lord! imploring God that she might not be deprived of a companion
so dear, that if Paula was to die she might herself no longer live, and
that one bier might carry to burial her and her mother. Alas for the
frailty and perishableness of human nature! Except that our belief in
Christ raises us up to heaven and promises eternity to our souls, the
physical conditions of life are the same for us as for the brutes.
“There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and
to the evil; to the clean and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth
and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good so is the sinner; and he
that sweareth as he that feareth an oath.” <span
id="fr_2999"></span>[3000](#fn_2999.md) Man and beast alike are dissolved
into dust and ashes.

<span id="v.CVIII-p312"></span>29. Why do I still linger, and prolong my
suffering by postponing it? Paula’s intelligence shewed her that her
death was near. Her body and limbs grew cold and only in her holy breast
did the warm beat of the living soul continue. Yet, as though she were
leaving strangers to go home to her own people, she whispered the verses
of the psalmist: “Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house and the
place where thine honour dwelleth,” <span
id="fr_3000"></span>[3001](#fn_3000.md) and “How amiable are thy
tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! My soul longeth yea even fainteth for the
courts of the Lord,” <span id="fr_3001"></span>[3002](#fn_3001.md) and “I
had rather be an outcast in the house of my God than to dwell in the
tents of wickedness.” <span id="fr_3002"></span>[3003](#fn_3002.md) When I
asked her why she remained silent refusing to answer my call, <span
id="fr_3003"></span>[3004](#fn_3003.md) and whether she was in pain, she
replied in Greek that she had no suffering and that all things were to
her eyes calm and tranquil. After this she said no more but closed her
eyes as though she already despised all mortal things, and kept
repeating the verses just quoted down to the moment in which she
breathed out her soul, but in a tone so low that we could scarcely hear
what she said. Raising her finger also to her mouth she made the sign of
the cross upon her lips. Then her breath failed her and she gasped for
death; yet even when her soul was eager to break free, she turned the
death-rattle (which comes <span id="page_211">p. 211</span> <span
id="v.CVIII-Page_211"></span>at last to all) into the praise of the
Lord. The bishop of Jerusalem and some from other cities were present,
also a great number of the inferior clergy, both priests and
levites. <span id="fr_3004"></span>[3005](#fn_3004.md) The entire monastery
was filled with bodies of virgins and monks. As soon as Paula heard the
bridegroom saying: “Rise up my love my fair one, my dove, and come away:
for, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone,” she answered
joyfully “the flowers appear on the earth; the time to cut them has
come” <span id="fr_3005"></span>[3006](#fn_3005.md) and “I believe that I
shall see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living.” <span
id="fr_3006"></span>[3007](#fn_3006.md)

<span id="v.CVIII-p320"></span>30. No weeping or lamentation followed
her death, such as are the custom of the world; but all present united
in chanting the psalms in their several tongues. The bishops lifted up
the dead woman with their own hands, placed her upon a bier, and
carrying her on their shoulders to the church in the cave of the
Saviour, laid her down in the centre of it. Other bishops meantime
carried torches and tapers in the procession, and yet others led the
singing of the choirs. The whole population of the cities of Palestine
came to her funeral. Not a single monk lurked in the desert or lingered
in his cell. Not a single virgin remained shut up in the seclusion of
her chamber. To each and all it would have seemed sacrilege to have
withheld the last tokens of respect from a woman so saintly. As in the
case of Dorcas, <span id="fr_3007"></span>[3008](#fn_3007.md) the widows
and the poor shewed the garments Paula had given them; while the
destitute cried aloud that they had lost in her a mother and a nurse.
Strange to say, the paleness of death had not altered her expression;
only a certain solemnity and seriousness had overspread her features.
You would have thought her not dead but asleep.

<span id="v.CVIII-p322"></span>One after another they chanted the
psalms, now in Greek, now in Latin, now in Syriac; and this not merely
for the three days which elapsed before she was buried beneath the
church and close to the cave of the Lord, but throughout the remainder
of the week. All who were assembled felt that it was their own funeral
at which they were assisting, and shed tears as if they themselves had
died. Paula’s daughter, the revered virgin Eustochium, “as a child that
is weaned of his mother,” <span id="fr_3008"></span>[3009](#fn_3008.md)
could not be torn away from her parent. She kissed her eyes, pressed her
lips upon her brow, embraced her frame, and wished for nothing better
than to be buried with her.

<span id="v.CVIII-p324"></span>31. Jesus is witness that Paula has left
not a single penny to her daughter but, as I said before, on the
contrary a large mass of debt; and, worse even than this, a crowd of
brothers and sisters whom it is hard for her to support but whom it
would be undutiful to cast off. Could there be a more splendid instance
of self-renunciation than that of this noble lady who in the fervour of
her faith gave away so much of her wealth that she reduced herself to
the last degree of poverty? Others may boast, if they will, of money
spent in charity, of large sums heaped up in God’s treasury, <span
id="fr_3009"></span>[3010](#fn_3009.md) of votive offerings hung up with
cords of gold. None of them has given more to the poor than Paula, for
Paula has kept nothing for herself. But now she enjoys the true riches
and those good things which eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither
have they entered into the heart of man. <span
id="fr_3010"></span>[3011](#fn_3010.md) If we mourn, it is for ourselves
and not for her; yet even so, if we persist in weeping for one who
reigns with Christ, we shall seem to envy her her glory.

<span id="v.CVIII-p327"></span>32. Be not fearful, Eustochium: you are
endowed with a splendid heritage. The Lord is your portion; and, to
increase your joy, your mother has now after a long martyrdom won her
crown. It is not only the shedding of blood that is accounted a
confession: the spotless service of a devout mind is itself a daily
martyrdom. Both alike are crowned; with roses and violets in the one
case, with lilies in the other. Thus in the Song of Songs it is written:
“my beloved is white and ruddy;” <span
id="fr_3011"></span>[3012](#fn_3011.md) for, whether the victory be won in
peace or in war, God gives the same guerdon to those who win it. Like
Abraham your mother heard the words: “get thee out of thy country, and
from thy kindred, unto a land that I will shew thee;” <span
id="fr_3012"></span>[3013](#fn_3012.md) and not only that but the Lord’s
command given through Jeremiah: “flee out of the midst of Babylon, and
deliver every man his soul.” <span id="fr_3013"></span>[3014](#fn_3013.md)
To the day of her death she never returned to Chaldæa, or regretted the
fleshpots of Egypt or its strong-smelling meats. Accompanied by her
virgin bands she became a fellow-citizen of the Saviour; and now that
she has ascended from her little Bethlehem to the heavenly realms she
can say to the true Naomi: “thy people shall be my people and thy God my
God.” <span id="fr_3014"></span>[3015](#fn_3014.md)

<span id="v.CVIII-p332"></span>33. I have spent the labour of two nights
in dictating for you this treatise; and in doing so I have felt a grief
as deep as your own. I say in ‘dictating’ for I have not been able to
write it myself. As often as I have taken up my pen <span
id="fr_3015"></span>[3016](#fn_3015.md) and have tried to fulfil my
promise; my fingers have stiffened, my hand has fallen, and my power
over it has vanished. The rudeness of the diction, devoid as it is of
all <span id="page_212">p. 212</span> <span
id="v.CVIII-Page_212"></span>elegance or charm, bears witness to the
feeling of the writer.

<span id="v.CVIII-p334"></span>34. And now, Paula, farewell, and aid
with your prayers the old age of your votary. Your faith and your works
unite you to Christ; thus standing in His presence you will the more
readily gain what you ask. In this letter “I have built” to your memory
“a monument more lasting than bronze,” <span
id="fr_3016"></span>[3017](#fn_3016.md) which no lapse of time will be able
to destroy. And I have cut an inscription on your tomb, which I here
subjoin; that, wherever my narrative may go, the reader may learn that
you are buried at Bethlehem and not uncommemorated there.

<span id="v.CVIII-p336"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="v.CVIII-p336.1"></span>The Inscription on Paula’s Tomb.</span>

<span id="v.CVIII-p337"></span>Within this tomb a child of Scipio lies,

<span id="v.CVIII-p338"></span>A daughter of the farfamed Pauline house,

<span id="v.CVIII-p339"></span>A scion of the Gracchi, of the stock

<span id="v.CVIII-p340"></span>Of Agamemnon’s self, illustrious:

<span id="v.CVIII-p341"></span>Here rests the lady Paula, well-beloved

<span id="v.CVIII-p342"></span>Of both her parents, with Eustochium

<span id="v.CVIII-p343"></span>For daughter; she the first of Roman
dames

<span id="v.CVIII-p344"></span>Who hardship chose and Bethlehem for
Christ.

<span id="v.CVIII-p345"></span>In front of the cavern there is another
inscription as follows:—

<span id="v.CVIII-p346"></span>Seest thou here hollowed in the rock a
grave,

<span id="v.CVIII-p347"></span>’Tis Paula’s tomb; high heaven has her
soul.

<span id="v.CVIII-p348"></span>Who Rome and friends, riches and home
forsook

<span id="v.CVIII-p349"></span>Here in this lonely spot to find her
rest.

<span id="v.CVIII-p350"></span>For here Christ’s manger was, and here
the kings

<span id="v.CVIII-p351"></span>To Him, both God and man, their offerings
made.

<span id="v.CVIII-p352"></span>35. The holy and blessed Paula fell
asleep on the seventh day before the Kalends of February, on the third
day of the week, after the sun had set. She was buried on the fifth day
before the same Kalends, in the sixth consulship of the Emperor Honorius
and the first of Aristænetus. She lived in the vows of religion five
years at Rome and twenty years at Bethlehem. The whole duration of her
life was fifty-six years eight months and twenty-one days.
