<span id="v.LII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.LII-p1.1"></span>Letter LII. To Nepotian.</span>

<span id="v.LII-p2"></span>Nepotian, the nephew of Heliodorus (for whom
see Letter XIV.), had, like his uncle, abandoned the military for the
clerical calling, and was now a presbyter at Altinum, where Heliodorus
was bishop. The letter is a systematic treatise on the duties of the
clergy and on the rule of life which they ought to adopt. It had a great
vogue, and called forth much indignation against Jerome. Its date is 394
<span class="c17"><span id="v.LII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.LII-p3"></span>1. Again and again you ask me, my dear
Nepotian, in your letters from over the sea, to draw for you a few rules
of life, showing how one who has renounced the service of the world to
become a monk or a clergyman may keep the straight path of Christ, and
not be drawn aside into the haunts of vice. As a young man, or rather as
a boy, and while I was curbing by the hard life of the desert the first
onslaughts of youthful passion, I sent a letter of remonstrance <span
id="fr_1313"></span>[1314](#fn_1313.md) to your reverend uncle, Heliodorus,
which, by the tears and complainings with which it was filled, showed
him the feelings of the friend whom he had deserted. In it I acted the
part suited to my age, and as I was still aglow with the methods and
maxims of the rhetoricians, I decked it out a good deal with the
flourishes of the schools. Now, however, my head is gray, my brow is
furrowed, a dewlap like that of an ox hangs from my chin, and, as Virgil
says,

<span id="v.LII-p5"></span>The chilly blood stands still around my
heart. <span id="fr_1314"></span>[1315](#fn_1314.md)

<span id="v.LII-p7"></span>Elsewhere he sings:

<span id="v.LII-p8"></span>Old age bears all, even the mind, away.

<span id="v.LII-p9"></span>And a little further on:

<span id="v.LII-p10"></span>So many of my songs are gone from me,

<span id="v.LII-p11"></span>And even my very voice has left me
now. <span id="fr_1315"></span>[1316](#fn_1315.md)

<span id="v.LII-p13"></span>2. But that I may not seem to quote only
profane literature, listen to the mystical teaching of the sacred
writings. Once David had been a man of war, but at seventy age had
chilled him so that nothing would make him warm. A girl is accordingly
sought from the coasts of Israel—Abishag the Shunamite—to sleep with the
king and warm his aged frame. <span id="fr_1316"></span>[1317](#fn_1316.md)
Does it not seem to you—if you keep to the letter that killeth <span
id="fr_1317"></span>[1318](#fn_1317.md) —like some farcical story or some
broad jest from an Atellan play? <span
id="fr_1318"></span>[1319](#fn_1318.md) A chilly old man is wrapped up in
blankets, and only grows warm in a girl’s embrace. Bathsheba was still
living, Abigail was still left, and the remainder of those wives and
concubines whose names the Scripture mentions. Yet they are all rejected
as cold, and only in the one young girl’s embrace does the old man
become warm. Abraham was far older than David; still, so long as Sarah
lived he sought no other wife. Isaac counted twice the years of David,
yet never felt cold with Rebekah, old though she was. I say nothing of
the antediluvians, who, although after nine hundred years their limbs
must have been not old merely, but decayed with age, had no recourse to
girls’ embraces. Moses, the leader of the Israelites, counted <span
id="page_90">p. 90</span> <span id="v.LII-Page_90"></span>one hundred
and twenty years, yet sought no change from Zipporah.

<span id="v.LII-p17"></span>3. Who, then, is this Shunamite, this wife
and maid, so glowing as to warm the cold, yet so holy as not to arouse
passion in him whom she warmed? <span
id="fr_1319"></span>[1320](#fn_1319.md) Let Solomon, wisest of men, tell us
of his father’s favorite; let the man of peace <span
id="fr_1320"></span>[1321](#fn_1320.md) recount to us the embraces of the
man of war. <span id="fr_1321"></span>[1322](#fn_1321.md) “Get wisdom,” he
writes, “get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the
words of my mouth. Forsake her not and she shall preserve thee: love her
and she shall keep thee. Wisdom is the principal thing, therefore get
wisdom, and with all thy getting get understanding. Exalt her and she
shall promote thee. She shall bring thee to honor when thou dost embrace
her. She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory
shall she deliver to thee.” <span id="fr_1322"></span>[1323](#fn_1322.md)

<span id="v.LII-p22"></span>Almost all bodily excellences alter with
age, and while wisdom alone increases all things else decay. Fasts and
vigils and almsdeeds become harder. So also do sleeping on the ground,
moving from place to place, hospitality to travellers, pleading for the
poor, earnestness and steadfastness in prayer, the visitation of the
sick, manual labor to supply money for alms-giving. All acts, in short,
of which the body is the medium decrease with its decay.

<span id="v.LII-p23"></span>Now, there are young men still full of life
and vigor who, by toil and burning zeal, as well as by holiness of life
and constant prayer to the Lord Jesus, have obtained knowledge. I do not
speak of these, or say that in them the love of wisdom is cold, for this
withers in many of the old by reason of age. What I mean is that youth,
as such, has to cope with the assaults of passion, and amid the
allurements of vice and the tinglings of the flesh is stifled like a
fire among green boughs, and cannot develop its proper brightness. But
when men have employed their youth in commendable pursuits and have
meditated on the law of the Lord day and night, <span
id="fr_1323"></span>[1324](#fn_1323.md) they learn with the lapse of time,
fresh experience and wisdom come as the years go by, and so from the
pursuits of the past their old age reaps a harvest of delight. Hence
that wise man of Greece, Themistocles, <span
id="fr_1324"></span>[1325](#fn_1324.md) perceiving, after the expiration of
one hundred and seven years, that he was on the verge of the grave, is
reported to have said that he regretted extremely having to leave life
just when he was beginning to grow wise. Plato died in his eighty-first
year, his pen still in his hand. Isocrates completed ninety years and
nine in the midst of literary and scholastic work. <span
id="fr_1325"></span>[1326](#fn_1325.md) I say nothing of other
philosophers, such as Pythagoras, Democritus, Xenocrates, Zeno, and
Cleanthes, who in extreme old age displayed the vigor of youth in the
pursuit of wisdom. I pass on to the poets, Homer, Hesiod, Simonides,
Stesichorus, who all lived to a great age, yet at the approach of death
sang each of them a swan song sweeter than their wont. <span
id="fr_1326"></span>[1327](#fn_1326.md) Sophocles, when charged by his sons
with dotage on account of his advanced years and his neglect of his
property, read out to his judges his recently composed play of Œdipus,
and made so great a display of wisdom—in spite of the inroads of
time—that he changed the decorous silence of the law court into the
applause of the theatre. <span id="fr_1327"></span>[1328](#fn_1327.md) And
no wonder, when Cato the censor, that most eloquent of Romans, in his
old age neither blushed at the thought of learning Greek nor despaired
of succeeding. <span id="fr_1328"></span>[1329](#fn_1328.md) Homer, for his
part, relates that from the tongue of Nestor, even when quite aged and
helpless, there flowed speech sweeter than honey. <span
id="fr_1329"></span>[1330](#fn_1329.md)

<span id="v.LII-p31"></span>Even the very name Abishag in its mystic
meaning points to the greater wisdom of old men. For the translation of
it is, “My father is over and above,” or “my father’s roaring.” The term
“over and above” is obscure, but in this passage is indicative of
excellence, and implies that the old have a larger stock of wisdom, and
that it even overflows by reason of its abundance. In another passage
“over and above” forms an antithesis to “necessary.” Moreover, Abishag,
that is, “roaring,” is properly used of the sound which the waves make,
and of the murmur which we hear coming from the sea. From which it is
plain that the thunder of the divine voice dwells in old men’s ears with
a volume of sound beyond the voices of men. Again, in our tongue
Shunamite means “scarlet,” a hint that the love of wisdom becomes warm
and glowing through religious study. For though the color may point to
the mystery of the Lord’s blood, it also sets forth the warm glow of
wisdom. Hence it is a scarlet thread that in Genesis the midwife binds
upon the hand of Pharez—Pharez “the divider,” so called because he
divided the partition which had before separated two peoples. <span
id="fr_1330"></span>[1331](#fn_1330.md) So, too, with a <span
id="page_91">p. 91</span> <span id="v.LII-Page_91"></span>mystic
reference to the shedding of blood, it was a scarlet cord which the
harlot Rahab (a type of the church) hung in her window to preserve her
house in the destruction of Jericho. <span
id="fr_1331"></span>[1332](#fn_1331.md) Hence, in another place Scripture
says of holy men: “These are they which came from the warmth of the
house of the father of Rechab.” <span
id="fr_1332"></span>[1333](#fn_1332.md) And in the gospel the Lord says: “I
am come to cast fire upon the earth, and fain am I to see it
kindled.” <span id="fr_1333"></span>[1334](#fn_1333.md) This was the fire
which, when it was kindled in the disciples’ hearts, constrained them to
say: “Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us by the
way, and while He opened to us the Scriptures?” <span
id="fr_1334"></span>[1335](#fn_1334.md)

<span id="v.LII-p37"></span>4. To what end, you ask, these recondite
references? To show that you need not expect from me boyish declamation,
flowery sentiments, a meretricious style, and at the close of every
paragraph the terse and pointed aphorisms which call forth approving
shouts from those who hear them. Let Wisdom alone embrace me; let her
nestle in my bosom, my Abishag who grows not old. Undefiled truly is
she, and a virgin forever for although she daily conceives and
unceasingly brings to the birth, like Mary she remains undeflowered.
When the apostle says “be fervent in spirit,” <span
id="fr_1335"></span>[1336](#fn_1335.md) he means “be true to wisdom.” And
when our Lord in the gospel declares that in the end of the world—when
the shepherd shall grow foolish, according to the prophecy of
Zechariah <span id="fr_1336"></span>[1337](#fn_1336.md) —“the love of many
shall wax cold,” <span id="fr_1337"></span>[1338](#fn_1337.md) He means
that wisdom shall decay. Hear, therefore—to quote the sainted
Cyprian—“words forcible rather than elegant.” <span
id="fr_1338"></span>[1339](#fn_1338.md) Hear one who, though he is your
brother in orders, is in years your father; who can conduct you from the
cradle of faith to spiritual manhood; and who, while he builds up stage
by stage the rules of holy living, can instruct others in instructing
you. I know, of course, that from your reverend uncle, Heliodorus, now a
bishop of Christ, you have learned and are daily learning all that is
holy; and that in him you have before you a rule of life and a pattern
of virtue. Take, then, my suggestions for what they are worth, and
compare my precepts with his. He will teach you the perfection of a
monk, and I shall show you the whole duty of a clergyman.

<span id="v.LII-p42"></span>5. A clergyman, then, as he serves Christ’s
church, must first understand what his name means; and then, when he
realizes this, must endeavor to be that which he is called. For since
the Greek word <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.LII-p42.1"></span>κλῆρος</span> means “lot,” or “inheritance,” the
clergy are so called either because they are the lot of the Lord, or
else because the Lord Himself is their lot and portion. Now, he who in
his own person is the Lord’s portion, or has the Lord for his portion,
must so bear himself as to possess the Lord and to be possessed by Him.
He who possesses the Lord, and who says with the prophet, “The Lord is
my portion,” <span id="fr_1339"></span>[1340](#fn_1339.md) can hold to
nothing beside the Lord. For if he hold to something beside the Lord,
the Lord will not be his portion. Suppose, for instance, that he holds
to gold or silver, or possessions or inlaid furniture; with such
portions as these the Lord will not deign to be his portion. I, if I am
the portion of the Lord, and the line of His heritage, <span
id="fr_1340"></span>[1341](#fn_1340.md) receive no portion among the
remaining tribes; but, like the Priest and the Levite, I live on the
tithe, <span id="fr_1341"></span>[1342](#fn_1341.md) and serving the altar,
am supported by its offerings. <span
id="fr_1342"></span>[1343](#fn_1342.md) Having food and raiment, I shall be
content with these, <span id="fr_1343"></span>[1344](#fn_1343.md) and as a
disciple of the Cross shall share its poverty. I beseech you, therefore,
and

<span id="v.LII-p48"></span>Again and yet again admonish you; <span
id="fr_1344"></span>[1345](#fn_1344.md)

<span id="v.LII-p50"></span>do not look to your military experience for
a standard of clerical obligation. Under Christ’s banner seek for no
worldly gain, lest having more than when you first became a clergyman,
you hear men say, to your shame, “Their portion shall not profit
them.” <span id="fr_1345"></span>[1346](#fn_1345.md) Welcome poor men and
strangers to your homely board, that with them Christ may be your guest.
A clergyman who engages in business, and who rises from poverty to
wealth, and from obscurity to a high position, avoid as you would the
plague. For “evil communications corrupt good manners.” <span
id="fr_1346"></span>[1347](#fn_1346.md) You despise gold; he loves it. You
spurn wealth; he eagerly pursues it. You love silence, meekness,
privacy; he takes delight in talking and effrontery, in squares, and
streets, and apothecaries’ shops. What unity of feeling can there be
where there is so wide a divergency of manners?

<span id="v.LII-p53"></span>A woman’s foot should seldom, if ever, cross
the threshold of your home. To all who are Christ’s virgins show the
same regard or the same disregard. Do not linger under the same roof
with them, and do not <span id="page_92">p. 92</span> <span
id="v.LII-Page_92"></span>rely on your past continence. You cannot be
holier than David or wiser than Solomon. Always bear in mind that it was
a woman who expelled the tiller of paradise from his heritage. <span
id="fr_1347"></span>[1348](#fn_1347.md) In case you are sick one of the
brethren may attend you; your sister also or your mother or some woman
whose faith is approved with all. But if you have no persons so
connected with you or so marked out by chaste behaviour, the Church
maintains many elderly women who by their ministrations may oblige you
and benefit themselves so that even your sickness may bear fruit in the
shape of almsdeeds. I know of cases where the recovery of the body has
but preluded the sickness of the soul. There is danger for you in the
service of one for whose face you constantly watch. If in the course of
your clerical duty you have to visit a widow or a virgin, never enter
the house alone. Let your companions be persons association with whom
will not disgrace you. If you take a reader with you or an acolyte or a
psalm-singer, let their character not their garb be their adornment; let
them use no tongs to curl their hair; rather let their mien be an index
of their chastity. You must not sit alone with a woman or see one
without witnesses. If she has anything confidential to disclose, she is
sure to have some nurse or housekeeper, <span
id="fr_1348"></span>[1349](#fn_1348.md) some virgin, some widow, some
married woman. She cannot be so friendless as to have none save you to
whom she can venture to confide her secret. Beware of all that gives
occasion for suspicion; and, to avoid scandal, shun every act that may
give colour to it. Frequent gifts of handkerchiefs and garters, of
face-cloths and dishes first tasted by the giver—to say nothing of notes
full of fond expressions—of such things as these a holy love knows
nothing. Such endearing and alluring expressions as ‘my honey’ and ‘my
darling,’ ‘you who are all my charm and my delight’ the ridiculous
courtesies of lovers and their foolish doings, we blush for on the stage
and abhor in men of the world. How much more do we loathe them in monks
and clergymen who adorn the priesthood by their vows <span
id="fr_1349"></span>[1350](#fn_1349.md) while their vows are adorned by the
priesthood. I speak thus not because I dread such evils for you or for
men of saintly life, but because in all ranks and callings and among
both men and women there are found both good and bad and in condemning
the bad I commend the good.

<span id="v.LII-p57"></span>6. Shameful to say, idol-priests,
play-actors, jockeys, and prostitutes can inherit property: clergymen
and monks alone lie under a legal disability, a disability enacted not
by persecutors but by Christian emperors. <span
id="fr_1350"></span>[1351](#fn_1350.md) I do not complain of the law, but I
grieve that we have deserved a statute so harsh. Cauterizing is a good
thing, no doubt; but how is it that I have a wound which makes me need
it? The law is strict and far-seeing, yet even so rapacity goes on
unchecked. By a fiction of trusteeship we set the statute at defiance;
and, as if imperial decrees outweigh the mandates of Christ, we fear the
laws and despise the Gospels. If heir there must be, the mother has
first claim upon her children, the Church upon her flock—the members of
which she has borne and reared and nourished. Why do we thrust ourselves
in between mother and children?

<span id="v.LII-p59"></span>It is the glory of a bishop to make
provision for the wants of the poor; but it is the shame of all priests
to amass private fortunes. I who was born (suppose) in a poor man’s
house, in a country cottage, and who could scarcely get of common millet
and household bread enough to fill an empty stomach, am now come to
disdain the finest wheat flour and honey. I know the several kinds of
fish by name. I can tell unerringly on what coast a mussel has been
picked. I can distinguish by the flavour the province from which a bird
comes. Dainty dishes delight me because their ingredients are scarce and
I end by finding pleasure in their ruinous cost.

<span id="v.LII-p60"></span>I hear also of servile attention shewn by
some towards old men and women when these are childless. They fetch the
basin, beset the bed and perform with their own hands the most revolting
offices. They anxiously await the advent of the doctor and with
trembling lips they ask whether the patient is better. If for a little
while the old fellow shews signs of returning vigour, they are in
agonies. They pretend to be delighted, but their covetous hearts undergo
secret torture. For they are afraid that their labours may go for
nothing and compare an old man with a clinging to life to the patriarch
Methuselah. How great a reward might they have with God if their hearts
were not set on a temporal prize! With what great exertions do they
pursue an empty heritage! Less labour might have purchased for them the
pearl of Christ.

<span id="v.LII-p61"></span>7. Read the divine scriptures constantly;
never, indeed, let the sacred volume be out of your hand. Learn what you
have to teach. “Hold fast the faithful word as you have been taught that
you may be able by sound doctrine to exhort and convince the gainsayers.
Continue thou in the things that thou hast learned and hast been assured
of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;” <span
id="fr_1351"></span>[1352](#fn_1351.md) and <span id="page_93">p. 93</span>
<span id="v.LII-Page_93"></span>“be ready always to give an answer to
every man that asketh you a reason of the hope and faith that are in
you.” <span id="fr_1352"></span>[1353](#fn_1352.md) Do not let your deeds
belie your words; lest when you speak in church someone may mentally
reply “Why do you not practise what you profess? Here is a lover of
dainties turned censor! his stomach is full and he reads us a homily on
fasting. As well might a robber accuse others of covetousness.” In a
priest of Christ mouth, mind, and hand should be at one.

<span id="v.LII-p64"></span>Be obedient to your bishop and welcome him
as the parent of your soul. Sons love their fathers and slaves fear
their masters. “If I be a father,” He says, “where is mine honour? And
if I am a master where is my fear?” <span
id="fr_1353"></span>[1354](#fn_1353.md) In your case the bishop combines in
himself many titles to your respect. He is at once a monk, a prelate,
and an uncle who has before now instructed you in all holy things. This
also I say that the bishops should know themselves to be priests not
lords. Let them render to the clergy the honour which is their due that
the clergy may offer to them the respect which belongs to bishops. There
is a witty saying of the orator Domitius which is here to the point:
“Why am I to recognize you as leader of the Senate when you will not
recognize my rights as a private member?” <span
id="fr_1354"></span>[1355](#fn_1354.md) We should realize that a bishop and
his presbyters are like Aaron and his sons. As there is but one Lord and
one Temple; so also should there be but one ministry. Let us ever bear
in mind the charge which the apostle Peter gives to priests: “feed the
flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof not by
constraint but willingly as God would have you; <span
id="fr_1355"></span>[1356](#fn_1355.md) not for filthy lucre but of a ready
mind; neither as being lords over God’s heritage but being ensamples to
the flock,” and that gladly; that “when the chief-shepherd shall appear
ye may receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.” <span
id="fr_1356"></span>[1357](#fn_1356.md) It is a bad custom which prevails
in certain churches for presbyters to be silent when bishops are present
on the ground that they would be jealous or impatient hearers. “If
anything,” writes the apostle Paul, “be revealed to another that sitteth
by, let the first hold his peace. For ye may all prophesy one by one
that all may learn and all may be comforted; and the spirits of the
prophets are subject to the prophets. For God is not the author of
confusion but of peace.” <span id="fr_1357"></span>[1358](#fn_1357.md) “A
wise son maketh a glad father;” <span
id="fr_1358"></span>[1359](#fn_1358.md) and a bishop should rejoice in the
discrimination which has led him to choose such for the priests of
Christ.

<span id="v.LII-p71"></span>8. When teaching in church seek to call
forth not plaudits but groans. Let the tears of your hearers be your
glory. A presbyter’s words ought to be seasoned by his reading of
scripture. Be not a declaimer or a ranter, one who gabbles without rhyme
or reason; but shew yourself skilled in the deep things and versed in
the mysteries of God. To mouth your words and by your quickness of
utterance astonish the unlettered crowd is a mark of ignorance.
Assurance often explains that of which it knows nothing; and when it has
convinced others imposes on itself. My teacher, Gregory of Nazianzus,
when I once asked him to explain Luke’s phrase <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.LII-p71.1"></span>σάββατον δευτερόπρωτον</span> , that is “the
second-first Sabbath,” playfully evaded my request saying: “I will tell
you about it in church, and there, when all the people applaud me, you
will be forced against your will to know what you do not know at all.
For, if you alone remain silent, every one will put you down for a
fool.” There is nothing so easy as by sheer volubility to deceive a
common crowd or an uneducated congregation: such most admire what they
fail to understand. Hear Marcus Tullius, the subject of that noble
eulogy: “You would have been the first of orators but for Demosthenes:
he would have been the only one but for you.” Hear what in his speech
for Quintus Gallius <span id="fr_1359"></span>[1360](#fn_1359.md) he has to
say about unskilled speakers and popular applause and then you will not
be the sport of such illusions. “What I am telling you,” said he, “is a
recent experience of my own. One who has the name of a poet and a man of
culture has written a book entitled *Conversations of Poets and
Philosophers*. In this he represents Euripides as conversing with
Menander and Socrates with Epicurus—men whose lives we know to be
separated not by years but by centuries. Nevertheless he calls forth
limitless applause and endless acclamations. For the theatre contains
many who belong to the same school as he: like him they have never
learned letters.”

<span id="v.LII-p73"></span>9. In dress avoid sombre colours as much as
bright ones. Showiness and slovenliness are alike to be shunned; for the
one savours of vanity and the other of pride. To go about without a
linen scarf on is nothing: what is praiseworthy is to be without money
to buy one. It is disgraceful and absurd to boast of having neither
napkin nor handkerchief and yet to carry a well-filled purse.

<span id="v.LII-p74"></span>Some bestow a trifle on the poor to receive
a larger sum themselves and under the cloak of almsgiving do but seek
for riches. Such are almshunters rather than almsgivers. Their methods
are those by which birds, beasts, and <span id="page_94">p. 94</span>
<span id="v.LII-Page_94"></span>fishes are taken. A morsel of bait is
put on the hook—to land a married lady’s purse! The church is committed
to the bishop; let him take heed whom he appoints to be his almoner. It
is better for me to have no money to give away than shamelessly to beg
what I mean to hoard. It is arrogance too to wish to seem more liberal
than he who is Christ’s bishop. “All things are not open to us
all.” <span id="fr_1360"></span>[1361](#fn_1360.md) In the church one is
the eye, another is the tongue, another the hand, another the foot,
others ears, belly, and so on. Read Paul’s epistle to the Corinthians
and learn how the one body is made up of different members. <span
id="fr_1361"></span>[1362](#fn_1361.md) The rude and simple brother must
not suppose himself a saint just because he knows nothing; and he who is
educated and eloquent must not measure his saintliness merely by his
fluency. Of two imperfect things holy rusticity is better than sinful
eloquence.

<span id="v.LII-p77"></span>10. Many build churches nowadays; their
walls and pillars of glowing marble, their ceilings glittering with
gold, their altars studded with jewels. Yet to the choice of Christ’s
ministers no heed is paid. And let no one allege against me the wealth
of the temple in Judæa, its table, its lamps, its censers, its dishes,
its cups, its spoons, <span id="fr_1362"></span>[1363](#fn_1362.md) and the
rest of its golden vessels. If these were approved by the Lord it was at
a time when the priests had to offer victims and when the blood of sheep
was the redemption of sins. They were figures typifying things still
future and were “written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the
world are come.” <span id="fr_1363"></span>[1364](#fn_1363.md) But now our
Lord by His poverty has consecrated the poverty of His house. Let us,
therefore, think of His cross and count riches to be but dirt. Why do we
admire what Christ calls “the mammon of unrighteousness”? <span
id="fr_1364"></span>[1365](#fn_1364.md) Why do we cherish and love what it
is Peter’s boast not to possess? <span
id="fr_1365"></span>[1366](#fn_1365.md) Or if we insist on keeping to the
letter and find the mention of gold and wealth so pleasing, let us keep
to everything else as well as the gold. Let the bishops of Christ be
bound to marry wives, who must be virgins. <span
id="fr_1366"></span>[1367](#fn_1366.md) Let the best-intentioned priest be
deprived of his office if he bear a scar and be disfigured. <span
id="fr_1367"></span>[1368](#fn_1367.md) Let bodily leprosy be counted worse
than spots upon the soul. Let us be fruitful and multiply and replenish
the earth, <span id="fr_1368"></span>[1369](#fn_1368.md) but let us slay no
lamb and celebrate no mystic passover, for where there is no
temple, <span id="fr_1369"></span>[1370](#fn_1369.md) the law forbids these
acts. Let us pitch tents in the seventh month <span
id="fr_1370"></span>[1371](#fn_1370.md) and noise abroad a solemn fast with
the sound of a horn. <span id="fr_1371"></span>[1372](#fn_1371.md) But if
we compare all these things as spiritual with things which are
spiritual; <span id="fr_1372"></span>[1373](#fn_1372.md) and if we allow
with Paul that “the Law is spiritual” <span
id="fr_1373"></span>[1374](#fn_1373.md) and call to mind David’s words:
“open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of thy
law;” <span id="fr_1374"></span>[1375](#fn_1374.md) and if on these grounds
we interpret it as our Lord interprets it—He has explained the Sabbath
in this way: <span id="fr_1375"></span>[1376](#fn_1375.md) then, rejecting
the superstitions of the Jews, we must also reject the gold; or,
approving the gold, we must approve the Jews as well. For we must either
accept them with the gold or condemn them with it.

<span id="v.LII-p92"></span>11. Avoid entertaining men of the world,
especially those whose honours make them swell with pride. You are the
priest of Christ—one poor and crucified who lived on the bread of
strangers. It is a disgrace to you if the consul’s lictors or soldiers
keep watch before your door, and if the Judge of the province has a
better dinner with you than in his own palace. If you plead as an excuse
your wish to intercede for the unhappy and the oppressed, I reply that a
worldly judge will defer more to a clergyman who is self-denying than to
one who is rich; he will pay more regard to your holiness than to your
wealth. Or if he is a man who will not hear the clergy on behalf of the
distressed except over the bowl, I will readily forego his aid and will
appeal to Christ who can help more effectively and speedily than any
judge. Truly “it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence
in man. It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in
princes.” <span id="fr_1376"></span>[1377](#fn_1376.md)

<span id="v.LII-p94"></span>Let your breath never smell of wine lest the
philosopher’s words be said to you: “instead of offering me a kiss you
are giving me a taste of wine.” Priests given to wine are both condemned
by the apostle <span id="fr_1377"></span>[1378](#fn_1377.md) and forbidden
by the old Law. Those who serve the altar, we are told, must drink
neither wine nor *shechar*. <span id="fr_1378"></span>[1379](#fn_1378.md)
Now every intoxicating drink is in Hebrew called *shechar* whether it is
made of corn or of the juice of apples, whether you distil from the
honeycomb a rude kind of mead or make a liquor by squeezing dates or
strain a thick syrup from a decoction of corn. Whatever intoxicates and
disturbs the balance of the mind avoid as you would wine. I do not say
that we are to condemn what is a creature of God. The Lord Himself was
called a “wine-bibber” and wine in moderation was allowed to Timothy
because of his weak stomach. I only require that drinkers should observe
that limit which their age, their health, or their constitution
requires. But if without drink<span id="page_95">p. 95</span> <span
id="v.LII-Page_95"></span>ing wine at all I am aglow with youth and am
inflamed by the heat of my blood and am of a strong and lusty habit of
body, I will readily forego the cup in which I cannot but suspect
poison. The Greeks have an excellent saying which will perhaps bear
translation,

<span id="v.LII-p97"></span>Fat bellies have no sentiments
refined. <span id="fr_1379"></span>[1380](#fn_1379.md)

<span id="v.LII-p101"></span>12. Lay upon yourself only as much fasting
as you can bear, and let your fasts be pure, chaste, simple, moderate,
and not superstitious. What good is it to use no oil if you seek after
the most troublesome and out-of-the-way kinds of food, dried figs,
pepper, nuts, dates, fine flour, honey, pistachios? All the resources of
gardening are strained to save us from eating household bread; and to
pursue dainties we turn our backs on the kingdom of heaven. There are
some, I am told, who reverse the laws of nature and the race; for they
neither eat bread nor drink water but imbibe thin decoctions of crushed
herbs and beet-juice—not from a cup but from a shell. Shame on us that
we have no blushes for such follies and that we feel no disgust at such
superstition! To crown all, in the midst of our dainties we seek a
reputation for abstinence. The strictest fast is bread and water. But
because it brings with it no glory and because we all of us live on
bread and water, it is reckoned no fast at all but an ordinary and
common matter.

<span id="v.LII-p102"></span>13. Do not angle for compliments, lest,
while you win the popular applause, you do despite to God. “If I yet
pleased men,” says the apostle, “I should not be the servant of
Christ.” <span id="fr_1380"></span>[1381](#fn_1380.md) He ceased to please
men when he became Christ’s servant. Christ’s soldier marches on through
good report and evil report, <span id="fr_1381"></span>[1382](#fn_1381.md)
the one on the right hand and the other on the left. No praise elates
him, no reproaches crush him. He is not puffed up by riches, nor does he
shrink into himself because of poverty. Joy and sorrow he alike
despises. The sun does not burn him by day nor the moon by night. <span
id="fr_1382"></span>[1383](#fn_1382.md) Do not pray at the corners of the
streets, <span id="fr_1383"></span>[1384](#fn_1383.md) lest the applause of
men interrupt the straight course of your prayers. Do not broaden your
fringes and for show wear phylacteries, <span
id="fr_1384"></span>[1385](#fn_1384.md) or, despite of conscience, wrap
yourself in the self-seeking of the Pharisee. <span
id="fr_1385"></span>[1386](#fn_1385.md) Would you know what mode of apparel
the Lord requires? Have prudence, justice, temperance, fortitude. <span
id="fr_1386"></span>[1387](#fn_1386.md) Let these be the four quarters of
your horizon, let them be a four-horse team to bear you, Christ’s
charioteer, at full speed to your goal. No necklace can be more precious
than these; no gems can form a brighter galaxy. By them you are
decorated, you are girt about, you are protected on every side. They are
your defence as well as your glory; for every gem is turned into a
shield.

<span id="v.LII-p110"></span>14. Beware also of a blabbing tongue and of
itching ears. Neither detract from others nor listen to detractors.
“Thou sittest,” says the psalmist, “and speakest against thy brother;
thou slanderest thine own mother’s son. These things hast thou done and
I kept silence; thou thoughtest wickedly that I was such an one as
thyself, but I will reprove thee and set them <span
id="fr_1387"></span>[1388](#fn_1387.md) in order before thine eyes.” <span
id="fr_1388"></span>[1389](#fn_1388.md) Keep your tongue from cavilling and
watch over your words. Know that in judging others you are passing
sentence on yourself and that you are yourself guilty of the faults
which you blame in them. It is no excuse to say: “if others tell me
things I cannot be rude to them.” No one cares to speak to an unwilling
listener. An arrow never lodges in a stone: often it recoils upon the
shooter of it. Let the detractor learn from your unwillingness to listen
not to be so ready to detract. Solomon says:—“meddle not with them that
are given to detraction: for their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who
knoweth the destruction of them both?” <span
id="fr_1389"></span>[1390](#fn_1389.md) —of the detractor, that is, and of
the person who lends an ear to his detraction.

<span id="v.LII-p114"></span>15. It is your duty to visit the sick, to
know the homes and children of ladies who are married, and to guard the
secrets of noblemen. Make it your object, therefore, to keep your tongue
chaste as well as your eyes. Never discuss a woman’s figure nor let one
house know what is going on in another. Hippocrates, <span
id="fr_1390"></span>[1391](#fn_1390.md) before he will teach his pupils,
makes them take an oath and compels them to swear fealty to him. He
binds them over to silence, and prescribes for them their language,
their gait, their dress, their manners. How much more reason have we to
whom the medicine of the soul has been committed to love the houses of
all Christians as our own homes. Let them know us as comforters in
sorrow rather than as guests in time of mirth. That clergyman soon
becomes an object of contempt who being often asked out to dinner never
refuses to go.

<span id="v.LII-p116"></span>16. Let us never seek for presents and
rarely accept them when we are asked to do so. For “it is more blessed
to give than to <span id="page_96">p. 96</span> <span
id="v.LII-Page_96"></span>receive.” <span
id="fr_1391"></span>[1392](#fn_1391.md) Somehow or other the very man who
begs leave to offer you a gift holds you the cheaper for your acceptance
of it; while, if you refuse it, it is wonderful how much more he will
come to respect you. The preacher of continence must not be a maker of
marriages. Why does he who reads the apostle’s words “it remaineth that
they that have wives be as though they had none” <span
id="fr_1392"></span>[1393](#fn_1392.md) —why does he press a virgin to
marry? Why does a priest, who must be a monogamist, <span
id="fr_1393"></span>[1394](#fn_1393.md) urge a widow to marry again? How
can the clergy be managers and stewards of other men’s households, when
they are bidden to disregard even their own interests? To wrest a thing
from a friend is theft but to cheat the Church is sacrilege. When you
have received money to be doled out to the poor, to be cautious or to
hesitate while crowds are starving is to be worse than a robber; and to
subtract a portion for yourself is to commit a crime of the deepest dye.
I am tortured with hunger and are you to judge what will satisfy my
cravings? Either divide immediately what you have received, or, if you
are a timid almoner, send the donor to distribute his own gifts. Your
purse ought not to remain full while I am in need. No one can look after
what is mine better than I can. He is the best almoner who keeps nothing
for himself.

<span id="v.LII-p120"></span>17. You have compelled me, my dear
Nepotian, in spite of the castigation which my treatise on *Virginity*
has had to endure—the one which I wrote for the saintly Eustochium at
Rome: <span id="fr_1394"></span>[1395](#fn_1394.md) —you have compelled me
after ten years have passed once more to open my mouth at Bethlehem and
to expose myself to the stabs of every tongue. For I could only escape
from criticism by writing nothing—a course made impossible by your
request; and I knew when I took up my pen that the shafts of all
gainsayers would be launched against me. I beg such to hold their peace
and to desist from gainsaying: for I have written to them not as to
opponents but as to friends. I have not inveighed against those who sin:
I have but warned them to sin no more. My judgment of myself has been as
strict as my judgment of them. When I have wished to remove the mote
from my neighbour’s eye, I have first cast out the beam in my own. <span
id="fr_1395"></span>[1396](#fn_1395.md) I have calumniated no one. Not a
name has been hinted at. My words have not been aimed at individuals and
my criticism of shortcomings has been quite general. If any one wishes
to be angry with me he will have first to own that he himself suits my
description.
