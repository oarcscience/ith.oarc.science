<span id="v.LXXVI-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.LXXVI-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXVI. To Abigaus.</span>

<span id="v.LXXVI-p2"></span>Abigaus the recipient of this letter was a
blind presbyter of Bætica in Spain. He had asked the help of Jerome’s
prayers in his struggles with evil and Jerome now writes to cheer and to
console him. He concludes his remarks by commending to his especial care
the widow Theodora. The letter should be compared with that addressed to
Castrutius (LXVIII.). It was written at the same time with the
preceding.

<span id="v.LXXVI-p3"></span><span id="page_157">p. 157</span> <span
id="v.LXXVI-Page_157"></span>1. Although I am conscious of many sins and
every day pray on bended knees, “Remember not the sins of my youth nor
my transgressions, <span id="fr_2299"></span>[2300](#fn_2299.md) yet
because I know that it has been said by the Apostle “let a man not be
lifted up with pride lest he fall into the condemnation of the
devil,” <span id="fr_2300"></span>[2301](#fn_2300.md) and that it is
written in another passage, “God resisteth the proud but giveth grace to
the humble,” <span id="fr_2301"></span>[2302](#fn_2301.md) there is nothing
I have striven so much to avoid from my boyhood up as a swelling mind
and a stiff neck, <span id="fr_2302"></span>[2303](#fn_2302.md) things
which always provoke against themselves the wrath of God. For I know
that my master and Lord and God has said in the lowliness of His flesh:
“Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart,” <span
id="fr_2303"></span>[2304](#fn_2303.md) and that before this He has sung by
the mouth of David: “Lord, remember David and all his gentleness.” <span
id="fr_2304"></span>[2305](#fn_2304.md) Again we read in another passage,
“Before destruction the heart of man is haughty; and before honour is
humility.” <span id="fr_2305"></span>[2306](#fn_2305.md) Do not, then, I
implore you, suppose that I have received your letter and have passed it
over in silence. Do not, I beseech you, lay to my charge the dishonesty
and negligence of which others have been guilty. For why should I, when
called on to respond to your kind advances, continue dumb and repel by
my silence the friendship which you offer? I who am always forward to
seek intimate relations with the good and even to thrust myself upon
their affection. “Two,” we read, “are better than one.…for if they fall,
the one will lift up his fellow.…a three fold cord is not quickly
broken, and a brother that helps his brother shall be exalted.” <span
id="fr_2306"></span>[2307](#fn_2306.md) Write to me, therefore, boldly, and
overcome the effect of absence by frequent colloquies.

<span id="v.LXXVI-p12"></span>2. You should not grieve that you are
destitute of those bodily eyes which ants, flies, and creeping things
have as well as men; rather you should rejoice that you possess that eye
of which it is said in the Song of Songs, “Thou hast ravished my heart,
my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine
eyes.” <span id="fr_2307"></span>[2308](#fn_2307.md) This is the eye with
which God is seen and to which Moses refers when he says:—“I will now
turn aside and see this great sight.” <span
id="fr_2308"></span>[2309](#fn_2308.md) We even read of some philosophers
of this world <span id="fr_2309"></span>[2310](#fn_2309.md) that they have
plucked out their eyes in order to turn all their thoughts upon the pure
depths of the mind. And a prophet has said “Death has entered through
your windows.” <span id="fr_2310"></span>[2311](#fn_2310.md) Our Lord too
tells the Apostles: “Whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her
hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.” <span
id="fr_2311"></span>[2312](#fn_2311.md) Consequently they are commanded to
lift up their eyes and to look on the fields, for these are white and
ready for harvest. <span id="fr_2312"></span>[2313](#fn_2312.md)

<span id="v.LXXVI-p19"></span>3. You request me by my exhortations to
slay in you Nebuchadnezzar and Rabshakeh and Nebuzar-adan and
Holofernes. <span id="fr_2313"></span>[2314](#fn_2313.md) Were they alive
in you, you would never have sought my aid. No, they are dead within
you, and you have begun to build up the ruins of Jerusalem with the help
of Zerubbabel and of Joshua the son of Josedech the high priest, of Ezra
and of Nehemiah. You do not put your wages into a bag with holes, <span
id="fr_2314"></span>[2315](#fn_2314.md) but you lay up for yourselves
treasures in heaven, <span id="fr_2315"></span>[2316](#fn_2315.md) and if
you seek my friendship, it is because you believe me to be a servant of
Christ.

<span id="v.LXXVI-p23"></span>I commend to you—although she needs no
commendation but her own—my holy daughter Theodora, formerly the wife or
rather the sister of Lucinius of blessed memory. Tell her that she must
not grow weary of the path upon which she has entered, and that she can
only reach the Holy Land by toiling through the wilderness. Warn her
against supposing that the work of virtue is perfected when she has made
her exodus from Egypt. Remind her that she must pass through snares
innumerable to arrive at mount Nebo and the River Jordan, <span
id="fr_2316"></span>[2317](#fn_2316.md) that she must receive circumcision
anew at Gilgal, <span id="fr_2317"></span>[2318](#fn_2317.md) that Jericho
must fall before her, overthrown by the blasts of priestly
trumpets, <span id="fr_2318"></span>[2319](#fn_2318.md) that Adoni-zedec
must be slain, <span id="fr_2319"></span>[2320](#fn_2319.md) that Ai and
Hazor, once fairest of cities, must both fall. <span
id="fr_2320"></span>[2321](#fn_2320.md)

<span id="v.LXXVI-p29"></span>The brothers who are with me in the
monastery salute you, and I through you earnestly salute those reverend
persons who deign to bestow upon me their regard.
