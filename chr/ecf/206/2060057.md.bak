<span id="v.XLVI-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XLVI-p1.1"></span>Letter XLVI. Paula and Eustochium to
Marcella.</span>

<span id="v.XLVI-p2"></span>Jerome writes to Marcella in the name of
Paula and Eustochium, describing the charms of the Holy Land, and urging
her to leave Rome and to join her old companions at Bethlehem. Much of
the letter is devoted to disposing of the objection that since the
Passion of Christ the Holy Land has been under a curse. The date of the
letter is <span class="c17"><span id="v.XLVI-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>
386. It is written from Bethlehem, which now becomes Jerome’s home for
the remainder of his life.

<span id="v.XLVI-p3"></span>1. Love cannot be measured, impatience knows
no bounds, and eagerness can brook no delay. Wherefore we, oblivious of
our weakness, and relying more on our will than our capacity,
desire—pupils though we be—to instruct our mistress. We are like the sow
in the proverb, <span id="fr_936"></span>[937](#fn_936.md) which sets up to
teach the goddess of invention. You were the first to set our tinder
alight; the first, by precept and example, to urge us to adopt our
present life. As a hen gathers her chickens, so did you take us under
your wing. <span id="fr_937"></span>[938](#fn_937.md) And will you now let
us fly about at random with no mother near us? Will you leave us to
dread the swoop of the hawk and the shadow of each passing bird of prey?
Separated from you, we do what we can: we utter our mournful plaint, and
more by sobs than by tears we adjure you to give back to us the Marcella
whom we love. She is mild, she is suave, she is sweeter than the
sweetest honey. She must not, therefore, be stern and morose to us, whom
her winning ways have roused to adopt a life like her own.

<span id="v.XLVI-p6"></span>2. Assuming that what we ask is for the
best, our eagerness to obtain it is nothing to be ashamed of. And if all
the Scriptures agree with our view, we are not too bold in urging you to
a course to which you have yourself often urged us.

<span id="v.XLVI-p7"></span>What are God’s first words to Abraham? “Get
thee out of thy country and from thy kindred unto a land that I will
show thee.” <span id="fr_938"></span>[939](#fn_938.md) The patriarch—the
first to receive a promise of Christ—is here told to leave the Chaldees,
to leave the city of confusion <span id="fr_939"></span>[940](#fn_939.md)
and its *rehoboth* <span id="fr_940"></span>[941](#fn_940.md) or broad
places; to leave also the plain of Shinar, where the tower of pride had
been raised to heaven. <span id="fr_941"></span>[942](#fn_941.md) He has to
pass through the waves of this world, and to ford its rivers; <span
id="page_61">p. 61</span> <span id="v.XLVI-Page_61"></span>those by
which the saints sat down and wept when they remembered Zion, <span
id="fr_942"></span>[943](#fn_942.md) and Chebar’s flood, whence Ezekiel was
carried to Jerusalem by the hair of his head. <span
id="fr_943"></span>[944](#fn_943.md) All this Abraham undergoes that he may
dwell in a land of promise watered from above, and not like Egypt, from
below, <span id="fr_944"></span>[945](#fn_944.md) no producer of herbs for
the weak and ailing, <span id="fr_945"></span>[946](#fn_945.md) but a land
that looks for the early and the latter rain from heaven. <span
id="fr_946"></span>[947](#fn_946.md) It is a land of hills and
valleys, <span id="fr_947"></span>[948](#fn_947.md) and stands high above
the sea. The attractions of the world it entirely wants, but its
spiritual attractions are for this all the greater. Mary, the mother of
the Lord, left the lowlands and made her way to the hill country, when,
after receiving the angel’s message, she realized that she bore within
her womb the Son of God. <span id="fr_948"></span>[949](#fn_948.md) When of
old the Philistines had been overcome, when their devilish audacity had
been smitten, when their champion had fallen on his face to the
earth, <span id="fr_949"></span>[950](#fn_949.md) it was from this city
that there went forth a procession of jubilant souls, a harmonious choir
to sing our David’s victory over tens of thousands. <span
id="fr_950"></span>[951](#fn_950.md) Here, too, it was that the angel
grasped his sword, and while he laid waste the whole of the ungodly
city, marked out the temple of the Lord in the threshing floor of Ornan,
king of the Jebusites. <span id="fr_951"></span>[952](#fn_951.md) Thus
early was it made plain that Christ’s church would grow up, not in
Israel, but among the Gentiles. Turn back to Genesis, <span
id="fr_952"></span>[953](#fn_952.md) and you will find that this was the
city over which Melchizedek held sway, that king of Salem who, as a type
of Christ, offered to Abraham bread and wine, and even then consecrated
the mystery which Christians consecrate in the body and blood of the
Saviour. <span id="fr_953"></span>[954](#fn_953.md)

<span id="v.XLVI-p24"></span>3. Perhaps you will tacitly reprove us for
deserting the order of Scripture, and letting our confused account
ramble this way and that, as one thing or another strikes us. If so, we
say once more what we said at the outset: love has no logic, and
impatience knows no rule. In the Song of Songs the precept is given as a
hard one: “Regulate your love towards me.” <span
id="fr_954"></span>[955](#fn_954.md) And so we plead that, if we err, we do
so not from ignorance but from feeling.

<span id="v.XLVI-p26"></span>Well, then, to bring forward something
still more out of place, we must go back to yet remoter times. Tradition
has it that in this city, nay, more, on this very spot, Adam lived and
died. The place where our Lord was crucified is called Calvary, <span
id="fr_955"></span>[956](#fn_955.md) because the skull of the primitive man
was buried there. So it came to pass that the second Adam, that is the
blood <span id="fr_956"></span>[957](#fn_956.md) of Christ, as it dropped
from the cross, washed away the sins of the buried protoplast, <span
id="fr_957"></span>[958](#fn_957.md) the first Adam, and thus the words of
the apostle were fulfilled: “Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from
the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.” <span
id="fr_958"></span>[959](#fn_958.md)

<span id="v.XLVI-p31"></span>It would be tedious to enumerate all the
prophets and holy men who have been sent forth from this place. All that
is strange and mysterious to us is familiar and natural to this city and
country. By its very names, three in number, it proves the doctrine of
the trinity. For it is called first Jebus, then Salem, then Jerusalem:
names of which the first means “down-trodden,” the second “peace,” and
the third “vision of peace.” <span id="fr_959"></span>[960](#fn_959.md) For
it is only by slow stages that we reach our goal; it is only after we
have been trodden down that we are lifted up to see the vision of peace.
Because of this peace Solomon, <span id="fr_960"></span>[961](#fn_960.md)
the man of peace, was born there, and “in peace was his place
made.” <span id="fr_961"></span>[962](#fn_961.md) King of kings, and lord
of lords, his name and that of the city show him to be a type of Christ.
Need we speak of David and his descendants, all of whom reigned here? As
Judæa is exalted above all other provinces, so is this city exalted
above all Judæa. To speak more tersely, the glory of the province is
derived from its capital; and whatever fame the members possess is in
every case due to the head.

<span id="v.XLVI-p37"></span>4. You have long been anxious to break
forth into speech; the very letters we have formed perceive it, and our
paper already understands the question you are going to put. You will
reply to us by saying: it was so of old, when “the Lord loved the gates
of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob,” and when her foundations
were in the holy mountains. <span id="fr_962"></span>[963](#fn_962.md) Even
these verses, however, are susceptible of a deeper interpretation. But
things are changed since then. The risen Lord has proclaimed in tones of
thunder: “Your house is left unto you desolate.” With tears He has
prophesied its downfall: “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the
prophets, and stonest them which are sent un<span id="page_62">p.
62</span> <span id="v.XLVI-Page_62"></span>to thee; how often would I
have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens
under her wings, and ye would not. Behold your house is left unto you
desolate.” <span id="fr_963"></span>[964](#fn_963.md) The veil of the
temple has been rent; <span id="fr_964"></span>[965](#fn_964.md) an army
has encompassed Jerusalem, it has been stained by the blood of the Lord.
Now, therefore, its guardian angels have forsaken it and the grace of
Christ has been withdrawn. Josephus, himself a Jewish writer,
asserts <span id="fr_965"></span>[966](#fn_965.md) that at the Lord’s
crucifixion there broke from the temple voices of heavenly powers,
saying: “Let us depart hence.” These and other considerations show that
where grace abounded there did sin much more abound. <span
id="fr_966"></span>[967](#fn_966.md) Again, when the apostles received the
command: “Go ye and teach all nations,” <span
id="fr_967"></span>[968](#fn_967.md) and when they said themselves: “It was
necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you, but
seeing ye put it from you…lo we turn to the Gentiles,” <span
id="fr_968"></span>[969](#fn_968.md) then all the spiritual
importance <span id="fr_969"></span>[970](#fn_969.md) of Judæa and its old
intimacy with God were transferred by the apostles to the nations.

<span id="v.XLVI-p46"></span>5. The difficulty is strongly stated, and
may well puzzle even those proficient in Scripture; but for all that, it
admits of an easy solution. The Lord wept for the fall of
Jerusalem, <span id="fr_970"></span>[971](#fn_970.md) and He would not have
done so if He did not love it. He wept for Lazarus because He loved
him. <span id="fr_971"></span>[972](#fn_971.md) The truth is that it was
the people who sinned and not the place. The capture of a city is
involved in the slaying of its inhabitants. If Jerusalem was destroyed,
it was that its people might be punished; if the temple was overthrown,
it was that its figurative sacrifices might be abolished. As regards its
site, lapse of time has but invested it with fresh grandeur. The Jews of
old reverenced the Holy of Holies, because of the things contained in
it—the cherubim, the mercy-seat, the ark of the covenant, the manna,
Aaron’s rod, and the golden altar. <span
id="fr_972"></span>[973](#fn_972.md) Does the Lord’s sepulchre seem less
worthy of veneration? As often as we enter it we see the Saviour in His
grave clothes, and if we linger we see again the angel sitting at His
feet, and the napkin folded at His head. <span
id="fr_973"></span>[974](#fn_973.md) Long before this sepulchre was hewn
out by Joseph, <span id="fr_974"></span>[975](#fn_974.md) its glory was
foretold in Isaiah’s prediction, “his rest shall be glorious,” <span
id="fr_975"></span>[976](#fn_975.md) meaning that the place of the Lord’s
burial should be held in universal honor.

<span id="v.XLVI-p53"></span>6. How, then, you will say, do we read in
the apocalypse written by John: “The beast that ascendeth out of the
bottomless pit shall…kill them \[that is, obviously, the prophets\], and
their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which
spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was
crucified?” <span id="fr_976"></span>[977](#fn_976.md) If the great city
where the Lord was crucified is Jerusalem, and if the place of His
crucifixion is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt; then as the Lord was
crucified at Jerusalem, Jerusalem must be Sodom and Egypt. Holy
Scripture, I reply first of all, cannot contradict itself. One book
cannot invalidate the drift of the whole. A single verse cannot annul
the meaning of a book. Ten lines earlier in the apocalypse it is
written: “Rise and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them
that worship therein. But the court which is without the temple leave
out and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles; and the holy
city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.” <span
id="fr_977"></span>[978](#fn_977.md) The apocalypse was written by John
long after the Lord’s passion, yet in it he speaks of Jerusalem as the
holy city. But if so, how can he spiritually call it Sodom and Egypt? It
is no answer to say that the Jerusalem which is called holy is the
heavenly one which is to be, while that which is called Sodom is the
earthly one tottering to its downfall. For it is the Jerusalem to come
that is referred to in the description of the beast, “which shall ascend
out of the bottomless pit, and shall make war against the two prophets,
and shall overcome them and kill them, and their dead bodies shall lie
in the street of the great city.” <span
id="fr_978"></span>[979](#fn_978.md) At the close of the book it is farther
described thus: “And the city lieth four-square, and the length of it
and the breadth are the same as the height; and he measured the city
with the golden reed twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the
breadth and the height of it are equal. And he measured the walls
thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure
of a man, that is, of the angel. And the building of the wall of it was
of jasper; and the city was pure gold” <span
id="fr_979"></span>[980](#fn_979.md) —and so on. Now where there is a
square there can be neither length nor breadth. And what kind of
measurement is that which makes length and breadth equal to height? And
how can there be walls of jasper, or a whole city of pure gold; its
foundations and its streets of precious stones, and its twelve gates
each glowing with pearls?

<span id="v.XLVI-p58"></span><span id="page_63">p. 63</span> <span
id="v.XLVI-Page_63"></span>7. Evidently this description cannot be taken
literally (in fact, it is absurd to suppose a city the length, breadth
and height of which are all twelve thousand furlongs), and therefore the
details of it must be mystically understood. The great city which Cain
first built and called after his son <span
id="fr_980"></span>[981](#fn_980.md) must be taken to represent this world,
which the devil, that accuser of his brethren, that fratricide who is
doomed to perish, has built of vice cemented with crime, and filled with
iniquity. Therefore it is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt. Thus it is
written, “Sodom shall return to her former estate,” <span
id="fr_981"></span>[982](#fn_981.md) that is to say, the world must be
restored as it has been before. For we cannot believe that Sodom and
Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim <span id="fr_982"></span>[983](#fn_982.md) are
to be built again: they must be left to lie in ashes forever. We never
read of Egypt as put for Jerusalem: it always stands for this world. To
collect from Scripture the countless proofs of this would be tedious: I
shall adduce but one passage, a passage in which this world is most
clearly called Egypt. The apostle Jude, the brother of James, writes
thus in his catholic epistle: “I will, therefore, put you in
remembrance, though ye once knew this how that Jesus, <span
id="fr_983"></span>[984](#fn_983.md) having saved the people out of the
land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.” <span
id="fr_984"></span>[985](#fn_984.md) And, lest you should fancy Joshua the
son of Nun to be meant, the passage goes on thus: “And the angels which
kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath
reserved in everlasting chains, under darkness, unto the judgment of the
great day.” <span id="fr_985"></span>[986](#fn_985.md) Moreover, to
convince you that in every place where Egypt, Sodom and Gomorrah are
named together it is not these spots, but the present world, which is
meant, he mentions them immediately in this sense. “Even as Sodom and
Gomorrah,” he writes, “and the cities about them, in like manner giving
themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh, are set
forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.” <span
id="fr_986"></span>[987](#fn_986.md) But what need is there to collect more
proofs when, after the passion and the resurrection of the Lord, the
evangelist Matthew tells us: “The rocks rent, and the graves were
opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of
the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city and
appeared unto many”? <span id="fr_987"></span>[988](#fn_987.md) We must not
interpret this passage straight off, as many people <span
id="fr_988"></span>[989](#fn_988.md) absurdly do, of the heavenly
Jerusalem: the apparition there of the bodies of the saints could be no
sign to men of the Lord’s rising. Since, therefore, the evangelists and
all the Scriptures speak of Jerusalem as the holy city, and since the
psalmist commands us to worship the Lord “at his footstool;” <span
id="fr_989"></span>[990](#fn_989.md) allow no one to call it Sodom and
Egypt, for by it the Lord forbids men to swear because “it is the city
of the great king.” <span id="fr_990"></span>[991](#fn_990.md)

<span id="v.XLVI-p70"></span>8. The land is accursed, you say, because
it has drunk in the blood of the Lord. On what grounds, then, do men
regard as blessed those spots where Peter and Paul, the leaders of the
Christian host, have shed their blood for Christ? If the confession of
men and servants is glorious, must there not be glory likewise in the
confession of their Lord and God? Everywhere we venerate the tombs of
the martyrs; we apply their holy ashes to our eyes; we even touch them,
if we may, with our lips. And yet some think that we should neglect the
tomb in which the Lord Himself is buried. If we refuse to believe human
testimony, let us at least credit the devil and his angels. <span
id="fr_991"></span>[992](#fn_991.md) For when in front of the Holy
Sepulchre they are driven out of those bodies which they have possessed,
they moan and tremble as if they stood before Christ’s judgment-seat,
and grieve, too late that they have crucified Him in whose presence they
now cower. If—as a wicked theory maintains—this holy place has, since
the Lord’s passion, become an abomination, why was Paul in such haste to
reach Jerusalem to keep Pentecost in it? <span
id="fr_992"></span>[993](#fn_992.md) Yet to those who held him back he
said: “What mean ye to weep and to break my heart? For I am ready not to
be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord
Jesus.” <span id="fr_993"></span>[994](#fn_993.md) Need I speak of those
other holy and illustrious men who, after the preaching of Christ,
brought their votive gifts and offerings to the brethren who were at
Jerusalem?

<span id="v.XLVI-p74"></span>9. Time forbids me to survey the period
which has passed since the Lord’s ascension, or to recount the bishops,
the martyrs, the divines, who have come to Jerusalem from a feeling that
their devotion and knowledge would be incomplete and their virtue
without the finishing touch, unless they adored Christ in the very spot
where the gospel first flashed from the gibbet. If a famous orator <span
id="fr_994"></span>[995](#fn_994.md) blames a man for having learned Greek
at Lilybæum instead of at Athens, and Latin in Sicily instead of at Rome
(on the ground, <span id="page_64">p. 64</span> <span
id="v.XLVI-Page_64"></span>obviously, that each province has its own
characteristics), can we suppose a Christian’s education complete who
has not visited the Christian Athens?

<span id="v.XLVI-p76"></span>10. In speaking thus we do not mean to deny
that the kingdom of God is within us, <span
id="fr_995"></span>[996](#fn_995.md) or to say that there are no holy men
elsewhere; we merely assert in the strongest manner that those who stand
first throughout the world are here gathered side by side. We ourselves
are among the last, not the first; yet we have come hither to see the
first of all nations. Of all the ornaments of the Church our company of
monks and virgins is one of the finest; it is like a fair flower or a
priceless gem. Every man of note in Gaul hastens hither. The Briton,
“sundered from our world,” <span id="fr_996"></span>[997](#fn_996.md) no
sooner makes progress in religion than he leaves the setting sun in
quest of a spot of which he knows only through Scripture and common
report. Need we recall the Armenians, the Persians, the peoples of India
and Arabia? Or those of our neighbor, Egypt, so rich in monks; of Pontus
and Cappadocia; of Cæle-Syria and Mesopotamia and the teeming east? In
fulfilment of the Saviour’s words, “Wherever the body is, thither will
the eagles be gathered together,” <span
id="fr_997"></span>[998](#fn_997.md) they all assemble here and exhibit in
this one city the most varied virtues. Differing in speech, they are one
in religion, and almost every nation has a choir of its own. Yet amid
this great concourse there is no arrogance, no disdain of
self-restraint; all strive after humility, that greatest of Christian
virtues. Whosoever is last is here regarded as first. <span
id="fr_998"></span>[999](#fn_998.md) Their dress neither provokes remark
nor calls for admiration. In whatever guise a man shows himself he is
neither censured nor flattered. Long fasts help no one here. Starvation
wins no deference, and the taking of food in moderation is not
condemned. “To his own master” each one “standeth or falleth.” <span
id="fr_999"></span>[1000](#fn_999.md) No man judges another lest he be
judged of the Lord. <span id="fr_1000"></span>[1001](#fn_1000.md)
Backbiting, so common in other parts, is wholly unknown here. Sensuality
and excess are far removed from us. And in the city there are so many
places of prayer that a day would not be sufficient to go round them
all.

<span id="v.XLVI-p83"></span>11. But, as every one praises most what is
within his reach, let us pass now to the cottage-inn which sheltered
Christ and Mary. <span id="fr_1001"></span>[1002](#fn_1001.md) With what
expressions and what language can we set before you the cave of the
Saviour? The stall where he cried as a babe can be best honored by
silence; for words are inadequate to speak its praise. Where are the
spacious porticoes? Where are the gilded ceilings? Where are the
mansions furnished by the miserable toil of doomed wretches? Where are
the costly halls raised by untitled opulence for man’s vile body to walk
in? Where are the roofs that intercept the sky, as if anything could be
finer than the expanse of heaven? Behold, in this poor crevice of the
earth the Creator of the heavens was born; here He was wrapped in
swaddling clothes; here He was seen by the shepherds; here He was
pointed out by the star; here He was adored by the wise men. This spot
is holier, me-thinks, than that Tarpeian rock <span
id="fr_1002"></span>[1003](#fn_1002.md) which has shown itself displeasing
to God by the frequency with which it has been struck by lightning.

<span id="v.XLVI-p86"></span>12. Read the apocalypse of John, and
consider what is sung therein of the woman arrayed in purple, and of the
blasphemy written upon her brow, of the seven mountains, of the many
waters, and of the end of Babylon. <span
id="fr_1003"></span>[1004](#fn_1003.md) “Come out of her, my people,” so
the Lord says, “that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye
receive not of her plagues.” <span id="fr_1004"></span>[1005](#fn_1004.md)
Turn back also to Jeremiah and pay heed to what he has written of like
import: “Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his
soul.” <span id="fr_1005"></span>[1006](#fn_1005.md) For “Babylon the great
is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the
hold of every foul spirit.” <span id="fr_1006"></span>[1007](#fn_1006.md)
It is true that Rome has a holy church, trophies of apostles and
martyrs, a true confession of Christ. The faith has been preached there
by an apostle, heathenism has been trodden down, the name of Christian
is daily exalted higher and higher. But the display, power, and size of
the city, the seeing and the being seen, the paying and the receiving of
visits, the alternate flattery and detraction, talking and listening, as
well as the necessity of facing so great a throng even when one is least
in the mood to do so—all these things are alike foreign to the
principles and fatal to the repose of the monastic life. For when people
come in our way we either see them coming and are compelled to speak, or
we do not see them and lay ourselves open to the charge of haughtiness.
Sometimes, also, in returning visits we are obliged to pass through
proud portals and gilded doors and to face the clamor of carping
lackeys. But, as we have <span id="page_65">p. 65</span> <span
id="v.XLVI-Page_65"></span>said above, in the cottage of Christ all is
simple and rustic: and except for the chanting of psalms there is
complete silence. Wherever one turns the laborer at his plough sings
alleluia, the toiling mower cheers himself with psalms, and the
vine-dresser while he prunes his vine sings one of the lays of David.
These are the songs of the country; these, in popular phrase, its love
ditties: these the shepherd whistles; these the tiller uses to aid his
toil.

<span id="v.XLVI-p91"></span>13. But what are we doing? Forgetting what
is required of us, we are taken up with what we wish. Will the time
never come when a breathless messenger shall bring the news that our
dear Marcella has reached the shores of Palestine, and when every band
of monks and every troop of virgins shall unite in a song of welcome? In
our excitement we are already hurrying to meet you: without waiting for
a vehicle, we hasten off at once on foot. We shall clasp you by the
hand, we shall look upon your face; and when, after long waiting, we at
last embrace you, we shall find it hard to tear ourselves away. Will the
day never come when we shall together enter the Saviour’s cave, and
together weep in the sepulchre of the Lord with His sister and with His
mother? <span id="fr_1007"></span>[1008](#fn_1007.md) Then shall we touch
with our lips the wood of the cross, and rise in prayer and resolve upon
the Mount of Olives with the ascending Lord. <span
id="fr_1008"></span>[1009](#fn_1008.md) We shall see Lazarus come forth
bound with grave clothes, <span id="fr_1009"></span>[1010](#fn_1009.md) we
shall look upon the waters of Jordan purified for the washing of the
Lord. <span id="fr_1010"></span>[1011](#fn_1010.md) Thence we shall pass to
the folds of the shepherds, <span id="fr_1011"></span>[1012](#fn_1011.md)
we shall pray together in the mausoleum of David. <span
id="fr_1012"></span>[1013](#fn_1012.md) We shall see the prophet,
Amos, <span id="fr_1013"></span>[1014](#fn_1013.md) upon his crag blowing
his shepherd’s horn. We shall hasten, if not to the tents, to the
monuments of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and of their three illustrious
wives. <span id="fr_1014"></span>[1015](#fn_1014.md) We shall see the
fountain in which the eunuch was immersed by Philip. <span
id="fr_1015"></span>[1016](#fn_1015.md) We shall make a pilgrimage to
Samaria, and side by side venerate the ashes of John the Baptist, of
Elisha, <span id="fr_1016"></span>[1017](#fn_1016.md) and of Obadiah. We
shall enter the very caves where in the time of persecution and famine
the companies of the prophets were fed. <span
id="fr_1017"></span>[1018](#fn_1017.md) If only you will come, we shall go
to see Nazareth, as its name denotes, the flower <span
id="fr_1018"></span>[1019](#fn_1018.md) of Galilee. Not far off Cana will
be visible, where the water was turned into wine. <span
id="fr_1019"></span>[1020](#fn_1019.md) We shall make our way to
Tabor, <span id="fr_1020"></span>[1021](#fn_1020.md) and see the
tabernacles there which the Saviour shares, not, as Peter once wished,
with Moses and Elijah, but with the Father and with the Holy Ghost.
Thence we shall come to the Sea of Gennesaret, and when there we shall
see the spots where the five thousand were filled with five
loaves, <span id="fr_1021"></span>[1022](#fn_1021.md) and the four thousand
with seven. <span id="fr_1022"></span>[1023](#fn_1022.md) The town of Nain
will meet our eyes, at the gate of which the widow’s son was raised to
life. <span id="fr_1023"></span>[1024](#fn_1023.md) Hermon too will be
visible, and the torrent of Endor, at which Sisera was vanquished. <span
id="fr_1024"></span>[1025](#fn_1024.md) Our eyes will look also on
Capernaum, the scene of so many of our Lord’s signs—yes, and on all
Galilee besides. And when, accompanied by Christ, we shall have made our
way back to our cave through Shiloh and Bethel, and those other places
where churches are set up like standards to commemorate the Lord’s
victories, then we shall sing heartily, we shall weep copiously, we
shall pray unceasingly. Wounded with the Saviour’s shaft, we shall say
one to another: “I have found Him whom my soul loveth; I will hold Him
and will not let Him go.” <span id="fr_1025"></span>[1026](#fn_1025.md)
