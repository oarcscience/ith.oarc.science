<span id="v.CXXIII-p1"></span> <span id="page_230">p. 230</span> <span
id="v.CXXIII-Page_230"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="v.CXXIII-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXIII. To Ageruchia.</span>

<span id="v.CXXIII-p2"></span>An appeal to the widow Ageruchia, highborn
lady of Gaul, not to marry again. It should be compared with the letters
to Furia (LIV.) and to Salvina (LXXIX.) The allusion to Stilicho’s
treaty with Alaric fixes the date to 409 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.CXXIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.CXXIII-p3"></span>1. I must look for a new track on the old
road and devise a natural treatment, the same yet not the same, for a
hackneyed and well-worn theme. <span
id="fr_3217"></span>[3218](#fn_3217.md) It is true that there is but one
road; yet one can often reach one’s goal by striking across country. I
have several times written letters to widows <span
id="fr_3218"></span>[3219](#fn_3218.md) in which for their instruction I
have sought out examples from scripture, weaving its varied flowers into
a single garland of chastity. On the present occasion I address myself
to Ageruchia; whose very name <span id="fr_3219"></span>[3220](#fn_3219.md)
(allotted to her by the divine guidance) has proved a prophecy of her
after-life. Around her stand her grandmother, her mother, and her aunt;
a noble band of tried Christian women. Her grandmother, Metronia, now a
widow for forty years, reminds us of Anna the daughter of Phanuel in the
gospel. <span id="fr_3220"></span>[3221](#fn_3220.md) Her mother, Benigna,
now in the fourteenth year of her widowhood, is surrounded by virgins
whose chastity bears fruit a hundredfold. <span
id="fr_3221"></span>[3222](#fn_3221.md) The sister of Celerinus,
Ageruchia’s father, has nursed her niece from infancy and indeed took
her into her lap the moment that she was born. Deprived of the solace of
her husband she has for twenty years trained her brother’s child,
teaching her the lessons which she has learned from her own mother.

<span id="v.CXXIII-p9"></span>2. I make these brief remarks to shew my
young friend that in resolving not to marry again she does but perform a
duty to her family; and that, while she will deserve no praise for
fulfilling it, she will be justly blamed if she fails to do so. The more
so that she has a posthumous son named after his father Simplicius and
thus cannot plead loneliness or the want of an heir. For the lust of
many shelters itself under such excuses as though the promptings of
incontinence were only a desire for offspring. But why do I speak as to
one who wavers when I hear that Ageruchia seeks the church’s protection
against the many suitors whom she meets in the palace? For the devil
inflames men to vie with one another in proving the chastity of our
beloved widow; and rank and beauty, youth and riches cause her to be
sought after by all. But the greater the assaults that are made upon her
continence, the greater will be the rewards that will follow her
victory.

<span id="v.CXXIII-p10"></span>3. But no sooner do I clear the harbour
than I find my way to the sea barred by a rock. <span
id="fr_3222"></span>[3223](#fn_3222.md) I am confronted with the authority
of the apostle Paul who in writing to Timothy thus speaks concerning
widows: “I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children,
guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak
reproachfully. For some are already turned aside after Satan.” <span
id="fr_3223"></span>[3224](#fn_3223.md) I must accordingly begin by
considering the meaning of this pronouncement and examining the context
of the whole passage. I must then plant my feet in the steps of the
apostle and, as the saying goes, not deviate a hair’s breadth from them
either to this side or to that. He had previously described his ideal
widow as one who had been the wife of one man, who had brought up
children, who was well reported of for good works, who had relieved the
afflicted with her substance, <span id="fr_3224"></span>[3225](#fn_3224.md)
whose trust had been in God, and who had continued in prayer day and
night. <span id="fr_3225"></span>[3226](#fn_3225.md) With her he contrasted
her opposite, saying: “She that liveth in pleasure is dead while she
liveth.” And that he might warn his disciple Timothy with all needful
admonition, he immediately added these words: “the younger widows
refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ they will
marry; having damnation because they have cast off their first
faith.” <span id="fr_3226"></span>[3227](#fn_3226.md) It is then for these
who have outraged Christ their Spouse by committing fornication against
Him (for this is the sense of the Greek word <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.CXXIII-p15.2"></span>καταστρηνιάσωσι</span> )—it is for these that
the apostle wishes a second marriage, thinking digamy preferable to
fornication; but this second marriage is a concession and not a command.

<span id="v.CXXIII-p16"></span>4. We must also take the passage clause
by clause. “I will,” he says, “that the younger women marry.” Why, pray?
because I would not have young women commit fornication. “That they bear
children;” <span id="fr_3227"></span>[3228](#fn_3227.md) for what reason?
That they may not be induced by fear of the consequences to kill
children whom they have conceived in adultery. “That they be the heads
of households.” <span id="fr_3228"></span>[3229](#fn_3228.md) Wherefore,
pray? Because it is much more tolerable that a woman should marry again
than that she should be a prostitute, and better that she should have a
second husband than several paramours. The first alternative brings
relief in a miserable plight, but the second involves a sin and its
punishment. He continues: “that they give none occasion to the adversary
to speak reproachfully,” a brief and comprehen<span id="page_231">p.
231</span> <span id="v.CXXIII-Page_231"></span>sive precept in which
many admonitions are summed up. As for instance these: that a woman must
not bring discredit upon her profession of widowhood by too great
attention to her dress, that she must not draw troops of young men after
her by gay smiles or expressive glances, that she must not profess one
thing by her words and another by her behaviour, that she must give no
ground for the application to herself of the well known line:

<span id="v.CXXIII-p19"></span>She gave a meaning look and slyly
smiled. <span id="fr_3229"></span>[3230](#fn_3229.md)

<span id="v.CXXIII-p21"></span>Lastly, that Paul may compress into a few
words all the reasons for such marriages, he shews the motive of his
command by saying: “for some are already turned aside after Satan.” Thus
he allows to the incontinent a second marriage, or in case of need a
third, simply that he may rescue them from Satan, preferring that a
woman should be joined to the worst of husbands rather than to the
devil. To the Corinthians he uses somewhat similar language: “I say
therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide
even as I. But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better
to marry than to burn.” <span id="fr_3230"></span>[3231](#fn_3230.md) Why,
O apostle, is it better to marry? He answers immediately: because it is
worse to burn. <span id="fr_3231"></span>[3232](#fn_3231.md)

<span id="v.CXXIII-p24"></span>5. Apart from these considerations, that
which is absolutely good and not merely relatively so is to be as the
apostle, that is loose, not bound; free, not enslaved; caring for the
things of God, not for the things of a wife. Immediately afterwards he
adds: “The wife is bound by the law to her husband as long as her
husband liveth, but if her husband be fallen asleep, <span
id="fr_3232"></span>[3233](#fn_3232.md) she is at liberty to be married to
whom she will; only in the Lord. But she is happier if she so abide,
after my judgment: and I think also that I have the spirit of
God.” <span id="fr_3233"></span>[3234](#fn_3233.md) This passage
corresponds with the former in meaning, because the spirit of the two is
the same. For though the epistles are different, they are the work of
one author. While her husband lives the woman is bound, and when he is
dead, she is loosed. Marriage then is a bond, and widowhood is the
loosing of it. The wife is bound to the husband and the husband to the
wife; and so close is the tie that they have no power over their own
bodies, but each stands indebted to the other. They who are under the
yoke of wedlock have not the option of choosing continence. When the
apostle adds the words “only in the Lord,” he excludes heathen marriages
of which he had spoken in another place thus: “be ye not unequally yoked
together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with
unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? and what
concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth
with an infidel? and what agreement hath the temple of God with
idols?” <span id="fr_3234"></span>[3235](#fn_3234.md) We must not plough
with an ox and an ass together; <span
id="fr_3235"></span>[3236](#fn_3235.md) nor weave our wedding garment of
different colours. He at once takes back the concession he made, and, as
if repenting of his opinion, withdraws it by saying: “She is happier if
she so abide,” that is, unmarried; and declares that in his judgment
this course is preferable. And that this may not be made light of as a
merely human utterance, he claims for it the authority of the Holy
Spirit, so that we are listening not to a fellowman making concessions
to the weakness of the flesh but to the Holy Spirit using the apostle
for his mouthpiece.

<span id="v.CXXIII-p29"></span>6. Again, no widow of youthful age must
quiet her qualms of conscience by the plea that he gives commandment
that no widow is to be taken into the number under three-score years
old. <span id="fr_3236"></span>[3237](#fn_3236.md) He does not by this
arrangement urge unmarried girls or youthful widows to marry, seeing
that even of the married he says: “the time is short: it remaineth that
they that have wives be as though they had none.” <span
id="fr_3237"></span>[3238](#fn_3237.md) No, he is speaking of widows who
have relations able to support them, who have sons and grandsons to be
responsible for their maintenance. The apostle commands these latter to
shew piety at home, and to requite their parents and to relieve them
adequately; that the church may not be charged, but may be free to
relieve those that are widows indeed. “Honour widows,” he writes, “that
are widows indeed,” that is, such as are desolate and have no relations
to help them, who cannot labour with their hands, who are weakened by
poverty and overcome by years, whose trust is in God and their only work
prayer. <span id="fr_3238"></span>[3239](#fn_3238.md) From which it is easy
to infer that the younger widows, unless they are excused by ill health,
are either left to their own exertions or else are consigned to the care
of their children or relations. The word ‘honour’ in this passage
implies either alms or a gift, as also in the verse immediately
following: “Let the elders…be counted worthy of double honour,
especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.” <span
id="fr_3239"></span>[3240](#fn_3239.md) So also in the gospel when the Lord
discusses that commandment of the Law which says: “Honour thy father and
thy mother,” <span id="fr_3240"></span>[3241](#fn_3240.md) He declares that
it is to be interpreted not of mere words which while offering an empty
shew of regard may still leave a parent’s wants unrelieved, but of the
actual provision of the necessaries <span id="page_232">p. 232</span>
<span id="v.CXXIII-Page_232"></span>of life. The Lord commanded that
poor parents should be supported by their children and that these should
pay them back when old those benefits which they had themselves received
in their childhood. The scribes and pharisees on the other hand taught
the children to answer their parents by saying: “It is Corban, that is
to say, a gift <span id="fr_3241"></span>[3242](#fn_3241.md) which I have
promised to the altar and engaged to present to the temple: it will
relieve you as much there, as if I were to give it you directly to buy
food.” <span id="fr_3242"></span>[3243](#fn_3242.md) So it frequently
happened that while father and mother were destitute their children were
offering sacrifices for the priests and scribes to consume. If then the
apostle compels poor widows—yet only those who are young and not broken
down by sickness—to labour with their hands that the church, not charged
with their maintenance, may be able to support such widows as are old,
what plea can be urged by one who has abundance of this world’s goods,
both for her own wants and those of others, and who can make to herself
friends of the mammon of unrighteousness able to receive her into
everlasting habitations? <span id="fr_3243"></span>[3244](#fn_3243.md)

<span id="v.CXXIII-p38"></span>Consider too that no one is to be elected
a widow, except she has been the wife of one husband. We sometimes fancy
it to be the distinctive mark of the priesthood that none but
monogamists shall be admitted to the altar. But not only are the
twice-married excluded from the priestly office, they are debarred from
receiving the alms of the church. A woman who has resorted to a second
marriage is held unworthy to be supported by the faithful. And even the
layman is bound by the law of the priest, for his conduct must be such
as to admit of his election to the priesthood. If he has been twice
married, he cannot be so elected. Therefore, as priests are chosen from
the ranks of laymen, the layman also is bound by the commandment,
fulfilment of which is indispensable for the attainment of the
priesthood. <span id="fr_3244"></span>[3245](#fn_3244.md)

<span id="v.CXXIII-p40"></span>7. We must distinguish between what the
apostle himself desires and what he is compelled to acquiesce in. If he
allows me to marry again, this is due to my own incontinence and not to
his wish. For he wishes all men to be as he is, and to think the things
of God, and when once they are loosed no more to seek to be bound. But
when he sees unstable men in danger through their incontinence of
falling into the abyss of lust, he extends to them the offer of a second
marriage; that, if they must wallow in the mire, it may be with one and
not with many. The husband of a second wife must not consider this a
harsh saying or one that conflicts with the rule laid down by the
apostle. The apostle is of two minds: first, he proclaims a command, “I
say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they
abide even as I.” Next. he makes a concession, “But if they cannot
contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.” <span
id="fr_3245"></span>[3246](#fn_3245.md) He first shews what he himself
desires, then that in which he is forced to acquiesce. He wishes
us—after one marriage—to abide even as he, that is, unmarried, and sets
before us in his own apostolic example an instance of the blessedness of
which he speaks. If however he finds that we are unwilling to do as he
wishes, he makes a concession to our incontinence. Which then of the two
alternatives do we choose for ourselves? The one which he prefers and
which is in itself good? Or the one which in comparison with evil is
tolerable, yet as it is only a substitute for evil is not altogether
good? Suppose that we choose that course which the apostle does not wish
but to which he only consents against his will, allowing those who seek
lower ends to have their own way; in this case we carry out not the
apostle’s wish but our own. We read in the old testament that the
daughters of the priests who have been married once and have become
widows are to eat of the priests’ food and that when they die they are
to be buried with the same ceremonies as their father and mother. <span
id="fr_3246"></span>[3247](#fn_3246.md) If on the other hand they take
other husbands they are to be kept apart both from their father and from
the sacrifices and are to be counted as strangers. <span
id="fr_3247"></span>[3248](#fn_3247.md)

<span id="v.CXXIII-p44"></span>8. These restraints on marriage are
observed even among the heathen; and it is our condemnation if the true
faith cannot do for Christ what false ones do for the devil, who has
substituted for the saving chastity of the gospel a damning chastity of
his own. <span id="fr_3248"></span>[3249](#fn_3248.md) The Athenian
hierophant disowns his manhood and weakens his passions by a perpetual
restraint. <span id="fr_3249"></span>[3250](#fn_3249.md) The holy office of
the flamen is limited to those who have been once married, and the
attendants of the flamens’ wives must also have had but one
husband. <span id="fr_3250"></span>[3251](#fn_3250.md) Only monogamists are
allowed to share in the sacred rites connected with the Egyptian
bull. <span id="fr_3251"></span>[3252](#fn_3251.md) I need say nothing of
the vestal virgins and those of Apollo, the Achivan Juno, Diana, and
Minerva, all of whom waste away in the perpetual virginity required by
their vocation. I will just glance at the queen of Carthage <span
id="fr_3252"></span>[3253](#fn_3252.md) who was willing to burn herself
<span id="page_233">p. 233</span> <span
id="v.CXXIII-Page_233"></span>rather than marry king Iarbas; at the wife
of Hasdrubal <span id="fr_3253"></span>[3254](#fn_3253.md) who taking her
two children one in each hand cast, herself into the flames beneath her
rather than surrender her honour; and at Lucretia <span
id="fr_3254"></span>[3255](#fn_3254.md) who having lost the prize of her
chastity refused to survive the defilement of her soul. I will not
lengthen my letter by quoting the many instances of the like virtue
which you can read to your profit in my first book against
Jovinian. <span id="fr_3255"></span>[3256](#fn_3255.md) I will merely
relate one which took place in your own country and which will shew you
that chastity is held in high honour even among wild and barbarous and
cruel peoples. Once the Teutons who came from the remote shores of the
German Ocean overran all parts of Gaul, and it was only when they had
cut to pieces several Roman armies that Marius at last defeated them in
an encounter at Aquæ Sextiæ. <span id="fr_3256"></span>[3257](#fn_3256.md)
By the conditions of the surrender three hundred of their married women
were to be handed over to the Romans. When the Teuton matrons heard of
this stipulation they first begged the consul that they might be set
apart to minister in the temples of Ceres and Venus; <span
id="fr_3257"></span>[3258](#fn_3257.md) and then when they failed to obtain
their request and were removed by the lictors, they slew their little
children and next morning were all found dead in each other’s arms
having strangled themselves in the night. <span
id="fr_3258"></span>[3259](#fn_3258.md)

<span id="v.CXXIII-p56"></span>9. Shall then a highborn lady do what
these barbarian women refused to do even as prisoners of war? After
losing a first husband, good or bad as the case may be, shall she make
trial of a second, and thus run counter to the judgment of God? And in
case that she immediately loses this second, shall she take a third? And
if he too is called to his rest, shall she go on to a fourth and a
fifth, and by so doing identify herself with the harlots? No, a widow
must take every precaution not to overstep by an inch the bounds of
chastity. For if she once oversteps them and breaks through the modesty
which becomes a matron, she will soon riot in every kind of excess; so
much so that the prophet’s words shall be true of her “Thou hast a
whore’s forehead, thou refusest to be ashamed.” <span
id="fr_3259"></span>[3260](#fn_3259.md)

<span id="v.CXXIII-p58"></span>What then? do I condemn second marriages?
not at all; but I commend first ones. Do I expel twice-married persons
from the church? Far from it; but I urge those who have been once
married to lives of continence. The Ark of Noah contained unclean
animals as well as clean. It contained both creeping things and human
beings. In a great house there are vessels of different kinds, some to
honour and some to dishonour. <span id="fr_3260"></span>[3261](#fn_3260.md)
In the gospel parable the seed sown in the good ground brings forth
fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. <span
id="fr_3261"></span>[3262](#fn_3261.md) The hundredfold which comes first
betokens the crown of virginity; the sixtyfold which comes next refers
to the work of widows; while the thirtyfold—indicated by joining
together the points of the thumb and forefinger <span
id="fr_3262"></span>[3263](#fn_3262.md) —denotes the marriage-tie. What
room is left for double marriages? None. They are not counted. Such
weeds do not grow in good ground but among briers and thorns, the
favourite haunts of those foxes to whom the Lord compares the impious
Herod. <span id="fr_3263"></span>[3264](#fn_3263.md) A woman who marries
more than once fancies herself worthy of praise because she is not so
bad as the prostitutes, because she compares favourably with these
victims of indiscriminate lust by surrendering herself to one alone and
not to a number.

<span id="v.CXXIII-p63"></span>10. The story which I am about to relate
is an incredible one; yet it is vouched for by many witnesses. A great
many years ago when I was helping Damasus bishop of Rome with his
ecclesiastical correspondence, and writing his answers to the questions
referred to him by the councils of the east and west, I saw a married
couple, both of whom were sprung from the very dregs of the people. The
man had already buried twenty wives, and the woman had had twenty-two
husbands. Now they were united to each other as each believed for the
last time. The greatest curiosity prevailed both among men and women to
see which of these two veterans would live to bury the other. The
husband triumphed and walked before the bier of his often-married wife,
amid a great concourse of people from all quarters, with garland and
palm-branch, scattering spelt as he went along among an approving crowd.
What shall we say to such a woman as that? Surely just what the Lord
said to the woman of Samaria: “Thou hast had twenty-two husbands, and he
by whom you are now buried is not your husband.” <span
id="fr_3264"></span>[3265](#fn_3264.md)

<span id="v.CXXIII-p65"></span>11. I beseech you therefore, my devout
daughter in Christ, not to dwell on those passages which offer succour
to the incontinent and the unhappy but rather to read those in which
chastity is crowned. It is enough for you that you have lost the first
and highest kind, that of virginity, and that you have passed through
the third to the second; that is to say, having formerly fulfilled the
obligations of a wife, that you now live in continence as a widow. Think
not of the <span id="page_234">p. 234</span> <span
id="v.CXXIII-Page_234"></span>lowest grade, nay of that which does not
count at all, I mean, second marriage; and do not seek for far fetched
precedents to justify you in marrying again. You cannot too closely
imitate your grandmother, your mother, and your aunt; whose teaching and
advice as to life will form for you a rule of virtue. For if many wives
in the lifetime of their husbands come to realize the truth of the
apostle’s words: “all things are lawful unto me but all things are not
expedient,” <span id="fr_3265"></span>[3266](#fn_3265.md) and make eunuchs
of themselves for the kingdom of heaven’s sake <span
id="fr_3266"></span>[3267](#fn_3266.md) either by consent after their
regeneration through the baptismal laver, or else in the ardour of their
faith immediately after their marriage; why should not a widow, who by
God’s decree has ceased to have a husband, joyfully cry again and again
with Job: “the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away,” <span
id="fr_3267"></span>[3268](#fn_3267.md) and seize the opportunity offered
to her of having power over her own body instead of again becoming the
servant of a man. Assuredly it is much harder to abstain from enjoying
what you have than it is to regret what you have lost. Virginity is the
easier because virgins know nothing of the promptings of the flesh, and
widowhood is the harder because widows cannot help thinking of the
license they have enjoyed in the past. And it is harder still if they
suppose their husbands to be lost and not gone before; for while the
former alternative brings pain, the latter causes joy.

<span id="v.CXXIII-p69"></span>12. The creation of the first man should
teach us to reject more marriages than one. There was but one Adam and
but one Eve; in fact the woman was fashioned from a rib of Adam. <span
id="fr_3268"></span>[3269](#fn_3268.md) Thus divided they were subsequently
joined together in marriage; in the words of scripture “the twain shall
be one flesh,” not two or three. “Therefore shall a man leave his father
and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife.” <span
id="fr_3269"></span>[3270](#fn_3269.md) Certainly it is not said “to his
wives.” Paul in explaining the passage refers it to Christ and the
church; <span id="fr_3270"></span>[3271](#fn_3270.md) making the first Adam
a monogamist in the flesh and the second a monogamist in the spirit. As
there is one Eve who is “the mother of all living,” <span
id="fr_3271"></span>[3272](#fn_3271.md) so is there one church which is the
parent of all Christians. And as the accursed Lamech made of the first
Eve two separate wives, <span id="fr_3272"></span>[3273](#fn_3272.md) so
also the heretics sever the second into several churches which,
according to the apocalypse of John, ought rather to be called
synagogues of the devil than congregations of Christ. <span
id="fr_3273"></span>[3274](#fn_3273.md) In the Book of Songs we read as
follows:—“there are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and
virgins without number. My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the
only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare
her.” <span id="fr_3274"></span>[3275](#fn_3274.md) It is to this choice
one that the same John addresses an epistle in these words, “the elder
unto the elect lady and her children.” <span
id="fr_3275"></span>[3276](#fn_3275.md) So too in the case of the ark which
the apostle Peter interprets as a type of the church, <span
id="fr_3276"></span>[3277](#fn_3276.md) Noah brings in for his three sons
one wife apiece and not two. <span id="fr_3277"></span>[3278](#fn_3277.md)
Likewise of the unclean animals pairs only are taken, male and female,
to shew that digamy has no place even among brutes, creeping things,
crocodiles and lizards. And if of the clean animals there are seven
taken of each kind, <span id="fr_3278"></span>[3279](#fn_3278.md) that is,
an uneven number; this points to the palm which awaits virginal
chastity. For on leaving the ark Noah sacrificed victims to God <span
id="fr_3279"></span>[3280](#fn_3279.md) not of course of the animals taken
by twos for these were kept to multiply their species, but of those
taken by sevens some of which had been set apart for sacrifice.

<span id="v.CXXIII-p82"></span>13. It is true that the patriarchs had
each of them more wives than one and that they had numerous concubines
besides. And as if their example was not enough, David had many wives
and Solomon a countless number. Judah went in to Tamar thinking her to
be a harlot; <span id="fr_3280"></span>[3281](#fn_3280.md) and according to
the letter that killeth the prophet Hosea married not only a whore but
an adulteress. <span id="fr_3281"></span>[3282](#fn_3281.md) If these
instances are to justify us let us neigh after every woman that we
meet; <span id="fr_3282"></span>[3283](#fn_3282.md) like the people of
Sodom and Gomorrah let us be found by the last day buying and selling,
marrying and giving in marriage; <span
id="fr_3283"></span>[3284](#fn_3283.md) and let us only end our marrying
with the close of our lives. And if both before and after the deluge the
maxim held good: “be fruitful and multiply and replenish the
earth:” <span id="fr_3284"></span>[3285](#fn_3284.md) what has that to do
with us upon whom the ends of the ages are come, <span
id="fr_3285"></span>[3286](#fn_3285.md) unto whom it is said, “the time is
short,” <span id="fr_3286"></span>[3287](#fn_3286.md) and “now the axe is
laid unto the root of the trees;” <span
id="fr_3287"></span>[3288](#fn_3287.md) that is to say, the forests of
marriage and of the law must be cut down by the chastity of the gospel.
There is “a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from
embracing.” <span id="fr_3288"></span>[3289](#fn_3288.md) Owing to the near
approach of the captivity Jeremiah is forbidden to take a wife. <span
id="fr_3289"></span>[3290](#fn_3289.md) In Babylon Ezekiel says: “my wife
is dead and my mouth is opened.” <span
id="fr_3290"></span>[3291](#fn_3290.md) Neither he who wished to marry nor
he who had married could in wedlock prophesy freely. In days gone by men
rejoiced to hear it said of them: “thy children shall be like olive
plants <span id="page_235">p. 235</span> <span
id="v.CXXIII-Page_235"></span>round about thy table,” and “thou shalt
see thy children’s children.” <span id="fr_3291"></span>[3292](#fn_3291.md)
But now it is said of those who live in continence: “he that is joined
unto the Lord is one spirit;” <span id="fr_3292"></span>[3293](#fn_3292.md)
and “my soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth
me.” <span id="fr_3293"></span>[3294](#fn_3293.md) Then it was said “an eye
for an eye;” now the commandment is “whosoever shall smite thee on thy
right cheek, turn to him the other also.” <span
id="fr_3294"></span>[3295](#fn_3294.md) In those days men said to the
warrior: “gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty;” <span
id="fr_3295"></span>[3296](#fn_3295.md) now it is said to Peter: “put up
again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall
perish with the sword.” <span id="fr_3296"></span>[3297](#fn_3296.md)

<span id="v.CXXIII-p100"></span>In speaking thus I do not mean to sever
the law from the gospel, as Marcion <span
id="fr_3297"></span>[3298](#fn_3297.md) falsely does. No, I receive one and
the same God in both who, as the time and the object vary, is both the
Beginning and the End, who sows that He may reap, who plants that He may
have somewhat to cut down, and who lays the foundation that in the
fulness of time He may crown the edifice. Besides, if we are to deal
with symbols and types of things to come, we must judge of them not by
our own opinions but in the light of the apostle’s explanations. Hagar
and Sarah, or Sinai and Zion, are typical of the two testaments. <span
id="fr_3298"></span>[3299](#fn_3298.md) Leah who was tender-eyed and Rachel
whom Jacob loved <span id="fr_3299"></span>[3300](#fn_3299.md) signify the
synagogue and the church. So likewise do Hannah and Peninnah of whom the
former, at first barren, afterwards exceeded the latter in fruitfulness.
In Isaac and Rebekah we see an early example of monogamy: it was only to
Rebekah that the Lord revealed Himself in the hour of childbirth and she
alone went of herself to enquire of the Lord. <span
id="fr_3300"></span>[3301](#fn_3300.md) What shall I say of Tamar who bore
twin sons, Pharez and Zarah? <span id="fr_3301"></span>[3302](#fn_3301.md)
At their birth was broken down that middle wall of partition which
typified the division existing between the two peoples; <span
id="fr_3302"></span>[3303](#fn_3302.md) while the binding of Zarah’s hand
with the scarlet thread even then marked the conscience of the Jews with
the stain of Christ’s blood. And how shall I speak of the whore married
by the prophet <span id="fr_3303"></span>[3304](#fn_3303.md) who is a
figure either of the church as gathered in from the Gentiles or—an
interpretation which better suits the passage—of the synagogue? First
adopted from among the idolaters by Abraham and Moses, this has now
denied the Saviour and proved unfaithful to Him. Therefore it has long
been deprived of its altar, priests, and prophets and has to abide many
days for its first husband. <span id="fr_3304"></span>[3305](#fn_3304.md)
For when the fulness of the Gentiles shall have come in, all Israel
shall be saved. <span id="fr_3305"></span>[3306](#fn_3305.md)

<span id="v.CXXIII-p110"></span>14. I have tried to compress a great
deal into a limited space as a draughtsman does when he delineates a
large country in a small map. For I wish to deal with other questions,
the first of which I shall give in Anna’s words to her sister Dido:

<span id="v.CXXIII-p111"></span>Why waste your youth alone in ceaseless
grief

<span id="v.CXXIII-p112"></span>Unblest with offspring, sweetest gift of
love?

<span id="v.CXXIII-p113"></span>Think you the buried dead require this?

<span id="v.CXXIII-p114"></span>To whom the sufferer thus briefly
replies:

<span id="v.CXXIII-p115"></span>’Twas you, my sister, you, who were the
first

<span id="v.CXXIII-p116"></span>To plunge my frenzied soul into this
woe.

<span id="v.CXXIII-p117"></span>Why could I not have lived a virgin life

<span id="v.CXXIII-p118"></span>Like some wild creature innocent of
care?

<span id="v.CXXIII-p119"></span>Alas! I pledged my soul unto the dead:

<span id="v.CXXIII-p120"></span>I vowed a vow and I have broken
it. <span id="fr_3306"></span>[3307](#fn_3306.md)

<span id="v.CXXIII-p122"></span>You set before me the joys of wedlock. I
for my part will remind you of Dido’s sword and pyre and funeral flames.
In marriage there is not so much good to be hoped for as there is evil
which may happen and must be feared. Passion when indulged always brings
repentance with it; it is never satisfied, and once quenched it is soon
kindled anew. Its growth or decay is a matter of habit; led like a
captive by impulse it refuses to obey reason. But you will argue, ‘the
management of wealth and property requires the superintendence of a
husband.’ Do you mean to say that the affairs of those who live single
are ruined; and that, unless you make yourself as much a slave as your
own servants, you will not be able to govern your household? Do not your
grandmother, your mother and your aunt enjoy even more than their old
influence and respect, looked up to as they are by the whole province
and by the leaders of the churches? Do not soldiers and travellers
manage their domestic affairs and give entertainments to one another
with no wives to help them? <span id="fr_3307"></span>[3308](#fn_3307.md)
Why can you not have grave and elderly servants or freed-men, such as
those who have nursed you in your childhood, to preside over your house,
to answer public calls, to pay taxes; men who will look up to you as a
patroness, who will love you as a nursling, who will revere you as a
saint? “Seek first the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be
added unto you.” <span id="fr_3308"></span>[3309](#fn_3308.md) If you are
careful for raiment the gospel bids you “consider the lilies;” and, if
for food, to go back to the fowls which “sow not neither do they reap;
yet your heavenly father feedeth them.” <span
id="fr_3309"></span>[3310](#fn_3309.md) How many virgins and widows there
are who have looked after their property for <span id="page_236">p.
236</span> <span id="v.CXXIII-Page_236"></span>themselves without
thereby incurring any stain of scandal!

<span id="v.CXXIII-p126"></span>15. Do not associate with young women or
cleave to them, for it is on account of such that the apostle makes his
concession of second marriage, and so you may be shipwrecked in what
appears to be calm water. If Paul can say to Timothy, “the younger
widows refuse,” <span id="fr_3310"></span>[3311](#fn_3310.md) and again
“love the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all
purity,” <span id="fr_3311"></span>[3312](#fn_3311.md) what plea can you
urge for refusing to hear my admonitions? Avoid all persons to whom a
suspicion of evil living may attach itself, and do not content yourself
with the trite answer, ‘my own conscience is enough for me; I do not
care what people say of me.’ That was not the principle on which the
apostle acted. He provided things honest not only in the sight of God
but in the sight of all men; <span id="fr_3312"></span>[3313](#fn_3312.md)
that the name of God might not be blasphemed among the Gentiles. <span
id="fr_3313"></span>[3314](#fn_3313.md) Though he had power to lead about a
sister, a wife, <span id="fr_3314"></span>[3315](#fn_3314.md) he would not
do so, for he did not wish to be judged by an unbeliever’s
conscience. <span id="fr_3315"></span>[3316](#fn_3315.md) And, though he
might have lived by the gospel, <span
id="fr_3316"></span>[3317](#fn_3316.md) he laboured day and night with his
own hands, that he might not be burdensome to the believers. <span
id="fr_3317"></span>[3318](#fn_3317.md) “If meat,” he says, “make my
brother to offend. I will eat no flesh while the world standeth.” <span
id="fr_3318"></span>[3319](#fn_3318.md) Let us then say, if a sister or a
brother causes not one or two but the whole church to offend, ‘I will
not see that sister or that brother.’ It is better to lose a portion of
one’s substance than to imperil the salvation of one’s soul. It is
better to lose that which some day, whether we like it or not, must be
lost to us and to give it up freely, than to lose that for which we
should sacrifice all that we have. Which of us can add—I will not say a
cubit for that would be an immense addition—but the tenth part of a
single inch to his stature? Why are we careful what we shall eat or what
we shall drink? Let us “take no thought for the morrow: sufficient unto
the day is the evil thereof.” <span id="fr_3319"></span>[3320](#fn_3319.md)

<span id="v.CXXIII-p137"></span>Jacob in his flight from his brother
left behind in his father’s house great riches and made his way with
nothing into Mesopotamia. Moreover, to prove to us his powers of
endurance, he took a stone for his pillow. Yet as he lay there he beheld
a ladder set up on the earth reaching to heaven and behold the Lord
stood above it, and the angels ascended and descended on it; <span
id="fr_3320"></span>[3321](#fn_3320.md) the lesson being thus taught that
the sinner must not despair of salvation nor the righteous man rest
secure in his virtue. <span id="fr_3321"></span>[3322](#fn_3321.md) To pass
over much of the story (for there is no time to explain all the points
in the narrative) after twenty years he who before had passed over
Jordan with his staff returned into his native land with three droves of
cattle, rich in flocks and herds and richer still in children. <span
id="fr_3322"></span>[3323](#fn_3322.md) The apostles likewise travelled
throughout the world without either money in their purses, or staves in
their hands, or shoes on their feet; <span
id="fr_3323"></span>[3324](#fn_3323.md) and yet they could speak of
themselves as “having nothing and yet possessing all things.” <span
id="fr_3324"></span>[3325](#fn_3324.md) “Silver and gold,” say they, “have
we none, but such as we have give we thee: in the name of Jesus Christ
of Nazareth rise up and walk.” <span
id="fr_3325"></span>[3326](#fn_3325.md) For they were not weighed down with
the burthen of riches. Therefore they could stand, as Elijah, in the
crevice of the rock, they could pass through the needle’s eye, and
behold the back parts of the Lord. <span
id="fr_3326"></span>[3327](#fn_3326.md)

<span id="v.CXXIII-p145"></span>But as for us we burn with covetousness
and, even while we declaim against the love of money, we hold out our
skirts to catch gold and never have enough. <span
id="fr_3327"></span>[3328](#fn_3327.md) There is a common saying about the
Megarians which may rightly be applied to all who suffer from this
passion: “They build as if they are to live forever; they live as if
they are to die to-morrow.” We do the same, for we do not believe the
Lord’s words. When we attain the age which all desire we forget the
nearness of that death which as human beings we owe to nature and with
futile hope promise to ourselves a long length of years. No old man is
so weak and decrepit as to suppose that he will not live for one year
more. A forgetfulness of his true condition gradually creeps upon him;
so that—earthly creature that he is and close to dissolution as he
stands—he is lifted up into pride, and in imagination seats himself in
heaven.

<span id="v.CXXIII-p147"></span>16. But what am I doing? Whilst I talk
about the cargo, the vessel itself founders. He that letteth <span
id="fr_3328"></span>[3329](#fn_3328.md) is taken out of the way, and yet we
do not realize that Antichrist is near. Yes, Antichrist is near whom the
Lord Jesus Christ “shall consume with the spirit of his mouth.” <span
id="fr_3329"></span>[3330](#fn_3329.md) “Woe unto them,” he cries, “that
are with child, and to them that give suck in those days.” <span
id="fr_3330"></span>[3331](#fn_3330.md) Now these things are both the
fruits of marriage.

<span id="v.CXXIII-p151"></span>I shall now say a few words of our
present miseries. A few of us have hitherto survived them, but this is
due not to anything we have done ourselves but to the mercy of the Lord.
Savage tribes in countless numbers have over<span id="page_237">p.
237</span> <span id="v.CXXIII-Page_237"></span>run all parts of Gaul.
The whole country between the Alps and the Pyrenees, between the Rhine
and the Ocean, has been laid waste by hordes of Quadi, Vandals,
Sarmatians, Alans, Gepids, Herules, Saxons, Burgundians, Allemanni
and—alas! for the commonweal!—even Pannonians. For “Assur also is joined
with them.” <span id="fr_3331"></span>[3332](#fn_3331.md) The once noble
city of Moguntiacum <span id="fr_3332"></span>[3333](#fn_3332.md) has been
captured and destroyed. In its church many thousands have been
massacred. The people of Vangium <span
id="fr_3333"></span>[3334](#fn_3333.md) after standing a long siege have
been extirpated. The powerful city of Rheims, the Ambiani, the
Altrebatæ, <span id="fr_3334"></span>[3335](#fn_3334.md) the Belgians on
the skirts of the world, Tournay, Spires, and Strasburg have fallen to
Germany: while the provinces of Aquitaine and of the Nine Nations, of
Lyons and of Narbonne are with the exception of a few cities one
universal scene of desolation. And those which the sword spares without,
famine ravages within. I cannot speak without tears of Toulouse which
has been kept from falling hitherto by the merits of its reverend bishop
Exuperius. <span id="fr_3335"></span>[3336](#fn_3335.md) Even the Spains
are on the brink of ruin and tremble daily as they recall the invasion
of the Cymry; and, while others suffer misfortunes once in actual fact,
they suffer them continually in anticipation.

<span id="v.CXXIII-p157"></span>17. I say nothing of other places that I
may not seem to despair of God’s mercy. All that is ours now from the
Pontic Sea to the Julian Alps in days gone by once ceased to be ours.
For thirty years the barbarians burst the barrier of the Danube and
fought in the heart of the Roman Empire. Long use dried our tears. For
all but a few old people had been born either in captivity or during a
blockade, and consequently they did not miss a liberty which they had
never known. Yet who will hereafter credit the fact or what histories
will seriously discuss it, that Rome has to fight within her own borders
not for glory but for bare life; and that she does not even fight but
buys the right to exist by giving gold and sacrificing all her
substance? This humiliation has been brought upon her not by the fault
of her Emperors <span id="fr_3336"></span>[3337](#fn_3336.md) who are both
most religious men, but by the crime of a half-barbarian traitor <span
id="fr_3337"></span>[3338](#fn_3337.md) who with our money has armed our
foes against us. <span id="fr_3338"></span>[3339](#fn_3338.md) Of old the
Roman Empire was branded with eternal shame because after ravaging the
country and routing the Romans at the Allia, Brennus with his Gauls
entered Rome itself. <span id="fr_3339"></span>[3340](#fn_3339.md) Nor
could this ancient stain be wiped out until Gaul, the birth-place of the
Gauls, and Gaulish Greece, <span id="fr_3340"></span>[3341](#fn_3340.md)
wherein they had settled after triumphing over East and West, were
subjugated to her sway. Even Hannibal <span
id="fr_3341"></span>[3342](#fn_3341.md) who swept like a devastating storm
from Spain into Italy, although he came within sight of the city, did
not dare to lay siege to it. Even Pyrrhus <span
id="fr_3342"></span>[3343](#fn_3342.md) was so completely bound by the
spell of the Roman name that destroying everything that came in his way,
he yet withdrew from its vicinity and, victor though he was, did not
presume to gaze upon what he had learned to be a city of kings. Yet in
return for such insults—not to say such haughty pride—as theirs which
ended thus happily for Rome, one <span
id="fr_3343"></span>[3344](#fn_3343.md) banished from all the world found
death at last by poison in Bithynia; while the other <span
id="fr_3344"></span>[3345](#fn_3344.md) returning to his native land was
slain in his own dominions. The countries of both became tributary to
the Roman people. But now, even if complete success attends our arms, we
can wrest nothing from our vanquished foes but what we have already lost
to them. The poet Lucan describing the power of the city in a glowing
passage says: <span id="fr_3345"></span>[3346](#fn_3345.md)

<span id="v.CXXIII-p168"></span>If Rome be weak, where shall we look for
strength?

<span id="v.CXXIII-p169"></span>we may vary his words and say:

<span id="v.CXXIII-p170"></span>If Rome be lost, where shall we look for
help?

<span id="v.CXXIII-p171"></span>or quote the language of Virgil:

<span id="v.CXXIII-p172"></span>Had I a hundred tongues and throat of
bronze

<span id="v.CXXIII-p173"></span>The woes of captives I could not relate

<span id="v.CXXIII-p174"></span>Or ev’n recount the names of all the
slain. <span id="fr_3346"></span>[3347](#fn_3346.md)

<span id="v.CXXIII-p176"></span>Even what I have said is fraught with
danger both to me who say it and to all who hear it; for we are no
longer free even to lament our fate, and are unwilling, nay, I may even
say, afraid to weep for our sufferings.

<span id="v.CXXIII-p177"></span>Dearest daughter in Christ, answer me
this question: will you marry amid such scenes as these? Tell me, what
kind of husband will you take? One that will run or one that will fight?
In either case you know what the result will be. Instead of the
Fescennine song, <span id="fr_3347"></span>[3348](#fn_3347.md) the hoarse
blare of the terrible trumpet will deafen your ears and your very
brideswomen may be turned into mourners. In what pleasures can you hope
to revel now that you have lost the proceeds of all your possessions,
now that you see your small retinue under close blockade and a prey to
the inroads of pestilence and famine? But far be it from me to think so
meanly of you or to harbour any suspicions of one who has dedicated her
soul to the Lord. Though nomin<span id="page_238">p. 238</span> <span
id="v.CXXIII-Page_238"></span>ally addressed to you my words are really
meant for others such as are idle, inquisitive and given to gossip.
These wander from house to house and from one married lady to
another, <span id="fr_3348"></span>[3349](#fn_3348.md) their god is their
belly and their glory is in their shame, <span
id="fr_3349"></span>[3350](#fn_3349.md) of the scriptures they know nothing
except the texts which favour second marriages, but they love to quote
the example of others to justify their own self-indulgence, and flatter
themselves that they are no worse than their fellow-sinners. When you
have confounded the shameless proposals of such women by explaining the
true drift of the apostle’s meaning; then to show you by what mode of
life you can best preserve your widowhood, you may read with advantage
what I have written. I mean my treatise on the preservation of virginity
addressed to Eustochium <span id="fr_3350"></span>[3351](#fn_3350.md) and
my two letters to Furia <span id="fr_3351"></span>[3352](#fn_3351.md) and
Salvina. <span id="fr_3352"></span>[3353](#fn_3352.md) Of these two latter
you may like to know that the first is daughter-in-law to Probus some
time consul, and the second daughter to Gildo formerly governour of
Africa. This tract on monogamy I shall call by your name.
