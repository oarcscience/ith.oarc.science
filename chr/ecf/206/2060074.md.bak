<span id="v.LXIII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.LXIII-p1.1"></span>Letter LXIII. To Theophilus.</span>

<span id="v.LXIII-p2"></span>When the dispute arose between Jerome and
Epiphanius on the one side and Rufinus and John of Jerusalem on the
other (see Letter LI.), Theophilus bishop of Alexandria, being appealed
to by the latter sent the presbyter Isidore to report to him on the
matter. Isidore reported against Jerome and consequently Theophilus
refused to answer several of his letters. Finally he wrote counselling
him to obey the canons of the church. Jerome replies that to do this has
always been his first object. He then remonstrates with Theophilus on
his too great leniency towards the Origenists and declares it to be
productive of the worst results. The date of the letter is probably 397
<span class="c17"><span id="v.LXIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.LXIII-p3"></span>Jerome to the most blessed pope <span
id="fr_1911"></span>[1912](#fn_1911.md) Theophilus.

<span id="v.LXIII-p5"></span>1. Your holiness will remember that at the
time when you kept silence towards me, I never ceased to do my duty by
writing to you, not taking so much into account what you in the exercise
of your discretion were then doing as what it became me to do. And now
that I have received a letter from your grace, I see that my reading of
the gospel has not been without fruit. For if the frequent prayers of a
woman changed the determination of an unyielding judge, <span
id="fr_1912"></span>[1913](#fn_1912.md) how much more must my constant
appeals have softened a fatherly heart like yours?

<span id="v.LXIII-p7"></span>2. I thank you for your reminder concerning
the canons of the Church. Truly, “whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth,
and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.” <span
id="fr_1913"></span>[1914](#fn_1913.md) Still I would assure you that
nothing is more my aim than to maintain the rights of Christ, to keep to
the lines laid down by the fathers, and always to remember the faith of
Rome; that faith which is praised by the lips of an apostle, <span
id="fr_1914"></span>[1915](#fn_1914.md) and of which the Alexandrian church
boasts to be a sharer.

<span id="v.LXIII-p10"></span>3. Many religious persons are displeased
that you are so long-suffering in regard to that shocking heresy, <span
id="fr_1915"></span>[1916](#fn_1915.md) and that you suppose yourself able
by such lenity to amend those who are attacking the Church’s vitals.
They believe that, while you are waiting for the penitence of a few,
your action is fostering the boldness of abandoned men and making their
party stronger. Farewell in Christ.
