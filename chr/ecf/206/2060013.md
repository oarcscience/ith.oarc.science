<span id="v.II-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.II-p1.1"></span>Letter II. To Theodosius and the Rest of the
Anchorites.</span>

<span id="v.II-p2"></span>Written from Antioch, 374 <span
class="c17"><span id="v.II-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>, while Jerome was
still in doubt as to his future course. Theodosius appears to have been
the head of the solitaries in the Syrian Desert.

<span id="v.II-p3"></span>How I long to be a member of your company, and
with uplifting of all my powers to embrace your admirable community!
Though, indeed, these poor eyes are not worthy to look upon it. Oh! that
I could behold the desert, lovelier to me than any city! Oh! that I
could see those lonely spots made into a paradise by the saints that
throng them! But since my sins prevent me from thrusting into your
blessed company a head laden with every transgression, I adjure you (and
I know that you can do it) by your prayers to deliver me from the
darkness of this world. I spoke of this when I was with you, and now in
writing to you I repeat anew the same request; for all the energy of my
mind is devoted to this one object. It rests with you to give effect to
my resolve. I have the will but not the power; this last can only come
in answer to your prayers. For my part, I am like a sick sheep astray
from the flock. Unless the good Shepherd shall place me on his shoulders
and carry me back to the fold, <span id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md) my
steps will totter, and in the very effort of rising I shall find my feet
give way. I am the prodigal son <span id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) who
although I have squandered all the portion entrusted to me by my father,
have not yet bowed the knee in submission to him; not yet have I
commenced to put away from me the allurements of my former excesses. And
because it is only a little while since I have begun not so much to
abandon my vices as to desire to abandon them, the devil now ensnares me
in new toils, he puts new stumbling-blocks in my path, he encompasses me
on every side.

<span id="v.II-p6"></span>The seas around, and all around the
main. <span id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md)

<span id="v.II-p8"></span>I find myself in mid-ocean, unwilling to
retreat and unable to advance. It only remains that your prayers should
win for me the gale of the Holy Spirit to waft me to the haven upon the
desired shore.
