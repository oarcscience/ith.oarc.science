<span id="v.VI-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.VI-p1.1"></span>Letter VI. To Julian, a Deacon of Antioch.</span>

<span id="v.VI-p2"></span>This letter, written in 374 <span
class="c17"><span id="v.VI-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>, is chiefly
interesting for its mention of Jerome’s sister. It would seem that she
had fallen into sin and had been restored to a life of virtue by the
deacon, Julian. Jerome speaks of her again in the next letter (§4).

<span id="v.VI-p3"></span>It is an old saying, “Liars are disbelieved
even when they speak the truth.” <span id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84.md)
And from the way in which you reproach me for not having written, I
perceive that this has been my lot with you. Shall I say, “I wrote
often, but the bearers of my letters were negligent”? You will reply,
“Your excuse is the old one of all who fail to write.” Shall I say, “I
could not find any one to take my letters”? You will say that numbers of
persons have gone from my part of the world to yours. Shall I contend
that I have actually given them letters? They not having delivered them,
will deny that they have received them. Moreover, so great a distance
separates us that it will be hard to come at the truth. What shall I do
then? Though really not to blame, I ask your forgiveness, for I think it
better to fall back and make overtures for peace than to keep my ground
and offer battle. The truth is that constant sickness of body and
vexation of mind have so weakened me that with death so close at hand I
have not been as collected as usual. And lest you should account this
plea a false one, now that I have stated my case, I shall, like a
pleader, call witnesses to prove it. Our reverend brother, Heliodorus,
has been here; but in spite of his wish to dwell in the desert with me,
he has been frightened away by my crimes. But my present wordiness will
atone for my past remissness; for, as Horace says in his satire: <span
id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85.md)

<span id="v.VI-p6"></span>All singers have one fault among their
friends:

<span id="v.VI-p7"></span>They never sing when asked, unasked they never
cease.

<span id="v.VI-p8"></span>Henceforth I shall overwhelm you with such
bundles of letters that you will take the opposite line and beg me not
to write.

<span id="v.VI-p9"></span>I rejoice that my sister <span
id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86.md) —to you a daughter in Christ—remains
steadfast in her purpose, a piece of news which I owe in the first
instance to you. For here where I now am I am ignorant not only as to
what goes on in my native land, but even as to its continued existence.
Even though the Iberian viper <span id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87.md) shall
rend me with his baneful fangs, I will not fear men’s judgment, seeing
that I shall have God to judge me. As one puts it:

<span id="v.VI-p12"></span>Shatter the world to fragments if you will:

<span id="v.VI-p13"></span>’Twill fall upon a head which knows not
fear. <span id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88.md)

<span id="v.VI-p15"></span>Bear in mind, then, I pray you, the apostle’s
precept <span id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md) that we should make our
work abiding; prepare for yourself a reward from the Lord in my sister’s
salvation; and by frequent letters increase my joy in that glory in
Christ which we share together.
