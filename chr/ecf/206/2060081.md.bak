id="v.LXX-p1.1"></span>Letter LXX. To Magnus an Orator of Rome.</span>

<span id="v.LXX-p2"></span>Jerome thanks Magnus, a Roman orator, for his
services in bringing a young man named Sebesius to apologize to him for
some fault that he had committed. He then replies to a criticism of
Magnus on his fondness for making quotations from profane writers, a
practice which he defends by the example of the fathers of the church
and of the inspired penmen of scripture. He ends by hinting that the
objection really comes not from Magnus himself but from Rufinus (here
nicknamed Calpurnius Lanarius). The date of the letter is 397 <span
class="c17"><span id="v.LXX-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.LXX-p3"></span>1. That our friend Sebesius has profited by
your advice I have learned less from your letter than from his own
penitence. And strange to say the pleasure which he has given me since
his rebuke is greater than the pain he caused me from his previous
waywardness. There has been indeed a conflict between indulgence in the
father, and affection in the son; while the former is anxious to forget
the past, the latter is eager to promise dutiful behaviour in the
future. Accordingly you and I must equally rejoice, you because you have
successfully put a pupil to the test, I because I have received a son
again.

<span id="v.LXX-p4"></span>2. You ask me at the close of your letter why
it is that sometimes in my writings I quote examples from secular
literature and thus defile the whiteness of the church with the foulness
of heathenism. I will now briefly answer your question. You would never
have asked it, had not your mind been wholly taken up with Tully; you
would never have asked it had you made it a practice instead of studying
Volcatius <span id="fr_2127"></span>[2128](#fn_2127.md) to read the holy
scriptures and the commentators upon them. For who is there who does not
know that both in Moses and in the prophets there are passages cited
from Gentile books and that Solomon proposed questions to the
philosophers of Tyre and answered others put to him by them. <span
id="fr_2128"></span>[2129](#fn_2128.md) In the commencement of the book of
Proverbs he charges us to understand prudent maxims and shrewd adages,
parables and obscure discourse, the words of the wise and their dark
sayings; <span id="fr_2129"></span>[2130](#fn_2129.md) all of which belong
by right to the sphere of the dialectician and the philosopher. The
Apostle Paul also, in writing to Titus, has used a line of the poet
Epimenides: “The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow
bellies.” <span id="fr_2130"></span>[2131](#fn_2130.md) Half of which line
was afterwards adopted by Callimachus. It is not surprising that a
literal rendering of the words into Latin should fail to preserve the
metre, seeing that Homer when translated into the same language is
scarcely intelligible even in prose. In another epistle Paul quotes a
line of Menander: “Evil communications corrupt good manners.” <span
id="fr_2131"></span>[2132](#fn_2131.md) And when he is arguing with the
Athenians upon the Areopagus he calls Aratus as a witness citing from
him the words “For we are also his offspring;” <span
id="fr_2132"></span>[2133](#fn_2132.md) in Greek <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.LXX-p10.2"></span>τοῦ γὰρ καὶ γένος ἐσμεν</span>, the close of a
heroic verse. And as if this were not enough, that leader of the
Christian army, that unvanquished pleader for the cause of Christ,
skilfully turns a chance inscription into a proof of the faith. <span
id="fr_2133"></span>[2134](#fn_2133.md) For he had learned from the true
David to wrench the sword of the enemy out of his hand and with his own
blade to cut off the head of the arrogant Goliath. <span
id="fr_2134"></span>[2135](#fn_2134.md) He had read in Deuteronomy the
command given by the voice of the Lord that when a captive woman had had
her head shaved, her eyebrows and all her hair cut off, and her nails
pared, she might then be taken to wife. <span
id="fr_2135"></span>[2136](#fn_2135.md) Is it surprising that I too,
admiring the fairness of her form and the grace of her eloquence, desire
to make that secular wisdom which is my captive and my handmaid, a
matron of the true Israel? Or that shaving off and cutting away all in
her that is dead whether this be idolatry, pleasure, error, or lust, I
take her to myself clean and pure and beget by her servants for the Lord
of Sabaoth? My efforts promote the advantage of Christ’s family, my
so-called defilement with an alien increases the number of my
fellow-servants. Hosea took a wife of whoredoms, Gomer the daughter of
Diblaim, and this harlot bore him a son called Jezreel or the seed of
God. <span id="fr_2136"></span>[2137](#fn_2136.md) Isaiah speaks of a sharp
razor which shaves “the head of sinners and the hair of their
feet;” <span id="fr_2137"></span>[2138](#fn_2137.md) and Ezekiel shaves his
head as a type of that Jerusalem which has been an harlot, <span
id="fr_2138"></span>[2139](#fn_2138.md) in sign that whatever in her is
devoid of sense and life must be removed.

<span id="v.LXX-p17"></span>3. Cyprian, a man renowned both for his
eloquence and for his martyr’s death, was assailed—so Firmian tells
us <span id="fr_2139"></span>[2140](#fn_2139.md) —for having used in his
treatise against Demetrius passages from the Prophets and the Apostles
which the latter declared to be fabricated and made up, instead of
passages from the philosophers and poets whose authority he, as a
heathen, could not well gainsay. Celsus <span
id="fr_2140"></span>[2141](#fn_2140.md) and Porphyry <span
id="fr_2141"></span>[2142](#fn_2141.md) have written against us and have
been ably answered, the former by Origen, the latter by Methodius,
Eusebius, and Apollinaris. <span id="fr_2142"></span>[2143](#fn_2142.md)
Origen wrote a treatise in eight books, the work of <span
id="page_150">p. 150</span> <span
id="v.LXX-Page_150"></span>Methodius <span
id="fr_2143"></span>[2144](#fn_2143.md) extended to ten thousand lines
while Eusebius <span id="fr_2144"></span>[2145](#fn_2144.md) and
Apollinaris <span id="fr_2145"></span>[2146](#fn_2145.md) composed
twenty-five and thirty volumes respectively. Read these and you will
find that compared with them I am a mere tyro in learning, and that, as
my wits have long lain fallow, I can barely recall as in a dream what I
have learned as a boy. The emperor Julian <span
id="fr_2146"></span>[2147](#fn_2146.md) found time during his Parthian
campaign to vomit forth seven books against Christ and, as so often
happens in poetic legends, only wounded himself with his own sword. Were
I to try to confute him with the doctrines of philosophers and stoics
you would doubtless forbid me to strike a mad dog with the club of
Hercules. It is true that he presently felt in battle the hand of our
Nazarene or, as he used to call him, the Galilæan, <span
id="fr_2147"></span>[2148](#fn_2147.md) and that a spear-thrust in the
vitals paid him due recompense for his foul calumnies. To prove the
antiquity of the Jewish people Josephus <span
id="fr_2148"></span>[2149](#fn_2148.md) has written two books against Appio
a grammarian of Alexandria; and in these he brings forward so many
quotations from secular writers as to make me marvel how a Hebrew
brought up from his childhood to read the sacred scriptures could also
have perused the whole library of the Greeks. Need I speak of
Philo <span id="fr_2149"></span>[2150](#fn_2149.md) whom critics call the
second or the Jewish Plato?

<span id="v.LXX-p29"></span>4. Let me now run through the list of our
own writers. Did not Quadratus <span
id="fr_2150"></span>[2151](#fn_2150.md) a disciple of the apostles and
bishop of the Athenian church deliver to the Emperor Hadrian (on the
occasion of his visit to the Eleusinian mysteries) a treatise in defence
of our religion. And so great was the admiration caused in everyone by
his eminent ability that it stilled a most severe persecution. The
philosopher Aristides, <span id="fr_2151"></span>[2152](#fn_2151.md) a man
of great eloquence, presented to the same Emperor an apology for the
Christians composed of extracts from philosophic writers. His example
was afterwards followed by Justin <span
id="fr_2152"></span>[2153](#fn_2152.md) another philosopher who delivered
to Antoninus Pius and his sons <span
id="fr_2153"></span>[2154](#fn_2153.md) and to the senate a treatise
*Against the Gentiles*, in which he defended the ignominy of the cross
and preached the resurrection of Christ with all freedom. Need I speak
of Melito <span id="fr_2154"></span>[2155](#fn_2154.md) bishop of Sardis,
of Apollinaris <span id="fr_2155"></span>[2156](#fn_2155.md) chief-priest
of the Church of Hierapolis, of Dionysius <span
id="fr_2156"></span>[2157](#fn_2156.md) bishop of the Corinthians, of
Tatian, <span id="fr_2157"></span>[2158](#fn_2157.md) of Bardesanes, <span
id="fr_2158"></span>[2159](#fn_2158.md) of Irenæus <span
id="fr_2159"></span>[2160](#fn_2159.md) successor to the martyr
Pothinus; <span id="fr_2160"></span>[2161](#fn_2160.md) all of whom have in
many volumes explained the uprisings of the several heresies and tracked
them back, each to the philosophic source from which it flows.
Pantænus, <span id="fr_2161"></span>[2162](#fn_2161.md) a philosopher of
the Stoic school, was on account of his great reputation for learning
sent by Demetrius bishop of Alexandria to India, to preach Christ to the
Brahmans and philosophers there. Clement, <span
id="fr_2162"></span>[2163](#fn_2162.md) a presbyter of Alexandria, in my
judgment the most learned of men, wrote eight books of
*Miscellanies* <span id="fr_2163"></span>[2164](#fn_2163.md) and as many of
*Outline Sketches*, <span id="fr_2164"></span>[2165](#fn_2164.md) a
treatise against the Gentiles, and three volumes called the *Pedagogue*.
Is there any want of learning in these, or are they not rather drawn
from the very heart of philosophy? Imitating his example Origen <span
id="fr_2165"></span>[2166](#fn_2165.md) wrote ten books of *Miscellanies*,
in which he compares together the opinions held respectively by
Christians and by philosophers, and confirms all the dogmas of our
religion by quotations from Plato and Aristotle, from Numenius <span
id="fr_2166"></span>[2167](#fn_2166.md) and Cornutus. <span
id="fr_2167"></span>[2168](#fn_2167.md) Miltiades <span
id="fr_2168"></span>[2169](#fn_2168.md) also wrote an excellent treatise
against the Gentiles. Moreover Hippolytus <span
id="fr_2169"></span>[2170](#fn_2169.md) and a Roman senator named
Apollonius <span id="fr_2170"></span>[2171](#fn_2170.md) have each compiled
apologetic works. The books of Julius Africanus <span
id="fr_2171"></span>[2172](#fn_2171.md) who wrote a history of his own
times are still extant, as also are those of Theodore who was afterwards
called Gregory, <span id="fr_2172"></span>[2173](#fn_2172.md) <span
id="page_151">p. 151</span> <span id="v.LXX-Page_151"></span>a man
endowed with apostolic miracles as well as with apostolic virtues. We
still have the works of Dionysius <span
id="fr_2173"></span>[2174](#fn_2173.md) bishop of Alexandria, of
Anatolius <span id="fr_2174"></span>[2175](#fn_2174.md) chief priest of the
church of Laodicea, of the presbyters Pamphilus, <span
id="fr_2175"></span>[2176](#fn_2175.md) Pierius, <span
id="fr_2176"></span>[2177](#fn_2176.md) Lucian, <span
id="fr_2177"></span>[2178](#fn_2177.md) Malchion; <span
id="fr_2178"></span>[2179](#fn_2178.md) of Eusebius <span
id="fr_2179"></span>[2180](#fn_2179.md) bishop of Cæsarea, Eustathius <span
id="fr_2180"></span>[2181](#fn_2180.md) of Antioch and Athanasius <span
id="fr_2181"></span>[2182](#fn_2181.md) of Alexandria; of Eusebius <span
id="fr_2182"></span>[2183](#fn_2182.md) of Emisa, of Triphyllius <span
id="fr_2183"></span>[2184](#fn_2183.md) of Cyprus, of Asterius <span
id="fr_2184"></span>[2185](#fn_2184.md) of Scythopolis, of the confessor
Serapion, <span id="fr_2185"></span>[2186](#fn_2185.md) of Titus <span
id="fr_2186"></span>[2187](#fn_2186.md) bishop of Bostra; and of the
Cappadocians Basil, <span id="fr_2187"></span>[2188](#fn_2187.md)
Gregory, <span id="fr_2188"></span>[2189](#fn_2188.md) and
Amphilochius. <span id="fr_2189"></span>[2190](#fn_2189.md) All these
writers so frequently interweave in their books the doctrines and maxims
of the philosophers that you might easily be at a loss which to admire
most, their secular erudition or their knowledge of the scriptures.

<span id="v.LXX-p70"></span>5. I will pass on to Latin writers. Can
anything be more learned or more pointed than the style of
Tertullian? <span id="fr_2190"></span>[2191](#fn_2190.md) His *Apology* and
his books *Against the Gentiles* contain all the wisdom of the world.
Minucius Felix <span id="fr_2191"></span>[2192](#fn_2191.md) a pleader in
the Roman courts has ransacked all heathen literature to adorn the pages
of his *Octavius* and of his treatise *Against the astrologers* (unless
indeed this latter is falsely ascribed to him). Arnobius <span
id="fr_2192"></span>[2193](#fn_2192.md) has published seven books against
the Gentiles, and his pupil Lactantius <span
id="fr_2193"></span>[2194](#fn_2193.md) as many, besides two volumes, one
*on Anger* and the other *on the creative activity of God*. If you read
any of these you will find in them an epitome of Cicero’s dialogues. The
Martyr Victorinus <span id="fr_2194"></span>[2195](#fn_2194.md) though as a
writer deficient in learning is not deficient in the wish to use what
learning he has. Then there is Cyprian. <span
id="fr_2195"></span>[2196](#fn_2195.md) With what terseness, with what
knowledge of all history, with what splendid rhetoric and argument has
he touched the theme that idols are no Gods! Hilary <span
id="fr_2196"></span>[2197](#fn_2196.md) too, a confessor and bishop of my
own day, has imitated Quintilian’s twelve books both in number and in
style, and has also shewn his ability as a writer in his short treatise
against Dioscorus the physician. In the reign of Constantine the
presbyter Juvencus <span id="fr_2197"></span>[2198](#fn_2197.md) set forth
in verse the story of our Lord and Saviour, and did not shrink from
forcing into metre the majestic phrases of the Gospel. Of other writers
dead and living I say nothing. Their aim and their ability are evident
to all who read them. <span id="fr_2198"></span>[2199](#fn_2198.md)

<span id="v.LXX-p80"></span>6. You must not adopt the mistaken opinion,
that while in dealing with the Gentiles one may appeal to their
literature in all other discussions one ought to ignore it; for almost
all the books of all these writers—except those who like Epicurus <span
id="fr_2199"></span>[2200](#fn_2199.md) are no scholars—are extremely full
of erudition and philosophy. I incline indeed to fancy—the thought comes
into my head as I dictate—that you yourself know quite well what has
always been the practice of the learned in this matter. I believe that
in putting this question to me you are only the mouthpiece of another
who by reason of his love for the histories of Sallust might well be
called Calpurnius Lanarius. <span id="fr_2200"></span>[2201](#fn_2200.md)
Please beg of him not to envy eaters their teeth because he is toothless
himself, and not to make light of the eyes of gazelles because he is
himself a mole. Here as you see there is abundant material for
discussion, but I have already filled the limits at my disposal.

<span id="v.LXX-p82"></span> That Rufinus is the person meant is plain
from a reference made to this passage in Apol. adv. Rufinum, i. 30 and

Calpurnius with Sallust. He is mentioned by Plutarch as a treacherous
friend. Sallust does mention a certain Calpurinus Bestia, and Jerome has
probably confounded the two.
