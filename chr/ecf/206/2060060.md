<span id="v.XLIX-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XLIX-p1.1"></span>Letter XLIX. To Pammachius.</span>

<span id="v.XLIX-p2"></span>Jerome encloses the preceding letter, thanks
Pammachius for his efforts to suppress his treatise “against Jovinian,”
but declares these to be useless, and exhorts him, if he still has any
hesitation in his mind, to turn to the Scriptures and the commentaries
made upon them by Origen and others. Written at the same time as the
preceding letter.

<span id="v.XLIX-p3"></span>1. Christian modesty sometimes requires us
to be silent even to our friends, and to nurse our humility in peace,
where the renewal of an old friendship would expose us to the charge of
self-seeking. Thus, when you have kept silence I have kept silence too,
and have not cared to remonstrate with you, lest I should be thought
more anxious to conciliate a person of influence than to cultivate a
friend. But, now that it has become a duty to reply to your letter, I
will endeavor always to be beforehand with you, and not so much to
answer your queries as to write independently of them. Thus, if I have
shown my modesty hitherto by silence, I will henceforth show it still
more by coming forward to speak.

<span id="v.XLIX-p4"></span>2. I quite recognize the kindness and
forethought which have induced you to withdraw from circulation some
copies of my work against Jovinian. Your diligence, however, has been of
no avail, for several people coming from the city have repeatedly read
aloud to me passages which they have come across in Rome. In this
province, also, the books have already been circulated; and, as you have
read yourself in Horace, “Words once uttered cannot be recalled.” <span
id="fr_1200"></span>[1201](#fn_1200.md) I am not so fortunate as are most
of the writers of the day—able, that is, to correct my trifles whenever
I like. When once I have written anything, either my admirers or my
ill-wishers—from different motives, but with equal zeal—sow my work
broadcast among the public; and their language, whether it is that of
eulogy or of criticism, is apt to run to excess. <span
id="fr_1201"></span>[1202](#fn_1201.md) They are guided not by the merits
of the piece, but by their own angry feelings. Accordingly, I have done
what I could. I have dedicated to you a defence of the work in question,
feeling sure that when you have read it you will yourself satisfy the
doubts of others on my behalf; or else, if you too turn up your nose at
the task, you will have to explain in some new manner that section of
the apostle <span id="fr_1202"></span>[1203](#fn_1202.md) in which he
discusses virginity and marriage.

<span id="v.XLIX-p8"></span>3. I do not speak thus that I may provoke
you to write on the subject yourself—although I know your zeal in the
study of the sacred writings to be greater than my own—but that you may
compel my tormentors to do so. They are educated; in their own eyes no
mean scholars; competent not merely to censure but to instruct me. If
they write on the subject, my view will be the sooner neglected when it
is compared with theirs. Read, I pray you, and diligently consider the
words of the apostle, and you will then see that—with a view to avoid
misrepresentation—I have been much more gentle towards married persons
than he was disposed to be. Origen, Dionysius, Pierius, Eusebius of
Cæsarea, Didymus, Apollinaris, have used great latitude in the
interpretation of this epistle. <span
id="fr_1203"></span>[1204](#fn_1203.md) When Pierius, sifting and
expounding the apostle’s meaning, comes to the words, “I would that all
men were even as I myself,” <span id="fr_1204"></span>[1205](#fn_1204.md)
he makes this comment upon them: “In saying this Paul plainly preaches
abstinence from mar<span id="page_80">p. 80</span> <span
id="v.XLIX-Page_80"></span>riage.” Is the fault here mine, or am I
responsible for harshness? Compared with this sentence of Pierius, <span
id="fr_1205"></span>[1206](#fn_1205.md) all that I have ever written is
mild indeed. Consult the commentaries of the above-named writers and
take advantage of the Church libraries; you will then more speedily
finish as you would wish the enterprise which you have so happily
begun. <span id="fr_1206"></span>[1207](#fn_1206.md)

<span id="v.XLIX-p13"></span>4. I hear that the hopes of the entire city
are centred in you, and that bishop <span
id="fr_1207"></span>[1208](#fn_1207.md) and people are agreed in wishing
for your exaltation. To be a bishop <span
id="fr_1208"></span>[1209](#fn_1208.md) is much, to deserve to be one is
more.

<span id="v.XLIX-p16"></span>If you read the books of the sixteen
prophets <span id="fr_1209"></span>[1210](#fn_1209.md) which I have
rendered into Latin from the Hebrew; and if, when you have done so, you
express satisfaction with my labors, the news will encourage me to take
out of my desk some other works now shut up in it. I have lately
translated Job into our mother tongue: you will be able to borrow a copy
of it from your cousin, the saintly Marcella. Read it both in Greek and
in Latin, and compare the old version with my rendering. You will then
clearly see that the difference between them is that between truth and
falsehood. Some of my commentaries upon the twelve prophets I have sent
to the reverend father Domnio, also the four books of Kings—that is, the
two called Samuel and the two called Malâchim. <span
id="fr_1210"></span>[1211](#fn_1210.md) If you care to read these you will
learn for yourself how difficult it is to understand the Holy
Scriptures, and particularly the prophets; and how through the fault of
the translators passages which for the Jews flow clearly on for us
abound with mistakes. Once more, you must not in my small writings look
for any such eloquence as that which for Christ’s sake you disregard in
Cicero. A version made for the use of the Church, even though it may
possess a literary charm, ought to disguise and avoid it as far as
possible; in order that it may not speak to the idle schools and few
disciples of the philosophers, but may address itself rather to the
entire human race.
