<p><a name="v.CXII-p2"></A>On receiving Letter CIV. together with duly authenticated copies of Letters LVI. and LXVII. Jerome in three days completes an exhaustive reply to all the questions which Augustine had raised. He explains what is the true title of his book <i>On Illustrious Men</i>, deals at great length with the dispute between Paul and Peter, expounds his views with regard to the Septuagint, and shews by the story of &#8220;the gourd&#8221; how close and accurate his translations are. His language throughout is kind but rather patronising: indeed in this whole correspondence Jerome seldom sufficiently recognizes the greatness of Augustine. The date of the letter is 404 <span class="c17"><a name="v.CXII-p2.1"></A>a.d.</span></p>
