id="v.XXXV-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXV. From Pope Damasus.</span>

<span id="v.XXXV-p2"></span>Damasus addresses five questions to Jerome
with a request for information concerning them. They are:

<span id="v.XXXV-p3"></span>1. What is the meaning of the words
“Whosoever slayeth Cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold”?
([Gen. iv. 5](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#005.md)<span
id="v.XXXV-p3.1"></span>.)

<span id="v.XXXV-p4"></span>2. If God has made all things good, how
comes it that He gives charge to Noah concerning unclean animals, and
says to Peter, “What God hath cleansed that call not thou common”?
([Acts x. 15](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#015.md)<span
id="v.XXXV-p4.1"></span>.)

<span id="v.XXXV-p5"></span>3. How is [Gen. xv.
16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016.md)<span id="v.XXXV-p5.1"></span>, “in
the fourth generation they shall come hither again,” to be reconciled
with [Ex. xiii. 18](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018.md)<span
id="v.XXXV-p5.2"></span>, LXX, “in the fifth generation the children of
Israel went up out of the land of Egypt”?

<span id="v.XXXV-p6"></span>4. Why did Abraham receive circumcision as a
seal of his faith? ([Rom. iv. 11](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#011.md)<span
id="v.XXXV-p6.1"></span>.)

<span id="v.XXXV-p7"></span>5. Why was Isaac, a righteous man and dear
to God, allowed by God to become the dupe of Jacob? ([Gen.
xxvii](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#000)<span id="v.XXXV-p7.1"></span>..md)
Written at Rome 384 <span class="c17"><span
