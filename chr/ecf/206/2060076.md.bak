id="v.LXV-p1.1"></span>Letter LXV. To Principia.</span>

<span id="v.LXV-p2"></span>A commentary on Ps. XLV. addressed to
Marcella’s friend and companion Principia (see Letter CXXVII.). Jerome
prefaces what he has to say by a defence of his practice of writing for
women, a practice which had exposed him to many foolish sneers. He deals
with the same subject in his dedication of the Commentary of Sophronius.
The date of the letter is 397 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.LXV-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>
