<span id="vii.iii.xv-p2"></span>*There are three stages of Jerome’s work
of Scripture Translation. The first is during his stay at Rome, <span
class="c17"><span id="vii.iii.xv-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 382–385, when
he translated only from the Greek—the New Testament from the Greek <span
class="c17"><span id="vii.iii.xv-p2.2"></span>mss.</span>, and the Book
of Psalms from the LXX. The second is the period immediately after his
settlement at Bethlehem, when he translated still from the LXX., but
marked with obeli and asterisks the passages in which that version
differed from the Hebrew: the third from <span class="c17"><span
id="vii.iii.xv-p2.3"></span>a.d.</span> 390–404, in which he translated
directly from the Hebrew. The work of the second period is that which is
now before us. The whole of the Old Testament was translated from the
LXX. (see his Apology, book ii. c. 24), but most of it was lost during
his lifetime (see Letters CXXXIV. (end) and CXVI. 34 (in Augustin
Letter, 62)). What remains is the Book of Job, the Psalms, Chronicles,
the Books of Solomon, and Tobit and Judith.*
