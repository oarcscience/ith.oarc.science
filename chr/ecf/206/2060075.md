id="v.LXIV-p1.1"></span>Letter LXIV. To Fabiola.</span>

<span id="v.LXIV-p2"></span>Fabiola’s visit to Bethlehem had been
shortened by the threatened invasion of the Huns which compelled Jerome
and his friends to take refuge for a time on the seaboard of Palestine.
Fabiola here took leave of her companions and set sail for Italy, but
not until Jerome had completed this letter for her use (§22). It
contains a mystical account of the vestments of the High Priest worked
out with Jerome’s usual ingenuity and learning. Similar treatises are
ascribed to Tertullian and to Hosius bishop of Cordova, but these have
long since perished. Its date is 396 or 397 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.LXIV-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>
