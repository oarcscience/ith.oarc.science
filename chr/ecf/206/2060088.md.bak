<span id="v.LXXVII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.LXXVII-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXVII. To Oceanus.</span>

<span id="v.LXXVII-p2"></span>The eulogy of Fabiola whose restless life
had come to an end in 399 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.LXXVII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> Jerome tells the story of her sin
and of her penitence (for which see Letter LV.), of the hospital
established by her at Portus, of her visit to Bethlehem, and of her
earnestness in the study of scripture. He relates how he wrote for her
his account of the vestments of the high priest (Letter LXIV.) and how
at the time of her death he was at her request engaged upon a commentary
on the forty-two halting-places of the Israelites in the wilderness
(Letter LXXIX.). This last he now sends along with this letter to
Oceanus. Jerome also bestows praise upon Pammachius as the companion of
all Fabiola’s labours. The date of the letter is 399 <span
class="c17"><span id="v.LXXVII-p2.2"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.LXXVII-p3"></span><span id="page_158">p. 158</span> <span
id="v.LXXVII-Page_158"></span>1. Several years since I consoled the
venerated Paula, whilst her affliction was still recent for the falling
asleep of Blæsilla. <span id="fr_2321"></span>[2322](#fn_2321.md) Four
summers ago I wrote for the bishop Heliodorus the epitaph of Nepotian,
and expended what ability I possessed in giving expression to my grief
at his loss. <span id="fr_2322"></span>[2323](#fn_2322.md) Only two years
have elapsed since I sent a brief letter to my dear Pammachius on the
sudden flitting of his Paulina. <span
id="fr_2323"></span>[2324](#fn_2323.md) I blushed to say more to one so
learned or to give him back his own thoughts: lest I should seem less
the consoler of a friend than the officious instructor of one already
perfect. But now, Oceanus my son, the duty that you lay upon me is one
that I gladly accept and would even seek unasked. For when new virtues
have to be dealt with, an old subject itself becomes new. In previous
cases I have had to soften and restrain a mother’s affection, an uncle’s
grief, and a husband’s yearning; according to the different requirements
of each I have had to apply from scripture different remedies.

<span id="v.LXXVII-p7"></span>2. To-day you give me as my theme Fabiola,
the praise of the Christians, the marvel of the gentiles, the sorrow of
the poor, and the consolation of the monks. Whatever point in her
character I choose to treat of first, pales into insignificance compared
with those which follow after. Shall I praise her fasts? Her alms are
greater still. Shall I commend her lowliness? The glow of her faith is
yet brighter. Shall I mention her studied plainness in dress, her
voluntary choice of plebeian costume and the garb of a slave that she
might put to shame silken robes? To change one’s disposition is a
greater achievement than to change one’s dress. It is harder for us to
part with arrogance than with gold and gems. For, even though we throw
away these, we plume ourselves sometimes on a meanness that is really
ostentatious, and we make a bid with a saleable poverty for the popular
applause. But a virtue that seeks concealment and is cherished in the
inner consciousness appeals to no judgement but that of God. Thus the
eulogies which I have to bestow upon Fabiola will be altogether new: I
must neglect the order of the rhetoricians and begin all I have to say
only from the cradle of her conversion and of her penitence. Another
writer, mindful of the school, would perhaps bring forward Quintus
Maximus, “the man who by delaying rescued Rome,” <span
id="fr_2324"></span>[2325](#fn_2324.md) and the whole Fabian family; he
would describe their struggles and battles and would exult that Fabiola
had come to us through a line so noble, shewing that qualities not
apparent in the branch still existed in the root. But as I am a lover of
the inn at Bethlehem and of the Lord’s stable in which the virgin
travailed with and gave birth to an infant God, I shall deduce the
lineage of Christ’s handmaid not from a stock famous in history but from
the lowliness of the church.

<span id="v.LXXVII-p9"></span>3. And because at the very outset there is
a rock in the path and she is overwhelmed by a storm of censure, for
having forsaken her first husband and having taken a second, I will not
praise her for her conversion till I have first cleared her of this
charge. So terrible then were the faults imputed to her former husband
that not even a prostitute or a common slave could have put up with
them. If I were to recount them, I should undo the heroism of the wife
who chose to bear the blame of a separation rather than to blacken the
character and expose the stains of him who was one body with her. I will
only urge this one plea which is sufficient to exonerate a chaste matron
and a Christian woman. The Lord has given commandment that a wife must
not be put away “except it be for fornication, and that, if put away,
she must remain unmarried.” <span id="fr_2325"></span>[2326](#fn_2325.md)
Now a commandment which is given to men logically applies to women also.
For it cannot be that, while an adulterous wife is to be put away, an
incontinent husband is to be retained. The apostle says: “he which is
joined to an harlot is one body.” <span
id="fr_2326"></span>[2327](#fn_2326.md) Therefore she also who is joined to
a whoremonger and unchaste person is made one body with him. The laws of
Cæsar are different, it is true, from the laws of Christ:
Papinianus <span id="fr_2327"></span>[2328](#fn_2327.md) commands one
thing; our own Paul another. Earthly laws give a free rein to the
unchastity of men, merely condemning seduction and adultery; lust is
allowed to range unrestrained among brothels and slave girls, as if the
guilt were constituted by the rank of the person assailed and not by the
purpose of the assailant. But with us Christians what is unlawful for
women is equally unlawful for men, and as both serve the same God both
are bound by the same obligations. Fabiola then has put away—they are
quite right—a husband that was a sinner, guilty of this and that crime,
sins—I have almost mentioned their names—with which the whole
neighbourhood resounded but which the wife alone refused to disclose. If
however it is made a charge against her that after repudiating her
husband she did not continue unmarried, I readily admit this to have
been a fault, but at the same time declare that it may have been a case
of necessity. “It is better,” the apostle tells us, “to marry than to
burn.” <span id="fr_2328"></span>[2329](#fn_2328.md) She was quite a young
<span id="page_159">p. 159</span> <span
id="v.LXXVII-Page_159"></span>woman, she was not able to continue in
widowhood. In the words of the apostle she saw another law in her
members warring against the law of her mind; <span
id="fr_2329"></span>[2330](#fn_2329.md) she felt herself dragged in chains
as a captive towards the indulgences of wedlock. Therefore she thought
it better openly to confess her weakness and to accept the semblance of
an unhappy marriage than, with the name of a monogamist, to ply the
trade of a courtesan. The same apostle wills that the younger widows
should marry, bear children, and give no occasion to the adversary to
speak reproachfully. <span id="fr_2330"></span>[2331](#fn_2330.md) And he
at once goes on to explain his wish: “for some are already turned aside
after Satan.” <span id="fr_2331"></span>[2332](#fn_2331.md) Fabiola
therefore was fully persuaded in her own mind: she thought she had acted
legitimately in putting away her husband, and that when she had done so
she was free to marry again. She did not know that the rigour of the
gospel takes away from women all pretexts for re-marriage so long as
their former husbands are alive; and not knowing this, though she
contrived to evade other assaults of the devil, she at this point
unwittingly exposed herself to a wound from him.

<span id="v.LXXVII-p17"></span>4. But why do I linger over old and
forgotten matters, seeking to excuse a fault for which Fabiola has
herself confessed her penitence? Who would believe that, after the death
of her second husband at a time when most widows, having shaken off the
yoke of servitude, grow careless and allow themselves more liberty than
ever, frequenting the baths, flitting through the streets, shewing their
harlot faces everywhere; that at this time Fabiola came to herself? Yet
it was then that she put on sackcloth to make public confession of her
error. It was then that in the presence of all Rome (in the basilica
which formerly belonged to that Lateranus who perished by the sword of
Cæsar <span id="fr_2332"></span>[2333](#fn_2332) .md) she stood in the
ranks of the penitents and exposed before bishop, presbyters, and
people—all of whom wept when they saw her weep—her dishevelled hair,
pale features, soiled hands and unwashed neck. What sins would such a
penance fail to purge away? What ingrained stains would such tears be
unable to wash out? By a threefold confession Peter blotted out his
threefold denial. <span id="fr_2333"></span>[2334](#fn_2333.md) If Aaron
committed sacrilege by fashioning molten gold into the head of a calf,
his brother’s prayers made amends for his transgressions. <span
id="fr_2334"></span>[2335](#fn_2334.md) If holy David, meekest of men,
committed the double sin of murder and adultery, he atoned for it by a
fast of seven days. He lay upon the earth, he rolled in the ashes, he
forgot his royal power, he sought for light in the darkness. <span
id="fr_2335"></span>[2336](#fn_2335.md) And then, turning his eyes to that
God whom he had so deeply offended, he cried with a lamentable voice:
“Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy
sight,” and “Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with
thy free spirit.” <span id="fr_2336"></span>[2337](#fn_2336.md) He who by
his virtues teaches me how to stand and not to fall, by his penitence
teaches me how, if I fall, I may rise again. Among the kings do we read
of any so wicked as Ahab, of whom the scripture says: “there was none
like unto Ahab which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of
the Lord”? <span id="fr_2337"></span>[2338](#fn_2337.md) For shedding
Naboth’s blood Elijah rebuked him, and the prophet denounced God’s wrath
against him: “Hast thou killed and also taken possession?…behold I will
bring evil upon thee and will take away thy posterity” <span
id="fr_2338"></span>[2339](#fn_2338.md) and so on. Yet when Ahab heard
these words “he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and
fasted…in sackcloth, and went softly.” <span
id="fr_2339"></span>[2340](#fn_2339.md) Then came the word of God to Elijah
the Tishbite saying: “Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me?
Because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his
days.” <span id="fr_2340"></span>[2341](#fn_2340.md) O happy penitence
which has drawn down upon itself the eyes of God, and which has by
confessing its error changed the sentence of God’s anger! The same
conduct is in the Chronicles <span id="fr_2341"></span>[2342](#fn_2341.md)
attributed to Manasseh, and in the book of the prophet Jonah <span
id="fr_2342"></span>[2343](#fn_2342.md) to Nineveh, and in the gospel to
the publican. <span id="fr_2343"></span>[2344](#fn_2343.md) The first of
these not only was allowed to obtain forgiveness but also recovered his
kingdom, the second broke the force of God’s impending wrath, while the
third, smiting his breast with his hands, “would not lift up so much as
his eyes to heaven.” Yet for all that the publican with his humble
confession of his faults went back justified far more than the Pharisee
with his arrogant boasting of his virtues. This is not however the place
to preach penitence, neither am I writing against Montanus and
Novatus. <span id="fr_2344"></span>[2345](#fn_2344.md) Else would I say of
it that it is “a sacrifice…well pleasing to God,” <span
id="fr_2345"></span>[2346](#fn_2345.md) I would cite the words of the
psalmist: “the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,” <span
id="fr_2346"></span>[2347](#fn_2346.md) and those of Ezekiel “I prefer the
repentance of a sinner rather than his death,” <span
id="fr_2347"></span>[2348](#fn_2347.md) and those of Baruch, “Arise, arise,
O Jerusalem,” <span id="fr_2348"></span>[2349](#fn_2348.md) and many other
proclamations made by the trumpets of the prophets.

<span id="v.LXXVII-p35"></span><span id="page_160">p. 160</span> <span
id="v.LXXVII-Page_160"></span>5. But this one thing I will say, for it
is at once useful to my readers and pertinent to my present theme. As
Fabiola was not ashamed of the Lord on earth, so He shall not be ashamed
of her in heaven. <span id="fr_2349"></span>[2350](#fn_2349.md) She laid
bare her wound to the gaze of all, and Rome beheld with tears the
disfiguring scar which marred her beauty. She uncovered her limbs, bared
her head, and closed her mouth. She no longer entered the church of God
but, like Miriam the sister of Moses, <span
id="fr_2350"></span>[2351](#fn_2350.md) she sat apart without the camp,
till the priest who had cast her out should himself call her back. She
came down like the daughter of Babylon from the throne of her
daintiness, she took the millstones and ground meal, she passed
barefooted through rivers of tears. <span
id="fr_2351"></span>[2352](#fn_2351.md) She sat upon the coals of fire, and
these became her aid. <span id="fr_2352"></span>[2353](#fn_2352.md) That
face by which she had once pleased her second husband she now smote with
blows; she hated jewels, shunned ornaments and could not bear to look
upon fine linen. <span id="fr_2353"></span>[2354](#fn_2353.md) In fact she
bewailed the sin she had committed as bitterly as if it had been
adultery, and went to the expense of many remedies in her eagerness to
cure her one wound.

<span id="v.LXXVII-p41"></span>6. Having found myself aground in the
shallows of Fabiola’s sin, I have dwelt thus long upon her penitence in
order that I might open up a larger and quite unimpeded space for the
description of her praises. Restored to communion before the eyes of the
whole church, what did she do? In the day of prosperity she was not
forgetful of affliction; <span id="fr_2354"></span>[2355](#fn_2354.md) and,
having once suffered shipwreck she was unwilling again to face the risks
of the sea. Instead therefore of re-embarking on her old life, she broke
up <span id="fr_2355"></span>[2356](#fn_2355.md) and sold all that she
could lay hands on of her property (it was large and suitable to her
rank), and turning it into money she laid out this for the benefit of
the poor. She was the first person to found a hospital, into which she
might gather sufferers out of the streets, and where she might nurse the
unfortunate victims of sickness and want. Need I now recount the various
ailments of human beings? Need I speak of noses slit, eyes put out, feet
half burnt, hands covered with sores? Or of limbs dropsical and
atrophied? Or of diseased flesh alive with worms? Often did she carry on
her own shoulders persons infected with jaundice or with filth. Often
too did she wash away the matter discharged from wounds which others,
even though men, could not bear to look at. She gave food to her
patients with her own hand, and moistened the scarce breathing lips of
the dying with sips of liquid. I know of many wealthy and devout persons
who, unable to overcome their natural repugnance to such sights, perform
this work of mercy by the agency of others, giving money instead of
personal aid. I do not blame them and am far from construing their
weakness of resolution into a want of faith. While however I pardon such
squeamishness, I extol to the skies the enthusiastic zeal of a mind that
is above it. A great faith makes little of such trifles. But I know how
terrible was the retribution which fell upon the proud mind of the rich
man clothed in purple for not having helped Lazarus. <span
id="fr_2356"></span>[2357](#fn_2356.md) The poor wretch whom we despise,
whom we cannot so much as look at, and the very sight of whom turns our
stomachs, is human like ourselves, is made of the same clay as we are,
is formed out of the same elements. All that he suffers we too may
suffer. Let us then regard his wounds as though they were our own, and
then all our insensibility to another’s suffering will give way before
our pity for ourselves.

<span id="v.LXXVII-p45"></span>Not with a hundred tongues or throat of
bronze

<span id="v.LXXVII-p46"></span>Could I exhaust the forms of fell
disease <span id="fr_2357"></span>[2358](#fn_2357.md)

<span id="v.LXXVII-p48"></span>which Fabiola so wonderfully alleviated
in the suffering poor that many of the healthy fell to envying the sick.
However she showed the same liberality towards the clergy and monks and
virgins. Was there a monastery which was not supported by Fabiola’s
wealth? Was there a naked or bedridden person who was not clothed with
garments supplied by her? Were there ever any in want to whom she failed
to give a quick and unhesitating supply? Even Rome was not wide enough
for her pity. Either in her own person or else through the agency of
reverend and trustworthy men she went from island to island and carried
her bounty not only round the Etruscan Sea, but throughout the district
of the Volscians, as it stands along those secluded and winding shores
where communities of monks are to be found.

<span id="v.LXXVII-p49"></span>7. Suddenly she made up her mind, against
the advice of all her friends, to take ship and to come to Jerusalem.
Here she was welcomed by a large concourse of people and for a short
time took advantage of my hospitality. Indeed, when I call to mind our
meeting, I seem to see her here now instead of in the past. Blessed
Jesus, what zeal, what earnestness she bestowed upon the sacred volumes!
In her eagerness to satisfy what was a veritable craving she would run
through Prophets, Gospels, and Psalms: she would suggest questions and
treasure up the answers in the desk of her own bosom. And yet this
eager<span id="page_161">p. 161</span> <span
id="v.LXXVII-Page_161"></span>ness to hear did not bring with it any
feeling of satiety: increasing her knowledge she also increased her
sorrow, <span id="fr_2358"></span>[2359](#fn_2358.md) and by casting oil
upon the flame she did but supply fuel for a still more burning zeal.
One day we had before us the book of *Numbers* written by Moses, and she
modestly questioned me as to the meaning of the great mass of names
there to be found. Why was it, she inquired, that single tribes were
differently associated in this passage and in that, how came it that the
soothsayer Balaam in prophesying of the future mysteries of Christ <span
id="fr_2359"></span>[2360](#fn_2359.md) spoke more plainly of Him than
almost any other prophet? I replied as best I could and tried to satisfy
her enquiries. Then unrolling the book still farther she came to the
passage <span id="fr_2360"></span>[2361](#fn_2360.md) in which is given the
list of all the halting-places by which the people after leaving Egypt
made its way to the waters of Jordan. And when she asked me the meaning
and reason of each of these, I spoke doubtfully about some, dealt with
others in a tone of assurance, and in several instances simply confessed
my ignorance. Hereupon she began to press me harder still, expostulating
with me as though it were a thing unallowable that I should be ignorant
of what I did not know, yet at the same time affirming her own
unworthiness to understand mysteries so deep. In a word I was ashamed to
refuse her request and allowed her to extort from me a promise that I
would devote a special work to this subject for her use. Till the
present time I have had to defer the fulfilment of my promise: as I now
perceive, by the Will of God in order that it should be consecrated to
her memory. As in a previous work <span
id="fr_2361"></span>[2362](#fn_2361.md) I clothed her with the priestly
vestments, so in the pages of the present <span
id="fr_2362"></span>[2363](#fn_2362.md) she may rejoice that she has passed
through the wilderness of this world and has come at last to the land of
promise.

<span id="v.LXXVII-p55"></span>8. But let me continue the task which I
have begun. Whilst I was in search of a suitable dwelling for so great a
lady, whose only conception of the solitary life included a place of
resort like Mary’s inn; suddenly messengers flew this way and that and
the whole East was terror-struck. For news came that the hordes of the
Huns had poured forth all the way from Mæotis <span
id="fr_2363"></span>[2364](#fn_2363.md) (they had their haunts between the
icy Tanais <span id="fr_2364"></span>[2365](#fn_2364.md) and the rude
Massagetæ <span id="fr_2365"></span>[2366](#fn_2365.md) where the gates of
Alexander keep back the wild peoples behind the Caucasus); and that,
speeding hither and thither on their nimble-footed horses, they were
filling all the world with panic and bloodshed. The Roman army was
absent at the time, being detained in Italy on account of the civil
wars. Of these Huns Herodotus <span id="fr_2366"></span>[2367](#fn_2366.md)
tells us that under Darius King of the Medes they held the East in
bondage for twenty years and that from the Egyptians and Ethiopians they
exacted a yearly tribute. May Jesus avert from the Roman world the
farther assaults of these wild beasts! Everywhere their approach was
unexpected, they outstripped rumour in speed, and, when they came, they
spared neither religion nor rank nor age, even for wailing infants they
had no pity. Children were forced to die before it could be said that
they had begun to live; and little ones not realizing their miserable
fate might be seen smiling in the hands and at the weapons of their
enemies. It was generally agreed that the goal of the invaders was
Jerusalem and that it was their excessive desire for gold which made
them hasten to this particular city. Its walls uncared for in time of
peace were accordingly put in repair. Antioch was in a state of siege.
Tyre, desirous of cutting itself off from the land, sought once more its
ancient island. We too were compelled to man our ships and to lie off
the shore as a precaution against the arrival of our foes. No matter how
hard the winds might blow, we could not but dread the barbarians more
than shipwreck. It was not, however, so much for our own safety that we
were anxious as for the chastity of the virgins who were with us. Just
at that time also there was dissension among us, <span
id="fr_2367"></span>[2368](#fn_2367.md) and our intestine struggles threw
into the shade our battle with the barbarians. I myself clung to my
long-settled abode in the East and gave way to my deep-seated love for
the holy places. Fabiola, used as she was to moving from city to city
and having no other property but what her baggage contained, returned to
her native land; to live in poverty where she had once been rich, to
lodge in the house of another, she who in old days had lodged many
guests in her own, and—not unduly to prolong my account—to bestow upon
the poor before the eyes of Rome the proceeds of that property which
Rome knew her to have sold.

<span id="v.LXXVII-p61"></span>9. This only do I lament that in her the
holy places lost a necklace of the loveliest. Rome recovered what it had
previously parted with, and the wanton and slanderous tongues of the
heathen were confuted by the testimony of their own eyes. Others may
commend her pity, her humility, her faith: I will rather praise her
ardour of soul. The letter <span id="fr_2368"></span>[2369](#fn_2368.md) in
which as a young man I once urged Heliodorus to the life of a hermit she
knew by heart, <span id="page_162">p. 162</span> <span
id="v.LXXVII-Page_162"></span>and whenever she looked upon the walls of
Rome she complained that she was in a prison. Forgetful of her sex,
unmindful of her frailty, and only desiring to be alone she was in fact
there <span id="fr_2369"></span>[2370](#fn_2369.md) where her soul
lingered. The counsels of her friends could not hold her back; so eager
was she to burst from the city as from a place of bondage. Nor did she
leave the distribution of her alms to others; she distributed them
herself. Her wish was that, after equitably dispensing her money to the
poor, she might herself find support from others for the sake of Christ.
In such haste was she and so impatient of delay that you would fancy her
on the eve of her departure. As she was always ready, death could not
find her unprepared.

<span id="v.LXXVII-p64"></span>10. As I pen her praises, my dear
Pammachius seems suddenly to rise before me. His wife Paulina sleeps
that he may keep vigil; she has gone before her husband that he
remaining behind may be Christ’s servant. Although he was his wife’s
heir, others—I mean the poor—are now in possession of his inheritance.
He and Fabiola contended for the privilege of setting up a tent like
that of Abraham <span id="fr_2370"></span>[2371](#fn_2370.md) at Portus.
The contest which arose between them was for the supremacy in shewing
kindness. Each conquered and each was overcome. Both admitted themselves
to be at once victors and vanquished for what each had desired to effect
alone both accomplished together. They united their resources and
combined their plans that harmony might forward what rivalry must have
brought to nought. No sooner was the scheme broached than it was carried
out. A house was purchased to serve as a shelter, and a crowd flocked
into it. “There was no more travail in Jacob nor distress in
Israel.” <span id="fr_2371"></span>[2372](#fn_2371.md) The seas carried
voyagers to find a welcome here on landing. Travellers left Rome in
haste to take advantage of the mild coast before setting sail. What
Publius once did in the island of Malta for one apostle and—not to leave
room for gainsaying—for a single ship’s crew, <span
id="fr_2372"></span>[2373](#fn_2372.md) Fabiola and Pammachius have done
over and over again for large numbers; and not only have they supplied
the wants of the destitute, but so universal has been their munificence
that they have provided additional means for those who have something
already. The whole world knows that a home for strangers has been
established at Portus; and Britain has learned in the summer what Egypt
and Parthia knew in the spring.

<span id="v.LXXVII-p68"></span>11. In the death of this noble lady we
have seen a fulfilment of the apostle’s words:—“All things work together
for good to them that fear God.” <span
id="fr_2373"></span>[2374](#fn_2373.md) Having a presentiment of what would
happen, she had written to several monks to come and release her from
the burthen under which she laboured; <span
id="fr_2374"></span>[2375](#fn_2374.md) for she wished to make to herself
friends of the mammon of unrighteousness that they might receive her
into everlasting habitations. <span id="fr_2375"></span>[2376](#fn_2375.md)
They came to her and she made them her friends; she fell asleep in the
way that she had wished, and having at last laid aside her burthen she
soared more lightly up to heaven. How great a marvel Fabiola had been to
Rome while she lived came out in the behaviour of the people now that
she was dead. Hardly had she breathed her last breath, hardly had she
given back her soul to Christ whose it was when

<span id="v.LXXVII-p72"></span>Flying Rumour heralding the woe <span
id="fr_2376"></span>[2377](#fn_2376.md)

<span id="v.LXXVII-p74"></span>gathered the entire city to attend her
obsequies. Psalms were chaunted and the gilded ceilings of the temples
were shaken with uplifted shouts of Alleluia.

<span id="v.LXXVII-p75"></span>The choirs of young and old extolled her
deeds

<span id="v.LXXVII-p76"></span>And sang the praises of her holy
soul. <span id="fr_2377"></span>[2378](#fn_2377.md)

<span id="v.LXXVII-p78"></span>Her triumph was more glorious far than
those won by Furius over the Gauls, by Papirius over the Samnites, by
Scipio over Numantia, by Pompey over Pontus. They had conquered physical
force, she had mastered spiritual iniquities. <span
id="fr_2378"></span>[2379](#fn_2378.md) I seem to hear even now the
squadrons which led the van of the procession, and the sound of the feet
of the multitude which thronged in thousands to attend her funeral. The
streets, porches, and roofs from which a view could be obtained were
inadequate to accommodate the spectators. On that day Rome saw all her
peoples gathered together in one, and each person present flattered
himself that he had some part in the glory of her penitence. No wonder
indeed that men should thus exult in the salvation of one at whose
conversion there was joy among the angels in heaven. <span

<span id="v.LXXVII-p81"></span>12. I give you this, Fabiola, <span
id="fr_2380"></span>[2381](#fn_2380.md) the best gift of my aged powers, to
be as it were a funeral offering. Oftentimes have I praised virgins and
widows and married women who have kept their garments always white <span
id="fr_2381"></span>[2382](#fn_2381.md) and who follow the Lamb
whithersoever He goeth. <span id="fr_2382"></span>[2383](#fn_2382.md) Happy
indeed is she in her encomium who throughout her life has been stained
by no defilement. But let envy depart and censoriousness be silent. If
the father of the house is good why should our eye be evil? <span
id="fr_2383"></span>[2384](#fn_2383.md) The soul which fell among thieves
has been <span id="page_163">p. 163</span> <span
id="v.LXXVII-Page_163"></span>carried home upon the shoulders of
Christ. <span id="fr_2384"></span>[2385](#fn_2384.md) In our father’s house
are many mansions. <span id="fr_2385"></span>[2386](#fn_2385.md) Where sin
hath abounded, grace hath much more abounded. <span
id="fr_2386"></span>[2387](#fn_2386.md) To whom more is forgiven the same
loveth more. <span id="fr_2387"></span>[2388](#fn_2387.md)
