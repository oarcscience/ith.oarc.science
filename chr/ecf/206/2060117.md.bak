id="v.CVI-p1.1"></span>Letter CVI. To Sunnias and Fretela.</span>

<span id="v.CVI-p2"></span>A long letter in which Jerome answers a
number of questions put to him by two sojourners in Getica, Sunnias and
Fretela. Diligent students of scripture, these men were at a loss to
understand the frequent differences between Jerome’s Latin psalter of
383 <span class="c17"><span id="v.CVI-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> (the
so-called Roman psalter) and the LXX, and accordingly sent him a long
list of passages with a request for explanation. Jerome in his reply
deals fully with all these and points out to his correspondents that
they have been misled by their edition of the LXX. (the “common”
edition) which differs widely from the critical text of Origen as given
in the Hexapla and used by himself. He also expresses his joy to find
that even among the Getæ the scriptures are now diligently studied. The
date of the letter is about 403 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.CVI-p2.2"></span>a.d.</span>
