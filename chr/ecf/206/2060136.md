<span id="v.CXXV-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.CXXV-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXV. To Rusticus.</span>

<span id="v.CXXV-p2"></span>Rusticus, a young monk of Toulouse, (to be
carefully distinguished from the recipient of Letter CXXII.) is advised
by Jerome not to become an anchorite but to continue in a community.
Rules are suggested for the monastic life and a vivid picture is drawn
of the difference between a good monk and a bad. Incidentally Jerome
indulges his spleen against his dead opponent Rufinus (§18). The date of
the letter is 411 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.CXXV-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.CXXV-p3"></span>1. No man is happier than the Christian, for
to him is promised the kingdom of heaven. No man struggles harder than
he, for he goes daily in danger of his life. No man is stronger, for he
overcomes the Devil. No man is weaker, for he is overcome by the flesh.
Both pairs of statements can be proved by many examples. For instance,
the robber believes upon the cross and immediately hears the assuring
words: “verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in
paradise:” <span id="fr_3396"></span>[3397](#fn_3396.md) while Judas falls
from the pinnacle of the apostolate into the abyss of perdition. Neither
the close intercourse of the banquet nor the dipping of the sop <span
id="fr_3397"></span>[3398](#fn_3397.md) nor the Lord’s gracious kiss <span
id="fr_3398"></span>[3399](#fn_3398.md) can save him from betraying as man
Him whom he had known as the Son of God. Could any one have been viler
than the woman of Samaria? Yet not only did she herself believe, and
after her six husbands find one Lord, not only did she recognize that
Messiah by the well, whom the Jews failed to recognize in the temple;
she brought salvation to many and, while the apostles were away buying
food, refreshed the Saviour’s hunger and relieved His weariness. <span
id="fr_3399"></span>[3400](#fn_3399.md) Was ever man wiser than Solomon?
Yet love for women made even him foolish. Salt is good, and every
offering must be sprinkled with it. <span
id="fr_3400"></span>[3401](#fn_3400.md) Wherefore also the apostle has
given commandment: “let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with
salt.” <span id="fr_3401"></span>[3402](#fn_3401.md) But “if the salt have
lost his savour,” it is cast out. <span
id="fr_3402"></span>[3403](#fn_3402.md) And so utterly does it lose its
value that it is not even fit for the dunghill, <span
id="fr_3403"></span>[3404](#fn_3403.md) whence believers fetch manure to
enrich the barren soil of their souls.

<span id="v.CXXV-p12"></span>I begin thus, Rusticus my son, to teach you
<span id="page_245">p. 245</span> <span id="v.CXXV-Page_245"></span>the
greatness of your enterprise and the loftiness of your ideal; and to
shew you that only by trampling under foot youthful lusts can you hope
to climb the heights of true maturity. For the path along which you walk
is a slippery one and the glory of success is less than the shame of
failure.

<span id="v.CXXV-p13"></span>2. I need not now conduct the stream of my
discourse through the meadows of virtue, nor exert myself to shew to you
the beauty of its several flowers. I need not dilate on the purity of
the lily, the modest blush of the rose, the royal purple of the violet,
or the promise of glowing gems which their various colours hold out. For
through the mercy of God you have already put your hand to the
plough; <span id="fr_3404"></span>[3405](#fn_3404.md) you have already gone
up upon the housetop like the apostle Peter. <span
id="fr_3405"></span>[3406](#fn_3405.md) Who when he became hungry among the
Jews had his hunger satisfied by the faith of Cornelius, and stilled the
craving caused by their unbelief through the conversion of the centurion
and other Gentiles. By the vessel let down from heaven to earth, the
four corners of which typified the four gospels, he was taught that all
men can be saved. Once more, this fair white sheet which in his vision
was taken up again was a symbol of the church which carries believers
from earth to heaven, an assurance that the Lord’s promise should be
fulfilled: “blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see
God.” <span id="fr_3406"></span>[3407](#fn_3406.md)

<span id="v.CXXV-p17"></span>All this means that I take you by the hand
and do my best to impress certain facts upon your mind; that, like a
skilled sailor who has been through many shipwrecks, I am anxious to
caution an inexperienced passenger of the risks before him. For on one
side is the Charybdis of covetousness, “the root of all evil;” <span
id="fr_3407"></span>[3408](#fn_3407.md) and on the other lurks the Scylla
of detraction girt with the railing hounds of which the apostle says:
“if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed
one of another.” <span id="fr_3408"></span>[3409](#fn_3408.md) Sometimes,
you must know, the quicksands of vice <span
id="fr_3409"></span>[3410](#fn_3409.md) suck us down as we sail at ease
through the calm water; and the desert of this world is not untenanted
by venomous reptiles.

<span id="v.CXXV-p21"></span>3. Those who navigate the Red Sea—where we
must pray that the true Pharaoh may be drowned with all his host—have to
encounter many difficulties and dangers before they reach the city of
Auxuma. <span id="fr_3410"></span>[3411](#fn_3410.md) Nomad savages and
ferocious wild beasts haunt the shores on either side. Thus travellers
must be always armed and on the alert, and they must carry with them a
whole year’s provisions. Moreover, so full are the waters of hidden
reefs and impassable shoals that a look-out has constantly to be kept
from the masthead to direct the helmsman how to shape his course. They
may count themselves fortunate if after six months they make the port of
the above-mentioned city. At this point the ocean begins, to cross which
a whole year hardly suffices. Then India is reached and the river
Ganges—called in holy scripture Pison—“which compasseth the whole land
of Havilah” <span id="fr_3411"></span>[3412](#fn_3411.md) and is said to
carry down with it—from its source in paradise—various dyes and
pigments. Here are found rubies and emeralds, glowing pearls and gems of
the first water, such as high born ladies passionately desire. There are
also mountains of gold which however men cannot approach by reason of
the griffins, dragons, and huge monsters which haunt them; for such are
the guardians which avarice needs for its treasures.

<span id="v.CXXV-p24"></span>4. What, you ask, is the drift of all this?
Surely it is clear enough. For if the merchants of the world undergo
such hardships to win a doubtful and passing gain, and if after seeking
it through many dangers they only keep it at risk of their lives; what
should Christ’s merchant do who “selleth all that he hath” that he may
acquire the “one pearl of great price;” who with his whole substance
buys a field that he may find therein a treasure which neither thief can
dig up nor robber carry away? <span id="fr_3412"></span>[3413](#fn_3412.md)

<span id="v.CXXV-p26"></span>5. I know that I must offend large numbers
who will be angry with my criticisms as aimed at their own deficiencies.
Yet such anger does but shew an uneasy conscience and they will pass a
far severer sentence on themselves than on me. For I shall not mention
names; or copy the licence of the old comedy <span
id="fr_3413"></span>[3414](#fn_3413.md) which criticized individuals. Wise
men and wise women will try to hide or rather to correct whatever they
perceive to be amiss in them; they will be more angry with themselves
than with me, and will not be disposed to heap curses upon the head of
their monitor. For he, although he is liable to the same charges, is
certainly superior in this that he is discontented with his own faults.

<span id="v.CXXV-p28"></span>6. I am told that your mother is a
religious woman, a widow of many years’ standing; and that when you were
a child she reared and taught you herself. Afterwards when you had spent
some time in the flourishing schools of Gaul she sent you to Rome,
sparing no expense and consoling herself for your absence by the thought
of the future that lay before you. She hoped to see the exuberance and
<span id="page_246">p. 246</span> <span
id="v.CXXV-Page_246"></span>glitter of your Gallic eloquence toned down
by Roman sobriety, for she saw that you required the rein more than the
spur. So we are told of the greatest orators of Greece that they
seasoned the bombast of Asia with the salt of Athens and pruned their
vines when they grew too fast. For they wished to fill the wine-press of
eloquence not with the tendrils of mere words but with the rich
grape-juice of good sense. Your mother has done the same thing for you;
you should, therefore, look up to her as a parent, love her as a tender
nurse, and venerate her as a saint. You must not imitate those who leave
their own relations and pay court to strange women. Their infamy is
apparent to all, for what they aim at under the pretence of pure
affection <span id="fr_3414"></span>[3415](#fn_3414.md) is simply illicit
intercourse. I know some women of riper years, indeed a good many, who,
finding pleasure in their young freedmen, make them their spiritual
children and thus, pretending to be mothers to them, gradually overcome
their own sense of shame and allow themselves in the licence of
marriage. Other women desert their maiden sisters and unite themselves
to strange widows. There are some who hate their parents and have no
affection for their kin. Their state of mind is indicated by a
restlessness which disdains excuses; they rend the veil of chastity and
put it aside like a cobweb. Such are the ways of women; not, indeed,
that men are any better. For there are persons to be seen who (for all
their girded loins, sombre garb, and long beards) are inseparable from
women, live under one roof with them, dine in their company, have young
girls to wait upon them, and, save that they do not claim to be called
husbands, are as good as married. Still it is no fault of Christianity
that a hypocrite falls into sin; rather, it is the confusion of the
Gentiles that the churches condemn what is condemned by all good men.

<span id="v.CXXV-p30"></span>7. But if for your part you desire to be a
monk and not merely to seem one, be more careful of your soul than of
your property; for in adopting a religious profession you have renounced
this once for all. Let your garments be squalid to shew that your mind
is white; and your tunic coarse to prove that you despise the world. But
give not way to pride lest your dress and language be found at variance.
Baths stimulate the senses and must, therefore, be avoided; for to
quench natural heat is the aim of chilling fasts. Yet even these must be
moderate, for, if they are carried to excess, they weaken the stomach
and by making more food necessary to it promote indigestion, that
fruitful parent of unclean desires. A frugal and temperate diet is good
for both body and soul.

<span id="v.CXXV-p31"></span>See your mother as often as you please but
not with other women, for their faces may dwell in your thoughts and so

<span id="v.CXXV-p32"></span>A secret wound may fester in your
breast. <span id="fr_3415"></span>[3416](#fn_3415.md)

<span id="v.CXXV-p34"></span>The maidservants who attend upon her you
must regard as so many snares laid to entrap you; for the lower their
condition is the more easy is it for you to effect their ruin. John the
Baptist had a religious mother and his father was a priest. <span
id="fr_3416"></span>[3417](#fn_3416.md) Yet neither his mother’s affection
nor his father’s wealth could induce him to live in his parents’ house
at the risk of his chastity. He lived in the desert, and seeking Christ
with his eyes refused to look at anything else. His rough garb, his
girdle made of skins, his diet of locusts and wild honey <span
id="fr_3417"></span>[3418](#fn_3417.md) were all alike designed to
encourage virtue and continence. The sons of the prophets, who were the
monks of the Old Testament, built for themselves huts by the waters of
Jordan and forsaking the crowded cities lived in these on pottage and
wild herbs. <span id="fr_3418"></span>[3419](#fn_3418.md) As long as you
are at home make your cell your paradise, <span
id="fr_3419"></span>[3420](#fn_3419.md) gather there the varied fruits of
scripture, let this be your favourite companion, and take its precepts
to your heart. If your eye offend you or your foot or your hand, cast
them from you. <span id="fr_3420"></span>[3421](#fn_3420.md) To spare your
soul spare nothing else. The Lord says: “whosoever looketh on a woman to
lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his
heart.” <span id="fr_3421"></span>[3422](#fn_3421.md) “Who can say,” writes
the wise man, “I have made my heart clean?” <span
id="fr_3422"></span>[3423](#fn_3422.md) The stars are not pure in the
Lord’s sight; how much less men whose whole life is one long
temptation. <span id="fr_3423"></span>[3424](#fn_3423.md) Woe be to us who
commit fornication every time that we cherish lust. “My sword,” God
says, “hath drunk its fill in heaven;” <span
id="fr_3424"></span>[3425](#fn_3424.md) much more then upon the earth with
its crop of thorns and thistles. <span
id="fr_3425"></span>[3426](#fn_3425.md) The chosen vessel <span
id="fr_3426"></span>[3427](#fn_3426.md) who had Christ’s name ever on his
lips kept under his body and brought it into subjection. <span
id="fr_3427"></span>[3428](#fn_3427.md) Yet even he was hindered by carnal
desire and had to do what he would not. As one suffering violence he
cries: “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of
this death?” <span id="fr_3428"></span>[3429](#fn_3428.md) Is it likely
then that you can pass without fall or wound, unless you keep your heart
with all diligence, <span id="fr_3429"></span>[3430](#fn_3429.md) and say
with the Saviour: “my mother and my brethren are these which hear the
word of God and do it.” <span id="fr_3430"></span>[3431](#fn_3430.md) This
may seem cruelty, but it is really affection. What <span
id="page_247">p. 247</span> <span id="v.CXXV-Page_247"></span>greater
proof, indeed, can there be of affection than to guard for a holy mother
a holy son? She too desired your eternal welfare and is content to
forego seeing you for a time that she may see you for ever with Christ.
She is like Hannah who brought forth Samuel not for her own solace but
for the service of the tabernacle. <span
id="fr_3431"></span>[3432](#fn_3431.md)

<span id="v.CXXV-p51"></span>The sons of Jonadab, we are told, drank
neither wine nor strong drink and dwelt in tents pitched wherever night
overtook them. <span id="fr_3432"></span>[3433](#fn_3432.md) According to
the psalter they were the first to undergo captivity; for, when the
Chaldæans began to ravage Judah they were compelled to take refuge in
cities. <span id="fr_3433"></span>[3434](#fn_3433.md)

<span id="v.CXXV-p54"></span>8. Others may think what they like and
follow each his own bent. But to me a town is a prison and solitude
paradise. Why do we long for the bustle of cities, we whose very name
speaks of loneliness? <span id="fr_3434"></span>[3435](#fn_3434.md) To fit
him for the leadership of the Jewish people Moses was trained for forty
years in the wilderness; <span id="fr_3435"></span>[3436](#fn_3435.md) and
it was not till after these that the shepherd of sheep became a shepherd
of men. The apostles were fishers on lake Gennesaret before they became
“fishers of men.” <span id="fr_3436"></span>[3437](#fn_3436.md) But at the
Lord’s call they forsook all that they had, father, net, and ship, and
bore their cross daily without so much as a rod in their hands.

<span id="v.CXXV-p58"></span>I say these things that, in case you desire
to enter the ranks of the clergy, you may learn what you must afterwards
teach, that you may offer a reasonable sacrifice <span
id="fr_3437"></span>[3438](#fn_3437.md) to Christ, that you may not think
yourself a finished soldier while still a raw recruit, or suppose
yourself a master while you are as yet only a learner. It does not
become one of my humble abilities to pass judgment upon the clergy or to
speak to the discredit of those who are ministers in the churches. They
have their own rank and station and must keep it. If ever you become one
of them my published letter to Nepotian <span
id="fr_3438"></span>[3439](#fn_3438.md) will teach you the mode of life
suitable to you in that vocation. At present I am dealing with the
forming and training of a monk; of one too who has put the yoke of
Christ upon his neck after receiving a liberal education in his younger
days.

<span id="v.CXXV-p61"></span>9. The first point to be considered is
whether you ought to live by yourself or in a monastery with
others. <span id="fr_3439"></span>[3440](#fn_3439.md) For my part I should
like you to have the society of holy men so as not to be thrown
altogether on your resources. For if you set out upon a road that is new
to you without a guide, you are sure to turn aside immediately either to
the right or to the left, to lay yourself open to the assaults of error,
to go too far or else not far enough, to weary yourself with running too
fast or to loiter by the way and to fall asleep. In loneliness pride
quickly creeps upon a man: if he has fasted for a little while and has
seen no one, he fancies himself a person of some note; forgetting who he
is, whence he comes, and whither he goes, he lets his thoughts riot
within and outwardly indulges in rash speech. Contrary to the apostle’s
wish he judges another man’s servants, <span
id="fr_3440"></span>[3441](#fn_3440.md) puts forth his hand to grasp
whatever his appetite desires, sleeps as long he pleases, fears nobody,
does what he likes, fancies everyone inferior to himself, spends more of
his time in cities than in his cell, and, while with the brothers he
affects to be retiring, rubs shoulders with the crowd in the streets.
What then, you will say? Do I condemn a solitary life? By no means: in
fact I have often commended it. But I wish to see the monastic schools
turn out soldiers who have no fear of the rough training of the desert,
who have exhibited the spectacle of a holy life for a considerable time,
who have made themselves last that they might be first, who have not
been overcome by hunger or satiety, whose joy is in poverty, who teach
virtue by their garb and mien, and who are too conscientious to
invent—as some silly men do—monstrous stories of struggles with demons,
designed to magnify their heroes in the eyes of the crowd and before all
to extort money from it.

<span id="v.CXXV-p64"></span>10. Quite recently we have seen to our
sorrow a fortune worthy of Crœsus brought to light by a monk’s death,
and a city’s alms, collected for the poor, left by will to his sons and
successors. After sinking to the bottom the iron has once more floated
upon the surface, <span id="fr_3441"></span>[3442](#fn_3441.md) and men
have again seen among the palm-trees the bitter waters of Marah. <span
id="fr_3442"></span>[3443](#fn_3442.md) In this there is, however, nothing
strange, for the man had for his companion and teacher one who turned
the hunger of the needy into a source of wealth for himself and kept
back sums left to the miserable to his own subsequent misery. Yet their
cry came up to heaven and entering God’s ears overcame His patience.
Wherefore, He sent an angel of woe to say to this new Carmelite, this
second Nabal, <span id="fr_3443"></span>[3444](#fn_3443.md) “Thou fool,
this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those
things be which thou hast provided?” <span
id="fr_3444"></span>[3445](#fn_3444.md)

<span id="v.CXXV-p69"></span>11. If I wish you then not to live with
your mother, it is for the reasons given above, and above all for the
two following. If she offers you delicacies to eat, you will grieve her
by refusing them; and if you take them, you will add fuel to the flame
that already burns within <span id="page_248">p. 248</span> <span
id="v.CXXV-Page_248"></span>you. Again in a house where there are so
many girls you will see in the daytime sights that will tempt you at
night. Never take your hand or your eyes off your book; learn the psalms
word for word, pray without ceasing, <span
id="fr_3445"></span>[3446](#fn_3445.md) be always on the alert, and let no
vain thoughts lay hold upon you. Direct both body and mind to the Lord,
overcome wrath by patience, love the knowledge of scripture, and you
will no longer love the sins of the flesh. Do not let your mind become a
prey to excitement, for if this effects a lodgment in your breast it
will have dominion over you and will lead you into the great
transgression. <span id="fr_3446"></span>[3447](#fn_3446.md) Always have
some work on hand, that the devil may find you busy. If apostles who had
the right to live of the Gospel <span
id="fr_3447"></span>[3448](#fn_3447.md) laboured with their own hands that
they might be chargeable to no man, <span
id="fr_3448"></span>[3449](#fn_3448.md) and bestowed relief upon others
whose carnal things they had a claim to reap as having sown unto them
spiritual things; <span id="fr_3449"></span>[3450](#fn_3449.md) why do you
not provide a supply to meet your needs? Make creels of reeds or weave
baskets out of pliant osiers. Hoe your ground; mark out your garden into
even plots; and when you have sown your cabbages or set your plants
convey water to them in conduits; that you may see with your own eyes
the lovely vision of the poet:

<span id="v.CXXV-p75"></span>Art draws fresh water from the hilltop near

<span id="v.CXXV-p76"></span>Till the stream plashing down among the
rocks

<span id="v.CXXV-p77"></span>Cools the parched meadows and allays their
thirst. <span id="fr_3450"></span>[3451](#fn_3450.md)

<span id="v.CXXV-p79"></span>Graft unfruitful stocks with buds and slips
that you may shortly be rewarded for your toil by plucking sweet apples
from them. Construct also hives for bees, for to these the proverbs of
Solomon send you, <span id="fr_3451"></span>[3452](#fn_3451.md) and you may
learn from the tiny creatures how to order a monastery and to discipline
a kingdom. Twist lines too for catching fish, and copy books; that your
hand may earn your food and your mind may be satisfied with reading. For
“every one that is idle is a prey to vain desires.” <span
id="fr_3452"></span>[3453](#fn_3452.md) In Egypt the monasteries make it a
rule to receive none who are not willing to work; for they regard labour
as necessary not only for the support of the body but also for the
salvation of the soul. Do not let your mind stray into harmful thoughts,
or, like Jerusalem in her whoredoms, open its feet to every chance
comer. <span id="fr_3453"></span>[3454](#fn_3453.md)

<span id="v.CXXV-p83"></span>12. In my youth when the desert walled me
in with its solitude I was still unable to endure the promptings of sin
and the natural heat of my blood; and, although I tried by frequent
fasts to break the force of both, my mind still surged with \[evil\]
thoughts. <span id="fr_3454"></span>[3455](#fn_3454.md) To subdue its
turbulence I betook myself to a brother <span
id="fr_3455"></span>[3456](#fn_3455.md) who before his conversion had been
a Jew and asked him to teach me Hebrew. Thus, after having familiarised
myself with the pointedness of Quintilian, the fluency of Cicero, the
seriousness of Fronto and the gentleness of Pliny, I began to learn my
letters anew and to study to pronounce words both harsh and guttural.
What labour I spent upon this task, what difficulties I went through,
how often I despaired, how often I gave over and then in my eagerness to
learn commenced again, can be attested both by myself the subject of
this misery and by those who then lived with me. But I thank the Lord
that from this seed of learning sown in bitterness I now cull sweet
fruits.

<span id="v.CXXV-p86"></span>13. I will recount also another thing that
I saw in Egypt. There was in a community a young Greek the flame of
whose desire neither continual fasting nor the severest labour could
avail to quench. He was in great danger of falling, when the father of
the monastery saved him by the following device. He gave orders to one
of the older brothers to pursue him with objurgations and reproaches,
and then after having thus wronged him to be beforehand with him in
laying a complaint against him. When witnesses were called they spoke
always on behalf of the aggressor. On hearing such falsehoods he used to
weep that no one gave credit to the truth; the father alone used
cleverly to put in a word for him that he might not be “swallowed up
with overmuch sorrow.” <span id="fr_3456"></span>[3457](#fn_3456.md) To
make the story short, a year passed in this way and at the expiration of
it the young man was asked concerning his former evil thoughts and
whether they still troubled him. “Good gracious,” he replied, “how can I
find pleasure in fornication when I am not allowed so much as to live?”
Had he been a solitary hermit, by whose aid could he have overcome the
temptations that assailed him?

<span id="v.CXXV-p88"></span>14. The world’s philosophers drive out an
old passion by instilling a new one; they hammer out one nail by
hammering in another. <span id="fr_3457"></span>[3458](#fn_3457.md) It was
on this principle that the seven princes of Persia acted towards king
Ahasuerus, for they subdued his regret for queen Vashti by inducing him
to love other maidens. <span id="fr_3458"></span>[3459](#fn_3458.md) But
whereas they cured one fault by another fault and one sin by another
sin, we must overcome our faults by learning to love the opposite
virtues. “Depart from evil,” says the psalmist, “and do good; seek peace
and pursue it.” <span id="fr_3459"></span>[3460](#fn_3459.md) For if we do
not hate evil we cannot love <span id="page_249">p. 249</span> <span
id="v.CXXV-Page_249"></span>good. Nay more, we must do good if we are to
depart from evil. We must seek peace if we are to avoid war. And it is
not enough merely to seek it; when we have found it and when it flees
before us we must pursue it with all our energies. For “it passeth all
understanding;” <span id="fr_3460"></span>[3461](#fn_3460.md) it is the
habitation of God. As the psalmist says, “in peace also is his
habitation.” <span id="fr_3461"></span>[3462](#fn_3461.md) The pursuing of
peace is a fine metaphor and may be compared with the apostle’s words,
“pursuing hospitality.” <span id="fr_3462"></span>[3463](#fn_3462.md) It is
not enough, he means, for us to invite guests with our lips; we should
be as eager to detain them as though they were robbers carrying off our
savings.

<span id="v.CXXV-p95"></span>15. No art is ever learned without a
master. Even dumb animals and wild herds follow leaders of their own.
Bees have princes, and cranes fly after one of their number in the shape
of a Y. <span id="fr_3463"></span>[3464](#fn_3463.md) There is but one
emperor and each province has but one judge. Rome was founded by two
brothers, <span id="fr_3464"></span>[3465](#fn_3464.md) but, as it could
not have two kings at once, was inaugurated by an act of fratricide. So
too Esau and Jacob strove in Rebekah’s womb. <span
id="fr_3465"></span>[3466](#fn_3465.md) Each church has a single bishop, a
single archpresbyter, a single archdeacon; <span
id="fr_3466"></span>[3467](#fn_3466.md) and every ecclesiastical order is
subjected to its own rulers. A ship has but one pilot, a house but one
master, and the largest army moves at the command of one man. That I may
not tire you by heaping up instances, my drift is simply this. Do not
rely on your own discretion, but live in a monastery. For there, while
you will be under the control of one father, you will have many
companions; and these will teach you, one humility, another patience, a
third silence, and a fourth meekness. You will do as others wish; you
will eat what you are told to eat; you will wear what clothes are given
you; you will perform the task allotted to you; you will obey one whom
you do not like, you will come to bed tired out; you will go to sleep on
your feet and you will be forced to rise before you have had sufficient
rest. When your turn comes, you will recite the psalms, a task which
requires not a well modulated voice but genuine emotion. The apostle
says: “I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the
understanding also,” <span id="fr_3467"></span>[3468](#fn_3467.md) and to
the Ephesians, “make melody in your hearts to the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3468"></span>[3469](#fn_3468.md) For he had read the precept of the
psalmist: “Sing ye praises with understanding.” <span
id="fr_3469"></span>[3470](#fn_3469.md) You will serve the brothers, you
will wash the guests’ feet; if you suffer wrong you will bear it in
silence; the superior of the community you will fear as a master and
love as a father. Whatever he may order you to do you will believe to be
wholesome for you. You will not pass judgment upon those who are placed
over you, for your duty will be to obey them and to do what you are
told, according to the words spoken by Moses: “keep silence and hearken,
O Israel.” <span id="fr_3470"></span>[3471](#fn_3470.md) You will have so
many tasks to occupy you that you will have no time for \[evil\]
thoughts; and while you pass from one thing to another and fresh work
follows work done, you will only be able to think of what you have it in
charge at the moment to do.

<span id="v.CXXV-p104"></span>16. But I myself have seen monks of quite
a different stamp from this, men whose renunciation of the world has
consisted in a change of clothes and a verbal profession, while their
real life and their former habits have remained unchanged. Their
property has increased rather than diminished. They still have the same
servants and keep the same table. Out of cheap glasses and common
earthenware they swallow gold. With servants about them in swarms they
claim for themselves the name of hermits. Others who though poor think
themselves discerning, walk as solemnly as pageants <span
id="fr_3471"></span>[3472](#fn_3471.md) through the streets and do nothing
but snarl <span id="fr_3472"></span>[3473](#fn_3472.md) at every one whom
they meet. Others shrug their shoulders and croak out what is best known
to themselves. While they keep their eyes fixed upon the earth, they
balance swelling words upon their tongues. <span
id="fr_3473"></span>[3474](#fn_3473.md) Only a crier is wanted to persuade
you that it is his excellency the prefect who is coming along. Some too
there are who from the dampness of their cells and from the severity of
their fasts, from their weariness of solitude and from excessive study
have a singing in their ears day and night and turn melancholy mad so as
to need the poultices of Hippocrates <span
id="fr_3474"></span>[3475](#fn_3474.md) more than exhortations from me.
Great numbers are unable to break free from the crafts and trades they
have previously practised. They no longer call themselves dealers but
they carry on the same traffic as before; seeking for themselves not
“food and raiment” <span id="fr_3475"></span>[3476](#fn_3475.md) as the
apostle directs, but money-profits and these greater than are looked for
by men of the world. In former days the greed of sellers was kept within
bounds by the action of the Ædiles or as the Greeks call them
market-inspectors, <span id="fr_3476"></span>[3477](#fn_3476.md) and men
could not then cheat with impunity. But now persons who profess religion
are not ashamed to seek unjust profits and the good name of Christianity
is more <span id="page_250">p. 250</span> <span
id="v.CXXV-Page_250"></span>often a cloak for fraud than a victim to it.
I am ashamed to say it, yet it must be said—we are at least bound to
blush for our infamy—while in public we hold out our hands for alms we
conceal gold beneath our rags; and to the amazement of every one after
living as poor men we die rich and with our purses well-filled.

<span id="v.CXXV-p111"></span>But you, since you will not be alone but
one of a community, will have no temptation to act thus. Things at first
compulsory will become habitual. You will set to work unbidden and will
find pleasure in your toil. You will forget things which are behind and
will reach forth to those which are before. <span
id="fr_3477"></span>[3478](#fn_3477.md) You will think less of the evil
that others do than of the good you ought to do.

<span id="v.CXXV-p113"></span>17. Be not led by the multitude of those
who sin, neither let the host of those who perish tempt you to say
secretly: “What? must all be lost who live in cities? Behold, they
continue to enjoy their property, they serve churches, they frequent
baths, they do not disdain cosmetics, and yet they are universally
well-spoken of.” To this kind of remark I have before replied and now
shortly reply again that the object of this little work is not to
discuss the clergy but to lay down rules for a monk. The clergy are holy
men and their lives are always worthy of praise. Rouse yourself then and
so live in your monastery that you may deserve to be a clergyman, that
you may preserve your youth from defilement, that you may go to Christ’s
altar as a virgin out of her chamber. See that you are well-reported of
without and that women are familiar with your reputation but not with
your appearance. When you come to mature years, if, that is, you live so
long, and when you have been chosen into the ranks of the clergy either
by the people of the city or by its bishop, act in a way that befits a
clergyman, and choose for your models the best of your brothers. For in
every rank and condition of life the bad are mingled with the good.

<span id="v.CXXV-p114"></span>18. Do not be carried away by some mad
caprice and rush into authorship. Learn long and carefully what you
propose to teach. Do not credit all that flatterers say to you, or, I
should rather say, do not lend too ready an ear to those who mean to
mock you. They will fawn upon you with fulsome praise and do their best
to blind your judgment; yet if you suddenly look behind you, you will
find that they are making gestures of derision with their hands, either
a stork’s neck or the flapping ears of a donkey or a thirsty dog’s
protruding tongue. <span id="fr_3478"></span>[3479](#fn_3478.md)

<span id="v.CXXV-p116"></span>Never speak evil of anyone or suppose that
you make yourself better by assailing the reputations of others. The
charges we bring against them often come home to ourselves; we inveigh
against faults which are as much ours as theirs; and so our eloquence
ends by telling against ourselves. It is as though dumb persons were to
criticize orators. When the grunter <span
id="fr_3479"></span>[3480](#fn_3479.md) wished to speak he used to come
forward at a snail’s pace <span id="fr_3480"></span>[3481](#fn_3480.md) and
to utter a word now and again with such long pauses between that he
seemed less making a speech than gasping for breath. Then, when he had
placed his table and arranged on it his pile of books, he used to knit
his brow, to draw in his nostrils, to wrinkle his forehead and to snap
his fingers, signs meant to engage the attention of his pupils. Then he
would pour forth a torrent of nonsense and declaim so vehemently against
every one that you would take him for a critic like Longinus <span
id="fr_3481"></span>[3482](#fn_3481.md) or fancy him a second Cato the
Censor <span id="fr_3482"></span>[3483](#fn_3482.md) passing judgment on
Roman eloquence and excluding whom he pleased from the senate of the
learned. As he had plenty of money he made himself still more popular by
giving entertainments. Numbers of persons shared in his hospitality; and
thus it was not surprising that when he went out he was surrounded
always by a buzzing throng. At home he was a monster like Nero, abroad a
paragon like Cato. Made up of different and opposing natures, as a whole
he baffled description. You would say that he was formed of jarring
elements like that unnatural and unheard of monster of which the poet
tells us that it was ‘in front a lion, behind a dragon, in the middle
the goat whose name it bears.’ <span
id="fr_3483"></span>[3484](#fn_3483.md)

<span id="v.CXXV-p122"></span>19. Men such as these you must never look
at or associate with. Nor must you turn aside your heart unto words of
evil <span id="fr_3484"></span>[3485](#fn_3484.md) lest the psalmist say to
you: “Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest
thine own mother’s son,” <span id="fr_3485"></span>[3486](#fn_3485.md) and
lest you become as “the sons of men whose teeth are spears and
arrows,” <span id="fr_3486"></span>[3487](#fn_3486.md) and as the man whose
“words were softer than oil yet were they drawn swords.” <span
id="fr_3487"></span>[3488](#fn_3487.md) The Preacher expresses this more
clearly still when he says: “Surely the serpent will bite where there is
no enchantment, and the slan<span id="page_251">p. 251</span> <span
id="v.CXXV-Page_251"></span>derer is no better.” <span
id="fr_3488"></span>[3489](#fn_3488.md) But you will say, ‘I am not given
to detraction, but how can I check others who are?’ If we put forward
such a plea as this it can only be that we may “practise wicked works
with men that work iniquity.” <span id="fr_3489"></span>[3490](#fn_3489.md)
Yet Christ is not deceived by this device. It is not I but an apostle
who says: “Be not deceived; God is not mocked.” <span
id="fr_3490"></span>[3491](#fn_3490.md) “Man looketh upon the outward
appearance but the Lord looketh upon the heart.” <span
id="fr_3491"></span>[3492](#fn_3491.md) And in the proverbs Solomon tells
us that as “the north wind driveth away rain, so doth an angry
countenance a backbiting tongue.” <span
id="fr_3492"></span>[3493](#fn_3492.md) It sometimes happens that an arrow
when it is aimed at a hard object rebounds upon the bowman, wounding the
would-be wounder, and thus, the words are fulfilled, “they were turned
aside like a deceitful bow,” <span id="fr_3493"></span>[3494](#fn_3493.md)
and in another passage: “whoso casteth a stone on high casteth it on his
own head.” <span id="fr_3494"></span>[3495](#fn_3494.md) So when a
slanderer sees anger in the countenance of his hearer who will not hear
him but stops his ears that he may not hear of blood, <span
id="fr_3495"></span>[3496](#fn_3495.md) he becomes silent on the moment,
his face turns pale, his lips stick fast, his mouth becomes parched.
Wherefore the same wise man says: “meddle not with them that are given
to detraction: for their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth
the ruin of them both?” <span id="fr_3496"></span>[3497](#fn_3496.md) of
him who speaks, that is, and of him who hears. Truth does not love
corners or seek whisperers. To Timothy it is said, “Against an elder
receive not an accusation suddenly; but him that sinneth rebuke before
all, that others also may fear.” <span
id="fr_3497"></span>[3498](#fn_3497.md) When a man is advanced in years you
must not be too ready to believe evil of him; his past life is itself a
defence, and so also is his rank as an elder. Still, since we are but
human and sometimes in spite of the ripeness of our years fall into the
sins of youth, if I do wrong and you wish to correct me, accuse me
openly of my fault: do not backbite me secretly. “Let the righteous
smite me, it shall be a kindness, and let him reprove me; but let not
the oil of the sinner enrich my head.” <span
id="fr_3498"></span>[3499](#fn_3498.md) For what says the apostle? “Whom
the Lord loveth, he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he
receiveth.” <span id="fr_3499"></span>[3500](#fn_3499.md) By the mouth of
Isaiah the Lord speaks thus: “O my people, they who call you happy cause
you to err and destroy the way of your paths.” <span
id="fr_3500"></span>[3501](#fn_3500.md) How do you help me by telling my
misdeeds to others? You may, without my knowing of it, wound some one
else by the narration of my sins or rather of those which you
slanderously attribute to me; and while you are eager to spread the news
in all quarters, you may pretend to confide in each individual as though
you had spoken to no one else. Such a course has for its object not my
correction but the indulgence of your own failing. The Lord gives
commandment that those who sin against us are to be arraigned privately
or else in the presence of a witness, and that if they refuse to hear
reason, the matter is to be laid before the church, and those who
persist in their wickedness are to be regarded as heathen men and
publicans. <span id="fr_3501"></span>[3502](#fn_3501.md)

<span id="v.CXXV-p141"></span>20. I lay great emphasis on these points
that I may deliver a young man who is dear to me from the itching both
of the tongue and of the ears: that, since he has been born again in
Christ, I may present him without spot or wrinkle <span
id="fr_3502"></span>[3503](#fn_3502.md) as a chaste virgin, <span
id="fr_3503"></span>[3504](#fn_3503.md) chaste in mind as well as in body;
that the virginity of which he boasts may be more than nominal and that
he may not be shut out by the bridegroom because being unprovided with
the oil of good works his lamp has gone out. <span
id="fr_3504"></span>[3505](#fn_3504.md) In Proculus you have a reverend and
most learned prelate, <span id="fr_3505"></span>[3506](#fn_3505.md) able by
the sound of his voice to do more for you than I with my written sheets
and sure to direct you on your path by daily homilies. He will not
suffer you to turn to the right hand or to the left or to leave the
king’s highway; for to this Israel pledges itself to keep in its hasty
passage to the land of promise. <span
id="fr_3506"></span>[3507](#fn_3506.md) May God hear the voice of the
church’s supplication. “Lord, ordain peace for us, for thou hast also
wrought all our works for us.” <span
id="fr_3507"></span>[3508](#fn_3507.md) May our renunciation of the world
be made freely and not under compulsion! May we seek poverty gladly to
win its glory and not suffer anguish because others lay it upon us! For
the rest amid our present miseries with the sword making havoc around
us, he is rich enough who has bread sufficient for his need, and he is
abundantly powerful who is not reduced to be a slave. Exuperius <span
id="fr_3508"></span>[3509](#fn_3508.md) the reverend bishop of Toulouse,
imitating the widow of Zarephath, <span
id="fr_3509"></span>[3510](#fn_3509.md) feeds others though hungry himself.
His face is pale with fasting, yet it is the cravings of others that
torment him most. In fact he has bestowed his whole substance to meet
the needs of Christ’s poor. Yet none is richer than he, for his wicker
basket contains the body of the Lord, and his plain glass-cup the
precious blood. Like his Master he has banished greed out of the temple;
and without either scourge of cords or words of chiding he has
overthrown the chairs of them that sell doves, that is, the gifts of the
<span id="page_252">p. 252</span> <span id="v.CXXV-Page_252"></span>Holy
Spirit. He has upset the tables of Mammon and has scattered the money of
the money-changers; zealous that the house of God may be called a house
of prayer and not a den of robbers. <span
id="fr_3510"></span>[3511](#fn_3510.md) In his steps follow closely and in
those of others like him in virtue, whom the priesthood makes poor men
and more than ever humble. Or if you will be perfect, go out with
Abraham from your country and from your kindred, and go whither you know
not. <span id="fr_3511"></span>[3512](#fn_3511.md) If you have substance,
sell it and give to the poor. If you have none, then are you free from a
great burthen. Destitute yourself, follow a destitute Christ. The task
is a hard one, it is great and difficult; but the reward is also great.
