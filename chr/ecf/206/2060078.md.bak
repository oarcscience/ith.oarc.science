id="v.LXVII-p1.1"></span>Letter LXVII. From Augustine.</span>

<span id="v.LXVII-p2"></span>Jerome having written him a short letter
(no longer extant) Augustine now replies. He speaks with approval of
Jerome’s treatise *On Famous Men*, incorrectly called the *Epitaph* (see
Letter CXII. §3). He also repeats his objections to Jerome’s account of
the quarrel between Paul and Peter at Antioch and then concludes with a
request that he will draw up a short notice of the principal heresies
condemned by the Church.

<span id="v.LXVII-p3"></span>Like the preceding letter of Augustine
(Letter LVI.) this also failed to reach Jerome. It was however published
in the West, but without Augustine’s knowledge and by degrees its
contents found their way to Bethlehem where they caused much annoyance
and pain. The date of the letter is 397 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.LXVII-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> In Augustine’s correspondence in
this Library it is printed in full as Letter XL.
