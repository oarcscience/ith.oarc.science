<span id="v.LV-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.LV-p1.1"></span>Letter LV. To Amandus.</span>

<span id="v.LV-p2"></span>A very interesting letter. Amandus a presbyter
of Burdigala (Bourdeaux) had written to Jerome for an explanation of
three passages of scripture, viz. [Matt.
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#034.md), [1 Cor.
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#018.md), [1 Cor.
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#025.md),
[26](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#026.md)<span id="v.LV-p2.1"></span>, and
had in the same letter on behalf of a ‘sister’ (supposed by Thierry to
have been Fabiola) put the following question: ‘Can a woman who has
divorced her first husband on account of his vices and who has during
his lifetime under compulsion married again, communicate with the Church
without first doing penance?’ Jerome in his reply gives the explanations
asked for but answers the farther question, that concerning the
‘sister,’ with an emphatic negative. Written about the year 394 <span
class="c17"><span id="v.LV-p2.2"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.LV-p3"></span>1. A short letter does not admit of long
explanations; compressing much matter into a small space it can only
give a few words to topics which suggest many thoughts. You ask me what
is the meaning of the passage in the gospel according to Matthew, “take
no thought for the morrow. Sufficient unto the day is the evil
thereof.” <span id="fr_1621"></span>[1622](#fn_1621.md) In the holy
scriptures “the morrow” signifies the time to come. Thus in Genesis
Jacob says: “So shall my righteousness answer for me to-morrow.” <span
id="fr_1622"></span>[1623](#fn_1622.md) Again when the two tribes of Reuben
and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh had built an altar and when all
Israel had sent to them an embassy, they made answer to Phinehas the
high priest that they had built the altar lest “to-morrow” it might be
said to their children, “ye have no part in the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1623"></span>[1624](#fn_1623.md) You may find many similar passages
in the old instrument. <span id="fr_1624"></span>[1625](#fn_1624.md) While
then Christ forbids us to take thought for things future, He has allowed
us to do so for things present, knowing as He does the frailty of our
mortal condition. His remaining words “sufficient unto the day is the
evil thereof” are to be understood as meaning that it is sufficient for
us to think of the present troubles of this life. Why need we extend our
thoughts to contingencies, to objects which we either cannot obtain or
else having obtained must soon relinquish? The Greek word <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.LV-p7.1"></span>κακία</span> rendered in the
Latin version “wickedness” has two distinct meanings, wickedness and
tribulation, which latter the Greek call <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.LV-p7.2"></span>κακωσίν</span> and in this passage “tribulation”
would be a better rendering than “wickedness.” But if any one demurs to
this and insists that the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.LV-p7.3"></span>κακία</span> must mean “wickedness” and not
“tribulation” or “trouble,” the meaning must be the same as in the words
“the whole world lieth in wickedness” <span
id="fr_1625"></span>[1626](#fn_1625.md) and as in the Lord’s prayer in the
clause, “deliver us from evil:” <span
id="fr_1626"></span>[1627](#fn_1626.md) the purport of the passage will
then be that our present conflict with the wickedness of this world
should be enough for us.

<span id="v.LV-p10"></span>2. Secondly, you ask me concerning the
passage in the first epistle of the blessed apostle Paul to the
Corinthians where he says: “every sin that a man doeth is without the
body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own
body.” <span id="fr_1627"></span>[1628](#fn_1627.md) Let us go back a
little farther and read on until we come to these words, for we must not
seek to learn the whole meaning of the section, from the concluding
parts of it, or, if I may so say, from the tail of the chapter. <span
id="fr_1628"></span>[1629](#fn_1628.md) “The body is not for fornication
but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. And God hath both raised up
the Lord and will also raise up us \[with Him\] by his own power. Know
ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the
members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.
What! Know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? For
two, saith he, shall be one flesh. But he that is joined unto the Lord
is one spirit. Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without
the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own
body,” <span id="fr_1629"></span>[1630](#fn_1629.md) and so on. The holy
apostle has been arguing against excess and has just before said “meats
for the belly and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy <span
id="page_110">p. 110</span> <span id="v.LV-Page_110"></span>both it and
them.” <span id="fr_1630"></span>[1631](#fn_1630.md) Now he comes to treat
of fornication. For excess in eating is the mother of lust; a belly that
is distended with food and saturated with draughts of wine is sure to
lead to sensual passion. As has been elsewhere said “the arrangement of
man’s organs suggests the course of his vices.” <span
id="fr_1631"></span>[1632](#fn_1631.md) Accordingly all such sins as theft,
manslaughter, pillage, perjury, and the like can be repented of after
they have been committed; and, however much interest may tempt him,
conscience always smites the offender. It is only lust and sensual
pleasure that in the very hour of penitence undergo once more the
temptations of the past, the itch of the flesh, and the allurements of
sin; so that the very thought which we bestow on the correction of such
transgressions becomes in itself a new source of sin. Or to put the
matter in a different light: other sins are outside of us; and whatever
we do we do against others. But fornication defiles the fornicator both
in conscience and body; and in accordance with the words of the Lord,
“for this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to
his wife; and they twain shall be one flesh,” <span
id="fr_1632"></span>[1633](#fn_1632.md) he too becomes one body with a
harlot and sins against his own body by making what is the temple of
Christ the body of a harlot. Not to pass over any suggestion of the
Greek commentators, I shall give you one more explanation. It is one
thing, they say, to sin with the body, and another to sin in the body.
Theft, manslaughter, and all other sins except fornication we commit
with our hands outside ourselves. Fornication alone we commit inside
ourselves in our bodies and not with our bodies upon others. The
preposition ‘with’ denotes the instrument used in sinning, while the
preposition ‘in’ signifies the sphere of the passion is ourselves. Some
again give this explanation that according to the scripture a man’s body
is his wife and that when a man commits fornication he is said to sin
against his own body that is against his wife inasmuch as he defiles her
by his own fornication and causes her though herself free from sin to
become a sinner through her intercourse with him.

<span id="v.LV-p17"></span>3. I find joined to your letter of inquiries
a short paper containing the following words: “ask him, (that is me,)
whether a woman who has left her husband on the ground that he is an
adulterer and sodomite and has found herself compelled to take another
may in the lifetime of him whom she first left be in communion with the
church without doing penance for her fault.” As I read the case put I
recall the verse “they make excuses for their sins.” <span
id="fr_1633"></span>[1634](#fn_1633.md) We are all human and all indulgent
to our own faults; and what our own will leads us to do we attribute to
a necessity of nature. It is as though a young man were to say, “I am
over-borne by my body, the glow of nature kindles my passions, the
structure of my frame and its reproductive organs call for sexual
intercourse.” Or again a murderer might say, “I was in want, I stood in
need of food, I had nothing to cover me. If I shed the blood of another,
it was to save myself from dying of cold and hunger.” Tell the sister,
therefore, who thus enquires of me concerning her condition, not my
sentence but that of the apostle. “Know ye not, brethren (for I speak to
them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as
long as he liveth? For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the
law to her husband, so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead,
she is loosed from the law of her husband. So then, if, while her
husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an
adulteress.” <span id="fr_1634"></span>[1635](#fn_1634.md) And in another
place: “the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but
if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she
will; only in the Lord.” <span id="fr_1635"></span>[1636](#fn_1635.md) The
apostle has thus cut away every plea and has clearly declared that, if a
woman marries again while her husband is living, she is an adulteress.
You must not speak to me of the violence of a ravisher, a mother’s
pleading, a father’s bidding, the influence of relatives, the insolence
and the intrigues of servants, household losses. A husband may be an
adulterer or a sodomite, he may be stained with every crime and may have
been left by his wife because of his sins; yet he is still her husband
and, so long as he lives, she may not marry another. The apostle does
not promulgate this decree on his own authority but on that of Christ
who speaks in him. For he has followed the words of Christ in the
gospel: “whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of
fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry
her that is divorced, committeth adultery.” <span
id="fr_1636"></span>[1637](#fn_1636.md) Mark what he says: “whosoever shall
marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.” Whether she has put
away her husband or her husband her, the man who marries her is still an
adulterer. Wherefore the apostles seeing how heavy the yoke of marriage
was thus made said to Him: “if the case of the man be so with his wife,
it is not good to marry,” and the Lord replied, “he that is able to
receive it, let him receive it.” <span id="page_111">p. 111</span> <span
id="v.LV-Page_111"></span>And immediately by the instance of the three
eunuchs he shows the blessedness of virginity which is bound by no
carnal tie. <span id="fr_1637"></span>[1638](#fn_1637.md)

<span id="v.LV-p23"></span>4. I have not been able quite to determine
what it is that she means by the words “has found herself compelled” to
marry again. What is this compulsion of which she speaks? Was she
overborne by a crowd and ravished against her will? If so, why has she
not, thus victimized, subsequently put away her ravisher? Let her read
the books of Moses and she will find that if violence is offered to a
betrothed virgin in a city and she does not cry out, she is punished as
an adulteress: but if she is forced in the field, she is innocent of sin
and her ravisher alone is amenable to the laws. <span
id="fr_1638"></span>[1639](#fn_1638.md) Therefore if your sister, who, as
she says, has been forced into a second union, wishes to receive the
body of Christ and not to be accounted an adulteress, let her do
penance; so far at least as from the time she begins to repent to have
no farther intercourse with that second husband who ought to be called
not a husband but an adulterer. If this seems hard to her and if she
cannot leave one whom she has once loved and will not prefer the Lord to
sensual pleasure, let her hear the declaration of the apostle: “ye
cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils: ye cannot be
partakers of the Lord’s table and of the table of devils,” <span
id="fr_1639"></span>[1640](#fn_1639.md) and in another place: “what
communion hath light with darkness? and what concord hath Christ with
Belial?” <span id="fr_1640"></span>[1641](#fn_1640.md) What I am about to
say may sound novel but after all it is not new but old for it is
supported by the witness of the old testament. If she leaves her second
husband and desires to be reconciled with her first, she cannot be so
now; for it is written in Deuteronomy: “When a man hath taken a wife,
and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his
eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her; then let him write
her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of
his house. And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be
another man’s wife. And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a
bill of divorcement and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of
his house; or if the latter husband die which took her to be his wife;
her former husband, which sent her away may not take her again to be his
wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the
Lord: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the Lord thy God
giveth thee for an inheritance.” <span
id="fr_1641"></span>[1642](#fn_1641.md) Wherefore, I beseech you, do your
best to comfort her and to urge her to seek salvation. Diseased flesh
calls for the knife and the searing-iron. The wound is to blame and not
the healing art, if with a cruelty that is really kindness a physician
to spare does not spare, and to be merciful is cruel. <span
id="fr_1642"></span>[1643](#fn_1642.md)

<span id="v.LV-p29"></span>5. Your third and last question relates to
the passage in the same epistle where the apostle in discussing the
resurrection, comes to the words: “for he must reign, till he hath put
all things under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is
death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, all
things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did
put all things under him. And when all things shall be subdued unto him,
then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things
under him that God may be all in all.” <span
id="fr_1643"></span>[1644](#fn_1643.md) I am surprised that you have
resolved to question me about this passage when that reverend man,
Hilary, bishop of Poictiers, has occupied the eleventh book of his
treatise against the Arians with a full examination and explanation of
it. Yet I may at least say a few words. The chief stumbling-block in the
passage is that the Son is said to be subject to the Father. Now which
is the more shameful and humiliating, to be subject to the Father (often
a mark of loving devotion as in the psalm “truly my soul is subject unto
God” <span id="fr_1644"></span>[1645](#fn_1644) .md) or to be crucified and
made the curse of the cross? For “cursed is everyone that hangeth on a
tree.” <span id="fr_1645"></span>[1646](#fn_1645.md) If Christ then for our
sakes was made a curse that He might deliver us from the curse of the
law, are you surprised that He is also for our sakes subject to the
Father to make us too subject to Him as He says in the gospel: “No man
cometh unto the Father but by me,” <span
id="fr_1646"></span>[1647](#fn_1646.md) and “I, if I be lifted up from the
earth, will draw all men unto me.” <span
id="fr_1647"></span>[1648](#fn_1647.md) Christ then is subject to the
Father in the faithful; for all believers, nay the whole human race, are
accounted members of His body. But in unbelievers, that is in Jews,
heathens, and heretics, He is said to be not subject; for these members
of His body are not subject to the faith. But in the end of the world
when all His members shall see Christ, that is their own body, reigning,
they also shall be made subject to Christ, that is to their own body,
that the whole of Christ’s body may be subject unto God and the Father,
and that God may be all in all. He does not say “that the Father may be
all in all” but that “God” may be, a title which properly belongs to the
Trinity and may be referred not only to the Father but also to the Son
and to the Holy Ghost. <span id="page_112">p. 112</span> <span
id="v.LV-Page_112"></span>His meaning therefore is “that humanity may be
subject to the Godhead.” By humanity we here intend not that gentleness
and kindness which the Greeks call philanthropy but the whole human
race. Moreover when he says “that God may be all in all,” it is to be
taken in this sense. At present our Lord and Saviour is not all in all,
but only a part in each of us. For instance He is wisdom in Solomon,
generosity in David, patience in Job, knowledge of things to come in
Daniel, faith in Peter, zeal in Phinehas and Paul, virginity in John,
and other virtues in others. But when the end of all things shall come,
then shall He be all in all, for then the saints shall severally possess
all the virtues and all will possess Christ in His entirety.
