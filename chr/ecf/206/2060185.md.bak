<span id="vii.ii.v"></span>

<span id="vii.ii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.ii.v-p1.1"></span>Preface to the Book of Hebrew
Questions.</span>

<span id="vii.ii.v-p2"></span>Written <span class="c17"><span
id="vii.ii.v-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 388. For the scope and character
of this work, see Prolegomena.

<span id="vii.ii.v-p3"></span>The object of the Preface to a book is to
set forth the argument of the work which follows; but I am compelled to
begin by answering what has been said against me. My case is somewhat
like that of Terence, who turned the scenic prologues of his plays into
a defence of himself. We have a <span
id="fr_5376"></span>[5377](#fn_5376.md) Luscius Lanuvinus, like the one who
worried him, and who brought charges against the poet as if he had been
a plunderer of the treasury. The bard of Mantua suffered in the same
way; he had translated a few verses of Homer very exactly, and they said
that he was nothing but a plagiarist from the ancients. But he answered
them that it was no small proof of strength to wrest the club of
Hercules from his hands. Why, even Tully, who stands on the pinnacle of
Roman eloquence, that king of orators and glory of the Latin tongue, has
actions for embezzlement <span id="fr_5377"></span>[5378](#fn_5377.md)
brought against him by the Greeks. I cannot, therefore, be surprised if
a poor little fellow like me is exposed to the gruntings of vile swine
who trample our pearls under their feet, when some of the most learned
of men, men whose glory ought to have hushed the voice of ill will, have
felt the flames of envy. It is true, this happened by a kind of justice
to men whose eloquence had filled with its resonance the theatres and
the senate, the public assembly and the rostra; hardihood always courts
detraction, and (as Horace says):

<span id="vii.ii.v-p6"></span>“The <span
id="fr_5378"></span>[5379](#fn_5378.md) highest peaks invoke

<span id="vii.ii.v-p8"></span>The lightning’s stroke.”

<span id="vii.ii.v-p9"></span>But I am in a corner, remote from the city
and the forum, and the wranglings of crowded courts; yet, even so (as
Quintilian says) ill-will has sought me out. Therefore, I beseech the
reader,

<span id="vii.ii.v-p10"></span>“If <span
id="fr_5379"></span>[5380](#fn_5379.md) one there be, if one,

<span id="vii.ii.v-p12"></span>Who, rapt by strong desire, these lines
shall read,”

<span id="vii.ii.v-p13"></span>not to expect eloquence or oratorical
grace in those Books of Hebrew Questions, which I propose to write on
all the sacred books; but rather, that he should himself answer my
detractors for me, and tell them that a work of a new kind can claim
some indulgence. I am poor and of low estate; I neither possess riches
nor do I think it right to accept them if they are offered me; and,
similarly, let me tell them that it is impossible for them to have the
riches of Christ, that is, the knowledge of the Scriptures, and the
world’s riches as well. It will be my simple aim, therefore, first, to
point out the mistakes of those who suspect some fault in the Hebrew
Scriptures, and, secondly, to correct the faults, which evidently teem
in the Greek and Latin copies, by a reference to the original authority;
and, further, to explain the etymology of things, names, and countries,
when it is not apparent from the sound of the Latin words, by giving a
paraphrase in the vulgar tongue. To enable the student more easily to
take note of these emendations, I propose, in the first place, to set
out the true <span id="fr_5380"></span>[5381](#fn_5380.md) reading itself,
as I am now able to do, and then, by bringing the later readings into
comparison with it, to <span id="fr_5381"></span>[5382](#fn_5381.md)
indicate what has been omitted or added or altered. It is not my
purpose, as snarling ill-will pretends, to convict the LXX. of error,
nor do I look upon my own labour as a disparagement of theirs. The fact
is that they, since their work was undertaken for King Ptolemy of
Alexandria, did not choose to bring to light all the mysteries which the
sacred writings contain, and especially those which give the promise of
the advent of Christ, for fear that he who held the Jews in esteem
because they were believed to worship one God, would come to think that
they worshipped a second. But we find that the Evangelists, and even our
Lord and Saviour, and the Apostle Paul, also, bring forward many
citations as coming from the Old Testament which are not contained in
our copies; and on these I shall dilate more fully in their proper <span
id="page_487">p. 487</span> <span id="vii.ii.v-Page_487"></span>places.
But it is clear from this fact that those are the best <span
class="c17"><span id="vii.ii.v-p15.1"></span>mss.</span> which most
correspond with the authoritative words of the New Testament. Add to
this that Josephus, who gives the story of the Seventy Translators,
reports them as translating only the five books of Moses; and we also
acknowledge that these are more in harmony with the Hebrew than the
rest. And, further, those who afterward came into the field as
translators—I mean Aquila and Symmachus and Theodotion—give a version
very different from that which we use. <span
id="fr_5382"></span>[5383](#fn_5382.md)

<span id="vii.ii.v-p17"></span>I have but one word more to say, and it
may calm my detractors. Foreign goods are to be imported only to the
regions where there is a demand for them. Country people are not obliged
to buy balsam, pepper, and dates. As to Origen, I say nothing. His name
(if I may compare small things with great) is even more than my own the
object of ill-will, because, though following the common version in his
Homilies, which were spoken to common people, yet, in his Tomes, <span
id="fr_5383"></span>[5384](#fn_5383.md) that is, in his fuller discussion
of Scripture, he yields to the Hebrew as the truth, and, though
surrounded by his own forces, occasionally seeks the foreign tongue as
his ally. I will only say this about him: that I should gladly have his
knowledge of the Scriptures, even if accompanied with all the ill-will
which clings to his name, and that I do not care a straw for these
shades and spectral ghosts, whose nature is said to be to chatter in
dark corners and be a terror to babies.

correcting the LXX, and other Greek versions by the Hebrew. He was not
aware (as has been since made clear) that there are various readings in
the Hebrew itself, and that these may sometimes be corrected by the
LXX., which was made from older <span class="c17"><span
