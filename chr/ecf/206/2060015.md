<span id="v.IV-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.IV-p1.1"></span>Letter IV. To Florentius.</span>

<span id="v.IV-p2"></span>Sent to Florentius along with the preceding
letter, which Jerome requests him to deliver to Rufinus. This Florentius
was a rich Italian who had retired to Jerusalem to pursue the monastic
life. Jerome subsequently speaks of him as “a distinguished monk so
pitiful to the needy that he was generally known as the father of the
poor.” (Chron. ad <span class="c17"><span
id="v.IV-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 381.)

<span id="v.IV-p3"></span>1. How much your name and sanctity are on the
lips of the most different peoples you may gather from the fact that I
commence to love you before I know you. For as, according to the
apostle, “Some men’s sins are evident going before unto judgment,” <span
id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64) so contrariwise the report of your
charity is so widespread that it is considered not so much praiseworthy
to love you as criminal to refuse to do so. I pass over the countless
instances in which you have supported Christ, <span
id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65) fed, clothed, and visited Him. The aid
you rendered to our brother Heliodorus <span
id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66) in his need may well loose the utterance
of the dumb. With what gratitude, with what commendation, does he speak
of the kindness with which you smoothed a pilgrim’s path. I am, it is
true, the most sluggish of men, consumed by an unendurable sickness; yet
keen affection and desire have winged my feet, and I have come forward
to salute and embrace you. I wish you every good thing, and pray that
the Lord may establish our nascent friendship.

<span id="v.IV-p7"></span>2. Our brother, Rufinus, is said to have come
from Egypt to Jerusalem with the de<span id="page_7">p. 7</span> <span
id="v.IV-Page_7"></span>vout lady, Melanium. He is inseparably bound to
me in brotherly love; and I beg you to oblige me by delivering to him
the annexed letter. You must not, however, judge of me by the virtues
that you find in him. For in him you will see the clearest tokens of
holiness, whilst I am but dust and vile dirt, and even now, while still
living, nothing but ashes. It is enough for me if my weak eyes can bear
the brightness of his excellence. He has but now washed himself <span
id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67) and is clean, yea, is made white as
snow; <span id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68) whilst I, stained with every
sin, wait day and night with trembling to pay the uttermost
farthing. <span id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69) But since “the Lord
looseth the prisoners,” <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70) and resteth
upon him who is of a contrite spirit, and that trembleth at His
words, <span id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71) perchance he may say even to
me who lie in the grave of sin: “Jerome, come forth.” <span
id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72)

<span id="v.IV-p14"></span>The reverend presbyter, Evagrius, warmly
salutes you. We both with united respect salute the brother,
Martinianus. <span id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73) I desire much to see
him, but I am impeded by the chain of sickness. Farewell in Christ.
