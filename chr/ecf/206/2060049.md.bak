<span id="v.XXXVIII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XXXVIII-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXVIII. To Marcella.</span>

<span id="v.XXXVIII-p2"></span>Blæsilla, the daughter of Paula and
sister of Eustochium, had lost her husband seven months after her
marriage. A dangerous illness had then led to her conversion, and she
was now famous throughout Rome for the length to which she carried her
austerities. Many censured her for what they deemed her fanaticism, and
Jerome, as her spiritual adviser, came in for some of the blame. In the
present letter he defends her conduct, and declares that persons who
cavil at lives like hers have no claim to be considered Christians.
Written at Rome in 385 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XXXVIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.XXXVIII-p3"></span>1. When Abraham is tempted to slay his
son the trial only serves to strengthen his faith. <span
id="fr_757"></span>[758](#fn_757.md) When Joseph is sold into Egypt, his
sojourn there enables him to support his father and his brothers. <span
id="fr_758"></span>[759](#fn_758.md) When Hezekiah is panic-stricken at the
near approach of death, his tears and prayers obtain for him a respite
of fifteen years. <span id="fr_759"></span>[760](#fn_759.md) If the faith
of the apostle, Peter, is shaken by his Lord’s passion, it is that,
weeping bitterly, he may hear the soothing words: “Feed my sheep.” <span
id="fr_760"></span>[761](#fn_760.md) If Paul, that ravening wolf, <span
id="fr_761"></span>[762](#fn_761.md) that little Benjamin, <span
id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762.md) is blinded in a trance, it is that he
may receive his sight, and may be led, by the sudden horror of
surrounding darkness, to call Him Lord Whom before he persecuted as
man. <span id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763.md)

<span id="v.XXXVIII-p11"></span>2. So is it now, my dear Marcella, with
our beloved Blæsilla. The burning fever from which we have seen her
suffering unceasingly for nearly thirty days has been <span
id="page_48">p. 48</span> <span id="v.XXXVIII-Page_48"></span>sent to
teach her to renounce her over-great attention to that body which the
worms must shortly devour. The Lord Jesus has come to her in her
sickness, and has taken her by the hand, and behold, she arises and
ministers unto Him. <span id="fr_764"></span>[765](#fn_764.md) Formerly her
life savored somewhat of carelessness; and, fast bound in the bands of
wealth, she lay as one dead in the tomb of the world. But Jesus was
moved with indignation, <span id="fr_765"></span>[766](#fn_765.md) and was
troubled in spirit, and cried aloud and said, Blæsilla, come
forth. <span id="fr_766"></span>[767](#fn_766.md) She, at His call, has
arisen and has come forth, and sits at meat with the Lord. <span
id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767.md) The Jews, if they will, may threaten
her in their wrath; they may seek to slay her, because Christ has raised
her up. <span id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768.md) It is enough that the
apostles give God the glory. Blæsilla knows that her life is due to Him
who has given it back to her. She knows that now she can clasp the feet
of Him whom but a little while ago she dreaded as her judge. <span
id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769.md) Then life had all but forsaken her
body, and the approach of death made her gasp and shiver. What succour
did she obtain in that hour from her kinsfolk? What comfort was there in
their words lighter than smoke? She owes no debt to you, ye unkindly
kindred, now that she is dead to the world and alive unto Christ. <span
id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770.md) The Christian must rejoice that it is
so, and he that is vexed must admit that he has no claim to be called a
Christian.

<span id="v.XXXVIII-p19"></span>3. A widow who is “loosed from the law
of her husband” <span id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771.md) has, for her one
duty, to continue a widow. But, you will say, a sombre dress vexes the
world. In that case, John the Baptist would vex it, too; and yet, among
those that are born of women, there has not been a greater than
he. <span id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772.md) He was called an
angel; <span id="fr_773"></span>[774](#fn_773.md) he baptized the Lord
Himself, and yet he was clothed in raiment of camel’s hair, and girded
with a leathern girdle. <span id="fr_774"></span>[775](#fn_774.md) Is the
world displeased because a widow’s food is coarse? Nothing can be
coarser than locusts, and yet these were the food of John. The women who
ought to scandalize Christians are those who paint their eyes and lips
with rouge and cosmetics; whose chalked faces, unnaturally white, are
like those of idols; upon whose cheeks every chance tear leaves a
furrow; who fail to realize that years make them old; who heap their
heads with hair not their own; who smooth their faces, and rub out the
wrinkles of age; and who, in the presence of their grandsons, behave
like trembling school-girls. A Christian woman should blush to do
violence to nature, or to stimulate desire by bestowing care upon the
flesh. “They that are in the flesh,” the apostle tells us, “cannot
please God.” <span id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775.md)

<span id="v.XXXVIII-p25"></span>4. In days gone by our dear widow was
extremely fastidious in her dress, and spent whole days before her
mirror to correct its deficiencies. Now she boldly says: “We all with
unveiled face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are
changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the spirit
of the Lord.” <span id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776.md) In those days
maids arranged her hair, and her head, which had done no harm, was
forced into a waving head-dress. Now she leaves her hair alone, and her
only head-dress is a veil. In those days the softest feather-bed seemed
hard to her, and she could scarcely find rest on a pile of mattresses.
Now she rises eager for prayer, her shrill voice cries Alleluia before
every other, she is the first to praise her Lord. She kneels upon the
bare ground, and with frequent tears cleanses a face once defiled with
white lead. After prayer comes the singing of psalms, and it is only
when her neck aches and her knees totter, and her eyes begin to close
with weariness, that she gives them leave reluctantly to rest. As her
dress is dark, lying on the ground does not soil it. Cheap shoes permit
her to give to the poor the price of gilded ones. No gold and jewels
adorn her girdle; it is made of wool, plain and scrupulously clean. It
is intended to keep her clothes right, and not to cut her waist in two.
Therefore, if the scorpion looks askance upon her purpose, and with
alluring words tempts her once more to eat of the forbidden tree, she
must crush him beneath her feet with a curse, and say, as he lies dying
in his allotted dust: <span id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777.md) “Get thee
behind me, Satan.” <span id="fr_778"></span>[779](#fn_778.md) Satan means
adversary, <span id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779.md) and one who dislikes
Christ’s commandments, is more than Christ’s adversary; he is
anti-christ.

<span id="v.XXXVIII-p30"></span>5. But what, I ask you, have we ever
done that men should be offended at us? Have we ever imitated the
apostles? We are told of the first disciples that they forsook their
boat and their nets, and even their aged father. <span
id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780.md) The publican stood up from the receipt
of custom and followed the Saviour once for all. <span
id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781.md) And when a disciple <span
id="page_49">p. 49</span> <span id="v.XXXVIII-Page_49"></span>wished to
return home, that he might take leave of his kinsfolk, the Master’s
voice refused consent. <span id="fr_782"></span>[783](#fn_782.md) A son was
even forbidden to bury his father, <span
id="fr_783"></span>[784](#fn_783.md) as if to show that it is sometimes a
religious duty to be undutiful for the Lord’s sake. <span
id="fr_784"></span>[785](#fn_784.md) With us it is different. We are held
to be monks if we refuse to dress in silk. We are called sour and severe
if we keep sober and refrain from excessive laughter. The mob salutes us
as Greeks and impostors <span id="fr_785"></span>[786](#fn_785.md) if our
tunics are fresh and clean. They may deal in still severer witticisms if
they please; they may parade every fat paunch <span
id="fr_786"></span>[787](#fn_786.md) they can lay hold of, to turn us into
ridicule. Our Blæsilla will laugh at their efforts, and will bear with
patience the taunts of all such croaking frogs, for she will remember
that men called her Lord, Beelzebub. <span
