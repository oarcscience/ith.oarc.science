<span id="v.IX-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.IX-p1.1"></span>Letter IX. To Chrysogonus, a Monk of
Aquileia.</span>

<span id="v.IX-p2"></span>A bantering letter to an indifferent
correspondent. Of the same date as the preceding.

<span id="v.IX-p3"></span>Heliodorus, <span
id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md) who is so dear to us both, and who
loves you with an affection no less <span id="page_11">p. 11</span>
<span id="v.IX-Page_11"></span>deep than my own, may have given you a
faithful account of my feelings towards you; how your name is always on
my lips, and how in every conversation which I have with him I begin by
recalling my pleasant intercourse with you, and go on to marvel at your
lowliness, to extol your virtue, and to proclaim your holy love.

<span id="v.IX-p5"></span>Lynxes, they say, when they look behind them,
forget what they have just seen, and lose all thought of what their eyes
have ceased to behold. And so it seems to be with you. For so entirely
have you forgotten our joint attachment that you have not merely blurred
but erased the writing of that epistle which, as the apostle tells
us, <span id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) is written in the hearts of
Christians. The creatures that I have mentioned lurk on branches of
leafy trees and pounce on fleet roes or frightened stags. In vain their
victims fly, for they carry their tormentors with them, and these rend
their flesh as they run. Lynxes, however, only hunt when an empty belly
makes their mouths dry. When they have satisfied their thirst for blood,
and have filled their stomachs with food, satiety induces forgetfulness,
and they bestow no thought on future prey till hunger recalls them to a
sense of their need.

<span id="v.IX-p7"></span>Now in your case it cannot be that you have
already had enough of me. Why then do you bring to a premature close a
friendship which is but just begun? Why do you let slip what you have
hardly as yet fully grasped? But as such remissness as yours is never at
a loss for an excuse, you will perhaps declare that you had nothing to
write. Had this been so, you should still have written to inform me of
the fact.
