<p> <a name="v.VI"></A>
<p class="c32"><a name="v.VI-p1"></A>  <span class="c1"><a name="v.VI-p1.1"></A>Letter VI. To Julian, a Deacon of Antioch.</span></p>  
<p class="c16"><a name="v.VI-p2"></A>This letter, written in 374 <span class="c17"><a name="v.VI-p2.1"></A>a.d.</span>, is chiefly interesting for its mention of Jerome&#146;s sister. It would seem that she had fallen into sin and had been restored to a life of virtue by the deacon, Julian. Jerome speaks of her again in the next letter (&sect;4).</p>  
<p class="c31"><a name="v.VI-p3"></A>It is an old saying, &#8220;Liars are disbelieved even when they speak the truth.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">85</FONT></A>
 And from the way in which you reproach me for not having written, I perceive that this has been my lot with you. Shall I say, &#8220;I wrote often, but the bearers of my letters were negligent&#8221;? You will reply, &#8220;Your excuse is the old one of all who fail to write.&#8221; Shall I say, &#8220;I could not find any one to take my letters&#8221;? You will say that numbers of persons have gone from my part of the world to yours. Shall I contend that I have actually given them letters? They not having delivered them, will deny that they have received them. Moreover, so great a distance separates us that it will be hard to come at the truth. What shall I do then? Though really not to blame, I ask your forgiveness, for I think it better to fall back and make overtures for peace than to keep my ground and offer battle. The truth is that constant sickness of body and vexation of mind have so weakened me that with death so close at hand I have not been as collected as usual. And lest you should account this plea a false one, now that I have stated my case, I shall, like a pleader, call witnesses to prove it. Our reverend brother, Heliodorus, has been here; but in spite of his wish to dwell in the desert with me, he has been frightened away by my crimes. But my present wordiness will atone for my past remissness; for, as Horace says in his satire:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_85"></A><A HREF="#fn_85"><FONT SIZE="1">86</FONT></A>

<p class="c33"><a name="v.VI-p6"></A>All singers have one fault among their friends:</p>  
<p class="c34"><a name="v.VI-p7"></A>They never sing when asked, unasked they never cease.</p>  
<p><a name="v.VI-p8"></A>Henceforth I shall overwhelm you with such bundles of letters that you will take the opposite line and beg me not to write.</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="v.VI-p9"></A>I rejoice that my sister&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">87</FONT></A>
&#8212;to you a daughter in Christ&#8212;remains steadfast in her purpose, a piece of news which I owe in the first instance to you. For here where I now am I am ignorant not only as to what goes on in my native land, but even as to its continued existence. Even though the Iberian viper&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">88</FONT></A>
 shall rend me with his baneful fangs, I will not fear men&#146;s judgment, seeing that I shall have God to judge me. As one puts it:</p>  
<p class="c33"><a name="v.VI-p12"></A>Shatter the world to fragments if you will:</p>  
<p class="c34"><a name="v.VI-p13"></A>&#146;Twill fall upon a head which knows not fear.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">89</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="v.VI-p15"></A>Bear in mind, then, I pray you, the apostle&#146;s precept&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_89"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">90</FONT></A>
 that we should make our work abiding; prepare for yourself a reward from the Lord in my sister&#146;s salvation; and by frequent letters increase my joy in that glory in Christ which we share together.</p>
