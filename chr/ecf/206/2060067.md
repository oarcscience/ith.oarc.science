id="v.LVI-p1.1"></span>Letter LVI. From Augustine.</span>

<span id="v.LVI-p2"></span>Augustine’s first letter to Jerome (printed
in his correspondence in this Library as Letter XXVIII.): through a
series of accidents it was not delivered until nine years after it had
been written. In it Augustine comments on Jerome’s new Latin version of
the O.T. and advises him in his future labours to adhere more closely to
the text of the LXX. He also discusses Jerome’s account (in his
commentary on the epistle to the Galatians) of the quarrel between Paul
and Peter at Antioch. This according to Jerome was not a real
misunderstanding but only one artificially ‘got up’ to put clearly
before the Church the mischief of Christians conforming to the now
obsolete Mosaic Law. Augustine strongly controverts this view and
maintains that it is fatal to the veracity and authority claimed for
scripture. Written from Hippo about the year 394 <span class="c17"><span
