<span id="v.CXXXVI-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.CXXXVI-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXXVI. From Pope Innocent to
Jerome.</span>

<span id="v.CXXXVI-p2"></span>Innocent expresses his sympathy with
Jerome and promises to take strong measures to punish his opponents if
he will bring specific charges against them. The date of the letter is
<span class="c17"><span id="v.CXXXVI-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 417.

<span id="v.CXXXVI-p3"></span>Innocent to his most esteemed son, the
presbyter Jerome.

<span id="v.CXXXVI-p4"></span>The apostle <span
id="fr_3884"></span>[3885](#fn_3884) bears witness that contention has
never done good in the church; and for this reason he gives direction
that heretics should be admonished once or twice in the beginning of
their heresy and not subjected to a long series of rebukes. Where this
rule is negligently observed, the evil to be guarded against so far from
being evaded is rather intensified.

<span id="v.CXXXVI-p6"></span>Your grief and lamentation have so
affected us that we can neither act nor advise.

<span id="v.CXXXVI-p7"></span>To begin however, we commend you for the
constancy of your faith. To quote your own words spoken many times in
the ears of many, a man will gladly face misrepresentation or even
personal danger on behalf of the truth; if he is looking for the
blessedness that is to come. We remind you of what you have yourself
preached although we are sure that you need no reminder. The spectacle
of these terrible evils has so thoroughly roused us that we have
hastened to put forth the authority of the apostolic see to repress the
plague in all its manifestations; but as your letters name no
individuals and bring no specific charges, there is no one at present
against whom we can proceed. But we do <span id="page_281">p. 281</span>
<span id="v.CXXXVI-Page_281"></span>all that we can; we sympathize
deeply with you. And if you will lay a clear and unambiguous accusation
against any persons in particular we will appoint suitable judges to try
their cases; or if you, our highly esteemed son, think that it is
needful for us to take yet graver and more urgent action, we shall not
be slow to do so. Meantime we have written to our brother bishop
John <span id="fr_3885"></span>[3886](#fn_3885) advising him to act more
considerately, so that nothing may occur in the church committed to him
which it is his duty to foresee and to prevent, and that nothing may
happen which may subsequently prove a source of trouble to him.
