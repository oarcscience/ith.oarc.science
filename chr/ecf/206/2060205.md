<span id="vii.iii.xvi-p2"></span>*This book was dedicated to <span
id="fr_5414"></span>[5415](#fn_5414) Domnion and Rogatianus, about <span
class="c17"><span id="vii.iii.xvi-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 388. Jerome
points out the advantages he enjoyed, in living in Palestine, for
obtaining correct information on matters illustrative of Scripture,
especially the names of places. The <span class="c17"><span
id="vii.iii.xvi-p3.2"></span>mss.</span> of the LXX. on such points were
so corrupt that occasionally three names were run into one, and “you
would think that you had before you, not a heap of Hebrew names, but
those of some foreign and Sarmatian tribe.” Jerome had sent for a Jew,
highly esteemed among his brethren, from Tiberias, and, after “examining
him from top to toe,” had, by his aid, emended the text and made the
translation. But he had not the critical knowledge to guard him against
supposing that the Books of Chronicles are “the Book of the Chronicles
of the Kings of Judah,” referred to in the Books of Kings.*
