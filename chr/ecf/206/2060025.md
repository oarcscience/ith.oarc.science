<span id="v.XIV-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XIV-p1.1"></span>Letter XIV. To Heliodorus, Monk.</span>

<span id="v.XIV-p2"></span>Heliodorus, originally a soldier, but now a
presbyter of the Church, had accompanied Jerome to the East, but, not
feeling called to the solitary life of the desert, had returned to
Aquileia. Here he resumed his clerical duties, and in course of time was
raised to the episcopate as bishop of Altinum.

<span id="v.XIV-p3"></span>The letter was written in the first
bitterness of separation and reproaches Heliodorus for having gone back
from the perfect way of the ascetic life. The description given of this
is highly colored and seems to have produced a great impression in the
West. Fabiola was so much enchanted by it that she learned the letter by
heart. <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) The date is 373 or 374
<span class="c17"><span id="v.XIV-p4.2"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.XIV-p5"></span>1. So conscious are you of the affection
which exists between us that you cannot but <span id="page_14">p.
14</span> <span id="v.XIV-Page_14"></span>recognize the love and passion
with which I strove to prolong our common sojourn in the desert. This
very letter—blotted, as you see, with tears—gives evidence of the
lamentation and weeping with which I accompanied your departure. With
the pretty ways of a child you then softened your refusal by soothing
words, and I, being off my guard, knew not what to do. Was I to hold my
peace? I could not conceal my eagerness by a show of indifference. Or
was I to entreat you yet more earnestly? You would have refused to
listen, for your love was not like mine. Despised affection has taken
the one course open to it. Unable to keep you when present, it goes in
search of you when absent. You asked me yourself, when you were going
away, to invite you to the desert when I took up my quarters there, and
I for my part promised to do so. Accordingly I invite you now; come, and
come quickly. Do not call to mind old ties; the desert is for those who
have left all. Nor let the hardships of our former travels deter you.
You believe in Christ, believe also in His words: “Seek ye first the
kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you.” <span
id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) Take neither scrip nor staff. He is
rich enough who is poor—with Christ.

<span id="v.XIV-p7"></span>2. But what is this, and why do I foolishly
importune you again? Away with entreaties, an end to coaxing words.
Offended love does well to be angry. You have spurned my petition;
perhaps you will listen to my remonstrance. What keeps you, effeminate
soldier, in your father’s house? Where are your ramparts and trenches?
When have you spent a winter in the field? Lo, the trumpet sounds from
heaven! Lo, the Leader comes with clouds! <span
id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) He is armed to subdue the world, and
out of His mouth proceeds a two-edged sword <span
id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) to mow down all that encounters it.
But as for you, what will you do? Pass straight from your chamber to the
battle-field, and from the cool shade into the burning sun? Nay, a body
used to a tunic cannot endure a buckler; a head that has worn a cap
refuses a helmet; a hand made tender by disuse is galled by a
sword-hilt. <span id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) Hear the
proclamation of your King: “He that is not with me is against me, and he
that gathereth not with me scattereth.” <span
id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md) Remember the day on which you
enlisted, when, buried with Christ in baptism, you swore fealty to Him,
declaring that for His sake you would spare neither father nor mother.
Lo, the enemy is striving to slay Christ in your breast. Lo, the ranks
of the foe sigh over that bounty which you received when you entered His
service. Should your little nephew <span
id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) hang on your neck, pay no regard to
him; should your mother with ashes on her hair and garments rent show
you the breasts at which she nursed you, heed her not; should your
father prostrate himself on the threshold, trample him under foot and go
your way. With dry eyes fly to the standard of the cross. In such cases
cruelty is the only true affection.

<span id="v.XIV-p13"></span>3. Hereafter there shall come—yes, there
shall come—a day when you will return a victor to your true country, and
will walk through the heavenly Jerusalem crowned with the crown of
valor. Then will you receive the citizenship thereof with Paul. <span
id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) Then will you seek the like privilege
for your parents. Then will you intercede for me who have urged you
forward on the path of victory.

<span id="v.XIV-p15"></span>I am not ignorant of the fetters which you
may plead as hindrances. My breast is not of iron nor my heart of stone.
I was not born of flint or suckled by a tigress. <span
id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) I have passed through troubles like
yours myself. Now it is a widowed sister who throws her caressing arms
around you. Now it is the slaves, your foster-brothers, who cry, “To
what master are you leaving us?” Now it is a nurse bowed with age, and a
body-servant loved only less than a father, who exclaim: “Only wait till
we die and follow us to our graves.” Perhaps, too, an aged mother, with
sunken bosom and furrowed brow, recalling the lullaby <span
id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) with which she once soothed you, adds
her entreaties to theirs. The learned may call you, if they please,

<span id="v.XIV-p18"></span>The sole support and pillar of your
house. <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md)

<span id="v.XIV-p20"></span>The love of God and the fear of hell will
easily break such bonds.

<span id="v.XIV-p21"></span>Scripture, you will argue, bids us obey our
parents. <span id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) Yes, but whoso loves
them more than Christ loses his own soul. <span
id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md) The enemy takes sword in hand to slay
me, and shall I think of a mother’s tears? Or shall I desert the service
of Christ for the sake of a father to whom, if I am Christ’s servant, I
owe no rites of burial, <span id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) albeit
if I am Christ’s true servant I owe these to all? Peter with his
cowardly advice was an offence to the Lord on the eve of His
passion; <span id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) and to the breth<span
id="page_15">p. 15</span> <span id="v.XIV-Page_15"></span>ren who strove
to restrain him from going up to Jerusalem, Paul’s one answer was: “What
mean ye to weep and to break my heart? For I am ready not to be bound
only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord
Jesus.” <span id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) The battering-ram of
natural affection which so often shatters faith must recoil powerless
from the wall of the Gospel. “My mother and my brethren are these
whosoever do the will of my Father which is in heaven.” <span
id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) If they believe in Christ let them bid
me God-speed, for I go to fight in His name. And if they do not believe,
“let the dead bury their dead.” <span id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md)

<span id="v.XIV-p29"></span>4. But all this, you argue, only touches the
case of martyrs. Ah! my brother, you are mistaken, you are mistaken, if
you suppose that there is ever a time when the Christian does not suffer
persecution. Then are you most hardly beset when you know not that you
are beset at all. “Our adversary as a roaring lion walketh about seeking
whom he may devour,” <span id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) and do you
think of peace? “He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages: in
the secret places doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are privily set
against the poor. He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den; he
lieth in wait to catch the poor;” <span
id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md) and do you slumber under a shady tree,
so as to fall an easy prey? On one side self-indulgence presses me hard;
on another covetousness strives to make an inroad; my belly wishes to be
a God to me, in place of Christ, <span id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md)
and lust would fain drive away the Holy Spirit that dwells in me and
defile His temple. <span id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) I am pursued,
I say, by an enemy

<span id="v.XIV-p34"></span>Whose name is Legion and his wiles
untold; <span id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md)

<span id="v.XIV-p36"></span>and, hapless wretch that I am, how shall I
hold myself a victor when I am being led away a captive?

<span id="v.XIV-p37"></span>5. My dear brother, weigh well the various
forms of transgression, and think not that the sins which I have
mentioned are less flagrant than that of idolatry. Nay, hear the
apostle’s view of the matter. “For this ye know,” he writes, “that no
whore-monger or unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater,
hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.” <span
id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) In a general way all that is of the
devil savors of enmity to God, and what is of the devil is idolatry,
since all idols are subject to him. Yet Paul elsewhere lays down the law
in express and unmistakable terms, saying: “Mortify your members, which
are upon the earth, laying aside fornication, uncleanness, evil
concupiscence and covetousness, which are <span
id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) idolatry, for which things’ sake the
wrath of God cometh.” <span id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md)

<span id="v.XIV-p41"></span>Idolatry is not confined to casting incense
upon an altar with finger and thumb, or to pouring libations of wine out
of a cup into a bowl. Covetousness is idolatry, or else the selling of
the Lord for thirty pieces of silver was a righteous act. <span
id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md) Lust involves profanation, or else men
may defile with common harlots <span id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md)
those members of Christ which should be “a living sacrifice acceptable
to God.” <span id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) Fraud is idolatry, or
else they are worthy of imitation who, in the Acts of the Apostles, sold
their inheritance, and because they kept back part of the price,
perished by an instant doom. <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md)
Consider well, my brother; nothing is yours to keep. “Whosoever he be of
you,” the Lord says, “that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be
my disciple.” <span id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md) Why are you such a
half-hearted Christian?

<span id="v.XIV-p47"></span>6. See how Peter left his net; <span
id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) see how the publican rose from the
receipt of custom. <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md) In a moment
he became an apostle. “The Son of man hath not where to lay his
head,” <span id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) and do you plan wide
porticos and spacious halls? If you look to inherit the good things of
the world you can no longer be a joint-heir with Christ. <span
id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) You are called a monk, and has the
name no meaning? What brings you, a solitary, into the throng of men?
The advice that I give is that of no inexperienced mariner who has never
lost either ship or cargo, and has never known a gale. Lately
shipwrecked as I have been myself, my warnings to other voyagers spring
from my own fears. On one side, like Charybdis, self-indulgence sucks
into its vortex the soul’s salvation. On the other, like Scylla, lust,
with a smile on her girl’s face, lures it on to wreck its chastity. The
coast is savage, and the devil with a crew of pirates carries irons to
fetter his captives. Be not credulous, be not over-confident. The sea
may be as smooth and smiling as a pond, its quiet surface may be
scarcely ruffled by a breath of air, yet sometimes its waves are as high
as mountains. There is danger in its depths, the foe is lurking there.
Ease your sheets, spread <span id="page_16">p. 16</span> <span
id="v.XIV-Page_16"></span>your sails, fasten the cross as an ensign on
your prow. The calm that you speak of is itself a tempest. “Why so?” you
will perhaps argue; “are not all my fellow-townsmen Christians?” Your
case, I reply, is not that of others. Listen to the words of the Lord:
“If thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast, and give to the
poor, and come and follow me.” <span id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md)
You have already promised to be perfect. For when you forsook the army
and made yourself an eunuch for the kingdom of heaven’s sake, <span
id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) you did so that you might follow the
perfect life. Now the perfect servant of Christ has nothing beside
Christ. Or if he have anything beside Christ he is not perfect. And if
he be not perfect when he has promised God to be so, his profession is a
lie. But “the mouth that lieth slayeth the soul.” <span
id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md) To conclude, then, if you are perfect
you will not set your heart on your father’s goods; and if you are not
perfect you have deceived the Lord. The Gospel thunders forth its divine
warning: “Ye cannot serve two masters,” <span
id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md) and does any one dare to make Christ a
liar by serving at once both God and Mammon? Repeatedly does He
proclaim, “If any one will come after me let him deny himself and take
up his cross and follow me.” <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) If
I load myself with gold can I think that I am following Christ? Surely
not. “He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk even
as He walked.” <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md)

<span id="v.XIV-p58"></span>7. I know you will rejoin that you possess
nothing. Why, then, if you are so well prepared for battle, do you not
take the field? Perhaps you think that *you* can wage war in your own
country, although the Lord could do no signs in His? <span
id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) Why not? you ask. Take the answer
which comes to you with his authority: “No prophet is accepted in his
own country.” <span id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) But, you will say,
I do not seek honor; the approval of my conscience is enough for me.
Neither did the Lord seek it; for when the multitudes would have made
Him a king he fled from them. <span id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md)
But where there is no honor there is contempt; and where there is
contempt there is frequent rudeness; and where there is rudeness there
is vexation; and where there is vexation there is no rest; and where
there is no rest the mind is apt to be diverted from its purpose. Again,
where, through restlessness, earnestness loses any of its force, it is
lessened by what it loses, and that which is lessened cannot be called
perfect. The upshot of all which is that a monk cannot be perfect in his
own country. Now, not to aim at perfection is itself a sin.

<span id="v.XIV-p62"></span>8. Driven from this line of defence you will
appeal to the example of the clergy. These, you will say, remain in
their cities, and yet they are surely above criticism. Far be it from me
to censure the successors of the apostles, who with holy words
consecrate the body of Christ, and who make us Christians. <span
id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) Having the keys of the kingdom of
heaven, they judge men to some extent before the day of judgment, and
guard the chastity of the bride of Christ. But, as I have before hinted,
the case of monks is different from that of the clergy. The clergy feed
Christ’s sheep; I as a monk am fed by them. They live of the
altar: <span id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md) I, if I bring no gift to
it, have the axe laid to my root as to that of a barren tree. <span
id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) Nor can I plead poverty as an excuse,
for the Lord in the gospel has praised an aged widow for casting into
the treasury the last two coins that she had. <span
id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) I may not sit in the presence of a
presbyter; <span id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md) he, if I sin, may
deliver me to Satan, “for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit
may be saved.” <span id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222.md) Under the old law
he who disobeyed the priests was put outside the camp and stoned by the
people, or else he was beheaded and expiated his contempt with his
blood. <span id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md) But now the disobedient
person is cut down with the spiritual sword, or he is expelled from the
church and torn to pieces by ravening demons. Should the entreaties of
your brethren induce you to take orders, I shall rejoice that you are
lifted up, and fear lest you may be cast down. You will say: “If a man
desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.” <span
id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) I know that; but you should add what
follows: such an one “must be blameless, the husband of one wife,
vigilant, sober, chaste, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to
teach, not given to wine, no striker but patient.” <span
id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md) After fully explaining the
qualifications of a bishop the apostle speaks of ministers of the third
degree with equal care. “Likewise must the deacons be grave,” he writes,
“not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre,
holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. And let these
also first be proved; then, let them minister, being found
blameless.” <span id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) Woe to the man who
goes in to the supper without a wedding garment. Nothing remains for
<span id="page_17">p. 17</span> <span id="v.XIV-Page_17"></span>him but
the stern question, “Friend, how camest thou in hither?” And when he is
speechless the order will be given, “Bind him hand and foot, and take
him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.” <span id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md) Woe to him
who, when he has received a talent, has bound it in a napkin; and,
whilst others make profits, only preserves what he has received. His
angry lord shall rebuke him in a moment. “Thou wicked servant,” he will
say, “wherefore gavest thou not my money into the bank that at my coming
I might have required mine own with usury?” <span
id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md) That is to say, you should have laid
before the altar what you were not able to bear. For whilst you, a
slothful trader, keep a penny in your hands, you occupy the place of
another who might double the money. Wherefore, as he who ministers well
purchases to himself a good degree, <span
id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) so he who approaches the cup of the
Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. <span
id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md)

<span id="v.XIV-p77"></span>9. Not all bishops are bishops indeed. You
consider Peter; mark Judas as well. You notice Stephen; look also on
Nicolas, sentenced in the Apocalypse by the Lord’s own lips, <span
id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md) whose shameful imaginations gave rise
to the heresy of the Nicolaitans. “Let a man examine himself and so let
him come.” <span id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md) For it is not
ecclesiastical rank that makes a man a Christian. The centurion
Cornelius was still a heathen when he was cleansed by the gift of the
Holy Spirit. Daniel was but a child when he judged the elders. <span
id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md) Amos was stripping mulberry bushes
when, in a moment, he was made a prophet. <span
id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md) David was only a shepherd when he was
chosen to be king. <span id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md) And the least
of His disciples was the one whom Jesus loved the most. My brother, sit
down in the lower room, that when one less honorable comes you may be
bidden to go up higher. <span id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md) Upon
whom does the Lord rest but upon him that is lowly and of a contrite
spirit, and that trembleth at His word? <span
id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) To whom God has committed much, of him
He will ask the more. <span id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) “Mighty
men shall be mightily tormented.” <span
id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) No man need pride himself in the day
of judgment on merely physical chastity, for then shall men give account
for every idle word, <span id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md) and the
reviling of a brother shall be counted as the sin of murder. <span
id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md) Paul and Peter now reign with Christ,
and it is not easy to take the place of the one or to hold the office of
the other. There may come an angel to rend the veil of your
temple, <span id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md) and to remove your
candlestick out of its place. <span id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) If
you intend to build the tower, first count the cost. <span
id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) Salt that has lost its savor is good
for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of
swine. <span id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) If a monk fall, a priest
shall intercede for him; but who shall intercede for a fallen priest?

<span id="v.XIV-p93"></span>10. At last my discourse is clear of the
reefs: at last this frail bark has passed from the breakers into deep
water. I may now spread my sails to the breeze; and, as I leave the
rocks of controversy astern, my epilogue will be like the joyful shout
of mariners. O desert, bright with the flowers of Christ! O solitude
whence come the stones of which, in the Apocalypse, the city of the
great king is built! <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md) O
wilderness, gladdened with God’s especial presence! What keeps you in
the world, my brother, you who are above the world? <span
id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md) How long shall gloomy roofs oppress
you? How long shall smoky cities immure you? Believe me, I have more
light than you. Sweet it is to lay aside the weight of the body and to
soar into the pure bright ether. Do you dread poverty? Christ calls the
poor blessed. <span id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md) Does toil frighten
you? No athlete is crowned but in the sweat of his brow. Are you anxious
as regards food? Faith fears no famine. Do you dread the bare ground for
limbs wasted with fasting? The Lord lies there beside you. Do you recoil
from an unwashed head and uncombed hair? Christ is your true head. <span
id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md) Does the boundless solitude of the
desert terrify you? In the spirit you may walk always in paradise. Do
but turn your thoughts thither and you will be no more in the desert. Is
your skin rough and scaly because you no longer bathe? He that is once
washed in Christ needeth not to wash again. <span
id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) To all your objections the apostle
gives this one brief answer: “The sufferings of this present time are
not worthy to be compared with the glory” which shall come after them,
“which shall be revealed in us.” <span id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md)
You are too greedy of enjoyment, my brother, if you wish to rejoice with
the world here, and to reign with Christ hereafter.

<span id="v.XIV-p100"></span>11. It shall come, it shall come, that day
when this corruptible shall put on incorrup<span id="page_18">p.
18</span> <span id="v.XIV-Page_18"></span>tion, and this mortal shall
put on immortality. <span id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md) Then shall
that servant be blessed whom the Lord shall find watching. <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) Then at the sound of the trumpet <span
id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) the earth and its peoples shall
tremble, but you shall rejoice. The world shall howl at the Lord who
comes to judge it, and the tribes of the earth shall smite the breast.
Once mighty kings shall tremble in their nakedness. Venus shall be
exposed, and her son too. Jupiter with his fiery bolts will be brought
to trial; and Plato, with his disciples, will be but a fool. Aristotle’s
arguments shall be of no avail. You may seem a poor man and country
bred, but then you shall exult and laugh, and say: Behold my crucified
Lord, behold my judge. This is He who was once an infant wrapped in
swaddling clothes and crying in a manger. <span
id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) This is He whose parents were a
workingman and a working-woman. <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md)
This is He, who, carried into Egypt in His mother’s bosom, though He was
God, fled before the face of man. This is He who was clothed in a
scarlet robe and crowned with thorns. <span
id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) This is He who was called a sorcerer
and a man with a devil and a Samaritan. <span
id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) Jew, behold the hands which you nailed
to the cross. Roman, behold the side which you pierced with the spear.
See both of you whether it was this body that the disciples stole
