<span id="v.XXXI"></span>

<span id="v.XXXI-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XXXI-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXI. To Eustochium.</span>

<span id="v.XXXI-p2"></span>Jerome writes to thank Eustochium for some
presents sent to him by her on the festival of St. Peter. He also
moralizes on the mystical meaning of the articles sent. The letter
should be compared with Letter XLIV., of which the theme is similar.
Written at Rome in 384 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XXXI-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> (on St. Peter’s Day).

<span id="v.XXXI-p3"></span>1. Doves, bracelets, and a letter are
outwardly but small gifts to receive from a virgin, but the action which
has prompted them enhances their value. And since honey may not be
offered in sacrifice to God, <span id="fr_727"></span>[728](#fn_727) you
have shown skill in taking off their overmuch sweetness and making them
pungent—if I may so say—with a dash of pepper. For nothing that is
simply pleasurable or merely sweet can please God. Everything must have
in it a sharp seasoning of truth. Christ’s passover must be eaten with
bitter herbs. <span id="fr_728"></span>[729](#fn_728)

<span id="v.XXXI-p6"></span>2. It is true that a festival such as the
birthday <span id="fr_729"></span>[730](#fn_729) of Saint Peter should
be seasoned with more gladness than usual; still our merriment must not
forget the limit set by Scripture, and we must not stray too far from
the boundary of our wrestling-ground. Your presents, indeed, remind me
of the sacred volume, for in it Ezekiel decks Jerusalem with
bracelets, <span id="fr_730"></span>[731](#fn_730) Baruch receives
letters from Jeremiah, <span id="fr_731"></span>[732](#fn_731) and the
Holy Spirit descends in the form of a dove at the baptism of
Christ. <span id="fr_732"></span>[733](#fn_732) But to give you, too, a
sprinkling of pepper and to remind you of my former letter, <span
id="fr_733"></span>[734](#fn_733) I send you to-day this three-fold
warning. Cease not to adorn yourself with good works—the true bracelets
of a Christian woman. <span id="fr_734"></span>[735](#fn_734) Rend not
the letter written on your heart <span id="fr_735"></span>[736](#fn_735)
as the profane king cut with his penknife that delivered to him by
Baruch. <span id="fr_736"></span>[737](#fn_736) Let not Hosea say to you
as to Ephraim, “Thou art like a silly dove.” <span
id="fr_737"></span>[738](#fn_737)

<span id="v.XXXI-p16"></span>My words are too harsh, you will say, and
hardly suitable to a festival like the present. If so, you have provoked
me to it by the nature of your own gifts. So long as you put bitter with
sweet, you must expect the same from me, sharp words that is, as well as
praise.

<span id="v.XXXI-p17"></span>3. However, I do not wish to make light of
your gifts, least of all the basket of fine cherries, blushing with such
a virgin modesty that I can fancy them freshly gathered by
Lucullus <span id="fr_738"></span>[739](#fn_738) himself. For it was he
who first introduced the fruit at Rome after his conquest of Pontus and
Armenia; and the cherry tree is so called because he brought it from
Cerasus. Now as the Scriptures do not mention cherries, but do speak of
a basket of figs, <span id="fr_739"></span>[740](#fn_739) I will use
these instead to point my moral. May you be made of fruits such as those
which grow before God’s temple and of which He says, “Behold they are
good, very good.” <span id="fr_740"></span>[741](#fn_740) The Saviour
likes nothing that is half and half, and, while he welcomes the hot and
does not shun the cold, he tells us in the Apocalypse that he will spew
the lukewarm out of his mouth. <span id="fr_741"></span>[742](#fn_741)
Wherefore we must be careful to celebrate our holy day not so much with
abundance of food as with exultation of spirit. For it is altogether
unreasonable to wish to honor a martyr by excess who himself, as you
know, pleased God by fasting. When you take food always recollect that
eating should be followed by reading, and also by prayer. And if, by
taking this course, you displease some, repeat to yourself the words of
the Apostle: “If I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of
Christ” <span id="fr_742"></span>[743](#fn_742)
