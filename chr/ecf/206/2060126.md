id="v.CXV-p1.1"></span>Letter CXV. To Augustine.</span>

<span id="v.CXV-p2"></span>A short but most friendly letter in which
Jerome excuses himself for the freedom with which he has dealt with
Augustine’s questions (the allusion is to Letter CXII.) and hopes that
henceforth they may be able to avoid controversy and to labour like
brothers in the field of scripture.

<span id="v.CXV-p3"></span>Written probably in 405 <span
class="c17"><span id="v.CXV-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span>
