<span id="v.LXXXV-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.LXXXV-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXXV. To Paulinus.</span>

<span id="v.LXXXV-p2"></span>Paulinus had asked Jerome two questions,
(1) how can certain passages of scripture ([Exod.
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#013.md), [Rom.
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#016)<span id="v.LXXXV-p2.1"></span>.md)
be reconciled with Free Will? and (2) Why are the children of believers
said to be holy ([1 Cor. vii. 14](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#014.md)<span
id="v.LXXXV-p2.2"></span>) apart from baptismal grace? For the first of
these questions Jerome refers Paulinus to his version (newly made) of
Origen’s treatise, *On First Principles*. For the second he quotes the
explanation of Tertullian. Written in 400 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.LXXXV-p2.3"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.LXXXV-p3"></span>1. Your words urge me to write to you but
your eloquence deters me from doing so. For as a letter-writer you are
almost as good as Tully. You complain that my letters are short and
unpolished: this is not due to carelessness but to fear of you, lest
writing to you at greater length I should but send you more sentences to
find fault with. Moreover, to make a clean breast of it to a good man
like you, just about the time the vessels sail for the west, so many
letters are demanded of me at once that, if I were to reply to all my
correspondents, I should be unable to accomplish my task. Hence it
happens that, neglecting the niceties of composition and not revising
the work of my secretaries, I dictate whatever first comes into my head.
Thus when I write to you I regard you as a friend and not as a critic.

<span id="v.LXXXV-p4"></span>2. Your letter propounds two questions, the
first, why God hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and why the apostle said: “So
then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God
that sheweth mercy;” <span id="fr_2608"></span>[2609](#fn_2608.md) and
other things which appear to do away with free will: the second, how
those are holy who are born of believing, that is, of baptized
parents, <span id="fr_2609"></span>[2610](#fn_2609.md) seeing that without
the gift of grace <span id="page_182">p. 182</span> <span
id="v.LXXXV-Page_182"></span>afterwards received and kept they cannot be
saved.

<span id="v.LXXXV-p7"></span>3. Your first question is most ably
answered by Origen in his treatise *on First Principles* which, at the
request of my friend Pammachius, I have recently translated. This task
has occupied me so fully that I am unable to keep my word with you and
must again postpone the sending my commentary on Daniel. Indeed,
distinguished and devoted to me as Pammachius is, had he been alone in
his request, I should have deferred it to another time, but, as it was,
almost all our brothers at Rome urged the same demand declaring that
many persons were in danger, and that some even accepted Origen’s
heretical teaching. I have found myself forced therefore to translate a
book in which there is more of bad than of good, and to keep to this
rule that I should neither add nor subtract but should preserve in Latin
in its integrity the true sense of the Greek. You will be able to borrow
a copy of my version from the aforesaid brother, though in your case the
Greek will serve quite as well; neither should you, who can drink from
the fountain head, turn to the muddy streamlets supplied by my poor
wits.

<span id="v.LXXXV-p8"></span>4. Moreover, as I am speaking to an
educated man, well versed both in the sacred scriptures and in secular
literature, I desire to give your excellency this note of warning. Do
not suppose that I am a clumsy buffoon <span
id="fr_2610"></span>[2611](#fn_2610.md) who condemn everything that Origen
has written,—as his injudicious friends falsely assert—or that I have
changed my mind as suddenly as the philosopher Dionysius. <span
id="fr_2611"></span>[2612](#fn_2611.md) The fact is that I repudiate merely
his objectionable dogmas. For I know that one curse hangs over those who
call evil good and over those who call good evil, over those who put
bitter for sweet, and over those who put sweet for bitter. <span
id="fr_2612"></span>[2613](#fn_2612.md) Who would go so far in praise of
another man’s teaching as to acquiesce in blasphemy?

<span id="v.LXXXV-p12"></span>5. Your second question is discussed by
Tertullian in his books *on* *Monogamy* <span
id="fr_2613"></span>[2614](#fn_2613.md) where he declares that the children
of believers are called holy because they are as it were candidates for
the faith and have suffered no pollution from idolatry. Consider also
that the vessels of which we read in the tabernacle are called holy and
everything else required for the ceremonial worship: although in
strictness of speech there can be nothing holy except creatures which
know of and worship God. But it is a scriptural usage sometimes to give
the name of holy to those who are clean, or who have been purified, or
who have made expiation. For instance, it is written of Bathsheba that
she was made holy <span id="fr_2614"></span>[2615](#fn_2614.md) from her
uncleanness, <span id="fr_2615"></span>[2616](#fn_2615.md) and the temple
itself is called the holy place.

<span id="v.LXXXV-p16"></span>6. I beg that you will not silently in
your mind accuse me either of vanity or of insincerity. God bears me
witness in my conscience that the unavoidable circumstances mentioned
above drew me back when I was just going to grapple with my commentary;
and you know that what is done when the mind is pre-occupied is never
well done. I gladly accept the cap that you have sent me, a mark, though
small, of no small affection and just the thing to keep an old man’s
head warm. I am delighted alike with the gift and with the giver.
