<span id="v.LXXXI-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.LXXXI-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXXI. To Rufinus.</span>

<span id="v.LXXXI-p2"></span>A friendly letter of remonstrance written
by Jerome to Rufinus on receipt of his version of the <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.LXXXI-p2.1"></span>περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span> see the
preceding letter). Being sent in the first instance to Pammachius this
latter treacherously suppressed it and thus put an end to all hope of
the reconciliation of the two friends. The date of the letter is 399
<span class="c17"><span id="v.LXXXI-p2.2"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.LXXXI-p3"></span>1. That you have lingered some time at Rome
your own language shews. Yet I feel sure that a yearning to see your
spiritual parents <span id="fr_2487"></span>[2488](#fn_2487.md) would have
drawn you to your native country, <span
id="fr_2488"></span>[2489](#fn_2488.md) had not grief for your mother
deterred you lest a sorrow scarce bearable away might have proved
unbearable at home.

<span id="v.LXXXI-p6"></span>As to your complaint that men listen only
to the dictates of passion and refuse to acquiesce in your judgement and
mine; the Lord is witness to my conscience that since our reconciliation
I have harboured no rancour in my breast to injure anyone; on the
contrary I have taken the utmost pains to prevent any chance occurrence
being set down to ill-will. But what can I do so long as everyone
supposes that he has a right to do as he does and thinks that in
publishing a slander he is requiting not originating a calumny? True
friendship ought never to conceal what it thinks.

<span id="v.LXXXI-p7"></span>The short preface to the books <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.LXXXI-p7.1"></span>περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span> which
has been sent to me I recognize as yours by the style. You know best
with what intention it was written; but even a fool can see how it must
necessarily be understood. Covertly or rather openly I am the person
aimed at. I have often myself feigned a controversy to practise
declamation. <span id="fr_2489"></span>[2490](#fn_2489.md) Thus I might now
recall this well-worn artifice and praise you in your own method. <span
id="fr_2490"></span>[2491](#fn_2490.md) But far be it from me to imitate
what I blame in you. In fact I have so far restrained my feelings that I
make no charge against you, and, although injured, decline for my part
to injure a friend. But another time, if you wish to follow any one,
pray be satisfied with your own judgement. The objects which we seek are
either good or bad. If they are good, they need no help from another;
and if they are bad, the fact that many sin together is no excuse. I
prefer thus to expostulate with you as a friend rather than to give
public vent to my indignation at the wrong I have suffered. I want you
to see that when I am reconciled to anyone I become his sincere friend
and do not—to borrow a figure from Plautus <span
id="fr_2491"></span>[2492](#fn_2491.md) —while offering him bread with one
hand, hold a stone in the other.

<span id="v.LXXXI-p11"></span>2. My brother Paulinian has not yet
returned from home and I fancy that you will see him at Aquileia at the
house of the reverend pope Chromatius. <span
id="fr_2492"></span>[2493](#fn_2492.md) I am also sending the reverend
presbyter Rufinus <span id="fr_2493"></span>[2494](#fn_2493.md) on business
to Milan by way of Rome, and have requested him to communicate to you my
feelings and respects. I am sending the same message to the rest of my
friends; lest, as the apostle says, ye bite and devour one another, ye
be consumed one of another. <span id="fr_2494"></span>[2495](#fn_2494.md)
It only remains for you and your friends to shew your moderation by
giving no offence to those who are disinclined to put up with it. For
you will hardly find everyone like me. There are few who can be pleased
with pretended eulogies.
