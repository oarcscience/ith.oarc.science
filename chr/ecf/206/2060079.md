<span id="v.LXVIII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.LXVIII-p1.1"></span>Letter LXVIII. To Castrutius.</span>

<span id="v.LXVIII-p2"></span>Castrutius, a blind man of Pannonia, had
set out for Bethlehem to visit Jerome. However, on reaching Cissa
(whether that in Thrace or that on the Adriatic is uncertain) he was
induced by his friends to turn back. Jerome writes to thank him for his
intention and to console him for his inability to carry it out. He then
tries to comfort him in his blindness (1) by referring to Christ’s words
concerning the man born blind ([Joh. ix.
3](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#003)<span id="v.LXVIII-p2.1"></span>.md) and
(2) by telling him the story of Antony and Didymus. The date of the
letter is 397 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.LXVIII-p2.2"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.LXVIII-p3"></span>1. My reverend son Heraclius the deacon
has reported to me that in your eagerness to see me you came as far as
Cissa, and that, though a Pannonian and consequently a land animal, you
did not quail before the surges of the Adriatic and the dangers of the
Ægean and Ionian seas. He tells me that you would have actually
accomplished your purpose, had not our brethren with affectionate care
held you back. I thank you all the same and regard it as a kindness
shewn. For in the case of friends one must accept the will for the deed.
Enemies often give us the latter, but only sincere attachment can bring
us the former. And now that I am writing to you I beseech you do not
regard the bodily affliction which has befallen you as due to sin. When
the Apostles speculated concerning the man that was born blind from the
womb and asked our Lord and Saviour: “Who did sin, this man or his
parents, that he was born blind?” they were told “Neither hath this man
sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God should be made
manifest in him.” <span id="fr_1996"></span>[1997](#fn_1996.md) Do we not
see numbers of heathens, Jews, heretics and men of various opinions
rolling in the mire of lust, bathed in blood, surpassing wolves in
ferocity and kites in rapacity, and for all this the plague does not
come nigh their dwellings? <span id="fr_1997"></span>[1998](#fn_1997.md)
They are not smitten as other men, and accordingly they wax insolent
against God and lift up their faces even to heaven. We know on the other
hand that holy men are afflicted with sicknesses, miseries, and want,
and perhaps they are tempted <span id="page_141">p. 141</span> <span
id="v.LXVIII-Page_141"></span>to say “Verily I have cleansed my heart in
vain, and washed my hands in innocency.” Yet immediately they go on to
reprove themselves, “If I say, I will speak thus; behold I should offend
against the generation of thy children.” <span
id="fr_1998"></span>[1999](#fn_1998.md) If you suppose that your blindness
is caused by sin, and that a disease which physicians are often able to
cure is an evidence of God’s anger, you will think Isaac a sinner
because he was so wholly sightless that he was deceived into blessing
one whom he did not mean to bless. <span
id="fr_1999"></span>[2000](#fn_1999.md) You will charge Jacob with sin,
whose vision became so dim that he could not see Ephraim and
Manasseh, <span id="fr_2000"></span>[2001](#fn_2000.md) although with the
inner eye and the prophetic spirit he could foresee the distant future
and the Christ that was to come of his royal line. <span
id="fr_2001"></span>[2002](#fn_2001.md) Were any of the kings holier than
Josiah? Yet he was slain by the sword of the Egyptians. <span
id="fr_2002"></span>[2003](#fn_2002.md) Were there ever loftier saints than
Peter and Paul? Yet their blood stained the blade of Nero. And to say no
more of men, did not the Son of God endure the shame of the cross? And
yet you fancy those blessed who enjoy in this world happiness and
pleasure? God’s hottest anger against sinners is when he shews no anger.
Wherefore in Ezekiel he says to Jerusalem: “My jealousy will depart from
thee and I will be quiet and will be no more angry.” <span
id="fr_2003"></span>[2004](#fn_2003.md) For “whom the Lord loveth He
chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.” <span
id="fr_2004"></span>[2005](#fn_2004.md) The father does not instruct his
son unless he loves him. The master does not correct his disciple unless
he sees in him signs of promise. When once the doctor gives over caring
for the patient, it is a sign that he despairs. You should answer thus:
“as Lazarus in his lifetime <span id="fr_2005"></span>[2006](#fn_2005.md)
received evil things so will I now gladly suffer torments that future
glory may be laid up for me.” For “affliction shall not rise up the
second time.” <span id="fr_2006"></span>[2007](#fn_2006.md) If Job, a man
holy and spotless and righteous in his generation, suffered terrible
afflictions, his own book explains the reason why.

<span id="v.LXVIII-p15"></span>2. That I may not make myself tedious or
exceed the due limits of a letter by repeating old stories, I will
briefly relate to you an incident which happened in my childhood. The
saintly Athanasius bishop of Alexandria had summoned the blessed Antony
to that city to confute the heretics there. Hereupon Didymus, a man of
great learning who had lost his eyes, came to visit the hermit and, the
conversation turning upon the holy scriptures, Antony could not help
admiring his ability and eulogizing his insight. At last he said: You do
not regret, do you, the loss of your eyes? At first Didymus was ashamed
to answer, but when the question had been repeated a second time and a
third, he frankly confessed that his blindness was a great grief to him.
Whereupon Antony said: “I am surprised that a wise man should grieve at
the loss of a faculty which he shares with ants and flies and gnats, and
not rejoice rather in having one of which only saints and apostles have
been thought worthy.” From this story you may perceive how much better
it is to have spiritual than carnal vision and to possess eyes into
which the mote of sin cannot fall. <span
id="fr_2007"></span>[2008](#fn_2007.md)

<span id="v.LXVIII-p17"></span>Though you have failed to come this year,
I do not yet despair of your coming. If the reverend deacon <span
id="fr_2008"></span>[2009](#fn_2008.md) who is the bearer of this letter is
again caught in the toils of your affection, and if you come hither in
his company I shall be delighted to welcome you and shall readily
acknowledge that the delay in payment is made up for by the largeness of
the interest.

prophet, Heraclius succeeded in obtaining from him. See the Preface to
the Commentary.
