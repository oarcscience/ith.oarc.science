<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p2"></A>1.&#160; I will call in my affliction, on the Power that subdues all;&#8212;that is able to subdue, the Captor in his wrath,&#8212;as it overcame Legion.<i>&#160; R., Glory to His grace!</i></p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p3"></A>2.&#160; The Evil One has repaid me my brethren, debts that he borrowed not of me:&#8212;the good <i>God</i> likewise has repaid me, mercies that I lent Him not.&#8212;Come and marvel ye at these two things!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p4"></A>3.&#160; The good <i>God</i> has divided and given, my misdeeds to His grace,&#8212;my offences to His justice; His mercy has blotted out my misdeeds&#8212;His judgment has requited my offences.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p5"></A>4.&#160; Sin was exceeding wroth, and abode in alarm,&#8212;when she saw how grace, put restraint on freedom, that she might overcome transgressions.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p6"></A>5.&#160; Glow Thou, O my Lord, and send down Thy love, break out and pour forth Thy wrath!&#8212;Thy wrath to destroy, Thy love to rescue&#8212;the captives from the captor!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p7"></A>6.&#160; The days wherein the Evil One, decreed to cast me forth,&#8212;as with a sling into perdition, in them the good God has bound up and kept&#8212;my soul in the bundle of life.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p8"></A>7.&#160; The men of speech who keep not silence, from praising continually,&#8212;who have kept me in the midst of waves, and supported me that I fell not, let them give praise in my stead, O my Lord!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p9"></A>8.&#160; For who has at any time sufficed, in presence of the grace,&#8212;of the mercies which surrounded him, that I should suffice to praise&#8212;the mercies that encompass me?</p>
