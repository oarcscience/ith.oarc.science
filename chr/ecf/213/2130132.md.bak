<span id="ii.ix.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.ix.ii-p1.1"></span>Epistle V.</span>

<span id="ii.ix.ii-p2"></span>*To Etherius, Bishop of Lugdunum (Lyons*).

<span id="ii.ix.ii-p3"></span>Gregory to Etherius, Bishop.

<span id="ii.ix.ii-p4"></span>Although what we say is very distressing
to us, and fraternal compassion rather moves us to weep than allows us
to lay down anything concerning the things we have heard of, yet
solicitude for the government undertaken by us pricks our heart with an
urgent spur to see with great care to the good of churches, and to
arrange what should be done before their interests might possibly suffer
irretrievably.  It has come, then, to our ears from the report of
certain persons that an affection of the head has so befallen a certain
bishop that it is a matter of groaning and weeping to hear of what he is
wont to do under alienation of mind.  Lest, therefore, while the
shepherd is sick, the flock should be exposed to be torn by the teeth of
the lyer-in-wait (which God forbid), or the interests of the Church
itself should suffer irretrievably, it is necessary for us to treat the
case with cautious provision.  And so, since during the life of a
bishop, whom unavoidable infirmity and not crime withdraws from his
office, no reason allows another to be ordained in his place except on
his resignation <span id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) , let him, if he
is accustomed to have intervals of sanity, himself make petition,
declaring that he is no longer equal to this ministry owing to
subversion of his intellectual faculties by infirmity, and let him
request that another be ordained in his place.  Which being done, let
another who may be worthy be solemnly consecrated bishop in his place,
by the election of all; yet so that, as long as life shall retain the
said bishop in this world, his due expenses be supplied to him by the
same Church.  If, however, he at no time recovers the faculties of a
sound mind, a trustworthy person of approved life must be chosen, who
may be fit for the government of the Church, take thought for the
benefit of souls, restrain the unquiet under the bond of discipline,
take care of ecclesiastical property, and exhibit himself in all
respects ripe and efficient.  And also, should he survive the bishop who
is now sick, he should be consecrated in his place.

<span id="ii.ix.ii-p6"></span>But as to ordinations of presbyters or
deacons, or of any other order, if cause requires any to be made in that
Church, know that this is to be reserved to thy Fraternity, to the end
that, it being in thy diocese, thou mayest enquire concerning the life,
manners, and conduct of him who is chosen to such office.  And if thou
shouldest be satisfied, and there is nothing in him liable to the
censure of canonical strictness, let him attain to his destined order
not otherwise than through ordination by thee.  Let thy Fraternity then,
so proceed, and so order these things with vigilant provision, that the
Church of God may no longer suffer from any neglect, and that thou
mayest warn thy fellow-priests, not only by word but also by example, to
have a care laudably for venerable places.
