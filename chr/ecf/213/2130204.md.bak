<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.iv.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Hymn XXXIX.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p2"></span>1.  There have come to me ransomers
from among the saints, but none has plundered me like the Son of Mary. 
For lo! Elijah brought a dead man to life; and even though he himself
escaped from my hands, yet had I consolation after him, for the dead man
whom he quickened, I carried off from him.  By Elisha son of Shaphat, I
was beaten *as* with rods, for he brought two dead men to life.  By one
staff I in turn bore away both the prophet and the dead whom he had
raised.  *R., Blessed is He Who cleft the tombs of Sheol by His voice!*

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p3"></span>2.  I feared him even Gehazi when I
saw, him lay the staff upon the youth.  The thief took the staff away
and returned; Elisha came and bowed himself; laid himself low as the
child and raised himself up, and walked hither and thither.  I marvelled
at the new mysteries which I saw there, which restored but one youth to
life.  It was well with me *then* when those were *but* mysteries, and
not now when the dead have rebelled and conquered me.

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p4"></span>3.  Moses when I saw the mighty
splendour upon his face, I feared him:  yet not according to what I
feared befel it me.  Nisan in Sheol he caused to spring for me; for a
pasture, a pasture of corpses, of six hundred thousand fell.—This lowly
and despised whom I contemned, has healed the sick and the diseased:  to
others He has multiplied bread, but our bread *even* ours from our
mouths He snatches.

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p5"></span>4.  A mighty feast there was in
Sheol, when I swallowed up Korah and his company.  A great delight Satan
made for me, when he made strife among the Levites.  A <span
id="page_201">p. 201</span> <span
id="iii.iv.xxviii-Page_201"></span>fount of milk and honey, made he flow
for me in a dry place, when the congregation of transgressors went down
to Sheol.—Lo! the righteous have lived and come forth:  Moses sent down
the living thither, but Jesus has revived and brought up the dead.

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p6"></span>5.  It was well with me then, in the
day of the zealous, those in whose swords I had delight.  Phinehas the
zealous pierced and gave me, on the head of his spear *for* my delight,
Zimri and Cozbi both together; on the head of his lance he presented
*them* to me.  To whom then were there ever two fatted oxen, offered on
the head of a spear?—But instead of Cozbi, daughter of princes, the
daughter of Jairus has Jesus rescued from my hands.

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p7"></span>6.  The censer of Aaron caused me to
fear, for he stood between the dead and the living and conquered me. 
The Cross causes me to fear more exceedingly, which has rent open the
graves of Sheol.  The Crucified Whom on it I slew, now by Him am I
slain.  Not very great is his reproach, who is overcome by a warrior in
arms.  Worse to me *is* my reproach than my torment, in that by a
crucified man my strength has been overcome.

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p8"></span>7.  The lance of Phinehas again has
caused me to fear, for by the slaughter he wrought with it he hindered
the pestilence.  The lance guarded the tree of life, it made me glad and
made me sad; it hindered Adam from life, and it hindered death from the
people.  But the lance that pierced Jesus, by it I have suffered; He is
pierced and I groan.  There came out from Him water and blood; Adam
washed and lived and returned to Paradise.

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p9"></span>8.  The Sadducees were *as* a mouth
for me, and disputed with Him after my mind, that there is no rising of
the dead at all.  Jesus answered them in a saying, which I alone
understood; He spake aloud the hateful word and saddened me, “I am the
God of him even of Abraham, and God is not *the God* of the dead.”  It
was well with me then these were *but* words, and He had not *yet*
showed me the life of the dead indeed.

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p10"></span>9.  Jesus son of Nun, slew thirty
kings, and filled the graves and pits for me; he laid waste Jericho and
filled Sheol.  But this Jesus who is come, has wasted the graves of
*their* dead, and has filled the cities of the upper world.  Wherefore
thus when lo! they are like in their names, are they unlike in their
doings?  *That* gave me the body of Achor, but *this* snatched from me
the body of Lazarus.

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p11"></span>10.  Moses trod down that Egyptian,
with his meekness he mingled justice.  Whence has this new law sprung
for me, “If one smite thee on thy cheek, turn to him thy other cheek,
and see that thou hate him not?”  Instead of the strong man of zeal who
trod down and slew, a new man of mercy has risen for us.  Samuel hewed
Agag in pieces, but Jesus healed the paralytic.

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p12"></span>11.  Tender mercy which had as it
were waxed less, lo! in this time has waxed great.  And moreover it was
*then* detested, lest *through* it one should transgress the
commandment; for without mercy Saul and Ahab, were slain because they
desired, to have mercy on the evil ones, and they were not slain who
were deserving of punishment.  In my time Jesus has changed this, by
giving life to all men and having compassion on His slayers.

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p13"></span>12.  I remember Samson that lion’s
whelp, who brake and gave me the pillars of Philistia; also that mighty
man of valor Abner son of Ner, took for me that fleet wild roe, Asahel
son of Zeruiah, and smote him and cast him on the ground.  Benaiah in
the holy temple slew Jacob, justly as it is written.—Because justice has
restrained her sword, henceforth penitents shall rejoice in grace.

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p14"></span>13.  David measured the Edomites, by
line and line and destroyed them.  How merciful then art Thou, O Son of
David!  David’s justice was twofold, when he put to death two lines, and
saved *one* full line alive.—Lo! the Son of David teaches us, “Forgive
thy brother even unto seventy times seven.”  There justice was measured;
but here clemency is without measure.

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p15"></span><span id="page_202">p. 202</span>
<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-Page_202"></span>14.  Of zeal and strength David
was possessed; the lion and the bear he slew together.  He left that
mighty lion and hasted, to meet the strong giant.  With a stone he
quenched his light, and his soul left him and he perished.  But Jesus
cried to the young man that was dead “Young man!”  Even the dead to Him
are sleepers.  That young man He brought to life and rescued from me. 
The despised swine He drowned for me in the sea.

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p16"></span>15.  The Levites slew because of the
calf, their fathers and their brethren.  Jephthah by his own hands was
ready to slay his daughter.  The King of Moab on the wall, was
sacrificing his first-born son:  In presence of his sword I rejoice.—By
Jesus the sword was blunted; yea the fever was rebuked, the sister of
Sheol:  the mother-in-law of Simeon was healed, but the fame of her
healing smote Sheol with pain.

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p17"></span>16.  This Jesus though he be the Son
of the Just One, all that He preaches is grace.  But to me this His
grace is torment.  Envy is the cause of pleasure to us, for Envy at the
beginning mixed for me the first shedding of blood.  Why is it guilty in
the sight of the Son of Mary Who is come commanding, “Thou shalt not be
angry against thy brother?”  He has taken away the sword from between
brethren; while in the sword of Cain I had pleasure from the beginning.

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p18"></span>17.  An honeycomb in the midst of
the skeleton, Samson found—was it then a mystery?  This Jesus has
multiplied for us mysteries.  Amid billows of mysteries have I fallen,
which show me in parable the life of the dead, in all mysteries and in
all types.  “Out of the eater came forth meat” was Samson’s parable. 
But to me it has befallen contrariwise; for the eater has come forth to
me out of the meat, for out of Adam lo! *has come* the Son of Adam Who
has destroyed me.

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p19"></span>18.  Just men likewise have robbed
me manifold, when by them was preached the rising of the dead:  but they
mingled with my sorrows great consolation.  By the prayer of Asa and
Hezekiah, I was fed upon the dead, yea I feasted upon corpses.  Elijah
slew the prophets of Baal and gave them to me, who on the bread of
Jezebel had waxed fat.  The righteous has constrained me to devour, but
Jesus has compelled me to disgorge all that I had eaten.

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p20"></span>19.  I was afraid because of the
sprinkled blood, which Moses sprinkled on every door; for though the
blood of the slain, it was that which saved the living.  Blood from of
old I feared not, save that blood that was on the doors, and this
moreover that was on the Tree.  The blood of the slain is a delight, and
is as sweet perfume:  but the blood of Jesus is to me a terror; for
whenever I come and smell His blood, the savour of life that lurks
therein terrifies me.

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p21"></span>20.  Priests and pontiffs, anointed
men and kings, who foreshow types of the rising of the dead, have never
triumphed through their crosses.  Crowns and diadems were *set on them*;
and when I engaged in struggles with them, I was smitten *sometimes* and
*sometimes* also I smote.  But this carpenter’s son with his crown of
thorns, has humbled and cast down my pride, in His shame and His dying: 
Sheol has seen Him, yea, and fled from before Him.

<span id="iii.iv.xxviii-p22"></span>21.  When the sea saw Moses and
fled, it feared because of his rod, and likewise because of his glory. 
His splendour and his rod and his power, the rock also saw which was
cleft.  But Sheol when her graves were rent, what saw she in Him even in
Jesus?—Instead of splendour He put on the paleness of the dead and made
her tremble.  And if His paleness when slain slew her, how shall she be
able to endure, when He comes to raise the dead, in His Glory!
