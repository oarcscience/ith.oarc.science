id="ii.v.xvi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXIII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xvi-p2"></span>To John, Bishop of Syracuse.

<span id="ii.v.xvi-p3"></span>Gregory to John, &c.

<span id="ii.v.xvi-p4"></span>Our son the glorious exconsul Leontius has
made a serious complaint to us of our brother and fellow-bishop Leo; and
his complaint has altogether disturbed us, since a bishop ought not to
have acted so precipitately and lightly.  This case we have committed,
to be thoroughly enquired into, to our Guardian (*defensoris*) Romanus
when he comes to you.  Further, the messenger who was sent by him (*i.e.
by Leontius*) complains of your Fraternity, that in the defence of the
illustrious physician Archelaus the interests of our brother and
fellow-bishop, the Metropolitan Domitian, suffer damage <span
id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) .  And indeed your Fraternity ought
justly to protect your sons, or it may be in this case the interests of
holy Church, and to give no occasion for evil-speaking to adversaries. 
I doubt not, however, even while thus speaking, that you do take heed to
this:  yet we have enjoined on the same Romanus, when he comes to you,
to arrange with you what is right with regard to this case also.

<span id="ii.v.xvi-p5"></span> This Domitian was bishop of Melitina and
Metropolitan of Armenia, being a relation of the Emperors, see III. 67. 
The physician Archelaus is commended in an epistle not translated (V.
32) to Cyprian, the previous *rector patrimonii* in Sicily, for
protection in some question about property.
