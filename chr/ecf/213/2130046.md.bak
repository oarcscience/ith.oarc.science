<span id="ii.v.xl-p2"></span>To Fortunatus, Bishop of Neapolis (Naples).

<span id="ii.v.xl-p3"></span>Gregory to Fortunatus, &c.

<span id="ii.v.xl-p4"></span>Inasmuch as the Father of God’s servants
whom I had sent to the city of Naples has, by the ordering of God as it
hath pleased Him, departed this life, it has seemed good to me to send
the bearer of these presents, the monk Barbatianus, for the government
of the same monks.  For the present we decide that he shall be Prior, so
that, if his life should approve itself to thy Fraternity, thou mayest
after a little time ordain him as their Father.  For he has some good
qualities that commend him.  But he has this great fault, that he is
exceedingly wise in his own conceit.  And it is evidently known how many
branches of sin may spring from this root.  Let thy Holiness, therefore,
keep careful watch over him; and if you shall find him become wary in
government and humble in his own mind, then, with the permission of God,
advance him to the dignity of Abbot.  But, if he makes little progress
in humility, defer his ordination, and report to me <span
