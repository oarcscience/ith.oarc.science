<span id="ii.v.xlix"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xlix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.v.xlix-p1.1"></span>Epistle CX.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xlix-p2"></span>*To Theoderic and Theodebert, Kings of
the Franks* <span id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md) .

<span id="ii.v.xlix-p4"></span>Gregory to Theoderic, &c.

<span id="ii.v.xlix-p5"></span>Since the renown of your kingdom has been
resplendent of old among all others by the grace of the Christian
religion, great pains should be taken that, wherein you stand out more
glorious than other nations, you should therein please more perfectly
the Almighty Lord who gives health and wealth to kings, and have the
faith which you observe in all ways helpful to you.  We had wished
indeed, most excellent sons, to address to you a discourse of friendly
greeting only, so as to shew our fatherly affection in offices of
charity.  But, seeing that an unlawful proceeding distresses us
exceedingly, it befits us so to exhibit one thing as by no means to pass
over in silence the other which needs amendment.  If you give diligent
attention, you will find that we speak entirely for the security of your
well-being.

<span id="ii.v.xlix-p6"></span>Now it is said that simoniacal heresy
(which was the first to creep in by the devil’s planting against the
Church of God, and was at its very rise smitten and condemned by the
weapon of apostolical vengeance) prevails within the limits of your
kingdom, though faith together with good life ought to be chosen in
priests.

<span id="ii.v.xlix-p7"></span>If good life is wanting, faith has no
merit, as the blessed James attests, who says, *Faith without works is
dead* ([Jam. ii. 18](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.v.xlix-p7.1"></span>).  But what can be the works of a priest who
is convicted of obtaining the dignity of so great a sacrament by a
bribe?  Thus it is brought about that even the very persons who are
desiring sacred orders take no pains to amend their lives or order their
conduct, but busy themselves in amassing wealth wherewith <span
id="page_30">p. 30</span> <span id="ii.v.xlix-Page_30"></span>to buy
sacred dignity.  Hence also it comes to pass that the innocent and poor
recoil from sacred orders, being debarred and looked down upon.  And
while the innocence of the poor man displeases, there is no doubt that
the bribe in the other case commends delinquencies; for, where gold
pleases, so does vice.  Hence, therefore, not only is a deadly wound
inflicted on the souls of the ordainer and of the ordained, but also the
Kingdom of your Excellence is weighed down by the fault of your bishops,
by whose intercessions it ought rather to have been aided.  For, if he
is thought worthy of the priesthood who is supported, not by the merits
of his doings, but by the abundance of his bribes, it remains that
neither gravity nor industry can put in any claim for ecclesiastical
dignities, but that the profane love of gold obtains all.  And, while
vices are remunerated with dignity, he is promoted to the place of the
avenger who perhaps ought to have vengeance executed on himself; and
hence priests are shewn not to profit others, but rather themselves to
perish.  For, when the shepherd is wounded, who may apply medicine for
healing the sheep?  Or how shall he protect the people with the shield
of prayer who exposes himself to be stricken by hostile darts?  Or what
kind of fruit shall he produce out of himself, whose root is infected by
sore disease?  Greater calamity, then, is to be apprehended in those
places where such intercessors are promoted to places of rule, being
such as to provoke the more the anger of God against themselves which
they ought, through themselves, to have appeased in behalf of the
people.

<span id="ii.v.xlix-p8"></span>Moreover, we have heard that the farms of
the Churches do not pay tribute; and we are consequently lost in great
surprise, if unlawful payments be sought from those to whom even lawful
ones are remitted <span id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) .

<span id="ii.v.xlix-p10"></span>Nor does our solicitude allow us to pass
over this evil also; that some, lured by the instigation of vain glory,
snatch all at once, from a lay condition of life, at the dignity of
priesthood, and (what it shames one to say, though it is too serious a
matter to pass over in silence) those who require to be ruled neither
blush nor fear to appear as rulers, and those that require to be taught
as teachers.  Persons assume shamelessly the leadership of souls to whom
the whole way to be taken by the leader is unknown, and who know not
whither even they themselves are walking.  How bad and how venturesome
this is, is shewn even by secular order and discipline.  For, seeing
that a leader of an army is not chosen unless he has been tried in
labour and carefulness, let those who desire with immature haste to
mount to the height of episcopacy consider, at any rate by the aid of
this comparison, of what sort leaders of souls should be; and let them
abstain from attempting suddenly untried labours, lest a blind ambition
for dignity both be to their own penalty and also sow seeds of
pestiferous error to others, they themselves not having learnt what they
have to teach.  Accordingly, greeting you with fatherly affection, we
beg, most excellent sons, that you would be at pains to banish this so
detestable an evil from the limits of your kingdom, and that no excuse,
no suggestion against your soul, find place with you; since he who
neglects to amend what he is able to correct, undoubtedly has the guilt
of the doer.  Wherefore, that you may be able to offer a great gift to
Almighty God, order a synod to be assembled, in which (as we have
enjoined our brethren and fellow-bishops), in the presence of our most
beloved son the abbot Cyriacus, it may be ordained under the obligation
of anathema that no one may ever give and no one ever receive anything
for an ecclesiastical order, nor any one of the laity pass all at once
to the priesthood; that so our Redeemer, whose priests you suffer not to
be ruined among themselves by the enemy, may recompense you for this
service both here and in the life to come.

<span id="ii.v.xlix-p11"></span>Furthermore, we are altogether
astonished that in your kingdom you allow Jews to possess Christian
slaves.  For what are all Christians but members of Christ?  The Head of
these members we all know that you honour faithfully:  but let your
Excellency consider how inconsistent it is to honour the Head and to
allow His members to be trodden on by His enemies.  And so, we beg that
an ordinance of your Excellency may remove the evil of this wrong-doing
from your kingdom, that you may thus shew yourselves the more to be
worthy worshippers of Almighty God, in that you set free His faithful
servants from His enemies.

<span id="ii.v.xlix-p9"></span> The majority of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlix-p9.1"></span>mss.</span> have been *nunc præbeant*instead
of *non tribuant*:  but the reading adopted in the text has good
support, and seems to give more intelligible meaning.  The drift seems
to be that, while it was the custom in Gaul to relieve Church property
even from tribute that might have been exacted lawfully, it was
monstrously inconsistent to burden it unlawfully by the exaction of
bribes for promotion.
