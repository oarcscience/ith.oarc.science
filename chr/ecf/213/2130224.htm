<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xlviii-p2"></A>1. <i>Man.,</i> O, Death, be not thou boastful, over the just:&#160; the sons of thy Lord who at His command, come to <i>dwell with thee</i>.&#8212;2. <i>R., To thee be glory that by Thy command, Death has reigned:&#160; and by Thy Resurrection has been humbled to low estate!</i>&#8212;3. <i>Death.,</i> Herein am I exceeding great, according to thy saying:&#160; that though I be bond-man I trample on them that are free.&#8212;4. <i>M</i>., Adam was chosen and ruler, and under his yoke:&#160; thou, Death, and the Evil One, thy fellow, became bondmen.&#8212;5. <i>D</i>., This is our pride that lo! the slaves have become lords:&#160; Death, and Satan, his fellow, have trampled on Adam.&#8212;6. <i>M</i>., Lo! the humbling of thee and thy fellow, accurst servants! how Enoch trampled on you both, <A NAME="page_219"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 219</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iv.xlviii-Page_219"></A>and rose aloft and reigned.&#8212;7. <i>D</i>., If so be Enoch made me grieve, yet have I comfort for on Noah&#146;s dust in Sheol, lo! I trample.&#8212;8. <i>M</i>., Tremble, O Death, before man, for though a servant, the yoke of his dominion reigns on all creatures.&#8212;9. <i>D</i>., I rejoice then that they are no mean <i>foes</i> that I have overcome:&#160; for according to the greatness of the vanquished, he is great that overcomes.&#8212;10. <i>M</i>., Well does thy voice sing triumph, O Death, over the just:&#160; for Enoch and Elijah have broken thy pair of wings.&#8212;11. <i>D</i>., I know <i>how</i> to weigh my sorrows with my comforts:&#160; in place of two, lo! many are come and coming.&#8212;12. <i>M</i>., All that are come and coming to thee dwell as sojourners, and depart from thy abode as Lazarus.&#8212;13. <i>D</i>., This thy saying hurts me not, rather it heals me:&#160; for Lazarus who rebelled against me, I again subdued.&#8212;14. <i>M</i>., Make answer, O Death, and argue what constrained him, to be raised unless it were a mystery, showing forth his resurrection.&#8212;15. <i>D</i>., Ye are famous in arguing as idle ones, while I labour in my task to discern and perform&#8212;16. <i>M</i>., Thou wast well prepared for argument, what has checked thee?&#160; The truth of our resurrection has constrained thee by its reputations.&#8212;17. <i>D</i>., Ye have made me hated by you, though I be not hateful:&#160; I am he that gives rest to your aged, and your afflicted.&#8212;18. Ye have made me as one that troubles, O ye mortals:&#160; Adam brought death upon you, and I bear the blame.&#8212;19. Gently will I expose you, for I am a slave, and ye are they that by your sins have made me king.&#8212;20. The will of Adam roused me for I was at rest:&#160; I was dead and ye quickened me, that ye might die by me.&#8212;21. I accuse the lying ones, who slew and denied it:&#160; for Adam slew himself and charges me.&#8212;22. The beginning of strife was the accursed serpent which has rightly been crippled:&#160; which crept, entered, and set enmity between me and you.&#8212;23. Satan is passed by and it is against me that ye are roused:&#160; go, strive with the Evil One who made you transgress.&#8212;24. He is my comrade and I deny <i>it</i> not, but though he be much hated, what need that I be blamed for him.&#160; I deny him henceforth.&#8212;25. Hearken to my words, O mortals, and I will console you: &#160;I have afflicted you and I confess the life from the dead.&#8212;26. For there begins to steal into my ears a voice of preparation:&#160; of the trumpet that holds itself ready to sound.&#8212;27. Hear my words and put much oil into your lamps:&#160; for hindrance from my part there is none for you.&#8212;28. <i>Yet</i>, Know ye that even although I have said these things, dear is the sound of your voice in the solitude of Sheol.&#8212;29. For man has been weighed by me, and great is his peace:&#160; for snakes and fishes and birds come to meet him.&#8212;30. But it is a marvel that to the Watchers, too, his converse is dear:&#160; yea, the Evil One in Gehenna, desires his presence.&#8212;31. Ye shall have life from the dead, O ye mortals, and I who am bereft shall be bereft in the midst of Sheol.&#8212;32. Let praise ascend from all to Thee Who quickenest all, and from every quarter gatherest the dust of Adam!</p>
