<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vii.iv-p2"></A>1.&#160; Thou dost not hide thyself in thy bareness, O pearl!&#160; With the love of thee is the merchant ravished also, for he strips off his garments; not to cover thee, [seeing] thy clothing is thy light, thy garment is thy brightness, O thou that art bared!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iv-p3"></A>Thou art like Eve who was clothed with nakedness.&#160; Cursed be he that deceived her and stripped her and left her.&#160; The serpent cannot strip off thy glory.&#160; In the mysteries whose type thou art, women are clothed with Light in Eden.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_525"></A><A HREF="#fn_525"><FONT SIZE="1">526</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iv-p5"></A>2.&#160; Very glistening are the pearls of Ethiopia, as it is written, Who gave thee to Ethiopia [the land] of black men.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_526"></A><A HREF="#fn_526"><FONT SIZE="1">527</FONT></A>
&#160; He that gave light to the Gentiles, both to the Ethiopians and unto the Indians did His bright beams reach.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iv-p7"></A>The eunuch of Ethiopia upon his chariot&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_527"></A><A HREF="#fn_527"><FONT SIZE="1">528</FONT></A>
 saw Philip:&#160; the Lamb of Light met the dark man from out of the water.&#160; While he was reading, the Ethiopian was baptised and shone with joy, and journeyed on!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iv-p9"></A>He made disciples and taught, and out of black men he made men white.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_528"></A><A HREF="#fn_528"><FONT SIZE="1">529</FONT></A>
&#160; And the dark Ethiopic women&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_529"></A><A HREF="#fn_529"><FONT SIZE="1">530</FONT></A>
 became pearls for the Son; He offered them up to the Father, as a glistening crown from the Ethiopians.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iv-p12"></A>3.&#160; The Queen of Sheba&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_530"></A><A HREF="#fn_530"><FONT SIZE="1">531</FONT></A>
 was a sheep&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_531"></A><A HREF="#fn_531"><FONT SIZE="1">532</FONT></A>
 that had come into the place of wolves; the lamp of truth did Solomon give her, who also married&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_532"></A><A HREF="#fn_532"><FONT SIZE="1">533</FONT></A>
 her when he fell away.&#160; She was enlightened and went away, but they were dark as their manner was.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iv-p16"></A>The bright spark which went down home with that blessed [Queen], held on its shining amid the darkness, till the new Day-spring came.&#160; The bright spark met with this shining, and illumined the place.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iv-p17"></A>4.&#160; There are in the sea divers fishes of many cubits, and with all their greatness they are very small; but by thy littleness the crown is made great, like as the Son, by whose littleness Adam was made great.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iv-p18"></A>For the head is thy crown intended:&#160; for the eye thy beauty, for the ear thy goodliness.&#160; Come up from the sea, thou neighbour to the dry land, and come and sojourn by the [seat of] hearing.&#160; Let the ear love the word of life as it loveth thee!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iv-p19"></A>In the ear is the word, and without it is the pearl.&#160; Let it as being warned by thee, <A NAME="page_296"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 296</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vii.iv-Page_296"></A>by thee get wisdom, and be warned by the word of truth.&#160; Be thou its mirror:&#160; the beauty of the Word in thine own beauty shall it see:&#160; in thee it shall learn how precious is the Word on High!&#160; The ear is the leaf:&#160; the flesh is the tree, and thou in the midst of it are a fruit of light, and to the womb that brings forth Light, thou art a type that points.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iv-p20"></A>Thee He used as a parable of that kingdom, O pearl! as He did the virgins that entered into it, five in number, clothed with the light of their lamps!&#160; To thee are those bright ones like, thou that art clad in light!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iv-p21"></A>5.&#160; Who would give a pearl to the daughter of the poor?&#160; For when it hangs on her, it becomes her not.&#160; Gain without price that faith, all of which becomes all the limbs of men.&#160; But for no gold would a lady exchange her pearl.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iv-p22"></A>It were a great disgrace if thou shouldst throw thy pearl away into the mire for nought!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iv-p23"></A>In the pearl of time let us behold that of eternity; for it is in the purse, or in the seal, or in the treasury.&#160; Within the gate there are other gates with their locks and keys.&#160; Thy pearl hath the High One sealed up as taking account of all.</p>
