<span id="ii.v.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.v.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Epistle LXII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxxi-p2"></span>To Romanus, Guardian (Defensorem).

<span id="ii.v.xxxi-p3"></span>Gregory to Romanus, &c.

<span id="ii.v.xxxi-p4"></span>It has come to our ears that the
*tonsuratores* <span id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md) in Sicily, with
wicked presumption, take to themselves the name of *defensores*, and
that they not only are of no utility for the interests of the Church,
but also take occasion hence to commit many irregularities. 
Consequently we enjoin thy Experience by this present authority to
enquire diligently into this.  And, if thou findest any, besides those
who have letters to empower them in such business <span
id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) , usurping henceforth this title, put a
stop to this thing by strict correction.  If, however, thou shouldest
discover any who have proved themselves active and faithful in
ecclesiastical affairs, thou must send us a full and particular report
of them, that we may judge whether they are worthy of a letter <span
id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md) .

<span id="ii.v.xxxi-p8"></span>Furthermore, we desire thee to make a
thorough examination of the accounts of Fortunatus; and, when he has
satisfied all the debts that appear against him, allow him no longer to
have to do with the patrimony, or with any action of our Church, seeing
that, as we have heard, he has conducted himself in such a manner that
he ought not henceforth to have any communication with our people.

<span id="ii.v.xxxi-p9"></span>Furthermore, it has been reported to us
that one Martianus, who has assumed to himself the name of a *defensor*,
has declined to pay obedience to our brother and fellow-bishop John, to
whom we had committed the charge of our patrimony.  Inquire therefore;
and, if it is true, let him be sent into exile, that his disobedience to
him from whose Church he has seized for himself a false title of honour,
and who is promoting the interests of the same, may not go unpunished. 
But, if there are also any others disobedient to the orders of our said
brother, thou wilt by all means visit them with strict punishment.
