<span id="ii.ix.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.ix.xv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXVIII.</span>

<span id="ii.ix.xv-p2"></span>To Phocas, Emperor.

<span id="ii.ix.xv-p3"></span>Gregory to Phocas Augustus.

<span id="ii.ix.xv-p4"></span>It pleases us to consider, with rejoicings
and great thanksgivings, what praises we owe to Almighty God, that the
yoke of sadness has been removed, and we are come to times of liberty
under the imperial Piety of your Benignity.  For that your Serenity has
not found a deacon of the Apostolic See resident at the court according
to ancient custom, is not owing to my negligence, but to most grave
necessity.  For, while all the ministers of this our Church shrunk and
fled with fear from times of such oppression and hardship, it was not
possible to impose on any of them the duty of going to the royal city to
remain at the court.  But now that they have learnt that your Clemency,
by the ordering of God’s grace, has attained to the summit of Empire,
those who had before greatly feared to go there hasten even of
themselves to your feet, moved thereto by joy.  But, seeing that some of
them are so weak from old age as to be hardly able to bear the toil, and
some are deeply engaged in ecclesiastical cares, and the bearer of these
presents, who was the first of all our guardians (*defensores*), has
been long well known to me for his diligence, and proved in life, faith,
and character, I have judged him fit to be sent to the feet of your
Piety <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md) .  I have accordingly, by
God’s permission, made him a deacon, and have been at pains to send him
to you with all speed, that he may be able, when a convenient time is
found, to inform your Clemency of all that is being done in these
parts.  To him I beg your Serenity to deign to incline your pious ears,
that you may find it in your power to have pity on us all the more
speedily as you learn the more truly from his account what our
affliction is.  For in what manner by the daily swords, and by how many
invasions, of the Lombards, lo now for the length of five and thirty
years, we have been oppressed, by no words of description can we fully
express.  But we trust in the Almighty Lord, that He will complete for
us the good things of His consolation which He has begun, and that,
having raised up pious lords in the republic, He will also extinguish
cruel enemies.  And so may the Holy Trinity guard your life for many
years, so that we may the longer rejoice in the good of your Piety,
which we have received after long waiting.
