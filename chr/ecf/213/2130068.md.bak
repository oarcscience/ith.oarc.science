<span id="ii.vi.i-p3"></span>To Romanus, Guardian (Defensorem).

<span id="ii.vi.i-p4"></span>Gregory to Romanus, our guardian in Sicily.

<span id="ii.vi.i-p5"></span>It has been reported to us that our most
reverend brother the bishop Basilius is occupied in legal suits as
though he were one of the last of the people, and unprofitably attends
the courts.  Now, since this thing both renders the man himself vile and
does away with the reverence due to priests, let thy Experience,
immediately on receiving this order, so compel him by strict execution
of it to return to his duty that, through thy insistency, a delay of
five days be not under any excuse allowed him; lest, if thou shouldest
in any way permit him to make such delay, thou with him shouldest come
to be gravely culpable before us.  Given in the month of December,
Indiction 3.
