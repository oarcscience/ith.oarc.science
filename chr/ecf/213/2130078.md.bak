<span id="ii.vi.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.vi.xi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXIX.</span>

<span id="ii.vi.xi-p2"></span>To Eulogius, Patriarch of Alexandria.

<span id="ii.vi.xi-p3"></span>Gregory to Eulogius, &c.

<span id="ii.vi.xi-p4"></span>*As cold water to a thirsty soul, so is
good news from a far country* ([Prov. xxv.
25](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#025)<span id="ii.vi.xi-p4.1"></span>.md). 
But what can be good news to me, so far as concerns the behoof of holy
Church, but to hear of the health and safety of your to me most sweet
Holiness, who, from your perception of the light of truth, both
illuminate the same Church with the word of preaching, and mould it to a
better way by the example of your manners?  As often, too, as I recall
in my heart your oneness of mind with me, and feel that I remain fixed
in your heart, I give thanks to Almighty God that charity cannot be
divided by distance of place.  For, though in body we are far disjoined,
yet in soul we are indivisible.

<span id="ii.vi.xi-p5"></span>Our common son Anatolius the deacon <span
id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) has notified to me in his letters that
in the royal city nothing ecclesiastical has at any time been disturbed
from earthly causes.  But I believe that he had before announced to me
<span id="page_48">p. 48</span> <span id="ii.vi.xi-Page_48"></span>how
your Blessedness had spoken in the cause of the Church and I rejoice to
think that, where you chanced to be present, I do not consider that
there was any want of me.  For I know that you, as a minister of the
truth, a follower of Peter, and a preacher of Holy Church, would speak
what ought to have been heard through the mouth of a teacher from the
Apostle Peter’s See <span id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md) .

<span id="ii.vi.xi-p8"></span>Moreover, before these days, when Abramius
of Alexandria came to me, I had written in reply to your Holiness both
what I thought of your writings which you issued against the Agnoite
heretics <span id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) , and why I had been so
late in replying.  But the said Abramius, compelled by difficulties of
navigation, is reported to have delayed long in the city of Naples; and
so I write again in the same sense in which I had formerly written,
since in your teaching against the heretics that are called Agnoitæ
there was much for us to admire; but to displease us there was nothing. 
And in the same sense I had already written at length to our son
Anatolius the deacon.  Moreover, your doctrine so agreed in all respects
with the Latin Fathers that I find, not to my surprise, that in diverse
languages the Spirit has not been diverse.

<span id="ii.vi.xi-p10"></span>For, as to what you have said about the
fig-tree, Augustine speaks aptly in the same sense; for, when the
evangelist subjoined, *For the time of figs was not yet* ([Mark xi.
13](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#013)<span id="ii.vi.xi-p10.1"></span>.md),
it is plainly shown that the figs which the Lord had sought were fruit
in the synagogue, which had the leaves of the Law, but not the fruit of
works.  For the Creator of all things could not be ignorant that the
fig-tree had no fruit; which was a thing that all might know, since it
was not the time of figs.  But concerning what is written, *That the day
and hour neither the Son nor the angels know* ([Mark xiii.
32](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#032)<span id="ii.vi.xi-p10.2"></span>.md),
your Holiness has quite rightly perceived that this is most certainly to
be referred, not to the said Son with respect to His being the Head, but
with respect to His body, which we are.  With regard to which matter,
the same blessed Augustine in many places adopts this sense (*Quæst.
lib.* lxxxiii. *q.* 60; *lib.* 1 *de Trinit.,* c. 12; *in psalm* vi.,
*init.; in ps.* xxxiv. *serm.* 2).  He mentions also another thing that
may be understood of the same Son, namely that Almighty God sometimes
speaks in a human manner, even as He says to Abraham, *Now I know that
thou fearest God* ([Genes. xxii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#012)<span id="ii.vi.xi-p10.3"></span>.md). 
It was not that God then came to know that He was feared, but that He
then made Abraham know that he feared God.  For, as we speak of a glad
day, not meaning that the day itself is glad, but that it makes us glad,
so also the Almighty Son says that He does not know the day which He
causes not to be known; not that He Himself does not know it, but that
He does not allow it to be known.  Whence also the Father alone is said
to know it, because the Son Who is consubstantial with Him has His
knowledge of what the angels are ignorant of from His divine nature,
whereby He is above the angels.  Whence also it may be more nicely
understood thus; that the Only-begotten, being incarnate and made for us
a perfect man, knew indeed in the nature of His humanity the day and
hour of the judgment, but still it was not from the nature of His
humanity that He knew it.  What then He knew in it He knew not from it,
because God, made man, knew the day and hour of the judgment through the
power of His Deity:  as also at the marriage, when the Virgin Mother
said that wine was wanting, He replied, *Woman, what have I to do with
thee?  Mine hour is not yet come* ([Joh. ii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#004)<span id="ii.vi.xi-p10.4"></span>.md). 
For it was not that the Lord of the angels was subject to the hour,
having, among all things which He had created, made hours and times;
but, because the Virgin Mother, when wine was wanting, wished a miracle
to be done by Him, it was at once answered her, *Woman, what have I to
do with thee?*  As if to say plainly, That I can do a miracle comes to
me of my Father, not of my Mother.  For He who of the nature of His
Father did miracles had it of His mother that He could die.  Whence
also, when He was on the cross, in dying He acknowledged His mother,
whom He commended to the disciple, saying, *Behold thy mother* ([Joh.
xix. 27](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#027.md)<span
id="ii.vi.xi-p10.5"></span>). He says, then, *Woman, what have I to do
with thee?  Mine hour is not yet come.—*That is, “In the miracle, which
I have not of thy nature, I do not acknowledge thee.  When the hour of
death shall come, I shall acknowledge thee as my mother, since I have it
of thee that I can die.”  And thus the knowledge, which He had not of
the nature of humanity whereby He was with the angels a creature, this
He denied that He had with the angels, who are creatures.  The day,
then, and the hour of the judgment He knows as God and man, but for this
reason, that God is man.  It is moreover a thing quite manifest, that
whoso is not a Nestorian cannot in any wise be an Agnoite.  For with
what meaning can one that confesses that the very Wisdom of God was
incarnate say that there is anything that the Wisdom of God is ignorant
of?  It is written, *In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
with God, and the Word was God.  All things were made by him* ([Joh. i.
1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)<span id="ii.vi.xi-p10.6"></span>.md). 
If all things, then without <span id="page_49">p. 49</span> <span
id="ii.vi.xi-Page_49"></span>doubt the day and hour of the judgment. 
Who then can be so senseless as to presume to say that the Word of the
Father made what He is ignorant of?  It is written also, *Jesus knowing
that the Father had given all things into his hands* ([Job xxii.
3](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#003)<span id="ii.vi.xi-p10.7"></span>.md). 
If all things, certainly both the day and the hour of the judgment. 
Who, then, is so foolish as to say that the Son received into His hands
what He knows not?

<span id="ii.vi.xi-p11"></span>But, with respect to the passage in which
He says to the women about Lazarus, *Where have ye laid him* ([Joh. xi.
34](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#034)<span id="ii.vi.xi-p11.1"></span>.md),
I felt exactly as you felt, that, if they say that the Lord did not know
where Lazarus had been buried, and for that reason enquired, they will
undoubtedly be compelled to acknowledge that the Lord did not know in
what places Adam and Eve had hidden themselves after their sin, when He
said in Paradise, *Adam, where art thou* ([Gen. iii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#009)<span id="ii.vi.xi-p11.2"></span>.md)?
or when He chides Cain saying, *Where is Abel thy brother* ([Gen. iv.
9](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#009)<span id="ii.vi.xi-p11.3"></span>.md)? 
But, if He did not know, why did He forthwith add, *Thy brother’s blood
crieth unto me from the ground?*  However, on this passage Severianus
Gabalensis speaks differently, saying that the Lord spoke thus to the
women as it were in the way of rebuke, in that He enquired where they
had laid the dead Lazarus; as if with plain reference to the sin of Eve
He had said, I placed the man in Paradise, whom you have placed in the
sepulchre.

<span id="ii.vi.xi-p12"></span>But to these things our said common son
Anatolius the deacon has replied by putting another question:—What if it
should be objected to me that, even as He who is immortal vouchsafed to
die that He might deliver us from death, and He who is eternal before
all time willed to become subject to time, so the Wisdom of God
vouchsafed to take upon Himself our ignorance that He might deliver us
from ignorance?  But I have not yet given him any reply to this, having
been confined until now by grievous sickness.  Now, however, through
your prayers I have already begun to recover; and, if I should so
recover as to be able to dictate, with the help of the Lord I will reply
to him.  To you it is not for me to say anything on this subject, lest I
should seem to teach you what you know, seeing that even medicines lose
their power of healing, if applied to sound and strong members.

<span id="ii.vi.xi-p13"></span>Furthermore, we apprize you that in this
place we suffer from serious difficulty for want of good interpreters. 
For there are none who can express the sense, while all ever try to
translate the words exactly:  and so they confuse the whole sense of
what has been said.  Whence it comes to pass that we are by no means
able without severe labour to understand what has been translated.

<span id="ii.vi.xi-p14"></span>I have received the blessing of Saint
Mark the Evangelist and of your Blessedness.  And I have been desirous
of sending you some timber; but the ship which came was too small to
carry it.  And yet even that which the Alexandrians saw when they came
is of small size.  For I had prepared some that is much larger for you,
which has not yet been conveyed to the Roman city:  for I waited for it
to be conveyed when the Alexandrian ship should arrive; and it has
remained in the place where it was felled.

<span id="ii.vi.xi-p15"></span>May Almighty God long guard your life for
the edification of Holy Church, and inspire you to pray earnestly for
me; that, being pressed down by my own sins, I may be lifted up before
Almighty God by your prayers.
