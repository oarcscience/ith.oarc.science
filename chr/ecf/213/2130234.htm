<p class="c16"><a name="iii.v.ix-p1"></A> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.v.ix-p1.1"></A>Hymn VIII.</span></p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.v.ix-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ix-p2.1"></A>That</span> Thy Resurrection might be believed among the gainsayers, they sealed Thee up within the sepulchre, and set guards; for it was for Thee that they sealed the sepulchre and set guards, O Son of the Living One!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p3"></A>When they had buried Thee, if they had neglected Thee and left Thee, and gone, there would have been room to lie [and say] that they did steal, O Quickener of all!&#160; When they craftily sealed Thy sepulchre, they made Thy Glory greater.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p4"></A>A type of Thee therefore was Daniel, and also Lazarus; one in the den, which the Gentiles sealed up, and one in the sepulchre, that the People opened.&#160; Lo! their signs and their seals reproved them.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p5"></A>Their mouth had been open, if they had left Thy sepulchre open.&#160; But they went away because they had shut Thy sepulchre and sealed it, and closed up their own mouths.&#160; Yea they closed it, and when they had senselessly covered Thy sepulchre, all the slanderers covered their own heads.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p6"></A>But in Thy Resurrection Thou persuadest them concerning Thy Birth; since the womb was sealed, and the sepulchre closed up; being alike pure in the womb, and living in the sepulchre.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_460"></A><A HREF="#fn_460"><FONT SIZE="1">461</FONT></A>
&#160; The womb and the sepulchre being sealed were witnesses unto Thee.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p8"></A>The belly and hell cried aloud of Thy Birth and Thy Resurrection:&#160; The belly conceived Thee, which was sealed; hell brought Thee forth which was closed up.&#160; Not after nature did either the belly conceive Thee, or hell give Thee up!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p9"></A>Sealed was the sepulchre whereto they had entrusted Thee, that it might keep the dead [safe], Virgin was the womb which no man knew.&#160; Virgin womb and sealed sepulchre, like trumpets, proclaimed Him in the ears of a deaf people.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p10"></A>The sealed belly and the closed rock were amongst the accusers.&#160; For they slandered the Conception as being of the seed of man, and the Resurrection as being of the robbery of man; the seal and the signet convicted them, and pleaded that Thou wert of Heaven.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p11"></A>The people stood between Thy Birth and Thy Resurrection.&#160; They slandered Thy Birth, Thy Death condemned them:&#160; they set aside Thy Resurrection, Thy Birth refuted them; they were two wrestlers that stopped the mouth that slandered.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p12"></A>For Elijah they went and searched the mountains:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_461"></A><A HREF="#fn_461"><FONT SIZE="1">462</FONT></A>
&#160; as they sought him on earth, they the more confirmed that he was taken up.&#160; Their searching bare witness that he was taken up, in that it found him not.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p14"></A>If then prophets that had had forewarning of Elijah&#146;s ascension, doubted as it were of his going up, how much more would impure men speak slander of the Son?&#160; By their own guards He convinced them that He was risen again.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p15"></A>To Thy Mother, Lord, no man knew what name to give.&#160; Should he call her Virgin, her Child stood [there]; and married no man knew her to be!&#160; If then none comprehended Thy Mother, who shall suffice for Thee?</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p16"></A>For she was, alone, Thy Mother; along with all, Thy Sister.&#160; She was Thy mother, she was Thy Sister.&#160; She along with chaste women&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_462"></A><A HREF="#fn_462"><FONT SIZE="1">463</FONT></A>
 was Thy betrothed.&#160; With everything didst Thou adorn Her, Thou ornament of Thy Mother.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p18"></A><A NAME="page_242"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 242</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.ix-Page_242"></A>For she was Thy Bride by nature ere Thou hadst come; she conceived Thee not by nature after Thou wast come, O Holy One, and was a Virgin when she had brought Thee forth holily.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p19"></A>Mary gained in Thee, O Lord, the honours of all married women.&#160; She conceived [Thee] within her without marriage.&#160; There was milk in her breasts, not after the way of nature.&#160; Thou madest the thirsty land suddenly a fountain of milk.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p20"></A>If she carried Thee, Thy mighty look made her burden light; if she gave Thee to eat, it was because Thou wert hungry; if she gave Thee to drink [it was], because Thou wert thirsty; willingly if she embraced Thee, Thou, the coal of mercies, didst keep her bosom safe.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p21"></A>A wonder is Thy Mother.&#160; The Lord entered her, and became a servant:&#160; the Word entered her, and became silent within her; thunder entered her, and His voice was still:&#160; the Shepherd of all entered her; He became a Lamb in her, and came forth bleating.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p22"></A>The Belly of Thy Mother changed the order of things, O Thou that orderest all!&#160; The rich went in, He came out poor:&#160; the High One went in, He came out lowly.&#160; Brightness went into her and clothed Himself, and came forth a despised form.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p23"></A>The Mighty went in, and clad Himself with fear from the Belly.&#160; He that giveth food to all went in, and gat hunger.&#160; He that giveth all to drink went in, and gat thirst.&#160; Naked and bare came forth from her the Clother of all.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p24"></A>The daughters of the Hebrews that cried in the Lamentations of Jeremiah, instead of lamentations of their Scriptures, used lulling-songs from their own books:&#160; a hidden Power within their words was prophesying.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p25"></A>Eve lifted up her eyes from Sheol and rejoiced in that day, because the Son of her daughter as a medicine of life came down to raise up the mother of His mother.&#160; Blessed Babe, that bruised the head of the Serpent that smote her!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p26"></A>She saw the type of Thee from the youth of Isaac the fair.&#160; For Thee Sarah, as seeing that types of thee rested on his childhood, called him, saying, O child of my vows, in whom is hidden the Lord of vows.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p27"></A>Samson the Nazarite shadowed forth a type of Thy working.&#160; He tore the lion, the image of death, whom Thou didst destroy, and caused to go forth from his bitterness the sweetness of life for men.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p28"></A>Hannah also embraced Samuel; for Thy righteousness was hidden in him who hewed in pieces Agag as [a type] of the wicked one.&#160; He wept over Saul, because Thy goodness also was shadowed forth in him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_463"></A><A HREF="#fn_463"><FONT SIZE="1">464</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p30"></A>How meek art Thou!&#160; How mighty art Thou, O Child!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_464"></A><A HREF="#fn_464"><FONT SIZE="1">465</FONT></A>
 &#160;Thy judgment is mighty, Thy love is sweet!&#160; Who can stand against Thee?&#160; Thy Father is in Heaven, Thy Mother is on earth; who shall declare Thee?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_465"></A><A HREF="#fn_465"><FONT SIZE="1">466</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p33"></A>If a man should seek after Thy Nature, it is hidden in Heaven in the mighty Bosom of the Godhead; and if a man seek after Thy visible Body, it is laid down before their eyes in the lowly bosom of Mary.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p34"></A>The mind wanders between Thy generations, O Thou Rich One!&#160; Thick folds are upon Thy Godhead.&#160; Who can sound Thy depths, Thou great Sea that made itself little?</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p35"></A>We come to see Thee as God, and, lo! Thou art a man:&#160; we come to see Thee as man, and there shineth forth the Light of Thy Godhead!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p36"></A>Who would believe that Thou art the Heir of David&#146;s Throne?&#160; A manger hast Thou inherited out of [all] his beds, a cave has come down to Thee out of all his palaces.&#160; Instead of his chariots a common ass&#146;s colt, perchance, comes down to Thee.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p37"></A><A NAME="page_243"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 243</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.ix-Page_243"></A>How fearless art Thou, O Babe, that dost let all have thee [to carry]:&#160; upon every one that meets with Thee dost Thou smile:&#160; to every one that sees Thee, art Thou glad-some!&#160; Thy love is as one that hungers after men.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p38"></A>Thou makest no distinction between Thy fathers and strangers, nor Thy Mother and maidservants, nor her that suckled Thee and the unclean.&#160; Was it Thy forwardness or Thy love, O Thou that lovest all?</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p39"></A>What moves Thee that Thou didst let all that saw Thee have Thee, both rich and poor?&#160; Thou helpedst them that called Thee not.&#160; Whence came it that Thou hungeredst so for men?</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p40"></A>How great was Thy love, that if one rebuked Thee, Thou wast not wroth! if a man threatened Thee, Thou wast not terrified! if one hissed at Thee, Thou didst not feel vexed!&#160; Thou art above the laws of the avengers of injuries.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p41"></A>Moses was meek, and [yet] his zeal was harsh, for he struggled and slew.&#160; Elisha also, who restored a child to life, tore a multitude of children in pieces by bears.&#160; Who art Thou, O Child, whose love is greater than that of the Prophets?</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.ix-p42"></A>The son of Hagar who was wild, kicked at Isaac.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_466"></A><A HREF="#fn_466"><FONT SIZE="1">467</FONT></A>
&#160; He bore it and was silent, and his mother was jealous.&#160; Art Thou the mystery of him, or is not he the type of Thee? art thou like Isaac, or is it not he that is like Thee?</p>
