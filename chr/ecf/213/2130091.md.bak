<span id="ii.vii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.vii.ix-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXIII.</span>

<span id="ii.vii.ix-p2"></span>To Marinianus, Bishop of Ravenna.

<span id="ii.vii.ix-p3"></span>Gregory to Marinianus, &c.

<span id="ii.vii.ix-p4"></span>On the arrival here of a certain man of
Ravenna, I was smitten by most grievous sorrow for that he told me of
thy Fraternity being sick from vomiting of blood.  On this account we
have caused enquiry to be made carefully and severally of those here
whom we know to be well-read physicians, and have sent in writing to
your Holiness their several opinions and prescriptions.  All, however,
prescribe before all else quiet and silence, which I greatly doubt
whether thy Fraternity can have in thine own Church.  And accordingly it
seems good to me that, when the Church there has been provided
for—whether with such as may accomplish the solemnities of mass, or with
such as may take charge of the episcopate, and may be able to shew
hospitality and hold receptions, or such as may superintend the
guardianship of monasteries—thy Fraternity should come to me before the
summer season, that I may, as far as I can, take special charge of thy
sickness, and keep thee from being disturbed, since the physicians say
that the summer season is exceedingly dangerous for this kind of
sickness.  And I greatly fear lest, if thou shouldest have any cares
together with the unfavourableness of the season, there might be further
risk to thee from this disorder.  I too myself am very weak, and it is
in all respects advantageous that thou shouldest, with the favour of
God, return to thy Church in health; or certainly, if thou art to be
called, that thou shouldest be called in the hands of thy friends; and
that I, who see myself to be very near death, if Almighty God should be
pleased to call me before thee, should pass away in thy hands.  But if
the circumstances of the present time stand in the way of thy coming,
Ago <span id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md) may be treated with, some
small present being given him, that he may himself send one of his
people with thee as far as Rome.  If, then, thou feelest thyself held
heavily by this sickness, and <span id="page_59">p. 59</span> <span
id="ii.vii.ix-Page_59"></span>arrangest to come, thou must come with few
attendants, since, while thou stayest with me in the episcopal residence
(*episcopium*), thou wilt have daily attendance from this Church.

<span id="ii.vii.ix-p6"></span>Furthermore, I neither exhort nor
admonish thee, but straitly charge thee, that thou by no means presume
to fast, since the physicians say that the practice is very prejudicial
to this disorder; except that, if by chance a great solemnity demands
it, I concede it five times in the year.  Thou must also refrain from
vigils; and let the prayers which in the city of Ravenna are wont to be
said over the wax-taper, and the expositions of the Gospel which are
given by priests about the time of the Paschal solemnity, be delivered
by another.  And by no means impose on thyself, beloved, any labour
beyond thy powers.  I have said this that, if thou shouldest feel
thyself better, and shouldest put off thy coming, thou mayest know what
to observe by my command.

referred to as Ago also in IV. 11.  It was the Lombard occupation of a
great part of Italy at that time that was apprehended as likely to
impede a journey from Ravenna to Rome.
