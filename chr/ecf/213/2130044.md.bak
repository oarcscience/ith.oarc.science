<span id="ii.v.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.v.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Epistle LXXXI.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxxviii-p2"></span>*To Maximus, Bishop of Salona* <span
id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md) .

<span id="ii.v.xxxviii-p4"></span>Gregory to Maximus, &c.

<span id="ii.v.xxxviii-p5"></span>Although to what was faulty in thy
ordination at the first thou hast added serious evil through the fault
of disobedience, yet we, tempering with becoming moderation the
authority of the Apostolic See, have never been incensed against thee to
the extent that the case demanded.  But our displeasure which thou hadst
excited against thyself continued the longer in that a sense of the
responsibility entrusted to us tormented us exceedingly, lest we might
seem to be passing over without attention certain unlawful doings of
thine that we had heard of.  And, if thou considerest well, thou wilt
see that thou thyself, by deferring to satisfy us, didst confirm these
reports, and thereby didst exasperate us the more against thee.  But now
that, following wholesome counsel, thou hast submitted thyself humbly to
the yoke of obedience, and that thy love, in doing penance <span
id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md) , has purged itself, as we directed, by
fitting satisfaction, understand thou that the favour of brotherly <span
id="page_21">p. 21</span> <span id="ii.v.xxxviii-Page_21"></span>charity
is restored to thee, and give thanks that thou art received into our
fellowship:  for, as it becomes us to be strict with those who persevere
in a fault, so does it to be kind in pardoning those who return to a
better mind.  Now, therefore, that thy Fraternity knows that he has
recovered the communion of the Apostolic See, let him send some one to
us, according to custom, to receive and convey to him the pallium.  For,
whilst we do not suffer unlawful things to be perpetrated, we no less
refuse not what is customary.  Further, though the discharge of the
duties of our position might have called upon us to concede this, yet we
are greatly constrained thereto by the request of our most sweet and
excellent son, the lord Exarch Callinicus, that we would treat thee with
moderation.  His most dear wish we cannot resist, nor can we cause him
sorrow.

<span id="ii.v.xxxviii-p6"></span> According to a narrative found in
some few codices of the Registrum Epistolarum, and printed in an
appendix by the Benedictine Editors, the penance done by Maximus at
Ravenna consisted in his prostrating himself on the pavement of the city
for three hours and exclaiming, “Peccavi Deo, et beatissimo papæ
Gregorio.”
