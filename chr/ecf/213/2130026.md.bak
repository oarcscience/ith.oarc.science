<span id="ii.v.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.v.xx-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXIII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xx-p2"></span>*To Andrew* <span
id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) .

<span id="ii.v.xx-p4"></span>Gregory to Andrew.

<span id="ii.v.xx-p5"></span>On hearing that your Glory had been
severely afflicted with grief and sickness, I condoled with you
exceedingly.  But learning presently that the malady had entirely left
you, I soon turned my sorrow into joy, and returned great thanks to
Almighty God for that He smote that He might heal, afflicted that He
might lead to true joys.  For hence it is written, *Whom the Lord loveth
he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth* ([Heb. xii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#006)<span id="ii.v.xx-p5.1"></span>.md). 
Hence the Truth in person says, *My Father is the husbandman, and every
branch in me that beareth not fruit, he will take away; but every branch
that beareth fruit, he will purge it, that it may bring forth more
fruit* ([John 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#002)<span id="ii.v.xx-p5.2"></span>.md). 
For the unfruitful branch is taken away, because a sinner is utterly
rooted up.  But the fruitful branch is said to be purged, because it is
cut down by discipline that it may be brought to more abundant grace. 
For so the grain of the ears of corn, beaten with the threshing
instrument, is stript of its awn and chaff.  So the olives, pressed in
the oil-press, flow forth into the fatness of oil.  So the bunches of
grapes pounded with the heels, liquify into wine.  Rejoice, therefore,
good man, for that in this thy <span id="page_12">p. 12</span> <span
id="ii.v.xx-Page_12"></span>scourge and this thy advancement thou seest
that thou art loved by the Eternal Judge.

<span id="ii.v.xx-p6"></span>Furthermore, I beg that my daughter
Gloriosa, your wife, be greeted in my name.  Now may Almighty God keep
you under heavenly protection, and comfort you both now with abundance
of gifts and hereafter with the retribution of reward.
