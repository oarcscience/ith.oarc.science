id="ii.v.xix-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXVII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xix-p2"></span>To Romanus, Guardian (Defensorem).

<span id="ii.v.xix-p3"></span>Gregory to Romanus, &c.

<span id="ii.v.xix-p4"></span>It has come to our ears that certain men,
having altogether too little discernment, desire us to become implicated
in their risks, and wish to be so defended by ecclesiastical persons,
that the ecclesiastical persons themselves may be bound by their guilt. 
Wherefore I admonish thee by this present injunction, and through thee
our brother and fellow-bishop, the lord John, or others whom it may
concern, that with regard to ecclesiastical patronage of people (whether
you should have received letters from me, or none should have been
addressed to you), you should bestow it with such moderation that, if
any have been implicated in public peculations, they may not appear to
be unjustly defended by us, lest we should in any way transfer to
ourselves, by venturing on indiscreet defence, the ill repute of evil
doers:  but so far as becomes the Church, by admonishing and applying
the word of intercession, succour whom you can; so that you may both
give them aid, and not stain the repute of holy Church.
