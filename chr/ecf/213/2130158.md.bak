<span id="ii.x.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.x.viii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XVII.</span>

<span id="ii.x.viii-p2"></span>To Felix, Bishop of Messana.

<span id="ii.x.viii-p3"></span>To our most reverend brother, the Bishop
Felix, Gregory, servant of the servants of God <span
id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) .

<span id="ii.x.viii-p5"></span>Our Head, which is Christ, to this end
has willed us to be His members, that through His large charity and
faithfulness He might make us one body in Himself, to whom it befits us
so to cling that, since without Him we can do nothing, through Him we
may be enabled to be what we are called.  From the citadel of the Head
let nothing divide us, lest, if we refuse to be His members, we be
deserted of Him, and wither as branches cast off from the vine.  That we
may be counted worthy, then, to be the habitation of our Redeemer, let
us abide with the whole desire of our heart in His love.  For he says,
*He that loveth me will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and
we will make our abode with him* ([Joh. xiv.
23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023)<span id="ii.x.viii-p5.1"></span>.md). 
Now thy Love, most dear brother, has demanded of us that we should reply
to thy enquiries with the authority of the Apostolic See.  And, though
we make haste to do this, not at length but succinctly (because of
certain pressing cares that have come upon us, through the hindrance of
our sins), yet we commit what follows to thy attention for wider
enquiry, and investigation of other institutes of holy fathers.  For a
mind worn and weighed down with burdens and pressing cares cannot effect
so much good, or speak of these things so freely, as can one that is
joyful and free from depression.  We have not therefore given the
preference to such cares as wishing to deny to thy Holiness this and
such other information. as we might find to be needful, but in order
that what is here found deficient may be more fully enquired into.

<span id="ii.x.viii-p6"></span>For, following the examples of thy
predecessors, thou hast thought it right to consult the Apostolic See,
in which thou hast been brought up and educated, on three points; that
is on marriages of consanguinity, on vexation of bishops by
subordinates, and on doubt with respect to the consecration of
churches.  Know then that what I wrote to Augustine, bishop of the
nation of the Angli (who was, as thou rememberest, thy pupil), about
marriages of consanguinity was written specially to him and to the
nation of the Angli which had recently come to the faith, lest from
alarm at anything too austere they should recede from their good
beginning; but it was not written generally to others.  Of this the
whole Roman city is my witness.  Nor did I thus order in those writings
with the intention that, after they had been settled in the faith with a
firm root, they should not be separated, if found to be below the proper
degree of consanguinity, or should be united, if below the proper line
of affinity, that is as far as the seventh generation.  But for those
who are still neophytes it is very often right in the first place to
teach them, and by word and example to instruct them, to avoid unlawful
things, and then afterwards, reasonably and faithfully, to shut out
things that they may have done in matters of this kind.  For according
to the Apostle who says, *I have fed you with milk, not with meat* ([1
Cor. iii. 2](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.x.viii-p6.1"></span>), we have allowed these indulgences for them
only, and not (as has been said above) for future times, lest the good
which had been planted so far with a weak root should be rooted up, but
that what had been begun should rather <span id="page_110">p. 110</span>
<span id="ii.x.viii-Page_110"></span>be made firm, and guarded till it
reach perfection.  Certainly, if in these things we have done anything
otherwise than as we ought to have done, know that it has been done, not
of wantonness, but in commiseration.  Wherefore, too, I invoke God as my
witness, who knows the thoughts of all men, and to whom all things are
naked and open.  For, if I were to destroy what those who came before me
established, I should be justly convicted of being not a builder but an
over-thrower, as testifies the voice of the Truth, who says, *Every
kingdom divided against itself shall not stand* ([Luke xi.
17](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#017)<span id="ii.x.viii-p6.2"></span>.md);
and every science and law divided against itself shall be destroyed. 
And so it is needful for us all with one accord to hold to the
appointments of our holy Fathers, doing nothing in contention, but,
unanimous in every aim of good devotion, to obey, the Lord helping us,
the divine and apostolical constitutions.

<span id="ii.x.viii-p7"></span>O how good is charity, which through love
exhibits absent things in an image to one’s self as though they were
present, unites things divided, sets in order things confused,
associates things unequal, consummates things imperfect!  How rightly
the excellent preacher calls it the bond of perfectness, since the other
virtues indeed produce perfectness, but yet charity so binds them that
they cannot now be unloosed from the mind of him that loves.  This being
duly considered, in what has been already spoken of I indulged
charitably; nor did I give a command, but advice; nor did I deliver a
rule to be held to by any who should come after, but shewed of two
dangers which might be more easily avoided.  If, then, in secular
affairs every one should have his own right and his proper rank
preserved to him, how much more in ecclesiastical arrangements ought no
confusion to be induced, lest discord should find place there whence the
blessings of peace ought to proceed.  And this will be thus secured, if
nothing is yielded to power, but all to equity.  On this account our
heart rejoices greatly with your greatness, because we find you so
earnest in your doings as to have a care for us, and at pains to enquire
about such things by questioning us, to the end that such things may
acquire for you not only glory with men, but also rewards of recompense
with the Almighty Lord.

<span id="ii.x.viii-p8"></span>But with regard to vexation of bishops,
about which you wish to consult us, we know that the life of prelates
ought to be perturbed by no excesses, since it is very unfit that those
who are called thrones of God should be disturbed by any motion from
kings or subjects.  For, if David who was the most righteous of kings
presumed not to lay his hand on Saul who was evidently already rejected
of God, how much more should heed be taken that none lay the hand of
detraction or vituperation or indiscreetness or dishonour on the Lord’s
Anointed, or on the preachers of holy Church, since vexation or
detraction of them touches Christ, in whose stead they fill the office
of legates in the Church!  Hence all the faithful should be exceedingly
cautious not either secretly or publicly, by detractions or
vituperations rend their bishop, that is, the Lord’s Anointed,
considering that example of Mary \[i.e. *Miriam*\], who for speaking
against Moses the servant of God because of the Ethiopian woman was
punished with the uncleanness of leprosy ([Num.
xiii](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#000.md)<span
id="ii.x.viii-p8.1"></span>.); and that of the Psalmist, *Touch not mine
anointed, and do my prophets no harm* ([Psa.
105.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.x.viii-p8.2"></span>) <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md) . 
And in the divine law we read, *Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor
curse the ruler of thy people* ([Ex. xxii.
28](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#028)<span id="ii.x.viii-p9.2"></span>.md). 
Hence great care should be taken by subordinates, whether clerical or
lay, that they dare not to blame rashly the lives of their bishops or
superiors, if perchance they see them do anything blameable, lest from
their position of reproving evil they be sunk into greater depths
through the impulse of elation.  They are to be admonished also that,
when they consider the faults of their superiors, they grow not too bold
against them.  But let them so consider with themselves the things that
are bad that, constrained by divine fear, they refuse not to carry the
yoke of reverence, seeing that the things done by bishops and superiors
are not to be smitten with the sword of the mouth, even when they may
seem to be such as may be properly blamed; since we are aware that it
has been laid down by our predecessors and by many other holy bishops
that sheep should not readily blame their shepherds, or presume to
criminate or accuse them, because, when we sin against our superiors, we
go against His ordinance Who gave them to us.  Hence Moses, when he had
learnt that the people complained against himself and Aaron, said, *For
what are we?  Not against us is your murmuring but against God* ([Ex.
xvi. 8](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.x.viii-p9.3"></span>).  Wherefore subordinates of either order
are to be admonished that, when they observe the deeds of their masters,
they return to their own heart, and presume not in upbraidings of them,
since *The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his
lord* ([Matth. x. 24](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#024.md)<span
id="ii.x.viii-p9.4"></span>).

<span id="ii.x.viii-p10"></span>Concerning doubt as to the dedications
of churches, about which among other things you have wished to consult
us, you ought duly to hold to this which we have received as handed
<span id="page_111">p. 111</span> <span
id="ii.x.viii-Page_111"></span>down to us from those who have gone
before us; namely, that, as often as doubt is entertained as to the
baptism or confirmation of any persons, as well as the consecration of
churches, and there is no certain account to be given, either from
writings or witnesses, as to whether persons have been baptized or
confirmed, or whether churches have been consecrated, that such persons
should be baptized and confirmed, and that such churches should be
canonically dedicated, lest such doubt should become ruin to the
faithful; inasmuch as what does not appear by certain proofs to have
been duly done is not in such case done a second time.  This, divine
grace supporting us, we desire so to hold; and we enjoin it on you, as
you have requested, to hold and teach; and we wish not wantonly to break
through, but faithfully to observe, what has been determined by holy
Fathers before us.  Wherefore we implore the mercy of our Redeemer to
assist you with His grace, and give unto you to carry into effect what
He has granted you to will, since in this matter the good gifts of
retribution by so much the more accrue to us as the zeal of labour is
increased.  But we decree that every one of those who have been
faithfully taught, and already stand ineradicably planted with a firm
root, shall observe his descent even to the seventh generation.  And as
long as they know themselves to be related to each other by affinity,
let them not presume to approach the association of this union; nor is
it lawful, or shall be lawfully for any Christian to marry a woman of
his own kindred whom he has lived with as a wife, or whom he has stained
by any unlawful pollution; since such intercourse is incestuous and
abominable to God and to all good men.  But we read that it has long
been determined by holy Fathers that incestuous persons are not to be
reckoned under any title of wedlock.  And so we desire not to be blamed
by you or any other of the faithful in this matter, seeing that in our
indulgence herein to the nation of the Angli we have acted, not as
laying down a rule, but as taking thought lest they should leave
imperfect the good which they had begun, &c. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_245"></span>[109:246](2130158.htm#fr_245.md) <span
id="ii.x.viii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.x.viii-p4"></span> The genuineness of this epistle is, to
say the least, open to grave suspicion.  Jaffé (*Regesta Pont. Lit.
Spur*.) rejects it as spurious.  Its style in some parts reminds us of
Gregory, and it contains passages identical with what he had written
elsewhere:  but its prolixity, bad composition, and repetitions are
unworthy of his pen.  It reads like an unskilful imitation of his
style.  Nor is it difficult to understand why such a letter may have
been forged.  If, as supposed in our note to Ep. XVI., a letter from
Sicily had been addressed to Gregory not long before his death with
reference to his answers to Augustine’s questions, to which letter he
had been unable to reply, it was not unlikely that such a letter as the
one before us would afterwards be composed in his name.  For anxiety
might naturally be felt to vindicate from inconsistency the teaching of
the Roman See on the subject of marriages of consanguinity.  Such a
letter, too, if forged, would be likely to attempt an imitation of
Gregory’s style, and to bring in (as this does) extracts from his
previous writings.  It may be observed that the plea set forth of the
directions to Augustine having been meant only as temporary concessions
is not borne out by the actual language of those directions.  See XI.
64.
