<span id="ii.ix.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.ix.xviii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XLI.</span>

<span id="ii.ix.xviii-p2"></span>To Eulogius, Patriarch of Alexandria.

<span id="ii.ix.xviii-p3"></span>Gregory to Eulogius, Bishop of
Alexandria.

<span id="ii.ix.xviii-p4"></span>A conversation having arisen one day
between me and my familiar friends about the customs of churches, one
who had studied the art of medicine in the great city of Alexandria told
us that he had a fellow-student attending the same lectures, a boy of
extreme depravity, who, he said, had been suddenly ordained a deacon. 
And he added that he had procured ordination by bribes and gifts; for he
acknowledged that this custom had prevailed in the holy Alexandrine
Church.  On hearing this I was amazed, and exceedingly surprised that
the tongue of the most holy and blessed man the lord Eulogius, which
recalls so many heretics to the catholic faith, has not extirpated
simoniacal heresy from the holy Alexandrine Church.  And who will there
be whose exhortation or correction will be able to amend this, if his
great and admirable teaching shall have left it without amendment?

<span id="ii.ix.xviii-p5"></span>Wherefore, for the absolution of your
soul, for the increase of your reward, that your works may be in all
respects perfect before the eyes of the tremendous Judge, you ought to
make haste utterly to pull up and eradicate simoniacal <span
id="page_102">p. 102</span> <span
id="ii.ix.xviii-Page_102"></span>heresy, which was the first to arise in
the Church, from your most holy See, which is ours <span
id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226) .

<span id="ii.ix.xviii-p7"></span>For on this account it comes to pass
that the holiness of ecclesiastical orders falls away from very many,
because persons are promoted to these orders, not for their life and
deeds, but for bribes.  But if meritorious character, and not bribes, be
sought after, unworthy persons will not come to ordination.  And by so
much the more will reward begin to accrue to you as any good men who
have been promoted to sacred orders shall have devoted themselves to the
care of winning souls.
