<span id="iii.iv.xxxiv-p2"></span>1. Hear, O Freedom, the dispute of two
servants:  how they are convicted by each other, that they are
powerless.—2. *R., To Thee be glory by Whose humiliation Adam was
exalted:  and by Whose death he was raised, and regained Eden!*—3. If
then the Evil One overcome thee, great is the shame:  Death his comrade
has convicted him, as being weak.—4. And if again Death subdue thee, lo!
what reproach:  for the Evil One his comrade derides him, as but a
shadow.—5. Their dispute is for thee a mirror, wherein thou mayest see: 
that they both are but as chaff, before thy breath.—6. Yea and Prophets
and Apostles, in their promises:  assure thee that they like flowers,
shall fade at the rising.—7. *S*., Thou, Death, art he whom they hate,
the quick and dead:  for every combination thou dissolvest, and
destroyest.—8. *D*., It is not open death that kills, O Satan:  thy
death which is secret kills the sons of men.—9. *S*., My name is not
hateful as thine, for the angel:  showed himself in Satan’s likeness to
Balaam on the way.—10. *D*., How fit is this thy name, O Satan:  who
hast erred and made unwary Adam err, from the way!—11. *S*., Wander not
like one ignorant, and lose thy cause:  dispute, O Death, if thou are
competent, for replying.—12.*D*., I know that thou art wily, O Satan: 
so that thou out of sand canst twist a snare.—13. *S*., Thy disputing,
Death, is ended:  for he who is worsted:  when his words fail and are
ended, begins to rail.—14. *D*., Among all I am conqueror, and by thee
am I worsted?  Let Adam persuade thee whom I have overcome, O Satan!—15.
*S*., I am he who bound Adam, and cast him before thee:  the mighty man
whom my wiles had bound, thou didst come and subdue.—16. *D*., I am he
who have been crowned anew, with a diadem in the world:  for Adam, chief
of the mighty, I hold captive in Sheol.—17. *S*., I killed him by secret
death, even Adam when he sinned:  thou, Death, hast slain one that was
dead, killed by me.—18. *D*., In thy desire to conquer, Evil One, thou
hast made thyself hated:  for thou art Death as well as Satan, and this
*seems* a little thing to thee.—19. *S*., Thou hast then been silenced,
Death, as a weakling:  for neither in words nor in deeds, hast thou
strength to stand.—20. *D*., It is for thy evil thou conquerest, O Evil
One, if thou discernest:  thy crown is wholly of shame, if thou
perceivest.—21. I shall be defeated and thou shalt be cursed, O Satan: 
it is well for me to be ignorant, and not mischievous.—22. Blessed be
the Just One who divided them, though they were quite of one mind: 
Blessed be the Good One who made us of one mind, when we were
divided.—23. I will overcome the Evil One through Thy forgiveness, O
All-Merciful:  and I shall overcome death through Thy Resurrection, O
All-Life-giver!
