<span id="iii.iii.ii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.iii.ii.vi-p1.1"></span>VI.—Rectification of the Vatican Text of
the Life.</span>

<span id="iii.iii.ii.vi-p2"></span>If the *Life* had reached us in its
Vatican form only, it would have been necessary to correct one or two
farther errors:

<span id="iii.iii.ii.vi-p3"></span>1. *Date of his Baptism
Mistaken*.—According to the Vatican *Life*, Ephraim was baptized at the
age of 28, after the surrender of Nisibis by Jovian.  The surrender was
in 363, and the age assigned to him would therefore make 334 the
earliest admissible date for his birth—ten years after the Council of
Nicæa, at which the *Life* records that he was present!  The Parisian
*Life* corrects this absurdity and shows how the mistake arose.  The
statement, in this version of the story, is that after quitting Nisibis,
“he retired to Beth-Garbaia, where he *had* received baptism at the age
of 18.”  By omitting the auxiliary “had” (which in Syriac, as in
English, expresses the pluperfect) the Vatican scribe or editor
introduces this blunder about the date of the baptism.  It is probable
that, without having any distinct knowledge of the date of the departure
from Nisibis, he felt that Ephraim must have been more than 18 at this
stage of the narrative, and strove to make the age cohere better with
the time required for the events related, by changing 18 into 28.

<span id="iii.iii.ii.vi-p4"></span>2.  *Julian substituted for
Valens*.—The substitution of the name of Julian for that of Valens as
the persecutor of Edessa, has been already noticed.  That the story
(with the incident of the martyr-mother with her two sons) belongs to
the time of Valens, is established by the united testimony of Socrates,
Sozomen, and Theodoret.  The whole history is clear, and coherent with
itself and with chronology, in the Parisian *Life*; whereas the Vatican
version of it, by bringing Ephraim to Edessa in the reign of Julian,
makes hopeless confusion. <span id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295.md)   It
is to be noted that the names *Julianus* and *Valens*, so distinct as
written in Latin, differ but little when transliterated (without
vowel-points) into Syriac.

<span id="iii.iii.ii.vi-p5"></span> It is to be regretted that neither
the Parisian *Life*, nor the *Nisibene* Hymns, was before the writer of
the article <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii.ii.vi-p5.1"></span>Ephraim</span> in Smith and Wace’s
*Dictionary of Christian Biography*.  The former would have warned him
from being misled by the Vatican *Life* into the error of ascribing to
Julian the persecution under Valens; the latter would have shown him
that both versions of the *Life* confuse the first siege of Nisibis with
the third.
