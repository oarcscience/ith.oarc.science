<span id="iii.ix.ix-p1"></span> *<span class="c1"><span
id="iii.ix.ix-p1.1"></span>Demonstration XXI.</span>*<span
class="c1"><span id="iii.ix.ix-p1.2"></span>—<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ix.ix-p1.3"></span>Of</span> Persecution.</span>

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p2"></span>1.  I have heard a reproach, which has
greatly vexed me.  The unclean (the heathen) say, that this people,
which is gathered together out of all nations, has no God.  And thus say
the impious:—“If they have a God, why does He not avenge His people?” 
And darkness more exceedingly has thickened upon me, because the Jews
also reproach us, and magnify themselves over the children of our
people.  It happened one day, that a man, who is called wise amongst the
Jews, questioned me, saying:—Jesus, Who is called your Teacher, wrote
for you, that *If there shall be in you faith like one grain of mustard,
ye shall say to this mountain, Remove, and it shall remove from before
you; and (ye shall say) even, Be lifted up and fall into the sea, and it
shall obey you*. <span id="fr_1087"></span>[1088](#fn_1087.md)   So
apparently there is in all your people not one wise man, whose prayer is
heard, and who asks of God that your persecutors should cease from you. 
For clearly it is written for you in that passage, *There is nothing
which ye shall not be able to do.*

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p4"></span>2.  And when I saw that he was
blaspheming and speaking much against the Way (the Christian religion),
my mind was disturbed, and I understood that he would not admit the
interpretation of the words that he quoted to me.  Then I also
questioned him on sayings from the Law and from the Prophets, and said
to him:—Do ye trust that even when ye are dispersed God is with you? 
And he professed to me, “God is with us, because that God said unto
Israel:—*Even in the lands of their enemies, I yet did not forsake them,
nor did I make void My covenant with them.*” <span
id="fr_1088"></span>[1089](#fn_1088.md)   In answer I said to him:—“Right
good is this that I have heard from thee, that God is with you.  Against
thy words will I also speak unto thee.  For I said the Prophet said unto
Israel, as from the mouth of God:—*If thou shalt pass through the sea, I
will be with thee, and the rivers shall not overflow thee; and if thou
shalt walk upon fire, thou shalt not be burned, and the flame shall not
search thee; because the Lord thy God is with thee*. <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[1090](#fn_1089.md)   Thus there is not one righteous
and good and wise man out of all your people, who could pass through the
sea and live and not be drowned; or (through) the river without its
overflowing him; or who could walk over fire and see whether he would
not be scorched and whether the flame would not burn him.  And if thou
shalt bring to me an explanation, I will not be persuaded by thee, just
as thou also dost not accept from me the interpretation of the words as
to which thou hast questioned me.”

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p7"></span>3.  Furthermore I questioned him about
another saying that is written in Ezekiel; namely, that he said to
Jerusalem:—*Sodom* <span id="page_393">p. 393</span> <span
id="iii.ix.ix-Page_393"></span>*and her daughters shall be built up as
of old, and thou and thy daughters shall become as of old*. <span
id="fr_1090"></span>[1091](#fn_1090.md)   So he explained this saying to
me, and began to make a defence, and said to me “As to this that God
said to Jerusalem by the Prophet, *Sodom and her daughters shall be
built up as of old, and thou and thy daughters shall become as of old;*
this is the force of the passage, that Sodom and her daughters shall be
in their place as of old, and shall be made subject to Israel; and
Jerusalem and her daughters shall be in the splendour of royalty as of
old.”  When I heard this defence from him, it was very contemptible in
my eyes, and I said to him:—“Inasmuch as the words of the Prophet were
said in wrath, is the whole passage wrathful, or is part of it wrathful
and part of it gracious?”  He answered:—“A wrathful passage is
altogether wrath, and there is no peace in it.”  And I said to
him:—“Since thou hast instructed me that there is no peace in that
wrathful passage, hear without contention and blaspheme not, and I will
instruct thee about this saying.  For from the top to the bottom the
whole passage is said in wrath.  For he said to Jerusalem:—*As I live,
saith the Lord God, Sodom and her daughters did not do at all as thou
and they daughters have done*. <span
id="fr_1091"></span>[1092](#fn_1091.md)   And he said to her
(Jerusalem):—*Be abashed and accept thy shame, that thou hast overcome
thy sisters in thy sins, and they are justified rather than thou*. <span
id="fr_1092"></span>[1093](#fn_1092.md)   Since he says that Sodom and her
daughters were justified rather than Jerusalem and her daughters, and
that Jerusalem overcame Sodom in her sins, it is right that when Israel
shall be gathered together, its seat should be in Sodom and Gomorrha. 
For *their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the planting of
Gomorrha.  Their grapes are bitter and their clusters gall unto
them.* <span id="fr_1093"></span>[1094](#fn_1093.md)   And Isaiah also
calls them *rulers of Sodom, and people of Gomorrha*. <span
id="fr_1094"></span>[1095](#fn_1094.md)   For if Israel is gathered
together, in Sodom and Gomorrha ought they to dwell with the rulers of
Sodom and with the people of Gomorrha; and on the vine of Sodom and
planting of Gomorrha to eat bitter grapes and gather clusters of gall;
and to eat the eggs of the basilisk and to clothe themselves with
spiders’ webs, <span id="fr_1095"></span>[1096](#fn_1095.md) to be used
with *wild grapes of the vineyard*, <span
id="fr_1096"></span>[1097](#fn_1096.md) and to be turned into *reprobate
silver*. <span id="fr_1097"></span>[1098](#fn_1097.md)   And Sodom and her
daughters, who were justified rather than Jerusalem, shall be built up
as of old.  And Jerusalem, that surpassed Sodom in her sins, shall
continue in her sins, *and shall remain in desolation until the
accomplishment of the things determined for ever.* <span
id="fr_1098"></span>[1099](#fn_1098.md)

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p17"></span>4.  And Ezekiel said:—*This is the
iniquity of Sodom and of her daughters, that they did not take by the
hand the poor and needy; and when I saw these things in them, I
overthrew them*. <span id="fr_1099"></span>[1100](#fn_1099.md)   And
consider and see that, from the time that Sodom was overthrown until
Jerusalem was built, there were eight hundred and ninety-six years. 
From the time that Abraham was informed by God through the Angel that
*at this time next year I will return to thee, and Sarah thy wife shall
have a son*, <span id="fr_1100"></span>[1101](#fn_1100.md) from that time
till Jacob entered Egypt was a hundred and ninety-one years:  and the
children of Jacob were in Egypt two hundred and twenty-five years.  So
all the years from the time that Isaac was conceived and Sodom
overthrown were four hundred and sixteen years, and from the Exodus of
Israel from Egypt till the great edifice of Jerusalem was built up by
Solomon, and the temple was built, there were four hundred and eighty
years.  Therefore all the years from the conception of Isaac and the
overthrow of Sodom till the great building of Jerusalem, were eight
hundred and ninety-six years.  And from the great building of Jerusalem
until the destruction of Jerusalem there were four hundred and
twenty-five years.  The sum of all the years from the time of the
overthrow of Sodom until Jerusalem was laid waste, was one thousand
three hundred and twenty-one.  These are all the years that <span
id="page_394">p. 394</span> <span id="iii.ix.ix-Page_394"></span>Sodom
and her daughters were laid waste before Jerusalem.  And she that was
more just than Jerusalem is not yet inhabited.  Therefore the whole sum
of the years from the overthrow of Sodom till the six hundred and
fifty-fifth year of the Kingdom of Alexander, the son of Philip of
Macedon, <span id="fr_1101"></span>[1102](#fn_1101.md) is two thousand two
hundred and seventy-six years.  And from the time that Jerusalem was
laid waste by the Babylonians until the present time is nine hundred and
fifty-five years.  And Jerusalem has been inhabited, after the
Babylonians laid it waste, during those seventy weeks about which Daniel
testified.  Then it was laid waste in its last destruction by the
Romans, and it shall not be inhabited again for ever, for *it abideth in
desolation until the accomplishment of the things determined*. <span
id="fr_1102"></span>[1103](#fn_1102.md)   So then, all the years of the
former and latter desolation of Jerusalem have been four hundred and
sixty-five years, and when thou dost deduct from them the seventy years
of Babylon, they have been three hundred and ninety-five years.

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p22"></span>5.  All this argument have I written to
thee, because the Jews pride themselves, (saying), “It has been
covenanted to us, that we shall be gathered.”  For if Sodom, whose
iniquity was not so great as that of Jerusalem, is not as yet inhabited,
and if we say thus, that it will not be restored for ever, how shall
Jerusalem be restored, whose iniquity is greater than that of Sodom and
her daughters?  As for Sodom God has not had mercy on her for two
thousand two hundred and seventy-six years; and shall we say that He
will have mercy on Jerusalem?  For up to the present there are but three
hundred and ninety-five years from the day that she was laid waste,
according to the calculation that has been written above.  But as to
this that he said, *Sodom and her daughters shall be possessed as of
old*, <span id="fr_1103"></span>[1104](#fn_1103.md) and with regard to
Jerusalem he said, *Thou and thy daughters shall become as of old*, this
is the force of the passage; that they shall not be inhabited for ever;
for the Lord also thus cursed the land against which He was wroth:—*It
shall not be sown, nor shall it produce, nor shall any herb spring up in
it, but it shall be like Sodom and Gomorrha, against which the Lord was
wroth and towards which He was not appeased*. <span
id="fr_1104"></span>[1105](#fn_1104.md)   Therefore be sure, my hearer,
that Sodom and her daughters shall not be inhabited for ever; but they
shall be as of old, namely, as in that time when they were not as yet
inhabited, and as in the time when the Lord was wroth with them and was
not appeased towards them.  And Jerusalem and her daughters shall be as
of old, (that is) as in the former time when the mountain of the
Amorites lay in desolation, whereon Abraham built the altar, when he
bound upon it Isaac his son; and as it was desolate when David bought
the threshing-floor from Araunah the Jebusite, and built there the
altar.  For consider and see that this mountain whereon Abraham offered
his son is the mountain of Jebus, which is Jerusalem.  And this place of
the threshing-floor that David bought of Araunah is that whereon the
Temple was built.  Thus Jerusalem shall be in desolation as of old.  And
consider that when Ezekiel prophesied this passage, Jerusalem still was
sitting in her greatness, and those who were in her were rebelling
against the King of Babylon.  And that which the Prophet spoke, he said
in wrath and reproach against Jerusalem.

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p25"></span>6.  Consider and observe, my hearer,
that if God had given a hope to Sodom and to her fellows, He would not
have overthrown them with fire and brimstone, the sign of the last day
of the world, but would have delivered them over to one of the kingdoms
to be chastised.  As it is written that when Jeremiah caused the nations
and kingdoms to drink the cup of wrath, he said concerning each one of
the cities, that after they shall *drink the cup, I will turn back the*
<span id="page_395">p. 395</span> <span
id="iii.ix.ix-Page_395"></span>*captivity of Elam, of Tyre, of Zidon, of
the children of Ammon, and of Moab*, and *of Edom*. <span
id="fr_1105"></span>[1106](#fn_1105.md)   Concerning each one of these
kingdoms he said:—*In the last days I well turn back her captivity.* 
Now we see that Tyre was inhabited, and was opulent after she had
*wandered seventy years*, <span id="fr_1106"></span>[1107](#fn_1106.md) and
after she had received the reward of her harlotries and after she had
*committed fornication with all kingdoms. * And *she took the harp, and
played it sweetly, and multiplied her music.*  And also the region of
Elam is inhabited and opulent.  And with regard to Babylon Jeremiah
said:—*Babylon shall fall, and shall not rise*. <span
id="fr_1107"></span>[1108](#fn_1107.md)   And lo! unto this day does it
continue in desolation, and will do so for ever.  And also about
Jerusalem he said:—*The virgin of Israel shall fall, and shall not rise
again.  She is forsaken upon the ground and there is none to raise her
up*. <span id="fr_1108"></span>[1109](#fn_1108.md)   For if the prophecy is
true which Jeremiah spoke about Babylon, also that about Jerusalem is
true and worthy of faith.  And Isaiah said unto Jerusalem:—*I will not
again be wroth with thee, nor will I reprove thee*. <span
id="fr_1109"></span>[1110](#fn_1109.md)   Of a truth He will not again be
wroth with her, nor will He reprove her for ever; for that which is in
desolation He will not reprove, nor will she provoke him to wrath.

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p31"></span>7.  As to those that reproach us
(saying):—“Ye are persecuted and are not delivered,” let them be ashamed
themselves, that at every time they have been persecuted, even for many
years before they were delivered.  They were made to serve in Egypt two
hundred and twenty-five years.  And the Midianites <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[1111](#fn_1110.md) made Israel serve in the days of
Barak and Deborah. <span id="fr_1111"></span>[1112](#fn_1111.md)   The
Moabites ruled over them in the days of Ehud; <span
id="fr_1112"></span>[1113](#fn_1112.md) the Ammonites in the days of
Jephthah; <span id="fr_1113"></span>[1114](#fn_1113.md) the Philistines in
the days of Samson, <span id="fr_1114"></span>[1115](#fn_1114.md) and also
in the days of Eli and of Samuel the Prophet; <span
id="fr_1115"></span>[1116](#fn_1115.md) the Edomites in the days of Ahab;
the Assyrians in the days of Hezekiah. <span
id="fr_1116"></span>[1117](#fn_1116.md)   The king of Babylon uprooted them
from their place and dispersed them; <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[1118](#fn_1117.md) and after he had tried and
persecuted them much, they did not amend, as He said to them:—*In vain
have I smitten your sons, for they did not accept chastisement*. <span
id="fr_1118"></span>[1119](#fn_1118.md)   And again He said:—*I have cut
off the Prophets, and slain them by the word of My mouth.* <span
id="fr_1119"></span>[1120](#fn_1119.md)   And to Jerusalem He said:—*By
afflictions and scourges be instructed, O Jerusalem, lest thy life
depart from thee*. <span id="fr_1120"></span>[1121](#fn_1120.md)   But they
forsook Him, and worshipped idols, as Jeremiah said concerning
them: <span id="fr_1121"></span>[1122](#fn_1121.md) —*Go to the distant
isles, and send to Kedar, and consider well and see, whether there has
been (anything) like this, whether the nations change their gods, those
that are no gods.  But My people has changed My honour for that which is
not profitable.  Be astonished, ye heavens, at this; and quake and fear
greatly, saith the Lord; because My people have done two wickednesses;
they have abandoned Me, the fountain of the water of life, and they have
gone and dug for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns which cannot hold
water.*  For the broken cisterns are the fear of images and idols.  And
He calls the heavens to astonishment, because they worshipped the hosts
of the heavens.  And the heavens shall receive as a penalty, that *they
shall be rolled up as a scroll, and all the host of them shall fall
down.* <span id="fr_1122"></span>[1123](#fn_1122.md)

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p45"></span>8.  All this discourse that I have
written unto thee, my beloved, from the beginning, was because the Jew
reproached the children of our people; but now, as far as I can
comprehend, I will instruct thee about the persecuted, that they have
received a great reward, while the persecutors have come to scorn and
contempt.

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p46"></span>9.  Jacob was persecuted, and Esau was a
persecutor.  Jacob received the blessings and the birthright, while Esau
was cast out from both.  Joseph was persecuted, and his brothers were
persecutors; Joseph was exalted and his persecutors bowed down <span
id="page_396">p. 396</span> <span id="iii.ix.ix-Page_396"></span>before
him, and so his dreams and his visions were fulfilled.  Joseph who was
persecuted was a type of the persecuted Jesus.  His father clothed
Joseph in a tunic of divers colours; and His Father clothed Jesus with a
body (taken) from the Virgin.  His father loved Joseph more than his
brethren, and Jesus is the dear and beloved one of His Father.  Joseph
saw visions and dreamed dreams; Jesus fulfilled the visions and the
Prophets.  Joseph was a shepherd with his brethren; and Jesus is the
Chief of Shepherds.  When his father sent Joseph to visit his brethren,
they saw him coming and plotted to kill him; and when His Father sent
Jesus to visit His brethren, they said:—*This is the heir; come, let us
kill him*. <span id="fr_1123"></span>[1124](#fn_1123.md)   His brethren
cast Joseph into the pit; and His brethren brought down Jesus into the
abode of the dead.  Joseph ascended from the pit and Jesus arose from
the abode of the dead.  Joseph, after he arose from the pit, had
authority over his brethren; and after Jesus arose from the abode of the
dead, His Father gave Him a great and excellent name, <span
id="fr_1124"></span>[1125](#fn_1124.md) that His brethren should serve Him,
and His enemies be put beneath His feet.  After that Joseph was made
known to his brethren, they were abashed and feared and were amazed at
his greatness; and when Jesus shall come at the last time, when He shall
be revealed in His Majesty, His brethren will be abashed and fear and be
dismayed before Him, because they crucified Him.  Moreover, Joseph, by
the counsel of Judah, was sold into Egypt; and Jesus, by the hands of
Judas Iscariot, was delivered over to the Jews.  When they sold Joseph,
he answered nothing to his brethren; Jesus also spake not and gave no
answer to the judges who judged Him.  His master wrongfully delivered
over Joseph to the prison; and His countrymen wrongfully condemned
Jesus.  Joseph delivered over his two garments, one into the hand of his
brethren, and the other into the hand of his master’s wife; and Jesus
delivered over His garments and divided them between the soldiers. 
Joseph, when thirty years old, stood before Pharaoh and became lord of
Egypt; and Jesus, when about thirty years old, came to the Jordan to be
baptized, and received the spirit, and went forth to preach.  Joseph
nourished Egypt with bread; and Jesus nourished the whole world with the
bread of life.  Joseph took to wife the daughter of the wicked and
unclean priest; and Jesus espoused to Himself the Church (taken) from
the unclean Gentiles.  Joseph died and was buried in Egypt; and Jesus
died and was buried in Jerusalem.  Joseph’s bones his brethren brought
up from Egypt; and Jesus His Father raised from the abode of the dead,
and took up His Body with Him to heaven uncorrupted.

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p49"></span>10.  Moses also was persecuted, as Jesus
was persecuted.  When Moses was born, they concealed him that he might
not be slain by his persecutors.  When Jesus was born they carried Him
off in flight into Egypt that Herod, His persecutor, might not slay
Him.  In the days when Moses was born, children used to be drowned in
the river; and at the birth of Jesus the children of Bethlehem and in
its borders were slain.  To Moses God said:—*The men are dead who were
seeking thy life*; <span id="fr_1125"></span>[1126](#fn_1125.md) and to
Joseph the angel said in Egypt:—*Arise, take up the child, and go into
the land of Israel, for they are dead who were seeking the life of the
child to take it away*. <span id="fr_1126"></span>[1127](#fn_1126.md)  
Moses brought out his people from the service of Pharaoh; and Jesus
delivered all nations from the service of Satan.  Moses grew up in
Pharaoh’s house; and Jesus grew up in Egypt when Joseph brought Him
there in flight.  Miriam <span id="fr_1127"></span>[1128](#fn_1127.md)
stood on the edge of the river when Moses was floating in the water; and
Mary bare Jesus, after the Angel Gabriel had made the annunciation to
her.  When Moses sacrificed the lamb, the firstborn of Egypt were slain;
and when they crucified Jesus the true <span id="page_397">p. 397</span>
<span id="iii.ix.ix-Page_397"></span>Lamb, the people who slew Him
perished through His slaying.  Moses brought down manna for his people;
and Jesus gave His Body to the nations.  Moses sweetened the bitter
waters by the wood; and Jesus sweetened our bitterness by His cross, by
the wood of the tree of His crucifixion.  Moses brought down the Law to
his people; and Jesus gave His covenants to the nations.  Moses
conquered Amalek by the spreading out of his hands; and Jesus conquered
Satan by the sign of His cross.  Moses brought out water from the rock
for his people; and Jesus sent Simon Cephas (the rock) to carry His
doctrine among the nations.  Moses lifted up the veil from his face and
spake with God; and Jesus lifted up the veil from the face of the
nations, that they might hear and receive His doctrine.  Moses laid his
hand upon his messengers (apostles), and they received priesthood; and
Jesus laid His hand upon His apostles, and they received the Holy
Spirit.  Moses ascended the mountain and died there; and Jesus ascended
into heaven and took his seat at the right hand of His Father.

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p53"></span>11.  Also Joshua the son of Nun was
persecuted as Jesus our Redeemer was persecuted.  Joshua the son of Nun
was persecuted by the unclean nations; and Jesus our Redeemer was
persecuted by the foolish people.  Joshua the son of Nun took away the
inheritance from his persecutors and gave it to his people; and Jesus
our Redeemer took away the inheritance from His persecutors and gave it
to strange nations.  Joshua the son of Nun caused the sun to stand still
in the heavens, and took vengeance on the nations his persecutors; and
Jesus our Redeemer caused the sun to set in the midst of the day, that
the persecuting people which crucified Him might be ashamed.  Joshua the
son of Nun divided the inheritance unto his people; and Jesus our
Redeemer has promised to give to the nations the land of life.  Joshua
the son of Nun caused Rahab the harlot to live; and Jesus our Redeemer
gathered together and gave life to the Church, though polluted by the
harlotry (of idolatry).  Joshua the son of Nun on the seventh day
overthrew and cast down the walls of Jericho; and Jesus our Redeemer, on
His seventh day, on the Sabbath of the rest of God, this world shall be
dissolved and fall.  Joshua the son of Nun stoned Achor, because he
stole of the accursed thing; and Jesus our Redeemer separated Judas from
the disciples, His friends, because he stole of the money of the poor. 
Joshua the son of Nun, when he was dying, laid down a testimony among
his people; and Jesus our Redeemer, when He was taken up, laid down a
testimony among His apostles.

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p54"></span>12.  Also Jephthah was persecuted, as
Jesus was persecuted.  Jephthah, his brethren drove out from the house
of his father; and Jesus, His brethren drove out and lifted up and
crucified.  Jephthah though persecuted arose as leader to his people;
Jesus though persecuted arose and became King of the Nations.  Jephthah
vowed a vow and offered up his firstborn daughter as a sacrifice; and
Jesus was lifted up as a sacrifice to his Father for all the Gentiles.

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p55"></span>13.  Also David was persecuted, as Jesus
was persecuted.  David was anointed by Samuel to be king instead of Saul
who had sinned; and Jesus was anointed by John to be High Priest instead
of the priests, the ministers of the Law.  David was persecuted after
his anointing; and Jesus was persecuted after His anointing.  David
reigned first over one tribe only, and afterwards over all Israel; and
Jesus reigned from the beginning over the few who believed on Him, and
in the end He will reign over all the world.  Samuel anointed David when
he was thirty years old; and Jesus when about thirty years old received
the imposition of the hand from John.  David wedded two daughters of the
king; and Jesus wedded two daughters of kings, the congregation of the
People and the congregation of the Gentiles.  David repaid good to Saul
his enemy; and Jesus taught, <span id="page_398">p. 398</span> <span
id="iii.ix.ix-Page_398"></span>*Pray for your enemies*. <span
id="fr_1128"></span>[1129](#fn_1128.md)   David was the heart of God; <span
id="fr_1129"></span>[1130](#fn_1129.md) and Jesus was the Son of God. 
David received the kingdom of Saul his persecutor; and Jesus received
the kingdom of Israel His persecutor.  David wept with dirges over Saul
his enemy when he died; and Jesus wept over Jerusalem, His persecutor,
which was to be laid waste.  David handed over the kingdom to Solomon,
and was gathered to his people; and Jesus handed over the keys to Simon,
and ascended and returned to Him who sent Him.  For David’s sake, sins
were forgiven to his posterity; and for Jesus’ sake sins are forgiven to
the nations. <span id="fr_1130"></span>[1131](#fn_1130.md)

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p59"></span>14.  Elijah also was persecuted as Jesus
was persecuted.  Jezebel the murderess persecuted Elijah; and the
persecuting and murderous congregation persecuted Jesus.  Elijah
restrained the heavens from rain because of the sins of Israel; and
Jesus by His coming restrained the Spirit from the prophets, because of
the sins of the people.  Elijah destroyed the servants of Baal; and
Jesus trampled upon Satan and his hosts.  Elijah raised to life the son
of the widow; and Jesus raised to life the son of the widow, as well as
Lazarus and the daughter of the ruler of the Synagogue.  Elijah
sustained the widow with a little bread; and Jesus satisfied thousands
with a little bread.  Elijah was taken up in a chariot to heaven; and
our Redeemer ascended and took His seat on the right hand of His
Father.  Elisha received the spirit of Elijah; and Jesus breathed upon
the faces of His Apostles.

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p60"></span>15.  Also Elisha was persecuted as Jesus
was persecuted.  Elisha was persecuted by the son of Ahab, the son of
the murderer; and Jesus was persecuted by the murderous people.  Elisha
prophesied, and there came about abundance in Samaria; and Jesus
said:—*Whosoever eateth of My body and drinketh of My blood shall live
for ever.*  Elisha satisfied a hundred men with a little bread; and
Jesus satisfied four thousand men, besides women and children, with five
loaves.  Elisha made oil out of water; and Jesus made wine out of
water.  Elisha delivered the widow from her creditor; and Jesus
delivered the indebted nations.  Elisha made the iron to swim and the
wood to sink; and Jesus raised up that which was sunk in us, and sank
that which was light.  A dead man (laid) upon the bones of Elisha
recovered life; and all the nations, who were dead in their sins, were
cast upon the bones of Jesus and recovered life.

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p61"></span>16.  Hezekiah also was persecuted as
Jesus was persecuted.  Hezekiah was persecuted, and was reproached by
Sennacherib his enemy; Jesus also was reproached by the foolish people. 
Hezekiah prayed and overcame his adversary; and by the crucifixion of
Jesus was our Adversary overcome.  Hezekiah was king of all Israel; and
Jesus is King of all the nations.  Because Hezekiah was sick, the sun
turned backwards; and because Jesus suffered, the sun was darkened from
its light.  The enemies of Hezekiah became dead corpses; and Jesus, His
enemies shall be cast down beneath His feet.  Hezekiah was of the family
of the house of David; and Jesus was, in the flesh, the son of David. 
Hezekiah said:—*Peace and truth shall be in my days*; <span
id="fr_1131"></span>[1132](#fn_1131.md) and Jesus said to His
disciples:—*My peace I leave with you*. <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[1133](#fn_1132.md)   Hezekiah prayed, and was healed
of his sickness; Jesus prayed, and arose from the abode of the dead. 
Hezekiah after he arose from his sickness added to his years; and Jesus
after His Resurrection received great glory.  Hezekiah, after the
prolongation of his life, death was given dominion over him; but Jesus,
after that He rose, death shall not again have dominion over Him for
ever.

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p64"></span>17.  Josiah also was persecuted as Jesus
was persecuted.  Josiah was persecuted, and Pharaoh the Lame <span
id="fr_1133"></span>[1134](#fn_1133.md) slew Him; <span
id="fr_1134"></span>[1135](#fn_1134.md) and Jesus was persecuted, and the
people that were made lame by their sins slew Him.  <span
id="page_399">p. 399</span> <span id="iii.ix.ix-Page_399"></span>Josiah
cleansed the land of Israel from uncleanness; and Jesus cleansed and
caused to pass away uncleanness from all the earth.  Josiah hallowed and
glorified the name of his God; and Jesus said:—*I have glorified and
will glorify (His Name*). <span id="fr_1135"></span>[1136](#fn_1135.md)  
Josiah because of the iniquity of Israel *rent his clothes*; <span
id="fr_1136"></span>[1137](#fn_1136.md) and Jesus because of the iniquity
of the people *rent the vail of the Holy Temple*. <span
id="fr_1137"></span>[1138](#fn_1137.md)   Josiah said:—*Great is the wrath
that shall come upon this people;* and Jesus said:—*There shall come
wrath upon this people, and they shall fall by the edge of the
sword*. <span id="fr_1138"></span>[1139](#fn_1138.md)   Josiah cast out
uncleanness from the Holy Temple; and Jesus cast out the unclean traders
from His Father’s house.  For Josiah the daughters of Israel mourned and
wailed, as Jeremiah said:—*O daughters of Israel, weep for
Josiah*; <span id="fr_1139"></span>[1140](#fn_1139.md) and over Jesus did
the daughters of Israel weep and mourn, as Zechariah said:—*The land
shall mourn, families over families.* <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[1141](#fn_1140.md)

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p73"></span>18.  Daniel also was persecuted as Jesus
was persecuted.  Daniel was persecuted by the Chaldeans, the
congregation of heathen men; Jesus also the Jews, the congregation of
wicked men, persecuted.  Daniel the Chaldeans accused; and Jesus the
Jews accused before the governor.  Daniel they cast into the pit of
lions, and he was delivered and came up out of its midst uninjured; and
Jesus they sent down into the pit of the abode of the dead, and He
ascended, and death had not dominion over him.  Concerning Daniel they
expected that when he had fallen into the pit he would not come up
again; and concerning Jesus they said, *Since He has fallen, He shall
not rise again*. <span id="fr_1141"></span>[1142](#fn_1141.md)   From
(harming) Daniel the mouth of the ravenous and destructive lions was
closed; and from (harming) Jesus was closed the mouth of death, (though)
ravenous and destructive of (living) forms.  They sealed the pit of
Daniel, and guarded it with diligence; and the grave of Jesus did they
guard with diligence, as they said, *Set guards to watch al the
tomb*. <span id="fr_1142"></span>[1143](#fn_1142.md)   When Daniel came up,
his accusers were ashamed; and when Jesus rose, all they who had
crucified Him were ashamed.  The King who judged Daniel was greatly
grieved <span id="fr_1143"></span>[1144](#fn_1143.md) at the wickedness of
his accusers the Chaldeans; and Pilate who judged Jesus was greatly
grieved because he knew that *for malice the Jews were accusing
Him*. <span id="fr_1144"></span>[1145](#fn_1144.md)   At the prayer of
Daniel, the captivity of his people went up from Babylon; and Jesus by
His prayer turned back the captivity of all the nations, Daniel
interpreted the visions and dreams of Nebuchadnezzar; and Jesus
explained and interpreted the visions of the Law and the Prophets.  When
Daniel explained the vision of Belteshazzar, he received authority over
the third part of the kingdom; and when Jesus fulfilled the visions and
the Prophets, His Father delivered unto Him all authority in heaven and
in earth.  Daniel saw wonders and uttered secrets; and Jesus revealed
secrets and fulfilled what is written.  Daniel was led away among the
hostages in behalf of his people; and the body of Jesus was a hostage in
behalf of all nations.  For Daniel’s sake the wrath of the King was
appeased from the Chaldeans, so that they were not slain; and for Jesus’
sake the wrath of His Father was appeased from all nations, so that they
were not slain and died not because of their sins.  Daniel *besought of
the king, and he gave his brethren authority over the affairs of the
province of Babylon*; <span id="fr_1145"></span>[1146](#fn_1145.md) and
Jesus besought of God, and He gave His brethren, His disciples,
authority over Satan and his host. <span
id="fr_1146"></span>[1147](#fn_1146.md)   Daniel said concerning Jerusalem,
that until the things determined, she should remain in desolation; and
Jesus said concerning Jerusalem, *There shall not be left in her stone
upon stone, because she knew not the day of her greatness*. <span
id="fr_1147"></span>[1148](#fn_1147.md)   Daniel foresaw the weeks that
should remain over for his people; and Jesus came and fulfilled them.

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p81"></span>19.  Hananiah also and his brethren
<span id="page_400">p. 400</span> <span
id="iii.ix.ix-Page_400"></span>were persecuted as Jesus was persecuted. 
Hananiah and his brethren were persecuted by Nebuchadnezzar; and Jesus,
the people of the Jews persecuted.  Hananiah and his brethren were cast
into the furnace of fire, and it was cold as dew upon the righteous. 
Jesus also descended to the place of darkness, and burst its gates and
brought forth its prisoners.  Hananiah and his brethren came up from the
furnace of fire, and the flame burned their accusers; and Jesus revived
and came up from the midst of darkness, and His accusers and they that
crucified Him shall be burned in flames at the end.  When Hananiah and
his brethren came up from the furnace, Nebuchadnezzar the King trembled
and was amazed; and when Jesus arose from the abode of the dead, the
people that crucified Him were terrified and trembled.  Hananiah and his
brethren worshipped not the image of the King of Babylon; and Jesus
restrained the nations from the worship of dead images.  Because of
Hananiah and his brethren, the *nations and languages glorified God Who
had delivered them from the fire*: <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[1149](#fn_1148.md)   and because of Jesus, the nations
and oil languages shall glorify (God) Who delivered His Son, so that He
saw no corruption.  On the garments of Hananiah and his brethren the
fire had no power; and on the bodies of the righteous, who have believed
in Jesus, the fire shall have no power at the end. <span
id="fr_1149"></span>[1150](#fn_1149.md)

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p84"></span>20.  Mordecai also was persecuted as
Jesus was persecuted.  Mordecai was persecuted by the wicked Haman; and
Jesus was persecuted by the rebellious People.  Mordecai by his prayer
delivered his people from the hands of Haman; and Jesus by His prayer
delivered His people from the hands of Satan.  Mordecai was delivered
from the hands of his persecutor; and Jesus was rescued from the hands
of His persecutors.  Because Mordecai sat and clothed himself with
sackcloth, he saved Esther and his people from the sword; and because
Jesus clothed Himself with a body and was illuminated, He saved the
Church and her children from death.  Because of Mordecai, Esther was
well pleasing to the king, and went in and sat instead of Vashti, who
did not do his will; and because of Jesus, the Church is well pleasing
to God, and has gone in to the king, instead of the congregation which
did not His Will.  Mordecai admonished Esther that she should fast with
her maidens, that she and her people might be delivered from the hands
of Haman; and Jesus admonished the Church and her children (to fast),
that she and her children might be delivered from the wrath.  Mordecai
received the honour of Haman, his persecutor; and Jesus received great
glory from His Father, instead of His persecutors who were of the
foolish People.  Mordecai trod upon the neck of Haman, his persecutor;
and as for Jesus, His enemies shall be put under His feet.  Before
Mordecai, Haman proclaimed, *Thus shall it be done to the man, in
honouring whom the king is pleased*; <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[1151](#fn_1150.md) and as for Jesus, His preachers
came out of the People that persecuted Him, and they said:—*This is
Jesus the San of God.* <span id="fr_1151"></span>[1152](#fn_1151.md) * *
The blood of Mordecai was required at the hand of Haman and his
sons; <span id="fr_1152"></span>[1153](#fn_1152.md) and *the blood of
Jesus*, His persecutors took *upon themselves and upon their
children*. <span id="fr_1153"></span>[1154](#fn_1153.md)

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p89"></span>21.  These memorials that I have written
unto thee, my beloved, concerning Jesus Who was persecuted, and the
righteous who were persecuted, are in order that those who to-day are
persecuted for the sake of the persecuted Jesus, may be comforted, for
He wrote for us and comforted us Himself; for He said:—*If they have
persecuted Me, they will also persecute you.  And because of this they
will persecute you, that ye are not of the world, even as I was not of
it*. <span id="fr_1154"></span>[1155](#fn_1154.md)   For He wrote before
for us:—*Your fathers and your brothers and your family will deliver you
up, and all men shall hate you for My name’s sake.* <span
id="fr_1155"></span>[1156](#fn_1155.md)   And again He taught us:—*When
they shall bring you before rulers and before magistrates, and before*
<span id="page_401">p. 401</span> <span
id="iii.ix.ix-Page_401"></span>*kings that hold the world, meditate not
before the time what ye shall say, and how ye shall make defence; and I
will give you a mouth and wisdom, that your enemies may not be able to
overcome you, because it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Spirit of
your Father; He shall speak in you*. <span
id="fr_1156"></span>[1157](#fn_1156.md)   This is the spirit which spoke by
the mouth of Jacob to Esau, his persecutor; and the spirit of wisdom
which spoke before Pharaoh by the mouth of the persecuted Joseph; and
the spirit which spoke by the mouth of Moses in all the prodigies which
he did in the land of Egypt, and the spirit of knowledge which was given
to Joshua, the son of Nun, when Moses laid his hand upon him, so that
the nations which persecuted him came to a complete end before him; and
the spirit that uttered psalms by the mouth of the persecuted David, by
which he used to sing psalms and soothe Saul his persecutor from the
evil spirit; and the spirit which clothed Elijah, and through him
reproved Jezebel and Ahab his persecutor; and the spirit which spoke in
Elisha, and prophesied and made known to the king his persecutor about
all that was to happen thereafter; and the spirit which was fervent in
the mouth of Micaiah when he reproved Ahab his persecutor saying:—*If
thou shalt at all return back, the Lord hath not spoken by me*; <span
id="fr_1157"></span>[1158](#fn_1157.md) and the spirit which strengthened
Jeremiah, so that he stood boldly, and by it reproved Zedekiah; and the
spirit that preserved Daniel and his brethren in the land of Babylon;
and the spirit that delivered Mordecai and Esther in the place of their
captivity.

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p94"></span>22.  Hear, my beloved, these names of
martyrs, of confessors, and of the persecuted.  Abel was murdered, and
his blood cried out from the earth.  Jacob was persecuted, and fled and
became an exile.  Joseph was persecuted, and sold and cast into the
pit.  Moses was persecuted, and fled to Midian.  Joshua the son of Nun
was persecuted, and made war.  Jephthah and Samson and Gideon and Barak,
these also were persecuted.  These are they of whom the blessed Apostle
said:—*Time fails me to narrate their victories.* <span
id="fr_1158"></span>[1159](#fn_1158.md)   David also was persecuted at the
hands of Saul, and he walked *in the mountains and in dens, and in
caves*. <span id="fr_1159"></span>[1160](#fn_1159.md)   Samuel also was
persecuted, and mourned over Saul.  Furthermore Hezekiah was persecuted,
and bound up in affliction.  Elijah was persecuted, and walked in the
desert.  Elisha was persecuted and became an exile; and Micaiah was
persecuted, and cast into prison.  Jeremiah was persecuted, and they
cast him into the pit of mire.  Daniel was persecuted, and cast into the
pit of lions.  Hananiah also and his brethren were persecuted, and cast
into the furnace of fire.  Mordecai and Esther and the children of their
people were persecuted, at the hands of Haman.  Judas Maccabæus and his
brethren were persecuted, and they also endured reproach.  The seven
brethren, sons of the blessed woman, endured torments by bitter
scourgings, <span id="fr_1160"></span>[1161](#fn_1160.md) and were
confessors and true martyrs, and Eleazar, aged and advanced in years as
he was, proved a noble example and made (his) confession and became a
true martyr. <span id="fr_1161"></span>[1162](#fn_1161.md)

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p99"></span>23.  Great and excellent is the
martyrdom of Jesus.  He surpassed in affliction and in confession all
who were before or after.  And after Him was the faithful martyr Stephen
whom the Jews stoned.  Simon (Peter) also and Paul were perfect
martyrs.  And James and John walked in the footsteps of their Master
Christ.  Also (others) of the apostles thereafter in divers places
confessed and proved true martyrs.  And also concerning our brethren who
are in the West, in the days of Diocletian there came great affliction
and persecution to the whole Church of God, which was in all their
region.  The Churches were overthrown and uprooted, and many confessors
and martyrs made confession.  And (the Lord) turned in mercy to them
after they were <span id="page_402">p. 402</span> <span
id="iii.ix.ix-Page_402"></span>persecuted.  And also in our days these
things happened to us also on account of our sins; but also that what is
written might be fulfilled, even as our Redeemer said:—*These things are
to be*. <span id="fr_1162"></span>[1163](#fn_1162.md)  The Apostle also
said:—*Also over us is set this cloud of confession*; <span
id="fr_1163"></span>[1164](#fn_1163) which (is.md) our honour, wherein many
confess and are slain.
