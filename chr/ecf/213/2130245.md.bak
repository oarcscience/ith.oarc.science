<span id="iii.v.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.v.xx-p1.1"></span>Hymn XIX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.xx-p2"></span>(<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.xx-p2.1"></span>Resp</span>.—*Blessed be thy Birth that
gladdens all creatures!*)

<span id="iii.v.xx-p3"></span>1.  The first year wherein, our Saviour
was born,—is source of blessing, and ground of life;—for by it are
borne,—manifold triumphs, the sum of all help:—as the first day of “the
beginning,”—the great pillar of all creatures,—bears the building of
Creation;—so the year of the Firstborn *bears* help for man.

<span id="iii.v.xx-p4"></span>2.  In the second year, of our Saviour’s
Birth,—the Magi exult, the Pharisees mourn:—treasures are opened,—kings
are hastening, and infants are slain.—For in it are offered in
Bethlehem,—oblations precious and terrible;—for while love made offering
of gold,—hatred offered infants by the sword.

<span id="iii.v.xx-p5"></span>3.  The day of the All-Lightening, exults
in His birth;—a pillar of radiance, which drives away, by its beams—the
works of darkness.  After the type of that day, wherein light was
created,—and sundered the darkness that spread—over the fair beauty of
Creation;—the radiance of our Saviour’s birth—came in to sunder the
darkness that *was* on the heart.

<span id="iii.v.xx-p6"></span>4.  The first day the source and the
beginning,—orders the roots, to make all things grow.—Our Saviour’s
day—is praised far above it, a tree planted in the world.—For His Death
is as the root in the earth; His Resurrection as the head in heaven; on
all sides His words *reach* as boughs; likewise His Body as fruit for
the eaters.

<span id="iii.v.xx-p7"></span>5.  Let the second day, sing praise to the
Birth—of the second Son, and His voice which first—commanded the
firmament and it was made,—divided the waters that *were* above, and
gathered the seas that *were* under.—He Who divided waters from waters,
divided Himself from the Watchers and came down to man.—For the waters
which at His command were gathered.—He cleft the fountain of life and
gave drink.

<span id="iii.v.xx-p8"></span>6.  Let the third day weave with divers
hymns—the crown of psalms and with one voice present it—for His Birth
who gave growth—of buds and flowers, on the third day.—But now He the
All-giver of growth,—has come down and become the All-holy Flower; from
the thirsting earth has sprang forth and gone up,—that he may decorate
and crown the conquerors.

<span id="iii.v.xx-p9"></span>7.  Let the fourth day praise, first among
the four,—His Birth Who created as the fourth day—the two
lightgivers,—which fools worship, and are sightless and blind.—The Lord
of Lightgivers has come down,—and from the womb has shone on us as the
Sun.—His splendours have opened the eyes of the blind:—His rays have
given light to the wandering.

<span id="iii.v.xx-p10"></span>8.  Let the fifth day laud Him Who
created—on the fifth day creeping things and Dragons—of whose kind is
the serpent.—He deceived with guile our mother, a maid void of
counsel.—The deceiver who had mocked the maid,—by the Dove was exposed
as false,—which from a virgin bosom sprang, and came forth—the Wise that
trod down the crafty.

<span id="iii.v.xx-p11"></span>9.  Let the sixth day laud Him who
created—on Vesper-day Adam, whom Satan envied; as a feigned
friend—cheered him in offering poison in his food.—The medicine of life
reached them both,—put on a body and came near to both.—The mortal
tasted Him and lived through Him;—the devourer who ate Him was left
void.

<span id="iii.v.xx-p12"></span>10.  Let the seventh day hallow the Holy
One,—Who halloweth the Sabbath, and gave rest to all that live.—The
Blessed One Who wearied not—has care for mankind, <span id="page_262">p.
262</span> <span id="iii.v.xx-Page_262"></span>and has care for the
beasts.—When Freedom fell under the yoke,—He came to the Birth and
became bond to make it free:—He was smitten on the face by servants in
the judgment hall;—He broke the yoke that *was* on the free, as Lord.

<span id="iii.v.xx-p13"></span>11.  Let the eighth day, which
circumcised the Hebrews,—praise Him Who commanded his namesake Joshua—to
circumcise with a flint—the people circumcised in body, while the heart
was profane within.—Lo! as the eighth day, as a Babe,—to circumcision He
came Who circumcises all.—Though the sign of Abraham *is* on His
Flesh,—the blind daughter of Sion had defiled it.

<span id="iii.v.xx-p14"></span>12.  Let the tenth day sing, praises in
its turn.—For *God* the *first* letter of Jesus (goodly name!), is ten
in numbering.—He Who *is* as a lamb, turns back the numbers.—For when
the number goes up to ten, it is turned back to begin again from one.  O
great mystery of that which is in Jesus, Whose might turns all creation
back again!

<span id="iii.v.xx-p15"></span>13.  The All-Purifier Firstborn in the
day of His purifying,—purified the purification of the firstborn and was
offered <span id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md) *in the Temple*:—the
Lord of offering needed offerings,—to make offering of birds.—In His
Birth were fulfilled the types,—in His purification and circumcision the
allegories.—He came and paid over debts in His coming down;—in His
Resurrection He went up and sent down treasures.
