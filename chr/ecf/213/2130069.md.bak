<span id="ii.vi.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XV.</span>

<span id="ii.vi.ii-p2"></span>*To Clementina, Patrician* <span
id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104.md) .

<span id="ii.vi.ii-p4"></span>Gregory to Clementina, &c.

<span id="ii.vi.ii-p5"></span>It has reached us by the report of a
certain Abbot that your Glory has been told by certain evil-speakers
that we have a pique against you.  If this is so, whosoever have made up
this story have been double towards you under a shew of sincerity, so as
to shew themselves off as faithful, and wickedly cause you to doubt us. 
But I, glorious daughter, knowing thy good qualities of old, and
especially the chastity which has been thy companion from youth, have
ever regarded thee with great respect and affection.  But, lest even now
your Glory should suspect that my heart is changed, I declare that there
is not in me a scruple of ill-feeling or anger towards you; but be
assured that I evince paternal affection for you.  One thing, however,
that has been told me I ought not to pass over in silence, lest there
should begin to be a diminution of charity, if what needs to be said for
amendment were suppressed.

<span id="ii.vi.ii-p6"></span>For indeed it has been reported to me
that, when any one has offended you, you retain soreness unremittingly. 
Now, if this is true, since the more I love you the more grieved I am, I
beg that you would nobly rid yourself of this fault, and not suffer the
seed of the enemy to grow to the detriment of your crop of well-doing. 
Let the words of the Lord’s Prayer be brought back to your memory, and
let not blame prevail with you over pardon.  Let the goodness of your
Glory get the better of transgressions, and by salubriously pardoning
make the offender devoted to you more than persistent asperity can make
him undevoted.  Let there be left to him what may make him ashamed, and
not kept up what may grieve him.  For usually discreet remission has
more effect for correction than strictness in executing vengeance; so
much so that sometimes the one makes a man more faithful and subdued,
while the other makes him obstinate and spiteful.  And indeed we do not
say this to you in order that you should abate your zeal for
righteousness, but lest you should be in the least things such as you
ought to be in the greatest.  For, if ever the quality of a
transgression requires severity, it should be so dealt with that both
vengeance may correct the fault and grace not be denied afterwards to
those that have been corrected.  Seeing, then, that we warn you under
the dictates of paternal affection for your soul’s good, receive our
words with the charity wherewith they are spoken, and take them to
yourself for the advantage of your Glory, so that your good qualities
may become clearer before men and very pure before Almighty God.  But
count on us, dearest daughter, confidently in all things, as indeed you
may; and, since we always desire to hear of your prosperity, refresh us
often by your letters.
