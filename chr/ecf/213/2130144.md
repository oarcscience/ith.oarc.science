<span id="ii.ix.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.ix.xiv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXIV.</span>

<span id="ii.ix.xiv-p2"></span>To Pantaleo, Notary.

<span id="ii.ix.xiv-p3"></span>Gregory to Pantaleo, &c.

<span id="ii.ix.xiv-p4"></span>Thy Experience remembers what and what
kind of oath thou tookest over the most sacred body of the blessed
apostle Peter.  Whence also we committed to thee without fear the charge
of enquiry in the patrimony of the Syracusan district.  It is, then,
incumbent on thee to have thine own good faith and the fear of the same
blessed apostle Peter ever before thine eyes, and so to act that neither
with men in this present life nor with Almighty God in the last judgment
thou mayest be open to blame.  Now from the report of Salerius our
*chartularius* we have learnt that thou hast found the *modius* in which
the husbandmen (*coloni*) <span id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218) of the
Church have been compelled to give their corn to be one of twenty-five
*sextarii* <span id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219) .  This we altogether
execrated, and were sorry thou hadst been late in making it a subject of
enquiry.  We rejoice, therefore, at thy telling us that thou hast broken
the said *modius* and made a just one.  But, inasmuch as the aforesaid
*chartularius* has taken care to mention also what has already been
collected under thy Experience by the fraudulent dealings of the farmers
(*conductores*) <span id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220) from two
territories, therefore, even as with a view to the future, we rejoice
that thou hast acted zealously in breaking the unjust *modius*, so also
we think of sins in the past; lest, if what the farmers have
fraudulently taken away from the peasants (*rusticis*) <span
id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221) accrues to us, we should <span
id="page_100">p. 100</span> <span id="ii.ix.xiv-Page_100"></span>be
implicated in their sins.  And accordingly we desire thy Experience,
with all faithfulness, with all integrity—having regard to the fear of
Almighty God, and recalling to mind the strictness of the blessed
apostle Peter—to make a list throughout each several estate
(*massam*) <span id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222) of poor and indigent
husbandmen, and with the money found to have been got by fraud to
procure cows, sheep, and swine, and distribute them among the several
poor husbandmen.  And this we desire thee to do with the advice of the
most reverend lord bishop John <span id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223) ,
and Adrian our *chartularius* and *rector* <span
id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224) .  If, moreover, it should be
necessary for the sake of consultation, our son also the lord Julian
should be called in, so that no one else may know, but all be kept quite
secret.  Do you therefore consult among yourselves whether this same
assistance should be given to the said poor husbandmen in money or in
kind.  But, whatever be the common fund, first, as I have said, make a
list, and afterwards take pains to distribute to each according to the
degree of his poverty.  For I, as the teacher of the Gentiles testifies,
have all and abound; nor do I seek money, but reward ([Phil.
iv](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#000)<span
id="ii.ix.xiv-p11.1"></span>.).  So act therefore that in the day of
judgment thou mayest shew me fruit of thy labour from the service that
has been committed to thy Experience.  If thou do this purely,
faithfully, and strenuously, thou wilt both receive it back here in thy
children, and hereafter wilt have plenary retribution in the scrutiny of
the Eternal Judge.
