<span id="iii.vi.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.vi.xiii-p1.1"></span>Hymn XII.</span>

<span id="iii.vi.xiii-p2"></span>(<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.vi.xiii-p2.1"></span>Resp</span>.—*Blessed is He Who went down
and was baptized in Jordan, and turned back the People from error!*)

<span id="iii.vi.xiii-p3"></span>1.  In Baptism Adam found *again*—that
glory that *was* among the trees *of Eden*.—He went down, and received
it out of the water;—he put it on, and went up and was adorned
therein.—Blessed be He that has mercy on all!

<span id="iii.vi.xiii-p4"></span>2.  Man fell in the midst of
Paradise,—and in baptism compassion restored him:—he lost his comeliness
through *Satan’s* envy,—and found it *again* by *God’s* grace.—Blessed
be He that has mercy on all!

<span id="iii.vi.xiii-p5"></span>3.  The wedded pair were adorned in
Eden;—but the serpent stole their crowns:—yet mercy crushed down the
accursed one,—and made the wedded pair goodly in their raiment.—Blessed
be He that has mercy on all!

<span id="iii.vi.xiii-p6"></span>4.  They clothed themselves with leaves
of necessity;—but the Merciful had pity on their beauty,—and instead of
leaves of trees,—He clothed them with glory in the water.—Blessed be He
that has mercy on all!

<span id="iii.vi.xiii-p7"></span>5.  Baptism is the well-spring of
life,—which the Son of God opened by His Life;—and from His Side it has
brought forth streams.—Come, all that thirst, come, rejoice!—Blessed be
He that has mercy on all!

<span id="iii.vi.xiii-p8"></span>6.  The Father has sealed *Baptism*, to
exalt it;—and the Son has espoused it to glorify it;—and the Spirit with
threefold seal—has stamped it, and it has shone in holiness.—Blessed be
He that has mercy on all!

<span id="iii.vi.xiii-p9"></span>7.  The Trinity that is
unsearchable—has laid up treasures in baptism.—Descend, ye poor, to its
fountain!—and be enriched from it, ye needy!—Blessed be He that has
mercy on all!
