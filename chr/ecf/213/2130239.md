<span id="iii.v.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.v.xiv-p1.1"></span>Hymn XIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p2"></span>(Compare Hymn II. *For the Epiphany*.)

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p3"></span>1.  <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.xiv-p3.1"></span>In</span> the days of the King whom they
called by the name of Semha, <span id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485.md) our
Lord sprang up among the Hebrews:  and Semha and Denha <span
id="fr_486"></span>[487](#fn_486.md) ruled, and came, King upon earth, and
Son in Heaven; blessed be His rule!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p6"></span>2.  In the days of the king who enrolled
men in the book of the dead, our Redeemer came down and enrolled men in
the book of the living.  He enrolled, and they also:  on high He
enrolled us, on earth they enrolled Him.  Glory to His Name!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p7"></span>3.  In the days of the king whose name
was Semha, the type and the Reality met together, the king and the King,
Semha and Denha.  His Cross upon His shoulders, was the sign of His
Kingdom.  Blessed be He Who bare it.

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p8"></span>4.  Thirty years He went in poverty upon
the earth!  The sounds of praise in all their measures let us twine, my
brethren, to the years of the Lord, as thirty crowns to the thirty
years.  Blessed be His Birth!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p9"></span>5.  In the first year, that is chieftain
over the treasures and Dispenser of abundant <span id="page_248">p.
248</span> <span id="iii.v.xiv-Page_248"></span>blessings, let the
Cherubim who bare up the Son in glory, <span
id="fr_487"></span>[488](#fn_487.md) praise Him with us!  He left His
glory, and toiled and found the sheep that was lost.  To Him be
thanksgiving!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p11"></span>6.  In the second year, let the Seraphim
praise Him yet more with us.  They that had proclaimed the Son
Holy, <span id="fr_488"></span>[489](#fn_488.md) by and by saw Him when He
was reviled among the gainsayers; He bore the contempt and taught
praise.  To Him be Glory!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p13"></span>7.  In the third year, let Michael and
his followers, that ministered to the Son in the highest, praise Him
with us.  They saw Him on the earth when He was ministering, washing
feet, cleansing souls.  Blessed be His lowliness!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p14"></span>8.  In the fourth year, let the whole
earth praise Him with us.  It is but small for the Son, and it marvelled
because it saw that it entertained Him in its bed that is so very mean. 
He filled the bed, and filled the Heaven.  To Him be Majesty!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p15"></span>9.  In the fifth year, the Sun shone
unto the earth.  With its breath let it praise our Sun Who brought His
breadth down low, and humbled His mightiness, that the subtle eye of the
unseen soul might be able to look upon Him.  Blessed be His brightness!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p16"></span>10.  In the sixth year again, let the
whole air praise Him with us, in whose wide space it is that all things
are made glorious, which saw its mighty Lord that had become a little
Child in a little bosom.  Blessed be His dignity!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p17"></span>11.  In the seventh year, the clouds and
winds rejoiced with us and sprinkled the dews over the flowers, for they
saw the Son who enslaved His brightness and received disgrace and foul
spitting.  Blessed be His Redemption!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p18"></span>12.  In the year also that is eighth,
let the fields give praise, that suckle their fruits from His
fountains.  They worshipped because they saw the Son in arms and the
pure One sucking pure milk.  Blessed be His good pleasure!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p19"></span>13.  In the ninth year, let the earth
glorify the might of her Creator, Who laid seed in her in the beginning
that she might bring forth all her produce; for it saw Mary, a thirsty
land, who yielded the fruit of a Child that was a wonder, yea, a
marvel.  \[Then\] it praised Him more exceedingly, for that He was a
great Sea of all good things.  To Him be exaltation!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p20"></span>14.  In the tenth year, let the mount
Sinai glorify Him, it which trembled before its Lord.  It saw that they
took up stones against its Lord; He received stones, Who should build
His Church upon a Stone. <span id="fr_489"></span>[490](#fn_489.md)  
Blessed be His building!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p22"></span>15.  In the eleventh year, let the great
sea praise the fists of the Son that measured it, <span
id="fr_490"></span>[491](#fn_490.md) and it was astonished and saw that He
came down, was baptized in a small water, and cleansed the creatures. 
Blessed be His noble act!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p24"></span>16.  In the twelfth year, let the holy
Temple praise Him, that saw the Child when He sat amongst the old men: 
the priests were silent when the Lamb of the Feast bleated in His
feast.  Blessed be His propitiation!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p25"></span>17.  In the thirteenth year, let the
crowns praise with us the King who conquered, that died and was crowned
with a crown of thorns, and bound upon Adam a great crown at His right
hand.  Blessed be His Apostleship!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p26"></span>18.  In the fourteenth year, let the
passover in Egypt praise the Passover that came and passed over all, and
instead of Pharaoh sunk Legion, <span id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491.md)
instead of horses choked the devil.  Blessed be His vengeance!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p28"></span>19.  In the fifteenth year, let the lamb
of the gluttons praise Him:  since our Lord was so far from slaughtering
it as Moses did, that He even redeemed mankind with His own Blood.  He
that feeds all, died for all.  Blessed be His Father!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p29"></span>20.  In the sixteenth year, let the
wheat praise by its type that Husbandman, <span
id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md) Who <span id="page_249">p. 249</span>
<span id="iii.v.xiv-Page_249"></span>sowed His Body in the barren earth,
since it covers all, spreads itself out and yields new Bread.  Blessed
be the Pure One!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p31"></span>21.  In the seventeenth year, let the
Vine praise the Lord that garnished it.  He planted a vineyard, souls
were as vineplants.  He gave peace to the vineyard, but destroyed the
vineyard that brought forth wild grapes.  Blessed be its Uprooter!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p32"></span>22.  In the eighteenth year, let the
Vine which the wild boar out of the wood had eaten, praise the True Vine
which trimmed Himself, and kept His fruit, and brought the fruits to the
Lord of the Vineyard. <span id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493.md)   Blessed
be His Vintage!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p34"></span>23.  In the nineteenth year, let our
leaven praise the true leaven which worked itself in among those that
were in error, and drove them all together, and made them one mind by
one Doctrine.  Blessed be thy doctrine!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p35"></span>24.  In the twentieth year, let salt
praise Thy living Body, wherewith are salted the bodies and the souls of
all the faithful, and faith is the salt of men wherewith they are
preserved. <span id="fr_494"></span>[495](#fn_494.md)   Blessed be Thy
preserving!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p37"></span>25.  In the twenty-first year, let the
waters of the desert praise Thee.  They are sweet to them afar off, they
are bitter to them <span id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495.md) that are
near, who did not minister to Him.  The \[chosen\] people and the
nations were bitter in the desert, and He destroyed them.  They were
sweetened by the Cross which redeemed them.  Blessed be Thy
pleasantness!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p39"></span>26.  In the twenty-second year, let arms
and the sword praise Thee:  they sufficed not to kill our adversary.  It
was Thou that killed him, even Thou who didst fix the ear on, which
Simon’s sword cut off.  Blessed be Thy healing!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p40"></span>27.  In the twenty-third year, let the
ass praise Him, that gave its foal for Him to ride on, that loosed the
bonds, that opened the mouth of the dumb, that opened also the mouth of
the wild asses <span id="fr_496"></span>[497](#fn_496.md) when the race of
Hagar gave a shout of praise. <span id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497.md)  
Blessed be the praise of Thee!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p43"></span>28.  In the twenty-fourth year, let the
Treasury praise the Son.  The treasures marvelled at the Lord of
treasures, when in the house of the poor He was increasing, Who made
Himself poor that He might enrich all. <span
id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498.md)   Blessed be Thy rule!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p45"></span>29.  In the twenty-fifth year, let Isaac
praise the Son, for by His goodness he was rescued upon the Mount from
the knife, and in his stead there was the victim, the type of the Lamb
for the slaughter. <span id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499.md)   The mortal
escaped, and He that quickens all died. <span
id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md)   Blessed be His offering!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p48"></span>30.  In the twenty-sixth year, let Moses
praise Him with us, for that he was afraid and fled from his murderers. 
Let him praise the Lord that bore the spear and that received the nails
in His hands, in His feet.  He entered into hell and spoiled it, <span
id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501.md) and came forth.  Blessed be Thy
Resurrection!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p50"></span>31.  In the year which is the
twenty-seventh, let the eloquent speakers praise the Son, for they found
no cloke to save our cause.  He was silent in the judgment-hall, and He
carried our cause.  Honour be to Him!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p51"></span>32.  And in this year let all judges
praise Him, who, as being just men, killed the ungodly; let them praise
the Son who died for the wicked, as being good.  Though Son of the Just
One, He gave them all manner of good things in abundance.  Blessed be
His bowels of mercy!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p52"></span>33.  In the eight and twentieth year,
let all mighty men of valour praise the Son, because they delivered not
from him who took us captive.  He only is to be praised, who being slain
showed us life. <span id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502.md)   Blessed be His
delivery!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p54"></span><span id="page_250">p. 250</span> <span
id="iii.v.xiv-Page_250"></span>34.  In the twenty-ninth year, let Job
praise Him with us, who bore sufferings for himself, and our Lord bore
for us the spitting and the spear, and the crown of thorns, and
scourges, contempt and reproach, yea mocking.  Blessed be His mercy!

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p55"></span>35.  In the year that is thirteenth, let
the dead praise Him with us, because they are quickened, and the living,
because they have turned to repentance, <span
id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503.md) because height and depth were set at
one by Him.  Blessed be He and His Father!
