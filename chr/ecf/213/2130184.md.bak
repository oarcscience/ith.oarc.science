<span id="iii.iv.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Hymn VII.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p2"></span>1.  Wrath came to rebuke, the greedy
who in the midst of peace, bargained, defrauded and plundered.  In
calamity the greedy have waxed rich:  lo! what was theirs they have
scattered, what was not theirs they have gathered.  *R., Give peace, O
Son, to our land!*

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p3"></span>2.  Twenty years my troubles, have been
like branches, O my Saviour! which are kept back throughout winter, but
when it is time to shoot forth, my troubles shoot forth:  with our fruit
our heart ripens.

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p4"></span>3.  Nisan is the time of buds:  in it
the *ill* tidings budded.  When our delights crowded on us, then crowded
on us our ills.  At the time of winnowing of wheat, came the winnowing
of cities,

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p5"></span>4.  For the three brethren in Babylon
fled not from the fire that men kindled, because they were steadfast: 
from lust they fled, because they were perfect.

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p6"></span>5.  The fire of them that have
triumphed, is able to turn the black kids into white:  the fire of vain
men is able to make the lambs into spotted leopards.

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p7"></span>6.  How great will be my cries, to be
cried at any alarm!  How great my indignation to ripen at every ill
tidings!  How great my harvests, to perish every mouth!

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p8"></span>7.  For the crimes of my sons He has
chastened me, in their struggling for my deliverance.  The people who
deliver me, bring chastisement upon me.  Restrain ye your sins, and lo!
my chastisements are restrained!

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p9"></span>8.  In ill tidings they are afflicted;
in time of wrath they are tortured; in time of peace they are
distressed; for when every man breathes freely, and *all* are unthankful
for grace, they render *thanks* on behalf of every man.

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p10"></span>9.  Their sackcloth *is* humble for my
sake; their ashes *are* sprinkled in my affliction; their prayer *is*
for my victory; their fast for my deliverance:  Lo! the debt is on my
ascetics, the guilt with my nobles.

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p11"></span>10.  Great is in every age, the folly
of the wise; the scribes and elders envied and killed the teacher, who
taught all people the Law of Moses.

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p12"></span>11.  Wisdom in this age *is* a
possession that brings loss:  he who has a little folly, very small *is*
his guilt; but he who has a little prudence, his iniquity passes
measure.

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p13"></span>12.  They build with their words, and
overthrow in their deeds; for the teachers were many and foolish, but
the mouth of the judge is both of these things, the judge and the
accuser.
