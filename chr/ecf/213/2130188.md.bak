id="iii.iv.xii-p1.1"></span>Hymn XI.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p2"></span>1.  Thy chastening is, *as* a mother of
our infancy:—her rebuke is merciful, in that Thou hast restrained,—the
children from folly, and they have been made wise!  *R., Glory be to thy
justice!*

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p3"></span>2.  Let us search out Thy justice; for
who is sufficient—to measure its help? since by it the wanton—are
oftentimes made chaste.—

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p4"></span>3.  Oftentimes Thy hand, O my Lord, has
made the sick whole,—for it is the healer in secret of their
diseases,—and the fount of their life.

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p5"></span>4.  Exceeding gently, the finger of Thy
justice,—in love and compassion, touches the wounds—of him that is to be
healed.

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p6"></span>5.  Exceeding mild and merciful, is her
cutting to him that is wise:—her sharp remedy, in its mighty
love,—consumes the corrupt *part*.

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p7"></span>6.  Exceeding welcome her wrath, to him
that is discerning;—but her remedies are hated, of the fool who has
delight—in the trouble of his limbs.

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p8"></span>7.  Exceeding eager is she, to bind the
cut she has made;—when she has smitten she pities, that from between
these two—she may breed healing.

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p9"></span>8. Exceeding welcome her wrath, and her
anger pleasant,—and sweet her bitterness, sweetening bitter things—that
they may be made pleasant.

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p10"></span>9.  A cause of negligence is Thy
indulgence to the careless;—a cause of profit, is Thy rod among the
slothful—so that they become *as* traffickers.

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p11"></span>10.  The cause of our affliction, it is
Thy justice;—the cause of our carelessness, it is Thy graciousness,—for
our understanding has turned foolish.

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p12"></span>11.  Pharaoh hardened himself, because
of Thy graciousness;—for when the plagues were stayed, his cruelties
waxed strong,—and he lied to his promises.

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p13"></span>12.  Justice requited him, because he
lied greatly against her,—even *Grace* her freeborn sister; yea she
restrained him again—that he should not again provoke.

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p14"></span>13.  Rebuke, O my Lord, my guide, for
it has been false as Egypt —my prayers testify, that I am not as
she,—for Thy door have I not forsaken.

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p15"></span>14.  Let Thy cross, O my Lord, which
stands, in my breaches that are open,—repair again the *breaches* that
are hidden; for instead of those without,—those within have cleft me
asunder!

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p16"></span>15.  A sea has broken through, and cast
down, the watch tower wherein I had triumphed.—Iniquity has dared to set
up, a temple wherein I am shamed:  its drink-offering chokes me.

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p17"></span>16.  My prayers on my walls, my
persecutors have heard:—the sun and his worshippers, are ashamed of
their magicians,—for I have triumphed by Thy cross.

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p18"></span>17.  *All* creatures cried out, when
they saw the struggle,—while Truth with falsehood, on my battered walls,
fought and was crowned conqueror.

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p19"></span>18.  The force of Truth, chastised
falsehood:—in its chastisement it felt *Truth*, and through its *own*
sins, it earned her victory.

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p20"></span>19.  I have great alarm; for since my
deliverance,—the honourable and mighty, who were devoted to my altar,
have built in me high places.

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p21"></span>20.  My seven senses, O my Lord, even
though they had been as fountains of tears, yet my tears were *too*
little—to lament our ruin.

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p22"></span>21.  The streets that *were* in
sackcloth, and ashes cried out,—disturbed by the play, akin to that
which *was*,—in the wilderness before the calf.

<span id="iii.iv.xii-p23"></span>22.  Poison seeks and wears, the beauty
of lilies;—and though their buds may conceal, and hidden disguise it,—it
blossoms in their bitter flowers.
