<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xxxiii-p2"></A>1.&#160; Come, let us hear how they contend for victory:&#160; the guilty ones who never have conquered, nor will conquer.&#8212;2. Death said unto the Evil One, In the end the victory is mine:&#160; for Death is master of the close, as a conqueror.&#8212;3. <i>Satan</i>, This were to be Death indeed, wert thou able:&#160; to bring to death a living man, by means of lusts.&#8212;4. <i>D</i>., Lo! I who behold the dead, both good and bad:&#160; the righteous who despise thee, O Evil One, me they despise not.&#8212;5. <i>S</i>., This dying of the body, is sleep for a time:&#160; think not, O Death, that thou art Death, who art as a shadow.&#8212;6. <i>D</i>., Thee, O Evil One, the just have conquered, yea will conquer:&#160; but these that have conquered thee, lo! I conquer.&#8212;7. <i>S</i>., Even this that thou bringest to death the just, is not of thyself:&#160; because of Adam whom I conquered, they drink this cup.&#8212;8. <i>D</i>., Lo! Sheol is full of the men of Sodom, and the Assyrians:&#160; and the giants who <i>were</i> in the flood, who is like me?&#8212;9. <i>S</i>., These, O Death, all of them, by me were slain:&#160; I am he that caused them to sin so that they perished.&#8212;10. <i>D</i>., Joseph who conquered thee I conquered, O Satan:&#160; in the chamber he conquered thee but I conquered, and cast him into the tomb.&#8212;11. <i>S</i>., Moses who conquered thee, O Death, by sprinkling of blood:&#160; he conquered thee in Egypt, but at the rock, who conquered him?&#8212;12. <i>D</i>., Elijah who feared thee not, O Satan:&#160; fled before Jezebel&#146;s face, because he feared me.&#8212;13. <i>S</i>., Aaron who withstood thee, O Death, with smoke of incense:&#160; to him I gave earrings of gold:&#160; and he fashioned a calf.&#8212;14. <i>D</i>., Thou wentest down to contend with Job, and he conquered thee and came up:&#160; but I, after he had conquered thee, then conquered him.&#8212;15. <i>S</i>., David who by his sackcloth stayed that pestilence:&#160; him on the house-top I conquered, who had conquered Goliath.&#8212;16. <i>D</i>., Jehu who destroyed the house of Baal, the temple of the Evil One:&#160; was unable to destroy Sheol, the stronghold of my realm.&#8212;17. <i>S</i>., Solomon who snatched from thy mouth, a child by <i>his</i> judgment:&#160; him in his old age I made a builder of idol-altars.&#8212;18. <i>D</i>., Samuel who in <i>respect of</i> gold scorned thee, O Satan:&#160; him I conquered, the conqueror, who conquered bribes.&#8212;19. <i>S</i>., <A NAME="page_208"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 208</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iv.xxxiii-Page_208"></A>Samson who in <i>respect of</i> the lion&#146;s whelp, scorned thee, O Death:&#160; through Delilah, frail vessel, I yoked him to the mill.&#8212;20. <i>D</i>., Josiah from his childhood despised thee, Evil One:&#160; but me not even in his old age, could he withstand.&#8212;21. <i>S</i>., Hezekiah withstood thee, Death, when he overcame the bound <i>of life</i>:&#160; I misled him and he neglected the miracle, and showed his treasures.&#8212;22. <i>D</i>., John who conquered thee, Evil One, and absolved and baptized:&#160; I extinguished that torch, which had disclosed thee.&#8212;23. <i>S</i>., Simon overcame thee, when he brought to life that blessed woman:&#160; in a woman he overcame thee and by a woman I overcame him and made him deny.&#8212;24. <i>S</i>., Apostles and prophets with one voice, curse thee, O Death:&#160; &#8220;Where is the victory of Death, and the sting of Sheol?&#8221;&#8212;25. Thy Lord in Sheol thou hast shut up, O cursed servant:&#160; God hates thee and also man, hold then thy peace.&#8212;26. <i>S</i>., It was the will of Him who gives life to all, that shut him in Sheol:&#160; it was thou that called Him to this, when thou madest Adam sin.&#8212;27. O comrade of Nabal who in the wilderness reproached his lord:&#160; abhorred be thy mouth which said to Him, &#8220;Fall down and worship me!&#8221;</p>
