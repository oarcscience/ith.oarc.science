id="ii.vii.xx-p1.1"></span>Epistle LIV.</span>

<span id="ii.vii.xx-p2"></span>*To Desiderius, Bishop of Gaul* <span
id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) .

<span id="ii.vii.xx-p4"></span>Gregory to Desiderius, &c.

<span id="ii.vii.xx-p5"></span>Many good things having been reported to
us with regard to your pursuits, such joy arose in our heart that we
could not bear to refuse what your Fraternity had requested to have
granted to you.  But it afterwards came to our ears, what we cannot
mention without shame, that thy Fraternity is in the habit of expounding
grammar to certain persons.  This thing we took so much amiss, and so
strongly disapproved it, that we changed what had been said before into
groaning and sadness, since the praises of Christ cannot find room in
one mouth with the praises of Jupiter.  And consider thyself what a
grave and heinous offence it is for bishops to sing what is not becoming
even for a religious layman.  And, though our most beloved son Candidus
the presbyter, having been, when he came to us, strictly examined on
this matter, denied it, and endeavoured to excuse you, yet still the
thought has not departed from our mind, that in proportion as it is
execrable for such a thing to be related of a priest, it ought to be
ascertained by strict and veracious evidence whether or not it be so. 
Whence, if hereafter what has been reported to us should prove evidently
to be false, and it should be clear that you do not apply yourself to
trifles and secular literature, we shall give thanks to our God, who has
not permitted your heart to be stained with the blasphemous praises of
the <span id="page_70">p. 70</span> <span
id="ii.vii.xx-Page_70"></span>abominable; and we will treat without
misgiving or hesitation concerning the granting of what you request.

<span id="ii.vii.xx-p6"></span>We commend to you in all respects the
monks whom together with our most beloved son Laurentius the presbyter
and Mellitus the abbot we have sent to our most reverend brother and
fellow-bishop Augustine, that, through the succour of your Fraternity,
no delay may stop their onward progress.

<span id="ii.vii.xx-p3"></span> Desiderius was bishop of Vienne, cf. VI.
54.  This letter, with others that follow (Epp. LV., LVI., LVII., LVIII,
LIX., LX., LXI., LXII., LXIV., LXV., LXVI., and possibly also the
preceding Epistle, XXIX.) were carried, as appears from its conclusion,
by Mellitus and his companions, who, in answer to Augustine’s request,
were sent by Gregory from Rome to reinforce the mission to Britain
(Bede, *H. E.* I. 27, 29).  See *Prolegomena*, p. xxvi.  It is notable
as shewing Gregory’s views with regard to the study of secular
literature.
