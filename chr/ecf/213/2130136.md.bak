<span id="ii.ix.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.ix.vi-p1.1"></span>Epistle IX.</span>

<span id="ii.ix.vi-p2"></span>To Thalassia, Abbess.

<span id="ii.ix.vi-p3"></span>Gregory to Thalassia, &c.

<span id="ii.ix.vi-p4"></span>When the hearts of catholic kings are so
inflamed with ardent desire, by divine grace preventing them, as of
their own accord to demand the things that pontifical admonitions should
provoke them to, such things are to be granted with cheerful and joyful
mind all the more as the very things which they desire ought to have
been demanded of them, had they been unwilling to do them.  Accordingly,
in accordance with the letters of our most Excellent royal children,
Brunichild and her grandson Theoderic, to the monastery of Saint Mary,
where there is constituted a congregation of handmaidens of God, founded
in the city of Augustodunum by the bishop Siagrius of reverend memory,
over which you preside, we indulge, grant and confirm by the decree of
our present authority privileges as follows;—Ordaining that no king, no
bishop, no one endowed with any dignity whatsoever, or any one else
whatsoever, shall have power, under show of any cause or occasion
whatsoever, to diminish or take away, or apply to his own uses, or grant
as if to other pious uses for excuse of his own avarice, anything of
what has been given to the same monastery by the above-written <span
id="page_96">p. 96</span> <span id="ii.ix.vi-Page_96"></span>king’s own
children, or of what shall in future be bestowed on it by any others
whatever of their own possessions.  But all things that have been there
offered, or may come to be offered, we will to be possessed by thee, as
well as by those who shall succeed thee in thy office and place, from
the present time inviolate and without disturbance, provided thou apply
them in all ways to the uses of those for whose sustentation and
government they have been granted.

<span id="ii.ix.vi-p5"></span>We also appoint that on the death of an
abbess of the aforesaid monastery no other shall be ordained by means of
any kind of craftiness of secret scheming, but such a one as the king of
the same province, with the consent of the nuns, shall have chosen in
the fear of God, and provided for the ordination of.

<span id="ii.ix.vi-p6"></span>Under this head we also add, in order that
we may exclude all place for avarice, that no one of the kings, no one
of the priests, or any one else in person or by proxy, shall dare to
accept anything in gold, or in any kind of consideration whatever, for
the ordination of such abbess, or for any causes whatever pertaining to
this monastery, and that the same abbess presume not to give anything on
account of her ordination, lest by such occasion what is offered or has
been offered to places of piety should be consumed.  And, inasmuch as
many occasions for the deception of religious women are sought out, as
is said, in your parts by bad men, we ordain that an abbess of this same
monastery shall in no wise be deprived or deposed unless in case of
criminality requiring it.  Hence it is necessary that if any complaint
of this kind should arise against her, not only the bishop of the city
of Augustodunum should examine the case, but that he should call to his
assistance six other of his fellow-bishops, and so fully investigate the
matter, to the end that, all judging with one accord, a strict canonical
decision may either smite her if guilty, or absolve her if innocent.

<span id="ii.ix.vi-p7"></span>All these things, therefore, which the
paper of this our precept and decree contains we decree to be observed
in perpetuity for thee as well as for all who may succeed thee in the
same rank and place, and for all whom they may concern.  Moreover, if
any one, whether king, priest, judge, or secular person, being aware of
this our written constitution, should attempt to contravene it, let him
be deprived of the dignity of his power and honour, and know that he
stands guilty before divine judgment for the iniquity that he has
perpetrated.  And, unless he either restore what he has wrongfully taken
away, or lament what he has done unlawfully with fit penitence, let him
be debarred from the most sacred body and blood of our God and Lord, the
Redeemer Jesus Christ, and be subject to strict vengeance in the eternal
judgment.  But the peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be to all who observe
what is just to this same place, to the end that they may both receive
here the fruit of their well-doing, and find the rewards of eternal
peace at the hands of the strict Judge.
