<span id="ii.v.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.v.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XLII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxiii-p2"></span>To Agilulph, King of the Lombards.

<span id="ii.v.xxiii-p3"></span>Gregory to Agilulph, &c.

<span id="ii.v.xxiii-p4"></span>We return thanks to your Excellency,
that, hearkening to our petition, you have concluded such a peace as may
be of advantage to both parties, as we had confidence in you that you
would.  On this account we greatly commend your prudence and goodness,
since in choosing peace you have shewn that you love God, who is its
author.  For, if unhappily peace had not been made, what else could have
ensued but, with sin and danger on both sides, the shedding of the blood
of miserable peasants <span id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) , whose
labour profits both?  But, that we may feel the advantage to us of this
peace, as it has been made by you, we beg you, greeting you with
paternal charity, that as often as opportunity offers itself, you would
enjoin by letters on your dukes in divers places, and especially those
who are constituted in these parts, that they keep this peace inviolate,
as has been promised, and not seek for themselves any occasions whence
either any contention or any ill-feeling may arise, to the end that we
may be able to give thanks still more for your good will.  We received
the bearers of these presents, as being in very truth your own people,
with the affection that was becoming, since it was right both to receive
and dismiss with charity men who are wise, and who announced that by the
favour of God peace had been concluded.
