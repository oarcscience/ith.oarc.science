id="ii.v.xxii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XLI.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxii-p2"></span>To Julianus, Scribo <span
id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32) .

<span id="ii.v.xxii-p4"></span>Gregory to Julianus, &c.

<span id="ii.v.xxii-p5"></span>If in secular offices order and the
discipline handed down by our ancestors is observed, who may bear to see
ecclesiastical order confounded, to disregard such things when heard of,
and postpone their amendment by improperly condoning them?  And indeed
you do well to love charity and to persuade to concord.  But, since we
are compelled by consideration of our position, and for God’s sake, by
no means to leave uninvestigated the things that have come to our
knowledge, we shall take care, when Maximus comes, to require a strict
account from him of the things that have been said about him.  And we
trust in the guardianship of our Creator, that we shall not be turned
aside by either the favour or the fault of any man from maintenance of
the canons and the straight path of equity, but willingly observe what
is agreeable to reason.  For if (which God forbid) we neglect
ecclesiastical solicitude and vigour, indolence destroys discipline, and
certainly harm will be done to the souls of the faithful, while they see
such examples set them by their pastors.  But with regard to your saying
in your letter that the good will of the palace and the love of the
people are not alienated from him, this circumstance does not recall us
from our zeal for justice, nor shall it cause our determination to
enquire into the truth to <span id="page_13">p. 13</span> <span
id="ii.v.xxii-Page_13"></span>fail through sin of ours.  Every one,
then, should strive, magnificent son, to conciliate to himself the love
of God.  For without divine favour what can I say that human love will
do for us hereafter, when even among ourselves it harms us the more?
