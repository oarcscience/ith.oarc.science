id="ii.v.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XLIII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxiv-p2"></span>To Theodelinda, Queen of the Lombards.

<span id="ii.v.xxiv-p3"></span>Gregory to Theodelinda, &c.

<span id="ii.v.xxiv-p4"></span>How your Excellency has laboured
earnestly and kindly, as is your wont, for the conclusion of peace we
have learnt from the report of our son, the abbot Probus.  Nor indeed
was it otherwise to be expected of your Christianity than that you would
in all ways skew your assiduity and goodness in the cause of peace. 
Wherefore we give thanks to Almighty God, who so rules your heart with
His loving-kindness that, as He has given you a right faith, so He also
grants you to work always what is pleasing in His sight.  For you may be
assured, most excellent daughter, that for the saving of so much
bloodshed on both sides you have acquired no small reward.  On this
account, returning thanks for your goodwill, we implore the mercy of our
God to repay you with good in body and soul here and in the world to
come.

<span id="ii.v.xxiv-p5"></span>Moreover, greeting you with fatherly
affection, we exhort you so to deal with your most excellent consort
that he may not reject the alliance of the Christian republic.  For, as
I believe you know yourself, it is in many ways profitable that he
should be inclined to betake himself to its friendship.  Do you then,
after your manner, always strive for what tends to goodwill and
conciliation between the parties, and labour wherever an occasion of
reaping a reward presents itself, that you may commend your good deeds
the more before the eyes of Almighty God.
