id="ii.v.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Epistle LIX.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxviii-p2"></span>*To John, Bishop of Syracuse* <span
id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38) .

<span id="ii.v.xxviii-p4"></span>Gregory to John, &c.

<span id="ii.v.xxviii-p5"></span>I have received your Fraternity’s
letter, wherein you inform me that the most eloquent Martin has come
from the African province and communicated something to you privately. 
And indeed your Fraternity, as often as you find occasion, ceases not to
shew your love towards the blessed apostle Peter.  Wherefore we give
thanks to Almighty God, that where you are, there we are not found
absent.  Nevertheless, your Holiness is not yet fully cognizant of the
case in hand.  For the Byzacene primate <span
id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39) had been accused on some charge, and the
most pious Emperor wished him to be judged by us according to canonical
ordinance.  But then, on the receipt of ten pounds of gold, Theodorus
the *magister militum* opposed this being done.  Yet the most pious
Emperor admonished us to commission some one, and do whatever was
canonical.  But, seeing the contrarieties of men, we have been unwilling
to decide this case.  Now, moreover, this same primate says something
about his own intention.  And it is exceedingly doubtful whether he says
such things to us sincerely, or in fact because he is being attacked by
his fellow-bishops:  for, as to his saying that he is subject to the
Apostolic See, if any fault is found in bishops, I know not what bishop
is not subject to it.  But when no fault requires it to be otherwise,
all according to the principle of humility are equal.  Nevertheless, do
you speak with the aforesaid most eloquent Martin as seems good to your
Fraternity.  For it is for you to consider what should be done; and we
have replied to you briefly on the case, because we ought not to believe
indiscriminately men that are even unknown to us.  If, however, you, who
see him before you in person, are of opinion that anything more definite
should be said to him, we commit this to your Charity, being sure of
your love in the grace of Almighty God.  And what you do regard without
doubt as having been done by us.
