<span id="ii.v.iv"></span>

<span id="ii.v.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.v.iv-p1.1"></span>Epistle IV.</span>

<span id="ii.v.iv-p2"></span>To Januarius, Bishop of Caralis (Cagliari).

<span id="ii.v.iv-p3"></span>Gregory to Januarius, a Bishop of Sardinia.

<span id="ii.v.iv-p4"></span>We knew before the letter of your
Fraternity reached us what our enemies had effected in Sardinia.  And,
having for some time feared that this would be so, we now groan with you
on what we foresaw having come to pass.  But, if attention had been paid
to what we wrote to our most excellent son Gennadius <span
id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) , as well as to yourself, telling you that
this would be so, the enemy would either not have come into your
regions, or, when they came, they would have incurred the danger which
they have caused.  Even now, then, let what has happened sharpen your
vigilance for the future.  For we, too, by no means omit whatever we are
able to do for good, the Lord helping us.

<span id="ii.v.iv-p6"></span>Know, moreover, that the abbot <span
id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) whom, now a considerable time ago, we sent
to Agilulph, has by the mercy of God arranged a peace with him, so far
as was directed in writing by the most excellent Exarch.  And so, till
such time as the agreements for the confirmation of this peace shall be
drawn up, lest perchance our enemies during the present delay should be
inclined to come again into those parts, do you cause watches of the
walls to be kept up, and careful attention given in all places.  And we
trust in the power of our Redeemer that the incursions or plots of our
adversaries will not injure you anew.

<span id="ii.v.iv-p8"></span>As to your saying in your letter that many
persons lay complaints against you before us, this is true; but among
various things nothing has distressed us so much as what our most
beloved son, the abbot Cyriacus, has reported to us; namely, that on the
Lord’s day before mass you caused a crop of corn to be ploughed up in
the field which is in the possession of Donatus, and, as if that were
not enough, went, after the sacrifice was finished, in person to the
place, and dug up the boundaries <span id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) . 
For this reason I exhort thee to consider with anxious attention the
office which thou bearest, and to avoid entirely whatever may injure thy
reputation or thy soul, and let no one persuade thee to do the like
again.  For know that thou hast not undertaken the care of earthly
things, but the leadership of souls.  On this, therefore, thou oughtest
to fix thy heart, thy anxiety, thy entire devotion., and to give thy
diligent thought to the winning of souls, that when thou shalt render to
the Lord at His coming the talents that He has delivered to thee
multiplied, thou mayest be counted worthy to receive from Him the fruit
of retribution, and to be exalted among His faithful servants in eternal
glory.  Know, however, that what I now say in the way of reproach or
blame comes not from asperity, but from brotherly love, since I desire
thee to be found a priest before Almighty God, not in name only, which
tends only to punishment, but also in desert, which looks to
recompense.  For, we being one member in the body of our Redeemer, as I
am rent asunder in thy fault, so also am I rejoiced in thy good conduct.

<span id="ii.v.iv-p10"></span><span id="page_3">p. 3</span> <span
id="ii.v.iv-Page_3"></span>Furthermore, with regard to your desire that
we should depute a person from our side (*a nostro latere*), to whom you
may communicate in detail the cases that are to be referred to us, write
whatever you will to our most beloved son Peter and to Theodore the
counsellor (*consiliario*), that, when it has been communicated to us
through them, whatever reason may commend may be settled, the Lord
revealing the way.  Moreover, concerning our brother and fellow-bishop
Marinianus <span id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) , cognizance will be taken,
when peace with the aforesaid Agilulph shall have been fully confirmed,
and whatever the order of reason may dictate will be done.
