<span id="ii.ix.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.ix.iii-p1.1"></span>Epistle VI.</span>

<span id="ii.ix.iii-p2"></span>*To Brunichild, Queen of the
Franks* <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md) .

<span id="ii.ix.iii-p4"></span>Gregory to Brunichild, &c.

<span id="ii.ix.iii-p5"></span>Among other excellencies in you this
holds the chief place beyond the rest, that in the midst of the waves of
this world, which are wont with turbulent vexation to confound the minds
of rulers, you so bring back your heart to the love of divine worship
and to providing for the quiet of venerable places as if no other care
troubled you.  Whence, since conduct of this kind on the part of
potentates is wont to be a great defence to subjects, we declare the
nation of the Franks happy beyond other nations, having been accounted
worthy to have a queen thus endowed with all good qualities.

<span id="ii.ix.iii-p6"></span>On learning from the information
contained in your letters that you have built the Church of Saint Martin
in the suburbs of Augustodunum (*Autun*), and a monastery for
hand-maidens of God, and also a hospital in the same city, we rejoiced
greatly, and returned thanks to Almighty God, who stimulates the
sincerity of your heart to the doing of these things.  In this case,
that we may be held to some degree sharers in your good deeds, we have
granted privileges according to your wish, to those places for the quiet
and protection of those who live in them; nor have we borne to defer
even in the least degree our embracing of your Excellency’s desires.

<span id="ii.ix.iii-p7"></span>Furthermore, addressing you in the first
place with the greeting of paternal charity, we inform you that to our
illustrious sons, but <span id="page_94">p. 94</span> <span
id="ii.ix.iii-Page_94"></span>your servants and legates, Burgoaldus and
Varmaricarius, we have granted a private interview in accordance with
what you wrote to us; and they have disclosed to us in detail all that
they said they had been charged with.  It will be our care in time to
come to inform your Excellency of whatever is done with regard to these
things.  For, as for us, whatever is possible, whatever is profitable,
and tends to the settlement of peace between you and the republic, we
desire, under God, with the utmost devotion, that it should be
accomplished.

<span id="ii.ix.iii-p8"></span>As to Mennas, our most reverend brother
and fellow-bishop, after we had enquired into what had been said about
him, and found him in no way culpable, and he having made satisfaction
under oath before the most sacred body of the blessed apostle Peter, and
so proved himself to be unaffected by what had been objected against his
reputation, we have allowed him to return to his post purged and
acquitted, since, as it was right, if he were in any respect guilty,
that we should punish his fault canonically, so it was not right when he
had the support of innocence, that we should detain him longer, or any
way distress him.

<span id="ii.ix.iii-p9"></span>Moreover, with respect to a certain
bishop who, as the aforesaid magnificent men have told us, is prevented
by infirmity of the head from administering his office, we have written
to our brother and fellow-bishop Etherius <span
id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md) , that if he should have intervals of
freedom from this infirmity, he should make petition, declaring that he
is not competent to fill his own place, and requesting that another be
ordained to his Church.  For during the life of a bishop, whom not his
own fault but sickness, withdraws from the administration of his office,
the sacred canons by no means allow another to be ordained in his
place.  But, if he at no time recovers the exercise of a sound mind, a
person should be sought adorned with good life and conversation, who may
be able both to take charge of souls, and look with salutary control
after the causes and interests of the same church; and he should be such
as may succeed to the bishop’s place in case of his surviving him.  But,
if there are any to be promoted to a sacred order, or to any clerical
ministry, we have ordained that the matter is to be reserved and
announced to our aforesaid most reverend brother Etherius, provided it
belong to his diocese <span id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) , so that,
enquiry having then been made, if the persons are subject to no fault
which the sacred canons denounce, he himself may ordain them.  Let,
then, the care of your Excellency conjoin itself with our ordering, to
the end that the interests of the Church, which you have exceedingly at
heart, may not suffer damage, and that increase of reward may accrue to
the good deeds of your Excellency.

<span id="ii.ix.iii-p12"></span>Having been asked likewise concerning a
certain bigamist whether he might be admitted to a sacred order, we
have, according to canonical rule, altogether forbidden it.  For God
forbid that in your times, in which you do so many pious and religious
things, you should allow anything to be done contrary to ecclesiastical
ordinance.

<span id="ii.ix.iii-p13"></span>Moreover the aforesaid magnificent men,
our sons, having delivered us a schedule, have requested among other
things, what they said had been enjoined on them by your order, that
such a person may be sent from us into Gaul as may, on the assembling of
a synod, correct under the guidance of Almighty God whatever has been
perpetrated against the most sacred canons.  Herein we recognize the
care of your Glory, how you take thought for the life of the soul and
the stability of your kingdom, seeing that, fearing our Redeemer, and
observing His precepts in all ways, you act in this case also so that
the government of your kingdom may long subsist, and that after long
courses of years you also may pass from an earthly to a heavenly
kingdom.  At a fitting time, if what we have said should be pleasing to
God, we will take care to fulfil the venerable desires of your
Excellency.

<span id="ii.ix.iii-p14"></span>We, then, for the defence of the places
about which your Excellency has written to us have been careful to order
all things as you wish.  But, lest haply our decrees should be
suppressed at any time by the governors of those places on the ground
that they are found to be interdicted from doing certain things, this
same ordinance must be inserted among the public acts, that so it may be
kept in your royal archives as well as in ours.

<span id="ii.ix.iii-p15"></span>May Almighty God ever keep your
Excellency in His fear, and so fulfil your desires and those of our sons
the most excellent kings your grandsons, through the intercession of the
blessed Peter, Prince of the apostles, to whom you commend them, as to
grant you to have stable joy in their continual welfare, as you desire. 
Given in the month of November, Indiction 6.

<span id="ii.ix.iii-p3"></span> On Brunechild, see VI. 5, note 4. 
Having after the death of her son Childebert II. acted as guardian of
his son Theodebert II., who had received the kingdom of Austrasia with
his Capital at Metz, she had been expelled by the Austrasians in the
year 599, and been received by her other grandson, Theoderic II., who
reigned over Burgundy with his Capital at Orleans.  When this letter was
sent (<span class="sc"><span id="ii.ix.iii-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 602)
Theoderic would be about fifteen years of age, and, as appears from the
letter to himself which follows, under the management of his
grandmother.
