<span id="iii.v.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.v.xi-p1.1"></span>Hymn X.</span>

<span id="iii.v.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.xi-p2.1"></span>In</span> Thee will I begin to speak, Thou
Head that didst begin all created things. <span
id="fr_470"></span>[471](#fn_470)   I, even I will open my mouth, but it
is Thou that fillest my mouth. <span id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471)  
I am the earth to Thee, and Thou art the husbandman.  Sow Thy voice in
me, <span id="fr_472"></span>[473](#fn_472) Thou that sowedst Thyself in
the womb of thy Mother.

<span id="iii.v.xi-p6"></span>“All the chaste daughters of the
Hebrews, <span id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473) and the virgins’
daughters of the chief men, are astonished at me!  For Thee doth the
daughter of the poor meet with envy, for Thee, the daughter of the weak
with jealousy.  Who hath given Thee to me?

<span id="iii.v.xi-p8"></span>“O Son of the Rich One, Who abhorred the
bosom of the rich women, who led Thee to the poor? for Joseph was needy
and I also in want, yet Thy merchants have come, and brought gold, to
the house of the poor.”

<span id="iii.v.xi-p9"></span>She saw the Magi:  her songs increased at
their offerings; “Lo! Thy worshippers have surrounded me, yea thy
offerings have encircled me.  Blessed be the Babe who made His Mother a
harp for His words:

<span id="iii.v.xi-p10"></span>“And as the harp waiteth for its master,
my mouth waiteth for Thee.  May the tongue of Thy Mother bring what
pleases Thee; and since I have learnt a new Conception by Thee, let my
mouth learn in Thee, O new born Son, a new song of praise.

<span id="iii.v.xi-p11"></span>“And if hindrances are no hindrances to
Thee, since difficulties are easy to Thee, as a womb without marriage
conceived Thee, and a belly without seed brought Thee forth, it is easy
for a little mouth to multiply Thy great glory.

<span id="iii.v.xi-p12"></span>“Lo! I am oppressed and despised, and yet
cheerful:  mine ears are filled with reproof and scorn; and it is a
small thing to me to bear, for ten thousand troubles can a single
comfort of Thine chase away.

<span id="iii.v.xi-p13"></span>“And since I am not despised by Thee, O
Son, my countenance is bright; and I am slandered for having conceived,
and yet have brought forth the Truth who justifies me.  For if Tamar was
justified by Judah, how much more shall I be justified by Thee!”

<span id="iii.v.xi-p14"></span>David Thy father sung in a psalm of Thee
before Thou hadst come, that to Thee should be given the gold of
Sheba. <span id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474)   This psalm that he sung
of Thee, lo! it, whilst Thou art yet a child, in reality heaps before
thee myrrh and gold.

<span id="iii.v.xi-p16"></span><span id="page_245">p. 245</span> <span
id="iii.v.xi-Page_245"></span>And the hundred and fifty Psalms that he
wrote, in Thee were seasoned, because all the sayings of prophecy stood
in need of Thy sweetness, for without Thy salt all manner of wisdom were
tasteless. <span id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475)
