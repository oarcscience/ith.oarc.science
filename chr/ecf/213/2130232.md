<span id="iii.v.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.v.vii-p1.1"></span>Hymn VI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii-p2.1"></span>Blessed</span> be the Messenger that was
laden, and came; a great peace!  The Bowels of the Father brought Him
down to us; He did not bring up our debts to Him, but made a
satisfaction to that Majesty with His own goods.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p3"></span>Praised be the Wise One, who reconciled
and joined the Divine with the Human Nature.  One from above and one
from below, He confined the Natures as medicines, and being the Image of
God, became man.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p4"></span>That Jealous One when He saw that Adam
was dust, and that the cursed serpent had devoured him, shed soundness
into that which was tasteless, and made him \[as\] salt, wherewith the
accursed serpent should be blinded.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p5"></span>Blessed be the Merciful One, who saw the
weapon by Paradise, that closed the way to the Tree of Life; and came
and took a Body which could suffer, that with the Door, that was in His
side, He might open the way into Paradise.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p6"></span>Blessed be that Merciful One, who lent
not Himself to harshness, but without constraint conquered by wisdom;
that He might give an ensample unto men, that by virtue and wisdom they
might conquer discerningly.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p7"></span>Blessed is Thy flock, since Thou art the
gate thereof, and Thou art the staff thereof.  Thou art the Shepherd
thereof, Thou art the Drink thereof, Thou art the salt thereof, yea, the
Visitor thereof.  Hail to the Only-Begotten, that bare abundantly all
manner of consolations!

<span id="iii.v.vii-p8"></span>The husbandmen came and did obeisance
before the Husbandman of Life.  They prophesied to Him as they rejoiced,
\[saying,\] “Blessed be the Husbandman, by Whom the ground of the heart
is tilled, Who gathereth His wheat into the garner of Life.”

<span id="iii.v.vii-p9"></span>The husbandmen came and gave glory to the
Vineyard that sprang of the root and <span id="page_239">p. 239</span>
<span id="iii.v.vii-Page_239"></span>stem of Jesse, the Virgin Cluster
of the glorious Vine.  “May we be vessels for Thy new Wine that renews
all things.”

<span id="iii.v.vii-p10"></span>“In Thee may the Vineyard of my
Well-beloved that yielded wild grapes <span
id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md) find peace!  Graft its vines from Thy
stocks; let it be laden entirely from Thy blessings with a fruit which
may reconcile the Lord of the Vineyard, Who threatens it.”

<span id="iii.v.vii-p12"></span>Because of Joseph the workmen came to
the Son of Joseph saying, “Blessed be Thy Nativity, Thou Head of
Workmen, the impress whereof the ark bore, after which was fashioned the
Tabernacle of the congregation that was for a time only!” <span
id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md)

<span id="iii.v.vii-p14"></span>“Our craft praises Thee, Who art our
glory.  Make Thou the yoke which is light, yea easy, for them that bear
it; make the measure, in which there can be no falseness, which is full
of Truth; yea, devise and make measures <span
id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452.md) by righteousness; that he that is vile
may be accused thereby, and he that is perfect, may be acquitted
thereby.  Weigh therewith both mercy and truth, O just One, as a judge.”

<span id="iii.v.vii-p16"></span>“Bridegrooms with their brides
rejoiced.  Blessed be the Babe, whose Mother was Bride of the Holy One! 
Blessed the marriage feast, whereat Thou wast present, in which when
wine was suddenly wanting, in Thee it abounded again!”

<span id="iii.v.vii-p17"></span>The children cried out, “Blessed He that
hath become unto us a Brother, and Companion in the midst of the
streets.  Blessed be the day which by the Branches <span
id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453.md) gives glory to the Tree of life, that
made His Majesty be brought low, to our childish age!”

<span id="iii.v.vii-p19"></span>Women heard that a Virgin should
conceive and bring forth a Son:  honourable women hoped that thou
wouldest rise from them; yea noble ladies that Thou mightest spring up
from them!  Blessed be Thy Majesty, that humbled Itself, and rose from
the poor!

<span id="iii.v.vii-p20"></span>Yea the young girls that carried Him
prophesied, saying, “Whether I be hated or fair, or of low estate, I am
without spot for Thee.  I have taken Thee in charge for the bed of
Childbirth.”

<span id="iii.v.vii-p21"></span>Sarah had lulled Isaac, who as a
slave <span id="fr_454"></span>[455](#fn_454.md) bare the Image of the King
his Master on his shoulders, even the sign of His Cross; yea, on his
hands were bandages and sufferings, a type of the nails.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p23"></span>Rachel cried to her husband, and said,
Give me sons. <span id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455.md)   Blessed be Mary,
in whose womb, though she asked not, Thou didst dwell holily, O Gift,
that poured itself upon them that received it.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p25"></span>Hannah with bitter tears asked a
child; <span id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456.md) Sarah and Rebecca with
vows and words, Elizabeth also with her prayer, after having vexed
themselves for a long time, yet so obtained comfort.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p27"></span>Blessed be Mary, who without vows and
without prayer, in her Virginity conceived and brought forth the Lord of
all the sons of her companions, who have been or shall be chaste and
righteous, priests and kings.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p28"></span>Who else lulled a son in her bosom as
Mary did? who ever dared to call her son, Son of the Maker, Son of the
Creator, Son of the Most High?

<span id="iii.v.vii-p29"></span><span id="page_240">p. 240</span> <span
id="iii.v.vii-Page_240"></span>Who ever dared to speak to her son as in
prayer?  O Trust of Thy Mother as God, her Beloved and her Son as Man,
in fear and love it is meet for thy Mother to stand before Thee!

<span id="iii.v.vii-p13"></span> So too St. E. himself upon [Exodus
xxxvii.](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#000.md)<span
id="iii.v.vii-p13.1"></span>  “And Bezaleel made an ark of undecaying
wood, a type of the Body of Immanuel, which is incorruptible, and not
soiled by sin.  By the gold within and without he indicates the Divine
Nature of the Word, which was united unto all the functions (S. vessels)
of the Soul and the Body in a manner no discourse can reach, seeing he
anointed our manhood with His Godhead.”  These words appear to make it
plain, that St. E. means the same *ark* above as in this passage; he,
however, uses a different word, and one which others contend is only
applied to Noah’s ark.
