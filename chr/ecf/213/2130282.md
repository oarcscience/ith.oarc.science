<span id="iii.ix.v-p1"></span> *<span class="c1"><span
id="iii.ix.v-p1.1"></span>Demonstration VI.</span>*<span
class="c1"><span id="iii.ix.v-p1.2"></span>—<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ix.v-p1.3"></span>Of</span> <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ix.v-p1.4"></span>Monks</span>.</span>

<span id="iii.ix.v-p2"></span>1.  Expedient is the word that I speak and
worthy of acceptance:—*Let us now awake from our sleep*, <span
id="fr_824"></span>[825](#fn_824.md) and lift up both our hearts and hands
to God towards heaven; lest suddenly the Lord of the house come, that
*when He comes He may find us in watchfulness*. <span
id="fr_825"></span>[826](#fn_825.md)   Let us observe the appointed time of
the glorious bridegroom, <span id="fr_826"></span>[827](#fn_826.md) that we
may enter with Him into His bride-chamber.  Let us prepare oil for our
lamps that we may go forth to meet Him with joy.  Let us make ready
provision for our abiding-place, for the way that is narrow and strait. 
And let us put away and cast from us all uncleanness, and put on wedding
garments.  Let us trade with the silver that we have received, <span
id="fr_827"></span>[828](#fn_827.md) that we may be called diligent
servants.  Let us be constant in prayer, that we may pass by the place
where fear dwells.  Let us cleanse our heart from iniquity, that we may
see the Lofty One in His honour.  Let us be merciful, as it is written,
that God may have mercy upon us. <span id="fr_828"></span>[829](#fn_828.md)
  Let there be peace amongst us, that we may be called the brethren of
Christ.  Let us hunger for righteousness, that we may be satisfied <span
id="fr_829"></span>[830](#fn_829.md) from the table of His Kingdom.  Let us
be the salt of truth, that we may not become food for the serpent.  Let
us purge our seed from thorns, that we may produce fruit a
hundred-fold.  Let us found our building on the rock, <span
id="fr_830"></span>[831](#fn_830.md) that it may not be shaken by the winds
and waves.  Let us be vessels unto honour <span
id="fr_831"></span>[832](#fn_831.md) that we may be required by the Lord
for His use.  Let us sell all our possessions, and buy for ourselves the
pearl, <span id="fr_832"></span>[833](#fn_832.md) that we may be rich.  Let
us lay up our treasures in heaven, <span
id="fr_833"></span>[834](#fn_833.md) that when we come we may open them and
have pleasure in them.  Let us visit our Lord in the persons of the
sick, <span id="fr_834"></span>[835](#fn_834.md) that He may invite us to
stand at His right hand.  Let us hate ourselves and love Christ, as He
loved us and gave Himself up for our sakes. <span
id="fr_835"></span>[836](#fn_835.md)   Let us honour the spirit of Christ,
that we may receive grace from Him.  Let us be strangers to the
world, <span id="fr_836"></span>[837](#fn_836.md) even as Christ was not of
it.  Let us be humble and mild, that we may inherit the land of life. 
Let us be unflagging in His service, that He may cause us to serve in
the abode of the saints.  Let us pray His prayer in purity, that it may
have access to the Lord of <span id="page_363">p. 363</span> <span
id="iii.ix.v-Page_363"></span>Majesty.  Let us be partakers in His
suffering, that so we may also rise up in His resurrection. <span
id="fr_837"></span>[838](#fn_837.md)   Let us bear His sign upon our
bodies, that we may be delivered from the wrath to come.  For fearful is
the day in which He will come, and who is able to endure it? <span
id="fr_838"></span>[839](#fn_838.md)   Furious and hot is His wrath, and it
will destroy all the wicked.  Let us set upon our head the helmet of
redemption, <span id="fr_839"></span>[840](#fn_839.md) that we may not be
wounded and die in the battle.  Let us gird our loins with truth, that
we may not be found impotent in the contest.  Let us arise and awaken
Christ, that He may still the stormy blasts from us.  Let us take as a
shield against the Evil One, the preparation of the Gospel of our
Redeemer.  Let us receive power from our Lord to tread upon snakes and
scorpions. <span id="fr_840"></span>[841](#fn_840.md)   Let us lay aside
from us wrath, with all fury and malice.  Let no reviling proceed out of
our mouth, with which we pray unto God.  Let us not be cursers, that we
may be delivered from the curse of the law.  Let us be diligent workers,
that we may obtain our reward with those of old.  Let us take up the
burden of the day, that we may seek a more abundant reward.  Let us not
be idle workers, for lo! our Lord has hired us for His vineyard. <span
id="fr_841"></span>[842](#fn_841.md)   Let us be planted as vines in the
midst of His vineyard, for it is the true vineyard.  Let us be fruitful
vines, that we may not be uprooted out of His vineyard.  Let us be a
sweet odour, that our fragrance may breathe forth to all around.  Let us
be poor in the world, and let us enrich many by the doctrine of our
Lord.  Let us not call anyone our father in the earth, <span
id="fr_842"></span>[843](#fn_842.md) that we may be the children of the
Father which is in heaven.  Though we have nothing, yet we possess all
things. <span id="fr_843"></span>[844](#fn_843.md)   Though no man know us,
yet they that have knowledge of us are many.  Let us rejoice in our hope
at every time, <span id="fr_844"></span>[845](#fn_844.md) that He Who is
our hope and our Redeemer may rejoice in us.  Let us judge ourselves
righteously and condemn ourselves, that we may not hang down our faces
before the judges who shall sit upon thrones and judge the tribes. <span
id="fr_845"></span>[846](#fn_845.md)   Let us take to ourselves, as armour
for the contest, <span id="fr_846"></span>[847](#fn_846.md) the preparation
of the Gospel.  Let us knock at the door of heaven, <span
id="fr_847"></span>[848](#fn_847.md) that it may be opened before us, and
we may enter in through it.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p27"></span>Let us diligently ask for mercy, that we
may receive whatsoever is necessary for us.  Let us seek His Kingdom and
His righteousness, <span id="fr_848"></span>[849](#fn_848.md) that we may
receive increase in the land.  Let us think upon the things which are
above, <span id="fr_849"></span>[850](#fn_849.md) on the heavenly things,
and meditate on them, where Christ has been lifted up and exalted.  But
let us forsake the world which is not ours, that we may arrive at the
place to which we have been invited.  Let us raise up our eyes on high,
that we may see the splendour which shall be revealed.  Let us lift up
our wings as eagles, that we may see the body there where it is.  Let us
prepare as offerings for the King desirable fruits, fasting and prayer. 
Let us guard His pledge in purity, that He may trust us over all His
treasury.  For whosoever deals falsely with His pledge, they suffer him
not to enter into the treasure-house.  Let us be careful of the body of
Christ, that our bodies may rise at the sound of the trumpet.  Let us
hearken to the voice of the bridegroom, that we may go in with Him into
the bride-chamber.  Let us prepare the marriage-gift for His bridal day,
and let us go forth to meet Him with joy.  Let us put on holy raiment,
that we may recline in the chief place of the elect.  Whosoever puts not
on wedding raiment, <span id="fr_850"></span>[851](#fn_850.md) they cast
him out into outer darkness.  Whosoever excuses himself from the wedding
shall not taste the feast. <span id="fr_851"></span>[852](#fn_851.md)  
Whosoever loves fields and merchandise, shall be shut out of the city of
Saints.  Whosoever does not bear fruit in the vineyard, shall be
uprooted and cast out to torment.  Whosoever has re<span
id="page_364">p. 364</span> <span id="iii.ix.v-Page_364"></span>ceived
money from his Lord, let him return it to its Giver with its
increase. <span id="fr_852"></span>[853](#fn_852.md)   Whosoever desires to
become a merchant, let, him buy for himself the field and the treasure
that is in it. <span id="fr_853"></span>[854](#fn_853.md)   Whosoever
receives the good seed, let him purge his land from thorns. <span
id="fr_854"></span>[855](#fn_854.md)   Whosoever desires to be a fisherman,
let him cast forth his net at every time.  Whosoever is training for the
conflict, let him keep himself from the world.  Whosoever wishes to gain
the crown, let him run as a winner in the race.  Whosoever wishes to go
down into the course to contend, let him learn to (contend) against his
adversary.  Whosoever wishes to go down to the battle, let him take unto
him armour wherewith to fight, and let him purify himself at every
time.  Whosoever adopts the likeness of angels, let him be a stranger to
men.  Whosoever takes upon him the yoke of the saints, let him remove
from him getting and spending.  Whosoever desires to gain himself, let
him remove from him the gain of the world.  Whosoever loves the abode
that is in heaven, let him not toil at the building of clay that will
fall.  Whosoever is expectant of being caught up in the clouds, let him
not make for himself adorned chariots.  Whosoever is expectant of the
marriage-feast of the Bridegroom, let him not love the feast of this
present time.  Whosoever wishes to have pleasure in the banquet reserved
there, let him remove drunkenness from himself.  Whosoever prepares
himself for the supper, let him not excuse himself, <span
id="fr_855"></span>[856](#fn_855.md) nor be a merchant.  Whosoever he be on
whom the good seed falls, let him not allow the Evil One to sow tares in
him.  Whosoever has begun to build a tower, let him count up all the
cost thereof. <span id="fr_856"></span>[857](#fn_856.md)   Whosoever builds
ought to finish, that he be not a laughing-stock to them that pass by
the way.  Whosoever sets his building on the rock, let him make its
foundations deep, that it may not be cast down by the billows. 
Whosoever wishes to fly from the darkness, let him walk while he has
light. <span id="fr_857"></span>[858](#fn_857.md)   Whosoever fears to fly
in winter, <span id="fr_858"></span>[859](#fn_858.md) let him prepare
himself from the summer-time.  Whosoever looks forward to enter into
rest, <span id="fr_859"></span>[860](#fn_859.md) let him make ready his
provision for the Sabbath.  Whosoever begs forgiveness of his Lord, let
him also forgive his debtor. <span id="fr_860"></span>[861](#fn_860.md)  
Whosoever does not demand back a hundred dinars, his Lord forgives him
ten thousand talents.  Whosoever casts down his Lord’s money on the
banker’s table, <span id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861.md) will not be
called an unprofitable servant.  Whosoever loves humility, shall be heir
in the land of life.  Whosoever wishes to make peace, shall be one of
the sons of God. <span id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862.md)   Whosoever
knows the will of his Lord, let him do that will, that he may not be
beaten much. <span id="fr_863"></span>[864](#fn_863.md)   Whosoever
cleanses his heart from deceits, *His eyes shall behold the King in his
beauty*. <span id="fr_864"></span>[865](#fn_864.md)   Whosoever receives
the Spirit of Christ, let him adorn his inner man.  Whosoever is called
the temple of God, <span id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865.md) let him
purify his body from all uncleanness.  Whosoever grieves the Spirit of
Christ, <span id="fr_866"></span>[867](#fn_866.md) shall not raise up his
head from griefs.  Whosoever receives the body of Christ, let him keep
his body from all uncleanness.  Whosoever casts off the *old man*, <span
id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867.md) let him not turn back to his former
works.  Whosoever puts on the *new man,* let him keep himself from all
filthiness.  Whosoever has put on armour from the water (of baptism),
let him not put off his armour that he may not be condemned.  Whosoever
takes up the shield <span id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868.md) against the
Evil One, let him keep himself from the darts which he hurls at him. 
Whosoever shall *draw back*, his Lord *has no pleasure in him*. <span
id="fr_869"></span>[870](#fn_869.md)   Whosoever thinks upon the Law of his
Lord, shall not be troubled with the thoughts of this world.  Whosoever
meditates on the Law of his Lord, is like a tree planted by the
waters. <span id="fr_870"></span>[871](#fn_870.md)   Whosoever again has
trust in his Lord, is like a tree that is set out by the river. 
Whosoever puts his trust in man <span id="page_365">p. 365</span> <span
id="iii.ix.v-Page_365"></span>shall receive the curses of
Jeremiah. <span id="fr_871"></span>[872](#fn_871.md)   Whosoever is invited
to the Bridegroom, let him prepare himself.  Whosoever has lighted his
lamp, let him not suffer it to go out.  Whosoever is expectant of the
marriage-cry, let him take oil in his vessel. <span
id="fr_872"></span>[873](#fn_872.md)   Whosoever is keeper of the door, let
him be on the watch for his Master.  Whosoever loves virginity, let him
become like Elijah.  Whosoever takes up the yoke of the Saints, let him
sit and be silent.  Whosoever loves peace, let him look for his Master
as the hope of life.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p53"></span>2.  For, my beloved, our adversary is
skilful.  He that contends against us is crafty.  Against the brave and
the renowned does he prepare himself, that they may be weakened.  For
the feeble are his own, nor does he fight with the captivity that are
made captive to him.  He that has wings flees from him and the darts
that he hurls at him do not reach him.  They that are spiritual see him
when he assails, and his panoply has no power upon their bodies.  All
the children of light are without fear of him, because the darkness
flies from before the light.  The children of the Good fear not the
Evil, for He hath given him to be trampled by their feet.  When he makes
himself like darkness unto them, they become light.  And when he creeps
upon them like a serpent, they become salt, whereof he cannot eat.  If
he makes himself like the asp unto them, then they become like babes. 
If he comes in upon them in the lust of food, they, like our Redeemer,
conquer him by fasting.  And if he wishes to contend with them by the
lust of the eyes, they lift up their eyes to the height of heaven.  If
he wishes by enticements to overcome them, they do not afford him a
hearing.  If he wishes openly to strive with them, lo! they are clothed
in panoply and stand up against him.  If he wishes to come in against
them by sleep, they are wakeful and vigilant and sing psalms and pray. 
If he allures them by possessions, they give them to the poor.  If he
comes in as sweetness against them, they taste it not, knowing that he
is bitter.  If he inflames them with the desire of Eve, they dwell
alone, and not with the daughters of Eve.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p54"></span>3.  For it was through Eve that he came
in upon Adam, <span id="fr_873"></span>[874](#fn_873.md) and Adam was
enticed because of his inexperience.  And again he came in against
Joseph through his master’s wife, <span
id="fr_874"></span>[875](#fn_874.md) but Joseph was acquainted with his
craftiness and would not afford him a hearing.  Through a woman he
fought with Samson, <span id="fr_875"></span>[876](#fn_875.md) until he
took away his Nazariteship.  Reuben was the first-born of all his
brethren, and through his father’s wife, <span
id="fr_876"></span>[877](#fn_876) (the adversary.md) cast a blemish upon
him.  Aaron was the great high-priest of the house of Israel, and
through Miriam <span id="fr_877"></span>[878](#fn_877.md) his sister he
envied Moses.  Moses was sent to deliver the people from Egypt, and took
with him the woman who advised him to shameful acts, <span
id="fr_878"></span>[879](#fn_878.md) and the Lord met with Moses, and
desired to slay him, till he sent back his wife to Midian.  David was
victorious in all his battles, yet through means of a daughter of
Eve <span id="fr_879"></span>[880](#fn_879.md) there was found a blemish in
him.  Amnon was beautiful and fair in countenance, yet (the adversary)
took him captive by desire for his sister, <span
id="fr_880"></span>[881](#fn_880.md) and Absalom slew him on account of the
humbling of Tamar.  Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth,
yet in the days of his old age his wives led his heart astray. <span
id="fr_881"></span>[882](#fn_881.md)   Through Jezebel, daughter of
Ethbaal, the wickedness of Ahab was increased, <span
id="fr_882"></span>[883](#fn_882.md) and he became altogether a heathen. 
Furthermore, the adversary tempted Job through his children and his
possessions, <span id="fr_883"></span>[884](#fn_883.md) and when he could
not prevail over him, he went and brought against him his armour, and he
came, bringing with him a daughter of Eve, who had caused Adam to sink,
and through her mouth he said to Job, her righteous husband:—*Curse
God*. <span id="fr_884"></span>[885](#fn_884.md)   But Job rejected her
counsel.  King <span id="page_366">p. 366</span> <span
id="iii.ix.v-Page_366"></span>Asa also conquered the Accursed-of-life,
when he wished to come in against him, through his mother. <span
id="fr_885"></span>[886](#fn_885.md)   For Asa knew his craftiness and
removed his mother from her high estate, and cut in pieces her idol and
cast it down.  John was greater than all the prophets, yet Herod slew
him because of the dancing of a daughter of Eve. <span
id="fr_886"></span>[887](#fn_886.md)   Haman was wealthy and third in
honour from the King, yet his wife counselled him to destroy the
Jews. <span id="fr_887"></span>[888](#fn_887.md)   Zimri was head of the
tribe of Simeon, yet Cozbi, daughter of the chiefs of Midian, overthrew
him, and because of one woman twenty-four thousand of Israel fell in one
day. <span id="fr_888"></span>[889](#fn_888.md)

<span id="iii.ix.v-p71"></span>4.  Therefore, my brethren, if any man
who is a monk or a saint, who loves the solitary life, yet desires that
a woman, bound by monastic vow like himself, should dwell with him, it
would be better for him in that case to take (to wife) a woman openly
and not be made wanton by lust.  So also again the woman, if she be not
separated from the solitary, it is better for her to marry openly. 
Woman then ought to dwell with woman, and man to dwell with man.  And
also whatever man desires to continue in holiness, let not his spouse
dwell with him, lest he turn back to his former condition, and so be
esteemed an adulterer.  Therefore this counsel is becoming and right and
good, that I give to myself and you, my beloved solitaries, who do not
take wives, and to the virgins who do not marry, and to those who have
loved holiness.  It is just and right and becoming, that even if a man
should be distressed, he should continue alone.  And thus it becomes him
to dwell, as it is written in the Prophet Jeremiah:—*Blessed is the man
who shall take up Thy yoke in his youth, and sit alone and be silent,
because he has taken upon him Thy yoke*. <span
id="fr_889"></span>[890](#fn_889.md)   For thus, my beloved, it becomes him
who takes up the yoke of Christ, to preserve his yoke in purity.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p73"></span>5.  For thus it is written, my beloved,
concerning Moses, that from the time the Holy One was revealed to him,
he also loved holiness.  And from the time he was sanctified, his wife
ministered not to him.  But it is thus written:—*Joshua, the son of Nun,
was the minister of Moses from his childhood*. <span
id="fr_890"></span>[891](#fn_890.md)   And of Joshua again it is thus
written concerning him, that *he used not to depart from the
tabernacle*. <span id="fr_891"></span>[892](#fn_891.md)   And the temporal
tabernacle was not ministered to by a woman, because the Law did not
allow women to enter the temporal tabernacle, but even when they came to
pray, they used to pray at the door of the temporal tabernacle, and then
turn back.  Moreover, he commanded the Priests, that at the time of
their ministry they should continue in holiness, and should not know
their wives.  And also concerning Elijah it is thus written, that at one
time he dwelt in Mount Carmel, and at another he dwelt at the brook
Cherith, and was ministered to by his disciple; and because his heart
was in heaven, the bird of heaven used to bring sustenance to him; and
because he took upon him the likeness of the angels of heaven, those
very angels brought him bread and water when he was fleeing from before
Jezebel. <span id="fr_892"></span>[893](#fn_892.md)   And because he set
all his thought in heaven, he was caught up in the chariot of fire to
heaven, <span id="fr_893"></span>[894](#fn_893.md) and there his
dwelling-place was established for ever.  Elisha also walked in the
footsteps of his Master.  He used to dwell in the upper chamber of the
Shunamite, and was ministered to by his disciple.  For thus the
Shunamite said;—*He is a holy Prophet of God and passes by us
continually, for thus it becomes his holiness that we should make for
him an upper chamber and do for him the service that is (necessary) in
it*. <span id="fr_894"></span>[895](#fn_894.md)   Now what was the service
necessary in the upper chamber of Elisha?  Clearly the bed and table and
stool and lamp-stand only.  But what shall we say of John?  He also used
to dwell amongst men, and preserved his virginity honourably, and
received the Spirit of God.  More<span id="page_367">p. 367</span> <span
id="iii.ix.v-Page_367"></span>over, the blessed Apostle said concerning
himself and concerning Barnabas:—*Had we then not power to eat and to
drink and to lead about wives with us?  But it was not becoming or
right.* <span id="fr_895"></span>[896](#fn_895.md)

<span id="iii.ix.v-p80"></span>6.  Therefore, brethren, because we know
and have seen that from the beginning it was through woman that the
adversary had access unto men, and to the end he will accomplish it by
her—for she is the weapon of Satan, and through her he fights against
the champions.  Through her he makes music at every time, for she became
as a harp for him from the first day.  For because of her the curse of
the Law was established, and because of her the promise unto death was
made.  For with pangs she bears children and delivers them to death. 
Because of her the earth was cursed, that it should bring forth thorns
and tares.  Accordingly, by the coming of the offspring of the Blessed
Mary the thorns are uprooted, the sweat wiped away, the fig-tree
cursed, <span id="fr_896"></span>[897](#fn_896.md) the dust made
salt, <span id="fr_897"></span>[898](#fn_897.md) the curse nailed to the
cross, <span id="fr_898"></span>[899](#fn_898.md) the edge of the sword
removed from before the tree of life and it given as food to the
faithful, and Paradise promised to the blessed and to virgins and to the
saints.  So the fruit of the tree of life is given as food to the
faithful and to virgins, and to those that do the will of God has the
door been opened and the way made plain.  And the fountain flows and
gives drink to the thirsty.  The table is laid and the supper prepared. 
The fatted ox is slain and the cup of redemption mixed.  The feast is
prepared and the Bridegroom at hand, soon to take his place.  The
apostles have given the invitation and the called are very many.  O ye
chosen, prepare yourselves.  The light has shone forth both bright and
fair, and garments not made with hands are prepared.  The marriage cry
is at hand.  The tombs will be opened and the treasures laid bare.  The
dead shall rise and the living shall fly to meet the King.  The banquet
is laid, and the cornet shall encourage and the trumpets shall hasten
(them).  The Watchers of heaven shall speed, and the throne shall be set
for the Judge.  He that laboured shall rejoice, and he that was
unprofitable shall fear.  He that did evil shall not draw nigh unto the
Judge.  Those on the right hand shall exult, and those on the left shall
weep and wail.  Those that are in the light shall be glorified, and
those that are in the darkness shall groan that they may moisten their
tongue.  Grace has gone by, and justice reigns.  There is no repentance
in that place.  Winter is at hand; the summer has passed away.  The
Sabbath of rest has come; toil has ceased.  Night has passed away; the
light reigns.  As to death, its sting is broken and it is swallowed up
in life. <span id="fr_899"></span>[900](#fn_899.md)   Those that return to
Sheol shall weep and gnash their teeth, and those that go to the Kingdom
shall rejoice and exult and dance and sing praises.  For those that take
not wives shall be ministered to by the Watchers of heaven.  Those that
preserve chastity shall rest in the sanctuary of the Most High.  The
Only Begotten Who is from the bosom of His Father shall cause all the
solitaries to rejoice.  There is there neither male nor female, neither
bond nor free, <span id="fr_900"></span>[901](#fn_900.md) but they all are
the children of the Most High.  And all the pure virgins who are
betrothed to Christ shall light their lamps <span
id="fr_901"></span>[902](#fn_901.md) and with the Bridegroom shall they go
into the marriage chamber.  All those that are betrothed to Christ are
far removed from the curse of the Law, and are redeemed from the
condemnation of the daughters of Eve; for they are not wedded to men so
as to receive the curses and come into the pains.  They take no thought
of death, because they do not deliver children to him.  And in place of
a mortal husband, they are betrothed to Christ.  And *because they do
not bear children, there is Given to them the name that is better than
sons and daughters*. <span id="fr_902"></span>[903](#fn_902.md)   And
instead of the groans of the daughters of <span id="page_368">p.
368</span> <span id="iii.ix.v-Page_368"></span>Eve, they utter the songs
of the Bridegroom.  The wedding-feast of the daughters of Eve continues
for but seven days; but for these (virgins) is the Bridegroom who
departs not for ever.  The adornment of the daughters of Eve is wool
that wears out and perishes, but the garments of these wear not out. 
Old age withers the beauty of the daughters of Eve, but the beauty of
these shall be renewed in the time of the Resurrection.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p88"></span>7.  O ye virgins who have betrothed
yourselves to Christ, when one of the monks shall say to one of you, “I
will live with thee and minister thou to me,” thus shalt thou say unto
him:—“To a royal husband am I betrothed, and Him do I serve; and if I
leave His service and serve thee, my betrothed will be wroth with me,
and will write me a letter of divorce, and will send me away from His
house; and while thou seekest to be honoured by me, and I to be honoured
by thee, take heed lest hurt come upon me and thee.  Take not fire into
thy bosom, <span id="fr_903"></span>[904](#fn_903.md) lest it burn thy
garments; but be thou in honour alone, and I also alone will abide in my
honour.  And as concerning these things which the Bridegroom has
prepared for the eternity of his marriage feast, do thou make thee a
wedding-gift and prepare thyself to meet Him.  And as for me, I will
make me ready oil, that I may enter in with the wise virgins and may not
be kept outside the door with the foolish virgins.”

<span id="iii.ix.v-p90"></span>8.  Hearken then, my beloved, unto that
which I write unto thee, namely, whatsoever things become solitaries,
monks, virgins, saints.  Before all things it beseems the man on whom
the yoke is laid, that his faith should be firm; as I wrote to thee in
the first epistle; that he should be zealous in fasting and prayer; that
he should be fervent in the love of Christ; and should be humble and
mild and wise.  And let his speech be peaceful and pleasant, and his
thought be sincere with all.  Let him speak his words duly weighing
them, and set a barrier to his mouth from harmful words, and let him put
far from him hasty laughter.  Let him not love the adornment of
garments, nor again does it become him to let his hair grow long and
adorn it, or to anoint it with sweet-scented unguents.  Let him not
recline at feastings, nor does it become him to wear gorgeous apparel. 
Let him not dare to exceed at wine.  Let him put far from him proud
thoughts.  It does not become him to look upon gorgeous apparel, or to
wear fine raiment.  Let him put away from him a crafty tongue; let him
drive from him envy and wrath, and cast away from him crafty lips.  The
words that are spoken about a man, when he about whom they are spoken is
not near, let him not hear nor receive, that he sin not, until he search
them out.  Mockery is a hateful fault, and to bring it up upon the heart
is not right.  Let him not lend and take interest, and let him not love
avarice.  Let him suffer wrong and not do wrong.  Furthermore, let him
put away from him turmoil, and words of jesting let him not utter.  Let
him not scorn any man who is repenting of his sins, and let him not mock
his brother who is fasting, and him that cannot fast let him not put to
shame.  Where he is received, let him reprove, and where they receive
him not, let him understand his own honour.  In an acceptable time let
him speak his word; otherwise, let him be silent.  Let him not for his
belly’s sake make himself despised by his begging, and to such an one as
fears God let him reveal his secret; but let him keep himself from the
evil (man).  Let him not speak in complaisance with a wicked man, nor
with his enemy.  And so let him contend as to have no enemy at all. 
When men envy him in that which is good, let him add to his goodness,
and let him not be harmed because of envy.  When he has, and gives to
the poor, let him rejoice; and when he has not, let it not grieve him. 
With a wicked man let him have no converse and with a contemptuous man
let him not speak, lest he give himself to contempt.  With a blasphemer
let him not dispute, lest <span id="page_369">p. 369</span> <span
id="iii.ix.v-Page_369"></span>his Lord be blasphemed on his account. 
Let him depart from a slanderer, and let no man please another man with
speciousness of words.  These things beseem solitaries who take up the
heavenly yoke, and become disciples of Christ.  For thus it befits the
disciples of Christ to be like unto Christ their Master.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p91"></span>9.  Let us take pattern, my beloved, from
our Saviour, Who though He was rich, made Himself poor; <span
id="fr_904"></span>[905](#fn_904.md) and though He was lofty, humbled His
Majesty; and though His dwelling place was in heaven, He had no place to
lay His head; <span id="fr_905"></span>[906](#fn_905.md) and though He is
to come upon the clouds, <span id="fr_906"></span>[907](#fn_906.md) yet
rode on a colt and so entered Jerusalem; <span
id="fr_907"></span>[908](#fn_907.md) and though He is God and Son of God,
He took upon Him the likeness of a servant; <span
id="fr_908"></span>[909](#fn_908) and though He was (for others.md) rest
from all weariness, yet was Himself tired with the weariness of the
journey; though He was the fountain that quenches thirst, yet Himself
thirsted and asked for water; <span id="fr_909"></span>[910](#fn_909.md)
though He was abundance and satisfied our hunger, yet He Himself
hungered when He went forth to the wilderness to be tempted; <span
id="fr_910"></span>[911](#fn_910.md) though He was a Watcher that slumbers
not, He yet slumbered and slept in the ship in the midst of the
sea; <span id="fr_911"></span>[912](#fn_911.md) and though He was
ministered to in the Tabernacle of His Father, yet let Himself be served
by the hands of men; though He was the healer of all sick men, yet nails
were fastened into His hands; though His mouth brought forth things that
were good, yet they gave Him gall to eat; <span
id="fr_912"></span>[913](#fn_912.md) though He injured no man and harmed
none, yet He was beaten with stripes and endured shame; and though he
was Saviour of all mortals, He delivered Himself to the death of the
cross.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p101"></span>10.  All this humility did our Saviour
show us in Himself.  Let us then also humble ourselves, my beloved. 
When our Lord went outside of His nature, <span
id="fr_913"></span>[914](#fn_913.md) He walked in our nature.  Let us abide
in our nature, that in the day of judgment He may cause us to partake of
His nature.  Our Lord took from us a pledge when He went, and He left us
a pledge of His own when he ascended.  He that was without need, because
of our need devised this expedient.  What was ours was His even from the
beginning, but that which was His, who would have given us?  But true is
that which our Lord promised us:—*Where I am there ye also shall
be*. <span id="fr_914"></span>[915](#fn_914.md)   For whatsoever He took of
ours, is in honour with Him, and (as) a diadem is bound upon His Head. 
So also that, which of His we have received, we ought to honour.  That
which is ours is held in honour with Him who was not in our nature:  let
us honour that which is His in His own nature.  If we honour Him, we
shall go to Him, Who took upon Him of our nature and so ascended.  But
if we despise Him, He will take away from us that which He has given
us.  If we deal fraudulently with His pledge, He will there take away
that which is His, and will deprive us of all that He has promised us. 
Let us magnify gloriously the King’s Son Who is with us, because a
hostage for Him has been taken from us.  Whoso holds the King’s Son in
honour, shall obtain many gifts from the King.  That of ours, that is
with Him, has sat down in honour and a diadem is bound upon His head,
and He has sat down with the King.  And we who are poor, what shall we
do to the King’s Son Who is with us?  He needs nothing from us, but that
we should adorn our temples for Him; that when the time is accomplished
and He goes to His Father, He may give thanks to Him because of us,
because we have honoured Him.  When He came to us, He had nothing of
ours, and also we had nothing of His, though the two natures were His
and His Father’s.  For when Gabriel made announcement to the Blessed
Mary who bore Him, the word from on high set out and came, and *the word
became flesh and dwelt in us.* <span id="fr_915"></span>[916](#fn_915.md)  
And when He <span id="page_370">p. 370</span> <span
id="iii.ix.v-Page_370"></span>returned to Him that sent Him, He took
away, when He went, that which He had not brought, as the Apostle
said:—*He has taken us up and seated us with Himself in the
heavens*. <span id="fr_916"></span>[917](#fn_916.md)   And when He went to
His Father, He sent to us His Spirit and said to us *I am with you till
the world shall end.*  For Christ *sitteth at the right hand of His
Father,* and Christ *dwelleth among men*. <span
id="fr_917"></span>[918](#fn_917.md)   He is sufficient above and beneath,
by the wisdom of His Father.  And He dwells in many, though He is one,
and all the faithful each by each He overshadows from Himself, and fails
not, as it is written:—*I will divide Him among many*. <span
id="fr_918"></span>[919](#fn_918.md)   And though He is divided among many,
yet He sits at the right hand of His Father.  And He is in us and we are
in Him, as He said:—*Ye are in Me and I am in you*. <span
id="fr_919"></span>[920](#fn_919.md)   And in another place He said:—*I and
Father are one.* <span id="fr_920"></span>[921](#fn_920.md)

<span id="iii.ix.v-p110"></span>11.  And if anyone, whose conscience
lacks knowledge, should dispute about this and say:—“Since Christ is one
and His Father is one, how does Christ dwell, and His Father dwell, in
faithful men?  And how do righteous men become temples for God that He
should dwell in them?  If then it is thus, that to each several faithful
man there comes a several Christ, and God Who is in Christ,—if it is so,
there are for them Gods many and Christs without number.”  But hear, my
beloved, the defence that is suited to this argument.  From that which
is visible let him that has thus said receive instruction.  For every
man knows that the sun is fixed in the heavens, yet its rays are spread
out in the earth, and (light) from it enters by many doors and windows
of houses; and wherever the sunshine falls, though it be but as (the
measure of) the palm of the hand, it is called the sun.  And though it
fall in many places, it is thus called, but the real sun itself is in
heaven.  Therefore, if it is so, *have they* many suns?  Also the water
of the sea is vast, and when thou takest one cup from it, that is called
water.  And though thou shouldest divide it into a thousand vessels, yet
it is called water by its name.  Also when thou kindlest fire from fire
in many places, the place from whence thou takest it, when thou kindlest
it, lacks not, and the fire is called by one name.  And because thou
dividest it into many places, it does not on that account become
possessed of many names.  And when thou takest dust from the earth, and
castest it into many places, it is not a whit diminished, and also thou
canst not call it by many names.  Thus also God and His Christ, though
they are One, yet dwell in men who are many.  And they are in heaven in
person, and are diminished in nothing when they dwell in many; as the
sun is not a whit diminished in heaven, when its power is poured out in
the earth.  How much greater then is the power of God, since by the
power of God the very sun itself subsists.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p111"></span>12.  Again I will remind thee, my
beloved, also of that which is written.  For thus it is written, that
when it was a grievous burden to Moses to lead the camp alone, the Lord
said to him:—*Lo! will take away of the Spirit that is upon thee, and
will put it upon seventy men, elders of Israel*. <span
id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921.md)   But when He took away some of the
Spirit of Moses, and the seventy men were filled with it, Moses nothing
lacked, nor could it be known that anything was taken away from his
Spirit.  Moreover the blessed apostle also said:—*God divided of the
Spirit of Christ and sent it into the Prophets*. <span
id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922.md)   And Christ was in nothing injured,
for *it was not by measure that His Father gave unto Him the
Spirit*. <span id="fr_923"></span>[924](#fn_923.md)   By this reflection
thou canst comprehend that Christ dwells in faithful men; yet Christ
suffers no loss though He is divided among many.  For the Prophets
received of the Spirit of Christ, each one of them as he was able to
bear.  And of the Spirit of Christ again there is poured forth to-day
upon all flesh, <span id="fr_924"></span>[925](#fn_924.md) and the sons and
the <span id="page_371">p. 371</span> <span
id="iii.ix.v-Page_371"></span>daughters prophesy, the old men and the
youths, the men-servants and the hand-maids.  Something of Christ is in
us, yet Christ is in heaven at the right hand of His Father.  And Christ
received the Spirit not by measure, but His Father loved Him and
delivered all into His hands, and gave Him authority over all His
treasure.  For John said:—*Not by measure did the Father give the Spirit
to His Son, but loved Him and gave all into His hands*. <span
id="fr_925"></span>[926](#fn_925.md)   And also our Lord said:—*All things
have been delivered unto Me by My Father*. <span
id="fr_926"></span>[927](#fn_926.md)   Again he said:—*The Father will not
judge any man, but all judgment will He give unto His Son*. <span
id="fr_927"></span>[928](#fn_927.md)   Again also the Apostle
said:—*Everything shall be made subject unto Christ except His Father
Who hath subjected all unto Him.  And when everything is made subject
unto Him by the Father, then He also shall be made subject to God His
Father Who subjected all to Him, and God shall be all in all, and in
every man.* <span id="fr_928"></span>[929](#fn_928.md)

<span id="iii.ix.v-p120"></span>13.  Our Lord testifies concerning John,
that he is the greatest of the Prophets.  Yet he received the Spirit by
limit, because in that measure in which Elijah received the Spirit, (in
the same) John obtained it.  And as Elijah used to dwell in the
wilderness, so also the Spirit of God led John into the wilderness, and
he used to dwell in the mountains and caves.  The birds sustained
Elijah, and John used to eat locusts that fly.  Elijah had his loins
girded with a girdle of leather; so John had his loins girded with a
cincture of leather.  Jezebel persecuted Elijah, and Herodias persecuted
John.  Elijah reproved Ahab, and John reproved Herod.  Elijah divided
the Jordan, and John opened up baptism.  The spirit of Elijah rested
twofold upon Elisha, so John laid his hand on our Redeemer, and He
received the Spirit not by measure.  Elijah opened the heavens and
ascended; and John saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit of God which
descended and rested upon our Redeemer.  Elisha received twofold the
Spirit of Elijah; and our Redeemer received that of John and that of
heaven.  Elisha took the mantle of Elijah, and our Redeemer the
imposition of the hand of the priests.  Elisha made oil from water, and
our Redeemer made wine from water.  Elisha satisfied with a little bread
a hundred men only; and our Redeemer satisfied with a little bread five
thousand men besides children and women.  Elisha cleansed Naaman the
leper, and our Redeemer cleansed the ten (lepers).  Elisha cursed the
children and they were devoured by bears, but our Redeemer blessed the
children.  The children reviled Elisha, but the children glorified our
Redeemer with Hosannas.  Elisha cursed Gehazi his servant, and our
Redeemer cursed Judas His disciple and blessed all His (other)
disciples.  Elisha raised to life one dead man only, but our Redeemer
raised up three to life.  On the bones of Elisha one dead man revived,
but when our Saviour descended to the abode of the dead, He quickened
many and raised them up.  And many are the signs that the Spirit of
Christ wrought, which the Prophets received from Him.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p121"></span>14.  Therefore, my beloved, we also have
received of the Spirit of Christ, and Christ *dwelleth in us*, as it is
written that the Spirit said this through the mouth of the Prophet:—*I
will dwell in them and will walk in them*. <span
id="fr_929"></span>[930](#fn_929.md)   Therefore let us prepare our temples
for the Spirit of Christ, and let us not grieve it that it may not
depart from us.  Remember the warning that the Apostle gives us:—*Grieve
not the Holy Spirit whereby ye have been sealed unto the day of
redemption.*  For from baptism do we receive the Spirit of Christ.  For
in that hour in which the priests invoke the Spirit, the heavens open
and it descends and *moves upon the waters*. <span
id="fr_930"></span>[931](#fn_930.md)   And those that are baptized are
clothed in it; for the Spirit stays aloof from all that are born of the
flesh, until they come to the new birth by water, and then they receive
the Holy Spirit.  For in the first birth they are born with an ani<span
id="page_372">p. 372</span> <span id="iii.ix.v-Page_372"></span>mal
souls which is created within man and is not thereafter subject to
death, as he said:—*Adam became a living soul*. <span
id="fr_931"></span>[932](#fn_931.md)   But in the second birth, that
through baptism, they received the Holy Spirit from a particle of the
Godhead, and it is not again subject to death.  For when men die, the
animal spirit is buried with the body, and sense is taken away from it,
but the heavenly spirit that they receive goes according to its nature
to Christ.  And both these the Apostle has made known, for he said:—*The
body is buried in animal wise, and rises again in spiritual wise*. <span
id="fr_932"></span>[933](#fn_932.md)   The Spirit goes back again to Christ
according to its nature, for the Apostle said again:—*When we shall
depart from the body we shall be with our Lord*. <span
id="fr_933"></span>[934](#fn_933.md)   For the Spirit of Christ, which the
spiritual receive, goes to our Lord.  And the animal spirit is buried in
its nature, and sense is taken away from it.  Whosoever guards the
Spirit of Christ in purity, when it returns to Christ it thus addresses
him:—“The body into which I went, and which put me on from the water of
the baptism, has kept me in holiness.”  And the Holy Spirit will be
earnest with Christ for the resurrection of that body which kept Him
with purity, and the Spirit will request to be again conjoined to it
that that body may rise up in glory.  And whatever man there is that
receives the Spirit from the water (of baptism) and grieves it, it
departs from him until he dies, and returns according to its nature to
Christ, and accuses that man of having grieved it.  And when the time of
the final consummation shall have come, and the time of the Resurrection
shall have approached, the Holy Spirit, that was kept in purity,
receives great power from its nature and comes before Christ and stands
at the door of the tombs, where the men are buried that kept it in
purity, and awaits the (resurrection) shout.  And when the Watchers
shall have opened the doors of heaven before the King, <span
id="fr_934"></span>[935](#fn_934.md) then the cornet shall summon, and the
trumpets shall sound, and the Spirit that waits for the (resurrection)
shout shall hear, and quickly shall open the tombs, and raise up the
bodies and whatsoever was buried in them, and shall put on the glory
that comes with it.  And (the Spirit) shall be within for the
resurrection of the body, and the glory shall be without for the
adornment of the body.  And the animal spirit shall be swallowed up in
the heavenly Spirit, and the whole man shall become spiritual, since his
body is possessed by it (the Spirit).  And death shall be swallowed up
in life, <span id="fr_935"></span>[936](#fn_935.md) and body shall be
swallowed up in Spirit.  And by the power of the Spirit, that man shall
fly up to meet the King and He shall receive him with joy, and Christ
shall give thanks for the body that has kept His Spirit in purity.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p129"></span>15.  This is the Spirit, my beloved,
that the Prophets received, and thus also have we received.  And it is
not at every time found with those that receive it, but sometimes it
returns to Him that sent it, and sometimes it goes to him that receives
it.  Hearken to that which our Lord said:—*Despise not one of these
little ones that believe on Me, for their angels in heaven do always
behold the face of My Father*. <span id="fr_936"></span>[937](#fn_936.md)  
This Spirit then goes frequently and stands before God and beholds His
face, and whosoever injures the temple in which it dwells, it will
accuse him before God.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p131"></span>16.  I will instruct thee of that which
is written, that the Spirit is not at every time found with those that
receive it.  For thus it is written about Saul, that the Holy Spirit,
which he received when he was anointed, *departed from him*, <span
id="fr_937"></span>[938](#fn_937.md) because he grieved it, and God sent to
him instead of it a vexing spirit.  And whenever he was afflicted by the
evil spirit, David used to play upon the harp, and the Holy Spirit,
which David received when he was anointed, would come, and the evil
spirit that was vexing Saul, would flee from before it.  So the Holy
<span id="page_373">p. 373</span> <span
id="iii.ix.v-Page_373"></span>Spirit that David received was not found
with him at every time.  As long as he was playing the harp, then it
used to come.  For had it been with him always, it would not have
allowed him to sin with the wife of Uriah.  For when he was praying
about his sins, and was confessing his offences before God, he said
thus:—*Take not Thy holy spirit from me*. <span
id="fr_938"></span>[939](#fn_938.md)   Also concerning Elisha it is thus
written, that, *while he played upon his harp, then the spirit came to
him and he prophesied and said*:—*Thus saith the Lord, ye shall not see
wind nor rain, yet this valley shall be made many pits*. <span
id="fr_939"></span>[940](#fn_939.md)   And also when the Shunamite came to
him because of her son that was dead, he said thus to her:—*The Lord hid
it from me and did cause me not to know it*. <span
id="fr_940"></span>[941](#fn_940.md)   Yet, when the King of Israel sent
against him to slay him, the Spirit informed him before the messenger
came upon him, and he said:—*Lo! this son of iniquity has sent to take
away my head*. <span id="fr_941"></span>[942](#fn_941.md)   And again he
made known about the abundance that came about in Samaria the day
after.  And again the Spirit informed him when Gehazi stole the silver
and concealed it.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p137"></span>17.  Therefore, my beloved, when the
Holy Spirit departs from a man who has received it, until it returns and
comes to him, then Satan draws near unto that man, to cause him to sin,
and that the Holy Spirit may leave him altogether.  For as long as the
Spirit is with a man, Satan fears to come near him.  And observe, my
beloved, that our Lord also, Who was born from the Spirit, was not
tempted by Satan until in baptism He received the Spirit from on high. 
And then the Spirit led him forth to be tempted by Satan.  This, then,
is the way with man; that in the hour in which he perceives in himself
that he is not fervent in the Spirit, and that his heart is inclining to
the thought of this world, he may know that the Spirit is not with him,
and may arise and pray and keep vigil that the Spirit of God may come to
him, that he be not overcome by the adversary.  A thief does not dig
into a house, until he sees that its master is departing from it.  Thus
also Satan cannot draw near to that house which is our body, until the
Spirit of Christ departs from it.  And be sure, my beloved, that the
thief does not certainly know whether the master of the house is within
or not, but first *he applies his ear*, and looks.  If he hears the
voice of the master of the house within it saying:—“I have a journey to
go,” and when he has searched out and seen that the master of the house
has set out to perform his business, then the thief comes and digs into
the house and steals.  But if he hears the voice of the master of the
house admonishing and commanding his household to watch and guard his
house, and saying to them, “I also am within the house,” then the thief
will fear and flee, that he may not be taken and captured.  Thus also
Satan, he has not the knowledge beforehand to know or see when the
Spirit will depart, that so he may come to rob the man; but he too
listens and watches, and so assails.  But if he hears a man in whom
Christ dwells speaking shameful words, or enraged, or quarrelling, or
contending, then Satan knows that Christ is not with him, and he comes
and accomplishes his will in him.  For Christ dwells in the peaceful and
the meek, and lodges in those that fear His word, as He says through the
prophet:—*On whom shall I look, and in whom shall I dwell, but in the
peaceful and the meek who fear My word*? <span
id="fr_942"></span>[943](#fn_942.md)   And our Lord said:—*Whoever walks in
My commandments and keeps My love, We will come to him and make Our
abode with him*. <span id="fr_943"></span>[944](#fn_943.md)   But if he
hears from a man that he is on his guard and is praying and meditating
in the Law of his Lord by day and by night, then he turns back from him,
for he knows that Christ is with him.  And if thou shouldest say, “How
manifold is Satan! for lo! he fights with many;” then hear and learn
from that which I proved to thee above <span id="page_374">p. 374</span>
<span id="iii.ix.v-Page_374"></span>concerning Christ, that no matter to
what extent He is divided amongst many, yet He is not a whit
diminished.  For, as the house, through the window of which a little
sunlight enters, is altogether illumined, so the man into whom a little
of Satan enters, is altogether darkened.  Hear that which the Apostle
said:—*If Satan is transfigured to an angel of light, it is no wonder if
his ministers also are transfigured to ministers of
righteousness*. <span id="fr_944"></span>[945](#fn_944.md)   And again our
Lord said to His disciples:—*Lo, I have given you authority to tread
upon the power of the adversary*. <span
id="fr_945"></span>[946](#fn_945.md)   And the Scriptures have made known
that he has power and also ministers.  Moreover Job said concerning
him:—*God made him to wage his war.* <span
id="fr_946"></span>[947](#fn_946.md)   These ministers then that he has, he
causes to run in the world, to wage war.  But be sure that he will not
fight openly; because from the time of the coming of our Saviour, (God)
has given authority over him.  But he will surely plunder and steal.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p143"></span>18.  But I will explain to thee, my
beloved, concerning that word which the Apostle said, by which can be
weighed the doctrines that are instruments of the Evil One and doctrines
of deceit.  For the Apostle said:—*There is an animal body and there is
a spiritual body, seeing that it is thus written*:—*The first Adam
became a living soul and the second Adam a quickening spirit*. <span
id="fr_947"></span>[948](#fn_947.md)   So they <span
id="fr_948"></span>[949](#fn_948.md) say that there will be two Adams.  But
he said:—*As we have put on the image of that Adam who was from the
earth, so we shall put on the image of that Adam who is from
heaven.* <span id="fr_949"></span>[950](#fn_949.md)   For Adam who was from
the earth was he that sinned, and the Adam who is from heaven is our
Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ.  They then that receive the Spirit of
Christ, come into the likeness of the heavenly Adam, Who is our Saviour,
our Lord Jesus Christ.  For the animal shall be swallowed up in the
spiritual, as I wrote unto thee above.  And the man that grieves the
spirit of Christ, will be animal in his resurrection; because the
heavenly spirit is not with him, that the animal might be swallowed up
in it.  But when he shall arise he shall continue in his natural state,
naked of the Spirit.  Because he stripped off from him the Spirit of
Christ, he shall be given over to utter nakedness.  And whosoever
honours the Spirit, and it is guarded in him in purity, in that day the
Holy Spirit shall protect him, and he shall become altogether spiritual,
and shall not be found naked; as the Apostle said:—*And when we shall
have clothed ourselves, may we not be found naked*. <span
id="fr_950"></span>[951](#fn_950.md)   And again he said:—*We shall all
sleep, but in the resurrection we shall not all be changed*. <span
id="fr_951"></span>[952](#fn_951.md)   And again he said:—*This which dies
shall put on that which dies not, and this which is corruptible that
which is incorruptible, and when this which dies shall have put on that
which dies not, and this corruptible that which is incorruptible, then
shall be accomplished that word which is written that death is swallowed
up by victory*. <span id="fr_952"></span>[953](#fn_952.md)   Again he
said:—*Suddenly as the twinkling of an eye, the dead shall rise
incorruptible and we shall be changed*. <span
id="fr_953"></span>[954](#fn_953.md)   And they who shall be changed shall
put on the form of that heavenly Adam and shall become spiritual.  And
those who shall not be changed, shall continue animal in the created
nature of Adam, namely, of dust; and shall continue in their nature in
the earth below.  And then the heavenly shall be caught up to heaven and
the Spirit that they have put on shall cause them to fly, and they shall
inherit the kingdom that was prepared for them from the beginning.  And
they that are animal shall remain on the earth by the weight of their
bodies, and shall turn back to Sheol, and there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p151"></span>19.  In writing this I have reminded
myself, and also thee, my beloved; therefore love virginity, the
heavenly portion, the fellowship of the Watchers of heaven.  For <span
id="page_375">p. 375</span> <span id="iii.ix.v-Page_375"></span>there is
nothing comparable with it.  And in those that are thus, in them Christ
dwells.  *The time of summer is at hand, and the fig-tree has budded and
its leaves have come out* <span id="fr_954"></span>[955](#fn_954.md) —the
signs that our Redeemer gave have begun to be fulfilled.  For he
said:—*People shall rise against people and kingdom against kingdom. 
And there shall be famines and pestilences and terrors from
heaven*. <span id="fr_955"></span>[956](#fn_955.md)   And lo! all these
things are being accomplished in our days.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p154"></span>20.  Therefore read in this whatever I
have written unto thee, thou and the brethren, the monks that love
virginity.  And be on thy guard against scorners.  For whosoever scorns
and mocks his brother, the word that is written in the Gospel fitly
applies to him; namely, when our Lord wished to take account with the
avaricious and with the Pharisees.  For it is written:—*Because they
loved money, they mocked Him*. <span id="fr_956"></span>[957](#fn_956.md)  
So also now those that do not agree with these things mock in the same
way.  Read then and learn.  Be zealous for reading and for doing.  And
let the Law of God be thy meditation at every time.  And when thou hast
read this epistle, on thy life (I adjure thee), my beloved, arise and
pray, and remember my sinfulness in thy prayer.
