<p class="c16"><a name="iii.vii.viii-p1"></A> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.vii.viii-p1.1"></A>Hymn VII.</span></p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vii.viii-p2"></A>1.&#160; As in a race saw I the disputers, the children of strife, [trying] to taste fire, to see the air, to handle the light:&#160; they were troubled at the gleaming, and struggled to make divisions.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p3"></A>The Son, Who is too subtle for the mind, did they seek to feel:&#160; and the Holy Ghost Who cannot be explored, they thought to explore with their questionings.&#160; The Father, Who never at any time was searched out, have they explained and disputed of.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p4"></A>The sound form of our faith is from Abraham, and our repentance is from Nineveh and the house of Rahab,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_547"></A><A HREF="#fn_547"><FONT SIZE="1">548</FONT></A>
 and ours are the expectations of the Prophets,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_548"></A><A HREF="#fn_548"><FONT SIZE="1">549</FONT></A>
 ours of the Apostles.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p7"></A>2.&#160; And envy is from Satan:&#160; the evil usage of the evil calf is from the Egyptians.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_549"></A><A HREF="#fn_549"><FONT SIZE="1">550</FONT></A>
&#160; The hateful sight of the hateful image of four faces is from the Hittites.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_550"></A><A HREF="#fn_550"><FONT SIZE="1">551</FONT></A>
&#160; Accursed disputation, that hidden moth, is from the Greeks.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p10"></A>The bitter [enemy] read and saw orthodox teachings, and subverted them; he saw hateful things, and sowed them; and he saw hope, and he turned it upside down and cut it off.&#160; The disputation that he planted, lo! it has yielded a fruit bitter to the tooth.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p11"></A>3.&#160; Satan saw that the Truth strangled him, and united himself to the tares, and <A NAME="page_300"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 300</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vii.viii-Page_300"></A>secreted his frauds, and spread his snares for the faith, and cast upon the priests the darts of the love of pre-eminence.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p12"></A>They made contests for the throne, to see which should first obtain it.&#160; There was that meditated in secret and kept it close:&#160; there was that openly combated for it:&#160; and there was that with a bribe crept up to it:&#160; and there was that with fraud dealt wisely to obtain it.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p13"></A>The paths differed, the scope was one, and they were alike.&#160; Him that was young, and could not even think of it, because it was not time for him; and him that was hoary and shaped out dreams for time beyond; all of them by his craftiness did the wicked one persuade and subdue.&#160; Old men, youths, and even striplings, aim at rank!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p14"></A>4.&#160; His former books did Satan put aside, and put on others:&#160; the People who was grown old had the moth and the worm devoured and eaten and left and deserted:&#160; the moth came into the new garment of the new peoples:</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p15"></A>He saw the crucifiers who were rejected and cast forth as strangers:&#160; he made of those of the household, pryers; and of worshippers, they became disputants.&#160; From that garment the moth gendered and wound it up and deposited it.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p16"></A>The worm gendered in the storehouse of wheat, and sat and looked on:&#160; and lo! the pure wheat was mildewed, and devoured were the garments of glory!&#160; He made a mockery of us, and we of ourselves, since we were besotted!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p17"></A>He showed tares, and the bramble shot up in the pure vineyard!&#160; He infected the flock, and the leprosy broke out, and the sheep became hired servants of his!&#160; He began in the People, and came unto the Gentiles, that he might finish.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p18"></A>5.&#160; Instead of the reed which the former people made the Son hold, others have dared with their reed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_551"></A><A HREF="#fn_551"><FONT SIZE="1">552</FONT></A>
 to write in their tracts that He is only a Son of man.&#160; Reed for reed does the wicked one exchange against our Redeemer, and instead of the coat of many colours,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_552"></A><A HREF="#fn_552"><FONT SIZE="1">553</FONT></A>
 wherewith they clothed Him, titles has he dyed craftily.&#160; With diversity of names he clothed Him; either that of a creature or of a thing made, when He was the Maker.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p21"></A>And as he plaited for Him by silent men speechless thorns that cry out, thorns from the mind has he plaited [now] by the voice, as hymns; and concealed the spikes amid melodies that they might not be perceived.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_553"></A><A HREF="#fn_553"><FONT SIZE="1">554</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p23"></A>6.&#160; When Satan saw that he was detected in his former [frauds]; that the spitting was discovered, and vinegar, and thorns, nails and wood, garments and reed and spear, which smote him, and were hated and openly known; he changed his frauds.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p24"></A>Instead of the blow with the hand, by which our Lord was overcome, he brought in distractions; and instead of the spitting, cavilling entered in; and instead of garments, secret divisions; and instead of the reed, came in strife to smite us on the face.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p25"></A>Haughtiness called for rage its sister, and there answered and came envy, and wrath, and pride, and fraud.&#160; They have taken counsel against our Redeemer as on that day when they took counsels at His Passion.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p26"></A>And instead of the cross, a hidden wood hath strife become; and instead of the nails, questionings have come in; and instead of hell, apostasy:&#160; the pattern of both Satan would renew again.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p27"></A>Instead of the sponge which was cankered with vinegar and wormwood, he gave <A NAME="page_301"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 301</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vii.viii-Page_301"></A>prying, the whole of which is cankered with death.&#160; The gall which they gave Him did our Lord put away from Him; the subtle questioning, which the rebellious one hath given, to fools is sweet.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p28"></A>7.&#160; And at that time there were judges against them,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_554"></A><A HREF="#fn_554"><FONT SIZE="1">555</FONT></A>
 lo, the judges are, as it were, against us, and instead of a handwriting are their commands.&#160; Priests that consecrate crowns, set snares for kings.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p30"></A>Instead of the priesthood praying for royalty that wars may cease from among men, they teach wars of overthrow, which set kings to combat with those round about.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.viii-p31"></A>O Lord, make the priests and kings peaceful; that in one Church priests may pray for their kings, and kings spare those round about them; and may the peace which is within Thee become ours, Lord, Thou that art within and without all things!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_555"></A><A HREF="#fn_555"><FONT SIZE="1">556</FONT></A>
