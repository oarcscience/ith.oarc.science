<span id="ii.vi.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.vi.x-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXVII.</span>

<span id="ii.vi.x-p2"></span>To Innocent, Præfect of Africa.

<span id="ii.vi.x-p3"></span>Gregory to Innocent, &c.

<span id="ii.vi.x-p4"></span>The lucid eloquence of your Eminence,
seasoned with the honey of the heart, has so infused its savour into our
inmost soul, and ravished us with love of it, that both what you write
sounds sweet, and what you do has a pleasant savour; nor this without
good cause, since one who is accomplished in good studies is great in
the eye of judgment, and not of partiality.  Further, as we understand
that you have taken upon you the belts <span
id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md) of the prefecture, sadness is mingled
with our joy.  For on the one hand we are rejoiced for the promotion of
our most sweet son, but are saddened on the other, because we feel in
fact from our own sorrow how heavy a burden it is in times of confusion
to be advanced to high positions.  Wherefore all pains ought to be taken
that troublesome circumstances may become an occasion of reward.  For,
as you know, corn springs from land that is full of thistles, and the
rose is produced from thorns.  While, then, you have a time given you
meet for sowing, delay not to sow the seed of good works, that in the
day of harvest you may carry home the greater armfuls of joy, and from
good service in a transitory dignity may come to eternal glory. 
Knowing, then, of the pains you have taken in the preparation of
swift-sailing vessels <span id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) , we
relieve your anxiety by wished for news, informing you that, by the
mercy of God, we have come to terms about peace with the king of the
Lombards until the month of March in the coming fourth Indiction. 
Whether it will hold or not we know not, since the said king is reported
to have died since, though the fact so far is held to be uncertain <span
id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) .

<span id="ii.vi.x-p8"></span>We have done what you wrote to ask us to do
about Anamundarus, and would that the result might answer to our wish;
for, as far as we are concerned, we do not deny the succour of our
intercession to the afflicted.

<span id="ii.vi.x-p9"></span>As to your wishing the book on the
exposition of holy Job to be sent to you, we altogether rejoice at your
earnest desire; since we see that your Eminence earnestly desires what
may both prevent you from going entirely outside yourself, and bring
your heart back to itself after being distracted by secular cares.  But,
if you desire to be satiated with delicious food, read the works of the
blessed Augustine, your countryman, and seek not our chaff in comparison
with his fine wheat.

<span id="ii.vi.x-p10"></span>Furthermore, we have learnt from the
testimony of Hilarius our *Chartularius* what patronage and what
kindness your Glory has bestowed in the interests of the poor of the
blessed Peter, Prince of the apostles, who loves you.  On this account,
returning you abundant thanks, we implore the mercy of Almighty God,
that He would defend you with the protection of His grace, and permit
neither bad men to prevail against you without, nor malignant spirits
within; but that He would of His mercy so order your doings in His fear
that, as He has made you glorious among men, He may also make you so
after the course of a long life in the number of His saints.
