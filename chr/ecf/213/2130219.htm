<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xliii-p2"></A>1. Who shall weigh the recompense of Abraham? whom I marvelled at when he bound, his only son.&#8212;2. <i>R., To thee be glory, Voice that bringest to life the dead in Sheol:&#160; and they have come up as preachers, of His Son Who quickens all!</i>&#8212;3. At that time I came forth in haste, to see the marvel:&#160; how that his knife was drawn out, against his beloved.&#8212;4. I gathered my manifold memories, from all quarters:&#160; and I collected my spirit to marvel, at that illustrious one.&#8212;5. How therefore can ye read, that great story? ye have despised the reading of it, in your very ears.&#8212;6. The sword of Jephthah rebukes, him that laments:&#160; his daughter was to him a mirror of life from the dead.&#8212;7. She gave herself for her father, so commend ye:&#160; your life to the Father of all, in the hope of <i>your</i> end.&#8212;8. In the womb then did ye not make trial, of a mystery of Sheol? yet in Sheol ye had more rest, than in the womb.&#8212;9. It is stubborn in you to stand up against, my mighty will:&#160; for lo! to succour them I take away, your departed.&#8212;10. By the king of Moab who slew, his son with his hands:&#160; he is put to shame who laments, for the departed one.&#8212;11. He was a profane man, lo! according, to what you read:&#160; but ye are doctors and teachers, as ye suppose.&#8212;12. He endured, but ye are furious, in <A NAME="page_216"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 216</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iv.xliii-Page_216"></A>your mourning:&#160; against the will of the Lord of all, while ye are weeping.&#8212;13. I fear however to let pass, the story of Job:&#160; through this feeble mouth of mine, for I am unworthy.&#8212;14. So in like manner I turn aside, from <i>mention</i> of their bones:&#160; though I praise Him who granted, that they should come to me.&#8212;15. Dishonour not your members, by your sins:&#160; for in Sheol the bones are despised, of evildoers.&#8212;16. Whenever I see the body of one of the evil:&#160; I trample on it and curse, even his memory.&#8212;17. But wherever I see a bone, of one of the just; I set it apart and honour it, and do it worship.&#8212;18. Ye feeble ones understand not, all my ordinances:&#160; with you orders are confused, for ye are blind.&#8212;19. It is Moses alone that I know, to have honoured like me:&#160; the bones of that Joseph whom I magnify.&#8212;20. But Moses did such honour, to one pure body:&#160; but I to the body and the bones, of all the righteous.&#8212;21. Brightly shine the bones of Prophets, and of Apostles:&#160; a lamp to me in darkness, are all the righteous.&#8212;22. I worship Him Who lightens for me, the darkness of Sheol:&#160; the splendour of Moses who was so great, was as the sun to me.</p>
