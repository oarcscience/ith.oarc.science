<span id="iii.vii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.vii.vi-p1.1"></span>Hymn V.</span>

<span id="iii.vii.vi-p2"></span>1.  O gift that camest up without
price <span id="fr_538"></span>[539](#fn_538) with the diver!  Thou
laidest hold upon this visible light, that without price rises for the
children of men:  a parable of the hidden One that without price gives
the hidden Dayspring!

<span id="iii.vii.vi-p4"></span>And the painter too paints a likeness of
thee with colours.  Yet by thee is faith painted in types and emblems
for colours, and in the place of the image by thee and thy colours is
thy Creator painted.

<span id="iii.vii.vi-p5"></span>O thou frankincense without smell, who
breathest types from out of thee! thou art not to be eaten, yet thou
givest a sweet smell unto them that hear thee! thou art not to be drunk,
yet by thy story, a fountain of types art thou made unto the ears!

<span id="iii.vii.vi-p6"></span>2.  It is thou which art great in thy
littleness, O pearl!  Small is thy measure and little thy compass with
thy weight; but great is thy glory:  to that crown alone in which thou
art placed, there is none like.

<span id="iii.vii.vi-p7"></span>And who hath not perceived of thy
littleness, how great it is; if one despises thee and throws thee away,
he would blame himself for his clownishness, for when he saw thee in a
king’s crown he would be attracted to thee.

<span id="iii.vii.vi-p8"></span>3.  Men stripped their clothes off and
dived and drew thee out, pearl!  It was not kings that put thee before
men, but those naked ones who were a type of the poor and the fishers
and the Galileans.

<span id="iii.vii.vi-p9"></span>For clothed bodies were not able to come
to thee; they came that were stript as children; they plunged their
bodies and came down to thee; and thou didst much desire them, and thou
didst aid them who thus loved thee.

<span id="iii.vii.vi-p10"></span>Glad tidings did they give for thee: 
their tongues before their bosoms did the poor \[fishers\] open, and
produced and showed the new riches among the merchants:  upon the wrists
of men they put thee as a medicine of life.

<span id="iii.vii.vi-p11"></span>4.  The naked ones in a type saw thy
rising again by the sea-shore; and by the side of the lake they, the
Apostles <span id="fr_539"></span>[540](#fn_539) of a truth, saw the
rising again of the Son of thy Creator.  By thee and by thy Lord the sea
and the lake were beautified.

<span id="iii.vii.vi-p13"></span><span id="page_298">p. 298</span> <span
id="iii.vii.vi-Page_298"></span>The diver came up from the sea and put
on his clothing; and from the lake too Simon Peter came up swimming and
put on his coat; <span id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540) clad as with
coats, with the love of both of you, were these two.

<span id="iii.vii.vi-p15"></span>5.  And since I have wandered in thee,
pearl, I will gather up my mind, and by having contemplated thee, would
become like thee, in that thou art all gathered up into thyself; and as
thou in all times art one, one let me become by thee!

<span id="iii.vii.vi-p16"></span>Pearls have I gathered together that I
might make a crown for the Son in the place of stains which are in my
members.  Receive my offering, not that Thou art shortcoming; it is
because of mine own shortcoming that I have offered it to Thee.  Whiten
my stains!

<span id="iii.vii.vi-p17"></span>This crown is all spiritual pearls,
which instead of gold are set in love, and instead of ouches in faith;
and instead of hands, let praise offer it up to the Highest!
