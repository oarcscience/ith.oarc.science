<p class="c23"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p2"></A>(<span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p2.1"></A>Resp</span>.&#8212;<i>Glory to all of Thee from all of us!</i>&#160; (bis.)</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p3"></A>1.&#160; Who then that is mortal man, can declare concerning the All-Life giver,&#8212;Who quitted the height of His Majesty, and abased Himself to humility?&#8212;<i>Thou</i> Who exaltest all in Thy Birth, exalt my weak mind,&#8212;to declare of Thy Birth; not that I should search out Thy Majesty,&#8212;but that I should proclaim Thy grace.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p4"></A>R., Blessed be He Who conceals and reveals in His discourses!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p5"></A>2.&#160; It is a great marvel that the Son, dwelt wholly in a body;&#8212;abode therein wholly and it sufficed for Him; dwelt therein though not bounded <i>thereby</i>.&#8212;His Will was wholly therein; His bounds reached wholly to His Father.&#8212;Who is sufficient to tell, how though He dwelt wholly in a body.&#8212;He likewise dwelt wholly in all?</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p6"></A>R., Blessed is He Who though without bounds was bounded!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p7"></A>3.&#160; Thy Majesty is concealed from us; Thy Grace is revealed before us.&#8212;I will be silent, O Lord of Thy Majesty; and I will tell of Thy grace.&#8212;Thy grace clove to Thee, and bowed Thee down to our vileness:&#8212;Thy grace made Thee a babe; Thy grace made Thee man:&#8212;it straitened, it enlarged, Thy Majesty.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p8"></A>R., Blessed be the might that became little and became great!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p9"></A>4.&#160; Glory to Him Who became lowly, though lofty He was by His nature!&#8212;He became in His love the firstborn of Mary, Firstborn though He be of Godhead.&#8212;He became in name the offspring of Joseph, offspring though He be of the Most High.&#8212;<A NAME="page_256"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 256</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.xvii-Page_256"></A>He became by His own Will man, God though He be by His Nature.&#8212;Glorified <i>be</i> Thy Will and Thy Nature!</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p10"></A>R., Blessed be Thy Glory which put on our image!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p11"></A>5.&#160; Yea, O Lord, Thy Birth, has become mother of <i>all</i> creatures; for it travailed anew and gave birth, to mankind which gave birth to Thee.&#160; Thou wast born of it bodily; it was born of Thee spiritually.&#8212;All that Thou camest <i>for</i> to birth, <i>was</i> that man might be born in Thy likeness.&#8212;Thy Birth became the author of birth to all.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p12"></A>R., Blessed be He Who became a youth and to all gave youth!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p13"></A>6.&#160; When man&#146;s hope had broken down, hope was increased by Thy Birth.&#8212;Good tidings of hope they bore, the Heavenly Ones to men.&#8212;Satan who cut off our hope, his own hope by his own hands had cut off.&#8212;when he saw that hope was increased:&#160; Thy Birth became to the hopeless,&#8212;a fountain teaming with hope.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p14"></A>R., Blessed be He Who bore the tidings of hope!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p15"></A>7.&#160; The day of Thy Birth is like Thee, for it is desired and loved as Thou.&#8212;We who saw not Thy Birth, and its flame as in its own time,&#8212;in this Thy day we see Thee, even as Thou wast a babe;&#8212;beloved by all men, lo! in Thee the Churches rejoice;&#8212;Thy day adorns and is adorned.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p16"></A>R., Blessed be Thy day which was ordained for us!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p17"></A>8.&#160; Thy day has given us a gift, to which the Father has none other like;&#8212;It was not Seraphim He sent us, nor yet did Cherubim come down among us;&#8212;there came not Watchers <i>or</i> Ministers, but the Firstborn to Whom they minister.&#8212;Who can suffice to give thanks, that the Majesty which is beyond measure&#8212;is laid in the lowly manger!</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p18"></A>R., Blessed be He Who gave us what He had won!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p19"></A>9.&#160; That generation Thy Birth made glad, and our generation Thy day makes glad:&#160; twofold <i>was</i> the happiness of that generation, for they saw Thy Birth and also Thy day:&#8212;less <i>is</i> the happiness of them that come after, for the day of Thy Birth they see only.&#8212;Yet because they that then were, doubted, greater is the happiness of them that come after,&#8212;who though they have not seen Thee have believed in Thee.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p20"></A>R., Blessed be Thy happiness that is added to us!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p21"></A>10.&#160; The Magi exalted from afar; the Scribes murmured near at hand;&#8212;the prophet showed his message, and Herod his wrath;&#8212;the scribes showed their doctrine, the Magi showed their offerings.&#160; It is a marvel that to Him, the Babe, they of His own house hasted with their swords, and they that were strangers with their offerings.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p22"></A>R., Blessed be Thy Birth which has stirred up all!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p23"></A>11.&#160; The bosom of Mary amazes me, that it sufficed for Thee, Lord, and embraced Thee.&#8212;All creation were too small, to conceal Thy Majesty;&#8212;Heaven and earth too narrow, to be in the likeness of wings,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_505"></A><A HREF="#fn_505"><FONT SIZE="1">506</FONT></A>
 to cover Thy Godhead.&#8212;Too small for Thee was the bosom of earth; great enough for Thee was the bosom of Mary.&#8212;He dwelt in the bosom and healed in her bosom.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p25"></A>R.,</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p26"></A>12.&#160; He was wrapped meanly in swaddling clothes, and offerings were offered Him.&#8212;He put on garments in youth, and from them there came forth helps:&#160; He put on the waters of baptism, and from them there shone forth beams:&#8212;He put on linen cloths in death, and in them were shown forth triumphs; with His humiliations, His exaltations.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p27"></A>R., Blessed be He Who joined His Glory to His Passion!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p28"></A>13.&#160; All these <i>are</i> the changes of raiment, which Mercy put off and put on,&#8212;when He strove to put on Adam, the glory which he had put off.&#8212;He was wrapped in swaddling-clothes as <i>Adam</i> with leaves; and clad in garments instead of skins.&#8212;He was baptized for <i>Adam&#146;s</i> sin, and buried for <i>Adam&#146;s</i> death:&#8212;He rose and raised <i>Adam</i> into Glory.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p29"></A>R., Blessed be He Who came down and clothed him and went up!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p30"></A><A NAME="page_257"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 257</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.xvii-Page_257"></A>14.&#160; Though Thy Birth had sufficed, for Adam&#146;s sons as for Adam;&#8212;O Mighty One Who didst become a babe, in Thy Birth anew hast Thou begotten me!&#8212;O pure One Who wast baptized, let Thy Washing wash away our filth&#8212;O Living One who wast buried, may we gain life in Thy death!&#8212;I will praise all of Thee in Him that fills all.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p31"></A><i>R., Glory to all of Thee from all of us!</i></p>
