<span id="iii.v.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.v.xix-p1.1"></span>Hymn XVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.xix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.xix-p2.1"></span>Resp</span>.—*Praise be to Him Who sent Him!*
(bis)

<span id="iii.v.xix-p3"></span>1.  *Blessed art* thou, O Church, for lo!
in thee is the sound,—of the great feast the festival of the King!—Sion
is deserted, her gates are sore athirst,—and forsaken of
festivals.—Blessed thy gates that are open yet not filled,—and thy halls
that are enlarged yet suffice not!—In the midst of thee lo! is the
sound, of the nations that cry out, and have put to silence the People.

<span id="iii.v.xix-p4"></span>2.  *Blessed art* thou, O Church, that in
thy festivals,—the Watchers rejoice amid thy festivity!—for one night
the Watchers gave praise,—on the earth which withheld and refused
praise.—*Blessed* thy voices that have been sown and reaped,—and in
Heaven stored up in garners!—Thy mouth is a censer, and thy voices as
perfumes, breathing vapour in thy festivals.

<span id="iii.v.xix-p5"></span>3.  *Blessed art* thou, O Church, that
all oblations,—are brought unto thee in this feast.—The Magi once among
traitors, offered them to the Truth.—*Blessed* thy abode that He bowed
Himself and dwelt therein, Son of the King Who is worshipped with
gifts!—Gold from the West, and spices from the East,—are offered in Thy
Festivals.

<span id="iii.v.xix-p6"></span>4.  *Blessed art* thou, O Church, that
there is not with thee,—a tyrant King slayer of babes! for he killed in
Bethlehem the little ones at random,—that he might put to death the
Child that gives life to all.—*Blessed* thy children that are envied and
worshipped,—by Kings, for those are promised for Thy worship,—the crowns
of the East:—he who trod down thy dear ones, shall be trodden down by
thy beloved.

<span id="iii.v.xix-p7"></span>5.  *Blessed art* thou, O Church, for lo!
over thee,—Isaiah too exults in his prophecy,—”Lo a Virgin shall
conceive and bear,—a Son” Whose name is great mystery!—O interpretation
revealed in the Church!—two names that were joined and became
one;—”Emmanuel,”—God be with thee ever, Who joined thee with His
members!

<span id="iii.v.xix-p8"></span>6.  *Blessed art* thou, O Church, in
Micah who cried out,—“A Shepherd shall come forth from Ephrata”:—for He
came to Bethlehem to take—from thence the rod of Jesse and to rule the
nations.—*Blessed* thy lambs that are sealed with His seal,—and thy
sheep that are kept by His sword!—Thou art, O Church,—the abiding
Bethlehem,—for in thee is the Bread of Life! <span
id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md)

<span id="iii.v.xix-p10"></span>7.  *Blessed art* thou, O Church, for
lo! in thee rejoices,—Daniel also the man beloved,<span id="page_260">p.
260</span> <span id="iii.v.xix-Page_260"></span>—who foretold that the
glorious Messiah shall be killed,—and the city of holiness be laid
desolate at His killing!—Woe to the People that was rejected and is not
converted—*Blessed* the nations that were called and turned not
away!—The bidden guests refused,—and others in their stead enjoyed their
banquet.

<span id="iii.v.xix-p11"></span>8.  *Blessed art* thou, O Church, for on
thy, lute, lo! King David sings psalms in thee!  In the Spirit he sings
of Him “Thou *art* My Son and I—this day have begotten Thee” in the
glories of holiness.—*Blessed* thy ears that have been purged to
hear!—On His day watch thou as His Body and call on Him;—be taught by
Sion,—which saddened His Feast; make Him glad Who has gladdened thee.

<span id="iii.v.xix-p12"></span>9.  *Blessed art* thou, O Church, that
all festivals—have taken flight from Sion and sheltered with thee!—In
the midst of thee the wearied Prophets have found rest,—from the labour
and the reproach*they bore* in Judah.—*Blessed* the books unrolled in
thy temples,—and the festivals celebrated in thy shrines!—Sion *is*
forsaken,—and lo! today the nations shout in thy festivals.

<span id="iii.v.xix-p13"></span>10.  *Blessed art* thou, O Church, in
ten blessings,—which our Lord has given *as* a mystery complete:—for on
ten all the numbers hang, therefore art thou perfect by ten
blessings.—Blessed thy crowns that are twined—with all blessings mixed
in every crown!—O blessed one,—with every blessing crowned, on me too
send thy blessing!

<span id="iii.v.xix-p14"></span>11.  *Blessed art* thou, Ephrata, mother
of Kings, that from thee sprang the Lord of diadems!—Micah gave thee
tidings that He is from everlasting, and the span of His times is not
comprehended.—Blessed thine eyes which first of all discerned Him!—thee
He deemed worthy to see Him when He appeared,—Chief of benediction,—and
Beginning of gladness, thou didst receive first of all.

<span id="iii.v.xix-p15"></span>12.  Blessed *art* thou, Bethlehem, that
the towns envy thee,—and the fortified cities!—As they *envy* thee, *so*
the women envy Mary,—and the virgins daughters of princes.—Blessed the
maiden in whom He deigned to abide,—and the city wherein He deigned to
sojourn;—a poor maiden,—and a small city, He chose Him to humble
Himself.

<span id="iii.v.xix-p16"></span>13.  Blessed *art* thou, Bethlehem, that
in thee was the beginning,—for Him the Son Who from everlasting is in
the Father!—It is hard to comprehend, that before Time He is,—Who in
thee made Himself subject to Time.—Blessed thine ears, for in thee first
was heard the cry—of the Lamb of God who exulted in thee!—Narrow though
thy manger,—He spread Himself on all sides, and was worshipped of every
creature.

<span id="iii.v.xix-p17"></span>14.  Blessed *art* thou too, Mary, that
thy name—is great and exalted because of thy child!—Thou canst tell then
how and how long—and where He dwelt in thee, the great One in small
room.—Blessed thy mouth that praised and enquired not,—and thy tongue
that glorified and questioned not!—For His Mother was uncertain
concerning Him,—even while she carried Him *in the womb*; who then shall
suffice *to comprehend* Him?

<span id="iii.v.xix-p18"></span>15.  O Woman, thou whom no man knew,—how
can we behold the Son thou hast borne?—For no eyes suffice to
stand—before the transfigurations of the glory, that is on Him.—For
tongues of fire abide in Him—Who sent tongues by His Ascension.—Be every
tongue warned,—that our questioning is *as* stubble, and *as* fire our
scrutiny.

<span id="iii.v.xix-p19"></span>16.  Blessed *is* he the priest who in
the sanctuary,—offers to the Father the Son of the Father,—the fruit
that is plucked from our tree, though it be wholly of the *Divine*
Majesty!—Blessed the hands that are hallowed and offer Him!—and the lips
that are spent in kissing Him!—The Spirit in the Temple—longed for His
embrace; and at His Crucifixion rent *the veil* and went forth.

<span id="iii.v.xix-p20"></span>17.  The Archangel gave thee
greeting,—as the earnest of holiness—Earth became to him new
Heavens,—when the Watcher came down and sang glory on it.—The sons <span
id="page_261">p. 261</span> <span id="iii.v.xix-Page_261"></span>of the
Highest encompassed thy habitation—because of the Son of the King that
dwelt in thee.—Thy abode below,—to the Heaven above was made like by the
host of Watchers.
