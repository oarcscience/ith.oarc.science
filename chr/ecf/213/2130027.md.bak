<span id="ii.v.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.v.xxi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXVI.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxi-p2"></span>To Fortunatus, Bishop of Neapolis
(Naples).

<span id="ii.v.xxi-p3"></span>Gregory to Fortunatus, &c.

<span id="ii.v.xxi-p4"></span>Having learnt what zeal inflames your
Fraternity in behalf of Christian slaves whom Jews buy from the
territories of Gaul, we apprize you that your solicitude has so pleased
us that it is also our own deliberate judgment that they should be
inhibited from traffic of this kind.  But we find from Basilius, the
Hebrew, who has come here with other Jews, that such purchase is
enjoined on them by divers judges of the republic, and that Christians
along with pagans come to be thus procured.  Hence it has been necessary
for the business to be adjusted with such cautious arrangement that
neither they who give such orders should be thwarted, nor those who say
they obey them against their will should bear any expense unjustly. 
Accordingly, let your Fraternity with watchful care provide for this
being observed and kept to; that, when they \[i.e. the Jewish dealers\]
return from the aforesaid province, Christian slaves who may happen to
be brought by them be either handed over to those who gave the order, or
at all events sold to Christian purchasers within forty days.  And after
the completion of this number of days let none of them in any way
whatever remain in the hands of the Jews.  But, should any of these
slaves perchance fall into such sickness that they cannot be sold within
the appointed days, care is to be taken that, when they are restored to
their former health, they be by all means disposed of as aforesaid.  For
it is not fit that any should incur loss for a transaction that is free
from blame.  But since, as often as anything new is ordained, it is
usual so to lay down the rule for the future as not to condemn the past
in large costs, if any slaves have remained in their hands from the
purchase of the previous year, or have been recently taken away from
them by you, let them have liberty to dispose of them while they are
with you.  So may there be no possibility of their incurring loss for
what they did in ignorance before the prohibition, such as it is right
they should sustain after being forbidden.

<span id="ii.v.xxi-p5"></span>Further, it has been reported to us that
the above-named Basilius wishes to concede to his sons, who by the mercy
of God are Christians, certain slaves, under the title of a gift, with
the view that, under cover of the opportunity thus afforded, they may
serve him as their master all but in name; and that, if after this any
should perchance have believed that they might fly to the Church for
refuge in order to become Christians, they may not be reclaimed to
freedom, but to the dominion of those to whom they had before been
given.  In this matter it befits your Fraternity to keep becoming
watch.  And, if he should wish to give any slaves to his sons, that all
occasion of fraud may be removed, let them by all means become
Christians, and let them not remain in his house; but, when
circumstances may require that he should have their services, let them
be commanded to render him what, even in any case, from his sons, and
for God’s sake, it is fitting should be supplied to him.
