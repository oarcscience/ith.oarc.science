<span id="iii.iv.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>Hymn II.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p2"></span>1.  This day are opened, our mouths to
give thanks.  They who opened the breaches, have opened my sons’
mouths.  Thank the Merciful, who has delivered the men of our *city*,
nor thought at that time of exacting the debts that were due by us. 
When they rose up they that took us cap<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>
<span id="iii.iv.iii-Page_169"></span>tive, the worlds in our
deliverance, tasted of Thy graciousness.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p3"></span>*R*.  From all that have mouths, glory
be to Thy grace!

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p4"></span>2.  He has saved us without wall, and
taught us that He is our wall:  He has saved us without king and made us
know that is our king:  He has saved us, in each and all, and showed us
that He is All:  He has saved us in His grace and again reveals, that
freely He has mercy and quickens.  From every boaster, He takes away his
boasting, and gives it to His own grace.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p5"></span>3.  The sound of all mouths, is too
little for Thy praise:  for lo! in the hour when our light was smoking,
and was at the point to be quenched (seeing that all is easy to Thee) of
a sudden it awoke and shone!  Who has seen these two marvels, that for
him whose hope was cut off, hope has sprung up and increased; the hour
of mourning has been turned into good tidings?

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p6"></span>4.  This is a festival day, whereon hang
the feasts:  for if wrath had taken us captive, lo! our feasts too had
ceased.  Whereas our peace has conquered and triumphed, lo! our
festivals resound.  This blessed day supports all:  upon it depends the
city, on the city depends the people, on the people depends peace, on
peace depends all.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p7"></span>5.  Out of these breaches, Thou hast
multiplied triumphs.  Praise unto the Triune God goes up from the three
breaches; for that He descended and repaired them, in His mercy which
restrains wrath.  He smote *the enemy* who understood not that He was
teaching us.  He taught those within, for in His justice He made the
breaches; He taught those without, for in His goodness He repaired them.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p8"></span>6.  Speak and give glory, my delivered
ones on this day; old men and boys, young men and maidens, children and
innocents, and thou, O Church, mother of the city!  For the old men have
been rescued from captivity, the youths from torture, the sucklings from
being dashed in pieces, the women from dishonour, and the Church from
mockery.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p9"></span>7.  He came to us with hardness; we were
afraid for a moment: He came in gentleness, and we rejoiced for an
hour.  He turned and left us for a little, we wandered without end; like
a beast of prey which is trained by blandishments and by fear, but if so
be that men turn *from it*, rebels and strays and becomes savage in the
midst of peace.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p10"></span>8.  He punished us and we feared not;
He rescued us, and we were not shamed:  He straitened us and our vows
were multiplied; He enlarged *us* and our crimes were multiplied.  When
He constrained there was a covenant, when He gave breathing-space there
was straying.  Though He knew us He lowered Himself to establish us.  In
the evening we exalted Him; in the morning we rejected Him.  When
necessity left us, faithfulness left us.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p11"></span>9.  He afflicted us by the breaches,
that He might punish our crimes:  He raised the mounds that thereby, He
might humble our boasting.  He made a breach for the seas that thereby,
He might wash away our pollution.  He shut us in that we might gather
together in His Temple.  He shut us in and we were quenched; He set us
free and we went astray.  We are like unto wool, which passes into every
colour.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p12"></span>10.  We know that when the blessed sons
of Nineveh repented, it was not because of mounds they repented, nor yet
by means of waters, nor was it by reason of a breach, nor yet by reason
of bows; it was not at the sound of the bowstring they feared and
repented.  They harkened to a feeble voice; they caused their little
ones to fast; they made their youths chaste, they made their kings
humble.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p13"></span>11.  Thou smotest us and we justified
Thee, for it befel not by chance; Thou deliveredst us and we gave
thanks, for it was not that we were worthy.  Thou hadst mercy on us not
because Thou erredst, in hoping that we should repent.  It was manifest
to Thee that when Thou hadst mercy on us we strayed.  Thou knewest that
we had sinned; Thou knewest that we are sinners:  with our <span
id="page_170">p. 170</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iii-Page_170"></span>iniquity that has been and is, Thou wast
acquainted when Thou hadst mercy on us.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p14"></span>12.  Weigh our repentance, that it may
outbalance our crimes!  But not in even balance, ascends either weight;
for our crimes are heavy and manifold, and our repentance is light.  He
had commanded that we should be sold for our debt:  His mercy became our
advocate; principal and increase, we repaid with the farthing, which our
repentance proffered.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p15"></span>13.  Ten thousand talents for that
little *payment*, our debt He forgave us.  He was bound to exact it,
that He might appease His justice:  He was constrained again to forgive,
that He might make His grace to rejoice.  Our tears for the twinkling of
an eye we gave Him; He satisfied His justice, in exacting and taking a
little; He made His grace to rejoice, *when* for a little He forgave
much.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p16"></span>14.  Ten thousand *are the* crimes that
He has pardoned; ten thousand tongues, are unable to suffice, in
presence of His goodness.  He has pardoned us and we have not pardoned;
we have requited to Him contrariwise; the guilt committed we write up
afresh.  “Pardon, O Lord,” we cry; “Requite, O Lord,” we pray:  “pardon”
verily when we have done wrong; “requite” verily when wrong is done us.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p17"></span>15.  Yea not as those without, have we
laboured for our lives.  They have raised their mounds, but we not even
our voices:  they have broken through the wall, but we—not even the
chains, the frail chains on our heart within have we broken.  *God* has
rejected the diligent, for the sake of the slothful; He has rejected the
labour done without, though He was rejected from within.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p18"></span>16.  He has set free them that talked,
and smitten the silent; the wall was beaten, and the people were
instructed:  He spared them that can suffer, He smote that which knows
no suffering.  For instead of souls that feel, He smote the stones that
feel not, that He might chasten us.  In His love He spared our bodies,
and hasted to smite our wall.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p19"></span>17.  Who has ever seen, that a breach
became as a mirror?  Two parties looked thereinto; it served for those
without and those within.  They saw therein as with eyes, the Power that
breaks down and builds up:  they saw Him who made the breach and again
repaired *it*.  Those without saw His might; they departed and tarried
not till evening:  those within saw His help; they gave thanks yet
sufficed not.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p20"></span>18.  Let the day of thy deliverance,
arouse thee from sloth!  When the wall was broken through, when the
elephants pressed in, when the javelins showered, when men did
valiantly, then was there a sight for the heavenly ones.  Iniquity
fought there; mercy triumphed there; lovingkindness prevailed below; the
watchers shouted on high.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p21"></span>19.  And thine enemy wearied himself,
*striving* to smite by his wiles, the wall that encompassed thee, a
bulwark to thine inhabitants.  He wearied himself and availed not; and
in order that he might not hope, that if He broke through He should also
enter and take us captive, he broke it through and not once only; and
was put to shame, nor was that enough, even unto three times, that he
might be shamed thrice in the three.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p22"></span>20.  Let my happiness by *God’s* grace,
be also multiplied in thy midst!  Whereas in thee my crimes have been
many, many be in thee my fruits!  Whereas in thee I have sinned in my
youth, in thee let there be mercy for my old age!  By the mouth of thy
sons pray for thy son, for I have sinned beyond my ability, and have
repented below my ability; I have scattered above measure, and have
gathered below measure.
