<span id="ii.vii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.vii.vii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXX.</span>

<span id="ii.vii.vii-p2"></span>*To Venantius, Ex-Monk, Patrician of
Syracuse* <span id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md) .

<span id="ii.vii.vii-p4"></span>Gregory to Venantius, &c.

<span id="ii.vii.vii-p5"></span>In addressing to you the greeting which
is due I was intending to speak of what I suffer.  But I think I need
not relate to you what you know.  For I am tormented by pains of gout,
which, afflicting not dissimilarly both me and you, while they increase
upon us exceedingly, have caused our life to decrease.  In the midst of
them what else should we do but recall our faults to mind, and give
thanks to Almighty God?  For we who have sinned in many things from the
pampering of the flesh are purged by the affliction of the flesh.  We
are to know also that present pain, if it converts the mind of the
afflicted one, is the end of preceding guilt; but, if it does not
convert to the fear of the Lord, is the beginning of pain to follow.  We
must therefore take care, and in entire conversion of heart watch to the
utmost of our power with tears, lest we pass from torment to torments. 
We are also to consider by how great a dispensation of loving kindness
our Maker deals with us, in that He continually smites us, who are
worthy of death, and still slays us not.  For He threatens what He will
do, and yet does it not, that pains sent in advance may alarm us, and,
when we are converted to the fear of the strict Judge, may shield us
from His animadversion when life is over.  For who may tell, who may
count, how many, sunk in their lechery, running headlong also in
blasphemies and pride, continuing in robberies and iniquities even to
the day of their death, have so lived in this world as never to suffer
even a headache, but by a sudden stroke have been delivered to the fires
of hell?  We, then, have a token that we are not forsaken, in that we
are continually scourged, according to the testimony of Scripture, which
says, *Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom
He receiveth* ([Heb. xii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.vii.vii-p5.1"></span>).  Wherefore under the very stripes of God
let us recall to mind both His gifts and the losses of our guilt.  Let
us consider what good things He has showered upon our ill-doing, and
what ill things we have <span id="page_58">p. 58</span> <span
id="ii.vii.vii-Page_58"></span>committed under His goodness.  Let us
fulfil what the Lord says through the prophet, *Put me in remembrance,
that we may plead together* ([Isa.
1:0](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#000.md), [Isa.
43:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#026.md)<span
id="ii.vii.vii-p5.2"></span>).  Let us plead now in our thought with
God, that we be not hereafter strictly judged by God.  For what says
Paul?  *If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged of the
Lord* ([1 Cor. xi. 31](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031.md)<span
id="ii.vii.vii-p5.3"></span>).  Whosoever, then, would make haste to
escape the strictness of the sentence of the judgment to come, let him,
through the bitterness of penitence, cut off for himself all the
sweetness of the present life.  Moreover, whatever gifts of this kind
there are, whose gifts are they but our Maker’s?  But that should not be
accounted a gift of God fully to us which separates us through delight
in itself from the love of God; lest we should prefer the things given
to the Giver, and while receiving good things, though ourselves evil, we
should be disjoined from His fear by that whereby we ought to have grown
in His fear.  Now may the Creator of all things, that is Almighty God,
pour into your heart by the inspiration of His Spirit what we speak to
you of by letter, and cleanse you from all defilements of sin, and grant
you the joy of His comfort here, and hereafter eternal rewards with
Himself.  I beg that my most sweet daughters, the lady Barbara and the
lady Antonina, be greeted in my name.

<span id="ii.vii.vii-p3"></span> See I. 34, note 8.  It is significant
of Gregory’s delicate tact, that he does not in this letter, when his
friend was suffering, allude to his past renunciation of monastic life
as among the sins to be repented of, or urge him to return to it, though
that the subject was still on his mind appears from his letter about the
same time to the Bishop of Syracuse (XI. 36).
