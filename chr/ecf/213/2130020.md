id="ii.v.xiv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XVIII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xiv-p2"></span>To Romanus, Guardian (Defensorem).

<span id="ii.v.xiv-p3"></span>Gregory to Romanus, &c.

<span id="ii.v.xiv-p4"></span>Our care for the purpose before us prompts
us to commit the looking after ecclesiastical interests to active
persons.  And so, since we have found thee, Romanus, to have been a
trusty and diligent guardian, we have thought fit to commit to thy
government from this present second indiction the patrimony of the holy
Roman Church, which by the mercy of <span id="page_10">p. 10</span>
<span id="ii.v.xiv-Page_10"></span>God we serve, lying in the parts
about Syracuse, Catana, Agrigentum, and Mile (*partibus Milensibus*). 
Hence it is needful that thou go thither immediately, that, in
consideration of the divine judgment, and in memory also of our
admonition, thou mayest study to acquit thyself so efficiently and
faithfully that thou mayest be found to incur no risk for negligence or
fraud, which God forbid should be the case.  But act thus all the more
in order that thou mayest be commended to divine grace for thy
faithfulness and industry.  Moreover, we have sent orders according to
custom to the *familia* of the same patrimony <span

carrying out what has been enjoined thee.

<span id="ii.v.xiv-p5"></span> See the following Epistle XIX.  For the
meaning of *familia*here see note 3 to the same epistle.  Gregory sent
at the same time letters (which have not been translated) to three
influential laymen in Sicily, desiring them to assist and support
Romanus in the exercise of his authority.  Four other letters (23, 24,
26, 27) are translated, as intimating the kind of duties devolving on
Romanus in connexion with his government of the Patrimony.
