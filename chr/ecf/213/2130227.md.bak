<span id="iii.v.ii-p3"></span><span class="c50"><span
id="iii.v.ii-p3.1"></span>Hymn I.</span>

<span id="iii.v.ii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.ii-p4.1"></span>This</span> is the day that gladdened them,
the Prophets, Kings, and Priests, for in it were their words fulfilled,
and thus were the whole of them indeed performed!  For the Virgin this
day brought forth Immanuel in Bethlehem.  The voice that of old Isaiah
spake, <span id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354.md) to-day became reality. 
He was born there who in writing should tell the Gentiles’ number!  The
Psalm that David once sang, by its fulfilment came to-day! <span
id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355.md)   The word that Micah once
spake, <span id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356.md) to-day was come indeed to
pass!  For there came from Ephrata a Shepherd, and His staff swayed over
souls.  Lo! from Jacob shone the Star, <span
id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357.md) and from Israel rose the Head. <span
id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358.md)   The prophecy that Balaam spake had
its interpreting to-day!  Down also came the hidden Light, and from the
Body rose His beauty!  The light that spake in Zachary, to-day shined in
Bethlehem!

<span id="iii.v.ii-p10"></span>Risen is the Light of the kingdom, in
Ephrata the city of the King.  The blessing wherewith Jacob blessed, to
its fulfilment came to-day!  That tree likewise, \[the tree\] of life,
brings hope to mortal men!  Solomon’s hidden proverb <span
id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359.md) had to-day its explanation!  To-day
was born the Child, and His name was called Wonder! <span
id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360.md)   For a wonder it is that God as a
Babe should show Himself.  By the word Worm did the Spirit foreshow Him
in parable, <span id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361.md) because His
generation was without marriage.  The type that the Holy Ghost figured
to-day its meaning was \[explained.\]  He came up as a root before Him,
as a root of parched ground. <span id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362.md)  
Aught that covertly was said, openly to-day was done!  The King that in
Judah was hidden, Thamar stole Him from his thigh; to-day arose His
conquering beauty, which in hidden estate she loved.  Ruth at Boaz’ side
lay down, because the Medicine of Life hidden in him she perceived. 
To-day was fulfilled her vow, since from her seed arose the Quickener of
all.  Travail Adam on the woman brought, that from him had come forth. 
She to-day her travail ransomed, who to her a Saviour bare!  To Eve our
mother a man gave birth, who himself had had no birth.  How much more
should Eve’s daughter be believed to have borne a Child without a man! 
The virgin earth, she bare that Adam that was head over the earth!  The
Virgin bare to-day the Adam that was Head over the Heavens.  The staff
of Aaron, it budded, and the dry wood yielded fruit!  Its mystery is
cleared up to-day, for the virgin womb a Child hath borne! <span
id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363.md)

<span id="iii.v.ii-p16"></span>Shamed is that people which holds the
prophets as true; for unless our Saviour has come, their words have been
falsified!  Blessed be the True One Who came from the Father of the
Truth and fulfilled the true seers’ words, which were accomplished in
<span id="page_224">p. 224</span> <span
id="iii.v.ii-Page_224"></span>their truth.  From thy treasure-house put
forth, Lord, from the coffers of Thy Scriptures, names of righteous men
of old, who looked to see Thy coming!  Seth who was in Abel’s stead
shadowed out the Son as slain, by Whose death was dulled the envy Cain
had brought into the world!  Noah saw the sons of God, saints that
sudden waxed wanton, and the Holy Son he looked for, by whom lewd men
were turned to holiness.  The brothers twain, that covered Noah, <span
id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364.md) saw the only Son of God who should
come to hide the nakedness of Adam, who was drunk with pride.  Shem and
Japhet, being gracious, looked for the gracious Son, Who should come and
set free Canaan from the servitude of sin.

<span id="iii.v.ii-p18"></span>Melchizedek expected Him; as His
vicegerent, looked that he might see the Priesthood’s Lord whose
hyssop <span id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365.md) purifies the world.  Lot
beheld the Sodomites how they perverted nature:  for nature’s Lord he
looked who gave a holiness not natural.  Him Aaron looked for, for he
saw that if his rod ate serpents up, <span
id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366.md) His cross would eat the Serpent up
that had eaten Adam and Eve.  Moses saw the uplifted serpent that had
cured the bites of asps, and he looked to see Him who would heal the
ancient Serpent’s wound.  Moses saw that he himself alone retained the
brightness from God, and he looked for Him who came and multiplied gods
by His teaching: <span id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367.md)

<span id="iii.v.ii-p22"></span>Caleb the spy bore the cluster on the
staff, and came and longed to see the Cluster, Whose wine should comfort
the world.  Him did Jesus son of Nun long for, that he might conceive
the force of his own surname:  for if by His name he waxed so
mighty, <span id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368.md) how much more would He
by His Birth?  This Jesus that gathered and carried, and brought with
him of the fruit, was longing for the Tree of Life to taste the Fruit
that quickens all.  For Him Rahab too was looking; for when the scarlet
thread in type redeemed her from wrath, in type she tasted of the
Truth.  For Him Elijah longed, and when Him on earth he saw not, he,
through faith most throughly cleansed, mounted up in heaven to see Him. 
Moses saw Him and Elijah; the meek man from the depth ascended, the
zealous from on high descended, and in the midst beheld the Son.  They
figured the mystery of His Advent:  Moses was a type of the dead, and
Elijah a type of the living, that fly to meet Him at His coming. <span
id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369.md)   For the dead that have tasted death,
them He makes to be first:  and the rest that are not buried, are last
caught up to meet Him.

<span id="iii.v.ii-p25"></span>Who is there that can count me up the
just that looked for the Son, whose number cannot be determined by the
mouth of us weak creatures?  Pray ye for me, O beloved, that another
time with strength endued, I in another legend may so set forth their
foretaste, as I am able.  Who is adequate to the praising of the Son of
the Truth that has risen to us?  For it was for Him the righteous
longed, that in their generation they might see Him.  Adam looked for
Him, for He is the Cherub’s Lord, and could minister an entrance and a
residence hard by the branches of the Tree of life.  Abel longed after
Him, that in his days He might come; that instead of that lamb that he
offered, the Lamb of God he might behold.  For Him Eve also looked; for
woman’s nakedness was sore, and He capable to clothe them; not with
leaves, but with that same glory that they had exchanged away.  The
tower that the many builded, in mystery looked for One, who coming down
would build on earth a tower that lifts up to Heaven.  Yea the ark of
living creatures looked in a type for our Lord; for He should build the
Holy Church, wherein souls find a refuge.  In Peleg’s days earth was
divided into tongues, <span id="page_225">p. 225</span> <span
id="iii.v.ii-Page_225"></span>threescore and ten. <span
id="fr_370"></span>[371](#fn_370.md)   For Him Who by the tongues, to His
Apostles divided earth.  Earth which the flood had swallowed up, in
silence cried to her Lord.  He came down and opened Baptism, and men
were drawn by it to Heaven.  Seth and Enos, Cainan too, were surnamed
sons of God; for the Son of God they looked, that they by grace might be
His brethren.  But little short of a thousand years did Methuselah
live:  He looked for the Son Who makes heirs of life that never ends! 
Grace itself in hidden mystery was beseeching on their behalf that their
Lord might come in their age and fill up their shortcomings.  For the
Holy Spirit in them, in their stead, besought with meditation: <span
id="fr_371"></span>[372](#fn_371.md)   He stirred them up, and in Him did
they look on that Redeemer, after whom they longed. <span
id="fr_372"></span>[373](#fn_372.md)

<span id="iii.v.ii-p29"></span>The soul of just men perceive in the Son
a Medicine of life; and so it felt desires that He might come in its own
days, and then would it taste His sweetness.  Enoch was longing for Him,
and since on earth the Son he saw not, he was justified by great faith,
and mounted up in Heaven to see Him.  Who is there that will spurn at
grace, when the Gift that they of old gained not by much labour, freely
comes to men now?  For Him Lamech also looked who might come and
lovingly give Him quiet from his labour and the toiling of his hands,
and from the earth the Just One had cursed. <span
id="fr_373"></span>[374](#fn_373.md)   Lamech then beheld his son,
Noah,—him, in whom were figured types relating to the Son.  In the stead
of the Lord afar off, the type at hand afforded quiet.  Yea Noah also
longed to see Him, the taste of whose assisting graces he had tasted. 
For if the type of Him preserved living things, Himself how sure to
bestow life upon souls!  Noah longed for Him, by trial knowing Him, for
through Him had the ark been established.  For if the type of Him thus
saved life, assuredly much more would He in person.  Abraham perceived
in Spirit that the Son’s Birth was far off; instead of Him in person he
rejoiced to see even His day. <span id="fr_374"></span>[375](#fn_374.md)  
To see Him Isaac longed, as having tasted the taste of His
redemption; <span id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375.md) for if the sign of
Him so gave life, much more would He by the reality.

<span id="iii.v.ii-p33"></span>Joyous <span
id="fr_376"></span>[377](#fn_376.md) were to-day the Watchers, <span
id="fr_377"></span>[378](#fn_377.md) that the Wakeful came to wake us!  Who
would pass this night in slumber, in which all the world was watching? 
Since Adam brought into the world the sleep of death by sins, the
Wakeful came down that He might awake us from the deep sleep of sin. 
Watch not we as usurers, who thinking on money put to interest, watch at
night so oft, to reckon up their capital, and interest.  Wakeful and
cautious is the thief, who in the earth hath buried and concealed his
sleep.  His wakefulness all \[comes to\] this, that he may cause much
wakefulness to them that be asleep.  Wakeful likewise is the glutton,
who hath eaten much and is restless; his watching is to him his torment,
because he was impatient of stint.  Wakeful likewise is the merchant; of
a night he works his fingers telling over what pounds are coming, and if
his wealth doubles or trebles.  Wakeful likewise is the rich man, whose
sleep his riches chase away:  his dogs sleep; he guards his treasures
from the thieves.  Wakeful also is the careful, by his care his sleep is
swallowed:  though his end stands by his pillow, yet he wakes with cares
for years to come.  Satan teaches, O my brethren, one watching instead
of another; to good deeds to be sleepy, and to ill awake and watchful. 
Even Judas Iscariot, for the whole night through was wakeful; and he
sold the righteous Blood, that purchased the whole world.  The son of
the dark one put on darkness, having stripped the Light from off him: 
and Him who created silver, for silver the thief sold.  Yea, Pharisees,
the dark one’s sons, all the night through kept awake:  the <span
id="page_226">p. 226</span> <span id="iii.v.ii-Page_226"></span>dark
ones watched that they might veil the Light which is unlimited.  Ye then
watch as \[heaven’s\] lights in this night of starry light.  For though
so dark be its colour yet in virtue it is clear.

<span id="iii.v.ii-p36"></span>For whoever is like this clear One,
wakeful and prayerful in darkness, him in this darkness visible a light
unseen surrounds!  The bad man that in daylight stands, yet as a son of
darkness deals; though with light clad outwardly, inly is with darkness
girt.  Be we not deceived, beloved, by the fact that we are watching! 
For whoso does not rightly watch, his watch is an unrighteous watch. 
Whoso watches not cheerfully, his watching is but a sleeping:  whoso
also watches not innocently, even his waking is his foe.  This is the
waking of the envious one! a solid mass, compact with harm.  That watch
is but a trafficking, with scorn and mockery compact.  The wrathful man
if he wakes, fretful with wrath his wake will be, and his watching
proves to him full of rage and of cursings.  If the babbler be waking,
then his mouth becomes a passage which for sins is ready but for prayers
shows hindrance.

<span id="iii.v.ii-p37"></span>The wise man, if so be he that watches,
one of two things chooseth him; either takes sweet, moderate, sleep, or
a holy vigil keeps. <span id="fr_378"></span>[379](#fn_378.md)   That night
is fair, wherein He Who is Fair <span id="fr_379"></span>[380](#fn_379.md)
rose to come and make us fair.  Let not aught that may disturb it enter
into our watch!  Fair be kept the ear’s approach, <span
id="fr_380"></span>[381](#fn_380.md) chaste the seeing of the eye! hallowed
the musing of the heart! the speaking of the mouth be cleared.  Mary hid
in us to-day leaven that came from Abraham.  Let us then so pity beggars
as did Abraham the needy.  To-day the rennet fell on us from the gentle
David’s house.  Let a man show mercy to his persecutors, as did Jesse’s
son to Saul. <span id="fr_381"></span>[382](#fn_381.md)   The prophets’
sweet salt <span id="fr_382"></span>[383](#fn_382.md) is to-day sprinkled
among the Gentiles.  Let us gain a new savour <span
id="fr_383"></span>[384](#fn_383.md) by that whereby the ancient people
lost their savour.  Let us speak the speech of wisdom; speak we not of
things outside it, lest we ourselves be outside it!

<span id="iii.v.ii-p44"></span>In this night of reconcilement let no man
be wroth or gloomy! in this night that stills all, none that threatens
or disturbs!  This night belongs to the sweet One; bitter or harsh be in
it none!  In this night that is the meek One’s, high or haughty be in it
none!  In this day of pardoning let us not exact trespasses!  In this
day of gladnesses let us not spread sadnesses!  In this day so sweet,
let us not be harsh!  In this day of peaceful rest, let us not be
wrathful in it!  In this day when God came to sinners, let not the
righteous be in his mind uplifted over sinner!  In this day in which
there came the Lord of all unto the servants, let masters too condescend
to their servants lovingly!  In this day in which the Rich became poor
for our sakes, let the rich man make the poor man share with him at his
table.  On this day to us came forth the Gift, although we asked it
not!  Let us therefore bestow alms on them that cry and beg of us.  This
is the day that opened for us a gate on high to our prayers.  Let us
open also gates to supplicants that have transgressed, and of us have
asked \[forgiveness.\]  To-day the Lord of nature was against His nature
changed; let it not to us be irksome to turn our evil wills.  Fixed in
nature is the body; great or less it cannot become:  but the will has
such dominion, it can grow to any measure.  To-day Godhead sealed itself
upon Manhood, that so with the Godhead’s stamp Manhood might be adorned.

<span id="iii.v.ii-p15"></span> Notice here, how St. Ephraim (in common
with others) speaks of the *celebration* of the day as if it was the day
itself, partly in exhibiting his intense realization through faith of
the mystery and the re-presentation of it, to use the word in its
ancient sense partly as evincing, perhaps, a belief in the unabidingness
of our conceptions of time—a belief resulting, it may be, from the
mystical union with God in Christ which the saints enjoy.  For to God
time is as nothing, and those who through grace are one with Him, begin
to view things as He views them.
