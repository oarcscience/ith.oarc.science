<span id="ii.v.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.v.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Epistle LXXX.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxxvii-p2"></span>*To Castorius, Notary* <span
id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md) .

<span id="ii.v.xxxvii-p4"></span>Gregory to Castorius, &c.

<span id="ii.v.xxxvii-p5"></span>The more thou seest thyself to be
trusted by us, and charged with the conduct of cases when need arises,
the more oughtest thou to shew thyself energetic and solicitous. 
Accordingly, if Maximus of Salona, having taken oath, shall affirm that
he is not guilty of simoniacal heresy, and, as to other matters, when
merely questioned before the body of Saint Apollinaris, shall reply that
he is innocent, and shall have done penance, as we have directed, for
his disobedience, we desire that, to console him, thy Experience should
give him the letter which we have written to him <span
id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md) , wherein we have signified that we have
restored to him both our favour and communion.  For, as it befits us to
be severe to those who persist in contumacy, so to those who are again
humbled and penitent we ought not to deny a place of pardon.

<span id="ii.v.xxxvii-p7"></span>Furthermore, as to our brother
Sabinianus, bishop of Jadera <span id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md) , and
Honoratus <span id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md) , archdeacon of Salona,
or others who have had recourse to the Apostolical See, Maximus must be
very earnestly dealt with, so that he may receive them with becoming
charity, and in no way retain in his heart any grudge against them, but
live with them with pure goodwill and sincere affection.
