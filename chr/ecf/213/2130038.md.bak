<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.v.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Epistle LXV.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p2"></span>To Januarius, Bishop of Caralis
(Cagliari).

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p3"></span>Gregory to Januarius, Bishop of
Sardinia.

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p4"></span>It has come to our ears that some of
your clerics, inflated with a spirit of elation (which is a serious
thing to be said), neglect obedience to the commands of your Fraternity,
and occupying themselves rather in the services and labours of others,
desert the business of their own Church in which they are needed.  For
this reason we greatly wonder why you do not keep up the rule of
discipline, and restrain them, when wandering dissolutely at large, with
a rein of strict control to the requirements of the office they have
undertaken.  It is said also that some of these contumacious clerks, in
order to obtain support against you, resort to the patronage of our
guardian (*defensoris*) Vitalis.  Wherefore we have sent a letter to
him, telling him not to dare henceforth to support any one of your
clerks against you unreasonably; but, if any case of fault should arise
which is not a serious one but merits pardon, to approach you rather as
an intercessor than as a supporter of the culprit.  Be on your guard,
then, that no such report shall hereafter reach us of your subjects
despising you.

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p5"></span>We have learnt also that a certain widow
left her substance to the monastery of St. Julian, and that this
substance has been plundered by one of your clerks who used to direct
the actions of the deceased woman while she lived, and that he now
evades making restitution.  We therefore exhort thee that, if what is
said should prove to be true, you cause him to be constrained by strict
proceedings, to the end that he may make haste to restore without
diminution the property left to the monastery, and be compelled to give
up, even with the loss of his reputation, that which, preserving the
purity of his honour, he ought not to have dared to take.  But what a
cause for shame it is that we should appear as admonishing your
Fraternity to restrain your clerk under the vigour of discipline, this I
believe that you yourself feel in your own heart.

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p6"></span>Also against worshippers of idols, and
soothsayers, and diviners, we very earnestly exhort <span
id="page_18">p. 18</span> <span id="ii.v.xxxii-Page_18"></span>your
Fraternity to be on the watch with pastoral vigilance, and publicly
among the people hold forth against the men who do such things, and
recall them by persuasive hortation from the contagion of so great
sacrilege, and such temptation of divine judgment, and peril in the
present life.  If, however, thou shouldest find them unwilling to amend
and correct themselves from such doings, we desire thee to lay hold of
them with fervent zeal, and, in case of their being slaves, to chastise
them with blows and torments, whereby they may be brought to amendment. 
But, if they are freemen, they should be directed to penitence by
suitable and strict confinement; so that they who scorn to listen to
salutary words reclaiming them from peril of death may at any rate be
brought back by bodily torments to the desired sanity of mind.  We have
also been informed that, you having committed the care of your patrimony
to certain laymen, they, after having been detected in depredations on
your peasants and flight in consequence, both refuse to restore the
property which, as not being subject to your control, they indecently
retain as though it were in their own power, and also scorn to render
you an account of their doings.  If this be so, it is fitting that the
matter be strictly investigated by you, and the case between them and
the peasants of your Church be thoroughly examined.  And whatever fraud
may be discovered in them let them be compelled to make restitution for
with the penalty appointed by the laws.  But for the future your
Fraternity must take care that ecclesiastical property be not committed
to secular men not living under your rule, but to approved clerics
holding office under you; in whom if any wrong doing should be found,
you may be able to correct what has been unlawfully done, as in the case
of persons under you, whom the obligation of their condition convenes
before you rather than excuses.
