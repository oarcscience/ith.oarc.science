<p><a name="ii.v.xx-p5"></A>On hearing that your Glory had been severely afflicted with grief and sickness, I condoled with you exceedingly.&#160; But learning presently that the malady had entirely left you, I soon turned my sorrow into joy, and returned great thanks to Almighty God for that He smote that He might heal, afflicted that He might lead to true joys.&#160; For hence it is written, <i>Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#006">Heb. xii. 6</a><a name="ii.v.xx-p5.1"></A>).&#160; Hence the Truth in person says, <i>My Father is the husbandman, and every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he will take away; but every branch that beareth fruit, he will purge it, that it may bring forth more fruit</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001">John 15:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#002">2</a><a name="ii.v.xx-p5.2"></A>).&#160; For the unfruitful branch is taken away, because a sinner is utterly rooted up.&#160; But the fruitful branch is said to be purged, because it is cut down by discipline that it may be brought to more abundant grace.&#160; For so the grain of the ears of corn, beaten with the threshing instrument, is stript of its awn and chaff.&#160; So the olives, pressed in the oil-press, flow forth into the fatness of oil.&#160; So the bunches of grapes pounded with the heels, liquify into wine.&#160; Rejoice, therefore, good man, for that in this thy <A NAME="page_12"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 12</FONT></A> <a name="ii.v.xx-Page_12"></A>scourge and this thy advancement thou seest that thou art loved by the Eternal Judge.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.v.xx-p6"></A>Furthermore, I beg that my daughter Gloriosa, your wife, be greeted in my name.&#160; Now may Almighty God keep you under heavenly protection, and comfort you both now with abundance of gifts and hereafter with the retribution of reward.</p>
