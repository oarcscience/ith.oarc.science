<span id="iii.v.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.v.ix-p1.1"></span>Hymn VIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.ix-p2.1"></span>That</span> Thy Resurrection might be believed
among the gainsayers, they sealed Thee up within the sepulchre, and set
guards; for it was for Thee that they sealed the sepulchre and set
guards, O Son of the Living One!

<span id="iii.v.ix-p3"></span>When they had buried Thee, if they had
neglected Thee and left Thee, and gone, there would have been room to
lie \[and say\] that they did steal, O Quickener of all!  When they
craftily sealed Thy sepulchre, they made Thy Glory greater.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p4"></span>A type of Thee therefore was Daniel, and
also Lazarus; one in the den, which the Gentiles sealed up, and one in
the sepulchre, that the People opened.  Lo! their signs and their seals
reproved them.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p5"></span>Their mouth had been open, if they had
left Thy sepulchre open.  But they went away because they had shut Thy
sepulchre and sealed it, and closed up their own mouths.  Yea they
closed it, and when they had senselessly covered Thy sepulchre, all the
slanderers covered their own heads.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p6"></span>But in Thy Resurrection Thou persuadest
them concerning Thy Birth; since the womb was sealed, and the sepulchre
closed up; being alike pure in the womb, and living in the
sepulchre. <span id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460.md)   The womb and the
sepulchre being sealed were witnesses unto Thee.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p8"></span>The belly and hell cried aloud of Thy
Birth and Thy Resurrection:  The belly conceived Thee, which was sealed;
hell brought Thee forth which was closed up.  Not after nature did
either the belly conceive Thee, or hell give Thee up!

<span id="iii.v.ix-p9"></span>Sealed was the sepulchre whereto they had
entrusted Thee, that it might keep the dead \[safe\], Virgin was the
womb which no man knew.  Virgin womb and sealed sepulchre, like
trumpets, proclaimed Him in the ears of a deaf people.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p10"></span>The sealed belly and the closed rock were
amongst the accusers.  For they slandered the Conception as being of the
seed of man, and the Resurrection as being of the robbery of man; the
seal and the signet convicted them, and pleaded that Thou wert of
Heaven.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p11"></span>The people stood between Thy Birth and
Thy Resurrection.  They slandered Thy Birth, Thy Death condemned them: 
they set aside Thy Resurrection, Thy Birth refuted them; they were two
wrestlers that stopped the mouth that slandered.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p12"></span>For Elijah they went and searched the
mountains: <span id="fr_461"></span>[462](#fn_461.md)   as they sought him
on earth, they the more confirmed that he was taken up.  Their searching
bare witness that he was taken up, in that it found him not.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p14"></span>If then prophets that had had forewarning
of Elijah’s ascension, doubted as it were of his going up, how much more
would impure men speak slander of the Son?  By their own guards He
convinced them that He was risen again.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p15"></span>To Thy Mother, Lord, no man knew what
name to give.  Should he call her Virgin, her Child stood \[there\]; and
married no man knew her to be!  If then none comprehended Thy Mother,
who shall suffice for Thee?

<span id="iii.v.ix-p16"></span>For she was, alone, Thy Mother; along
with all, Thy Sister.  She was Thy mother, she was Thy Sister.  She
along with chaste women <span id="fr_462"></span>[463](#fn_462.md) was Thy
betrothed.  With everything didst Thou adorn Her, Thou ornament of Thy
Mother.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p18"></span><span id="page_242">p. 242</span> <span
id="iii.v.ix-Page_242"></span>For she was Thy Bride by nature ere Thou
hadst come; she conceived Thee not by nature after Thou wast come, O
Holy One, and was a Virgin when she had brought Thee forth holily.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p19"></span>Mary gained in Thee, O Lord, the honours
of all married women.  She conceived \[Thee\] within her without
marriage.  There was milk in her breasts, not after the way of nature. 
Thou madest the thirsty land suddenly a fountain of milk.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p20"></span>If she carried Thee, Thy mighty look made
her burden light; if she gave Thee to eat, it was because Thou wert
hungry; if she gave Thee to drink \[it was\], because Thou wert thirsty;
willingly if she embraced Thee, Thou, the coal of mercies, didst keep
her bosom safe.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p21"></span>A wonder is Thy Mother.  The Lord entered
her, and became a servant:  the Word entered her, and became silent
within her; thunder entered her, and His voice was still:  the Shepherd
of all entered her; He became a Lamb in her, and came forth bleating.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p22"></span>The Belly of Thy Mother changed the order
of things, O Thou that orderest all!  The rich went in, He came out
poor:  the High One went in, He came out lowly.  Brightness went into
her and clothed Himself, and came forth a despised form.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p23"></span>The Mighty went in, and clad Himself with
fear from the Belly.  He that giveth food to all went in, and gat
hunger.  He that giveth all to drink went in, and gat thirst.  Naked and
bare came forth from her the Clother of all.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p24"></span>The daughters of the Hebrews that cried
in the Lamentations of Jeremiah, instead of lamentations of their
Scriptures, used lulling-songs from their own books:  a hidden Power
within their words was prophesying.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p25"></span>Eve lifted up her eyes from Sheol and
rejoiced in that day, because the Son of her daughter as a medicine of
life came down to raise up the mother of His mother.  Blessed Babe, that
bruised the head of the Serpent that smote her!

<span id="iii.v.ix-p26"></span>She saw the type of Thee from the youth
of Isaac the fair.  For Thee Sarah, as seeing that types of thee rested
on his childhood, called him, saying, O child of my vows, in whom is
hidden the Lord of vows.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p27"></span>Samson the Nazarite shadowed forth a type
of Thy working.  He tore the lion, the image of death, whom Thou didst
destroy, and caused to go forth from his bitterness the sweetness of
life for men.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p28"></span>Hannah also embraced Samuel; for Thy
righteousness was hidden in him who hewed in pieces Agag as \[a type\]
of the wicked one.  He wept over Saul, because Thy goodness also was
shadowed forth in him. <span id="fr_463"></span>[464](#fn_463.md)

<span id="iii.v.ix-p30"></span>How meek art Thou!  How mighty art Thou,
O Child! <span id="fr_464"></span>[465](#fn_464.md)  Thy judgment is
mighty, Thy love is sweet!  Who can stand against Thee?  Thy Father is
in Heaven, Thy Mother is on earth; who shall declare Thee? <span
id="fr_465"></span>[466](#fn_465.md)

<span id="iii.v.ix-p33"></span>If a man should seek after Thy Nature, it
is hidden in Heaven in the mighty Bosom of the Godhead; and if a man
seek after Thy visible Body, it is laid down before their eyes in the
lowly bosom of Mary.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p34"></span>The mind wanders between Thy generations,
O Thou Rich One!  Thick folds are upon Thy Godhead.  Who can sound Thy
depths, Thou great Sea that made itself little?

<span id="iii.v.ix-p35"></span>We come to see Thee as God, and, lo! Thou
art a man:  we come to see Thee as man, and there shineth forth the
Light of Thy Godhead!

<span id="iii.v.ix-p36"></span>Who would believe that Thou art the Heir
of David’s Throne?  A manger hast Thou inherited out of \[all\] his
beds, a cave has come down to Thee out of all his palaces.  Instead of
his chariots a common ass’s colt, perchance, comes down to Thee.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p37"></span><span id="page_243">p. 243</span> <span
id="iii.v.ix-Page_243"></span>How fearless art Thou, O Babe, that dost
let all have thee \[to carry\]:  upon every one that meets with Thee
dost Thou smile:  to every one that sees Thee, art Thou glad-some!  Thy
love is as one that hungers after men.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p38"></span>Thou makest no distinction between Thy
fathers and strangers, nor Thy Mother and maidservants, nor her that
suckled Thee and the unclean.  Was it Thy forwardness or Thy love, O
Thou that lovest all?

<span id="iii.v.ix-p39"></span>What moves Thee that Thou didst let all
that saw Thee have Thee, both rich and poor?  Thou helpedst them that
called Thee not.  Whence came it that Thou hungeredst so for men?

<span id="iii.v.ix-p40"></span>How great was Thy love, that if one
rebuked Thee, Thou wast not wroth! if a man threatened Thee, Thou wast
not terrified! if one hissed at Thee, Thou didst not feel vexed!  Thou
art above the laws of the avengers of injuries.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p41"></span>Moses was meek, and \[yet\] his zeal was
harsh, for he struggled and slew.  Elisha also, who restored a child to
life, tore a multitude of children in pieces by bears.  Who art Thou, O
Child, whose love is greater than that of the Prophets?

<span id="iii.v.ix-p42"></span>The son of Hagar who was wild, kicked at
Isaac. <span id="fr_466"></span>[467](#fn_466.md)   He bore it and was
silent, and his mother was jealous.  Art Thou the mystery of him, or is
not he the type of Thee? art thou like Isaac, or is it not he that is
like Thee?
