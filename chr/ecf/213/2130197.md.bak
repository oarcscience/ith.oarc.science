<span id="iii.iv.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Hymn XX.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.xxi-p2"></span>1.  O virgin-youth that art become
bridegroom, move to a little jealousy thy mind, towards her who is the
wife of thy youth:  cut off the attachments which she had, in her
girlhood with many others; rebuke her and call together her affections,
that she may know what she is and whose she is.  In thee may she desire
yea love, Christ the Bridegroom of truth.  *R., Blessed be He Who
betrothes her to His Only Begotten!*

<span id="iii.iv.xxi-p3"></span>2.  Be jealous O husbandman against the
tares, which have sprung up and entangled themselves among the wheat. 
Easy is it to root up the thicket, rather than the despised:  if a
slight breeze bears it, it attacks the sowing and conquers it.  That
which three husbandmen have sown, may it return in threefold measure!
thirty-fold and sixty and an hundred!  *R., Blessed be He Who makes rich
thine increase!*

<span id="iii.iv.xxi-p4"></span>3.  A new shepherd for him it is right,
that he should oversee the flock in new wise, and should know what is
the number of it, and should see what are its needs.  A flock it is that
was purchased with the blood, of that chief of the shepherds.  Call thou
and cause to pass each sheep by its name, for it is a flock whereof the
name is written, and its reckoning in the Book of life.  *R., Blessed be
He Who will require the number thereof!*

<span id="iii.iv.xxi-p5"></span>4.  Lo the spouse of thy Lord is with
thee! keep her from all harm, and from men that deal corruptly, and call
the congregations by their own names.  The name of her spouse is set on
her; let her not go a whoring for another name, for she was not baptized
in the name of man; with Names wherein she was baptized let her make
confession, of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.  *R., Blessed
be He by Whose Name she is called!*

<span id="iii.iv.xxi-p6"></span>5.  The Apostle her betrother was
jealous over her, that she should not be corrupted by names, yet not by
names that were false, but not even by names that were true; not by
Cephas yea not by his *name*.  They who were true betrothers, set the
Name of her betrothed upon her; the false *betrothers* like
whoremongers, set their own names on the flock.  *R., Glory be to Thy
Name, our Creator!*

<span id="iii.iv.xxi-p7"></span>6.  The stamp on living creatures, O my
brethren, no man destroys openly; and a <span id="page_191">p.
191</span> <span id="iii.iv.xxi-Page_191"></span>name that is signed to
a letter, no man adds to or alters:  whoso effaces the stamp is a thief;
and whoso alters the name is a falsifier.  The name of Christ has been
altered; names of falsehood lo! have been set, upon the congregations
that have been corrupted.  *R., Blessed be He Who has called His flock
by His Name!*

<span id="iii.iv.xxi-p8"></span>7.  Look at the Prophets and Apostles,
how like they are each to the other!  By the Prophets the Name of God,
was set on the flock of God; and by the Apostles the Name of Christ, was
set on the Church of Christ.  The false *betrothers also* are like one
another for by their names are called, the congregations who commit
whoredom with them.  *R., Blessed be He in Whose Name we were
sanctified!*
