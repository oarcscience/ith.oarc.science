<p class="c23"><a name="ii.v.xxiv-p3"></A>Gregory to Theodelinda, &amp;c.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.v.xxiv-p4"></A>How your Excellency has laboured earnestly and kindly, as is your wont, for the conclusion of peace we have learnt from the report of our son, the abbot Probus.&#160; Nor indeed was it otherwise to be expected of your Christianity than that you would in all ways skew your assiduity and goodness in the cause of peace.&#160; Wherefore we give thanks to Almighty God, who so rules your heart with His loving-kindness that, as He has given you a right faith, so He also grants you to work always what is pleasing in His sight.&#160; For you may be assured, most excellent daughter, that for the saving of so much bloodshed on both sides you have acquired no small reward.&#160; On this account, returning thanks for your goodwill, we implore the mercy of our God to repay you with good in body and soul here and in the world to come.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.v.xxiv-p5"></A>Moreover, greeting you with fatherly affection, we exhort you so to deal with your most excellent consort that he may not reject the alliance of the Christian republic.&#160; For, as I believe you know yourself, it is in many ways profitable that he should be inclined to betake himself to its friendship.&#160; Do you then, after your manner, always strive for what tends to goodwill and conciliation between the parties, and labour wherever an occasion of reaping a reward presents itself, that you may commend your good deeds the more before the eyes of Almighty God.</p>
