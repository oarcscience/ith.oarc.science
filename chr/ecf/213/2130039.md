id="ii.v.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Epistle LXVII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxxiii-p2"></span>*To Constantius, Bishop of Milan* <span
id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45) .

<span id="ii.v.xxxiii-p4"></span>Gregory to Constantius, &c.

<span id="ii.v.xxxiii-p5"></span>Maximus, the prevaricator of the Church
of Salona, after he had failed to obtain anything through the greater
powers of the world, has betaken himself to the lesser ones; and by a
superfluity of prayers and by attestation to his good works he strives
to prevail with us.  This being so, I have thought it would be inhuman
in me, if he who says that he fears me much were quite unable to find me
in some degree more indulgent.  And I have therefore decided that our
most reverend brother and fellow-bishop Marinianus should take
cognizance of his cause in the city of Ravenna.  If, however, by any
chance his person is suspected, we desire that your Fraternity also, if
it is not too laborious for you, should take the trouble of repairing to
the same city, and sit together with our aforesaid brother in the same
trial.  Whatever, then, may seem good to each of your Holinesses, know
that it will seem good to me; and your judgment I accept as my own; and
what things you both think should be remitted, be assured that I remit;
taking, however, careful heed that we may not appear to be either
sinfully remiss or austere to the injury of Holy Church.  We have
enjoined the execution of this matter on the Chartulary Castorius, that
he may fully report to us all that has been done.
