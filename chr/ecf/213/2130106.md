id="ii.vii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Epistle LVIII.</span>

<span id="ii.vii.xxiv-p2"></span>To Divers Bishops of Gaul.

<span id="ii.vii.xxiv-p3"></span>Gregory to Mennas of Telona (*Toulon*),
Serenus of Massilia (*Marseilles*), Lupus of Cabillonum
(*Châlons-sur-Saône*), Aigulfus of Mettæ (*Metz*), Simplicius of Parisii
(*Paris*), Melantius of Rotonius (*Rouen*), and Licinius <span
id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) , bishops of the Franks.  *A paribus.*

<span id="ii.vii.xxiv-p5"></span>Though the care of the office you have
undertaken reminds your Fraternity how you ought to assist with all your
endeavours religious men, and especially those who labour in behalf of
souls, yet it is not beside the purpose that an address by letter from
us should stimulate your assiduity, since, as a fire becomes larger from
a blast of air, so the purposes of a good disposition are advanced by
commendation.  Inasmuch, then, as through <span id="page_72">p.
72</span> <span id="ii.vii.xxiv-Page_72"></span>the co-operating, grace
of our Redeemer so great a multitude of the nation of the Angli is being
converted to the grace of Christian faith that our most reverend common
brother and fellow-bishop Augustine asserts that those who are with him
cannot suffice for carrying out this work in divers places, we have made
provision by sending to him a few monks with our most beloved common
sons Laurentius the presbyter and Mellitus the abbot.  And so let your
Fraternity shew them the charity that becomes you, and so make haste to
aid them wherever there may be need, that through your assistance they
may have no cause for delay in your parts, and that both they themselves
may rejoice with you in being relieved by your consolation, and you, by
affording them your succour, may be found partakers in the cause in
furtherance of which they have been sent.
