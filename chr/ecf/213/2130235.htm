<p class="c23"><a name="iii.v.x-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.x-p2.1"></A>Come</span> rest, and be still in the bosom of Thy Mother, Son of the Glorious.&#160; Forwardness fits not the sons of kings.&#160; O Son of David, Thou art glorious, and [yet] the Son of Mary, who dost hide Thy beauty in the inner chamber.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.x-p3"></A>To whom art Thou like, glad Babe, fair little One, Whose Mother is a Virgin, Whose Father is hidden, Whom even the Seraphim are not able to look upon?&#160; Tell us whom Thou art like, O Son of the Gracious!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.x-p4"></A>When the wrathful came to see Thee, Thou madest them gladsome:&#160; they exchanged smiles one with another:&#160; the angry were made gentle in Thee, O sweet One.&#160; Blessed art Thou, little One, for that in Thee even the bitter are made sweet.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.x-p5"></A>Who ever saw a Babe that was gladsome when in arms to those that came near him, lo! reached Himself unto them that were far off?&#160; Fair sight [to see] a Child, that takes thought for every man that they may see him!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.x-p6"></A>He that hath care came and saw Thee, and his care fled away.&#160; He that had anxiety; at Thee forgat his anxiety; the hungry by Thee forgat his victuals; and he that had an errand, by Thee was errant and forgot his journey!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.x-p7"></A>O still Thyself, and let men go to their works!&#160; Thou art a son of the poor, learn from Thyself that all the poor had to leave their work to come.&#160; Thou who lovest men, hast bound men together by Thy gladsomeness.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.x-p8"></A>David, that stately king, took branches,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_467"></A><A HREF="#fn_467"><FONT SIZE="1">468</FONT></A>
 and in the feast amongst the children as he danced, he gave praise.&#160; Is it not the love of David Thy father that is warm in Thee?</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.x-p10"></A>That daughter of Saul! her father&#146;s devil spake in her:&#160; she called the stately [king] a vile fellow, because he gave an ensample to the elders of her people of taking up branches with the children in the day of praise to Thee.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.x-p11"></A>Who would not fear to lay it to Thee that Thou art forward?&#160; For lo, the daughter of Saul who mocked the child, cut off her womb from childbearing; because her mouth derided, the reward of its mouth was barrenness.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_468"></A><A HREF="#fn_468"><FONT SIZE="1">469</FONT></A>

<p><a name="iii.v.x-p13"></A><A NAME="page_244"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 244</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.x-Page_244"></A>Let mouths tremble at blasphemy, lest they be shut up!&#160; Refrain, O daughter of Sion, thy mouth from Him, for He is the Son of David, Who is gladsome before thee.&#160; Be not unto Him as the daughter of Saul, whose race is extinct.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.x-p14"></A>Because Elijah restrained the desire of the body, he withheld rain from the adulterous; because he kept under his body, he withheld dew from the whoremongers, who let their fountains be loosely poured out.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.x-p15"></A>Because the hidden fire of the lust of the body ruled not in him, to him the fire from on high was obedient.&#160; And since he subdued on the earth the lust of the flesh, he went up thither where holiness dwells and is at peace.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.x-p16"></A>Elisha also who deadened his own body, quickened the dead.&#160; The resurrection of the dead was in the usual course by a sanctification not in the usual course; He raised the child, because he purified his soul like a weaned child.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.x-p17"></A>Moses, who divided and separated himself from his wife, divided the sea before the harlot.&#160; Zipporah though daughter of a heathen priest kept sanctity:&#160; with a calf the daughter of Abraham&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_469"></A><A HREF="#fn_469"><FONT SIZE="1">470</FONT></A>
