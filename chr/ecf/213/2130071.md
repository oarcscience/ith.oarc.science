id="ii.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XIX.</span>

<span id="ii.vi.iv-p2"></span>To Anthemius, Subdeacon.

<span id="ii.vi.iv-p3"></span>Gregory to Anthemius, Subdeacon of
Campania.

<span id="ii.vi.iv-p4"></span>After he who had been elected to the
episcopate of the city of Surrentum had appeared to us to be unfit, they
elected Amandus, presbyter of the oratory of Saint Severinus, which is
in the Lucullan camp.  Wherefore we enjoin on thy Experience, laying
aside excuses, to take care to send the said presbyter to us with all
speed, to the end that, if there is nothing to hinder him from coming,
the desires of the petitioners may with the help of Christ be
fulfilled.  As to his life and deeds, seeing that they can be better
known where he has long lived, let it be thy care, together with our
brother and fellow-bishop, Fortunatus <span
id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106) , to make diligent enquiry.  And if
there is nothing in the way of his promotion to the sacred order, he
should be sent to us without any delay.  But, lest our glorious daughter
Clementina should take this amiss, let thy Experience go to her, and do
this thing with her consent.  If, however, she should be disposed to
resist, let thy Experience still send him hither without delay, since we
ought so to pacify the minds of our children as still not to obstruct
benefit to souls.
