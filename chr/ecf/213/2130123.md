id="ii.viii.ii-p1.1"></span>Epistle VIII.</span>

<span id="ii.viii.ii-p2"></span>*To Columbus, Bishop of Numidia* <span
id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) .

<span id="ii.viii.ii-p4"></span>Gregory to Columbus, &c.

<span id="ii.viii.ii-p5"></span>How serious, and intolerable even to be
heard of, is the complaint of Donadeus, the bearer of these presents,
who describes himself as having been a deacon, will be made manifest to
your Fraternity by the petition presented by him, which is contained in
what is subjoined below.  But, since it has come to our ears that he had
been deposed for bodily sin, let your Love make full enquiry into this,
and, if it is so, let him be consigned to penance, that he may free
himself by tears from the bond of the profligacy of which he has been
guilty.  If, however, he should be proved innocent of any such
transgression, all that his petition contains must be enquired into with
diligent examination by you, together with the primate of the council,
and others our brethren and fellow-bishops.  And, if his complaint is
supported by the truth, let both such strictness of canonical discipline
be brought to bear on his bishop Victor <span
id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) , who has not lighted to commit so
great a wickedness against God and his own priestly profession, that he
may understand the wickedness of what he has done; and let the man
himself be restored to his order:  for it is indeed preposterous, and
con<span id="page_88">p. 88</span> <span
id="ii.viii.ii-Page_88"></span>fessedly against ecclesiastical order,
that any one whom his own fault or crime does not depose from the rank
of the office which he fills should be deprived invalidly at the will of
this or that person.
