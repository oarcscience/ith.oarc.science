<span id="ii.v.i-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.v.i-p2.1"></span>Epistle I.</span>

<span id="ii.v.i-p3"></span>To Januarius, Bishop of Caralis (Cagliari).

<span id="ii.v.i-p4"></span>Gregory to Januarius, &c.

<span id="ii.v.i-p5"></span>The preacher of Almighty God, Paul the
apostle, says, *Rebuke not an elder* ([1 Tim. v.
1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001)<span id="ii.v.i-p5.1"></span>.md).  But
this rule of his is to be observed in cases where the fault of an elder
does not draw through his example the hearts of the younger into ruin. 
But, when an elder sets an example to the young for their ruin, he is to
be smitten with severe rebuke.  For it is written, *Ye are all a snare
to the young* ([Isa. 1:0](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#000.md), [Isa.
42:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#022)<span id="ii.v.i-p5.2"></span>.md). 
And again the prophet says, *The sinner being an hundred years old is
accursed* ([Isa. 1:0](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#000.md), [Isa.
65:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#020)<span id="ii.v.i-p5.3"></span>.md). 
But so great wickedness has been reported to us of thy old age that,
unless we were humanely disposed, we should smite thee with a definitive
curse.  For it has been told me that on the Lord’s day, before
celebrating the solemnities of mass, thou wentest forth to plough up the
crop of the bearer of these presents, and after ploughing it up didst
celebrate the solemnities of mass.  Also, after the solemnities of mass
thou didst not fear to root up the landmarks of that possession.  What
punishment ought to follow such deeds all who hear of them know.  We
had, however, been in doubt as to so great perversity in thee as this;
but our son Cyriacus the abbot <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) ,
having been questioned by us, declared that when he was at Caralis he
knew it to be the case.  And, seeing that we still spare thy gray hairs,
bethink thee at length, old man, and restrain thyself from such levity
of behaviour, and perversity of deeds.  The nearer thou art approaching
death, the more careful and fearful oughtest thou to become.  And indeed
a sentence of punishment had been launched against thee; but, since we
know thy simplicity accompanying thy old age, we meanwhile hold our
peace.  Those, however, by whose advice thou hast done these things we
decree to be excommunicated for two months; but so that, if within the
space of two months anything should happen to them after the manner of
humanity they be not deprived of the blessing of the viaticum.  But do
thou henceforth be cautious to stand aloof from their counsels, lest, if
thou be their disciple in evil whose master thou oughtest to have been
in good, we no longer spare either thy simplicity or thy old age.
