<p class="c18"><a name="ii.v.xxxii-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="ii.v.xxxii-p1.1"></A>Epistle LXV.</span></p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ii.v.xxxii-p2"></A>To Januarius, Bishop of Caralis (Cagliari).</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="ii.v.xxxii-p3"></A>Gregory to Januarius, Bishop of Sardinia.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.v.xxxii-p4"></A>It has come to our ears that some of your clerics, inflated with a spirit of elation (which is a serious thing to be said), neglect obedience to the commands of your Fraternity, and occupying themselves rather in the services and labours of others, desert the business of their own Church in which they are needed.&#160; For this reason we greatly wonder why you do not keep up the rule of discipline, and restrain them, when wandering dissolutely at large, with a rein of strict control to the requirements of the office they have undertaken.&#160; It is said also that some of these contumacious clerks, in order to obtain support against you, resort to the patronage of our guardian (<i>defensoris</i>) Vitalis.&#160; Wherefore we have sent a letter to him, telling him not to dare henceforth to support any one of your clerks against you unreasonably; but, if any case of fault should arise which is not a serious one but merits pardon, to approach you rather as an intercessor than as a supporter of the culprit.&#160; Be on your guard, then, that no such report shall hereafter reach us of your subjects despising you.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.v.xxxii-p5"></A>We have learnt also that a certain widow left her substance to the monastery of St. Julian, and that this substance has been plundered by one of your clerks who used to direct the actions of the deceased woman while she lived, and that he now evades making restitution.&#160; We therefore exhort thee that, if what is said should prove to be true, you cause him to be constrained by strict proceedings, to the end that he may make haste to restore without diminution the property left to the monastery, and be compelled to give up, even with the loss of his reputation, that which, preserving the purity of his honour, he ought not to have dared to take.&#160; But what a cause for shame it is that we should appear as admonishing your Fraternity to restrain your clerk under the vigour of discipline, this I believe that you yourself feel in your own heart.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.v.xxxii-p6"></A>Also against worshippers of idols, and soothsayers, and diviners, we very earnestly exhort <A NAME="page_18"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 18</FONT></A> <a name="ii.v.xxxii-Page_18"></A>your Fraternity to be on the watch with pastoral vigilance, and publicly among the people hold forth against the men who do such things, and recall them by persuasive hortation from the contagion of so great sacrilege, and such temptation of divine judgment, and peril in the present life.&#160; If, however, thou shouldest find them unwilling to amend and correct themselves from such doings, we desire thee to lay hold of them with fervent zeal, and, in case of their being slaves, to chastise them with blows and torments, whereby they may be brought to amendment.&#160; But, if they are freemen, they should be directed to penitence by suitable and strict confinement; so that they who scorn to listen to salutary words reclaiming them from peril of death may at any rate be brought back by bodily torments to the desired sanity of mind.&#160; We have also been informed that, you having committed the care of your patrimony to certain laymen, they, after having been detected in depredations on your peasants and flight in consequence, both refuse to restore the property which, as not being subject to your control, they indecently retain as though it were in their own power, and also scorn to render you an account of their doings.&#160; If this be so, it is fitting that the matter be strictly investigated by you, and the case between them and the peasants of your Church be thoroughly examined.&#160; And whatever fraud may be discovered in them let them be compelled to make restitution for with the penalty appointed by the laws.&#160; But for the future your Fraternity must take care that ecclesiastical property be not committed to secular men not living under your rule, but to approved clerics holding office under you; in whom if any wrong doing should be found, you may be able to correct what has been unlawfully done, as in the case of persons under you, whom the obligation of their condition convenes before you rather than excuses.</p>
