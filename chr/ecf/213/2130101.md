id="ii.vii.xix-p1.1"></span>Epistle L.</span>

<span id="ii.vii.xix-p2"></span>To Adrian, Notary.

<span id="ii.vii.xix-p3"></span>Gregory to Adrian, Notary of Panormus.

<span id="ii.vii.xix-p4"></span>Agathosa, the bearer of these presents,
complains that her husband has, against her will, been converted <span
id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162) in the monastery of the abbot
Urbicus.  And, since this undoubtedly touches the credit and reputation
of the said abbot, we enjoin thy Experience to investigate the matter by
diligent enquiry, so as to see whether it may not be the case that the
man’s conversion was with her consent, or that she herself had promised
to change her state.  And should it be found to be so, see to his
remaining in the monastery, and compel her to change her state, as she
had promised.  If however neither of these things is the case, and you
do not find that the aforesaid woman has committed any crime of
fornication on account of which it is lawful for a man to leave his
wife, then, lest his conversion should possibly be an occasion of
perdition to the wife left behind in the world, we desire thee, without
any excuse allowed, to restore her husband to her, even though he should
be already tonsured.  For, although mundane law declares that marriage
may be dissolved for the sake of conversion against the will of either
party, yet divine law does not permit this to be done.  For, save for
the cause of fornication, a man is on no account allowed to put away his
wife, seeing that after the husband and wife have been made one body by
the copulation of wedlock, it cannot be in part converted, and in part
remain in the world <span id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163) .
