<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.viii-p3"></A>1.&#160; The flock of Jacob came down&#8212;and stood round the well of water.&#8212;In the water they put on the similitude of the wood that was covered <i>by it</i>.&#8212;Mysteries <i>these</i> and types of the Cross,&#8212;wherein the parables are interpreted.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p4"></A>2.&#160; There are shown in <i>these</i> rods similitudes,&#8212;and in the sheep, parables.&#8212;The Cross in the rods is figured, and in the sheep the souls <i>of men</i>.&#8212;His wood was a mystery of our Wood;&#8212;likewise his sheep a mystery of our flock.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p5"></A>3.&#160; The sheep of Christ rejoice,&#8212;and stand round the laver of baptism;&#8212;in the water they put on the likeness&#8212;of the living and goodly Cross&#8212;whereon gaze all things created,&#8212;and all of it is stamped on them all.</p>

<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p7"></A>5.&#160; Moses drew <i>water</i> and watered the sheep&#8212;of Jethro the priest of sin.&#8212;But our Shepherd has baptized His sheep&#8212;Who is the high priest of truth.&#8212;At the well the flocks were dumb,&#8212;but here the sheep have speech.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p8"></A>6.&#160; The People passed through the water and were baptized:&#8212;the People came up on dry land and became <i>as</i> heathen.&#8212;The Commandment was savourless in their ears;&#8212;the manna corrupted in their vessels.&#8212;Eat ye the living Body,&#8212;the medicine of life that gives life to all!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p9"></A>7.&#160; To the sons of Lot Moses said,&#8212;&#8220;Give us water for money,&#8212;let us only pass by through your border.&#8221;&#8212;They refused the way, and the temporal water.&#8212;Lo! the living water freely&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_511"></A><A HREF="#fn_511"><FONT SIZE="1">512</FONT></A>
 <i>given</i>,&#8212;and the path that leads to Eden!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p11"></A>8.&#160; From the water Gideon chose for himself&#8212;the men who were victorious in the battle.&#8212;Ye have gone down to the victorious waters:&#8212;come ye up and triumph in the fight!&#8212;receive from the water atonement,&#8212;and from the fight the crowning!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p12"></A>9.&#160; Ye baptized, receive your lamps,&#8212;like the lamps of the house of Gideon;&#8212;conquer the darkness by your lamps,&#8212;and the silence by your hosannas!&#8212;Gideon likewise in the battle&#8212;triumphed by the shout and the flame.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p13"></A>10.&#160; David the King longed after&#8212;the water of the well, and they brought it him;&#8212;but he drank it not, for he saw that with blood of men it was bought.&#8212;In the midst of the water ye have revelled&#8212;that was bought with the blood of God.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p14"></A>11.&#160; Out of Edom the prophet saw&#8212;God <i>coming</i> as one that <i>presses the grapes</i>.&#8212;He made ready the winepress of wrath,&#8212;He trod down the peoples and delivered the People.&#8212;He has turned and ordained Baptism;&#8212;the peoples live, the People is come to nought.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p15"></A>12.&#160; In the river Jeremiah buried&#8212;the linen girdle that was marred;&#8212;and [the People] waxed old and decayed.&#8212;&#8230;&#8212;The peoples that were decayed and marred,&#8212;by the waters have been clad in newness.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p16"></A>13.&#160; In Siloam,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_512"></A><A HREF="#fn_512"><FONT SIZE="1">513</FONT></A>
 the blessed stream&#8212;the priests anointed Solomon.&#8212;His youth was had in honour;&#8212;his old age was despised.&#8212;Through the pure waters ye have been clad&#8212;in the purity of Heaven.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p18"></A>14.&#160; The fleece that was dry from the dew,&#8212;Jerusalem was figured in it:&#8212;the bason that was filled with water,&#8212;Baptism was figured in it.&#8212;That was dry after the manner of its type;&#8212;this was full after the manner of its symbol.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p19"></A>15.&#160; The wearied body in water&#8212;washes and is refreshed from its toil.&#8212;Lo! the laver in which are hidden&#8212;refreshing and life and delights.&#8212;In it wearied Adam had rest&#8212;who brought labour into the creation.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p20"></A>16.&#160; The fountain of sweat in the body&#8212;is set <i>to protect</i> against fever:&#8212;the fountain of Baptism&#8212;is set <i>to protect</i> against the Flame.&#8212;This is the water that avails&#8212;for the quenching of Gehenna.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p21"></A>17.&#160; He who journeys through the desert,&#8212;as armour takes to himself water&#8212;against all-conquering thirst.&#8212;Go ye down to the fountain of Christ,&#8212;receive life in your members,&#8212;as armour against death.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p22"></A>18.&#160; Again, the diver brings up&#8212;out of the sea the pearl.&#8212;Be baptized and bring up from the water&#8212;purity that therein is hidden,&#8212;the pearl that is set as a jewel&#8212;in the crown of the Godhead.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p23"></A><A NAME="page_276"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 276</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vi.viii-Page_276"></A>19.&#160; Sweet water in his vessel&#8212;the seaman lays up as a store;&#8212;in the midst of the sea he lays up and keeps it, the sweet in the midst of the bitter.&#8212;So amidst the floods of sin,&#8212;keep ye the water of Baptism.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p24"></A>20.&#160; The woman of Samaria said to our Lord,&#8212;&#8220;Lo! verily the well is deep.&#8221;&#8212;Baptism <i>though it be</i> high,&#8212;in its mercy has stooped down with us:&#8212;for the atonement is from above&#8212;that has come down unto sinners.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p25"></A>21.&#160; &#8220;He that drinks the water that I shall give him,&#8212;verily never again shall he thirst.&#8221;&#8212;For this holy Baptism,&#8212;for it be ye athirst, my beloved;&#8212;never again shall ye be athirst,&#8212;so that ye should come to another baptism.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p26"></A>22.&#160; In the baptism of Siloam&#8212;the blind man washed, and his eyeballs&#8212;were opened and enlightened by the water;&#8212;he cast off the darkness that <i>was</i> on them.&#8212;The hidden darkness ye have cast off;&#8212;from the water ye have been clad in light.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p27"></A>23.&#160; His hands Pilate washed&#8212;that he might not be of them that slew.&#8212;Ye have bathed your bodies,&#8212;your hands together with your mouths.&#8212;Go in and be of them that eat,&#8212;for this medicine of life gives life to all.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p28"></A>24.&#160; &#8220;Come after Me and verily I will make you&#8212;fishers of men.&#8221;&#8212;For instead of a draught of that which perishes,&#8212;they fished for the draught that <i>is</i> forever.&#8212;They who had taken fishes for death,&#8212;baptized and gave life to them that were to die.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p29"></A>25.&#160; An hundred and fifty fishes were taken&#8212;by Simon&#146;s net from the water;&#8212;but there were taken by his preaching,&#8212;out of the bosom of Baptism,&#8212;ten thousands and thousands of men,&#8212;a draught of the sons of the Kingdom.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p30"></A>26.&#160; Lo! our priest as a fisher&#8212;over the scanty water is standing;&#8212;he has taken thence a great draught&#8212;of every shape and of every kind;&#8212;he has drawn up the draught to bring <i>it</i> near&#8212;to the King of kings, most high.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p31"></A>27.&#160; Simon took the fishes and drew them up,&#8212;and they were brought near before our Lord:&#8212;Our priest has taken from out of the water,&#8212;by the Hand which he received from Simon,&#8212;virgins and chaste men who are brought near&#8212;in the festival of the Lord of feasts.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.viii-p32"></A>28.&#160; In Thy mercy I adjure Thee pardon me,&#8212;for in mercy Thou too hast sworn,&#8212;Rabboni, &#8220;In the death of him that dieth,&#8212;I have no pleasure, but in his life.&#8221;&#8212;Thou hast sworn and I have adjured:&#8212;O Thou Who hast sworn, pardon him who has adjured!</p>
