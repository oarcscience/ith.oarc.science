<span id="iii.ii-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="iii.ii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ii-p3.1"></span>In</span> the following selection from the
voluminous writings of Ephraim, the great light of the Syrian Church of
the fourth century, I have endeavored to give adequate specimens of his
*Hymns* and of his *Homilies*; but have not included any part of his
*Commentaries* on Holy Scripture.  These last contain much that is
worthy of study, but would not be found attractive to the general
reader; nor could they be fairly represented by a series of extracts
such as the limits of the present volume would admit of.

<span id="iii.ii-p4"></span>The Hymns (with small exceptions, presently
to be specified), and the Homilies, which I have selected, appear now
for the first time in an English version; and are translated from Syriac
texts which have come to light within the last fifty years, in the great
collection of manuscripts acquired by the British Museum by the purchase
of the library of the monastery of the Theotokos in the Nitrian Desert,
in Egypt.

<span id="iii.ii-p5"></span>To these I have added eight chosen from the
twenty-three *Demonstrations*, or Epistles, of Ephraim’s contemporary
Aphrahat.  These also appear for the first time in English, and are
translated from a Syriac text, long lost, and lately recovered from the
same famous collection.

<span id="iii.ii-p6"></span>Of the Hymns of Ephraim, I have placed the
Nisibene series first, including forty-six of the total number
(originally seventy-seven; but a few are lost).  The first twenty-one,
relating to the history of Nisibis and of its Bishops, I have given in
full, because of their special interest and historic value.  The
translation of these is the work of the Rev. Joseph T. Sarsfield
Stopford, B.A. (Dublin), Rector of Castle Combe in the Diocese of
Gloucester.  It follows the text edited by Dr. Bickell (Leipzig, 1866),
from Nitrian <span class="sc"><span id="iii.ii-p6.1"></span>mss.</span>

<span id="iii.ii-p7"></span>Of the Hymns *On the Nativity*, which stand
next in order, the first thirteen have already appeared in the Oxford
“Library of the Fathers” (1847), translated by the Rev. J. B. Morris,
M.A., from the text printed in the great Roman edition, *S. Ephræmi Syri
Opera Syriaca* (Rome, 1743).  These were all of the series known when
that edition was published; but since then six complete hymns, and some
fragments of the same have been recovered from Nitrian <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.ii-p7.1"></span>mss.</span>  I have reprinted
Mr. Morris’s version of the thirteen, with some modifications, and have
subjoined the Nitrian six, rendered from the text published by Professor
Lamy, of Louvain, in Tom. II of his edition of Ephraim (Mechlin, 1889). 
These last, and the series of fifteen Hymns *For the Epiphany* which
follow them, have been translated by the Rev. Albert Edward Johnston,
B.D. (Dublin), formerly Assistant-Lecturer in Divinity in the University
of Dublin, and now Principal of the Church Missionary Society’s College,
Benares.  The remaining series, of seven Hymns *On the Faith*, also
called *The Pearl*, is borrowed, like the thirteen *On the Nativity*,
from Mr. Morris’s version.

<span id="iii.ii-p8"></span>I have carefully revised and in parts
rewritten all these translations of the *Hymns*, chiefly with a view to
bringing into some approach to uniformity the style and method of
rendering of a collection which thus includes the work of three
independent trans<span id="page_116">p. 116</span> <span
id="iii.ii-Page_116"></span>lators.  While very sensible of the high
merit of Mr. Morris’s work, and conscious that by retouching and
altering it I may incur the blame of presumptuousness, I have thought it
expedient to tone down somewhat of the exceeding severity of his
faithfulness to his original, and to remove some of the harsh
expressions and harsher inversions which make his version, valuable as
it is to the student, almost repulsive, and often barely intelligible,
to the English reader.  Of his learned Notes, I have retained a few,
some of them in a curtailed form, of those which seemed most useful for
the illustration of the text.

<span id="iii.ii-p9"></span>The three *Homilies* of Ephraim, which
follow the *Hymns*, have been translated by Mr. Johnston from Professor
Lamy’s text (as above, Tom. I., 1889).

<span id="iii.ii-p10"></span>The selections from the *Demonstrations* of
Aphrahat are the work of the same translator, and follow the text of Dom
Parisot’s edition, forming Tom. I of the *Patrologia Syriaca* (Paris,
1894).

<span id="iii.ii-p11"></span>The versions of the *Homilies* and of the
*Demonstrations*, being all the work of one and the same hand, have
called for but few and trivial alterations from the editor.  I have,
however, revised them throughout; and am responsible for the general
accuracy of the rendering of the originals in these, and in the whole of
the selections now presented to the public.

<span id="iii.ii-p12"></span>In the *Introductory Dissertation* prefixed
to the work, I have drawn largely on the materials supplied by the
*Prolegomena* of Dr. Bickell’s *Carmina Nisibena*, and of Professor
Lamy’s *S. Ephræmi Hymni et Sermones*, Tom. I. and Tom. II.; and by Dr.
Forget’s Treatise *De Vita Aphraatis*, and the Preface of Dom Parisot to
Tom. I. of the *Patrologia Syriaca*.
