<p class="c23"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p2.1"></A>Resp</span>.&#8212;<i>Blessed is He above all in His Birth!</i>&#160; (bis).</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p3"></A>1.&#160; Celebrate, O nations, this feast, first fruits of all feasts;&#8212;recount the sufferings that were, and the wounds and pains,&#8212;that we may know what plagues, He healed, the Son Who was sent.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p4"></A>R., Blessed be He Who sufficed to heal our pains!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p5"></A>2.&#160; Celebrate, O saved nations, Him Who saves all in His Birth.&#8212;Even my feeble tongue, has become a harp through <i>His</i> mercy.&#8212;The excellency of the Firstborn, in His Festival let us sing.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p6"></A>R., Blessed is He Who has made us meet for His Feast!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p7"></A>3.&#160; How then can any one, admire a physician,&#8212;until he hear and learn, what were the pains he healed?&#8212;And when our plagues are proclaimed, then is our Healer magnified.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p8"></A>R., Blessed be He Who is exalted in our pains!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p9"></A>4.&#160; Created things were worshipped:&#160; because the worshipper was foolish,&#8212;he used to worship all things; but One they worshipped not.&#8212;He came down therefore in mercy and broke, the yoke that enslaved all.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p10"></A>R., Blessed is He Who loosed our pains!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p11"></A>5.&#160; The mercies of the Highest were revealed; He came down and set free His creature.&#8212;In this blessed month, wherein are made releases of <i>slaves</i>,&#8212;the Lord underwent bondage, to call the bond to freedom.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p12"></A>R., Blessed is He Who brought freedom!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p13"></A>6.&#160; The Lord of the months chose Him, two months for His doings.&#8212;His Conception was in Nisan, and His Birth in Conun.&#8212;In Nisan He sanctified them that were con<A NAME="page_253"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 253</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.xvi-Page_253"></A>ceived; and them that were born He set free in Conun.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p14"></A>R., Blessed be He Who makes glad His months!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p15"></A>7.&#160; The Sun revealed in silence, his worshippers to his Lord:&#8212;it was grievous to him, a servant, to be worshipped instead of his Lord.&#8212;Lo! creation is glad, that the Creator is worshipped.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p16"></A>R., Blessed is the Child that is worshipped.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p17"></A>8.&#160; The months wore three <i>crowns</i>, and crowned Him in His triumphs.&#8212;Blessed <i>is</i> the Sun for His Birth, and for His Resurrection desired,&#8212;and for His Ascension blessed; the months have borne Him crowns.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p18"></A>R., Blessed be He Who has triumphed in His months!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p19"></A>9.&#160; Unveil and make glad thy face, O Creature, in our feast.&#8212;Let the Church sing with voice; Heaven and earth in silence!&#8212;Sing and praise the Child, who has brought release for all!</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p20"></A>R., Blessed be He Who has annulled the bonds!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p21"></A>10.&#160; When fools did reverence to the Sun, in reverence to him they disgraced him.&#8212;But now when all know he is a servant, in his course his Lord is worshipped;&#8212;all servants rejoice, that as servants they are reckoned.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p22"></A>R., Blessed be He Who ordered their natures!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p23"></A>11.&#160; We have done perverse things, who have become servants of servants.&#8212;Lo! our freedom compelled him, a servant, to become lord to us:&#8212;the Sun, the servant for all, we have made Lord for all.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p24"></A>R., Blessed is He Who to Himself has turned us!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p25"></A>12.&#160; And the Moon too which was worshipped, has been set free by His Birth.&#8212;For &#146;tis strange that by her light, which enlightens the eyes,&#8212;by it the eyes were darkened, that they gazed on her as a God.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p26"></A>R., Blessed be the beam that has enlightened us!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p27"></A>13.&#160; Fire commended Thy Birth, which drew away worship from it.&#8212;The magi used to worship it:&#160; they who have worshipped before Thee.&#8212;They left it and worshipped its Lord; they exchanged fire for the Fire.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p28"></A>R., Blessed is He Who has bathed us in His light!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p29"></A>14. In place of the senseless fire that eats up its own body of itself,&#8212;the magi adored the Fire Who gave His Body to be eaten.&#8212;The live coal drew near and sanctified, the lips that were unclean.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p30"></A>R., Blessed is He Who has mixed His Fire in us!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p31"></A>15.&#160; Delusion blinded men, to worship created things:&#8212;fellow servants were worshipped, and the God of all was wronged.&#8212;He Who is to be worshipped came down <i>to His</i> birth, and gathered to himself worship.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p32"></A>R., Blessed is He Who by all is worshipped!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p33"></A>16.&#160; The All-knowing saw, that <i>men</i> worship things that were made:&#8212;He put on a body that was made, that in our custom He might take us captive,&#8212;and by a body that was made, drew us to the Creator.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p34"></A>R., Blessed be He Who drew us with guile!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p35"></A>17.&#160; The Evil One knew how to harm us; and by lights he blinded us,&#8212;by possessions he hurt us, through gold he made us poor,&#8212;by the graver&#146;s graven images, he made us a heart of stone.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p36"></A>R., Blessed is He Who came and softened it!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p37"></A>18.&#160; They graved and set up stones, whereon men should stumble.&#8212;They set them not on the highway, for the blind to stumble on:&#8212;they called them Gods, that on them <i>with</i> open <i>eyes</i> men might stumble.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p38"></A>R., Blessed is He Who exposed the idols which they feared!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p39"></A>19.&#160; Sin had spread its wings, and covered all things,&#8212;that none could discern, of himself or from above, the truth.&#8212;Truth came down into the womb, came forth and rolled away error.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p40"></A>R., Blessed is He Who dispelled Sin by His Birth!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p41"></A>20.&#160; For Mercy endured not, to see the way hindered.&#8212;When He came down for conception, He opened the way <i>and made it</i> easy:&#8212;when He came forth in birth, He trod it and marked its miles.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p42"></A>R., Blessed is the peace of Thy Way!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p43"></A><A NAME="page_254"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 254</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.xvi-Page_254"></A>21.&#160; He chose the Prophets; they cleared the way for the people:&#8212;He sent the Apostles; they smoothed paths for the nations.&#8212;The snares of the Evil One were shamed, when feeble men cleared them away.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p44"></A>R., Blessed is He Who made our paths plain!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p45"></A>22.&#160; The graven images blinded, their gravers in secret:&#8212;they graved eyes on stone, and darkened the eyes of the soul.&#8212;Praise to Thy Birth that opened, the sight that was blinded.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p46"></A>R., Blessed be He Who has restored sight!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p47"></A>23.&#160; Let women praise Her, the pure Mary,&#8212;that <i>as</i> in Eve their mother,&#8212;great was their reproach,&#8212;lo! in Mary their sister,&#8212;greatly magnified was their honour.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p48"></A>R., Blessed is He Who sprang from women!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p49"></A>24.&#160; Let the nations praise Thy Birth, that they have gained eyes to see,&#8212;how their wine has made them reel; and they have seen their own humiliation?&#8212;They come to know themselves, and worship Him who has rescued them.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p50"></A>R., Blessed is He Who has taught repentance!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p51"></A>25.&#160; Its worship mankind&#8212;had spread everywhere:&#8212;Him Who is <i>to be</i> worshipped it sought not, that worship should be paid Him.&#8212;But He endured not&#8212;worshippers that err.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p52"></A>R., Blessed is He Who came down and is worshipped!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p53"></A>26.&#160; The gold of the idols worshipped Thee, that Thou didst treat it as alms; which availed not apart, for the uses of life.&#8212;It hasted to Thy purse, as it had hasted to the manger.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p54"></A>R., Blessed be He Whom Creation has loved!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p55"></A>27.&#160; The frankincense worshipped Thy Birth, which had served demons.&#8212;It sorrowed <i>then</i> in its vapour:&#160; it exulted when it saw its Lord.&#8212;Instead of <i>being</i> the incense of delusion, it was an oblation before God!</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p56"></A>R., Blessed is Thy Birth which is worshipped!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p57"></A>28.&#160; The myrrh worshipped Thee for itself, and for its kindred ointments.&#8212;The hands that bore its ointment, had anointed abominable graven images.&#8212;To Thee the perfume was sweet, from the anointing wherewith Mary anointed Thee.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p58"></A>R., Blessed is Thy savour which is sweet to us!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p59"></A>29.&#160; The gold that had been worshipped worshipped thee, when the magi offered it.&#8212;That which had been worshipped in molten images, gave worship to Thee.&#8212;With its worshippers it worshipped Thee, it confessed that Thou art He that is to be worshipped.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p60"></A>R., Blessed is He Who claimed worship for Himself!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p61"></A>30.&#160; The Evil One fled and his hosts, he that used to exult in the world.&#8212;In the high places they sacrificed heifers to him, in the gardens they slew bulls for him.&#8212;He swallowed up all creation, he filled his belly with prey.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p62"></A>R., Blessed be He Who came and made him disgorge!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p63"></A>31.&#160; Of him the Lord said, that he had fallen from Heaven.&#8212;The Abhorred One had exalted himself; from his uplifting he has fallen. &#160;The foot of Mary has trod him down, who bruised Eve with his heel.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p64"></A>R., Blessed be He Who by His Birth laid him low!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p65"></A>32.&#160; Chaldeans went about, in all places and led astray:&#8212;the preachers of delusion, were shamed through the world,&#8212;they were shamed and overcome,&#8212;by the preachers of truth.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p66"></A>R., Blessed be the Babe Whom they preached!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p67"></A>33.&#160; Sin had spread out, her nets for the draught.&#8212;Praise <i>be</i> to Thy Birth that captured, the nets of delusion.&#8212;The soul took flight on high, which had been taken in the deep.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p68"></A>R., Blessed is He Who prepared for us wings!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p69"></A>34.&#160; His Will was able, even by force to rescue us.&#8212;<i>But</i> since <i>it was</i> not force that made us guilty, it was not by force He purged us.&#8212;The Evil One by enticement enslaved us:&#160; Thy Birth enticed to give us life.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p70"></A>R., Blessed be He Who planned and gave us life!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p71"></A><A NAME="page_255"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 255</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.xvi-Page_255"></A>35.&#160; The creatures complained that they were worshipped; in silence they sought release.&#8212;The All-Releaser heard, and because He endured it not He came down,&#8212;put on <i>the form of</i> a servant in the womb, came forth, set free Creation.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p72"></A>R., Blessed be He Who made his Creation his gain!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p73"></A>36.&#160; Mercy was kindled on high, at the voice of Creation that cried out:&#8212;Gabriel was sent; he came and gave tidings of Thy Conception.&#8212;When Thou camest to the Birth, Watchers gave tidings of thy coming forth.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p74"></A>R., Blessed be by Thy Worship above all!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p75"></A>37.&#160; For greater is the joy of the Birth than the Conception.&#8212;Yea it was one angel, that brought us tidings of Thy Conception:&#8212;<i>but</i> in the joy of Thy Birth, a multitude of Watchers brought tidings.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p76"></A>R., Blessed be Thy tidings in Thy day!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p77"></A>38.&#160; Glory to Thee I too in Thy day, will offer, O Thou that art worshipped!&#8212;Take of the fruit that is mine; and give me mercy which is Thine!&#8212;For if the evil that is in me gives gifts, how much more shalt Thou give Who art good!</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p78"></A>R., Blessed is Thy wealth in Thy servant!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p79"></A>39.&#160; The two things Thou soughtest, in Thy Birth have been done for us.&#8212;Our visible body Thou hast put on; Thy invisible might we have put on:&#8212;our body has become Thy clothing; Thy Spirit has become our robe.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p80"></A>R., Blessed be He Who has been adorned and has adorned us!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p81"></A>40.&#160; Height and depth were amazed, that Thy Birth subdued the rebels.&#8212;For that we gave Thee hostages, Thou gavest us the Paraclete:&#8212;when the hostages went up from us, the Captain of the host came down to us.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvi-p82"></A>R., Blessed be He Who took away and sent down!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p83"></A>41.&#160; Come ye mouths of all and pour forth, and be in the likeness of waters, and wells of voices!&#160; May the Holy Spirit come,&#8212;and sing glory through us all, to the Father Who has redeemed us through His Son!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xvi-p84"></A><i>R., Blessed is He above all in His Birth!</i></p>
