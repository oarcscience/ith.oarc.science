<span id="iii.ix.viii-p1"></span> *<span class="c1"><span
id="iii.ix.viii-p1.1"></span>Demonstration XVII.</span>*<span
class="c1"><span id="iii.ix.viii-p1.2"></span>—<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ix.viii-p1.3"></span>Of</span> <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ix.viii-p1.4"></span>Christ the Son of God</span>.</span>

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p2"></span>1.  (This is) a reply against the Jews,
who blaspheme the people gathered from among the Gentiles; for they say
thus, “Ye worship and serve a man who was begotten, a son of man who was
crucified, and ye call a son of men, God.  And though God has no son, ye
say concerning this crucified Jesus, that He is the Son of God.”  And
they bring forward as an argument, that God said:—“*I am God and there
is none else beside Me.*” <span id="fr_1038"></span>[1039](#fn_1038.md)  
And again he said:—“*Thou shalt not worship another God.*” <span
id="fr_1039"></span>[1040](#fn_1039)   Therefore, (say they.md), ye are
opposing God in that ye call a man, God.

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p5"></span>2.  Concerning these things, my
beloved, so far as I, in my insignificance, can comprehend, I will
instruct thee about them, that while we grant to them that He is man,
and (while) we at the same time honour Him and call Him God and Lord,
yet it is not in any novel fashion, that we have so called Him, nor that
we have applied to Him a novel name, which they themselves did not
employ.  Yet it is a sure thing with us, that Jesus our Lord is God, the
Son of God, and the King, the King’s Son, Light of light, Creator and
Counsellor, and Guide, and the Way, and Redeemer, and Shepherd,
Gatherer, and the Door, and the Pearl, and the Lamp; and by many (such)
names is He surnamed.  But we shall leave aside all (the rest) of them,
and prove concerning Him, that He Who came from God is the Son of God,
and (is) God.

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p6"></span>3.  For the venerated name of Godhead
has been applied also to righteous men, and they have been held worthy
to be called by it.  And the men with whom God was well pleased, them He
called, My sons, and My friends.  When He chose Moses His friend and His
beloved and made him chief and teacher and priest unto his people he
called him God.  For He said to him:—*I have made thee a God unto
Pharaoh*. <span id="fr_1040"></span>[1041](#fn_1040.md)   And He gave him
His priest for a prophet, *And Aaron thy brother shall speak for thee
unto Pharaoh, and thou shalt be unto him as a God, and he shall be unto
thee an interpreter*. <span id="fr_1041"></span>[1042](#fn_1041.md)   Thus
not alone to the evil Pharaoh did He make Moses God, but also unto
Aaron, the holy priest, He made Moses God.

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p9"></span>4.  Again, hear concerning the title
Son of God, by which we have called Him.  They say that “though God has
no son, ye make that crucified Jesus, the firstborn son of God.”  Yet He
called Israel “*My first-born,*” when He sent to Pharaoh through Moses
and said to him, *Israel is My first-born; I have said unto thee, let My
Son go to serve Me, and if thou art not willing to let (him) go, lo! I
will slay thy son, thy firstborn*. <span
id="fr_1042"></span>[1043](#fn_1042.md)   And also through the
Prophet <span id="fr_1043"></span>[1044](#fn_1043.md) He testified
concerning this, and reproved them and said to the people, *Out of Egypt
have I called My son.  As I called them, so they went and worshipped
Baal and offered incense to the graven images.*  And Isaiah said <span
id="fr_1044"></span>[1045](#fn_1044.md) concerning them, *Children have I
reared and brought up, and they have rebelled against Me.*  And again it
is written, *Ye are the children of the Lord your God*. <span
id="fr_1045"></span>[1046](#fn_1045.md)   And about Solomon He said, *He
shall be to Me a son, and I will be to him a Father*. <span
id="fr_1046"></span>[1047](#fn_1046.md)   So also we call the Christ, the
Son of God, for through Him we have gained the knowledge of God; even as
He called Israel <span id="page_388">p. 388</span> <span
id="iii.ix.viii-Page_388"></span>*My firstborn son,* and as He said
concerning Solomon, *He shall be to Me a son*.  And we call Him God,
even as He surnamed Moses by His own Name.  And also David said
concerning them:—*Ye are Gods and children of the Highest, all of
you*. <span id="fr_1047"></span>[1048](#fn_1047.md)   And when they amended
not themselves, therefore He said concerning them:—*As men shall ye die,
and as one of the princes shall ye fall.* <span
id="fr_1048"></span>[1049](#fn_1048.md)

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p17"></span>5.  For the name of Divinity is given
for the highest honour in the world, and with whomsoever God is well
pleased, He applies it to him.  But however, the names of God are many
and are venerable, as He delivered His names to Moses, saying to him:—*I
am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and
the God of Jacob.  This is My Name for ever, and this is My memorial
unto generations*. <span id="fr_1049"></span>[1050](#fn_1049.md)   And He
called His name *Ahiyah ashar Ahiyah, El Shaddai and Adonai
Sabaoth*. <span id="fr_1050"></span>[1051](#fn_1050.md)   By these names is
God called.  The great and honourable name of *Godhead* He withheld not
from His righteous ones; even as, though He is the great King, without
grudging He applied the great and honourable name of Kingship to men who
are His creatures.

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p20"></span>6.  For by the mouth of His prophet
God called the heathen King Nebuchadnezzar, *King of Kings.*  For
Jeremiah said:—*Every people and kingdom that shall not put his neck
into the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar, King of Kings, My servant, with famine
and with sword and with pestilence will I visit that people*. <span
id="fr_1051"></span>[1052](#fn_1051.md)   Though He is the great King, He
grudges not the name of Kingship to men.  And (so), though He is the
great God, yet He grudged not the name of Godhead to the sons of flesh. 
And though all fatherhood is His, He has called men also fathers.  For
He said to the congregation:—*Instead of thy fathers, shall be thy
children*. <span id="fr_1052"></span>[1053](#fn_1052.md)   And though
authority is His, He has given men authority one over another.  And
while worship is His unto honour, He has yet allowed it in the world,
that one man should honour another.  For even though a man should do
worship <span id="fr_1053"></span>[1054](#fn_1053.md) before the wicked and
the heathen and *them that refuse grace*, yet is he not censured by
God.  And concerning worship He commanded His people, *Thou shalt not
worship the sun or the moon or all the hosts of heaven; and also ye
shall not desire to worship any creature that is upon the earth*. <span
id="fr_1054"></span>[1055](#fn_1054.md)   Behold the grace and the love of
our good Maker, that He did not grudge to men the name of Godhead and
the name of worship, and the name of Kingship, and the name of
authority; because He is the Father of the created things that are over
the face of the world, and He has honoured and exalted and glorified men
above all creatures.  For with His holy hands He fashioned them; and of
His Spirit He breathed into them, and a dwelling-place did He become
unto them from of old. <span id="fr_1055"></span>[1056](#fn_1055.md)   In
them doth He abide and amongst them doth He walk.  For He said through
the prophet, *I will dwell in them, and walk in them*. <span
id="fr_1056"></span>[1057](#fn_1056.md)   Furthermore also the Prophet
Jeremiah said:—*Ye are the temple of the Lord, if ye make fair your ways
and your deeds*. <span id="fr_1057"></span>[1058](#fn_1057.md)   And of old
David said:—*Thou, Lord, hast been a dwelling-place unto us for
generations; before the mountains were conceived and before the earth
travailed, and before the world was framed; from age to age Thou art
God.* <span id="fr_1058"></span>[1059](#fn_1058.md)

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p29"></span>7.  How dost thou understand this? 
For one prophet says:—*Lord, Thou hast been our dwelling-place.*  And
another said:—*I will dwell in them and walk in them.*  First, He became
to us a dwelling-place, and afterwards He dwelt and walked in us.  For
the wise both things are true and simple.  For David says:—*Thou, Lord,
hast been our dwelling-place for generations, before the mountains were
conceived and before the earth travailed, and before the world was
framed.*  And thou knowest, my beloved, that all cre<span
id="page_389">p. 389</span> <span id="iii.ix.viii-Page_389"></span>ated
things that are above and that are beneath were created first, and after
them all, man.  For when God determined to create the world with all its
goodly things, first He conceived and fashioned man in His mind; and
after that Adam was conceived in His thought, then He conceived the
created things; as he said:—*Before the mountains were conceived and the
earth travailed;* because man is older and more ancient in conception
than the creatures, but in birth the creatures are older and more
ancient than Adam.  Adam was conceived and dwelt in the thought of God;
and while in conception he (man) was held in His (God’s) mind, He (God)
by the word of His mouth created all the creatures.  And when He had
finished and adorned the world, when nothing was lacking in it, then He
brought forth Adam from His thoughts, and fashioned man by His hands;
and Adam saw the world completed.  And He (God) gave him authority over
all that He had made, just as a man who has a son and desires to make
for him a marriage feast, betroths to him a wife and builds for him a
house, and prepares and adorns all that is needed for his son; then he
makes the marriage feast and gives his son authority over his house.  So
after the conception of Adam, He brought him forth and gave him
authority over all his creation.  Concerning this the Prophet
said:—*Thou, Lord, hast been our habitation for generations, before the
mountains were conceived, and before the earth travailed and before the
world was framed.  From age unto age Thou art the Lord.*  That no one
should suppose that there is another God, either before or afterwards,
he said:—*From age and unto age,* just as Isaiah said:—*I am the first
and I am the last*. <span id="fr_1059"></span>[1060](#fn_1059.md)   And
after that God brought forth Adam from within His thought, He fashioned
him, and breathed into him of His Spirit, and gave him the knowledge of
discernment, that he might discern good from evil, and might know that
God made him.  And inasmuch as man knew his Maker, God was formed and
conceived within his thought, and he became a temple for God his Maker,
as it is written, *Ye are the temple of God.*  And (so) He Himself
said:—*I will dwell in them and walk in them.*  But as for the sons of
Adam, who do not recognise their Maker, He is not formed within them,
and does not dwell in them, and is not conceived in their thought; but
they are accounted before Him as the beasts, and as the rest of the
creatures.

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p31"></span>8.  Now by these things the stubborn
will be convinced, that it is nothing strange that we call Christ the
Son of God.  For behold, He (God) conceived all men and brought them
forth from His thoughts.  And they will be forced to own that the name
of Godhead also belongs to Him (Christ), for He (God) associated the
righteous also in the name of God.  And as to this, that we worship
Jesus through Whom we have known God, let them be ashamed, inasmuch as
they fall down and worship and honour even the heathen of the unclean
Gentiles, if they possess authority; and (for this) there is no blame. 
And this honour of worship God has given to the sons of Adam, that by it
they might honour one another—especially those who excel and are worthy
of honour amongst them.  For if they worship, and honour with the name
of worship, the heathen—those who in their heathen wickedness deny even
the name of God—and yet do not worship them as their maker, as though
they worshipped them alone, and so do not sin; how much more does it
become us to worship and honour Jesus, Who converted our stubborn minds
from all worship of vain error, and taught us to worship and serve and
minister to the one God, our Father and our Maker.  And (taught us) to
know that the kings of the world call themselves Gods by the name of the
great God, and are infidels and force men to infidelity, and men fall
down and worship before them and serve and honour them, like carven
images and idols, yet the law never censured these, and there is no
sin.  As Daniel also used to do worship to Nebuchadnezzar, <span
id="page_390">p. 390</span> <span id="iii.ix.viii-Page_390"></span>King
of Babylon, the infidel and compeller to infidelity, and was not
censured.  Joseph also gave worship to Pharaoh, and it is not written
that it was a sin for him.  But as for us, we are certain that Jesus is
God, the Son of God, and through Him we know His Father, and (have) all
of us (turned away) from all other worship.  Therefore it is impossible
for us to repay Him Who bore these things for us.  But by worship let us
pay Him honour in return for His affliction that was on our behalf.

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p32"></span>9.  Furthermore, we must prove that
this Jesus was beforehand promised from ancient times in the Prophets,
and was called the Son of God.  David said:—*Thou art My Son; today have
I begotten Thee*. <span id="fr_1060"></span>[1061](#fn_1060.md)   Again he
said:—*In the glories of holiness, from the womb, from of old, have I
begotten thee, a child*. <span id="fr_1061"></span>[1062](#fn_1061.md)  
And Isaiah said:—*Unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given, and
His government was upon His shoulder, and His Name shall be called
Wonderful, and Counsellor, and mighty God of the ages, and Prince of
peace.  And to the increase of His government and to His peace there is
no end*. <span id="fr_1062"></span>[1063](#fn_1062.md)   Therefore tell me,
O wise doctor of Israel, who is He that was born and whose name was
called *Child* and *Son* and *Wonderful* and *Counsellor*, the *mighty
God of the ages*, and *Prince of peace, to the increase of* whose
government and to whose *peace* (he said), *there is no end?*  For if we
call Christ the Son of God, David taught us (this); and that we call Him
God, this we learned from Isaiah.  *And His government was laid upon His
shoulder;* for He bare His cross, and went out from Jerusalem.  And that
He was *born as a child*, Isaiah again said:—*Lo, the virgin shall
conceive and bear; and His name shall be called Immanuel, which is, our
God with us.* <span id="fr_1063"></span>[1064](#fn_1063.md)

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p37"></span>10.  And if thou shouldest say that
Christ has not yet come, I will grant this also to thy contentiousness. 
For it is written that when He shall come, *the Gentiles shall expect
Him*. <span id="fr_1064"></span>[1065](#fn_1064.md)   Lo! I, one of the
Gentiles, have heard that Christ is to come.  And when as yet He had not
come, I beforehand have believed on Him; and through Him I worship the
God of Israel.  When He comes, will He then blame me because before His
coming I beforehand believed on Him?  But, thou fool, the prophets
suffer thee not to say that Christ has not yet come; for Daniel confutes
thee, <span id="fr_1065"></span>[1066](#fn_1065.md) saying:—*After
sixty-two weeks shall Messiah come and shall be slain.  And in His
coming shall the Holy City be laid waste, and her end shall be with a
flood.  And until the accomplishment of the things that are determined,
shall she continue in desolation.*  Thou expectest and hopest that, at
the coming of Christ, Israel shall be gathered together from all
regions, and Jerusalem shall be built up and inhabited.  But Daniel
testifies that, when Christ comes and is slain, Jerusalem shall be
destroyed, and shall continue in desolation until the accomplishment of
the things which are determined, forever.  And concerning the suffering
of Christ, David said:—*They pierced my hands and my feet, and all my
bones cried out.  They gazed and looked upon me, and divided my garments
amongst them, and upon my vesture did they cast the lot*. <span
id="fr_1066"></span>[1067](#fn_1066.md)   And Isaiah said:—*Lo! My servant
shall be known and shall be revealed and shall be lifted up, so that
many shall be astonished at Him.  As for this man, His visage shall be
marred more than that of man, and His aspect more than that of the sons
of men*. <span id="fr_1067"></span>[1068](#fn_1067.md)   And he said:—*He
will purify many nations, and kings shall be amazed at Him*. <span
id="fr_1068"></span>[1069](#fn_1068.md)   And he said in that passage:—*He
came up as a little child before Him, and as a root from the dry
ground*. <span id="fr_1069"></span>[1070](#fn_1069.md)   And in the end of
the passage he said:—*He shall be slain for our sins; He shall be
humiliated for our iniquity; the chastisement of our peace is upon Him,
and by His bruises shall we be healed*. <span
id="fr_1070"></span>[1071](#fn_1070.md)   By what wounds were men healed? 
David was not slain; for he <span id="page_391">p. 391</span> <span
id="iii.ix.viii-Page_391"></span>died in a good old age, and was buried
in Bethlehem.  And if they should say that it is spoken of Saul, for
Saul was killed in the mountains of Gilboa in the battle with the
Philistines, and if they should say that they *pierced his hands and his
feet*, when they fastened up his body on the wall of Bethshan; yet it
does not fitly apply to Saul.  When the limbs of Saul were pierced, his
bones were not conscious of suffering, because he was dead.  It was
after Saul died, that they hanged his body and those of his sons on the
wall of Bethshan.  But when David said, *They pierced my hands and my
feet, and all my bones cried out*, he said in the next verse:—*O God,
abide for my help, and deliver my soul from the sword.* <span
id="fr_1071"></span>[1072](#fn_1071.md)   Now Christ was delivered from the
sword, and ascended from out of Sheol, and revived and rose the third
day, and so *God abode for His help.*  But Saul called upon the Lord and
He did not answer him; and he asked through the Prophets, but no answer
was given to him.  And he disguised himself and inquired by soothsayers,
and learned from thence.  He was worsted before the Philistines, and he
slew himself with his own sword, when he saw that the battle had
overcome him.  Moreover in this passage David said:—*I will declare Thy
name unto my brethren, and in the midst of the congregation will I
glorify Thee*. <span id="fr_1072"></span>[1073](#fn_1072.md)   How can
these things apply to Saul?  And again David said:—*Thou didst not give
Thy holy one to see corruption*. <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[1074](#fn_1073.md)   But all these things fitly apply
to Christ.  When He came to them, they did not receive Him; but wickedly
judged Him by false witness.  And He was hung upon the tree by His
hands, and they pierced His hands and His feet with the nails which they
fastened in him; and all His bones cried out.  And on that day a great
prodigy happened. namely, that the light became dark in the middle of
the day, as Zechariah prophesied, saying:—*The day shall be known unto
the Lord.  It shall not be daytime, and it shall not be night; and at
the evening time there shall be light*. <span
id="fr_1074"></span>[1075](#fn_1074.md)   Now what is the day that was
distinguished by the prodigy, that it was neither daytime nor night, and
that at the evening time there was light?  Evidently the day on which
they crucified Him, for in the midst of that day there came darkness,
and at the evening time there was light.  And again he said:—*That day
there shall be cold and frost*. <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[1076](#fn_1075.md) —As thou knowest, on that day on
which they crucified Him, it was cold, and they had made them a fire to
warm themselves when Simon came and stood with them.  And again he
said:—*The spear shall arise against the shepherd, and against the man,
My friend;* <span id="fr_1076"></span>[1077](#fn_1076.md) *and it shall
smite the shepherd, and the sheep of his flock shall be scattered; and I
will turn back My hand upon the pastor.* <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[1078](#fn_1077.md)   And furthermore David said
concerning His Passion:—*For My meat they gave gall, and for My thirst
did they give Me vinegar to drink.* <span
id="fr_1078"></span>[1079](#fn_1078.md) —Again he said in that
passage:—*They have persecuted Him Whom Thou hast smitten; and have
added to the affliction of Him that was slain.*  For they added many
(afflictions) to Him, much that was not written concerning Him, cursings
and revilings, such as the Scripture could not reveal, for their
revilings were hateful.  But, however, *the Lord was pleased to
humiliate Him and afflict Him.* <span
id="fr_1079"></span>[1080](#fn_1079.md)   *And He was slain for our
iniquity,* <span id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080.md) *and was
humiliated for our sins,* and *was made sin* in His own person. <span
id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081.md)

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p56"></span>11.  We worship those mercies, and bow
the knee before the Majesty of His Father, Who converted our worship to
Him.  We call Him God, just as Moses (was called God); and Firstborn,
and Son, just as Israel (was called); and Jesus (Joshua), just as Joshua
<span id="page_392">p. 392</span> <span
id="iii.ix.viii-Page_392"></span>the son of Nun was so called; and
Priest like Aaron, and King, like David; and great Prophet, like all the
Prophets; and Shepherd, like the shepherds who tended and guided
Israel.  And so did He call children as He said:—*Strange children shall
hearken unto Me.* <span id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082.md)   And He
has made us brothers unto Himself, He said:—*I will declare Thy name
unto My brethren.* <span id="fr_1083"></span>[1084](#fn_1083.md)   And we
have become friends unto Him, as He said to His disciples:—*I have
called you friends,* <span id="fr_1084"></span>[1085](#fn_1084.md) even as
His Father called Abraham *My friend*. <span
id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085.md)   And He said unto us:—*I am the
good Shepherd, the Door, the Way, the Vine, the Sower, the Bridegroom,
the Pearl, the Lamp, the Light, the King, God, Saviour, and Redeemer*. 
And by many names is He surnamed.

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p61"></span>12.  This brief argument have I
written unto thee, my beloved, that thou mayest make defence against the
Jews, concerning this that they say, that God has no son, and concerning
this that we call Him God, the Son of God, King, and Firstborn of all
creatures. <span id="fr_1086"></span>[1087](#fn_1086.md)
