id="ii.vii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Epistle LXII.</span>

<span id="ii.vii.xxviii-p2"></span>*To Brunichild, Queen of the
Franks* <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md) .

<span id="ii.vii.xxviii-p4"></span>Gregory to Brunichild, &c.

<span id="ii.vii.xxviii-p5"></span>We render thanks to Almighty God,
Who, among all the other gifts of His loving-kindness that He has
bestowed upon your Excellency, has so filled you with a love of the
Christian religion that whatever you know to pertain to the gain of
souls, whatever to the propagation of the faith, you cease not to carry
into effect with devout mind and pious zeal.  As to the great favour and
assistance wherewith your Excellence aided our most reverend brother and
fellow-bishop Augustine on his progress to the nation of the Angli, fame
had already not been silent; and afterwards certain monks, returning to
us from him, gave us a particular account thereof.

<span id="ii.vii.xxviii-p6"></span>And indeed, let others to whom your
benefactions are less known wonder at these evidences of your
Christianity; for to us who know them by experience they are not a
subject of wonder, but of rejoicing, because through what you bestow
upon others you delight yourself.  Now of what sort and how great are
the miracles which our Redeemer has wrought in the conversion of the
above-written nation is already known to your Excellency.  On which
account you ought to have great joy, since the succours afforded by you
claim to themselves the larger share herein, it having been through your
aid, after God, that the word of preaching became widely known in those
parts.  For one who aids the good work of another makes it his own. 
But, that the fruit of your reward may be richer more and more, we beg
of you kindly to afford the support of your patronage to the monks, the
bearers of these presents, whom we have sent with our most beloved sons,
the presbyter Laurentius and the abbot Mellitus, to our aforesaid most
reverend brother and fellow-bishop, because of his telling us that those
who are with him are not sufficient; and to vouchsafe to stand by them
in all things, to the end that, when by the good auspices of <span
id="page_74">p. 74</span> <span id="ii.vii.xxviii-Page_74"></span>your
Excellency they shall have had the better success, and shall have found
no delays or difficulties in your parts, you may call down the mercy of
our God towards you and your most sweet nephews in proportion as you
have demeaned yourselves compassionately for the love of Him in causes
of this kind.

the tenth day of the Kalends of July, Indiction 4.\]
