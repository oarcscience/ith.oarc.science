<span id="iii.v.x-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.v.x-p1.1"></span>Hymn IX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.x-p2.1"></span>Come</span> rest, and be still in the bosom of
Thy Mother, Son of the Glorious.  Forwardness fits not the sons of
kings.  O Son of David, Thou art glorious, and \[yet\] the Son of Mary,
who dost hide Thy beauty in the inner chamber.

<span id="iii.v.x-p3"></span>To whom art Thou like, glad Babe, fair
little One, Whose Mother is a Virgin, Whose Father is hidden, Whom even
the Seraphim are not able to look upon?  Tell us whom Thou art like, O
Son of the Gracious!

<span id="iii.v.x-p4"></span>When the wrathful came to see Thee, Thou
madest them gladsome:  they exchanged smiles one with another:  the
angry were made gentle in Thee, O sweet One.  Blessed art Thou, little
One, for that in Thee even the bitter are made sweet.

<span id="iii.v.x-p5"></span>Who ever saw a Babe that was gladsome when
in arms to those that came near him, lo! reached Himself unto them that
were far off?  Fair sight \[to see\] a Child, that takes thought for
every man that they may see him!

<span id="iii.v.x-p6"></span>He that hath care came and saw Thee, and
his care fled away.  He that had anxiety; at Thee forgat his anxiety;
the hungry by Thee forgat his victuals; and he that had an errand, by
Thee was errant and forgot his journey!

<span id="iii.v.x-p7"></span>O still Thyself, and let men go to their
works!  Thou art a son of the poor, learn from Thyself that all the poor
had to leave their work to come.  Thou who lovest men, hast bound men
together by Thy gladsomeness.

<span id="iii.v.x-p8"></span>David, that stately king, took
branches, <span id="fr_467"></span>[468](#fn_467.md) and in the feast
amongst the children as he danced, he gave praise.  Is it not the love
of David Thy father that is warm in Thee?

<span id="iii.v.x-p10"></span>That daughter of Saul! her father’s devil
spake in her:  she called the stately \[king\] a vile fellow, because he
gave an ensample to the elders of her people of taking up branches with
the children in the day of praise to Thee.

<span id="iii.v.x-p11"></span>Who would not fear to lay it to Thee that
Thou art forward?  For lo, the daughter of Saul who mocked the child,
cut off her womb from childbearing; because her mouth derided, the
reward of its mouth was barrenness. <span
id="fr_468"></span>[469](#fn_468.md)

<span id="iii.v.x-p13"></span><span id="page_244">p. 244</span> <span
id="iii.v.x-Page_244"></span>Let mouths tremble at blasphemy, lest they
be shut up!  Refrain, O daughter of Sion, thy mouth from Him, for He is
the Son of David, Who is gladsome before thee.  Be not unto Him as the
daughter of Saul, whose race is extinct.

<span id="iii.v.x-p14"></span>Because Elijah restrained the desire of
the body, he withheld rain from the adulterous; because he kept under
his body, he withheld dew from the whoremongers, who let their fountains
be loosely poured out.

<span id="iii.v.x-p15"></span>Because the hidden fire of the lust of the
body ruled not in him, to him the fire from on high was obedient.  And
since he subdued on the earth the lust of the flesh, he went up thither
where holiness dwells and is at peace.

<span id="iii.v.x-p16"></span>Elisha also who deadened his own body,
quickened the dead.  The resurrection of the dead was in the usual
course by a sanctification not in the usual course; He raised the child,
because he purified his soul like a weaned child.

<span id="iii.v.x-p17"></span>Moses, who divided and separated himself
from his wife, divided the sea before the harlot.  Zipporah though
daughter of a heathen priest kept sanctity:  with a calf the daughter of
Abraham <span id="fr_469"></span>[470](#fn_469.md) went a whoring.
