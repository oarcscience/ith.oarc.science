<span id="ii.v.xlviii"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.v.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Epistle CIX.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p2"></span>To Brunichild, Queen of the Franks.

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p3"></span>Gregory to Brunichild, &c.

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p4"></span>Now that your Excellency’s royal
solicitude is in all matters of government praiseworthy, you ought, for
the increase of your glory, to show yourself more watchful, and careful
not to allow those whom you rule with counsel outwardly to perish
inwardly among themselves.  So may you, through the fruit of your pious
solicitude, after occupying this topmost height of a temporal kingdom,
attain under God to kingdoms and joys that are eternal.  And this we
trust you will be able after the following manner to succeed in; if,
among other good deeds, you pay attention to the ordination of
priests <span id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69.md) ; whose office, as we have
learnt, has come in your parts to be such an object of ambition that
priests are ordained all at once from being laymen.  This is a very
serious matter.  For what can they effect, what good can they do the
people, who covet being made bishops, not for doing good, but for
distinction?  These, then, who have not yet learnt what they have to
teach—what do they effect, but that the unlawful advancement of a few
becomes the ruin of many, and that the observance of ecclesiastical
government is brought into confusion, seeing that no regular order is
observed?  For whoso comes to the control thereof inconsiderately and
hurriedly, with what admonition can he edify those who are put under
him, his example having taught them, not reason, but error?  It is a
shame in truth, it is a shame, for one to command others what he knows
not how to observe himself.

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p6"></span>Nor do we pass over that other thing
which in like manner requires amendment, but detest it as utterly
execrable and a most serious matter; that in your parts sacred orders
are conferred through simoniacal heresy, which was the first to arise
against the Church, and was condemned with a rigorous malediction. 
<span id="page_29">p. 29</span> <span
id="ii.v.xlviii-Page_29"></span>Hence, therefore, it is brought about
that the dignity of the priesthood comes into contempt, and holy honour
under condemnation.  And so reverence perishes, discipline is destroyed,
since he who ought to have corrected faults committed them; and by
nefarious ambition the honourable priesthood is brought under censure
and disparagement.  For who will any more venerate what is sold, or not
think worthless what is bought?  Hence I am greatly distressed, and
condole with that land; since, while they scorn to have as a divine
gift, but compass by bribes, the Holy Spirit which Almighty God deigns
to bestow on men through the imposition of hands, I do not think that
the priesthood can long subsist there.  For where the gifts of heavenly
grace are sold, the life is not sought for God’s service, but rather
money is venerated in opposition to God.  Seeing then that so great a
wickedness is not only a danger to them, but also in no small degree
injurious to your kingdom, greeting your Excellency with fatherly
affection we beseech you to make God propitious to you by the correction
of this enormity.  And, that there may be henceforth no opportunity of
committing it, let a synod be held by your order, at which, in the
presence of our most beloved son, the abbot Cyriacus <span
id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md) , it shall be interdicted strictly under
pain of anathema that any one should dare to pass suddenly from a lay
condition to the degree of the Episcopate, or any one whatever dare to
give or receive anything for ecclesiastical orders; that so our Lord and
Redeemer may so deal with the things that are yours as He shall see you
to be solicitous with pious devotion in the things that are His.  But we
have taken special care to delegate the charge and management of this
synod, which we have decided should be held, to our brother and
fellow-bishop Syagrius, whom we know to be peculiarly your own; and we
beg you to deign both to lend a willing ear to his supplication, and to
support him by your aid; to the end that what may redound to your
reward, namely a pious and God-pleasing ordination of priests, the
contagion of this evil being removed, may take effect within all the
limits of your jurisdiction.

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p8"></span>To this our brother, in that he has
shewn himself exceedingly devoted with regard to the mission which has
been sent, under God, to the nation of the Angli, we have sent a pallium
to be used in the solemnities of mass, so that, having given aid in
things spiritual, he may find himself advanced by the favour of the
Prince of the apostles in the spiritual order itself.

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p9"></span>Furthermore, we have altogether
wondered why in your kingdom you allow Jews to possess Christian
slaves.  For what are all Christians but members of Christ?  And we all
know that you sincerely honour the Head of these members.  But let your
Excellency consider how inconsistent it is to honour the Head and to
allow the members to be trampled on by his enemies.  And so we beg that
your Excellency’s ordinance may remove the mischief of this iniquity
from your kingdom; so that you may prove yourself the more to be a
worthy worshipper of Almighty God, in that you set his faithful ones
free from His enemies.
