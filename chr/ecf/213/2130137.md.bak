<span id="ii.ix.vii-p5"></span> For the rest of this epistle see
preceding Epistle IX., with which, *mutatis mutandis,* it is identical,
as was Epistle VIII., save for an additional paragraph given under
Epistle VIII.  See what has been said with regard to that Epistle.  The
genuineness, or at any rate the freedom from interpolation, of all these
three Epistles is disputed.  The Benedictine Editors of Gregory’s works
defend their authenticity.  See their note (b) to Ep. VIII (*Patrologiæ
Tomus LXVII. Sancti Gregorii Magni tomus tertius*).  The purport of all
three letters is to confer privileges on, and provide for the future
security and regulation of, three recent foundations of Queen Brunechild
at Augustodunum (*Autun*); viz. 1.  A hospital, or guest-house
(*xenodochium*) in Autun, over which a Senator, described as “presbyter
and abbot,” had been appointed to preside; 2. A monastery for women, of
which Thalassia had been appointed Abbess; 3. The Church of St. Martin
in the suburbs, over which Lupo, “presbyter and abbot,” presided.  These
foundations are referred to, though not described, in Epistle VI. to
Brunechild herself, where Gregory speaks of having issued decrees for
their protection in the future, which he desires should be kept among
the royal archives.  In those times of continual conflict among the
Frank potentates royal founders might naturally wish to protect their
foundations from disturbance by means of spiritual fulminations; and the
queen’s desire in this respect might account for the anathemas in these
epistles, which have been said to be characteristic of a later age than
that of Gregory.  It may be observed further that the appointment of the
heads of these religious institutions is, in the letters before us,
reserved to “the kings of the province” instead of free election,
subject to episcopal approval, being left to the inmates, as was usual
in other cases.  This might be due, if the letters are genuine, to the
request of Brunechild, whom, as a staunch Catholic and a supporter of
the Church, Gregory ever shews himself anxious to conciliate.  With
regard to his politic flattery of her, or of others similarly situated,
cf. VI. 5, note 4.
