id="iii.v.iii-Page_227"></span><span class="c50"><span
id="iii.v.iii-p1.1"></span>Hymn II.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iii-p2.1"></span>Blessed</span> be that Child, Who gladdened
Bethlehem to-day!  Blessed be the Babe Who made manhood young again
to-day!  Blessed be the Fruit, Who lowered Himself to our famished
state!  Blessed be the Good One, Who suddenly enriched our
necessitousness and supplied our needs!  Blessed He Whose tender mercies
made Him condescend to visit our infirmities!

<span id="iii.v.iii-p3"></span>Praise to the Fountain that was
sent <span id="fr_384"></span>[385](#fn_384.md) for our propitiation. 
Praise be to Him Who made void the Sabbath by fulfilling it!  Praise too
to Him Who rebuked the leprosy and it remained not, Whom the fever saw
and fled!  Praise to the Merciful, Who bore our toil!  Glory to Thy
coming, which quickened the sons of men!

<span id="iii.v.iii-p5"></span>Glory to Him, Who came to us by His
first-born!  Glory to the Silence, <span
id="fr_385"></span>[386](#fn_385.md) that spake by His Voice.  Glory to the
One on high, Who was seen by His Day-spring!  Glory to the Spiritual,
Who was pleased to have a Body, that in it His virtue might be felt, and
He might by that Body show mercy on His household’s bodies!

<span id="iii.v.iii-p7"></span>Glory to that Hidden One, Whose Son was
made manifest!  Glory to that Living One, Whose Son was made to die! 
Glory to that Great One, Whose Son descended and was small!  Glory to
the Power Who did straiten His greatness by a form, His unseen nature by
a shape!  With eye and mind we have beheld Him, yea with both of them.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p8"></span>Glory to that Hidden One, Who even with
the mind cannot be felt at all by them that pry into Him; but by His
graciousness was felt by the hand of man!  The Nature that could not be
touched, by His hands was bound and tied, by His feet was pierced and
lifted up.  Himself of His own will He embodied for them that took Him.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p9"></span>Blessed be He Whom free will crucified,
because He let it:  blessed be He Whom the wood also did bear, because
He allowed it.  Blessed be He Whom the grave bound, that had \[thereby\]
a limit set it.  Blessed be He Whose own will brought Him to the Womb
and Birth, to arms and to increase \[in stature\].  Blessed He whose
changes purchased life for human nature. <span
id="fr_386"></span>[387](#fn_386.md)

<span id="iii.v.iii-p11"></span>Blessed He Who sealed our soul, and
adorned it and espoused it to Himself.  Blessed He Who made our Body a
tabernacle for His unseen Nature.  Blessed He Who by our tongue
interpreted His secret things.  Let us praise that Voice whose glory is
hymned with our lute, and His virtue with our harp.  The Gentiles have
assembled and have come to hear His strains.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p12"></span>Glory to the Son of the Good One, Whom
the sons of the evil one rejected!  Glory to the Son of the Just One,
Whom the sons of wickedness crucified!  Glory to Him Who loosed us, and
was bound for us all!  Glory to Him Who gave the pledge, and redeemed it
too!  Glory to the Beautiful, Who conformed us to His image!  Glory to
that Fair One, Who looked not to our foulnesses!

<span id="iii.v.iii-p13"></span>Glory to Him Who sowed His Light in the
darkness, <span id="fr_387"></span>[388](#fn_387.md) and was reproached in
His hidden state, and covered His secret things.  He also stripped and
took off from us the clothing of our filthiness. <span
id="fr_388"></span>[389](#fn_388.md)   Glory be to Him on high, Who mixed
His salt <span id="fr_389"></span>[390](#fn_389.md) in our minds, His
leaven in our souls.  His Body became Bread, to quicken our deadness.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p17"></span><span id="page_228">p. 228</span> <span
id="iii.v.iii-Page_228"></span>Praise to the Rich, Who paid for us all,
that which He borrowed not; <span id="fr_390"></span>[391](#fn_390.md) and
wrote \[His bill\], and also became our debtor!  By His yoke He brake
from us the chains of him that led us captive.  Glory to the Judge Who
was judged, and made His Twelve to sit in judgment on the tribes, and by
ignorant men condemned the scribes of that nation!

<span id="iii.v.iii-p19"></span>Glory to Him Who could never be measured
by us!  Our heart is too small for Him, yea our mind is too feeble.  He
makes foolish our littleness by the riches of His Wisdom.  Glory to Him,
Who lowered Himself, and asked; <span id="fr_391"></span>[392](#fn_391.md)
that He might hear and learn that which He knew; that He might by His
questions reveal the treasure of His helpful graces!

<span id="iii.v.iii-p21"></span>Let us adore Him Who enlightened with
His doctrine our mind, and in our hearing sought a pathway for His
words.  Praise we Him Who grafted into our tree His fruit.  Thanks to
Him Who sent His Heir, that by Him He might draw us to Himself, yea make
us heirs with Him!  Thanks to that Good One, the cause of all goods!

<span id="iii.v.iii-p22"></span>Blessed He Who did not chide, because
that He was good!  Blessed He Who did not spurn, because that He was
just also!  Blessed He Who was silent, and rebuked; that He might
quicken us with both!  Severe His silence and reproachful.  Mild His
severity even When He was accusing; for He rebuked the traitor, and
kissed the thief.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p23"></span>Glory to the hidden Husbandman of our
intellects!  His seed fell on to our ground, and made our mind rich. 
His increase came an hundredfold into the treasury of our souls!  Let us
adore Him Who sat down and took rest; and walked in the way, so that the
Way was in the way, and the Door also for them that go in, <span
id="fr_392"></span>[393](#fn_392.md) by which they go in to the kingdom.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p25"></span>Blessed the Shepherd Who became a Lamb
for our reconcilement!  Blessed the Branch Who became the Cup of our
Redemption!  Blessed also be the Cluster, Fount of medicine of life! 
Blessed also be the Tiller, Who became Wheat, that He might be sown; and
a Sheaf, <span id="fr_393"></span>[394](#fn_393.md) that He might be cut! 
\[Blessed be\] the Architect Who became a Tower for our place of
safety! <span id="fr_394"></span>[395](#fn_394.md)   Blessed He Who so
tempered the feelings of our mind, <span
id="fr_395"></span>[396](#fn_395.md) that we with our harp should sing that
which the winged creatures’ mouth knows not with its strains to sing! 
Glory to Him, Who beheld how we had pleased to be like to brutes in our
rage and our greediness; and came down and was one of us, that we might
become heavenly!

<span id="iii.v.iii-p29"></span>Glory be to Him, Who never felt the need
of our praising Him; yet felt the need as being kind to us, and
thirsted <span id="fr_396"></span>[397](#fn_396.md) as loving us, and asks
us to give to Him, and longs to give to us.  His fruit was mingled with
us men, that in Him we might come nigh to Him, Who condescended to us. 
By the Fruit of His stem He grafted us into His Tree.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p31"></span>Let us praise Him, Who prevailed and
quickened us by His stripes!  Praise we Him, Who took away the curse by
His thorns!  Praise we Him Who put death to death by His dying!  Praise
we Him, Who held His peace and justified us!  Praise we Him, Who rebuked
death that had overcome us!  Blessed He, Whose helpful graces cleansed
out the left side! <span id="fr_397"></span>[398](#fn_397.md)

<span id="iii.v.iii-p33"></span>Praise we Him Who watched and put to
sleep him that led us captive.  Praise we Him Who went to sleep, and
chased our deep sleep away.  Glory be to God Who cured weak manhood! 
Glory be to Him Who was baptized, and drowned our iniquity <span
id="page_229">p. 229</span> <span id="iii.v.iii-Page_229"></span>in the
deep, and choked him <span id="fr_398"></span>[399](#fn_398.md) that choked
us!  Let us glorify with all our mouths the Lord of all creatures!

<span id="iii.v.iii-p35"></span>Blessed be the Physician Who came down
and amputated without pain, and healed wounds with a medicine that was
not harsh.  His Son became a Medicine, that showed sinners mercy. 
Blessed be He Who dwelt in the womb, and wrought therein a perfect
Temple, that He might dwell in it, a Throne that He might be in it, a
Garment that He might be arrayed in it, and a Weapon that He might
conquer in it.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p36"></span>Blessed be He Whom our mouth cannot
adequately praise, because His Gift is too great for skill of orators
\[to tell\]; neither can the faculties adequately praise His goodness. 
For praise Him as we may, it is too little.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p37"></span>And since it is useless to be silent and
to constrain ourselves, may our feebleness excuse such praise as we can
sing.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p38"></span>How gracious He, Who demands not more
than our strength can give!  How would Thy servant be condemned in
capital and interest, did he not give such as he could, and did he
refuse that which He owed!  Ocean of glory Who needest not to have Thy
glory sung, take in Thy goodness this drop of praise; since by Thy Gift
Thou hast supplied my tongue a sense for glorifying Thee.

id="iii.v.iii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iii-p4"></span> There is perhaps an allusion here to the
pool of Siloam, which comes from the root employed in the original.

<span id="fn_385"></span>[227:386](2130228.htm#fr_385.md) <span
id="iii.v.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iii-p6"></span> This name is given by St. E. to the
Father, to suggest to the mind that there was a period when the Father
had not begun to work by His Word.

<span id="fn_386"></span>[227:387](2130228.htm#fr_386.md) <span
id="iii.v.iii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iii-p10"></span> St. E. seems to mean, that whereas the
alterations man undergoes in his body tend ultimately to decay the same
when undergone by our Lord tended to life.
