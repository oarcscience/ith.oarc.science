<span id="iii.v.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.v.xii-p1.1"></span>Hymn XI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.xii-p2"></span>(<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.xii-p2.1"></span>The Virgin Mother to Her Child</span>.)

<span id="iii.v.xii-p3"></span>I <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.xii-p3.1"></span>shall</span> not be jealous, my Son, that
Thou art with me, and also with all men.  Be Thou God to him that
confesses Thee, and be thou Lord to him that serves Thee, and be Brother
to him that loves Thee, that Thou mayest gain all!

<span id="iii.v.xii-p4"></span>When Thou didst dwell in me, Thou didst
also dwell out of me, and when I brought Thee forth openly, Thy hidden
might was not removed from me.  Thou art within me, and Thou art without
me, O Thou that makest Thy Mother amazed.

<span id="iii.v.xii-p5"></span>For \[when\] I see that outward form of
Thine before mine eyes, the hidden Form is shadowed forth “in my mind,”
O holy One.  In Thy visible form I see Adam, and in Thy hidden form I
see Thy Father, who is joined with Thee.

<span id="iii.v.xii-p6"></span>Hast Thou then shown me alone Thy Beauty
in two Forms?  Let Bread shadow forth Thee, and also the mind; dwell
also in Bread and in the eaters thereof.  In secret, and openly too, may
Thy Church see Thee, as well as Thy Mother.

<span id="iii.v.xii-p7"></span>He that hates Thy Bread is like unto him
that hates Thy Body.  He that is far off that desires Thy Bread, and he
that is near that loves Thy Image, are alike.  In the Bread and in the
Body, the first and also the last have seen Thee.

<span id="iii.v.xii-p8"></span>Yet Thy visible Bread is far more
precious than Thy Body; for Thy Body even unbelievers have seen, but
they have not seen Thy living Bread.  They that were far off rejoiced!
their portion utterly scorns that of those that are near.

<span id="iii.v.xii-p9"></span>Lo! Thy Image is shadowed forth in the
blood of the grapes <span id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476.md) on the
Bread; and it is shadowed forth on the heart with the finger of love,
with the colors of faith.  Blessed be He that by the Image of His Truth
caused the graven images to pass away.

<span id="iii.v.xii-p11"></span>Thou art not \[so\] the Son of Man that
I should sing unto Thee a common lullaby; for Thy Conception is new, and
Thy Birth marvellous.  Without the Spirit who shall sing to Thee?  A new
muttering of prophecy is hot within me.

<span id="iii.v.xii-p12"></span>How shall I call Thee a stranger to us,
Who art from us?  Should I call Thee Son?  Should I call Thee
Brother? <span id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477.md)   Husband should I call
Thee?  Lord should I call Thee, O Child that didst give Thy Mother a
second birth from the waters?

<span id="iii.v.xii-p14"></span>For I am Thy sister, of the house of
David the father of us Both.  Again, I am Thy Mother because of Thy
Conception, and Thy Bride am I because of Thy sanctification, Thy
handmaid and Thy daughter, from the Blood and Water wherewith Thou hast
purchased me and baptised me.

<span id="iii.v.xii-p15"></span>The Son of the Most High came and dwelt
in me, and I became His Mother; and as by a second birth I brought Him
forth so did He bring me forth by the second birth, because He put His
Mother’s garments on, she clothed her body with His glory.

<span id="iii.v.xii-p16"></span>Tamar, who was of the house of David,
Amnon put to shame; and virginity fell and perished from them both.  My
pearl is not lost:  in Thy treasury it is stored, because Thou hast put
it on.

<span id="iii.v.xii-p17"></span>The scent of her brother-in-law slunk
from Tamar, whose perfume she had stolen.  <span id="page_246">p.
246</span> <span id="iii.v.xii-Page_246"></span>As for Joseph’s Bride,
not even his breath exhaled from her garments, since she conceived
Cinnamon. <span id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478.md)  A wall of fire was
Thy Conception unto me, O holy Son.

<span id="iii.v.xii-p19"></span>The little flower was faint, because the
smell of the Lily <span id="fr_479"></span>[480](#fn_479.md) of Glory was
great.  The Treasure-house of spices stood in no need of flower or its
smells!  Flesh stood aloof because it perceived in the womb a Conception
from the Spirit.

<span id="iii.v.xii-p21"></span>The woman ministers before the man,
because he is her head.  Joseph rose to minister before his Lord, Who
was in Mary.  The priest ministered before Thy ark by reason of Thy
holiness.

<span id="iii.v.xii-p22"></span>Moses carried the tables of stone which
the Lord wrote, and Joseph bare about the pure Tablet in whom the Son of
the Creator was dwelling.  The tables had ceased, because the world was
filled with Thy doctrine.

<span id="iii.v.xii-p10"></span> The Roman Editor points out that this
alludes to a rite in the Syrian Liturgy, in which the officiating Priest
is instructed to dip one portion of the consecrated bread into the cup
and sprinkle the rest with it.
