<span id="iii.v.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.v.xiii-p1.1"></span>Hymn XII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.xiii-p2.1"></span>The</span> Babe that I carry carries me,
saith Mary, and He has lowered His wings, and taken and placed me
between His pinions, and mounted into the air; and a promise has been
given me that height and depth shall be my Son’s.

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p3"></span>I have seen Gabriel that called him
Lord, and the high priest the aged servant, that carried Him and bare
Him.  I have seen the Magi when they bowed down, and Herod when he was
troubled because the King had come.

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p4"></span>Satan also who strangled the little ones
that Moses might perish, <span id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480)
murdered the little ones that the Living One might die.  To Egypt He
fled, Who came to Judea that He might labour and wander there:  he
sought to catch the man that would catch himself.

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p6"></span>In her virginity Eve put on the leaves
of shame:  Thy Mother put on in her Virginity the garment of Glory that
suffices for all.  She gave the little vest of the Body to Him that
covers all.

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p7"></span>Blessed is she in whose heart and mind
Thou wast!  A King’s palace she was by Thee, O Son of the King, and a
Holy of Holies by Thee, O High Priest!  She had not the trouble nor
vexation of a family, or a husband!

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p8"></span>Eve, again, was a nest and a den for the
accursed serpent, that entered in and dwelt in her.  His evil counsel
became bread to her that she might become dust.  Thou art our Bread, and
Thou art also \[of\] our race and our garment of glory.

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p9"></span>He that has sanctity, if he be in
danger, lo! here is his Guardian!  He that has iniquity, lo! here is his
Pardoner!  He that has a devil, here is the Pursuer thereof!  They that
have pains, lo! here is the Binder up of their breaches.

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p10"></span>He that has a child, let him come and
become a brother to my Well-beloved! <span
id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481)   He that has a daughter or a young
woman of his race, let her come and become the bride of my Glorious
One!  He that has a servant, let him set him free, that he may come and
serve his Lord.

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p12"></span>The son of free men that bears Thy
yoke, my Son, shall have one reward; and the slave that bears the burden
of the yoke of two masters, of Him above and of Him below, there are two
blessings for him, and two rewards of the two burdens. <span
id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482)

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p14"></span>The free woman, my Son, is Thy
handmaid:  also if she who is in bondage serve Thee, in Thee she is
free:  in Thee she shall be comforted, because she is freed; hidden
apples in her bosom are stored up, <span
id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483) if she love Thee!

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p16"></span><span id="page_247">p. 247</span> <span
id="iii.v.xiii-Page_247"></span>O chaste woman, long ye for my
Well-beloved, that He may dwell in you; and ye also that are impure that
He may sanctify you! ye Churches also, that the Son of the Creator Who
came to renew all creatures, may adorn you!

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p17"></span>He received the foolish who worshipped
and served all the stars; He renewed the earth which was worn out
through Adam, who sinned and waxed old.  The new formation was the
creature of its Renewer, and the all-sufficient One repaired the bodies
along with their wills.

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p18"></span>Come ye blind, and without money
receive lights!  Come ye lame, and receive your feet! ye deaf and dumb,
receive your voice! come thou also whose hand is cut off; the maimed
also shall receive his hands.

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p19"></span>It is the Son of the Creator Whose
treasure-houses are filled with all manner of helps.  Let him that is
without eyeballs come to Him that makes clay and changes it, that makes
flesh, that enlightens eyes.

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p20"></span>By the small portion of clay He shows
that it was with His hand that Adam was formed:  the soul of the dead
also bears Him witness, that by Him it was that the breath of man was
breathed in; by the last witnesses He was accredited to be the Son of
Him Who is the First.

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p21"></span>Gather ye together and come, O ye
lepers, and receive purification without labour.  For He will not wash
you as Elisha, who baptized seven times in the river:  neither will He
trouble you as the priests did with their sprinklings.  Foreigners and
also strangers have betaken themselves to the Great Physician.

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p22"></span>The rank of strangers hath no place
with the King’s Son; the Lord makes not Himself strange to His servants,
\[or conceal\] that He is Lord of all.  For if the Just makes the body
leprous, and Thou purifiest it; then, the Former of the body hateth the
body; but Thou lovest it.

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p23"></span>And if it be not Thy forming, being
Just, Thou wouldest not have healed it; <span
id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484) and if it were not Thy creature, when
in health, Thou wouldest not have afflicted it.  The punishments that
Thou has cast upon it, and the pains which Thou hast healed, proclaim
that Thou art the Creator’s Son.

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p13"></span> This passage is to be observed as one
of the many in which the Fathers encourage masters to set slaves free,
although they pretty uniformly held (as St. E. here seems to do also)
that slaves, if they had the choice, should use slavery rather.
