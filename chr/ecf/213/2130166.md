<span id="iii.iii.ii.ii-p2"></span>Fuller details, of more or less
authentic character, are forthcoming in many quarters.  In Syriac, we
have two Lives, a longer and a shorter; but whether the latter is an
abridgment of the former, or is rather the nucleus from which the other
has been expanded, is questionable.  Of both alike, the date and the
authorship are undetermined.  The longer of the two is entitled, the
*History* \[*tash itha*\] of the holy Mar Ephraim.  It varies not a
little in the two copies of it \[the Vatican and the Parisian\] which
have been edited; <span id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248) and contains
many things that are not easily credible, and some things that are
irreconcilable with one another, or with established facts.  In the main
facts, however, this *History* is borne out by the Greek authorities—the
narrations of three fifth-century historians, Socrates, Sozomen and
Theodoret, the brief notices of Jerome, *De Viris Illustribus* (392),
and of Palladius, in his *Lausiac History* (circ. 420) ci., and (what is
of most weight) the almost contemporary biographical particulars
contained in the Encomium pronounced on Ephraim by Gregory of Nyssa. 
Other Greek Lives are extant;—one which bears the name of a writer
coeval with Gregory, Amphilochius of Iconium, but is certainly by a
later hand; one anonymous, and one ascribed to Simeon the Metaphrast, a
writer of the tenth century. <span id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249)

<span id="iii.iii.ii.ii-p5"></span>We proceed to give an outline of the
contents of the Syriac History, adding to it here and there such further
noteworthy details or incidents as have reached us from the other
sources indicated.  Further on, it will be our business to examine this
narrative and ascertain how far its statements are in themselves
credible, or attested by other and earlier evidence.

<span id="iii.iii.ii.ii-p4"></span> Of these, the one, which is ascribed
to Amphilochius, is perhaps the basis on which the longer Syriac Life
was constructed.
