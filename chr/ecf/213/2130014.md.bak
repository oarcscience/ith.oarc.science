<span id="ii.v.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.v.viii-p1.1"></span>Epistle VIII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.viii-p2"></span>To the Bishops of Sardinia.

<span id="ii.v.viii-p3"></span>Gregory to Vincentius, Innocentius,
Marinianus, Libertinus, Agatho, and Victor, Bishops of Sardinia.

<span id="ii.v.viii-p4"></span>We have learnt that it is the custom of
your island after the paschal festival, for you to go, or to send your
representatives to your Metropolitan, and for him, whether you know the
time or not, to give you directions by a written announcement concerning
the following Easter.  And, as report goes, some of you, neglecting to
do this according to custom, pervert the hearts of others also to
disobedience.  It is added also that some of you, when seeking parts
beyond sea in cases that arise touching their churches, venture to
travel without the knowledge of their aforesaid metropolitan, or letters
from him, such as canonical order prescribes.  <span id="page_5">p.
5</span> <span id="ii.v.viii-Page_5"></span>We therefore exhort your
Fraternity that, conforming to the custom of your churches, as well with
respect to the announcement of Easter, as also if need should compel any
of you to travel anywhere for business of your own, you should ask leave
of your said metropolitan according to the rule imposed upon you; except
that, if (as we hope will not be the case) you should happen to have a
case against your said Metropolitan, then those who are in haste on this
account to seek the judgment of the Apostolic See have licence to do so,
as you know is allowed in the canons by the institution even of the
ancient Fathers.
