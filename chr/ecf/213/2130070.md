<span id="ii.vi.iii-p4"></span>Gregory to Clementina, &c.

<span id="ii.vi.iii-p5"></span>Know, glorious daughter, that the
presbyter <span id="page_44">p. 44</span> <span
id="ii.vi.iii-Page_44"></span>Amandus has been elected to the episcopate
by the people of Surrentum.  And, we having written for him to be sent
hither, you ought not to be saddened for his absence, seeing that one
who is with you in heart should not even be believed to be departing
from you.  And, since he who once pleased you is acceptable to those who
want a bishop, bless Almighty God for this, and with Christian devotion
rejoice the more; and gladly do your best to further his coming to us
for the advantage of others speedily, since it is the part of sincere
charity to exult when one who is loved is called that he may grow.

<span id="ii.vi.iii-p3"></span> It is a sign of Gregory’s habitual
courtesy to ladies of rank, as well as of their influential position,
that he is moved to send her a kind of apology for removing from
Constantinople a priest whom she valued, and who may have been her
spiritual adviser.  See also the epistle which follows, in which the
subdeacon in charge of the proceedings is directed to resort to her in
person to solicit her consent.  Amandus was after his death venerated as
a Saint at Surrentum.  In the Church of SS. Felix and Baculus there is
this epitaph;—“Hic requiescit sacerdos Dei Amandus episcopus sanctæ
ecclesiæ Surrentinæ, qui sedit annos xvii. dies xxi.  Depositus est die
13, mense Aprilis, indict. 5, imperante D.N. Heraclio R. Aug. anno 7. 
Orate pro me, sancte Pater,” (*Migne, Patrilog., in loc.*)
