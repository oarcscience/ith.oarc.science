<span id="iii.iv.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.iv.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Hymn XXXVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.xxvii-p2"></span>1.  My throne was set for me in
Sheol:  and one arose that was dead, and hurled me from it.  Every man
feared me alone, and I feared no man.  Terror and trouble *were* among
the living, rest and peace among the dead. In a man that was slain lo!
there has entered into Sheol He that takes her captive. I used to take
all men captive: the Son of Captivity Whom I took captive has taken me
captive. He Whom I took captive has led her away and is gone to
Paradise.  *R., Blessed is He Who has quickened the dead of Sheol by His
Cross!*

<span id="iii.iv.xxvii-p3"></span>2.  All men complain much against me;
and I against one only have complained.  Who is there among men so just
as I?  Has corruption touched my integrity?  I held all men in
affection, and whoso hates me knows *it*; I know not all my days what a
bribe is.  The person of a king have I not accepted.  By me is preached
equality, for bondman and his lord in Sheol I make equal.

<span id="iii.iv.xxvii-p4"></span>3.  Before God it is that I minister,
with Whom is no acceptance of persons.  What other is there that endures
as I do, I that am cursed when I do good?  Perversely are requited to me
the benefits I have rendered.  Though my deeds are goodly, my name is
not goodly.  Yet my mind rests in its integrity:  in God it is that I
comfort myself; for though He is good He is denied every day and endures
*it*.

<span id="iii.iv.xxvii-p5"></span>4.  The old I remove from all
sufferings, likewise the young from all sins.  Secret contention I quell
in Sheol; in our land there is no iniquity:  it is Sheol and Heaven
alone, that are removed from all sins; this earth that lies between, in
her iniquity dwells.  He therefore that is prudent will either go up
into Heaven, or, if that be *too* hard, will go down to Sheol which is
easy.

<span id="iii.iv.xxvii-p6"></span>5.  To one man because of one that is
dead, every man hastes to comfort *him*.  But for me though many of my
dead have come to life, there is none that comes in and comforts me. 
Satan came in, against Whom, had been proclaimed seven woes even against
him; though mightily the Son of Mary had trodden on him, *yet* uplifted
is his spirit; for he is the serpent that strives though bruised. 
Better is it for me to fall and worship, before this Jesus Who has
conquered me by His Cross.

<span id="iii.iv.xxvii-p7"></span>6.  When He enters at the gate of
Sheol, in place of John who preached before His coming, then will I cry
“Lo! He that quickens the dead is come; Thy servant am I from
henceforth, Jesu!  Because of The Body I <span id="page_200">p.
200</span> <span id="iii.iv.xxvii-Page_200"></span>reviled Thee, for it
covered Thy Godhead.  Be not angry, O Son of the King, against Thy
treasury; at Thy command I have opened and closed.  Though my wings *be*
very swift it is at thy nod I haste to every quarter.

<span id="iii.iv.xxvii-p8"></span>7.  All that have been raised were not
first born; for our Lord is the First-born of Sheol.  How can *any that*
is dead go before Him, that power whereby he was raised?  There are last
that are first, and younger that have become first-born.  For though
Manasseh was first-born, how could it be that Ephraim should take the
birthright?  And if the second born was set before him, how much rather
shall the Lord and Creator prevent *all* in His Resurrection!

<span id="iii.iv.xxvii-p9"></span>8.  Lo! John as a herald declares that
he is later, though he was elder-born; for he said, “Behold a man cometh
after me, and yet He was before me.”  For how could he be before Him,
that Power in Whom he preached?  For everything that comes to pass
because of *another* thing, is after *that other* even though it *seem
to* be before.  For the cause which called it *into being*, is elder
*than it* and before *it* in all things.

<span id="iii.iv.xxvii-p10"></span>9.  The cause of Adam was elder than
*all* creatures, which were made for him, for to him even to Adam He had
respect continually, the Creator even while he was creating.  Thus
though Adam as yet was not, he was elder than *all* creatures.  How much
more then, my Lord, must this Thy manhood be elder, which in Thy Godhead
is, from eternity with Him that begat Thee!  To Thee *be* praise and
through Thee to Thy Father from us all!

<span id="iii.iv.xxvii-p11"></span>10.  To Thee *be* praise for Thou art
the first, in Thy Godhead and in Thy manhood!  For even though Elijah
was first to go up, he was not able to prevent Him, for whose sake he
was taken up.  For his type depended on Thy verity:  and even though the
types apparently are before Thy fulfilment, it is before them secretly. 
Creatures were before Adam; he was before them because for his sake they
were made.

<span id="iii.iv.xxvii-p12"></span>11.  O my Lord, work for me this
resurrection, not of Thy compulsion but of Thy love.  For Thy compulsion
gives life to sinners also:  Iscariot would rather again choose for
himself the death of Sheol, than the life of Gehenna.  Work for me then
the resurrection that is of Thy mercy; and even though Thy justice
permits not, let there be occasion for Thy grace.  This only let it
remember for me, that in it I have sought refuge.
