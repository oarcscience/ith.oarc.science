<span id="ii.v.xii"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.v.xii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xii-p2"></span>To John, Bishop of Syracuse.

<span id="ii.v.xii-p3"></span>Gregory to John, &c.

<span id="ii.v.xii-p4"></span>One coming from Sicily has told me that
some friends of his, whether Greeks or Latins I know not, as though
moved by zeal for the holy Roman Church, murmur about my arrangements
\[i.e. of divine service\], saying, How can he be arranging so as to
keep the Constantinopolitan Church in check, when in all respects he
follows her usage?  And, when I said to him, What usages of hers do we
follow? he replied; you have caused Alleluia to be said at mass out of
the season of Pentecost <span id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md) ; you have
made appointment for the sub-deacons to proceed disrobed <span
id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) , and for Kyrie Eleison to be said, and
for the Lord’s Prayer to be said immediately after the canon.  To him I
replied, that in none of these things have we followed another Church.

<span id="ii.v.xii-p7"></span>For, as to our custom here of saying the
Alleluia, it is said to be derived from the Church of Jerusalem by the
tradition of the blessed Jerome in the time of pope Damasus of blessed
memory; and accordingly in this matter we have rather curtailed the
former usage which had been handed down to us here from the Greeks.

<span id="ii.v.xii-p8"></span>Further, as to my having caused the
sub-deacons to proceed disrobed, this was the ancient usage of the
Church.  But it pleased one of our pontiffs, I know not which, to order
them to proceed in linen tunics.  For <span id="page_9">p. 9</span>
<span id="ii.v.xii-Page_9"></span>have your Churches in any respect
received their tradition from the Greeks?  Whence, then, have they at
the present day the custom of the subdeacons proceeding in linen tunics,
except that they have received it from their mother, the Roman Church?

<span id="ii.v.xii-p9"></span>Further, we neither have said nor now say
the Kyrie Eleison, as it is said by the Greeks:  for among the Greeks
all say it together; but with us it is said by the clerks, and responded
to by the people; and as often as it is said, Christe Eleison is said
also, which is not said at all among the Greeks.  Further, in daily
masses we suppress some things that are usually said, and say only Kyrie
Eleison, Christe Eleison, so as to devote ourselves a little longer to
these words of deprecation.  But the Lord’s prayer (*orationem
Dominicam*) we say immediately after the prayer (*mox post precem*) for
this reason, that it was the custom of the apostles to consecrate the
host of oblation to (*ad*) that same prayer only.  And it seemed to me
very unsuitable that we should say over the oblation a prayer which a
scholastic had composed, and should not say the very prayer <span
id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md) which our Redeemer composed over His body
and blood <span id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md) .  But also the Lord’s
Prayer among the Greeks is said by all the people, but with us by the
priest alone.  Wherein, then, have we followed the usages of the Greeks,
in that we have either amended our own old ones or appointed new and
profitable ones, in which, however, we are not shewn to be imitating
others?  Wherefore, let your Charity, when an occasion presents itself,
proceed to the Church of Catana; or in the Church of Syracuse teach
those who you believe or understand may possibly be murmuring with
respect to this matter, holding a conference there, as though for a
different purpose, and so desist not from instructing them.  For as to
what they say about the Church of Constantinople, who can doubt that it
is subject to the Apostolic See, as both the most pious lord the emperor
and our brother the bishop of that city continually acknowledge?  Yet,
if this or any other Church has anything that is good, I am prepared in
what is good to imitate even my inferiors, while prohibiting them from
things unlawful.  For he is foolish who thinks himself first in such a
way as to scorn to learn whatever good things he may see.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[8:25](2130018.htm#fr_24.md) <span
id="ii.v.xii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xii-p5"></span> I.e. the fifty days between Easter and
Whitsuntide.  It appears from St. Augustine (see Migne, *Patrolog. note
in loc*.) that it was the custom everywhere to sing the Alleluia between
Easter and Pentecost, but that its use at other times varied.  The point
of what Gregory here says seems to be that the Roman custom of saying it
at other times had not been derived from the Greeks; but that, on the
contrary, it was said at other times less frequently at Rome than among
the Greeks.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[8:26](2130018.htm#fr_25.md) <span
id="ii.v.xii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xii-p6"></span> *Procedere spoliatos*:  i.e. to proceed
to the altar for celebration without linen tunics on.  The verb
*procedere* and the noun *processio* are commonly used by Gregory and
others in the special sense of approaching the altar for mass.  It would
seem from what is here said that the subdeacons at mass had not been
originally distinguished by a vestment, and that some pope before
Gregory had first vested them at Rome.  He, as further appears, had
disrobed the subdeacons; and his point here is, that his doing so was
not an imitation of the Greeks, but a return to ancient usage.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[9:27](2130018.htm#fr_26.md) <span
id="ii.v.xii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xii-p10"></span> The word found here is *traditionem*: 
but, because of the undoubted reference to the Lord’s Prayer (*dominica
oratio*), and of the verb *composuit*, it is conjectured that the
reading ought to be *orationem*.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[9:28](2130018.htm#fr_27.md) <span
id="ii.v.xii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xii-p11"></span> This whole passage in the original
is;—“Orationem vero Dominicam idcirco mox post precem dicimus, quia mos
apostolorum fuit ut ad ipsam solummodo orationem oblationis hostiam
consecrarent.  Et valde mihi inconveniens visum est ut precem quam
scholasticus composuerat super oblationem diceremus, et ipsam
traditionem (Qy. for *orationem?*) quam Redemptor noster composuit super
ejus corpus et sanguinem non diceremus.”  It is to be observed that, for
lack of suitable words in English, the translation does not retain the
distinction in the original between *precem* and *orationem*, the former
denoting the prayer of consecration in the Canon, exclusive of the
Lord’s Prayer, the latter the Lord’s Prayer itself, which Gregory
appended to it.  By the *scholasticus*, to whom he assigns the
composition of the former, is meant apparently the liturgist, whoever he
might be, who had compiled the Canon of the Mass.  It would thus seem
that, according to the Roman use before the time of Gregory, the Lord’s
Prayer did not occur at all “over the oblation,” or “over the Body and
Blood,” i.e. (as the expression must be taken to mean) between
consecration and distribution, though, of course, it may have been used
before or after.  Such omission was undoubtedly peculiar.  Among other
authorities for the general usage, S. Augustine (Ep. CXLIX. *ad
Paulin*.) affirms that *nearly* every Church concludes the whole
petition (i.e. the prayer of consecration of which he has been speaking)
with the Lord’s Prayer:—“Quam totam petitionem fere omnis Ecclesia
Oratione Dominica concludit.”  In saying “*fere* omnis,” he may possibly
have had the Roman Church in view.  As to what is said by S. Gregory of
the custom of the Apostles, the most obvious meaning of which is, that
they used no prayer of consecration but the Lord’s Prayer, we have no
means of ascertaining whence he derived this tradition, or what the
value of it might be.  It does not, of course, imply that the words of
institution were not said over the elements by the Apostles, but only
that they used no other prayer for the purpose of consecration.  Ways
have been suggested, though not satisfactory, for evading the apparent
meaning of the statement.
