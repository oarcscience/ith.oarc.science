<p class="c18"><a name="ii.ix.i-p3"></A><span class="c1"><a name="ii.ix.i-p3.1"></A>Epistle I.</span></p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ii.ix.i-p4"></A>To the Roman Citizens.</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="ii.ix.i-p5"></A>Gregory, servant of the servants of God, to his most beloved sons the Roman citizens.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ix.i-p6"></A>It has come to my ears that certain men of perverse spirit have sown among you some things that are wrong and opposed to the holy faith, so as to forbid any work being done on the Sabbath day.&#160; What else can I call these but preachers of Antichrist, who, when he comes, will cause the Sabbath day as well as the Lord&#146;s day to be kept free from all work.&#160; For, because he pretends to die and rise again, he wishes the Lord&#146;s day to be had in reverence; and, because he compels the people to judaize that he may bring back the outward rite of the law, and subject the perfidy of the Jews to himself, he wishes the Sabbath to be observed.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ix.i-p7"></A>For this which is said by the prophet, <i>Ye shall bring in no burden through your gates on the Sabbath day</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#024">Jerem. xvii. 24</a><a name="ii.ix.i-p7.1"></A>), could be held to as long as it was lawful for the law to be observed according to the letter.&#160; But after that the grace of Almighty God, our Lord Jesus Christ has appeared, the commandments of the law which were spoken figuratively cannot be kept according to the letter.&#160; For, if any one says that this about the Sabbath is to be kept, he must needs say that carnal sacrifices are to be offered:&#160; he must say too that the commandment about the circumcision of the body is still to be retained.&#160; But let him hear the Apostle Paul saying in opposition to him, <i>If ye be circumcised, Christ profiteth you nothing</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#002">Galat. v. 2</a><a name="ii.ix.i-p7.2"></A>).</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ix.i-p8"></A>We therefore accept spiritually, and hold spiritually, this which is written about the Sabbath.&#160; For the Sabbath means rest.&#160; But we have the true Sabbath in our Redeemer Himself, the Lord Jesus Christ.&#160; And whoso acknowledges the light of faith in Him, if he draws the sins of concupiscence through his eyes into his soul, he introduces burdens through the gates on the Sabbath day.&#160; We introduce, then, no burden through the gates on the Sabbath day if we draw no weights of sin through the bodily senses to the soul.&#160; For we read that the same our Lord and Redeemer did many works on the Sabbath day, so that he reproved the Jews, saying, <i>Which of you doth not loose his ox or his ass on the Sabbath day, and lead him away to watering</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#015">Luke xiii. 15</a><a name="ii.ix.i-p8.1"></A>)?&#160; If, then, the very Truth in person commanded that the Sabbath should not be kept according to the letter, whoso keeps the rest of the Sabbath according to the letter of the law, whom else does he contradict but the Truth himself?</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ix.i-p9"></A>Another thing also has been brought to my knowledge; namely that it has been preached to you by perverse men that no one ought to wash on the Lord&#146;s day.&#160; And indeed if any one craves to wash for luxury and pleasure, neither on any other day do we allow this to be done.&#160; But if it is for bodily need, neither on the Lord&#146;s day do we forbid it.&#160; For it is written, <i>No man ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth it and cherisheth it</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#029">Ephes. v. 29</a><a name="ii.ix.i-p9.1"></A>).&#160; And again it is written, <i>Make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014">Rom. xiii. 14</a><a name="ii.ix.i-p9.2"></A>).&#160; He, then, who forbids provision for the flesh in the lusts thereof certainly allows it in the needs thereof.&#160; For, if it is sin to wash the body on the Lord&#146;s day, neither ought the face to be washed on that day.&#160; But if this is allowed for a part of the body, why is it denied for the whole body when need requires?&#160; On the Lord&#146;s day, however, there should be a cessation of earthly labour, and attention given in every way to prayers, so that if anything is done negligently during the six days, it may be expiated by supplications on the day of the Lord&#146;s resurrection.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ix.i-p10"></A>These things, most dear sons, being endowed with sure constancy and right faith, observe; despise the words of foolish men, and give not easy belief to all that you hear of having been said by them; but <A NAME="page_93"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 93</FONT></A> <a name="ii.ix.i-Page_93"></A>weigh it in the scale of reason, so that, while in firm stability you resist the wind of error you may be able to attain to the solid joys of the heavenly kingdom.</p>
