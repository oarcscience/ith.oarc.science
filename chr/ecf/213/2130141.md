<span id="ii.ix.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.ix.xi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXVI.</span>

<span id="ii.ix.xi-p2"></span>To Anthemius, Subdeacon.

<span id="ii.ix.xi-p3"></span>Gregory to Anthemius, Subdeacon of
Campania.

<span id="ii.ix.xi-p4"></span>It has reached our ears that our brother
and fellow-bishop Paschasius <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213) is
so idle and negligent in all ways that he is in no respect recognised as
bishop; and that so neither his own Church, nor the monasteries, nor
any, whether the sons of the Church <span
id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214) , or the oppressed poor, are conscious
of any earnestness of love on his part towards them; nor does he afford
any help in what is just to those who supplicate him, and (what is a
still more serious thing to say) he cannot bear on any account to
receive the counsels of the wise and of such as admire what is right, so
that he might at any rate learn from another what he cannot attend to of
himself; but, passing over the things that pertain to a pastor’s charge,
he occupies himself with his whole attention unprofitably in the
building of ships.  Whence, as is reported, it has come to pass that he
has already lost four hundred solidi, or more.  This also is added to
his faults, that he is said to go down daily to the sea with one or two
clerics in so mean a guise as to be the talk among his own people, and
to scent to strangers so vile and despicable that he is judged to have
nothing in him of the character or venerableness of a bishop.  If this
be so, know that it is not without fault of thine, who hast delayed to
rebuke and restrain him, as is fit.  Seeing, then, that all this not
only discredits him, but also evidently brings reproach on the office of
the priesthood, we desire thee to summon him for this thing before other
priests <span id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215) , or some of his noble
sons <span id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216) , and exhort him that,
shaking off the vice of sluggishness, he be not idle, but vigilant in
the care of his Church and of the monasteries, exhibit fatherly charity
to his sons, stand up for the defence of the poor with discretion in
cases that are commended by justice, and receive gladly the counsels of
the wise, to the end that both that city may be comforted by his
solicitude, and he himself succeed in covering the faults of his
idleness.  If however, as we do not believe will be the case, after this
our exhortation he should venture to be negligent after his accustomed
manner, he must by all means be sent to us, that in our presence he may
learn what it becomes a priest to do, and how to do it, after the fear
of God.  Given in the month of March, Indiction 6.

<span id="ii.ix.xi-p5"></span> Bishop of Naples.  A few epistles not
included in this translation are addressed to him as such.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[98:215](2130141.htm#fr_214) <span
id="ii.ix.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ix.xi-p6"></span> *Filii ecclesiæ*, or, according to the
authority of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.ix.xi-p6.1"></span>mss.</span>, simply *filii*.  Cf. III. 56,
where the expression occurs.  It is understood to denote the lay members
of any Church, among whom those of the highest social position were
called *nobiles* (see below), and others *plebs*.  Mandates for the
election of bishops are addressed to *clero, nobilibus, ordini, et
plebi* (as in II. 6), or to *clero ordini, et plebi* (as in I. 58), or
occasionally *clero et nobilibus* (as in I. 80); *ordo* being understood
to denote persons of position, though not ranking as nobles.
