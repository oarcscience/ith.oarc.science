id="ii.vii.i-p2.1"></span>Epistle I.</span>

<span id="ii.vii.i-p3"></span>To John, Abbot.

<span id="ii.vii.i-p4"></span>Gregory to John, Abbot of Mount Sina <span
id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122) .

<span id="ii.vii.i-p6"></span>The Epistle of thy Humility testifies to
the holiness of thy life; whence we give great thanks to Almighty God,
for that we know that there are still some to pray for our sins.  For
we, under the colour of ecclesiastical government, are tossed in the
billows of this world, which frequently overwhelm us.  But by the
protecting hand of heavenly grace we are raised up again from the deep. 
Do you, then, who lead a tranquil life in the so great serenity of your
rest, and stand as it were safe on the shore, extend the hand of your
prayer to us who are on our voyage, or rather who are suffering
shipwreck, and with all the supplications in your power help us as we
strive to reach the land of the living, so that not only for your own
life, but also for our rescue, you may have reward for ever.  May the
Holy Trinity protect thy Love with the right hand of Its protection, and
grant unto thee in Its sight, by praying, by admonishing, by shewing
example of good work, to feed the flock committed to thee, that so thou
mayest be able to reach the pastures of eternal life with the flock
itself which thou feedest.  For it is written, *My sheep shall come and
shall find pastures* ([John x. 27](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#027)<span
id="ii.vii.i-p6.1"></span>).  And these pastures in truth we find, when,
freed from the winter of this life, we are satisfied with the greenness
of eternal life, as of a new Spring.

<span id="ii.vii.i-p7"></span>We have learnt from the report of our son
Simplicius that there is a want of beds and bedding in the
*Gerontocomium* <span id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123) , which has been
constructed by one Isaurus there.  Wherefore we have sent 15 cloaks, 30
*rachanæ* <span id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124) , and 15 beds.  We
have also given money for the purchase of mattresses and for their
transport, which we beg thy Love not to disdain, but to supply them to
the place for which they have been sent.  Given on the day of the
Kalends of September, Indiction 4.

<span id="ii.vii.i-p5"></span> No doubt the John called *Climacus*,
*Scholasticus*, and *Sinaita*, commemorated as a saint on 30 March. 
Having entered the monastery of Mount Sinai at the age of 16, he is said
to have retired thence to live the life of an anchoret, to have been
elected abbot at the age of 75, to have again after a time retired into
solitude, and to have died early in the 7th century.  While abbot, he
wrote a work called *Scala* (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.vii.i-p5.1"></span>κλὶμαξ</span>) *Paradisi*, whence his name of
*Climacus*.  The monastery on Mount Sinai was a place to which
pilgrimages were made.  Cf. IV. 46.

<span id="ii.vii.i-p8"></span> Properly a hospital for aged persons.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[52:125](2130083.htm#fr_124) <span
id="ii.vii.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii.i-p9"></span> The meaning of the word *rachana*,
*racana*, or *racahina*, is uncertain.  It occurs again in XI. 78, where
Barbara and Antonina, two young ladies at Constantinople, are thanked
for a present of two *racanæ*, which they had alleged to be of their own
workmanship.  It is usually supposed to mean some wooller article of
dress, worn by monks.  Others understand *blankets.*
