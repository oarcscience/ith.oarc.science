<span id="iii.vii.ii-p4"></span><span class="c50"><span
id="iii.vii.ii-p4.1"></span>Hymn I.</span>

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p5"></span>1.  On a certain day a pearl did I take
up, my brethren; I saw in it mysteries pertaining to the Kingdom;
semblances and types of the Majesty; it became a fountain, and I drank
out of it mysteries of the Son.

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p6"></span>I put it, my brethren, upon the palm of
my hand, that I might examine it:  I went to look at it on one side, and
it proved faces on all sides.  I found out that the Son was
incomprehensible, since He is wholly Light.

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p7"></span>In its brightness I beheld the Bright
One Who cannot be clouded, and in its pureness a great mystery, even the
Body of our Lord which is well-refined:  in its undividedness I saw the
Truth which is undivided.

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p8"></span>It was so that I saw there its pure
conception,—the Church, and the Son within her.  The cloud was the
likeness of her that bare Him, and her type the heaven, since there
shone forth from her His gracious Shining.

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p9"></span>I saw therein His trophies, and His
victories, and His crowns.  I saw His helpful and overflowing graces,
and His hidden things with His revealed things.

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p10"></span>2.  It was greater to me than the ark,
for I was astonied thereat:  I saw therein folds without shadow to them
because it was a daughter of light, types vocal without tongues,
utterances of mysteries without lips, a silent harp that without voice
gave out melodies.

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p11"></span>The trumpet falters and the thunder
mutters; be not thou daring then; leave things hidden, take things
revealed.  Thou hast seen in the clear sky a second shower; the clefts
of thine ears, as from the clouds, they are filled with interpretations.

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p12"></span>And as that manna which alone filled
the people, in the place of pleasant meats, with its pleasantnesses, so
does this pearl fill me in the place of books, and the reading thereof,
and the explanations thereof.

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p13"></span>And when I asked if there were yet
other mysteries, it had no mouth for me that I might hear from, neither
any ears wherewith it might hear me.  O thou thing without senses,
whence I have gained new senses!

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p14"></span>3.  It answered me and said, “The
daughter of the sea am I, the illimitable sea!  And from that sea whence
I came up it is that there is a mighty treasury of mysteries in my
bosom!  Search thou out the sea, but search not out the Lord of the sea!

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p15"></span>“I have seen the divers who came down
after me, when astonied, so that from the midst of the sea they returned
to the dry ground; for a few moments they sustained it not.  Who would
linger and be searching on into the depths of the Godhead?

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p16"></span>“The waves of the Son are full of
blessings, and with mischiefs too.  Have ye not seen, then, the waves of
the sea, which if a ship should struggle with them would break her to
pieces, and if she yield herself to them, and rebel not against them,
then she is preserved?  In the sea all the Egyptians were choked, though
they scrutinised <span id="page_294">p. 294</span> <span
id="iii.vii.ii-Page_294"></span>it not, and, without prying, the Hebrews
too were overcome upon the dry land, and how shall ye be kept alive? 
And the men of Sodom were licked up by the fire, and how shall ye
prevail?

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p17"></span>“At these uproars the fish in the sea
were moved, <span id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518.md) and Leviathan also. 
Have ye then a heart of stone that ye read these things and run into
these errors?  O great fear that justice also should be so long
silent!” <span id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519.md)

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p20"></span>4.  “Searching is mingled with
thanksgiving, and whether of the two will prevail?  The incense of
praise riseth along with the fume of disputation from the tongue, and
unto which shall we hearken?  Prayer and prying \[come\] from one
mouth, <span id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520.md) and which shall we listen
to?

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p22"></span>“For three days was Jonah a neighbour
\[of mine\] in the sea:  the living things that were in the sea were
affrighted, \[saying,\] “Who shall flee from God?  Jonah fled, and ye
are obstinate at your scrutiny of Him!”
