<span id="iii.iii.ii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.iii.ii.ix-p1.1"></span>IX.—The Selections Included in the
Present Collection.</span>

<span id="iii.iii.ii.ix-p2"></span>The specimens of Ephraim’s
compositions offered in these selections are:—

<span id="iii.iii.ii.ix-p3"></span>(1) The *Nisibene Hymns*, (2) The
*Hymns of the Nativity*, (3) The *Hymns for the Epiphany*, (4) Three
*Homilies* (i., *On our Lord*; ii., *On Reproof and Repentance*; iii.,
*On the Sinful Woman*).

<span id="iii.iii.ii.ix-p4"></span>Of (2) the *Nativity* Hymns, the
first thirteen are reprinted from the version by the Rex. J. B. Morris
(Oxford, 1847), made from the Roman Edition of the Syriac *Works of
Ephraim*.  The rest of the series as translated (six <span
id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311) in number, making nineteen in all.md)
were unknown when that edition was completed in 1743.  These latter, and
also (3) the *Epiphany* Hymns (with one exception) <span
id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md) have since come to light in the
Nitrian collection of the British Museum, and were printed by Professor
Lamy in his *St. Ephraim* <span id="page_151">p. 151</span> <span
id="iii.iii.ii.ix-Page_151"></span> (Tom. I, cc. 1–144; Tom. II., cc.
427–504), 1882–1889.  In the same edition (Tom. I., cc. 145–274;
311–338) were first printed (4) the three Homilies. <span
id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md)   Our translations of these follow
Lamy’s text, with here and there a slight variation where errors seem to
exist.  These two series of Hymns belong to the ecclesiastical class: 
their titles appropriate them to two great Festivals of the Church, and
portions of these are embodied in Syriac Rituals still in use.  Of the
two Homilies, the former was written for the Feast of the Epiphany, like
the Hymns which precede it.

<span id="iii.iii.ii.ix-p8"></span>The *Nisibene Hymns* (1) are
translated from the text as first printed by Dr. Bickell (1866), whose
edition, like that of Dr. Lamy, rests upon <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii.ii.ix-p8.1"></span>mss.</span> of the Nitrian
collection. <span id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314.md)   They also were
unknown to the Roman editors of the last century, and to the English
translator of 1847; and they have not till now appeared in English.  The
series when complete consisted of 77 Hymns.  Of these the first division
(I.–XXXIV.) treat of the fortunes of the Church in Nisibis, Carrhena
\[Haran\], and an unnamed city (probably Edessa). <span
id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315)   The remainder (XXXV. to end.md) deal
with the topics of Death and the Resurrection.  The present selection
comprises 46 of these, namely:—of the *first* division, the first 21,
those which relate to Nisibis and which are the *Nisibene Hymns* proper;
of the *second* division, two series—one of 8 hymns (XXXV.–XLII.) in
which Death and Satan hold monologue or dialogue,—the other of 17
(LII.–LXVIII.), similar in character, but with Man as a third
interlocutor.
