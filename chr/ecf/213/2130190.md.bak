<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.iv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Hymn XIII.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.xiv-p2.1"></span>Concerning Mar Jacob and his
Companions.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p3"></span>1.  Three illustrious priests, after the
manner of the two great lights,—have carried on and handed down one to
another, the See and the Hand and the Flock.—To us whose mounting was
great for the two, this last is wholly a consolation.  *R., Glory to
Thee Who didst choose them!*

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p4"></span>2.  He Who created two great lights,
chose for Himself *these* three Lights,—and set them in the three dark
seasons of siege that have been.—When *that* pair of Lights was
quenched, the other shone wholly forth.

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p5"></span>3.  These three priests were treasures,
who held in their faithfulness,—the key of the Trinity; three doors they
opened for us;—each one of them with his key, unlocked and opened his
door.

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p6"></span>4.  In the first was opened the door,
for the chastisement that befel us;—in the next was opened the door, for
the King’s power that came down on us,—in the last was opened the door,
for the good tidings that came up for us.

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p7"></span>5.  In the first was opened the door,
for battle between two hosts;—in the next were opened doors, for the
kings from either wind;—in the last was opened the door, for ambassadors
from either side.

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p8"></span>6.  In the first was opened the door,
for battle because of misdeeds;—in the next was opened the door,—for the
kings because of strife;—in the last was opened the door, for
ambassadors because of mercies.

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p9"></span>7.  Lo! in these three successions, as
in a mystery and a figure,—wrath is likened to the sun; it began under
the first;—it waxed strong under the next; it sank and was quenched
under the last.

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p10"></span><span id="page_181">p. 181</span> <span
id="iii.iv.xiv-Page_181"></span>8.  Three figures the Sun also, shows
forth in the three quarters:—its rising *is* keen and bright; its
meridian strong and overpowering;—and like a torch that is burnt out,
its setting *is* mild and pleasant.

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p11"></span>9.  Small yet bright *is* its rising,
when it comes to waken sleepers;—hot and overpowering its meridian, when
it comes to ripen the fruits;—tender and pleasant its setting, when it
reaches its consummation.

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p12"></span>10.  Who is this daughter born of vows,
enviable above all women,—whose successions thus proceed, and her ranks
are thus manifold,—and her degrees thus ascend, and her teachers thus
excel.

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p13"></span>11.  Do these similitudes belong, only
to the daughter of Abraham,—or to thee too, O daughter, born of vows,
whose adorning is according as thy beauty?—for as thine occasion, *so
was* thy help, and as thy help *so was* its minister.

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p14"></span>12.  According to the measure of her
need, there came to her the supply of her need.—Her fathers were as
*was* her birth; her teachers were as *was* her understanding;—her
training as *was* her growth; her raiment as *was* her stature.

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p15"></span>13.  Grace weighed out *to her* and
gave all these things as in the scales;—she laid them in *her* balance,
that therefrom there might be profit;—she drew them into succession,
that therefrom might be perfection.

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p16"></span>14.  In the days of him that *was*
first, peace abounded and peace vanished;—in the days of him that was
next, kings came down and kings went back;—but in the days of the last,
hosts assailed and hosts retreated.—

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p17"></span>15.  By the first order came in, it
came in with him and went out with him;—by the next the diadem that
gladdened our churches, came nigh and withdrew far away;—but by the last
there dawned on us, grace that was not thankfully received.

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p18"></span>16.  Against the wrath that was first,
the labour of the first contended;—against the heat that was at noon,
the shade of the second stood up;—against peace that was thankless, the
last multiplied warnings.

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p19"></span>17.  For the first invader of the land
*was* the first and illustrious priest;—for the second invader of the
land, was the second and merciful priest:—but the prayers of him that
was last, repaired our breaches secretly.

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p20"></span>18.  Nisibis is set <span
id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351.md) upon waters, waters secret and
open:—living streams *are* within her; a noble river without her.  The
river without deceived her; the fountain within has saved her.

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p22"></span>19.  The first priest was her
vinedresser; he made her branches to grow even unto heaven.—Lo! being
dead and buried within her, he has become fruit in the midst of her
bosom:—when therefore the pruners came, the fruit that *was* in her
midst preserved her.

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p23"></span>20.  The time of her pruning came; it
entered and took from her her vinedresser,—that there should not be one
to pray for her.  She made haste in her subtlety;—He laid in her bosom
her vinedresser, that she should be delivered through her vinedresser.

<span id="iii.iv.xiv-p24"></span>21.  Be ye wise like Nisibis, O ye
daughters of Nisibis,—for that she laid the body within her, and it
became a wall without her.—Place ye within you the living body, that it
be a wall for your lives!
