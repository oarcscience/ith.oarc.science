<span id="ii.ix.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.ix.x-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXII.</span>

<span id="ii.ix.x-p2"></span>To Rusticiana, Patrician Lady.

<span id="ii.ix.x-p3"></span>Gregory to Rusticiana, &c.

<span id="ii.ix.x-p4"></span>As often as any one comes to us from the
royal city, we take care to enquire of your bodily health; but, my sins
being the cause, I always hear what I am sorry to hear, since, frail and
weak as you already are, it is reported that the pains of gout still
grow upon you.  But I pray the Almighty Lord that whatever befalls your
body may be ordered to the health of your soul, and that temporal
scourges may prepare for you eternal rest, and that through the pains
which have an end He may grant you joys without end.  As for me, I live
in such a state of groaning and in the midst of such occupations that it
irks me to have arrived at these days which now I spend, and my only
consolation is the expectation of death.  Wherefore I beg you to pray
for me, to the end that I may be soon released from this prison of the
flesh, so as <span id="page_98">p. 98</span> <span
id="ii.ix.x-Page_98"></span>to be no longer tormented by such great
pains.

<span id="ii.ix.x-p5"></span>Furthermore, I have to inform you that a
certain person has come here, Beator by name, who gives himself out as
*comes privatarum* <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211) , and is
doing many things against all, but principally against your Excellency’s
people, or those of your most noble granddaughters, as though he were
making enquiry into matters of public import.  And we indeed will not
permit him to act wrongfully, but neither can we stand in the way of
public interests.  Do you therefore treat as you can with the most pious
princes, that they may countermand any wrongful proceeding on his part. 
For neither is the public interest served by any kind of turmoil, nor
does he appear to reclaim anything of great amount.  I beg that my most
sweet son the lord Strategius <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212) be
greeted in my behalf, whom may Almighty God nourish for Himself and for
you, and ever comfort you by His own grace and by the young lord’s
life.  Further, what should I write to you concerning your return
hither, knowing as you do how much I desire it?  But, when I look to the
obligations of the business that detains you, I am in despair; and so I
implore the Creator of all that, wherever you are, and wherever you may
be, He would protect you by the extension of His right hand, and
preserve you from all evil.
