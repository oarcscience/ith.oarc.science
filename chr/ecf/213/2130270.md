<span id="iii.vii.vii"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.vii.vii-p1.1"></span>Hymn VI.</span>

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p2"></span>1.  Would that the memory of the
fathers would exhale from the tombs; who were very simple as being wise,
and reverend as believing.  They without cavilling searched for, and
came to the right path.

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p3"></span>He gave the law; the mountains melted
away; fools broke through it.  By unclean ravens He fed Elijah at the
desert stream; and moreover gave from the skeleton honey unto Samson. 
They judged not, nor inquired why it was unclean, why clean.

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p4"></span>2.  And when He made void the sabbaths,
the feeble Gentiles were clothed with health.  Samson took the daughter
of the aliens, and there was no disputing among the righteous; the
prophet also took a harlot, and the just held their peace.

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p5"></span>He blamed the righteous, <span
id="fr_541"></span>[542](#fn_541) and He held up and lifted up \[to
view\] their delinquencies:  He pitied sinners, <span
id="fr_542"></span>[543](#fn_542) and restored them without cost:  and
made low the mountains of their sins: <span
id="fr_543"></span>[544](#fn_543)   He proved that God is not to be
arraigned by men, and as Lord of Truth, that His servants were His
shadow; and whatsoever way His will looked, they directed also their own
wills; and because Light was in Him, <span
id="fr_544"></span>[545](#fn_544) their shadows were enlightened.

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p10"></span>3.  How strangely perplexed are all
the heretics by simple things!  For when He plainly foreshadowed this
New Testament by that of the Prophets, those pitiable men rose, as
though from sleep, and shouted out and made a disturbance.  And the Way,
wherein the righteous held straight on, and by their truths had gone
forth therein, that \[Way\] have these broken <span
id="fr_545"></span>[546](#fn_545) up, because they were besotted:  this
they left and went out of; because they pried, an evil searching,
\[yea,\] an evil babbling led them astray.

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p12"></span>They saw the ray:  they made it
darkness, that they might grope therein:  they saw the jewel, even the
faith:  while they pried into it, it fell and was lost.  Of the pearl
they made a stone, that they might stumble upon it.

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p13"></span>4.  O Gift, which fools have made a
poison!  The People were for separating Thy beauteous root from Thy
fountain, though they separated it not:  \[false\] teachings estranged
Thy beauty also from the stock thereof.

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p14"></span>By Thee did they get themselves
estranged, who wished to estrange Thee.  By Thee the tribes were cut off
and scattered abroad from out of Sion, and also the \[false\] teachings
of the seceders.

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p15"></span>Bring Thyself within the compass of
our littleness, O Thou Gift of ours.  For if love cannot find Thee out
on all sides, it cannot be still and at rest.  Make Thyself small, Thou
Who art too great for all, Who comest unto all!

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p16"></span><span id="page_299">p. 299</span>
<span id="iii.vii.vii-Page_299"></span>5.  By this would those who
wrangle against our Pearl be reproved; because instead of love, strife
has come in and dared to essay to unveil thy beauty.  It was not graven,
since it is a progeny which cannot be interpreted.

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p17"></span>Thou didst show thy beauty among the
abjects to show whereto thou art like, thou Pearl that art all faces. 
The beholders were astonied and perplexed at thee.  The separatists
separated thee in two, and were separated in two by thee, thou that art
of one substance throughout.

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p18"></span>They saw not thy beauty, because there
was not in them the eye of truth.  For the veil of prophecy, full as it
was of the mysteries; to them was a covering of thy glistering faces: 
they thought that thou wast other \[than thou art\], O thou mirror of
ours! and therefore these blind schismatics defiled thy fair beauty.

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p19"></span>6.  Since they have extolled thee too
much, or have lowered thee too much, bring them to the even level.  Come
down, descend a little from that height of infidelity and heathendom;
and come up from the depth of Judaism, though thou art in the Heaven.

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p20"></span>Let our Lord be set between God and
men! <span id="fr_546"></span>[547](#fn_546)   Let the Prophets be as it
were His heralds!  Let the Just One, as being His Father, rejoice! that
Word it is which conquered both Jews and Heathens!

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p22"></span>7.  Come, Thou Gift of Holy Church,
stay, rest in the midst of Her!  The circumcised have troubled Thee, in
that they are vain babblers, and so have the \[false\] doctrines in that
they are contentious.  Blessed be He that gave Thee a goodly company
which bears Thee about!

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p23"></span>In the covenant of Moses is Thy
brightness shadowed forth:  in the new covenant Thou dartest it forth: 
from those first Thy light shineth even unto those last.  Blessed be He
that gave us Thy gleam as well as Thy bright rays.
