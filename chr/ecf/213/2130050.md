<span id="ii.v.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.v.xliv-p1.1"></span>Epistle CV.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xliv-p2"></span>To Serenus Bishop of Massilia
(Marseilles).

<span id="ii.v.xliv-p3"></span>Gregory to Serenus, &c.

<span id="ii.v.xliv-p4"></span>That we have been so long in sending a
letter to your Fraternity attribute not to sluggishness, but to press of
business.  We now commend to you in all respects the bearer of these
presents, our most beloved son Cyriacus, the Father of our Monastery,
that no delay may detain him in the city of Massilia, but that he may
proceed under God’s protection to our brother and fellow-bishop
Syagrius <span id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md) with the succour of your
Holiness.

<span id="ii.v.xliv-p6"></span>Furthermore we notify to you that it has
come to our ears that your Fraternity, seeing certain adorers of images,
broke and threw down these same images in Churches.  And we commend you
indeed for your zeal against anything made with hands being an object of
adoration; but we signify to you that you ought not to have broken these
images.  For pictorial representation is made use of in Churches for
this reason; that such as are ignorant of letters may at least read by
looking at the walls what they cannot read in books.  Your Fraternity
therefore should have both preserved the images and prohibited the
people from adoration of them, to the end that both those who are
ignorant of letters might have wherewith to gather a knowledge of the
history, and that the people might by no means sin by adoration of a
pictorial representation <span id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md) .

<span id="ii.v.xliv-p5"></span> It appears from Epistle CIX. below that
Cyriacus was being now sent to the bishop of Autun with the special view
of getting a synod called by queen Brunechild for restraining the simony
and other ecclesiastical irregularities which were prevalent in Gaul. 
Cf. also above, IX. II, to Brunechild.
