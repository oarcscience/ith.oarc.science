id="iii.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Hymn XIV.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p2"></span>1.  Under the three pastors,—there were
manifold shepherds;—the one mother that *was* in the city,—had daughters
in all regions.—Since Wrath has destroyed her dwellings,—Peace shall
build up her churches.  *R. Blessed be He who chose out those three!*

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p3"></span>2.  The kindly labour of the first,—bound
up the land in her affliction:—the bread and wine of the next,—healed
the city when site was broken:—the sweet speech of the last,—sweetened
our bitterness in affliction.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p4"></span>3.  The first tilled the land with his
labour,—he rooted out of her the briars and thorns:—the next fenced her
round about,—he made a hedge for her of them that were saved:—the last
opened the garner of his Lord,—and sowed in her the words of her Lord.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p5"></span>4.  The first priest by means of a
fast,—closed up the doors of *men’s* mouths:—the second priest for the
captives,—opened the mouths of the purse:—but the last pierced through
the ears,—and fastened in them the ornament of life.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p6"></span>5.  Aaron stripped off from the ears,—the
earrings and made a calf.—That lifeless calf in secret,—pierced and
slaughtered the camp:—those who had fashioned his horns, —he ripped them
up with his horns.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p7"></span>6.  But our priest *who was* the
third,—pierced through the ears of the heart:—and fastened *there* the
earrings he had fashioned,—of the nails that were fixed in the cross,
—whereon his Lord was crucified,—and gave life to His fellow-men.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p8"></span>7.  A son unto death the fire brought
forth;—Death feeds upon all bodies:—the son of Death who surpassed
Death,—upon the souls of men he fed.—The calf forsook his provender,—for
*men’s* minds were the food for him.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p9"></span>8.  To the first Tree that which
killed,—to it grace brought forth a son.—O Cross offspring of the
Tree,—that didst fight against thy sire!—The Tree was the fount of
death;—the Cross was the fount of life.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p10"></span>9.  The son that was born to Death,—all
mouths were opened to curse him.—He devoured bodies and souls,—and
multiplied the disgrace of his father.—But the Cross caused to pass away
the rebuke,—of its father that first Tree.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p11"></span>10.  The two sons were even as were—the
*two* mothers that bare them.—The calf which the fire brought forth,—the
fire consumed in the midst of the people:—the Cross the offspring of
grace,—divided good gifts to *all* creation.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p12"></span>11.  O my tongue hold thy peace and be
silent of the histories of the Cross that press *to be told!*—for my
mind of a sudden has conceived,—and lo! pangs of travail smite it:—it
has conceived these among the last,—and they strive to become the
firstborn.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p13"></span>12.  The babes struggled in the
womb;—the elder made haste to come forth:—the younger desiring the
birthright,—laid his hand upon his heel;—that which he obtained not by
birth,—he obtained by the mess of pottage.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p14"></span>13.  After the like sort these later
histories,—lo! they make light of the former *ones*,—that *themselves*
may come forth and take the birthright.—Let us bring forth the history
of our fathers,—for lo! the histories of the Cross—*are* the firstborn
of *all* creatures.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p15"></span>14.  For if that which has no
beginning—is the first of all created things,—its histories also are the
firstborn,—for they are elder than *all* creatures.—Let the histories of
Thee, O my Lord, yield place,—that we may tell of Thy ministers!

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p16"></span>15.  The first in degree of
doctrine,—His eloquence was like as *was* his degree;—the next who was
second in degree,—his interpretation mounted to the height of his
degree;—the last who was third in degree,—his eloquence was great as he
*was*.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p17"></span><span id="page_183">p. 183</span> <span
id="iii.iv.xv-Page_183"></span>16.  The first in his simple words,—gave
milk unto his infants;—the next in his plain sayings,—gave victual to
his children;—the third in his perfect sayings,—gave meat to his *that
were* of perfect age.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p18"></span>17.  She too the daughter of
instruction,—mounted from degree to degree,—along with her teachers and
fathers.—A young child she was with the first; a simple *maid* was she
with the next;—she came to perfect age in the third.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p19"></span>18.  The first *dealing* with her as a
child,—loved her and taught her to fear;—the next as with a damsel,
rebuked her and make her glad;—the third as with one fully
instructed,—was to her a solace of pleasantness.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p20"></span>19.  Even the Most High with the
daughter of Jacob,—*gave* blandishment and the rod to her childhood;—and
in her frowardness and full age,—gave part in the sword and the Law;—and
according to her discipline and instruction,—He came to her in mildness
and pleasantness.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p21"></span>20.  The first that begat the flock,—his
bosom bare her infancy;—the next of glad-some countenance,—cheered with
song and made glad her childhood;—the last grave of countenance,—lo! he
guards *her* chastity in her youth.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p22"></span>21.  The first priest who begat
*her*,—gave milk to her infancy;—the next priest interpreted,—and gave
victual to her childhood;—the third priest nourished *her*, and gave
meat to her perfect age.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p23"></span>22.  The wealthy father who *was*
first,—laid up treasures for her childhood;—the next for her
maturity—multiplied provision for her journey;—the third the goodly
olive tree,—multiplied oil in her vessels.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p24"></span>23.  When she comes before Him who is
rich,—she will show the treasure of the first;—when she comes before the
Saviour, she will show the saved ones of the next;—when she goes forth
to meet the Bridegroom,—she will show the oil of her lamps.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p25"></span>24.  Before Him who rewards the weary
toilworn,—she will offer the labour of the first;—before Him who loves
*cheerful* givers,—she will show the almsgiving of the next;—before Him
who judges doctrines,—she will offer the discourse of the last.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p26"></span>25.  And I the sinner who have striven
to be—the disciple of these three,—when they shall see Him of the Third
Day,—that he has closed the door of His chamber,—may these three pray
*Him* for me, that He keep the door *open* a little while for me!

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p27"></span>26.  May the sinner press into and
enter—rejoicing and fearing to behold!—May the three masters call in—the
one disciple in *their* grace!—May he gather up under the table—the
crumbs that are full of life!
