<p class="endnote"><a name="ii.vi.iii-p3"></A> It is a sign of Gregory&#146;s habitual courtesy to ladies of rank, as well as of their influential position, that he is moved to send her a kind of apology for removing from Constantinople a priest whom she valued, and who may have been her spiritual adviser.&#160; See also the epistle which follows, in which the subdeacon in charge of the proceedings is directed to resort to her in person to solicit her consent.&#160; Amandus was after his death venerated as a Saint at Surrentum.&#160; In the Church of SS. Felix and Baculus there is this epitaph;&#8212;&#8220;Hic requiescit sacerdos Dei Amandus episcopus sanct&aelig; ecclesi&aelig; Surrentin&aelig;, qui sedit annos xvii. dies xxi.&#160; Depositus est die 13, mense Aprilis, indict. 5, imperante D.N. Heraclio R. Aug. anno 7.&#160; Orate pro me, sancte Pater,&#8221; (<i>Migne, Patrilog., in loc.</i>)</p>
