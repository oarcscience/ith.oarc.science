id="ii.vii.xii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXVII.</span>

<span id="ii.vii.xii-p2"></span>To Romanus, Guardian (Defensorem).

<span id="ii.vii.xii-p3"></span>Gregory to Romanus, Guardian of
Sicily <span id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md) .

<span id="ii.vii.xii-p5"></span>It has come to our knowledge that, if
any one has a suit against any clerics, thou causest these clerics to be
brought before thee for judgment, setting at nought their bishops.  If
this be so, seeing that it is evidently very unsuitable, we order thee
by this our authority that thou presume not to do it any more.  But, if
any one should have a suit against any cleric, let him go to his bishop,
that either he may take cognizance himself, or at any rate that judges
may be deputed by him; or, if it should be a case for arbitration, let
the executive authority deputed by him compel the parties to choose a
judge.  But, if any cleric or lay person should have a suit against a
bishop, then thou oughtest to interpose, so that either thou thyself
mayest take cognizance of the matter between them or that on thy
admonition they may choose for themselves judges.  For, if each single
bishop has not his own jurisdiction reserved to him, what else is done
but that ecclesiastical order is confounded through us by whom it ought
to be guarded?

<span id="ii.vii.xii-p6"></span>Further, it has been reported to us
that, certain clerics having been sent into penance for fault requiring
it by our most reverend brother bishop John, thou hast on thy own
authority, without his knowledge removed them from it.  Now, if this is
true, know that thou hast done a thing altogether unseemly, and calling
for no light reproof.  Wherefore restore these clerics without delay to
their bishop.  And beware of committing this fault in future:  for,
shouldest thou be inattentive, know that thou wilt incur our anger in no
slight degree.
