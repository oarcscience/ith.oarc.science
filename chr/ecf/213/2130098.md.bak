<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XLV.</span>

<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p2"></span>*To Theoctista, Patrician* <span
id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) .

<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p4"></span>Gregory to Theoctista, &c.

<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p5"></span>We ought to give great thanks to
Almighty God, that our most pious and most benignant <span
id="page_63">p. 63</span> <span id="ii.vii.xvi-Page_63"></span>Emperors
have near them kinsfolk of their race, whose life and conversation is
such as to give us all great joy.  Hence too we should continually pray
for these our lords, that their life, with that of all who belong to
them, may by the protection of heavenly grace be preserved through long
and tranquil times.

<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p6"></span>I have to inform you, however, that I
have learnt from the report of certain persons how that, owing to the
levity of the people, a tumult of detraction has arisen against you. 
And I hear that your Excellency has consequently been distressed with no
slight vexation.  If this is so, I wonder much why the words of men on
earth should agitate you, who have fixed your heart on heaven.  For the
blessed Job, when his friends who had come to console him had broken out
into rebuke, said, *For behold my witness is in heaven, and he that
knows me is on high* ([Job xvi.
20](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p6.1"></span>).  For one who has the witness of his life
in heaven ought not to be afraid of the judgments of men on earth.  Paul
also, a leader of good men, says, *Our glory is this, the testimony of
our conscience* ([2 Cor. i. 12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p6.2"></span>).  And he says again, *Let every man prove
his own work, and so shall he have glory in himself, and not in another*
([Gal. vi. 4](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p6.3"></span>).  For, if we are rejoiced by praises and
broken down by detractions, we have set our glory not in ourselves, but
in the mouth of others.  And indeed the foolish virgins took no oil in
their vessels, but the wise ones took oil in their vessels with their
lamps ([Matth. xxv](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#000.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p6.4"></span>.).  Now our lamps are good works; of which
it is written, *Let your light shine before men, that they may see your
good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven* ([Matth. v.
16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p6.5"></span>).  And we then take oil in our vessels with
our lamps, when we seek not the splendour of glory for our good deeds
from the adulation of our neighbours, but preserve it in the testimony
of our conscience.  And in regard to all that is said of us outwardly we
ought to recur to the secrets of our soul.  Although all should revile
us, yet he is free whom conscience accuses not, while, even though all
should praise, one cannot be free, if conscience accuses him.  Whence
the Truth says concerning John, *What went ye out into the wilderness to
see?  A reed shaken with the wind?* ([Matth. xi.
7](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007)<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p6.6"></span>.md). 
And this in truth is said in the way of negation, not of assertion,
since it is added, *But what went ye out for to see?  A man clothed in
soft raiment?  Behold, they that wear soft clothing  are in kings’
houses* ([Matt. 11.8](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p6.7"></span>).  For although, according to the truth of
the Gospel, John was clothed in rough raiment, yet the signification is
that they wear soft clothing who are delighted by adulations and
praises.  And it is denied that John was a reed shaken with the wind,
inasmuch as no breath from any human mouth bent the fortitude of his
mind.  For we, if we are lifted up by praises, or cast down by
revilings, are a reed shaken with the wind.  But far be this, far be it
from the heart of your Excellency.  I know that you read studiously the
teacher of the Gentiles, who says, *I, if I yet pleased men, should not
be the servant of Christ* ([Gal. i.
10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010)<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p6.8"></span>.md).

<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p7"></span>If, however, any even slight sadness has
arisen in your mind from this cause, I believe that Almighty God has
kindly allowed this to be the case.  For not even to His elect in this
life has He promised the joys of delight, but the bitternesses of
tribulation; so that, after the manner of medicine, they may be restored
through a bitter cup to the sweetness of eternal salvation.  For what
says He?  *The world shall rejoice and ye shall lament* ([Joh. xvi.
20](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p7.1"></span>).  With what hope?  With what promise?  A
little afterwards it is added, *I will see you again, and your heart
shall rejoice, and your joy no man shall take from you* ([John
16.22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p7.2"></span>).  Hence again He says to His disciples,
*In your patience shall ye possess your souls* ([Luke xxi.
19](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#019)<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p7.3"></span>.md).

<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p8"></span>Consider, I pray you, where patience
would be, if there were nothing to be endured.  I suspect that there is
no Abel without having a Cain for his brother.  For if the good were
without the bad, they could not be perfectly good, since they would not
be purged:  and the very society of the bad is the purgation of the
good.  There were three sons of Noe in the ark, one of whom was a
derider of his father, who, though in himself he was blessed, still
received a sentence of condemnation in his son.  Abraham had two sons
before he took Cethura to wife; and yet his carnal son persecuted the
son of promise ([Genes. ix](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#000.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p8.1"></span>.).  This the great teacher expounds,
saying, *As he who is after the flesh persecuted him that is after the
Spirit, even so it is now* ([Gal. iv.
29](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p8.2"></span>).  Isaac had two sons; but one, who was
spiritual, fled before the threats of his carnal brother.  Jacob had
twelve sons, but one, who lived uprightly, was sold by ten into Egypt. 
In the case of the prophet David, because there was in him what should
have been purged, it was brought to pass that he suffered under a son’s
persecution.  The blessed Job says of the society of the reprobate, *I
have been a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls* ([Job xxx.
29](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#029.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p8.3"></span>).  To Ezekiel the Lord says, *Son of man,
unbelievers and destroyers are with thee, and thou dost dwell among
scorpions* ([Ezek. ii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p8.4"></span>).  Among the twelve apostles there was one
reprobate, that there might be one by whose persecution the eleven might
be tried.  The Prince of the apostles speaks thus to his disciples, *He
delivered just Lot,* <span id="page_64">p. 64</span> <span
id="ii.vii.xvi-Page_64"></span>*oppressed by the injury and conversation
of the wicked.  For in seeing and hearing he was just, dwelling among
those who from day to day vexed the soul of the just one with their
unrighteous deeds* ([2 Pet. 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p8.5"></span>).  Paul also the apostle writes to his
disciples, saying, *In the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among
whom ye shine as luminaries in the world, holding fast the word of life*
([Philip. ii. 15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p8.6"></span>).

<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p9"></span>Seeing then that we know from the
witness of Scripture that in this life the good cannot be without the
bad, your Excellency ought by no means to be disturbed by the voices of
fools, especially as there is then sure confidence in Almighty God, when
for well-doing any adversity is given us in this world in order that a
full reward may be reserved for us in the eternal retribution.  Whence
also in the holy Gospel the Truth says, *Blessed shall ye be when men
shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name’s sake*
([Matth. v. 11](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p9.1"></span>).  And for our consolation He deigned to
adduce as an example His own reproaches, saying, *If they have called
the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of his household*
([Matt. 10.25](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#025.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p9.2"></span>).

<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p10"></span>But there are many who perhaps praise
the life of the good more than they ought; and, lest any elation should
creep in from praise, Almighty God allows bad men to break out into
slander and objurgation, in order that, if any sin springs up in the
heart from the mouth of them that praise, it may be choked by the mouth
of them that revile.  Hence it is, then, that the teacher of the
Gentiles testifies that he continues in his preaching *through evil
report and good report* ([2 Cor. vi.
8](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#008)<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p10.1"></span>.md);
saying also, *As deceivers and yet true.*  If then there were such as
laid an evil report on Paul, and called him a deceiver, what Christian
now should account it a hard thing in behalf of Christ to hear injurious
words?  Moreover we know of how great virtue was the precursor of our
Redeemer, who in Holy Writ is called not only more than a prophet, but
even an angel:  and yet, as the history of his death testifies, after
his death his body was burnt by his persecutors <span
id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) .  But why say we these things of holy
men?  Let us speak of the Holy of holies Himself, that is of God Who was
made man for us, Who before His death heard the injurious charge that He
had a devil, and after His death was called a deceiver by His
persecutors, when one said, *We know that that deceiver said, After
three days I will rise again* ([Matth. xxvii.
63](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#063.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p11.1"></span>).  How much, then, must we sinners needs
bear from the tongues and hands of wicked men, we who are to be judged
at the coming of the eternal Judge, if He Who will even come as Judge
endured so much both before and after His death?

<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p12"></span>These things, most sweet and excellent
daughter, I have briefly said, lest, as often as thou hearest of foolish
men speaking in derogation of thee, thou shouldest be touched by even
the least sadness of heart.  But, seeing that this very murmuring of
foolish men cannot be allayed by quiet reason, I hold it to be sin if
the doing of what can be done is neglected.  For, when we appease insane
minds, and bring them back to a healthy state, we ought by no means to
cause them offence.  For there are some offences that are to be
altogether despised; but there are some which, when they can be avoided
without guilt, are not to be despised, lest there be guilt in keeping
them alive.  We learn this from the preaching of the sacred Gospel;
since, when the Truth said, *Not that which goeth into the mouth
defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a
man* ([Matth. xv. 11](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p12.1"></span>), and the disciples replied saying,
*Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this
saying?* ([Matt. 15.12](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p12.2"></span>), straightway He replied, *Every plant
which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up.  Let them
alone; they be blind, and leaders of the blind* ([Matt.
15.13](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p12.3"></span>).  And yet, when tribute was demanded, He
first gave a reason why tribute should not be paid, and forthwith
subjoined, *Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the
sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and
when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a stater.  That take,
and give unto them for me and for thee* ([Matth. xvii.
26](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#026.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p12.4"></span>).  Why is it that of some who were
offended it is said, *Let them alone; they are blind, and leaders of the
blind;* and that to others, lest they should be offended, tribute is
paid by the Lord, even though not due?  Why is it that He allowed one
offence to remain, but forbade another to be caused to others?  Why, but
that He might teach us on the one hand to despise offences which
implicate us in sin, but on the other to mitigate in all ways those
which we can appease without sin?

<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p13"></span>Wherefore your Excellency, God
protecting you, may, with great quietness, turn aside the offences of
bad men.  For the chief of them you should of your own accord call to
you privately and give them reasons, and anathematize certain wrong
points which they suppose to be held by you.  And if too, as it is said
may be the case, they suspect such anathema to be insincere, you should
confirm it even by an oath, averring that you do not <span
id="page_65">p. 65</span> <span id="ii.vii.xvi-Page_65"></span>hold, and
never have held, those points.  Nor let it seem beneath you to satisfy
them in such a way; nor let there be in your mind any feeling of disdain
against them on account of your imperial race.  For we are all brethren
created by the power of one Emperor, and redeemed by His blood.  And so
we ought not in anything to despise our brethren, however poor and
abject.

<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p14"></span>For certainly Peter had received power
in the heavenly kingdom, so that whatever he should bind or loose on
earth should be bound or loosed in heaven; he walked on the sea, he
healed the sick with his shadow, he slew sinners with his word, he
raised the dead by his prayer.  And because by the admonition of the
Spirit he had gone in to Cornelius the Gentile, a question was raised
against him by the believers as to why he had gone in among Gentiles and
eaten with them, and why he had received them in baptism.  And yet this
first of the apostles, filled with such gifts of grace, supported by
such power of miracles, replied to the complaint of the believers, not
by power but by reason, and explained the case to them in order; how he
saw a certain vessel, as it had been a sheet, in which were four-footed
beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of
the air, let down from heaven, and heard a voice saying, *Arise, Peter;
kill and eat* ([Acts xi. 5](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p14.1"></span> *seq.*); how three men came to him calling
him to Cornelius; how the Holy Spirit bade him go with them; how the
same Holy Spirit who had been wont to come on those baptized in Judea
after baptism, came on the Gentiles before baptism.  For if, when he was
blamed by the believers, he had paid regard to the authority which he
had received in Holy Church, he might have replied that the sheep should
not dare to find fault with the shepherd to whom they had been
committed.  But, had he said anything of his own power in answer to the
complaint of the believers, he would not have been truly a teacher of
gentleness.  He pacified them, therefore, by giving a reason humbly, and
even produced witnesses to defend him from blame, saying, *Moreover
these six brethren accompanied me* ([Acts xi.
12](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p14.2"></span>).  If, then, the pastor of the Church, the
Prince of the Apostles, who singularly did signs and miracles, disdained
not, in defending himself from blame, humbly to give a reason, how much
more ought we sinners, when we are blamed for anything, to pacify those
who blame us by giving a reason humbly!

<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p15"></span>For to me, as you know, when I was
resident at the footsteps of my lords in the royal city, many used to
come of those who were accused with respect to the aforesaid points. 
But I declare, my conscience bearing me witness, that I never found in
them any error, any pravity, or anything of what was said against them. 
Whence also I took care, despising report, to receive them familiarly,
and rather to defend them from their accusers.  For it used to be said
against them that under pretext of religion they dissolved marriages;
and that they said that baptism did not entirely take away sins; and
that, if any one did penance for three years for his iniquities, he
might afterwards live perversely; and that, if they said under
compulsion that they anathematized anything for which they were blamed,
they were by no means holden by the bond of anathema.  Now if there are
any who undoubtedly hold and maintain such views, there is no doubt that
they are not Christians.  And such both I, and all catholic bishops, and
the universal Church, anathematize, because they think what is contrary
to the truth, and speak what is contrary.  For, if they say that
marriages should be dissolved for the sake of religion <span
id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) , be it known that, though human law
has conceded this, yet divine law has forbidden it.  For the Truth in
person says, *What God hath joined together let not man put asunder*
([Matth. xix. 6](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p16.1"></span>).  He says also, *It is not lawful for a
man to put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication* ([Matt.
19.9](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p16.2"></span>).  Who then may contradict this heavenly
legislator?  We know how it is written, *Two shall be one flesh* ([Matt.
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#005.md), [1 Cor.
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#016.md), [Gen.
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p16.3"></span>).  If, then, a man and wife are one flesh,
and a man puts away his wife for the sake of religion, or a woman her
husband while he remains in this world, even though perchance he turns
aside to unlawful deeds, what is this conversion <span
id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md) , in which one and the same flesh on
the one part passes to continence and on the other part remains in
pollution?  If, however, it should suit both to lead a continent life,
who may dare to accuse them, since it is certain that Almighty God, who
has granted what is less, has not forbidden what is greater?  And indeed
we know of many holy persons who have both previously led continent
lives with their consorts, and have afterwards passed over to the rules
of holy Church.  For in two ways holy men are accustomed to abstain even
from lawful things.  Sometimes that they may increase their merits
before Almighty God; but sometimes that they may wipe away the sins of
their former life.  For when the three children who were brought under
obedience to the Babylonian King, asked for pulse for food, being
unwilling to make use of the king’s <span id="page_66">p. 66</span>
<span id="ii.vii.xvi-Page_66"></span>meat, it was not because it would
have been sin in them to eat what God had created.  They were unwilling,
then, to take what it was lawful for them to take, that their virtue
might increase through continence.  But David, who had taken to himself
another man’s wife, and had been sorely scourged for his fault, desired
long afterwards to drink water from the cistern of Bethlehem; which when
his bravest soldiers had brought to him, he refused to drink it, and
poured it out as a libation to the Lord.  For it was lawful for him to
drink it, had he been so minded; but, because he remembered having done
what was unlawful, he laudably abstained even from what was lawful.  And
he, who to his guilt previously feared not that the blood of dying
soldiers should be shed, afterwards considered that, were he to drink
the water, he would have shed the blood of living soldiers, saying,
*Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in
jeopardy* ([1 Chron. xi. 19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p17.1"></span>)?  Accordingly, when good husbands and
wives desire either to increase merit or to do away with the faults of
previous life, it is lawful for them to bind themselves to continence
and to aspire to a better life.  But, if the wife does not follow after
the continence which the husband aspires to, or the husband refuses that
which the wife aspires to, it is not lawful for wedlock to be cut
asunder, seeing that it is written, *The wife hath not power of her own
body, but the husband; and the husband hath not power of his own body,
but the wife* ([1 Cor. vii. 4](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p17.2"></span>).

<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p18"></span>But, if there are any who say that sins
are only superficially put away in baptism, what can be more against the
faith than such preaching, whereby they would fain undo the very
sacrament of faith, wherein principally the soul is bound to the mystery
of heavenly cleanness, that, being completely absolved from all sins, it
may cleave to Him alone of Whom the Prophet says, *But it is good for me
to cleave to God* ([Psa. 73.28](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#028.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p18.1"></span> <span id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md)
)?  For certainly the passage of the Red Sea was a figure of holy
baptism, in which the enemies behind died, but others were found in
front in the wilderness.  And so to all who are bathed in holy baptism
all their past sins are remitted, since their sins die behind them even
as did the Egyptian enemies.  But in the wilderness we find other
enemies, since, while we live in this life, before reaching the country
of promise, many temptations harass us, and hasten to bar our way as we
are wending to the land of the living.  Whosoever says, then, that sins
are not entirely put away in baptism, let him say that the Egyptians did
not really die in the Red Sea.  But, if he acknowledges that the
Egyptians really died, he must needs acknowledge that sins die entirely
in baptism, since surely the truth avails more in our absolution than
the shadow of the truth.  In the Gospel the Lord says, *He that is
washed needeth not to wash, but is clean every whit* ([Joh. xiii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p19.1"></span>).  If, therefore, sins are not entirely
put away in baptism, how is he that is washed clean every whit?  For he
cannot be said to be clean every whit, if he has any sin remaining.  But
no one can resist the voice of the Truth, *He that is washed is clean
every whit.*  Nothing, then, of the contagion of sin remains to him whom
He Himself who redeemed him declares to be clean every whit.

<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p20"></span>But, if there are any who say that
penance is to be done for sin during any three years, and that after the
three years one may live in pleasures, these know neither the preaching
of the true faith nor the precepts of sacred Scripture.  Against these
the excellent preacher says, *He that soweth in his flesh shall of the
flesh also reap corruption* ([Galat. vi.
8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p20.1"></span>).  Against these he says again, *They that
are in the flesh cannot please God* ([Rom. viii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#008)<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p20.2"></span>.md);
where he subjoins to his disciples, *But ye are not in the flesh, but in
the Spirit.*

<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p21"></span>Now they are in the flesh who live in
carnal pleasures.  Against them it is said, *Neither shall corruption
possess incorruption* ([1 Cor. xv.
50](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#050.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p21.1"></span>).  But, if they say that a short season of
penitence may suffice against sin, so that one may be allowed to return
again to sin, rightly does the sentence of the first pastor hit them,
when he says, *It is happened unto them according to the true proverb;
The dog is turned to his own vomit again, and the sow that was washed to
her wallowing in the mire* ([2 Pet. ii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#022.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p21.2"></span>).  For great is the efficacy of penitence
against sin; but only if one persevere in this penitence.  For it is
written, *He that shall persevere unto the end, the same shall be saved*
(<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p21.3"></span>Matth. x. 22: xxiv. 13).  Hence
again it is written, *He that is baptized from a dead body, and toucheth
it again, what availeth his washing?* ([Ecclesiasticus
34.25](../../../bib/apo/sir034.htm#025.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p21.4"></span> <span id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md)
).  Now a dead body is every perverse work, which draws a man to death,
because he lives not in the life of righteousness.  He, then, is
baptized from a dead body, and again touches it, who deplores the bad
works which he remembers having done, but after his tears entangles
himself in the same again.  Washing, therefore, from such dead body
avails not any soul that does again what it has bemoaned, and rises not
through the lamentations of penitence to the rectitude of <span
id="page_67">p. 67</span> <span
id="ii.vii.xvi-Page_67"></span>righteousness.  For to do penance truly
is not only to bemoan what has been committed, but also to decline from
what has been bemoaned.

<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p23"></span>But, if there are any who say that, if
any one shall have anathematised anything under compulsion of necessity,
he is not held by the bond of the anathema, these are themselves
witnesses that they are no Christians.  For they think by vain attempts
to loose the binding of holy Church, and hereby neither do they account
as real the absolution of holy Church which she offers to the faithful,
if they think that her binding is of no avail.  Against such as these
dispute should be no longer held, since they ought to be altogether
scorned and anathematised; and whence they think to elude the truth,
thence let them in reality be bound in their sins.

<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p24"></span>If, then, there are any who under the
Christian name dare either to preach, or to hold silently in their own
minds, the points of error which we have spoken of above, these
undoubtedly we both have anathematised and do anathematise.  Yet, as I
have said before, in those who used to come to me in the royal city I
observed no error at all as to any one of the aforesaid points, nor do I
think there was any.  For, if there had been, I should have observed
it.  However, since there are many of the faithful who are inflamed with
unwise zeal, and often, while they attack certain persons as though they
were heretics, themselves make heresies, consideration should be had for
their infirmity, and, as I have said before, they should be appeased
with reason and gentleness.  For indeed they are like unto those of whom
it is written, *I bear them record, that they have a zeal of God, but
not according to knowledge* ([Rom. x.
2](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p24.1"></span>).  Wherefore your Excellency, who live
incessantly in reading, in tears, and in alms, should, as I have
requested, appease their unwisdom by gentle exhortations and replies,
that not only in yourself, but also in them, you may find the glory of
eternal retribution.  All this my exceeding love has induced me to say
to you, since I think that your joy is my gain, and your sadness my
loss.  May Almighty God guard you with heavenly grace, and, keeping safe
the Piety of our lord and the Tranquillity of our most pious lady,
prolong your life for the education of the little lords.

<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p3"></span> Sister of the emperor Mauricius, and
governess of the imperial children.  See also I. 5, VII. 26.  This long
letter to her was called forth by her having complained to Gregory of
erroneous views in matters of religion being imputed to her at
Constantinople, for which she seems to have been maligned in certain
quarters.  In his reply, with his habitual courtesy, he takes for
granted that such imputations were unfounded, though the pains he takes
to combat the errors with which she was charged may perhaps suggest the
idea of his not being in his heart quite assured of her soundness.  The
whole letter, both for its tone and for its style of argumentation, is
very characteristic of the writer.
