<span id="ii.vi.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.vi.vi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXIV.</span>

<span id="ii.vi.vi-p2"></span>To Fortunatus, Bishop of Neapolis
(Naples).

<span id="ii.vi.vi-p3"></span>Gregory to Fortunatus, &c.

<span id="ii.vi.vi-p4"></span>When your Fraternity pays too little
attention to the monasteries that are under you, you both lay yourself
open to reproof, and make us sorry for your laxity.  Now it has come to
our ears that one Mauricius, who lately became a monk in the monastery
of Barbacianus, has fled from the same monastery, taking other monks
with him.  In this case the hastiness of the aforesaid Barbacianus
inculpates him exceedingly in our sight, in that he rashly tonsured a
secular person without even previous probation.  Did we not write to you
that you should prove him first, and then, if he were fit, should make
him abbot?  Even now, then, look well after him whom you chose.  For you
are delinquent in his delinquency, if he has begun so to demean himself
as to shew himself unfit to have the government of brethren.

<span id="ii.vi.vi-p5"></span>Further, let your Fraternity more strictly
interdict all monasteries from venturing by any means to tonsure those
whom they may have received for monastic profession before <span
id="page_45">p. 45</span> <span id="ii.vi.vi-Page_45"></span>they have
completed two years in monastic life.  But in this space of time let
their life and manners be carefully proved, lest any one of them should
either not be content with what he had desired or not keep firm to what
he had chosen.  For, it being a serious matter that untried men should
be associated under obedience to any master, how much more serious is it
that any who have not been proved should be attached to the service of
God?

<span id="ii.vi.vi-p6"></span>Further, if a soldier should wish to
become a monk, let no one for any cause whatever presume to receive
him <span id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md) without our consent, or
before it has been reported to us.  If this rule is not diligently
observed, know that all the guilt of those that are under thee redounds
on thyself, seeing that thou provest thyself by the very facts of the
case to be too little anxious about them.
