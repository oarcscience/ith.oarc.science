id="ii.vii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Epistle LIX.</span>

<span id="ii.vii.xxv-p2"></span>*To Theoderic, King of the Franks* <span
id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) .

<span id="ii.vii.xxv-p4"></span>Gregory to Theoderic, &c.

<span id="ii.vii.xxv-p5"></span>The letter of your Excellency, which is
the index of your heart, has so shewn, in its flow of lucid language,
what great prudence is conspicuous in you, along with royal power, that
there can be no doubt of the truth of whatever fame has reported in your
praise.  And inasmuch as you signify, by what you say in praise of it,
that our exhortation has so pleased your royal mind that you wish
whatever you know to pertain to the worship of our God, to the
veneration of Churches, or to the honour of priests, to be both
carefully established and in all ways guarded, we appeal to you with a
renewed exhortation, with a view to your greater reward, that you would
order a synod to be assembled, and, as we have before written, cause
corporal vices in priests and the pravity of simoniacal heresy to be
condemned by the definition of all the bishops, and to be cut off within
the limits of your kingdom, and allow not any longer money to have more
effect than the precepts of the Lord.  For, since all avarice is the
service of idols, whosoever does not watchfully guard against it, and
especially in the bestowal of ecclesiastical honours, is subjected to
the perdition of infidelity, even though he may seem to hold the faith
which he disregards.  As, then, against external enemies, so also
against adversaries of souls among yourselves, take ye earnest heed,
that on account of this your faithful opposition to God’s enemies you
may both reign prosperously here under His protection, and also come
hereafter by the leading of His grace to eternal joys.

<span id="ii.vii.xxv-p6"></span>Furthermore, what benefits your
Excellence bestowed on our most reverend brother and fellow-bishop
Augustine on his progress to the nation of the Angli we have been told
by certain monks who have returned to us from him.  Wherefore, returning
abundant thanks, we beg that you will deign to afford your support in
full measure to these monks also who have been sent to him, and to aid
them on their onward journey, so that the more amply you shew your
kindness to them, the greater return you may expect from Almighty God,
whom they serve.
