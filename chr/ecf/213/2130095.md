<span id="ii.vii.xiii-p2"></span>*To Vitus, Guardian (Defensorem* <span

<span id="ii.vii.xiii-p4"></span>Gregory to Vitus, &c.

<span id="ii.vii.xiii-p5"></span>If thou art held bound by no condition
or liability to bodily service, and hast not been a cleric of any other
city, and if there is no canonical objection to thee, it is our will and
pleasure, with a view to the advantage of the Church, that thou receive
the office of Guardian of the Church, in order that thou mayest execute
incorruptly and diligently whatever may be enjoined thee by us for the
benefit of the poor; using this privilege which after deliberation we
have conferred on thee, so as to do thy diligence faithfully in
accomplishing all that may be enjoined thee by us, as having to render
an account of thy doings before the judgment of our God.  This epistle
we have dictated for writing to Paterius, *secundicerio notario* of our
Church <span id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md) , and have subscribed it.
