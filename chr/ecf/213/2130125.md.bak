id="ii.viii.iv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXV.</span>

<span id="ii.viii.iv-p2"></span>*To Romanus, Guardian
(Defensorem*) <span id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) .

<span id="ii.viii.iv-p4"></span>Gregory to Romanus, &c.

<span id="ii.viii.iv-p5"></span>It is well known to thy Experience that
Peter, whom we have made a guardian (*defensorem*), is sprung from the
estate belonging to our Church which is called Vitelas.  And so, since
we ought to shew kindness towards him in such a way that nevertheless
the Church may suffer no disadvantage, we command thee by this order to
charge him strictly not to presume, under any pretext or excuse, to
marry his children anywhere but in that estate to which they are bound
by law and their condition <span id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) .  In
this matter, too, it is necessary for thy Experience to be very careful,
and to threaten them, so that on no occasion whatever they may go out of
the property to which by their birth they are subjected.  For, if any
one of them (as we do not believe will be the case) should presume to
depart from it, he may be assured that our assent will never be given to
any of them dwelling or being married outside the estate on which they
were born, but that also their land should be superscribed <span
id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) .  And then know that you will run no
slight risk, if through your negligence any of them should attempt to do
any of the things which we forbid.

id="ii.viii.iv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.viii.iv-p3"></span> Romanus had been appointed guardian
(*defensor*) of the patrimony in Sicily.  See IX. 18.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[89:196](2130125.htm#fr_195.md) <span
id="ii.viii.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.viii.iv-p6"></span> This was a case of a native of Sicily,
who had been *ascriptus glebæ*, having been appointed a *Defensor
Ecclesiæ*.  The purpose of the epistle is to guard against his supposing
that such appointment exempted his children from the restrictions
imposed by their birth.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[89:197](2130125.htm#fr_196.md) <span
id="ii.viii.iv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.viii.iv-p7"></span> *Sed et superscribi terram eorum*.  The
meaning may be that notices should be put on the land to which such
defaulters were attached, declaring that such and such persons belonged
to it and were bound to remain on it.  Cf. V. 41, note 3, on the phrase
*titulos imponere*.
