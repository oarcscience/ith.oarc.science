<span id="iii.ix.iv-p1"></span> *<span class="c1"><span
id="iii.ix.iv-p1.1"></span>Demonstration V.</span>*<span
class="c1"><span id="iii.ix.iv-p1.2"></span>—<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ix.iv-p1.3"></span>Of</span> Wars.</span>

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p2"></span>1.  This reflection has befallen me at
this time concerning the shaking that is to take place at this time, and
the host that has assembled itself for the sword.  The times were
disposed beforehand by God.  The times of peace are fulfilled in the
days of the good and just; and the times of many evils are fulfilled in
the days of the evil and transgressors.  For it is thus written:—*Good
must happen and blessed is he through whom it shall come to pass; and
evil must happen, but woe to him through whom it shall come to
pass*. <span id="fr_728"></span>[729](#fn_728.md)  Good has come to the
people of God, and blessedness awaits that man through whom the good
came.  And evil is stirred up as regards the host that is gathered
together by means of the evil and arrogant one who glories; and woe also
is there reserved for him through whom the evil is stirred up.  But do
not, my beloved, reproach the evil person who has inflicted evil upon
many; because the times were beforehand disposed and the time of their
accomplishment has arrived.

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p4"></span>2.  Therefore because it is the time of
the Evil One, hear in mystery that which I am writing for thee.  For
thus it is written:—*Whatsoever is exalted amongst men is despicable
before God*. <span id="fr_729"></span>[730](#fn_729.md)   And again it is
written:—*Everyone who exalteth himself shall be abased, and everyone
who humbleth himself shall be exalted*. <span
id="fr_730"></span>[731](#fn_730.md)   Also Jeremiah said:—*Let not the
mighty glory in his might, nor the rich in his riches*. <span
id="fr_731"></span>[732](#fn_731.md)   And again the blessed Apostle
said:—*Whosoever glorieth, let him glory in the Lord*. <span
id="fr_732"></span>[733](#fn_732.md)   And David said:—*I saw the wicked
exalted and lifted up as the cedar of Lebanon; and when I passed by he
was not, and I sought him and found him not.* <span
id="fr_733"></span>[734](#fn_733.md)

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p10"></span>3.  For every one that glories shall be
humbled.  Cain gloried over Abel his brother and slew him.  And he was
cursed and became a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth.  Again the
Sodomites gloried over Lot, and there fell upon them fire from heaven
and burned them up and their city was overthrown upon them.  And Esau
<span id="page_353">p. 353</span> <span
id="iii.ix.iv-Page_353"></span>gloried over Jacob and persecuted him,
and Jacob received the birthright and blessings of Esau.  And the
children of Jacob gloried over Joseph, and (afterwards) fell down and
worshipped him in Egypt.  And Pharaoh gloried over Moses and over his
people; and Pharaoh and his host were drowned in the sea.  And Dathan
and Abiram gloried over Moses, and they went down alive to Sheol.  And
Goliath threatened David, and he fell before him and was crushed.  And
again Saul persecuted David, and he fell by the sword of the
Philistines.  And Absalom exalted himself against him, and Joab slew him
in the battle.  Again Benhadad gloried over Ahab, and he was delivered
into the hand of Israel.  And Sennacherib blasphemed against Hezekiah
and his God, and his host became dead carcases when one of the Watchers
went forth and slew in the camp one hundred and eighty-five thousand at
the prayer of Hezekiah and at the prayer of Prophet Isaiah, most
glorious of the Prophets.  Ahab exalted himself over Micah, and he went
up and fell in Ramoth Gilead.  Jezebel gloried over Elijah, and the dogs
devoured her in the portion of Jezreel.  Haman gloried over Mordecai,
and his iniquity turned back upon his own head.  The Babylonians gloried
over Daniel and cast him into the den of lions, and Daniel came up
victorious, and they were cast instead of him into the den.  Again the
Babylonians gloried and accused Hananiah and his companions, and they
were cast into the furnace of fire; and they came up victorious and the
flame devoured the accusers.

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p11"></span>4.  Now Nebuchadnezzar said:—*I will
ascend to heaven and exalt my throne above the stars of God and sit in
the lofty mountains that are in the borders of the North*. <span
id="fr_734"></span>[735](#fn_734.md)   Isaiah said concerning him:—*Because
thy heart has thus exalted thee, therefore thou shalt be brought down to
Sheol, and all that look upon thee shall be astonished at thee.* <span
id="fr_735"></span>[736](#fn_735.md)  And Sennacherib also said thus:—*I
will go up to the summit of the mountains and to the shoulders of
Lebanon.* <span id="fr_736"></span>[737](#fn_736.md) *  I will dig and
drink water and will dry up with my horses’ hoofs all the deep rivers. *
And because he thus exalted himself, Isaiah again said concerning
him:—*Why does the axe boast itself against him that cutteth with it, or
the saw exalt itself against him that saweth with it, or the rod lift
itself up against him that wieldeth it?* <span
id="fr_737"></span>[738](#fn_737.md) * *For thou, Sennacherib, art the axe
in the hands of Him that cuts, and thou art the saw in the hands of Him
that saws, and the rod in the hand of Him that wields thee for
chastisement, and thou art the staff for smiting.  Thou art sent against
the fickle people, and again thou art ordained against the stubborn
people, that thou mayest carry away the captivity and take the spoil;
and thou hast made them as the mire of the streets for all men and for
all the Gentiles.  And when thou hast done all these things, why art
thou exalted against Him Who holds thee, and why dost thou boast against
Him Who saws with thee, and why hast thou reviled the holy city? and
hast said to the children of Jerusalem:—*Can your God deliver you from
my hand?* <span id="fr_738"></span>[739](#fn_738.md)   And thou hast dared
to say:—*Who is the Lord that He shall deliver you from my hands?* 
Because of this, hear the word of the Lord, saying:—*I will crush the
Assyrian in My land, and on My mountains will I tread him down.* <span
id="fr_739"></span>[740](#fn_739.md) * *And when he shall have been crushed
and trodden down, *the Virgin, the daughter of Zion, will despise him,
and the daughter of Jerusalem will shake her head and say*:—*Whom hast
thou reviled and blasphemed, and against whom hast thou lifted up thy
voice?  Thou hast lifted up thine eyes towards heaven against the Holy
One of Israel, and by the hands of thy messengers thou hast reviled the
Lord.  Now see that the hook has been forced into thy nostrils, and the
bridle into thy lips, and thou hast turned back with thine heart
crushed, who camest with thine heart uplifted*. <span
id="fr_740"></span>[741](#fn_740.md)   And his slaying was by the hands of
his loved ones; and in the house of his confidence, <span
id="fr_741"></span>[742](#fn_741.md) there was he over<span
id="page_354">p. 354</span> <span id="iii.ix.iv-Page_354"></span>thrown,
and fell before his god.  And truly it was right, my beloved, that his
body should thus become a sacrifice and offering before that god on whom
he relied, and in his temple, as a memorial for his idol.

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p20"></span>5.  Again the ram was lifted up and
exalted, and pushed with its horns towards the west, and towards the
north, and towards the south, and humbled many beasts.  And they could
not stand before him, until the he-goat came from the west and smote the
ram and broke his horns and humbled the ram completely.  But the ram was
the King of Media and Persia, that is, Darius; and the he-goat was
Alexander, the son of Philip, the Macedonian.  For Daniel saw the ram
when he was *in the East before the gate of Shushan the fortress that is
in the province of Elam, upon the river Ulai.  And he was pushing
towards the West and towards the North and towards the South.  And none
of the beasts could stand before him*. <span
id="fr_742"></span>[743](#fn_742.md)   And the he-goat of the goats came up
from the region of the Greeks, and exalted himself against the ram.  And
he smote him and broke both his horns, the greater and the lesser.  And
why did he say that he broke both his horns?  Clearly because he humbled
both the kingdoms which he ruled; the lesser, that of the Medes, and the
greater, that of the Persians.  But when Alexander the Greek came, he
slew Darius, King of Media and Persia.  For thus the angel said to
Daniel, when he was explaining the vision to him:—*The ram that thou
sawest was the King of Media and Persia, and the he-goat the King of the
Greeks*. <span id="fr_743"></span>[744](#fn_743.md)   Now, from the time
that the two horns of the ram were broken, until this time, there have
been six hundred and forty-eight years. <span
id="fr_744"></span>[745](#fn_744.md)

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p24"></span>6.  Therefore, as for the ram, its horns
are broken.  And though its horns are broken, lo! it exalts and uplifts
itself against the fourth beast, that is *strong and mighty and its
teeth of iron and its hoofs of brass, and it shall devour and grind
down, and trample with its feet whatsoever remaineth*. <span
id="fr_745"></span>[746](#fn_745.md)   O Ram, whose horns are broken, rest
thou from the beast, and provoke it not lest it devour thee and grind
thee to powder.  The ram could not stand before the he-goat; how shall
it stand before that terrible beast, *whose mouth speaketh great
things*, <span id="fr_746"></span>[747](#fn_746.md) and whatsoever it finds
it couches over as a lion over his prey?  Whoever provokes the lion
becomes its portion; and whoever stirs up that beast, it shall devour
him.  And who is there that shall escape out from under the feet of that
beast when it is trampling on him?  For the beast shall not be slain
until the Ancient of Days shall sit upon the throne, and the Son of Man
shall come near before Him, and authority shall be given to Him. <span
id="fr_747"></span>[748](#fn_747.md)   Then shall that beast be slain and
its carcase shall perish.  And the Kingdom of the Son of Man shall be
established, an eternal Kingdom, and His authority from generation to
generation.

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p28"></span>7.  Be quiet, O thou that dost exalt
thyself; vaunt not thyself!  For if thy wealth has lifted up thy heart,
it is not more abundant than that of Hezekiah, who went in and boasted
of it before the Babylonians, (yet) it was all of it carried away and
went to Babylon.  And if thou gloriest in thy children, they shall be
led away from thee to the Beast, as the children of King Hezekiah were
led away, and became eunuchs in the palace of the King of Babylon. <span
id="fr_748"></span>[749](#fn_748.md)   And if thou dost glory in thy
wisdom, thou dost not in it excel the Prince of Tyre, whom Ezekiel
reproached, saying unto him:—*Art thou wiser than Daniel, or hast thou
seen by thy wisdom the things that are hid*? <span
id="fr_749"></span>[750](#fn_749.md)   And if thy mind is puffed up by thy
years, that they are many; they are not more in number than those of the
Prince of Tyre who ruled the Kingdom during the days of twenty-two Kings
of the house of Judah, that is, for four hundred and forty years.  <span
id="page_355">p. 355</span> <span id="iii.ix.iv-Page_355"></span>And
since the years of that King of Tyre were many, all the time he thus
said in his heart, *I am God and sit in the seat of God in the heart of
the seas*. <span id="fr_750"></span>[751](#fn_750.md)   But Ezekiel said to
him:  *Thou art a man and thou art not God*.  For while the Prince of
Tyre was *walking without fault in the midst of the stones of fire*,
there was mercy upon him.  But when his heart was lifted up, *the cherub
who overshadoweth, destroyed him*. <span
id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751.md)

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p33"></span>8.  Now, what are the *stones of fire*,
but the children of Zion and the children of Jerusalem?  For in the
ancient time, in the days of David and of Solomon his son, Hiram was a
friend to those of the house of Israel.  But when they were carried away
captive from their place, he rejoiced over them and spurned them with
his feet, and did not remember the friendship of the house of David. 
And as to that which I said that the children of Judah were called the
*stones of fire*, it was not of my own thought that I said it, but
Jeremiah the Prophet spake concerning them; for when he was calling
forth tears for them in the Lamentations, he said:—*The children of Zion
were more excellent than precious stones*. <span
id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752.md)   And again he said:—*How are the
stones of the Sanctuary cast down at the head of all the streets*? <span
id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753.md)   And again He said by the
Prophet:—*The stones were holy that were cast down in his land*. <span
id="fr_754"></span>[755](#fn_754.md)   And as to these very stones, the
fire was burning in them, as Jeremiah said:—*The word of the Lord became
in my heart like burning fire and it was hot in my bones.* <span
id="fr_755"></span>[756](#fn_755.md) * *And again He said to Jeremiah:—*Lo!
I give My word in thy mouth as fire, and this people shall be as
wood*. <span id="fr_756"></span>[757](#fn_756.md)   And again He said words
shall go forth as fire, and as iron that cutteth the stone. <span
id="fr_757"></span>[758](#fn_757.md)   On this account the Prophets,
amongst whom Hiram the Prince of Tyre was walking, were called *stones
of fire.*

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p40"></span>9.  And again (God) said to him:—*Thou
wast with the Cherub who was anointed and overshadowing*. <span
id="fr_758"></span>[759](#fn_758.md)   For the king, who was anointed with
the holy oil, was called a Cherub.  And he was overshadowing all his
people, as Jeremiah said:—*The anointed of the Lord is the breath of our
nostrils, he of whom we said that in his shadow shall we live amongst
the Gentiles*. <span id="fr_759"></span>[760](#fn_759.md)   For they were
sitting in the shadow of the king, while he was standing at their head. 
And when the crown of their head fell, they were without shade.  And if
any one should say that this word is spoken concerning Christ, let him
receive that which I write for him without disputation, and thus he will
be persuaded that it was said with reference to the king.  For Jeremiah
said in behalf of the people:—*Woe unto us, for the crown of our head
has fallen*! <span id="fr_760"></span>[761](#fn_760.md)   But Christ has
not fallen, because He rose again the third day.  For the king fell from
the house of Judah, and never again was their kingdom set up.  And as
for that He said again:—*I will destroy the overshadowing Cherub*. <span
id="fr_761"></span>[762](#fn_761.md)   For the Cherub that He will destroy
is Nebuchadnezzar, as it is written:—*He performed a work in Tyre, and
there was given him by Tyre no hire for his host, and in return for the
work of Tyre there was given him the land of Egypt*. <span
id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762.md)   And why was hire not given by Tyre
to Nebuchadnezzar?  Clearly because its wealth went away in the sea, so
that Nebuchadnezzar did not receive it.  And at that time He destroyed
*the overshadowing Cherub*, which is Nebuchadnezzar.  For there are two
Cherubs, one anointed and overshadowing, and one overshadowing but not
anointed.  For He said above:—*Thou wast with the Cherub anointed and
overshadowing*. <span id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763.md)   And lower down
He said:—*I will destroy thee the overshadowing Cherub*; <span
id="fr_764"></span>[765](#fn_764.md) and did not say “anointed.”  For
Nebuchadnezzar was not anointed; but David and Solomon were, and the
other kings who arose after them.  And how was Nebuchadnezzar called
*overshadowing?*  Clearly on <span id="page_356">p. 356</span> <span
id="iii.ix.iv-Page_356"></span>account of the vision of the tree, when
he saw a tree in the midst of the earth, beneath which dwelt all the
beasts of the wilderness and on its branches dwelt all the birds of
heaven, and from it all flesh was fed.  When Daniel interpreted his
dream to him, Daniel said to him:—*Thou art the tree, that tree which
thou sawest in the midst of the earth and beneath thee dwell all the
nations*. <span id="fr_765"></span>[766](#fn_765.md)   On this account he
was *the overshadowing Cherub;* who destroyed the Prince of Tyre,
because he rejoiced over the children of Israel, for that they were
carried away captive from their land, and because his heart was
exalted.  This Tyre also lay waste seventy years like Jerusalem which
sat in desolation seventy years.  For Isaiah said concerning it:—*Tyre
shall wander seventy years, as the days of one king, and shall commit
fornication with all the kingdoms that are upon the face of the
earth.* <span id="fr_766"></span>[767](#fn_766.md)

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p50"></span>10.  O thou that art exalted and lifted
up, let not the vaunting of thine heart mislead thee, nor say thou, I
will go up against the rich land and against the powerful beast.  For
that beast will not be slain by the ram seeing that its horns are
broken.  For the he-goat broke the horns of the ram. <span
id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767.md)   Now the he-goat has become the
mighty beast.  For when the children of Japhet held the kingdom, then
they slew Darius, the king of Persia.  Now the fourth beast has
swallowed up the third.  And this third consists of the children of
Japhet, and the fourth consists of the children of Shem, for they are
the children of Esau.  Because, when Daniel saw the vision of the four
beasts, he saw first the children of Ham, the seed of Nimrod, which the
Babylonians are; and secondly, the Persians and Medes, who are the
children of Japhet; and thirdly, the Greeks, the brethren of the Medes;
and fourthly, the children of Shem, which the children of Esau are.  For
a confederacy was formed between the children of Japhet and the children
of Shem.  Then the government was taken away from the children of
Japhet, the younger, and was given to Shem, the elder; and to this day
it continues, and will continue for ever.  But when the time of the
consummation of the dominion of the children of Shem shall have come,
the Ruler, who came forth from the children of Judah, shall receive the
kingdom, when He shall come in His second Advent.

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p52"></span>11.  For in the vision of
Nebuchadnezzar, when he saw it, which Daniel made known and showed to
Nebuchadnezzar, when he saw the image which stood over against him, *the
head of the image was of gold, and its breast and arms of silver, and
its belly and thighs of brass, and its legs and feet of iron and
potter’s clay*. <span id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768.md)   And Daniel
said to Nebuchadnezzar:—*Thou art the head of gold*. <span
id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769.md)   And why was he called the head of
gold?  Was it not because the word of Jeremiah was fulfilled in him? 
For Jeremiah said:—*Babylon is a golden cup in the hand of the Lord,
that makes all the earth to drink of its wine*. <span
id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770.md)   And also Babylon was called the head
of all the kingdoms, as it is written:—*Babylon was the head of the of
Nimrod.* <span id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771.md)

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p57"></span>12.  And he said that *the breast and
the arms of the image were of silver.*  This signified concerning a
kingdom which was inferior to it; namely, Darius the Mede.  For (God)
put the kingdom into the balance.  For the kingdom of the house of
Nimrod was weighed and was found wanting.  And since it was wanting,
Darius received it.  Because of this he said that *his kingdom was
inferior.* <span id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772.md) * *And because it was
inferior, the children of Media did not rule in all the earth.  Now *the
belly and thighs of the image were of brass*, and he said:—*The third
kingdom shall rule in all the earth*. <span
id="fr_773"></span>[774](#fn_773.md)   It is the kingdom of the children of
Javan, who are children of Japhet.  For the children of Javan came in
against the kingdom of their brethren.  For Madai and Javan are sons of
Japhet. <span id="fr_774"></span>[775](#fn_774.md)   But Madai was foolish
and incapable of gov<span id="page_357">p. 357</span> <span
id="iii.ix.iv-Page_357"></span>erning the kingdom, until Javan, his
brother came, who was wise and cunning, to destroy the kingdom.  For
Alexander, son of Philip, ruled in all the earth.

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p61"></span>13.  And *the legs and feet of the image
were of iron.*  This is the kingdom of the children of Shem, who are the
children of Esau, which is strong as iron.  And he said:—*As iron breaks
and subdueth everything, so also the fourth kingdom shall break and
bruise everything*. <span id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775.md)   And he
explained with reference to the feet and toes, that part of them was of
iron and part of them of potter’s clay.  For he said:—*Thus they shall
be mingled with the seed of man, and they shall not cleave one to
another, as iron cannot be mixed with clay*. <span
id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776.md)   This referred to the fourth
kingdom.  Because in the kingdom of the children of Esau <span
id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777.md) there was not a king, the son of a
king, established to govern the kingdom; but when the children of Esau
were gathered together into a powerful city, then they made a senate. 
And from thence they used to set up as chief of the city a wise man to
govern the kingdom, lest when the Governor of their kingdom should weigh
them, they might be found wanting, and the kingdom might be taken away
from them as the kingdom of the children of arrogant Nimrod was taken
away and given to the children of foolish Madai.  And this king who was
set up, the seed of that former king was destroying him; and they did
not cleave one to another.  But as to the seed of man which is compared
with the clay, the meaning is this; that when the king was chosen for
the kingdom, he mingled himself with the root of the kingdom of iron.

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p65"></span>14.  And he showed that *in the days of
those kings, who shall arise in the kingdom, the God of heaven will set
up a kingdom which shall not be destroyed and shall not pass away for
ever*. <span id="fr_778"></span>[779](#fn_778.md)   This is the Kingdom of
King Messiah, which is that which shall cause the fourth kingdom to pass
away.  And above he said:—*Thou sawest a stone which was cut out, but
not by hands; and it smote the image upon its feet of iron and potter’s
clay and broke them to pieces*. <span id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779.md)
  Now he did not say that it smote upon the head of the image, nor on
its breast and arms, nor yet on its belly and thighs, but on its feet;
because that, of the whole image, that stone when it comes will find the
feet alone.  And in the next verse he said:—*The iron and the brass and
the silver and the gold were broken to pieces together*. <span
id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780.md)   For after them, when King Messiah
shall reign, then He will humble the fourth kingdom, and will break the
whole image; for by the whole image the world is meant.  Its head is
Nebuchadnezzar; its breast and arms the King of Media and Persia; its
belly and thighs the King of the Greeks; its legs and feet the kingdom
of the children of Esau; the stone, which smote the image and brake it,
and with which the whole earth was filled, is the kingdom of King
Messiah, Who will bring to nought the kingdom of this world, and He will
rule for ever and ever.

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p69"></span>15.  Again hear concerning the vision of
the four beasts which Daniel saw coming up out of the sea and diverse
one from another.  This is the appearance of them:—*The first was like a
lion, and it had the wings of an eagle.  And I saw that its wings were
plucked away, and it stood up like a man upon its feet, and the heart of
a man was given to it.* <span id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781.md)   And
the second beast was like a bear, and *it raised itself up upon one side
and there were three ribs in its mouth between its teeth.*  And the
third beast was *like a leopard, and it had four wings and four heads.* 
And the fourth beast was *exceedingly terrible and strong and powerful,
and it had great teeth.  It devoured and brake to pieces, and whatsoever
remained, it stamped with its feet.*  Now the great sea that Daniel
saw <span id="fr_782"></span>[783](#fn_782.md) is the world:  and these
four beasts are the four kingdoms signified above.

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p72"></span>16.  Now as to the first beast, he said
concerning it, that it was like a lion, and it had the wings of an
eagle.  For the first <span id="page_358">p. 358</span> <span
id="iii.ix.iv-Page_358"></span>beast was the kingdom of Babylon, which
was like a lion.  For thus Jeremiah wrote saying:—*Israel is a wandering
sheep.  The lions caused them to wander.  First the king of Assyria
devoured him.  And this last was stronger than he, Nebuchadnezzar king
of Babylon*. <span id="fr_783"></span>[784](#fn_783.md)   So Jeremiah
called him a lion.  And he said:—*He has the wings of an eagle*.  For
thus it is written that, when Nebuchadnezzar went out to the wilderness
with the beasts, he grew hair like (the plumage) of an eagle.  And he
said:—*I saw that its wings were plucked away and it stood upright upon
its feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to it*. <span
id="fr_784"></span>[785](#fn_784.md)   For first, in the vision of the
image, he was compared to gold which is more precious than anything
which is used in the world.  So in the vision of the beasts he is
compared to a lion which excels in its might all the beasts.  And again
he was compared to an eagle which surpasses every bird.  Whatsoever was
written about him was fulfilled in him.  For the Lord said concerning
him:—*I have placed a yoke of iron upon the neck of all the nations, and
they shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.  And also the beasts
of the desert and the birds of heaven have I given to him to serve
him*. <span id="fr_785"></span>[786](#fn_785.md)   For since the king was
like the head of gold, men served him as a king.  And when he went out
to the wilderness, the beasts served him as a lion.  And when his hair
was like (the plumage) of an eagle, the birds of heaven served him as an
eagle.  But when his heart was lifted up, and he knew not that the power
was given to him from heaven, the yoke of iron was broken from the neck
of men, and he went forth with the beasts, and instead of the heart of a
king there was given him the heart of a lion.  And when he was lifted up
over the beasts, the heart of a lion was taken away from him, and there
was given him the heart of a bird.  And when wings grew upon him like
those of an eagle, he exalted himself over the birds.  And then his
wings also were plucked away and there was given to him a humble heart. 
And when he knew that the Most High has authority in the kingdom of man,
to give it to whomsoever He will, then as a man he praised Him.

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p76"></span>17.  And as for the second beast, he
said concerning him that *it was like a bear and raised itself up upon
one side.*  Because when the kingdom of Media and Persia arose, it arose
in the east.  *And three ribs were in its mouth.*  Because the ram was
pushing towards the West and towards the North and towards the South,
towards three winds of heaven.  These three winds it held, and pushed
against, like the three ribs that were in the mouth of the bear; until
the he-goat came forth from the west, and smote the ram and took out the
ribs that were in his mouth.

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p77"></span>18.  And concerning the third beast he
said that it was like a leopard, and it had four birds’ wings on its
back and that beast had four heads.  Now this third beast was Alexander
the Macedonian.  For he was strong as a leopard.  And as for the four
wings and the four heads that the beast had, that was because he gave
the kingdom to his four friends to govern after him, when he had come
and slain Darius and reigned in his stead.

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p78"></span>19.  And of the fourth beast he said
that it was exceedingly terrible and strong and mighty, devouring and
crushing and trampling with its feet anything that remained.  It is the
kingdom of the children of Esau. <span id="fr_786"></span>[787](#fn_786.md)
  Because after that Alexander the Macedonian became king, the kingdom
of the Greeks was founded, since Alexander also was one of them, even of
the Greeks.  But the vision of the third beast was fulfilled in him,
since the third and the fourth were one.  Now Alexander reigned for
twelve years.  And the kings of the Greeks arose after Alexander, being
seventeen kings, and their years were two hundred and sixty-nine years
from Seleucus Nicanor to Ptolemy.  And the Cæsars were from Augustus to
Philip Cæsar, seventeen kings.  And their <span id="page_359">p.
359</span> <span id="iii.ix.iv-Page_359"></span>years are two hundred
and ninety-three years; <span id="fr_787"></span>[788](#fn_787.md) and
eighteen years of Severus.

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p81"></span>20.  For Daniel said:—*I was considering
the ten horns that were upon the head of the beast.  For the ten horns
were ten kings* <span id="fr_788"></span>[789](#fn_788.md) who arose at
that time until Antiochus.  And he said:—*A little horn arose from
between those ten and three fell before it*. <span
id="fr_789"></span>[790](#fn_789.md)   For when Antiochus arose in the
kingdom, he humbled three kings, and he exalted himself against the
saints of the Most High and against Jerusalem.  And he defiled the
sanctuary. <span id="fr_790"></span>[791](#fn_790.md)   And he caused the
sacrifice and the offerings to cease for a week and half a week, namely,
for ten and a-half years.  And he brought in fornicators into the house
of the Lord, and he caused the observances of the Law to cease. <span
id="fr_791"></span>[792](#fn_791.md)   And he slew righteous men and gave
them to the birds of heaven and to the beasts of the earth.  For in his
days was fulfilled the word that David spoke: <span
id="fr_792"></span>[793](#fn_792.md) —*O God, the Gentiles have come into
thine inheritance, and have defiled Thy holy temple.  They have made
Jerusalem desolate.  They have given the dead bodies of Thy servants as
food to the birds of heaven, and the flesh of Thy righteous ones to the
beasts of the earth.  They have poured out their blood like water round
about Jerusalem, and there is none to bury them.*  For this was
accomplished at that time, when the venerable and aged Eleazar was
slain, and the sons of the blessed Samuna, seven in number, <span
id="fr_793"></span>[794](#fn_793) and when Judas (Maccabeus.md) and his
brethren were struggling on behalf of their people, when they were
dwelling in hiding-places. <span id="fr_794"></span>[795](#fn_794.md)   At
that time *the horn made war with the saints*, <span
id="fr_795"></span>[796](#fn_795.md) and their power prevailed.  And the
wicked Antiochus *spake words against the Most High, and changed the
times and the seasons.* <span id="fr_796"></span>[797](#fn_796.md)   And he
made to cease the covenant of Abraham, and abolished the Sabbath of
rest. <span id="fr_797"></span>[798](#fn_797.md)   For he commanded the
Jews that they should not circumcise.  Therefore, (the Prophet) said
concerning him;—*He shall think to change the times and the seasons and
the laws, and they were given into his hand for a time, times, and half
a time.* <span id="fr_798"></span>[799](#fn_798.md)   Now the time and half
a time is the week and a half, which is ten years and a half.  Again he
said:—*The judgment was set and they took away his authority from him,
to injure and destroy him until the end of the kingdom*. <span
id="fr_799"></span>[800](#fn_799.md)   For the judgment came upon
Antiochus, a judgment from heaven; <span
id="fr_800"></span>[801](#fn_800.md) and he became sick with a grievous and
evil sickness, and on account of the smell of him as he rotted, no man
could approach him, for worms were crawling and falling from him and
eating his flesh because he oppressed the *worm Jacob*. <span
id="fr_801"></span>[802](#fn_801.md)   And his flesh rotted in his
lifetime, because he caused the dead bodies of the sons of Jerusalem to
rot and they were not buried.  And he became defiled in his own eyes,
because he had defiled the sanctuary of God.  And he prayed and was not
heard, <span id="fr_802"></span>[803](#fn_802.md) because he did not
hearken to the groanings of the righteous whom he slew.  For he wrote a
letter and sent it to the Jews and called them “my friends,” but God had
not mercy on him, but he died in his torment.

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p97"></span>21.  He said again:—*The saints of the
Most High shall receive the Kingdom*. <span
id="fr_803"></span>[804](#fn_803.md)   What shall we say concerning this? 
Have the children of Israel received the Kingdom of the Most High?  God
forbid.  Or has that people come upon the clouds of heaven?  This has
passed away from them.  For Jeremiah said concerning them:—*Call them
rejected silver, for the Lord has rejected them*. <span
id="fr_804"></span>[805](#fn_804.md)   Again he said:—*He will not again
regard them*. <span id="fr_805"></span>[806](#fn_805.md)   And Isaiah said
concerning them:—*Pass by; pass by; approach not the defiled*. <span
id="fr_806"></span>[807](#fn_806.md)   And concerning the saints of the
Most High (Daniel) said thus:—*They shall inherit* <span
id="page_360">p. 360</span> <span id="iii.ix.iv-Page_360"></span>*the
Kingdom for ever*. <span id="fr_807"></span>[808](#fn_807.md)   For these
*rested a little from the burden of kings and princes*, <span
id="fr_808"></span>[809](#fn_808.md) namely, from after the death of
Antiochus till the sixty-two weeks were fulfilled.  And the Son of Man
came to free them and gather them together, but they did not receive
Him.  For He came to obtain fruit from them, and they did not give it to
Him.  For their vines were *of the vine of Sodom and of the stock of
Gomorrha, a vineyard* <span id="fr_809"></span>[810](#fn_809.md) in which
thorns grew, and which *bore wild grapes*. <span
id="fr_810"></span>[811](#fn_810.md)   Their vine was bitter, and their
fruit sour.  The thorns could not be softened, nor could the bitterness
change to the nature of wine, nor could the sour fruit change to a sweet
nature.

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p106"></span>22.  For Isaiah first set men of Judah
as judges over them, <span id="fr_811"></span>[812](#fn_811.md) and there
was planted amongst them a new and beloved planting.  But these are
those judges *who shall sit on twelve thrones and judge their twelve
tribes*. <span id="fr_812"></span>[813](#fn_812.md)   And thus He said to
the judges: <span id="fr_813"></span>[814](#fn_813.md) —*Judge between Me
and My vineyard, what further, O ye judges, should I have done to My
vineyard, that I did not do?  For lo! I planted it with vine scions*,
and they became strange vines.  *I surrounded it with a fence* of
heavenly Watchers *and I built its tower*, the holy Temple.  *And I dug
out its winepress*, the baptism of the priests.  And I brought down rain
upon it, the words of My Prophets.  And I pruned it and trimmed it, from
the works of the Amorites.  *I looked that it should produce grapes* of
righteousness, *and it produced wild grapes* of iniquity and sin.  *I
looked for judgment and behold oppression, and for righteousness and
there was a cry.  Hear, O ye judges, what I will do to My vineyard.  I
will break open its fence, and it shall be for down-treading.  And I
will tear down its tower, and it shall be for pillage.  And I will make
it to become a desert because it produced wild grapes.  And it shall not
be dressed and it shall not be pruned.  And thorns and weeds shall grow
up in it.  And I will command the clouds that they send not down rain
upon it.*  For the heavenly Watchers departed from the fence of the
vineyard; and the mighty tower on which they relied was torn down.  The
winepress, the cleansing away of their offences, was overthrown.  *When
the vine was without blemish, it did not prove of service.  Now that the
fire has devoured it and that it is laid waste, how shall it prove of
service?  The fire has devoured its two branches and its inward parts
are wasted*. <span id="fr_814"></span>[815](#fn_814.md)   For its two
branches are the two kingdoms, and its inward part which is laid waste
is Jerusalem.  Many servants were sent to them by the Lord of the
vineyard. <span id="fr_815"></span>[816](#fn_815.md)   And they slew them
and did not send the fruit to the Lord of the vineyard.  After the
servants the beloved Son was sent, to receive from them the fruit and to
bring it back to Him that sent Him.  And they seized Him and cast Him
out of the vineyard; and they cut spikes from the thorns of the vineyard
and fixed them in His hands.  And He was hungry and asked food of them;
and they took and gave Him gall from the fruit of the vineyard.  He was
thirsty and asked of them drink; and they gave Him vinegar and He would
not drink it.  And they platted a crown of thorns that had sprung up in
the vineyard, and placed it on the head of the Son of the Lord of the
vineyard.  For from the time that the vineyard was made, it displayed
these fruits.  Therefore its Lord uprooted it and cast it in the fire;
and planted good fruit-bearing vines in the vineyard, and such as
gladden the husbandman.  For Christ is the vineyard, and His Father is
the husbandman; and they who drink of His cup are the vines.  Therefore
vineyard was formed instead of vineyard.  And furthermore at His coming
He handed over the kingdom to the Romans, as the children of Esau are
called.  And these children of Esau will keep the kingdom for its giver.

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p112"></span>23.  And the holy People inherited an
eternal Kingdom; the holy people who were <span id="page_361">p.
361</span> <span id="iii.ix.iv-Page_361"></span>chosen instead of the
People.  For *He provoked them to jealousy with a people that was not a
people.  And with a foolish people He angered them*. <span
id="fr_816"></span>[817](#fn_816.md)   And He set free the holy people. 
For lo! every covenant of God is *freed from the burden of kings and
princes*. <span id="fr_817"></span>[818](#fn_817.md)   For even if a man
has served the heathen, as soon as ever he draws nigh unto the covenant
of God, he is set free.  But the Jews are toiling in bondage amongst the
Gentiles.  For thus he said about the Saints;—*They shall inherit the
Kingdom that is beneath the heaven*. <span
id="fr_818"></span>[819](#fn_818.md)   But if he had said it about them
(the Jews), why are they toiling in service amongst the Gentiles?  And
if they say that it has not taken place as yet; then (we ask) is the
Kingdom that shall be given to the Son of man, to be heavenly or
earthly?  And lo! the children of the Kingdom are sealed, and they have
received their emancipation from this world.  For since it exists now,
it will not be willing to be subjected to the power of the King, Who
shall come and take to Himself His Kingdom.  But it will guard His
pledges with honour, that when He shall come to bring to nought the
Kingdom, he may come upon them not in anger.  For when He, *Whose is the
Kingdom*, <span id="fr_819"></span>[820](#fn_819.md) shall come in His
second coming, He will take to Himself whatever He has given.  And He
Himself will be King for ever and ever.  And His Kingdom shall not pass
away, because it is an eternal Kingdom.

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p117"></span>24.  For first, He gave the Kingdom to
the sons of Jacob, and subdued to them the children of Esau; as Isaac
said to Esau:—*Thou shalt serve Jacob thy brother*. <span
id="fr_820"></span>[821](#fn_820.md)   And when again they did not prosper
in the Kingdom, He took it away from the children of Jacob and gave it
to the children of Esau *until He should come Whose it is*. <span
id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821.md)   And they will deliver up the deposit
to its Giver, and will not deal fraudulently with it.  And the Guardian
of the Kingdom is subject to Him to Whom all things are subject. 
Therefore this Kingdom of the children of Esau shall not be delivered up
into the hand of the hosts that are gathered together, that desire to go
up against it; because the Kingdom is being kept safe for its Giver, and
He Himself will preserve it.  And as to this that I wrote to thee,
beloved, that the Kingdom of the children of Esau is being kept safe for
its Giver, doubt not about it, that that Kingdom will not be conquered. 
For a mighty champion Whose name is Jesus shall come with power, and
bearing as His armour all the power of the Kingdom.  And search out and
see that also by the poll-tax <span id="fr_822"></span>[823](#fn_822.md) He
was enrolled amongst them.  And as He was enrolled by the poll-tax
amongst them, He will also succour them.  And His standard abounds in
that place, and they are clothed in His armour, and shall not be found
wanting in war.  And if thou shouldest say unto me:—“In the years of the
Kings that preceded these, why did they conquer and subdue the beast?” 
It was because the chiefs and kings who stood up at that time in the
Kingdom of the children of Esau did not wish to lead with them to the
war the Man who was enrolled with them in the poll-tax.  Therefore the
beast was subdued a little, but was not slain.

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p121"></span>25.  But concerning these things that I
have written for thee, my beloved, namely, concerning that which is
written in Daniel, I have not brought them to an end, but (have stopped)
short of the end.  And if any man dispute about them, say thus to him,
that these words are not concluded, because the words of God are
infinite, nor will they be concluded.  For the foolish man says, “Here
unto (these) words reach.”  And again, it is not possible to add to them
or to diminish from them. <span id="fr_823"></span>[824](#fn_823.md)   For
the riches of God cannot be computed or limited.  For if thou take away
water from the sea, the deficiency will be imperceptible.  And if thou
remove sand from the sea-shore, its measure will not be diminished.  And
if thou count the stars of heaven, thou wilt not arrive at the sum of
them.  And if thou kindle fire from <span id="page_362">p. 362</span>
<span id="iii.ix.iv-Page_362"></span>a burning, it will not a whit be
lessened.  And if thou receive of the Spirit of Christ, Christ will not
a whit be diminished.  And if Christ dwell in thee, yet He will not be
completed in thee.  And if the sun enter the windows of thy house, yet
the sun in its entirety will not come to thee.  And all these things
that I have enumerated for thee were created by the word of God. 
Therefore know thou, that, as concerning the word of God no man has
reached or will reach its end.  Therefore, have thou no disputation
about these things, but say:—“These things are so.  That is enough.” 
But hear these things from me, and also enquire about them of our
brethren, children of our faith.  But whosoever shall mock at the words
of his brother, even if he say, “mine are wise,” yet hearken not to his
words.  And concerning what I wrote to thee about these forces that are
being stirred up to war, it is not as though anything has been revealed
to me that I have made known these things to thee, but attend to the
words at the head of the letter:—*Every one who exalteth himself shall
be humbled.*  For even if the forces shall go up and conquer, yet know
that it is a chastisement of God; and though they conquer, they shall be
condemned in a righteous judgment.  But yet be thou assured of this,
that the beast shall be slain at its (appointed) time.  But do thou, my
brother, at this time be earnest in imploring mercy, that there may be
peace upon the people of God.
