<span id="ii.vi.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.vi.v-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXIII.</span>

<span id="ii.vi.v-p2"></span>*To Adrian, Notary of Sicily* <span
id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md) .

<span id="ii.vi.v-p4"></span>Gregory to Adrian, &c.

<span id="ii.vi.v-p5"></span>A thing to us altogether detestable and
infamous has come to our ears, and we wonder why, if it is true, thou
hast not taken notice of it.  For Martianus, a monk of the monastery of
Saint Vitus, situate on Mount Ætna, has come to us, and presented a
petition, complaining among other things that the monks of this
monastery live so perversely and wickedly as to dare to have women
living with them, which is a thing atrocious to be spoken of.  And,
seeing that we have written on this matter to our brother and
fellow-bishop Leo <span id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) , in order
that, having enquired into the truth, he may, if he should find it to be
so, be at pains to correct it with the strictest severity, it is
necessary for thy Experience also to shew thyself in all respects
solicitous for investigation of the truth, and punishment of so great a
wickedness; so that nothing may be found to be done remissly or
negligently.  Further, for the interests in other respects of the same
monastery, lend thy assistance so far as equity may require, to the end
that if, as is said, there has been any invasion of it, it may be
redressed according to justice, and that for the future nothing
prejudicial may in any way arise there contrary to the fear of God and
the order of law.
