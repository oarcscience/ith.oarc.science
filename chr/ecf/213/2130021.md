id="ii.v.xv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XIX.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xv-p2"></span>*To the Husbandmen (Colonos) of the
Syracusan Patrimony* <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29) .

<span id="ii.v.xv-p4"></span>Gregory to the Coloni, &c.

<span id="ii.v.xv-p5"></span>I would have you know that we have arranged
for you to be put under the care of our guardian (*defensoris*).  And
accordingly we order you to obey him without any reluctance in what he
may see fit to do, and enjoin on you to be done, for the advantage of
the Church.  We have given him such power as to enable him to inflict
strict punishment on those who may attempt to be disobedient or
contumacious.  And we have likewise charged him that he delay not with
instant attention to recover to ecclesiastical jurisdiction any slaves
who are in hiding outside their limits, or any one by whom boundaries
have been invaded.  For know that he has been warned on his peril, that
he presume not ever under any kind of excuse to do any wrong or robbery
in regard to what belongs to others.
