id="ii.vii.x-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXV.</span>

<span id="ii.vii.x-p2"></span>*To Barbara and Antonina* <span
id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md) .

<span id="ii.vii.x-p4"></span>Gregory to Barbara, &c.

<span id="ii.vii.x-p5"></span>Having received your Glory’s letters,
which spoke with tears for words, we, most beloved daughters, are
affected by no less sorrow than yourselves for your father’s sickness. 
For we cannot account that sadness as extraneous which is made our own
by the law of charity.  But, since in no state of despair ought there to
be distrust in the mercy of our Redeemer, raise your spirits for the
comforting of your father, place your hope in the hand of Almighty God,
and by His protection we trust that He will guard you from all
adversity, and cheer your tribulation, and grant you to be favourably
disposed of according to your father’s desires.  But should He pay the
debt of our human lot, even then let not any despair crush you, nor the
words of any persons cause you alarm.  For after God, Who is the
governor and protector of orphans, we will be so solicitous in behalf of
your most sweet Glory, and will so make haste, with the Lord’s help, to
provide as we can for your advantage, that no rough handling of unjust
men may perturb you <span id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md) , and that
we may repay in all ways the debt we have contracted from the goodness
of your parents.  And so may heavenly grace nurture you with its favour
and defend you by its protection from all evils, that your safety may
become our joy.
