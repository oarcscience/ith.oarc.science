id="ii.vii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Epistle LVI.</span>

<span id="ii.vii.xxii-p2"></span>To Ætherius, Bishop of Lugdunum
(Lyons.)

<span id="ii.vii.xxii-p3"></span>Gregory to Ætherius, Bishop of Gaul.

<span id="ii.vii.xxii-p4"></span>The language of your epistles, full of
venerable gravity, has so engaged our heart’s affection that it would
please us to be ever mingling mutual discourse, to the end that, if we
cannot enjoy your bodily presence, absence may make no difference with
us while this intercourse goes on between us.  For how great love of
ecclesiastical order shines forth in you, and how great is your regard
for discipline, and how great your earnestness in the observance of
wholesome ordinances you shew in that you receive our exhortation
submissively and altogether willingly, and declare that you will
inviolably observe it.  Since then you bear a heart prompt for the
amendment of others, and condemn with a free voice, as becomes you, an
evil of old standing, and seeing that our other brethren and
fellow-bishops also are similarly disposed, it is your duty to rise
unanimously against the Lord’s enemies, and cast avarice out of the
house of God by a synodical definition.  In the giving of ecclesiastical
orders let not fierce hunger for gold find any satisfaction; let not
flatteries filch any advantage; let not favour confer anything:  let a
man’s life have the reward of honour, his modesty promote his
advancement; that, while this kind of ob<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>
<span id="ii.vii.xxii-Page_71"></span>servance obtains, both he that
seeks to rise by bribes may be judged unworthy, and he to whom his
conduct bears good testimony may be worthily honoured.  Let this be your
care, most beloved brother, let this anxiety ever keep guard over your
thoughts, so that you may prove by action that the zeal which you shew
in your letters is the witness of your heart.  Wherefore continually and
instantly press for the assembling of a synod; and so earnestly acquit
yourself as to act up to the dignity of your title in the administration
of your office.

<span id="ii.vii.xxii-p5"></span>With regard to what you request to have
granted to your Church on the ground of ancient custom, we have caused
search to be made in our archives, and nothing has been found. 
Wherefore send to us the letters which you say you have, that from them
we may gather what ought to be granted you.

<span id="ii.vii.xxii-p6"></span>As to the acts or writings of the
blessed Irenæus, we have now long been searching for them, but have not
succeeded so far in finding any of them.

<span id="ii.vii.xxii-p7"></span>Furthermore, let your Fraternity take
care to hold as in all respects commended to you the monks whom we
despatched to our brother and fellow-bishop Augustine, and for the sake
of God display your charity towards them; and so earnestly concur with
them in priestly zeal, and so hasten to help them with your succour for
proceeding on their journey, that, while there shall be no cause of
delay in your parts to detain them, both they may go on their way more
speedily, and you may find a reward for what you have done in their
behalf.  Given this 10th day of July, Indiction 4 <span
