<span id="ii.v.v-p2"></span>*To Marcellus, Pro-Consul of Dalmatia* <span
id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) .

<span id="ii.v.v-p4"></span>Gregory to Marcellus, &c.

<span id="ii.v.v-p5"></span>We have received the letter of your
Greatness, in which you speak of having incurred our displeasure, and of
your wish to be in favour with us through direct satisfaction.  And
indeed we have heard such things of your Greatness as ought never to
have been committed by a faithful man.  For all assert that you are the
author of all that great mischief in the case of Maximus, and that the
spoiling of that Church, and the perdition of so many souls, and the
audacity of that unheard-of presumption, had their beginning through
you.  And indeed, with regard to your seeking to be in favour with us,
it is fitting that with your whole heart and soul, and with tears, as
becomes you, you should satisfy our Redeemer for such things as these: 
for, unless satisfaction is made to Him, what certain good can our
forgiveness or favour do thee?  But while we observe thee to be still
implicated in the ruinous conduct of pretenders, or in the advocacy of
those who have gone astray, we see not of what sort your satisfaction is
either to God or men.  For then your Greatness may know that you openly
and evidently satisfy God and men, when you bring back both what is
devious to rectitude and what is presumptuous to the rule of humility. 
If this is done, you may know that you will thus be in favour both with
God and men.
