<span id="ii.v.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.v.ii-p1.1"></span>Epistle II.</span>

<span id="ii.v.ii-p2"></span>To Vitalis, Guardian (Defensorem) of
Sardinia.

<span id="ii.v.ii-p3"></span>Gregory to Vitalis, &c.

<span id="ii.v.ii-p4"></span>What we have learnt about our brother the
bishop Januarius the bearers of these presents, as well as the copies of
our letters, will sufficiently inform you; and so let thy Experience
judiciously carry into effect the excommunication which we have decreed
to be pronounced on his perverse counsellors, that they may learn by
falling not to walk unwarily.

<span id="ii.v.ii-p5"></span>Moreover, we have sent back by Redemptus
the guardian (*defensorem*), the bearer of these presents, the wheat
which had been sent to us under the name of a present.  Let thy
experience see that neither thou nor he who brought it presume to
partake of anything out of it as a bounty <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) , but restore the whole of it without
abatement to the several persons, or to all of them together, and send
me their receipts for the value; for, should I ascertain that anything
has been done otherwise than as I direct, I will visit the offence with
no slight severity.
