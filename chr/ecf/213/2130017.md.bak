<span id="ii.v.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.v.xi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XI.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xi-p2"></span>To Brunichild, Queen.

<span id="ii.v.xi-p3"></span>Gregory to Brunichild, Queen of the
Franks <span id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md) .

<span id="ii.v.xi-p5"></span>With what firmness the mind of your
Excellency is settled in the fear of Almighty God you shew in a
praiseworthy manner, among the other good things that you do, by your
love also of His priests; and great joy for your Christianity is caused
us, since you study to advance with honours those whom you love and
venerate as being truly Christ’s servants.  For it becomes you, most
excellent daughter, <span id="page_7">p. 7</span> <span
id="ii.v.xi-Page_7"></span>it becomes you to be such as to be able to
subject yourself to a lord above you.  For in submitting the neck of
your mind to the fear of the Almighty Lord you confirm your dominion
also over subject nations, and by subjecting yourself to the service of
the Creator you bind your subjects the more devotedly to yourself. 
Wherefore, having received your letters, we signify to you that your
Excellency’s earnest desire has greatly pleased us, and we have been
desirous of sending the pallium to our brother and fellow-bishop
Syagrius <span id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md) , inasmuch as the
disposition of our most serene lord the Emperor is also favourable, and,
so far as we have been informed by our deacon, who was the
representative of our Church at his Court, he is altogether desirous
that this thing should be granted <span id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) ,
and many good reports have reached us of our aforesaid brother both on
your testimony and that of others; and especially we learnt what his
life is from John the Regionarius <span id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md)
on his return to us.  And hearing what he did in the case of our brother
Augustine, we bless our Redeemer, because we feel that he fulfils in his
deeds the meaning of his name of priest.

<span id="ii.v.xi-p9"></span>But there have been many hindrances which
have meanwhile prevented us from doing this thing.  First indeed, that
he who had come to receive this pallium is implicated in the error of
the schismatics <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md) ; further, that you
wished it to be understood that it was sent, not on your petition, but
from ourselves.  But there was this besides; that neither had he who
desires to use it requested it to be granted him by a special petition
addressed to us:  and it was by no means right for us to concede so
great a matter without his request; especially as an ancient custom has
obtained, that the dignity of the pallium shall not be given except when
the merits of a case demand it, and to one who urgently requests it. 
Still, lest we should seem perchance to wish, under pretext of any
excuse, to put off the desire of your Excellency, we have provided for
the pallium being sent to our most beloved son Candidus the presbyter,
charging him, with befitting precaution, to deliver it in our stead. 
Hence it is requisite that our above-written brother and fellow-bishop
Syagrius must hope for it, when he has of his own motion drawn up a
petition with some of his bishops; and this he must give to the
aforesaid presbyter, to the end that he may be in a position to obtain
properly the use of the same pallium with the favour of God.

<span id="ii.v.xi-p11"></span>In order, then, that the charge you bear
may be of fruit to you before the eyes of our Creator, let the
solicitude of your Christianity be diligently on the watch, and suffer
no one who is under your dominion to attain to holy orders by the giving
of money, or the patronage of any persons whatever, or by right of
relationship; but let such a one be elected to the episcopate, or to the
office of any other sacred order, as his life and manners have shewn to
be worthy; lest if, as we do not expect, the dignity of the priesthood
should be venal, simoniacal heresy, which was the first to come up in
the Church, and has been condemned by the sentence of the Fathers,
should arise in your parts, and (which God forbid) should weaken the
powers of your kingdom.  For it is a serious matter, and a wickedness
beyond what can be told, to sell the Holy Spirit, who redeemed all
things.

<span id="ii.v.xi-p12"></span>But let this also be your care, that,
since, as you know, the excellent preacher entirely forbids a novice to
accede to the ruling position of priesthood, you suffer no one to be
consecrated bishop from being a layman.  For what sort of master will he
be who has not been a disciple?  Or what kind of leadership can he
supply to the Lord’s flock who has not been previously subjected to a
shepherd’s discipline?  If, then, any one’s life should be such as to
shew him worthy of being promoted to this order, he ought first to serve
in the ministry of the Church, to the end that by the experience of long
practice he may see what to imitate, and learn what to teach; lest
perchance the newness of his charge bear not the burden of government,
and occasion of ruin arise from the immaturity of his promotion.

<span id="ii.v.xi-p13"></span>Moreover, how your Excellency conducted
yourself towards our brother and fellow-bishop Augustine, and how great
charity, through the inspiration of God, you bestowed upon him, we have
learnt from the relation of divers of the faithful; for which we return
thanks, and implore the mercy of Divine Power to keep <span
id="page_8">p. 8</span> <span id="ii.v.xi-Page_8"></span>you here under
its protection, and cause you to reign, as among men, so also after a
course of many years in life eternal.

<span id="ii.v.xi-p14"></span>Furthermore, those whom the error of the
schismatics severs from the unity of the Church, strive ye, for your own
reward, to recall to the unity of concord.  For on no other ground are
they enveloped so far in the blindness of their ignorance but that they
may escape ecclesiastical discipline, and have licence to live
perversely as they please, since they understand neither what they
defend nor what they follow.  But as for us, we venerate and follow in
all respects the synod of Chalcedon, from which they take to themselves
the clouds of a pestiferous excuse; and, if any one should presume to
diminish or add anything with regard to the faith thereof, we
anathematize him.  But they are so impregnated with the taint of error
that, giving credence to their own ignorance, they reject the universal
Church, and all the four patriarchs, not with reason, but with malicious
intent; so that he who was sent to us by your Excellency, when he was
asked by us why he stood separated from the universal Church,
acknowledged that he did not know.  But neither what he said nor what
else he gave ear to had he the power of knowing.  As to this also we no
less exhort you, that you should restrain the rest of your subjects
under the control of discipline from sacrificing to idols, being
worshippers of trees, or exhibiting sacrilegious sacrifices of the heads
of animals; seeing that it has come to our ears that many of the
Christians both resort to the churches and also (horrible to relate!) do
not give up their worshipping of demons.  But, since these things are
altogether displeasing to our God, and He does not own divided minds,
provide ye for their being salubriously restrained from these unlawful
practices; lest (God forbid it!) the sacrament of holy baptism serve not
for their rescue, but for their punishment.  If therefore you know of
any that are violent, if of any that are adulterers, if of any that are
thieves, or bent on other wicked deeds, make haste to appease God by
their correction, that He may not bring upon you the scourge due to
unfaithful races, which, so far as we see, is already lifted up for the
punishment of many nations; lest, if—as we do not believe will be the
case—the wrath of Divine vengeance should be kindled by the doings of
the wicked, the plague of war should destroy the sinners whom the
precepts of God recall not to the way of rectitude.  We must, then,
needs make haste, with all earnestness and continual prayer, to betake
ourselves to the mercy of our Redeemer, wherein there is a place of
safety and great security for all.  For whoso steadfastly abides there,
him danger crushes not, nor fear alarms.

<span id="ii.v.xi-p15"></span>We have sent the volume, as you desired us
by letter, to our aforesaid most beloved son Candidus the presbyter, to
be offered to you, being in haste to be sharers in your good purpose. 
May Almighty God keep you under His protection, and by His outstretched
arm defend your kingdom from unbelieving nations, and bring you after
long courses of years to eternal joys.  Given in the month of October,
the first indiction <span id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) .

<span id="fn_18"></span>[6:19](2130017.htm#fr_18.md) <span
id="ii.v.xi-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xi-p4"></span> Four Vatican <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xi-p4.1"></span>mss.</span> and Cod. Colbert give a date to
this epistle, viz. “mense Octobris, indictione prima,” i.e. Oct. <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xi-p4.2"></span>a.d.</span> 597.  The
Benedictine editors assign it, from certain internal evidence to the
following year, and have therefore placed it in this ninth Book of the
Epistles.  There is this additional reason for placing it later than
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xi-p4.3"></span>a.d.</span> 597.  Its
first purpose is to reply to a request from queen Brunechild that a
pallium should be sent to Syagrius, bishop of Augustodunum (*Autun*). 
Now Autun was in the kingdom of Burgundy, which was reigned over at that
time by Brunechild’s younger grandson Theoderic II.  But it was not till
the year 599, according to Gregory of Tours (*Hist. Franc*. xi. 19),
that she had been expelled from the kingdom of Austrasia, and taken up
her residence with Theoderic.  She had previously been guardian of her
elder grandson Theodebert II., who reigned over Austrasia, having his
capital at Metz, and she was more likely to have sought the pall for the
bishop Autun after she had become the virtual potentate of the
Burgundian kingdom than previously; and indeed she seems to be evidently
addressed as ruling the country to which the letter refers.  The date
assigned to this epistle by the Benedictine editors, viz. Indiction 2
(i.e. from September 598 to September 599), is consistent with these
circumstances.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[7:20](2130017.htm#fr_19.md) <span
id="ii.v.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xi-p6"></span> Bishop of Augustodunum (*Autun*), one of
the bishops to whom Augustine had carried commendatory letters from
Gregory on his progress to England (VI. 54).  The see of Augustodunum
was under the metropolitan jurisdiction of Lugdunum (*Lyons*); and
Brunechild, for some reason, appears to have desired to have it invested
with peculiar dignity.  She afterwards founded a church, a nunnery, and
a hospital there (see XIII. 6).  It is to be observed that the sending
of the pallium to a bishop did not in all cases imply metropolitan
jurisdiction.  It did not in this case.  See Epistle CVIII. to Syagrius,
in which he is told that the Metropolitan of Lyons was to retain his
position unimpaired; only that the bishop of Autun was thenceforth to be
next to him in place and dignity.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[7:21](2130017.htm#fr_20.md) <span
id="ii.v.xi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xi-p7"></span> We observe here the requirement of the
Emperor’s consent for sending the Pallium to a see not previously thus
dignified.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[7:22](2130017.htm#fr_21.md) <span
id="ii.v.xi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xi-p8"></span> It seems not to be known with any
certainty what the title *Regionarius*, thus used absolutely, implies,
though no doubt some honourable function.  John the Deacon (*Vit. S.
Gregor*.) speaks of Gregory’s father Gordianus, a layman, as having been
a *Regionarius*.  As to *Notarii regionarii, Sub-diaconi regionarii,
Defensores regionarii*, cf. VIII. 14.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[7:23](2130017.htm#fr_22.md) <span
id="ii.v.xi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xi-p10"></span> Meaning those who were out of communion
with Rome with regard to “The Three Chapters,” see I. 16, note 3.  There
were some in Gaul, as well as in Istria and elsewhere, who long refused
assent to the condemnation of the Chapters by the fifth Council.  Cf.
IV. 2, 3, 4, 38, 39; XVI. 12.
