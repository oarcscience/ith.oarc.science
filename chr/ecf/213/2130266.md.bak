<span id="iii.vii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.vii.iii-p1.1"></span>Hymn II.</span>

<span id="iii.vii.iii-p2"></span>1.  Whereunto art thou like?  Let thy
stillness speak to one that hears; with silent mouth speak with us:  for
whoso hears the stammerings of thy silence, to him thy type utters its
silent cry concerning our Redeemer.

<span id="iii.vii.iii-p3"></span>Thy mother is a virgin of the sea;
though he took her not \[to wife\]:  she fell into his bosom, though he
knew her not; she conceived thee near him, though he did not know her. 
Do thou, that art a type, reproach the Jewish women that have thee hung
upon them.  Thou art the only progeny of all forms which art like to the
Word on High, Whom singly the Most High begot.  The engraven forms seem
to be the type of created things above.  This visible offspring of the
invisible womb is a type of great things. <span
id="fr_521"></span>[522](#fn_521.md)   Thy goodly conception was without
seed, and without wedlock was thy pure generation, and without brethren
was thy single birth.

<span id="iii.vii.iii-p5"></span>Our Lord had brethren and yet not
brethren, since He was an Only-Begotten.  O solitary one, thou type
exact of the Only-Begotten!  There is a type of thine in the crown of
kings, \[wherein\] thou hast brothers and sisters.

<span id="iii.vii.iii-p6"></span>Goodly gems are thy brethren, with
beryls and unions as thy companions:  may gold be as it were thy
kinsman, may there be unto the King of kings a crown from thy
well-beloved ones!  When thou camest up from the sea, that living tomb,
thou didst cry out.  Let me have a goodly assemblage of brethren,
relatives, and kinsmen.  As the wheat is in the stalk, so thou art in
the crown with princes:  and it is a just restoration to thee, as if of
a pledge, <span id="fr_522"></span>[523](#fn_522.md) that from that depth
thou shouldest be exalted to a goodly eminence.  Wheat the stalk bears
in the field; thee the head of the king upon his chariot carries about.

<span id="iii.vii.iii-p8"></span>O daughter of the water, who hast left
sea, wherein thou wert born, and art gone up to the dry land, wherein
thou art beloved:  for men have loved and seized and adorned themselves
with thee, like as they did that Offspring Whom the Gentiles loved and
crowned themselves withal.

<span id="iii.vii.iii-p9"></span>It is by the mystery of truth that
Leviathan is trodden down of mortals:  the divers put him off, and put
on Christ.  In the sacrament of oil did the Apostles <span
id="fr_523"></span>[524](#fn_523.md) steal Thee away, and came up.  They
snatched their souls from his mouth, bitter as it was.

<span id="iii.vii.iii-p11"></span><span id="page_295">p. 295</span>
<span id="iii.vii.iii-Page_295"></span>Thy Nature is like a silent lamb
in its sweetness, of which if a man is to lay hold, he lifts it in a
crucial form by its ears, as it was on Golgotha.  He cast out abundantly
all His gleams upon them that looked upon Him.

<span id="iii.vii.iii-p12"></span>2.  Shadowed forth in thy beauty is
the beauty of the Son, Who clothed Himself with suffering when the nails
passed through Him.  The awl passed in thee since they handled thee
roughly, as they did His hands; and because He suffered He reigned, as
by thy sufferings thy beauty increased.

<span id="iii.vii.iii-p13"></span>And if they showed no pity upon thee,
neither did they love thee:  still suffer as thou mightest, thou hast
come to reign!  Simon Peter <span id="fr_524"></span>[525](#fn_524.md)
showed pity on the Rock; whoso hath smitten it, is himself thereby
overcome; it is by reason of Its suffering that Its beauty hath adorned
the height and the depth.

like created natures.
