<span id="iii.vi.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>Hymn II.</span>

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p2"></span>(Nearly identical with Hymn XIII. *On
the Nativity*.)

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p3"></span>(<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.vi.iii-p3.1"></span>Resp</span>.—*To Thee be praise Who in this
feast makest all to exult!*)

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p4"></span>1.  In the time of the King whom they
called by the name Semha <span id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509.md) —our
Lord was manifested among the Hebrews.—Thus Semha and Denha <span
id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510.md) reigned together,—the King on earth
and the Son on high—blessed *be* His power!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p7"></span>2.  In the days of the King who wrote
down men in the taxing,—our Saviour came down and wrote down men in the
Book of Life; He wrote and was written;—on high He wrote us, on earth He
was written; glory to His Name!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p8"></span>3.  His Birth was in the days of the
King whose name was Semha.—Symbol and truth met one another;—King and
King, Semha and Denha.—That kingdom bore His Cross; blessed *be* He Who
took it up!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p9"></span>4.  Thirty years abode He on earth in
poverty.—Voices of praise in all measures,—let us weave my brethren for
our Lord’s years;—thirty crowns for thirty years; Blessed be His number!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p10"></span>5.  In the first year, mistress of
treasure and filled with blessings,—let the Cherubin give thanks with
us, they who bear—the Son in glory Who gave up His glorious state,—and
toiled and found the sheep that was lost;—to Him *be* thanksgiving!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p11"></span><span id="page_267">p. 267</span> <span
id="iii.vi.iii-Page_267"></span>6.  In the second year let the Seraphin
multiply thanksgiving with us;—they who cried “Holy” to the Son, and
turned and saw Him—among unbelievers put to shame.—He endured scorn and
taught *us* glory; to Him be glory given!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p12"></span>7.  In the third year let Michael and
his hosts give thanks with us;—they who were wont to serve the Son on
high,—*and* saw Him on earth doing service.—He washed *men’s* feet and
cleansed *men’s* souls; blessed *be* His meekness!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p13"></span>8.  In the fourth year let all the
heavens give thanks with us!  *Too* narrow for the Son it shall burst to
see—how He lay on the couch of despised Zaccheus.—He filled the couch
and had filled the heavens;—to Him *be* thanksgiving!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p14"></span>9.  In the fifth year let the Sun that
burns the earth with its heat—give thanks to our Sun that He straitened
His largeness,—and tempered His force that *the eye* might endure to see
Him;—the inward eye of a pure soul; blessed *be* His radiance!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p15"></span>10.  In the sixth year again let all
the air give thanks with us,—in the vastness whereof all things
exult.—It saw its great Lord that He became—a little babe in a lowly
bosom; blessed *be* His honour!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p16"></span>11.  In the seventh year let the clouds
and winds sound *the trumpet* with us,—they whose dew sprinkles the
faces of the flowers,—yet saw they the Son that He subdued His
brightness,—and endured scorn and shameful spitting;—blessed *be* His
salvation!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p17"></span>12.  Yet again in the eighth year let
Creation give glory,—from whose fountain the fruits draw nurture.—She
adored when she saw the Son at the breast,—pure *babe* nurtured by pure
milk; blessed *be* His good pleasure!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p18"></span>13.  In the ninth year let the earth
give glory, which when her lap is watered then brings forth the
root.—She saw Mary an unwatered soil—whose fruit that she yielded is a
mighty sea; to Him *be* exultation!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p19"></span>R., To Thee be glory, Son of the Lord
of all, Who givest life to all!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p20"></span>14.  In the tenth year let Mount Sinai
give glory, which melted—before its Lord!  It saw against its
Lord—stones taken up:  but He took stones—to build the Church upon the
Rock; blessed *be* His building!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p21"></span>15.  In the eleventh year let the great
sea give thanks—to the hand of the Son Who measured it!  And it wondered
to see how He came down and was washed—in humble waters, He that
cleanses Creation; blessed *be* His triumph!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p22"></span>16.  In the twelfth year let the holy
Temple give thanks—which beheld the Child as He sat—among the elders: 
the doctors were silenced—as the Lamb of the feast bleated in the feast;
blessed *be* His atonement!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p23"></span>17.  In the thirteenth year let diadems
with us give thanks—to the King Who triumphed and was crowned—with a
crown of thorns:  He wove for man—a mighty diadem at His right hand;
blessed *be* He That sent Him!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p24"></span>18.  In the fourteenth year let the
Passover of Egypt give thanks—to the Passover that came and made
passover for all,—and instead of Pharaoh overwhelmed Legion,—and instead
of horsemen drowned demons; blessed *be* His retribution!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p25"></span>19.  In the fifteenth year let the lamb
of the flock give thanks,—that our Lord slew it not as *did* Moses,—but
redeemed by His Blood mankind.—He the Shepherd of all died for all;
blessed *be* He That begat Him!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p26"></span>20.  In the sixteenth year let the
seed-corn in mystery give thanks—to that Husbandman Who gave His Body
for seed—in a barren soil that corrupts all things.—It proved fertile
and yielded new bread; blessed *be He that is* pure!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p27"></span>21.  In the seventeenth year let the
Vine give thanks to our Lord,—the Vineyard of truth, *wherein* souls
were—as the scions.  He gave peace to this vineyard, but laid waste that
vineyard which bare wild grapes; blessed *be* the Uprooter!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p28"></span><span id="page_268">p. 268</span> <span
id="iii.vi.iii-Page_268"></span>22.  In the eighteenth year let our
leaven give thanks—to the leaven of truth that penetrates and draws—all
minds and makes them *to become*—one mind in one doctrine; blessed *be*
His doctrine!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p29"></span>23.  In the nineteenth year let the
Salt give thanks for Thy Body.—O blessed Babe it is the soul—that is the
salt of the Body, and Faith—the salt of the soul whereby it is
preserved; blessed *be* Thy preservation!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p30"></span>R., Glory to Thy Epiphany, O God and
Man!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p31"></span>24.  In the twentieth year let temporal
wealth with us give thanks,—which men *that are* perfect have cast off
and abandoned—because of the “Woe”; and have gone and loved—poverty
because of its beatitude; blessed *be* He Who desired it!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p32"></span>25.  In the one-and-twentieth year let
the waters give thanks that were sweetened—in a mystery of the Son.  In
the honey of Samson—the nations tasted bitterness therein that destroyed
them:—they had life in the Cross that redeemed them; blessed be its
pleasantness!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p33"></span>26.  In the two-and-twentieth year let
arms and the sword give thanks,—for they could not slay our
Adversary.—Thou art He Who slew him as Thou art He Who restored—the ear
that Simon’s sword cut off; blessed *be* Thy healing!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p34"></span>27.  In the three-and-twentieth year
let the ass likewise give thanks,—that gave the colt whereon He should
ride;—He opens likewise the mouth of wild asses,—the offspring gave
*Him* praise; blessed *be* the praise of Thee!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p35"></span>28.  In the four-and-twentieth year let
wealth give thanks to the Son!—Treasures were amazed at the Lord of
treasures,—how He grew up among the poor.—He made Himself poor that He
might make all rich; blessed *be* His participation!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p36"></span>29.  In the five-and-twentieth year let
Isaac give thanks to the Son—Who in the mount saved him from the
knife,—and became in his stead the lamb to be slain.—The mortal escaped,
and He died Who gives life to all; blessed *be* His offering!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p37"></span>30.  In the six-and-twentieth year let
Moses with us give thanks,—who feared and fled from the slayers;—let him
give thanks to the Son, for He it was Who on His feet—entered Sheol and
spoiled it and came forth; blessed *be* His Resurrection!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p38"></span>\[31.  In the seven-and-twentieth year
let the eloquent Orators—give thanks to the Son, for they could not
find—means whereby we should prevail in our judgment:—He was silent in
judgment and made our judgment prevail; to Him *be* applause!\]

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p39"></span>32.  In the seven and twentieth year
let all Judges give thanks,—who as being just have put to death
illdoers;—let them give thanks to the Son Who instead of the evil—died
as being good, though He was Son of the Just One; blessed *be* His
mercies!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p40"></span>33.  In the eight-and-twentieth year
let them give thanks to the Son,—all the mighty men who saved us
not—from the captors.  One is to be worshipped,—Who was slain and laid
hold and saved us; blessed *be* His deliverance!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p41"></span>34.  In the nine-and-twentieth year let
Job with us give thanks,—who bare sufferings in his own behalf:—but our
Lord bare on our behalf—the spitting and the stripes, the thorns and the
nails; blessed is His compassion!

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p42"></span>35.  In the year that is the thirtieth
let them give thanks with us;—the dead that have lived through His
dying,—the living that were converted in His Crucifixion,—and the height
and the depth that have been reconciled in Him!  Blessed *be* He and His
Father!
