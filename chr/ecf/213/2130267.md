<span id="iii.vii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.vii.iv-p1.1"></span>Hymn III.</span>

<span id="iii.vii.iv-p2"></span>1.  Thou dost not hide thyself in thy
bareness, O pearl!  With the love of thee is the merchant ravished also,
for he strips off his garments; not to cover thee, \[seeing\] thy
clothing is thy light, thy garment is thy brightness, O thou that art
bared!

<span id="iii.vii.iv-p3"></span>Thou art like Eve who was clothed with
nakedness.  Cursed be he that deceived her and stripped her and left
her.  The serpent cannot strip off thy glory.  In the mysteries whose
type thou art, women are clothed with Light in Eden. <span
id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525)

<span id="iii.vii.iv-p5"></span>2.  Very glistening are the pearls of
Ethiopia, as it is written, Who gave thee to Ethiopia \[the land\] of
black men. <span id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526)   He that gave light
to the Gentiles, both to the Ethiopians and unto the Indians did His
bright beams reach.

<span id="iii.vii.iv-p7"></span>The eunuch of Ethiopia upon his
chariot <span id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527) saw Philip:  the Lamb of
Light met the dark man from out of the water.  While he was reading, the
Ethiopian was baptised and shone with joy, and journeyed on!

<span id="iii.vii.iv-p9"></span>He made disciples and taught, and out of
black men he made men white. <span id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528)  
And the dark Ethiopic women <span id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529)
became pearls for the Son; He offered them up to the Father, as a
glistening crown from the Ethiopians.

<span id="iii.vii.iv-p12"></span>3.  The Queen of Sheba <span
id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530) was a sheep <span
id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531) that had come into the place of
wolves; the lamp of truth did Solomon give her, who also married <span
id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532) her when he fell away.  She was
enlightened and went away, but they were dark as their manner was.

<span id="iii.vii.iv-p16"></span>The bright spark which went down home
with that blessed \[Queen\], held on its shining amid the darkness, till
the new Day-spring came.  The bright spark met with this shining, and
illumined the place.

<span id="iii.vii.iv-p17"></span>4.  There are in the sea divers fishes
of many cubits, and with all their greatness they are very small; but by
thy littleness the crown is made great, like as the Son, by whose
littleness Adam was made great.

<span id="iii.vii.iv-p18"></span>For the head is thy crown intended: 
for the eye thy beauty, for the ear thy goodliness.  Come up from the
sea, thou neighbour to the dry land, and come and sojourn by the \[seat
of\] hearing.  Let the ear love the word of life as it loveth thee!

<span id="iii.vii.iv-p19"></span>In the ear is the word, and without it
is the pearl.  Let it as being warned by thee, <span id="page_296">p.
296</span> <span id="iii.vii.iv-Page_296"></span>by thee get wisdom, and
be warned by the word of truth.  Be thou its mirror:  the beauty of the
Word in thine own beauty shall it see:  in thee it shall learn how
precious is the Word on High!  The ear is the leaf:  the flesh is the
tree, and thou in the midst of it are a fruit of light, and to the womb
that brings forth Light, thou art a type that points.

<span id="iii.vii.iv-p20"></span>Thee He used as a parable of that
kingdom, O pearl! as He did the virgins that entered into it, five in
number, clothed with the light of their lamps!  To thee are those bright
ones like, thou that art clad in light!

<span id="iii.vii.iv-p21"></span>5.  Who would give a pearl to the
daughter of the poor?  For when it hangs on her, it becomes her not. 
Gain without price that faith, all of which becomes all the limbs of
men.  But for no gold would a lady exchange her pearl.

<span id="iii.vii.iv-p22"></span>It were a great disgrace if thou
shouldst throw thy pearl away into the mire for nought!

<span id="iii.vii.iv-p23"></span>In the pearl of time let us behold that
of eternity; for it is in the purse, or in the seal, or in the
treasury.  Within the gate there are other gates with their locks and
keys.  Thy pearl hath the High One sealed up as taking account of all.

<span id="iii.vii.iv-p14"></span> Why St. E. contemplates the queen as a
sheep appears from his remarks on the place.  The following are a part
of them “It was not the fame of Solomon only, but also the Name of the
Lord, which called to this queen, who sought to know the God of Solomon,
who set out upon a dangerous long journey, and brought presents fit for
a king.…Our Lord also extolled this queen in the Gospel, and praised her
zealousness, when He rebuked the sluggishness of the Jews.”

<span id="iii.vii.iv-p15"></span> This was a tradition of the Jews, a
tradition based in part on [Song of Sol.
