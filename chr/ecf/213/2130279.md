id="iii.ix.ii-p3.1"></span>Letter of an Inquirer.</span>

<span id="iii.ix.ii-p4"></span>1.  Beloved, I send thee inquiries and
questions, for I am compelled to seek further instruction of thee on
many points.  Do not thou refuse to hear me.  My spirit urges me to warn
thee about many topics <span id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646.md) that thou
mayest unfold for me the spiritual perceptions of thy mind, and mayest
show me of all that thou hast apprehended from the holy books, that so
my deficiency may be supplied by thee and my hunger satisfied by thy
doctrine, and that thou mayest assuage my thirst from the fountain of
thine instruction.  Yet though many things are set in my thought to ask
thee, they all are notwithstanding reserved with me, that when I come to
thee, thou mayest instruct me on all subjects.

<span id="iii.ix.ii-p6"></span>2.  But before all things I desire that
thou wouldst write and instruct me concerning this that straitens me,
namely, concerning our faith; how it is, and what its foundation is, and
on what structure it rises, on what it rests, and in what way is its
fulfilment and consummation, and what are the works required for it. 
For I of myself firmly believe that God is one, Who made the heavens and
the earth from the beginning; that He adorned the world by His
handiwork; that He made man in His image; He it is that accepted the
offering of Abel.  He translated Enoch because of his excellence.  He
preserved Noah because of his righteousness.  He chose Abraham because
of his faith.  He spake with Moses on account of his meekness.  He it is
that spake in all the prophets, and furthermore He sent His Christ into
the world.  Since then, my brother, I thus believe in these things that
so they are, I therefore, brother, request of thee that thou wouldest
write and show me what are the works required for this our faith, that
so thou mayest set me at rest.

<span id="iii.ix.ii-p5"></span> The beginning to this point is lost in
the Syriac but has been preserved in the Armenian translation.  We have
borrowed it thence through the Latin translation of Graffin (*Patrologia
Syriaca*, Tom. I.).
