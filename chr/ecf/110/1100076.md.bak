<span id="iii.LXVIII"></span>

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iii.LXVIII-p1.1"></span>Homily LXXI.</span>

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.LXVIII-p2.1"></span>[Matt. XXII.
34-36](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#034.md)<span
id="iii.LXVIII-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p3"></span>“But when the Pharisees had heard that
He had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together; and
one of them, which was a lawyer, asked Him a question, tempting Him, and
saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law?”

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.LXVIII-p4.1"></span>Again</span> doth the evangelist express the
cause, for which they ought to have held their peace, and marks their
boldness by this also. How and in what way? Because when those others
were put to silence, these again assail Him. For when they ought even
for this to hold their peace, they strive to urge further their former
endeavors, <span id="fr_2630"></span>[2631](#fn_2630.md) and put forward
the lawyer, not desiring to learn, but making a trial of Him, and ask,
“What is the first commandment?”

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p6"></span>For since the first commandment was
this, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,” thinking that He would afford
them some handle, as though He would amend it, for the sake of showing
that Himself too was God, they propose the question. What then saith
Christ? Indicating from what they were led to this; from having no
charity, from pining with envy, from being seized by jealousy, He saith,
“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God. This is the first and great
commandment. <span id="fr_2631"></span>[2632](#fn_2631.md) And the second
is like unto this, <span id="fr_2632"></span>[2633](#fn_2632.md) Thou shalt
love thy neighbor as thyself.” <span
id="fr_2633"></span>[2634](#fn_2633.md)

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p10"></span>But wherefore “like unto this?” Because
this makes the way for that, and by it is again established; “For every
one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the
light;” <span id="fr_2634"></span>[2635](#fn_2634.md) and again, “The fool
hath said in his heart, There is no God.” And what in consequence of
this? “They are corrupt, and become abominable in their ways.” <span
id="fr_2635"></span>[2636](#fn_2635.md) And again, “The love of money is
the root of all evils; which while some coveted after they have erred
from the faith;” <span id="fr_2636"></span>[2637](#fn_2636.md) and, “He
that loveth me, will keep my commandment.” <span
id="fr_2637"></span>[2638](#fn_2637.md)

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p15"></span>But His commandments, and the sum of
them, are, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, and thy neighbor as
thyself.” If therefore to love God is to love one’s neighbor, “For if
thou lovest me,” He saith, “O Peter, feed my sheep,” <span
id="fr_2638"></span>[2639](#fn_2638.md) but to love one’s neighbor worketh
a keeping of the commandments, with reason doth He say, “On these hang
all the law and the prophets.” <span
id="fr_2639"></span>[2640](#fn_2639.md)

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p18"></span>So therefore what He did before, this
He doth here also. I mean, that both there, when asked about the manner
of the resurrection, He also taught a resurrection, instruct <span
id="page_414">p. 414</span> <span id="iii.LXVIII-Page_414"></span> ing
them beyond what they inquired; and here, being asked the first
commandment, He rehearses the second also, which is not much inferior to
that (for though second, it is like that), intimating to them, whence
the question had arisen, that it was from hatred. “For charity envieth
not.” <span id="fr_2640"></span>[2641](#fn_2640.md) By this He shows
Himself to be submissive both to the law and to the prophets.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p20"></span>But wherefore doth Matthew say that he
asked, tempting Him, but Mark the contrary? “For when Jesus,” he saith,
“saw that he answered discreetly, He said unto him, Thou art not far
from the kingdom of God.” <span id="fr_2641"></span>[2642](#fn_2641.md)

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p22"></span>They are not contradicting each other,
but indeed fully agreeing. For he asked indeed, tempting, at the
beginning, but being benefitted by the answer, was commended. For not at
the beginning did He commend him, but when he had said, “That to love
his neighbor is more than whole burnt sacrifices,” then He saith, “Thou
art not far from the kingdom;” because he overlooked low things, and
embraced the first principle of virtue. For indeed all those are for the
sake of this, as well the Sabbath as the rest.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p23"></span>And not even so did He make His
commendation perfect, but yet deficient. For His saying, “Thou art not
far off,” indicates that he is yet falling short, that he might seek
after what was deficient.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p24"></span>But if, when He said, “There is one
God, and there is none other but He,” He commended him, wonder not, but
by this too observe, how He answers according to the opinion of them
that come unto Him. For although men say ten thousand things about
Christ unworthy of His glory, yet this at any rate they will not dare to
say, that He is not God at all. Wherefore then doth He praise him that
said, that beside the Father, there is no other God?

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p25"></span>Not excepting Himself from being God;
away with the thought; but since it was not yet time to disclose His
Godhead, He suffers him to remain in the former doctrine, and praises
him for knowing well the ancient principles, so as to make him fit for
the doctrine of the New Testament, which He is bringing in its season.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p26"></span>And besides, the saying, “There is one
God, and there is none other but He,” both in the Old Testament and
everywhere, is spoken not to the rejection of the Son, but to make the
distinction from idols. So that when praising this man also, who had
thus spoken, He praises him in this mind.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p27"></span>Then since He had answered, He asks
also in turn, “What think ye of Christ, whose Son is He? They say unto
Him, The Son of David.” <span id="fr_2642"></span>[2643](#fn_2642.md)

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p29"></span>See after how many miracles, after how
many signs, after how many questions, after how great a display of His
unanimity with the Father, as well in words, as in deeds; after having
praised this man that said, that there is one God, He asks the question,
that they may not be able to say, that He did miracles indeed, yet was
an adversary to the law, and a foe to God.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p30"></span>Therefore, after so many things, He
asks these questions, secretly leading them on to confess Him also to be
God. And the disciples He asked first what the others say, and then
themselves; but these not so; for surely they would have said a
deceiver, and a wicked one, as speaking all things without fear. So for
this cause He inquires for the opinion of these men themselves.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p31"></span>For since He was now about to go on to
His passion, He sees forth the prophecy that plainly proclaims Him to be
Lord; and not as having come to do this without occasion, nor as having
made this His aim, but from a reasonable cause.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p32"></span>For having asked them first, since they
answered not the truth concerning Him (for they said He was a mere man),
to overthrow their mistaken opinion, He thus introduces David
proclaiming His Godhead. For they indeed supposed that He was a mere
man, wherefore also they said, “the Son of David;” <span
id="fr_2643"></span>[2644](#fn_2643.md) but He to correct this brings in
the prophet witnessing to His being Lord, and the genuineness of His
Sonship, and His equality in honor with His Father.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p34"></span>And not even at this doth He stop, but
in order to move them to fear, He adds what followeth also, saying,
“Till I make Thine enemies Thy footstool;” <span
id="fr_2644"></span>[2645](#fn_2644.md) that at least in this way He might
gain them over.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p36"></span>And that they may not say, that it was
in flattery he so called Him, and that this was a human judgment, see
what He saith, “How then doth David in spirit call Him Lord?” See how
submissively He introduces the sentence and judgment concerning Himself.
First, He had said, “What think ye? Whose Son is He?” so by a question
to bring them to an answer. Then since they said, “the Son of David,” He
said not, “And yet David saith these things,” but again in this order of
a question, “How then <span id="page_415">p. 415</span> <span
id="iii.LXVIII-Page_415"></span> doth David in spirit call Him Lord?” in
order that the sayings might not give offense to them. Wherefore neither
did He say, What think ye of me, but of Christ. For this reason the
apostles also reasoned submissively, saying, “Let us speak freely of the
Patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried.” <span
id="fr_2645"></span>[2646](#fn_2645.md)

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p38"></span>And He Himself too in like manner for
this cause introduces the doctrine in the way of question and inference,
saying, “How then doth David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord
said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thy foes Thy
footstool;” <span id="fr_2646"></span>[2647](#fn_2646.md) and again, “If
David then call Him Lord, how is He then his Son,” <span
id="fr_2647"></span>[2648](#fn_2647.md) not taking away the fact that He is
his Son, away with the thought; for He would not then have reproved
Peter for this, <span id="fr_2648"></span>[2649](#fn_2648.md) but to
correct their secret thoughts. So that when He saith, “How is He his
Son?” He meaneth this, not so as ye say. For they said, that He is Son
only, and not also Lord. And this after the testimony, and then
submissively, “If David then call Him Lord, how is He his Son?”

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p42"></span>But, nevertheless, even when they had
heard these things, they answered nothing, for neither did they wish to
learn any of the things that were needful. Wherefore He Himself addeth
and saith, that “He is his Lord.” Or rather not even this very thing
doth He say without support, but having taken the prophet with Him,
because of His being exceedingly distrusted by them, and evil reported
of amongst them. To which fact we ought to have especial regard, and if
anything be said by Him that is lowly and submissive, not to be
offended, for the cause is this, with many other things also, that He
talks with them in condescension.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p43"></span>Wherefore now also He delivers His
doctrine in the manner of question and answer; but He darkly intimates
even in this way His dignity. For it was not as much to be called Lord
of the Jews, as of David.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p44"></span>But mark thou also, I pray thee, how
seasonable it is. For when He had said, “There is one Lord,” then He
spake of Himself that He is Lord, and showed it by prophecy, no more by
His works only. And He showeth the Father Himself taking vengeance upon
them in His behalf, for He saith, “Until I make Thine enemies Thy
footstool,” and great unanimity even hereby on the part of Him that
begat Him towards Himself, and honor. And upon His reasonings with them
He doth set this end high and great, and sufficient to close fast their
mouths.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p45"></span>For they were silent from thenceforth,
not willingly, but from their having nothing to say; and they received
so deadly a blow, as no longer to dare to attempt the same things any
more. For, “no one,” it is said, “durst from that day forth ask Him any
more questions.” <span id="fr_2649"></span>[2650](#fn_2649.md)

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p47"></span>And this was no little advantage to the
multitude. <span id="fr_2650"></span>[2651](#fn_2650.md) Therefore also
unto them doth He henceforth direct His word, having removed the wolves,
and having repulsed their plots.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p49"></span>For those men gained nothing, taken
captive by vainglory, and having fallen upon this terrible passion. For
terrible is this passion and many-headed, for some set their heart upon
power for the sake of this, some on wealth, some on strength. But
proceeding in order it goes on unto almsgiving also, and fasting, and
prayers, and teaching, and many are the heads of this monster.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p50"></span>But to be vainglorious indeed about
those other things is nothing wonderful; but to be so about fasting and
prayer, this is strange and lamentable.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p51"></span>But that we may not again blame only,
come and let us tell the means, by which we shall avoid this. Against
whom shall we prepare to contend first, against those that are
vainglorious of money, or those of dress, or those of places of power,
or those of sciences, or those of art, or those of their person, or
those of beauty, or those of ornaments, or those of cruelty, or those of
humanity and almsgiving, or those of wickedness, or those of death, or
those after death? For indeed, as I have said, this passion hath many
links, <span id="fr_2651"></span>[2652](#fn_2651.md) and goes on beyond our
life. For such a one, it is said, is dead, and that he may be held in
admiration, hath charged that such and such things be done; and
therefore such a one is poor, such a one rich.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p53"></span>For the grievous thing is this, that
even of opposite things is it made up.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p54"></span>Against whom then shall we stand, and
let ourselves in array first? For one and the same discourse suffices
not against all. Will ye then that it be against them that are
vainglorious about almsgiving?

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p55"></span>To me at least it seems well; for
exceedingly do I love this thing, and am pained at seeing it marred, and
vainglory plotting against it, like a pandering nurse against some royal
damsel. For she feeds her in <span id="page_416">p. 416</span> <span
id="iii.LXVIII-Page_416"></span> deed, but for disgrace and mischief,
prostituting her and commanding her to despise her father; but to deck
herself to please unholy and often despicable men; and invests her with
such a dress, as strangers wish, disgraceful, and dishonorable, not such
as the father.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p56"></span>Come now, then, let us take our aim
against these; and let there be an almsgiving made in abundance for
display to the multitude. Surely then, first vainglory leads her out of
her Father’s chamber. And whereas her Father requires not to appear so
much as to the left hand, <span id="fr_2652"></span>[2653](#fn_2652.md) she
displays her to the slaves, and to the vulgar, that have not even known
her.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p58"></span>Seest thou a harlot, and pander,
casting her into the love of foolish men, that according as they
require, so she may order herself? Dost thou desire to see how it
renders such a soul not a harlot only, but insane also?

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p59"></span>Mark then her mind. For when she lets
go heaven and runs after fugitives and menial slaves, pursuing through
streets and lanes them that hate her, the ugly and deformed, them that
are not willing so much as to look at her, them that, when she burns
with love towards them, hate her, what can be more insane than this? For
no one do the multitude hate so much, as those that want the glory they
have to bestow. Countless accusations at least do they frame against
them, and the result is the same, as if any one were to bring down a
virgin daughter of the king from the royal throne, and to require her to
prostitute herself to gladiators, who abhorred her. These then, as much
as thou pursuest them, so much do they turn away from thee; but God, if
thou seek the glory that cometh from Him, so much the more both draws
thee unto Himself, and commends thee, and great is the reward He renders
unto thee.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p60"></span>But if thou art minded in another way
also to discern the mischief thereof, when thou givest for display and
ostentation, consider how great the sorrow that then comes upon thee,
and how continual the desponding, while Christ’s voice is heard in thine
ears, saying, <span id="fr_2653"></span>[2654](#fn_2653.md) “Thou hast lost
all thy reward.” For in every matter indeed vainglory is a bad thing,
yet most of all in beneficence, for it is the utmost cruelty, making a
show of the calamities of others, and all but upbraiding those in
poverty. For if to mention one’s own good actions is to upbraid, what
dost thou think it is to publish them even to many others.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p62"></span>How then shall we escape the danger? If
we learn how to give alms, if we see after whose good report we are to
seek. For tell me, who has the skill of almsgiving? Plainly, it is God,
who hath made known the thing, who best of all knows it, and practises
it without limit. What then? If thou art learning to be a wrestler, to
whom dost thou look? or to whom dost thou display thy doings in the
wrestling school, to the seller of herbs, and of fish, or to the
trainer? And yet they are many, and he is one. What then, if while he
admires thee, others deride thee, wilt thou not with him deride them?

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p63"></span>What, if thou art learning to box, wilt
thou not look in like manner to him who knows how to teach this? And if
thou art practising oratory, wilt thou not accept the praise of the
teacher of rhetoric, and despise the rest.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p64"></span>How then is it other than absurd, in
other arts to look to the teacher only, but here to do the contrary?
although the loss be not equal. For there, if you wrestle according to
the opinion of the multitude, and not that of the teacher, the loss is
in the wrestling; but here it is in eternal life. Thou art become like
to God in giving alms; be thou then like Him in not making a display.
For even He said, when healing, that they should tell no man.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p65"></span>But dost thou desire to be called
merciful amongst men? And what is the gain? The gain is nothing; but the
loss infinite. For these very persons, whom thou callest to be
witnesses, become robbers of thy treasures that are in the heavens; or
rather not these, but ourselves, who spoil our own possessions, and
scatter what we have laid up above.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p66"></span>O new calamity! this strange passion.
Where moth corrupteth not, nor thief breaketh through, vainglory
scattereth. This is the moth of those treasures there; this the thief of
our wealth in heaven; this steals away the riches that cannot be
spoiled; this mars and corrupts all. For because the devil saw that that
place is impregnable to thieves and to the worm, and the other plots
against them, he by vainglory steals away the wealth.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p67"></span>But dost thou desire glory? Doth not
then that suffice thee which is given by the receiver himself, that from
our gracious God, but dost thou set thine heart on that from men also?
Take heed, lest thou undergo the contrary, lest some condemn thee as not
showing mercy, but making a display, and seeking honor, as making a show
of the calamities of others.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p68"></span>For indeed the showing of mercy is a
mystery. Shut therefore the doors, that none may see what it is not
pious to display. For our mysteries too are above all things, a <span
id="page_417">p. 417</span> <span id="iii.LXVIII-Page_417"></span>
showing of God’s mercy and loving-kindness. According to His great
mercy, He had mercy on us being disobedient.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p69"></span>And the first prayer too is full of
mercy, when we entreat for the energumens; and the second again, for
others under penance seeking for much mercy; and the third also for
ourselves, and this puts forward the innocent children of the people
entreating God for mercy. For since we condemn ourselves for sins, for
them that have sinned much and deserve to be blamed we ourselves cry;
but for ourselves the children; for the imitators of whose simplicity
the kingdom of heaven is reserved. For this image shows this, that they
who are like those children, lowly and simple, these above all men are
able to deliver the guilty by their prayers.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p70"></span>But the mystery itself, of how much
mercy, of how much love to man it is full, the initiated know.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p71"></span>Do thou then, when according to thy
power thou art showing mercy to a man, shut the doors, let the object of
thy mercy see it only; but if it be possible, not even he. But if thou
set them open, thou art profanely exposing thy mystery.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p72"></span>Consider that the very person, whose
praise thou seekest, even himself will condemn thee; and if he be a
friend, will accuse thee to himself; but if an enemy, he will deride
thee unto others also. And thou wilt undergo the opposite of what thou
desirest. For thou indeed desirest that he should call thee the merciful
man; but he will not call thee this, but the vainglorious, the
man-pleaser, and other names far more grievous than these.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p73"></span>But if thou shouldest hide it, he will
call thee all that is opposite to this; the merciful, the kind. For God
suffers it not to be hidden; but if thou conceal it, the other will make
it known, and greater will be the admiration, and more abundant the
gain. So that even for this very object of being glorified, to make a
display is against us; for with respect to the thing unto which we most
hasten and press, as to this most especially is this thing against us.
For so far from obtaining the credit of being merciful, we obtain even
the contrary, and besides this, great is the loss we undergo.

<span id="iii.LXVIII-p74"></span>For every motive then let us abstain
from this, and set our love on God’s praise alone. For thus shall we
both attain to honor here, and enjoy the eternal blessings, by the grace
and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and
might world without end. Amen.
