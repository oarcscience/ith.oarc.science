<span id="iii.XXXVII-p3"></span>*“And as they departed, Jesus began to
say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the
wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? But what went ye out for
to see? A man clothed in soft raiment; behold, they that wear soft
clothing are in kings’ houses. But what went ye out for to see? A
prophet?* <span id="fr_1559"></span>[1560](#fn_1559.md) *yea, I say unto
you, and more than a prophet.”*

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p5"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.XXXVII-p5.1"></span>For</span> the matter indeed of John’s
disciples had been ordered well, and they were gone away assured by the
miracles which had just been performed; but there was need after that of
remedy as regarded the people. For although they could not suspect
anything of the kind of their own master, the common people might from
the inquiry of John’s disciples form many strange suspicions, not
knowing the mind with which he sent his disciples. And it was natural
for them to reason with themselves, and say, “He that bore such abundant
witness, hath he now changed his persuasion, and doth he doubt whether
this or another be He that should come? Can it be, that in dissension
with Jesus he saith this? that the prison hath made him more timid? that
his former words were spoken vainly, and at random?” It being then
natural for them to suspect many such things, see how He corrects their
weakness, and removes these their suspicions. For “as they departed, He
began to say to the multitudes.” Why, “as they departed?” That He might
not seem to be flattering the man.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p6"></span>And in correcting the people, He doth
not publish their suspicion, but adds only the solution of the thoughts
that were mentally disturbing them: signifying that He knew the secrets
of all men. For He saith not, as unto the Jews, “Wherefore think ye
evil?” <span id="fr_1560"></span>[1561](#fn_1560.md) Because if they had it
in their minds, not of wickedness did they so reason, but of ignorance
on the points that had been spoken of. Wherefore neither doth He
discourse unto them in the way of rebuke, but merely sets right their
understanding, and defends John, and signifies that he is not fallen
away from his former opinion, neither is he changed, not being at all a
man easily swayed and fickle, but steadfast and sure, and far from being
such as to betray the things committed unto him.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p8"></span>And in establishing this, He employs not
at first his own sentence, but their former testimony, pointing out how
they bare record of his firmness, not by their words only, but also by
their deeds.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p9"></span>Wherefore He saith, “What went ye out
into the wilderness to see?” as though He had said, Wherefore did ye
leave your cities, and your houses, and come together all of you into
the wilderness? To see a pitiful and flexible kind of person? Nay, this
were out of all reason, this is not what is indicated by that
earnestness, and the concourse of all men unto the wilderness. So much
people and so many cities would not have poured themselves out with so
great zeal towards the wilderness and the river Jordan at that time, had
ye not expected to see some great and marvellous one, one firmer than
any rock. Yea, it was not “a reed” surely, that “ye went out to see
shaken by the wind:” for the flexible and such as are lightly brought
round, and now say one thing, now another, and stand firm in nothing,
are most like that.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p10"></span>And see how He omits all wickedness,
and mentions this, which then especially haunted <span
id="fr_1561"></span>[1562](#fn_1561.md) them; and removes the suspicion of
lightness.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p12"></span>“But what went ye out for to see? a man
clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that wear soft clothing are in
kings’ houses.” <span id="fr_1562"></span>[1563](#fn_1562.md)

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p14"></span>Now His meaning is like this: He was
not of himself a waverer; and this ye yourselves showed by your
earnestness. Much less could any one say this, that he was indeed firm,
but having made himself a slave to luxury, he afterwards became languid.
For among men, some are such as they are of themselves, others become
so; for instance, one man is passionate by nature, and another from
having fallen into a long illness gets this infirmity. Again, some men
are flexible <span id="page_239">p. 239</span> <span
id="iii.XXXVII-Page_239"></span> and fickle by nature, while others
become so by being slaves to luxury, and by living effeminately. “But
John,” saith He, “neither was such a character by nature, for neither
was it a reed that ye went out to see; nor by giving himself to luxury
did he lose the advantage he possessed.” For that he did not make
himself a slave to luxury, his garb shows, and the wilderness, and the
prison. Since, had he been minded to wear soft raiment, he would not
have lived in the wilderness, nor in the prison, but in the king’s
courts: it being in his power, merely by keeping silence, to have
enjoyed honor without limit. For since Herod so reverenced him, even
when he had rebuked him, and was in chains, much more would he have
courted him, had he held his peace. You see, he had indeed given proof
of his firmness and fortitude; and how could he justly incur suspicions
of that kind?

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p15"></span>2. When therefore as well by the place,
as by his garments, and by their concourse unto Him, He had delineated
his character, He proceeds to bring in the prophet. For having said,
“Why went ye out? To see a prophet? Yea I say unto you, and more than a
prophet;” <span id="fr_1563"></span>[1564](#fn_1563.md) He goes on, “For
this is he of whom it is written, <span
id="fr_1564"></span>[1565](#fn_1564.md) Behold, I send my messenger before
Thy face, which shall prepare Thy way before Thee.” <span
id="fr_1565"></span>[1566](#fn_1565.md) Having before set down the
testimony of the Jews, He then applies that of the prophets; or rather,
He puts in the first place the sentence of the Jews, which must have
been a very strong demonstration, the witness being borne by his
enemies; secondly, the man’s life; thirdly, His own judgment; fourthly,
the prophet; by all means stopping their mouths.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p19"></span>Then lest they should say, “But what if
at that time indeed he were such an one, but now is changed?” He added
also what follows; his garments, his prison, and together with these the
prophecy.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p20"></span>Then having said, that he is greater
than a prophet, He signifies also in what he is greater. And in what is
he greater? In being near Him that was come. For, “I send,” saith He,
“my messenger before Thy face;” that is, nigh Thee. For as with kings,
they who ride near the chariot, these are more illustrious than the
rest, just so John also appears in his course near the advent itself.
See how He signified John’s excellency by this also; and not even here
doth He stop, but adds afterwards His own suffrage as well, saying,
“Verily I say unto you, among them that are born of women, there hath
not arisen a greater than John the Baptist.” <span
id="fr_1566"></span>[1567](#fn_1566.md)

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p22"></span>Now what He said is like this: “woman
hath not borne a greater than this man.” And His very sentence is indeed
sufficient; but if thou art minded to learn from facts also, consider
his table, his manner of life, the height of his soul. <span
id="fr_1567"></span>[1568](#fn_1567.md) For he so lived as though he were
in heaven: and having got above the necessities of nature, he travelled
as it were a new way, spending all his time in hymns and prayers, and
holding intercourse with none among men, but with God alone continually.
For he did not so much as see any of his fellow-servants, neither was he
seen by any one of them; he fed not on milk, he enjoyed not the comfort
of bed, or roof, or market, or any other of the things of men; and yet
he was at once mild and earnest. Hear, for example, how considerately he
reasons with his own disciples, courageously with the people of the
Jews, how openly with the king. For this cause He said also, “There hath
not risen among them that are born of women a greater than John the
Baptist.”

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p24"></span>3. But lest the exceeding greatness of
His praises should produce a sort of extravagant feeling, the Jews
honoring John above Christ; mark how He corrects this also. For as the
things which edified His own disciples did harm to the multitudes, they
supposing Him an easy kind of person; so again the remedies employed for
the multitudes might have proved more mischievous, they deriving from
Christ’s words a more reverential opinion of John than of Himself.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p25"></span>Wherefore this also, in an unsuspected
way, He corrects by saying, “He that is less, <span
id="fr_1568"></span>[1569](#fn_1568.md) in the kingdom of Heaven is greater
than he.” Less in age, and according to the opinion of the multitude,
since they even called Him “a gluttonous man and a winebibber;” <span
id="fr_1569"></span>[1570](#fn_1569.md) and, “Is not this the carpenter’s
son?” <span id="fr_1570"></span>[1571](#fn_1570.md) and on every occasion
they used to make light of Him.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p29"></span>“What then?” it may be said, “is it by
comparison that He is greater than John?” Far from it. For neither when
John saith, “He is mightier than I,” <span
id="fr_1571"></span>[1572](#fn_1571.md) doth he say it as comparing them;
nor Paul, when remembering Moses he writes, “For this man was counted
worthy of more glory than Moses,” <span
id="fr_1572"></span>[1573](#fn_1572.md) doth he so write by way of
comparison; and He Himself too, in saying, “Behold, a greater than <span
id="page_240">p. 240</span> <span id="iii.XXXVII-Page_240"></span>
Solomon is here,” <span id="fr_1573"></span>[1574](#fn_1573.md) speaks not
as making a comparison.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p33"></span>Or if we should even grant that this
was said by Him in the way of comparison, this was done in
condescension, <span id="fr_1574"></span>[1575](#fn_1574.md) because of the
weakness of the hearers. For the men really had their gaze very much
fixed upon John; and then he was rendered the more illustrious both by
his imprisonment, and by his plainness of speech to the king; and it was
a great point for the present, that even so much should be received
among the multitude. And so too, the Old Testament uses in the same way
to correct the souls of the erring, by putting together in a way of
comparison things that cannot be compared; as when it saith, “Among the
gods there is none like unto Thee, O Lord:” <span
id="fr_1575"></span>[1576](#fn_1575.md) and again, “There is no god like
our God.” <span id="fr_1576"></span>[1577](#fn_1576.md)

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p37"></span>Now some affirm, that Christ said this
of the apostles, others again, of angels. <span
id="fr_1577"></span>[1578](#fn_1577.md) Thus, when any have turned aside
from the truth, they are wont to wander many ways. For what sort of
connexion hath it, to speak either of angels or of apostles? And
besides, if He were speaking of the apostles, what hindered his bringing
them forward by name? whereas, when He is speaking of Himself, He
naturally conceals His person, because of the still prevailing
suspicion, and that He may not seem to say anything great of Himself;
yea, and we often find Him doing so.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p40"></span>But what is, “In the kingdom of
heaven?” Among spiritual beings, and all them that are in heaven.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p41"></span>And moreover His saying, “There hath
not risen among them that are born of women a greater than John,” suited
one contrasting John with Himself, and thus tacitly excepting Himself.
For though He too were born of a woman, yet not as John, for He was not
a mere man, neither was He born in like manner as a man, but by a
strange and wondrous kind of birth.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p42"></span>4. “And from the days of John the
Baptist,” saith He, “until now, the kingdom of heaven suffereth
violence, and the violent take it by force.” <span
id="fr_1578"></span>[1579](#fn_1578.md)

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p44"></span>And what sort of connexion may this
have with what was said before? Much, assuredly, and in full accordance
therewith. Yea, by this topic also He proceeds to urge and press them
into the faith of Himself; and at the same time likewise, He is speaking
in agreement with what had been before said by John. “For if all things
are fulfilled even down to John, I am “He that should come.”

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p45"></span>“For all the prophets,” saith He, “and
the law prophesied until John.” <span
id="fr_1579"></span>[1580](#fn_1579.md)

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p47"></span>For the prophets would not have ceased,
unless I were come. Expect therefore nothing further, neither wait for
any one else. For that I am He is manifest both from the prophets
ceasing, and from those that every day “take by force” the faith that is
in me. For so manifest is it and certain, that many even take it by
force. Why, who hath so taken it? tell me. All who approach it with
earnestness of mind.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p48"></span>Then He states also another infallible
sign, saying, “If ye will receive it, he is Elias, which was for to
come.” For “I will send you,” it is said, “Elias the Tishbite, who shall
turn the heart of the father to the children.” <span
id="fr_1580"></span>[1581](#fn_1580.md) This man then is Elias, if ye
attend exactly, saith He. For “I will send,” saith He, “my messenger
before Thy face.” <span id="fr_1581"></span>[1582](#fn_1581.md)

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p51"></span>And well hath He said, “If ye will
receive it,” to show the absence of force. For I do not constrain, saith
He. And this He said, as requiring a candid mind, and showing that John
is Elias, and Elias John. For both of them received one ministry, and
both of them became forerunners. Wherefore neither did He simply say,
“This is Elias,” but, “If ye are willing to receive it, this is he,”
that is, if with a candid mind ye give heed to what is going on. And He
did not stop even at this, but to the words, “This is Elias, which was
for to come,” He added, to show that understanding is needed, He that
hath ears to hear, let him hear.” <span
id="fr_1582"></span>[1583](#fn_1582.md)

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p53"></span>Now He used so many dark sayings, to
stir them up to inquiry. And if not even so were they awakened, much
more, had all been plain and clear. For this surely no man could say,
that they dared not ask Him, and that He was difficult of approach. For
they that were asking him questions, and <span id="page_241">p.
241</span> <span id="iii.XXXVII-Page_241"></span> tempting Him about
common matters, and whose mouths were stopped a thousand times, yet they
did not withdraw from Him; how should they but have inquired of Him, and
besought Him touching the indispensable things, had they indeed been
desirous to learn? For if concerning the matters of the law they asked,
“Which is the first commandment,” and all such questions, although there
was of course no need of His telling them that; how should they but ask
the meaning of what He Himself said, for which also He was bound to give
account in His answers? And especially when it was He Himself that was
encouraging and drawing them on to do this. For by saying, “The violent
take it by force,” He stirs them up to earnestness of mind; and by
saying, “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear,” He doth just the same
thing.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p54"></span>5. “But whereunto shall I liken this
generation?” saith He, “It is like unto children sitting in the market
place, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we
have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.” <span
id="fr_1583"></span>[1584](#fn_1583.md) This again seems to be unconnected
with what came before, but it is the most natural consequence thereof.
Yea, He still keeps to the same point, the showing that John is acting
in harmony with Himself, although the results were opposite; as indeed
with respect to his inquiry also. And He implies that there was nothing
that ought to have been done for their salvation, and was omitted; which
thing the prophet <span id="fr_1584"></span>[1585](#fn_1584.md) saith of
the vineyard; “What ought I to have done to this vineyard, and have not
done it? For whereunto,” saith He, “shall I liken this generation? It is
like unto children sitting in the market, and saying, We have piped unto
you, and ye have not danced, we have mourned unto you, and ye have not
lamented. For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He
hath a devil. <span id="fr_1585"></span>[1586](#fn_1585.md) The Son of Man
came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a
winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.” <span
id="fr_1586"></span>[1587](#fn_1586.md)

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p59"></span>Now what He saith is like this: We have
come each of us an opposite way, I and John; and we have done just as if
it were some hunters with a wild beast that was hard to catch, and which
might by two ways fall into the toils; as if each of the two were to cut
it off his several way, and drive it, taking his stand opposite to the
other; so that it must needs fall into one of the two snares. Mark, for
instance, the whole race of man, how it is astonished at the wonder of
men’s fasting, and at this hard and self-denying life. For this reason
it had been so ordered, that John should be thus brought up from his
earliest youth, so that hereby (among other things) his sayings might
obtain credit.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p60"></span>But wherefore, it may be asked, did not
He Himself choose that way? In the first place He did also Himself
proceed by it, when He fasted the forty days, and went about teaching,
and not having where to lay His head. Nevertheless He did also in
another mode accomplish this same object, and provide for the advantage
thence accruing. For to be testified of by him that came this way was
the same thing, or even a much greater thing than to have come this way
Himself.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p61"></span>And besides, John indeed exhibited no
more than his life and conversation; for “John,” it is said, “did no
sign,” <span id="fr_1587"></span>[1588](#fn_1587.md) but He Himself had the
testimony also from signs and from miracles. Leaving therefore John to
be illustrious by his fasting, He Himself came the opposite way, both
coming unto publicans’ tables, and eating and drinking.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p63"></span>Let us ask the Jews then, “Is fasting a
good thing, and to be admired? you should then have obeyed John, and
received him, and believed his sayings. For so would those sayings have
led you towards Jesus. Is fasting, on the other hand, a thing grievous,
and burdensome? then should you have obeyed Jesus, and have believed in
Him that came the opposite way. Thus, either way, ye would have found
yourselves in the kingdom.” But, like an intractable wild beast, they
were speaking evil of both. The fault is not then theirs who were not
believed, but they are to be blamed who did not believe. For no man
would ever choose to speak evil of opposite things, any more than he
would on the other hand commend them. I mean thus: he that approves the
cheerful and free character, will not approve him that is sad and grave;
he that commends the man of a sad countenance will not commend the
cheerful man. For it is a thing impossible to give your vote both ways
at once. Therefore also He saith, “We have piped unto you, and ye have
not danced;” that is, “I have exhibited the freer kind of life, and ye
obeyed not:” and, “We have mourned, and ye have not lamented;” that is,
“John followed the rugged and grave life, and ye took no heed.” And He
saith not, “he this, I that,” but the purpose of both being one,
although their <span id="page_242">p. 242</span> <span
id="iii.XXXVII-Page_242"></span> modes of life were opposite, for this
cause He speaks of their doings as common. Yea, for even their coming by
opposite ways arose out of a most exact accordance, such as continued
looking to one and the same end. What sort of excuse then can ye have
after all this?

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p64"></span>Wherefore He subjoined, “And wisdom is
justified of her children;” <span id="fr_1588"></span>[1589](#fn_1588.md)
that is, though ye be not persuaded, yet with me after this ye cannot
find fault. As the prophet saith touching the Father, “That Thou
mightest be justified in Thy sayings.” <span
id="fr_1589"></span>[1590](#fn_1589.md) For God, though He should effect
nothing more by His care over us, fulfills all His part, so as to leave
to them that will be shameless not so much as a shadow of excuse for
uncandid doubt.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p67"></span>And if the similitudes be mean, and of
an ill sound, marvel not, for He was discoursing with a view to the
weakness of His hearers. Since Ezekiel too mentions many similitudes
like them, and unworthy of God’s majesty. <span
id="fr_1590"></span>[1591](#fn_1590.md) But this too especially becomes His
tender care.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p69"></span>And mark them, how in another respect
also they are carried about into contradictory opinions. For whereas
they had said of John, “he hath a devil,” <span
id="fr_1591"></span>[1592](#fn_1591.md) they stopped not at this, but said
the very same again concerning Him, <span
id="fr_1592"></span>[1593](#fn_1592.md) taking as He did the opposite
course; thus were they forever carried about into conflicting opinions.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p72"></span>But Luke herewith sets down also
another and a heavier charge against them, saying, “For the publicans
justified God, having received the baptism of John.” <span
id="fr_1593"></span>[1594](#fn_1593.md)

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p74"></span>6. Then He proceeds to upbraid the
cities now that wisdom hath been justified; now that He hath shown all
to be fully performed. That is, having failed to persuade them, He now
doth but lament over them; which is more than terrifying. For He had
exhibited both His teaching by His words, and His wonder-working power
by His signs. But forasmuch as they abode in their own unbelief, He now
does but upbraid.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p75"></span>For “then,” it is said, “began Jesus to
upbraid the cities, wherein most of His mighty works were done, because
they repented not; saying, Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee,
Bethsaida!” <span id="fr_1594"></span>[1595](#fn_1594.md)

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p77"></span>Then, to show thee that they are not
such by nature, He states also the name of the city out of which
proceeded five apostles. For both Philip, and those two pairs of the
chief apostles, were from thence. <span
id="fr_1595"></span>[1596](#fn_1595.md)

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p79"></span>“For if,” saith He, “the mighty works
which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have
repented in sackcloth and ashes. But I say unto you, It shall be more
tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, at the day of judgment, than for you. And
thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to
hell, <span id="fr_1596"></span>[1597](#fn_1596.md) for if the mighty works
which have been done in thee had been done in Sodom, it would have
remained until this day. But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable
for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.” <span
id="fr_1597"></span>[1598](#fn_1597.md)

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p82"></span>And He adds not Sodom with the others
for nought, but to aggravate the charge against them. Yea, for it is a
very great proof of wickedness, when not only of them that now are, but
even of all those that ever were wicked, none are found so bad as they.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p83"></span>Thus elsewhere also He makes a
comparison, condemning them by the Ninevites, and by the Queen of the
south; there, however, it was by them that did right, here, even by them
that sinned; a thing far more grievous. With this law of condemnation,
Ezekiel too was acquainted: wherefore also he said to Jerusalem, “Thou
hast justified thy sisters in all thy sins.” <span
id="fr_1598"></span>[1599](#fn_1598.md) Thus everywhere is He wont to
linger in the Old Testament, as in a favored place. And not even at this
doth He stay His speech, but makes their fears yet more intense, by
saying, that they should suffer things more grievous than Sodomites and
Tyrians, so as by every means to gather them in, both by bewailing, and
by alarming them.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p85"></span>7. To these same things let us also
listen: since not for the unbelievers only, but for us also, hath He
appointed a punishment more grievous than that of the Sodomites, if we
will not receive the strangers that come in unto us; I mean, when He
commanded to shake off the very dust: and very fitly. For as to the
Sodomites, although they committed a great transgression, yet it was
before the law and grace; but we, after so much care shown towards us,
of what indulgence should we be worthy, showing so much inhospitality,
and shutting our doors against them that are in need, and before our
doors our ears? or rather not against the poor only, but against the
apostles themselves? For therefore we <span id="page_243">p. 243</span>
<span id="iii.XXXVII-Page_243"></span> do it to the poor, because we do
it to the very apostles. For whereas Paul is read, and thou attendest
not; whereas John preaches, and thou hearest not: when wilt thou receive
a poor man, who wilt not receive an apostle?

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p86"></span>In order then that both our houses may
be continually open to the one, and our ears to the others, let us purge
away the filth from the ears of our soul. For as filth and mud close up
the ears of our flesh, so do the harlot’s songs, and worldly news, and
debts, and the business of usury and loans, close up the ear of the
mind, worse than any filth; nay rather, they do not close it up only,
but also make it unclean. And they are putting dung in your ears, who
tell you of these things. And that which the barbarian threatened,
saying, “Ye shall eat your own dung,” and what follows; <span
id="fr_1599"></span>[1600](#fn_1599.md) this do these men also make you
undergo, not in word, but in deeds; or rather, somewhat even much worse.
For truly those songs are more loathsome even than all this; and what is
yet worse, so far from feeling annoyance when ye hear them, ye rather
laugh, when ye ought to abominate them and fly.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p88"></span>But if they be not abominable, go down
unto the stage, imitate that which thou praisest; or rather, do thou
merely take a walk with him that is exciting that laugh. Nay, thou
couldest not bear it. Why then bestow on him so great honor? Yea, while
the laws that are enacted by the Gentiles would have them to be
dishonored, thou receivest them with thy whole city, like ambassadors
and generals, and dost convoke all men, to receive dung in their ears.
And thy servant, if he say anything filthy in thy hearing, will receive
stripes in abundance; and be it a son, a wife, whoever it may, that doth
as I have said, thou callest the act an affront; but if worthless
fellows, that deserve the scourge, should invite thee to hear the filthy
words, not only art thou not indignant, thou dost even rejoice and
applaud. And what could be equal to this folly?

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p89"></span>But dost thou thyself never utter these
base words? Why what is the profit? or rather, this very fact, whence is
it manifest? For if thou didst not utter these things, neither wouldest
thou at all laugh at hearing them, nor wouldest thou run with such zeal
to the voice that makes thee ashamed.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p90"></span>For tell me, art thou pleased at
hearing men blaspheme? Dost thou not rather shudder, and stop thine
ears? Surely I think thou dost. Why so? Because thou blasphemest not
thyself. Just so do thou act with respect to filthy talking also; and if
thou wouldest show us clearly, that thou hast no pleasure in filthy
speaking, endure not so much as to hear them. For when wilt thou be able
to become good, bred up as thou art with such sounds in thine ears? When
wilt thou venture to undergo such labors as chastity requires, now that
thou art falling gradually away through this laughter, these songs, and
filthy words? Yea, it is a great thing for a soul that keeps itself pure
from all this, to be able to become grave and chaste; how much more for
one that is nourished up in such hearings? Know ye not, that we are of
the two more inclined to evil? While then we make it even an art, and a
business, when shall we escape that furnace?

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p91"></span>8. Heardest thou not what Paul saith,
“Rejoice in the Lord?” <span id="fr_1600"></span>[1601](#fn_1600.md) He
said not, “in the devil.” When then wilt thou be able to hear Paul?
when, to gain a sense of thy wrong actions? drunken as thou art, ever
and incessantly, with the spectacle I was speaking of. For thy having
come here is nothing wonderful nor great; or rather it is wonderful. For
here thou comest any how, and so as just to satisfy a scruple, <span
id="fr_1601"></span>[1602](#fn_1601.md) but there with diligence and speed,
and great readiness. And it is evident from what thou bringest home, on
returning thence.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p94"></span>For even all the mire that is there
poured out for you, by the speeches, by the songs, by the laughter, ye
collect and take every man to his home, or rather not to his home only,
but every man even into his own mind.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p95"></span>And from things not worthy of
abhorrence thou turnest away; while others which are to be abhorred, so
far from hating, thou dost even court. Many, for instance, on coming
back from tombs, are used to wash themselves, but on returning from
theatres they have never groaned, nor poured forth any fountains of
tears; yet surely the dead man is no unclean thing, whereas sin induces
such a blot, that not even with ten thousand fountains could one purge
it away, but with tears only, and with confessions. But no one hath any
sense of this blot. Thus because we fear not what we ought, therefore we
shrink from what we ought not.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p96"></span>And what again is the applause? what
the <span id="page_244">p. 244</span> <span
id="iii.XXXVII-Page_244"></span> tumult, and the satanical cries, and
the devilish gestures? For first one, being a young man, wears his hair
long behind, and changing his nature into that of a woman, is striving
both in aspect, and in gesture, and in garments, and generally in all
ways, to pass into the likeness of a tender damsel. <span
id="fr_1602"></span>[1603](#fn_1602.md) Then another who is grown old, in
the opposite way to this, having his hair shaven, and with his loins
girt about, his shame cut off before his hair, stands ready to be
smitten with the rod, prepared both to say and do anything. The women
again, their heads uncovered, stand without a blush, discoursing with a
whole people, so complete is their practice in shamelessness; and thus
pour forth all effrontery and impurity into the souls of their hearers.
And their one study is, to pluck up all chastity from the foundations,
to disgrace our nature, to satiate the desire of the wicked demon. Yea,
and there are both foul sayings, and gestures yet fouler; and the
dressing of the hair tends that way, and the gait, and apparel, and
voice, and flexure of the limbs; and there are turnings of the eyes, and
flutes, and pipes, and dramas, and plots; and all things, in short, full
of the most extreme impurity. When then wilt thou be sober again, I pray
thee, now that the devil is pouring out for thee so much of the strong
wine of whoredom, mingling so many cups of unchastity? For indeed both
adulteries and stolen marriages are there, and there are women playing
the harlot, men prostituting, youths corrupting themselves: all there is
iniquity to the full, all sorcery, all shame. Wherefore they that sit by
should not laugh at these things, but weep and groan bitterly.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p98"></span>“What then? Are we to shut up the
stage?” it will be said, “and are all things to be turned upside down at
thy word?” Nay, but as it is, all things are turned upside down. For
whence are they, tell me, that plot against our marriages? Is it not
from this theatre? Whence are they that dig through into chambers? Is it
not from that stage? Comes it not of this, when husbands are
insupportable to their wives? of this, when the wives are contemptible
to their husbands? of this, that the more part are adulterers? So that
the subverter of all things is he that goes to the theatre; it is he
that brings in a grievous tyranny. “Nay,” thou wilt say, “this is
appointed by the good order of the laws.” Why, to tear away men’s wives,
and to insult young boys, and to overthrow houses, is proper to those
who have seized on citadels. <span id="fr_1603"></span>[1604](#fn_1603.md)
“And what adulterer,” wilt thou say, “hath been made such by these
spectacles?” Nay, who hath not been made an adulterer? And if one might
but mention them now by name, I could point out how many husbands those
harlots have severed from their wives, how many they have taken captive,
drawing some even from the marriage bed itself, not suffering others so
much as to live at all in marriage.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p100"></span>“What then? I pray thee, are we to
overthrow all the laws?” Nay, but it is overthrowing lawlessness, if we
do away with these spectacles. For hence are they that make havoc in our
cities; hence, for example, are seditions and tumults. For they that are
maintained by the dancers, and who sell their own voice to the belly,
whose work it is to shout, and to practise everything that is monstrous,
these especially are the men that stir up the populace, that make the
tumults in our cities. For youth, when it hath joined hands with
idleness, and is brought up in so great evils, becomes fiercer than any
wild beast. The necromancers too, I pray thee, whence are they? Is it
not from hence, that in order to excite the people who are idling
without object, and make the dancing men have the benefit of much and
loud applause, and fortify the harlot women against the chaste, they
proceed so far in sorcery, as not even to shrink from disturbing the
bones of the dead? Comes it not hence, when men are forced to spend
without limit on that wicked choir of the devil? And lasciviousness,
whence is that, and its innumerable mischiefs? Thou seest, it is thou
who art subverting our life, by drawing men to these things, while I am
recruiting it by putting them down.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p101"></span>“Let us then pull down the stage,” say
they. Would that it were possible to pull it down; or rather, if ye be
willing, as far as regards us, it is pulled down, and digged up.
Nevertheless, I enjoin no such thing. Standing as these places are, I
bid you make them of no effect; which thing were a greater praise than
pulling them down.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p102"></span>9. Imitate at least the barbarians, if
no one else; for they verily are altogether clean from seeking such
sights. What excuse then can we have after all this, we, the citizens of
Heaven, and partners in the choirs of the cherubim, and in fellowship
with the angels, making ourselves in this respect worse even than the
barbarians, and this, when innumerable other pleasures, better than
these, are within our reach?

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span> <span id="iii.XXXVII-Page_245"></span>

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p103"></span>Why, if thou desirest that thy soul
may find delight, go to pleasure grounds, to a river flowing by, and to
lakes, take notice of gardens, listen to grasshoppers as they sing, be
continually by the coffins of martyrs, where is health of body and
benefit of soul, and no hurt, no remorse after the pleasure, as there is
here.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p104"></span>Thou hast a wife, thou hast children;
what is equal to this pleasure? Thou hast a house, thou hast friends,
these are the true delights: besides their purity, great is the
advantage they bestow. For what, I pray thee, is sweeter than children?
what sweeter than a wife, to him that will be chaste in mind?

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p105"></span>To this purpose, we are told, that the
barbarians uttered on some occasion a saying full of wise severity. I
mean, that having heard of these wicked spectacles, and the unseasonable
delight of them; “why the Romans,” say they, “have devised these
pleasures, as though they had not wives and children;” implying that
nothing is sweeter than children and wife, if thou art willing to live
honestly.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p106"></span>“What then,” one may say, “if I point
to some, who are nothing hurt by their pastime in that place?” In the
first place, even this is a hurt, to spend one’s time without object or
fruit, and to become an offense to others. For even if thou shouldest
not be hurt, thou makest some other more eager herein. And how canst
thou but be thyself hurt, giving occasion to what goes on? Yea, both the
fortune-teller, and the prostitute boy, and the harlot woman, and all
those choirs of the devil, cast upon thy head the blame of their
proceedings. For as surely as, if there were no spectators, there would
be none to follow these employments; so, since there are, they too have
their share of the fire due to such deeds. So that even if in chastity
thou wert quite unhurt (a thing impossible), yet for others’ ruin thou
wilt render a grievous account; both the spectators’, and that of those
who assemble them.

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p107"></span>And in chastity too thou wouldest
profit more, didst thou refrain from going thither. For if even now thou
art chaste, thou wouldest have become chaster by avoiding such sights.
Let us not then delight in useless argument, nor devise unprofitable
apologies: there being but one apology, to flee from the Babylonian
furnace, to keep far from the Egyptian harlot, though one must escape
her hands naked. <span id="fr_1604"></span>[1605](#fn_1604.md)

<span id="iii.XXXVII-p109"></span>For so shall we both enjoy much
delight, our conscience not accusing us, and we shall live this present
life with chastity, and attain unto the good things to come, by the
grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ; to whom be glory
and might, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.

Saviour; that he who is less in time is greater in dignity. But let us
simply understand, that every Saint who is already with God is greater
than he whose post is yet in the battle. For it is one thing to possess
the crown of victory, another still to fight in the battle. Some will
take it that the lowest angel serving God in Heaven is greater than any,

“He is of course set above men; on the other, because he had declared

lesser in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he*: that you might know
he could not compare with the angels.” St. Ambr. on St. Luke, vii. 27;
