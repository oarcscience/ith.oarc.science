<span id="iii.L-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.L-p2.1"></span>[Matt. 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#024.md)<span
id="iii.L-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="iii.L-p3"></span>*“And when He had sent the multitudes away,
He went up into the mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was
come, He was there alone. But the ship was now in the midst of the sea,
tossed with waves:* <span id="fr_1951"></span>[1952](#fn_1951.md) *for the
wind was contrary.”*

<span id="iii.L-p5"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.L-p5.1"></span>For</span> what purpose doth He go up into the
mountain? To teach us, that loneliness and retirement is good, when we
are to pray to God. With this view, you see, He is continually
withdrawing into the wilderness, and there often spends the whole night
in prayer, teaching us earnestly to seek such quietness in our prayers,
as the time and place may confer. For the wilderness is the mother of
quiet; it is a calm and a harbor, delivering us from all turmoils.

<span id="iii.L-p6"></span>He Himself then went up thither with this
object, but the disciples are tossed with the waves again, and undergo a
storm, equal even to the former. But whereas before they had Him in the
ship when this befell them, now they were alone by themselves. Thus
gently and by degrees He excites and urges them on for the better, even
to the bearing all nobly. Accordingly we see, that when they were first
near that danger, He was present, though asleep, so as readily to give
them relief; but now leading them to a greater degree of endurance, He
doth not even this, but departs, and in mid sea permits the storm to
arise, so that they might not so much as look for a hope of preservation
from any quarter; and He lets them be tempest-tost all the night,
thoroughly to awaken, as I suppose, their hardened heart.

<span id="iii.L-p7"></span>For such is the nature of the fear, which the
time concurs with the rough weather in producing. And together with the
compunction, He cast them also into a greater longing for Himself, and a
continual remembrance of Him.

<span id="iii.L-p8"></span>Accordingly, neither did He present Himself
to them at once. For, “in the fourth watch,” so it is said, “of the
night, He went unto them, walking upon the sea;” <span
id="fr_1952"></span>[1953](#fn_1952.md) instructing them not hastily to
seek for deliverance; from their pressing dangers, but to bear all
occurrences manfully. At all events, when they looked to be delivered,
then was their fear again heightened. For,

<span id="iii.L-p10"></span>“When the disciples,” it is said, “saw Him
walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit: and they
cried out for fear.” <span id="fr_1953"></span>[1954](#fn_1953.md)

<span id="iii.L-p12"></span>Yea, and He constantly doth so; when He is
on the point of removing our terrors, He brings upon us other worse
things, and more alarming: which we see took place then also. For
together with the storm, the sight too troubled them, no less than the
storm. Therefore neither did He remove the darkness, nor straightway
make Himself manifest, training them, as I said, by the continuance of
these fears, and instructing them to be ready to endure. This He did in
the case of Job also; for when He was on the point of removing the
terror and the temptation, then He suffered the end to grow more
grievous; I mean not for his children’s death, or the words of his wife,
but because of the reproaches, both of his servants and of his friends.
And when He was about to rescue Jacob from his affliction in the strange
land, He allowed his trouble to be awakened and aggravated: in that his
father-in-law first overtook him and threatened death, and then his
brother coming immediately after, suspended over him the extremest
danger.

<span id="iii.L-p13"></span>For since one cannot be tempted both for a
long time and severely; when the righteous are on the point of coming to
an end of their conflicts, He, willing them to gain the more, enhances
their struggles. Which He did in the case of Abraham too, appointing for
his last conflict that about his child. For thus even things intolerable
will be tolerable, when they are so brought upon us, as to have their
removal near, at the very doors.

<span id="iii.L-p14"></span>So did Christ at that time also, and did not
discover Himself before they cried out. For the more intense their
alarm, the more did they welcome His coming. Afterward when they had
exclaimed, it is said,

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span> <span id="iii.L-Page_301"></span>

<span id="iii.L-p15"></span>“Straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying,
Be of good cheer, it is I; be not afraid.” <span
id="fr_1954"></span>[1955](#fn_1954.md)

<span id="iii.L-p17"></span>This word removed their fear, and caused
them to take confidence. For as they knew Him not by sight, because of
His marvellous kind of motion, and because of the time, He makes Himself
manifest by His voice.

<span id="iii.L-p18"></span>2. What then saith Peter, everywhere ardent,
and ever starting forward before the rest?

<span id="iii.L-p19"></span>“Lord, if it be Thou,” saith he, “bid me
come unto Thee on the water.” <span id="fr_1955"></span>[1956](#fn_1955.md)

<span id="iii.L-p21"></span>He said not, “Pray and entreat,” but, “bid.”
Seest thou how great his ardor, how great his faith? Yet surely he is
hereby often in danger, by seeking things beyond his measure. For so
here too he required an exceedingly great thing, for love only, not for
display. For neither did he say, “Bid me walk on the water,” but what?
“Bid me come unto Thee.” For none so loved Jesus.

<span id="iii.L-p22"></span>This he did also after the resurrection; he
endured not to come with the others, but leapt forward. <span
id="fr_1956"></span>[1957](#fn_1956.md) And not love only, but faith also
doth he display. For he not only believed that He was able Himself to
walk on the sea, but that He could lead upon it others also; and he
longs to be quickly near Him.

<span id="iii.L-p24"></span>“And he said, Come. And when Peter was come
down out of the ship, he walked on the water, and came <span
id="fr_1957"></span>[1958](#fn_1957.md) to Jesus. But when he saw the wind
boisterous, <span id="fr_1958"></span>[1959](#fn_1958.md) he was afraid;
and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately
Jesus stretched forth His hand and caught him, and saith unto him, O
thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?” <span
id="fr_1959"></span>[1960](#fn_1959.md)

<span id="iii.L-p28"></span>This is more wonderful than the former.
Therefore this is done after that. For when He had shown that He rules
the sea, then He carries on the sign to what is yet more marvellous.
Then He rebuked the winds only; but now He both walks Himself, and
permits another to do so; which thing if He had required to be done at
the beginning, Peter would not have so well received it, because he had
not yet acquired so great faith.

<span id="iii.L-p29"></span>Wherefore then did Christ permit him? Why,
if He had said, “thou canst not,” Peter being ardent would have
contradicted Him again. Wherefore by the facts He convinces him, that
for the future he may be sobered.

<span id="iii.L-p30"></span>But not even so doth he endure. Therefore
having come down, he becomes dizzy; for he was afraid. And this the surf
caused, but his fear was wrought by the wind.

<span id="iii.L-p31"></span>But John saith, that “they willingly
received Him into the ship; and immediately the ship was at the land
whither they went,” <span id="fr_1960"></span>[1961](#fn_1960.md) relating
this same circumstance. So that when they were on the point of arriving
at the land, He entered the ship.

<span id="iii.L-p33"></span>Peter then having come down from the ship
went unto Him, not rejoicing so much in walking on the water, as in
coming unto Him. And when he had prevailed over the greater, he was on
the point of suffering evil from the less, from the violence of the
wind, I mean, not of the sea. For such a thing is human nature; not
seldom effecting great things, it exposes itself in the less; as Elias
felt toward Jezebel, as Moses toward the Egyptian, as David toward
Bathsheba. Even so then this man also; while their fear was yet at the
height, he took courage to walk upon the water, but against the assault
of the wind he was no longer able to stand; and this, being near Christ.
So absolutely nothing doth it avail to be near Christ, not being near
Him by faith.

<span id="iii.L-p34"></span>And this also showed the difference between
the Master and the disciple, and allayed the feelings of the others. For
if in the case of the two brethren they had indignation, much more here;
for they had not yet the Spirit vouchsafed unto them.

<span id="iii.L-p35"></span>But afterwards they were not like this. On
every occasion, for example, they give up the first honors to Peter, and
put him forward in their addresses to the people, although of a rougher
vein than any of them. <span id="fr_1961"></span>[1962](#fn_1961.md)

<span id="iii.L-p37"></span>And wherefore did He not command the winds
to cease, but Himself stretched forth His hand and took hold of him?
Because in him faith was required. For when our part is wanting, then
God’s part also is at a stand.

<span id="iii.L-p38"></span>Signifying therefore that not the assault of
the wind, but his want of faith had wrought his overthrow, He saith,
“Wherefore didst thou doubt, O thou of little faith?” So that if his
faith had not been weak, he would have stood easily against the wind
also. And for this reason, you see, even when He had caught hold of Him,
He suffers the wind to blow, showing that no hurt comes thereby, when
faith is steadfast.

<span id="iii.L-p39"></span>And as when a nestling has come out of the
nest before the time, and is on the point of falling, its mother bears
it on her wings, and brings it back to the nest; even so did Christ.

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span> <span id="iii.L-Page_302"></span>

<span id="iii.L-p40"></span>“And when they were come into the ship, then
the wind ceased.” <span id="fr_1962"></span>[1963](#fn_1962.md)

<span id="iii.L-p42"></span>Whereas before this they had said, “What
manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him!” <span
id="fr_1963"></span>[1964](#fn_1963.md) now it is not so. For “they that
were in the ship,” it is said, “came and worshipped Him, saying, Of a
truth Thou art Son of God.” <span id="fr_1964"></span>[1965](#fn_1964.md)
Seest thou, how by degrees he was leading them all higher and higher?
For both by His walking on the sea, and by His commanding another to do
so, and preserving him in jeopardy; their faith was henceforth great.
For then indeed He rebuked the sea, but now He rebukes it not, in
another way signifying His power more abundantly. Wherefore also they
said, “Of a truth Thou art Son of God.”

<span id="iii.L-p45"></span>What then? Did He rebuke them on their so
speaking? Nay, quite the contrary, He rather confirmed what they said,
with greater authority healing such as approached Him, and not as
before.

<span id="iii.L-p46"></span>“And when they were gone over,” so it is
said, “they came into the land of Gennesaret. And when the men of that
place had knowledge of Him, they sent out into all that country round
about, and brought unto Him all that were diseased; and besought Him
that they might touch the hem of His garment; and as many as touched
were made perfectly whole.” <span id="fr_1965"></span>[1966](#fn_1965.md)

<span id="iii.L-p48"></span>For neither did they approach Him as before,
dragging Him into their houses, and seeking a touch of His hand, and
directions from Him in words; but in a far higher strain, and with more
of self-denial, and with a more abundant faith did they try to win
themselves a cure; for she that had the issue of blood taught them all
to be severe in seeking wisdom.

<span id="iii.L-p49"></span>And the evangelist, implying also that at
long intervals He visited the several neighborhoods, saith, “The men of
that place took knowledge of Him, and sent out into the country round
about, and brought unto Him them that were diseased.” But yet the
interval, so far from abolishing their faith, made it even greater, and
preserved it in vigor.

<span id="iii.L-p50"></span>3. Let us also then touch the hem of His
garment, or rather, if we be willing, we have Him entire. For indeed His
body is set before us now, not His garment only, but even His body; not
for us to touch it only, but also to eat, and be filled. Let us now then
draw near with faith, every one that hath an infirmity. For if they that
touched the hem of His garment drew from Him so much virtue, how much
more they that possess Him entire? Now to draw near with faith is not
only to receive the offering, but also with a pure heart to touch it; to
be so minded, as approaching Christ Himself. For what, if thou hear no
voice? Yet thou seest Him laid out; or rather thou dost also hear His
voice, while He is speaking by the evangelists.

<span id="iii.L-p51"></span>Believe, therefore, that even now it is that
supper, at which He Himself sat down. For this is in no respect
different from that. For neither doth man make this and Himself the
other; but both this and that is His own work. When therefore thou seest
the priest delivering it unto thee, account not that it is the priest
that doeth so, but that it is Christ’s hand that is stretched out.

<span id="iii.L-p52"></span>Even as when he baptizes, not he doth
baptize thee, but it is God that possesses thy head with invisible
power, and neither angel nor archangel nor any other dare draw nigh and
touch thee; even so now also. For when God begets, the gift is His only.
Seest thou not those who adopt to themselves sons here, how they commit
not the act to slaves, but are themselves present at the judgment-seat?
Even so neither hath God committed His gift to angels, but Himself is
present, commanding and saying, “Call no man Father on earth;” <span
id="fr_1966"></span>[1967](#fn_1966.md) not that thou shouldest dishonor
them that gave thee birth, but that thou shouldest prefer to all those
Him that made thee, and enrolled thee amongst His own children. For He
that hath given the greater, that is, hath set Himself before thee, much
more will He not think scorn to distribute unto thee of His body. Let us
hear therefore, both priests and subjects, what we have had vouchsafed
to us; let us hear and tremble. Of His own holy flesh He hath granted us
our fill; He hath set before us Himself sacrificed.

<span id="iii.L-p54"></span>What excuse shall we have then, when feeding
on such food, we commit such sins? when eating a lamb, we become wolves?
when feeding on a sheep, we spoil by violence like the lions?

<span id="iii.L-p55"></span>For this mystery He directs to be always
clear, not from violence only, but even from bare enmity. Yea, for this
mystery is a mystery of peace; it allows us not to cling to wealth. For
if He spared not Himself for us, what must we deserve, sparing our
wealth, and being lavish of a soul, in behalf of which He spared not
Himself?

<span id="iii.L-p56"></span>Now upon the Jews God every year bound <span
id="page_303">p. 303</span> <span id="iii.L-Page_303"></span> in their
feasts a memorial of His peculiar favors to them: but for thee, every
day, as I may say, through these mysteries.

<span id="iii.L-p57"></span>Be not therefore ashamed of the cross: for
these are our venerable things, these our mysteries; with this gift do
we adorn ourselves, with this we are beautified.

<span id="iii.L-p58"></span>And if I say, He stretched out the heaven,
He spread out the earth and the sea, He sent prophets and angels, I say
nothing in comparison. For the sum of His benefits is this, that “He
spared not His own Son,” <span id="fr_1967"></span>[1968](#fn_1967.md) in
order to save His alienated servants.

<span id="iii.L-p60"></span>4. Let no Judas then approach this table, no
Simon; nay, for both these perished through covetousness. Let us flee
then from this gulf; neither let us account it enough for our salvation,
if after we have stripped widows and orphans, we offer for this table a
gold and jewelled cup. Nay, if thou desire to honor the sacrifice, offer
thy soul, for which also it was slain; cause that to become golden; but
if that remain worse than lead or potter’s clay, while the vessel is of
gold, what is the profit?

<span id="iii.L-p61"></span>Let not this therefore be our aim, to offer
golden vessels only, but to do so from honest earnings likewise. For
these are of the sort that is more precious even than gold, these that
are without injuriousness. For the church is not a gold foundry nor a
workshop for silver, but an assembly of angels. Wherefore it is souls
which we require, since in fact God accepts these for the souls’ sake.

<span id="iii.L-p62"></span>That table at that time was not of silver
nor that cup of gold, out of which Christ gave His disciples His own
blood; but precious was everything there, and awful, for that they were
full of the Spirit. <span id="fr_1968"></span>[1969](#fn_1968.md)

<span id="iii.L-p64"></span>Wouldest thou do honor to Christ’s body?
Neglect Him not when naked; do not while here thou honorest Him with
silken garments, neglect Him perishing without of cold and nakedness.
For He that said, “This is my body,” and by His word confirmed the fact,
“This same said, “Ye saw me an hungered, and fed me not;” and, “Inasmuch
as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to
me.” <span id="fr_1969"></span>[1970](#fn_1969.md) For This indeed needs
not coverings, but a pure soul; but that requires much attention.

<span id="iii.L-p66"></span>Let us learn therefore to be strict in life,
and to honor Christ as He Himself desires. For to Him who is honored
that honor is most pleasing, which it is His own will to have, not that
which we account best. Since Peter too thought to honor Him by
forbidding Him to wash his feet, but his doing so was not an honor, but
the contrary.

<span id="iii.L-p67"></span>Even so do thou honor Him with this honor,
which He ordained, spending thy wealth on poor people. Since God hath no
need at all of golden vessels, but of golden souls.

<span id="iii.L-p68"></span>And these things I say, not forbidding such
offerings to be provided; but requiring you, together with them, and
before them, to give alms. For He accepts indeed the former, but much
more the latter. For in the one the offerer alone is profited, but in
the other the receiver also. Here the act seems to be a ground even of
ostentation; but there all is mercifulness, and love to man.

<span id="iii.L-p69"></span>For what is the profit, when His table
indeed is full of golden cups, but He perishes with hunger? First fill
Him, being an hungered, and then abundantly deck out His table also.
Dost thou make Him a cup of gold, while thou givest Him not a cup of
cold water? And what is the profit? Dost thou furnish His table with
cloths bespangled with gold, while to Himself thou affordest not even
the necessary covering? And what good comes of it? For tell me, should
you see one at a loss for necessary food, and omit appeasing his hunger,
while you first overlaid his table with silver; would he indeed thank
thee, and not rather be indignant? What, again, if seeing one wrapped in
rags, and stiff with cold, thou shouldest neglect giving him a garment,
and build golden columns, saying, “thou wert doing it to his honor,”
would he not say that thou wert mocking, and account it an insult, and
that the most extreme?

<span id="iii.L-p70"></span>Let this then be thy thought with regard to
Christ also, when He is going about a wanderer, and a stranger, needing
a roof to cover Him; and thou, neglecting to receive Him, deckest out a
pavement, and walls, and capitals of columns, and hangest up silver
chains by means of lamps, <span id="fr_1970"></span>[1971](#fn_1970.md) but
Himself bound in prison thou wilt not even look upon.

<span id="iii.L-p72"></span>5. And these things I say, not forbidding
munificence in these matters, but admonishing you to do those other
works together with these, or rather even before these. Because for not
having done these no one was ever blamed, but for those, hell is
threatened, and unquenchable fire, and the punishment with evil spirits.
Do not therefore while adorning His house overlook thy brother in
distress, for he is more properly a temple than the other.

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span> <span id="iii.L-Page_304"></span>

<span id="iii.L-p73"></span>And whereas these thy stores will be subject
to alienations both by unbelieving kings, and tyrants, and robbers;
whatever thou mayest do for thy brother, being hungry, and a stranger,
and naked, not even the devil will be able to despoil, but it will be
laid up in an inviolable treasure.

<span id="iii.L-p74"></span>Why then doth He Himself say, “The poor
always ye have with you, but me ye have not always?” <span
id="fr_1971"></span>[1972](#fn_1971.md) Why, for this reason most of all
should we give alms, that we have Him not always an hungered, but in the
present life only. But if thou art desirous to learn also the whole
meaning of the saying, understand that this was said not with a view to
His disciples, although it seem so, but to the woman’s weakness. That
is, her disposition being still rather imperfect, and they doubting
about her; to revive her He said these things. For in proof that for her
comfort He said it, He added, “Why trouble ye the woman?” <span
id="fr_1972"></span>[1973](#fn_1972.md) And with regard to our having Him
really always with us, He saith, “Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the
end of the world.” <span id="fr_1973"></span>[1974](#fn_1973.md) From all
which it is evident, that for no other object was this said, but that
the rebuke of the disciples might not wither the faith of the woman,
just then budding.

<span id="iii.L-p78"></span>Let us not then bring forward these things
now, which were uttered because of some economy, but let us read all the
laws, those in the New and those in the Old Testament, that are set down
about almsgiving, and let us be very earnest about this matter. For this
cleanses from sin. For “give alms, and all things will be clean unto
you.” <span id="fr_1974"></span>[1975](#fn_1974.md) This is a greater thing
than sacrifice. “For I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.” <span
id="fr_1975"></span>[1976](#fn_1975.md) This opens the heavens. For “thy
prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.” <span
id="fr_1976"></span>[1977](#fn_1976.md) This is more indispensable than
virginity: for thus were those virgins cast out of the bridechamber;
thus were the others brought in.

<span id="iii.L-p82"></span>All which things let us consider, and sow
liberally, that we may reap in more ample abundance, and attain unto the
good things to come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to whom be glory forever. Amen.
