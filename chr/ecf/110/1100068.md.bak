<span id="iii.LX-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iii.LX-p1.1"></span>Homily LXIII.</span>

<span id="iii.LX-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.LX-p2.1"></span>[Matt. XIX.
16](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.LX-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="iii.LX-p3"></span>“And, behold, one came and said unto Him,
Good Master, by doing what, shall I inherit eternal life?”

<span id="iii.LX-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.LX-p4.1"></span>Some</span> indeed accuse this young man, as one
dissembling and ill-minded, and coming with a temptation to Jesus, but
I, though I would not say he was not fond of money, and under subjection
to his wealth, since Christ in fact convicted him of being such a
character, yet a dissembler I would by no means call him, both because
it is not safe to venture on things uncertain, and especially in blame,
and because Mark hath taken away this suspicion; for he saith, that
“having come running unto Him, and kneeling to Him, he besought Him,”
and that “Jesus beheld him, and loved him.” <span
id="fr_2401"></span>[2402](#fn_2401.md)

<span id="iii.LX-p6"></span>But great is the tyranny of wealth, and it
is manifest hence; I mean, that though we be virtuous as to the rest,
this ruins all besides. With reason hath Paul also affirmed it to be the
root of all evils in general. “For the love of money is the root of all
evils,” <span id="fr_2402"></span>[2403](#fn_2402.md) he saith.

<span id="iii.LX-p8"></span>Wherefore then doth Christ thus reply to
him, saying, “There is none good?” <span
id="fr_2403"></span>[2404](#fn_2403.md) Because He came unto Him as a mere
man, and one of the common sort, and a Jewish teacher; for this cause
then as a man He discourses with him. And indeed in many instances He
replies to the secret thoughts of them that come unto Him; as when He
saith, “We worship we know what;” <span
id="fr_2404"></span>[2405](#fn_2404.md) and, “If I bear witness of myself,
my witness is not true.” <span id="fr_2405"></span>[2406](#fn_2405.md) When
therefore He saith, “There is none good;” not as putting Himself out
from being good doth He say this, far from it; for he said not, “Why
dost thou call me good? I am not good;” but, “there is none good,” that
is, none amongst men.

<span id="iii.LX-p12"></span>And when He saith this self-same thing, He
saith it not as depriving even men of goodness, but in contradistinction
to the goodness of God. Wherefore also He added, “But one, that is,
God;” and He said not, “but my Father,” that thou mightest learn that He
had not revealed Himself to the young man. So also further back He
called men evil, saying, “If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts
to your children.” <span id="fr_2406"></span>[2407](#fn_2406.md) For indeed
there too He called them evil, not as condemning the whole race as evil
(for by “ye,” He means not “ye men”), but comparing the goodness that is
in men with the goodness of God, He thus named it; therefore also He
added, “How much more shall your Father give good things to them that
ask Him?” And what was there to urge Him, <span
id="fr_2407"></span>[2408](#fn_2407.md) or what the profit that He should
answer in this way? He leads him on by little and little, and teaches
him to be far from all flattery, drawing him off from the things upon
each, and fastening him upon God, and persuading him to seek after the
things to come, and to know that which is really good, and the root and
fountain of all things, and to refer the honors to Him.

<span id="iii.LX-p15"></span>Since also when He saith, “Call no one
master upon earth,” it is in contradistinction to Himself He saith this,
and that they might learn what is the chief sovereignty over all things
that are. For neither was it a small forwardness the young man had shown
up to this time in having fallen into such a desire; and when of the
rest some were tempting, some were coming to Him for the cure of
diseases, either their own or others, he for eternal life was both
coming to Him, and discoursing with Him. For fertile was the land and
rich, but the multitude of the thorns choked the seed. Mark at any rate
how he is prepared thus far for obedience to the commandments. For “By
doing what,” he saith, “shall I inherit eternal life?” So ready was he
for the performance of the things that should be told him. But if he had
come unto Him, tempting Him, the evangelist would have declared this
also to us, as He doth also with regard to the others, as in the case of
the lawyer. And though himself had been silent, Christ could not have
suffered <span id="page_370">p. 370</span> <span
id="iii.LX-Page_370"></span> him to lie concealed, but would have
convicted him plainly, or at least would have intimated it, so that he
should not seem to have deceived Him, and to be hidden, and thereby have
suffered hurt.

<span id="iii.LX-p16"></span>If he had come unto Him tempting, he would
not have departed sorrowing for what he heard. This was not at any rate
ever the feeling of any of the Pharisees, but they grew fierce when
their mouths were stopped. But not so this man; but he goeth away cast
down, which is no little sign that not with an evil will he had come
unto Him, but with one too feeble, and that he did indeed desire life,
but was held in subjection by another and most grievous feeling.

<span id="iii.LX-p17"></span>Therefore when Christ said, “If thou wilt
enter into life, keep the commandments,” he saith, “Which?” Not
tempting, far from it, but supposing there were some others besides
those of the law that should procure him life, which was like one who
was very desirous. Then since Jesus mentioned those out of the law, he
saith, “All these things have I kept from my youth up.” <span
id="fr_2408"></span>[2409](#fn_2408.md) And neither at this did he stop,
but again asks, “What lack I yet?” which itself again was a sign of his
very earnest desire. <span id="fr_2409"></span>[2410](#fn_2409.md)

<span id="iii.LX-p20"></span>What then saith Christ? Since He was going
to enjoin something great, He setteth forth the recompenses, and saith,
“If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the
poor, and thou shalt have treasure in Heaven: and come, and follow
me.” <span id="fr_2410"></span>[2411](#fn_2410.md)

<span id="iii.LX-p22"></span>2. Seest thou how many prizes, how many
crowns, He appoints for this race? If he had been tempting, He would not
have told him these things. But now He both saith it, and in order to
draw him on, He also shows him the reward to be great, and leaves it all
to his own will, by all means throwing into the shade that which seemed
to be grievous in His advice. Wherefore even before mentioning the
conflicts and the toil, He shows him the prize, saying “If thou wilt be
perfect,” and then saith, “Sell that thou hast, and give to the poor,”
and straightway again the rewards, “Thou shalt have treasure in Heaven;
and come, and follow me.” For indeed to follow Him is a great
recompense. “And thou shalt have treasure in Heaven.”

<span id="iii.LX-p23"></span>For since his discourse was of money, even
of all did He advise him to strip himself, showing that he loses not
what he hath, but adds to his possessions, He gave him more than He
required him to give up; and not only more, but also as much greater as
Heaven is greater than earth, and yet more so.

<span id="iii.LX-p24"></span>But He called it a treasure, showing the
plenteousness of the recompense, its permanency, its security, so far as
it was possible by human similitudes to intimate it to the hearer. It is
not then enough to despise wealth, but we must also maintain poor men,
and above all things follow Christ; that is, do all the things that are
ordered by Him, be ready for slaughter and daily death. “For if any man
will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and
follow me.” <span id="fr_2411"></span>[2412](#fn_2411.md) So that to cast
away one’s money is a much less thing than this last commandment, to
shed even one’s very blood; yet not a little doth our being freed from
wealth contribute towards this.

<span id="iii.LX-p26"></span>“But when the young man heard it, he went
away sorrowful.” <span id="fr_2412"></span>[2413](#fn_2412.md) After this
the evangelist, as it were to show that he hath not felt anything it was
unlikely he should feel, saith, “For he had <span
id="fr_2413"></span>[2414](#fn_2413.md) great possessions.” For they that
have little are not equally held in subjection, as they that are
overflowed with great affluence, for then the love of it becomes more
tyrannical. Which thing I cease not always saying, that the increase of
acquisitions kindles the flame more, and renders the getters poorer,
inasmuch as it puts them in greater desire, and makes them have more
feeling of their want.

<span id="iii.LX-p29"></span>See, for example, even here what strength
did this passion exhibit. Him that had come to Him with joy and
forwardness, when Christ commanded him to cast away his riches, it so
overwhelmed and weighed down, as not to suffer him so much as to answer
touching these things, but silenced and become dejected and sullen to go
away.

<span id="iii.LX-p30"></span>What then saith Christ? “How hardly shall
the rich enter into the kingdom of Heaven!” <span
id="fr_2414"></span>[2415](#fn_2414.md) blaming not riches but them that
are held in subjection by them. But if the rich man “hardly,” much more
the covetous man. For if not to give one’s own be an hindrance to
entering the kingdom, even to take of other men’s goods, think how much
fire it heapeth up.

<span id="iii.LX-p32"></span>Why can it have been, however, that He said
to His disciples, that “hardly shall a rich man enter in,” they being
poor men, and having no possessions? Instructing them not to be ashamed
of their poverty, and, as <span id="page_371">p. 371</span> <span
id="iii.LX-Page_371"></span> it were, excusing Himself to them for
suffering them to have nothing.

<span id="iii.LX-p33"></span>But having said it was hard; as He
proceeds, He shows that it is even impossible, and not merely
impossible, but even in the highest degree impossible; and this He
showed by the comparison concerning the camel and the <span
id="fr_2415"></span>[2416](#fn_2415.md) needle.

<span id="iii.LX-p35"></span>“It is easier” saith He, “for a camel to
enter in by the eye of a needle, <span
id="fr_2416"></span>[2417](#fn_2416.md) than for a rich man to enter into
the kingdom of Heaven.” <span id="fr_2417"></span>[2418](#fn_2417.md)
Whence it is shown, that there is no ordinary reward for them that are
rich, and are able to practise self command. Wherefore also He affirmed
it to be a work of God, that He might show that great grace is needed
for him who is to achieve this. At least, when the disciples were
troubled, He said, “With men this is impossible; but with God all things
are possible.” <span id="fr_2418"></span>[2419](#fn_2418.md)

<span id="iii.LX-p39"></span>And wherefore are the disciples troubled,
being poor, yea, exceedingly poor? Wherefore then are they confounded?
Being in pain about the salvation of the rest, and having a great
affection for all, and having already taken upon themselves the tender
bowels of teachers. They were at least in such trembling and fear for
the whole world from this declaration, as to need much comfort.

<span id="iii.LX-p40"></span>Therefore, having first “beheld them, He
said unto them, The things which are impossible with men, are possible
with God.” For with a mild and meek look, having soothed their
shuddering mind, and having put an end to their distress (for this the
evangelist signified by saying, “He beheld them”), then by His words
also He relieves them, bringing before them God’s power, and so making
them feel confidence.

<span id="iii.LX-p41"></span>But if thou wilt learn the manner of it
likewise, and how what is impossible may become possible, hear. Born
either for this end did He say, “The things which are impossible with
men, are possible with God,” that thou shouldest give it up, and
abstain, as from things impossible; but that having considered the
greatness of the good work, thou shouldest hasten to it readily, and
having besought God to assist thee in these noble contests, shouldest
attain unto life.

<span id="iii.LX-p42"></span>3. How then should this become possible? If
thou cast away what thou hast, if thou empty thyself of thy wealth, if
thou refrain from the wicked desire. For in proof that He does not refer
it to God alone, but that to this end He said it, that thou shouldest
know the vastness of the good work, hear what follows. For when Peter
had said, “Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed Thee,” and had
asked, “What shall we have therefore?” having appointed the reward for
them; He added, “And every one who hath forsaken houses, or lands, or
brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, shall receive an hundred
fold, and shall inherit eternal life.” <span
id="fr_2419"></span>[2420](#fn_2419.md) Thus that which is impossible
becometh possible. But how may this very thing be done, one may say, to
forsake these? how is it possible for him that is once sunk in such lust
of wealth, to recover himself? If he begin to empty himself of his
possessions, and cut off what are superfluous. For so shall he both
advance further, and shall run on his course more easily afterwards.

<span id="iii.LX-p44"></span>Do not then seek all at once, but gently,
and by little and little, ascend this ladder, that leads thee up to
Heaven. <span id="fr_2420"></span>[2421](#fn_2420.md) For like as those in
fevers having acrid bile abounding within them, when they cast in
thereon meats and drinks, so far from quenching their thirst, do even
kindle the flame; so also the covetous, when they cast in their wealth
upon this wicked lust more acrid than that bile, do rather inflame it.
For nothing so stays it as to refrain for a time from the lust of gain,
like as acrid bile is stayed by abstinence and evacuations.

<span id="iii.LX-p46"></span>But this itself, by what means will it be
done? one may say. If thou consider, that whilst rich, thou wilt never
cease thirsting, and pining with the lust of more; but being freed from
thy possessions, thou wilt be able also to stay this disease. Do not
then encompass thyself with more, lest thou follow after things
unattainable, and be incurable, and be more miserable than all, being
thus frantic.

<span id="iii.LX-p47"></span>For answer me, whom shall we affirm to be
tormented and pained? him that longs after costly meats and drinks, and
is not able to enjoy them as he will, or him that hath not such a
desire? It is quite clear one must say, him that desires, but cannot
obtain what he desires. For this is so painful, to desire and not to
enjoy, to thirst and not to drink, that Christ desiring to describe hell
to us, described it in this way, and introduced the rich man thus
tormented. For longing for a drop of water, and not enjoying it, this
was his punishment. So then he that despises wealth quiets the desire,
but he that desires to be rich <span
id="fr_2421"></span>[2422](#fn_2421.md) hath inflamed it more, and not yet
<span id="page_372">p. 372</span> <span id="iii.LX-Page_372"></span>
doth he stay; but though he have got ten thousand talents, he desireth
as much more; though he obtain these, again he aims at twice as much
more, and going on he desires even the mountains, and the earth, and the
sea, and all to become gold for him, being mad with a kind of new and
fearful madness, and one that can never thus be extinguished.

<span id="iii.LX-p49"></span>And that thou mightest learn, that not by
addition but by taking away this evil is stayed; if thou hadst ever had
an absurd desire to fly and to be borne through the air, how wouldest
thou extinguish this unreasonable desire? By fashioning wings, and
preparing other instruments, or by convincing the mind that it is
desiring things impossible, and that one should attempt none of these
things? It is quite plain, that by convincing the mind. But that, thou
mayest say, is impossible. But this again is more impossible, to find a
limit for this desire. For indeed it is more easy for men to fly, than
to make this lust cease by an addition of more. For when the objects of
desire are possible, one may be soothed by the enjoyment of them, but
when they are impossible, one must labor for one thing, to draw
ourselves off from the desire, as otherwise at least it is not possible
to recover the soul.

<span id="iii.LX-p50"></span>Therefore that we may not have superfluous
sorrows, let us forsake the love of money that is ever paining, and
never endures to hold its peace, and let us remove ourselves to another
love, which both makes us happy, and hath great facility, and let us
long after the treasures above. For neither is the labor here so great,
and the gain is unspeakable, and it is not possible for him to fail of
them who is but in any wise watchful and sober, and despises the things
present; even as on the other hand, as to him that is a slave to these
last, and is utterly given up to them, it as altogether of necessity
that he fail of those better riches.

<span id="iii.LX-p51"></span>4. Considering then all these things, put
away the wicked desire of wealth. For neither couldest thou say this,
that it gives the things present, though it deprive us of the things to
come, albeit even if this were so, this were extreme punishment, and
vengeance. But now not even this may be. For besides hell, and before
that hell, even here it casts thee into a more grievous punishment. For
many houses hath this lust overthrown, and fierce wars hath it stirred
up, and compelled men to end their lives by a violent death; and before
these dangers it ruins the nobleness of the soul, and is wont often to
make him that hath it cowardly, and unmanly, and rash, and false, and
calumnious, and ravenous, and over-reaching, and all the worst things.

<span id="iii.LX-p52"></span>But seeing perhaps the brightness of the
silver, and the multitude of the servants, and the beauty of the
buildings, the court paid in the market-place, art thou bewitched
thereby? What remedy then may there be for this evil wound? If thou
consider how these things affect thy soul, how dark, and desolate, and
foul they render it, and how ugly; if thou reckon with how many evils
these things were acquired, with how many labors they are kept, with how
many dangers: or rather they are not kept unto the end, but when thou
hast escaped the attempts of all, death coming on thee is often wont to
remove these things into the hand of thine enemies, and goeth and taketh
thee with him destitute, drawing after thee none of these things, save
the wounds and the sores only, which the soul received from these,
before its departing. When then thou seest any one resplendent outwardly
with raiment and large attendance, lay open his conscience, and thou
shalt see many a cobweb within, and much dust. Consider Paul, Peter.
Consider John, Elias, or rather the Son of God Himself, who hath not
where to lay His head. Be an imitator of Him, and of His servants, and
imagine to thyself the unspeakable riches of these.

<span id="iii.LX-p53"></span>But if having obtained a little sight by
these, thou shouldest be darkened again, as in any shipwreck when a
storm hath come on, hear the declaration of Christ, which affirms, that
it is impossible “for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of Heaven.”
And against this declaration set the mountains, and the earth, and the
sea; and all things, if thou wilt, suppose <span
id="fr_2422"></span>[2423](#fn_2422.md) to be gold; for thou shalt see
nothing equal to the loss arising to thee from thence. And thou indeed
makest mention of acres of land, so many and so many, and of houses ten
or twenty or even more, and of baths as many, and of slaves a thousand,
or twice as many, and of chariots fastened with silver and overlaid with
gold; but I say this, that if each one of you that are rich were to
leave this poverty (for these things are poverty compared with what I am
about to say), and were possessed of a whole world, and each of them had
as many men as are now everywhere on land and sea, and each a world both
sea and land, and everywhere buildings, and cities, and nations, and
from every side instead of water, instead of fountains, gold flowed up
for him, I would not say those who are thus rich are worth three
farthings, when they are cast out of the kingdom.

<span id="iii.LX-p55"></span>For if now aiming at riches that perish,
<span id="page_373">p. 373</span> <span id="iii.LX-Page_373"></span>
when they miss them, they are tormented, if they should obtain a
perception of those unspeakable blessings, what then will suffice for
consolation for them? There is nothing. Tell me not then of the
abundance of their possessions, but consider how great loss the lovers
of this abundance undergo in consequence thereof, for these things
losing Heaven, and being in the same state, as if any one after being
cast out of the highest honor in kings’ courts, having a dung heap, were
to pride himself on that. For the storing up of money differs nothing
from that, or rather that is even the better. For that is serviceable
both for husbandry, and for heating a bath, and for other such uses, but
the buried gold for none of these things. And would it were merely
useless; but as it is, it kindles moreover many furnaces for him that
hath it, unless he use it rightly; countess evils at least spring
therefrom.

<span id="iii.LX-p56"></span>Therefore they that are without used to
call the love of money the citadel <span
id="fr_2423"></span>[2424](#fn_2423.md) of evils; but the blessed Paul
spake much better and more vividly, pronouncing it “the root of all
evils.” <span id="fr_2424"></span>[2425](#fn_2424.md)

<span id="iii.LX-p59"></span>Considering then all these things, let us
emulate the things worthy of emulation, not gorgeous buildings not
costly estates, but the men that have much confidence towards God, those
that have riches in Heaven, the owners of those treasures, them that are
really rich, them that are poor for Christ’s sake, that we may attain
unto the good things of eternity by the grace and love towards man of
our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom be unto the Father, together with the
Holy Ghost, glory, might, honor, now and always and world without end.
Amen.
