<span id="iii.XXXV-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iii.XXXV-p1.1"></span>Homily XXXV.</span>

<span id="iii.XXXV-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.XXXV-p2.1"></span>[Matt. X.
34](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034.md)<span
id="iii.XXXV-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="iii.XXXV-p3"></span>*“Think not that I am come* <span
id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461.md) *to send peace on earth; I am not
come* <span id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462.md) *to send peace, but a
sword.”*

<span id="iii.XXXV-p6"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.XXXV-p6.1"></span>Again</span>, He sets forth the things that
are more painful, and that with great aggravation: and the objection
they were sure to meet Him with, He prevents them by stating. I mean,
lest hearing this, they should say, “For, this then art Thou come, to
destroy both us, and them that obey us, and to fill the earth with war?”
He first saith Himself, “I am not come to send peace on earth.”

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span> <span id="iii.XXXV-Page_227"></span>

<span id="iii.XXXV-p7"></span>How then did He enjoin them to pronounce
peace on entering into each house? And again, how did the angels say,
“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace”? <span
id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463.md) And how came all the prophets too
to publish it for good tidings? Because this more than anything is
peace, when the diseased is cut off, when the mutinous is removed. For
thus it is possible for Heaven to be united to earth. Since the
physician too in this way preserves the rest of the body, when he
amputates the incurable part; and the general, when he has brought to a
separation them that were agreed in mischief. Thus it came to pass also
in the case of that famous tower; for their evil peace <span
id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464.md) was ended by their good discord,
and peace made thereby. Thus Paul also divided them that were conspiring
against him. <span id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465.md) And in Naboth’s
case that agreement was at the same time more grievous than any
war. <span id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466.md) For concord is not in
every case a good thing, since even robbers agree together.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p12"></span>The war is not then the effect of His
purpose, but of their temper. For His will indeed was that all should
agree in the word of godliness; but because they fell to dissension, war
arises. Yet He spake not so; but what saith He? “I am not come to send
peace;” comforting them. As if He said, For think not that ye are to
blame for these things; it is I who order them so, because men are so
disposed. Be not ye therefore confounded, as though the events happened
against expectation. To this end am I come, to send war among men; for
this is my will. Be not ye therefore troubled, when the earth is at war,
as though it were subject to some hostile device. For when the worse
part is rent away, then after that Heaven is knit unto the better.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p13"></span>And these things He saith, as
strengthening them against the evil suspicion of the multitude.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p14"></span>And He said not “war,” but what was more
grievous than it, “a sword.” And if there be somewhat painful in these
expressions, and of an alarming emphasis, marvel not. For, it being His
will to train their ears by the severity of His words, lest in their
difficult circumstances they should start aside, He fashioned His
discourse accordingly; lest any one should say it was by flattery He
persuaded them, and by concealing the hardships; therefore even to those
things which merited to be otherwise expressed, He gave by His words the
more galling and painful turn. For it is better to see persons’
gentleness in things, than in words.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p15"></span>2. Wherefore neither with this was He
satisfied, but unfolds also the very nature of the war, signifying it to
be far more grievous even than a civil war; and He saith, “I am come to
set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her
mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.” <span
id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467.md)

<span id="iii.XXXV-p17"></span>For not friends only, saith He, nor
fellow citizens, but even kinsmen shall stand against one another, and
nature shall be divided against herself. “For I am come,” saith He, “to
set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her
mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.” That is, not
merely among those of the same household is the war, but among those
that are dearest, and extremely near to each other. And this more than
anything signifies His power, that hearing these things, they both
accepted Him, and set about persuading all others.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p18"></span>Yet was it not He that did this: of
course not: but the wickedness of the other sort: nevertheless He saith
it is His own doing. For such is the custom of the Scripture. Yea, and
elsewhere also He saith, “God hath given them eyes that they should not
see:” <span id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468.md) and here He speaks in
this way, in order that having, as I said before, exercised themselves
in these words, they might not be confounded on suffering reproaches and
insults.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p20"></span>But if any think these things
intolerable, let them be reminded of an ancient history. For in times of
old also this came to pass, which thing especially shows the old
covenant to be akin to the new, and Him who is here speaking, the same
with the giver of those commands. I mean that in the case of the Jews
also, when each had slain his neighbor, then He laid aside His anger
against them; both when they made the calf, and when they were joined to
Baal Peor. <span id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469.md) Where then are
they that say, “That God is evil, and this good?” For behold He hath
filled the world with blood, shed by kinsmen. Nevertheless even this we
affirm to be a work of great love towards man.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p22"></span>Therefore, you see, implying that it was
He who approved those other acts also, He makes mention also of a
prophecy, which if not spoken for this end, yet involves the same
meaning. And what is this?

<span id="iii.XXXV-p23"></span>“A man’s foes shall be they of his own
household.” <span id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470.md)

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span> <span id="iii.XXXV-Page_228"></span>

<span id="iii.XXXV-p25"></span>For indeed among the Jews also something
of the kind took place. That is, there were prophets, and false
prophets, and the people was divided, and families were in dissension;
and some believed the one, and some the other. Wherefore the prophet
admonishes, saying, “Trust ye not in friends, have not hope in guides;
yea, even of her that lieth in thy bosom beware, in respect of
communicating aught to her:” and, “A man’s enemies are the men that are
in his own house.” <span id="fr_1471"></span>[1472](#fn_1471.md)

<span id="iii.XXXV-p27"></span>And this He said, preparing him that
should receive the word to be above all. For to die is not evil, but to
die an evil death. On this account He said moreover, “I am come to cast
fire upon the earth.” <span id="fr_1472"></span>[1473](#fn_1472.md) And
this He said, to declare the vehemence and warmth of the love which He
required. For, because He loved us very much, so He will likewise be
loved of us. And these sayings would strengthen <span
id="fr_1473"></span>[1474](#fn_1473.md) the persons present also, and lift
them higher. “For if those others,” saith He, “are to despise kinsmen,
and children, and parents, imagine what manner of men ye their teachers
ought to be. Since neither will the hardships stop with you, but will
also pass on to the rest. For since I am come bringing great blessings,
I demand also great obedience, and purpose of heart.”

<span id="iii.XXXV-p30"></span>3. “He that loveth father or mother more
than me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more
than me, is not worthy of me; and he that taketh not his cross and
followeth after me, is not worthy of me.” <span
id="fr_1474"></span>[1475](#fn_1474.md)

<span id="iii.XXXV-p32"></span>Seest thou a teacher’s dignity? Seest
thou, how He signifies himself a true Son of Him that begat Him,
commanding us to let go all things beneath, and to take in preference
the love of Him?

<span id="iii.XXXV-p33"></span>“And why speak I,” saith He, “of friends
and kinsmen? Even if it be thine own life which thou preferrest to my
love, thy place is far from my disciples.” What then? Are not these
things contrary to the Old Testament? Far from it, rather they are very
much in harmony therewith. For there too He commands not only to hate
the worshippers of idols, but even to stone them; and in Deuteronomy
again, admiring these, He saith, “Who said unto his father, and to his
mother, I have not seen thee; neither did he acknowledge his brethren,
and his own sons he disowned: he kept Thy oracles.” <span
id="fr_1475"></span>[1476](#fn_1475.md) And if Paul gives many directions
touching parents, commanding us to obey them in all things, marvel not;
for in those things only doth he mean us to obey, as many as do not
hinder godliness. <span id="fr_1476"></span>[1477](#fn_1476.md) For indeed
it is a sacred duty to render them all other honors: but when they
demand more than is due, one ought not to obey. For this reason Luke
saith, “If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and
wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life
also, he cannot be my disciple;” <span
id="fr_1477"></span>[1478](#fn_1477.md) not commanding simply to hate them,
since this were even quite contrary to the law; but “when one desires to
be loved more than I am, hate him in this respect. For this ruins both
the beloved himself, and the lover.” And these things He said, both to
render the children more determined, and to make the fathers more
gentle, that would hinder them. For when they saw He had such strength
and power as to sever their children from them, they, as attempting
things impossible, would even desist. Wherefore also He leaves the
fathers, and addresses His discourse to the children, instructing the
former not to make the attempt, as attempting things impracticable.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p37"></span>Then lest they should be indignant, or
count it hard, see which way He makes His argument tend: in that having
said, “Who hateth not father and mother,” He adds, “and his own life.”
For why dost thou speak to me of parents, saith He, and brothers, and
sisters, and wife? Nothing is nearer than the life to any man: yet if
thou hate not this also, thou must bear in all things the opposite of
his lot who loveth me.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p38"></span>And not even simply to hate it was His
command, but so as to expose it to war, and to battles, and to
slaughters, and blood. “For he that beareth not his cross, and cometh
after me, cannot be my disciple.” <span
id="fr_1478"></span>[1479](#fn_1478.md) Thus He said not merely that we
must stand against death, but also against a violent death; and not
violent only, but ignominious too.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p40"></span>And He discourses nothing as yet of His
own passion, that when they had been for a time instructed in these
things, they might more easily receive His word concerning it. Is there
not, therefore, cause for amazement, how on their hearing these things,
their soul did not wing its way from the body, the hardships being
everywhere at hand, and the good things in expectation? How then did it
not flee away? Great was both the power of the speaker, and the love of
the hearers. Wherefore though hearing things far more intolera <span
id="page_229">p. 229</span> <span id="iii.XXXV-Page_229"></span> ble and
galling than those great men, Moses and Jeremiah, they continued to
obey, and to say nothing against it.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p41"></span>“He that findeth his life,” saith He,
“shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake, shall find
it.” <span id="fr_1479"></span>[1480](#fn_1479.md) Seest thou how great the
damage to such as love it unduly? how great the gain to them that hate
it? I mean, because the injunctions were disagreeable, when He was
bidding them set themselves against parents, and children, and nature,
and kindred, and the world, and their very soul, He sets forth the
profit also, being very great. Thus, “These things,” saith He, “so far
from harming, will very greatly profit; and their opposites will
injure;” urging them, as He ever doth, by the very things which they
desire. For why art thou willing to despise thy life? <span
id="fr_1480"></span>[1481](#fn_1480.md) Because thou lovest it? Then for
that very reason despise it, and so thou wilt advantage it in the
highest degree, and do the part of one that loves it.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p44"></span>And mark an instance of unspeakable
consideration. For not in respect of our parents only doth He practise
this reasoning, nor of our children, but with regard to our life, which
is nearer than all; that the other point may thenceforth become
unquestionable, and they may learn that they will in this way profit
those of their kindred likewise, as much as may be; since so it is in
the case even of our life, which is more essential to us than all.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p45"></span>4. Now these things were enough to
recommend men to receive them, their appointed healers. Yea, who would
choose but receive with all readiness them that were so noble, such true
heroes, and as lions running about the earth, and despising all that
pertained to themselves, so that others might be saved? Yet nevertheless
He proffers also another reward, indicating that He is caring here for
the entertainers more than for the guests.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p46"></span>And the first honor He confers is by
saying,

<span id="iii.XXXV-p47"></span>“He that receiveth you, receiveth me, and
he that receiveth me, receiveth Him that sent me.” <span
id="fr_1481"></span>[1482](#fn_1481.md)

<span id="iii.XXXV-p49"></span>With this, what may compare? that one
should receive the Father and the Son! But He holds out herewith another
reward also.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p50"></span>“ He,” saith He, “that receiveth a
prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet’s reward; and
he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall
receive a righteous man’s reward.” <span
id="fr_1482"></span>[1483](#fn_1482.md)

<span id="iii.XXXV-p52"></span>And as before He threatens punishment to
such as do not receive them, here He defines also a certain
refreshment <span id="fr_1483"></span>[1484](#fn_1483.md) for the good. And
to teach thee His greater care for them, He said not simply, “He that
receiveth a prophet,” or “He that receiveth a righteous man,” but
subjoined, “in the name of a prophet,” and, “in the name of a righteous
man;” that is, if not for any worldly preferment, nor for any other
temporal thing, he receive him, but because he is either a prophet or a
righteous man, he shall receive a prophet’s reward, and a righteous
man’s reward; such as it were meet for him to have, that hath received a
prophet, or a righteous man; or, such as that other is himself to
receive. Which kind of thing Paul also said: “That your abundance may be
a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for
your want.” <span id="fr_1484"></span>[1485](#fn_1484.md)

<span id="iii.XXXV-p55"></span>Then, lest any one should allege poverty,
He saith,

<span id="iii.XXXV-p56"></span>“Or whosoever shall give to drink unto
one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a
disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his
reward.” <span id="fr_1485"></span>[1486](#fn_1485.md)

<span id="iii.XXXV-p58"></span>“Though a cup of cold water be thy gift,
on which there is nothing laid out, even of this shall a reward be
stored up for thee. For I do all things for the sake of you the
receivers.”

<span id="iii.XXXV-p59"></span>Seest thou what mighty persuasions He
used, and how He opened to them the houses of the whole world? Yea, He
signified that men are their debtors: first, by saying, “The workman is
worthy of his hire;” secondly, by sending them forth having nothing;
thirdly, by giving them up to wars and fightings in behalf of them that
receive them; fourthly, by committing to them miracles also; fifthly, in
that He did by their lips introduce peace, the cause of all blessings,
into the houses of such as receive them; sixthly, by threatening things
more grievous than Sodom to such as receive them not: seventhly, by
signifying that as many as welcome them are receiving both Himself and
the Father; eighthly, by promising both a prophet’s and a righteous
man’s reward: ninthly, by undertaking that the recompenses shall be
great, even for a cup of cold water. Now each one of these things, even
by itself, were enough to attract them. For who, tell me, when a <span
id="page_230">p. 230</span> <span id="iii.XXXV-Page_230"></span> leader
of armies wounded in innumerable places, and dyed in blood, came in
sight, returning after many trophies from war and conflict, would not
receive him, throwing open every door in his house?

<span id="iii.XXXV-p60"></span>5. But who now is like this? one may say.
Therefore He added, “In the name of a disciple, and of a prophet, and of
a righteous man;” to instruct thee that not for the worthiness of the
visitor, but for the purpose of him that gives welcome, is His reward
appointed. For though here He speak of prophets, and righteous men, and
disciples, yet elsewhere He bids men receive the veriest outcasts, and
punishes such as fail to do so. For, “Inasmuch as ye did it not to one
of the least of these, ye did it not to me;” <span
id="fr_1486"></span>[1487](#fn_1486.md) and the converse again He affirms
with respect to the same persons.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p62"></span>Since though he may be doing no such
great work, he is a man, inhabiting the same world with thee, beholding
the same sun having the same soul, the same Lord, a partaker with thee
of the same mysteries, called to the same heaven with thee; having a
strong claim, his poverty, and his want of necessary food. But now they
that waken thee with flutes and pipes in the winter season, and disturb
thee without purpose or fruit, depart from thee receiving many
gifts. <span id="fr_1487"></span>[1488](#fn_1487.md) And they that carry
about swallows, <span id="fr_1488"></span>[1489](#fn_1488.md) and smut
themselves over, <span id="fr_1489"></span>[1490](#fn_1489.md) and abuse
every one, receive a reward for this their conjuration. But if there
come to thee a poor man wanting bread, there is no end of revilings, and
reproaches, and charges of idleness, and upbraidings, and insults, and
jeers; and thou considerest not with thyself, that thou too art idle,
and yet God giveth thee His gifts. For tell me not this, that thou too
art doing somewhat, but point me out this rather, if it be anything
really needful that thou doest, and art busy about. But if thou tellest
one of money-getting, and of traffic, and of the care and increase of
thy goods, I also would say unto thee, Not these, but alms, and prayers,
and the protection of the injured, and all such things, are truly works,
with respect to which we live in thorough idleness. Yet God never told
us, “Because thou art idle, I light not up the sun for thee; because
thou doest nothing of real consequence, I quench the moon, I paralyze
the womb of the earth, I restrain the lakes, the fountains, the rivers,
I blot out the atmosphere: I withhold the annual rains:” but He gives us
all abundantly. And to some that are not merely idle, but even doing
evil, He freely gives the benefit of these things.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p66"></span>When therefore thou seest a poor man, and
sayest, “It stops my breath that this fellow, young as he is and
healthy, having nothing, would fain be fed in idleness; he is surely
some slave and runaway, and hath deserted his proper master:” I bid thee
speak these same words to thyself; or rather, permit him freely to speak
them unto thee, and he will say with more justice, “It stops my breath
that thou, being healthy, art idle, and practisest none of the things
which God hath commanded, but having run away from the commandments of
thy Lord, goest about dwelling in wickedness, as in a strange land, in
drunkenness, in surfeiting, in theft, in extortion, in subverting other
men’s houses.” And thou indeed imputest idleness, but I evil works; in
thy plotting, in thy swearing, in thy lying, in thy spoiling, in thy
doing innumerable such things.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p67"></span>And this I say, not as making a law in
favor of idleness, far from it; but rather very earnestly wishing all to
be employed; for sloth is the teacher of all wickedness: but I beseech
you not to be unmerciful, nor cruel. Since Paul also, having made
infinite complaints, and said, “If any will not work, neither let him
eat,” stopped not at this, but added, “But ye, be not weary in well
doing.” <span id="fr_1490"></span>[1491](#fn_1490.md) “Nay, but these
things are contradictory. For if thou hast commanded for them not to
eat, how exhortest thou us to give?” I do so, saith He, for I have also
commanded to avoid them, and “to have no company with them;” and again I
said, “Count them not as enemies, but admonish them;” <span
id="fr_1491"></span>[1492](#fn_1491.md) not making contradictory laws, but
such as are quite in unison with each other. Because, if thou art prompt
to mercy, both he, the poor man, will soon be rid of his idleness, and
thou of thy cruelty.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p70"></span>“But he hath many lies and inventions,”
you reply. Well, hence again is he pitiable, for that he hath fallen
into such distress, as <span id="page_231">p. 231</span> <span
id="iii.XXXV-Page_231"></span> to be hardened even in such doings. But
we, so far from pitying, add even those cruel words, “Hast thou not
received once and again?” so we talk. What then? because he was once
fed, hath he no need to be fed again? Why dost thou not make these laws
for thine own belly also, and say to it likewise, Thou wert filled
yesterday, and the day before, seek it not now? But while thou fillest
that beyond measure, even to bursting, <span
id="fr_1492"></span>[1493](#fn_1492.md) from him thou turnest away, when he
asks but what is moderate; whereas thou oughtest therefore to pity him,
because he is constrained to come to thee every day. Yea, if nought else
incline thee to him, thou shouldest pity him because of this; for by the
constraint of his poverty he is forced on these things, and doeth them.
And thou dost not pity him, because, being so spoken to, he feels no
shame: the reason being, that his want is too strong for him.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p72"></span>Nay, thou instead of pitying, dost even
make a show of him; and whereas God hath commanded to give secretly,
thou standest exposing publicly him that hath accosted thee, and
upbraiding him, for what ought to move thy pity. Why, if thou art not
minded to give, to what end add reproach, and bruise that weary and
wretched soul? He came as into a harbor, seeking help at thine hands;
why stir up waves, and make the storm more grievous? Why dost thou
condemn him of meanness? What? had he thought to hear such things, would
he have come to thee? Or if he actually came foreseeing this, good cause
therefore both to pity him, and to shudder at thine own cruelty, that
not even so, when thou seest an inexorable necessity laid upon him, dost
thou become more gentle, nor judgest him to have a sufficient excuse for
his importunity in the dread of hunger, but accusest him of impudence:
and yet hast thou often thyself practised greater impudence, yea in
respect of grievous matters. For while here the very impudence brings
with it ground of pardon, we, often doing things punishable, brazen it
out: and when we ought to bear all that in mind, and be humble, we even
trample on those miserable men, and when they ask medicines, we add to
their wounds. I say, if thou wilt not give, yet why dost thou strike? If
thou wilt not be bounteous, yet why be insolent?

<span id="iii.XXXV-p73"></span>“But he submits not to be put off in any
other way.” Well then, as that wise man commanded, <span
id="fr_1493"></span>[1494](#fn_1493.md) so do. “Answer him peaceable words
with meekness.” For not of his own accord, surely, is he so very
importunate. For there is not, there cannot be, any man desiring to be
put to shame for its own sake. How much soever any may contend, I cannot
yield ever to be convinced that a man who was living in plenty would
choose to beg.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p75"></span>6. Let no man then beguile us with
arguments. But although Paul saith, “If any will not work, neither let
him eat,” <span id="fr_1494"></span>[1495](#fn_1494.md) to them he saith
it; but to us he saith not this, but, on the contrary, “Be not weary in
well doing.” <span id="fr_1495"></span>[1496](#fn_1495.md) Even thus do we
at home; when any two are striving with each other, we take each apart,
and give them the opposite advice. This did God also, and Moses. For
while to God he said, “If thou wilt forgive them their sin, forgive it;
else blot me out also;” <span id="fr_1496"></span>[1497](#fn_1496.md) them
on the contrary he commanded to slay one another, and all that pertained
to them. Yet these things are contrary; nevertheless, both looked to one
end.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p79"></span>Again, God said to Moses in the hearing
of the Jews, “Let me alone, that I may consume the people,” <span
id="fr_1497"></span>[1498](#fn_1497.md) (for though they were not present
when God was saying this, yet they were to hear it afterwards): but
privately He gives him directions of the opposite tenor. And this, Moses
upon constraint revealed afterwards, thus saying, “What? did I conceive
them, that thou sayest to me, Carry them, as a nurse would carry the
sucking child in her bosom?” <span id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498.md)

<span id="iii.XXXV-p82"></span>These things are done also in houses, and
often a father while he blames the tutor in private for having used his
child reproachfully, saying, “Be not rough, nor hard,” to the youth
speaks in the contrary way, “Though thou be reproached unjustly, bear
it;” out of those opposites making up some one wholesome result. Thus
also Paul said to such as are in health and beg, “If any man will not
work, neither let him eat,” that he may urge them into employment: but
to such as can show mercy, “Ye, for your part, be not weary in well
doing:” that he may lead them to give alms.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p83"></span>So also, when he was admonishing those of
the Gentiles, in his Epistle to the Romans, not to be highminded against
the Jews, he brought forward also the wild olive, and he seems to be
saying one thing to these, another to those. <span
id="fr_1499"></span>[1500](#fn_1499.md)

<span id="iii.XXXV-p85"></span>Let us not therefore fall away into
cruelty, but let us listen to Paul, saying, “Be not weary in well
doing;” let us listen to the Lord, who saith, “Give to every man that
asketh of thee,” <span id="fr_1500"></span>[1501](#fn_1500.md) and, “Be ye
merciful as <span id="page_232">p. 232</span> <span
id="iii.XXXV-Page_232"></span> your Father.” <span
id="fr_1501"></span>[1502](#fn_1501.md) And though He hath spoken of many
things, He hath nowhere used this expression, but with regard to our
deeds of mercy only. For nothing so equals us with God, as doing good.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p88"></span>“But nothing is more shameless,” saith
one, “than a poor man.” Why, I pray thee? Because he runs up, and cries
out after thee? Wilt thou then let me point out, how we are more
importunate than they, and very shameless? Remember, I say, now at the
season of the fast, how often, when thy table was spread at eventide,
and thou hadst called thy ministering servant; on his moving rather
leisurely, <span id="fr_1502"></span>[1503](#fn_1502.md) thou hast overset
everything, kicking, insulting, reviling, merely about a little delay;
although fully assured, that if not immediately, yet a little after thou
shalt enjoy thy victuals. Upon which thou dost not call thyself
impudent, changed as thou art into a wild beast for nothing; but the
poor man, alarmed and trembling about his greater interests (for not
about delay, but about famine, is all his fear), him dost thou call
audacious, and shameless, and impudent, and all the most opprobrious
names? Nay, how is this anything but extreme impudence.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p90"></span>But these things we do not consider:
therefore we account such men troublesome: since if we at all searched
into our own doings, and compared them with theirs, we should not have
thought them intolerable.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p91"></span>Be not then a severe judge. Why, if thou
wert clear of all sins, not even then would the law of God permit thee
to be strict in searching out other men’s sins. And if the Pharisee
perished on this account, what defense are we to find? If He suffer not
such as have done well to be bitter in searching out other men’s doings,
much less them that have offended.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p92"></span>7. Let us not then be savage, nor cruel,
not without natural feeling, not implacable, not worse than wild beasts.
For I know many to have gone even so far in brutishness, as for a little
trouble to slight famishing persons, and to say these words: “I have no
servant now with me; we are far from home; there is no money-changer
that I know.” Oh cruelty! Didst thou promise the greater, and dost thou
not fulfill the less? To save thy walking a little way, doth he perish
with hunger? Oh insolence! Oh pride! Why, if it were ten furlongs to be
walked, oughtest thou to be backward? Doth it not even come into thy
mind that so thy reward is made greater? For whereas, when thou givest,
thou receivest reward for the gift only: when thou thyself also goest,
for this again is appointed thee a recompense.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p93"></span>Yea, the patriarch himself we admire for
this, that in his own person he ran to the herd, and snatched up the
calf, <span id="fr_1503"></span>[1504](#fn_1503.md) and that, when he had
three hundred and eighteen servants born in his house. <span
id="fr_1504"></span>[1505](#fn_1504.md) But now some are filled with so
much pride, as to do these things by servants, and not to be ashamed.
“But dost thou require me to do these things myself?” one may say. “How
then shall I not seem to be vainglorious?” Nay, but as it is, thou art
led by another kind of vainglory to do this, being ashamed to be seen
talking with a poor man.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p96"></span>But I am in no respect strict about this;
only give, whether by thyself or by another thou art minded to do so;
and do not accuse, do not smite, do not revile. For medicines, not
wounds, doth he need who comes unto thee; mercy, not a sword. For tell
me, if any one who had been smitten with a stone, and had received a
wound in his head, were to let go all others, and run unto thy knees,
drenched in his blood; wouldest thou indeed smite him with another
stone, and add unto him another wound? I, for my part, think not; but
even as it was, thou wouldest endeavor to cure it. Why then doest thou
the contrary with respect to the poor? Knowest thou not how much power a
word hath, both to raise up, and to cast down? “For a word,” it is said,
“is better than a gift.” <span id="fr_1505"></span>[1506](#fn_1505.md)

<span id="iii.XXXV-p98"></span>Dost thou not consider that thou art
thrusting the sword into thyself, and art receiving a more grievous
wound, when he, being reviled, silently withdraws, with groans and many
tears? Since indeed of God he is sent unto thee. Consider then, in
insulting him, upon whom thou art causing the insult to pass; when God
indeed sends him unto thee, and commands thee to give, but thou, so far
from giving, dost even insult him on his coming.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p99"></span>And if thou art not aware how exceedingly
amiss this is, look at it as among men, and then thou wilt fully know
the greatness of the sin. As thus: if a servant of thine had been
commanded by thee to go to another servant, who had money of thine, to
receive it, and were to come back not only with empty hands, but also
with despiteful usage; what wouldest thou not do to him that had wrought
the insult? What penalty wouldest thou not exact, as though, after this,
it were thyself that had been ill used?

<span id="iii.XXXV-p100"></span>This reckoning do thou make in regard of
<span id="page_233">p. 233</span> <span id="iii.XXXV-Page_233"></span>
God also; for truly it is He that sends the poor to us, and of His we
give, if indeed we do give. But if, besides not giving, we also send
them away insulted, consider how many bolts, how many thunders, that
which we are doing deserves.

<span id="iii.XXXV-p101"></span>Duly considering then all these things,
let us both bridle our tongue, and put away inhumanity, and let us
stretch forth the hand to give alms, and not with money only, but with
words also, let us relieve such as are in need; that we may both escape
the punishment for reviling, and may inherit the kingdom which is for
blessing and almsgiving, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord
Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might forever and ever. Amen.

used to chant a sort of song about the coming of the swallow. It was the
