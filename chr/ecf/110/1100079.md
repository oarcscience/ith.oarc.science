<span id="iii.LXXI-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iii.LXXI-p1.1"></span>Homily LXXIV.</span>

<span id="iii.LXXI-p2"></span>*“Woe unto you, because ye build the tombs
of the prophets, and garnish their sepulchers,* <span
id="fr_2695"></span>[2696](#fn_2695.md) *and say, If we had been in the
days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the
blood of the prophets.”*

<span id="iii.LXXI-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.LXXI-p4.1"></span>Not</span> because they build, nor because
they blame the others, doth He say, woe, but because, while both thus,
and by what they say, they are pretending to condemn their fathers, they
do worse. For in proof that the condemnation was a pretense, Luke saith,
ye do allow because ye build; for, “Woe unto you,” saith He, “for ye
build the sepulchers of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
Truly ye bear witness, and ye allow the deeds of your fathers, for they
indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchers.” <span
id="fr_2696"></span>[2697](#fn_2696.md) For here He reproves their purpose,
wherewith they built, that it was not for the honoring of them that were
slain, but as making a show of the murders, and afraid, lest, when the
tombs had perished by time, the proof and memory of such daring should
fade away, setting up these glorious buildings, as a kind of trophy, and
priding themselves in the daring deeds of those men, and displaying
them.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p6"></span>For the things that ye now dare to do,
show that ye do these things also in this spirit. For, though ye speak
the contrary, saith He, as condemning them, as, for instance, “We should
not, if we had been in their days, have been partakers with them;” yet
the disposition is evident wherewith ye say these things. Wherefore also
unfolding it, though darkly, still He hath expressed it. For when He had
said, ye say, “If we had been in the days of our fathers, we should not
have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets;” He added,
“Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of
them that slew the prophets.” And what blame is it to be a murderer’s
son, if one partake not in the mind of one’s father? None. Whence it is
evident, that for this same thing He brings it forward against them,
hinting at their affinity in wickedness.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p7"></span>And this is manifest too by what comes
after; He adds at least, “Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers.” <span
id="fr_2697"></span>[2698](#fn_2697.md) For as those beasts are like their
parents, in the destructiveness of their venom, so also are ye like your
fathers in murderousness.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p9"></span>Then, because He was searching their
temper of mind, which is to the more part obscure, He doth, from those
things also which they were about to perpetrate, which would be manifest
to all, establish His words. For, because He had said, “Wherefore ye be
witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed
the prophets,” making it evident, that of their affinity in wickedness
He is speaking, and that it was a pretense to say, “We should not have
been partakers with them,” He added, “Fill ye up therefore the measure
of your fathers,” <span id="fr_2698"></span>[2699](#fn_2698.md) not
commanding, but declaring beforehand, what was to be, that is, His own
murder.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p11"></span>Therefore, having brought in their
refutation, and having shown that they were pretenses which they said in
their own defense, as, for instance, “We would not have been partakers
with them,” (for they who refrain not from the Lord, how should they
have refrained from the servants), He makes after this His language more
condemnatory, <span id="fr_2699"></span>[2700](#fn_2699.md) calling them
“serpents, and generation of vipers,” and saying, “How shall ye escape
the damnation of hell,” <span id="fr_2700"></span>[2701](#fn_2700.md) at
once perpetrating such things, and denying them, and dissembling your
purpose?

<span id="iii.LXXI-p14"></span>Then rebuking them more exceedingly from
another cause also, He saith, “I will send unto you prophets, and wise
men, and scribes, and some of them shall ye kill and crucify, and some
of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues.” <span
id="fr_2701"></span>[2702](#fn_2701.md) For that they should not say,
“Though we crucified the Lord, yet from the servants we should have
refrained, if we had been then;” “Behold,” He saith, “I send servants
also to you, prophets likewise themselves, and neither will ye spare
them.” But these things He saith, showing that it was nothing strange,
that He should <span id="page_428">p. 428</span> <span
id="iii.LXXI-Page_428"></span> be murdered by those sons, being both
murderous and deceitful, and having much guile, and surpassing their
fathers in their outrages.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p16"></span>And besides what hath been said, He shows
them to be also exceedingly vainglorious. For when they say, “If we had
been in the days of our fathers, we should not have been partakers with
them,” they spake out of vainglory, and were practising virtue in words
only, but in their works doing the contrary.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p17"></span>Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers,
that is, wicked sons of wicked men, and more wicked than those who begat
them. For He showeth that they are committing greater crimes, both by
their committing them after those others, and by their doing much more
grievous things than they, and this, while positively affirming that
they never would have fallen into the same. For they add that which is
both the end and the crown of their evil deeds. For the others slew them
that came to the vineyard, but these, both the son, and them that were
bidding them to the wedding.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p18"></span>But these things He saith, to separate
them off from the affinity to Abraham, and to show that they had no
advantage from thence, unless they followed his works; wherefore also He
adds, “How can ye flee <span id="fr_2702"></span>[2703](#fn_2702.md) from
the damnation of hell,” when following them that have committed such
acts?

<span id="iii.LXXI-p20"></span>And here He recalls to their remembrance
John’s accusation, for he too called them by this name, and reminded
them of the judgment to come. Then, because they are nothing alarmed by
judgment and hell, by reason of their not believing them, and because
the thing is future, He awes them by the things present, and saith,
“Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets and scribes: and some of
them shall ye kill and crucify, and scourge; <span
id="fr_2703"></span>[2704](#fn_2703.md) that upon you may come all the
righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel,
unto the blood of Zacharias the son of Barachias, whom ye slew between
the temple <span id="fr_2704"></span>[2705](#fn_2704.md) and the altar.
Verily I say unto you, that all these things shall come upon this
generation.” <span id="fr_2705"></span>[2706](#fn_2705.md)

<span id="iii.LXXI-p24"></span>2. See by how many things He has warned
them. He said, Ye condemn your fathers, in that ye say, “We would not
have been partakers with them;” and this is no little thing to shame
them. He said, While ye condemn them, ye do worse things, even ye
yourselves; and this is sufficient to cover them with disgrace. He said,
These things shall not be without punishment; and hence he implants in
them fear beyond words. He hath reminded them at least of hell. Then
because that was to come, He brought home to them the terrors as even
present. “For all these things shall come,” He saith, “upon this
generation.”

<span id="iii.LXXI-p25"></span>He added also unspeakable severity to the
vengeance, saying, that they shall suffer more grievous things than all;
yet by none of these things did they become better. But if any one say,
And why do they suffer more grievously than all? we would say, Because
they have first committed more grievous things than all, and by none of
the things that have been done to them have they been brought to a sound
mind.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p26"></span>Heardest thou not Lamech saying, “Of
Lamech vengeance shall be taken seventy times sevenfold;” <span
id="fr_2706"></span>[2707](#fn_2706.md) that is, “I am deserving of more
punishment than Cain.” Why could this be? Yet he did not slay his
brother; but because not even by his example was he brought to a better
mind. And this is what God saith elsewhere, “Requiting the sins of
fathers upon children for the third and fourth generation of them that
hate me.” <span id="fr_2707"></span>[2708](#fn_2707.md) Not as though one
were to suffer punishment for the crimes committed by others, but
inasmuch as they who, after many sin and have been punished, yet have
not grown better, but have committed the same offenses, are justly
worthy to suffer their punishments also.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p29"></span>But see how seasonably he also mentioned
Abel, indicating that this murder likewise is of envy. What then have ye
to say? Know ye not what Cain suffered? Did God hold His peace at his
deeds? Did He not exact the severest penalty? Heard ye not what things
your fathers suffered, when they slew the prophets; were they not
delivered over to punishments, and inflictions of vengeance without
number? How then did ye not become better? And why do I speak of the
punishments of your fathers, and what they suffered? Thou who thyself
condemnest thy fathers, how is it thou doest worse? For moreover even ye
yourselves have declared that “He will miserably destroy those wicked
men.” <span id="fr_2708"></span>[2709](#fn_2708.md) What favor then will ye
have after this, committing such things after such a sentence?

<span id="iii.LXXI-p31"></span>But who is this Zacharias? Some say, the
father of John; some, the prophet; some, a priest with two different
names, whom the Scripture also calls, the son of Jehoiada. <span
id="fr_2709"></span>[2710](#fn_2709.md)

<span id="page_429">p. 429</span> <span id="iii.LXXI-Page_429"></span>

<span id="iii.LXXI-p33"></span>But do thou mark this, that the outrage
was twofold. For not only did they slay holy men, but also in a holy
place. And saying these things, He did not only alarm them, but also
comfort His disciples, showing that the righteous men also who were
before them suffered these things. But these He alarmed, foretelling
that like as they paid their penalty, even so should these too suffer
the utmost extremities. Therefore He calls them <span
id="fr_2710"></span>[2711](#fn_2710.md) “prophets, and wise men, and
scribes,” even hereby again taking away every plea of theirs. “For ye
cannot say,” He saith, “Thou didst send from among the Gentiles, and
therefore we were offended;” but they were led on unto this by being
murderous, and thirsting for blood. Wherefore He also said beforehand,
“For this cause do I send prophets and scribes.” This did the prophets
also lay to their charge, saying, “They mingle blood with blood,” <span
id="fr_2711"></span>[2712](#fn_2711.md) and that they are men of blood.
Therefore also did He command the blood to be offered to Him, showing
that if in a brute it be thus precious, much more in a man. Which He
saith to Noah likewise, “I will require all blood that is shed.” <span
id="fr_2712"></span>[2713](#fn_2712.md) And ten thousand other such things
might one find Him enjoining with regard to their not committing murder;
wherefore He commanded them not even to eat that which was strangled.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p37"></span>Oh the love of God towards man! that
though He foreknew they would profit nothing, He still doeth His part.
For I will send, He saith, and this knowing they would be slain. So that
even hereby they were convicted of saying vainly, “We should not have
been partakers with our fathers.” For these too slew prophets even in
their synagogues, and reverenced neither the place, nor the dignity of
the persons. For not merely ordinary persons did they slay, but prophets
and wise men, such that they had nothing to lay to their charge. And by
these He meaneth the apostles, and those after them, for, indeed, many
prophesied. Then, willing to aggravate their fears, He saith, “Verily,
verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this
generation;” that is, I will bring all upon your heads, and will make
the vengeance sore. For he that knew many to have sinned, and was not
sobered, but himself hath committed the same sins again, and not the
same only, but also far more grievous, would justly deserve to suffer a
far more grievous punishment than they. For like as, if he had been
minded, he would have gained greatly, had he grown better by their
examples, even so, since he continued without amendment, he is liable to
a heavier vengeance, as having had the benefit of more warning by them
who had sinned before and been punished, and having reaped no advantage.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p38"></span>3. Then He directs His speech unto the
city, in this way too being minded to correct His hearers, and saith, “O
Jerusalem, Jerusalem!” <span id="fr_2713"></span>[2714](#fn_2713.md) What
meaneth the repetition? this is the manner of one pitying her, and
bemoaning her, and greatly loving her. For, like as unto a woman
beloved, herself indeed ever loved, but who had despised Him that loved
her, and therefore on the point of being punished, He pleads, being now
about to inflict the punishment. Which He doth in the prophets also,
using these words, “I said, Turn thou unto me, and she returned
not.” <span id="fr_2714"></span>[2715](#fn_2714.md)

<span id="iii.LXXI-p41"></span>Then having called her, He tells also her
blood-stained deeds, “Thou that killest <span
id="fr_2715"></span>[2716](#fn_2715.md) the prophets, and stonest them that
are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children
together, and ye would not,” in this way also pleading for His own
dealings; not even with these things hast thou turned me aside, nor
withdrawn me from my great affection toward thee, but it was my desire
even so, not once or twice, but often to draw thee unto me. “For how
often would I have gathered your children together, even as a hen
gathereth her chickens, and ye would not.” <span
id="fr_2716"></span>[2717](#fn_2716.md) And this He saith, to show that
they were ever scattering themselves by their sins. And His affection He
indicates by the similitude; for indeed the creature is warm in its love
towards its brood. And everywhere in the prophets is this same image of
the wings, and in the song of Moses and in the Psalms, indicating His
great protection and care.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p44"></span>“But ye would not,” He saith. “Behold
your house is left desolate,” <span id="fr_2717"></span>[2718](#fn_2717.md)
stripped of the succor which cometh from me. Surely it was the same, who
also was before protecting them, and holding them together, and
preserving them; surely it was He who was ever chastening them. And He
appoints a punishment, which they had ever dreaded exceedingly; for it
declared the entire overthrow of their polity. “For I say unto you, Ye
shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is He that
cometh in the name of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_2718"></span>[2719](#fn_2718.md) And this is the language of one
that loves earnestly, earnestly drawing them unto Him by the things to
come, not merely <span id="page_430">p. 430</span> <span
id="iii.LXXI-Page_430"></span> warning them by the past; for of the
future day of His second coming doth He here speak.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p47"></span>What then? Did they not see Him from that
time? But it is not that hour which He meaneth in saying, Henceforth,
but the time up to His crucifixion.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p48"></span>For since they were forever accusing Him
of this, that He was a kind of rival God, and a foe to God, He moves
them to love Him by this, namely, by showing Himself to be of one accord
with His Father; and He indicates Himself to be the same that was in the
prophets. Wherefore also He uses the same words as did the prophets.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p49"></span>And by these He intimated both His
resurrection, and His second coming, and made it plain even to the
utterly unbelieving, that then most surely they should worship Him. And
how did He make this plain? By speaking of many things that were first
to be, that He should send prophets, that they should kill them; that it
should be in the synagogues; that they should suffer the utmost
extremities; that their house should be left desolate; that they should
undergo things more grievous than any, and such as never were undergone
before. For all these things are enough to furnish even to the most
senseless and contentious a clear proof of that which should come to
pass at His coming.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p50"></span>For I will ask them, Did He send the
prophets and wise men? Did they slay them in their synagogue? Was their
house left desolate? Did all the vengeance come upon that generation? It
is quite plain that it was so, and no man gainsays it. As then all these
things came to pass, so shall those also come to pass, and most surely
they shall submit then.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p51"></span>But they shall derive thence no advantage
in the way of defense, as neither will they who repent of their course
of life then.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p52"></span>Wherefore let us, while it is time,
practise what is good. For like as they henceforth derived no advantage
from their knowledge, even so neither shall we ourselves from our
repentance for our wickedness. For neither to the pilot, when the bark
is sunk in the sea from his remissness, will there remain anything more;
nor to the physician, when the sick man is gone; but each of these must
before the end devise, and execute all things, so as to be involved in
no danger, nor shame; but after this, all is unprofitable.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p53"></span>Let us also then, while in sickness, send
for physicians, and lay out money, and exert unceasing diligence, that
having risen up from our affliction, we may depart hence in health.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p54"></span>And as much care as we exert about our
servants, when their bodies are sick, so much let us show forth upon
ourselves, when our soul is diseased. And indeed we are nearer to
ourselves than our servants, and our souls are more necessary than those
bodies, but nevertheless it were well if we exert at least an equal
diligence. For if we do not this now, when gone, thenceforth we may
obtain nothing more in the way of plea.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p55"></span>4. Who is so wretched, one may say, as
not to show even as much thought as this? Why this is the marvellous
thing, that we are held in so little esteem with our ownselves, that we
despise ourselves more than our servants. For when our servants are sick
of a fever, we send for physicians, and make a separation in the house,
and compel them to obey the laws of that art; and if these are
neglected, we are displeased with them, and set persons to watch them,
who will not, even should they wish them, suffer them to satiate their
desire; and if they who have the care of these persons should say, that
medicines must be procured at great cost, we yield; and whatsoever they
may enjoin, we obey, and we pay them hire for these injunctions.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p56"></span>But when we are sick (or rather there is
no time when we are not sick), we do not so much as call in the
physician, we do not lay out money, but as though some ruffian, <span
id="fr_2719"></span>[2720](#fn_2719.md) and enemy, and foes were concerned,
so do we disregard our soul. And these things I say, not finding fault
with our attention towards our servants, but thinking it meet to take at
least as much care of our souls. And how should we do? one may say. Show
it to Paul when ill; call in Matthew; let John sit by it. Hear from
them, what we ought to do that is thus ill, they will surely tell, and
will not conceal. For they are not dead, but live and speak. But doth
the soul take no heed to them, being weighed down by the fever? Do thou
compel it, and awaken its reasoning power. Call in the prophets. There
is no need to pay money to these physicians, for neither do they
themselves demand hire for themselves, nor for the medicines which they
prepare do they drive thee to the necessity of expense, except for
almsgiving; but in everything else they even add to thy possessions; as,
for instance, when they require thee to be temperate, they deliver thee
from unseasonable and wrong expenses; when they tell thee to abstain
from drunkenness, they make thee wealthier. Seest thou the skill of
physicians, who besides health, are supplying thee also with riches? Sit
down therefore by <span id="page_431">p. 431</span> <span
id="iii.LXXI-Page_431"></span> them, and learn of them the nature of thy
disease. For instance, dost thou love wealth, and greedy gain, like as
the fevered love water? Listen at any rate to their admonitions. For
like as the physician saith to thee, If thou wilt gratify thy desire,
thou wilt perish, and undergo this or that; even so also Paul: “They
that will be rich, fall into temptation, and a snare of the devil, and
into foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and
perdition.” <span id="fr_2720"></span>[2721](#fn_2720.md)

<span id="iii.LXXI-p59"></span>But art thou impatient? Hear him saying,
“Yet a little while, and He that cometh will come, and will not
tarry. <span id="fr_2721"></span>[2722](#fn_2721.md) The Lord is at hand,
be careful for nothing;” <span id="fr_2722"></span>[2723](#fn_2722.md) and
again, “The fashion of this world passeth away.” <span
id="fr_2723"></span>[2724](#fn_2723.md)

<span id="iii.LXXI-p63"></span>For neither doth he command only, but
also soothes, as a physician should. And like as they devise some other
things in the place of cold things, so doth this man draw off <span
id="fr_2724"></span>[2725](#fn_2724.md) the desire another way. Dost thou
wish to be rich, saith he; let it be “in good works.” Dost thou desire
to lay up treasure? I forbid it not at all; only let it be in Heaven.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p65"></span>And like as the physician saith, that
what is cold is hurtful to teeth, to nerves, to bones; so he too, more
briefly indeed, as heedful of brevity, yet far more, clearly and more
powerfully, saith, “For the love of money is the root of all
evils.” <span id="fr_2725"></span>[2726](#fn_2725.md)

<span id="iii.LXXI-p67"></span>Of what then should one make use? He
tells this also: of contentedness instead of covetousness. “For
contentment,” he saith, “with godliness is great gain.” <span
id="fr_2726"></span>[2727](#fn_2726.md) But if thou art dissatisfied, and
desirest more, and art not yet equal to cast away all superfluous
things, he tells also him that is thus diseased, how he ought to handle
these things too. “That they that rejoice in wealth, be as though they
rejoiced not; and they that have, as though they possessed not; and they
that use this world, as not abusing it.” <span
id="fr_2727"></span>[2728](#fn_2727.md)

<span id="iii.LXXI-p70"></span>Seest thou what manner of things he
enjoins? Wilt thou call in also another physician besides? To me at
least it seems well. For neither are these physicians like those of the
body, who often, while vying one with another, overwhelm the sick man.
But not so these, for they have regard to the health of the sick, not to
their own vainglory. Be not then afraid of the number of them; one
Master speaks in all, that is, Christ.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p71"></span>5. See, for instance, another again
entering in, and saying severe things concerning this disease, or rather
it is the Master by him; <span id="fr_2728"></span>[2729](#fn_2728.md) “For
ye cannot serve God and mammon.” <span
id="fr_2729"></span>[2730](#fn_2729.md) Yea, saith he, and how will these
things be? how shall we cease from the desire? Hence may we learn this
also. And how shall we know? Hear him saying this too: “Lay not up for
yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt,
and where thieves break through and steal.” <span
id="fr_2730"></span>[2731](#fn_2730.md)

<span id="iii.LXXI-p75"></span>Seest thou how by the place, by the
things that waste there, He draws men off from this desire that is here,
and rivets them to Heaven, where all things are impregnable? For if ye
transfer your wealth there where neither rust nor moth corrupts, nor
thieves break through and steal, ye will both expel this disease, and
establish your soul in the greatest abundance.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p76"></span>And together with what we have said, He
brings forward an example also to teach thee moderation. And like as the
physician, to alarm the sick man saith, that such a one died from the
use of cold water; so doth He also bring in the rich man, <span
id="fr_2731"></span>[2732](#fn_2731.md) laboring indeed, and longing for
life and health, but not able to attain thereto, because of having set
his heart on covetousness, but going away empty. And besides this man,
another is shown to thee again by another evangelist, he that was in
torment, <span id="fr_2732"></span>[2733](#fn_2732.md) and was not master
so much as of a drop of water. Then showing that His injunctions are
easy, He saith, “Behold the fowls of the air.” <span
id="fr_2733"></span>[2734](#fn_2733.md) But being compassionate, He suffers
not even the rich to despair. “For the things which are impossible with
men, are possible with God,” <span id="fr_2734"></span>[2735](#fn_2734.md)
saith He. For though thou be rich, the physician is able to cure thee.
For neither was it wealth that He took away, but to be slave of riches,
and a lover of greedy gain.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p81"></span>How then is it possible for the rich man
to be saved. By possessing his goods in common with them that are in
need, being such as Job was, and exterminating out of his soul the
desire of more, and in no points going beyond real need.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p82"></span>He shows thee together with these this
selfsame publican also, that was grievously oppressed by the fever of
covetousness, quickly set free from it. For what more sordid than a
publican? Nevertheless, the man became indifferent to wealth from
obeying the laws of the physician. For indeed He hath for His disciples
such persons as these, that were sick of the same diseases as we are,
and have recovered their health quickly. And He shows us each, in order
we may not despair. See at least this publican. Mark again another, a
chief of the publicans, who promised four fold indeed for all that he
had extorted, and <span id="page_432">p. 432</span> <span
id="iii.LXXI-Page_432"></span> the half of all that he possessed, that
he might receive Jesus.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p83"></span>But art thou on fire with exceeding
desire for riches. Have the possessions of all men instead of thine own.
For indeed I give thee, He saith, more than thou seekest, in opening to
thee the houses of the wealthy throughout the world. “For whosoever hath
forsaken father or mother, or lands, or house, shall receive an
hundredfold.” <span id="fr_2735"></span>[2736](#fn_2735.md) Thus wilt thou
not enjoy more abundant possessions only, but thou wilt even remove this
grievous thirst altogether, and wilt endure all things easily, so far
from desiring more, not seeking often even necessary things. Thus doth
Paul suffer hunger, and is held in honor more than when he ate.
Forasmuch as a wrestler also, when striving, and winning crowns, would
not choose to give up and to be in repose; and a merchant who hath
entered on sea voyages would not desire to be afterwards in idleness.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p85"></span>And we therefore, if we should taste as
we ought of spiritual fruits, shall thenceforth not even account the
things present to be anything, being seized by the desire of the things
to come as with some most noble intoxication.

<span id="iii.LXXI-p86"></span>Let us taste of them, therefore, that we
may both be delivered from the turmoil of the things present, and may
attain the good things to come, by the grace and love towards man of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory and the might, now and ever, and
world without end. Amen.
