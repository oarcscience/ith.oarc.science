<span id="iii.ii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ii-p3.1"></span>The</span> Homilies of St. Chrysostom on St.
Matthew were undoubtedly delivered at Antioch (see Hom. vii. p. 43) and
probably in the latter part of the time during which he preached as a
Presbyter. Montfaucon considers his little mention of the sin of
swearing a sign of his having accomplished some reformation on that
point by his previous exertions. In the Homilies delivered from 386 to
388, it is a constant topic; and the Homilies known to belong to that
date are so numerous, as scarcely leave room for such a series as the
present. These, however, contain very little to mark the period to which
they belong. The argument from his reference to dissensions some time
gone by, possibly those between St. Meletius and Paulinus and Evagrius,
in commenting on St. [Matt. xxiii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#006.md)<span id="iii.ii-p3.2"></span>. is
not very conclusive.

<span id="iii.ii-p4"></span>A modern reader must sometimes be struck
with finding in St. Chrysostom a kind of criticism, which we are apt to
think belongs only to later times. His main object, however, is moral,
and he searches out with diligence both the meaning and the applications
of particular passages, usually concluding with an eloquent exhortation
to some special virtue. Some of the most remarkable of these
exhortations are on the subject of Alms-giving, which he seems to have
pressed with some success at last. His calculation in Hom. lxvi. as to
what might be done, is somewhat curious. In the end of Hom. lxxxviii. he
demands a reformation as the condition of his entering on the
controversy with Infidels. In the next Homily he discusses the evidence
of the Resurrection with nearly the same arguments as would still be
used against an objector.

<span id="iii.ii-p5"></span>The Theatres are the theme of his frequent
reprobation, and the Monks of the mountains near Antioch of his praise.
In Hom. lxix. and lxx. he describes their mode of life as an edifying
example to all. He frequently attacks the Anomœan or extreme Arian
Heresy, and sometimes also the Manichæan. It is perhaps worth while to
recollect the nearly contemporaneous prevalence of Manichæism in the
West, as it appears in the early history of St. Augustine. In Hom.
lxxxvi. there are some remarks on the device of Satan by which evil is
introduced by little and little, which are worthy of consideration as
applicable to the growth of erroneous doctrine and practice within the
Church.

<span id="iii.ii-p6"></span>For all information with respect to the Text
and Manuscripts of these Homilies, the learned reader is referred to the
Greek Edition of Mr. Field, which has been of great service, as
affording a safe basis for the Translation. The paucity of materials
possessed by Savile, and the carelessness of the Benedictine Editor, had
left much room for improvement by a judicious and faithful use of the
existing copies. It may now at last be hoped, that we have a Text very
closely approximating to the genuine work of the Author.

<span id="iii.ii-p7"></span>For the Translation, the Editors are
indebted to the <span class="c20"><span id="iii.ii-p7.1"></span>Rev. Sir
George Prevost, M.A.</span> of Oriel College, and for the Index to the
<span class="c20"><span id="iii.ii-p7.2"></span>Rev. J. E. Tweed,
M.A.</span> of Christ Church, Oxford. It will be their endeavor to
complete the commentaries of St. Chrysostom on the New Testament, by
bringing out the remainder of the Homilies on the Acts of the Apostles,
and those on the Epistle to the Hebrews, as soon as they are able. In
both instances, however, the corrupt state of the Text has occasioned
some difficulty and delay.
