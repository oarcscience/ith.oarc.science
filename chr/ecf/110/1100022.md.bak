<span id="iii.XIV-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iii.XIV-p1.1"></span>Homily XIV.</span>

<span id="iii.XIV-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.XIV-p2.1"></span>[Matt. IV.
12](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#012.md)<span
id="iii.XIV-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="iii.XIV-p3"></span>“Now when Jesus had heard that John was
delivered up, He departed into Galilee.”

<span id="iii.XIV-p4"></span>1. <span class="c20"><span
id="iii.XIV-p4.1"></span>Wherefore</span> doth He depart? Again
instructing us not to go to meet temptations, <span
id="fr_560"></span>[561](#fn_560.md) but to give place and withdraw
ourselves. For it is no reproach, the not casting one’s self into
danger, but the failing to stand manfully when fallen into it. To teach
us this accordingly, and to soothe the envy of the Jews, He retires to
Capernaum; at once fulfilling the prophecy, <span
id="fr_561"></span>[562](#fn_561.md) and making haste to catch the teachers
of the world: for they, as <span id="page_84">p. 84</span> <span
id="iii.XIV-Page_84"></span> you know, were abiding there, following
their craft.

<span id="iii.XIV-p7"></span>But mark, I pray thee, how in every case
when He is about to depart unto the Gentiles, He hath the occasion given
Him by Jews. For so in this instance, by plotting against His
forerunner, and casting him into prison, they thrust out Christ into the
Galilee of the Gentiles. For to show that He neither speaks of the
Jewish nation by a part of it, nor signifies obscurely all the tribes;
mark how the Prophet distinguishes that place, saying “The land of
Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, <span
id="fr_562"></span>[563](#fn_562.md) beyond Jordan, Galilee of the
Gentiles, the people which sat in darkness, saw great light:” <span
id="fr_563"></span>[564](#fn_563.md) by darkness here not meaning that
which is sensible, but men’s errors and ungodliness. Wherefore he also
added, “They which sat in the region and shadow of death, to them light
is sprung up.” For that thou mightest learn that neither the light nor
the darkness which he speaks of are sensible, in discoursing of the
light, he called it not merely light, but “a great light” which
elsewhere he expresses by the word, True: <span
id="fr_564"></span>[565](#fn_564.md) and in describing the darkness, he
termed it, “a shadow of death.”

<span id="iii.XIV-p11"></span>Then implying that they did not of
themselves seek and find, but that God showed Himself to them from
above, he saith to them, “Light is sprung up;” that is, the light of
itself sprang up and shone forth: it was not that they first ran to the
light. For in truth the condition of men was at the worst before
Christ’s coming. Since they more than “walked in darkness;” they “sat in
darkness;” a kind of sign that they did not even hope to be delivered.
For as persons not even knowing where to put a step forward, so they
sat, overtaken by the darkness, not being able so much as to stand any
more.

<span id="iii.XIV-p12"></span>2. “From that time Jesus began to preach
and to say, Repent; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”

<span id="iii.XIV-p13"></span>“From that time:” what time? After John
was cast into prison. And wherefore did He not preach to them from the
beginning? Indeed what occasion for John at all, when the witness of His
works was proclaiming Him?

<span id="iii.XIV-p14"></span>That hence also thou mightest learn His
dignity; namely, that as the Fathers, so He too hath prophets; to which
purpose Zacharias also spake; “And thou, child, shalt be called a
prophet of the Highest.” <span id="fr_565"></span>[566](#fn_565.md) And
that he might leave no occasion to the shameless Jews; which motive He
himself alleged, saying, “John came neither eating nor drinking, and
they say, he hath a devil. The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and
they say, Behold a man gluttonous and a winebibber, a friend of
publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.” <span
id="fr_566"></span>[567](#fn_566.md)

<span id="iii.XIV-p17"></span>And moreover it was necessary that what
concerned Him should be spoken by another first and not by Himself. For
if even after both testimonies and demonstrations so many and so great,
they said, “Thou bearest record of Thyself, Thy record is not
true:” <span id="fr_567"></span>[568](#fn_567.md) had He, without John’s
saying anything, come into the midst, and first borne record Himself;
what would they not have said? For this cause, neither did He preach
before John, nor did He work miracles, until John was cast into prison;
lest in this way the multitude should be divided. Therefore also John
did no miracle at all; that by this means also might give over the
multitude to Jesus, His miracles drawing them unto Him.

<span id="iii.XIV-p19"></span>Again, if even after so many divine
precautions, <span id="fr_568"></span>[569](#fn_568.md) John’s disciples,
both before and after his imprisonment, were jealously disposed towards
Him, and the people too suspected not Him but John to be the Christ;
what would not the result have been, had none of these things taken
place? For this cause both Matthew distinctly notes, that “from that
time He began to preach;” and when He began His preaching, He Himself
also taught this same doctrine, which the other used to preach; and no
word as yet concerning Himself doth the doctrine which he preached say.
Because it was for the time a great thing even for this to be received,
forasmuch as they had not as yet the proper opinion about Him. Therefore
also at the beginning He puts nothing severe or grievous, as the other
did, mentioning an axe, and a tree cut down; a fan, and a
threshing-floor, and unquenchable fire; but *His* preludes are gracious:
the Heavens and the kingdom there are the good tidings which he declares
to His hearers.

<span id="iii.XIV-p21"></span>3. “And walking by the sea of Galilee, He
saw two brethren, Simon that was surnamed Peter, and Andrew his brother,
casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers. And He saith unto
them, Come ye after me, and I will make you fishers of men. And they
left their nets, and followed Him.” <span
id="fr_569"></span>[570](#fn_569.md)

<span id="iii.XIV-p23"></span>And yet John saith that they were called
<span id="page_85">p. 85</span> <span id="iii.XIV-Page_85"></span> in
another manner. Whence it is evident that this was a second call; and
from many things one may perceive this. For there it is said, that they
came to Him when “John was not yet cast into prison;” but here, after he
was in confinement. And there Andrew calls Peter, but here Jesus calls
both. And John saith, Jesus seeing Simon coming, saith, “Thou art Simon,
the Son of Jona, thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by
interpretation, a stone.” <span id="fr_570"></span>[571](#fn_570.md) But
Matthew saith that he was already called by that name; for his words
are, “Seeing Simon that was called Peter.” And from the place whence
they were called, and from many other things, one may perceive this; and
from their ready obedience, and abandonment of all. For now they were
well instructed beforehand. Thus, in the other case, Andrew is seen
coming into His house, and hearing many things; but here, having heard
one bare word, they followed immediately. Since neither was it
unnatural <span id="fr_571"></span>[572](#fn_571.md) for them to follow Him
at the beginning, and then leave Him again and return anew to their own
craft, when they saw both John thrown into prison, and Himself
departing. Accordingly you see that He finds them actually fishing. But
He neither forbad them at the first when minded to withdraw, nor having
withdrawn themselves, did He let them go altogether; but He gave way
when they started aside from Him, and comes again to win them back;
which kind of thing is the great point in fishing. <span
id="fr_572"></span>[573](#fn_572.md)

<span id="iii.XIV-p27"></span>But mark both their faith, and their
obedience. For though they were in the midst of their work (and ye know
how greedy a thing fishing is), when they heard His command, they
delayed not, they procrastinated not, they said not, “let us return
home, and converse with our kinsfolk,” but “they forsook all and
followed,” even as Elisha did to Elijah.” <span
id="fr_573"></span>[574](#fn_573.md) Because such is the obedience which
Christ seeks of us, as that we delay not even a moment of time, though
something absolutely most needful should vehemently press on us.
Wherefore also when some other had come unto Him, and was asking leave
to bury his own father, <span id="fr_574"></span>[575](#fn_574.md) not even
this did He permit him to do; to signify that before all we ought to
esteem the following of Himself.

<span id="iii.XIV-p30"></span>But if thou should say, “the promise is
very great;” even for this do I most admire them, for that when they had
not as yet seen any sign, they believed in so great a reach of promise,
and accounted all but second to that attendance. And this, because they
believed that by what words they were caught, by the same they would be
able to catch others also.

<span id="iii.XIV-p31"></span>To these, then, such was His promise: but
to James and John He saith no such thing. For the obedience of those
that had gone before had by this time paved the way for these. And
besides they had also heard many things before concerning Him.

<span id="iii.XIV-p32"></span>And see how he doth with exact care
intimate unto us their poverty also: in that He found them sewing up
their nets. So exceeding great was their poverty, that they were mending
what was worn out, not being able to buy others. And this too was for
the time no small proof of virtue, their beating poverty with ease,
their supporting themselves by honest labor, their being bound one to
another by the power of love, their having their father with them, and
attending upon them.

<span id="iii.XIV-p33"></span>4. When therefore He had caught them, then
He begins in their presence to work miracles, by His deeds confirming
the words of John concerning Him. And He was continually frequenting
their synagogues, even by this instructing them that He was not a sort
of adversary of God and deceiver, but that He was come in accordance
with the Father.

<span id="iii.XIV-p34"></span>And while frequenting them, He did not
preach only, but also showed forth miracles. And this, because on every
occasion, whensoever anything is done strange and surprising, and any
polity is introduced, God is wont to work miracles as pledges of his
power, which He affords to them that are to receive His laws. Thus, for
instance, when He was about to make man, He created a whole world, and
then gave him that law which he had in Paradise. And when He was to give
laws to Noah, He showed forth anew great miracles, in that He reduced
again the whole creation to its elements, <span
id="fr_575"></span>[576](#fn_575.md) and made that fearful sea to prevail
for a full year; and in that, amid so great a tempest, He preserved that
righteous man. And in the time of Abraham too He vouchsafed many signs;
as his victory in the war, the plague upon Pharaoh, his deliverance from
dangers. And when about to legislate for the Jews, He showed forth those
marvellous and great prodigies, and then gave the law. Just so in this
case also, being to introduce a certain high polity, and to tell them
what they had never heard, by the display of the miracles He confirms
what He saith.

<span id="iii.XIV-p36"></span>Thus because the kingdom He was preach
<span id="page_86">p. 86</span> <span id="iii.XIV-Page_86"></span> ing
appeared not, by the things that appear, He makes it, though invisible,
manifest.

<span id="iii.XIV-p37"></span>And mark the evangelist’s care to avoid
superfluity of words; <span id="fr_576"></span>[577](#fn_576.md) how he
tells us not of every one of them that are healed, but in a few words
speeds over showers of miracles. <span id="fr_577"></span>[578](#fn_577.md)

<span id="iii.XIV-p40"></span>For “they brought unto Him,” saith he,
“all that were sick with divers diseases, and torments, and those which
were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that
had the palsy, and He healed them.”

<span id="iii.XIV-p41"></span>But our inquiry is this; why it can have
been that He demanded faith of none of them? For He said not, what we
find Him saying after this, “Believe ye that I am able to do
this?” <span id="fr_578"></span>[579](#fn_578.md) because He had not as yet
given proof of His power. And besides, the very act of approaching Him,
and of bringing others to Him, exhibited no common faith. For they
brought them even from far; whereas they would never have brought them,
unless they had persuaded themselves of great things concerning Him.

<span id="iii.XIV-p43"></span>Now then, let us too follow Him; for we
also have many diseases of our soul, and these especially He would fain
heal. Since with this intent He corrects that other sort, that He may
banish these out of our soul.

<span id="iii.XIV-p44"></span>5. Let us therefore come unto Him, and let
us ask nothing pertaining to this life, but rather remission of sins.
For indeed He gives it even now, if we be in earnest. Since as then “His
fame went out into Syria,” so now into the whole world. And they indeed
ran together on hearing that He healed persons possessed: and thou,
after having much more and greater experience of His power, dost thou
not rouse thyself and run?

<span id="iii.XIV-p45"></span>But whereas they left both country, and
friends, and kinsfolk; endurest thou not so much as to leave thy house
for the sake of drawing near, and obtaining far greater things? Or
rather we do not require of thee so much as this, but leave thy evil
habits only, and thou canst easily be made whole, remaining at home with
thy friends.

<span id="iii.XIV-p46"></span>But as it is, if we have any bodily
ailment, we do and contrive everything to be rid of what pains us; but
when our soul is indisposed, we delay, and draw back. For which cause
neither from the other sort are we delivered: since the things that are
indispensable are becoming to us secondary, and the secondary
indispensable; and letting alone the fountain of our ills, we would fain
cleanse out the streams.

<span id="iii.XIV-p47"></span>For that our bodily ills are caused by the
wickedness of the soul, is shown both by him that had the palsy thirty
and eight years, and by him that was let down through the roof, and by
Cain also before these; and from many other things likewise one may
perceive this. Let us do away then with the well-spring of our evils,
and all the channels of our diseases will be stayed. For the disease is
not palsy only, but also our sin; and this more than that, by how much a
soul is better than a body.

<span id="iii.XIV-p48"></span>Let us therefore now also draw nigh unto
Him; let us entreat Him that He would brace our paralyzed soul, and
leaving all things that pertain to this life, let us take account of the
things spiritual only. Or if thou cleave unto these also, yet think of
them after the other.

<span id="iii.XIV-p49"></span>Neither must thou think lightly of it,
because thou hast no pain in sinning; rather on this very account most
of all do thou lament, that thou feelest not the anguish of thine
offenses. For not because sin bites not, doth this come to pass, but
because the offending soul is insensible. Regard with this view them
that have a feeling of their own sins, how they wail more bitterly than
such as are being cut, or burned; how many things they do, how many
suffer, how greatly they mourn and lament, in order to be delivered from
their evil conscience. They would not do any such thing, unless they
were exceedingly pained in soul.

<span id="iii.XIV-p50"></span>The best thing then is, to avoid sin in
the first instance: the next to it, is to feel that we sin, and
thoroughly amend ourselves. But if we have not this, how shall we pray
to God, and ask forgiveness of our sins, we who take no account of these
matters? For when thou thyself who hast offended art unwilling to know
so much as this very fact, that thou hast sinned; for what manner of
offenses will thou entreat God for pardon? For what thou knowest not?
And how wilt thou know the greatness of the benefit? Tell therefore
thine offenses in particular, that thou mayest learn for what thou
receivest forgiveness, that so thou mayest become grateful towards thy
Benefactor.

<span id="iii.XIV-p51"></span>But thou, when it is a man whom thou hast
provoked, entreatest friends, neighbors, and door-keepers, and spendest
money, and consumest many days in visiting and petitioning, and though
he that is provoked utterly reject thee once, twice, ten thousand times
over, thou despondest not, but becoming more earnest thou makest the
more entreaty; but when the God of all is provoked, we gape, and throw
ourselves back, and live in luxury and in drunkenness, and do <span
id="page_87">p. 87</span> <span id="iii.XIV-Page_87"></span> all things
as usual. And when shall we be able to propitiate Him? and how shall we
by this very thing fail to provoke Him so much the more? For not so much
sinning, as signing without even pain, causes in Him indignation and
wrath. Wherefore it were meet after all this to sink into the very
earth, and not so much as to behold this sun, nor to breathe at all, for
that having so placable a Master, we provoke Him first, and then have no
remorse for provoking Him. And yet He assuredly, even when He is wroth,
doeth not so as hating and turning away from us, but in order that in
this way at least He may win us over to Himself. For if He continued
after insult befriending thee, thou wouldest the more despise Him.
Therefore in order that this may not be, He turns away for a little
while, to have thee ever with Himself.

<span id="iii.XIV-p52"></span>6. Let us now, I pray you, take courage at
His love to man, and let us show forth an anxious repentance, before the
day come on, which permits us not to profit thereby. For as yet all
depends on us, but then He that judges hath alone control over the
sentence. “Let us therefore come before His face with confession;” <span
id="fr_579"></span>[580](#fn_579.md) let us bewail, let us mourn. For if we
should be able to prevail upon the Judge before the appointed day to
forgive us our sins, then we need not so much as enter into the court;
as on the other hand, if this be not done, He will hear us publicly in
the presence of the world, and we shall no longer have any hope of
pardon. For no one of those who have not done away with their sins here,
when he hath departed thither shall be able to escape his account for
them; but as they who are taken out of these earthly prisons are brought
in their chains to the place of judgment, even so all souls, when they
have gone away hence bound with the manifold chains of their sins, are
led to the awful judgment-seat. For in truth our present life is nothing
better than a prison. But as when we have entered into that apartment,
we see all bound with chains; so now if we withdraw ourselves from
outward show, and enter into each man’s life, into each man’s soul, we
shall see it bound with chains more grievous than iron: and this most
especially if thou enter into the souls of them that are rich. For the
more men have about them, so much the more are they bound. As therefore
with regard to the prisoner, when thou seest him with irons on his back,
on his hands, and often on his feet too, thou dost therefore most of all
account him miserable; so also as to the rich man, when thou seest him
encompassed with innumerable affairs, let him not be therefore rich, but
rather for these very things wretched, in thine account. For together
with these bonds, he hath a cruel jailor too, the wicked love of riches;
which suffers him not to pass out of this prison, but provides for him
thousands of fetters, and guards, and doors, and bolts; and when he hath
cast him into the inner prison, persuades him even to feel pleasure in
these bonds; that he may not find so much as any hope of deliverance
from the evils which press on him.

<span id="iii.XIV-p54"></span>And if in thought thou wert to lay open
that man’s soul, thou wouldest see it not bound only, but squalid, and
filthy, and teeming with vermin. For no better than vermin are the
pleasures of luxury, but even more abominable, and destroy the body
more, together with the soul also; and upon the one and upon the other
they bring ten thousand scourges of sickness.

<span id="iii.XIV-p55"></span>On account then of all these things let us
entreat the Redeemer of our souls, that He would both burst asunder our
bands, and remove this our cruel jailor, and having set us free from the
burden of those iron chains, He would make our spirits lighter than any
wing. And as we entreat Him, so let us contribute our own part,
earnestness, and consideration, and an excellent zeal. For thus we shall
be able both in a short time to be freed from the evils which now
oppress us, and to learn in what condition we were before, and to lay
hold on the liberty which belongs to us; unto which God grant we may all
attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to
whom be glory and power forever and ever. Amen.
