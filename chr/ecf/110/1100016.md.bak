<span id="iii.VIII-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iii.VIII-p1.1"></span>Homily VIII.</span>

<span id="iii.VIII-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.VIII-p2.1"></span>[Matt. II.
2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.VIII-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="iii.VIII-p3"></span>*“And when they were come into the house,
they saw the young Child with Mary His mother.”* <span
id="fr_341"></span>[342](#fn_341.md)

<span id="iii.VIII-p5"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.VIII-p5.1"></span>How</span> then saith Luke, that He was lying
in the manger? Because at the birth indeed she presently laid Him there
(for, as was not unlikely, in that large assemblage for the taxing, they
could find no house; which Luke also signifies, by saying, “Because
there was no room, she laid Him” there); but afterwards she took Him up,
and held Him on her knees. For no sooner was she arrived at Bethlehem
than she brought her pangs to an end, <span
id="fr_342"></span>[343](#fn_342.md) that thou mayest thence also learn the
whole dispensation, and that these things were not done at random, or by
chance, but that they all were in course of accomplishment, according to
some Divine foreknowledge, and prophetic order.

<span id="iii.VIII-p7"></span>But what was it that induced them to
worship? For neither was the Virgin conspicuous, nor the house
distinguished, nor was any other of the things which they saw apt to
amaze or attract them. Yet they not only worship, but also “open their
treasures,” and “offer gifts;” and gifts, not as to a man, but as to
God. For the frankincense and the myrrh were a symbol of this. What then
was their inducement? That which wrought upon them to set out from home
and to come so long a journey; and this was both the star, and the
illumination wrought of God in their mind, guiding them by little and
little to the more perfect knowledge. For, surely, had it not been so,
all that was in sight being ordinary, they would not have shown so great
honor. Therefore none of the outward circumstances was great in that
instance, but it was a manger, and a shed, and a mother in poor estate;
to set before thine eyes, naked *and bare*, those wise men’s love of
wisdom, <span id="fr_343"></span>[344](#fn_343.md) and to prove to thee,
that not as mere man they approached Him, but as a God, and Benefactor.
Wherefore neither were they offended by ought of what they saw
outwardly, but even worshipped, and brought gifts; gifts not only free
from Judaical grossness, in that they sacrificed not sheep and calves,
but also coming nigh to the self-devotion of the Church, for it was
knowledge and obedience and love that they offered unto Him.

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span> <span id="iii.VIII-Page_49"></span>

<span id="iii.VIII-p9"></span>“And being warned of God in a dream that
they should not return unto Herod, they departed into their own country
another way.” <span id="fr_344"></span>[345](#fn_344.md)

<span id="iii.VIII-p11"></span>See from this also their faith, how they
were not offended, but are docile, and considerate; neither are they
troubled, nor reason with themselves, saying, “And yet, if this Child be
great, and hath any might, what need of flight, and of a clandestine
retreat? and wherefore can it be, that when we have come openly and with
boldness, and have stood against so great a people, and against a king’s
madness, the angel sends us out of the city as runaways and fugitives?”
But none of these things did they either say or think. For this most
especially belongs to faith, not to seek an account of what is enjoined,
but merely to obey the commandments laid upon us.

<span id="iii.VIII-p12"></span>2. “And when they were departed, behold,
an angel appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the
young Child and His mother, and flee into Egypt.” <span
id="fr_345"></span>[346](#fn_345.md)

<span id="iii.VIII-p14"></span>There is something here worth inquiring
into, both touching the magi, and touching the Child; for if even they
were not troubled, but received all with faith, it is worthy of
examination on our part, why they and the young Child are not preserved,
continuing there, but they as fugitives go into Persia, He with His
mother into Egypt. But what? should He have fallen into the hands of
Herod, and having fallen, not have been cut off? Nay, He would not have
been thought to have taken flesh upon Him; the greatness of the Economy
would not have been believed.

<span id="iii.VIII-p15"></span>For if, while these things are taking
place, and many circumstances are being ordered mysteriously after the
manner of men, some have dared to say that His assumption of our
flesh <span id="fr_346"></span>[347](#fn_346.md) is a fable; in what degree
of impiety would they not have been wrecked had He done all in a manner
becoming His Godhead, and according to His own power?

<span id="iii.VIII-p17"></span>As to the wise men, He sends them off
quickly, at once both commissioning them as teachers to the land of the
Persians, and at the same time intercepting the madness of the king,
that he might learn that he was attempting things impossible, and might
quench his wrath, and desist from this his vain labor. For not alone
openly to subdue His enemies, but also to deceive them with ease, is
worthy of His power. Thus, for example, He deceived the Egyptians also
in the case of the Jews, and having power to transfer their wealth
openly into the hands of the Hebrews, He bids them do this secretly and
with craft; and this surely, not less than the other miracles, made Him
an object of terror to His enemies. At least, they of Ascalon, and all
the rest, when they had taken the ark, and being smitten, did after that
devise their countrymen not to fight, nor to set themselves against Him,
with the other miracles brought this also forward, saying, “Wherefore
harden ye your hearts, as Egypt and Pharaoh hardened? when He had mocked
them, did He not after that send forth His people, and they
departed?” <span id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347.md) Now this they said,
as accounting this *fresh* one not inferior to those other signs that
had been done openly, towards the demonstration of His power, and of His
greatness. And the like ensued on this occasion too; a thing sufficient
to astonish the tyrant. For consider what it was natural for Herod to
feel, and how his very breath would be stopped, deceived as he was by
the wise men, and thus laughed to scorn. For what, if he did not become
better? It is not His fault, who marvellously ordered all this, but it
is the excess of Herod’s madness, not yielding even to those things
which had virtue <span id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348.md) to have
persuaded him, and deterred him from his wickedness, but going on still
further, to receive a yet sharper punishment for folly so great.

<span id="iii.VIII-p20"></span>3. But wherefore, it may be said, is the
young Child sent into Egypt? In the first place, the evangelist himself
hath mentioned the cause, saying, “That it might be fulfilled, Out of
Egypt have I called my Son.” And at the same time beginnings of fair
hopes were thenceforth proclaimed before to the world. That is, since
Babylon and Egypt, most in the whole earth, were burnt up with the flame
of ungodliness, He, signifying from the first that He means to correct
and amend both, and inducing men hereby to expect His bounties in regard
of the whole world likewise, sent to the one the wise men, the other He
Himself visited with His mother.

<span id="iii.VIII-p21"></span>And besides what I have said, there is
another lesson also, which we are hereby taught, tending not slightly to
true self-command in us. Of what kind then is it? To look from the
beginning for temptations and plots. See, for instance, how this was the
case even at once from His swaddling clothes. Thus you see at His birth,
first a tyrant raging, then flight ensuing, and departure beyond the
border; and for no crime His mother is exiled into the land of the
barbarians: that <span id="page_50">p. 50</span> <span
id="iii.VIII-Page_50"></span> thou, hearing these things (supposing thee
thought worthy to minister to any spiritual matter, and then to see
thyself suffering incurable ills, and enduring countless dangers),
shouldest not be greatly troubled, nor say, “What can this be? yet
surely I ought to be crowned and celebrated, and be glorious and
illustrious for fulfilling the Lord’s commandment:” but that having this
example, thou mightest bear all things nobly, knowing that this
especially is the order of all things spiritual, to have everywhere
temptations in the same lot with them. See at least how this is the case
not only with regard to the mother of the young Child, but also of those
barbarians; since they for their part retire secretly in the condition
of fugitives; and she again, who had never passed over the threshold of
her house, is commanded to undergo so long a journey of affliction, on
account of this wonderful birth, and her spiritual travail.

<span id="iii.VIII-p22"></span>And behold a wonder again. Palestine
plots, and Egypt receives and preserves Him that is the object of the
plots. For, as it appears, not only in the instance of the sons of the
patriarch <span id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349.md) did types take place,
but also in our Lord’s own case. In many instances, we are sure, His
doings at that time were prophetic declarations of what was to happen
afterwards; as, for example, in the matter of the ass and the
colt. <span id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350.md)

<span id="iii.VIII-p25"></span>4. Now the angel having thus appeared,
talks not with Mary, but with Joseph; and what saith he? “Arise, and
take the young Child and His mother.” Here, he saith not any more, “thy
wife,” but “His mother.” For after that the birth had taken place, and
the suspicion was done away, and the husband appeased, thenceforth the
angel talks openly, calling neither child nor wife his, but “take the
young Child and His mother, and flee into Egypt;” and he mentions the
cause of the flight: “For Herod,” saith he, “will seek the young Child’s
life.”

<span id="iii.VIII-p26"></span>Joseph, when he had heard these things,
was not offended, nether did he say, “The thing is hard to understand:
Didst thou not say just now, that He should save His people?’ and now He
saves not even Himself: but we must fly, and go far from home, and be a
long time away: the facts are contrary to the promise.” Nay, none of
these things doth he say (for the man was faithful): neither is he
curious about the time of his return; and this though the angel had put
it indefinitely thus: “Be thou there until I tell thee.” But
nevertheless, not even at this did he shudder, but submits and obeys,
undergoing all the trials with joy.

<span id="iii.VIII-p27"></span>And this because God, who is full of love
to man, did with these hardships mingle things pleasant also; which
indeed is His way with regard to all the saints, making neither their
dangers nor their refreshment continual, but weaving the life of all
righteous men, out of both the one and the other. This very thing He did
here also: for consider, Joseph saw the Virgin with child; this cast him
into agitation and the utmost trouble, for he was suspecting the damsel
of adultery. But straightway the angel was at hand to do away his
suspicion, and remove his fears; and seeing the young child born, he
reaped the greatest joy. Again, this joy no trifling danger succeeds,
the city being troubled, and the king in his madness seeking after Him
that was born. But this trouble was again succeeded by another joy; the
star, and the adoration of the wise men. Again, after this pleasure,
fear and danger; “For Herod,” saith he, “is seeking the young Child’s
life,” and He must needs fly and withdraw Himself as any mortal might:
the working of miracles not being seasonable as yet. For if from His
earliest infancy He had shown forth wonders, He would not have been
accounted a Man.

<span id="iii.VIII-p28"></span>Because of this, let me add, neither is a
temple framed at once; but a regular conception takes place, and a time
of nine months, and pangs, and a delivery, and giving suck, and silence
for so long a space, and He awaits the age proper to manhood; that by
all means acceptance might be won for the mystery of His Economy.

<span id="iii.VIII-p29"></span>“But wherefore then,” one may say, “were
even these signs wrought at the beginning?” For His mother’s sake; for
the sake of Joseph and of Simeon, who was presently to depart; for the
sake of the shepherds and of the wise men; for the sake of the Jews.
Since they, had they been willing to mind diligently what was taking
place, would from this event also have reaped no small advantage in
regard of what was to come.

<span id="iii.VIII-p30"></span>But if the prophets do not mention what
<span id="page_51">p. 51</span> <span id="iii.VIII-Page_51"></span>
relates to the wise men, be not troubled; for they neither foretold all
things, nor were they silent touching all. For as without any warning to
see those things coming to pass, would naturally occasion much
astonishment and trouble; so also to have been informed of all would
dispose the hearer to sleep, and would have left nothing for the
evangelists to add.

<span id="iii.VIII-p31"></span>5. And if the Jews should raise a
question touching the prophecy, and say, that the words, “Out of Egypt
have I called my Son,” were uttered concerning themselves; we would tell
them, This is a law of prophecy, that in many cases much that is spoken
of one set of persons is fulfilled in another; of which kind is that
which is said touching Simeon and Levi, “I will divide them,” saith He,
“in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.” <span
id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351.md) And yet not in themselves did this
come to pass, but in their descendants; and Noah’s saying again about
Canaan, came to pass in the Gibeonites, Canaan’s descendants. <span
id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352.md) And that concerning Jacob one may see
to have so come to pass; for those blessings which say, “Be lord over
thy brother, and let thy father’s sons worship thee,” <span
id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353.md) had no accomplishment in himself (how
could they, he being in fear and trembling, and worshipping his brother
over and over again? <span id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354) .md), but in
his offspring they had. The very same may be said in this case also. For
which may be called the truer son of God, he that worships a calf, and
is joined to Baalpeor <span id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355.md) and
sacrifices his sons to devils? or He that is a Son by nature, and honors
Him that begat Him? So that, except this man had come, the prophecy
would not have received, its due fulfillment. It is worth observing,
too, that the evangelist intimates the same by the phrase, “that it
might be fulfilled;” implying that it would not have been fulfilled,
unless He had come.

<span id="iii.VIII-p37"></span>And this makes the Virgin also in no
common degree glorious and distinguished; that the very thing which was
the whole people’s special endowment in the way of praise, she also
might thenceforth have for her own. I mean, that whereas they were proud
of their coming up from Egypt, and used to boast of it (which indeed the
prophet also was hinting at, when he said, “Have I not brought up the
strangers from Cappadocia, and the Assyrians from the pit” <span
id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356) .md), He makes this pre-eminence belong
to the Virgin likewise.

<span id="iii.VIII-p39"></span>Rather, however, both the people and the
patriarch, going down thither, and coming up thence, were together
completing the type of this *His* return. Thus, as they went down to
avoid death by famine, so He death by conspiracy. But whereas they on
their arrival were for the time delivered from the famine, this man,
when He had gone down, sanctified the whole land, by setting His foot
thereon.

<span id="iii.VIII-p40"></span>At least it is observable how, in the
midst of His humiliations, the tokens of His Godhead are disclosed.
Thus, first of all, the angel saying, “Flee into Egypt,” did not promise
to journey with them, either in their descent or return; intimating that
they have a great fellow-traveller, the Child that had been born; such
an one as actually changed all things immediately on His appearing, and
wrought so that His enemies should minister in many ways to this
Economy. Thus magi and barbarians, leaving the superstition of their
fathers, are come to worship: thus Augustus ministers to the birth at
Bethlehem by the decree for the taxing; Egypt receives and preserves
Him, driven from His home, and plotted against, and obtains a sort of
first impulse towards her union unto Him; so that when in after-time she
should hear Him preached by the apostles, she might have this at least
to glory of, as having received Him first. And yet this privilege did
belong unto Palestine alone; but the second proved more fervent than the
first.

<span id="iii.VIII-p41"></span>6. And now, shouldest thou come unto the
desert of Egypt, thou wilt see this desert become better than any
paradise, and ten thousand choirs of angels in human forms, and nations
of martyrs, and companies of virgins, and all the devil’s tyranny put
down, while Christ’s kingdom shines forth in its brightness. And the
mother of poets, and wise men, and magicians, <span
id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357.md) were but inventions of sottish old
women, but the real philosophy, and worthy of heaven, is this, which was
declared unto them by the fishermen. And for this very cause, together
with their so great exactness in doctrine, they exhibit also by their
life that extreme seriousness. For when they have stripped themselves of
all that they have, and are crucified to the whole world, they urge
their course on again yet farther, using the labor of their body for the
nourishment of them that be in need. For neither, because they fast and
watch, do they think it meet to be idle by day; but their nights they
spend in the holy hymns and in vigils, and their days in prayers, and at
the same time in laboring with their own hands imitating the zeal of the
apostle. <span id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358.md) For if he when the
whole world was looking unto him for the sake of nourishing them that
were in need, both occupied a workshop, and practised a craft, and being
thus employed did not so much as sleep by night; how much more, say
they, is it meet that we, who have taken up our abode in the wilderness,
and have nothing to do with the turmoils in the cities, should use the
leisure of our quiet for spiritual labors!

<span id="iii.VIII-p44"></span>Let us then be ashamed all of us, both
they that are rich, and they that are poor, when those having nothing at
all but a body only and hands, force their way on and strive eagerly to
find thence a supply for the poor; while we, having endless stores
within, touch not even our superfluities for these objects. What kind of
plea shall we have then, I pray thee? and what sort of excuse?

<span id="iii.VIII-p45"></span>Yet further consider, how of old these
Egyptians were both avaricious, and gluttonous, together with their
other vices. For there were the flesh-pots <span
id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359.md) which the Jews remember; there, the
great tyranny of the belly. Nevertheless, having a willing mind, they
changed: and having caught fire from Christ, they set off at once on
their voyage towards heaven; and though more ardent than the rest of
mankind, and more headstrong, both in anger, and in bodily pleasures,
they imitate the incorporeal powers in meekness, and in the rest of that
freedom from passions which pertains unto self-denial.

<span id="iii.VIII-p47"></span>7. Now if any man hath been in the
country, he knows what I say. But if he have never entered those
tabernacles, let him call to mind him who even until now is in the
mouths of all men,—him whom, after the apostles, Egypt brought
forth,—the blessed and great Antony; and let him put it to himself,
“This man, too, was born in the same country with Pharaoh; nevertheless
he was not thereby damaged, but both had a divine vision vouchsafed him,
and showed forth such a life as the laws of Christ require.” And this
any man shall know perfectly, when he hath read the book that contains
the history of that man’s life; <span id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360.md)
in which also he will perceive much prophecy. I allude to his prediction
about those infected with the errors of Arius, and his statement of the
mischief that would arise from them; God even then having shown them to
him, and sketched out before his eyes all that was coming. A thing which
most especially (among the rest) serves to demonstrate the truth, that
no person, belonging to the heresies without, hath such a man to
mention. But, not to depend on us for this information, look earnestly
into what is written in that book, and ye will learn all exactly, and
thence be instructed in much self-denial.

<span id="iii.VIII-p49"></span>And this advice I give, that we not
merely peruse what is written there, but that we also emulate it, and
make neither place, nor education, nor forefathers’ wickedness an
excuse. <span id="page_52">p. 52</span> <span
id="iii.VIII-Page_52"></span> For if we will take heed to ourselves,
none of these things shall be an hindrance to us, since even Abraham had
an ungodly father, <span id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361.md) but he
inherited not his wickedness; and Hezekiah, Ahaz: yet nevertheless he
became dear to God. And Joseph too when in the midst of Egypt, adorned
himself with the crowns of temperance; and the Three Children no less in
the midst of Babylon, and of the palace, when a table like those at
Sybaris was set before them, showed the highest self-denial; and Moses
also in Egypt, and Paul in the whole world; but nothing was to any one
of these an hindrance in the race of virtue.

<span id="iii.VIII-p51"></span>Let us then, bearing in mind all these
things, put out of the way these our superfluous pleas and excuses, and
apply ourselves to those toils which the cause of virtue requires. For
thus shall we both attract to ourselves more favor from God, and
persuade Him to assist us in our struggles, and we shall obtain the
eternal blessings; unto which God grant that we may all attain, by the
grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory
and victory for ever and ever. Amen.

<span id="iii.VIII-p24"></span>The received mystical interpretation of
our Lord’s final entry into Jerusalem represented the ass as the type of
the Jewish converts, and the colt, of the Gentile Church. See hereafter,
Hom. LXVI., and comp. Origen on St. Matt. t. 16, 15; St. Amb. in Luc.
lib. 9, 4–14; St. Just. Mart. Dial. cum. Tryph. c. 53. The
interpretation to which St. Chrysostom points of the flight into Egypt,
is probably the same with that of St. Hilary on this place. “Joseph is
admonished by the angel to take the young child into Egypt: Egypt full
of idols, and given to the worship of all kinds of portents for gods.
Accordingly, after the persecution by the Jews, and the assent of that
profane multitude to His murder, Christ passes over to the nations, sold
as they were to the vainest superstitions. He leaves Jewry, and is
carried into the world which knows Him not: while Bethlehem, *i.e*.,
Judæa, overflows with the blood of martyrs. As to Herod’s rage and his
murdering the infants, it is the type of the Jewish people raging
against the Christians, under the notion that by the slaughter of the
blessed martyrs they may blot out Christ’s name from the faith and
profession of all men.” p.613, ed. Ben. Paris, 1693.
