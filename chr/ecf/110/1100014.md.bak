<span id="VI_1-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="VI_1-p2.1"></span>[Matt. 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002.md)<span id="VI_1-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="VI_1-p3"></span>“When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judæa in
the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to
Jerusalem, saying, Where is He that is born King of the Jews? for we
have seen His star in the east, and are come to worship Him.”

<span id="VI_1-p4"></span>We have need of much wakefulness, and many
prayers, that we may arrive at the interpretation of the passage now
before us, and that we may learn who these wise men were, and whence
they came, and how; and at whose persuasion, and what was the star. Or
rather, if ye will, let us first bring forward what the enemies of the
truth say. Because the devil hath blown upon them with so violent a
blast, as even from this passage try to arm them against the words of
truth.

<span id="VI_1-p5"></span>What then do they allege? “Behold,” say they,
“even when Christ was born a star appeared; which is a sign that
astrology may be depended on.” How then, if He had His birth according
to that law, did He put down astrology, and take away fate, and stop the
mouths of demons, and cast out error, and overthrow all such sorcery?

<span id="VI_1-p6"></span>And what moreover do the wise men learn from
the star of itself? That He was King of the Jews? And yet He was not
king of this kingdom; even as He said also to Pilate, “My kingdom is not
of this world.” At any rate He made no display of this kind, for He had
neither guards armed with spear or shield, nor horses, nor chariots of
mules, nor any other such thing around Him; but He followed this life of
meanness and poverty, carrying about with Him twelve men of mean estate.

<span id="VI_1-p7"></span>And even if they knew Him to be a king, for
what intent are they come? For surely this is not the business of
astrology, to know from the stars who are born, but from the hour when
men are born to predict what shall befall them: so it is said. But these
were neither present with the mother in her pangs, nor did they know the
time when He was born, neither did they, beginning at that moment, from
the motion of the stars compute what was to happen: but conversely,
having a long time before seen a star appear in their own country, they
come to see Him that was born.

<span id="VI_1-p8"></span>Which circumstance in itself would afford a
still greater difficulty even than the former. For what reason induced
them, or the hope of what benefits, to worship one who was king so far
off? Why, had He been to reign over themselves, most assuredly not even
so would the circumstance be capable of a reasonable account. To be
sure, if He had been born in royal courts, and with His father, himself
a king, present by Him, any one would naturally say, that they, from a
wish to pay court to the father, had worshipped the child that was born,
and in this way were laying up for themselves beforehand much ground of
patronage. But now when they did not so much as expect Him to be their
own king, but of a strange nation, far distant from their country,
neither seeing Him as yet grown to manhood; wherefore do they set forth
on so long a journey, and offer gifts, and this when dangers were sure
to <span id="page_35">p. 35</span> <span id="VI_1-Page_35"></span> beset
their whole proceeding? For both Herod, when he heard it, was
exceedingly troubled, and the whole people was confounded on being told
of these things by them.

<span id="VI_1-p9"></span>“But these men did not foresee this.” Nay,
this is not reasonable. For let them have been ever so foolish, of this
they could not be ignorant, that when they came to a city under a king,
and proclaimed such things as these, and set forth another king besides
him who then reigned, they must needs be bringing down on themselves a
thousand deaths.

<span id="VI_1-p10"></span>2. And why did they at all worship one who
was in swaddling clothes? For if He had been a grown man, one might say,
that in expectation of the succor they should receive from Him, they
cast themselves into a danger which they foresaw; a thing however to the
utmost degree unreasonable, that the Persian, the barbarian, and one
that had nothing in common with the nation of the Jews, should be
willing to depart from his home, to give up country, and kindred, and
friends, and that they should subject themselves to another kingdom.

<span id="VI_1-p11"></span>But if this be foolish, what follows is much
more foolish. Of what nature then is this? That after they had entered
on so long a journey, and worshipped, and thrown all into confusion,
they went away immediately. And what sign at all of royalty did they
behold, when they saw a shed, and a manger, and a child in swaddling
clothes, and a poor mother? And to whom moreover did they offer their
gifts, and for what intent? Was it then usual and customary, thus to pay
court to the kings that were born in every place? and did they always
keep going about the whole world, worshipping them who they knew should
become kings out of a low and mean estate, before they ascended the
royal throne? Nay, this no one can say.

<span id="VI_1-p12"></span>And for what purpose did they worship Him at
all? If for the sake of things present, then what did they expect to
receive from an infant, and a mother of mean condition? If for things
future, then whence did they know that the child whom they had
worshipped in swaddling clothes would remember what was then done? But
if His mother was to remind Him, not even so were they worthy of honor,
but of punishment, as bringing Him into danger which they must have
foreseen. Thence at any rate it was that Herod was troubled, and sought,
and pried, and took in hand to slay Him. And indeed everywhere, he who
makes known the future king, supposing him in his earliest age in a
private condition, doth nothing else than betray him to slaughter, and
kindle against him endless warfare.

<span id="VI_1-p13"></span>Seest thou how manifold the absurdities
appear, if we examine these transactions according to the course of
human things and ordinary custom? For not these topics only, but more
than these might be mentioned, containing more matter for questions than
what we have spoken of. But lest, stringing questions upon questions, we
should bewilder you, come let us now enter upon the solution of the
matters inquired of, making a beginning of our solution with the star
itself.

<span id="VI_1-p14"></span>3. For if ye can learn what the star was, and
of what kind, and whether it were one of the common stars, or new and
unlike the rest, and whether it was a star by nature or a star in
appearance only, we shall easily know the other things also. Whence then
will these points be manifest? From the very things that are written.
Thus, that this star was not of the common sort, or rather not a star at
all, as it seems at least to me, but some invisible power transformed
into this appearance, is in the first place evident from its very
course. For there is not, there is not any star that moves by this way,
but whether it be the sun you mention, or the moon, or all the other
stars, we see them going from east to west; but this was wafted from
north to south; for so is Palestine situated with respect to Persia.

<span id="VI_1-p15"></span>In the second place, one may see this from
the time also. For it appears not in the night, but in mid-day, while
the sun is shining; and this is not within the power of a star, nay not
of the moon; for the moon that so much surpasses all, when the beams of
the sun appear, straightway hides herself, and vanishes away. But this
by the excess of its own splendor overcame even the beams of the sun,
appearing brighter than they, and in so much light shining out more
illustriously.

<span id="VI_1-p16"></span>In the third place, from its appearing, and
hiding itself again. For on their way as far as Palestine it appeared
leading them, but after they set foot within Jerusalem, it hid itself:
then again, when they had left Herod, having told him on what account
they came, and were on the point of departing, it shows itself; all
which is not like the motion of a star, but of some power highly endued
with reason. For it had not even any course at all of its own, but when
they were to move, it moved; when to stand, it stood, dispensing <span
id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md) all as need required: in the same kind
of way as the pillar of the cloud, now halting <span id="page_36">p.
36</span> <span id="VI_1-Page_36"></span> and now rousing up the camp of
the Jews, when it was needful.

<span id="VI_1-p18"></span>In the fourth place, one may perceive this
clearly, from its mode of pointing Him out. For it did not, remaining on
high, point out the place; it not being possible for them so to
ascertain it, but it came down and performed this office. For ye know
that a spot of so small dimensions, being only as much as a shed would
occupy, or rather as much as the body of a little infant would take up,
could not possibly be marked out by a star. For by reason of its immense
height, it could not sufficiently distinguish so confined a spot, and
discover it to them that were desiring to see it. And this any one may
see by the moon, which being so far superior to the stars, seems to all
that dwell in the world, and are scattered over so great an extent of
earth,—seems, I say, near to them every one. How then, tell me, did the
star point out a spot so confined, just the space of a manger and shed,
unless it left that height and came down, and stood over the very head
of the young child? And at this the evangelist was hinting when he said,
“Lo, the star went before them, till it came and stood over where the
young Child was.”

<span id="VI_1-p19"></span>4. Seest thou, by what store of proofs this
star is shown not to be one of the many, nor to have shown itself
according to the order of the outward creation? And for what intent did
it appear? To reprove the Jews for their insensibility, and to cut off
from them all occasion of excuse for their willful ignorance. For, since
He who came was to put an end to the ancient polity, and to call the
world to the worship of Himself, and to be worshipped in all land and
sea, straightway, from the beginning, He opens the door to the Gentiles,
willing through strangers to admonish His own people. Thus, because the
prophets were continually heard speaking of His advent, and they gave no
great heed, He made even barbarians come from a far country, to seek
after the king that was among them. And they learn from a Persian tongue
first of all, what they would not submit to learn from the prophets;
that, if on the one hand they were disposed to be candid, they might
have the strongest motive for obedience; if, on the other hand, they
were contentious, they might henceforth be deprived of all excuse. For
what could they have to say, who did not receive Christ after so many
prophets, when they saw that wise men, at the sight of a single star,
had received this same, and had worshipped Him who was made manifest.
Much in the same way then as He acted in the case of the Ninevites, when
He sent Jonas, and as in the case of the Samaritan and the Canaanitish
women; so He did likewise in the instance of the magi. For this cause He
also said, “The men of Nineveh shall rise up, and shall condemn:” and,
“the Queen of the South shall rise up, and shall condemn this
generation:” <span id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md) because these
believed the lesser things, but the Jews not even the greater.

<span id="VI_1-p21"></span>“And wherefore,” one may say, “did He attract
them by such a vision?” Why, how should He have done? Sent prophets? But
the magi would not have submitted to prophets. Uttered a voice from
above? Nay, they would not have attended. Sent an angel? But even him
they would have hurried by. And so for this cause dismissing all those
means, God calleth them by the things that are familiar, in exceeding
condescension; and He shows a large and extraordinary star, so as to
astonish them, both at the greatness and beauty of its appearance, and
the manner of its course.

<span id="VI_1-p22"></span>In imitation of this, Paul also reasons with
the Greeks from an heathen altar, and brings forward testimonies from
the poets. <span id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) And not without
circumcision doth he harangue the Jews. Sacrifices he makes the
beginning of his instruction to them that are living under the law. For,
since to every one what is familiar is dear, both God, and the men that
are sent by Him, manage things on this principle with a view to the
salvation of the world. Think it not therefore unworthy of Him to have
called them by a star; since by the same rule thou wilt find fault with
all the Jewish rites also, the sacrifices, and the purifications, and
the new moons, and the ark, and the temple too itself. For even these
derived their origin from Gentile grossness. <span
id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) Yet for all that, God, for the
salvation of them that were in error, endured to be served by these
things, whereby those without were used to serve devils; only He
slightly altered them; that He might draw them off by degrees from their
customs, and lead them towards the highest wisdom. Just so He did in the
case of the wise men also, not disdaining to call them by sight of a
star, that He might lift them higher ever after. Therefore after He hath
brought them, leading them by the hand, and hath set them by the manger;
it is no longer by a star, but by an angel that He now discourses unto
them. Thus did they by little and little become better men.

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span> <span id="VI_1-Page_37"></span>

<span id="VI_1-p25"></span>This did He also with respect to them of
Ascalon, and of Gaza. For those five cities too (when at the coming of
the ark they had been smitten with a deadly plague, and found no
deliverance from the ills under which they lay)—the men of them called
their prophets, and gathered an assembly, and sought to discover an
escape from this divine scourge. Then, when their prophets said that
they should yoke to the ark heifers untamed, and having their first
calves, and let them go their way, with no man to guide them, for so it
would be evident whether the plague was from God or whether it was any
accident which brought the disease;—(“for if,” it is said, “they break
the yoke in pieces for want of practice, or turn where their calves are
lowing, ‘it is a chance that hath happened;’ <span
id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269.md) but if they go on right, and err not
from the way, and neither the lowing of their young, nor their ignorance
of the way, have any effect on them, it is quite plain that it is the
hand of God that hath visited those cities:”)—when, I say, on these
words of their prophets the inhabitants of those cities obeyed and did
as they were commanded, God also followed up the counsel of the
prophets, showing condescension in that instance also, and counted it
not unworthy of Himself to bring to effect the prediction of the
prophets, and to make them seem trustworthy in what they had then said.
For so the good achieved was greater, in that His very enemies
themselves bore witness to the power of God; yea, their own teachers
gave their voice concerning Him. And one may see many other such things
brought about by God. For what took place with respect to the
witch, <span id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270.md) is again like this sort
of dispensation; which circumstance also you will now be able to explain
from what hath been said.

<span id="VI_1-p28"></span>With respect to the star, we have said these
things, and yet more perhaps may be said by you; for, it is said, “Give
occasion to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser:” <span
id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271.md) but we must now come to the beginning
of what hath been read.

<span id="VI_1-p30"></span>5. And what is the beginning? “When Jesus was
born in Bethlehem of Judæa, in the days of Herod the king, behold, there
came wise men from the east to Jerusalem.” While wise men followed under
the auspices of a star, these believed not, with prophets even sounding
in their ears. But wherefore doth he mention to us both the time and the
place, saying, “in Bethlehem,” and “in the days of Herod the king?” And
for what reason doth he add his rank also? His rank, because there was
also another Herod, he who slew John: but that was a tetrarch, this a
king. And the place likewise, and the time, he puts down, to bring to
our remembrance ancient prophecies; whereof one was uttered by Micah,
saying, “And thou, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, art by no means the
least among the princes of Judah;” <span
id="fr_272"></span>[273](#fn_272.md) and the other by the patriarch Jacob,
distinctly marking out to us the time, and setting forth the great sign
of His coming. For, “A ruler,” saith he, “shall not fail out of Judah,
nor a leader out of his loins, until He come for whom it is appointed,
and He is the expectation of the Gentiles.” <span
id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273.md)

<span id="VI_1-p33"></span>And this again is worth inquiry, whence it
was that they came to entertain such a thought, and who it was that
stirred them up to this. For it doth not seem to me to be the work of
the star only, but also of God, who moved their soul; which same kind of
thing He did also in the case of Cyrus, disposing him to let the Jews
go. He did not however so do this as to destroy their free will, since
even when He called Paul from above by a voice, He manifested both His
own grace and Paul’s obedience.

<span id="VI_1-p34"></span>And wherefore, one may ask, did He not reveal
this to all the wise men of the East? Because all would not have
believed, but these were better prepared than the rest; since also there
were countless nations that perished, but it was to the Ninevites only
that the prophet was sent; and there were two thieves on the cross, but
one only was saved. See at least the virtue of these men, not only by
their coming, but also by their boldness of speech. For so that they may
not seem to be a sort of impostors, <span
id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274.md) they tell who showed them the way, and
the length of their journey; and being come, they had boldness of
speech: “for we are come,” that is their statement, “to worship Him:”
and they were afraid neither of the people’s anger, nor of the tyranny
of the king. Whence to me at least they seem to have been at home also
teachers of their countrymen. <span id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md)
For they who here did not shrink from saying this, much more would they
speak boldly in their own country, as having received both the oracle
from the angel, and the testimony from the prophet.

<span id="VI_1-p37"></span>6. But “when Herod,” saith the Scripture,
“had heard, he was troubled, and all Jerusa <span id="page_38">p.
38</span> <span id="VI_1-Page_38"></span> lem with him.” Herod
naturally, as being king, and afraid both for himself and for his
children; but why Jerusalem? Surely the prophets had foretold Him a
Saviour, and Benefactor, and a Deliverer from above. Wherefore then was
Jerusalem <span id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md) troubled? From the
same feeling which caused them before also to turn away from God when
pouring His benefits on them, and to be mindful of the flesh-pots of
Egypt, while in the enjoyment of great freedom.

<span id="VI_1-p39"></span>But mark, I pray thee, the accuracy of the
prophets. For this selfsame thing also had the prophet foretold from the
first, <span id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md) saying, “They would be
glad, if they had been burnt with fire; for unto us a Child is born,
unto us a Son is given.” <span id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md)

<span id="VI_1-p42"></span>But nevertheless, although troubled, they
seek not to see what hath happened, neither do they follow the wise men,
nor make any particular inquiry; to such a degree were they at once both
contentious and careless above all men. For when they had reason rather
to pride themselves that the king was born amongst them, and had
attracted to Him the land of the Persians, and they were on the point of
having all subject to them, as though their affairs had advanced towards
improvement, and from the very outset His empire had become so glorious;
nevertheless, they do not even for this become better. And yet they were
but just delivered from their captivity there; and it was natural for
them to think (even if they knew none of those things that are high and
mysterious, but formed their judgment from what is present only), “If
they thus tremble before our king at His birth, much more when grown up
will they fear and obey Him, and our estate will be more glorious than
that of the barbarians.”

<span id="VI_1-p43"></span>7. But none of these things thoroughly
awakens them, so great was their dullness, and with this their envy
also: both which we must with exact care root out of our mind; and he
must be more fervent than fire who is to stand in such an array.
Wherefore also Christ said, “I am come to send fire on earth, and I
would it were already kindled.” <span id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md)
in the same lot with it, even so godly tears are a germ of perpetual and
unfading joy. In this way the very harlot became more honorable than
virgins when seized by this fire. That is, being thoroughly warmed by
repentance, she was thenceforth carried out <span id="page_39">p.
39</span> <span id="VI_1-Page_39"></span> of herself by her longing
desire toward Christ; loosing her hair, and drenching with her tears His
holy feet, and wiping them with her own tresses, and exhausting the
ointment. <span id="fr_280"></span>[281](#fn_280.md) And all these were
outward results, but those wrought in her mind were far more fervent
than these; which things God Himself alone beheld. And therefore, every
one, when he hears, rejoices with her and takes delight in her good
works, and acquits her of every blame. But if we that are evil pass this
judgment, consider what sentence she obtained from that God who is a
lover of mankind; and how much, even before God’s gifts, her repentance
caused her to reap in the way of blessing.

<span id="VI_1-p46"></span>For much as after a violent burst of rain,
there is a clear open sky; so likewise when tears are pouring down, a
calm arises, and serenity, and the darkness that ensues on our sins
quite disappears. And like as by water and the spirit, so by tears and
confession are we cleansed the second time; unless we be acting thus for
display and vanity: for as to a woman whose tears were of that sort, I
should call her justly condemnable, more than if she decked herself out
with <span id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md) lines and coloring. For I
seek those tears which are shed not for display, but in compunction;
those which trickle down secretly and in closets, and in sight of no
man, softly and noiselessly; those which arise from a certain depth of
mind, those shed in anguish and in sorrow, those which are for God
alone; such as were Hannah’s, for “her lips moved,” it is said, “but her
voice was not heard;” <span id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md) however,
her tears alone uttered a cry more clear than any trumpet. And because
of this, God also opened her womb, and made the hard rock a fruitful
field.

<span id="VI_1-p49"></span>If thou also weep thus, thou art become a
follower of thy Lord. Yea, for He also wept, both over Lazarus, and over
the city; and touching Judas He was greatly troubled. And this indeed
one may often see Him do, but nowhere laugh, nay, nor smile but a
little; no one at least of the evangelists hath mentioned this.
Therefore also with regard to Paul, that he wept, that he did so three
years night and day, <span id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283.md) both he
hath said of himself, and others say this of him; but that he laughed,
neither hath he said himself anywhere, neither hath so much as one other
of the saints, either concerning him, or any other like him; but this is
said of Sarah only, <span id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284.md) when she is
blamed, and of the son of Noe, when for a freeman he became a
slave. <span id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285.md)

<span id="VI_1-p53"></span>9. And these things I say, not to
suppress <span id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286.md) all laughter, but to
take away dissipation of mind. For wherefore, I pray thee, art thou
luxurious and dissolute, while thou art still liable to such heavy
charges, and are to stand at a fearful judgment-seat, and to give a
strict account of all that hath been done here? Yes: for we are to give
an account both of what we have sinned willingly, and what against our
will:—for “whosoever shall deny me,” saith He, “before men, him will I
also deny before my Father:” <span id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287.md)
—and surely such a denial is against our will; but nevertheless it doth
not escape punishment, but of it too we have to give account:—both of
what we know, and of what we do not know; “For I know nothing by
myself,” saith one, “yet am I not hereby justified:” <span
id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288.md) —both for what we have done in
ignorance, and what in knowledge; “For I bear them record,” it is said,
“that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge;” <span
id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289.md) but yet this doth not suffice for an
excuse for them. And when writing to the Corinthians also he saith, “For
I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his
subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is
in Christ.” <span id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290.md)

<span id="VI_1-p59"></span>The things then being so great, for which
thou art to give account, dost thou sit laughing and talking wittily,
and giving thyself up to luxury? “Why,” one may say, “if I did not so,
but mourned, what would be the profit?” Very great indeed; even so
great, as it is not possible so much as to set it forth by word. For
while, before the temporal tribunals, be thy weeping ever so abundant,
thou canst not escape punishment after the sentence; here, on the
contrary, shouldest thou only sigh, thou hast annulled the sentence, and
hast obtained pardon. Therefore it is that Christ discourses to us much
of mourning, and blesses them that mourn, and pronounces them that laugh
wretched. For this is not the theatre for laughter, neither did we come
together for this intent, that we may give way to immoderate mirth, but
that we may groan, and by this groaning inherit a kingdom. But thou,
when standing by a <span id="page_40">p. 40</span> <span
id="VI_1-Page_40"></span> king, dost not endure so much as merely to
smile; having then the Lord of the angels dwelling in thee, dost thou
not stand with trembling, and all due self-restraint, but rather
laughest, oftentimes when He is displeased? And dost thou not consider
that thou provokest Him in this way more than by thy sins? For God is
not wont to turn Himself away so much from them that sin, as from those
that are not awestruck after their sin.

<span id="VI_1-p60"></span>But for all this, some are of so senseless a
disposition, as even after these words to say, “Nay, far be it from me
to weep at any time, but may God grant me to laugh and to play all my
days.” And what can be more childish than this mind? For it is not God
that grants to play, but the devil. At least hear, what was the portion
of them that played. “The people,” it is said, “sat down to eat and
drink, and rose up to play.” <span id="fr_291"></span>[292](#fn_291.md)
Such were they at Sodom, such were they at the time of the deluge. For
touching them of Sodom likewise it is said, that “in pride, and in
plenty, and in fullness of bread, they waxed wanton.” <span
id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292.md) And they who were in Noah’s time,
seeing the ark a preparing for so many years, lived on in senseless
mirth, forseeing nought of what was coming. For this cause also the
flood came and swept them all away, and wrought in that instant the
common shipwreck of the world.

<span id="VI_1-p63"></span>Ask not then of God these things, which thou
receivest of the devil. For it is God’s part to give a contrite and
humbled heart, sober, self-possessed, and awestruck, full of repentance
and compunction. These are His gifts, forasmuch as it is also of these
things that we are most in need. Yes, for a grievous conflict is at
hand, and against the powers unseen is our wrestling; against “the
spiritual wickednesses” <span id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293.md) our
fight, “against principalities, against powers” our warfare: and it is
well for us, if when we are earnest and sober and thoroughly awakened,
we can be able to sustain that savage phalanx. But if we are laughing
and sporting, and always taking things easily, even before the conflict,
we shall be overthrown by our own remissness.

<span id="VI_1-p65"></span>10. It becometh not us then to be continually
laughing, and to be dissolute, and luxurious, but it belongs to those
upon the stage, the harlot women, the men that are trimmed for this
intent, parasites, and flatterers; not them that are called unto heaven,
not them that are enrolled into the city above, not them that bear
spiritual arms, but them that are enlisted on the devil’s side. For it
is he, yea, it is he, that even made the thing an art, that he might
weaken Christ’s soldiers, and soften the nerves of their zeal. For this
cause he also built theatres in the cities, and having trained those
buffoons, by their pernicious influence he causes that kind of
pestilence to light upon the whole city, persuading men to follow those
things which Paul bade us flee, “foolish talking and jesting.” <span
id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294.md) And what is yet more grievous than
these things is the subject of the laughter. For when they that act
those absurd things utter any word of blasphemy or filthiness, then many
among the more thoughtless laugh and are pleased, applauding in them
what they ought to stone them for; and drawing down on their own heads
by this amusement the furnace of fire. For they who praise the utterers
of such words, it is these above all who induce men so to speak:
wherefore they must be more justly accountable for the penalty allotted
to these things. For were there no one to be a spectator in such cases,
neither would there be one to act; but when they see you forsaking your
workshops, and your crafts, and your income from these, and in short
everything, for the sake of continuing there, they derive hence a
greater forwardness, and exert a greater diligence about these things.

<span id="VI_1-p67"></span>And this I say, not freeing them from
reproof, but that ye may learn that it is you chiefly who supply the
principle and root of such lawlessness; ye who consume your whole day on
these matters, and profanely exhibit the sacred things of marriage, and
make an open mock of the great mystery. For not even he who acts these
things is so much the offender, as thou art before him; thou who biddest
him make a play on these things, or rather who not only biddest him, but
art even zealous about it, taking delight, and laughing, and praising
what is done, and in every way gaining strength for such workshops of
the devil.

<span id="VI_1-p68"></span>Tell me then, with what eyes wilt thou after
this look upon thy wife at home, having seen her insulted there? Or how
dost thou not blush being put in mind of the partner of thy home, when
thou seest nature herself put to an open shame? Nay, tell me not, that
what is done is acting; for this acting hath made many adulterers, and
subverted many families. And it is for this most especially that I
grieve, that what is done doth not so much as seem evil, but there is
even applause and clamor, and much laughter, at <span id="page_41">p.
41</span> <span id="VI_1-Page_41"></span> commission of so foul
adultery. What sayest thou? that what is done is acting? Why, for this
selfsame reason they must be worthy of ten thousand deaths, that what
things all laws command men to flee, they have taken pains to imitate.
For if the thing itself be bad, the imitation thereof also is bad. And I
do not yet say how many adulterers they make who act these scenes of
adultery, how they render the spectators of such things bold and
shameless; for nothing is more full of whoredom and boldness than an eye
that endures to look at such things.

<span id="VI_1-p69"></span>And thou in a market-place wouldest not
choose to see a woman stripped naked, or rather not even in a house, but
callest such a thing an outrage. And goest thou up into the theatre, to
insult the common nature of men and women, and disgrace thine own eyes?
For say not this, that she that is stripped is an harlot; but that the
nature is the same, and they are bodies alike, both that of the harlot,
and that of the free-woman. For if this be nothing amiss, what is the
cause that if thou were to see this done in a market place, thou
wouldest both hasten away thyself, and drive thence her who was behaving
herself unseemly? Or is it that when we are apart, then such a thing is
outrageous, but when we are assembled and all sitting together, it is no
longer equally shameful? Nay, this is absurdity and a disgrace, and
words of the utmost madness; and it were better to besmear the eyes all
over with mud and mire than to be a spectator of such a transgression.
For surely mire is not so much an hurt to an eye, as an unchaste sight,
and the spectacle of a woman stripped naked. Hear, for example, what it
was that caused nakedness at the beginning, and read the occasion of
such disgrace. What then did cause nakedness? Our disobedience, <span
id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295.md) and the devil’s counsel. Thus, from
the first, even from the very beginning, this was his contrivance. Yet
they were at least ashamed when they were naked, but ye take a pride in
it; “having,” according to that saying of the apostle, “your glory in
your shame.” <span id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md)

<span id="VI_1-p72"></span>How then will thy wife thenceforward look
upon thee, when thou art returned from such wickedness? how receive
thee? how speak to thee, after thou hast so publicly put to shame the
common nature of woman, and art made by such a sight the harlots’
captive and slave? <span id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md)

<span id="VI_1-p74"></span>Now if ye grieve at hearing these things, I
thank you much, for “who is he that maketh me glad, but he which is made
sorry by me?” <span id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) Do not then ever
cease to grieve and be vexed for them, for the sorrow that comes of such
things will be to you a beginning of a change for the better. For this
cause I also have made my language the stronger, that by cutting deeper
I might free you from the venom of them that intoxicate you; that I
might bring you back to a pure health of soul; which God grant we may
all enjoy by all means, and attain unto the rewards laid up for these
good deeds; by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to whom be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.

their return, they continued serving God more than before, and
instructed many by their preaching. And at last, when Thomas had gone
into that province, they joined themselves to him and were baptized, and
became doers of his word.” This work has been attributed to St.
Chrysostom, and seems certainly of the same date with him.
