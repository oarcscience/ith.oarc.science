<span id="iii.XI-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iii.XI-p1.1"></span>Homily XI.</span>

<span id="iii.XI-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.XI-p2.1"></span>[Matt. III.
7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007.md)<span
id="iii.XI-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="iii.XI-p3"></span>“But when he saw many of the Pharisees and
Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of
vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?”

<span id="iii.XI-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.XI-p4.1"></span>How</span> then doth Christ say, that they did
not believe John? <span id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455.md) Because this
was not believing, to decline receiving Him whom he preached. For so
they thought they regarded their prophets and their lawgiver,
nevertheless He said they had not regarded them, forasmuch as they
received not Him, that was foretold by them. “For if ye had <span
id="page_65">p. 65</span> <span id="iii.XI-Page_65"></span> believed
Moses,” saith He, “ye would have believed Me.” <span
id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456.md) And after this again, being asked by
Christ, “The baptism of John, whence is it?” <span
id="fr_457"></span>[458](#fn_457.md) they said, “If we shall say, Of earth,
we fear the people; if we shall say, From heaven, He will say unto us,
How then did ye not believe him?”

<span id="iii.XI-p8"></span>So that from all these things it is manifest
that they came indeed and were baptized, yet they did not abide in the
belief of that which was preached. For John also points out their
wickedness, by their sending <span id="fr_458"></span>[459](#fn_458.md)
unto the Baptist, and saying, “Art thou Elias? Art thou Christ?”
wherefore he also added, “they which were sent were of the
Pharisees.” <span id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459.md)

<span id="iii.XI-p11"></span>“What then? were not the multitudes also of
this same mind”? one may say. Nay, the multitudes in simplicity of mind
had this suspicion, but the Pharisees, wishing to lay hold of Him. For
since it was acknowledged that Christ comes out of the village of David,
and this man was of the tribe of Levi, they laid a snare by the
question, in order that if he should say any such thing they might
quickly come upon him. This at any rate he hath declared by what
follows; for on his not acknowledging any of the things which they
expected, even so they take hold of him, saying, “Why baptizest thou
then, if thou be not the Christ?” <span
id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460.md)

<span id="iii.XI-p13"></span>And to convince thee that the Pharisees
came with one mind, and the people with another, hear how the evangelist
hath declared this too; saying of the people, “that they came and were
baptized of him, confessing their sins;” <span
id="fr_461"></span>[462](#fn_461.md) but concerning the Pharisees, no
longer like that, but that “when he saw many of the Pharisees and
Sadducees coming, he said, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you
to flee from the wrath to come?” O greatness of mind! How doth he
discourse unto men ever thirsting after the blood of the prophets, and
in disposition no better than serpents! how doth he disparage both
themselves and their progenitors with all plainness!

<span id="iii.XI-p15"></span>2. “Yea,” saith one; “he speaks plainly
enough, but the question is if there be any reason in this plainness.
For he did not see them sinning, but in the act of change; wherefore
they did not deserve blame, but rather praise and approbation, for
having left city and houses, and making haste to hear his preaching.”

<span id="iii.XI-p16"></span>What then shall we say? That he had not
things present, and even now doing, in his view, but he knew the secrets
of their mind, God having revealed this. Since then they were priding
themselves on their forefathers, and this was like to prove the cause of
their destruction, and was casting them into a state of carelessness, he
cuts away the roots of their pride. For this cause Isaiah also calls
them, “rulers of Sodom,” and “people of Gomorrah;” <span
id="fr_462"></span>[463](#fn_462.md) and another prophet saith, “Are ye not
as children of the Ethiopians;” <span id="fr_463"></span>[464](#fn_463.md)
and all withdraw them from this way of thinking, bringing down their
pride, which had caused them unnumbered evils.

<span id="iii.XI-p19"></span>“But the prophets,” you will say,
“naturally did so; for they saw them sinning: but in this case, with
what view and for what cause doeth he the same, seeing them obey him.”
To make them yet more tender-hearted.

<span id="iii.XI-p20"></span>But if one accurately mark his words, he
hath also tempered his rebuke with commendation. For he spake these
things, as marveling at them, that they were become able, however late,
to do what seemed almost an impossibility for them. His rebuke, you see,
is rather that of one bringing them over, and working upon them to
arouse themselves. For in that he appears amazed, he implies both their
former wickedness to be great, and their conversion marvellous and
beyond expectation. Thus, “what hath come to pass,” saith he, “that
being children of those men, and brought up so badly, they have
repented? Whence hath come so great a change? Who hath softened down the
harshness of their spirit? Who corrected that which was incurable?”

<span id="iii.XI-p21"></span>And see how straightway from the beginning
he alarmed them, by laying first, for a foundation, his words concerning
hell. For he spake not of the usual topics: “Who hath warned you to flee
from wars, from the inroads of the barbarians, from captivities, from
famines, from pestilences?” but concerning another sort of punishment,
never before made manifest to them, he was striking the first
preparatory note, saying thus, “Who hath warned you to flee from the
wrath to come?”

<span id="iii.XI-p22"></span>And full well did he likewise call them,
“generation of vipers.” For that animal too is said to destroy the
mother that is in travail with her, and eating through her belly, thus
to come forth unto light; which kind of thing these men also did being
“murderers of fathers, and murderers of mothers,” <span
id="fr_464"></span>[465](#fn_464.md) and destroying their instructors with
their own hands.

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span> <span id="iii.XI-Page_66"></span>

<span id="iii.XI-p24"></span>3. However, he stops not at the rebuke, but
introduces advice also. For, “Bring forth,” says he, “fruits meet for
repentance.” <span id="fr_465"></span>[466](#fn_465.md)

<span id="iii.XI-p26"></span>For to flee from wickedness is not enough,
but you must show forth also great virtue. For let me not have that
contradictory yet ordinary <span id="fr_466"></span>[467](#fn_466.md) case,
that <span id="fr_467"></span>[468](#fn_467.md) refraining yourselves for a
little while, ye return unto the same wickedness. For we are not come
for the same objects as the prophets before. Nay, the things that are
now are changed, and are more exalted, forasmuch as the Judge henceforth
is coming, His very self, the very Lord of the kingdom, leading unto
greater self-restraint, calling us to heaven, and drawing us upward to
those abodes. For this cause do I unfold the doctrine also touching
hell, because both the good things and the painful are for ever. Do not
therefore abide as ye are, neither bring forward the accustomed pleas,
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the noble race of your ancestors.”

<span id="iii.XI-p29"></span>And these things he said, not as forbidding
them to say that they were sprung from those holy men, but as forbidding
them to put confidence in this, while they were neglecting the virtue of
the soul; at once bringing forward publicly what was in their minds, and
foretelling things to come. Because after this they are found to say,
“We have Abraham to our father, and were never in bondage to any
man.” <span id="fr_468"></span>[469](#fn_468.md) Since then it was this,
which most of all lifted them up with pride and ruined them, he first
puts it down.

<span id="iii.XI-p31"></span>And see how with his honor paid to the
patriarch he combines his correction touching these things. Namely,
having said, “Think not to say, We have Abraham to our father,” he said
not, “for the patriarch shall not be able to profit you anything,” but
somehow in a more gentle and acceptable manner he intimated the
self-same thing, by saying,

<span id="iii.XI-p32"></span>“For God is able of these stones to raise
up children to Abraham.” <span id="fr_469"></span>[470](#fn_469.md)

<span id="iii.XI-p34"></span>Now some say, that concerning the Gentiles
he saith these things, calling them *stones*, metaphorically; but I say,
that the expression hath also another meaning. But of what kind is this?
Think not, saith he, that if you should perish, you would make the
patriarch childless. This is not, this is not so. For with God it is
possible, both out of stones to give him men, and to bring them to that
relationship; since at the beginning also it was so done. For it was
like the birth of men out of stones, when a child came forth from that
hardened womb.

<span id="iii.XI-p35"></span>This accordingly the prophet also was
intimating, when he said, “Look unto the hard rock, whence ye are hewn,
and to the hole of the pit, whence ye are digged: look unto Abraham your
father, and unto Sarah that bare you.” <span
id="fr_470"></span>[471](#fn_470.md) Now of this prophecy, you see, he
reminds them, showing that if at the beginning he made him a father, as
marvellously as if he had made him so out of stones, it was possible for
this now also to come to pass. And see how he both alarms them, and cuts
them off: in that he said not, “He had already raised up,” lest they
should despair of themselves, but that He “is able to raise up:” and he
said not, “He is able out of stones to make men,” but what was a much
greater thing, “kinsmen and children of Abraham.”

<span id="iii.XI-p37"></span>Seest thou how for the time he drew them
off from their vain imagination about things of the body, and from their
refuge in their forefathers; in order that they might rest the hope of
their salvation in their own repentance and continence? Seest thou how
by casting out their carnal relationship, he is bringing in that which
is of faith?

<span id="iii.XI-p38"></span>4. Mark then how by what follows also he
increases their alarm, and adds intensity to their agonizing fear.

<span id="iii.XI-p39"></span>For having said that “God is able of these
stones to raise up children unto Abraham,” he added, “And now also the
axe is laid unto the root of the trees,” <span
id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471.md) by all means making his speech
alarming. For as he from his way of life had much freedom of speech, so
they needed his severe rebuke, having been left barren <span
id="fr_472"></span>[473](#fn_472.md) now for a long time. For “why do I
say” (such are his words) “that ye are on the point of falling away from
your relationship to the patriarch and of seeing others, even those that
are of stones, brought in to your pre-eminence? Nay, not to this point
only will your penalty reach, but your punishment will proceed further.
“For now,” saith he, “the axe is laid unto the root of the trees.” There
is nothing more terrible than this turn of his discourse. For it is no
longer “a flying sickle,” <span id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473.md) nor
“the taking down of a hedge,” nor “the treading under foot of the
vineyard;” <span id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474.md) but an axe exceeding
sharp, and what is worse, it is even at the doors. For inasmuch as they
continually disbelieved the prophets, and used to say, “Where is the day
of the Lord:” <span id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475.md) and “let <span
id="page_67">p. 67</span> <span id="iii.XI-Page_67"></span> the counsel
of the Holy One of Israel come, that we may know it,” <span
id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476.md) by reason that it was many years
before what they said came to pass; to lead them off from this
encouragement also, he sets the terrors close to them. And this he
declared by saying “now,” and by his putting it to “the root.” “For the
space between is nothing now,” saith he, “but it is laid to the very
root.” And he said not, “to the branches,” nor “to the fruits,” but “to
the root.” Signifying, that if they were negligent, they would have
incurable horrors to endure, and not have so much as a hope of remedy.
It being no servant who is now come, as those before Him were, but the
very Lord of all, bringing on them His fierce and most effectual
vengeance.

<span id="iii.XI-p46"></span>Yet, although he hath terrified them again,
he suffers them not to fall into despair; but as before he said not “He
hath raised up,” but “He is able to raise up children to Abraham” (at
once both alarming and comforting them); even so here also he did not
say that “it hath touched the root,” but “it is laid to the root, and is
now hard by it, and shows signs of no delay.” However, even though He
hath brought it so near, He makes its cutting depend upon you. For if ye
change and become better men, this axe will depart without doing
anything; but if ye continue in the same ways, He will tear up the tree
by the roots. And therefore, observe, it is neither removed from the
root, nor applied as it is doth it cut at all: the one, that ye may not
grow supine, the other to let you know that it is possible even in a
short time to be changed and saved. Wherefore he doth also from all
topics heighten their fear, thoroughly awakening and pressing them on to
repentance. Thus first their falling away from their forefathers; next,
others being introduced instead; lastly, those terrors being at their
doors, the certainty of suffering incurable evils (both which he
declared by the root and the axe), was sufficient to rouse thoroughly
those even that were very supine, and to make them full of anxiety. I
may add, that Paul too was setting forth the same, when he said, “A
short word <span id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477.md) will the Lord make
upon the whole world.” <span id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478.md)

<span id="iii.XI-p49"></span>But be not afraid; or rather, be afraid,
but despair not. For thou hast yet a hope of change; the sentence is not
quite absolute, <span id="fr_479"></span>[480](#fn_479.md) neither did the
axe come to cut (else what hindered it from cutting, close as it was to
the root?); but on purpose by this fear to make thee a better man, and
to prepare thee to bring forth fruit. For this cause he added,
“Therefore every tree, which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn
down, and cast into the fire.” <span id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480.md)
Now by the word “every,” he rejects again the privilege which they had
from their noble descent; “Why, if thou be Abraham’s own descendant,”
saith he, “if thou have thousands of patriarchs to enumerate, thou wilt
but undergo a double punishment, abiding unfruitful.”

<span id="iii.XI-p52"></span>By these words he alarmed even publicans,
the soldiers’ mind was startled by him, not casting them into despair,
yet ridding them of all security. For along with the terror, there is
also much encouragement in what he saith; since by the expression,
“which bringeth not forth good fruit,” he signified that what bears
fruit is delivered from all vengeance.

<span id="iii.XI-p53"></span>5. “And how,” saith one, “shall we be able
to bring forth fruit, when the edge is being applied, and the time so
strait, and the appointed season cut short.” “Thou wilt be able,” saith
he, “for this fruit is not of the same kind as that of common trees,
waiting a long time, and in bondage to the necessities <span
id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481.md) of seasons, and requiring much other
management; but it is enough to be willing, and the tree at once hath
put forth its fruit. For not the nature of the root only, but also the
skill of the husbandman contributes the most to that kind of
fruit-bearing.”

<span id="iii.XI-p55"></span>For (let me add) on account of this,—lest
they should say, “Thou art alarming and pressing, and constraining us,
applying an axe, and threatening us with being cut down, yet requiring
produce in time of punishment,”—he hath added, to signify the ease of
bearing that fruit, “I indeed baptize you with water, but He that cometh
after me is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy
to unloose; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with
fire:” <span id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482.md) implying hereby that
consideration <span id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483.md) only is needed and
faith, not labors and toils; and as it is easy to be baptized, so is it
easy to be converted, and to become better men. So having stirred their
mind by the fear of *God’s* judgment, and the expectation of *His*
punishment, and by the mention of the axe, and by the loss of their
ancestors, and by the bringing in of those other children, and by the
double vengeance of cutting off and burning, and having by all means
softened their hardness, and brought them to desire deliverance from so
great evils; then he brings in what <span id="page_68">p. 68</span>
<span id="iii.XI-Page_68"></span> he hath to say touching Christ; and
not simply, but with a declaration of His great superiority. Then in
setting forth the difference between himself and Him, lest he should
seem to say this out of favor, he establishes the fact by comparison of
the gifts bestowed by each of them. For he did not at once say, “I am
not worthy to unloose the latchet of His shoe;” but when he had first
set forth the little value of his own baptism, and had shown that it
hath nothing more than to lead them to repentance (for he did not say
with water of remission, but of repentance), he sets forth Christ’s
also, which is full of the unspeakable gift. Thus he seems to say,
“Lest, on being told that He cometh after me, thou shouldest despise Him
as having come later; learn thou the virtue <span
id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484.md) of His gift, and thou wilt clearly
know that I uttered nothing worthy nor great, when I said, “I am not
worthy to unloose the latchet of His shoe.” So too when thou art told,
“He is mightier than I,” do not think I said this in the way of making a
comparison. For I am not worthy to be ranked so much as among His
servants, no, not even the lowest of His servants, nor to receive the
least honored portion of His ministry.” Therefore He did not merely say,
“His shoes,” but not even “the latchet,” which kind of office was
counted the last of all. Then to hinder thy attributing what he had said
to humility, he adds also the proof from the facts: “For He shall
baptize you,” saith he, “with the Holy Ghost and with fire.”

<span id="iii.XI-p59"></span>6. Seest thou how great is the wisdom of
the Baptist? how, when He Himself is preaching, He saith everything to
alarm, and fill them with anxiety; but when He is sending men to Him,
whatever was mild and apt to recover them: not bringing forward the axe,
nor the tree that is cut down and burnt, and cast into the fire, nor the
wrath to come, but remission of sins, and removing of punishment, and
righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption, and adoption, and
brotherhood, and a partaking of the inheritance, and an abundant supply
of the Holy Ghost. For all these things he obscurely denoted, when he
said, “He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost;” at once, by the very
figure of speech, declaring the abundance of the grace (for he said not,
“He will give you the Holy Ghost,” but “He will baptize you with the
Holy Ghost”); and by the specification of fire on the other hand
indicating the vehement and uncontrollable quality of His grace.

<span id="iii.XI-p60"></span>Imagine only what sort of men it was meet
for the hearers to become, when they considered that they were at once
to be like the prophets, and like those great ones. For it was on this
account, you see, that he made mention at all of fire; that he might
lead them to reflect on the memory of those men. Because, of all the
visions that appeared unto them, I had almost said, the more part
appeared in fire; thus God discoursed with Moses in the bush, thus with
all the people in the mount Sinai, thus with Ezekiel on the
cherubim. <span id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485.md)

<span id="iii.XI-p62"></span>And mark again how he rouses the hearer, by
putting that first which was to take place after all. For the Lamb was
to be slain, and sin to be blotted out, and the enmity to be destroyed,
and the burial to take place, and the resurrection, and then the Spirit
to come. But none of these things doth he mention as yet, but that first
which was last, and for the sake of which all the former were done, and
which was fittest to proclaim His dignity; so that when the hearer
should be told that he was to receive so great a Spirit he might search
with himself, how and in what manner this shall be, while sin so
prevails; that finding him full of thought and prepared for that lesson,
he might thereupon introduce what he had to say touching the Passion, no
man being any more offended, under the expectation of such a gift.

<span id="iii.XI-p63"></span>Wherefore he again cried out, saying,
“Behold the Lamb of God, which beareth the sin of the world.” <span
id="fr_486"></span>[487](#fn_486.md) He did not say, “which remitteth,”
but, that which implies a more guardian care, “which heareth it.” For it
is not all one, simply to remit, and to take it upon Himself. <span
id="fr_487"></span>[488](#fn_487.md) For the one was to be done without
peril, the other with death.

<span id="iii.XI-p66"></span>And again, he said, “He is Son of
God.” <span id="fr_488"></span>[489](#fn_488.md) But not even this declared
His rank openly to the hearers (for they did not so much as know yet how
to conceive of Him as a true Son): but by so great a gift of the Spirit
that also was established. Therefore the Father also in sending John
gave him, *as you know*, this as a first token of the dignity of Him
that was come, saying, “Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending
and remaining, the same is He which baptizeth with the Holy
Ghost.” <span id="fr_489"></span>[490](#fn_489.md) Wherefore himself too
<span id="page_69">p. 69</span> <span id="iii.XI-Page_69"></span> saith,
“I saw and bare record that this is the Son of God;” as though the one
were to all time the clear evidence of the other.

<span id="iii.XI-p69"></span>7. Then, as having uttered the gentler part
of his message, and soothed and relaxed the hearer, he again binds him
up, that he may not become remiss. For such was the nature of the Jewish
nation; by all encouraging things they were easily puffed up, and
corrupted. Wherefore he again adduces his terrors, saying, “Whose fan is
in His hand.” <span id="fr_490"></span>[491](#fn_490.md)

<span id="iii.XI-p71"></span>Thus, as before he had spoken of the
punishment, so here he points out the Judge likewise, and introduces the
eternal vengeance. For “He will burn the chaff,” saith he, “with
unquenchable fire.” Thou seest that He is Lord of all things, and that
He is Himself the Husbandman; albeit in another place He calls His
Father the same. For “My Father,” saith He, “is the Husbandman.” <span
id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491.md) Thus, inasmuch as He had spoken of an
axe, lest thou shouldest suppose that the thing needed labor, and the
separation was hard to make; by another comparison he suggests the
easiness of it, implying that all the world is His; since He could not
punish those who were not His own. For the present, it is true, all are
mingled together (for though the wheat appears gleaming through, yet it
lies with the chaff, as on a threshing floor, not as in a garner), but
then, great will be the separation.

<span id="iii.XI-p73"></span>Where now are they by whom hell-fire <span
id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md) is disbelieved? Since surely here are
two points laid down, one, that He will baptize with the Holy Ghost, the
other, that He will burn up the disobedient. If then that is credible,
so is this too, assuredly. Yea, this is why the two predictions are put
by him in immediate connection, that by that which hath taken place
already, he might accredit the other, as yet unaccomplished. For Christ
too Himself in many places doth so, often of the same things, and often
of opposites, setting down two prophecies; the one of which He performs
here, the other He promises in the future; that such as are too
contentious may, from the one which has already come to pass, believe
the other also, which is not yet accomplished. For instance, to them
that strip themselves of all that they have for His sake <span
id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493.md) He promised to give an hundred fold in
the present world, and life eternal in that which is to come; by the
things already given making the future also credible. Which, as we see,
John likewise hath done in this place; laying down two things, that He
shall both baptize with the Holy Ghost, and burn up with unquenchable
fire. Now then, if He had not baptized with the Spirit the apostles, and
all every day who are willing, thou mightest have doubts concerning
those other things too; but if that which seems to be greater and more
difficult, and which transcends all reason, hath been done, and is done
every day; how deniest thou that to be true, which is easy, and comes to
pass according to reason? Thus having said, “He shall baptize with the
Holy Ghost and with fire,” and having thence promised great blessings;
lest thou, released wholly from the former things, grow supine, he hath
added the fan, and the judgment thereby declared. Thus, “think not at
all,” saith he, “that your baptism suffices, if ye become ordinary
persons <span id="fr_494"></span>[495](#fn_494.md) hereafter:” for we need
both virtue, and plenty of that known self-restraint. <span
id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495.md) Therefore as by the axe he urges them
unto grace, and unto the font, so after grace he terrifies them by the
fan, and the unquenchable fire. And of the one sort, those yet
unbaptized, he makes no distinction, but saith in general, “Every tree
that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,” <span
id="fr_496"></span>[497](#fn_496.md) punishing all the unbelievers. Whereas
after baptism He works out a kind of division, because many of them that
believed would exhibit a life unworthy of their faith.

<span id="iii.XI-p79"></span>Let no man then become chaff, let no one be
tossed to and fro, nor lie exposed to wicked desires, blown about by
them easily every way. For if thou continue wheat, though temptation be
brought on thee, thou wilt suffer nothing dreadful; nay, for in the
threshing floor, the wheels of the car, that are like saws, <span
id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497.md) do not cut in pieces the wheat; but if
thou fall away into the weakness of chaff, thou wilt both here suffer
incurable ills, being smitten of all men, and there thou wilt undergo
the eternal punishment. For all such persons both before that furnace
become food for the irrational passions here, as chaff is for the brute
animal: and there again they are material and food for the flame.

<span id="iii.XI-p81"></span>Now to have said directly that He will
judge men’s doings, would not so effectually procure acceptance for His
doctrine: but to blend with it the parable, and so establish it all, was
apter to persuade the hearer, and attract him by a more ample
encouragement. Wherefore also Christ Himself <span
id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498.md) for the most part so discourses with
them; threshing floor, <span id="page_70">p. 70</span> <span
id="iii.XI-Page_70"></span> and harvest, and vineyard, and wine-press,
and field, and net, and fishing, and all things familiar, and among
which they were busied He makes ingredients in His discourses. This kind
of thing then the Baptist likewise did here, and offered an exceeding
great demonstration of his words, the giving of the Spirit. For “He who
hath so great power, as both to forgive sins, and to give the Spirit,
much more will these things also be within His power:” so he speaks.

<span id="iii.XI-p83"></span>Seest thou how now in due order the
mystery <span id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499.md) came to be laid as a
foundation, before the resurrection and judgment? <span
id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md)

<span id="iii.XI-p86"></span>“And wherefore,” it may be said, “did he
not mention the signs and wonders which were straightway to be done by
Him?” Because this was greater than all, and for its sake all those were
done. Thus, in his mention of the chief thing, he comprehended all;
death dissolved, sins abolished, the curse blotted out, those long wars
done away; our entrance into paradise, <span
id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501.md) our ascent into heaven, our
citizenship with the angels, our partaking of the good things to come:
for in truth this is the earnest of them all. So that in mentioning
this, he hath mentioned also the resurrection of our bodies, and the
manifestation of His miracles here, and our partaking of His kingdom,
and the good things, which “eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
have entered into the heart of man.” <span
id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502.md) For all these things He bestowed on us
by that gift. It was therefore superfluous to speak of the signs that
were immediately to ensue, and which sight can judge of; but those were
meet to be discoursed on, whereof they doubted; as for instance, that He
is the Son of God; that He exceeds John beyond comparison; that He
“beareth <span id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503.md) the sin of the world;”
that He will require an account of all that we do; that our interests
are not limited to the present, but elsewhere every one will undergo the
due penalty. For these things were not as yet proveable by sight.

<span id="iii.XI-p90"></span>8. Therefore, knowing these things, let us
use great diligence, while we are in the threshing floor; for it is
possible while we are here, to change even out of chaff into wheat, even
as on the other hand many from wheat have become chaff. Let us not then
be supine, nor be carried about with every wind; neither let us separate
ourselves from our brethren, though they seem to be small and mean;
forasmuch as the wheat also compared with the chaff is less in measure,
but better in nature. Look not therefore to the forms of outward pomp,
for they are prepared for the fire, but to this godly humility, so firm
and indissoluble, and which cannot be cut, neither is burnt by the fire.
It being for their sake that He bears long with the very chaff, that by
their intercourse with them they may become better. Therefore judgment
is not yet, that we may be all crowned together, that from wickedness
many may be converted unto virtue.

<span id="iii.XI-p91"></span>Let us tremble then at hearing this
parable. For indeed that fire is unquenchable. “And how,” it may be
said, “is it unquenchable?” Seest thou not this sun ever burning, and
never quenched? didst thou not behold the bush burning, and not
consumed? If then thou also desirest to escape the flame, lay up alms
beforehand, and so thou wilt not even taste of that fire. For if, while
here, thou wilt believe what is told thee, thou shalt not so much as see
this furnace, after thy departure into that region; but if thou
disbelieve it now, thou shalt know it there full well by experience,
when no sort of escape is possible. Since in truth no entreaty shall
avert the punishment from them who have not shown forth an upright life.
For believing surely is not enough, since even the devils tremble at
God, but for all that they will be punished.

<span id="iii.XI-p92"></span>9. Wherefore our care of our conduct hath
need to be great. Why, this is the very reason of our continually
assembling you here; not simply that ye should enter in, but that ye
should also reap some fruit from your continuance here. But if ye come
indeed constantly, but go away again reaping no fruit from thence, ye
will have no advantage from your entering in and attendance in this
place.

<span id="iii.XI-p93"></span>For if we, when sending children to
teachers, should we see them reaping no benefit thereby, begin to be
severe in blaming the teachers, and remove them often to others; what
excuse shall we have for not bestowing upon virtue even so much
diligence as upon these earthly things, but forever bringing our tablets
home empty? And yet our teachers here are more in number and greater.
For no less than prophets and apostles and patriarchs, and all righteous
men, are by us set over you as teachers in every Church. And not even so
is there any profit, but if you have joined in chanting two or three
Psalms, and making the accustomed prayers at random and anyhow, are so
dismissed, ye think this enough for your salvation. Have ye not heard
the prophet, saying (or rather God by the prophet), “This people
honoreth me <span id="page_71">p. 71</span> <span
id="iii.XI-Page_71"></span> with their lips, but their heart is far from
me?” <span id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504.md)

<span id="iii.XI-p95"></span>Therefore, lest this be our case too, wipe
thou out the letters, or rather the impressions, which the devil hath
engraven in thy soul; and bring me a heart set free from worldly
tumults, that without fear I may write on it what I will. Since now at
least there is nothing else to discern, except his letters;—rapines,
covetings, envy, jealousy. Wherefore of course, when I receive your
tablets, I am not able so much as to read them. For I find not the
letters, which we every Lord’s day inscribe on you, and so let you go;
but others, instead of these, unintelligible and misshapen. Then, when
we have blotted them out, and have written those which are of the
Spirit, ye departing, and giving up your hearts to the works of the
devil, give him again power to substitute his own characters in you.
What then will be the end of all this, even without any words of mine,
each man’s own conscience knoweth. For I indeed will not cease to do my
part, and to write in you the right letters. But if ye mar our
diligence, for our part our reward is unaltered, but your danger is not
small.

<span id="iii.XI-p96"></span>Now, though I would fain say nothing to
disgust you, yet I beseech again and entreat you, <span
id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md) imitate at least the little children’s
diligence in these matters. For so they first learn the form of the
letters, after that they practise themselves in distinguishing them put
out of shape, and then at last in their reading they proceed orderly by
means of them. Just so let us also do; let us divide virtue, and learn
first not to swear, nor to forswear ourselves, nor to speak evil; then
proceeding to another row, <span id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md) not
to envy, not to lust, not to be gluttonous, not to be drunken, not
fierce, not slothful, so that from these we may pass on again to the
things of the Spirit, and practise continence, and neglect of the belly,
temperance, righteousness, to be above glory, and gentle and contrite in
mind; and let us join these one with another, and write them upon our
soul.

<span id="iii.XI-p99"></span>10. And all these let us practise at home,
with our own friends, with our wife, with our children. And, for the
present, let us begin with the things that come first, and are easier;
as for instance, with not swearing; and let us practise this one letter
continually at home. For, in truth, there are many at home to hinder
this our practice; sometimes a man’s servant provoking him, sometimes
his wife annoying and angering him, sometimes an indocile and disorderly
child urges him on to threatening and swearing. If now at home, when
thus continually galled, thou shouldest attain not to be tempted into
swearing, thou wilt in the market-place also have power with ease to
abide unconquered.

<span id="iii.XI-p100"></span>Yea, and in like sort, thou wilt attain to
keep thyself from insulting any, by not insulting thy wife, nor thy
servants, nor any one else among those in thy house. For a man’s wife
too not seldom, praising this or that person, or bemoaning herself,
stirs him up to speak evil of that other. But do not thou let thyself be
constrained to speak evil of him that is praised, but bear it all nobly.
And if thou shouldest perceive thy servants praising other masters, be
not perturbed, but stand nobly. Let thy home be a sort of lists, a place
of exercise for virtue, that having trained thyself well there, thou
mayest with entire skill encounter all abroad.

<span id="iii.XI-p101"></span>Do this with respect to vainglory also.
For if thou train thyself not to be vainglorious in company of thy wife
and thy servants, thou wilt not ever afterwards be easily caught by this
passion with regard to any one else. For though this malady be in every
case grievous and tyrannical, yet is it so especially when a woman is
present. If we therefore in that instance put down its power, we shall
easily master it in the other cases also.

<span id="iii.XI-p102"></span>And with respect to the other passions
too, let us do this self-same thing, exercising ourselves against them
at home, and anointing ourselves every day.

<span id="iii.XI-p103"></span>And that our exercise may be easier, let
us further enact a penalty for ourselves, upon our transgressing any of
our purposes. And let the very penalty again be such as brings with it
not loss, but reward,—such as procures some very great gain. And this is
so, if we sentence ourselves to intenser fastings, and to sleeping often
on the bare ground, and to other like austerity. For in this way will
much profit come unto us from every quarter; we shall both live the
sweet life of virtue here, and we shall attain unto the good things to
come and be perpetually friends of God.

<span id="iii.XI-p104"></span>But in order that the same may not happen
again,—that ye may not, having here admired what is said, go your way,
and cast aside at random, wherever it may chance, the tablet of your
mind, and so allow the devil to blot out these things;—let each one, on
returning home, call his own wife, and tell her these things, and take
her to help him; and from this day let him enter into that noble school
of exercise, using for oil the supply of the <span id="page_72">p.
72</span> <span id="iii.XI-Page_72"></span> Spirit. And though thou fall
once, twice, many times in thy training, despair not, but stand again,
and wrestle; and do not give up until thou hast bound on thee the
glorious crown of triumph over the devil, and hast for the time to come
stored up the riches of virtue in an inviolable treasure-house.

<span id="iii.XI-p105"></span>For if thou shouldest establish thyself in
the habits of this noble self-restraint, then, not even when remiss,
wilt thou be able to transgress any of the commandments, habit imitating
the solidity of nature. Yea, as to sleep is easy, and to eat, and to
drink, and to breathe, so also will the deeds of virtue be easy to us,
and we shall reap to ourselves that pure pleasure, resting in a harbor
without a wave, and enjoying continual calm, and with a great freight
bringing our vessel into haven, in that City, on that day; and we shall
attain unto the undecaying crowns, unto which may we all attain, by the
grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be all
glory and might, now and always, and world without end. Amen.
