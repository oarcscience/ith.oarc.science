<span id="iii.LVIII"></span>

<span id="iii.LVIII-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iii.LVIII-p1.1"></span>Homily LXI.</span>

<span id="iii.LVIII-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.LVIII-p2.1"></span>[Matt. XVIII.
21](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.LVIII-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="iii.LVIII-p3"></span>*“Then came Peter to Him, and said, Lord,
how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven
times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times,
but, Until seventy times seven.”* <span
id="fr_2348"></span>[2349](#fn_2348.md)

<span id="iii.LVIII-p5"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.LVIII-p5.1"></span>Peter</span> supposed he was saying something
great, wherefore also as aiming at greatness he added, “Until seven
times?” For this thing, saith he, which Thou hast commanded to do, how
often shall I do? For if he forever sins, but forever when reproved
repents, how often dost thou command us to bear with this man? For with
regard to that other who repents not, neither acknowledges his own
faults, Thou hast set a limit, by saying, “Let him be to thee as the
heathen and the publican;” but to this no longer so, but Thou hast
commanded to accept him.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p6"></span>How often then ought I to bear with him,
being told his faults, and repenting? Is it enough for seven times?

<span id="iii.LVIII-p7"></span>What then saith Christ, the good God, who
is loving towards man? “I say not unto thee, until seven times, but,
until seventy times seven,” not setting a number here, but what is
infinite and perpetual and forever. For even as ten thousand times
signifies <span id="page_358">p. 358</span> <span
id="iii.LVIII-Page_358"></span> often, so here too. For by saying, “The
barren hath borne seven,” <span id="fr_2349"></span>[2350](#fn_2349.md) the
Scripture means many. So that He hath not limited the forgiveness by a
number, but hath declared that it is to be perpetual and forever.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p9"></span>This at least He indicated by the parable
that is put after. For that He might not seem to any to enjoin great
things and hard to bear, by saying, “Seventy times seven,” He added this
parable, at once both leading them on to what He had said, and putting
down him who was priding himself upon this, and showing the act was not
grievous, but rather very easy. Therefore let me add, He brought forward
His own love to man, that by the comparison, as He saith, thou mightest
learn, that though thou forgive seventy times seven, though thou
continually pardon thy neighbor for absolutely all his sins, as a drop
of water to an endless sea, so much, or rather much more, doth thy love
to man come short in comparison of the boundless goodness of God, of
which thou standest in need, for that thou art to be judged, and to give
an account.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p10"></span>Wherefore also He went on to say, “The
Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a certain king, which would take
account of his servants. <span id="fr_2350"></span>[2351](#fn_2350.md) And
when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him
ten thousand talents. But forasmuch as he had not to pay, <span
id="fr_2351"></span>[2352](#fn_2351.md) he commanded him to be sold, and
his wife, and his children, and all that he had.” <span
id="fr_2352"></span>[2353](#fn_2352.md)

<span id="iii.LVIII-p14"></span>Then after this man had enjoyed the
benefit of mercy, he went out, and “took by the throat his
fellow-servant, which owed him an hundred pence;” <span
id="fr_2353"></span>[2354](#fn_2353.md) and having by these doings moved
his lord, he caused him to cast him again into prison, until he should
pay off the whole.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p16"></span>Seest thou how great the difference
between sins against man and against God? As great as between ten
thousand talents, and a hundred pence, or rather even much more. And
this arises both from the difference of the persons, and the constant
succession of our sins. For when a man looks at us, we stand off and
shrink from sinning: but when God sees us every day, we do not forbear,
but do and speak all things without fear.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p17"></span>But not hereby alone, but also from the
benefit and from the honor of which we have partaken, our sins become
more grievous.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p18"></span>And if ye are desirous to learn how our
sins against Him are ten thousand talents, or rather even much more, I
will try to show it briefly. But I fear lest to them that are inclined
to wickedness, and love continually to sin, I should furnish still
greater security, or should drive the meeker sort to despair, and they
should repeat that saying of the disciples, “who can be saved?” <span
id="fr_2354"></span>[2355](#fn_2354.md)

<span id="iii.LVIII-p20"></span>Nevertheless for all that I will speak,
that I may make those that attend more safe, and more meek. For they
that are incurably diseased, and past feeling, even without these words
of mine, do not depart from their own carelessness, and wickedness; and
if even from hence they derive greater occasion for contempt, the fault
is not in what is said, but in their insensibility; since what is said
surely is enough both to restrain those that attend to it, and to prick
their hearts; and the meeker sort, when they see on the one hand the
greatness of their sins, and learn also on the other hand the power of
repentance, will cleave to it the more, wherefore it is needful to
speak.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p21"></span>I will speak then, and will set forth
our sins, both wherein we offend against God, and wherein against men,
and I will set forth not each person’s own, but what are common; but his
own let each one join to them after that from his conscience.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p22"></span>And I will do this, having first set
forth the good deeds of God to us. What then are His good deeds? He
created us when we were not, and made all things for our sakes that are
seen, Heaven, sea, air, all that in them is, living creatures, plants,
seeds; for we must needs speak briefly for the boundless ocean of the
works. Into us alone of all that are on earth He breathed a living soul
such as we have, He planted a garden, He gave a help-meet, He set us
over all the brutes, He crowned us with glory and honor.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p23"></span>After that, when man had been unthankful
towards his benefactor, He vouchsafed unto him a greater gift.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p24"></span>2. For look not to this only, that He
cast him out of paradise, but mark also the gain that arose from thence.
For after having cast him out of paradise, and having wrought those
countless good works, and having accomplished His various dispensations,
He sent even His own Son for the sake of them that had been benefited by
Him and were hating Him, and opened Heaven to us, and unfolded paradise
itself, and made us sons, the enemies, the unthankful.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p25"></span>Wherefore it were even seasonable now to
say, “O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of
God!” <span id="fr_2355"></span>[2356](#fn_2355.md)

<span id="iii.LVIII-p27"></span>And He gave us also a baptism of the re
<span id="page_359">p. 359</span> <span id="iii.LVIII-Page_359"></span>
mission of sins, and a deliverance from vengeance, and an inheritance of
a kingdom, and He promised numberless good things on our doing what is
right, and stretched forth His hand, and shed abroad His Spirit into our
hearts.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p28"></span>What then? After so many and such great
blessings, what ought to be our disposition; should we indeed, even if
each day we died for Him who so loves us, make due recompense, or rather
should we repay the smallest portion of the debt? By no means, for
moreover even this again is turned to our advantage.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p29"></span>How then are we disposed, whose
disposition ought to be like this? Each day we insult His law. But be ye
not angry, if I let loose my tongue against them that sin, for not you
only will I accuse, but myself also.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p30"></span>Where then would ye that I should begin?
With the slaves, or with the free? with them that serve in the army, or
with private persons? with the rulers, or with the subjects? with the
women, or with the men? with the aged men, or with the young? with what
age? with what race? with what rank? with what pursuit?

<span id="iii.LVIII-p31"></span>Would ye then that I should make the
beginning with them that serve as soldiers? What sin then do not these
commit every day, insulting, reviling, frantic, making a gain of other
men’s calamities, being like wolves, never clear from offenses, unless
one might say the sea too was without waves. What passion doth not
trouble them? what disease doth not lay siege to their soul?

<span id="iii.LVIII-p32"></span>For to their equals they show a jealous
disposition, and they envy, and seek after vainglory; and to those that
are subject to them, their disposition is covetous; but to them that
have suits, and run unto them as to a harbor, their conduct is that of
enemies and perjured persons. How many robberies are there with them!
How many frauds! How many false accusations, and meannesses! how many
servile flatteries!

<span id="iii.LVIII-p33"></span>Come then, let us apply in each case the
law of Christ. “He that saith to his brother, Thou fool, shall be in
danger of hell fire. <span id="fr_2356"></span>[2357](#fn_2356.md) He that
hath looked on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed
adultery with her. <span id="fr_2357"></span>[2358](#fn_2357.md) Unless one
humble himself as the little child, he shall not enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven.” <span id="fr_2358"></span>[2359](#fn_2358.md)

<span id="iii.LVIII-p37"></span>But these even study haughtiness,
becoming towards them that are subject to them, and are delivered into
their hands, and who tremble at them, and are afraid of them, more
fierce than a wild beast; for Christ’s sake doing nothing, but all
things for the belly, for money, for vainglory.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p38"></span>Can one indeed reckon up in words the
trespass of their actions? What should one say of their decisions, their
laughter, their unseasonable discourses, their filthy language? But
about covetousness one cannot so much as speak. For like as the monks on
the mountains know not even what covetousness is, so neither do these;
but in an opposite way to them. For they indeed, because of being far
removed from the disease, know not the passion, but these, by reason of
being exceedingly intoxicated with it, have not so much as a perception
how great the evil is. For this vice hath so thrust aside virtue and
tyrannises, that it is not accounted so much as a heavy charge with
those madmen.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p39"></span>But will ye, that we leave these, and go
to others of a gentler kind? Come then, let us examine the race of
workmen and artisans. For these above all seem to live by honest labors,
and the sweat of their own brow. But these too, when they do not take
heed to themselves, gather to themselves many evils from hence. For the
dishonesty that arises from buying and selling they bring into the work
of honest labor, and add oaths, and perjuries, and falsehoods to their
covetousness often, and are taken up with worldly things only, and
continue riveted to the earth; and while they do all things that they
may get money, they do not take much heed that they may impart to the
needy, being always desirous to increase their goods. What should one
say of the revilings that are uttered touching such matters, the
insults, the loans, the usurious gains, the bargains full of much mean
trafficking, the shameless buyings and sellings.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p40"></span>3. But will ye that we leave these too,
and go to others who seem to be more just? Who then are they? They that
are possessed of lands, and reap the wealth that springs from the earth.
And what can be more unjust than these? For if any one were to examine
how they treat their wretched and toil-worn laborers, he will see them
to be more cruel than savages. For upon them that are pining with
hunger, and toiling throughout all their life, they both impose constant
and intolerable payments, and lay on them laborious burdens, and like
asses or mules, or rather like stones, do they treat their bodies,
allowing them not so much as to draw breath a little, and when the earth
yields, and when it doth not yield, they alike wear them out, and grant
them no indulgence. And what can be more pitiable than this, when after
<span id="page_360">p. 360</span> <span id="iii.LVIII-Page_360"></span>
having labored throughout the whole winter, and being consumed with
frost and rain, and watchings, they go away with their hands empty, yea
moreover in debt, and fearing and dreading more that this famine and
shipwreck, the torments of the overlookers, <span
id="fr_2359"></span>[2360](#fn_2359.md) and their dragging them about, and
their demands, and their imprisonments, and the services from which no
entreaty can deliver them!

<span id="iii.LVIII-p42"></span>Why should one speak of the merchandise
which they make of them, the sordid gains which they gain by them, by
their labors and their sweat filling winepresses, and wine vats, but not
suffering them to take home so much as a small measure, but draining off
the entire fruits into the casks of their wickedness, and flinging to
them for this a little money?

<span id="iii.LVIII-p43"></span>And new kinds of usuries also do they
devise, and not lawful even according to the laws of the heathens, and
they frame contracts for loans full of many a curse. For not the
hundredth part of the sum, but the half of the sum they press for and
exact; and this when he of whom it is exacted has a wife, is bringing up
children, is a human being, and is filling their threshing floor, and
their wine-press by his own toils.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p44"></span>But none of these things do they
consider. Wherefore now it were seasonable to bring forward the prophet
and say, “Be astonished, O Heaven, and be horribly afraid, O
earth,” <span id="fr_2360"></span>[2361](#fn_2360.md) to what great
brutality hath the race of man been madly carried away! <span
id="fr_2361"></span>[2362](#fn_2361.md)

<span id="iii.LVIII-p47"></span>But these things I say, not blaming
crafts, nor husbandry, nor military service, <span
id="fr_2362"></span>[2363](#fn_2362.md) but ourselves. Since Cornelius also
was a centurion, and Paul a worker in leather, and after his preaching
practised his craft, and David was a king, and Job enjoyed the
possession of land and of large revenues, and there was no hindrance
hereby to any of these in the way of virtue.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p49"></span>Bearing in mind all these things, and
considering the ten thousand talents, let us at least hence hasten to
remit to our neighbors their few and trifling debts. For we too have an
account to give of the commandments wherewith we have been trusted, and
we are not able to pay all, no not whatever we may do. Therefore God
hath given us a way to repayment both ready and easy, and which is able
to cancel all these things, I mean, not to be revengeful.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p50"></span>In order then that we may learn this
well, let us hear the whole parable, going on regularly through it. “For
there was brought unto Him,” it saith, “one which owed ten thousand
talents, and when he had not to pay, He commanded him to be sold, and
his wife, and his children.” Wherefore, I pray thee? Not of cruelty, nor
of inhumanity (for the loss came back again upon himself, for she too
was a slave), but of unspeakable tenderness.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p51"></span>For it is His purpose to alarm him by
this threat, that He might bring him to supplication, not that he should
be sold. For if He had done it for this intent, He would not have
consented to his request, neither would He have granted the favor.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p52"></span>Wherefore then did He not do this, nor
forgive the debt before the account? Desiring to teach him, from how
many obligations He is delivering him, that in this way at least he
might become more mild towards his fellow servant. For even if when he
had learnt the weight of his debt, and the greatness of the forgiveness,
he continued taking his fellow-servant by the throat; if He had not
disciplined him beforehand with such medicines, to what length of
cruelty might he not have gone?

<span id="iii.LVIII-p53"></span>What then saith the other? “Have
patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And his Lord <span
id="fr_2363"></span>[2364](#fn_2363.md) was moved with compassion, and
loosed him, and forgave him the debt.” <span
id="fr_2364"></span>[2365](#fn_2364.md)

<span id="iii.LVIII-p56"></span>Seest thou again surpassing benevolence?
The servant asked only for delay and putting off the time, but He gave
more than he asked, remission and forgiveness of the entire debt. For it
had been his will to give it even from the first, but he did not desire
the gift to be his only, but also to come of this man’s entreaty, that
he might not go away uncrowned. For that the whole was of him, although
this other fell down to him and prayed, the motive of the forgiveness
showed, for “moved with compassion” he forgave him. But still even so he
willed that other also to seem to contribute something, that he might
not be exceedingly covered with shame, and that he being schooled in his
own calamities, might be indulgent to his fellow-servant.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p57"></span>4. Up to this point then this man was
good and acceptable; for he confessed, and promised to pay the debt, and
fell down before him, and entreated, and condemned his own sins, and
knew the greatness of the debt. But the sequel is unworthy of his former
deeds. For going out straightway, not after a long time but straightway,
having the bene <span id="page_361">p. 361</span> <span
id="iii.LVIII-Page_361"></span> fit fresh <span
id="fr_2365"></span>[2366](#fn_2365.md) upon him, he abused to wickedness
the gift, even the freedom bestowed on him by his master.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p59"></span>For, “he found one of his
fellow-servants, which owed him an hundred pence, and took him by the
throat, saying, Pay me what thou owest.” <span
id="fr_2366"></span>[2367](#fn_2366.md)

<span id="iii.LVIII-p61"></span>Seest thou the master’s benevolence?
Seest thou the servant’s cruelty? Hear, ye who do these things for
money. For if for sins we must not do so, much more not for money.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p62"></span>What then saith the other? “Have
patience with me, and I will pay thee all.” <span
id="fr_2367"></span>[2368](#fn_2367.md) But he did not regard even the
words by which he had been saved (for he himself on saying this was
delivered from the ten thousand talents), and did not recognize so much
as the harbor by which he escaped shipwreck; the gesture of supplication
did not remind him of his master’s kindness, but he put away from him
all these things, from covetousness and cruelty and revenge, and was
more fierce than any wild beast, seizing his fellow-servant by the
throat.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p64"></span>What doest thou, O man? perceivest thou
not, thou art making the demand upon thyself, thou an thrusting the
sword into thyself, and revoking the sentence and the gift? But none of
these things did he consider, neither did he remember his own state,
neither did he yield; although the entreaty was not for equal objects.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p65"></span>For the one besought for ten thousand
talents, the other for a hundred pence; the one his fellow-servant, the
other his lord; the one received entire forgiveness, the other asked for
delay, and not so much as this did he give him, for “he cast him into
prison.”

<span id="iii.LVIII-p66"></span>“But when his fellow-servants saw it,
they accused him to their lord.” Not even to men is this well-pleasing,
much less to God. They therefore who did not owe, partook of the grief.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p67"></span>What then saith their lord? “O thou
wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou
desiredst <span id="fr_2368"></span>[2369](#fn_2368.md) me; shouldest not
thou also have had compassion, even as I had pity on thee?” <span
id="fr_2369"></span>[2370](#fn_2369.md)

<span id="iii.LVIII-p70"></span>See again the lord’s gentleness. He
pleads with him, and excuses himself, being on the point of revoking his
gift; or rather, it was not he that revoked it, but the one who had
received it. Wherefore He saith, “I forgave thee all that debt, because
thou desiredst me; shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy
fellow-servant?” For even if the thing doth seem to thee hard; yet
shouldest thou have looked to the gain, which hath been, which is to be.
Even if the injunction be galling, thou oughtest to consider the reward;
neither that he hath grieved thee, but that thou hast provoked God, whom
by mere prayer thou hast reconciled. But if even so it be a galling
thing to thee to become friends with him who hath grieved thee, to fall
into hell is far more grievous; and if thou hadst set this against that,
then thou wouldest have known that to forgive is a much lighter thing.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p71"></span>And whereas, when he owed ten thousand
talents, he called him not wicked, neither reproached him, but showed
mercy on him; when he had become harsh to his fellow-servant, then he
saith, “O thou wicked servant.”

<span id="iii.LVIII-p72"></span>Let us hearken, the covetous, for even
to us is the word spoken. Let us hearken also, the merciless, and the
cruel, for not to others are we cruel, but to ourselves. When then thou
art minded to be revengeful, consider that against thyself art thou
revengeful, not against another; that thou art binding up thine own
sins, not thy neighbors. For as to thee, whatsoever thou mayest do to
this man, thou doest as a man and in the present life, but God not so,
but more mightily will He take vengeance on thee, and with the vengeance
hereafter.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p73"></span>“For He delivered him over till he
should pay that which was due,” that is, for ever; for he will never
repay. For since thou art not become better by the kindness shown thee,
it remains that by vengeance thou be corrected.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p74"></span>And yet, “The graces and the gifts are
without repentance,” <span id="fr_2370"></span>[2371](#fn_2370.md) but
wickedness has had such power as to set aside even this law. What then
can be a more grievous thing than to be revengeful, when it appears to
overthrow such and so great a gift of God.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p76"></span>And he did not merely “deliver” him, but
“was wroth.” For when he commanded him to be sold, his were not the
words of wrath (therefore neither did he do it), but a very great
occasion for benevolence; but now the sentence is of much indignation,
and vengeance, and punishment.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p77"></span>What then means the parable? “So
likewise shall my Father do also unto you,” He saith, “if ye from your
hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.” <span
id="fr_2371"></span>[2372](#fn_2371.md)

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span> <span id="iii.LVIII-Page_362"></span>

<span id="iii.LVIII-p79"></span>He saith not “your Father,” but “my
Father.” For it is not meet for God to be called the Father of such a
one, who is so wicked and malicious.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p80"></span>5. Two things therefore doth He here
require, both to condemn ourselves for our sins, and to forgive others;
and the former for the sake of the latter, that this may become more
easy (for he who considers his own sins is more indulgent to his
fellow-servant); and not merely to forgive with the lips, but from the
heart.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p81"></span>Let us not then thrust the sword into
ourselves by being revengeful. For what grief hath he who hath grieved
thee inflicted upon thee, like thou wilt work unto thyself by keeping
thine anger in mind, and drawing upon thyself the sentence from God to
condemn thee? For if indeed thou art watchful, and keepest thyself under
control, the evil will come round upon his head, and it will be he that
will suffer harm; but if thou shouldest continue indignant, and
displeased, then thyself wilt undergo the harm not from him, but from
thyself.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p82"></span>Say not then that he insulted thee, and
slandered thee, and did unto thee ills beyond number; for the more thou
tellest, so much the more dost thou declare him a benefactor. For he
hath given thee an opportunity to wash away thy sins; so that the
greater the injuries he hath done thee, so much more is he become to
thee a cause of a greater remission of sins.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p83"></span>For if we be willing, no one shall be
able to injure us, but even our enemies shall advantage us in the
greatest degree. And why do I speak of men? For what can be more wicked
than the devil; yet nevertheless, even hence have we a great opportunity
of approving ourselves; and Job showeth it. But if the devil hath become
a cause of crowns, why art thou afraid of a man as an enemy?

<span id="iii.LVIII-p84"></span>See then how much thou gainest, bearing
meekly the spiteful acts of thine enemies. First and greatest,
deliverance from sins; secondly, fortitude and patience; thirdly,
mildness and benevolence; for he that knoweth not how to be angry with
them that grieve him, much more will he be ready to serve them that love
him. Fourthly, to be free from anger continually, to which nothing can
be equal. For of him that is free from anger, it is quite clear that he
is delivered also from the despondency hence arising, and will not spend
his life on vain labors and sorrows. For he that knows not how to hate,
neither doth he know how to grieve, but will enjoy pleasure, and ten
thousand blessings. So that we punish ourselves by hating others, even
as on the other hand we benefit ourselves by loving them.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p85"></span>Besides all these things, thou wilt be
an object of veneration even to thy very enemies, though they be devils;
or rather, thou wilt not so much as have an enemy whilst thou art of
such a disposition.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p86"></span>But what is greater than all, and first,
thou gainest the favor of God. Shouldest thou have sinned, thou wilt
obtain pardon; shouldest thou have done what is right, thou wilt obtain
a greater confidence. Let us accomplish therefore the hating no one,
that God also may love us, that, though we be in debt for ten thousand
talents, He may have compassion and pity us.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p87"></span>But hast thou been injured by him? Pity
him then, do not hate him; weep and mourn, do not turn away from him.
For thou art not the one that hath offended against God, but he; but
thou hast even approved thyself, if thou endure it. Consider that
Christ, when about to be crucified, rejoiced for Himself, but wept for
them that were crucifying Him. This ought to be our disposition also;
and the more we are injured, so much the more should we lament for them
that are injuring us. For to us many are the benefits hence arising, but
to them the opposites.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p88"></span>But did he insult thee, and strike thee
before all? Then hath he disgraced and dishonored himself before all,
and hath opened the mouths of a thousand accusers, and for thee hath he
woven more crowns, and gathered for thee many to publish thy
forbearance.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p89"></span>But did he slander thee to others? And
what is this? God is the one that is to demand the account, not they
that have heard this. For to himself hath he added occasion of
punishment, so that not only for his own sins he should give account,
but also of what he said of thee. And upon thee hath he brought evil
report with men, but he himself hath incurred evil report with God.

<span id="iii.LVIII-p90"></span>And if these things are not sufficient
for thee, consider that even thy Lord <span
id="fr_2372"></span>[2373](#fn_2372.md) was evil reported of both by Satan
and by men, and that to those most loved by Him; and His Only-Begotten
the same again. Wherefore He said, “If they have called the Master of
the house Beelzebub, much more shall they call them of His
household.” <span id="fr_2373"></span>[2374](#fn_2373.md)

<span id="iii.LVIII-p93"></span>And that wicked demon did not only
slander Him, but was also believed, and slandered Him not in ordinary
matters, but with the greatest reproaches and accusations. For he
affirmed Him to be possessed, and to be a deceiver, and an adversary of
God.

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span> <span id="iii.LVIII-Page_363"></span>

<span id="iii.LVIII-p94"></span>But hast thou also done good, and
received evil? Nay, in respect of this most of all lament and grieve for
him that hath done the wrong, but for thyself rather rejoice, because
thou art become like God, “Who maketh the sun to rise upon evil and
good.” <span id="fr_2374"></span>[2375](#fn_2374.md)

<span id="iii.LVIII-p96"></span>But if to follow God is beyond thee,
although to him that watcheth not even this is hard; yet nevertheless if
this seem to thee to be too great for thee, come let us bring thee to
thy fellow-servants, to Joseph, who suffered countless things, and did
good unto his brethren; to Moses, who after their countless plots
against him, prayed for them; to the blessed Paul, who cannot so much as
number what he suffered from them, and is willing to be accursed for
them; to Stephen, who is stoned, and entreating this sin may be forgiven
them. And having considered all these things, cast away all anger, that
God may forgive us also all our trespasses by the grace and love towards
man of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost
be glory, might, honor, now and always, and world without end. Amen.
