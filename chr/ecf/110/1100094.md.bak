<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p3"></span>*“Now when they were going, behold, some
of the watch came into the city, and declared unto the chief priests all
the things that were done.* <span id="fr_3157"></span>[3158](#fn_3157.md)
*And when they had assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel,
they gave large money unto the soldiers, saying, Say ye, His disciples
came by night, and stole Him away while we slept. And if this come to
the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.”* <span
id="fr_3158"></span>[3159](#fn_3158.md)

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p6"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.LXXXVI-p6.1"></span>For</span> the sake of these soldiers that
earthquake took place, in order to dismay them, and that the testimony
might come from them, which accordingly was the result. For the report
was thus free from suspicion, as proceeding from the guards themselves.
For of the signs some were displayed publicly to the world, others
privately to those present on the spot; publicly for the world was the
darkness, privately the appearance of the angel, the earthquake. When
then they came and showed it (for truth shines forth, being proclaimed
by its adversaries), they again gave money, that they might say, as it
is expressed, “that His disciples came and stole Him.”

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p7"></span>How did they steal Him? O most foolish
of all men! For because of the clearness and conspicuousness of the
truth, they are not even able to make up a falsehood. For indeed what
they said was highly incredible, and the falsehood had not even
speciousness. For how, I ask, did the disciples steal Him, men poor and
unlearned, and not venturing so much as to show themselves? What? was
not a seal put upon it? What? were there not so many watchmen, and
soldiers, and Jews stationed round it? What? did not those men suspect
this very thing, and take thought, and break their rest, and continue
anxious about it? And wherefore moreover did they steal it? That they
might feign the doctrine of the resurrection? And how should it enter
their minds to feign such a thing, men who were well content to be
hidden and to live? And how could they remove the stone that was made
sure? how could they have escaped the observation of so many? Nay,
though they had despised death, they would not have attempted without
purpose, and fruitlessly to venture in defiance of so many who were on
the watch. And that moreover they were timorous, what they had done
before showed clearly, at least, when they saw Him seized, all rushed
away from Him. If then at that time they did not dare so much as to
stand their ground when they saw Him alive, how when He was dead could
they but have feared such a number of soldiers? What? was it to burst
open a door? Was it that one should escape notice? A great stone lay
upon it, needing many hands to move it.

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p8"></span>They were right in saying, “So the last
error shall be worse than the first,” <span
id="fr_3159"></span>[3160](#fn_3159.md) making this declaration against
themselves, for that, when after so much mad conduct they ought to have
repented, they rather strive to outdo their former acts, feigning absurd
fictions, and as, when He was alive, they purchased His blood, so when
He was dead and risen again, they again by money were striving to
undermine the evidence of His resurrection. But do thou mark, I pray
thee, how by their own doings they are caught everywhere. For if they
had not come to Pilate, nor asked for the guard, they would have been
more able to act thus impudently, but as it was, not so. For indeed, as
though they were laboring to stop their own mouths, even so did they all
things. For if the disciples had not strength to watch with Him, and
that, though upbraided by Him, how could they have ventured upon these
things? And wherefore did they not steal Him before this, but when ye
were come? For if they had been minded to do this, they would have done
it, when the tomb was not yet guarded on the first night, when it was to
be done without danger, and in security. For it was on the Sabbath that
they came and begged of Pilate to have the watch, and kept guard, but
during the first night none of these was present by the sepulchre.

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p10"></span>2. And what mean also the napkins that
were stuck on with the myrrh; for Peter saw these lying. For if they had
been disposed to steal, they would not have stolen the body <span
id="page_512">p. 512</span> <span id="iii.LXXXVI-Page_512"></span>
naked, not because of dishonoring it only, but in order not to delay and
lose time in stripping it, and not to give them that were so disposed
opportunity to awake and seize them. Especially when it was myrrh, a
drug that adheres so to the body, and cleaves to the clothes, whence it
was not easy to take the clothes off the body, but they that did this
needed much time, so that from this again, the tale of the theft is
improbable.

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p11"></span>What? did they not know the rage of the
Jews? and that they would vent their anger on them? And what profit was
it at all to them, if He had not risen again?

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p12"></span>So these men, being conscious that they
had made up all this tale, gave money, and said, “Say ye these things,
and we will persuade the governor.” For they desire that the report
should be published, fighting in vain against the truth; and by their
endeavors to obscure it, by these even against their will they
occasioned it to appear clearly. For indeed even this establishes the
resurrection, the fact I mean of their saying, that the disciples stole
Him. For this is the language of men confessing, that the body was not
there. When therefore they confess the body was not there, but the
stealing it is shown to be false and incredible, by their watching by
it, and by the seals, and by the timidity of the disciples, the proof of
the resurrection even hence appears incontrovertible.

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p13"></span>Nevertheless, these shameless and
audacious men, although there were so many things to stop their mouths,
“Say ye,” these are their words, “and we will persuade, and will secure
you.” Seest thou all depraved? Pilate, for he was persuaded? the
soldiers? the Jewish people? But marvel not, if money prevailed over
soldiers. For if with His disciple it showed its might to be so great,
much more with these.

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p14"></span>“And this saying is commonly reported,”
it is said, “until this day.” <span id="fr_3160"></span>[3161](#fn_3160.md)
Seest thou again the disciples’ love of truth, how they are not ashamed
of saying even this, that such a report prevailed against them.

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p16"></span>“Then the eleven disciples went away
into Galilee, and some worshipped, and some when they saw Him
doubted.” <span id="fr_3161"></span>[3162](#fn_3161.md)

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p18"></span>This seems to me to be the last
appearance in Galilee, when He sent them forth to baptize. And if “some
doubted,” herein again admire their truthfulness, how they conceal not
even their shortcomings up to the last day. Nevertheless, even these are
assured by their sight.

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p19"></span>What then saith He unto them, when He
seeth them? “All power is given unto me in heaven and on earth.” <span
id="fr_3162"></span>[3163](#fn_3162.md) Again He speaketh to them more
after the manner of man, for they had not yet received the spirit, which
was able to raise them on high. “Go ye, make disciples of all nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have
commanded you;” <span id="fr_3163"></span>[3164](#fn_3163.md) giving the
one charge with a view to doctrine, the other concerning commandments.
And of the Jews He makes no mention, neither brings forward what had
been done, nor upbraids Peter with his denial, nor any one of the others
with their flight, but having put into their hands a summary of the
doctrine, that expressed by the form of baptism, commands them to pour
forth over the whole world.

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p22"></span>After that, because he had enjoined on
them great things, to raise their courage, He says, “Lo! I am with you
alway, even unto the end of the world.” <span
id="fr_3164"></span>[3165](#fn_3164.md) Seest thou His own proper power
again? Seest thou how those other things also were spoken for
condescension? And not with those men only did He promise to be, but
also with all that believe after them. For plainly the apostles were not
to remain here unto “the end of the world;” but he speaks to the
believers as to one body. For tell me not, saith He, of the difficulty
of the things: for “I am with you,” who make all things easy. This He
said to the prophets also in the Old Testament continually, as well to
Jeremiah objecting his youth, <span id="fr_3165"></span>[3166](#fn_3165.md)
as to Moses <span id="fr_3166"></span>[3167](#fn_3166.md) and Ezekiel <span
id="fr_3167"></span>[3168](#fn_3167.md) shrinking from the office, “I am
with you,” this here also to these men. And mark, I pray thee, the
excellence of these, for the others, when sent to one nation, often
excused themselves, but these said nothing of the sort, though sent to
the world. And He reminds them also of the consummation, that He may
draw them on more, and that they may look not at the present dangers
only, but also at the good things to come that are without end.

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p27"></span>“For the irksome things, saith He, that
ye will undergo are finished together with the present life, since at
least even this world itself shall come to an end, but the good things
which ye shall enjoy remain immortal, as I have often told you before.”
Thus having <span id="page_513">p. 513</span> <span
id="iii.LXXXVI-Page_513"></span> invigorated and roused their minds, by
the remembrance of that day, He sent them forth. For that day to them
that live in good works is to be desired, even as on the other hand to
those in sin, it is terrible as to the condemned.

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p28"></span>But let us not fear only, and shudder,
but let us change too, while there is opportunity, and let us rise out
of our wickedness, for we can, if we be willing. For if before grace
many did this, much more after grace.

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p29"></span>3. For what grievous things are we
enjoined? to cleave mountains asunder? to fly into the air? or to cross
the Tuscan sea? By no means, but a way of life so easy, as not so much
as to want any instruments, but a soul and purpose only. For what
instruments had these apostles, who effected such things? Did they not
go about with one vestment and unshod? and they got the better of all.

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p30"></span>For what is difficult of the
injunctions? Have no enemy. Hate no man. Speak ill of no man. Nay, the
opposites of these things are the greater hardships. But He said, you
reply, Throw away thy money. Is this then the grievous thing? In the
first place, He did not command, but advised it. Yet even if it were a
command, what is it grievous not to carry about burdens and unseasonable
cares?

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p31"></span>But oh covetousness! All things are
become money; for this cause all things are turned upside down. If
anyone declares another happy, he mentions this; should he pronounce him
wretched, hence is derived the description of wretchedness. And all
reckonings are made on this account, how such an one gets rich, how such
an one gets poor. Should it be military service, should it be marriage,
should it be a trade, should it be what you will that any man takes in
hand, he does not apply to what is proposed, until he see these riches
are coming in rapidly upon him. After this shall we not meet together
and consult how we shall drive away this pest? Shall we not regard with
shame the good deeds of our fathers? of the three thousand, of the five
thousand, who had all things common?

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p32"></span>What is the profit of this present
life, when we do not use it for our future gain? How long do ye not
enslave the mammon that hath enslaved you? How long are ye slaves of
money? How long have ye no love for liberty, and do not rend in pieces
the bargains of covetousness? But while, if ye should have become slaves
of men, you do all things, if any one should promise you liberty; yet
being captives of covetousness, ye do not so much as consider how ye may
be delivered from this bitter bondage. And yet the one were nothing
terrible, the other is the most bitter tyranny.

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p33"></span>Consider how great a price Christ paid
for us. He shed His own blood; He gave up Himself. But ye, even after
all this, are grown supine; and the most grievous thing of all is, that
ye even take delight in the slavery, ye luxuriate in the dishonor, and
that, from which ye ought to flee, is become an object of desire to you.

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p34"></span>But since it is right not only to
lament and to blame, but also to correct, let us see from what cause
this passion and this evil have become an object of desire to you.
Whence then, whence hath this come to be an object of desire? Because,
thou sayest, it makes me to be in honor and in security. In what kind of
security, I pray thee? In the confidence, not to suffer hunger, nor
cold, not to be harmed, not to be despised. Wilt thou then, if we
promise thee this security, refrain from being rich? For if it is for
this that riches are an object of desire, if it be in your power to have
security without these, what need hast thou of these any more? “And how
is it possible,” thou sayest, “for one who is not rich to attain to
this?” Nay, how is it possible (for I say the opposite thing) if one is
rich? For it is necessary to flatter many, both rulers and subjects, and
to entreat countless numbers, and to be a base slave, and to be in fear
and trembling, and to regard with suspicion the eyes of the envious, and
to fear the tongues of false accusers, and the desires of other covetous
men. But poverty is not like this, but altogether the contrary. It is a
place of refuge and security, a calm harbor, a wrestling ground, and
school of exercise to learn self-command, an imitation of the life of
angels.

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p35"></span>Hear these things, as many as are poor;
or rather also, as many as desire to be rich. It is not poverty that is
the thing to be feared, but the not being willing to be poor. Account
poverty to be nothing to fear, and it will not be to thee a matter for
fear. For neither is this fear in the nature of the thing, but in the
judgment of feeble-minded men. Or rather, I am even ashamed that I have
occasion to say so much concerning poverty, to show that it is nothing
to be feared. For if thou practise self-command, it is even a fountain
to thee of countless blessings. And if any one were to offer thee
sovereignty, and political power, and wealth, and luxury, and then
having set against them poverty, were to give thee thy choice to take
which thou <span id="page_514">p. 514</span> <span
id="iii.LXXXVI-Page_514"></span> wouldest, thou wouldest straightway
seize upon poverty, if indeed thou knewest the beauty thereof.

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p36"></span>4. And I know that many laugh, when
these things are said; but we are not troubled but we require you to
stay, and soon ye will give judgment with us. For to me poverty seems
like some comely, fair, and well-favored damsel, but covetousness like
some monster shaped woman, some Scylla or Hydra, or some other like
prodigies feigned by fabulous writers.

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p37"></span>For bring not forward, I pray thee,
them that accuse poverty, but them that have shone thereby. Nurtured in
this, Elias was caught up in that blessed assumption. With this Eliseus
shone; with this John; with this all the apostles; but with the other,
Ahab, Jezebel, Gehazi, Judas, Nero, Caiaphas, were condemned.

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p38"></span>But if it please you, let us not look
to those only that have been glorious in poverty, but let us observe the
beauty itself of this damsel. For indeed her eye is clear and piercing,
having nothing turbid in it, like the eye of covetousness, which is at
one time full of anger, at another sated with pleasure, at another
troubled by incontinence. But the eye of poverty is not like this, but
mild, calm, looking kindly on all, meek, gentle, hating no man, shunning
no man. For where there are riches, there is matter for enmity, and for
countless wars. The mouth again of the other is full of insults, of a
certain haughtiness, of much boasting, cursing, deceit; but the mouth
and the tongue of this are sound, filled with continual thanksgiving,
blessing, words of gentleness, of affection, of courtesy, of praise, of
commendation. And if thou wouldest see also the proportion of her
members, she is of a goodly height, and far loftier than wealth. And if
many flee from her, marvel not at it, for indeed so do fools from the
rest of virtue.

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p39"></span>But the poor man, thou wilt say, is
insulted by him that is rich. Again thou art declaring to me the praise
of poverty. For who, I pray thee, is blessed, the insulter, or the
insulted? It is manifest that it is the insulted person. But then, the
one, covetousness, urges to insult the other; poverty persuades to
endure. “But the poor man suffers hunger,” thou wilt say. Paul also
suffered hunger, and was in famine. <span
id="fr_3168"></span>[3169](#fn_3168.md) “But he has no rest.” Neither “had
the Son of Man where to lay His head.” <span
id="fr_3169"></span>[3170](#fn_3169.md)

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p42"></span>Seest thou how far the praises of
poverty have proceeded, and where it places thee, to what men it leads
thee on, and how it makes thee a follower of the Lord? If it were good
to have gold, Christ, who have the unutterable blessings, would have
given this to His disciples. But now so far from giving it them, He
forbad them to have it. Wherefore Peter also, so far from being ashamed
of poverty, even glories in it, saying, “Silver and gold have I none;
but what I have give I thee.” <span id="fr_3170"></span>[3171](#fn_3170.md)
And who of you would not have desired to utter this saying? Nay, we all
would extremely, perhaps some one may say. Then throw away thy silver,
throw away thy gold. “And if I throw it away, thou wilt say, shall I
receive the power of Peter?” Why, what made Peter blessed, tell me? Was
it indeed to have lifted up the lame man? By no means, but the not
having these riches, this procured him Heaven. For of those that wrought
these miracles, many fell into hell, but they, who did those good
things, attained a kingdom. And this you may learn even of Peter
himself. For there were two things that he said, “Silver and gold have I
none;” and, “In the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk.”

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p44"></span>Which sort of thing then made Him
glorious and blessed, the raising up the lame man, or the casting away
his money? And this you may learn from the Master of the conflicts
Himself. What then doth He Himself say to the rich man seeking eternal
life? He said not, “raise up the lame,” but, “Sell thy goods, and give
to the poor, and come and follow me, and thou shalt have treasure in
Heaven.” <span id="fr_3171"></span>[3172](#fn_3171.md) And Peter again said
not, “Behold, in Thy name we cast out devils;” although he was casting
them out, but, “Behold, we have forsaken all and followed Thee what
shall we have?” <span id="fr_3172"></span>[3173](#fn_3172.md) And Christ
again, in answering this apostle, said not, “If any man raise up the
lame,” but, “Whosoever hath forsaken houses or lands, shall receive an
hundredfold in this world, and shall inherit everlasting life.” <span
id="fr_3173"></span>[3174](#fn_3173.md)

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p48"></span>Let us also then emulate this man, that
we may not be confounded, but may with confidence stand at the judgment
seat of Christ; that we may win Him to be with us, even as He was with
His disciples. For He will be with us, like as He was with them, if we
are willing to follow them, and to be imitators of their life and
conversation. For in consequence of these things God crowns, and
commends men, not requiring of thee to raise the dead, or to cure the
lame. For not these things make one to be like Peter, but the <span
id="page_515">p. 515</span> <span id="iii.LXXXVI-Page_515"></span>
casting away one’s goods, for this was the apostles’ achievement.

<span id="iii.LXXXVI-p49"></span>But dost thou not find it possible to
cast them away? In the first place, I say, it is possible; but I compel
thee not, if thou art not willing, nor constrain thee to it; but this I
entreat, to spend at least a part on the needy, and to seek for thyself
nothing more than is necessary. For thus shall we both live our life
here without trouble, and in security, and enjoy eternal life; unto
which God grant we all may attain, by the grace and love towards man of
our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might, together with the
Father and the Holy Ghost, now and always, and world without end. Amen.
