<span id="iii.LIII-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iii.LIII-p1.1"></span>Homily LV.</span>

<span id="iii.LIII-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.LIII-p2.1"></span>[Matt. XVI.
24](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#024.md)<span
id="iii.LIII-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="iii.LIII-p3"></span>*“Then said Jesus unto His disciples, If
any man will come after me, let him renounce himself,* <span
id="fr_2130"></span>[2131](#fn_2130.md) *and take up his cross and follow
me.”*

<span id="iii.LIII-p5"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.LIII-p5.1"></span>Then</span>; when? When Peter said, “Be it far
from Thee, this shall not be unto Thee;” and was told, “Get thee behind
me, Satan.” <span id="fr_2131"></span>[2132](#fn_2131.md) For He was by no
means satisfied with the mere rebuke, but, willing also more abundantly
to show both the extravagance of what Peter had said, and the benefit of
His passion, He saith, “Thy word to me is, “Be it far from Thee, this
shall not be unto Thee:” but my word to thee is, “Not only is it hurtful
to thee, and destructive, to hinder me and to be displeased at my
Passion, but it will be impossible for thee even to be saved, unless
thou thyself too be continually prepared for death.”

<span id="iii.LIII-p7"></span>Thus, lest they should think His suffering
unworthy of Him, not by the former things only, but also by the events
that were coming on, He teaches them the gain thereof. Thus in John
first, He saith, “Except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die,
it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit;” <span
id="fr_2132"></span>[2133](#fn_2132.md) but here more abundantly working it
out, not concerning Himself only doth He bring forward the statement
that it is meet to die, but concerning them also. “For so great is the
profit thereof, that in your case also unwillingness to die is grievous,
but to be ready for it, good.”

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span> <span id="iii.LIII-Page_325"></span>

<span id="iii.LIII-p9"></span>This however He makes clear by what
follows, but for the present He works it out on one side only. And see
how He also makes His discourse unexceptionable: not saying at all,
“whether you will, or no, you must suffer this,” but how? “If any man
will come after me.” “I force not, I compel not, but each one I make
lord of his own choice; wherefore also I say, ‘If any man will.’ For to
good things do I call you, not to things evil, or burdensome; not to
punishment and vengeance, that I should have to compel. Nay, the nature
of the thing is alone sufficient to attract you.”

<span id="iii.LIII-p10"></span>Now, thus saying, He drew them unto Him
the more. For he indeed that uses compulsion oftens turns men away, but
he that leaves the hearer to choose attracts him more. For soothing is a
mightier thing than force. Wherefore even He Himself said, “If any man
will.” “For great,” saith He, “are the good things which I give you, and
such as for men even to run to them of their own accord. For neither if
one were giving gold, and offering a treasure, would he invite with
force. And if that invitation be without compulsion, much more this, to
the good things in the Heavens. Since if the nature of the thing
persuade thee not to run, thou art not worthy to receive it at all, nor
if thou shouldest receive it, wilt thou well know what thou hast
received.”

<span id="iii.LIII-p11"></span>Wherefore Christ compels not, but urges,
sparing us. For since they seemed to be murmuring much, being secretly
disturbed at the saying, He saith, “No need of disturbance or of
trouble. If ye do not account what I have mentioned to be a cause of
innumerable blessings, even when befalling yourselves, I use no force,
nor do I compel, but if any be willing to follow, him I call.”

<span id="iii.LIII-p12"></span>“For do not by any means imagine that
this is your following of me; I mean, what ye now do attending upon me.
Ye have need of many toils, many dangers, if ye are to come after me.
For thou oughtest not, O Peter, because thou hast confessed me Son of
God, therefore only to expect crowns, and to suppose this enough for thy
salvation, and for the future to enjoy security, as having done all. For
although it be in my power, as Son of God, to hinder thee from having
any trial at all of those hardships; yet such is not my will, for thy
sake, that thou mayest thyself too contribute something, and be more
approved.”

<span id="iii.LIII-p13"></span>For so, if one were a judge at the games,
and had a friend in the lists, he would not wish to crown him by favor
only, but also for his own toils; and for this reason especially,
because he loves him. Even so Christ also; whom He most loves, those He
most of all will have to approve themselves by their own means also, and
not from His help alone.

<span id="iii.LIII-p14"></span>But see how at the same time He makes His
saying not a grievous one. For He doth by no means compass them only
with His terror, but He also puts forth the doctrine generally to the
world, saying, “If any one will,” be it woman or man, ruler or subject,
let him come this way.

<span id="iii.LIII-p15"></span>2. And though he seem to have spoken but
one single thing, yet His sayings are three, “Let him renounce himself,”
and “Let him bear his cross,” and “Let him follow me;” and two of them
are joined together, but the one is put by itself.

<span id="iii.LIII-p16"></span>But let us see first what it can be to
deny one’s self. Let us learn first what it is to deny another, and then
we shall know what it may be to deny one’s self. What then is it to deny
another? He that is denying another,—for example, either brother, or
servant, or whom you will,—should he see him either beaten, or bound, or
led to execution, or whatever he may suffer, stands not by him, doth not
help him, is not moved, feels nothing for him, as being once for all
alienated from him. Thus then He will have us disregard our own body, so
that whether men scourge, or banish, or burn, or whatever they do, we
may not spare it. For this is to spare it. Since fathers too then spare
their offspring, when committing them to teachers, they command not to
spare them.

<span id="iii.LIII-p17"></span>So also Christ; He said not, “Let him not
spare himself,” but very strictly, “Let him renounce himself;” that is,
let him have nothing to do with himself, but give himself up to all
dangers and conflicts; and let him so feel, as though another were
suffering it all.

<span id="iii.LIII-p18"></span>And He said not, “Let him deny,” <span
id="fr_2133"></span>[2134](#fn_2133.md) but “Let him renounce;” <span
id="fr_2134"></span>[2135](#fn_2134.md) even by this small addition
intimating again, how very far it goes. For this latter is more than the
former.

<span id="iii.LIII-p21"></span>“And let him take up his cross.” This
arises out of the other. For to hinder thy supposing that words, and
insults, and reproaches are to be the limits of our self-renunciation,
He saith also how far one ought to renounce one’s self; that is, unto
death, and that a reproachful death. Therefore He said not, “Let him
renounce himself unto death,” but, “Let him take up his cross;” setting
forth the reproachful death; and that not once, nor twice, but
throughout all life one ought so to do. “Yea,” saith He, “bear about
this death continually, and day by day <span id="page_326">p. 326</span>
<span id="iii.LIII-Page_326"></span> be ready for slaughter. For since
many have indeed contemned riches, and pleasure, and glory, but death
they despised not, but feared dangers; I,” saith He, “will that my
champion should wrestle even unto blood, and that the limits of his
course should reach unto slaughter; so that although one must undergo
death, death with reproach, the accursed death, and that upon evil
surmise, we are to bear all things nobly, and rather to rejoice in being
suspected.”

<span id="iii.LIII-p22"></span>“And let him follow me.” That is, it
being possible for one to suffer, yet not to follow Him, when one doth
not suffer for Him (for so robbers often suffer grievously, and
violaters of tombs, and sorcerers); to hinder thy supposing that the
mere nature of thy calamities is sufficient, He adds the occasion of
these calamities.

<span id="iii.LIII-p23"></span>And what is it? In order that, so doing
and suffering, thou mayest follow Him; that for Him thou mayest undergo
all things; that thou mayest possess the other virtues also. For this
too is expressed by “Let him follow me;” so as to show forth not
fortitude only, such as is exercised in our calamities, but temperance
also, and moderation, and all self-restraint. This being properly “to
follow,” the giving heed also to the other virtues, and for His sake
suffering all.

<span id="iii.LIII-p24"></span>For there are who follow the devil even
to the endurance of all this, and for his sake give up their own lives;
but we for Christ, or rather for our own sakes: they indeed to harm
themselves both here and there; but we, that we may gain both lives.

<span id="iii.LIII-p25"></span>How then is it not extreme dullness, not
to show forth even the same fortitude with them that perish; and this,
when we are to reap from it so many crowns? Yet with us surely Christ
Himself is present to be our help, but with them no one.

<span id="iii.LIII-p26"></span>Now He had indeed already spoken this
very injunction, when He sent them, saying, “Go not into the way of the
Gentiles” (for, saith He, “I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves,”
and, “ye shall be brought before kings and governors”) <span
id="fr_2135"></span>[2136](#fn_2135.md) but now with more intensity and
severity. For then He spake of death only, but here He hath mentioned a
cross also, and a continual cross. For “let him take up,” saith He, “his
cross;” that is, “let him carry it continually and bear it.” And this He
is wont to do in everything; not in the first instance, nor from the
beginning, but quietly and gradually, bringing in the greater
commandments, that the hearers may not count it strange.

<span id="iii.LIII-p28"></span>3. Then, because the saying seemed to be
vehement, see how He softens it by what follows, and sets down rewards
surpassing our toils; and not rewards only, but also the penalties of
vice: nay, on these last He dwells more than on those, since not so much
His bestowing blessings, as His threat of severities, is wont to bring
ordinary men to their senses. See at least how He both begins here from
this, and ends in this.

<span id="iii.LIII-p29"></span>“For whosoever will save his life shall
lose it,” saith He, “but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake,
shall find it. For what is a man profited, <span
id="fr_2136"></span>[2137](#fn_2136.md) if he should gain the whole world,
and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul
?” <span id="fr_2137"></span>[2138](#fn_2137.md)

<span id="iii.LIII-p32"></span>Now what He saith is like this: “not as
unsparing towards you, but rather as exceedingly sparing you, I enjoin
these things. For he who spares his child, ruins it; but he who spares
it not, preserves.” To which effect also a certain wise man said, “If
thou beat thy son with a rod, he shall not die, but thou shalt deliver
his soul from death.” <span id="fr_2138"></span>[2139](#fn_2138.md) And
again, “He that refresheth his son, shall bind up his wounds.” <span
id="fr_2139"></span>[2140](#fn_2139.md)

<span id="iii.LIII-p35"></span>This takes place in the camp also. For if
the general, sparing the soldiers, commands them to remain within the
place always, he will destroy with them the inhabitants too.

<span id="iii.LIII-p36"></span>“In order then that this may not happen
in your case also,” saith He, “ye must be arrayed against continual
death. For now too a grievous war is about to be kindled. Sit not
therefore within, but go forth and fight; and shouldest thou fall in thy
post, then hast thou obtained life.” For if in the visible wars he that
in his post meets slaughter, is both more distinguished than the rest,
and more invincible, and more formidable to the enemy; although we know
that after death the king, in behalf of whom he takes his station, is
not able to raise him up again: much more in these wars, when there are
such hopes of resurrection besides, will he who exposes his own life
unto death, find it; in one sense, because he will not be quickly taken;
in a second, because even though he fall, God <span
id="fr_2140"></span>[2141](#fn_2140.md) will lead his life on to a higher
life.

<span id="iii.LIII-p38"></span>4. Then, because he had said, “He who
will save shall lose it, but whosoever shall lose shall save it,” and on
that side had set salvation and destruction, and on this salva <span
id="page_327">p. 327</span> <span id="iii.LIII-Page_327"></span> tion
and destruction; to prevent any one’s imagining the one destruction and
salvation to be all the same with the other, and to teach thee plainly
that the difference between this salvation and that is as great as
between destruction and salvation; from the contraries also He makes an
inference once for all to establish these points. “For what is a man
profited,” <span id="fr_2141"></span>[2142](#fn_2141.md) saith He, “if he
gain the whole world, and lose his own soul ?”

<span id="iii.LIII-p40"></span>Seest thou how the wrongful preservation
of it is destruction, and worse than all destruction, as being even past
remedy, from the want of anything more to redeem it? For “tell me not
this,” saith He, “that he that hath escaped such dangers hath saved his
life; but together with his life put also the whole world, yet what
profit hath he thereby, if the soul perish?”

<span id="iii.LIII-p41"></span>For tell me, shouldest thou see thy
servants in luxury, and thyself in extreme calamity, wilt thou indeed
profit aught by being master? By no means. Make this reckoning then with
regard to thy soul also, when the flesh is in luxury and wealth, and she
awaiting the destruction to come.

<span id="iii.LIII-p42"></span>“What shall a man give in exchange for
his soul ?” <span id="fr_2142"></span>[2143](#fn_2142.md)

<span id="iii.LIII-p44"></span>Again, He dwells upon the same point.
What? hast thou another soul to give for this soul? saith He. Why,
shouldest thou lose money, thou wilt be able to give money; or be it
house, or slaves, or any other kind of possession, but for thy soul, if
thou lose it, thou wilt have no other soul to give: yea, though thou
hadst the world, though thou wast king of the whole earth, thou wouldest
not be able, by paying down all earthly goods, with the earth itself, to
redeem but one soul.

<span id="iii.LIII-p45"></span>And what marvel, if it be so with the
soul? Since even in the body one may see that so it turns out. Though
thou wear ten thousand diadems, but have a body sickly by nature, and
incurable, thou wilt not be able, not by giving all thy kingdom, to
recover this body, not though thou add innumerable persons, and cities,
and goods.

<span id="iii.LIII-p46"></span>Now thus I bid thee reason with regard to
thy soul also; or rather even much more with regard to the soul; and do
thou, forsaking all besides, spend all thy care upon it. Do not then
while taking thought about the things of others, neglect thyself and
thine own things; which now all men do, resembling them that work in the
mines. For neither do these receive any profit from this labor, nor from
the wealth; but rather great harm, both because they incur fruitless
peril, and incur it for other men, reaping no benefit from such their
toils and deaths. These even now are objects of imitation to many, who
are digging up wealth for others; or rather we are more wretched even
than this, inasmuch as hell itself awaits us after these our labors. For
they indeed are staid from those toils by death, but to us death proves
a beginning of innumerable evils.

<span id="iii.LIII-p47"></span>But if thou say, thou hast in thy wealth
the fruit of thy toils: show me thy soul gladdened, and then I am
persuaded. For of all things in us the soul is chief. And if the body be
fattened, while she is pining away, this prosperity is nothing to thee
(even as when the handmaiden is glad, the happiness of the maidservant
is nothing to her mistress perishing, nor is the fair robe anything
compared with the weak flesh); but Christ will say unto thee again,
“What shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?” on every hand
commanding thee to be busied about that, and to take account of it only.

<span id="iii.LIII-p48"></span>5. Having alarmed them therefore hereby,
He comforts them also by His good things.

<span id="iii.LIII-p49"></span>“For the Son of Man shall come,” saith
He, “in the glory of His Father with His holy angels, and then He shall
reward every man according to his works.” <span
id="fr_2143"></span>[2144](#fn_2143.md)

<span id="iii.LIII-p51"></span>Seest thou how the glory of the Father
and of the Son is all one? But if the glory be one, it is quite evident
that the substance also is one. For if in one substance there be a
difference of glory (“for there is one glory of the sun, and another
glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star
differeth from another star in glory;” <span
id="fr_2144"></span>[2145](#fn_2144) although the substance be one.md), how
may the substance of those differ, whereof the glory is one? For He said
not at all, “In glory such as the Father’s,” whereby thou mightest
suppose again some variation; but implying entire perfection, “In that
same glory,” saith He, “will He come;” for it to be deemed one and the
same.

<span id="iii.LIII-p53"></span>“Now, why fear, O Peter” (so He speaks),
“on being told of death? Why, then shalt thou see me in the glory of the
Father. And if I am in glory, so are ye; your interests are no wise
limited to the present life, but another sort of portion will take you
up, a better one.” Nevertheless, when He had spoken of the good things,
He stayed not at this, but mingled the fearful things also, bringing
forward that judgment-seat, and the inexorable account, and the
inflexible sentence, and the judgment that cannot be deceived.

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span> <span id="iii.LIII-Page_328"></span>

<span id="iii.LIII-p54"></span>He suffered not however His discourse to
appear only dismal, but tempered it also with good hopes. For neither
did He say, “then shall He punish them that sinned,” but, “He shall
reward every man according to his doings.” <span
id="fr_2145"></span>[2146](#fn_2145.md) And this He said, reminding not
only the sinners of punishment, but also them that have done well of
prizes and crowns.

<span id="iii.LIII-p56"></span>6. And He indeed spake it, in part to
refresh the good, but I ever shudder at hearing it, for I am not of them
that are crowned, and I suppose that others also share with us in our
fear and anxiety. For whom is this saying not enough to startle, when he
hath entered into his own conscience; and to make him shudder, and
convince him that we have need of sackcloth, and of prolonged fasting,
more than the people of the Ninevites? For not for an overthrow of a
city, and the common end, are we concerned, but for eternal punishment,
and the fire that is never quenched.

<span id="iii.LIII-p57"></span>Wherefore also I praise and admire the
monks that have occupied the desert places, as for the rest, so for this
saying. For they after having made their dinners, or rather after supper
(for dinner they know not at any time, because they know that the
present time is one of mourning and fasting); after supper then, in
saying certain hymns of thanksgiving unto God, they make mention of this
expression also. And if ye would hear the very hymns themselves, that ye
too may say them continually, I will rehearse to you the whole of that
sacred song. The words of it then stand as follows: “Blessed God, who
feedest me from my youth up, who givest food to all flesh; fill our
hearts with joy and gladness, that always having all sufficiency we may
abound unto every good work in Christ Jesus our Lord; with whom be unto
Thee glory, honor and might, with the Holy Spirit, forever. Amen. Glory
to Thee, O Lord, glory to Thee, O Holy One, glory to Thee, O King, that
Thou hast given us meat to make us glad. Fill us with the Holy Ghost,
that we may be found well-pleasing before Thee, not being ashamed, when
Thou renderest to every man according to his works.”

<span id="iii.LIII-p58"></span>Now this hymn is in all parts worthy of
admiration, but especially the above ending of it. That is, because
meals and food are wont to dissipate and weigh down, they put this
saying as a kind of bridle upon the soul, at the time of indulgence
reminding it of the time of judgment. For they have learnt what befell
Israel through a costly table. “For my beloved,” saith He, “ate, and
waxed fat, and kicked.” <span id="fr_2146"></span>[2147](#fn_2146.md)
Wherefore also Moses said, “When thou shalt have eaten and drunk and art
full, remember the Lord thy God.” <span
id="fr_2147"></span>[2148](#fn_2147.md)

<span id="iii.LIII-p61"></span>For after that feast, then they ventured
on those acts of lawless daring.

<span id="iii.LIII-p62"></span>Do thou therefore also look to it, lest
something like it befall thee. For though thou sacrifice not to stone
nor to gold, either sheep or bullocks, see lest to wrath thou sacrifice
thine own soul, lest to whoredom or other like passions, thou sacrifice
thine own salvation. Yea—on this account, you see, they being afraid of
these downfalls, when they have enjoyed their meal, or rather fasting
(for their meal is in fact fasting), remind themselves of the terrible
judgment-seat, and of that day. And if they who correct themselves both
with fasting, and with nights spent on the ground, with watchings, and
with sackcloth, and with ten thousand means, do yet require also this
reminding, when will it be possible for us to live virtuously; who set
forth tables loaded with innumerable wrecks, and do not so much as pray
at all, neither in the beginning nor the end ?

<span id="iii.LIII-p63"></span>7. Wherefore to put an end to these
shipwrecks, let us bring before us that hymn and unfold it all, that
seeing the profit thereof, we too may chant it constantly over our
table, and quell the rude motions of the belly, introducing both the
manners and laws of those angels into our houses. For you ought indeed
to go there and reap these fruits; but since ye are not willing, at
least through our words, hear this spiritual melody, and let every one
after his meal say these words, beginning thus.

<span id="iii.LIII-p64"></span>“Blessed God.” For the apostolic law they
straightway fulfill, that commands, “Whatsoever we do in word or in
deed, that we do it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks
to God and the Father by Him.” <span
id="fr_2148"></span>[2149](#fn_2148.md)

<span id="iii.LIII-p66"></span>Next, the thanksgiving takes place not
for that one day only, but for all their life. For, “Who feedest me,” it
is said, “from my youth up.” And a lesson of self-command is drawn
thence, that when God feeds, we must not take thought. For if upon a
king’s promising thee to furnish thy daily food out of his own stores,
thou wouldest be of good hope for the future; much more, when God gives,
and all things pour upon thee as out of fountains, shouldest thou be
freed from all anxiety. Yea, and to this very intent they so speak, that
they may persuade <span id="page_329">p. 329</span> <span
id="iii.LIII-Page_329"></span> both themselves, and those that are made
disciples by them, to put off all worldly care.

<span id="iii.LIII-p67"></span>Then, not to have thee suppose that for
themselves only they offer up this thanksgiving, they further say, “Who
givest food to all flesh,” giving thanks in behalf of all the world; and
as fathers of the whole earth, so do they offer up their praises for
all, and train themselves to a sincere brotherly love. For it is not
even possible they should hate them, in behalf of whom they thank God,
that they are fed.

<span id="iii.LIII-p68"></span>Seest thou both charity introduced by
their thanksgiving, and worldly care cast out, both by the preceding
words, and by these? For if He feed all flesh, much more them that are
devoted to him; if them that are entangled in worldly cares, much more
them that are freed from the same.

<span id="iii.LIII-p69"></span>To establish this, Christ Himself said,
“How many sparrows do ye exceed in value?” <span
id="fr_2149"></span>[2150](#fn_2149.md) And He said it, teaching them not
to put their confidence in wealth and land and seeds; for it is not
these that feed us, but the word of God. <span
id="fr_2150"></span>[2151](#fn_2150.md)

<span id="iii.LIII-p72"></span>Hereby they stop the mouths, both of the
Manichæans, and of them of Valentinus, and of all that are diseased in
their way. For sure this Being is not evil, who sets his own stores
before all, even before them that blaspheme Him.

<span id="iii.LIII-p73"></span>Then comes the petition: “Fill our hearts
with joy and gladness.” With what manner of joy then, doth it mean? the
joy of this world? God forbid: for had they meant this, they would not
have occupied summits of mountains, and deserts, nor wrapt themselves in
sackcloth; but that joy they mean, which hath nothing in common with
this present life, the joy of angels, the joy above.

<span id="iii.LIII-p74"></span>And they do not simply ask for it, but in
great excess; for they say not, “give,” but, “fill,” and they say not
“us,” but “our hearts.” For this is especially a heart’s joy; “For the
fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace.” <span
id="fr_2151"></span>[2152](#fn_2151.md)

<span id="iii.LIII-p76"></span>Thus, because sin brought in sorrow, they
request that through joy righteousness may be implanted in them, for no
otherwise might joy be engendered.

<span id="iii.LIII-p77"></span>“That, always having all sufficiency, we
may abound unto every good work.” <span
id="fr_2152"></span>[2153](#fn_2152.md) See how they fulfill that word of
the gospel which saith, “Give us this day our daily bread,” and how they
seek even this for spiritual ends. For their phrase is, “That we may
abound unto every good work.” They said not, “That we may do our duty
only,” but “even more than what is enjoined,” for, “that we may abound,”
means this. And while of God they seek sufficiency in things needful,
themselves are willing to obey not in sufficiency only, but with much
abundance, and in all things. This is the part of well-disposed
servants, this of men strict in goodness, to abound always, and in all
things.

<span id="iii.LIII-p79"></span>Then again reminding themselves of their
own weakness, and that without the influence from above nothing noble
can be done; having said, “that we may abound unto every good work,”
they add, “in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom unto Thee be glory,
honor, and might forever. Amen;” framing this end like their
commencement by a thread of thanksgiving.

<span id="iii.LIII-p80"></span>8. After this again, they seem to begin
afresh, but they are keeping to the same argument. As Paul also in the
beginning of an epistle, having closed with a doxology, where he says,
“According to the will of our God and Father, to whom be glory forever.
Amen;” <span id="fr_2153"></span>[2154](#fn_2153.md) begins the subject
again on which he was writing. And again in another place when he had
said, “They worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator,
who is blessed forever: Amen;” <span
id="fr_2154"></span>[2155](#fn_2154.md) he completed not his discourse, but
begins again.

<span id="iii.LIII-p83"></span>Therefore neither let us blame these our
angels, as acting disorderly, for that having closed with a doxology
they begin again the sacred hymns. For they follow apostolical laws,
beginning from a doxology, and ending therein, and after that end making
a commencement again.

<span id="iii.LIII-p84"></span>Wherefore they say, “Glory be to Thee, O
Lord; glory be to Thee, O Holy One; glory be to Thee, O King; that Thou
hast given us food to make us glad.”

<span id="iii.LIII-p85"></span>Since not for the greater things only,
but also for the lesser, we ought to give thanks. And they do give
thanks for these also, putting to shame the heresy of the Manichæans,
and of as many as affirm our present life to be evil. For lest for their
high self-command, and contempt of the belly, thou shouldest suspect
them as abhorring the meat, like the heretics aforesaid, who choke
themselves <span id="fr_2155"></span>[2156](#fn_2155.md) to death; they by
their prayer teach thee, that not from abhorrence of God’s creatures
they abstain from most of them, but as exercising self-restraint.

<span id="iii.LIII-p87"></span>And see how after thanksgiving for His
past gifts, they are importunate also for the greater things, and dwell
not upon the mat <span id="page_330">p. 330</span> <span
id="iii.LIII-Page_330"></span> ters of this life, but mount above the
heavens, and say, “Fill us with the Holy Ghost.” For it is not even
possible to approve one’s self as one ought, not being filled with that
grace; as there is no doing anything noble or great, without the benefit
of Christ’s influences.

<span id="iii.LIII-p88"></span>As therefore when they had said, “That we
may abound unto every good work,” they added, “In Christ Jesus;” so here
also they say, “Fill us with the Holy Ghost, that we may be found to
have been well-pleasing before Thee.” <span
id="fr_2156"></span>[2157](#fn_2156.md)

<span id="iii.LIII-p90"></span>Seest thou how for the things of this
life they pray not, but give thanks only; but for the things of the
Spirit, they both give thanks and pray. For, “seek ye,” saith He, “the
kingdom of heaven, and all these things shall be added unto you.” <span
id="fr_2157"></span>[2158](#fn_2157.md)

<span id="iii.LIII-p92"></span>And mark too another kind of severe
goodness in them; their saying, namely, “That we may be found to have
been well-pleasing in Thy sight, not being ashamed.” For “we care not,”
say they, “for the shame that proceeds from the many, but whatever men
may say of us, laughing, upbraiding, we do not so much as regard it; but
our whole endeavor is not to be put to shame then.” But in these
expressions, they bring in also the river of fire, and the prizes, and
the rewards.

<span id="iii.LIII-p93"></span>They said not, “that we be not punished,”
but, “that we be not ashamed.” <span
id="fr_2158"></span>[2159](#fn_2158.md) For this is to us far more fearful
than hell, to seem to have offended our Lord.

<span id="iii.LIII-p95"></span>But since the more part and the grosser
sort are not in fear of this, they add, “When Thou renderest to every
man according to his works.” Seest thou how greatly these strangers and
pilgrims have benefitted us, these citizens of the wilderness, or rather
citizens of the Heavens? For whereas we are strangers to the Heavens,
but citizens of the earth, these are just the contrary.

<span id="iii.LIII-p96"></span>And after this hymn, being filled with
much compunction, and with many and fervent tears, so they proceed to
sleep, snatching just so much of it as a little to refresh themselves.
And again, the nights they make days, spending them in thanksgivings and
in the singing of psalms.

<span id="iii.LIII-p97"></span>But not men only, but women also practise
this self-denial, overcoming the weakness of their nature by the
abundance of their zeal.

<span id="iii.LIII-p98"></span>Let us be abashed then at their
earnestness, we who are men, let us cease to be fastened to the things
present, to shadow, to dreams, to smoke. For the more part of our life
is passed in insensibility.

<span id="iii.LIII-p99"></span>For both the first period of our life is
full of much folly, and that again which travels on to old age, makes
all the feeling that is in us wither away, and small is the space
between, that is able feelingly to enjoy pleasure; or rather, not even
that hath a pure participation thereof, by reason of innumerable cares
and toils, that harrass it.

<span id="iii.LIII-p100"></span>Wherefore, I pray, let us seek the
unmovable and eternal goods, and the life that never has old age.

<span id="iii.LIII-p101"></span>For even one dwelling in a city may
imitate the self-denial of the monks; yea, one who has a wife, and is
busied in a household, may pray, and fast, and learn compunction. Since
they also, who at the first were instructed by the apostles, though they
dwelt in cities, yet showed forth the piety of the occupiers of the
deserts: and others again who had to rule over workshops, as Priscilla
and Aquila.

<span id="iii.LIII-p102"></span>And the prophets too, all had both wives
and households, as Isaiah, as Ezekiel, as the great Moses, and received
no hurt therefrom in regard of virtue.

<span id="iii.LIII-p103"></span>These then let us also imitate, and
continually offer thanksgiving to God, continually sing hymns to Him;
let us give heed to temperance, and to all other virtues, and the
self-denial that is practised in the deserts, let us bring into our
cities; that we may appear both well-pleasing before God, and approved
before men, and attain unto the good things to come, by the grace and
love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom and with whom be
unto the Father, glory, honor, and might, together with the holy and
life-giving Spirit, now and always and world without end. Amen. <span

corda nostra, ut nos affatim quod satis est habentes, abundemus ad omne
opus bonum: Per Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum*: Amen.” The conclusion
of St. Chrysostom’s grace seems to be referred to by St. Just Mart.
