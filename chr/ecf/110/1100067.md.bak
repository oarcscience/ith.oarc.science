<span id="iii.LIX-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iii.LIX-p1.1"></span>Homily LXII.</span>

<span id="iii.LIX-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.LIX-p2.1"></span>[Matt. XIX.
1](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.LIX-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="iii.LIX-p3"></span>“And it came to pass, that when Jesus had
finished these sayings, He departed from Galilee, and came into the
coasts of Judæa beyond Jordan.”

<span id="iii.LIX-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.LIX-p4.1"></span>Having</span> constantly left Judæa on account
of the envy of those men, now He frequents it from this time forth,
because the passion was to be nigh at hand; He goeth not up, however,
unto Jerusalem for a while, but “into the coasts of Judæa.”

<span id="iii.LIX-p5"></span>“And,” when He was come, “great multitudes
followed Him, and He healed them.” <span
id="fr_2375"></span>[2376](#fn_2375.md)

<span id="iii.LIX-p7"></span>For neither in the teaching by words doth
He continue always, nor in the wonderful working of signs, but He doeth
now one now the other, variously working the salvation of them that were
waiting upon Him and following Him, so as by the miracles to appear, in
what He said, a Teacher worthy of belief, and by the teaching of His
word to increase the profit from the miracles; and this was to lead them
by the hand to the knowledge of God.

<span id="iii.LIX-p8"></span>But do thou mark, I pray thee, this too,
how the disciples pass over whole multitudes with one word, not
declaring by name each of them that are healed. For they said not, that
such a one, and such another, but that many, teaching us to be
unostentatious. But Christ healed, benefiting both them, and by them
many others. For the healing of these men’s infirmity was to others a
foundation for the knowledge of God.

<span id="iii.LIX-p9"></span>But not so to the Pharisees, but even for
this self-same thing they become more fierce, and come unto Him tempting
Him. For because they could not lay hold of the works that were doing,
they propose to Him questions. For they “came unto Him, and tempting Him
said, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every
cause?” <span id="fr_2376"></span>[2377](#fn_2376.md)

<span id="iii.LIX-p11"></span>O folly! They thought to silence Him by
their questions, although they had already received certain proof of
this power in Him. When at least they argued much about the Sabbath,
when they said, “He blasphemeth,” when they said, “He hath a devil,”
when they found fault with His disciples as they were walking in the
corn fields, when they argued about unwashen hands, on every occasion
having sewed fast their mouths, and shut up their shameless tongue, He
thus sent them away. Nevertheless, not even so do they keep off from
Him. For such is wickedness, such is envy, shameless and bold; though it
be put to silence ten thousand times, ten thousand times doth it assault
again.

<span id="iii.LIX-p12"></span>But mark thou, I pray thee, their craft
also from the form of their question. For neither did they say unto Him,
Thou didst command not to put away a wife, for indeed He had already
discoursed about this law; but never <span id="page_364">p. 364</span>
<span id="iii.LIX-Page_364"></span> theless they made no mention of
those words; but took occasion from hence, and thinking to make their
snare the greater, and being minded to drive Him to a necessity of
contradicting the law, they say not, why didst Thou enact this or that?
but as though nothing had been said, they ask, “Is it lawful?” expecting
that He had forgotten having said it; and being ready if on the one hand
He said, “It is lawful to put away,” to bring against Him the things He
Himself had spoken, and to say, How then didst Thou affirm the contrary?
but if the same things now again as before, to bring against Him the
words of Moses.

<span id="iii.LIX-p13"></span>What then said He? He said not,” tempt ye
me, ye hypocrites?” although afterwards He saith this, but here He
speaks not thus. Why can this be? In order that together with His power
He might show forth His gentleness also. For He doth neither always keep
silence, lest they should suppose they are hidden; nor doth He always
reprove, in order that He may instruct us to bear all things with
gentleness.

<span id="iii.LIX-p14"></span>How then doth He answer them? “Have ye not
read, that He which made them at <span
id="fr_2377"></span>[2378](#fn_2377.md) the beginning, made them male and
female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and his
mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they twain shall be <span
id="fr_2378"></span>[2379](#fn_2378.md) one flesh? So that they are no more
twain but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not
man put asunder.” <span id="fr_2379"></span>[2380](#fn_2379.md)

<span id="iii.LIX-p18"></span>See a teacher’s wisdom. I mean, that being
asked, Is it lawful? He did not at once say, It is not lawful, lest they
should be disturbed and put in disorder, but before the decision by His
argument He rendered this manifest, showing that it is itself too the
commandment of His Father, and that not in opposition to Moses did He
enjoin these things, but in full agreement with him.

<span id="iii.LIX-p19"></span>But mark Him arguing strongly not from the
creation only, but also from His command. For He said not, that He made
one man and one woman only, but that He also gave this command that the
one man should be joined to the one woman. But if it had been His will
that he should put this one away, and bring in another, when He had made
one man, He would have formed many women.

<span id="iii.LIX-p20"></span>But now both by the manner of the
creation, and by the manner of lawgiving, He showed that one man must
dwell with one woman continually, and never break off from her.

<span id="iii.LIX-p21"></span>And see how He saith, “He which made them
at the beginning, made them male and female,” that is, from one root
they sprung, and into one body came they together, “for the twain shall
be one flesh.”

<span id="iii.LIX-p22"></span>After this, to make it a fearful thing to
find fault with this lawgiving, and to confirm the law, He said not,
“Sever not therefore, nor put asunder,” but, “What God hath joined
together, let not man put asunder.”

<span id="iii.LIX-p23"></span>But if thou put forward Moses, I tell thee
of Moses’ Lord, and together with this, I rely upon the time also. For
God at the beginning made them male and female; and this law is older
(though it seem to have been now introduced by me), and with much
earnestness established. For not merely did He bring the woman to the
man, but also commanded to leave father and mother. And neither did He
make it a law for him merely to come to the woman, but also “to cleave
to her,” by the form of the language intimating that they might not be
severed. And not even with this was He satisfied, but sought also for
another greater union, “for the twain,” He saith, “shall be one flesh.”

<span id="iii.LIX-p24"></span>Then after He had recited the ancient law,
which was brought in both by deeds and by words, and shown it to be
worthy of respect because of the giver, with authority after that He
Himself too interprets and gives the law, saying, “So that they are no
more twain, but one flesh.” Like then as to sever flesh is a horrible
thing, <span id="fr_2380"></span>[2381](#fn_2380.md) so also to divorce a
wife is unlawful. And He stayed not at this, but brought in God also by
saying, “What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put
asunder,” showing that the act was both against nature, and against law;
against nature, because one flesh is dissevered; against law, because
that when God hath joined and commanded it not to be divided, ye
conspire to do this.

<span id="iii.LIX-p26"></span>2. What then ought they to have done after
this? Ought they not to have held their peace, and to have commended the
saying? ought they not to have marvelled at His wisdom? ought they not
to have stood amazed at His accordance with the Father? But none of
these things do they, but as though they were contending for *the law*,
they say, “How then did Moses command to give a writing of divorcement,
and to put her away?” <span id="fr_2381"></span>[2382](#fn_2381.md) And yet
they ought not now to have brought this forward, but rather He to them;
but nevertheless He doth not take advantage of them, nor doth He say to
them, “I am not now bound by this,” but He solves this too.

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span> <span id="iii.LIX-Page_365"></span>

<span id="iii.LIX-p28"></span>And indeed if He had been an alien from
the old covenant, He would not have striven for Moses, neither would He
have argued positively from the things done once for all at the
beginning; He would not have studied to show that His own precepts
agreed with those of old.

<span id="iii.LIX-p29"></span>And indeed Moses had given many other
commandments besides, both those about meats, and those about the
Sabbath; wherefore then do they nowhere bring him forward, as here? From
a wish to enlist the multitude of the husbands against him. For this was
considered a thing indifferent with the Jews, and all used to do so much
as this. Accordingly it was for this reason that when so many things had
been said on the mount, they remembered this commandment only now.

<span id="iii.LIX-p30"></span>Nevertheless, unspeakable wisdom maketh a
defense even for these things, and saith, “Moses for the hardness of
your hearts” thus made the law. And not even him doth He suffer to
remain under accusation, forasmuch as He had Himself given him the law;
but delivers him from the charge, and turns the whole upon their head,
as everywhere He doth.

<span id="iii.LIX-p31"></span>For again when they were blaming His
disciples for plucking the ears of corn, He shows themselves to be
guilty; and when they were laying a transgression to their charge as to
their not washing their hands, He shows themselves to be the
transgressors, and touching the Sabbath also: both everywhere, and here
in like manner.

<span id="iii.LIX-p32"></span>Then because the saying was hard to bear,
and brought on them much blame, He quickly directs back His discourse to
that ancient law, saying as He had said before also, “But in the
beginning it was not so,” that is, God by His acts at the beginning
ordained the contrary. For in order that they may not say, Whence is it
manifest, that “for our hardness Moses said this?” hereby again He
stoppeth their mouths. For if this were the primary law, and for our
good, that other would not have been given at the beginning; God in
creating would not have so created, He would not have said such things.

<span id="iii.LIX-p33"></span>“But I say unto you, Whosoever shall put
away his wife except it be for fornication, and marry another,
committeth adultery.” <span id="fr_2382"></span>[2383](#fn_2382.md) For
since he had stopped their mouths, He then gives the law with His own
authority, like as touching the meats, like as touching the Sabbath.

<span id="iii.LIX-p35"></span>For with regard to the meats likewise,
when He had overcome them, then, and not till then, He declared unto the
multitude, that, “Not that which goeth in defileth the man;” <span
id="fr_2383"></span>[2384](#fn_2383.md) and with regard to the Sabbath,
when He had stopped their mouths, He saith, “Wherefore it is lawful to
do well on the Sabbath day;” <span id="fr_2384"></span>[2385](#fn_2384.md)
and here this self-same thing.

<span id="iii.LIX-p38"></span>But what took place there, this happened
here also. For as there, when the Jews had been put to silence the
disciples were troubled, and came unto Him with Peter and said, “Declare
unto us this parable;” <span id="fr_2385"></span>[2386](#fn_2385.md) even
so now also they were troubled and said, “If the case of the man be so,
it is good not to marry.” <span id="fr_2386"></span>[2387](#fn_2386.md)

<span id="iii.LIX-p41"></span>For now they understood the saying more
than before. Therefore then indeed they held their peace, but now when
there hath been gainsaying, and answering, and question, and learning by
reply, and the law appeared more clear, they ask Him. And openly to
contradict they do not dare, but they bring forward what seemed to be a
grievous and galling result of it, saying, “If the case of the man be so
with his wife, it is not good to marry.” For indeed it seemed to be a
very hard thing to have a wife full of every bad quality, and to endure
a wild beast perpetually shut up with one in the house. And that thou
mayest learn that this greatly troubled them, Mark said, <span
id="fr_2387"></span>[2388](#fn_2387.md) to show it, that they spake to Him
privately.

<span id="iii.LIX-p43"></span>3. But what is, “If such be the case of a
man with his wife?” That is, if to this end he is joined with her, that
they should be one, or, on the other hand, if the man shall get to
himself blame for these things, and always transgresses by putting away,
it were easier to fight against natural desire and against one’s self,
than against a wicked woman.

<span id="iii.LIX-p44"></span>What then saith Christ? He said not, “yea,
it is easier, and so do,” lest they should suppose that the thing is a
law; but He subjoined, “Not all men receive it, but they to whom it is
given,” <span id="fr_2388"></span>[2389](#fn_2388.md) raising the thing,
and showing that it is great, and in this way drawing them on, and
urging them.

<span id="iii.LIX-p46"></span>But see herein a contradiction. For He
indeed saith this is a great thing; but they, that it is easier. For it
was meet that both these things should be done, and that it should be at
once acknowledged a great thing by Him, that it might render them more
forward, and by the things said by themselves it should be shown to be
easier, that on this ground too they might the rather choose virginity
and continence. For since to speak of <span id="page_366">p. 366</span>
<span id="iii.LIX-Page_366"></span> virginity seemed to be grievous, by
the constraint of this law He drove them to this desire. Then to show
the possibility of it, He saith, “There are some eunuchs, who were so
born from their mother’s womb, there are some eunuchs which were made
eunuchs of men, and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs
for the kingdom of Heaven’s sake,” <span
id="fr_2389"></span>[2390](#fn_2389.md) by these words secretly leading
them to choose the thing, and establishing the possibility of this
virtue, and all but saying, Consider if thou wert in such case by
nature, or hadst endured this selfsame thing at the hands of those who
inflict such wanton injuries, what wouldest thou have done, being
deprived indeed of the enjoyment, yet not having a reward? Thank God
therefore now, for that with rewards and crowns thou undergoest this,
which those men endure without crowns; or rather not even this, but what
is much lighter, being supported both by hope, and by the consciousness
of the good work, and not having the desire so raging like waves within
thee.

<span id="iii.LIX-p48"></span>For the excision of a member is not able
to quell such waves, and to make a calm, like the curb of reason; or
rather, reason only can do this.

<span id="iii.LIX-p49"></span>For this intent therefore He brought in
those others, even that He might encourage these, since if this was not
what He was establishing, what means His saying concerning the other
eunuchs? But when He saith, that they made themselves eunuchs, He means
not the excision of the members, far from it, but the putting away of
wicked thoughts. Since the man who hath mutilated himself, in fact, is
subject even to a curse, as Paul saith, “I would they were even cut
off <span id="fr_2390"></span>[2391](#fn_2390.md) which trouble you.” <span
id="fr_2391"></span>[2392](#fn_2391.md) And very reasonably. For such a one
is venturing on the deeds of murderers, and giving occasion to them that
slander God’s creation, and opens the mouths of the Manichæans, and is
guilty of the same unlawful acts as they that mutilate themselves
amongst the Greeks. For to cut off our members hath been from the
beginning a work of demoniacal agency, and satanic device, that they may
bring up a bad report upon the work of God, that they may mar this
living creature, that imputing all not to the choice, but to the nature
of our members, the more part of them may sin in security, as being
irresponsible; and doubly harm this living creature, both by mutilating
the members, and by impeding the forwardness of the free choice in
behalf of good deeds.

<span id="iii.LIX-p52"></span>These are the ordinances of the devil,
bringing in, besides the things which we have mentioned, another wicked
doctrine also, and making way beforehand for the arguments concerning
destiny and necessity even from hence, and everywhere marring the
freedom given to us of God, and persuading us that evil deeds are of
nature, and hence secretly implanting many other wicked doctrines,
although not openly. For such are the devil’s poisons.

<span id="iii.LIX-p53"></span>Therefore I beseech you to flee from such
lawlessness. For together with the things I have mentioned, neither doth
the force of lust become milder hereby, but even more fierce. For from
another origin hath the seed that is in us its sources, and from another
cause do its waves swell. And some say from the brain, some from the
loins, this violent impulse hath its birth; but I should say from
nothing else than from an ungoverned will and a neglected mind: if this
be temperate, there is no evil result from the motions of nature.

<span id="iii.LIX-p54"></span>Having spoken then of the eunuchs that are
eunuchs for nought and fruitlessly, unless with the mind they too
practise temperance, and of those that are virgins for Heaven’s sake, He
proceeds again to say, “He that is able to receive it, let him receive
it,” at once making them more earnest by showing that the good work is
exceeding in greatness, and not suffering the thing to be shut up in the
compulsion of a law, because of His unspeakable gentleness. And this He
said, when He showed it to be most possible, in order that the emulation
of the free choice might be greater.

<span id="iii.LIX-p55"></span>And if it is of free choice, one may say,
how doth He say, at the beginning, “All men do not receive it, but they
to whom it is given?” That thou mightest learn that the conflict is
great, not that thou shouldest suspect any compulsory allotments. For it
is given to those, even to the willing.

<span id="iii.LIX-p56"></span>But He spake thus to show that much
influence from above is needed by him who entereth these lists, whereof
He that is willing shall surely partake. For it is customary for Him to
use this form of speech when the good work done is great, as when He
saith, “To you it is given to know the mysteries.”

<span id="iii.LIX-p57"></span>And that this is true, is manifest even
from the present instance. For if it be of the gift from above only, and
they that live as virgins contribute nothing themselves, for nought did
He promise them the kingdom of Heaven, and distinguish them from the
other eunuchs.

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span> <span id="iii.LIX-Page_367"></span>

<span id="iii.LIX-p58"></span>But mark thou, I pray, how from some men’s
wicked doings, other men gain. I mean, that the Jews went away having
learnt nothing, for neither did they ask with the intent of learning,
but the disciples gained even from hence.

<span id="iii.LIX-p59"></span>4. “Then were there brought unto Him
little children, that He should put His hands on them, and pray: and the
disciples rebuked them. But He said unto them, Suffer the little
children to come unto me, for of such is the kingdom of Heaven. And He
laid His hands on them, and departed thence.” <span
id="fr_2392"></span>[2393](#fn_2392.md)

<span id="iii.LIX-p61"></span>And wherefore did the disciples repel the
little children? For dignity. What then doth He? Teaching them to be
lowly, and to trample under foot worldly pride, He doth receive them,
and takes them in His arms, and to such as them promises the kingdom;
which kind of thing He said before also. <span
id="fr_2393"></span>[2394](#fn_2393.md)

<span id="iii.LIX-p63"></span>Let us also then, if we would be
inheritors of the Heavens, possess ourselves of this virtue with much
diligence. For this is the limit of true wisdom; to be simple with
understanding; this is angelic life; yes, for the soul of a little child
is pure from all the passions. Towards them who have vexed him he bears
no resentment, but goes to them as to friends, as if nothing had been
done; and how much soever he be beaten by his mother; after her he
seeks, and her doth he prefer to all. Though thou show him the queen
with a diadem, he prefers her not to his mother clad in rags, but would
choose rather to see her in these, than the queen in splendor. For he
useth to distinguish what pertains to him and what is strange to him,
not by its poverty and wealth, but by friendship. And nothing more than
necessary things doth he seek, but just to be satisfied from the breast,
and then he leaves sucking. The young child is not grieved at what we
are grieved, as at loss of money and such things as that, and he doth
not rejoice again at what we rejoice, namely, at these temporal things,
he is not eager about the beauty of persons.

<span id="iii.LIX-p64"></span>Therefore He said, “of such is the kingdom
of Heaven,” that by choice we should practise these things, which young
children have by nature. For since the Pharisees from nothing else so
much as out of craft and pride did what they did, therefore on every
hand He charges the disciples to be single hearted, both darkly hinting
at those men, and instructing these. For nothing so much lifts up unto
haughtiness, as power and precedence. Forasmuch then as the disciples
were to enjoy great honors throughout the whole world, He preoccupies
their mind, not suffering them to feel anything after the manner of men,
neither to demand honors from the multitude, nor to have men clear the
way <span id="fr_2394"></span>[2395](#fn_2394.md) before them.

<span id="iii.LIX-p66"></span>For though these seem to be little things,
yet are they a cause of great evils. The Pharisees at least being thus
trained were carried on into the very summit of evil, seeking after the
salutations, the first seats, the middle places, <span
id="fr_2395"></span>[2396](#fn_2395.md) for from these they were cast upon
the shoal of their mad desire of glory, then from thence upon impiety.
So therefore those men went away having drawn upon themselves a curse by
their tempting, but the little children a blessing, as being freed from
all these.

<span id="iii.LIX-p68"></span>Let us then also be like the little
children, and “in malice be we babes.” <span
id="fr_2396"></span>[2397](#fn_2396.md) For it cannot be, it cannot be for
one otherwise to see Heaven, but the crafty and wicked must needs surely
be cast into hell.

<span id="iii.LIX-p70"></span>5. And before hell too, we shall here
suffer the utmost ills. “For if thou be evil,” it is said, “thou alone
shalt endure the evil; but if good, it is for thyself and for thy
neighbor.” <span id="fr_2397"></span>[2398](#fn_2397.md) Mark, at any rate,
how this took place in the former instances also. For neither was
anything more wicked than Saul, nor more simple and single-hearted than
David. Which therefore was the stronger? Did not David get him twice
into his hands, and having the power to slay him, forebore? Had he not
him shut up as in a net and prison, and spared him? And this when both
others were urging him, and when he himself was able to accuse him of
countless charges; but nevertheless he suffered him to go away safe. And
yet the other was pursuing him with all his army, but he was, with a few
desperate fugitives, wandering and changing from place to place;
nevertheless the fugitive had the advantage of the king, forasmuch as
the one came to the conflict with simplicity, the other with wickedness.

<span id="iii.LIX-p72"></span>For what could be more wicked than that
man, who when he was leading his armies, and bringing all his wars to a
successful issue, and undergoing the labors of the victory and the
trophies, but bringing the crowns to him, assayed to slay him?

<span id="iii.LIX-p73"></span>6. Such is the nature of envy, it is ever
plotting against its own honors, and wasting him that hath it, and
encompassing him with countless calamities. And that miserable man, for
instance, until David departed, burst not forth into that piteous cry,
bewail <span id="page_368">p. 368</span> <span
id="iii.LIX-Page_368"></span> ing himself and saying, “I am sore
distressed, and the Philistines make war against me, and the Lord is
departed from me.” <span id="fr_2398"></span>[2399](#fn_2398.md) Until he
was separated from David, he fell not in war, but was both in safety and
in glory; for indeed unto the king passed the glory of the captain. For
neither was the man disposed to usurpation, nor did he assay to depose
the other from his throne, but for him did he achieve all things, and
was earnestly attached to him, and this is evident even from what
followed afterwards. For when indeed he was set under him, any one of
them who do not search carefully might perhaps suppose these things to
be by the usual custom of a subject; but after he had withdrawn himself
out of Saul’s kingdom, what then was there to restrain him, and to him
even to slay? Had not the other been evil towards him once, twice, and
often? Was it not after having received benefits from him? Was it not
having nothing whereof to accuse him? Was not Saul’s kingdom and safety
danger and insecurity to himself? must he not needs wander and be a
fugitive, and be in trembling for fear of the utmost ills, while the
other is alive, and reigning? Nevertheless none of these things
constrained him to stain his sword with blood, but when he saw him
asleep, and bound, and alone, and in the midst of his own men, and had
touched his head, and when there were many rousing him to it, and saying
the opportunity thus favorable was a judgment of God, he at once rebuked
those who were urging him on, and refrained from the murder, and sent
him away both safe and well; and as though he had been rather a body
guard of his, and a shield-bearer, not an enemy, so did he chide the
host for their treachery towards the king. <span
id="fr_2399"></span>[2400](#fn_2399.md)

<span id="iii.LIX-p76"></span>What could be equal to this soul? What to
that mildness? For this it is possible to see even by the things that
have been mentioned but much more by what are done now. For when we have
considered our vileness, then we shall know more perfectly the virtue of
those saints. Wherefore I entreat you to hasten towards the emulation of
them.

<span id="iii.LIX-p77"></span>For indeed if thou lovest glory, and for
this cause art plotting against thy neighbor, then shalt thou enjoy it
more largely, when having spurned it, thou wilt abstain from the
plotting. For like as to become rich <span
id="fr_2400"></span>[2401](#fn_2400.md) is contrary to covetousness, so is
the loving of glory to the obtaining of glory. And if ye be minded, let
us inquire into each. For since we have no fear of hell, nor much regard
for the kingdom, come and even from the things present let us lead you
on.

<span id="iii.LIX-p79"></span>For who are they that are ridiculous? Tell
me. Is it not they that are doing anything for the sake of glory from
the multitude? And who are the objects of praise? Is it not they who
spurn the praise of the multitude? Therefore if the love of vainglory be
matter of reproach, and it cannot be concealed that the vainglorious man
loves it, he will assuredly be an object of reproach, and the love of
glory is become to him a cause of dishonor. And not in this respect only
doth he disgrace himself, but also in that he is compelled to do many
things shameful, and teeming with the utmost disgrace. And like as with
respect to their gains men are wont to suffer harm more than anything
from the disease of covetousness (they become at least the subjects of
many tricks, and of small gains make great losses, wherefore this saying
hath prevailed even to be a proverb); and as to the voluptuous man
likewise, his passion becomes a hindrance to the enjoyment of his
pleasure. These at least that are exceedingly given up thereto, and are
the slaves of women these above all do women carry about as servants,
and will never vouchsafe to treat them as men, buffeting, spurning them,
leading, and taking them about everywhere, and giving themselves airs,
and in everything merely giving them orders.

<span id="iii.LIX-p80"></span>Even so also than him that is arrogant and
mad about glory, and accounts himself to be high, nothing is more base
and dishonored. For the race of man is fond of contention, and against
nothing else doth it set itself so much, as against a boaster, and a
contemptuous man, and a slave of glory.

<span id="iii.LIX-p81"></span>And he himself too, in order to maintain
the fashion of his pride, exhibits the conduct of a slave to the common
sort, flattering, courting them, serving a servitude more grievous than
that of one bought for money.

<span id="iii.LIX-p82"></span>Knowing then all these things, let us lay
down these passions, that we may not both pay a penalty here, and there
be punished without end. Let us become lovers of virtue. For so both
before reaching the kingdom we shall reap the greatest benefits here,
and when we are departed thither we shall partake of the eternal
blessings; unto which God grant we may all attain by the grace and love
towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might world
without end. Amen.
