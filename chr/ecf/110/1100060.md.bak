<span id="iii.LII-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iii.LII-p1.1"></span>Homily LII.</span>

<span id="iii.LII-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.LII-p2.1"></span>[Matt. 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#021.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#022.md)<span
id="iii.LII-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="iii.LII-p3"></span>*“And Jesus went thence, and departed into
the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of
the same coasts, and cried unto Him,* <span
id="fr_2017"></span>[2018](#fn_2017.md) *saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord,
Thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.”*

<span id="iii.LII-p5"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.LII-p5.1"></span>But</span> Mark saith, that “He could not be
hid,” <span id="fr_2018"></span>[2019](#fn_2018.md) though He had entered
into the house. And why did He go at all into these parts? When He had
set them free from the observance of meats, then to the Gentiles also He
goes on to open a door, proceeding in due course; even as Peter, having
been first directed to annul this law, is sent to Cornelius. <span
id="fr_2019"></span>[2020](#fn_2019.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p8"></span>But if any one should say, “How then, while
saying to His disciples, “Go not into the way of the Gentiles,” <span
id="fr_2020"></span>[2021](#fn_2020.md) doth He Himself admit her?” first,
this would be our reply, that what He enjoined upon His disciples, He
was not Himself also tied to; secondly, that not in order to preach did
He depart; which indeed Mark likewise intimating said, He even hid
Himself, yet was not concealed.

<span id="iii.LII-p10"></span>For as His not hastening to them first was
a part of the regular course of His proceedings, so to drive them away
when coming to Him was unworthy of His love to man. For if the flying
ought to be pursued, much more ought the pursuing not to be avoided.

<span id="iii.LII-p11"></span>See at any rate how worthy this woman is
of every benefit. For she durst not even come to Jerusalem, fearing, and
accounting herself unworthy. For were it not for this, she would have
come there, as is evident both from her present earnestness, and from
her coming out of her own coasts.

<span id="iii.LII-p12"></span>And some also taking it as an allegory
say, that when Christ came out of Judea, then the church ventured to
approach Him, coming out herself also from her own coasts. For it is
said, “Forget thine own people and thy father’s house.” <span
id="fr_2021"></span>[2022](#fn_2021.md) For both Christ went out of His
borders, and the woman out of her borders, and so it became possible for
them to fall in with each other: thus He saith, “Behold a woman of
Canaan coming out of her own coasts.”

<span id="iii.LII-p14"></span>The evangelist speaks against the woman,
that he may show forth her marvellous act, and celebrate her praise the
more. For when thou hearest of a Canaanitish woman, thou shouldest call
to mind those wicked nations, who overset from their foundations the
very laws of nature. And being reminded of these, consider also the
power of Christ’s advent. For they who were cast out, that they might
not pervert any Jews, these appeared so much better disposed than the
Jews, as even to come out of their coasts, and approach Christ; while
those were driving Him away, even on His coming unto them.

<span id="iii.LII-p15"></span>2. Having then come unto Him, she saith
nothing else, but “Have mercy on me,” and by her cry brings about them
many spectators. For indeed it was a pitiful spectacle to see a woman
crying aloud in so great affliction, and that woman a mother, and
entreating for a daughter, and for a daughter in such evil case: she not
even venturing to bring into the Master’s sight her that was possessed,
but leaving her to lie at home, and herself making the entreaty.

<span id="iii.LII-p16"></span>And she tells her affliction only, and
adds nothing more; neither doth she drag the physician to her house,
like that nobleman, saying, “Come and lay thy hand upon her,” and, “Come
down ere my child die.” <span id="fr_2022"></span>[2023](#fn_2022.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p18"></span>But having described both her calamity,
and the intensity of the disease, she pleads the Lord’s mercy, and cries
aloud; and she saith not, “Have mercy on my daughter,” but, “Have mercy
on me.” For she indeed is insensible of her disease, but it is I that
suffer her innumerable woes; my disease is with consciousness, my
madness with perception of itself.

<span id="iii.LII-p19"></span>2. “But He answered her not a word.” <span
id="fr_2023"></span>[2024](#fn_2023.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p21"></span>What is this new and strange thing? the
Jews in their perverseness He leads on, and <span id="page_312">p.
312</span> <span id="iii.LII-Page_312"></span> blaspheming He entreats
them, and tempting Him He dismisses them not; but to her, running unto
Him, and entreating, and beseeching Him, to her who had been educated
neither in the law, nor in the prophets, and was exhibiting so great
reverence; to her He doth not vouchsafe so much as an answer.

<span id="iii.LII-p22"></span>Whom would not this have offended, seeing
the facts so opposite to the report? For whereas they had heard, that He
went about the villages healing, her, when she had come to Him, He
utterly repels. And who would not have been moved by her affliction, and
by the supplication she made for her daughter in such evil case? For not
as one worthy, nor as demanding a due, not so did she approach Him, but
she entreated that she might find mercy, and merely gave a lamentable
account of her own affliction; yet is she not counted worthy of so much
as an answer.

<span id="iii.LII-p23"></span>Perhaps many of the hearers were offended,
but she was not offended. And why say I, of the hearers? For I suppose
that even the very disciples must have been in some degree affected at
the woman’s affliction, and have been greatly troubled, and out of
heart.

<span id="iii.LII-p24"></span>Nevertheless not even in this trouble did
they venture to say, “Grant her this favor,” but, “His disciples came
and besought Him, saying, Send her away, for she crieth after us.” For
we too, when we wish to persuade any one, oftentimes say the contrary.

<span id="iii.LII-p25"></span>But Christ saith, “I am not sent, but unto
the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” <span
id="fr_2024"></span>[2025](#fn_2024.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p27"></span>What then did the woman, after she heard
this? Was she silent, and did she desist? or did she relax her
earnestness? By no means, but she was the more instant. But it is not so
with us; rather, when we fail to obtain, we desist; whereas it ought to
make us the more urgent.

<span id="iii.LII-p28"></span>And yet, who would not have been driven to
perplexity by the word which was then spoken? Why His silence were
enough to drive her to despair, but His answer did so very much more.
For together with herself, to see them also in utter perplexity that
were pleading with her, and to hear that the thing is even impossible to
be done, was enough to cast her into unspeakable perplexity.

<span id="iii.LII-p29"></span>Yet nevertheless the woman was not
perplexed, but on seeing her advocates prevail nothing, she made herself
shameless with a goodly shamelessness.

<span id="iii.LII-p30"></span>For whereas before this she had not
ventured so much as to come in sight (for “she crieth,” it is said,
“after us”), when one might expect that she should rather depart further
off in utter despair, at that very time she comes nearer, and worships,
saying, “Lord, help me.” <span id="fr_2025"></span>[2026](#fn_2025.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p32"></span>What is this, O woman? Hast thou then
greater confidence than the apostles? more abundant strength?
“Confidence and strength,” saith she, “by no means; nay, I am even full
of shame. Yet nevertheless my very shamelessness do I put forward for
entreaty; He will respect my confidence.” And what is this? Heardest
thou not Him saying, “I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house
of Israel?” “I heard,” saith she, “but He Himself is Lord.” Wherefore
neither did she say, “Entreat and beseech,” but, “Help me.”

<span id="iii.LII-p33"></span>3. What then saith Christ? Not even with
all this was He satisfied, but He makes her perplexity yet more intense
again, saying,

<span id="iii.LII-p34"></span>“It is not meet to take the children’s
bread and to cast it to the dogs.” <span
id="fr_2026"></span>[2027](#fn_2026.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p36"></span>And when He vouchsafed her a word, then He
smote her more sharply than by His silence. And no longer doth He refer
the cause to another, nor say, “I am not sent,” but the more urgent she
makes her entreaty, so much the more doth He also urge His denial. And
He calls them no longer “sheep,” but “children,” and her “a dog.”

<span id="iii.LII-p37"></span>What then saith the woman? Out of His own
very words she frames her plea. “Why, though I be a dog,” said she, “I
am not an alien.”

<span id="iii.LII-p38"></span>Justly did Christ say, “For judgment am I
come.” <span id="fr_2027"></span>[2028](#fn_2027.md) The woman practises
high self-command, and shows forth all endurance and faith, and this,
receiving insult; but they, courted and honored, requite it with the
contrary.

<span id="iii.LII-p40"></span>For, “that food is necessary for the
children,” saith she, “I also know; yet neither am I forbidden, being a
dog. For were it unlawful to receive, neither would it be lawful to
partake of the crumbs; but if, though in scanty measure, they ought to
be partakers, neither am I forbidden, though I be a dog; nay, rather on
this ground am I most surely a partaker, if I am a dog.”

<span id="iii.LII-p41"></span>With this intent did Christ put her off,
for He knew she would say this; for this did He deny the grant, that He
might exhibit her high self-command.

<span id="iii.LII-p42"></span>For if He had not meant to give, neither
would He have given afterwards, nor would He have stopped her mouth
again. But as He doth in the case of the centurion, saying, “I will come
and heal him,” <span id="fr_2028"></span>[2029](#fn_2028.md) that we might
learn the godly fear of that man, and might <span id="page_313">p.
313</span> <span id="iii.LII-Page_313"></span> hear him say, “I am not
worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof;” <span
id="fr_2029"></span>[2030](#fn_2029.md) and as He doth in the case of her
that had the issue of blood, saying, “I perceive that virtue hath gone
out of me,” <span id="fr_2030"></span>[2031](#fn_2030.md) that He might
make her faith manifest; and as in the case of the Samaritan woman, that
He might show how not even upon reproof she desists: <span
id="fr_2031"></span>[2032](#fn_2031.md) so also here, He would not that so
great virtue in the woman should be hid. Not in insult then were His
words spoken, but calling her forth, and revealing the treasure laid up
in her.

<span id="iii.LII-p47"></span>But do thou, I pray thee, together with
her faith see also her humility. For He had called the Jews “children,”
but she was not satisfied with this, but even called them “masters;” so
far was she from grieving at the praises of others.

<span id="iii.LII-p48"></span>“Why, the dogs also,” <span
id="fr_2032"></span>[2033](#fn_2032.md) saith she, “eat of the crumbs that
fall from their master’s table.” <span
id="fr_2033"></span>[2034](#fn_2033.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p51"></span>Seest thou the woman’s wisdom, how she did
not venture so much as to say a word against it, nor was stung by other
men’s praises, nor was indignant at the reproach? Seest thou her
constancy? He said, “It is not meet,” and she said, “Truth, Lord;” He
called them “children,” but she “masters;” He used the name of a dog,
but she added also the dog’s act. Seest thou this woman’s humility?

<span id="iii.LII-p52"></span>Hear the proud language of the Jews. “We
be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man;” <span
id="fr_2034"></span>[2035](#fn_2034.md) and, “We be born of God.” <span
id="fr_2035"></span>[2036](#fn_2035.md) But not so this woman, rather she
calls herself a dog, and them masters; so for this she became a child.
What then saith Christ? “O woman, great is thy faith.” <span
id="fr_2036"></span>[2037](#fn_2036.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p56"></span>Yea, therefore did He put her off, that He
might proclaim aloud this saying, that He might crown the woman.

<span id="iii.LII-p57"></span>“Be it unto thee even as thou wilt.” Now
what He saith is like this: “Thy faith indeed is able to effect even
greater things than these; nevertheless, Be it unto thee even as thou
wilt.”

<span id="iii.LII-p58"></span>This was akin to that voice that said,
“Let the Heaven be, and it was.” <span
id="fr_2037"></span>[2038](#fn_2037.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p60"></span>“And her daughter was made whole from that
very hour.”

<span id="iii.LII-p61"></span>Seest thou how this woman too contributed
not a little to the healing of her daughter? For to this purpose neither
did Christ say, “Let thy little daughter be made whole,” but, “Great is
thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt;” to teach thee that the
words were not used at random, nor were they flattering words, but great
was the power of her faith.

<span id="iii.LII-p62"></span>The certain test, however, and
demonstration thereof, He left to the issue of events. Her daughter
accordingly was straightway healed.

<span id="iii.LII-p63"></span>But mark thou, I pray thee, how when the
apostles had failed, and had not succeeded, this woman had success. So
great a thing is assiduity in prayer. Yea, He had even rather be
solicited by us, guilty as we are, for those who belong to us, than by
others in our behalf. And yet they had more liberty to speak; but she
exhibited much endurance.

<span id="iii.LII-p64"></span>And by the issue He also excused Himself
to His disciples for the delay, and showed that with reason He had not
assented to their request.

<span id="iii.LII-p65"></span>4. “And Jesus departed from thence, and
came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into the mountain, and
sat down there. And great multitudes came unto Him, having with them
those that were lame, blind, maimed, dumb; and cast them <span
id="fr_2038"></span>[2039](#fn_2038.md) at His feet; and He healed them,
insomuch that the multitudes wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak,
the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see, and they
glorified the God of Israel.” <span id="fr_2039"></span>[2040](#fn_2039.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p68"></span>Now He goes about Himself, now sits
awaiting the diseased, and hath the lame brought up unto the mountain.
And no longer do they touch so much as His garment, but advance a higher
step, being cast at His feet: and they showed their faith doubly, first,
by going up into the mountain though lame, then by wanting nothing else
but to be cast at His feet only.

<span id="iii.LII-p69"></span>And great was the marvel and strange, to
see them that were carried walking, the blind needing not any to lead
them by the hand. Yea, both the multitude of the healed, and the
facility of their cure amazed them.

<span id="iii.LII-p70"></span>Seest thou, how the woman indeed He healed
with so much delay, but these immediately? not because these are better
than she is, but because she is more faithful than they. Therefore,
while in her case He defers and delays, to manifest her constancy; on
these He bestows the gift immediately, stopping the mouths of the
unbelieving Jews, and cutting away from them every plea. For the greater
favors one hath received, so much the more is he liable to punishment,
if he be insensible, and the very honor make him no <span
id="page_314">p. 314</span> <span id="iii.LII-Page_314"></span> better.
Therefore you see the rich also proving wicked, are more punished than
the poor, for not being softened even by their prosperity. For tell me
not that they gave alms. Since if they gave not in proportion to their
substance, not even so shall they escape; our alms being judged not by
the measure of our gifts, but by the largeness <span
id="fr_2040"></span>[2041](#fn_2040.md) of our mind. But if these suffer
punishment, much more they that are eager about unnecessary things; who
build houses of two and three stories, but despise the hungry; who give
heed to covetousness, but neglect alms-giving.

<span id="iii.LII-p72"></span>5. But since the discourse hath fallen on
almsgiving, come then, let us resume again to-day that argument, which I
was making three days ago concerning benevolence, and left unfinished.
Ye remember, when lately I was speaking of vanity about your shoes, and
of that empty trouble, and the luxury of the young, that it was from
almsgiving that our discourse passed on to those charges *against you*.
What were the matters then at that time brought forward? That almsgiving
is a kind of art, having its workshop in Heaven, and for its teacher,
not man, but God. Then inquiring what is an art, and what not an art, we
came upon fruitless labors, and evil devices, amongst which we made
mention also of this art concerning men’s shoes.

<span id="iii.LII-p73"></span>Have ye then recalled it to mind? Come
now, let us to-day also resume what we then said, and let us show how
almsgiving is an art, and better than all arts. For if the peculiarity
of art is to issue in something useful, and nothing is more useful than
almsgiving, very evidently this is both an art, and better than all
arts. For it makes for us not shoes, nor doth it weave garments, nor
build houses that are of clay; but it procures life everlasting, and
snatches us from the hands of death, and in either life shows us
glorious, and builds the mansions that are in Heaven, and those eternal
tabernacles.

<span id="iii.LII-p74"></span>This suffers not our lamps to go out, nor
that we should appear at the marriage having filthy garments, but washes
them, and renders them purer than snow. “For though your sins be as
scarlet, I will make them white as snow.” <span
id="fr_2041"></span>[2042](#fn_2041.md) *not send them away fasting, lest
they faint in the way.”*

<span id="iii.LII-p76"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.LII-p76.1"></span>Both</span> above, when going to do this
miracle, He first healed them that were maimed in body, and here He doth
the self-same thing; from the healing of the blind and the lame, He goes
on to this again.

<span id="iii.LII-p77"></span>But why might it be, that then His
disciples said, “Send away the multitude,” but now they said not so; and
this, though three days had past? Either being themselves improved by
this time, or seeing that the people had no great sense of hunger; for
they were glorifying God for the things that were done.

<span id="iii.LII-p78"></span>But see how in this instance too He doth
not proceed at once to the miracle, but calls them forth thereunto. For
the multitudes indeed who had come out for healing durst not ask for the
loaves; but He, the benevolent and provident one, gives even to them
that ask not, and saith unto His disciples, “I have compassion, and will
not send them away fasting.”

<span id="iii.LII-p79"></span>For lest they should say that they came
<span id="page_315">p. 315</span> <span id="iii.LII-Page_315"></span>
having provisions for the way, He saith, “They continue with me now
three days;” so that even if they came having any, it is all spent. For
therefore He Himself did not this on the first and second day, but when
all had been consumed by them, in order that having first been in want,
they might more eagerly accept His work.

<span id="iii.LII-p80"></span>Therefore He saith, “Lest they faint in
the way;” implying both their distance to be great, and that they had
nothing left.

<span id="iii.LII-p81"></span>“Then, if thou art not willing to send
them away fasting, wherefore dost thou not work the miracle?” That by
this question and by their answer He might make the disciples more
heedful, and that they might show forth their faith, coming unto Him,
and saying, “Make loaves.”

<span id="iii.LII-p82"></span>But not even so did they understand the
motive of His question; wherefore afterwards He saith to them, as Mark
relates, “Are your hearts so hardened? Having eyes, see ye not? and
having ears, hear ye not?” <span id="fr_2042"></span>[2043](#fn_2042.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p84"></span>Since, if this were not so, wherefore doth
He speak to the disciples, and signify the multitude’s worthiness to
receive a benefit, and add also the pity He Himself feels?

<span id="iii.LII-p85"></span>But Matthew saith, that after this He also
rebuked them, saying, “O ye of little faith, do ye not yet understand,
nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets
ye took up? nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many
baskets ye took up?” <span id="fr_2043"></span>[2044](#fn_2043.md) So
completely do the evangelists harmonize one with another.

<span id="iii.LII-p87"></span>What then say the disciples? Still they
creep on the ground, although He had done so very many things in order
that that miracle might be kept in memory; as by His question, and by
the answer, and by making them minister herein, and by distributing the
baskets; but their state of mind was yet rather imperfect.

<span id="iii.LII-p88"></span>Wherefore also they say to Him, “Whence
should we have so many loaves in the wilderness?” <span
id="fr_2044"></span>[2045](#fn_2044.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p90"></span>Both before this, and now, they make
mention of the wilderness; themselves in a weak way of argument so
speaking, yet even hereby putting the miracle above suspicion. That is,
lest any should affirm (as I have indeed already said), that they
obtained it from some neighboring village, the place is acknowledged,
that the miracle may be believed. With this view, both the former
miracle and this He works in a wilderness, at a great distance from the
villages.

<span id="iii.LII-p91"></span>The disciples, considering none of all
this, said, “Whence should we have so many loaves in a wilderness?” For
they thought verily He had said it as purposing next to enjoin them to
feed the people; most foolishly; since with this intent He had said, and
that lately, “Give ye them to eat,” <span
id="fr_2045"></span>[2046](#fn_2045.md) that He might bring them to an
urgent need of entreating Him.

<span id="iii.LII-p93"></span>But now He saith not this, “Give ye them
to eat,” but what? “I have compassion on them, and will not send them
away fasting;” bringing the disciples nearer, and provoking them more,
and granting them clearer sight, to ask these things of Him. For in
truth they were the words of one signifying that He hath power not to
send them away fasting; of one manifesting His authority. For the
expression, “I will not,” implies such a purpose in Him.

<span id="iii.LII-p94"></span>2. Since however they still spake of the
multitude merely, and the place, and the wilderness (for “whence,” it is
said, “should we have in a wilderness so many loaves, as to fill so
great a multitude”?); and not even so understood what He said, He
proceeds to contribute His own part, and saith unto them,

<span id="iii.LII-p95"></span>“How many loaves have ye? And they say,
Seven, and a few little fishes.” <span
id="fr_2046"></span>[2047](#fn_2046.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p97"></span>And they no more say, “But what are these
among so many?” <span id="fr_2047"></span>[2048](#fn_2047.md) as they had
said before. So that although they reached not His whole meaning, yet
nevertheless they became higher by degrees. For so He too, arousing
their mind hereby, puts the question much as He had done before, that by
the very form of the inquiry He might remind them of the works already
done.

<span id="iii.LII-p99"></span>But as thou hast seen their imperfection
hereby, so do thou observe the severity of their spirit, and admire
their love of truth, how, writing themselves, they conceal not their own
defects, great as they were. For it was no small blame to have presently
forgotten this miracle, which had so recently taken place; wherefore
they are also rebuked.

<span id="iii.LII-p100"></span>And herewith consider also their
strictness in another matter, how they were conquerors of their
appetite; how disciplined to make little account of their diet. For
being in the wilderness and abiding there three days, they had seven
loaves.

<span id="iii.LII-p101"></span>Now all the rest He doth as on the former
occasion; thus He both makes them sit down on the ground, and He makes
the loaves multiply themselves in the hands of the disciples.

<span id="iii.LII-p102"></span>For, “He commanded,” it is said, “the
<span id="page_316">p. 316</span> <span id="iii.LII-Page_316"></span>
multitude to sit down on the ground. And He took the seven loaves, and
the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to His disciples, and
the disciples to the multitude.” <span
id="fr_2048"></span>[2049](#fn_2048.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p104"></span>But when we come to the end, there is a
difference.

<span id="iii.LII-p105"></span>For, “they did all eat,” so it is said,
“and were filled, and they took up of the broken meat that was
left, <span id="fr_2049"></span>[2050](#fn_2049.md) seven baskets full. And
they that did eat were four thousand men, besides women and
children.” <span id="fr_2050"></span>[2051](#fn_2050.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p108"></span>But why at the former time, when there
were five thousand, did twelve baskets full remain over and above,
whereas here, when there were four thousand, it was seven baskets full?
For what purpose, I say, and by what cause, were the remnants less, the
guests not being so many?

<span id="iii.LII-p109"></span>Either then one may say this, that the
baskets on this last occasion <span id="fr_2051"></span>[2052](#fn_2051.md)
were greater than those used before, <span
id="fr_2052"></span>[2053](#fn_2052.md) or if this were not so, lest the
equality of the miracle should again cast them into forgetfulness, He
rouses their recollection by the difference, that by the variation they
might be reminded of both one and the other. Accordingly, in that case,
He makes the baskets full of fragments equal in number to His disciples,
in this, the other baskets equal to the loaves; indicating even hereby
His unspeakable power, and the ease wherewith He exercised His
authority, in that it was possible for Him to work such miracles, both
in this way and in the other. For neither was it of small power, to
maintain the exact number, both then and now; then when there were five
thousand, now when there were four thousand; and not suffer the remnants
to be more than the baskets used on the one occasion or on the other,
although the number of the guests was different.

<span id="iii.LII-p112"></span>And the end again was like the former.
For as then He left the multitude and withdrew in a ship, so also now;
and John also saith this. <span id="fr_2053"></span>[2054](#fn_2053.md) For
since no sign did so work upon them to follow Him, as the miracle of the
loaves; and they were minded not only to follow Him, but also to make
Him a king; <span id="fr_2054"></span>[2055](#fn_2054.md) avoiding all
suspicion of usurping royalty, He hastens away after this work of
wonder: and He doth not even go away afoot, lest they should follow Him,
but by entering into a ship.

<span id="iii.LII-p115"></span>“And He sent away the multitudes,” so it
saith, “and went on board the ship, and came into the coasts of
Magdala.” <span id="fr_2055"></span>[2056](#fn_2055.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p117"></span>3. “And the Pharisees and Sadducees came
and <span id="fr_2056"></span>[2057](#fn_2056.md) desired Him to show them
a sign from Heaven. But He saith, When it is evening, ye say, Fair
weather, for the sky is red; and in the morning, Foul weather today, for
the sky is red and lowering. Ye can discern the face of the sky, but can
ye not the signs of the times? <span
id="fr_2057"></span>[2058](#fn_2057.md) A wicked and adulterous generation
seeketh after a sign, and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the
sign of the prophet Jonas. And He left them, and departed.” <span
id="fr_2058"></span>[2059](#fn_2058.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p121"></span>But Mark saith, that when they were come
unto Him, and were questioning with Him, “He sighed deeply in His
spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign?” <span
id="fr_2059"></span>[2060](#fn_2059.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p123"></span>And yet surely their inquiry was
deserving of anger and great displeasure; yet nevertheless the
benevolent and provident One is not angry, but pities and bewails them
as incurably diseased, and after so full a demonstration of His power,
tempting Him.

<span id="iii.LII-p124"></span>For not in order to believe did they
seek, but to lay hold of Him. Since had they come unto Him as ready to
believe, He would have given it. For He who said to the woman, “It is
not meet,” <span id="fr_2060"></span>[2061](#fn_2060.md) and afterwards
gave, much more would He have shown His bounty to these.

<span id="iii.LII-p126"></span>But since they did not seek to believe,
therefore He also calls them hypocrites, because in another place they
said one thing, and meant another. Yea, had they believed, they would
not even have asked. And from another thing too it is evident that they
believed not; that when reproved and exposed, they abode not with Him,
nor said, “We are ignorant and seek to learn.”

<span id="iii.LII-p127"></span>But for what sign from Heaven were they
asking? Either that He should say the sun, or curb the moon, or bring
down thunderbolts, or work a change in the air, or some other such
thing.

<span id="iii.LII-p128"></span>What then saith He to all this? “Ye can
discern the face of the sky, but can ye not discern the signs of the
times?” <span id="fr_2061"></span>[2062](#fn_2061.md) See His meekness and
moderation. For <span id="page_317">p. 317</span> <span
id="iii.LII-Page_317"></span> not even as before did He refuse merely,
and say, “There shall none be given them,” but He states also the cause
why He gives it not, even though they were not asking for information.

<span id="iii.LII-p130"></span>What then was the cause? “Much as in the
sky,” saith He, “one thing is a sign of a storm, another of fair
weather, and no one when he saw the sign of foul weather would seek for
a calm, neither in calm and fair weather for a storm; so should you
reckon with regard to me also. For this present time of my coming, is
different from that which is to come. Now there is need of these signs
which are on the earth, but those in Heaven are stored up against that
time. Now as a physician am I come, then I shall be here as a judge; now
to seek that which is gone astray, then to demand an account. Therefore
in a hidden manner am I come, but then with much publicity, folding up
the heaven, hiding the sun, not suffering the moon to give her light.
Then ‘the very powers of the heavens shall be shaken,’ <span
id="fr_2062"></span>[2063](#fn_2062.md) and the manifestation of my coming
shall imitate lightning that appears at once to all. <span
id="fr_2063"></span>[2064](#fn_2063.md) But not now is the time for these
signs; for I am come to die, and to suffer all extremities.”

<span id="iii.LII-p133"></span>Heard ye not the prophet, saying, “He
shall not strive nor cry, neither shall His voice be heard
without?” <span id="fr_2064"></span>[2065](#fn_2064.md) and another again,
“He shall come down as rain upon a fleece of wool?” <span
id="fr_2065"></span>[2066](#fn_2065.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p136"></span>And if men speak of the signs in
Pharaoh’s time, there was an enemy then from whom deliverance was
needed, and it all took place in due course. But to Him that came among
friends there was no need of those signs.

<span id="iii.LII-p137"></span>“And besides, how shall I give the great
signs, when the little are not believed?” Little, I mean, as regards
display, since in power these latter were much greater than the former.
For what could be equal to remitting sins, and raising the dead, and
driving away devils, and creating a body, and ordering all other things
aright?

<span id="iii.LII-p138"></span>But do thou see their hardened heart, how
on being told, that “no sign should be given them but the sign of the
prophet Jonas,” they do not ask. And yet, knowing both the prophet, and
all that befell him, and having been told this a second time, they ought
to have inquired and learnt what the saying could mean; but, as I said,
there is no desire of information in these their doings. For this cause
“He also left them, and departed.”

<span id="iii.LII-p139"></span>4. “And when His disciples,” so it is
said, “were come to the other side, they forgot to take bread. Then
Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees and of the Sadducees.” <span
id="fr_2066"></span>[2067](#fn_2066.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p141"></span>And why said He not plainly, Beware of
their teaching? His will is to remind them of what had been done, for He
knew they had forgotten. But for accusing them at once there seemed to
be no reasonable ground, but to take the occasion from themselves, and
so to reprove them, would make the charge admissible. “And why did He
not then reprove them, when they said, ‘Whence should we have so many
loaves in the wilderness?’ for it seemed a good time then to say what He
says here.” That He might not seem to rush hastily on the miracle. And
besides, He would not blame them before the multitude, nor seek honor in
their presence. And now too the accusation had greater reason, for that
after repetition of the miracle they were so minded.

<span id="iii.LII-p142"></span>Wherefore also He works another miracle,
and then and not till then He reproves; I mean, He brings forward what
they were reasoning in their hearts. But what were their reasonings?
“Because,” so it is said, “we have taken no bread.” <span
id="fr_2067"></span>[2068](#fn_2067.md) For as yet they were full of
trepidation about the purifications of the Jews, and the observances of
meats.

<span id="iii.LII-p144"></span>Wherefore on all accounts He attacks them
even with severity, saying, “Why reason ye in yourselves, O ye of little
faith, because ye have brought no bread? <span
id="fr_2068"></span>[2069](#fn_2068.md) Perceive ye not yet, neither
understand? Have ye your heart hardened? Having eyes, see ye not? Having
ears, hear ye not? <span id="fr_2069"></span>[2070](#fn_2069.md) Do ye not
remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye
took up? neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many
baskets ye took up?” <span id="fr_2070"></span>[2071](#fn_2070.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p148"></span>Seest thou intense displeasure? For
nowhere else doth He appear to have so rebuked them. Wherefore then doth
He so? In order again to cast out their prejudice about the meats. I
mean that with this view, whereas then He had only said, “Perceive ye
not, neither understand?” in this place, and with a strong rebuke, He
saith, “O ye of little faith.” <span
id="fr_2071"></span>[2072](#fn_2071.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p150"></span>For not everywhere is lenity a good
thing. And as He used to allow them freedom of <span id="page_318">p.
318</span> <span id="iii.LII-Page_318"></span> speech, so doth He also
reprove, by this variety providing for their salvation. And mark thou at
once His reproof, how strong, and His mildness. For all but excusing
Himself to them for His severe reproofs to them, He saith, “Do ye not
yet consider the five loaves, and how many baskets ye took up; and the
seven loaves, and how many baskets ye took up?” And to this end He sets
down also the numbers, as well of the persons fed as of the fragments,
at once both bringing them to recollection of the past, and making them
more attentive to the future.

<span id="iii.LII-p151"></span>And to teach thee how great the power of
His reproof, and how it roused up their slumbering mind, hear what saith
the evangelist. For Jesus having said no more, but having reproved them,
and added this only, “How is it that ye do not understand, that I spake
it not to you concerning bread that ye should beware, but of the leaven
of the Pharisees and Sadducees;” <span
id="fr_2072"></span>[2073](#fn_2072.md) He subjoined, saying, “Then
understood they that He bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but
of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees,” <span
id="fr_2073"></span>[2074](#fn_2073.md) although He had not uttered that
interpretation.

<span id="iii.LII-p154"></span>See how much good His reproof wrought.
For it both led them away from the Jewish observances, and when they
were remiss, made them more heedful, and delivered them from want of
faith; <span id="fr_2074"></span>[2075](#fn_2074.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p156"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.LII-p156.1"></span>Wherefore</span> hath he mentioned the
founder of the city? Because there was another besides, Cæsarea
Stratonis. But not in that, but in this doth He ask them, leading them
far away from the Jews, so that being freed from all alarm, they might
speak with boldness all that was in their mind.

<span id="iii.LII-p157"></span>And wherefore did He not ask them at once
their own opinion, but that of the people? In order that when they had
told the people’s opinion, and then were asked, “But whom <span
id="fr_2075"></span>[2076](#fn_2075.md) say ye that I am?” by the manner of
His inquiry they might be led up to a sublimer notion, and not fall into
the same low view as the multitude. Accordingly He asks them not at all
in the beginning of His preaching, but when He had done many miracles,
and had discoursed with them of many and high doctrines, and had
afforded so many clear proofs of His Godhead, and of His unanimity with
the Father, then He puts this question to them.

<span id="iii.LII-p159"></span>And He said not, “Whom say the Scribes
and Pharisees that I am?” often as these had come unto Him, and
discoursed with Him; but, “Whom do men say that I am?” inquiring after
the judgment of the people, as unbiassed. For though it was far meaner
than it should be, yet was it free from malice, but the other was
teeming with much wickedness.

<span id="iii.LII-p160"></span>And signifying how earnestly He desires
His Economy <span id="fr_2076"></span>[2077](#fn_2076.md) to be confessed,
He saith, “The Son of Man;” thereby denoting His Godhead, which He doth
also in many other places. For He saith, “No man hath ascended up to
Heaven, but the Son of Man, which is in Heaven.” <span
id="fr_2077"></span>[2078](#fn_2077.md) And again, “But when ye shall see
the Son of Man ascend up, where He was before.” <span
id="fr_2078"></span>[2079](#fn_2078.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p164"></span>Then, since they said, “Some John the
Baptist, some Elias, some Jeremias, or one of the prophets,” <span
id="fr_2079"></span>[2080](#fn_2079.md) and set forth their mistaken
opinion, He next added, “But whom say ye that I am?” <span
id="fr_2080"></span>[2081](#fn_2080.md) calling them on by His second
inquiry to entertain some higher imagination concerning Him, and
indicating that their former judgment falls exceedingly short of His
dignity. Wherefore He seeks for another judgment from themselves, and
puts a second question, that they might not fall in with the multitude,
who, because they saw His miracles greater than human, accounted Him a
man indeed, but one that had appeared after a resurrection, as Herod
also said. <span id="fr_2081"></span>[2082](#fn_2081.md) But He, to lead
them away from this notion, saith, “But whom say ye that I am?” that is,
“ye that are with me always, and see me working miracles, and have
yourselves done many mighty works by me.”

<span id="iii.LII-p168"></span>2. What then saith the mouth of the apos
<span id="page_319">p. 319</span> <span id="iii.LII-Page_319"></span>
tles, Peter, the ever fervent, the leader of the apostolic choir? <span
id="fr_2082"></span>[2083](#fn_2082.md) When all are asked, he answers. And
whereas when He asked the opinion of the people, all replied to the
question; when He asked their own, Peter springs forward, and
anticipates them, and saith, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
God.” <span id="fr_2083"></span>[2084](#fn_2083.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p171"></span>What then saith Christ? “Blessed art
thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto
thee.” <span id="fr_2084"></span>[2085](#fn_2084.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p173"></span>Yet surely unless he had rightly
confessed Him, as begotten of the very Father Himself, this were no work
of revelation; had he accounted our Lord to be one of the many, his
saying was not worthy of a blessing. Since before this also they said,
“Truly He is Son of God,” <span id="fr_2085"></span>[2086](#fn_2085.md)
those, I mean, who were in the vessel after the tempest, which they saw,
and were not blessed, although of course they spake truly. For they
confessed not such a Sonship as Peter, but accounted Him to be truly Son
as one of the many, and though peculiarly so beyond the many, yet not of
the same substance.

<span id="iii.LII-p175"></span>And Nathanael too said, “Rabbi, Thou art
the Son of God, Thou art the King of Israel;” <span
id="fr_2086"></span>[2087](#fn_2086.md) and so far from being blessed, he
is even reproved by Him, as having said what was far short of the truth.
He replied at least, “Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the
fig-tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than
these.” <span id="fr_2087"></span>[2088](#fn_2087.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p178"></span>Why then is this man blessed? Because he
acknowledged Him very Son. Wherefore you see, that while in those former
instances He had said no such thing, in this case He also signifies who
had revealed it. That is, lest his words might seem to the many (because
he was an earnest lover of Christ) to be words of friendship and
flattery, and of a disposition to show favor to Him, he brings forward
the person who had made them ring <span
id="fr_2088"></span>[2089](#fn_2088.md) in his soul; to inform thee that
Peter indeed spake, but the Father suggested, and that thou mightest
believe the saying to be no longer a human opinion, but a divine
doctrine.

<span id="iii.LII-p180"></span>And wherefore doth He not Himself declare
it, nor say, “I am the Christ,” but by His question establish this,
bringing them in to confess it? Because so to do was both more suitable
to Him, yea necessary at that time, and it drew them on the more to the
belief of the things that were said.

<span id="iii.LII-p181"></span>Seest thou how the Father reveals the
Son, how the Son the Father? For “neither knoweth any man the Father,”
saith He, “save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal
Him.” <span id="fr_2089"></span>[2090](#fn_2089.md) It cannot therefore be
that one should learn the Son of any other than of the Father; neither
that one should learn the Father of any other than of the Son. So that
even hereby, their sameness of honor and of substance is manifest.

<span id="iii.LII-p183"></span>3. What then saith Christ? “Thou art
Simon, the son of Jonas; thou shalt be called Cephas.” <span
id="fr_2090"></span>[2091](#fn_2090.md) “Thus since thou hast proclaimed my
Father, I too name him that begat thee;” all but saying, “As thou art
son of Jonas, even so am I of my Father.” Else it were superfluous to
say, “Thou art Son of Jonas;” but since he had said, “Son of God,” to
point out that He is so Son of God, as the other son of Jonas, of the
same substance with Him that begat Him, therefore He added this, “And I
say unto thee, Thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my
Church;” <span id="fr_2091"></span>[2092](#fn_2091.md) that is, on the
faith of his confession. Hereby He signifies that many were now on the
point of believing, and raises his spirit, and makes him a shepherd.
“And the gates of hell <span id="fr_2092"></span>[2093](#fn_2092.md) shall
not prevail against it.” “And if not against it, much more not against
me. So be not troubled because thou art shortly to hear that I shall be
betrayed and crucified.”

<span id="iii.LII-p187"></span>Then He mentions also another honor. “And
I also <span id="fr_2093"></span>[2094](#fn_2093.md) will give thee the
keys of the heavens.” <span id="fr_2094"></span>[2095](#fn_2094.md) But
what is this, “And I also will give thee?” “As the Father hath given
thee to know me, so will I also give thee.”

<span id="iii.LII-p190"></span>And He said not, “I will entreat the
Father” (although the manifestation of His authority was great, and the
largeness of the gift unspeakable), but, “I will give thee.” What dost
Thou give? tell me. “The keys of the heavens, that whatsoever thou shalt
bind on earth, shall be bound in Heaven, <span
id="fr_2095"></span>[2096](#fn_2095.md) and whatsoever thou shalt loose on
earth, shall be loosed in Heaven.” How then is it not “His to give to
sit on His right hand, and on His left,” <span
id="fr_2096"></span>[2097](#fn_2096.md) when He saith, “I will give thee”?

<span id="iii.LII-p193"></span>Seest thou how He, His own self, leads
Peter on to high thoughts of Him, and reveals Himself, and implies that
He is Son of God by these two promises? For those things which are
peculiar to God alone, (both to absolve sins, and to make the church in
<span id="page_320">p. 320</span> <span id="iii.LII-Page_320"></span>
capable of overthrow in such assailing waves, and to exhibit a man that
is a fisher more solid than any rock, while all the world is at war with
him), these He promises Himself to give; as the Father, speaking to
Jeremiah, said, He would make him as “a brazen pillar, and as a
wall;” <span id="fr_2097"></span>[2098](#fn_2097.md) but him to one nation
only, this man in every part of the world.

<span id="iii.LII-p195"></span>I would fain inquire then of those who
desire to lessen the dignity of the Son, which manner of gifts were
greater, those which the Father gave to Peter, or those which the Son
gave him? For the Father gave to Peter the revelation of the Son; but
the Son gave him to sow that of the Father and that of Himself in every
part of the world; and to a mortal man He entrusted the authority over
all things in Heaven, giving him the keys; who extended the church to
every part of the world, and declared it to be stronger than heaven.
“For heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word shall not pass
away.” <span id="fr_2098"></span>[2099](#fn_2098.md) How then is He less,
who hath given such gifts, hath effected such things?

<span id="iii.LII-p197"></span>And these things I say, not dividing the
works of Father and Son (“for all things are made by Him, and without
Him was nothing made which was made”): <span
id="fr_2099"></span>[2100](#fn_2099.md) but bridling the shameless tongue
of them that dare so to speak.

<span id="iii.LII-p199"></span>But see, throughout all, His authority:
“I say unto thee, Thou art Peter; I will build the Church; I will give
thee the keys of Heaven.” <span id="fr_2100"></span>[2101](#fn_2100.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p201"></span>4. And then, when He had so said, “He
charged them that they should tell no man that He was the Christ.” <span
id="fr_2101"></span>[2102](#fn_2101.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p203"></span>And why did He charge them? That when the
things which offend are taken out of the way, and the cross is
accomplished, and the rest of His sufferings fulfilled, and when there
is nothing any more to interrupt and disturb the faith of the people in
Him, the right opinion concerning Him may be engraven pure and immovable
in the mind of the hearers. For, in truth, His power had not yet clearly
shone forth. Accordingly it was His will then to be preached by them,
when both the plain truth of the facts, and the power of His deeds were
pleading in support of the assertions of the apostles. For it was by no
means the same thing to see Him in Palestine, now working miracles, and
now insulted and persecuted (and especially when the very cross was
presently to follow the miracles that were happening); and to behold him
everywhere in the world, adored and believed, and no more suffering
anything, such as He had suffered.

<span id="iii.LII-p204"></span>Therefore He bids them “tell no man.” For
that which hath been once rooted and then plucked up, would hardly, if
planted, again be retained among the many; but that which, once fixed,
hath remained immovable, and hath suffered injury from no quarter,
easily mounts up, and advances to a greater growth.

<span id="iii.LII-p205"></span>And if they who had enjoyed the benefit
of many miracles, and had had part in so many unutterable mysteries,
were offended by the mere hearing of it; or rather not these only, but
even the leader <span id="fr_2102"></span>[2103](#fn_2102.md) of them all,
Peter; consider what it was likely the common sort should feel, being
first told that He is the Son of God, then seeing Him even crucified and
spit upon, and that without knowledge of the secret of those mysteries,
or participation in the gift of the Holy Ghost. For if to His disciples
He said, “I have many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
now;” <span id="fr_2103"></span>[2104](#fn_2103.md) much more would the
rest of the people have utterly failed, had the chiefest of these
mysteries been revealed to them before the proper time. Accordingly He
forbids them to tell.

<span id="iii.LII-p208"></span>And to instruct thee how great a thing it
was, their afterwards learning His doctrine complete, when the things
that offend had passed by; learn it from this same leader of theirs. For
this very Peter, he who after so many miracles proved so weak as even to
deny Him, and to be in fear of a mean damsel; after the cross had come
forth, and he had received the certain proofs of the resurrection, and
there was nothing more to offend and trouble him, retained the teaching
of the Spirit so immovable, that more vehemently than a lion he sprang
upon the people of the Jews, for all the dangers and innumerable deaths
which were threatened.

<span id="iii.LII-p209"></span>With reason then did He bid them not tell
the many before the crucifixion, since not even to them that were to
teach did He venture to commit all before the crucifixion. “For I have
many things to say unto you,” saith He, “but ye cannot bear them now.”

<span id="iii.LII-p210"></span>And of the things too that He did say,
they do not understand many, which He did not make plain before the
crucifixion. At least when He was risen from the dead, then and not
before they knew some of His sayings.

<span id="iii.LII-p211"></span>5. “From that time forth began He to show
unto them that He must suffer. <span
id="fr_2104"></span>[2105](#fn_2104.md) From <span id="page_321">p.
321</span> <span id="iii.LII-Page_321"></span> that time.” What time?
When He had fixed the doctrine in them; when He had brought in the
beginning of the Gentiles. <span id="fr_2105"></span>[2106](#fn_2105.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p214"></span>But not even so did they understand what
He said. “For the saying,” it is said, “was hid from them;” <span
id="fr_2106"></span>[2107](#fn_2106.md) and they were as in a kind of
perplexity, not knowing that He must rise again. Therefore He rather
dwells on the difficulties, and enlarges His discourse, that He may open
their mind, and they may understand what it can be that He speaks of.

<span id="iii.LII-p216"></span>“But they understood not, but the saying
was hid from them, and they feared to ask this;” <span
id="fr_2107"></span>[2108](#fn_2107.md) not whether He should die, but how,
and in what manner, and what this mystery could be. For they did not
even know what was this same rising again, and supposed it much better
not to die. Therefore, the rest being troubled and in perplexity, Peter
again, in his ardor, alone ventures to discourse of these things; and
not even he openly, but when he had taken Him apart; that is, having
separated himself from the rest of the disciples; and he saith, “Be it
far from Thee, Lord, this shall not be unto Thee.” <span
id="fr_2108"></span>[2109](#fn_2108.md) What ever is this? He that obtained
a revelation, he that was blessed, hath he so soon fallen away, and
suffered overthrow, so as to fear His passion? And what marvel, that one
who had not on these points received any revelation, should have that
feeling? Yea, to inform thee that not of himself did he speak those
other things either, see in these matters that were not revealed to him
how he is confounded and overthrown, and being told ten thousand times,
knows not what the saying can mean.

<span id="iii.LII-p219"></span>For that He is Son of God he had learnt,
but what the mystery of the cross and of the resurrection might be, was
not yet manifest to him: for “the saying,” it is said, “was hid from
them.”

<span id="iii.LII-p220"></span>Seest thou that with just cause He bade
them not declare it to the rest? For if it so confounded them, who must
needs be made aware of it, what would not all others have felt?

<span id="iii.LII-p221"></span>6. He however, to signify that He is far
from coming to the passion against His will, both rebuked Peter, and
called him Satan.

<span id="iii.LII-p222"></span>Let them hear, as many as are ashamed of
the suffering of the cross of Christ. For if the chief apostle, even
before he had learnt all distinctly, was called Satan for feeling this,
what excuse can they have, who after so abundant proof deny His economy?
I say, when he who had been so blessed, who made such a confession, has
such words addressed to him; consider what they will suffer, who after
all this deny the mystery of the cross.

<span id="iii.LII-p223"></span>And He said not, “Satan spake by thee,”
but, “Get thee behind me, Satan.” <span
id="fr_2109"></span>[2110](#fn_2109.md) For indeed it was a desire of the
adversary that Christ should not suffer. Therefore with such great
severity did He rebuke him, as knowing that both he and the rest are
especially afraid of this, and will not easily receive it.

<span id="iii.LII-p225"></span>Therefore He also reveals the thoughts of
his mind, saying, “Thou savorest <span
id="fr_2110"></span>[2111](#fn_2110.md) not the things that be of God, but
those that be of men.”

<span id="iii.LII-p227"></span>But what means, “Thou savorest <span
id="fr_2111"></span>[2112](#fn_2111.md) not the things that be of God, but
those that be of men”? Peter examining the matter by human and earthly
reasoning, accounted it disgraceful to Him and an unmeet thing. Touching
him therefore sharply, <span id="fr_2112"></span>[2113](#fn_2112.md) He
saith, “My passion is not an unmeet thing, but thou givest this sentence
with a carnal mind; whereas if thou hadst hearkened to my sayings in a
godly manner, disengaging thyself from thy carnal understanding, thou
wouldest know that this of all things most becometh me. For thou indeed
supposest that to suffer is unworthy of me; but I say unto thee, that
for me not to suffer is of the devil’s mind;” by the contrary statements
repressing his alarm.

<span id="iii.LII-p230"></span>Thus as John, accounting it unworthy of
Christ to be baptized by him, was persuaded of Christ to baptize Him, He
saying, “Thus it becometh us,” <span
id="fr_2113"></span>[2114](#fn_2113.md) and this same Peter too, forbidding
Him to wash his feet, by the words, “Thou hast no part with me, unless I
wash thy feet;” <span id="fr_2114"></span>[2115](#fn_2114.md) even so here
too He restrained him by the mention of the opposite, and by the
severity of the reproof repressed his fear of suffering.

<span id="iii.LII-p233"></span>7. Let no man therefore be ashamed of the
honored symbols of our salvation, and of the chiefest of all good
things, whereby we even live, and whereby we are; but as a crown, so let
us bear about the cross of Christ. Yea, for by it all things are
wrought, that are wrought among us. Whether one is to be new-born, the
cross is there; or to be nourished with that mystical food, or to be
ordained, or to do anything else, everywhere our symbol of victory is
present. Therefore both on house, and walls, and windows, and upon our
forehead, and upon our mind, we inscribe it with much care.

<span id="iii.LII-p234"></span>For of the salvation wrought for us, and
of our common freedom, and of the goodness of our Lord, this is the
sign. “For as a <span id="page_322">p. 322</span> <span
id="iii.LII-Page_322"></span> sheep was He led to the slaughter.” <span
id="fr_2115"></span>[2116](#fn_2115.md) When therefore thou signest
thyself, think of the purpose of the cross, and quench anger, and all
the other passions. When thou signest thyself, fill thy forehead with
all courage, make thy soul free. And ye know assuredly what are the
things that give freedom. Wherefore also Paul leading us there, I mean
unto the freedom that beseems us, did on this wise lead us unto it,
having reminded us of the cross and blood of our Lord. “For ye are
bought,” saith he, “with a price; be not ye the servants of men.” <span
id="fr_2116"></span>[2117](#fn_2116.md) Consider, saith he, the price that
hath been paid for thee, and thou wilt be a slave to no man; by the
price meaning the cross.

<span id="iii.LII-p237"></span>Since not merely by the fingers ought one
to engrave it, but before this by the purpose of the heart with much
faith. And if in this way thou hast marked it on thy face, none of the
unclean spirits will be able to stand near thee, seeing the blade
whereby he received his wound, seeing the sword which gave him his
mortal stroke. For if we, on seeing the places in which the criminals
are beheaded, shudder; think what the devil must endure, seeing the
weapon, whereby Christ put an end to all his power, and cut off the head
of the dragon.

<span id="iii.LII-p238"></span>Be not ashamed then of so great a
blessing, lest Christ be ashamed of thee, when He comes with His glory,
and the sign appears before Him, shining beyond the very sunbeam. <span
id="fr_2117"></span>[2118](#fn_2117.md) For indeed the cross cometh then,
uttering a voice by its appearance, and pleading with the whole world
for our Lord, and signifying that no part hath failed of what pertained
to Him.

<span id="iii.LII-p240"></span>This sign, both in the days of our
forefathers and now, hath opened doors that were shut up; <span
id="fr_2118"></span>[2119](#fn_2118.md) this hath quenched poisonous
drugs; <span id="fr_2119"></span>[2120](#fn_2119.md) this hath taken away
the power of hemlock; this hath healed bites of venomous beasts. For if
it opened the gates of hell, and threw wide the archways of Heaven, and
made a new entrance into Paradise, and cut away the nerves of the devil;
what marvel, if it prevailed over poisonous drugs, and venomous beasts,
and all other such things.

<span id="iii.LII-p243"></span>This therefore do thou engrave upon thy
mind, and embrace the salvation of our souls. For this cross saved and
converted the world, drove away error, brought back truth, made earth
Heaven, fashioned men into angels. Because of this, the devils are no
longer terrible, but contemptible; neither is death, death, but a sleep;
because of this, all that warreth against us is cast to the ground, and
trodden under foot.

<span id="iii.LII-p244"></span>If any one therefore say to thee, Dost
thou worship the crucified? say, with your voice all joy, and your
countenance gladdened, “I do both worship Him, and will never cease to
worship.” And if he laugh, weep for him, because he is mad. Thank the
Lord, that He hath bestowed on us such benefits, as one cannot so much
as learn without His revelation from above. Why, this is the very reason
of his laughing, that “the natural man receiveth not the things of the
Spirit.” <span id="fr_2120"></span>[2121](#fn_2120.md) Since our children
too feel this, when they see any of the great and marvellous things; and
if thou bring a child into the mysteries, he will laugh. Now the heathen
are like these children; or rather they are more imperfect even than
these; wherefore also they are more wretched, in that not in an immature
age, but when full grown, they have the feelings of babes; wherefore
neither are they worthy of indulgence.

<span id="iii.LII-p246"></span>But let us with a clear voice, shouting
both loud and high, cry out and say (and should all the heathen be
present, so much the more confidently), that the cross is our glory, and
the sum of all our blessings, and our confidence, and all our crown. I
would that also with Paul I were able to say, “By which the world is
crucified unto me, and I unto the world;” <span
id="fr_2121"></span>[2122](#fn_2121.md) but I cannot, restrained as I am by
various passions.

<span id="iii.LII-p248"></span>8. Wherefore I admonish both you, and
surely before you myself, to be crucified to the world, and to have
nothing in common with the earth, but to set your love on your country
above, and the glory and the good things that come from it. For indeed
we are soldiers of a heavenly King, and are clad with spiritual arms.
Why then take we upon ourselves the life of traders, and mountebanks,
nay rather of worms? For where the King is, there should also the
soldier be. Yea, we are become soldiers, not of them that are far off,
but of them that are near. For the earthly king indeed would not endure
that all should be in the royal courts, and at his own side, but the
King of the Heavens willeth all to be near His royal throne.

<span id="iii.LII-p249"></span>And how, one may say, is it possible for
us, being here, to stand by that throne? Because Paul too being on earth
was where the seraphim, where the cherubim are; and nearer to Christ,
than these the body guards to the king. For these turn about their faces
in many directions, but him nothing beguiled <span id="page_323">p.
323</span> <span id="iii.LII-Page_323"></span> nor distracted, but he
kept his whole mind intent upon the king. So that if we would, this is
possible to us also.

<span id="iii.LII-p250"></span>For were He distant from us in place,
thou mightest well doubt, but if He is present everywhere, to him that
strives and is in earnest He is near. Wherefore also the prophet said,
“I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me; <span
id="fr_2122"></span>[2123](#fn_2122.md) ” and God Himself again, “I am a
God nigh at hand, and not a God afar off.” <span
id="fr_2123"></span>[2124](#fn_2123.md) Then as our sins separate us from
Him, so do our righteousnesses draw us nigh unto Him. “For while thou
art yet speaking,” it is said, “I will say, Here I am.” <span
id="fr_2124"></span>[2125](#fn_2124.md) What father would ever be thus
obedient to his offspring? What mother is there, so ready, and
continually standing, if haply her children call her? There is not one,
no father, no mother: but God stands continually waiting, if any of his
servants should perchance call Him; and never, when we have called as we
ought, hath He refused to hear. Therefore He saith, “While thou art yet
speaking,” I do not wait for thee to finish, and I straightway hearken.

<span id="iii.LII-p254"></span>9. Let us call Him therefore, as it is
His will to be called. But what is this His will? “Loose,” saith He,
“every band of iniquity, unloose the twisted knots of oppressive
covenants, tear in pieces every unjust contract. Break thy bread to the
hungry, and bring in the poor that are cast out to thy house. If thou
seest one naked, cover him, and them that belong to thy seed thou shalt
not overlook. Then shall thy light break forth in the morning, and thine
healings shall spring forth speedily, and thy righteousness shall go
before thee, and the glory of the Lord shall cover thee. Then thou shalt
call upon me, and I will give ear unto thee; whilst thou art yet
speaking, I will say, Lo! here I am.” <span
id="fr_2125"></span>[2126](#fn_2125.md)

<span id="iii.LII-p256"></span>And who is able to do all this? it may be
asked. Nay, who is unable, I pray thee? For which is difficult of the
things I have mentioned? Which is laborious? Which not easy?

<span id="iii.LII-p257"></span>Why, so entirely are they not possible
only, but even easy, that many have actually overshot the measure of
those sayings, not only tearing in pieces unjust contracts, but even
stripping themselves of all their goods; making the poor welcome not to
roof and table, but even to the sweat of their body, and laboring in
order to maintain them; doing good not to kinsmen only, but even to
enemies.

<span id="iii.LII-p258"></span>But what is there at all even hard in
these sayings? For neither did He say, “Pass over the mountain, go
across the sea, dig through so many acres of land, abide without food,
wrap thyself in sackcloth;” but, “Impart to the poor, <span
id="fr_2126"></span>[2127](#fn_2126.md) impart of thy bread, cancel the
contracts unjustly made.”

<span id="iii.LII-p260"></span>What is more easy than this? tell me. But
even if thou account it difficult, look, I pray thee, at the rewards
also, and it shall be easy to thee.

<span id="iii.LII-p261"></span>For much as our emperors at the horse
races heap together before the combatants crowns, and prizes, and
garments, even so Christ also sets His rewards in the midst of His
course, holding them out by the prophet’s words, as it were by many
hands. And the emperors, although they be ten thousand times emperors,
yet as being men, and the wealth which they have in a course of
spending, and their munificence of exhaustion, are ambitious of making
the little appear much; wherefore also they commit each thing severally
into the hand of the several attendants, and so bring it forward. But
our King contrariwise, having heaped all together (because He is very
rich, and doeth nothing for display), He so brings it forward, and what
He so reaches out is indefinitely great, and will need many hands to
hold it. And to make thee aware of this, examine each particular of it
carefully.

<span id="iii.LII-p262"></span>“Then,” saith He, “shall thy light break
forth in the morning.” <span id="fr_2127"></span>[2128](#fn_2127.md) Doth
not this gift appear to thee as some one thing? But it is not one; nay,
for it hath many things in it, both prizes, and crowns, and other
rewards. And, if ye are minded, let us take it to pieces and show all
its wealth, as it shall be possible for us to show it; only do not ye
grow weary.

<span id="iii.LII-p264"></span>And first, let us learn the meaning of
“It shall break forth.” For He said not at all, “shall appear,” but
“shall break forth;” declaring to us its quickness and plentifulness,
and how exceedingly He desires our salvation, and how the good things
themselves travail to come forth, and press on; and that which would
check their unspeakable force shall be nought; by all which He indicates
their plentifulness, and the infinity of His abundance. But what is “the
morning.” It means, “not after being in life’s temptations, neither
after our evils have come upon us;” nay, it is quite beforehand with
them. For as in our fruits, we call that early, which has shown itself
before its season; so also here again, declaring its rapidity, he has
spoken <span id="page_324">p. 324</span> <span
id="iii.LII-Page_324"></span> in this way, much as above He said,
“Whilst thou art yet speaking, I will say, Lo! here I am.”

<span id="iii.LII-p265"></span>But of what manner of light is He
speaking, and what can this light be? Not this, that is sensible; but
another far better, which shows us Heaven, the angels, the archangels,
the cherubim, the seraphim, the thrones, the dominions, the
principalities, the powers, the whole host, the royal palaces, the
tabernacles. For shouldest thou be counted worthy of this light, thou
shalt both see these, and be delivered from hell, and from the venomous
worm, and from the gnashing of teeth, and from the bonds that cannot be
broken, and from the anguish and the affliction, from the darkness that
hath no light, and from being cut asunder, and from the river of fire,
and from the curse, and from the abodes of sorrow; and thou shalt
depart, “where sorrow and woe are fled away,” <span
id="fr_2128"></span>[2129](#fn_2128.md) where great is the joy, and the
peace, and the love, and the pleasure, and the mirth; where is life
eternal, and unspeakable glory, and inexpressible beauty; where are
eternal tabernacles, and the untold glory of the King, and those good
things, “which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered
into the heart of man;” <span id="fr_2129"></span>[2130](#fn_2129.md) where
is the spiritual bridechamber, and the apartments of the heavens, and
the virgins that bear the bright lamps, and they who have the marriage
garment; where many are the possessions of our Lord, and the storehouses
of the King.

<span id="iii.LII-p268"></span>Seest thou how great the rewards, and how
many He hath set forth by one expression, and how He brought all
together?

<span id="iii.LII-p269"></span>So also by unfolding each of the
expressions that follow, we shall find our abundance great, and the
ocean immense. Shall we then still delay, I beg you; and be backward to
show mercy on them that are in need? Nay, I entreat, but though we must
throw away all, be cast into the fire, venture against the sword, leap
upon daggers, suffer what you will; let us bear all easily, that we may
obtain the garment of the kingdom of Heaven, and that untold glory;
which may we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord
Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might, world without end. Amen.
