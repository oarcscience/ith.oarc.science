<span id="iii.XVI-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iii.XVI-p1.1"></span>Homily XVI.</span>

<span id="iii.XVI-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.XVI-p2.1"></span>[Matt. V.
17](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017.md)<span
id="iii.XVI-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="iii.XVI-p3"></span>“Think not that I am come to destroy the
Law or the Prophets.”

<span id="iii.XVI-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.XVI-p4.1"></span>Why</span>, who suspected this? or who accused
Him, that He should make a defense against this charge? Since surely
from what had gone before <span id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660.md) no
such suspicion was generated. For to command men to be meek, and gentle,
and merciful, and pure in heart, and to strive for righteousness,
indicated no such design, but rather altogether the contrary.

<span id="iii.XVI-p6"></span>Wherefore then can He have said this? Not
at random, nor vainly: but inasmuch as He was proceeding to ordain
commandments greater than those of old, saying, “It was said to them of
old time, Thou shalt not kill; <span id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md)
but I say unto you, Be not even angry;” and to mark out a way for a kind
of divine and heavenly conversation; <span
id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md) in order that the strangeness thereof
might not disturb the souls of the hearers, nor dispose them quite to
mutiny against what He said He used this means of setting them right
beforehand.

<span id="iii.XVI-p9"></span>For although they fulfilled not the law,
yet nevertheless they were possessed with much conscientious regard to
it; and whilst they were annulling it every day by their deeds, the
letters thereof they would have remain unmoved, and that no one should
add anything more to them. Or rather, they bore with their rulers adding
thereto, not however for the better, but for the worse. For so they used
to set aside the honor due to our parents by additions of their own, and
very many others also of the matters enjoined them, they would free
themselves of <span id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md) by these
unseasonable additions.

<span id="iii.XVI-p11"></span>Therefore, since Christ in the first place
was not of the sacredotal tribe, and next, the things which He was about
to introduce were a sort of addition, not however lessening, but
enhancing virtue; He knowing beforehand that both these circumstances
would trouble them, before He wrote in their mind those wondrous laws,
casts out that which was sure to be harboring there. And what was it
that was harboring there, and making an obstacle?

<span id="iii.XVI-p12"></span>2. They thought that He, thus speaking,
did so with a view to the abrogation of the ancient institutions. This
suspicion therefore He heals; nor here only doth He so, but elsewhere
also again. Thus, since they accounted Him no less than an adversary of
God, from this sort of reason, namely, His not keeping the sabbath; He,
to heal such their suspicion, there also again sets forth His pleas, of
which some indeed were proper to Himself; as when He saith, “My Father
worketh, and I work;” <span id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664.md) but some
had in them much condescension, as when He brings forward the sheep lost
on the sabbath day, <span id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665.md) and points
out that the law is disturbed for its preservation, and makes mention
again of circumcision, as having this same effect. <span
id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666.md)

<span id="iii.XVI-p16"></span>Wherefore we see also that He often speaks
words somewhat beneath Him, to remove the semblance of His being an
adversary of God.

<span id="iii.XVI-p17"></span>For this cause He who had raised thousands
of the dead with a word only, when He was calling Lazarus, added also a
prayer; and then, lest this should make Him appear less than Him that
begat Him, He, to correct this suspicion, added, “I said these things,
because of the people which standeth by, that they may believe that thou
hast sent me.” <span id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667.md) And neither doth
He work all things as one who acted by His own power, that He might
thoroughly correct their weakness; nor doth He all things with prayer,
lest He should leave matter of evil suspicion to them that should
follow, as though He were without strength or power: but He mingles the
latter with the former, and those again with these. Neither doth He this
indiscriminately, but with His own proper wisdom. For while He doeth the
greater works authoritatively, in the less He looks up unto Heaven.
Thus, when absolving sins, and revealing His secrets, and opening
Paradise, and driving away devils, and cleansing lepers, and bridling
death, and raising the dead by thousands, He did all by way of command:
but when, what was much less than these, He <span id="page_101">p.
101</span> <span id="iii.XVI-Page_101"></span> was causing many loaves
to spring forth out of few, then He looked up to Heaven: signifying that
not through weakness He doth this. For He who could do the greater with
authority, how in the lesser could He need prayer? But as I was saying,
He doeth this to silence their shamelessness. The same reckoning, then,
I bid thee make of His words also, when thou hearest Him speak lowly
things. For many in truth are the causes both for words and for actions
of that cast: as, for instance, that He might not be supposed alien from
God; His instructing and waiting on all men; His teaching humility; His
being encompassed with flesh; the Jews’ inability to hear all at once;
His teaching us to utter no high word of ourselves. For this cause many
times, having in His own person said much that is lowly of Himself, the
great things He leaves to be said by others. Thus He Himself indeed,
reasoning with the Jews, said, “Before Abraham was, <span
class="c20"><span id="iii.XVI-p18.2"></span>I Am</span>:” <span
id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668.md) but His disciple not thus, but, “In
the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God.” <span id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669.md)

<span id="iii.XVI-p21"></span>Again, that He Himself made Heaven, and
earth, and sea, and all things visible and invisible, in His own person
He nowhere expressly said: but His disciple, speaking plainly out, and
suppressing nothing, affirms this once, twice, yea often: writing that
“all things were made by Him;” and, “without Him was not one thing
made;” and, He was in the world, and the world was made by Him.” <span
id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670.md)

<span id="iii.XVI-p23"></span>And why marvel, if others have said
greater things of Him than He of Himself; since (what is more) in many
cases, what He showed forth by His deeds, by His words He uttered not
openly? Thus that it was Himself who made mankind He showed clearly even
by that blind man; but when He was speaking of our formation at the
beginning, He said not, “I made,” but “He who made them, made them male
and female.” <span id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671.md) Again, that He
created the world and all things therein, He demonstrated by the fishes,
by the wine, by the loaves, by the calm in the sea, by the sunbeam which
He averted on the Cross; and by very many things besides: but in words
He hath nowhere said this plainly, though His disciples are continually
declaring it, both John, and Paul, and Peter.

<span id="iii.XVI-p25"></span>For if they who night and day hear Him
discourse, and see Him work marvels; to whom He explained many things in
private, and gave so great power as even to raise the dead; whom He made
so perfect, as to forsake all things for Him: if even they, after so
great virtue and self-denial, had not strength to bear it all, before
the supply of the Spirit; how could the people of the Jews, being both
void of understanding, and far behind such excellency, and only by
hazard present when He did or said anything, how could they have been
persuaded but that He was alien from the God of all, unless he had
practised such great condescension throughout?

<span id="iii.XVI-p26"></span>For on this account we see that even when
He was abrogating the sabbath, He did not as of set purpose bring in
such *His* legislation, but He puts together many and various pleas of
defense. Now if, when He was about to cause one commandment to cease, He
used so much reserve in His language, <span
id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672.md) that He might not startle the hearers;
much more, when adding to the law, entire as it was, another entire code
of laws, did He require much management and attention, not to alarm
those who were then hearing Him.

<span id="iii.XVI-p28"></span>For this same cause, neither do we find
Him teaching everywhere clearly concerning His own Godhead. For if His
adding to the law was sure to perplex them so greatly, much more His
declaring Himself God.

<span id="iii.XVI-p29"></span>3. Wherefore many things are uttered by
Him, far below His proper dignity, and here when He is about to proceed
upon His addition to the law, He hath used abundance for correction
beforehand. For neither was it once only that He said, “I do not
abrogate the law,” but He both repeated it again, and added another and
a greater thing; in that, to the words, “Think not that I am come to
destroy,” He subjoined, “I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.”

<span id="iii.XVI-p30"></span>Now this not only obstructs the obstinacy
of the Jews, but stops also the mouths of those heretics, <span
id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673.md) who say that the old covenant is of
the devil. For if Christ came to destroy his tyranny, how is this
covenant not only not destroyed, but even fulfilled by Him? For He said
not only, “I do not destroy it;” though this had been enough; but “I
even fulfill it:” which are the words of one so far from opposing
himself, as to be even establishing it.

<span id="iii.XVI-p32"></span>And how, one may ask, did He not destroy
it? in what way did He rather fulfill either the law or the prophets?
The prophets He fulfilled, inasmuch as He confirmed by His actions all
that had been said concerning Him; wherefore also the evangelist used to
say in each case, “That it might be <span id="page_102">p. 102</span>
<span id="iii.XVI-Page_102"></span> fulfilled which was spoken by the
prophet.” Both when He was born, <span id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674.md)
and when the children sung that wondrous hymn to Him, and when He sat on
the ass, <span id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675.md) and in very many more
instances He worked this same fulfillment: all which things must have
been unfulfilled, if He had not come.

<span id="iii.XVI-p35"></span>But the law He fulfilled, not in one way
only, but in a second and third also. In one way, by transgressing none
of the precepts of the law. For that He did fulfill it all, hear what He
saith to John, “For thus it becometh us to fulfill all
righteousness.” <span id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md) And to the Jews
also He said, “Which of you convinceth me of sin.” <span
id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md) And to His disciples again, “The
prince of this world cometh, and findeth nothing in me.” <span
id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678.md) And the prophet too from the first had
said that “He did no sin.” <span id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679.md)

<span id="iii.XVI-p40"></span>This then was one sense in which He
fulfilled it. Another, that He did the same through us also; for this is
the marvel, that He not only Himself fulfilled it, but He granted this
to us likewise. Which thing Paul also declaring said, “Christ is the end
of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.” <span
id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680.md) And he said also, that “He judged sin
in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us
who walk not after the flesh.” <span id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md)
And again, “Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid! yea,
we establish the law.” <span id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md) For since
the law was laboring at this, to make man righteous, but had not power,
He came and brought in the way of righteousness by faith, and so
established that which the law desired: and what the law could not by
letters, this He accomplished by faith. On this account He saith, “I am
not come to destroy the law.”

<span id="iii.XVI-p44"></span>4. But if any one will inquire accurately,
he will find also another, a third sense, in which this hath been done.
Of what sort is it then? In the sense of that future code of laws, which
He was about to deliver to them.

<span id="iii.XVI-p45"></span>For His sayings were no repeal of the
former, but a drawing out, and filling up of them. Thus, “not to kill,”
is not annulled by the saying, Be not angry, but rather is filled up and
put in greater security: and so of all the others.

<span id="iii.XVI-p46"></span>Wherefore, you see, as He had before
unsuspectedly cast the seeds of this teaching; so at the time when from
His comparison of the old and new commandments, He would be more
distinctly suspected of placing them in opposition, He used His
corrective beforehand. For in a covert way He had indeed already
scattered those seeds, by what He had said. Thus, “Blessed are the
poor,” is the same as that we are not to be angry; and, “Blessed are the
pure in heart,” as not to “look upon a woman for lust;” and the “not
laying up treasures on earth,” harmonizes with, “Blessed are the
merciful;” and “to mourn” also, “to be persecuted” and “reviled,”
coincide with “entering in at the strait gate;” and, “to hunger and
thirst after righteousness,” is nothing else than that which He saith
afterwards, “Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye also
to them.” And having declared “the peace-maker blessed,” He again almost
said the same, when He gave command “to leave the gift,” and hasten to
reconciliation with him that was grieved, and about “agreeing with our
adversary.”

<span id="iii.XVI-p47"></span>But there He set down the rewards of them
that do right, here rather the punishments of them who neglect
practice. <span id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683.md) Wherefore as in that
place He said, “The meek shall inherit earth;” so here, “He who calleth
his brother fool, shall be in danger of hell-fire;” and there, “The pure
in heart shall see God;” here, he is a complete adulterer who looks
unchastely. And having there called “the peace-makers, sons of God;”
here He alarms us from another quarter, saying, “Lest at any time the
adversary deliver thee to the judge.” Thus also, whereas in the former
part He blesses them that mourn, and them that are persecuted; in the
following, establishing the very same point, He threatens destruction to
them that go not that way; for, “They that walk ‘in the broad way,’
saith He, ‘make their end there.’” And, “Ye cannot serve God and
mammon,” seems to me the same with, “Blessed are the merciful,” and,
“those that hunger after righteousness.”

<span id="iii.XVI-p49"></span>But as I said, since He is going to say
these things more clearly, and not only more clearly, but also to add
again more than had been already said (for He no longer merely seeks a
merciful man, but bids us give up even our coat; not simply a meek
person, but to turn also the other cheek to him that would smite us):
therefore He first takes away the apparent contradiction.

<span id="iii.XVI-p50"></span>On this account, then, as I have already
stated, He said this not once only, but once and again; in that to the
words, “Think not that I am come to destroy,” He added, “I am not come
to destroy, but to fulfill.”

<span id="iii.XVI-p51"></span>“For verily I say unto you, Till Heaven
<span id="page_103">p. 103</span> <span id="iii.XVI-Page_103"></span>
and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the
law, till all come to pass.” <span id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684.md)

<span id="iii.XVI-p53"></span>Now what He saith is like this: it cannot
be that it should remain unaccomplished, but the very least thing
therein must needs be fulfilled. Which thing He Himself performed, in
that He completed <span id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685.md) it with all
exactness.

<span id="iii.XVI-p55"></span>And here He signifies to us obscurely that
the fashion of the whole world is also being changed. Nor did He set it
down without purpose, but in order to arouse the hearer, and indicate,
that He was with just cause introducing another discipline; if at least
the very works of the creation are all to be transformed, and mankind is
to be called to another country, and to a higher way of practising how
to live. <span id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686.md)

<span id="iii.XVI-p57"></span>5. “Whosoever therefore shall break one of
these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called
least in the kingdom of Heaven.” <span id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687.md)

<span id="iii.XVI-p59"></span>Thus, having rid Himself of the evil
suspicion, and having stopped the mouths of them who would fain gainsay,
then at length He proceeds to alarm, and sets down a heavy, denunciation
in support of the enactments He was entering on.

<span id="iii.XVI-p60"></span>For as to His having said this in behalf
not of the ancient laws, but of those which He was proceeding to enact,
listen to what follows, “For I say unto you,” saith He, “Except your
righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and
Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of Heaven.” <span
id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md)

<span id="iii.XVI-p62"></span>For if He were threatening with regard to
the ancient laws, how said He, “except it shall exceed?” since they who
did just the same as those ancients, could not exceed them on the score
of righteousness.

<span id="iii.XVI-p63"></span>But of what kind was the required excess?
Not to be angry, not even to look upon a woman unchastely.

<span id="iii.XVI-p64"></span>For what cause then doth He call these
commandments “least,” though they were so great and high? Because He
Himself was about to introduce the enactment of them; for as He humbled
Himself, and speaks of Himself frequently with measure, so likewise of
His own enactments, hereby again teaching us to be modest in everything.
And besides, since there seemed to be some suspicion of novelty, He
ordered His discourse for a while with reserve. <span
id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md)

<span id="iii.XVI-p66"></span>But when thou hearest, “least in the
kingdom of Heaven,” surmise thou nothing but hell and torments. For He
was used to mean by “the kingdom,” not merely the enjoyment thereof, but
also the time of the resurrection, and that awful coming. And how could
it be reasonable, that while he who called his brother fool, and
trangressed but one commandment, falls into hell; the breaker of them
all, and instigator of others to the same, should be within the kingdom.
This therefore is not what He means, but that such a one will be at that
time least, that is, cast out, last. And he that is last will surely
then fall into hell. For, being God, He foreknew the laxity of the many,
He foreknew that some would think these sayings were merely
hyperbolical, and would argue about the laws, and say, What, if any one
call another a fool, is he punished? If one merely look on a woman, doth
he become an adulterer? For this very cause He, destroying such
insolence beforehand, hath set down the strongest denunciation against
either sort, as well them who transgress, as them who lead on others so
to do.

<span id="iii.XVI-p67"></span>Knowing then His threat as we do, let us
neither ourselves transgress, nor discourage such as are disposed to
keep these things.

<span id="iii.XVI-p68"></span>“But whosoever shall do and teach,” saith
He, “shall be called great.”

<span id="iii.XVI-p69"></span>For not to ourselves alone, should we be
profitable, but to others also; since neither is the reward as great for
him who guides himself aright, as for one who with himself adds also
another. For as teaching without doing condemns the teacher (for “thou
which teachest another,” it is said, “teachest thou not thyself” <span
id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690) ?.md) so doing but not guiding others,
lessens our reward. One ought therefore to be chief in either work, and
having first set one’s self right, thus to proceed also to the care of
the rest. For on this account He Himself hath set the doing before the
teaching; to intimate that so most of all may one be able to teach, but
in no other way. For one will be told, “Physician, heal thyself.” <span
id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691.md) Since he who cannot teach himself, yet
attempts to set others right, will have many to ridicule him. Or rather
such a one will have no power to teach at all, his actions uttering
their voice against him. But if he be complete in both respects, “he
shall be called great in the kingdom of Heaven.”

<span id="iii.XVI-p72"></span>6. “For I say unto you, Except your
righteousness shall exceed the righteousness <span id="page_104">p.
104</span> <span id="iii.XVI-Page_104"></span> of the Scribes and
Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of Heaven.” <span
id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692.md)

<span id="iii.XVI-p74"></span>Here by righteousness He means the whole
of virtue; even as also discoursing of Job, He said, “He was a blameless
man, righteous.” <span id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md) According to
the same signification of the word, Paul also called that man
“righteous” for whom, as he said, no law is even set. “For,” saith he,
“a law is not made for a righteous man.” <span
id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md) And in many other places too one might
find this name standing for virtue in general.

<span id="iii.XVI-p77"></span>But observe, I pray thee, the increase of
grace; in that He will have His newly-come disciples better than the
teachers in the old covenant. For by “Scribes and Pharisees” here, He
meant not merely the lawless, but the well-doers. For, were they not
doing well, He would not have said they have a righteousness; neither
would He have compared the unreal to the real.

<span id="iii.XVI-p78"></span>And observe also here, how He commends the
old law, by making a comparison between it and the other; which kind of
thing implies it to be of the same tribe and kindred. For *more* and
*less*, is in the same kind. He doth not, you see, find fault with the
old law, but will have it made stricter. Whereas, had it been
evil, <span id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695.md) He would not have required
more of it; He would not have made it more perfect, but would have cast
it out.

<span id="iii.XVI-p80"></span>And how one may say, if it be such, doth
it not bring us into the Kingdom? It doth not now bring in them who live
after the coming of Christ, favored as they are with more strength, and
bound to strive for greater things: since as to its own foster-children,
them it doth bring in one and all. Yea, for “many shall come,” saith He,
“from east and west, and shall lie down in the bosoms of Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob.” <span id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696.md) And Lazarus also
receiving the great prize, is shown dwelling in Abraham’s bosom. And
all, as many as have shone forth with excellency in the old
dispensation, shone by it, every one of them. And Christ Himself, had it
been in anything evil or alien from Him, would not have fulfilled it all
when He came. For if only to attract the Jews He was doing this, and not
in order to prove it akin to the new law, and concurrent therewith;
wherefore did He not also fulfill the laws and customs of the Gentiles,
that He might attract the Gentiles also?

<span id="iii.XVI-p82"></span>So that from all considerations it is
clear, that not from any badness in itself doth it fail to bring us in,
but because it is now the season of higher precepts.

<span id="iii.XVI-p83"></span>And if it be more imperfect than the new,
neither doth this imply it to be evil: since upon this principle the new
law itself will be in the very same case. Because in truth our knowledge
of this, when compared with that which is to come, is a sort of partial
and imperfect thing, and is done away on the coming of that other. “For
when,” saith He, “that which is perfect is come, then that which is in
part shall be done away:” <span id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697.md) even
as it befell the old law through the new. Yet we are not to blame the
new law for this, though that also gives place on our attaining unto the
Kingdom: for “then,” saith He, “that which is in part shall be done
away:” but for all this we call it great.

<span id="iii.XVI-p85"></span>Since then both the rewards thereof are
greater, and the power given by the Spirit more abundant, in reason it
requires our graces to be greater also. For it is no longer “a land that
floweth with milk and honey,” nor a comfortable <span
id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698.md) old age, nor many children, nor corn
and wine, and flocks and herds: but Heaven, and the good things in the
Heavens, and adoption and brotherhood with the Only-Begotten, and to
partake of the inheritance and to be glorified and to reign with Him,
and those unnumbered rewards. And as to our having received more
abundant help, hear thou Paul, when he saith, “There is therefore no
condemnation now to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after
the flesh, but after the Spirit: <span id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699.md)
for the law of the Spirit of life hath made me free from the law of sin
and death.” <span id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700.md)

<span id="iii.XVI-p89"></span>7. And now after threatening the
transgressors, and setting great rewards for them that do right, and
signifying that He justly requires of us something beyond the former
measures; He from this point begins to legislate, not simply, but by way
of comparison with the ancient ordinances, desiring to intimate these
two things: first, that not as contending with the former, but rather in
great harmony with them, He is making these enactments; next, that it
was meet and very seasonable for Him to add thereto these second
precepts.

<span id="iii.XVI-p90"></span>And that this may be made yet clearer, let
us hearken to the words of the Legislator. What then doth He Himself
say?

<span id="iii.XVI-p91"></span>“Ye have heard that it was said to them of
old time, Thou shalt not kill.” <span id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701.md)

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span> <span id="iii.XVI-Page_105"></span>

<span id="iii.XVI-p93"></span>And yet it was Himself who gave those laws
also, but so far He states them impersonally. For if on the one hand He
had said, “Ye have heard that I said to them of old,” the saying would
have been hard to receive, and would have stood in the way of all the
hearers. If again, on the other hand, after having said, “Ye have heard
that it was said to them of old by my Father,” He had added, “But I
say,” He would have seemed to be taking yet more on Himself.

<span id="iii.XVI-p94"></span>Wherefore He hath simply stated it, making
out thereby one point only; the proof that in fitting season He had come
saying these things. For by the words, “It was said to them of old,” He
pointed out the length of the time, since they received this
commandment. And this He did to shame the hearer, shrinking from the
advance to the higher class of His commandments; as though a teacher
should say to a child that was indolent, “Knowest thou not how long a
time thou hast consumed in learning syllables?” This then He also
covertly intimates by the expression, “them of old time,” and thus for
the future summons them on to the higher order of His instructions: as
if He had said, “Ye are learning these lessons long enough, and you must
henceforth press on to such as are higher than these.”

<span id="iii.XVI-p95"></span>And it is well that He doth not disturb
the order of the commandments, but begins first with that which comes
earlier, with which the law also began. Yea, for this too suits with one
showing the harmony between them.

<span id="iii.XVI-p96"></span>“But I say unto you, that whosoever is
angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the
judgment.” <span id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702.md)

<span id="iii.XVI-p98"></span>Seest thou authority in perfection? Seest
thou a bearing suited to a legislator? Why, which among prophets ever
spake on this wise? which among righteous men? which among patriarchs?
None; but, “Thus saith the Lord.” But the Son not so. Because they were
publishing their Master’s commands, He His Father’s. And when I say,
“His Father’s,” I mean His own. “For mine,” saith He, “are thine, and
thine are mine.” <span id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703.md) And they had
their fellow-servants to legislate for, He His own servants.

<span id="iii.XVI-p100"></span>Let us now ask those who reject the law,
“is, ‘Be not angry’ contrary to ‘Do no murder’? or is not the one
commandment the completion and the development of the other?” Clearly
the one is the fulfilling of the other, and that is greater on this very
account. Since he who is not stirred up to anger, will much more refrain
from murder; and he who bridles wrath will much more keep his hands to
himself. For wrath is the root of murder. And you see that He who cuts
up the root will much more remove the branches; or rather, will not
permit them so much as to shoot out at all. Not therefore to abolish the
law did He make these enactments, but for the more complete observation
of it. For with what design did the law enjoin these things? Was it not,
that no one might slay his neighbor? It follows, that he who was
opposing the law would have to enjoin murder. For to murder, were the
contrary to doing no murder. But if He doth not suffer one even to be
angry, the mind of the law is established by Him more completely. For he
that studies to avoid murder will not refrain from it equally with him
that hath put away even anger; this latter being further removed from
the crime.

<span id="iii.XVI-p101"></span>8. But that we may convict them in
another way also, let us bring forward all their allegations. What then
do they affirm? They assert that the God who made the world, who “makes
His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, who sends the rain on the
just and on the unjust,” is in some sense an evil being. <span
id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704) But the more moderate (forsooth.md) among
them, though declining this, yet while they affirm Him to be just, they
deprive Him of being good. And some other one, who is not, nor made any
of the things that are, they assign for a Father to Christ. And they say
that he, who is not good, abides in his own, and preserves what are his
own; but that He, that is good, seeks what are another’s, and desires of
a sudden to become a Saviour to them whose Creator He was not. <span
id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705.md) Seest thou the children of the devil,
how they speak out of the fountain of their father, alienating the work
of creation from God: while John cries out, “He came <span
id="page_106">p. 106</span> <span id="iii.XVI-Page_106"></span> unto His
own,” and, “The world was made by Him?” <span
id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706.md)

<span id="iii.XVI-p105"></span>In the next place, they criticise the law
in the old covenant, which bids put out “an eye for an eye,” and “a
tooth for a tooth;” <span id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707.md) and
straightway they insult and say, “Why, how can He be good who speaks
so?”

<span id="iii.XVI-p107"></span>What then do we say in answer to this?
That it is the highest kind of philanthropy. For He made this law, not
that we might strike out one another’s eyes, but that fear of suffering
by others might restrain us from doing any such thing to them. As
therefore He threatened the Ninevites with overthrow, not that He might
destroy them, (for had that been His will, He ought to have been
silent), but that He might by fear make them better, and so quiet His
wrath: so also hath He appointed a punishment for those who wantonly
assail the eyes of others, that if good principle dispose them not to
refrain from such cruelty, fear may restrain them from injuring their
neighbors’ sight.

<span id="iii.XVI-p108"></span>And if this be cruelty, it is cruelty
also for the murderer to be restrained, and the adulterer checked. But
these are the sayings of senseless men, and of those that are mad to the
extreme of madness. For I, so far from saying that this comes of
cruelty, should say, that the contrary to this would be unlawful,
according to men’s reckoning. And whereas, thou sayest, “Because He
commanded to pluck out “an eye for an eye,” therefore He is cruel;” I
say, that if He had not given this commandment, then He would have
seemed, in the judgment of most men, to be that which thou sayest He is.

<span id="iii.XVI-p109"></span>For let us suppose that this law had been
altogether done away, and that no one feared the punishment ensuing
thereupon, but that license had been given to all the wicked to follow
their own disposition in all security, to adulterers, and to
murderers, <span id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708.md) to perjured persons,
and to parricides; would not all things have been turned upside down?
would not cities, market-places, and houses, sea and land, and the whole
world, have been filled with unnumbered pollutions and murders? Every
one sees it. For if, when there are laws, and fear, and threatening, our
evil dispositions are hardly checked; were even this security taken
away, what is there to prevent men’s choosing vice? and what degree of
mischief would not then come revelling upon the whole of human life?

<span id="iii.XVI-p111"></span>The rather, since cruelty lies not only
in allowing the bad to do what they will, but in another thing too quite
as much; to overlook, and leave uncared for, him who hath done no wrong,
but who is without cause or reason suffering ill. For tell me; were any
one to gather together wicked men from all quarters, and arm them with
swords, and bid them go about the whole city, and massacre all that came
in their way, could there be anything more like a wild beast than he?
And what if some other should bind, and confine with the utmost
strictness those whom that man had armed, and should snatch from those
lawless hands them, who were on the point of being butchered; could
anything be greater humanity than this?

<span id="iii.XVI-p112"></span>Now then, I bid thee transfer these
examples to the law likewise; for He that commands to pluck out “an eye
for an eye,” hath laid the fear as a kind of strong chain upon the souls
of the bad, and so resembles him, who detains those assassins in prison;
whereas he who appoints no punishment for them, doth all but arm them by
such security, and acts the part of that other, who was putting the
swords in their hands, and letting them loose over the whole city.

<span id="iii.XVI-p113"></span>Seest thou not, how the commandments, so
far from coming of cruelty, come rather of abounding mercy? And if on
account of these thou callest the Lawgiver grievous, and hard to bear
with; tell me which sort of command is the more toilsome and grievous,
“Do no murder,” or, “Be not even angry”? Which is more in extreme, he
who exacts a penalty for murder, or for mere anger? He who subjects the
adulterer to vengeance after the fact, or he who enjoins a penalty even
for the very desire, and that penalty everlasting? See ye not how their
reasoning comes round to the very contrary? how the God of the old
covenant, whom they call cruel, will be found mild and meek: and He of
the new, whom they acknowledged to be good, will be hard and grievous,
according to their madness? Whereas we say, that there is but one and
the same Legislator of either covenant, who dispensed all meetly, and
adapted to the difference of the times the difference between the two
systems of law. Therefore neither are the first commandments cruel, nor
the second hard and grievous, but all of one and the same providential
care.

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span> <span id="iii.XVI-Page_107"></span>

<span id="iii.XVI-p114"></span>For that He Himself gave the old covenant
also, hear the affirmation of the prophet, or rather (so we must speak),
of Him who is both the one and the other: “I will make a covenant with
you, not according to the covenant which I made with your
fathers.” <span id="fr_709"></span>[710](#fn_709.md)

<span id="iii.XVI-p116"></span>But if he receive not this, who is
diseased with the Manichæan doctrines, <span
id="fr_710"></span>[711](#fn_710.md) let him hear Paul saying the very same
in another place, “For Abraham had two sons, one by the bondmaid, and
another by the freewoman; and these are two covenants.” <span
id="fr_711"></span>[712](#fn_711.md) As therefore in that case the wives
are different, the husband the same; so here too the covenants are two,
the Lawgiver one.

<span id="iii.XVI-p119"></span>And to prove to thee that it was of one
and the same mildness; in the one He saith, “An eye for an eye,” but in
this other,

<span id="iii.XVI-p120"></span>“If one smite thee on thy right cheek,
turn to him the other also.” <span id="fr_712"></span>[713](#fn_712.md)

<span id="iii.XVI-p122"></span>For as in that case He checks him that
doth the wrong with the fear of this suffering, even so also in this.
“How so,” it may be said, “when He bids turn to him the other cheek
also?” Nay, what of that? Since not to take away his fear did He enjoin
this, but as charging yourself to allow him to take his fill entirely.
Neither did He say, that the other continues unpunished, but, “do not
thou punish;” at once both enhancing the fear of him that smiteth, if he
persist, and comforting him who is smitten.

<span id="iii.XVI-p123"></span>9. But these things we have said, as one
might say them incidentally, concerning all the commandments. Now we
must go on to that which is before us, and keep to the thread of what
had been affirmed. “He that is angry with his brother without a cause
shall be in danger of the judgment:” so He speaks. Thus He hath not
altogether taken the thing away: first, because it is not possible,
being a man, to be freed from passions: we may indeed get the dominion
over them, but to be altogether without them is out of the question.

<span id="iii.XVI-p124"></span>Next, because this passion is even
useful, if we know how to use it at the suitable time. <span
id="fr_713"></span>[714](#fn_713.md) See, for instance, what great good was
wrought by that anger of Paul, which he felt against the Corinthians, on
that well-known occasion; and how, as it delivered them from a grievous
pest, so by the same means again he recovered the people of the
Galatians likewise, which had fallen aside; and others too beside these.
What then is the proper time for anger? When we are not avenging
ourselves, but checking others in their lawless freaks, or forcing them
to attend in their negligence.

<span id="iii.XVI-p126"></span>And what is the unsuitable time? When we
do so as avenging ourselves: which Paul also forbidding, said “Avenge
not yourselves, dearly beloved, but rather give place unto wrath.” <span
id="fr_714"></span>[715](#fn_714.md) When we are contending for riches:
yea, for this hath he also taken away, where he saith, “Why do ye not
rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be
defrauded?” <span id="fr_715"></span>[716](#fn_715.md) For as this last
sort is superfluous, so is the first necessary and profitable. But most
men do the contrary; becoming like wild beasts when they are injured
themselves, but remiss and cowardly when they see despite done to
another: both which are just opposite to the laws of the Gospel.

<span id="iii.XVI-p129"></span>Being angry then is not a transgression,
but being so unseasonably. For this cause the prophet also said, “Be ye
angry, and sin not.” <span id="fr_716"></span>[717](#fn_716.md)

<span id="iii.XVI-p131"></span>10. “And whosoever shall say to his
brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council.”

<span id="iii.XVI-p132"></span>By the council in this place He means the
tribunal of the Hebrews: and He hath mentioned this now, on purpose that
He might not seem everywhere to play the stranger and innovator.

<span id="iii.XVI-p133"></span>But this word, “Raca,” is not an
expression of a great insolence, but rather of some contempt and slight
on the part of the speaker. For as we, giving orders either to our
servants, or to any very inferior person, say, “Away with thee; you
here, tell such an one:” <span id="fr_717"></span>[718](#fn_717.md) so they
who make use of the Syrians’ language say, “Raca,” putting that word
instead of “thou.” But God, the lover of man, roots up even the least
faults, commanding us to behave to one another in seemly manner, and
with due respect; and this with a view of destroying hereby also the
greater.

<span id="iii.XVI-p135"></span>“But whosoever shall say, Thou fool,
shall be in danger of hell fire.” <span
id="fr_718"></span>[719](#fn_718.md)

<span id="iii.XVI-p137"></span>To many this commandment hath appeared
grievous and galling, if for a mere word we are really to pay so great a
penalty. And some even say that it was spoken rather hyperbolically. But
I fear lest, when we have deceived ourselves with words here, we may in
deeds there suffer that extreme punishment.

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span> <span id="iii.XVI-Page_108"></span>

<span id="iii.XVI-p138"></span>For wherefore, tell me, doth the
commandment seem overburdensome? Knowest thou not that most punishments
and most sins have their beginning from words? Yea, for by words are
blasphemies, and denials are by words, and revilings, and reproaches,
and perjuries, and bearing false witness. <span
id="fr_719"></span>[720](#fn_719.md) Regard not then its being a mere word,
but whether it have not much danger, this do thou inquire. Art thou
ignorant that in the season of enmity, when wrath is inflamed, and the
soul kindled, even the least thing appears great, and what is not very
reproachful is counted intolerable? And often these little things have
given birth even to murder, and overthrown whole cities. For just as
where friendship is, even grievous things are light, so where enmity
lies beneath, very trifles appear intolerable. And however simply a word
be spoken, it is surmised to have been spoken with an evil meaning. And
as in fire: if there be but a small spark, though thousands of planks
lie by, it doth not easily lay hold of them; but if the flame have waxed
strong and high, it readily seizes not planks only, but stones, and all
materials that fall in its way; and by what things it is usually
quenched, by the same it is kindled the more (for some say that at such
a time not only wood and tow, and the other combustibles, but even water
darted forth upon it doth but fan its power the more); so is it also
with anger; whatever any one may say, becomes food in a moment for this
evil conflagration. All which kind of evils Christ checking beforehand,
had condemned first him that is angry without a cause to the judgment,
(this being the very reason why He said, “He that is angry shall be in
danger of the judgment”); then him that saith “Raca,” to the council.
But as yet these are no great things; for the punishments are here.
Therefore for him who calleth “fool” He hath added the fire of hell, now
for the first time mentioning the name of hell. For having before
discoursed much of the kingdom, not until then did He mention this;
implying, that the former comes of His own love and indulgence towards
man, this latter of our negligence.

<span id="iii.XVI-p140"></span>11. And see how He proceeds by little and
little in His punishments, all but excusing Himself unto thee, and
signifying that His desire indeed is to threaten nothing of the kind,
but that we drag Him on to such denunciations. For observe: “I bade
thee,” saith He, “not be angry for nought, because thou art in danger of
the judgment. Thou hast despised the former commandment: see what anger
hath produced; it hath led thee on straightway to insult, for thou hast
called thy brother ‘Raca.’ Again, I set another punishment, ‘the
council.’ If thou overlook even this, and proceed to that which is more
grievous, I visit thee no longer with these finite punishments, but with
the undying penalty of hell, lest after this thou shouldest break
forth <span id="fr_720"></span>[721](#fn_720.md) even to murder.” For there
is nothing, nothing in the world more intolerable than insolence; it is
what hath very great power <span id="fr_721"></span>[722](#fn_721.md) to
sting a man’s soul. But when the word too which is spoken is in itself
more wounding than the insolence, the blaze becomes twice as great.
Think it not then a light thing to call another “fool.” For when of that
which separates us from the brutes, and by which especially we are human
beings, namely, the mind and the understanding,—when of this thou hast
robbed thy brother, thou hast deprived him of all his nobleness.

<span id="iii.XVI-p143"></span>Let us not then regard the words merely,
but realizing the things themselves, and his feeling, let us consider
how great a wound is made by this word, and unto how much evil it
proceeds. For this cause Paul likewise cast out of the kingdom not only
“the adulterous” and “the effeminate,” but “the revilers” <span
id="fr_722"></span>[723](#fn_722.md) also. And with great reason: for the
insolent man mars all the beauty of charity, and casts upon his neighbor
unnumbered ills, and works up lasting enmities, and tears asunder the
members of Christ, and is daily driving away that peace which God so
desires: giving much vantage ground unto the devil by his injurious
ways, and making him the stronger. Therefore Christ Himself, cutting out
the sinews of the devil’s power, brought in this law.

<span id="iii.XVI-p145"></span>For indeed He makes much account of love:
this being above all things the mother of every good, and the badge of
His disciples, and the bond which holds together our whole condition.
With reason therefore doth He remove with great earnestness the roots
and the sources of that hatred which utterly spoils it.

<span id="iii.XVI-p146"></span>Think not therefore that these sayings
are in any wise hyperbolical, but consider the good done by them, and
admire the mildness of these laws. For there is nothing for which God
takes so much pains, as this; that we should be united and knit together
one with another. Therefore both in His own person, and by His
disciples, as well those in the <span id="page_109">p. 109</span> <span
id="iii.XVI-Page_109"></span> Old, as in the New Testament, He makes so
much account of this commandment; and is a severe avenger and punisher
of those who despise the duty. For in truth nothing so effectually gives
entrance and root to all wickedness, as the taking away of love.
Wherefore He also said, “When iniquity abounds, the love of the many
shall wax cold.” <span id="fr_723"></span>[724](#fn_723.md) Thus Cain
became his brother’s murderer; thus Esau; thus Joseph’s brethren; thus
our unnumbered crimes have come revelling in, this bond being
dissevered. You see why He Himself also roots out whatever things injure
this, on every side, with great exactness.

<span id="iii.XVI-p148"></span>12. Neither doth He stop at those
precepts only which have been mentioned, but adds also others more than
those: whereby He signifies how much account He makes thereof. Namely,
having threatened by “the council,” by “the judgment,” and by “hell,” He
added other sayings again in harmony with the former, saying thus:

<span id="iii.XVI-p149"></span>“If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and
there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; leave there
thy gift before the altar, and go away; <span
id="fr_724"></span>[725](#fn_724.md) first be reconciled to thy brother,
and then come and offer thy gift.” <span
id="fr_725"></span>[726](#fn_725.md)

<span id="iii.XVI-p152"></span>O goodness! O exceeding love to man! He
makes no account of the honor due unto Himself, for the sake of our love
towards our neighbor; implying that not at all from any enmity, nor out
of any desire to punish, had He uttered those former threatenings, but
out of very tender affection. For what can be milder than these sayings?
“Let my service,” saith he, “be interrupted, that thy love may continue;
since this also is a sacrifice, thy being reconciled to thy brother.”
Yea, for this cause He said not, “after the offering,” or “before the
offering;” but, while the very gift lies there, and when the sacrifice
is already beginning, He sends thee to be reconciled to thy brother; and
neither after removing that which lies before us, <span
id="fr_726"></span>[727](#fn_726.md) nor before presenting the gift, but
while it lies in the midst, He bids thee hasten thither.

<span id="iii.XVI-p154"></span>With what motive then doth He command so
to do, and wherefore? These two ends, as it appears to me, He is hereby
shadowing out and providing for. First, as I have said, His will is to
point out that He highly values charity, <span
id="fr_727"></span>[728](#fn_727.md) and considers it to be the greatest
sacrifice: and that without it He doth not receive even that other;
next, He is imposing such a necessity of reconciliation, as admits of no
excuse. For whoso hath been charged not to offer before he be
reconciled, will hasten, if not for love of his neighbor, yet, that this
may not lie unconsecrated, <span id="fr_728"></span>[729](#fn_728.md) to
run unto him who hath been grieved, and do away the enmity. For this
cause He hath also expressed it all most significantly, to alarm and
thoroughly to awaken him. Thus, when He had said, “Leave thy gift,” He
stayed not at this, but added, “before the altar” (by the very place
again causing him to shudder); “and go away.” And He said not merely,
“Go away,” but He added, “first, and then come and offer thy gift.” By
all these things making it manifest, that this table receives not them
that are at enmity with each other.

<span id="iii.XVI-p157"></span>Let the initiated hear this, as many as
draw nigh in enmity: and let the uninitiated hear too: yea, for the
saying hath some relation to them also. For they too offer a gift and a
sacrifice: prayer, I mean, and alms-giving. For as to this also being a
sacrifice, hear what the prophet saith: “A sacrifice of praise will
glorify me;” <span id="fr_729"></span>[730](#fn_729.md) and again,
“Sacrifice to God a sacrifice of praise;” <span
id="fr_730"></span>[731](#fn_730.md) and, “The lifting up of mine hands is
an evening sacrifice.” <span id="fr_731"></span>[732](#fn_731.md) So that
if it be but a prayer, which thou art offering in such a frame of mind,
it were better to leave thy prayer, and become reconciled to thy
brother, and then to offer thy prayer.

<span id="iii.XVI-p161"></span>For to this end were all things done: to
this end even God became man, and took order for all those works, that
He might set us at one.

<span id="iii.XVI-p162"></span>And whereas in this place He is sending
the wrong doer to the sufferer, in His prayer He leads the sufferer to
the wrong doer, and reconciles them. For as there He saith, “Forgive men
their debts;” so here, “If he hath ought against thee, go thy way unto
him.”

<span id="iii.XVI-p163"></span>Or rather, even here too He seems to me
to be sending the injured person: and for some such reason He said not,
“Reconcile thyself to thy brother,” but, “Be thou rec <span
id="page_110">p. 110</span> <span id="iii.XVI-Page_110"></span>
onciled.” And while the saying seems to pertain to the aggressor, the
whole of it really pertains to him that is aggrieved. Thus, “If thou art
reconciled to him,” saith Christ, “through thy love to him thou wilt
have me also propitious, and wilt be able to offer thy sacrifice with
great confidence. But if thou art still irritated, consider that even I
readily command that which is mine to be lightly esteemed, that ye may
become friends; and let these thoughts be soothing to thine anger.”

<span id="iii.XVI-p164"></span>And He said not, “When thou hast suffered
any of the greater wrongs, then be reconciled; but, “Though it be some
trifle that he hath against thee.” And He added not, “Whether justly or
unjustly;” but merely, “If he hath ought against thee.” For though it be
justly, not even in that case oughtest thou to protract the enmity;
since Christ also was justly angered with us, yet nevertheless He gave
Himself for us to be slain, “not imputing those trespasses.” <span
id="fr_732"></span>[733](#fn_732.md)

<span id="iii.XVI-p166"></span>For this cause Paul also, when urging us
in another way to reconciliation, said, “Let not the sun go down upon
your wrath.” <span id="fr_733"></span>[734](#fn_733.md) For much as Christ
by this argument of the sacrifice, so there Paul by that of the day, is
urging us on to the self-same point. Because in truth he fears the
night, lest it overtake him that is smitten alone, and make the wound
greater. For whereas in the day there are many to distract, and draw him
off; in the night, when he is alone, and is thinking it over by himself,
the waves swell, and the storm becomes greater. Therefore Paul, you see,
to prevent this, would fain commit him to the night already reconciled,
that the devil may after that have no opportunity, from his solitude, to
rekindle the furnace of his wrath, and make it fiercer. Thus also Christ
permits not, though it be ever so little delay, lest, the sacrifice
being accomplished, such an one become more remiss, procrastinating from
day to day: for He knows that the case requires very speedy treatment.
And as a skillful physician exhibits not only the preventives of our
diseases, but their correctives also, even so doth He likewise. Thus, to
forbid our calling “fool,” is a preventive of enmity; but to command
reconciliation is a means of removing the diseases that ensue on the
enmity.

<span id="iii.XVI-p168"></span>And mark how both commands are set forth
with earnestness. For as in the former case He threatened hell, so here
He receives not the gift before the reconciliation, indicating great
displeasure, and by all these methods destroying both the root and the
produce.

<span id="iii.XVI-p169"></span>And first of all He saith, “Be not
angry;” and after that, “revile not.” For indeed both these are
augmented, the one by the other: from enmity is reviling, from reviling
enmity. On this account then He heals now the root, and now the fruit;
hindering indeed the evil from ever springing up in the first instance:
but if perchance it may have sprouted up and borne its most evil fruit,
then by all means He burns it down the more.

<span id="iii.XVI-p170"></span>13. Therefore, you see, having mentioned,
first the judgment, then the council, then hell, and having spoken of
His own sacrifice, He adds other topics again, thus speaking:

<span id="iii.XVI-p171"></span>“Agree with thine adversary quickly,
whilst thou art in the way with him.” <span
id="fr_734"></span>[735](#fn_734.md)

<span id="iii.XVI-p173"></span>That is, that thou mayest not say, “What
then, if I am injured;” “what if I am plundered, and dragged too before
the tribunal?” even this occasion and excuse He hath taken away: for He
commands us not even so to be at enmity. Then, since this injunction was
great, He draws His advice from the things present, which are wont to
restrain the grosser sort more than the future. “Why, what sayest thou?”
saith He. “That thine adversary is stronger, and doeth thee wrong? Of
course then he will wrong thee more, if thou do not make it up, but art
forced to go into court. For in the former case, by giving up some
money, thou wilt keep thy person free; but when thou art come under the
sentence of the judge, thou wilt both be bound, and pay the utmost
penalty. But if thou avoid the contest there, thou wilt reap two good
results: first, not having to suffer anything painful: and secondly,
that the good done will be thereafter thine own doing, and no longer the
effect of compulsion on his part. But if thou wilt not be ruled by these
sayings, thou wrongest not him, so much as thyself.”

<span id="iii.XVI-p174"></span>And see here also how He hastens him; for
having said, “Agree with thine adversary,” He added, “quickly;” and He
was not satisfied with this, but even of this quickness He hath required
a further increase, saying, “Whilst thou art in the way with him;”
pressing and hastening him hereby with great earnestness. For nothing
doth so much turn our life upside down, as delay and procrastination in
the performance of our good works. Nay, this hath often caused us to
lose all. Therefore, as Paul for his part saith, “Before the sun set, do
away the enmity;” and as He Himself had said above, <span
id="page_111">p. 111</span> <span id="iii.XVI-Page_111"></span> “Before
the offering is completed, be reconciled;” so He saith in this place
also, “Quickly, whilst thou art in the way with him,” before thou art
come to the doors of the court; before thou standest at the bar and art
come to be thenceforth under the sway of him that judgeth. Since, before
entering in, thou hast all in thine own control; but if thou set thy
foot on that threshold, thou wilt not by ever so earnest efforts be able
to arrange thy matters at thy will, having come under the constraint of
another.

<span id="iii.XVI-p175"></span>But what is it “to agree?” He means
either, “consent rather to suffer wrong?” or, “so plead the cause, as if
thou wert in the place of the other;” that thou mayest not corrupt
justice by self-love, but rather, deliberating on another’s cause as
thine own, mayest so proceed to deliver thy vote in this matter. And if
this be a great thing, marvel not; since with this view did He set forth
all those His blessings, that having beforehand smoothed and prepared
the hearer’s soul, he might render it apter to receive all His
enactments.

<span id="iii.XVI-p176"></span>Now some say that He obscurely signifies
the devil himself, under the name of the adversary; and bids us have
nothing of his, (for this, they say, is to “agree” with him): no
compromise being possible after our departure hence, nor anything
awaiting us, but that punishment, from which no prayers can deliver. But
to me He seems to be speaking of the judges in this world, and of the
way to the court of justice, and of this prison.

<span id="iii.XVI-p177"></span>For after he had abashed men by higher
things, and things future, he alarms them also by such as are in this
life. Which thing Paul also doth, using both the future and the present
to sway his hearer: as when, deterring from wickedness, he points out to
him that is inclined to evil, the ruler armed: thus saying, “But if thou
do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain;
for he is a minister of God.” <span id="fr_735"></span>[736](#fn_735.md)
And again, enjoining us to be subject unto him, he sets forth not the
fear of God only, but the threatening also of the other party, and his
watchful care. “For ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but
also for conscience sake.” <span id="fr_736"></span>[737](#fn_736.md)
Because the more irrational, as I have already said, are wont to be
sooner corrected by these things, things which appear and are at hand.
Wherefore Christ also made mention, not of hell only, but also of a
court of justice, and of being dragged thither, and of the prison, and
of all the suffering there; by all these means destroying the roots of
murder. For he who neither reviles, nor goes to law, nor prolongs
enmity, how will he ever commit murder? So that from hence also it is
evident, that in the advantage of our neighbor stands our own advantage.
For he that agrees with his adversary, will benefit himself much more;
becoming free, by his own act, from courts of law, and prisons, and the
wretchedness that is there.

<span id="iii.XVI-p180"></span>14. Let us then be obedient to His
sayings; let us not oppose ourselves, nor be contentious; for first of
all, even antecedently to their rewards, these injunctions have their
pleasure and profit in themselves. And if to the more part they seem to
be burdensome, and the trouble which they cause, great; have it in thy
mind that thou art doing it for Christ’s sake, and the pain will be
pleasant. For if we maintain this way of reckoning at all times, we
shall experience nothing burdensome, but great will be the pleasure we
reap from every quarter; for our toil will no longer seem toil, but by
how much it is enhanced, so much the sweeter and pleasanter doth it
grow.

<span id="iii.XVI-p181"></span>When therefore the custom of evil things,
and the desire of wealth, keep on bewitching thee; do thou war against
them with that mode of thinking which tells us, “Great is the reward we
shall receive, for despising the pleasure which is but for a season;”
and say to thy soul; “Art thou quite dejected because I defraud thee of
pleasure? Nay, be of good cheer, for I am introducing thee into Heaven.
Thou doest it not for man’s sake, but for God’s. Be patient therefore a
little while, and thou shalt see how great is the gain. Endure for the
present life, and thou shalt receive an unspeakable confidence.” For if
we would thus discourse with our own soul, and not only consider that
which is burdensome in virtue, but take account also of the crown that
comes thereof, we shall quickly withdraw it from all wickedness.

<span id="iii.XVI-p182"></span>For if the devil, holding out pleasure
for a season, but pain for ever, is yet strong, and prevails; seeing our
case is just the reverse in these matters, the labor temporary, the
pleasure and profit immortal, what plea shall we have, if we follow not
virtue after so great encouragement? Why, the object of our labors is
enough to set against all, and our clear persuasion that for God’s sake
we are enduring all this. For if one having the king his debtor, thinks
he hath sufficient security for all his life; consider how great will he
be, who hath made the Gracious and Everlasting God a debtor to himself,
for good deeds both small and great. Do not then allege to me labors and
sweats; for not by the hope only <span id="page_112">p. 112</span> <span
id="iii.XVI-Page_112"></span> of the things to come, but in another way
also, God hath made virtue easy, assisting us everywhere, and putting
His hand to our work. And if thou wilt only contribute a little zeal,
everything else follows. For to this end He will have thee too to labor
a little, even that the victory may be thine also. And just as a king
would have his own son present indeed in the array; he would have him
shoot with the bow, <span id="fr_737"></span>[738](#fn_737.md) and show
himself, that the trophy may be reckoned his, while he achieves it all
Himself: even so doth God in our war against the devil: He requires of
thee one thing alone, that thou show forth a sincere hatred against that
foe. And if thou contribute this to Him, He by Himself brings all the
war to an end. Though thou burn with anger, with desire of riches, with
any tyrannical passion whatever; if He see thee only stripping thyself
and prepared against it, He comes quickly to thee, and makes all things
easy, and sets thee above the flame, as He did those children of old in
the Babylonian furnace: for they too carried in with them nought but
their good will.

<span id="iii.XVI-p184"></span>In order then that we also may extinguish
all the furnace of disordered pleasure here, and so escape the hell that
is there, let these each day be our counsels, our cares, and our
practice, drawing towards us the favor of God, both by our full purpose
concerning good works, and by our frequent prayers. For thus even those
things which appear insupportable now, will be most easy, and light, and
lovely. Because, so long as we are in our passions, we think virtue
rugged and morose and arduous, vice desirable and most pleasing; but if
we would stand off from these but a little, then both vice will appear
abominable and unsightly, and virtue easy, mild, and much to be desired.
And this you may learn plainly from those who have done well. Hear, for
instance, how of those passions Paul is ashamed, even after his
deliverance from them, saying, “For what fruit had ye then in those
things, whereof ye are now ashamed?” <span
id="fr_738"></span>[739](#fn_738.md) But virtue, even after his labor, he
affirms to be light, calling <span id="fr_739"></span>[740](#fn_739.md) the
laboriousness of our affliction momentary and “light,” and rejoicing in
his sufferings, and glorying in his tribulations, and taking a pride in
the marks wherewith he had been branded for Christ’s sake.

<span id="iii.XVI-p187"></span>In order then that we too may establish
ourselves in this habit, let us order ourselves each day by what hath
been said, and “forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching
forth unto those things which are before, let us press on towards the
prize of the high calling:” <span id="fr_740"></span>[741](#fn_740.md) unto
which God grant that we may all attain, by the grace and love towards
man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and power for ever and
ever. Amen.

<span id="iii.XVI-p102"></span>Epiph. Hær. 41, sec. 1. “Cerdon \[circ.
A.D. 150\] with others preached two first principles, and so in fact two
Gods: the one good, and unknown to all: whom he also called the Father
of Jesus: the other, the Demiurgus, or artificer, evil, and open to
knowledge, who spake in the law, and appeared in the prophets, and hath
often become visible.” In this he agreed with the Oriental heretics
generally. Marcion, his disciple, within a few years improved on him
(Hær. 42, sec. 3), “saying, that there are three principles: one, that
on high, unnamed, and unseen, which it pleases him to call the good God
(this however, was not the Creator of any of the things that are in the
world): another, a visible God, Creator and Artificer: and, in the third
place, the devil.…Now the Creator, and Artificer, and visible One, they
say, is the God of the Jews, and is also the Judge.” Cf. *ibid*. sec. 6;
St. Aug. *de Hæres*. 22; Tertull. contr. Marc. i. 10 \[*Ante-Nicene
Fathers*, vol. III. p. 278\]; St. Iren. i. 28, 29 \[*Ante-Nicene

<span id="iii.XVI-p103"></span>St. Iren. v. 2. “Vain also are those who
say that the Lord came to what was another’s, as though coveting it, in
order to present that man who had been made by another, to that God, who
had neither made nor ordered him, yea, rather, who had deserted him from
men’s first original formation. His coming, therefore, is not just,
coming as He did by their account to what was none of His.” \[*Ibid*.
pp. 527, 528.\] In Lib. iii. 11, he specifies Marcion as teaching this
doctrine.

id="iii.XVI-p106.1"></span>. “Which of the good rules of the law should
I rather defend, than those which heresy hath craved for her own
purposes? As the rule of retaliation, requiring eye for eye, tooth for
tooth, and bruise for bruise. There is no tinge here of any permission
for repaying an injury in kind, but the whole drift of it is to restrain
violence. That is, because that most stubborn and faithless people would
count it hard or even inconceivable to await God’s redress, which the
prophet was afterwards to proclaim, in the words, ‘Vengeance is mine, I
will repay, saith the Lord;’ the commission of wrong during the interval
was to be in a manner smothered by the fear of immediate retribution.”
\[*Ante-Nicene Fathers,* vol. III. p. 311.\] St. Augustin (contr. Adim.
c. 8), says the same in reply to the Manichæans.

<span id="iii.XVI-p153"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.XVI-p153.1"></span>συνελντα τ προκεμενα</span>. Mr. Field
translates this, “quickly doing the work in hand:” alleging that the
word <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.XVI-p153.2"></span>συναιρεν</span> cannot well stand for
“removing.” But its strict meaning seems to be “to pack up,” or “put
into a small compass.” So Odyss. xx. 95. <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.XVI-p153.3"></span>χλαναν μν συνελν κα κεα, ποσιν νευδεν</span>.

class="Greek"><span id="iii.XVI-p153.4"></span>προκεμενα</span>, taken
in its liturgical sense. \[The technical sense of the verb is “to
contract,” and the context favors Field’s view. The command was neither
“after hastening through the service (Latin, *nec propere confecto
sacrificio*) nor before beginning it.”—R.\]
