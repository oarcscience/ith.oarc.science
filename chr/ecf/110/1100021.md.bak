<span id="iii.XIII-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.XIII-p2.1"></span>[Matt. IV.
1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.XIII-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="iii.XIII-p3"></span>“Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into
the wilderness, to be tempted of the devil.”

<span id="iii.XIII-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.XIII-p4.1"></span>Then.</span> When? After the descent of the
Spirit, after the voice that was borne from above, and said, “This is My
Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” And what was marvellous, it was
of the Holy Spirit; for this, he here saith, led Him up. For since with
a view to our instruction He both did and underwent all things; He
endures also to be led up thither, and to wrestle against the devil: in
order that each of those who are baptized, if after his baptism he have
to endure greater temptations may not be troubled as if the result were
unexpected, but may continue to endure all nobly, as though it were
happening in the natural course of things.

<span id="iii.XIII-p5"></span>Yea, for therefore thou didst take up
arms, not to be idle, but to fight. For this cause neither doth God
hinder the temptations as they come on, first to teach thee that thou
art become much stronger; next, that thou mayest continue modest neither
be exalted even by the greatness of thy gifts, the temptations having
power to repress thee; moreover, in order that that wicked demon, who is
for a while doubtful about thy desertion of him, by the touchstone of
temptations may be well assured that thou hast utterly forsaken and
fallen from him; fourthly, that thou mayest in this way be made
stronger, and better tempered than any steel; fifthly, that thou mayest
obtain a clear demonstration of the treasures entrusted to thee.

<span id="iii.XIII-p6"></span>For the devil would not have assailed
thee, unless he had seen thee brought to greater honor. Hence, for
example, from the beginning, he attacked Adam, because he saw him in the
enjoyment of great dignity. For this reason he arrayed himself against
Job, because he saw him crowned and proclaimed by the God of all.

<span id="iii.XIII-p7"></span>How then saith He, “Pray that ye enter not
into temptation.” <span id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529.md) For this cause
he doth not show thee Jesus simply going up, but “led up” according to
the principle of the Economy; <span id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530.md)
signifying obscurely by this, that we ought not of ourselves to leap
upon it, but being dragged thereto, to stand manfully.

<span id="iii.XIII-p10"></span>And see whither the Spirit led Him up,
when He had taken Him; not into a city and forum, but into a wilderness.
That is, He being minded to attract the devil, gives him a handle not
only by His hunger, but also by the place. For then most especially doth
the devil assail, when he sees men left alone, and by themselves. Thus
did he also set upon the woman in the beginning, having caught her
alone, and found her apart from her husband. Just as when he sees us
with others and banded together, he is not equally confident, and makes
no attack. Wherefore we have the greatest need on this very account to
be flocking together continually, that we may not be open to the devil’s
attacks.

<span id="iii.XIII-p11"></span>2. Having then found Him in the
wilderness, and in a pathless wilderness (for that the wilderness was
such, Mark hath declared, saying, that He “was with the wild
beasts” <span id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531) .md), behold with how much
craft he draws near, and wickedness; and for what sort of opportunity he
watches. For not in his fast, but in his hunger he approaches Him; to
instruct thee how great a good fasting is, and how it is a most powerful
shield against the devil, and that after the font, <span
id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532.md) men should give themselves up, not to
luxury and drunkenness, and a full table, but to fasting. For, for this
cause even He fasted, not as needing it Himself, but to instruct us.
Thus, since our sins before the font <span
id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533.md) were brought in by serving the belly:
much as if any one who had made a sick man whole were to forbid his
doing those things, from which the distemper arose; so we see here
likewise that He Himself after the font brought in fasting. For indeed
both Adam by the incontinence of the belly was cast out of paradise; and
the flood in Noah’s time, this produced; and this brought down the
thunders on Sodom. For although there was also a charge of whoredom,
nevertheless from this grew the root of each of those punishments; which
Ezekiel also signified when he said, “But this was the iniquity of
Sodom, that she waxed wanton in pride and in fullness of bread, and in
abundance of luxury.” <span id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534.md) Thus the
Jews also per <span id="page_78">p. 78</span> <span
id="iii.XIII-Page_78"></span> petrated the greatest wickedness, being
driven upon transgression by their drunkenness and delicacy. <span
id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535.md)

<span id="iii.XIII-p17"></span>On this account then even He too fasts
forty days, pointing out to us the medicines of our salvation; yet
proceeds no further, lest on the other hand, through the exceeding
greatness of the miracle the truth of His Economy <span
id="fr_536"></span>[537](#fn_536.md) should be discredited. For as it is,
this cannot be, seeing that both Moses and Elias, anticipating Him,
could advance to so great a length of time, strengthened by the power of
God. And if He had proceeded farther, from this among other things His
assumption of our flesh would have seemed incredible to many.

<span id="iii.XIII-p19"></span>Having then fasted forty days and as many
nights,

<span id="iii.XIII-p20"></span>“He was afterwards an hungered; <span
id="fr_537"></span>[538](#fn_537.md) ” affording him a point to lay hold of
and approach, that by actual conflict He might show how to prevail and
be victorious. Just so do wrestlers also: when teaching their pupils how
to prevail and overcome, they voluntarily in the lists engage with
others, to afford these in the persons of their antagonists the means of
seeing and learning the mode of conquest. Which same thing then also
took place. For it being His will to draw him on so far, He both made
His hunger known to him, and awaited his approach, and as He waited for
him, so He dashed him to earth, once, twice, and three times, with such
ease as became Him.

<span id="iii.XIII-p22"></span>3. But that we may not, by hurrying over
these victories, mar your profit, let us begin from the first assault,
and examine each with exact care.

<span id="iii.XIII-p23"></span>Thus, after He was an hungered, it is
said, “The tempter came, and said unto Him, If Thou be Son of God,
command that these stones be made bread.” <span
id="fr_538"></span>[539](#fn_538.md)

<span id="iii.XIII-p25"></span>For, because he had heard a voice borne
from above, and saying, “This is My beloved Son;” and had heard also
John bearing so large witness concerning Him, and after that saw Him an
hungered; he was thenceforth in perplexity, and neither could believe
that He was a mere man, because of the things spoken concerning Him; nor
on the other hand receive it that He was Son of God, seeing Him as he
did in hunger. Whence being m perplexity he utters ambiguous sounds. And
much as when coming to Adam at the beginning, he feigns things that are
not, that he may learn the things that are; even so here also, not
knowing clearly the unutterable mystery of the Economy, and who He may
be that is come, he attempts to weave other nets, whereby he thought to
know that which was hidden and obscure. And what saith he? “If Thou be
Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.” He said not,
because thou art an hungered, but, “if Thou be Son of God;” thinking to
cheat Him with his compliments. Wherefore also he was silent touching
the hunger, that he might not seem to be alleging it, and upbraiding
Him. For not knowing the greatness of the Economy which was going on, he
supposed this to be a reproach to Him. Wherefore flattering Him
craftily, he makes mention of His dignity only.

<span id="iii.XIII-p26"></span>What then saith Christ? To put down his
pride, and to signify that there was nothing shameful in what had
happened, nor unbecoming His wisdom; that which the other had passed
over in silence to flatter Him, He brings forward and sets it forth,
saying, “Man shall not live by bread alone.” <span
id="fr_539"></span>[540](#fn_539.md)

<span id="iii.XIII-p28"></span>So that He begins with the necessity of
the belly. But mark, I pray thee, the craft of that wicked demon, and
whence he begins his wrestlings, and how he doth not forget his proper
art. For by what means he cast out also the first man, and encompassed
him with thousands of other evils, with the same means here likewise he
weaves his deceit; I mean, with incontinence of the belly. So too even
now one may hear many foolish ones say their bad words by thousands
because of the belly. But Christ, to show that the virtuous man is not
compelled even by this tyranny to do anything that is unseemly, first
hungers, then submits not to what is enjoined Him; teaching us to obey
the devil in nothing. Thus, because the first man did hereby both offend
God, and transgress the law, as much and more doth He teach thee:—though
it be no transgression which he commands, not even so to obey.

<span id="iii.XIII-p29"></span>And why say I, “transgression”? “Why,
even though something expedient be suggested by the devils, <span
id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540.md) do not thou,” saith He, “even so give
heed unto them.” Thus, for instance, He stopped the mouths of those
devils <span id="fr_541"></span>[542](#fn_541.md) also, proclaiming Him Son
of God. And Paul too again <span id="fr_542"></span>[543](#fn_542.md)
rebuked them, crying this self-same thing; and yet what they said was
profitable; but he more abundantly dishonoring them, and obstructing
their plot against us, drove them away even when doctrines of salvation
were preached by them, <span id="page_79">p. 79</span> <span
id="iii.XIII-Page_79"></span> closing up their mouths, and bidding them
be silent.

<span id="iii.XIII-p33"></span>And therefore neither in this instance
did He consent to what was said. But what saith He? “Man shall not live
by bread alone.” Now His meaning is like this: “God is able even by a
word to nourish the hungry man;” bringing him a testimony out of the
ancient Scripture, and teaching us, though we hunger, yea, whatever we
suffer, never to fall away from our Lord.

<span id="iii.XIII-p34"></span>But if a man say, “still He should have
displayed Himself;” I would ask him, with what intent, and for what
reason? For not at all that he might believe did the other so speak, but
that he might, as he thought, over-argue <span
id="fr_543"></span>[544](#fn_543.md) Him into unbelief. Since the first of
mankind were in this way beguiled and over-argued by him, not putting
earnest faith in God. For the contrary of what God had said he promised
them, and puffed them up with vain hopes, and brought them to unbelief,
and so cast them out of the blessings they actually possessed. But
Christ signifies Himself not to have consented, either to him then or
afterwards to the Jews his partisans, in their demand of signs:
invariably instructing us, whatever we may have power to do, yet to do
nothing vainly and at random; nor even when want urges to obey the
devil.

<span id="iii.XIII-p36"></span>4. What then doth this accursed one?
Overcome, and unable to persuade Him to do his bidding, and that when
pressed by such violent hunger, he proceeds to another thing, saying,

<span id="iii.XIII-p37"></span>“If Thou be Son of God, cast Thyself
down; for it is written, He shall give His angels charge concerning
Thee, and in their hands they shall bear Thee up.” <span
id="fr_544"></span>[545](#fn_544.md)

<span id="iii.XIII-p39"></span>What can the reason be, that at each
temptation He adds this, “If Thou be Son of God?” Much the same as he
did in that former case, he doth also at this time. That is, as he then
slandered God, saying, “In the day ye eat, your eyes shall be
opened;” <span id="fr_545"></span>[546](#fn_545.md) thereby intending to
signify, that they were beguiled and overreached, and had received no
benefit; even so in this case also he insinuates this same thing,
saying, “in vain God hath called Thee Son, and hath beguiled Thee by His
gift; for, if this be not so, afford us some clear proof that Thou art
of that power.” Then, because Christ had reasoned with him from
Scripture, he also brings in a testimony of the prophet.

<span id="iii.XIII-p41"></span>How then doth Christ? He is not
indignant, nor provoked, but with that extreme gentleness He reasons
with him again from the Scriptures, saying, “Thou shalt not tempt the
Lord thy God:” <span id="fr_546"></span>[547](#fn_546.md) teaching us that
we must overcome the devil, not by miracles, but by forbearance and
long-suffering, and that we should do nothing at all for display and
vainglory.

<span id="iii.XIII-p43"></span>But mark thou his folly, even by the very
testimony which he produced. For while the testimonies cited by the Lord
were both of them spoken with exceeding fitness: his, on the other hand,
were chance and random sayings, neither did he bring forward on his part
that which applied to the matter in hand. For that it is written, “He
shall give His angels charge concerning Thee,” this surely is not advice
to dash and toss one’s self down headlong; and moreover, this was not so
much as spoken concerning the Lord. However, this for the time He did
not expose, although there was both insult in his manner of speech, and
great inconsistency. For of God’s Son no man requires these things: but
to cast one’s self down is the part of the devil, and of demons. Whereas
God’s part is to raise up even them that are down. And if He ought to
have displayed His own power, it would not have been by casting and
tossing Himself down at random, but by saving others. But to cast
ourselves down precipices, and into pits, pertains properly to his
troop. Thus, for example, the juggler among them doth everywhere.

<span id="iii.XIII-p44"></span>But Christ, even when these things are
said, doth not yet reveal Himself, but as man for a while discourses
with him. For the sayings, “Man shall not live by bread alone;” and,
“Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God,” suited one not greatly
revealing Himself, but representing Himself as one of the many.

<span id="iii.XIII-p45"></span>But marvel thou not, if he in reasoning
with Christ oftentimes turn himself about. For as pugilists, when they
have received deadly blows, reel about, drenched in much blood, and
blinded; even so he too, darkened by the first and the second blow,
speaks at random what comes uppermost: and proceeds to his third
assault.

<span id="iii.XIII-p46"></span>5. “And he leadeth Him up into a high
mountain, and showeth Him all the kingdoms, and saith, All these things
will I give Thee, if Thou wilt fall down and worship me. Then saith He,
Get thee behind me, Satan, for it is written, Thou shalt worship the
Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.” <span
id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547.md)

<span id="iii.XIII-p48"></span>For since he was now come to sinning
against the Father, saying, that all that is the Father’s was his, and
was endeavoring to <span id="page_80">p. 80</span> <span
id="iii.XIII-Page_80"></span> make himself out to be God, as artificer
of the universe; He then rebuked him: but not even then with vehemence,
but simply, “Get thee hence, Satan;” which itself had in it something of
command rather than of rebuke. For as soon as He had said to him, “Get
thee hence,” He caused him to take to flight; since he brought not
against Him any other temptations.

<span id="iii.XIII-p49"></span>And how saith Luke, that “he ended all
temptation.” <span id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548.md) To me it seems that
in mentioning the chief of the temptations, he had spoken of all, as
though the rest too were included in these. For the things that form the
substance of innumerable evils are these: to be a slave to the belly, to
do anything for vainglory, to be in subjection to the madness of riches.
Which accordingly that accursed one considering, set last the most
powerful of all, I mean the desire of more: and though originally, and
from the beginning, he was travailing to come to this, yet he kept it
for the last, as being of more force than the rest. For in fact this is
the manner of his wrestling, to apply those things last, which seem more
likely to overthrow. And this sort of thing he did with respect to Job
likewise. Wherefore in this instance too, having begun with the motives
which seem to be viler and weaker, he goes on to the more prevailing.

<span id="iii.XIII-p51"></span>How then are we to get the better of him?
In the way which Christ that taught us, by fleeing to God for refuge;
and neither to be depressed in famine, as believing in God who is able
to feed even with a word; nor amidst whatever good things we may receive
to tempt Him who gave them, but to be content with the glory which is
from above, making no account of that which is of men, and on every
occasion to despise what is beyond our need. For nothing doth so make us
fall under the power of the devil, as longing for more, and loving
covetousness. And this we may see even by what is done now. For now also
there are those who say, “All these things will we give thee, if thou
wilt fall down and worship;” who are indeed men by nature, but have
become his instruments. Since at that time too he approached Him, not by
himself only, but also by others. Which Luke also was declaring, when he
said, that “he departed from Him for a season;” <span
id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549.md) showing that hereafter he approached
Him by his proper instruments.

<span id="iii.XIII-p53"></span>“And, behold, angels came and ministered
unto Him.” <span id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550.md) For when the assault
was going on, He suffered them not to appear, that He might not thereby
drive away the prey; but after He had convicted him in all points, and
caused him to take to flight, then they appear: that thou also mayest
learn, that after thy victories which are copied from His, angels will
receive thee also, applauding thee, and waiting as guards on thee in all
things. Thus, for example, angels take Lazarus <span
id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551.md) away with them, after the furnace of
poverty and of famine and of all distress. For as I have already said,
Christ on this occasion exhibits many things, which we ourselves are to
enjoy.

<span id="iii.XIII-p56"></span>6. Forasmuch then as all these things
have been done for thee, do thou emulate and imitate His victory. And
should any one approach thee of those who are that evil spirit’s
servants, and savor the things that be of him, upbraiding thee and
saying, “If thou art marvellous and great, remove the mountain;” be not
troubled, nor confounded, but answer with meekness, and say some such
thing as thou hast heard thy Lord say: “Thou shalt not tempt the Lord
thy God.”

<span id="iii.XIII-p57"></span>Or should he, offering glory and
dominion, and an endless amount of wealth, enjoin thee to worship him,
do thou stand again manfully. For neither did the devil deal so with the
common Lord of us all only, but every day also he brings these his
machinations to bear on each of His servants, not in mountains only and
in wildernesses, nor by himself: but in cities likewise, in
market-places, and in courts of justice, and by means of our own
kindred, even men. What then must we do? Disbelieve him altogether, and
stop our ears against him, and hate him when he flatters, and when he
proffers more, then so much the more shun him. Because in Eve’s case
also, when he was most lifting her up with hopes, then he cast her down,
and did her the greatest evils. Yea, for he is an implacable enemy, and
hath taken up against us such war as excludes all treaty. And we are not
so earnest for our own salvation, as he is for our ruin. Let us then
shun him, not with words only, but also with works; not in mind only,
but also in deed; and let us do none of the things which he approves,
for so shall we do all those which God approves. Yea, for he makes also
many promises, not that he may give, but that he may take. He promises
by rapine, that he may deprive us of the kingdom, and of righteousness;
and sets treasures in the earth as a kind of gins or <span
id="page_81">p. 81</span> <span id="iii.XIII-Page_81"></span> traps,
that he may deprive us both of these and of the treasures in Heaven, and
he would have us be rich here, that we may not be rich there.

<span id="iii.XIII-p58"></span>And if he should not be able by wealth to
cast us out of our portion there, he comes another way, the way of
poverty; as he did with respect to Job. That is, when he saw that wealth
did him no harm, he weaves his toils by poverty, expecting on that side
to get the better of him. But what could be more foolish than this?
Since he that hath been able to bear wealth with moderation, much more
will he bear poverty with manliness; and he who desires not riches when
present, neither will he seek them when absent; even as that blessed man
did not, but by his poverty, on the other hand, he became still more
glorious. For of his possessions that wicked demon had power indeed to
deprive him, but his love toward God he not only could not take away,
but made it even stronger, and when he had stripped him of all, he
caused him to abound with more blessings; wherefore also he was in
perplexity. For the more plagues he brought upon him, the more mighty he
then saw him become. And therefore, as you know, when he had gone
through all, and had thoroughly tried his metal, <span
id="fr_552"></span>[553](#fn_552.md) because he made no way, he ran to his
old weapon, the woman, and assumes a mask of concern, and makes a
tragical picture of his calamities in most pitiable tone, and feigns
that for removal of his evil he is introducing that deadly
counsel. <span id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553.md) But neither so did he
prevail; nay, for his bait was perceived by that wondrous man, who with
much wisdom stopped the mouth of the woman speaking at his instigation.

<span id="iii.XIII-p61"></span>Just so we likewise must act: though it
be a brother, a tried friend, a wife, whom you will of those nearest to
us, whom he hath entered into, and so utters something not
convenient, <span id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554.md) we must not receive
the counsel for the person of him who so speaks, but for the deadly
counsel turn away from the speaker. Since in fact now also he doth many
such things, and puts before him a mask of sympathy, and while he seems
to be friendly, he is instilling his pernicious words, more grievous
than poisons. Thus, as to flatter for evil is his part, so to chastise
for our good, is God’s.

<span id="iii.XIII-p63"></span>7. Let us not then be deceived, neither
let us by every mean seek after the life of ease. For “whom the Lord
loveth,” it is said, “He chasteneth.” <span
id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555.md) Wherefore when we enjoy prosperity,
living in wickedness, then most of all should we grieve. For we ought
ever to be afraid while we sin, but especially when we suffer no ill.
For when God exacts our penalties by little and little, he makes our
payment for these things easy to us; but when he is long-suffering for
each of our negligences, He is storing us up, if we continue in such
things, unto a great punishment. Since, if for the well-doers affliction
be a necessary thing, much more for them that sin.

<span id="iii.XIII-p65"></span>See for instance how much long-suffering
Pharaoh met with, and afterwards underwent for all most extreme
punishment: in how many things Nebuchadnezzar offended, yet at the end
expiated all; and the rich man, because he had suffered no great ill
here, for this very cause chiefly became miserable, for that having
lived in luxury in the present life, he departed to pay the penalty of
all these things there, where he could not obtain anything at all to
soothe his calamity.

<span id="iii.XIII-p66"></span>Yet for all this some are so cold and
senseless, as to be always seeking only the things that are here, and
uttering those absurd sayings, “Let me enjoy all things present for a
time, and then I will consider about things out of sight: I will gratify
my belly, I will be a slave to pleasures, I will make full use of the
present life; give me to-day, and take tomorrow.” Oh excess of folly!
Why, wherein do they who talk so differ from goats and swine? For if the
prophet <span id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556.md) permits not them to be
accounted men, that “neigh after their neighbors wife,” who shall blame
us for esteeming these to be goats and swine, and more insensible than
asses, by whom those things are held uncertain, which are more evident
than what we see? Why, if thou believest nothing else, attend to the
devils in their scourging, to them who had our hurt for their object in
all their practice, both in word and deed. For thou wilt not, I am sure,
contradict this, that they do all to increase our security, and to do
away with the fear of hell, and to breed disbelief of the tribunals in
that world. Nevertheless, they that are so minded, by cryings and
wailings do oftentimes proclaim the torments that are there. <span
id="fr_557"></span>[558](#fn_557.md) Whence is it then that they so speak,
and utter things contrary to their own will? From no other cause, but
because they are under the pressure of stronger compulsion. For they
would have not been minded of their own accord to confess either that
they <span id="page_82">p. 82</span> <span id="iii.XIII-Page_82"></span>
are tormented by dead men, or that they at all suffer anything dreadful.

<span id="iii.XIII-p69"></span>Wherefore now have I said this? Because
evil demons confess hell, who would fain have hell disbelieved; but thou
who enjoyest honor so great, and hast been a partaker in unutterable
mysteries, dost not so much as imitate them, but art become more
hardened even than they.

<span id="iii.XIII-p70"></span>8. “But who,” one will say, “hath come
from those in hell, and hath declared these things?” Why, who hath
arrived here from heaven, and told us that there is a God who created
all things? And whence is it clear that we have a soul? For plainly, if
thou art to believe the things only that are in sight, both God and
angels, and mind and soul, will be matter of doubting to thee, and in
this way thou wilt find all the doctrines of the truth gone.

<span id="iii.XIII-p71"></span>Yet surely, if thou art willing to
believe what is evident, the things invisible ought to be believed by
thee, rather than those which are seen. Even though what I say be a
paradox, nevertheless it is true, and among men of understanding is
fully acknowledged. For whereas the eyes are often deceived, not in the
things unseen only (for of those they do not so much as take
cognizance), but even in those which men think they actually see,
distance and atmosphere, and absence of mind, and anger, and care, and
ten thousand other things impeding their accuracy; the reasoning power
of the soul on the other hand, if it receive the light of the divine
Scriptures, will prove a more accurate, an unerring standard of
realities.

<span id="iii.XIII-p72"></span>Let us not then vainly deceive ourselves,
neither in addition to the carelessness of our life, which is the
offspring of such doctrines as these, heap up to ourselves, for the very
doctrines themselves, a more grievous fire. For if there be no judgment,
and we are not to give account of our deeds, neither shall we receive
rewards for our labors. Observe which way your blasphemies tend, when ye
say, that God, who is righteous, and loving, and mild, overlooks so
great labors and toils. And how can this be reasonable? Why, if by
nothing else, at any rate by the circumstances of thine own house, I bid
thee weigh these things, and then thou wilt see the absurdity. For
though thou wert thyself savage and inhuman beyond measure, and wilder
than the very wild beasts, thou wouldest not choose at thy death to
leave unhonored the servant that had been affectionate to thee, but
requitest him both with freedom, and with a gift of money; and forasmuch
as in thine own person hereafter, having departed, thou wilt be able to
do him no good, thou givest charge concerning him to the future
inheritors of thy substance, beseeching, exhorting, doing everything, so
that he may not remain unrewarded.

<span id="iii.XIII-p73"></span>So then thou, who art evil, art so kind
and loving towards thy servant; and will the Infinite Goodness, that is,
God, the Unspeakable Love to man, the kindness so vast: will He overlook
and leave uncrowned His own servants, Peter and Paul, and James, and
John, those who every day for His sake suffered hunger, were bound, were
scourged, were drowned in the sea, were given up to wild beasts, were
dying, were suffering so great things as we cannot so much as reckon up?
And whereas the Olympic judge proclaims and crowns the victor, and the
master rewards the servant, and the king the soldier, and each in
general him that hath done him service, with what good things he can;
shall God alone, after those so great toils and labors, repay them with
no good thing great or small? shall those just and pious men, who have
walked in every virtue, lie in the same state with adulterers, and
parricides, and manslayers, and violators of tombs? And in what way can
this be reasonable? Since, if there be nothing after our departure
hence, and our interests reach no further than things present, those are
in the same case with these, or rather not so much as in the same. For
what though hereafter, as thou sayest, they fare alike? yet here, the
whole of their time, the wicked have been at ease, the righteous in
chastisement. And this what sort of tyrant, what savage and relentless
man did ever so devise, touching his own servants and subjects?

<span id="iii.XIII-p74"></span>Didst thou mark the exceeding greatness
of the absurdity, and in what this argument issues? Therefore if thou
wilt not any other way, yet by these reasonings be instructed to rid
thyself of this wicked thought, and to flee from vice, and cleave to the
toils which end in virtue: and then shalt thou know certainly that our
concerns are not bounded by the present life. And if any one ask thee,
“Who hath come from thence and brought word what is there?” say unto
him, “of men not one; for surely he would have been often disbelieved,
as vaunting, and exaggerating the thing; but the Lord of the angels hath
brought word with exactness of all those things. What need then have we
of any man, seeing He, that will demand account of us, crieth aloud
every day, that He hath both made ready a hell, and prepared a kingdom;
and affords us clear demonstrations of these things? For if He were not
hereafter to <span id="page_83">p. 83</span> <span
id="iii.XIII-Page_83"></span> judge, neither would he have exacted any
penalty here.

<span id="iii.XIII-p75"></span>9. “Well, but as to this very point how
can it be reasonable? that of the wicked some should be punished, others
not? I mean, if God be no respecter of persons, as surely He is not, why
can it be that of one He exacts a penalty, but another He suffers to go
away unpunished? Why, this is again more inexplicable than the former.”

<span id="iii.XIII-p76"></span>Yet if you are willing to hear what we
say with candor, we will solve this difficulty also.

<span id="iii.XIII-p77"></span>What then is the solution? He neither
exacts penalty of all here, lest thou shouldest despair of the
resurrection, and lose all expectation of the judgment, as though all
were to give account here; nor doth He suffer all to go away unpunished,
lest on the other hand thou shouldest account all to be without His
providence; but He both punishes and abstains from punishing: by those
whom He punishes, signifying that in that world also He will exact a
penalty of such as are unpunished here; and by those whom He doth not
punish, working upon thee to believe that there is some fearful trial
after our departure hence.

<span id="iii.XIII-p78"></span>But if He were altogether indifferent
about our former deeds, He neither would have punished any here, nor
have conferred benefits. But now thou seest Him for thy sake stretching
out the heaven, kindling the sun, founding the earth, pouring forth the
sea, expanding the air, and appointing for the moon her courses, setting
unchangeable laws for the seasons of the years, and all other things too
performing their own courses exactly at a sign from Him. For both our
nature, and that of creatures irrational, of them that creep, that walk,
that fly, that swim, in marshes, in springs, in rivers, in mountains, in
forests, in houses, in the air, in plains; plants also, and seeds, and
trees, both wild and cultivated, both fruitful and unfruitful; and all
things in general, moved by that unwearied Hand, make provision for our
life, affording to us of themselves their ministry, not for our need
only, but also for our feeling of high station. <span
id="fr_558"></span>[559](#fn_558.md)

<span id="iii.XIII-p80"></span>Seeing therefore order so great and fair
(and yet we have not mentioned so much as the least portion thereof),
darest thou say, that He who for thy sake hath wrought things so many
and great will overlook thee in the most critical points, and suffer
thee when dead to lie with the asses and swine: and that having honored
thee with so great a gift, that of godliness, whereby He hath even
equaled thee with the angels, He will overlook thee after thy countless
labors and toils?

<span id="iii.XIII-p81"></span>And how can this be reasonable? Why,
these things, if we be silent “the stones will immediately cry
out;” <span id="fr_559"></span>[560](#fn_559.md) so plain are they, and
manifest, and more lucid than the sunbeam itself.

<span id="iii.XIII-p83"></span>Having then considered all these things,
and having convinced our own soul, that after our departure hence, we
shall both stand at the fearful judgment-seat, and give account of all
that we have done, and shall bear our penalty, and submit to our
sentence, if we continue in our negligences; and shall receive crowns
and unutterable blessings, if we are willing to give a little heed to
ourselves; let us both stop the mouths of them who gainsay these things,
and ourselves choose the way of virtue; that with due confidence
departing to that tribunal, we may attain unto the good things that are
promised us, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to whom be glory and dominion, now and ever, world without end. Amen.
