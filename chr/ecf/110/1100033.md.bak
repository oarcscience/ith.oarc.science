id="iii.XXV-p1.1"></span>Homily XXV.</span>

<span id="iii.XXV-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.XXV-p2.1"></span>[Matt. VII.
28](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#028.md)<span
id="iii.XXV-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="iii.XXV-p3"></span>*“And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended
these sayings, the people were astonished at His doctrine.”* <span
id="fr_1066"></span>[1067](#fn_1066.md)

<span id="iii.XXV-p5"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.XXV-p5.1"></span>Yet</span> was it rather natural for them to
grieve at the unpleasantness of His sayings, and to shudder at the
loftiness of His injunctions; but now so great was the power of the
Teacher, that many of them were even caught thereby, and thrown into
very great admiration, and persuaded by reason of the sweetness of His
sayings, not even when He ceased to speak, to depart from Him at all
afterwards. For neither did the hearers depart, He having <span
id="page_168">p. 168</span> <span id="iii.XXV-Page_168"></span> come
down from the mountain, but even then the whole auditory followed Him;
so great a love for His sayings had He instilled into them.

<span id="iii.XXV-p6"></span>But they were astonished most of all at His
authority. For not with reference to another, like the prophet and
Moses, did He say what He said; but everywhere indicating Himself to be
the person that had the power of deciding. For so, when setting forth
His laws, He still kept adding, “But I say unto you.” And in reminding
them of that day, He declared Himself to be the judge, both by the
punishments, and by the honors.

<span id="iii.XXV-p7"></span>And yet it was likely that this too would
disturb them. For if, when they saw Him by His works showing forth His
authority, the scribes were for stoning and persecuting Him; while there
were words only to prove this, how was it other than likely for them to
be offended? and especially when at first setting out these things were
said, and before He had given proof of His own power? But however, they
felt nothing of this; for when the heart and mind is candid, it is
easily persuaded by the words of the truth. And this is just why one
sort, even when the miracles were proclaiming His power, were offended;
while the other on hearing mere words were persuaded and followed Him.
This, I would add, the evangelist too is intimating, when he saith,
“great multitudes followed Him,” <span
id="fr_1067"></span>[1068](#fn_1067.md) not any of the rulers, nor of the
scribes, but as many as were free from vice, and had their judgment
uncorrupted. And throughout the whole gospel thou seest that such clave
unto Him. For both while He spake, they used to listen in silence, not
making any intrusion, nor breaking in upon the connexion of His sayings,
nor tempting Him, and desiring to find a handle like the Pharisees; and
after His exhortation they followed Him again, marvelling.

<span id="iii.XXV-p9"></span>But do thou mark, I pray thee, the Lord’s
consideration, how He varies the mode of profiting His hearers, after
miracles entering on words, and again from the instruction by His words
passing to miracles. Thus, both before they went up into the mountain,
He healed many, preparing the way for His sayings; and after finishing
that long discourse to the people, He comes again to miracles,
confirming what had been said by what was done. And so, because He was
teaching as “one having authority,” lest His so teaching should be
thought boasting and arrogant, He doth the very same in His works also,
as having authority to heal; that they might no more be perplexed at
seeing Him teach in this way, when He was working His miracles also in
the same.

<span id="iii.XXV-p10"></span>2. “For when He was come down from the
mountain, there came a leper, saying, Lord, if Thou wilt, Thou canst
make me clean.” <span id="fr_1068"></span>[1069](#fn_1068.md) Great was the
understanding and the faith of him who so drew near. For he did not
interrupt the teaching, nor break through the auditory, but awaited the
proper time, and approaches Him “when He is come down.” And not at
random, but with much earnestness, and at His knees, he beseeches
Him, <span id="fr_1069"></span>[1070](#fn_1069.md) as another evangelist
saith, and with the genuine faith and right opinion about him. For
neither did he say, “If Thou request it of God,” nor, “If Thou pray,”
but, “If Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean.” Nor did he say, “Lord,
cleanse me,” but leaves all to Him, and makes His recovery depend on
Him, and testifies that all the authority is His.

<span id="iii.XXV-p13"></span>“What then,” saith one, “if the leper’s
opinion was mistaken?” It were meet to do away with it, and to reprove,
and set it right. Did He then so do? By no means; but quite on the
contrary, He establishes and confirms what had been said. For this
cause, you see, neither did He say, “Be thou cleansed,” but, “I will, be
thou clean;” that the doctrine might no longer be a thing of the other’s
surmising, but of His own approval.

<span id="iii.XXV-p14"></span>But the apostles not so: rather in what
way? The whole people being in amazement, they said, “Why give heed to
us, as though by our own power or authority we had made him to
walk?” <span id="fr_1070"></span>[1071](#fn_1070.md) But the Lord, though
He spake oftentimes many things modestly, and beneath His own glory,
what saith He here, to establish the doctrine of them that were amazed
at Him for His authority? “I will, be thou clean.” Although in the many
and great signs which He wrought, He nowhere appears to have uttered
this word. Here however, to confirm the surmise both of all the people
and of the leper touching His authority, He purposely added, “I will.”

<span id="iii.XXV-p16"></span>And it was not that He said this, but did
it not; but the work also followed immediately. Whereas, if he had not
spoken well, but the saying had been a blasphemy, the work ought to have
been interrupted. But now nature herself gave way at His command, and
that speedily, as was meet, even more speedily <span id="page_169">p.
169</span> <span id="iii.XXV-Page_169"></span> than the evangelist hath
said. For the word, “immediately,” falls far short of the quickness that
there was in the work.

<span id="iii.XXV-p17"></span>But He did not merely say, “I will, be
thou clean,” but He also “put forth His hand, and touched him;” a thing
especially worthy of inquiry. For wherefore, when cleansing him by will
and word, did He add also the touch of His hand? It seems to me, for no
other end, but that He might signify by this also, that He is not
subject to the law, but is set over it; and that to the clean,
henceforth, nothing is unclean. <span
id="fr_1071"></span>[1072](#fn_1071.md) For this cause, we see, Elisha did
not so much as see Naaman, but though he perceived that he was offended
at his not coming out and touching him, observing the strictness of the
law, he abides at home, and sends him to Jordan to wash. Whereas the
Lord, to signify that He heals not as a servant, but as absolute master,
doth also touch. For His hand became not unclean from the leprosy, but
the leprous body was rendered clean by His holy hand.

<span id="iii.XXV-p19"></span>Because, as we know, He came not to heal
bodies only, but also to lead the soul unto self-command. As therefore
He from that time forward no more forbad to eat with unwashen hands,
introducing that excellent law, which relates to the indifference of
meats; just so in this case also, to instruct us for the future, that
the soul must be our care;—that leaving the outward purifications, we
must wipe that clean, and dread the leprosy thereof alone, which is sin
(for to be a leper is no hindrance to virtue):—He Himself first touches
the leper, and no man finds fault. For the tribunal was not corrupt,
neither were the spectators under the power of envy. Therefore, so far
from blaming, they were on the contrary astonished at the miracle, and
yielded thereto: and both for what He said, and for what He did, they
adored his uncontrollable power.

<span id="iii.XXV-p20"></span>3. Having therefore healed his body, He
bids him,

<span id="iii.XXV-p21"></span>“Tell no man, but show himself to the
priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto
them.” <span id="fr_1072"></span>[1073](#fn_1072.md)

<span id="iii.XXV-p23"></span>Now some say, that for this intent He bade
him tell no man, that they might practise no craft about the discerning
of his cure; a very foolish suspicion on their part. For He did not so
cleanse as to leave the cleansing questionable, but He bids him “tell no
man,” teaching us to avoid boasting and vainglory. And yet He well knew
that the other would not obey, but would proclaim his benefactor:
nevertheless He doth His own part.

<span id="iii.XXV-p24"></span>“How then elsewhere doth He bid them tell
of it?” one may ask. Not as jostling with or opposing Himself, but as
teaching men to be grateful. For neither in that place did He give
command to proclaim Himself, but to “give glory to God;” <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[1074](#fn_1073.md) by this leper training us to be
clear of pride and vainglory, by the other to be thankful and grateful;
and instructing on every occasion to offer to the Lord the praise of all
things that befall us. That is, because men for the most part remember
God in sickness, but grow slacker after recovery; He bids them
continually both in sickness and in health to give heed to the Lord, in
these words, “give glory to God.”

<span id="iii.XXV-p26"></span>But wherefore did He command him also to
show himself to the priest, and to offer a gift? To fulfill the law here
again. <span id="fr_1074"></span>[1075](#fn_1074.md) For neither did He in
every instance set it aside, nor in every instance keep it, but
sometimes He did the one, sometimes the other; by the one making way for
the high rule <span id="fr_1075"></span>[1076](#fn_1075.md) of life that
was to come, by the other checking for a while the insolent speech of
the Jews, and condescending to their infirmity. And why marvel, if just
at the beginning He Himself did this, when even the very apostles, after
they were commanded to depart unto the Gentiles, after the doors were
opened for their teaching throughout the world, and the law shut up, and
the commandments made new, and all the ancient things had ceased, are
found sometimes observing the law, sometimes neglecting it?

<span id="iii.XXV-p29"></span>But what, it may be said, doth this
saying, “Show thyself to the priest,” contribute to the keeping of the
law? No little. Because it was an ancient law, that the leper when
cleansed should not entrust to himself the judgment of his cleansing,
but should show himself to the priest, and present the demonstration
thereof to his eyes, and by that sentence be numbered amongst the clean.
For if the priest said not “The leper is cleansed,” he remained still
with the unclean without the camp. Wherefore he saith, “Show thyself to
the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded.” He said not,
“which I command,” but for a time remits him to the law, by every means
stopping their mouths. Thus, lest they should say, He had seized upon
the priests’ honor; though He performed the work Himself, yet the
approving it He entrusted to them, and made them sit as judges of His
own miracles. “Why, I <span id="page_170">p. 170</span> <span
id="iii.XXV-Page_170"></span> am so far,” He saith, “from striving
either with Moses or with the priests, that I guide the objects of my
favor to submit themselves unto them.”

<span id="iii.XXV-p30"></span>But what is, “for a testimony unto them”?
For reproof, for demonstration, for accusation, if they be unthankful.
For since they said, as a deceiver and impostor we persecute Him, as an
adversary of God, and a transgressor of the law; “Thou shalt bear me
witness,” saith He, “at that time, that I am not a transgressor of the
law. Nay, for having healed thee, I remit thee to the law, and to the
approval of the priests;” which was the act of one honoring the law, and
admiring Moses, and not setting himself in opposition to the ancient
doctrines.

<span id="iii.XXV-p31"></span>And if they were not in fact to be the
better, hereby most of all one may perceive His respect for the law,
that although He foreknew they would reap no benefit, He fulfilled all
His part. For this very thing He did indeed foreknow, and foretold it:
not saying, “for their correction,” neither, “for their instruction,”
but, “for a testimony unto them,” that is, for accusation, and for
reproof, and for a witness that all hath been done on my part; and
though I foreknew they would continue incorrigible, not even so did I
omit what ought to be done; only they continued keeping up to the end
their own wickedness. <span id="fr_1076"></span>[1077](#fn_1076.md)

<span id="iii.XXV-p33"></span>This, we may observe, He saith elsewhere
also; “This gospel shall be preached in all the world for a testimony to
all the nations, and then shall the end come;” <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[1078](#fn_1077.md) to the nations, to them that obey
not, to them that believe not. Thus, lest any one should say, “And
wherefore preach to all, if all are not to believe?”—it is that I may be
found to have done all my own part, and that no man may hereafter be
able to find fault, as though he had not heard. For the very preaching
shall bear witness against them, and they will not be able hereafter to
say, “We heard not;” for the word of godliness “hath gone out unto the
ends of the world.” <span id="fr_1078"></span>[1079](#fn_1078.md)

<span id="iii.XXV-p36"></span>4. Therefore bearing these things in mind,
let us also fulfill all our duties to our neighbor, and to God let us
give thanks continually. For it is too monstrous, enjoying as we do His
bounty in deed every day, not so much as in word to acknowledge the
favor; and this, though the acknowledgment again yield all its profit to
us. Since He needs not, be sure, anything of ours: but we stand in need
of all things from Him. Thus thanksgiving itself adds nothing to Him,
but causes us to be nearer to Him. For if men’s bounties, when we call
them to memory, do the more warm us with their proper love-charm; <span
id="fr_1079"></span>[1080](#fn_1079.md) much more when we are continually
bringing to mind the noble acts of our Lord towards us, shall we be more
diligent in regard of His commandments.

<span id="iii.XXV-p38"></span>For this cause Paul also said, “Be ye
thankful.” <span id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080.md) For the best
preservative of any benefit is the remembrance of the benefit, and a
continual thanksgiving.

<span id="iii.XXV-p40"></span>For this cause even the awful mysteries,
so full of that great salvation, which are celebrated at every
communion, are called a sacrifice of thanksgiving, <span
id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081.md) because they are the commemoration
of many benefits, and they signify the very sum of God’s care for us,
and by all means they work upon us to be thankful. For if His being born
of a virgin was a great miracle, and the evangelist said in amaze, “now
all this was done;” His being also slain, what place shall we find for
that? tell me. I mean, if to be born is called “all this;” to be
crucified, and to pour forth His blood, and to give Himself to us for a
spiritual feast and banquet,—what can that be called? Let us therefore
give Him thanks continually, and let this precede both our words and our
works.

<span id="iii.XXV-p42"></span>But let us be thankful not for our own
blessings alone, but also for those of others; for in this way we shall
be able both to destroy our envy, and to rivet our charity, and make it
more genuine. Since it will not even be possible for thee to go on
envying them, in behalf of whom thou givest thanks to the Lord.

<span id="iii.XXV-p43"></span>Wherefore, as you know, the priest also
enjoins to give thanks for the world, for the former things, for the
things that are now, for what hath been done to us before, for what
shall befall us hereafter, when that sacrifice <span
id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082.md) is set forth.

<span id="iii.XXV-p45"></span>For this is the thing both to free us from
earth, and to remove us into heaven, and to make us angels instead of
men. Because they too form a choir, and give thanks to God for His good
things bestowed on us, saying, “Glory to God in the highest, and on
earth peace, good will towards men.” <span
id="fr_1083"></span>[1084](#fn_1083.md) “And what is this to us, that are
not upon earth, nor are men?” “Nay, it is very much to us, for we have
been taught so to love our fellow serv <span id="page_171">p. 171</span>
<span id="iii.XXV-Page_171"></span> ants, as even to account their
blessings ours.”

<span id="iii.XXV-p47"></span>Wherefore Paul also, everywhere in his
epistles, gives thanks for God’s gracious acts to the world.

<span id="iii.XXV-p48"></span>Let us too therefore continually give
thanks, for our own blessings, and for those of others, alike for the
small and for the great. For though the gift be small, it is made great
by being God’s gift, or rather, there is nothing small that cometh from
Him, not only because it is bestowed by Him, but also in its very
nature.

<span id="iii.XXV-p49"></span>And to pass over all the rest, which
exceed the sand in multitude; what is equal to the dispensation <span
id="fr_1084"></span>[1085](#fn_1084.md) that hath taken place for our sake?
In that what was more precious to Him than all, even His only-begotten
Son, Him He gave for us His enemies; and not only gave, but after
giving, did even set Him before us as food; <span
id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085.md) Himself doing all things that were
for our good, both in giving Him, and in making us thankful for all
this. For because man is for the most part unthankful, He doth Himself
everywhere take in hand and bring about what is for our good. And what
He did with respect to the Jews, by places, and times, and feasts,
reminding them of His benefits, that He did in this case also, by the
manner of the sacrifice bringing us to a perpetual remembrance of His
bounty in these things.

<span id="iii.XXV-p52"></span>No one hath so labored that we should be
approved, and great, and in all things right-minded, as the God who made
us. Wherefore both against our will He befriends us often, and without
our knowledge oftener than not. And if thou marvel at what I have said,
I point to this as having occurred not to any ordinary person, but to
the blessed Paul. For even that blessed man, when in much danger and
affliction, often besought God that the temptations might depart from
him: nevertheless God regarded not his request, but his profit, and to
signify this He said, “My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength
is made perfect in weakness.” <span id="fr_1086"></span>[1087](#fn_1086.md)
So that before He hath told him the reason, He benefits him against his
will, and without his knowing it.

<span id="iii.XXV-p54"></span>5. Now what great thing doth He ask, in
requiring us to be thankful in return for such tender care? Let us then
obey, and everywhere keep up this. Since neither were the Jews by
anything ruined so much, as by being unthankful; those many stripes, one
after another, were brought upon them by nothing else than this; or
rather even before those stripes this had ruined and corrupted their
soul. “For the hope of the unthankful,” saith one, “is like the winter’s
hoar frost;” <span id="fr_1087"></span>[1088](#fn_1087.md) it benumbs and
deadens the soul, as that doth our bodies.

<span id="iii.XXV-p56"></span>And this springs from pride, and from
thinking one’s self worthy of something. But the contrite will
acknowledge grounds of thanksgiving to God, not for good things only,
but also for what seem to be adverse; and how much soever he may suffer,
will count none of his sufferings undeserved. Let us then also, the more
we advance in virtue, so much the more make ourselves contrite; for
indeed this, more than anything else is virtue. Because, as the sharper
our sight is, the more thoroughly do we learn how distant we are from
the sky; so the more we advance in virtue, so much the more are we
instructed in the difference between God and us. And this is no small
part of true wisdom, <span id="fr_1088"></span>[1089](#fn_1088.md) to be
able to perceive our own desert. For he best knows himself, who accounts
himself to be nothing. Thus we see that both David and Abraham, when
they were come up to the highest pitch of virtue, then best fulfilled
this; and would call themselves, the one, “earth and ashes,” <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[1090](#fn_1089.md) the other, “a worm;” <span
id="fr_1090"></span>[1091](#fn_1090.md) and all the saints too, like these,
acknowledge their own wretchedness. So that he surely who is lifted up
in boasting, is the very person to be most ignorant of himself.
Wherefore also in our common practice we are wont to say of the proud,
“he knows not himself,” “he is ignorant of himself.” And he that knows
not himself, whom will he know? For as he that knows himself will know
all things, so he who knows not this, neither will he know the rest.

<span id="iii.XXV-p60"></span>Such an one was he that saith, “I will
exalt my throne above the Heavens.” <span
id="fr_1091"></span>[1092](#fn_1091.md) and did not account himself to be
worthy so much as of the title of the apostles, after so many and so
great deeds of goodness.

<span id="iii.XXV-p62"></span>Him therefore let us emulate and follow.
And we shall follow him, if we rid ourselves of earth, and of things on
earth. For nothing makes a man to be so ignorant of himself, as the
being rivetted to worldly concerns: nor does anything again so much
cause men to be rivetted to worldly concerns, as ignorance of one’s
self: for these things depend upon each other. I mean, that as he that
is fond of outward glory, and highly esteems <span id="page_172">p.
172</span> <span id="iii.XXV-Page_172"></span> the things present, if he
strive for ever, is not permitted to understand himself; so he that
overlooks these things will easily know himself; and having come to the
knowledge of himself, he will proceed in order to all the other parts of
virtue.

<span id="iii.XXV-p63"></span>In order therefore that we may learn this
good knowledge, let us, disengaged from all the perishable things that
kindle in us so great flame, and made aware of their vileness, show
forth all lowliness of mind, and self-restraint: that we may attain unto
blessings, both present and future: by the grace and love towards man of
our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom be glory, might, and honor, to the
Father, together with the Holy and Good Spirit, now and ever, and world
without end. Amen.
