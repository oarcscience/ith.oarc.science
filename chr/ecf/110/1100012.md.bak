<span id="IV_1"></span>

<span id="IV_1-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="IV_1-p1.1"></span>Homily IV.</span>

<span id="IV_1-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="IV_1-p2.1"></span>[Matt. I.
17](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#017.md)<span id="IV_1-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="IV_1-p3"></span>“So all the generations from Abraham to David
are fourteen generations, and from David until the carrying away into
Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the carrying away into
Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.”

<span id="IV_1-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="IV_1-p4.1"></span>He</span> hath divided all the generations into
three portions, to indicate that not even when their form of government
was changed did they become better, but alike under an aristocracy, and
under a king, and under an oligarchy, they were in the same evil ways,
and whether popular leaders, or priests, or kings controlled them, it
was no advantage to them in the way of virtue.

<span id="IV_1-p5"></span>But wherefore hath he in the middle portion
passed over three kings, and in the last, having set down twelve
generations, affirmed them to be fourteen? The former question I leave
for you to examine; <span id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) for neither
is it needful for me to explain all things to you, lest ye should grow
indolent: but the second we will explain. <span
id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) To me then he seems in this place to
be putting in the place of a generation, both the time of the captivity,
and Christ Himself, by every means connecting Him with us. And full well
doth he put us in mind of that captivity, making it manifest that not
even when they went down thither, did they become more sober-minded; in
order that from everything His coming may be shown to be necessary.

<span id="IV_1-p8"></span>“Why then,” one may say, “doth not Mark do
this, nor trace Christ’s genealogy, but utter everything briefly?” It
seems to me that Matthew was before the rest in entering on the subject
(wherefore he both sets down the genealogy with exactness, and stops at
those things which require it): but that Mark came after him, which is
why he took a short course, as putting his hand to what had been already
spoken and made manifest. <span id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md)

<span id="IV_1-p10"></span>How is it then that Luke not only traces the
genealogy, but doth it through a greater number? As was natural, Matthew
having led the way, he seeks to teach us somewhat in addition to former
statements. And each too in like manner imitated his master; the one
Paul, who flows fuller than any river; the other Peter, who studies
brevity.

<span id="IV_1-p11"></span>2. And what may be the reason that Matthew
said not at the beginning, in the same way as the prophet, “the vision
which I saw,” and “the word which came unto me”? Because he was writing
unto men well disposed, and exceedingly attentive to him. For both the
miracles that were done cried aloud, and they who received the word were
exceeding faithful. But in the case of the prophets, there were neither
so many miracles to proclaim them; and besides, the tribe of the false
prophets, no small one, was riotously breaking in upon them: to whom the
people of the Jews gave even more heed. This kind of opening therefore
was necessary in their case.

<span id="IV_1-p12"></span>And if ever miracles were done, they were
done for the aliens’ sake, to increase the number of the proselytes; and
for manifestation of God’s power, if haply their enemies having taken
them captives, fancied they prevailed, <span id="page_21">p. 21</span>
<span id="IV_1-Page_21"></span> because their own gods were mighty: like
as in Egypt, out of which no small “mixed multitude” <span
id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md) went up; and, after that, in Babylon,
what befell touching the furnace and the dreams. And miracles were
wrought also, when they were by themselves in the wilderness; as also in
our case: for among us too, when we had just come out of error, many
wonderful works were shown forth; but afterwards they stayed, when in
all countries true religion had taken root.

<span id="IV_1-p14"></span>And what took place at a later period <span
id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md) were few and at intervals; for
example, when the sun stood still in its course, and started back in the
opposite direction. And this one may see to have occurred in our case
also. For so even in our generation, in the instance of him who
surpassed all in ungodliness, I mean Julian, many strange things
happened. Thus when the Jews were attempting to raise up again the
temple at Jerusalem, fire burst out from the foundations, and utterly
hindered them all; and when both his treasurer, <span
id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) and his uncle and namesake, made the
sacred vessels the subject of their open insolence, the one was “eaten
with worms, and gave up the ghost,” <span
id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md) the other “burst asunder in the
midst.” Moreover, the fountains failing, <span
id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md) when sacrifices were made there, and
the entrance of the famine into the cities together with the emperor
himself, was a very great sign. For it is usual with God to do such
things; when evils are multiplied, and He sees His own people afflicted,
and their adversaries greatly intoxicated with their dominion over them,
then to display His own power; which he did also in Persia with respect
to the Jews.

<span id="IV_1-p19"></span>3. Wherefore, that he was not acting without
an object, or by chance, when he distributed Christ’s forefathers into
three portions, is plain from what hath been said. And mark, too, whence
he begins, and where he ends. From Abraham to David; from David to the
captivity of Babylon; from this unto Christ Himself. For both at the
beginning he put the two in close succession, David and Abraham, and
also in summing up he mentions both in the same way. And this, because,
as I have already said, it was to them that the promises were made.

<span id="IV_1-p20"></span>But why can it be, that as he mentioned the
captivity of Babylon, he did not mention also the descent into Egypt?
Because they had ceased to be any longer afraid of the Egyptians, but
the Babylonians they dreaded still. And the one thing was ancient, but
the other fresh, and had taken place of late. And to the one they were
carried down for no sins, but to the other, transgressions were the
cause of their being removed.

<span id="IV_1-p21"></span>And also with regard to the very names, if
any one were to attempt to translate their etymologies, even thence
would he derive great matter of divine speculation, <span
id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) and such as is of great importance
with regard to the New Testament: as, for instance, from Abraham’s name,
from Jacob’s, from Solomon’s, from Zorobabel’s. For it was not without
purpose that these names were given them. But lest we should seem to be
wearisome by running out a great length, let us pass these things by,
and proceed to what is urgent.

<span id="IV_1-p23"></span>4. Having then mentioned all His forefathers,
and ending with Joseph, he did not stop at this, but added, “Joseph the
husband of Mary;” intimating that it was for her sake he traced his
genealogy also. Then, lest when thou hast heard of the “husband of
Mary,” thou shouldest suppose that Christ was born after the common law
of nature, mark, how he sets it right by that which follows. “Thou hast
heard,” saith he, “of an husband, thou hast heard of a mother, thou hast
heard a name assigned to the child, therefore hear the manner too of the
birth.” “The birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise.” <span
id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md) “Of what kind of birth art thou
telling me, I pray thee, since thou hast already mentioned His
ancestors?” “I still wish to tell thee the manner also of His birth.”
Seest thou, how he wakens up the hearer? For as though he were about to
speak of something unusual, <span id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) he
promises to tell also the manner thereof.

<span id="IV_1-p26"></span>And observe a most admirable order in the
things he hath mentioned. For he did not proceed directly to the birth,
but puts us in mind first, how many generations he was from Abraham, how
many from David, and from the captivity of Babylon; and thus he <span
id="page_22">p. 22</span> <span id="IV_1-Page_22"></span> sets the
careful hearer upon considering the times, to show that this is the
Christ who was preached by the prophets. For when thou hast numbered the
generations, and hast learnt by the time that this is He, thou wilt
readily receive likewise the miracle which took place in His birth.
Thus, being about to tell of a certain great thing, His birth of a
virgin, he first shadows over the statement, until he hath numbered the
generations, by speaking of “an husband of Mary;” or rather he doth even
put in short space <span id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) the narration
of the birth itself, and then proceeds to number also the years,
reminding the hearer, that this is He, of whom the patriarch Jacob had
said, He should then at length come, when the Jewish rulers had come to
an end; of whom the prophet Daniel had proclaimed beforehand, that He
should come after those many weeks. And if any one, counting the years
spoken of to Daniel by the angel in a number of weeks, would trace down
the time from the building of the city to His birth, by reckoning he
will perceive the one to agree with the other. <span
id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md)

<span id="IV_1-p29"></span>5. How then was He born, I pray thee? “When
as His mother Mary was espoused:” <span
id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) He saith not “virgin,” but merely
“mother;” so that his account is easy to be received. And so having
beforehand prepared the hearer to look for some ordinary piece of
information, and by this laying hold of him, after all he amazes him by
adding the marvellous fact, saying, “Before they came together, she was
found with child of the Holy Ghost.” He saith not, “before she was
brought to the bridegroom’s house;” for indeed she was therein. It being
the way of the ancients for the most part to keep their espoused wives
in their house: <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md) in those parts,
at least, where one may see the same practised even now. Thus also Lot’s
sons-in-law were in his house with him. Mary then herself likewise was
in the house with Joseph.

<span id="IV_1-p32"></span>And wherefore did she not conceive before her
espousal? It was, as I said at first, that what had been done might be
concealed awhile, and that the Virgin might escape every evil suspicion.
For when he, who had most right of all to feel jealousy, so far from
making her a show, or degrading her, is found even receiving and
cherishing her after her conception; it was quite clear that, unless he
had fully persuaded himself that what was done was of the operation of
the Holy Spirit, he would not have kept her with him, and ministered to
her in all other things. And most properly hath he said, that “she was
‘found’ with child,” the sort of expression that is wont to be used with
respect to things strange, and such as happen beyond all expectation,
and are unlooked for.

<span id="IV_1-p33"></span>Proceed therefore no further, neither require
anything more than what hath been said; neither say thou, “But how was
it that the Spirit wrought this of a virgin?” For if, when nature is at
work, it is impossible to explain the manner of the formation; how, when
the Spirit is working miracles, shall we be able to express these? And
lest thou shouldest weary the evangelist, or disturb him by continually
asking these things, he hath said who it was that wrought the miracle,
and so withdrawn himself. “For I know,” saith he, “nothing more, but
that what was done was the work of the Holy Ghost.”

<span id="IV_1-p34"></span>6. Shame on them who busy themselves touching
the generation on high. For if this birth, which hath witnesses without
number, and had been proclaimed so long a time before, and was
manifested and handled with hands, can by no man be explained; of what
excess of madness do they come short who make themselves busy and
curious touching that unutterable generation? For neither Gabriel nor
Matthew was able to say anything more, but only that it was of the
Spirit; but how, of the Spirit, or in what manner, neither of them hath
explained; for neither was it possible.

<span id="IV_1-p35"></span>Nor think that thou hast learnt all, by
hearing “of the Spirit;” nay, for we are ignorant of many things, even
when we have learnt this; as, for instance, how the Infinite is in a
womb, how He that contains all things is carried, as unborn, by a woman;
how the Virgin bears, and continues a virgin. How, I pray thee, did the
Spirit frame that Temple? how did He take not all the flesh from the
womb, but a part thereof, and increased it, and fashioned it? For that
He did come forth of the Virgin’s flesh, He hath declared by speaking of
“that which was conceived in her;” <span
id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) and Paul, by saying, “made of a
woman;” whereby he stops the mouths of them <span
id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) that say, Christ came among us as
<span id="page_23">p. 23</span> <span id="IV_1-Page_23"></span> through
some conduit. For, if this were so, what need of the womb? If this were
so, He hath nothing in common with us, but that flesh is of some other
kind, and not of the mass which belongs to us. How then was He of the
root of Jesse? How was He a rod? how Son of man? how was Mary His
mother? how was He of David’s seed? how did he “take the form of a
servant?” <span id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) how “was the Word made
flesh?” <span id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) and how saith Paul to
the Romans, “Of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is God
over all?” <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md) Therefore that He was
of us, and of our substance, <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) and
of the Virgin’s womb, is manifest from these things, and from others
beside; but how, is not also manifest. Do not either thou then inquire;
but receive what is revealed, and be not curious about what is kept
secret.

<span id="IV_1-p42"></span>7. “And Joseph her husband, being,” saith he
“a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to
put her away privily.” <span id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md)

<span id="IV_1-p44"></span>Having said that it was of the Holy Ghost,
and without cohabitation, he establishes his statement in another way
again. <span id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) Lest any one should say,
“Whence doth this appear? Who hath heard, who hath seen any such thing
ever come to pass?”—or lest you should suspect the disciple as inventing
these things to favor his Master;—he introduces Joseph as contributing,
by what he underwent, to the proof of the things mentioned; and by his
narrative all but says, “If thou doubt me, and if thou suspect my
testimony, believe her husband.” For “Joseph,” saith he, “her husband,
being a just man.” By “a just man” in this place he means him that is
virtuous in all things. For both freedom from covetousness is justice,
and universal virtue is also justice; <span
id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) and it is mostly in this latter sense
that the Scripture uses the name of justice; as when it saith, “a man
that was just and true;” <span id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) and
again, “they were both just.” <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md)
Being then “just,” that is good and considerate, “he was minded to put
her away privily.” For this intent he tells what took place before
Joseph’s being fully informed, that thou mightest not mistrust what was
done after he knew. However, such a one was not liable to be made a
public example only, but that she should also be punished was the
command of the law. Whereas Joseph remitted not only that greater
punishment, but the less likewise, namely, the disgrace. For so far from
punishing, he was not minded even to make an example of her. Seest thou
a man under self-restraint, and freed from the most tyrannical of
passions. For ye know how great a thing jealousy is: and therefore He
said, to whom these things are clearly known, “For full of jealousy is
the rage of a husband;” <span id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) “he will
not spare in the day of vengeance:” and “jealousy is cruel as the
grave.” <span id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) And we too know of many
that have chosen to give up their lives rather than fall under the
suspicion of jealousy. But in this case it was not so little as
suspicion, the burden of the womb entirely convicting her. But
nevertheless he was so free from passion as to be unwilling to grieve
the Virgin even in the least matters. Thus, whereas to keep her in his
house seemed like a transgression of the law, but to expose and bring
her to trial would constrain him to deliver her to die; he doth none of
these things, but conducts himself now by a higher rule than the law.
For grace being come, there must needs henceforth be many tokens of that
exalted citizenship. For as the sun, though as yet he show not his
beams, doth from afar by his light illumine more than half <span
id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) the world; so likewise Christ, when
about to rise from that womb, even before He came forth, shone over all
the world. Wherefore, even before her travail, prophets danced for joy,
and women foretold what was to come, and John, when he had not yet come
forth from the belly, leaped from the very womb. Hence also this man
exhibited great self-command, in that he neither accused nor upbraided,
but only set about putting her away.

<span id="IV_1-p52"></span>8. The matter then being in this state, and
all at their wits’ end, <span id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) the
angel comes to solve all their difficulties. But it is worth inquiring,
why the angel did not speak sooner, before the husband had such
thoughts: but, “when he thought on it,” not until then, he came; for it
is said, “While he thought on these things, the angel” comes. And yet to
her he declares the good tidings even before she conceived. And this
again contains another difficulty; for even though the angel had not
spoken, wherefore was the Virgin silent, who had been informed by the
angel; and why, when she saw her betrothed husband in trouble, did she
not put an end to his perplexity?

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span> <span id="IV_1-Page_24"></span>

<span id="IV_1-p54"></span>Wherefore then did not the angel speak before
Joseph became troubled. For we must needs explain the former difficulty
first. For what reason then did he not speak? Lest Joseph should be
unbelieving, and the same happen to him as to Zacharias. For when the
thing was visible, belief was thenceforth easy; but when it had not yet
a beginning, it was not equally easy to receive his saying. For this
reason the angel spake not at the first, and through the same cause the
Virgin too held her peace. For she did not think to obtain credit with
her betrothed husband, in declaring to him a thing unheard of, but
rather that she should provoke him the more, as though she were cloking
a sin that had been committed. Since if she herself, who was to receive
so great a favor, is affected somewhat after the manner of man, and
saith, “How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?” <span
id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md) much more would he have doubted; and
especially when hearing it from the woman who was under suspicion.
Wherefore the Virgin saith nothing to him, but the angel, the time
demanding it, presents himself to him.

<span id="IV_1-p56"></span>9. Why then, it may be asked, did he not so
in the Virgin’s case also, and declare the good tidings to her after the
conception? Lest she should be in agitation and great trouble. For it
were likely that she, not knowing the certainty, might have even devised
something amiss touching herself, and have gone on to strangle or to
stab herself, not enduring the disgrace. For wondrous indeed was that
Virgin, and Luke points out her excellency, saying, that when she heard
the salutation, she did not straightway pour herself out, <span
id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) neither did she accept the saying, but
“was troubled,” seeking “what manner of salutation this might be.” <span
id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md) Now she who was of such perfect
delicacy would even have been distracted with dismay at the thought of
her shame, not expecting, by whatever she might say, to convince any one
who should hear of it, but that what had happened was adultery.
Therefore to prevent these things, the angel came before the conception.
Besides that, it was meet that womb should be free from trouble which
the Maker of all things entered; and the soul rid of all perturbation,
which was thought worthy to become the minister of such mysteries. For
these reasons He speaks to the Virgin before the conception, but to
Joseph at the time of travail.

<span id="IV_1-p59"></span>And this many of the simpler sort, not
understanding, have said there is a discordance; because Luke saith it
was Mary to whom he declared the good tidings, but Matthew, that it was
Joseph; not knowing that both took place. And this sort of thing it is
necessary to bear in mind throughout the whole history; for in this way
we shall solve many seeming discordances.

<span id="IV_1-p60"></span>10. The angel then comes, when Joseph is
troubled. For in addition to the causes mentioned, with a view also to
the manifestation of his self-command, he defers his coming. But when
the thing was on the point of taking place, then at last he presents
himself. “While he thought on these things, an angel appeareth to Joseph
in a dream.” <span id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md)

<span id="IV_1-p62"></span>Seest thou the mildness of the husband? So
far from punishing, he did not even declare it to any one, no not even
to her whom he suspected, but was thinking it over with himself, as
aiming to conceal the cause even from the Virgin herself. For neither is
it said that he was minded to “cast her out,” but to “put her away,” so
very mild and gentle was the man. “But while he is thinking on these
things, the angel appeareth in a dream.”

<span id="IV_1-p63"></span>And why not openly, as to the shepherds, and
to Zacharias, and to the Virgin? The man was exceedingly full of faith,
and needed not this vision. Whereas the Virgin, as having declared to
her very exceeding good tidings, greater than to Zacharias, and this
before the event, needed also a marvellous vision; and the shepherds, as
being by disposition rather dull and clownish. <span
id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) But this man, after the
conception, <span id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) and wide the
interval between the two men; wherefore neither was there need of
rebuke.

<span id="IV_1-p66"></span>But by saying, “fear not,” he signifies him
to have been afraid, lest he should give offense to God, as retaining an
adulteress; since, if it had not been for this, he would not have even
thought of casting her out. In all ways then he points out that the
angel came from God, bringing forward and setting before him all, both
what he thought to do, and what he felt in his mind.

<span id="IV_1-p67"></span>Now having mentioned her name, he stayed not
at this, but added also, “thy wife;” whereas he would not have called
her so, if she had been corrupted. And here he calls her that is
espoused “a wife;” as indeed the Scripture is wont to call betrothed
husbands sons-in-law even before marriage.

<span id="IV_1-p68"></span>But what means, “to take unto thee?” To
retain her in his house, for in intention she had been now put away by
him. “Her, being put away, do thou retain,” saith he, “as committed unto
thee by God, not by her parents. And He commits her not for marriage;
but to dwell with thee; and by my voice doth He commit her.” Much as
Christ Himself afterwards committed her to His disciple, so even now
unto Joseph.

<span id="IV_1-p69"></span>12. Then having obscurely signified the
matter in hand, he mentioned not the evil suspicion; but, in a manner
more reverent and seemly, by telling the cause of travail he removed
this also; implying that the very thing which had made him afraid, and
for which he would have cast her out,—this very thing, I say, was a just
cause why he should take her and retain her in his house. Thus more than
entirely <span id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) doing away with his
distress. “For she is not only free,” saith he, “from unlawful
intercourse, but even above all nature is her conception. Not only
therefore put away thy fear, but even rejoice more exceedingly, ‘for
that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.’”

<span id="IV_1-p71"></span>A strange thing it was which he spake of,
surpassing man’s reason, and above all the laws of nature. How then is
he to believe, to whom such tidings are altogether new? “By the things
that are past,” saith he, “by the revelations.” For with this intent he
laid open all things that were in his mind, what he felt, what he
feared, what he was resolved to do;—that by these he might assure
himself of this point.

<span id="IV_1-p72"></span>Or rather, not by things past only, but like
wise by things to come, he wins him over. “And she shall bring forth,”
saith he, “a Son, and thou shalt call His name <span class="c20"><span
id="IV_1-p72.1"></span>Jesus</span>.” <span
id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) “For do not thou, because He is of the
Holy Ghost, imagine that thou art an alien to the ministry of this
dispensation. Since although in the birth thou hast no part, but the
Virgin abode untouched, nevertheless, what pertains to a father, not
injuring the honor of virginity, that do I give thee, to set a Name on
that which is born: for “thou shalt call Him.” For though the offspring
be not thine, yet shalt thou exhibit a father’s care towards Him.
Wherefore I do straightway, even from the giving of the name, connect
thee with Him that is born.”

<span id="IV_1-p74"></span>Then lest on the other hand any one should
from this suspect him to be the father, hear what follows, with what
exact care he states it. “She shall bring forth,” he saith, “a Son:” he
doth not say, “bring forth to thee,” but merely “she shall bring forth,”
putting it indefinitely: <span id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) since
not to him did she bring forth, but to the whole world.

<span id="IV_1-p76"></span>13. For this cause too the angel came
bringing His name from Heaven, hereby again intimating that this is a
wondrous birth: it being God Himself who sends the name from above by
the angel to Joseph. For neither was this without an object, but a
treasure of ten thousand blessings. Wherefore the angel also interprets
it, and suggests good hopes, in this way again leading him to belief.
For to these things we are wont to be more inclined, and therefore are
also fonder of believing them.

<span id="IV_1-p77"></span>So having established his faith by all, by
the past things, by the future, by the present, by the honor given to
himself, he brings in the prophet also in good time, to give his <span
id="page_25">p. 25</span> <span id="IV_1-Page_25"></span> suffrage in
support of all these. But before introducing him, he proclaims
beforehand the good things which were to befall the world through Him.
And what are these? Sins removed and done away. <span
id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md) “For He shall save His people from
their sins.”

<span id="IV_1-p79"></span>Here again the thing is signified to be
beyond all expectation. For not from visible wars, neither from
barbarians, but what was far greater than these, from sins, he declares
the glad tidings of deliverance; a work which had never been possible to
any one before.

<span id="IV_1-p80"></span>But wherefore, one may ask, did he say, “His
people,” and not add the Gentiles also? That he might not startle the
hearer yet a while. For to him that listens with understanding he darkly
signified the Gentiles too. For “His people” are not the Jews only, but
also all that draw nigh and receive the knowledge that is from Him.

<span id="IV_1-p81"></span>And mark how he hath by the way discovered to
us also His dignity, by calling the Jewish nation “His people.” For this
is the word of one implying nought else, but that He who is born is
God’s child, and that the King of those on high is the subject of his
discourse. As neither doth forgiving sins belong to any other power, but
only to that single essence.

<span id="IV_1-p82"></span>14. Forasmuch then as we have partaken of so
great a gift, let us do everything not to dishonor such a benefit. For
if even before this honor, what was done was worthy of punishment, much
more now, after this unspeakable benefit. And this I say not now for no
cause, <span id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) but because I see many
after their baptism living more carelessly than the uninitiated, and
having nothing peculiar to distinguish them in their way of life. It is,
you see, for this cause, that neither in the market nor in the Church is
it possible to know quickly who is a believer and who an unbeliever;
unless one be present at the time of the mysteries, and see the one sort
put out, the others remaining within. Whereas they ought to be
distinguished not by their place, but by their way of life. For as men’s
outward <span id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) dignities are naturally
to be discovered by the outward signs with which they are invested, so
ours ought to be discernible by the soul. That is, the believer ought to
be manifest not by the gift only, but also by the new life. The believer
ought to be the light and salt of the world. But when thou dost not give
light even to thyself, neither bind up thine own gangrene, what remains,
whereby we are to know thee? Because thou hast entered the holy waters?
Nay, this to thee becomes a store <span
id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) of punishment. For greatness of honor
is, to them who do not choose to live worthy of the honor, an increase
of vengeance. Yea, the believer ought to shine forth not only by what he
hath received from God, but also by what he himself hath contributed;
and should be discernible by everything, by his gait, by his look, by
his garb, by his voice. And this I have said, not that display, but that
the profit of beholders, may be the rule by which we frame ourselves.

<span id="IV_1-p86"></span>15. But now, what things soever I might seek
to recognize thee by, I find thee in all points distinguished by the
contraries of the same. For whether by thy place I would fain discern
thee, I see thee spending thy day in horse races, and theatres, and
scenes of lawlessness, in the wicked assemblies in the market places,
and in companies of depraved men; or by the fashion of thy countenance,
I see thee continually laughing to excess, and dissolute as a
grinning <span id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) and abandoned harlot;
or by thy clothes, I see thee in no better trim than the people on the
stage; or by thy followers, thou art leading about parasites and
flatterers; or by thy words, I hear thee say nothing wholesome, nothing
necessary, nothing of moment to our life; or by thy table, yet heavier
from thence will the charge against thee appear.

<span id="IV_1-p88"></span>By what then, tell me, am I to recognize the
believer <span id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) in thee, while all the
things I have mentioned give the contrary sentence? And why do I say,
the believer? since I can not clearly make out whether thou art a man.
For when thou art like an ass, kicking, and like a bull, wantoning, and
like a horse neighing after women; when thou dost play the glutton like
the bear, and pamper thy flesh as the mule, and bear malice like the
camel; <span id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md) also?

<span id="IV_1-p91"></span>Further, if I were bidding thee make another
man gentle, not even so ought I to seem as one enjoining impossible
things; however, thou mightest then object that thou hast not the
control of another’s disposition, and that it doth not altogether rest
with thee. But now it is thine own wild beast, and a thing which
absolutely depends on thee. What plea then hast thou? or what fair
excuse wilt thou be able to put forth, turning as thou art a lion into a
man, and regardless that thou thyself art of a man becoming a lion; upon
the beast bestowing what is above nature, but for thyself not even
preserving what is natural? Yea, while the wild beasts are by thine
earnest endeavors advanced into our noble estate, thou art by thyself
cast down from the throne of the kingdom, and thrust out into their
madness. Thus, imagine, if thou wilt, thy wrath to be a kind of wild
beast, and as much zeal as others have displayed about lions, so much do
thou in regard of thyself, and cause that way of taking things <span
id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md) to become gentle and meek. Because
this too hath grievous teeth and talons, and if thou tame it not, it
will lay waste all things. For not even lion nor serpent hath such power
to rend the vitals as wrath, with its iron talons continually doing so.
Since it mars, we see, not the body only, but the very health likewise
of the soul is corrupted by it, devouring, rending, tearing to pieces
all its strength, and making it useless for everything. For if a man
nourishing worms in his entrails, shall not be able so much as to
breathe, his inward parts all wasting away; how shall we, having so
large a serpent eating up all within us (it is wrath I mean), how, I
say, shall we be able to produce anything noble?

<span id="IV_1-p93"></span>17. How then are we to be freed from this
<span id="page_26">p. 26</span> <span id="IV_1-Page_26"></span> pest? If
we can drink a potion that is able to kill the worms within us and the
serpents. “And of what nature,” it will be asked, “may this potion be,
that hath such power?” The precious Blood of Christ, if it be received
with full assurance, <span id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md) (for this
will have power to extinguish every disease); and together with this the
divine Scriptures carefully heard, and almsgiving added to our hearing;
for by means of all these things we shall be enabled to mortify the
affections that mar our soul. And then only shall we live; for now
surely we are in no better state than the dead: forasmuch as it cannot
be, that while those passions live, we should live too, but we must
necessarily perish. And unless we first kill them here, they will be
sure to kill us in the other life; or rather before that death they will
exact of us, even here, the utmost penalty. Yes, for every such passion
is both cruel and tyrannical and insatiable, and never ceases to devour
us every day. For “their teeth are the teeth of a lion,” <span
id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) or rather even far more fierce. For
the lion, as soon as ever he is satisfied, is wont to leave the carcass
that hath fallen in his way; but these passions neither are satisfied,
nor do they leave the man whom they have seized, until they have set him
nigh the devil. For so great is their power, that the very service which
Paul showed forth to Christ, <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md)
despising both hell and the kingdom for His sake, even this same do they
require of them whom they have seized. For whether it be with the love
of women, or of riches, or of glory, that any one is entangled, he
laughs at hell thenceforth, and despises the kingdom, that he may work
the will of these. Let us not then doubt Paul when he saith that he so
loved Christ. For when some are found so doing service to their
passions, how should that other afterwards seem incredible? Yea, and
this is the reason why our longing for Christ is feebler, because all
our strength is consumed on this love, and we rob, and defraud, and are
slaves to vainglory; than which what can be more worthless?

<span id="IV_1-p97"></span>For though thou shouldest become infinitely
conspicuous, thou wilt be nothing better than the base: rather for this
selfsame cause thou wilt even be baser. For when they who are willing to
give thee glory, and make thee illustrious, do for this very cause
ridicule thee, that thou desirest the glory which comes of them, how can
such instances fail to turn the contrary way in regard of thee. For
indeed this thing is among those which attract censure. So that even as
in the case of one desiring to commit adultery or fornication, should
any one praise or flatter him, by this very act he becomes an accuser
rather than a commender of the person indulging such desires: so with
regard to him who is desirous of glory; when we all praise, it is
accusation rather than praise which we bestow on those who wish to be
made glorious.

<span id="IV_1-p98"></span>18. Why then bring upon thyself that, from
which the very opposite is wont to befall thee. Yea, if thou wilt be
glorified, despise glory; so shalt thou be more illustrious than any.
Why feel as Nebuchadnezzar felt? For he too set up an image, thinking
from wood and from a senseless figure to procure to himself an increase
of fame, and the living would fain appear more glorious by the help of
that which hath no life. Seest thou the excess of his madness; how,
thinking to do honor, he rather offered insult, to himself? For when it
appears that he is relying rather on the lifeless thing, than on himself
and the soul that lives in him, and when for this cause he advances the
stock unto such high precedence, how can he be other than ridiculous,
endeavoring as he doth to adorn himself, not by his way of living, but
by planks of wood? Just as if a man should think proper to give himself
airs, because of the pavement of his house, and his beautiful staircase
rather than because he is a man. Him do many too amongst us imitate now.
For as he for his image, so some men claim to be admired for their
clothes, others for their house; or for their mules and chariots, and
for the columns in their house. For inasmuch as they have lost their
being as men, they go about gathering to themselves from other quarters
such glory as is full of exceeding ridicule.

<span id="IV_1-p99"></span>But as to the noble and great servants of
God, not by these means, but by such as best became them, even by such
did they shine forth. For captives as they were, and slaves, and youths,
and strangers, and stripped of all resources of their own, they proved
at that time far more awful than he who was invested with all these
things. And while Nebuchadnezzar found neither so great an image, nor
satraps, nor captains of the host, nor endless legions, nor abundance of
gold, nor other pomp, enough to meet his desire, and to show him great;
to these, on the other hand, stripped of all this, their high
self-restraint alone was sufficient, and showed him that wore the diadem
and the purple, as much inferior in glory to those who had no such
thing, as the sun is more glorious than a pearl. <span
id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md) For they were led forth in the midst
of the whole world, being at once <span id="page_27">p. 27</span> <span
id="IV_1-Page_27"></span> youths, and captives, and slaves, and
straightway on their appearance the king darted fire from his eyes, and
captains, and deputies, and governors, and the whole amphitheatre of the
devil, stood around; and a voice of pipes from all sides, and of
trumpets, and of all music, borne up to Heaven, was sounding in their
ears, and the furnace burned up to a boundless height, and the flame
reached the very clouds, and all was full of terror and dismay. But none
of these things dismayed them, but they laughed it all to scorn, as they
would children mocking them, and exhibited their courage and meekness,
and uttering a voice clearer than those trumpets, they said, “Be it
known unto thee, O king.” <span id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) For
they did not wish to affront the king, no not so much as by a word, but
to declare their religion <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md) only.
For which cause, neither did they extend their speech to any great
length, but set forth all briefly; “For there is,” say they, “a God in
Heaven, who is able to deliver us,” <span
id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) “why showest thou me the multitude?
why the furnace? why the sharpened swords? why the terrible guards? our
Lord is higher and more mighty than all these.”

<span id="IV_1-p104"></span>Then when they considered that it was
possible that God might be willing even to permit them to be burnt;
lest, if this should come to pass, they might seem to be speaking
falsehoods; they add this also and say, “If this happen not, be it known
unto thee, O king, that we serve not thy gods.” <span
id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) For had they said, “Sins are the cause
of His not delivering us, should He fail to deliver,” they would not
have been believed. Wherefore in this place they are silent on that
subject, though they speak of it in the furnace, again and again
alleging their sins. But before the king they say no such thing; only,
that though they were to be burnt, they would not give up their
religion.

<span id="IV_1-p106"></span>For it was not for rewards and recompenses
that they did what they did, but out of love alone; and yet they were in
captivity too, and in slavery, and had enjoyed no good thing. Yea, they
had lost their country, and their freedom, and all their possessions.
For tell me not of their honors in the king’s courts, for holy and
righteous as they were, they would have chosen ten thousand times rather
to have been beggars at home, and to have been partakers of the
blessings in the temple. “For I had rather,” it is said, “be an
outcast <span id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md) in the house of my God,
than to dwell in the tents of sinners.” And “one day in thy courts is
better than thousands.” <span id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) They
would have chosen then ten thousand times rather to be outcasts at home,
than kings in Babylon. And this is manifest, from what they declare even
in the furnace, grieving at their continuance in that country. For
although themselves enjoyed great honors, yet seeing the calamities of
the rest they were exceedingly vexed; and this kind of thing is most
especially characteristic of saints, that no glory, nor honor, nor
anything else should be more precious to them than their neighbor’s
welfare. See, for example, how even when they were in a furnace, they
made their supplication for all the people. But we not even when at
large bear our brethren in mind. And again, when they were inquiring
about the dreams, <span id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md) they were
looking “not to their own but the common good,” <span
id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md) for that they despised death they
showed by many things afterwards. But everywhere they put themselves
forward, as wishing to prevail <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md)
with God by importunity. Next, as not accounting themselves either to be
sufficient, they flee to the Fathers; but of themselves they said that
they offer nothing more than “a contrite spirit.” <span
id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md)

<span id="IV_1-p113"></span>19. These men then let us also imitate.
Because now too there is set up a golden image, even the tyranny of
Mammon. But let us not give heed to the timbrels, nor to the flutes, nor
to the harps, nor to the rest of the pomp of riches; yea, though we must
needs fall into a furnace of poverty, let us choose it, rather than
worship that idol, and there will be “in the midst a moist whistling
wind.” <span id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) Let us not then shudder
at hearing of “a furnace of poverty.” For so too at that time they that
fell into the furnace were shewn the more glorious, but they that
worshipped were destroyed. Only then all took place at once, but in this
case some part will be accomplished here, some there, some both here and
in the day that is to come. For they that have chosen poverty, in order
that they might not worship mammon, will be more glorious both here and
then, but they that have been rich unjustly here, shall then pay the
utmost penalty.

<span id="IV_1-p115"></span>From this furnace Lazarus too went forth,
not less glorious than those children; but the rich man who was in the
place of them that worshipped the image, was condemned to <span
id="page_28">p. 28</span> <span id="IV_1-Page_28"></span> hell. <span
id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) For indeed what we have now mentioned
was a type of this. Wherefore as in this instance they who fell into the
furnace suffered no hurt, but they who sat without were laid hold of
with great fierceness, so likewise shall it be then. The saints walking
through the river of fire shall suffer no pain, nay they will even
appear joyous; but they that have worshipped the image, shall see the
fire rest upon them fiercer than any wild beast, and draw them in. So
that if any one disbelieves hell, when he sees this furnace, let him
from the things present believe things to come, and fear not the furnace
of poverty, but the furnace of sin. For this is flame and torment, but
that, dew <span id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) and refreshment; and
by this stands the devil, by that, angels wafting aside the flame.

<span id="IV_1-p118"></span>20. These things let them hear that are
rich, that are kindling the furnace of poverty. For though they shall
not hurt those others, “the dew” <span id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md)
coming to their aid; yet themselves they will render an easy prey to the
flame, which they have kindled with their own hands.

<span id="IV_1-p120"></span>Then, an angel went down with those
children; now, let us go down with <span
id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md) them that are in the furnace of
poverty, and by alms-deeds let us make a “dewy air,” <span
id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) and waft the flame quite aside, that
we may be partakers of their crowns also; that the flames of hell may
likewise be scattered by the voice of Christ saying, “Ye saw me an
hungered, and fed me.” <span id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) For that
voice shall then be with us instead of a “moist wind whistling” <span
id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md) through the midst of the flame. Let us
then go down with alms-giving, unto the furnace of poverty; let us
behold them that in self-restraint walk therein, and trample on the
burning coals; let us behold the marvel, strange and beyond thought, a
man singing praise in a furnace, a man giving thanks in fire, chained
unto extreme poverty, yet offering much praise to Christ. Since they,
who bear poverty with thankfulness, really become equal to those
children. For no flame is so terrible as poverty, nor so apt to set us
on fire. But those children were not set on fire; rather, on their
giving thanks to the Lord, their bonds too were at once loosed. So
likewise now, if when thou hast fallen into poverty, thou art thankful,
both the bonds are loosened, and the flame extinguished; or though it be
not extinguished (what is much more marvellous), it becomes a fountain
instead of a flame: which then likewise came to pass, and in the midst
of a furnace they enjoyed a pure dew. For the fire indeed it quenched
not, but the burning of those cast in it altogether hindered. This one
may see in their case also who live by the rules of wisdom, <span
id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222.md) for they, even in poverty, feel more
secure than the rich.

<span id="IV_1-p126"></span>Let us not therefore sit down without the
furnace, feeling no pity towards the poor; lest the same befall us as
then befell those executioners. For if thou shouldest go down to them,
and take thy stand with the children, the fire will no longer work thee
any harm; but if thou shouldest sit above and neglect them in the flame
of their poverty, the flame will burn thee up. Go down therefore into
the fire, that thou mayest not be burnt up by the fire; sit not down
without the fire, lest the flame catch hold of thee. For if it should
find thee amongst the poor, it will depart from thee; but if alienated
from them, it will run upon thee quickly, and catch thee. Do not
therefore stand off from them that are cast in, but when the devil gives
command to cast them that have not worshipped gold into the furnace of
poverty, be not thou of them that cast others in, but of them that are
cast in; that thou mayest be of the number of the saved, and not of the
burned. For indeed it is a most effectual *dew*, to be held in no
subjection by desire of wealth, to be associate with poor persons. These
are wealthier than all, who have trampled under foot the desire of
riches. Forasmuch as those children too, by despising the king at that
time, became more glorious than the king. And thou therefore, if thou
despise the things of the world, shalt become more honorable than all
the world; like those holy men, “of whom the world was not
worthy.” <span id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md)

<span id="IV_1-p128"></span>In order then to become worthy of the things
in Heaven, I bid thee laugh to scorn things present. For in this way
thou shalt both be more glorious here, and enjoy the good things to
come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ; to
whom be glory and might for ever and ever. Amen.

Gnostics. Theodoret, Ep. 145<span id="IV_1-p37.1"></span>. “Valentinus,
and Basilides, and Bardesanes, and Harmonius, and those of their
company, allow indeed the Virgin’s conception and the birth, but affirm
that God the Word took nothing of the Virgin, but in a manner made
Himself a passage through her as through a conduit, and that in
manifesting Himself to men He was employing a mere phantom, and only
seeming to be a man; as He appeared to Abraham and certain other of the
ancients.” S. Epiph. Hær. xxxi. 7. “They affirm that He brought down His
body from Heaven, and that as water through a conduit, so He passed
through the Virgin Mary taking nothing of His mother’s womb, but having
His body from Heaven, as I said before.” Comp. Massuet’s 1st Dissert.
