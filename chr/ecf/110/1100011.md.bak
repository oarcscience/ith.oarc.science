<span id="iii.vi-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.vi-p2.1"></span>[Matt. I.
1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.vi-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="iii.vi-p3"></span>“The book of the generation of Jesus Christ,
the Son of David, the Son of Abraham.”

<span id="iii.vi-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi-p4.1"></span>Behold</span> a third discourse, and we have not
yet made an end of the prefatory matter. It was not then for nought that
I said, It is the nature of these thoughts to have a great depth.

<span id="iii.vi-p5"></span>Come, then, let us speak to-day what
remains. What is it then that is now required? Why Joseph’s genealogy is
traced, who had no part in the birth. And one cause we have mentioned
already; but it is necessary to mention likewise the other, that which
is more mystical and secret than the first. What then is this? He would
not that it should be manifest to the Jews, at the time of the birth,
that Christ was born of a virgin.

<span id="iii.vi-p6"></span>Nay, be not troubled at the strangeness of
the saying. For it is no statement of mine, but of our fathers,
wonderful and illustrious men. <span id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md)
For if He disguised many things from the first, calling Himself Son of
Man, and hath not everywhere clearly unfolded to us <span
id="page_15">p. 15</span> <span id="iii.vi-Page_15"></span> even His
equality with the Father; why dost thou wonder at His having for a time
disguised this also, taking order as He was for a certain great and
marvellous purpose? <span id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) and would
have condemned her for adultery. For if in regard to the other matters,
for which they had frequent precedents likewise in the old dispensation,
they were quite shameless in their obstinacy <span
id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md) (for so, because He had cast out
devils, they called Him possessed; and because He healed on the Sabbath
day, they supposed Him to be an adversary of God; and yet oftentimes
even before this had the Sabbath been broken), what would they not have
said, if this had been told them? Especially as <span
id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md) they had all time before this on their
side, in that it never had produced any such thing. For if after so many
miracles they still called Him son of Joseph, how before the miracles
would they have believed that He was born of a virgin?

<span id="iii.vi-p12"></span>It is then for this reason that both Joseph
has his genealogy traced, and the Virgin betrothed to him. For if even
he, who was both a just and wondrous man, required many things, in order
that he should receive that which had come to pass; an angel, and the
vision in dreams, and the testimony from the prophets; how could the
Jews, being both dull and depraved, and of so unfriendly spirit towards
Him, have admitted this idea into their minds? For the strangeness and
novelty thereof would be sure greatly to disturb them, and the fact that
they had never so much as heard of such a thing having happened in the
times of their forefathers. For as the man who was once persuaded that
He is Son of God, would after that have no cause to doubt concerning
this too; so he who was accounting Him to be a deceiver and an adversary
of God, how could he but have been yet more offended by this, and have
been led on unto the opposite <span id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md)
notion? For this cause neither do the apostles at the first directly say
this, but while of His resurrection they discourse much and often
(forasmuch as of this there were examples in the times before, although
not such as this); that He was born of a virgin they do not say always:
nay, not even His mother herself ventured to utter this. See, for
instance, what saith the Virgin even to Himself: “Behold, Thy father and
I have sought Thee.” <span id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md) For if this
suspicion had been entertained, neither would He any longer have been
accounted to be a Son of David, and this opinion not being held, many
other evils besides would have arisen. For this cause neither do the
angels say these things to all, but to Mary only, and Joseph; but when
showing to the shepherds the glad tidings of that which was come to
pass, they no longer added this.

<span id="iii.vi-p15"></span>2. But why is it, that having mentioned
Abraham, and having said that “he begat Isaac, and Isaac, Jacob;” and
not having made any mention of his brother; when he is come to Jacob, he
remembers both “Judah, and his brethren”? Now there are some that say,
it was because of the perverseness of Esau, and of the rest that came
before. But I should not say this; for if it were so, how is it that he
a little after mentions such women? It being out of contraries, in this
place, that His glory is manifested; not by having great forefathers,
but low and of little account. For to the lofty One it is a great glory
to be able to abase Himself exceedingly. Wherefore then did He not
mention them? Because Saracens, and Ishmaelites, and Arabians, and as
many as are sprung from those ancestors, have nothing in common with the
race of the Israelites. For this cause then he passes over those in
silence, and hastens on to His forefathers, and those of the Jewish
people. Wherefore he saith, “And Jacob begat Judas and his brethren.”
For at this point the race of the Jews begins to have its peculiar mark.

<span id="iii.vi-p16"></span>3. “And Judas begat Phares and Zara of
Thamar.” <span id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md) “What doest thou, O
man, putting us in remembrance of a history that contains an unlawful
intercourse?” But why is this said? <span
id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) Since, if we were recounting the race
of a mere man, one might naturally have been silent touching these
things; but if of God Incarnate, so far from being silent, one ought to
make a glory of them, showing forth His tender care, and His power. Yea,
it was for this cause He came, not to escape our disgraces, but to bear
them away. Therefore as He is the more admired, in that He not only
died, but was even crucified (though the thing be opprobrious, yet the
more opprobrious the more doth it show Him full of love to man), so
likewise may we speak touching His birth; it is not only because He took
flesh upon Him, and became man, that we justly stand amazed at Him, but
because He vouchsafed to have also such kinsfolk, <span id="page_16">p.
16</span> <span id="iii.vi-Page_16"></span> being in no respect ashamed
of our evils. And this He was proclaiming from the very beginnings of
His birth, that He is ashamed of none of those things that belong to us;
while He teaches us also hereby, never to hide our face at our
forefathers’ wickedness, but to seek after one thing alone, even virtue.
For such a man, though he have an alien for his ancestor, though he have
a mother who is a prostitute, or what you will, can take no hurt
thereby. For if the whoremonger himself, being changed, is nothing
disgraced by his former life, much more will the wickedness of his
ancestry have no power to bring to shame him that is sprung of an harlot
or an adulteress, if he be virtuous.

<span id="iii.vi-p19"></span>But he did these things not only to
instruct us, but also to bring down the haughtiness of the Jews. For
since they, negligent about virtue in their own souls, were parading the
name of Abraham, <span id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) thinking they
had for a plea their forefathers’ virtue; he shows from the very
beginning that it is not in these things men ought to glory, but in
their own good deeds.

<span id="iii.vi-p21"></span>Besides this, he is establishing another
point also, to show that all are under sin, even their forefathers
themselves. At least their patriarch and namesake is shown to have
committed no small sin, for Thamar stands against him, to accuse his
whoredom. And David too had Solomon by the wife whom he corrupted. But
if by the great ones the law was not fulfilled, much more by the less.
And if it was not fulfilled, all have sinned, and Christ’s coming is
become necessary.

<span id="iii.vi-p22"></span>For this cause he made mention also of the
twelve patriarchs, by this again bringing down their pride at the noble
birth of their fathers. Because many of these also were born of women
that were slaves; but nevertheless the difference of the parents did not
make a difference in the children. For all were equally both patriarchs
and heads of tribes. For this is the precedence of the Church, this the
prerogative of the nobility that is among us, taking its type from the
beginning. So that whether thou be bond or free, thou hast from thence
nothing more nor less; but the question is all about one thing only,
namely, the mind, and the disposition of the soul.

<span id="iii.vi-p23"></span>4. But besides what we have said, there is
another cause also, wherefore he hath mentioned even this history; for
to be sure, Zara’s name was not cast at random on that of Phares. (For
indeed it was irrelevant, and superfluous, when he had mentioned Phares,
from whom he was to trace Christ’s genealogy, to mention Zara also.)
Wherefore then did he mention him? When Thamar was on the point of
giving birth to them, the pangs having come upon her, Zara put forth his
hand first. <span id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) Then the midwife,
when she saw this, in order that the first should be known, bound his
hand with scarlet; but the child, when he was bound, drew in his hand,
and when he had drawn it in, Phares came forth first, and then Zara. The
midwife when she saw this said, “Why was the hedge broken up for
thee?” <span id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md)

<span id="iii.vi-p26"></span>Seest thou the dark expression of
mysteries? For it was not without purpose that these things were
recorded for us: since neither was it worth our study to learn, what it
might be that the midwife said; nor worth a narrative to know, that he
who came out second, put forth his hand first. What then is the
mysterious lesson? <span id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) First, from
the name of the child <span id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) we learn
what is inquired, for Phares is “a division,” and “a breach.” And
moreover from the thing itself, which took place; for it was not in the
order of nature that, having thrust out his hand, he should draw it in
again when bound; these thing neither belonged to a movement directed by
reason, nor did they take place in the way of natural consequence. For
after the hand had found its way out, that another child should come
forth before was perhaps not unnatural; but that he should draw it back,
and give a passage for another, was no longer after the manner of
children at the birth, but the grace of God was present with the
children, ordering these things, and sketching out for us by them a sort
of image of the things that were to come.

<span id="iii.vi-p29"></span>What then? Some of those who have examined
these things accurately say, that these children are a type of the two
nations. <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) <span id="page_17">p.
17</span> <span id="iii.vi-Page_17"></span> And so in order that thou
mightest learn that the polity of the latter people shone forth
previously to the origin of the former, the child that hath the hand
stretched forth doth not show itself entire, but draws even it in again;
and after his brother had glided forth whole, then he too appears
entire. And this took place also with regard to the two nations. I mean,
that after the polity of the Church had been manifested in the times of
Abraham, and then had been withdrawn in the midst of its course, the
Jewish people came, and the legal polity, and then the new people
appeared entire with their own laws. Wherefore also the midwife saith,
“Why was the hedge broken up for thee?” because the law coming in had
broken in upon the freedom of the polity. For indeed the Scripture is
ever wont to call the law a hedge; as the prophet saith: “Thou hast
broken down her hedge, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck
off her grapes:” <span id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md) and, “I have
set a hedge about it:” <span id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md) and Paul,
“Having broken down the middle wall of the hedge.” <span
id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) But others say, that the saying, “Why
was the hedge broken up for thee?” was spoken touching the new people:
for this at its coming put down the law. <span
id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md)

<span id="iii.vi-p36"></span>5. Seest thou that it was not for few nor
small causes that he brought to our remembrance the whole history
concerning Judah? For this end he hath mentioned Ruth also and Rahab,
the one an alien, the other an harlot, that thou mayest learn that He
came to do away with all our ills. For He hath come as a Physician, not
as a Judge. Therefore in like manner as those of old took harlots for
wives, even so God too espoused unto Himself the nature which had played
the harlot: and this also prophets <span
id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md) from the beginning declare to have
taken place with respect to the Synagogue. But that spouse was
ungrateful towards Him who had been an husband to her, whereas, the
Church, when once delivered from the evils received from our fathers,
continued to embrace the Bridegroom.

<span id="iii.vi-p38"></span>See, for instance, what befell Ruth, how
like it is to the things which belong to us. For she was both of a
strange race, and reduced to the utmost poverty, yet Boaz when he saw
her neither despised her poverty nor abhorred her mean birth, as Christ
having received the Church, being both an alien and in much poverty,
took her to be partaker of the great blessings. But even as Ruth, if she
had not before left her father, and renounced household and race,
country and kindred, would not have attained unto this alliance; so the
Church too, having forsaken the customs which men had received from
their fathers, then, and not before, <span
id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md) became lovely to the Bridegroom. Of
this therefore the prophet discourses unto her, and saith, “Forget thy
people, and thy father’s house, so shall the king have pleasure in thy
beauty.” <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) This Ruth did too, and
because of this she became a mother of kings, even as the Church did
likewise. For of her David himself sprung. So then to shame them by all
these things, and to prevail on them not to be high-minded, he hath both
composed the genealogy, and brought forward these women. Yes, for this
last, through those who intervened, was parent to the great king, and of
these David is not ashamed. For it cannot, nay, it cannot be that a man
should be good or bad, obscure or glorious, either by the virtue or by
the vice of his forefathers; but if one must say somewhat even
paradoxical, he shines forth the more, who not being of worthy
ancestors, has yet become excellent.

<span id="iii.vi-p41"></span>6. Let no one therefore be high-minded on
account of these matters, but let him consider the forefathers of the
Lord, and put away all his haughtiness, and let good actions be his
pride; or rather, not even these. For thus it was that the Pharisee came
to be inferior to the Publican. Thus, if thou wouldest show the good
work to be great, have no high thought, <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) and thou hast proved it so much the
greater. Make account that thou hast done nothing, and then thou hast
done all. For if, being sinners, when we account ourselves to be what we
are, we <span id="page_18">p. 18</span> <span
id="iii.vi-Page_18"></span> become righteous, as indeed the Publican
did; how much more, when being righteous we account ourselves to be
sinners. Since if out of sinners men are made righteous by a lowly mind
(although this were not to be lowly-minded but to be right-minded); if
then to be right-minded avails so much in the case of sinners, consider
what will not lowliness of mind do with respect to righteous men.

<span id="iii.vi-p43"></span>Do not then mar thy labors, nor cast away
from thee the fruits of thy toils, neither run thou in vain, making
frustrate all thy labor after the many courses thou hast run. Nay, for
thy Lord knows thy good works better than thou dost. Though thou give
but a cup of cold water, not even this doth He overlook; though thou
contribute but a farthing, though thou shouldest utter a sigh only, He
receives it all with great favor and is mindful thereof, and assigns for
it great rewards.

<span id="iii.vi-p44"></span>But wherefore dost thou search out thine
own doings, and bring them out before us continually? Knowest thou not,
that if thou praise thyself, God will no more praise thee? even as if
thou bewail *thyself*, <span id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) He will
not cease proclaiming thee before all. For it is not at all His will
that thy labors should be disparaged. Why do I say, disparaged? Nay, He
is doing and contriving all things, so that even for little He may crown
thee; and He goes about seeking excuses, whereby thou mayest be
delivered from hell. For this cause, though thou shouldest work but the
eleventh hour of the day, He gives thy wages entire; and though thou
afford no ground of salvation, He saith, “I do it for mine own sake,
that my name be not profaned:” <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md)
though thou shouldest sigh only, though thou shouldest only weep, all
these things He quickly catches hold of, for an occasion of saving thee.

<span id="iii.vi-p47"></span>Let us not therefore lift up ourselves, but
let us declare ourselves unprofitable, that we may become profitable.
For if thou call thyself approved, thou art become unprofitable, though
thou wert approved; but if useless, thou art become profitable, even
though thou wert reprobate.

<span id="iii.vi-p48"></span>7. Wherefore it is necessary to forget our
good actions. “Yet how is it possible,” one may say, “not to know these
things with which we are well acquainted?” How sayest thou? Offending
thy Lord perpetually, thou livest delicately, and laughest, and dost not
so much as know that thou hast sinned, but hast consigned all to
oblivion; and of thy good actions canst thou not put away the memory?
And yet fear is a stronger kind of thing. But we do the very contrary;
on the one hand, whilst each day we are offending, we do not so much as
put it before our mind; on the other, if we give a little money to a
poor person, this we are ever revolving. This kind of conduct comes of
utter madness, and it is a very great loss to him who so makes his
reckoning. <span id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) For the secure
storehouse of good works is to forget our good works. And as with regard
to raiment and gold, when we expose them in a market-place, we attract
many ill-meaning persons; but if we put them by at home and hide them,
we shall deposit them all in security: even so with respect to our good
deeds; if we are continually keeping them in memory, we provoke the
Lord, we arm the enemy, we invite him to steal them away; but if no one
know of them, besides Him who alone ought to know, they will lie in
safety.

<span id="iii.vi-p50"></span>Be not therefore for ever parading them,
lest some one should take them away. As was the case with the Pharisee,
for bearing them about upon his lips; whence also the devil caught them
away. And yet it was with thanksgiving he made mention of them, and
referred the whole to God. But not even did this suffice Him. For it is
not thanksgiving to revile others, to be vainglorious before many, to
exalt one’s self against them that have offended. Rather, if thou art
giving thanks to God, be content with Him only, and publish it not unto
men, neither condemn thy neighbor; for this is not thanksgiving.
Wouldest thou learn words of thanksgiving? hearken unto the Three
Children, saying, “We have sinned, we have transgressed. Thou art
righteous, O Lord, in all that thou hast done unto us, because thou hast
brought all things upon us by a true judgment.” <span
id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) For to confess <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) one’s own sins, this is to give thanks
with confession <span id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md) unto God: a kind
of thing which implies one to be guilty of numberless offenses, yet not
to have the due penalty exacted. This man most of all is the giver of
thanks.

<span id="iii.vi-p54"></span>8. Let us beware therefore of saying
anything about ourselves, for this renders us both odious with men and
abominable to God. For this reason, the greater the good works we do,
the less let us say of ourselves; this being the way to reap the
greatest glory both with men and with God. Or rather, not only glory
from God, but a reward, yea, a great recompense. Demand not therefore a
reward that thou mayest receive a reward. <span id="page_19">p.
19</span> <span id="iii.vi-Page_19"></span> Confess thyself to be saved
by grace, that He may profess Himself a debtor to thee; and not for thy
good works only, but also for such rightness of mind. For when we do
good works, we have Him debtor for our good works only; but when we do
not so much as think we have done any good work, then also for this
disposition itself; and more for this, than for the other things: so
that this is equivalent to our good works. For should this be absent,
neither will they appear great. For in the same way, we too, when we
have servants, <span id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md) do then most
approve them when, after having performed all their service with good
will, they do not think they have done anything great. Wherefore, if
thou wouldest make thy good deeds great, do not think them to be great,
and then they will be great.

<span id="iii.vi-p56"></span>It was in this way that the centurion also
said, “I am not fit that thou shouldest enter under my roof;” because of
this, he became worthy, and was “marvelled at” <span
id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md) above all Jews. On this wise again
Paul saith, “I am not meet to be called an apostle;” <span
id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md) because of this he became even first
of all. So likewise John: “I am not meet to loose the latchet of His
shoe;” <span id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md) because of this he was
the “friend of the Bridegroom,” and the hand which he affirmed to be
unworthy to touch His shoes, this did Christ draw unto His own
head. <span id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md) So Peter too said, “Depart
from me, for I am a sinful man;” <span id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md)
because of this he became a foundation of the Church.

<span id="iii.vi-p62"></span>For nothing is so acceptable to God as to
number one’s self with the last. This is a first principle of all
practical wisdom. <span id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md) For he that is
humbled, and bruised in heart, will not be vainglorious, will not be
wrathful, will not envy his neighbor, will not harbor any other passion.
For neither when a hand is bruised, though we strive ten thousand times,
shall we be able to lift it up on high. If therefore we were thus to
bruise our heart <span id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) likewise,
though it were stirred by ten thousand swelling passions, it could not
be lifted up, no, not ever so little. For if a man, by mourning for
things pertaining to this life, drives out all the diseases of his soul,
much more will he, who mourns for sins, enjoy the blessing of
self-restraint. <span id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md)

<span id="iii.vi-p66"></span>9. “But who,” one may say, “will be able
thus to bruise his own heart?” Listen to David, who became illustrious
chiefly because of this, and see the contrition of his soul. How after
ten thousand good works, and when he was on the point of being deprived
of country, and home, and life itself, at the very season of his
calamity, seeing a vile and outcast common soldier trample on the turn
of his fortunes <span id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md) and revile him;
so far from reviling him again, he utterly forbad one of his captains,
who was desirous to have slain him, saying, “Let him alone, for the Lord
hath bidden him.” <span id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md) And again,
when the priests desired to carry about the ark *of God* <span
id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) with him, he did not permit it; but
what doth he say? <span id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) “Let me set it
down in the temple, and if God deliver me from the dangers that are
before me, I shall see the beauty thereof; but if He say to me, I have
no delight in thee, behold, here am I, let Him do to me as seemeth good
unto Him.” And that which was done with regard to Saul, again and again,
even oftentimes, what excellence of self-restraint doth it not show?
Yea, for he even surpassed the old law, and came near to the apostolic
injunctions. For this cause he bore with contentedness all that came
from the Lord’s hands; not contending against what befell him, but
aiming at one object alone, namely, in everything to obey, and follow
the laws set by Him. And when after so many noble deeds on his part, he
saw the tyrant, the parricide, the murderer of his own brother, that
injurious, that frenzied one, possessing in his stead his own kingdom,
not even so was he offended. But “if this please God,” saith he, “that I
should be chased, and wander, and flee, and that he should be in honor,
I acquiesce, and accept it, and do thank God for His many afflictions.”
Not like many of the shameless and impudent ones, who when they have not
done, no not the least part of his good works, yet if they see any in
prosperity, and themselves enduring a little discouragement, ruin their
own souls by ten thousand blasphemies. But David was not such an one;
rather he showed forth all modesty. <span
id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) Wherefore also God said, “I have found
David, the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart.” <span
id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md)

<span id="iii.vi-p73"></span>Such a spirit as this let us too acquire,
and whatever we may suffer we shall bear it easily, and before the
Kingdom, we shall reap here the gain accruing from lowliness of <span
id="page_20">p. 20</span> <span id="iii.vi-Page_20"></span> mind. Thus
“learn,” saith He, “of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye
shall find rest unto your souls.” <span
id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) Therefore in order that we may enjoy
rest both here and hereafter, let us with great diligence implant in our
souls the mother of all things that are good, I mean humility. For thus
we shall be enabled both to pass over the sea of this life without
waves, and to end our voyage in that calm harbor; by the grace and love
towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might for
ever and ever. Amen.

πρχθη</span>. “Now the virginity of Mary, and her delivery, was kept in
secret from the prince of this world, as was also the Lord’s death;
three most notable mysteries, yet done in Secret of God.” \[See
*Ante-Nicene Fathers*, Vol. I., p. 57. The Greek given in this note is
from the “briefer” form of the Ignatian Epistles. But the “longer” form
differs very little, and the Syriac version, brief as it is, contains
this sentence.—R.\] And Origen, 6th Homily on St. Luke, says, “It has
been well written in one of the epistles of a certain martyr, I mean
Ignatius, the next Bishop of Antioch after the blessed Peter, him who
fought with wild beasts in the persecution at Rome, ‘Now the virginity
of Mary was kept in secret from the prince of this world.’ It was
concealed because of Joseph, because of her espousals, because she was
supposed to have a husband. For, had she had no spouse or supposed
husband, it could not have been concealed from the prince of this world.
For presently the thought would have silently occurred to the evil one,
‘How is she with child, who knoweth not a man? This conception must be
divine, it must be something higher than human nature.’ On the contrary,
our Saviour had purposed that the devil should be ignorant of his
Œconomy and Incarnation: for which cause He both in His birth concealed
the same, and commanded His disciples afterwards that they should not
make Him known. Also when tempted by the devil in person, He no where
owned Himself Son of God.” Origen then quotes [1 Cor. ii.
6-8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md)<span id="iii.vi-p7.3"></span>, to
the same effect. And in answer to the objection, How the devils which
were from time to time cast out knew Him to be the Son of God, he
suggests that it might be owing to their inferiority in malice and
mischief: according to the rule among men, that the worse they are, the
less they can know of Christ. \[The *Homilies* of Origen are not
included in the *Ante-Nicene Fathers*.\]

Compare the 62d Homily on Genesis, t. i. 478, ed. Sav. “Zara being
interpreted, is ‘the East.’ And that these things did not take place at
random, but were a type of what was to come, the facts themselves
indicate. For that which happened was not in the order of nature. For
how was it possible, when the hand had been bound with the scarlet
thread, for it to be again drawn back to afford passage to him who came
after had there not been some divine power which before ordained these
things, and as in a kind of shadow drew out this figure; that at first
and from the beginning Zara (that is the East, which is the type of the
Church) began to increase, and after it had made a little progress and
then retired, the observance of the Law, represented by Phares, came in:
and after prevailing a long time, on a second advance of Zara, who had
before retired, made room on the contrary for the Church; I mean, the
whole Jewish polity did so.”

<span id="iii.vi-p31"></span>“Perhaps, however, it is necessary now to
state the matter more briefly and clearly. There was a beginning, like
the putting forth of Zara’s hand, in Abel, Enoch, Noah, Melchisedek,
Abraham, making extreme account of what might please God. Afterwards,
when they had grown into a multitude, and had heaped on themselves heavy
burdens of sin, and needed the benefit of some slight consolation, the
Law was given as a kind of shadow, not as taking away sins, but as
declaring and making them manifest: that as imperfect children living on
milk they might be capable of attaining full age. But when even thus
they failed of profiting, yea, kept mingling themselves up again with
their sins, all the while that the Law was pointing out the greatness of
the same, He came who is our common Lord, and freely bestowed on mankind
this present spiritual polity, full of all virtue, whereof Zara was to
stand as a type. For this cause the evangelist also both mentioned
Thamar and her children, saying, ‘Judas begat Pharez and Zarah of
Thamar.’” Compare also St. Cyr. of Alex. 6 lib. in Gen. t. i. 201, ed.
Aubert; Theod. in Gen. qu. 96; St. Aug. in [Ps.
61](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#000.md)<span id="iii.vi-p31.1"></span>, t.
iv. 442, D. \[A good specimen of the allegorizing exegesis which even

position of first-born.—R.\]
