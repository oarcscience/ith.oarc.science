<span id="iii.XXX-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iii.XXX-p1.1"></span>Homily XXX.</span>

<span id="iii.XXX-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.XXX-p2.1"></span>[Matt. IX.
9](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.XXX-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="iii.XXX-p3"></span>*“And as Jesus passed forth from thence, He
saw a man sitting at the receipt of custom,* <span
id="fr_1249"></span>[1250](#fn_1249.md) *named Matthew; and He saith unto
him, Follow me.”*

<span id="iii.XXX-p5"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.XXX-p5.1"></span>For</span> when He had performed the miracle,
He did not remain, lest, being in sight, He should kindle their jealousy
the more; but He indulges them by retiring, and soothing their passion.
This then let us also do, not encountering them that are plotting
against us; let us rather soothe their wound, giving way and relaxing
their vehemence.

<span id="iii.XXX-p6"></span>But wherefore did He not call him together
with Peter and John and the rest? As in their case He had come at that
time, when He knew the men would obey Him; so Matthew also He then
called when He was assured he would yield himself. And therefore Paul
again He took, as a fisher his prey, after the resurrection. Because He
who is acquainted with the hearts, and knows the secrets of each man’s
mind, knew also when each of these would obey. Therefore not at the
beginning did He call him, when he was yet in <span id="page_195">p.
195</span> <span id="iii.XXX-Page_195"></span> rather a hardened state,
but after His countless miracles, and the great fame concerning Him,
when He knew him to have actually become more prepared for obedience.

<span id="iii.XXX-p7"></span>And we have cause also to admire the
self-denial <span id="fr_1250"></span>[1251](#fn_1250.md) of the
evangelist, how he disguises not his own former life, but adds even his
name, when the others had concealed him under another appellation. <span
id="fr_1251"></span>[1252](#fn_1251.md)

<span id="iii.XXX-p10"></span>But why did he say he was “sitting at the
receipt of custom?” To indicate the power of Him that called him, that
it was not when he had left off or forsaken this wicked trade, but from
the midst of the evils He drew him up; much as He converted the blessed
Paul also when frantic and raging, and darting fire; which thing he
himself makes a proof of the power of Him that called him, saying to the
Galatians, “Ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’
religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God.” <span
id="fr_1252"></span>[1253](#fn_1252.md) And the fishermen too He called
when they were in the midst of their business. But that was a craft not
indeed in bad report, but of men rather rudely bred, not mingling with
others, and endowed with great simplicity; whereas the pursuit now in
question was one full of all insolence and boldness, and a mode of gain
whereof no fair account could be given, a shameless traffic, a robbery
under cloak of law: yet nevertheless He who uttered the call was ashamed
of none of these things.

<span id="iii.XXX-p12"></span>And why talk I of His not being ashamed of
a publican? since even with regard to a harlot woman, so far from being
ashamed to call her, He actually permitted her to kiss His feet, and to
moisten them with her tears. <span id="fr_1253"></span>[1254](#fn_1253.md)
Yea, for to this end He came, not to cure bodies only, but to heal
likewise the wickedness of the soul. Which He did also in the case of
the paralytic; and having shown clearly that He is able to forgive sins,
then, not before, He comes to him whom we are now speaking of; that they
might no more be troubled at seeing a publican chosen into the choir of
the disciples. For He that hath power to undo all our offenses, why
marvel if He even make this man an apostle?

<span id="iii.XXX-p14"></span>But as thou hast seen the power of Him
that called, so consider also the obedience of him that was called: how
he neither resisted, nor disputing said, “What is this? Is it not indeed
a deceitful calling, wherewith He calls me, being such as I am?” nay;
for this humility again had been out of season: but he obeyed
straightway, and did not even request to go home, and to communicate
with his relations concerning this matter; as neither indeed did the
fishermen; but as they left their net and their ship and their father,
so did he his receipt of custom and his gain, and followed, exhibiting a
mind prepared for all things; and breaking himself at once away from all
worldly things, by his complete obedience he bare witness that He who
called him had chosen a good time.

<span id="iii.XXX-p15"></span>And wherefore can it be, one may say, that
he hath not told us of the others also, how and in what manner they were
called; but only of Peter and James, and John and Philip, and nowhere of
the others? <span id="fr_1254"></span>[1255](#fn_1254.md)

<span id="iii.XXX-p17"></span>Because these more than others were in so
strange and mean ways of life. For there is nothing either worse than
the publican’s business, or more ordinary than fishing. And that Philip
also was among the very ignoble, is manifest from his country. Therefore
these especially they proclaim to us, with their ways of life, to show
that we ought to believe them in the glorious parts of their histories
also. For they who choose not to pass by any of the things which are
accounted reproachful, but are exact in publishing these more than the
rest, whether they relate to the Teacher or to the disciples; how can
they be suspected in the parts which claim reverence? more especially
since many signs and miracles are passed over by them, while the events
of the cross, accounted to be reproaches, they utter with exact care and
loudly; and the disciples’ pursuits too, and their faults, and those of
their Master’s ancestry who were notorious for sins, <span
id="fr_1255"></span>[1256](#fn_1255.md) they discover with a clear voice.
Whence it is manifest that they made much account of truth, and wrote
nothing for favor, nor for display.

<span id="iii.XXX-p19"></span>2. Having therefore called him, He also
honored him with a very great honor by partaking straightway of his
table; for in this way He would both give him good hope for the future,
and lead him on to a greater confidence. <span
id="fr_1256"></span>[1257](#fn_1256.md) For not in a long time, but at
once, He healed his vice. And not with him only doth He sit down to
meat, but with many others also; although this very thing was accounted
a charge against Him, that He chased not away the sinners. But neither
do they conceal this point, what sort of blame is endeavored to be fixed
on His proceedings.

<span id="iii.XXX-p21"></span>Now the publicans come together as to one
of the same trade; for he, exulting <span
id="fr_1257"></span>[1258](#fn_1257.md) in the entrance of Christ, had
called them all together. The fact is, Christ used to try every kind of
treatment; and not when discoursing only, nor when healing, nor when
reproving <span id="page_196">p. 196</span> <span
id="iii.XXX-Page_196"></span> His enemies, but even at His morning meal,
He would often correct such as were in a bad way; hereby teaching us,
that every season and every work may by possibility afford us profit.
And yet surely what was then set before them came of injustice and
covetousness; but Christ refused not to partake of it, because the
ensuing gain was to be great: yea rather He becomes partaker of the same
roof and table with them that have committed such offenses. For such is
the quality of a physician; unless he endure the corruption of the sick,
he frees them not from their infirmity.

<span id="iii.XXX-p23"></span>And yet undoubtedly He incurred hence an
evil report: first by eating with him, then in Matthew’s house, and
thirdly, in company with many publicans. See at least how they reproach
Him with this. “Behold a man gluttonous, and a wine-bibber, a friend of
publicans and sinners.” <span id="fr_1258"></span>[1259](#fn_1258.md)

<span id="iii.XXX-p25"></span>Let them hear, as many as are striving to
deck themselves with great honor for fasting, and let them consider that
our Lord was called “a man gluttonous and a winebibber,” and He was not
ashamed, but overlooked all these things, that he might accomplish what
He had set before him; which indeed was accordingly done. For the
publican was actually converted, and thus became a better man.

<span id="iii.XXX-p26"></span>And to teach thee that this great thing
was wrought by his partaking of the table with Him, hear what Zacchæus
saith, another publican. I mean, when he heard Christ saying, “To-day, I
must abide in thy house,” the delight gave him wings, and he saith, “The
half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from
any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.” <span
id="fr_1259"></span>[1260](#fn_1259.md) And to him Jesus saith, “This day
is salvation come to this house.” So possible is it by all ways to give
instruction.

<span id="iii.XXX-p28"></span>But how is it, one may say, that Paul
commands, “If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or
covetous, with such an one no, not to eat?” <span
id="fr_1260"></span>[1261](#fn_1260.md) In the first place, it is not as
yet manifest, whether to teachers also he gives this charge, and not
rather to brethren only. Next, these were not yet of the number of the
perfect, <span id="fr_1261"></span>[1262](#fn_1261.md) nor of those who had
become brethren. And besides, Paul commands, even with respect to them
that had become brethren, then to shrink from them, when they continue
as they were, but these had now ceased, and were converted.

<span id="iii.XXX-p31"></span>3. But none of these things shamed the
Pharisees, but they accuse Him to His disciples, saying,

<span id="iii.XXX-p32"></span>“Why eateth your Master with publicans and
sinners?” <span id="fr_1262"></span>[1263](#fn_1262.md)

<span id="iii.XXX-p34"></span>And when the disciples seem to be doing
wrong, they intercede with Him, saying, “Behold thy disciples do that
which is not lawful to do on the sabbath-day;” <span
id="fr_1263"></span>[1264](#fn_1263.md) but here to them they discredit
Him. All which was the part of men dealing craftily, and wishing to
separate from the Master the choir of the disciples. What then saith
Infinite Wisdom?

<span id="iii.XXX-p36"></span>“They that be whole need not a physician,”
saith He, “but they that are sick.” <span
id="fr_1264"></span>[1265](#fn_1264.md)

<span id="iii.XXX-p38"></span>See how He turned their reasoning to the
opposite conclusion. That is, while they made it a charge against Him
that He was in company with these men: He on the contrary saith, that
His not being with them would be unworthy of Him, and of His love of
man; and that to amend such persons is not only blameless, but
excellent, and necessary, and deserving of all sorts of praise.

<span id="iii.XXX-p39"></span>After this, that He might not seem to put
them that were bidden to shame, by saying, “they that are sick;” see how
He makes up for it again, by reproving the others, and saying,

<span id="iii.XXX-p40"></span>“Go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will
have mercy, and not sacrifice.” <span
id="fr_1265"></span>[1266](#fn_1265.md)

<span id="iii.XXX-p42"></span>Now this He said, to upbraid them with
their ignorance of the Scriptures. Wherefore also He orders His
discourse more sharply, not Himself in anger, far from it; but so as
that the publicans might not be in utter perplexity.

<span id="iii.XXX-p43"></span>And yet of course He might say, “Did ye
not mark, how I remitted the sins of the sick of the palsy, how I braced
up his body?” But He saith no such thing, but argues with them first
from men’s common reasonings, and then from the Scriptures. For having
said, “They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick;”
and having covertly indicated that He Himself was the Physician; after
that He said, “Go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and
not sacrifice.” Thus doth Paul also: when he had first established his
reasoning by illustrations from common things, and had said, “Who
feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk thereof?” <span
id="fr_1266"></span>[1267](#fn_1266.md) then he brings in the Scriptures
also, saying, “It is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle
the ox that treadeth out the corn;” <span
id="fr_1267"></span>[1268](#fn_1267.md) and again, “Even so hath the Lord
ordained, that they <span id="page_197">p. 197</span> <span
id="iii.XXX-Page_197"></span> which preach the gospel should live of the
gospel.” <span id="fr_1268"></span>[1269](#fn_1268.md)

<span id="iii.XXX-p47"></span>But to His disciples not so, but He puts
them in mind of His signs, saying on this wise, “Do ye not yet remember
the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took
up?” <span id="fr_1269"></span>[1270](#fn_1269.md) Not so however with
these, but He reminds them of our common infirmity, and signifies them
at any rate to be of the number of the infirm; who did not so much as
know the Scriptures, but making light of the rest of virtue, laid all
the stress on their sacrifices; which thing He is also earnestly
intimating unto them, when He sets down in brief what had been affirmed
by all the prophets, <span id="fr_1270"></span>[1271](#fn_1270.md) saying,
“Learn ye what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.”

<span id="iii.XXX-p50"></span>The fact is, He is signifying hereby that
not He was transgressing the law, but they; as if He had said,
“Wherefore accuse me? Because I bring sinners to amendment? Why then ye
must accuse the Father also for this.” Much as He said also elsewhere,
establishing this point: “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work:” <span
id="fr_1271"></span>[1272](#fn_1271.md) so here again, “Go ye and learn
what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.” “For as this
is His will, saith Christ, so also mine.” Seest thou how the one is
superfluous, the other necessary? For neither did He say, “I will have
mercy, and sacrifice,” but, “I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.” That
is, the one thing He allowed, the other He cast out; and proved that
what they blamed, so far from being forbidden, was even ordained by the
law, and more so than sacrifice; and He brings in the Old Testament,
speaking words and ordaining laws in harmony with Himself.

<span id="iii.XXX-p52"></span>Having then reproved them, both by common
illustrations and by the Scriptures, He adds again,

<span id="iii.XXX-p53"></span>“I am not come to call righteous men, but
sinners to repentance.” <span id="fr_1272"></span>[1273](#fn_1272.md)

<span id="iii.XXX-p55"></span>And this He saith unto them in irony; as
when He said, “Behold, Adam is become as one of us;” <span
id="fr_1273"></span>[1274](#fn_1273.md) and again, “If I were hungry, I
would not tell thee.” <span id="fr_1274"></span>[1275](#fn_1274.md) For
that no man on earth was righteous, Paul declared, saying, “For all have
sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” <span
id="fr_1275"></span>[1276](#fn_1275.md) And by this too the others were
comforted, I mean, the guests. “Why, I am so far,” saith He, “from
loathing sinners, that even for their sakes only am I come.” Then, lest
He should make them more careless, He staid not at the word “sinners,”
but added, “unto repentance.” “For I am not come that they should
continue sinners, but that they should alter, and amend.”

<span id="iii.XXX-p59"></span>4. He then having stopped their mouths
every way, as well from the Scriptures as from the natural consequence
of things; and they having nothing to say, proved as they were obnoxious
to the charges which they had brought against Him, and adversaries of
the law and the Old Testament; they leave Him, and again transfer their
accusation to the disciples.

<span id="iii.XXX-p60"></span>And Luke indeed affirms that the Pharisees
said it, but this evangelist, that it was the disciples of John; <span
id="fr_1276"></span>[1277](#fn_1276.md) but it is likely that both said it.
That is, they being, as might be expected, in utter perplexity, take the
other sort with them; as they did afterwards with the Herodians
likewise. Since in truth John’s disciples were always disposed to be
jealous of Him, and reasoned against Him: being then only humbled, when
first John abode in the prison. They came at least then, “and told
Jesus;” <span id="fr_1277"></span>[1278](#fn_1277.md) but afterwards they
returned to their former envy.

<span id="iii.XXX-p63"></span>Now what say they? “Why do we and the
Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?” <span
id="fr_1278"></span>[1279](#fn_1278.md)

<span id="iii.XXX-p65"></span>This is the disease, which Christ long
before was eradicating, in the words, “When thou fastest, anoint thy
head, and wash thy face;” <span id="fr_1279"></span>[1280](#fn_1279.md)
foreknowing the evils that spring therefrom. But yet He doth not rebuke
even these, nor say, “O ye vainglorious and over-busy;” but He
discourses to them with all gentleness, saying, “The children of the
bride-chamber cannot fast, as long as the bridegroom is with
them.” <span id="fr_1280"></span>[1281](#fn_1280.md) Thus, when others were
to be spoken for, the publicans I mean, to soothe their wounded soul, He
was more severe in His reproof of their revilers; but when they were
deriding Himself and His disciples, He makes His reply with all
gentleness.

<span id="iii.XXX-p68"></span>Now their meaning is like this; “Granted,”
say they, “Thou doest this as a physician; why do Thy disciples also
leave fasting, and cleave to such tables?” Then, to make the accusation
heavier, they put themselves first, and then the Pharisees; wishing by
the comparison to aggravate the charge. For indeed “both we,” it is
said, “and the Pharisees, fast oft.” And in truth they did fast, the one
having learnt it from John, the other <span id="page_198">p. 198</span>
<span id="iii.XXX-Page_198"></span> from the law; even as also the
Pharisee said, “I fast twice in the week.” <span
id="fr_1281"></span>[1282](#fn_1281.md)

<span id="iii.XXX-p70"></span>What then saith Jesus? “Can the children
of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them.” Before, He
called Himself a physician, but here a bridegroom; by these names
revealing His unspeakable mysteries. Yet of course He might have told
them, more sharply, “These things depend not on you, that you should
make such laws. For of what use is fasting, when the mind is full of
wickedness; when ye blame others, when ye condemn them, bearing about
beams in your eyes, and do all for display? Nay, before all this ye
ought to have cast out vainglory, to be proficients in all the other
duties, in charity, meekness, brotherly love.” However, nothing of this
kind doth He say, but with all gentleness, “The children of the
bridechamber cannot fast, so long as the bridegroom is with them;”
recalling to their mind John’s words, when he said, “He that hath the
bride, is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom, which
standeth and heareth Him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s
voice.” <span id="fr_1282"></span>[1283](#fn_1282.md)

<span id="iii.XXX-p72"></span>Now His meaning is like this: The present
time is of joy and gladness, therefore do not bring in the things which
are melancholy. For fasting is a melancholy thing, not in its own
nature, but to them that are yet in rather a feeble state; for to those
at least that are willing to practise self-command, the observance is
exceedingly pleasant and desirable. For as when the body is in health,
the spirits are high, <span id="fr_1283"></span>[1284](#fn_1283.md) so when
the soul is well conditioned, the pleasure is greater. But according to
their previous impression He saith this. So also Isaiah, <span
id="fr_1284"></span>[1285](#fn_1284.md) discoursing of it, calls it “an
affliction of the soul;” and Moses too in like manner.

<span id="iii.XXX-p75"></span>Not however by this only doth He stop
their mouths, but by another topic also, saying,

<span id="iii.XXX-p76"></span>“Days will come, when the bridegroom shall
be taken from them, and then shall they fast.” <span
id="fr_1285"></span>[1286](#fn_1285.md)

<span id="iii.XXX-p78"></span>For hereby He signifies, that what they
did was not of gluttony, but pertained to some marvellous dispensation.
And at the same time He lays beforehand the foundation of what He was to
say touching His passion, in His controversies with others instructing
His disciples, and training them now to be versed in the things which
are deemed sorrowful. Because for themselves already to have this said
to them, would have been grievous and galling, since we know that
afterwards, being uttered, it troubled them; <span
id="fr_1286"></span>[1287](#fn_1286.md) but spoken to others, it would
become rather less intolerable to them.

<span id="iii.XXX-p80"></span>It being also natural for them to pride
themselves on John’s calamity, He from this topic represses likewise
such their elation: the doctrine however of His resurrection He adds not
yet, it not being yet time. For so much indeed was natural, that one
supposed to be a man should die, but that other was beyond nature.

<span id="iii.XXX-p81"></span>5. Then what He had done before, this He
doth here again. I mean, that as He, when they were attempting to prove
Him blameable for eating with sinners, proved to them on the contrary,
that His proceeding was not only no blame, but an absolute praise to
Him: so here too, when they wanted to show of Him, that He knows not how
to manage His disciples, He signifies that such language was the part of
men not knowing how to manage their inferences, <span
id="fr_1287"></span>[1288](#fn_1287.md) but finding fault at random.

<span id="iii.XXX-p83"></span>“For no man,” saith He, “putteth a piece
of new cloth unto an old garment.” <span
id="fr_1288"></span>[1289](#fn_1288.md)

<span id="iii.XXX-p85"></span>He is again establishing His argument by
illustrations from common life. And what He saith is like this, “The
disciples have not yet become strong, but still need much condescension.
They have not yet been renewed by the Spirit, and on persons in that
state one ought not to lay any burden of injunctions.”

<span id="iii.XXX-p86"></span>And these things He said, setting laws and
rules for His own disciples, that when they should have to receive as
disciples those of all sorts that should come from the whole world, they
might deal with them very gently.

<span id="iii.XXX-p87"></span>“Neither do men put new wine into old
bottles.” <span id="fr_1289"></span>[1290](#fn_1289.md)

<span id="iii.XXX-p89"></span>Seest thou His illustrations, how like the
Old Testament? the garment? the wine skins? For Jeremiah too calls the
people “a girdle,” and makes mention again of “bottles” and of
“wine.” <span id="fr_1290"></span>[1291](#fn_1290.md) Thus, the discourse
being about gluttony and a table, He takes His illustrations from the
same.

<span id="iii.XXX-p91"></span>But Luke <span
id="fr_1291"></span>[1292](#fn_1291.md) the same words, a second and a
third time and often; not however in a wearisome kind of way, but sport
<span id="page_199">p. 199</span> <span id="iii.XXX-Page_199"></span>
ively, and do thou now turn from her, now flatter and court her.

<span id="iii.XXX-p93"></span>Seest thou not the painters, how much they
rub out, how much they insert, when they are making a beautiful
portrait? Well then, do not thou prove inferior to these. For if these,
in drawing the likeness of a body, used such great diligence, how much
more were it meet for us, in fashioning a soul, to use every
contrivance. For if thou shouldest fashion well the form of this soul,
thou wilt not see the countenance of the body looking unseemly, nor lips
stained, nor a mouth like a bear’s mouth dyed with blood, nor eyebrows
blackened as with the smut of some kitchen vessel, nor cheeks whitened
with dust like the walls of the tombs. For all these things are smut,
and cinders, and dust, and signals of extreme deformity.

<span id="iii.XXX-p94"></span>But stay: I have been led on unobserving,
I know not how, into these expressions; and while admonishing another to
teach with gentleness, I have been myself hurried away <span
id="fr_1292"></span>[1293](#fn_1292.md) into wrath. Let us return therefore
again unto the more gentle way of admonition, and let us bear with all
the faults of our wives, that we may succeed in doing what we would.
Seest thou not how we bear with the cries of children, when we would
wean them from the breast, how we endure all for this object only, that
we may persuade them to despise their former food? Thus let us do in
this case also, let us bear with all the rest, that we may accomplish
this. For when this hath been amended, thou wilt see the other too
proceeding in due order, and thou wilt come again unto the ornaments of
gold, and in the same way wilt reason concerning them likewise, and thus
by little and little bringing thy wife unto the right rule, thou wilt be
a beautiful painter, a faithful servant, an excellent husbandman.

<span id="iii.XXX-p96"></span>Together with these things remind her also
of the women of old, of Sarah, of Rebecca, both of the fair and of them
that were not so, and point out how all equally practised modesty. For
even Leah, the wife of the patriarch, not being fair, was not
constrained to devise any such thing, but although she were uncomely,
and not very much beloved by her husband, she neither devised any such
thing, nor marred her countenance, but continued to preserve the
lineaments thereof undisfigured, and this though brought up by
Gentiles. <span id="fr_1293"></span>[1294](#fn_1293.md)

<span id="iii.XXX-p98"></span>But thou that art a believing woman, thou
that hast Christ for thine head, art thou bringing in upon us a satanic
art? And dost thou not call to mind the water that dashed over thy
countenance, the sacrifice that adorns thy lips, the blood that hath
reddened thy tongue? For if thou wouldest consider all these things,
though thou wert fond of dress to the ten thousandth degree, thou wilt
not venture nor endure to put upon thee that dust and those cinders.
Learn that thou hast been joined unto Christ, and refrain from this
unseemliness. For neither is He delighted with these colorings, but He
seeks after another beauty, of which He is in an exceeding degree a
lover, I mean, that in the soul. This the prophet likewise hath charged
thee to cherish, and hath said, “So shall the King have pleasure in thy
beauty.” <span id="fr_1294"></span>[1295](#fn_1294.md)

<span id="iii.XXX-p100"></span>Let us not therefore be curious in making
ourselves unseemly. For neither is any one of God’s works imperfect, nor
doth it need to be set right by thee. For not even if to an image of the
emperor, after it was set up, any one were to seek to add his own work,
would the attempt be safe, but he will incur extreme danger. Well then,
man works and thou addest not; but doth God work, and dost thou amend
it? And dost thou not consider the fire of hell? Dost thou not consider
the destitution of thy soul? For on this account it is neglected,
because all thy care is wasted on the flesh.

<span id="iii.XXX-p101"></span>But why do I speak of the soul? For to
the very flesh everything falls out contrary to what ye have sought.
Consider it. Dost thou wish to appear beautiful? This shows thee
uncomely. Dost thou wish to please thy husband? This rather grieves him;
and causes not him only, but strangers also, to become thine accusers.
Wouldest thou appear young? This will quickly bring thee to old age.
Wouldest thou wish to array thyself honorably? This makes thee to be
ashamed. For such an one is ashamed not only before those of her own
rank, but even those of her maids who are in her secret, and those of
her servants who know; and, above all, before herself.

<span id="iii.XXX-p102"></span>But why need I say these things? For that
which is more grievous than all I have now omitted, namely, that thou
dost offend God; thou underminest modesty, kindlest the flame of
jealousy, emulatest the harlot women at their brothel.

<span id="iii.XXX-p103"></span>All these things then consider, ye women,
and laugh to scorn the pomp of Satan and the craft of the devil; and
letting go this adorning, or rather disfiguring, cultivate that beauty
in your own souls which is lovely even to angels and desired of God, and
delightful <span id="page_200">p. 200</span> <span
id="iii.XXX-Page_200"></span> to your husbands; that ye may attain both
unto present glory, and unto that which is to come. To which God grant
that we may all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord
Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might forever and ever. Amen.
