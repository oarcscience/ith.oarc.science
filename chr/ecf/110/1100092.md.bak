<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iii.LXXXIV-p1.1"></span>Homily LXXXVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.LXXXIV-p2.1"></span>[Matt. XXVII.
45-48](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#045.md)<span
id="iii.LXXXIV-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p3"></span>*“Now from the sixth hour there was
darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. And about the ninth
hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, and said, Eli, Eli, lama
sabachthani? that is to say, my God my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
Some of them that stood there, when they heard that said, this man
calleth for Elias. And straight way one of them ran, and took a sponge,
and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave Him to
drink.”* <span id="fr_3103"></span>[3104](#fn_3103.md)

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p5"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.LXXXIV-p5.1"></span>This</span> is the sign which before He had
promised to give them when they asked it, saying, “An evil and
adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, and there shall no sign be
given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas;” <span
id="fr_3104"></span>[3105](#fn_3104.md) meaning His cross, and His death,
His burial, and His resurrection. And again, declaring in another way
the virtue of the cross, He said, “When ye have lifted up the Son of
Man, then shall ye know that I am He.” <span
id="fr_3105"></span>[3106](#fn_3105.md) And what He saith is to this
purport: “When ye have crucified me, and think ye have overcome me,
then, above all, shall ye know my might.”

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p8"></span>For after the crucifixion, the city was
destroyed, and the Jewish state came to an end, they fell away from
their polity and their freedom, the gospel flourished, the word was
spread abroad to the ends of the world; both sea and land, both the
inhabited earth and the desert perpetually proclaim its <span
id="fr_3106"></span>[3107](#fn_3106.md) power. These things then He
meaneth, and those which took place at the very time of the crucifixion.
For indeed it was much more marvellous that these things should be done,
when He was nailed to the cross, than when He was walking on earth. And
not in this respect only was the wonder, but because from heaven also
was that done which they had sought, and it was over all the world,
which had never before happened, but in Egypt only, when the passover
was to be fulfilled. For indeed those events were a type of these.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p10"></span>And observe when it took place. At
midday, that all that dwell on the earth may know it, when it was day
all over the world; which was enough to convert them, not by the
greatness of the miracle only, but also by its taking place in due
season. For after all their insulting, and their lawless derision, this
is done, when they had let go their anger, when they had ceased mocking,
when they were satiated with their jeerings, and had spoken all that
they were minded; then He shows the darkness, in order that at least so
(having vented their anger) they may profit by the miracle. For this was
more marvellous than to come down from the cross, that being on the
cross He should work these things. For whether they thought He Himself
had done it, they ought to have believed and to have feared; or whether
not He, but the Father, yet thereby ought they to have been moved to
compunction, for that darkness was a token of His anger at their crime.
For that it was not an eclipse, but both wrath and indignation, is not
hence alone manifest, but also by the time, for it continued three
hours, but an eclipse takes place in one moment of time, and they know
it, who have seen this; and indeed it hath taken place even in our
generation.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p11"></span>And how, you may say, did not all
marvel, and account Him to be God? Because the race of man was then held
in a state of great carelessness and vice. And this miracle was but one,
and when it had taken place, immediately passed away; and no one was
concerned to inquire into the cause of it, and great was the prejudice
and the habit of ungodliness. And they knew not what was the cause of
that which took place, and they thought perhaps this happened so, in the
way of an eclipse or some natural effect. And why dost thou marvel about
them that are without, that knew nothing, neither inquired by reason of
great indifference, when even those that were in Judæa itself, after so
many miracles, yet continued using Him despitefully, although He plainly
showed them that He Himself wrought this thing.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p12"></span>And for this reason, even after this He
speaks, that they might learn that He was <span id="page_502">p.
502</span> <span id="iii.LXXXIV-Page_502"></span> still alive, and that
He Himself did this, and that they might become by this also more
gentle, and He saith, “*Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani*?” <span
id="fr_3107"></span>[3108](#fn_3107.md) that unto His last breath they
might see that He honors His Father, and is no adversary of God.
Wherefore also He uttered a certain cry from the prophet, <span
id="fr_3108"></span>[3109](#fn_3108.md) even to His last hour bearing
witness to the Old Testament, and not simply a cry from the prophet, but
also in Hebrew, so as to be plain and intelligible to them, and by all
things He shows how He is of one mind with Him that begat Him.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p15"></span>But mark herein also their wantonness,
and intemperance, and folly. They thought (it is said) that it was Elias
whom He called, and straightway they gave Him vinegar to drink. <span
id="fr_3109"></span>[3110](#fn_3109.md) But another came unto Him, and
“pierced His side with a spear.” <span
id="fr_3110"></span>[3111](#fn_3110.md) What could be more lawless, what
more brutal, than these men; who carried their madness to so great a
length, offering insult at last even to a dead body?

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p18"></span>But mark thou, I pray thee, how He made
use of their wickednesses for our salvation. For after the blow the
fountains of our salvation gushed forth from thence.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p19"></span>“And Jesus, when He had cried with a
loud voice, yielded up the Ghost.” <span
id="fr_3111"></span>[3112](#fn_3111.md) This is what He said, “I have power
to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again,” and, “I lay it
down of myself.” <span id="fr_3112"></span>[3113](#fn_3112.md) So for this
cause He cried with the voice, that it might be shown that the act is
done by power. Mark at any rate saith, that “Pilate marvelled if He were
already dead:” <span id="fr_3113"></span>[3114](#fn_3113.md) and that the
centurion for this cause above all believed, because He died with
power. <span id="fr_3114"></span>[3115](#fn_3114.md)

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p24"></span>This cry rent the veil, and opened the
tombs, and made the house desolate. And He did this, not as offering
insult to the temple (for how should He, who saith, “Make not my
Father’s house a house of merchandise”), <span
id="fr_3115"></span>[3116](#fn_3115.md) but declaring them to be unworthy
even of His abiding there; like as also when He delivered it over to the
Babylonians. But not for this only were these things done, but what took
place was a prophecy of the coming desolation, and of the change into
the greater and higher state; and *a sign* of His might.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p26"></span>And together with these things He
showed Himself also by what followed after these things, by the raising
of the dead. For in the instance of Elisha; <span
id="fr_3116"></span>[3117](#fn_3116.md) one on touching a dead body rose
again, but now by a voice He raised them, His body continuing up there,
on the cross. And besides, those things were a type of this. For that
this might be believed, therefore is that all done. And they are not
merely raised, but also rocks are rent, and the earth shaken, that they
might learn, that He was able to strike themselves blind, and to rend
them in pieces. For He that cleft rocks asunder, and darkened the world,
much more could have done these things to them, had it been His will.
But He would not, but having discharged His wrath upon the elements,
them it was His will to save by clemency. But they abated not their
madness. Such is envy, such is jealousy, it is not easily stayed. At
that time then they were impudent in setting themselves against the
actual appearances; and afterwards *even against the things
themselves*, <span id="fr_3117"></span>[3118](#fn_3117.md) when a seal
being put upon Him, and soldiers watching Him, He rose again, and they
heard these things from the very guards; they even gave money, in order
both to corrupt others, and to steal away the history of the
resurrection.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p29"></span>Marvel not therefore if at this time
also they were perverse, being thus altogether prepared to set
themselves impudently against all things; but observe this other point,
how great signs He had wrought, some from Heaven, some on earth, some in
the very temple, at once marking His indignation, and at the same time
showing that what were unapproachable are now to be entered, and that
Heaven shall be opened; and the work removed to the true Holy of Holies.
And they indeed said, “If He be the King of Israel, let Him come down
now from the cross,” <span id="fr_3118"></span>[3119](#fn_3118.md) but He
shows that He is King of all the world. And whereas those men said,
“Thou that destroyest this temple, and buildest it in three days,” <span
id="fr_3119"></span>[3120](#fn_3119.md) He shows that it shall be made
forever desolate. Again they said, “He saved others, Himself He cannot
save,” <span id="fr_3120"></span>[3121](#fn_3120.md) but He while abiding
on the cross proved this most abundantly on the bodies of His servants.
For if for Lazarus to rise on the fourth day was a great thing, how much
more for all those who had long ago fallen asleep, at once to appear
alive, which was a sign of the future resurrection. For, “many bodies of
the saints which slept, arose,” it is said, “and went into the holy
city, and appeared to many.” <span id="fr_3121"></span>[3122](#fn_3121.md)
For in order that what was done might not be accounted to be an
imagination, <span id="page_503">p. 503</span> <span
id="iii.LXXXIV-Page_503"></span> they appear, even to many, in the city.
And the Centurion too then glorified God, saying, “Truly this was a
righteous man. And the multitudes that came together to that sight,
returned beating their breasts.” <span
id="fr_3122"></span>[3123](#fn_3122.md) So great was the power of the
crucified, that after so many mockings, and scoffs, and jeers, both the
centurion was moved to compunction, and the people. And some say that
there is also a martyrdom of this centurion, who after these things grew
to manhood in the faith.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p35"></span>“And many women were there beholding
afar off, which had followed Him, ministering unto Him, Mary Magdalene,
and Mary the mother of James, and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s
sons.” <span id="fr_3123"></span>[3124](#fn_3123.md)

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p37"></span>These things the women see done, these
who were most inclined to feel for Him, who were most of all bewailing
Him. And mark how great their assiduity. They had followed Him
ministering to Him, and were present even unto the time of the dangers.
Wherefore also they saw all; how He cried, how He gave up the ghost, how
the rocks were rent, and all the rest.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p38"></span>And these first see Jesus; and the sex
that was most condemned, this first enjoys the sight of the blessings,
this most shows its courage. And when the disciples had fled, these were
present. But who were these? His mother, for she is called mother of
James, <span id="fr_3124"></span>[3125](#fn_3124.md) and the rest. But
another evangelist <span id="fr_3125"></span>[3126](#fn_3125.md) saith,
that many also lamented over the things that were done, and smote their
breasts, which above all shows the cruelty of the Jews, for that they
gloried in things for which others were lamenting, and were neither
moved by pity, nor checked by fear. For indeed the things that were done
were of great wrath, and were not merely signs, but signs of anger all
of them, the darkness, the cloven rocks, the veil rent in the midst, the
shaking of the earth, and great was the excess of the indignation.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p41"></span>“But Joseph went, and begged the
body.” <span id="fr_3126"></span>[3127](#fn_3126.md) This was Joseph, who
was concealing his discipleship of late; now however he had become very
bold after the death of Christ. For neither was he an obscure person,
nor of the unnoticed; but one of the council, and highly distinguished;
from which circumstance especially one may see his courage. For he
exposed himself to death, taking upon him enmity with all, by his
affection to Jesus, both having dared to beg the body, and not having
desisted until he obtained it. But not by taking it only, nor by burying
it in a costly manner, but also by laying it in his own new tomb, he
showeth his love, and his courage. And this was not so ordered without
purpose, but so there should not be any bare suspicion, that one had
risen instead of another.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p43"></span>“And there was Mary Magdalene, and the
other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.” <span
id="fr_3127"></span>[3128](#fn_3127.md) For what purpose do these wait by
it? As yet they knew nothing great, as was meet, and high about Him,
wherefore also they had brought ointments, and were waiting at the tomb,
so that if the madness of the Jews should relax, they might go and
embrace the body. Seest thou women’s courage? seest thou their
affection? seest thou their noble spirit in money? their noble spirit
even unto death?

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p45"></span>Let us men imitate the women; let us
not forsake Jesus in temptations. For they for Him even dead spent so
much and exposed their lives, but we (for again I say the same things)
neither feed Him when hungry, nor clothe Him when naked, but seeing Him
begging, we pass Him by. And yet if ye saw Himself, every one would
strip himself of all his goods. But even now it is the same. For He
Himself has said, I am he. Wherefore then dost thou not strip thyself of
all? For indeed even now thou hearest Him say, Thou doest it unto me;
and there is no difference whether thou givest to this man or to Him;
thou hast nothing less than these women that then fed Him, but even much
more. But be not perplexed! For it is not so much to have fed Him
appearing in His own person, which would be enough to prevail with a
heart of stone, as (because of His mere word) to wait upon the poor, the
maimed, him that is bent down. For in the former case, the look and the
dignity of Him who appears divides with thee that which is done; but
here the reward is entire for thy benevolence; and there is the proof of
the greater reverence towards Him, when at His mere word waiting upon
thy fellow-servant thou refreshest him in all things. Refresh him, and
believe Him, who receiveth it, and saith, Thou givest to me. For unless
thou hadst given to Him, He would not have counted thee worthy of a
kingdom. If thou <span id="page_504">p. 504</span> <span
id="iii.LXXXIV-Page_504"></span> hadst not turned away from Him, He
would not have sent thee to hell, if thou hadst overlooked a chance
person; but because it is He Himself that is despised, therefore great
is the blame.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p46"></span>Thus also Paul persecuted Him, in
persecuting them that are His; wherefore too He said, “Why persecutest
thou me?” <span id="fr_3128"></span>[3129](#fn_3128.md) Thus therefore let
us feel, as bestowing on Christ Himself when we bestow. For indeed His
words are more sure than our sight. When therefore thou seest a poor
man, remember His words, by which He declared, that it is He Himself who
is fed. For though that which appears be not Christ, yet in this man’s
form Christ Himself receiveth and beggeth.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p48"></span>But art thou ashamed to hear that
Christ beggeth? Rather be ashamed when thou dost not give to Him begging
of thee. For this is shame, this is vengeance and punishment. Since for
Him to beg is of His goodness, wherefore we ought even to glory therein;
but for thee not to give, is of thy inhumanity. But if thou believe not
now, that in passing by a poor man that is a believer, thou passest by
Him, thou wilt believe it then, when He will bring thee into the midst
and say, “Inasmuch as ye did it not to these, ye did it not to
me.” <span id="fr_3129"></span>[3130](#fn_3129.md) But God forbid that we
should so learn it, and grant rather that we may believe now, and bring
forth fruit, and hear that most blessed voice that bringeth us into the
kingdom.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p50"></span>But perhaps some one will say, “Thou
art every day discoursing to us of almsgiving and humanity.” Neither
will I cease to speak of this. For if ye had attained to it, in the
first place, not even so ought I to desist, for fear of making you the
more remiss; yet had ye attained, I might have relaxed a little; but if
ye have not arrived even at the half; say not these things to me, but to
yourselves. For indeed thou doest the same in blaming me, as if a little
child, hearing often of the letter alpha, and not learning it, were to
blame its teacher, because he is continually and for ever reminding him
about it.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p51"></span>For who from these discourses has
become more forward in the giving of alms? Who has cast down his money?
Who has given the half of his substance? Who the third part? No one. How
then should it be other than absurd, when ye do not learn, to require us
to desist from teaching? Ye ought to do the contrary. Though we were
minded to desist, ye ought to stop us and to say, we have not yet learnt
these things, and how is it ye have desisted from reminding us of them?
If it befell any one to suffer from his eye, and I happened to be a
physician, and then having covered it up and anointed it, and having
applied other treatment, I had not benefited it much, and so had
desisted; would he not have come to the doors of my surgery and cried
out against me, accusing me of great remissness, for that I had of
myself withdrawn, while the disease remained; and if, on being blamed, I
had said in reply to these things, that I had covered it up, and
anointed it; would he have endured it? By no means, but would
immediately have said; “And what is the advantage, if I still suffer
pain.” Reason thus also with respect to thy soul. But what if after
having often fomented a hand that was lifeless and shrunk, I had not
succeeded in mollifying it? Should I not have heard the same thing? And
even now a hand that is shrunk and withered we bathe, and for this
reason, until we can stretch it out perfectly, we will not desist. Would
that you too were to discourse of nothing else, at home and at market,
at table and at night, and as a dream. For if we were always careful
about these things by day, even in our dreams we should be engaged in
them.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p52"></span>What sayest thou? Am I forever speaking
of almsgiving? I would wish myself that there were not great need for me
to address this advice to you, but that I were to speak of the battle
against the Jews, and heathens, and heretics; but when ye are not yet
sound, how can any one arm you for the fight? How should he lead you to
the array, yet having wounds and gashes. Since if indeed I saw you
thoroughly sound in health, I should lead you forth to that battle
array, and ye would see by the grace of Christ ten thousands lying dead,
and their heads cast one upon another. In other books at any rate, many
discourses have been spoken by us touching these things, but not even so
are we able thoroughly to triumph in the victory, because of the
remissness of the multitude. For when we conquer them ten thousand times
over in doctrines, they reproach us with the lives of the multitude of
those who join our congregations, their wounds, their diseases in their
soul.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p53"></span>How then shall we with confidence show
you in the battle array, when ye rather do us mischief, being
straightway wounded by our enemies, and made a mock of? For one man’s
hand is diseased, and shrunk so as not to be able to give away. How then
should such a one hold a shield, and thrust it before him, and avoid
being wounded by the jeers of cruelty. With others the feet halt, as
<span id="page_505">p. 505</span> <span id="iii.LXXXIV-Page_505"></span>
many as go up to the theatres, and to the resorts of the harlot women.
How shall these then be able to stand in the battle, and not to be
wounded with the accusation of wantonness? Another suffers and is maimed
in his eyes, not looking straight, but being full of lasciviousness, and
assailing women’s chastity, and overthrowing marriages. How then should
this man be able to look in the face of the enemy, and brandish a spear,
and throw his dart, being goaded on all sides with jeers. We may see
also many suffering with the belly not less than the dropsical, when
they are held in subjection by gluttony and drunkenness. How then shall
I be able to lead forth these drunken men to war? With others the mouth
is rotten; such are the passionate, and revilers, and blasphemers. How
then shall this man ever shout in battle, and achieve anything great and
noble, he too being drunk with another drunkenness, and affording much
laughter to the enemy?

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p54"></span>Therefore each day I go about this
camp, dressing your wounds, healing your sores. But if ye ever rouse
yourselves up, and become fit even to wound others, I will both teach
you this art of war, and instruct you how to handle these weapons, or
rather your works themselves will be weapons to you, and all men will
immediately submit, if ye would become merciful, if forbearing, if mild
and patient, if ye would show forth all other virtue. But if any
gainsay, then we will also add the proof of what we can show on our
part, <span id="fr_3130"></span>[3131](#fn_3130.md) bringing you forward,
since now we rather are hindered (at least as to your part) in this
race.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p56"></span>And mark. We say that Christ hath done
great things, having made angels of men; then, when we are called upon
to give account, and required to furnish a proof out of this flock, our
mouths are stopped. For I am afraid, lest in the place of angels, I
bring forth swine as from a style, and horses mad with lust.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p57"></span>I know ye are pained, but not against
you all are these things spoken, but against the guilty, or rather not
even against them if they awake, but for them. Since now indeed all is
lost and ruined, and the church is become nothing better than a stable
of oxen, and a fold for asses and camels, and I go round seeking for a
sheep, and am not able to see it. So much are all kicking, like horses,
and any wild asses, and they fill the place here with much dung, for
like this is their discourse. And if indeed one could see the things
spoken at each assemblage, <span id="fr_3131"></span>[3132](#fn_3131.md) by
men, by women, thou wouldest see their words more unclean than that
dung.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p59"></span>Wherefore I entreat you to change this
evil custom, that the church may smell of ointment. But now, while we
lay up in it perfumes for the senses, the uncleanness of the mind we use
no great diligence to purge out, and drive away. What then is the
advantage? For we do not so much disgrace the church by bringing dung
into it, as we disgrace it by speaking such things one to another, about
gains, about merchandise, about petty tradings, about things that are
nothing to us, when there ought to be choirs of angels here, and we
ought to make the church a heaven, and to know nothing else but earnest
prayers, and silence with listening.

<span id="iii.LXXXIV-p60"></span>This then let us do at any rate, from
the present time, that we may both purify our lives, and attain unto the
promised blessings, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to whom be glory world without end. Amen.

perpetual virginity; “how then, you will say, are James and others
called His brethren? In the same way as Joseph himself too was
considered the Husband of Mary.” This is at least consistent with the
explanation given in the spurious Homilies “on the Annunciation,” Ben.
t. ii. p. 797. And “on the women bearing spices” t. ii. p. 159,
Appendix, that she was the *step-mother* of James. Theodoret, on [Gal.
