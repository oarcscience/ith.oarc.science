<span id="iii.XXIV-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iii.XXIV-p1.1"></span>Homily XXIV.</span>

<span id="iii.XXIV-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.XXIV-p2.1"></span>[Matt. VII.
21](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.XXIV-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="iii.XXIV-p3"></span>“Not every one that saith unto me, Lord,
Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven, but he that doeth the will
of my Father which is in Heaven.”

<span id="iii.XXIV-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.XXIV-p4.1"></span>Wherefore</span> said He not, “but he that
doeth my will?” Because for the time it was a great gain <span
id="fr_1042"></span>[1043](#fn_1042.md) for them to receive even this
first; yea it was very great, considering their weakness. And moreover
He intimated the one also by the other. And withal this may be
mentioned, that in fact there is no other will of the Son besides that
of the Father.

<span id="iii.XXIV-p6"></span>And here He seems to me to be censuring
the Jews chiefly, laying as they did the whole stress upon the
doctrines, and taking no care of practice. For which Paul also blames
them, saying, “Behold thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and
makest thy boast of God, and knowest His will:” <span
id="fr_1043"></span>[1044](#fn_1043.md) “Who then are these men?” you ask.
Many of them that believed received gifts such as he that was casting
out devils, <span id="fr_1044"></span>[1045](#fn_1044.md) and was not with
Him; such as Judas; for even he too, wicked as he was, had a gift. And
in the Old Testament also this may be found, in that grace hath
oftentimes wrought upon unworthy persons, that it might do good to
others. That is, since all men were not meet for all things, but some
were of a pure life, not having so great faith, and others just the
contrary; by these sayings, while He urges the one to show forth much
faith, the others too He was summoning by this His unspeakable gift to
become better men. Wherefore also with great abundance did He bestow
that grace. For “we wrought,” it is said, “many mighty works.” But “then
will I profess unto them, I knew you not.” For “now indeed they suppose
they are my friends; but then shall they know, that not as to friends
did I give to them.”

<span id="iii.XXIV-p9"></span>And why marvel if He hath bestowed gifts
on men that have believed on Him, though without life suitable to their
faith, when even on those who have fallen from both these, He is
unquestionably found working? For so Balaam was an alien both from faith
and from a truly good life; nevertheless grace wrought on him for the
service <span id="fr_1045"></span>[1046](#fn_1045.md) of other men. And
Pharaoh too was of the same sort: yet for all that even to him He
signified the things to come. And Nebuchadnezzar was very full of
iniquity; yet to him again He revealed what was to follow after many
generations. <span id="fr_1046"></span>[1047](#fn_1046.md) And again to the
son of this last, though surpassing his father in iniquity, He signified
the things to come, ordering a marvellous and great dispensation. <span
id="fr_1047"></span>[1048](#fn_1047.md) Accordingly because then also the
beginnings of the gospel were taking place, and it was requisite that
the manifestation of its power should be abundant, many even of the
unworthy used to receive gifts. Howbeit, from those miracles no gain
accrued to them; rather they are the more punished. Wherefore unto them
did He utter even that fearful saying, “I never knew you:” there being
many for whom His hatred begins already even here; whom He turns away
from, even before the judgment.

<span id="iii.XXIV-p13"></span>Let us fear therefore, beloved; and let
us take great heed to our life, neither let us account ourselves worse
off, in that we do not work miracles now. For that will never be any
advantage to us, as neither any disadvantage in our not working them, if
we take heed to all virtue. Because for the miracles we ourselves are
debtors, but for our life and our doings we have God our debtor.

<span id="iii.XXIV-p14"></span>3. Having now, you see, finished all,
having discoursed accurately of all virtue, and pointed out the
pretenders to it, of divers kinds, both such as for display fast and
make prayers, and such as come in the sheep’s hide; and them too that
spoil it, whom He also called swine and dogs: He proceeds to signify how
great is the profit of virtue even here, and how great the mischief of
wickedness, by saying,

<span id="iii.XXIV-p15"></span>“Whosoever therefore heareth these
sayings of mine, and doeth them, shall be likened unto a wise
man.” <span id="fr_1048"></span>[1049](#fn_1048.md)

<span id="iii.XXIV-p17"></span>As thus: What they shall suffer who do
not (although they work miracles), ye have heard; but ye should know
also what such as obey all these sayings shall enjoy; not in the world
to come only, but even here. “For whosoever,” saith He, “heareth these
sayings of mine, and doeth them, shall be likened to a wise man.”

<span id="iii.XXIV-p18"></span>Seest thou how He varies His discourse;
at one time saying, “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord,” and
revealing Himself; at another time, “He that doeth the will of my
Father;” and again, bringing in Himself as judge, “For many will say to
me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and I
will say, I know you not.” And here again He indicates Himself to have
the power over all, this being why He said, “Whosoever heareth these
sayings of mine.”

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span> <span id="iii.XXIV-Page_165"></span>

<span id="iii.XXIV-p19"></span>Thus whereas all His discourse had been
touching the future; of a kingdom, and an unspeakable reward and
consolation, and the like; His will is, out of things here also to give
them their fruits, and to signify how great is the strength of virtue
even in the present life. What then is this her strength? To live in
safety, to be easily subdued by no terror, to stand superior to all that
despitefully use us. To this what can be equal? For this, not even he
that wears the diadem can provide for himself, but that man who follows
after virtue. For he alone is possessed of it in full abundance: in the
ebb and flow <span id="fr_1049"></span>[1050](#fn_1049.md) of the things
present he enjoys a great calm. The truly marvellous thing being this,
that not in fair weather, but when the storm is vehement, and the
turmoil great, and the temptations continual, he cannot be shaken ever
so little.

<span id="iii.XXIV-p21"></span>“For the rain descended,” saith He, “the
floods came, the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not:
for it was founded upon the rock.” <span
id="fr_1050"></span>[1051](#fn_1050.md)

<span id="iii.XXIV-p23"></span>By “rain” here, and “floods,” and
“winds,” He is expressing metaphorically the calamities and afflictions
that befall men; such as false accusations, plots, bereavements, deaths,
loss of friends, vexations from strangers, all the ills in our life that
any one could mention. “But to none of these,” saith He, “doth such a
soul give way; and the cause is, it is founded on the rock.” He calls
the stedfastness of His doctrine a rock; because in truth His commands
are stronger than any rock, setting one above all the waves of human
affairs. For he who keeps these things strictly, will not have the
advantage of men only when they are vexing him, but even of the very
devils plotting against him. And that it is not vain boasting so to
speak, Job is our witness, who received all the assaults of the devil,
and stood unmoveable; and the apostles too are our witnesses, for that
when the waves of the whole world were beating against them, when both
nations and princes, both their own people and strangers, both the evil
spirits, and the devil, and every engine was set in motion, they stood
firmer than a rock, and dispersed it all.

<span id="iii.XXIV-p24"></span>And now, what can be happier than this
kind of life? For this, not wealth, not strength of body, not glory, not
power, nor ought else will be able to secure, but only the possession of
virtue. For there is not, nay there is not another life we may find free
from all evils, but this alone. And ye are witnesses, who know the plots
in king’s courts, the turmoils and the troubles in the houses of the
rich. But there was not among the apostles any such thing.

<span id="iii.XXIV-p25"></span>What then? Did no such thing befall them?
Did they suffer no evil at any man’s hand? Nay, the marvel is this above
all things, that they were indeed the object of many plots, and many
storms burst upon them, but their soul was not overset by them, nor
thrown into despair, but with naked bodies they wrestled, prevailed, and
triumphed.

<span id="iii.XXIV-p26"></span>Thou then likewise, if thou be willing to
perform these things exactly, shall laugh all ills to scorn. Yea, for if
thou be but strengthened with such philosophy as is in these
admonitions, nothing shall be able to hurt thee. Since in what is he to
harm thee, who is minded to lay plots? Will he take away thy money?
Well, but before their threatening thou wast commanded to despise it,
and to abstain from it so exceedingly, as not so much as even to ask any
such thing of thy Lord. But doth he cast thee into prison? Why, before
thy prison, thou wast enjoined so to live, as to be crucified even to
all the world. But doth he speak evil? Nay, from this pain also Christ
hath delivered thee, by promising thee without toil a great reward for
the endurance of evil, and making thee so clear from the anger and
vexation hence arising, as even to command thee to pray for them. But
doth he banish thee and involve thee in innumerable ills? Well, he is
making the crown more glorious for thee. But doth he destroy and murder
thee? Even hereby he profits thee very greatly, procuring for thee the
rewards of the martyrs, and conducting thee more quickly into the
untroubled haven, and affording thee matter for a more abundant
recompence, and contriving for thee to make a gain of the universal
penalty. <span id="fr_1051"></span>[1052](#fn_1051.md) Which thing indeed
is most marvellous of all, that the plotters, so far from injuring at
all, do rather make the objects of their despite more approved. To this
what can be comparable? I mean, to the choice of such a mode of life as
this, and no other, is.

<span id="iii.XXIV-p28"></span>Thus whereas He had called the way strait
and narrow; to soothe our labors on this side also, He signifies the
security thereof to be great, and great the pleasure; even as of the
opposite course great is the unsoundness, and <span id="page_166">p.
166</span> <span id="iii.XXIV-Page_166"></span> the detriment. For as
virtue even from things here was signified by Him to have her rewards,
so vice also her penalties. For what I am ever saying, that I will say
now also: that in both ways He is everywhere bringing about the
salvation of His hearers on the one hand by zeal for virtue, on the
other by hatred of vice. Thus, because there would be some to admire
what He said, while they yield no proof of it by their works, He by
anticipation awakens their fears, saying, Though the things spoken be
good, hearing is not sufficient for security, but there is need also of
obedience in actions, and the whole lies chiefly in this. And here He
ends His discourse, leaving the fear at its height in them.

<span id="iii.XXIV-p29"></span>For as with regard to virtue, not only
from the things to come did He urge them (speaking of a kingdom, and of
Heaven, and an unspeakable reward, and comfort, and the unnumbered good
things): but also from the things present, indicating the firm and
immoveable quality of the Rock; so also with respect to wickedness, not
from the expected things only doth He excite their fears (as from the
tree that is cut down, and the unquenchable fire, and the not entering
into the kingdom, and from His saying, “I know you not”): but also from
the things present, the downfall, I mean, in what is said of the house.

<span id="iii.XXIV-p30"></span>4. Wherefore also He made His argument
more expressive, by trying its force <span
id="fr_1052"></span>[1053](#fn_1052.md) in a parable; for it was not the
same thing to say, “The virtuous man shall be impregnable, but the
wicked easily subdued,” as to suppose a rock, and a house, and rivers,
and rain, and wind, and the like.

<span id="iii.XXIV-p32"></span>“And every one,” saith He, “that heareth
these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish
man, which built his house upon the sand.” <span
id="fr_1053"></span>[1054](#fn_1053.md)

<span id="iii.XXIV-p34"></span>And well did He call this man “foolish”:
for what can be more senseless than one building a house on the sand,
and while he submits to the labor, depriving himself of the fruit and
refreshment, and instead thereof undergoing punishment? For that they
too, who follow after wickedness, do labor, is surely manifest to every
one: since both the extortioner, and the adulterer, and the false
accuser, toil and weary themselves much to bring their wickedness to
effect; but so far from reaping any profit from these their labors, they
rather undergo great loss. For Paul too intimated this when he said, “He
that soweth to his flesh, shall of his flesh reap corruption.” <span
id="fr_1054"></span>[1055](#fn_1054.md) To this man are they like also, who
build on the sand; as those that are given up to fornication, to
wantonness, to drunkenness, to anger, to all the other things.

<span id="iii.XXIV-p36"></span>Such an one was Ahab, but not such Elijah
(since when we have put virtue and vice along side of one another, we
shall know more accurately the difference): for the one had built upon
the rock, the other on the sand; wherefore though he were a king, he
feared and trembled at the prophet, at him that had only his sheepskin.
Such were the Jews but not the apostles; and so though they were few and
in bonds, they exhibited the steadfastness of the rock; but those, many
as they were, and in armor, the weakness of the sand. For so they said,
“What shall we do to these men?” <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[1056](#fn_1055.md) Seest thou those in perplexity, not
who are in the hands of others, and bound, but who are active in holding
down and binding? And what can be more strange than this? Hast thou hold
of the other, and art yet in utter perplexity? Yes, and very naturally.
For inasmuch as they had built all on the sand, therefore also were they
weaker than all. For this cause also they said again, “What do ye,
seeking to bring this man’s blood upon us?” <span
id="fr_1056"></span>[1057](#fn_1056.md) What saith he? Dost thou scourge,
and art thou in fear? entreatest thou despitefully, and art in dismay?
Dost thou judge, and yet tremble? So feeble is wickedness.

<span id="iii.XXIV-p39"></span>But the Apostles not so, but how? “We
cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.” <span
id="fr_1057"></span>[1058](#fn_1057.md) Seest thou a noble spirit? seest
thou a rock laughing waves to scorn? seest thou a house unshaken? And
what is yet more marvellous; so far from turning cowards themselves at
the plots formed against them, they even took more courage, and cast the
others into greater anxiety. For so he that smites adamant, is himself
the one smitten; and he that kicks against the pricks, is himself the
one pricked, the one on whom the severe wounds fall: and he who is
forming plots against the virtuous, is himself the one in jeopardy. For
wickedness becomes so much the weaker, the more it sets itself in array
against virtue. And as he who wraps up fire in a garment, extinguishes
not the flame, but consumes the garment; so he that is doing despite to
virtuous men, and oppressing them, and binding them, makes them more
glorious, but destroys himself. <span
id="fr_1058"></span>[1059](#fn_1058.md) For the more ills thou sufferest,
living righteously, the stronger art thou become; since the more we
honor self-restraint, the less we need anything; and the <span
id="page_167">p. 167</span> <span id="iii.XXIV-Page_167"></span> less we
need anything, the stronger we grow, and the more above all. Such a one
was John; wherefore him no man pained, but he caused pain to Herod; so
he that had nothing prevailed against him that ruled; and he that wore a
diadem, and purple, and endless pomp, trembles, and is in fear of him
that is stripped of all, and not even when beheaded could he without
fear see his head. For that even after his death he had the terror of
him in full strength, hear what He saith, “This is John, whom I
slew.” <span id="fr_1059"></span>[1060](#fn_1059.md) Now the expression, “I
slew,” is that of one not exulting, but soothing his own terror, and
persuading his troubled soul to call to mind, that he himself slew him.
So great is the force of virtue, that even after death it is more
powerful than the living. For this same cause again, when he was living,
they that possessed much wealth came unto him, and said, “What shall we
do?” <span id="fr_1060"></span>[1061](#fn_1060.md) Is so much yours, and
are ye minded to learn the way of your prosperity from him that hath
nothing? the rich from the poor? the soldiers from him that hath not
even a house?

<span id="iii.XXIV-p44"></span>Such an one was Elias too: wherefore also
with the same freedom did he discourse to the people. For as the former
said, “Ye generation of vipers;” <span
id="fr_1061"></span>[1062](#fn_1061.md) so this latter, “How long will ye
halt upon both your hips?” <span id="fr_1062"></span>[1063](#fn_1062.md)
And the one said, “Hast thou killed, and inherited?” <span
id="fr_1063"></span>[1064](#fn_1063.md) the other, “It is not lawful for
thee to have thy brother Philip’s wife.” <span
id="fr_1064"></span>[1065](#fn_1064.md)

<span id="iii.XXIV-p49"></span>Seest thou the rock? Seest thou the sand;
how easily it sinks down, how it yields to calamities? how it is
overthrown, though it have the support of royalty, of number, of
nobility? For them that pursue it, it makes more senseless than all.

<span id="iii.XXIV-p50"></span>And it doth not merely fall, but with
great calamity: for “great indeed,” He saith, “was the fall of it.” The
risk not being of trifles, but of the soul, of the loss of Heaven, and
those immortal blessings. Or rather even before that loss, no life so
wretched as he must live that follows after this; dwelling with
continual despondencies, alarms, cares, anxieties; which a certain wise
man also was intimating when he said, “The wicked fleeth, when no man is
pursuing.” <span id="fr_1065"></span>[1066](#fn_1065.md) For such men
tremble at their shadows, suspect their friends, their enemies, their
servants, such as know them, such as know them not; and before their
punishment, suffer extreme punishment here. And to declare all this,
Christ said, “And great was the fall of it;” shutting up these good
commandments with that suitable ending, and persuading even by the
things present the most unbelieving to flee from vice.

<span id="iii.XXIV-p52"></span>For although the argument from what is to
come be vaster, yet is this of more power to restrain the grosser sort,
and to withdraw them from wickedness. Wherefore also he ended with it,
that the profit thereof might make its abode in them.

<span id="iii.XXIV-p53"></span>Conscious therefore of all these things,
both the present, and the future, let us flee from vice, let us emulate
virtue, that we may not labor fruitlessly and at random, but may both
enjoy the security here, and partake of the glory there: unto which God
grant we may all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord
Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen.
