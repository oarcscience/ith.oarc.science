<span id="iii.XXXIX-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iii.XXXIX-p1.1"></span>Homily XXXIX.</span>

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.XXXIX-p2.1"></span>[Matt. XII.
1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.XXXIX-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p3"></span>*“At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath
day through the corn; and His disciples were a hungered, and began to
pluck the* <span id="fr_1644"></span>[1645](#fn_1644.md) *ears of corn, and
to eat.”*

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p5"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.XXXIX-p5.1"></span>But</span> Luke saith, “On a double
Sabbath.” <span id="fr_1645"></span>[1646](#fn_1645.md) Now what is a
double Sabbath? When the cessation from toil is twofold, both that of
the regular Sabbath, and that of another feast coming upon it. For they
call every cessation from toil, a sabbath.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p7"></span>But why could He have led them away from
it, who foreknew all, unless it had been His will that the Sabbath
should be broken? It was His will indeed, but not simply so; wherefore
He never breaks it without a cause, but giving reasonable excuses: that
He might at once bring the law to an end, and not startle them. But
there are occasions on which He even repeals it directly, and not with
circumstance: as when He anoints with the clay the eyes of the blind
man; <span id="fr_1646"></span>[1647](#fn_1646.md) as when He saith, “My
Father worketh hitherto, and I work.” <span
id="fr_1647"></span>[1648](#fn_1647.md) And He doth so, by this to glorify
His own Father, by the other to soothe the infirmity of the Jews. At
which last He is laboring here, putting forward as a plea the necessity
of nature; although in the case of acknowledged sins, that could not of
course ever be an excuse. For neither may the murderer make his anger a
plea, nor the adulterer allege his lust, no, nor any other excuse; but
here, by mentioning their hunger, He freed them from all blame.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p10"></span>But do thou, I pray thee, admire the
disciples, how entirely they control themselves, and make no account of
the things of the body, but esteem the table of the flesh a secondary
thing, and though they have to struggle with continual hunger, do not
even so withdraw themselves. For except hunger had sorely constrained
them, they would not have done so much as this.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p11"></span>What then do the Pharisees? “When they
saw it,” it is said, “they said unto Him, Behold, Thy disciples do that
which is not lawful to do upon the Sabbath day.” <span
id="fr_1648"></span>[1649](#fn_1648.md)

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p13"></span>Now here indeed with no great vehemence
(yet surely that would have been consistent in them),—nevertheless they
are not vehemently provoked, but simply find fault. But when He
stretched out the withered hand and healed it, <span
id="fr_1649"></span>[1650](#fn_1649.md) then they were so infuriated, as
even to consult together about slaying and destroying Him. For where
nothing great and noble is done, they are calm; but where they see any
made whole, they are savage, and fret themselves, and none so
intolerable as they are: such enemies are they of the salvation of men.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p15"></span>How then doth Jesus defend His
disciples? “Have ye not read,” saith He, “what David did in the
temple, <span id="fr_1650"></span>[1651](#fn_1650.md) when he was an
hungered, himself and all they that were with him? how he entered into
the house of God, and did eat the show-bread, which was not lawful for
him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the
priests?” <span id="fr_1651"></span>[1652](#fn_1651.md)

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p18"></span>Thus, whereas in pleading for His
disciples, He brings forward David; for Himself, it is the Father. <span
id="fr_1652"></span>[1653](#fn_1652.md)

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p20"></span>And observe His reproving manner: “Have
ye not read what David did?” For great indeed was that prophet’s glory,
so that Peter also afterwards pleading with the Jews, spake on this
wise, “Let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is
both dead and buried.” <span id="fr_1653"></span>[1654](#fn_1653.md)

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p22"></span>But wherefore doth He not call him by
the name of his rank, either on this occasion or afterwards? Perhaps
because He derived His race from him.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p23"></span>Now had they been a candid sort of
persons, He would have turned His discourse to the disciples’ suffering
from hunger; but abominable as they were and inhuman, He rather
rehearses unto them a history.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p24"></span>But Mark saith, “In the days of Abiathar
the High Priest:” <span id="fr_1654"></span>[1655](#fn_1654.md) not stating
what was con <span id="page_251">p. 251</span> <span
id="iii.XXXIX-Page_251"></span> trary to the history, but implying that
he had two names; and adds that “he gave unto him,” <span
id="fr_1655"></span>[1656](#fn_1655.md) indicating that herein also David
had much to say for himself, since even the very priest suffered him;
and not only suffered, but even ministered unto him. For tell me not
that David was a prophet, for not even so was it lawful, but the
privilege was the priests’: wherefore also He added, “but for the
priests only.” For though he were ten thousand times a prophet, yet was
he not a priest; and though he were himself a prophet, yet not so they
that were with him; since to them too we know that he gave.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p27"></span>“What then,” it might be said, “were
they all one with David?” Why talk to me of dignity, where there seems
to be a transgression of the law, even though it be the constraint of
nature? Yea, and in this way too He hath the more entirely acquitted
them of the charges, in that he who is greater is found to have done the
same.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p28"></span>“And what is this to the question,” one
may say; “for it was not surely the Sabbath, that he transgressed?” Thou
tellest me of that which is greater, and which especially shows the
wisdom of Christ, that letting go the Sabbath, He brings another example
greater than the Sabbath. For it is by no means the same, to break in
upon a day, and to touch that holy table, which it was not lawful for
any man to touch. Since the Sabbath indeed hath been violated, and that
often; nay rather it is continually being violated, both by
circumcision, and by many other works; and at Jericho <span
id="fr_1656"></span>[1657](#fn_1656.md) too one may see the same to have
happened; but this happened then only. So that He more than obtains the
victory. How then did no man blame David, although there was yet another
ground of charge heavier than this, that of the priests’ murder, which
had its origin from this? But He states it not, as applying himself to
the present subject only.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p30"></span>2. Afterwards again He refutes it in
another way also. For as at first He brought in David, by the dignity of
the person quelling their pride; so when He had stopped their mouths,
and had put down their boasting, then He adds also the more appropriate
refutation. And of what sort is this? “Know ye not, that in the temple
the priests profane the Sabbath, and are blameless?” <span
id="fr_1657"></span>[1658](#fn_1657.md) For in that other instance indeed,
saith He, the emergency made the relaxation, but here is the relaxation
even without emergency. He did not however at once thus refute them but
first by way of permission, afterwards as insisting upon his argument.
Because it was meet to draw the stronger inference last, although the
former argument also had of course its proper weight.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p32"></span>For tell me not, that it is not freeing
one’s self from blame, to bring forward another who is committing the
same sin. For when the doer incurs no blame, the act on which he hath
ventured becomes a rule for others to plead.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p33"></span>Nevertheless He was not satisfied with
this, but subjoins also what is more decisive, saying that the deed is
no sin at all; and this more than anything was the sign of a glorious
victory, to point to the law repealing itself, and in two ways doing so,
first by the place, then by the Sabbath; or rather even in three ways,
in that both the work is twofold <span
id="fr_1658"></span>[1659](#fn_1658.md) that is done, and with it goes also
another thing, its being done by the priests; and what is yet more, that
it is not even brought as a charge. “For they,” saith He, “are
blameless.”

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p35"></span>Seest thou how many points He hath
stated? the place; for He saith, “In the temple;” the persons, for they
are “the priests;” the time, for He saith, “the Sabbath;” the act
itself, for “they profane;” (He not having said, “they break,” but what
is more grievous, “they profane;”) that they not only escape punishment,
but are even free from blame, “for they,” saith He, “are blameless.”

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p36"></span>Do not ye therefore account this, He
saith, like the former instance. For that indeed was done both but once,
and not by a priest, and was of necessity; wherefore also they were
deserving of excuse; but this last is both done every Sabbath, and by
priests, and in the temple, and according to the law. And therefore
again not by favor, but in a legal way, they are acquitted of the
charges. For not at all as blaming them did I so speak, saith He, nor
yet as freeing them from blame in the way of indulgence, but according
to the principle of justice.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p37"></span>And He seems indeed to be defending
them, but it is His disciples whom He is clearing of the alleged faults.
For when He saith, “those are blameless,” He means, “much more are
these.”

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p38"></span>“But they are not priests.” Nay, they
are greater than priests. For the Lord of the temple Himself is here:
the truth, not the type. Wherefore He said also,

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p39"></span>“But I say unto you, That in this place
is one greater than the temple.” <span
id="fr_1659"></span>[1660](#fn_1659.md)

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span> <span id="iii.XXXIX-Page_252"></span>

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p41"></span>Nevertheless, great as the sayings were
which they heard, they made no reply, for the salvation of men was not
their object.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p42"></span>Then, because to the hearers it would
seem harsh, He quickly draws a veil over it, giving His discourse, as
before, a lenient turn, yet even so expressing Himself with a rebuke.
“But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have <span
id="fr_1660"></span>[1661](#fn_1660.md) mercy and not sacrifice, ye would
not have condemned the guiltless.” <span
id="fr_1661"></span>[1662](#fn_1661.md)

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p45"></span>Seest thou how again He inclines His
speech to lenity, yet again shows them to be out of the reach of lenity?
“For ye would not have condemned,” saith He, “the guiltless.” Before
indeed He inferred the same from what is said of the priests, in the
words, “they are guiltless;” but here He states it on His own authority;
or rather, this too is out of the law, for He was quoting a prophetic
saying. <span id="fr_1662"></span>[1663](#fn_1662.md)

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p47"></span>3. After this He mentions another reason
likewise; “For the Son of man,” saith He, “is Lord of the Sabbath
day;” <span id="fr_1663"></span>[1664](#fn_1663.md) speaking it of Himself.
But Mark relates Him to have said this of our common nature also; for He
said, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.” <span
id="fr_1664"></span>[1665](#fn_1664.md)

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p50"></span>Wherefore then was he punished that was
gathering the sticks? <span id="fr_1665"></span>[1666](#fn_1665.md) Because
if the laws were to be despised even at the beginning, of course they
would scarcely be observed afterwards.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p52"></span>For indeed the Sabbath did at the first
confer many and great benefits; for instance, it made them gentle
towards those of their household, and humane; it taught them God’s
providence and the creation, as Ezekiel saith; <span
id="fr_1666"></span>[1667](#fn_1666.md) it trained them by degrees to
abstain from wickedness, and disposed them to regard the things of the
Spirit.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p54"></span>For because they could not have borne
it, <span id="fr_1667"></span>[1668](#fn_1667.md) if when He was giving the
law for the Sabbath, He had said, “Do your good works on the Sabbath,
but do not the works which are evil,” therefore He restrained them from
all alike for, “Ye must do nothing at all,” saith He: and not even so
were they kept in order. But He Himself, in the very act of giving the
law of the Sabbath, did even therein darkly signify that He will have
them refrain from the evil works only, by the saying, “Ye must do no
work, except what shall be done for your life.” <span
id="fr_1668"></span>[1669](#fn_1668.md) And in the temple too all went on,
and with more diligence and double toil. <span
id="fr_1669"></span>[1670](#fn_1669.md) Thus even by the very shadow He was
secretly opening unto them the truth.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p58"></span>Did Christ then, it will be said, repeal
a thing so highly profitable? Far from it; nay, He greatly enhanced it.
For it was time for them to be trained in all things by the higher
rules, and it was unnecessary that his hands should be bound, who was
freed from wickedness, winged for all good works; or that men should
hereby learn that God made all things; or that they should so be made
gentle, who are called to imitate God’s own love to mankind (for He
saith, “Be ye merciful, as your Heavenly Father”); <span
id="fr_1670"></span>[1671](#fn_1670.md) or that they should make one day a
festival, who are commanded to keep a feast all their life long; (“For
let us keep the feast,” it is said, “not with old leaven, neither with
leaven of malice and wickedness; but with unleavened bread of sincerity
and truth”); <span id="fr_1671"></span>[1672](#fn_1671.md) as neither need
they stand by an ark and a golden altar, who have the very Lord of all
for their inmate, and in all things hold communion with Him; by prayer,
and by oblation, and by scriptures, and by almsgiving, and by having Him
within them. Lo now, why is any Sabbath required, by him who is always
keeping the feast, whose conversation is in Heaven?

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p61"></span>4. Let us keep the feast then
continually, and do no evil thing; for this is a feast: and let our
spiritual things be made intense, while our earthly things give place:
and let us rest a spiritual rest, refraining our hands from
covetousness; withdrawing our body from our superfluous and unprofitable
toils, from such as the people of the Hebrews did of old endure in
Egypt. For there is no difference betwixt us who are gathering gold, and
those that were bound in the mire, working at those bricks, and
gathering stubble, and being beaten. Yea, for now too the devil bids us
make bricks, as Pharaoh did then. For what else is gold, than mire? and
what else is silver, than stubble? Like stubble, at least, it kindles
the flame of desire; like mire, so doth gold defile him that possesses
it.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p62"></span>Wherefore He sent us, not Moses from the
wilderness, but His Son from Heaven. If then, after He is come, thou
abide in Egypt, thou wilt suffer with the Egyptians: but if leaving that
land thou go up with the spiritual Israel, thou shalt see all the
miracles.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p63"></span>Yet not even this suffices for
salvation. For we must not only be delivered out of Egypt, but we must
also enter into the promise. Since the Jews too, as Paul saith, both
went through the Red Sea, <span id="fr_1672"></span>[1673](#fn_1672.md) and
ate manna, <span id="page_253">p. 253</span> <span
id="iii.XXXIX-Page_253"></span> and drank spiritual drink, but
nevertheless they all perished.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p65"></span>Lest then the same befall us also, let
us not be slow, neither draw back; but when thou hearest wicked spies
even now bringing up an evil report against the strait and narrow way,
and uttering the same kind of talk as those spies of old, let not the
multitude, but Joshua, be our pattern, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
and do not thou give up, until thou have attained the promise, and
entered into the Heavens.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p66"></span>Neither account the journey to be
difficult. “For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God, much
more, being reconciled, shall we be saved.” <span
id="fr_1673"></span>[1674](#fn_1673.md) “But this way,” it will be said,
“is strait and narrow.” Well, but the former, through which thou hast
come, is not strait and narrow only, but even impassable, and full of
savage wild beasts. And as there was no passing through the Red Sea,
unless that miracle had been wrought, so neither could we, abiding in
our former life, have gone up into Heaven, but only by baptism
intervening. Now if the impossible hath become possible, much more will
the difficult be easy.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p68"></span>“But that,” it will be said, “was of
grace only.” Why, for this reason especially thou hast just cause to
take courage. For if, where it was grace alone, He wrought with you;
will He not much more be your aid, where ye also show forth laborious
works? If He saved thee, doing nothing, will He not much more help thee,
working?

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p69"></span>Above <span
id="fr_1674"></span>[1675](#fn_1674.md) indeed I was saying, that from the
impossibilities thou oughtest to take courage about the difficulties
also; but now I add this, that if we are vigilant, these will not be so
much as difficult. For mark it: death is trodden under foot, the devil
hath fallen, the law of sin is extinguished, the grace of the Spirit is
given, life is contracted into a small space, the heavy burdens are
abridged.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p71"></span>And to convince thee hereof by the
actual results, see how many have overshot the injunctions of Christ;
and art thou afraid of that which is just their measure? What plea then
wilt thou have, when others are leaping beyond the bounds, and thou
thyself too slothful for what is enacted?

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p72"></span>Thus, thee we admonish to give alms of
such things as thou hast, but another hath even stripped himself of all
his possessions: thee we require to live chastely with thy wife, but
another hath not so much as entered into marriage: and thee we entreat
not to be envious, but another we find giving up even his own life for
charity: thee again we entreat to be lenient in judgments, and not
severe to them that sin, but another, even when smitten, hath turned the
other cheek also.

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p73"></span>What then shall we say, I pray thee?
What excuse shall we make, not doing even these things, when others go
so far beyond us? And they would not have gone beyond us, had not the
thing been very easy. For which pines away, he who envies other men’s
blessings, or he who takes pleasure with them, and rejoices? Which eyes
all things with suspicion and continual trembling, the chaste man, or
the adulterer? Which is cheered by good hopes, he that spoils by
violence, or he that shows mercy, and imparts of his own to the needy?

<span id="iii.XXXIX-p74"></span>Let us then bear in mind these things,
and not be torpid in our career for virtue’s sake; but having stripped
ourselves with all readiness for these glorious wrestlings, let us labor
for a little while, that we may win the perpetual and imperishable
crowns; unto which may we all attain, by the grace and love towards man
of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might forever and ever.
Amen.
