<span id="iii.XLVII-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.XLVII-p2.1"></span>[Matt.
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#034.md),
[35](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#035.md)<span
id="iii.XLVII-p2.2"></span>.</span>

<span id="iii.XLVII-p3"></span>*“All these things spake Jesus unto the
multitudes in parables, and without a parable spake He not* <span
id="fr_1835"></span>[1836](#fn_1835.md) *unto them; that it might be
fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth
in parables; I will utter things that have been kept secret* <span
id="fr_1836"></span>[1837](#fn_1836.md) *from the foundation of the
world.”* <span id="fr_1837"></span>[1838](#fn_1837.md)

<span id="iii.XLVII-p7"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.XLVII-p7.1"></span>But</span> Mark saith, “As they were able to
hear it, He spake the word unto them in parables.” <span
id="fr_1838"></span>[1839](#fn_1838.md)

<span id="iii.XLVII-p9"></span>Then pointing out that He is not making a
new thing, He brings in the Prophet also, proclaiming beforehand this
His manner of teaching. And to teach us the purpose of Christ, how He
discoursed in this manner, not that they might be ignorant, but that He
might lead them to inquiry, he added, “And without a parable spake He
nothing unto them.” Yet surely He did say many things without a parable;
but then nothing. And for all this no man asked Him questions, whereas
the Prophets, we know, they were often questioning: as Ezekiel, <span
id="fr_1839"></span>[1840](#fn_1839.md) for instance; as many others: but
these did no such thing. Yet surely His sayings were enough to cast them
into perplexity, and to stir them up to the inquiry; for indeed a very
sore punishment was threatened by those parables: however, not even so
were they moved.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p11"></span>Wherefore also He left them and went
away. For,

<span id="iii.XLVII-p12"></span>“Then,” saith he, “Jesus sent the
multitudes away, <span id="fr_1840"></span>[1841](#fn_1840.md) and went
into His house.” <span id="fr_1841"></span>[1842](#fn_1841.md)

<span id="iii.XLVII-p15"></span>And not one of the Scribes follows Him;
whence it is clear that for no other purpose did they follow, than to
take hold of Him. <span id="fr_1842"></span>[1843](#fn_1842.md) But when
they marked not His sayings, thenceforth He let them be.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p17"></span>“And His disciples come unto Him, asking
Him concerning the parable of the tares;” <span
id="fr_1843"></span>[1844](#fn_1843.md) although at times wishing to learn,
and afraid <span id="fr_1844"></span>[1845](#fn_1844.md) to ask. Whence
then arose their confidence in this instance? They had been told, “To
you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of Heaven;” and
they were emboldened. Wherefore also they ask in private; not as
grudging the multitude, but observing their Master’s law. For, “To
these,” saith He, “it is not given.”

<span id="iii.XLVII-p20"></span>And why may it be that they let pass the
parable of the leaven, and of the mustard seed, and inquire concerning
this? They let those pass, as being plainer; but about this, as having
an affinity to that before spoken, and as setting forth something more
than it, they are desirous to learn (since He would not have spoken the
same to them a second time); for indeed they saw how severe was the
threatening therein uttered. <span id="fr_1845"></span>[1846](#fn_1845.md)
Wherefore neither doth He blame them, but rather completes His previous
statements.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p22"></span>And, as I am always saying, the parables
must not be explained throughout word for word, since many absurdities
will follow; this even He Himself is teaching us here in thus
interpreting this parable. Thus He saith not at all who the servants are
that came to Him, but, implying that He brought them in, for the sake of
some order, and to make up the picture, He omits that part, and
interprets those that are most urgent and essential, and for the sake of
which the parable was spoken; signifying Himself to be Judge and Lord of
all.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p23"></span>“And He answered,” so it is said, “and
said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of Man; the
field is the world, the good seed, these are the children of the
kingdom, but the tares are the children of the wicked one; the enemy
that soweth them is the devil; and the harvest is the end of the world,
and the reapers are angels. As therefore the tares are gathered and
burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of
Man shall send His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all
things that offend, and them which do iniquity; <span
id="fr_1846"></span>[1847](#fn_1846.md) <span id="page_286">p. 286</span>
<span id="iii.XLVII-Page_286"></span> and shall cast them into the
furnace of fire, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then
shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their
Father.” <span id="fr_1847"></span>[1848](#fn_1847.md)

<span id="iii.XLVII-p26"></span>For whereas He Himself is the sower, and
that of His own field, and out of His own kingdom He gathers, it is
quite clear that the present world also is His.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p27"></span>But mark His unspeakable love to man,
and His leaning to bounty, and His disinclination to punishment; in
that, when He sows, He sows in His own person, but when He punishes, it
is by others, that is, by the angels.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p28"></span>“Then shall the righteous shine forth as
the sun in the kingdom of their Father.” Not because it will be just so
much only, but because this star is surpassed in brightness by none that
we know. He uses the comparisons that are known to us.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p29"></span>And yet surely elsewhere He saith, the
harvest is already come; as when He saith of the Samaritans, “Lift up
your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to
harvest.” <span id="fr_1848"></span>[1849](#fn_1848.md) And again, “The
harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few.” <span
id="fr_1849"></span>[1850](#fn_1849.md) How then saith He there, that the
harvest is already come, while here He said, it is yet to be? According
to another signification.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p32"></span>And how having elsewhere said, “One
soweth, and another reapeth,” <span id="fr_1850"></span>[1851](#fn_1850.md)
doth He here say, it is Himself that soweth? Because there again, He was
speaking, to distinguish the apostles, not from Himself, but from the
prophets, and that in the case of the Jews and Samaritans. Since
certainly it was He who sowed through the prophets also.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p34"></span>And at times He calls this self-same
thing both harvest and sowing, naming it with relation, now to one
thing, now to another. Thus when He is speaking of the conviction and
obedience of His converts, <span id="fr_1851"></span>[1852](#fn_1851.md) He
calls the thing “a harvest,” as though He had accomplished all; but when
He is seeking after the fruit of their hearing, He calls it seed, and
the end, harvest.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p36"></span>And how saith He elsewhere, that “the
righteous are caught up first?” <span
id="fr_1852"></span>[1853](#fn_1852.md) Because they are indeed caught up
first, but Christ being come, those others are given over to punishment,
and then the former depart into the kingdom of heaven. For because they
must be in heaven, but He Himself is to come and judge all men here;
having passed sentence upon these, like some king He rises with His
friends, leading them to that blessed portion. Seest thou that the
punishment is twofold, first to be burnt up, and then to fall from that
glory?

<span id="iii.XLVII-p38"></span>2. But wherefore doth He still go on,
when the others have withdrawn, to speak to these also in parables? They
had become wiser by His sayings, so as even to understand. At any rate,
to them He saith afterwards,

<span id="iii.XLVII-p39"></span>“Have ye understood all these things?
They say unto Him, Yea, Lord.” <span
id="fr_1853"></span>[1854](#fn_1853.md) So completely, together with its
other objects, did the parable effect this too, that it made them more
clear sighted. What then saith He again?

<span id="iii.XLVII-p41"></span>“The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto
treasure hid in a field, the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and
for joy thereof selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. Again,
the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls,
who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that
he had, and bought it.” <span id="fr_1854"></span>[1855](#fn_1854.md)

<span id="iii.XLVII-p43"></span>Much as in the other place, the mustard
seed and the leaven have but some little difference from each other, so
here also these two parables, that of the treasure and that of the
pearl. This being of course signified by both, that we ought to value
the gospel above all things. And the former indeed, of the leaven and of
the mustard seed, was spoken with a view to the power of the gospel, and
to its surely prevailing over the world; but these declare its value,
and great price. For as it extends itself like mustard seed, and
prevails like leaven, so it is precious like a pearl, and affords full
abundance like a treasure. We are then to learn not this only, that we
ought to strip ourselves of everything else, and cling to the gospel,
but also that we are to do so with joy; and when a man is dispossessing
himself of his goods, he is to know that the transaction is gain, and
not loss.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p44"></span>Seest thou how both the gospel is hid in
the world, and the good things in the gospel?

<span id="iii.XLVII-p45"></span>Except thou sell all, thou buyest not;
except thou have such a soul, anxious and inquiring, thou findest not.
Two things therefore are requisite, abstinence from worldly matters, and
watchfulness. For He saith “One seeking goodly pearls, who when he had
found one of great price, sold all and bought it.” For the truth is one,
and not in many divisions.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p46"></span>And much as he that hath the pearl knows
<span id="page_287">p. 287</span> <span id="iii.XLVII-Page_287"></span>
indeed himself that he is rich, but others know not, many times, that he
is holding it in his hand (for there is no corporeal bulk); just so also
with the gospel, they that have hold of it know that they are rich, but
the unbelievers, not knowing of this treasure, are in ignorance also of
our wealth.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p47"></span>3. After this, that we may not be
confident in the gospel merely preached, nor think that faith only
suffices us for salvation, He utters also another, an awful parable.
Which then is this? That of the net.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p48"></span>“For the kingdom of Heaven is like unto
a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind; which,
when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the
good into vessels, but cast the bad away.” <span
id="fr_1855"></span>[1856](#fn_1855.md)

<span id="iii.XLVII-p50"></span>And wherein doth this differ from the
parable of the tares? For there too the one are saved, the other perish;
but there, for choosing of wicked doctrines; and those before this
again, for not giving heed to His sayings, but these for wickedness of
life; who are the most wretched of all, having attained to His
knowledge, and being caught, but not even so capable of being saved.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p51"></span>Yet surely He saith elsewhere, that the
shepherd Himself separates them, but here He saith the angels do
this; <span id="fr_1856"></span>[1857](#fn_1856.md) and so with respect to
the tares. How then is it? At one time He discourses to them in a way
more suited to their dullness, <span
id="fr_1857"></span>[1858](#fn_1857.md) at another time in a higher strain.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p54"></span>And this parable He interprets without
so much as being asked, but of His own motion He explained it by one
part of it, and increased their awe. For lest, on being told, “They cast
the bad away,” thou shouldest suppose that ruin to be without danger; by
His interpretation He signified the punishment, saying, “They will cast
them into the furnace.” <span id="fr_1858"></span>[1859](#fn_1858.md) And
He declared the gnashing of teeth, and the anguish, that it is
unspeakable.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p56"></span>Seest thou how many are the ways of
destruction? By the rock, by the thorns, by the wayside, by the tares,
by the net. Not without reason therefore did He say, “Broad is the way
that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go away <span
id="fr_1859"></span>[1860](#fn_1859.md) by it.” <span
id="fr_1860"></span>[1861](#fn_1860.md)

<span id="iii.XLVII-p59"></span>4. Having then uttered all this, and
concluded His discourse in a tone to cause fear, and signified that
these are the majority of cases (for He dwelt more on them). He saith,

<span id="iii.XLVII-p60"></span>“Have ye understood all these things?
They say unto Him, Yea, Lord.” <span
id="fr_1861"></span>[1862](#fn_1861.md)

<span id="iii.XLVII-p62"></span>Then because they understood, He again
praises them, saying,

<span id="iii.XLVII-p63"></span>“Therefore every Scribe, which is
instructed in the Kingdom of Heaven, <span
id="fr_1862"></span>[1863](#fn_1862.md) is like unto a man that is an
householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and
old.” <span id="fr_1863"></span>[1864](#fn_1863.md)

<span id="iii.XLVII-p66"></span>Wherefore elsewhere also He saith, “I
will send you wise men and scribes.” <span
id="fr_1864"></span>[1865](#fn_1864.md) Seest thou how so far from
excluding the Old Testament, He even commends it, and speaks publicly in
favor of it, calling it “a treasure”?

<span id="iii.XLVII-p68"></span>So that as many as are ignorant of the
divine Scriptures cannot be “householders;” such as neither have of
themselves, nor receive of others, but neglect their own case, perishing
with famine. And not these only, but the heretics too, <span
id="fr_1865"></span>[1866](#fn_1865.md) are excluded from this blessing.
For they bring not forth things new and old. For they have not the old
things, wherefore neither have they the new; even as they who have not
the new, neither have they the old, but are deprived of both. For these
are bound up and interwoven one with another.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p70"></span>Let us then hear, as many of us as
neglect the reading of the Scriptures, to what harm we are subjecting
ourselves, to what poverty. For when are we to apply ourselves to the
real practice of virtue, who do not so much as know the very laws
according to which our practice should be guided? But while the rich,
those who are mad about wealth, are constantly shaking out their
garments, that they may not become moth-eaten; dost thou, seeing
forgetfulness worse than any moth wasting thy soul, neglect conversing
with books? dost thou not thrust away from thee the pest, adorn thy
soul, look continually upon the image of virtue, and acquaint thyself
with her members and her head? For she too hath a head and members more
seemly than any graceful and beautiful body.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p71"></span>What then, saith one, is the head of
virtue? Humility. Wherefore Christ also begins with it, saying, “Blessed
are the poor.” <span id="fr_1866"></span>[1867](#fn_1866.md) This head hath
not locks and ringlets, but beauty, such as to gain God’s favor. For,
“Unto whom shall I look,” saith He, “but unto him that is meek and
humble, and trembleth at my words?” <span
id="fr_1867"></span>[1868](#fn_1867.md) And, “Mine eyes are upon the meek
of the earth.” <span id="fr_1868"></span>[1869](#fn_1868.md) And, “The Lord
is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart.” <span
id="fr_1869"></span>[1870](#fn_1869.md) This head, instead of <span
id="page_288">p. 288</span> <span id="iii.XLVII-Page_288"></span> locks,
and flowing hair, bears sacrifices acceptable to God. It is a golden
altar, and a spiritual place of sacrifice; <span
id="fr_1870"></span>[1871](#fn_1870.md) “For a contrite spirit is a
sacrifice to God.” <span id="fr_1871"></span>[1872](#fn_1871.md) This is
the mother of wisdom. If a man have this, he will have the rest also.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p78"></span>Hast thou seen a head such as thou hadst
never seen? Wilt thou see the face too, or rather mark it? Mark then for
the present its color, how ruddy, and blooming, and very engaging; and
observe what are its ingredients. “Well, and what are they?”
Shame-facedness and blushing. Wherefore also some one saith, “Before a
shamefaced man shall go favor.” <span
id="fr_1872"></span>[1873](#fn_1872.md) This sheds much beauty over the
other members also. Though thou mix ten thousand colors, thou wilt not
produce such a bloom.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p80"></span>And if thou wilt see the eyes also,
behold them exactly delineated with decency and temperance. Wherefore
they become also so beautiful and sharpsighted, as to behold even the
Lord Himself. For, “Blessed,” saith He, “are the pure in heart, for they
shall see God.” <span id="fr_1873"></span>[1874](#fn_1873.md)

<span id="iii.XLVII-p82"></span>And her mouth is wisdom and
understanding, and the knowledge of spiritual hymns. And her heart,
acquaintance with Scripture, and maintenance of sound doctrines, and
benevolence, and kindness. And as without this last there is no living,
so without that other is never any salvation. Yea, for from that all her
excellencies have birth. She hath also for feet and hands the
manifestations of her good works. She hath a soul too, godliness. She
hath likewise a bosom of gold, and firmer than adamant, even fortitude;
and all may be taken captive more easily than that bosom may be riven
asunder. And the spirit that is in the brain and heart, is
charity. <span id="fr_1874"></span>[1875](#fn_1874.md)

<span id="iii.XLVII-p84"></span>5. Wilt thou that in her actual deeds
also I show thee her image? Consider, I pray thee, this very evangelist:
although we have not his whole life in writing, nevertheless even from a
few facts one may see his image shine forth.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p85"></span>First, as to his having been lowly and
contrite, hear him, after his gospel, calling himself a publican; for
his being also merciful, see him stripping himself of all and following
Jesus; and as to his piety, it is evident from his doctrines. And his
wisdom again it is easy to see from the gospel which he composed, and
his charity <span id="fr_1875"></span>[1876](#fn_1875.md) (for he cared for
the whole world); and the manifestation of his good works, from the
throne on which he is to sit; <span id="fr_1876"></span>[1877](#fn_1876.md)
and his courage too, “by his departing with joy from the presence of the
council.” <span id="fr_1877"></span>[1878](#fn_1877.md)

<span id="iii.XLVII-p89"></span>Let us imitate then this virtue, and
most of all his humility and almsgiving, without which one cannot be
saved. And this is shown by the five virgins, and together with them by
the Pharisee. For without virginity indeed it is possible to see the
kingdom, but without almsgiving it cannot be. For this is among the
things that are essential, and hold all together. Not unnaturally then
have we called it the heart of virtue. But this heart, unless it supply
breath to all, is soon extinguished. In the same way then as the
fountain also, if it confine its streams to itself, grows putrid; so it
is with the rich also, when they keep their possessions to themselves.
Wherefore even in our common conversation we say, “great is the
consumption <span id="fr_1878"></span>[1879](#fn_1878.md) of wealth with
such a man;” instead of saying, “great is the abundance, great the
treasure.” For in truth there is a consumption, not of the possessors
only, but of the riches themselves. Since both garments laid by spoil,
and gold is cankered, and corn is eaten up, and the soul too of their
owner is more than they all cankered and corrupted by the cares of them.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p91"></span>And if thou be willing to produce in the
midst a miser’s soul; like a garment eaten by innumerable worms, and not
having any sound part, even so wilt thou find it, perforated on all
sides by cares; rotted, cankered by sins.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p92"></span>But not such the poor man’s soul, the
soul of him, I mean, that is voluntarily poor; but it is resplendent as
gold, it shines like a pearl, and it blooms like a rose. For no moth is
there, no thief is there, no worldly care, but as angels converse, so do
they.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p93"></span>Wouldest thou see the beauty of this
soul? Wouldest thou acquaint thyself with the riches of poverty? He
commands not men, but he commands evil spirits. He stands not at a
king’s side, but he hath taken his stand near to God. He is the comrade,
not of men, but of angels. He hath not chests, two, or three, or twenty,
but such an abundance as to account the whole world as nothing. He hath
not a treasure, but heaven. He needs not slaves, or rather hath his
passions for slaves, hath for slaves the motives <span
id="fr_1879"></span>[1880](#fn_1879.md) that rule over kings. For that
which commands him who wears the purple, that motive shrinks before
him. <span id="fr_1880"></span>[1881](#fn_1880.md) And royalty, and gold,
and all <span id="page_289">p. 289</span> <span
id="iii.XLVII-Page_289"></span> such things, he laughs at, as at
children’s toys; and like hoops, and dice, and heads, and balls, so doth
he count all these to be contemptible. For he hath an adorning, which
they who play with these things cannot even see.

<span id="iii.XLVII-p96"></span>What then can be superior to this poor
man? He hath at least heaven for his pavement; but if the pavement be
like this, imagine the roof! But hath he not horses and chariots? Why,
what need hath he of these, who is to be borne upon the clouds, and to
be with Christ?

<span id="iii.XLVII-p97"></span>Having these things then impressed on
our minds, let us, both men and women, seek after that wealth, and the
plenty that cannot be rifled; that we may attain also unto the kingdom
of heaven, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to whom be glory and might forever and ever. Amen.
