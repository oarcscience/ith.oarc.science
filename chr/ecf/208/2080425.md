<span id="ix.cccliii-p2"></span>Libanius to Basil.

<span id="ix.cccliii-p3"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cccliii-p3.1"></span>Oh</span>, for the old days in which we were
all in all to one another!  Now we are sadly <span id="page_326">p.

another, I have no one like you to replace you.  I hear that Alcimus in
his old age is venturing on a young man’s exploits, and is hurrying to
Rome, after imposing on you the labour of remaining with the lads.  You,
who are always so kind, will not take this ill.  You were not even angry
with me for having to write first.
