<span id="ix.lxxvi-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxxvi-p5.1"></span>You</span> have many qualities which raise you
above the common run of men, but nothing is more distinctly
characteristic of you than your zeal for your country.  Thus you, who
have risen to such a height as to become illustrious throughout all the
world, pay a righteous recompense to the land that gave you birth.  Yet
she, your mother city, who bore you and nursed you, has fallen into the
incredible condition of ancient story; and no one visiting Cæsarea; not
even those most familiar with her, would recognise her as she is; to
such complete abandonment has she been suddenly transformed, many of her
magistrates having been previously removed, and now nearly all of them
transferred to Podandus.  The remainder, torn from these like mutilated
extremities, have themselves fallen into complete despair, and have
caused such a general weight of despondency, that the population of the
city is now but scanty; the place looks like a desert, a piteous
spectacle to all who love it, and a cause for delight and encouragement
to all who have long been plotting for our fall.  Who then will reach
out a hand to help us?  Who will drop a tear of pity over our faith? 
You have sympathised with a stranger city in like distress; will not
your kindly excellency feel for her who gave you birth?  If you have any
influence, show it in our present need.  Certainly you have great help
from God, Who has never abandoned you, and has given you many proofs of
His kindness.  Only be willing to exert yourself in our behalf, and use
all the influence you have for the succour of your fellow citizens.
