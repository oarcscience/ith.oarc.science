<span id="ix.lxxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.lxxxii-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXXI. <span
id="fr_2276"></span>[2277](#fn_2276.md) </span>

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p3"></span>*To Bishop Innocent*. <span
id="fr_2277"></span>[2278](#fn_2277.md)

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxxxii-p5.1"></span>I was</span> delighted to receive the letter
your affection sent me; but I am equally grieved at your having laid on
me the load of a responsibility which is more than I can carry.  How can
I, so far removed as I am, undertake so great a charge?  As long as the
Church possesses you, it rests as it were on its proper buttress. 
Should the Lord be pleased to make some dispensation in the matter of
your life, whom, from among us here can I send to take the charge of the
brethren, who will be in like esteem with yourself?  That is a very wise
and proper wish which you express in your letter, that while you are yet
alive you may see the successor destined after you to guide the chosen
flock of the Lord (like the blessed Moses, who both wished and saw).  As
the place is great and famous, and your work has great and wide renown,
and the times are difficult, needing no insignificant guide on account
of the continuous storms and tempests which are attacking the Church, I
have not thought it safe for my own soul to treat the matter
perfunctorily, specially when I bear in mind the terms in which you
write.  For you say that, accusing me of disregard of the Churches, you
mean to withstand me before the Lord.  Not then to be at issue with you,
but rather to have you on my side in my defence which I make in the
presence of Christ I have, after looking round in the assembly of the
presbyters of the city, chosen the very honourable vessel, the
offspring <span id="fr_2278"></span>[2279](#fn_2278.md) of the blessed
Hermogenes, who wrote the great and invincible creed in the great
Synod. <span id="fr_2279"></span>[2280](#fn_2279.md)   He is a presbyter of
the Church, of many years standing, of steadfast character, skilled in
canons, accurate in the faith, who has lived up to this time in
continence and ascetic discipline, although the severity of his austere
life has now subdued the flesh; a man of poverty, with no resources in
this world, so that he is not even provided with bare bread, but by the
labour of his hands gets a living with the brethren who dwell with him. 
It is my intention to send him.  If, then, this is the kind of man you
want, and not some younger man fit only to be sent and to discharge the
common duties of this world, be so good as to write to me at the first
opportunity, that I may send you this man, who is elect of God, adapted
for the present work, respected by all who meet him, and who instructs
with meekness all who differ from him.  I might have sent him at once,
but since you yourself had anticipated me in asking for a man of
honourable character, and beloved by myself, but far inferior to the one
whom I have indicated, I wished my mind in the matter to be made known
to you.  If therefore this is the kind of man you want, either send one
of the brethren to fetch him at the time of the fast, or, if you have no
one able to undertake the journey to me, let me know by letter.

preceded Dianius.  *cf. Letters* ccxliv. 9 and cclxiii. 3.  “The great
Synod” is Nicæa.  Baronius on the year 325 remarks that Basil’s memory
must have failed him, inasmuch as not Hermogenes but Leontius was
present at Nicæa as Bishop of Cæsarea.  But Hermogenes may have been
present in lower orders.  *cf*. Stanley, *East. Ch*. pp. 105, 140.
