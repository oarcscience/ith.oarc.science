<span id="ix.clxx-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.clxx-p1.1"></span>Letter CLXIX. <span
id="fr_2558"></span>[2559](#fn_2558.md) </span>

<span id="ix.clxx-p3"></span>*Basil to Gregory*. <span
id="fr_2559"></span>[2560](#fn_2559.md)

<span id="ix.clxx-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxx-p5.1"></span>You</span> have undertaken a kindly and
charitable task in getting together the captive troop of the insolent
Glycerius (at present I must so write), and, so far as in you lay,
covering our common shame.  It is only right that your reverence should
undo this dishonour with a full knowledge of the facts about him.

<span id="ix.clxx-p6"></span>This grave and venerable Glycerius of yours
was ordained by me deacon of the church of Venesa <span
id="fr_2560"></span>[2561](#fn_2560.md) to serve the presbyter, and look
after the work of the Church, for, though the fellow is in other
respects intractable, he is naturally clever at manual labour.  No
sooner was he appointed than he neglected his work, as though there had
been absolutely nothing to do.  But, of his own private power and
authority, he got together some wretched virgins, some of whom came to
him of their own accord (you know how young people are prone to anything
of this <span id="page_218">p. 218</span> <span
id="ix.clxx-Page_218"></span>kind), and others were unwillingly forced
to accept him as leader of their company.  Then he assumed the style and
title of patriarch, and began all of a sudden to play the man of
dignity.  He had not attained to this on any reasonable or pious ground;
his only object was to get a means of livelihood, just as some men start
one trade and some another.  He has all but upset the whole Church,
scorning his own presbyter, a man venerable both by character and age;
scorning his chorepiscopus, and myself, as of no account at all,
continually filling the town and all the clergy with disorder and
disturbance.  And now, on being mildly rebuked by me and his
chorepiscopus, that he may not treat us with contempt (for he was trying
to stir the younger men to like insubordination), he is meditating
conduct most audacious and inhuman.  After robbing as many of the
virgins as he could, he has made off by night.  I am sure all this will
have seemed very sad to you.  Think of the time too.  The feast was
being held there, and, as was natural, large numbers of people were
gathered together.  He, however, on his side, brought out his own troop,
who followed young men and danced round them, causing all well-disposed
persons to be most distressed, while loose chatterers laughed aloud. 
And even this was not enough, enormous as was the scandal.  I am told
that even the parents of the virgins, finding their bereavement
unendurable, wishful to bring home the scattered company, and falling
with not unnatural sighs and tears at their daughters’ feet, have been
insulted and outraged by this excellent young man and his troop of
bandits.  I am sure your reverence will think all this intolerable.  The
ridicule of it attaches to us all alike.  First of all, order him to
come back with the virgins.  He might find some mercy, if he were to
come back with a letter from you.  If you do not adopt this course, at
least send the virgins back to their mother the Church.  If this cannot
be done, at all events do not allow any violence to be done to those
that are willing to return, but get them to return to me.  Otherwise I
call God and man to witness that all this is ill done, and a breach of
the law of the Church.  The best course would be for Glycerius to come
back with a letter, <span id="fr_2561"></span>[2562](#fn_2561.md) and in a
becoming and proper frame of mind; if not, let him be deprived of his
ministry. <span id="fr_2562"></span>[2563](#fn_2562.md)

<span id="ix.clxx-p4"></span> Tillemont says either of Nyssa or
Nazianzus.  In the <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxx-p4.1"></span>ms.</span> Coisl. I. it is preceded by lxxi.,
unquestionably addressed to Gregory of Nazianzus, and inscribed “to the
same.”  In the *Codex Harl.* it is inscribed <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.clxx-p4.2"></span>Γρηγορί& 251· ἑταίρῳ</span>.  Garnier, however
(*Vit. S. Bas*. xxxi. § iv.) allows that there are arguments in favor of
Gregory of Nyssa.  Probably it is the elder Gregory who is addressed.
