<span id="ix.cclviii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cclviii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLVII. <span
id="fr_3128"></span>[3129](#fn_3128.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cclviii-p3"></span>To the monks harassed by the Arians.

<span id="ix.cclviii-p4"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclviii-p4.1"></span>I have</span> thought it only right to
announce to you by letter how I said to myself, when I heard of the
trials brought upon you by the enemies of God, that in a time reckoned a
time of peace you have won for yourselves the blessings promised to all
who suffer persecution for the sake of the name of Christ.  In my
judgment the war that is waged against us by our fellow countrymen is
the hardest to bear, because against open and declared enemies it is
easy to defend ourselves, while we are necessarily at the mercy of those
who are associated with us, and are thus exposed to continual danger. 
This has been your case.  Our fathers were persecuted, but by idolaters
their substance was plundered, their houses were overthrown, they
themselves were driven into exile, by our open enemies, for Christ’s
name’s sake.  The persecutors who have lately appeared, hate us no less
than they, but, to the deceiving of many, they put forward the name of
Christ, that the persecuted may be robbed of all comfort from its
confession, because the majority of simpler folk, while admitting that
we are being wronged, are unwilling to reckon our death for the truth’s
sake to be martyrdom.  I am therefore persuaded that the reward in store
for you from the righteous Judge is yet greater than that bestowed on
those former martyrs.  They indeed both had the public praise of men,
and received the reward of God; to you, though your good deeds are not
less, no honours are given by the people.  It is only fair that the
requital in store for you in the world to come should be far greater.

<span id="ix.cclviii-p5"></span>2.  I exhort you, therefore, not to
faint in your afflictions, but to be revived by God’s love, and to add
daily to your zeal, knowing that in you ought to be preserved that
remnant of true religion which the Lord will find when He cometh on the
earth.  Even if bishops are driven from their Churches, be not
dismayed.  If traitors have arisen from among the very clergy <span
id="fr_3129"></span>[3130](#fn_3129.md) themselves, let not this undermine
your confidence in God.  We are saved not by names, but by mind and
purpose, and genuine love toward our Creator.  Bethink you how in the
attack against our Lord, high priests and scribes and elders devised the
plot, and how few of the people were found really receiving the word. 
Remember that it is not the multitude who are being saved, but the elect
of God.  Be not then affrighted at the great multitude of the people who
are carried hither and thither by winds like the waters of the sea.  If
but one be saved, like Lot at Sodom, he ought to abide in right
judgment, keeping his hope in Christ unshaken, for the Lord will not
forsake His holy ones.  Salute all the brethren in Christ from me.  Pray
earnestly for my miserable soul.
