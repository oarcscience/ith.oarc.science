<span id="ix.xc-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.xc-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXXIX. <span
id="fr_2299"></span>[2300](#fn_2299.md) </span>

<span id="ix.xc-p3"></span>*To Meletius, bishop of Antioch*.

<span id="ix.xc-p4"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xc-p4.1"></span>The</span> eagerness of my longing is soothed by
the opportunities which the merciful God gives me of saluting your
reverence.  He Himself is witness of the earnest desire which I have to
see your face, and to enjoy your good and soul-refreshing instruction. 
Now by my reverend and excellent brother Dorotheus, the deacon, who is
setting out, first of all I beg you to pray for me that I be no
stumbling block to the people, nor hindrance to your petitions to
propitiate the Lord.  In the second place I would suggest that you would
be so good as to make all arrangements through the aforementioned
brother; and, if it seems well that a letter should be sent to the
Westerns, because it is only right that communication should be made in
writing even through our own messenger, that you will dictate the
letter.  I have met Sabinus the deacon, sent by them, and have written
to the bishops in Illyria, Italy, and Gaul, and to some of those who
have written privately to myself.  For it is right that some one should
be sent in the common interests of the Synod, conveying a second letter
which I beg you to have written.

<span id="ix.xc-p5"></span><span id="page_176">p. 176</span> <span
id="ix.xc-Page_176"></span>2.  As to what concerns the right reverend
bishop Athanasius, your intelligence is already aware of what I will
mention, that it is impossible for anything to be advanced by my
letters, or for any desirable objects to be carried out, unless by some
means or other he receives communion from you, who at that time
postponed it.  He is described as being very anxious to unite with me,
and to be willing to contribute all he can, but to be sorry that he was
sent away without communion, and that the promise still remains
unfulfilled. <span id="fr_2300"></span>[2301](#fn_2300.md)

<span id="ix.xc-p7"></span>What is going on in the East cannot have
failed to reach your reverence’s ears, but the aforementioned brother
will give you more accurate information by word of mouth.  Be so good as
to dispatch him directly after Easter, because of his waiting for the
answer from Samosata.  Look kindly on his zeal strengthen him by your
prayers and so dispatch him on this commission.

<span id="ix.xc-p6"></span> It is the contention of Tillemont that this
cannot apply to the great Athanasius, to whom Meletius is not likely to
have refused communion, but is more probably to be referred to some
other unknown Athanasius.  Maran, however, points out (*Vit. Bas*.
xxii.) not only how the circumstances fit in, but how the statement that
communion was refused by Meletius is borne out by *Letter* cclviii. § 3,
*q.v.*  Athanasius was in fact so far committed to the other side in the
unhappy Antiochene dispute that it was impossible for him to recognise
Meletius.  *cf*. Newman, *Church of the Fathers*, chap. vii.
