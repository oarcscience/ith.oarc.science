<span id="vi.ii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>I.—Dogmatic.</span>

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p2"></span>I.  (i)  *Against Eunomius*.  The work
under this title comprises five books, the first three generally
accepted as genuine, the last two sometimes regarded as doubtful. 
Gregory of Nazianzus, <span id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302.md)
Jerome, <span id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303.md) and Theodoret <span
id="fr_304"></span>[305](#fn_304.md) all testify to Basil’s having written
against Eunomius, but do not specify the number of books.  Books IV. and
V. are accepted by Bellarmine, Du Pin, Tillemont, and Ceillier, mainly
on the authority of the edict of Justinian against the Three Chapters
(Mansi ix., 552), the Council of Seville (Mansi x., 566) and the Council
of Florence (Hardouin ix., 200).  Maran (*Vit. Bas*. xliii.) speaks
rather doubtfully.  Böhringer describes them as of suspicious character,
alike on grounds of style, and of their absence from some <span
class="c14"><span id="vi.ii.ii-p5.1"></span>mss.</span>  They may
possibly be notes on the controversy in general, and not immediately
directed against Eunomius.  Fessler’s conclusion is *“Major tamen
eruditorum pars eos etiam genuinos esse censet.”*

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p6"></span>The year 364 is assigned for the date of
the publication of the three books. <span
id="fr_305"></span>[306](#fn_305.md)   At that time Basil sent them with a
few words of half ironical depreciation to Leontius the sophist. <span
id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306.md)   He was now about thirty-four years
of age, and describes himself as hitherto inexperienced in such a kind
of composition. <span id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307.md)   Eunomius, like
his illustrious opponent, was a Cappadocian.  Emulous of the notoriety
achieved by Aetius the Anomœan, and urged on by Secundus of Ptolemais,
an intimate associate of Aetius, he went to Alexandria about 356 and
resided there for two years as Aetius’ admiring pupil and secretary.  In
358 he accompanied Aetius to Antioch, and took a prominent part in the
assertion of the extreme doctrines which revolted the more moderate
Semiarians.  He was selected as the champion of the advanced
blasphemers, made himself consequently obnoxious to Constantius, and was
apprehended and relegated to Migde in Phrygia.  At the same time
Eudoxius withdrew for a while into Armenia, his native province, but ere
long was restored to the favour of the fickle Constantius, and was
appointed to the see of Constantinople in 359.  Eunomius now was for
overthrowing Aetius, and removing whatever obstacles stood between him
and promotion, and, by the influence of Eudoxius, was nominated to the
see of Cyzicus, vacant by the deposition of Eleusius.  Here for a while
he temporized, but ere long displayed his true sentiments.  To answer
for this he was summoned to Constantinople by Constantius, and, in his
absence, condemned and deposed.  Now he became more marked than ever in
his assertion of the most extreme Arianism, and the advanced party were
henceforward known under his name.  The accession of Julian brought him
back with the rest of the banished bishops, and he made Constantinople
the centre for the dissemination of his views. <span
id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308.md)

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p11"></span>Somewhere about this period he wrote the
work entitled *Apologeticus*, in twenty-eight chapters, to which Basil
replies.  The title was at once a parody on the *Apologies* of defenders
of the Faith, and, at the same time, a suggestion that his utterances
were not spontaneous, but forced from him by attack.  The work is
printed in Fabricius, *Bibl. Græc.* viii. 262, and in the appendix to
Migne’s *Basil. Pat. Gr.* xxx. 837. <span
id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309.md)   It is a brief treatise, and occupies
only about fifteen columns of Migne’s edition.  It professes to be a
defence of the “simpler creed which is common to all Christians.” <span
id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310.md)

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p14"></span><span id="page_xxxiv">p. xxxiv</span>
<span id="vi.ii.ii-Page_xxxiv"></span>This creed is as follows:  “We
believe in one God, Father Almighty, of Whom are all things:  and in one
only-begotten Son of God, God the Word, our Lord Jesus Christ, through
Whom are all things:  and in one Holy Spirit, the Comforter.” <span
id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311.md)   But it is in reality like the extant
*Exposition of the Creed*, <span id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md) a
reading into this “simpler” creed, in itself orthodox and
unobjectionable, of explanations which ran distinctly counter to the
traditional and instinctive faith of the Church, and inevitably demanded
corrective explanations and definitions.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p23"></span>In the creed of Eunomius the Son is
*God*, and it is not in terms denied that He is of one substance with
the Father.  But in his doctrinal system there is a practical denial of
the Creed; the Son may be styled God, but He is a creature, and
therefore, in the strict sense of the term, not God at all, and, at
best, a hero or demigod.  The Father, unbegotten, stood alone and
supreme; the very idea of “begotten” implied posteriority, inferiority,
and unlikeness.  Against this position Basil <span
id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md) protests.  The arguments of Eunomius,
he urges, are tantamount to an adoption of what was probably an Arian
formula, “We believe that ingenerateness is the essence of God,” <span
id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314.md) *i.e.*, we believe that the
Only-begotten is essentially unlike the Father. <span
id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315.md)   This word “unbegotten,” of which
Eunomius and his supporters make so much, what is its real value?  Basil
admits that it is apparently a convenient term for human intelligence to
use; but, he urges, “It is nowhere to be found in Scripture; it is one
of the main elements in the Arian blasphemy; it had better be left
alone.  The word ‘Father’ implies all that is meant by ‘Unbegotten,’ and
has moreover the advantage of suggesting at the same time the idea of
the Son.  He Who is essentially Father is alone of no other.  In this
being of no other is involved the sense of ‘Unbegotten.’  The title
‘unbegotten’ will not be preferred by us to that of Father, unless we
wish to make ourselves wiser than the Saviour, Who said, ‘Go and baptize
in the name’ not of the Unbegotten, but ‘of the Father.’” <span
id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316.md)   To the Eunomian contention that the
word “Unbegotten” is no mere complimentary title, but required by the
strictest necessity, in that it involves the confession of what He
is, <span id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317.md) Basil rejoins that it is
only one of many negative terms applied to the Deity, none of which
completely expresses the Divine Essence.  “There exists no name which
embraces the whole nature of God, and is sufficient to declare it; more
names than one, and these of very various kinds, each in accordance with
its own proper connotation, give a collective idea which may be dim
indeed and poor when compared with the whole, but is enough for
us.” <span id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318.md)   The word “unbegotten,”
like “immortal,” “invisible,” and the like, expresses only negation. 
“Yet essence <span id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319.md) is not one of the
qualities which are absent, but signifies the very being of God; to
reckon this in the same category as the non-existent is to the last
degree unreasonable.” <span id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320.md)   Basil
“would be quite ready to admit that the essence of God is unbegotten,”
but he objects to the statement that the essence and the unbegotten are
identical. <span id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321.md)   It is sometimes
supposed that the Catholic theologians have been hair-splitters in the
sphere of the inconceivable, and that heresy is the exponent of an
amiable and reverent vagueness.  In the Arian controversy it was Arius
himself who dogmatically defined with his negative “There was when He
was not,” and Eunomius with his “The essence is the unbegotten.”  “What
pride!  What conceit!” exclaims Basil.  “The idea of imagining that one
has discovered the very essence of God most high!  Assuredly in their
magniloquence they quite throw into the shade even Him who said, ‘I will
exalt my throne above the stars.’ <span
id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322.md)   It is not stars, it is not heaven,
that they dare to assail.  It is in the very essence of the God of <span
id="page_xxxv">p. xxxv</span> <span id="vi.ii.ii-Page_xxxv"></span>all
the world that they boast that they make their haunt.  Let us question
him as to where he acquired comprehension of this essence.  Was it from
the common notion that all men share? <span
id="fr_323"></span>[324](#fn_323.md)   This does indeed suggest to us that
there is a God, but not what God is.  Was it from the teaching of the
Spirit?  What teaching?  Where found?  What says great David, to whom
God revealed the hidden secrets of His wisdom?  He distinctly asserts
the unapproachableness of knowledge of Him in the words, ‘Such knowledge
is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.’ <span
id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324.md)   And Isaiah, who saw the glory of
God, what does he tell us concerning the Divine Essence?  In his
prophecy about the Christ he says, ‘Who shall declare His
generation?’ <span id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325.md)   And what of Paul,
the chosen vessel, in whom Christ spake, who was caught up into the
third heaven, who heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful to man
to utter?  What teaching has he given us of the essence of God?  When
Paul is investigating the special methods of the work of
redemption <span id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326.md) he seems to grow
dizzy before the mysterious maze which he is contemplating, and utters
the well-known words, ‘O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and
knowledge of God!  How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past
finding out!’ <span id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327.md)   These things are
beyond the reach even of those who have attained the measure of Paul’s
knowledge.  What then is the conceit of those who announce that they
know the essence of God!  I should very much like to ask them what they
have to say about the earth whereon they stand, and whereof they are
born.  What can they tell us of its ‘essence’?  If they can discourse
without hesitation of the nature of lowly subjects which lie beneath our
feet, we will believe them when they proffer opinions about things which
transcend all human intelligence.  What is the essence of the earth? 
How can it be comprehended?  Let them tell us whether reason or sense
has reached this point!  If they say sense, by which of the senses is it
comprehended?  Sight?  Sight perceives colour.  Touch?  Touch
distinguishes hard and soft, hot and cold, and the like; but no idiot
would call any of these essence.  I need not mention taste or smell,
which apprehend respectively savour and scent.  Hearing perceives sounds
and voices, which have no affinity with earth.  They must then say that
they have found out the earth’s essence by reason.  What?  In what part
of Scripture?  A tradition from what saint? <span
id="fr_328"></span>[329](#fn_328.md)

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p40"></span>“In a word, if any one wishes to realise
the truth of what I am urging, let him ask himself this question; when
he wishes to understand anything about God, does he approach the meaning
of ‘the unbegotten’?  I for my part see that, just us when we extend our
thought over the ages that are yet to come, we say that the life bounded
by no limit is without end, so is it when we contemplate in thought the
ages of the past, and gaze on the infinity of the life of God as we
might into some unfathomable ocean.  We can conceive of no beginning
from which He originated:  we perceive that the life of God always
transcends the bounds of our intelligence; and so we call that in His
life which is without origin, unbegotten. <span
id="fr_329"></span>[330](#fn_329.md)   The meaning of the unbegotten is the
having no origin from without.” <span id="fr_330"></span>[331](#fn_330.md)
  As Eunomius made ingenerateness the essence of the Divine, so, with
the object of establishing the contrast between Father and Son, he
represented the *being begotten* to indicate the essence of the
Son. <span id="fr_331"></span>[332](#fn_331.md)   God, said Eunomius, being
ingenerate, could never admit of generation.  This statement, Basil
points out, may be understood in either of two ways.  It may mean that
ingenerate nature cannot be subjected to generation.  It may mean that
ingenerate nature cannot generate.  Eunomius, he says, really means the
latter, while he makes converts of the multitude on the lines of the
former.  Eunomius makes his real meaning evident by what he adds to his
dictum, for, after saying “could never admit of generation,” he goes on,
“so as to impart His own proper nature to the begotten.” <span
id="fr_332"></span>[333](#fn_332.md)   As in relation to the Father, so now
in relation to the Son, Basil objects to the term.  Why
“begotten”? <span id="fr_333"></span>[334](#fn_333.md)   Where did he get
this word?  From what teaching?  From what prophet?  Basil nowhere finds
the Son called “begotten” in Scripture. <span
id="fr_334"></span>[335](#fn_334.md)   We read that the Father begat, but
nowhere that the Son was a *begotten thing*.  “Unto us a child is
born, <span id="fr_335"></span>[336](#fn_335.md) unto us a Son is
given.” <span id="fr_336"></span>[337](#fn_336.md)   But His name is not
*begotten thing* but “angel of great counsel.” <span
id="fr_337"></span>[338](#fn_337.md)   If this word had indicated the
essence of the Son, no other word would have been revealed by the
Spirit. <span id="fr_338"></span>[339](#fn_338.md)   Why, if God begat, may
we not call that which was begotten a thing begotten?  It is a terrible
thing for us to coin names for Him to Whom <span id="page_xxxvi">p.
xxxvi</span> <span id="vi.ii.ii-Page_xxxvi"></span>God has given a “name
which is above every name.” <span id="fr_339"></span>[340](#fn_339.md)   We
must not add to or take from what is delivered to us by the
Spirit. <span id="fr_340"></span>[341](#fn_340.md)   Things are not made
for names, but names for things. <span id="fr_341"></span>[342](#fn_341.md)
  Eunomius unhappily was led by distinction of name into distinction of
being. <span id="fr_342"></span>[343](#fn_342.md)   If the Son is begotten
in the sense in which Eunomius uses the word, He is neither begotten of
the essence of God nor begotten from eternity.  Eunomius represents the
Son as not of the essence of the Father, because begetting is only to be
thought of as a sensual act and idea, and therefore is entirely
unthinkable in connexion with the being of God.  “The essence of God
does not admit of begetting; no other essence exists for the Son’s
begetting; therefore I say that the Son was begotten when
non-existent.” <span id="fr_343"></span>[344](#fn_343.md)   Basil rejoins
that no analogy can hold between divine generation or begetting and
human generation or begetting.  “Living beings which are subject to
death generate through the operation of the senses:  but we must not on
this account conceive of God in the same manner; nay, rather shall we be
hence guided to the truth that, because corruptible beings operate in
this manner, the Incorruptible will operate in an opposite
manner.” <span id="fr_344"></span>[345](#fn_344.md)   “All who have even a
limited loyalty to truth ought to dismiss all corporeal similitudes. 
They must be very careful not to sully their conceptions of God by
material notions.  They must follow the theologies <span
id="fr_345"></span>[346](#fn_345.md) delivered to us by the Holy Ghost. 
They must shun questions which are little better than conundrums, and
admit of a dangerous double meaning.  Led by the ray that shines forth
from light to the contemplation of the divine generation, they must
think of a generation worthy of God, without passion, partition,
division, or time.  They must conceive of the image of the invisible God
not after the analogy of images which are subsequently fashioned by
craft to match their archetype, but as of one nature and subsistence
with the originating prototype <span id="fr_346"></span>[347](#fn_346.md)
.… <span id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347.md)   This image is not produced
by imitation, for the whole nature of the Father is expressed in the Son
as on a seal.” <span id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348.md)   “Do not press
me with the questions:  What is the generation?  Of what kind was it? 
In what manner could it be effected?  The manner is ineffable, and
wholly beyond the scope of our intelligence; but we shall not on this
account throw away the foundation of our faith in Father and Son.  If we
try to measure everything by our comprehension, and to suppose that what
we cannot comprehend by our reasoning is wholly non-existent, farewell
to the reward of faith; farewell to the reward of hope!  If we only
follow what is clear to our reason, how can we be deemed worthy of the
blessings in store for the reward of faith in things not seen”? <span
id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349.md)

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p62"></span>If not of the essence of God, the Son
could not be held to be eternal.  “How utterly absurd,” exclaims Basil,
“to deny the glory of God to have had brightness; <span
id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350.md) to deny the wisdom of God to have been
ever with God!…The Father is of eternity.  So also is the Son of
eternity, united by generation to the unbegotten nature of the Father. 
This is not my own statement.  I shall prove it by quoting the words of
Scripture.  Let me cite from the Gospel ‘In the beginning was the
Word,’ <span id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351.md) and from the Psalm, other
words spoken as in the person of the Father, ‘From the womb before the
morning I have begotten them.’ <span id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352.md)
   Let us put both together, and say, He was, and He was begotten.…How
absurd to seek for something higher in the case of the unoriginate and
the unbegotten!  Just as absurd is it to start questions as to time,
about priority in the case of Him Who was with the Father from eternity,
and between Whom and Him that begat Him there is no interval.” <span
id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353.md)

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p67"></span>A dilemma put by Eunomius was the
following:  When God begat the Son, the Son either was or was not. <span
id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354.md)   If He was not, no argument could lie
against Eunomius and the Arians.  If He was, the position is blasphemous
and absurd, for that which is needs no begetting. <span
id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355.md)

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p70"></span>To meet this dilemma, Basil drew a
distinction between eternity and the being unoriginate. <span
id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356.md)   The Eunomians, from the fact of the
unoriginateness of the Father being called eternity, maintained that
unoriginateness and eternity are identical. <span
id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357.md)   Because the Son is not unbegotten
they do not even allow Him to be eternal.  But there is a wide
distinction to be observed in the meaning of the terms.  The word
*unbegotten* is <span id="page_xxxvii">p. xxxvii</span> <span
id="vi.ii.ii-Page_xxxvii"></span>predicated of that which has origin of
itself, and no cause of its being:  the word *eternal* is predicated of
that which is in being beyond all time and age. <span
id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358.md)   Wherefore the Son is both not
unbegotten and eternal. <span id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359.md)  
Eunomius was ready to give great dignity to the Son as a supreme
creature.  He did not hold the essence of the Son to be common to that
of the things created out of nothing. <span
id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360.md)   He would give Him as great a
preëminence as the Creator has over His own created works. <span
id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361.md)   Basil attributes little importance
to this concession, and thinks it only leads to confusion and
contradiction.  If the God of the universe, being unbegotten,
necessarily differs from things begotten, and all things begotten have
their common hypostasis of the non-existent, what alternative is there
to a natural conjunction of all such things?  Just as in the one case
the unapproachable effects a distinction between the natures, so in the
other equality of condition brings them into mutual contact.  They say
that the Son and all things that came into being under Him are of the
non-existent, and so far they make those natures common, and yet they
deny that they give Him a nature of the non-existent.  For again, as
though Eunomius were Lord himself, and able to give to the Only Begotten
what rank and dignity he chooses, he goes on to argue,—We attribute to
Him so much supereminence as the Creator must of necessity have over His
own creature.  He does not say, “We conceive,” or “We are of opinion,”
as would be befitting when treating of God, but he says “We attribute,”
as though he himself could control the measure of the attribution.  And
how much supereminence does he give?  As much as the Creator must
necessarily have over His own creatures.  This has not yet reached a
statement of difference of substance.  Human beings in art surpass their
own works, and yet are consubstantial with them, as the potter with his
clay, and the shipwright with his timber.  For both are alike bodies,
subject to sense, and earthy. <span id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362.md)  
Eunomius explained the title “Only Begotten” to mean that the Son alone
was begotten and created by the Father alone, and therefore was made the
most perfect minister.  “If,” rejoins Basil, “He does not possess His
glory in being perfect God, if it lies only in His being an exact and
obedient subordinate, in what does He differ from the ministering
spirits who perform the work of their service without blame? <span
id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363.md)   Indeed Eunomius joins ‘created’ to
‘begotten’ with the express object of shewing that there is no
distinction between the Son and a creature! <span
id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364.md)   And how unworthy a conception of the
Father that He should need a servant to do His work!  ‘He commanded and
they were created.’ <span id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365.md)   What
service was needed by Him Who creates by His will alone?  But in what
sense are all things said by us to be ‘through the Son’?  In that the
divine will, starting from the prime cause, as it were from a source,
proceeds to operation through its own image, God the Word.” <span
id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366.md)   Basil sees that if the Son is a
creature mankind is still without a revelation of the Divine.  He sees
that Eunomius, “by alienating the Only Begotten from the Father, and
altogether cutting Him off from communion with Him, as far as he can,
deprives us of the ascent of knowledge which is made through the Son. 
Our Lord says that all that is the Father’s is His. <span
id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367.md)   Eunomius states that there is no
fellowship between the Father and Him Who is of Him.” <span
id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368.md)   If so there is no “brightness” of
glory; no “express image of hypostasis.” <span
id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369.md)   So Dorner, <span
id="fr_370"></span>[371](#fn_370.md) who freely uses the latter portion of
the treatise, “The main point of Basil’s opposition to Eunomius is that
the word unbegotten is not a name indicative of the essence of God, but
only of a condition of existence. <span
id="fr_371"></span>[372](#fn_371.md)   The divine essence has other
predicates.  If every peculiar mode of existence causes a distinction in
essence also, then the Son cannot be of the same essence with the
Father, because He has a peculiar mode of existence, and the Father
another; and men cannot be of the same essence, because each of them
represents a different mode of existence.  By the names of Father, Son,
and Spirit, we do not understand different essences, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.ii-p86.2"></span>(</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.ii-p86.3"></span>οὐσίας</span>), but they
are names which distinguish the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.ii-p86.4"></span>ὕ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.ii-p86.5"></span>παρξις</span> of each.  All are God, and the
Father is no more God than the Son, as one man is no more man than
another.  Quantitative differences are not reckoned in respect of
essence; the question is only of being or non-being.  But this does not
exclude the idea of a variety in condition in the <span
id="page_xxxviii">p. xxxviii</span> <span
id="vi.ii.ii-Page_xxxviii"></span>Father and the Son (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.ii-p86.6"></span>ἑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.ii-p86.7"></span>τέρως ἕχειν</span>),—the
generation of the Latter.  The dignity of both is equal.  The essence of
Begetter and Begotten is identical. <span
id="fr_372"></span>[373](#fn_372.md)

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p88"></span>The Fourth Book contains notes on the
chief passages of Scripture which were relied on by Arian disputants. 
Among these are

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p89"></span><span id="vi.ii.ii-p89.1"></span>*[I Cor.
xv. 28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028.md)<span
id="vi.ii.ii-p89.2"></span>.  On the Subjection of the Son.*

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p90"></span>“If the Son is subjected to the Father in
the Godhead, then He must have been subjected from the beginning, from

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p92"></span>“If the name above every name was given
by the Father to the Son, Who was God, and every tongue owned Him Lord,
after the incarnation, because of His obedience, then before the
incarnation He neither had the name above every name nor was owned by
all to be Lord.  It follows then that after the incarnation He was

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p94"></span>“‘Greater’ is predicated in bulk, in
time, in dignity, in power, or as cause.  The Father cannot be called
greater than the Son in bulk, for He is incorporeal:  nor yet in time,
for the Son is Creator of times:  nor yet in dignity, for He was not
made what He had once not been:  nor yet in power, for ‘what things the
Father doeth, these also doeth the son likewise’: <span

would be similarly greater than He and than we, if He is cause of Him
and of us.  The words express rather the honour given by the Son to the
Father than any depreciation by the speaker; moreover what is greater is
not necessarily of a different essence.  Man is called greater than man,
and horse than horse.  If the Father is called greater, it does not
immediately follow that He is of another substance.  In a word, the
comparison lies between beings of one substance, not between those of
different substances. <span id="fr_374"></span>[375](#fn_374.md)

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p97"></span>“A man is not properly said to be greater

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p101"></span>“If the Son is the Creator of the world,
and does not know the time of the judgment, then He does not know what
He created.  For He said that He was ignorant not of the judgment, but
of the time.  How can this be otherwise than absurd?

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p102"></span>“If the Son has not knowledge of all
things whereof the Father has knowledge, then He spake untruly when He
said ‘All things that the Father hath are mine’ <span

I the Father.’ <span id="fr_378"></span>[379](#fn_378.md)   If there is a
distinction between knowing the Father and knowing the things that the
Father hath, and if, in proportion as every one is greater than what is
his, it is greater to know the Father than to know what is His, then the
Son, though He knew the greater (for no man knoweth the Father save the
Son), <span id="fr_379"></span>[380](#fn_379.md) did not know the less.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p106"></span>“This is impossible.  He was silent
concerning the season of the judgment, because it was not expedient for
men to hear.  Constant expectation kindles a warmer zeal for true
religion.  The knowledge that a long interval of time was to elapse
would have made men more careless about true religion, from the hope of
being saved by a subsequent change of <span id="page_xxxix">p.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p112"></span>“If the Son really said, ‘Father, if it
be possible, let this cup pass from me,’ He not only shewed His own
cowardice and weakness, but implied that there might be something
impossible to the Father.  The words ‘if it be possible’ are those of
one in doubt, and not thoroughly assured that the Father could save
Him.  How could not He who gave the boon of life to corpses much rather
be able to preserve life in the living?  Wherefore then did not He Who
had raised Lazarus and many of the dead supply life to Himself?  Why did
He ask life from the Father, saying, in His fear, ‘Father, if it be
possible, let this cup pass away from me’?  If He was dying unwillingly,
He had not yet humbled Himself; He had not yet been made obedient to the
Father unto death; <span id="fr_383"></span>[384](#fn_383.md) He had not

of the words ‘Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away’?  No: 
this must not be understood of Himself; it must be understood of those
who were on the point of sinning against Him, to prevent them from
sinning; when crucified in their behalf He said, ‘Father, forgive them,

God is not the head of Christ in the same sense as Christ is the head of
man.  The natures of the creature and the creative Godhead do not
exactly coincide.  God is head of Christ, as Father; Christ is head of
us, as Maker.  If the will of the Father is that we should believe in

Father, glorify Me.*

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p143"></span>“If when the Son asked to be glorified
of the Father He was asking in respect of His Godhead, and not of His
manhood, He asked for what He did not possess.  Therefore the evangelist
speaks falsely when he says ‘we beheld His glory’; <span
id="fr_403"></span>[404](#fn_403.md) and the apostle, in the words ‘They
would not have crucified the Lord of glory,’ <span

not therefore an increase of glory which he asks.  He asks that there
may be a manifestation of the œconomy. <span
id="fr_406"></span>[407](#fn_406.md)   Again, if He really asked that the
glory which He had before the world might be given Him of the Father, He
asked it because He had lost it.  He would never have sought to receive
that of which He was in possession.  But if this was the case, He had
lost not only the glory, but also the Godhead.  For the glory is
inseparable from the Godhead.  Therefore, according to Photinus, <span

that He spoke these words in accordance with the œconomy of the manhood,

Firstborn of every Creature.*

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p150"></span>“If before the creation the Son was not
a generated being but a created being, <span
id="fr_408"></span>[409](#fn_408.md) He would have been called first
created and not firstborn. <span id="fr_409"></span>[410](#fn_409.md)   If,
because He is called first <span id="page_xli">p. xli</span> <span
id="vi.ii.ii-Page_xli"></span>begotten of creation He is first created,
then because He is called first begotten of the dead <span
id="fr_410"></span>[411](#fn_410.md) He would be the first of the dead who
died.  If on the other hand He is called first begotten of the dead
because of His being the cause of the resurrection from the dead, He is
in the same manner called first begotten of creation, because He is the
cause of the bringing of the creature from the non existent into being. 
If His being called first begotten of creation indicates that He came
first into being then the Apostle, when he said, ‘all things were
created by Him and for Him’ <span id="fr_411"></span>[412](#fn_411.md)
ought to have added, ‘And He came into being first of all.’  But in
saying ‘He is before all things,’ <span
id="fr_412"></span>[413](#fn_412.md) he indicated that He exists eternally,
while the creature came into being.  ‘Is’ in the passage in question is
in harmony with the words ‘In the beginning was the Word.’ <span
id="fr_413"></span>[414](#fn_413.md)   It is urged that if the Son is first
begotten, He cannot be only begotten, and that there must needs be some
other, in comparison with whom He is styled first begotten.  Yet, O wise
objector, though He is the only Son born of the Virgin Mary, He is
called her first born.  For it is said, ‘Till she brought forth her
first born Son.’ <span id="fr_414"></span>[415](#fn_414.md)   There is
therefore no need of any brother in comparison with whom He is styled
first begotten. <span id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415.md)

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p159"></span>“It might also be said that one who was
before all generation was called first begotten, and moreover in respect
of them who are begotten of God through the adoption of the Holy Ghost,
as Paul says, ‘For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be
conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first born among

The Lord created Me (LXX.).* <span id="fr_417"></span>[418](#fn_417.md)

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p163"></span>“If it is the incarnate Lord who says ‘I
am the way,’ <span id="fr_418"></span>[419](#fn_418.md) and ‘No man cometh
unto the Father but by me,’ <span id="fr_419"></span>[420](#fn_419.md) it
is He Himself Who said, ‘The Lord created me beginning of ways.’  The
word is also used of the creation and making of a begotten being, <span
id="fr_420"></span>[421](#fn_420.md) as ‘I have created a man through the
Lord,’ <span id="fr_421"></span>[422](#fn_421.md) and again ‘He begat sons
and daughters,’ <span id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422.md) and so David,
‘Create in me a clean heart, O God,’ <span
id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423.md) not asking for another, but for the
cleansing of the heart he had.  And a new creature is spoken of, not as
though another creation came into being, but because the enlightened are
established in better works.  If the Father created the Son for works,
He created Him not on account of Himself, but on account of the works. 
But that which comes into being on account of something else, and not on
its own account, is either a part of that on account of which it came
into being, or is inferior.  The Saviour will then be either a part of
the creature, or inferior to the creature.  We must understand the
passage of the manhood.  And it might be said that Solomon uttered these
words of the same wisdom whereof the Apostle makes mention in the
passage ‘For after that in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew
not God.’ <span id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424.md)   It must moreover be
borne in mind that the speaker is not a prophet, but a writer of
proverbs.  Now proverbs are figures of other things, not the actual
things which are uttered.  If it was God the Son Who said, ‘The Lord
created me,’ He would rather have said, ‘The Father created me.’ 
Nowhere did He call Him Lord, but always Father.  The word ‘begot,’
then, must be understood in reference to God the Son, and the word
created, in reference to Him who took on Him the form of a servant.  In
all these cases we do not mention two, God apart and man apart (for He
was One), but in thought we take into account the nature of each.  Peter
had not two in his mind when he said, ‘Christ hath suffered for us in
the flesh.’ <span id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425.md)   If, they argue,
the Son is a thing begotten and not a thing made, how does Scripture
say, ‘Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath
made that same Jesus, Whom ye have crucified, both Lord and
Christ’? <span id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426.md)   We must also say here
that <span id="page_xlii">p. xlii</span> <span
id="vi.ii.ii-Page_xlii"></span>this was spoken according to the flesh
about the Son of Man; just as the angel who announced the glad tidings
to the shepherds says, ‘To you is born to-day a Saviour, Who is Christ
the Lord.’ <span id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427.md)   The word ‘to-day’
could never be understood of Him Who was before the ages.  This is more
clearly shewn by what comes afterwards where it is said, ‘That same
Jesus whom ye have crucified.’ <span id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428.md)  
If when the Son was born <span id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429.md) He was
then made wisdom, it is untrue that He was ‘the power of God and the
wisdom of God.’ <span id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md)   His wisdom did
not come into being, but existed always.  And so, as though of the
Father, it is said by David, ‘Be thou, God, my defender,’ <span
id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md) and again, ‘thou art become my
salvation,’ <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) and so Paul, ‘Let
God be true, but every man a liar.’ <span
id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md)   Thus the Lord ‘of God is made unto
us wisdom and sanctification and redemption.’ <span
id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md)   Now when the Father was made
defender and true, He was not a thing made; and similarly when the Son
was made wisdom and sanctification, He was not a thing made.  If it is
true that there is one God the Father, it is assuredly also true that
there is one Lord Jesus Christ the Saviour.  According to them the
Saviour is not God nor the Father Lord, and it is written in vain, ‘the
Lord said unto my Lord.’ <span id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md)   False
is the statement, ‘Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee.’ <span
id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436.md)   False too, ‘The Lord rained from the
Lord.’ <span id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md)   False, ‘God created in
the image of God,’ <span id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438.md) and ‘Who is

who are falsely and not properly called gods, and not to the Father and
to the Son.”

That they may know Thee, the only true God.*

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p190"></span>“The *true* (sing.) is spoken of in
contradistinction to the false (pl.).  But He is incomparable, because
in comparison with all He is in all things superexcellent.  When
Jeremiah said of the Son, ‘This is our God, and there shall none other
be accounted of in comparison with Him,’ <span
id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443.md) did he describe Him as greater even
than the Father?  That the Son also is true God, John himself declares
in the Epistle, ‘That we may know the only true God, and we are (in Him
that is true, even) in his (true) Son Jesus Christ.  This is the true
God, and eternal life.’ <span id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md)   It
would be wrong, on account of the words ‘There shall none other be
accounted of in comparison of Him,’ to understand the Son to be greater
than the Father; nor must we suppose the Father to be the only true
God.  Both expressions must be used in connexion with those who are
falsely styled, but are not really, gods.  In the same way it is said in
Deuteronomy, ‘So the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange
God with him.’ <span id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445.md)    If God is
alone invisible and wise, it does not at once follow that He is greater
than all in all things.  But the God Who is *over* all is necessarily
superior to all.  Did the Apostle, when he styled the Saviour God *over
all*, describe Him as greater than the Father?  The idea is absurd.  The
passage in question must be viewed in the same manner.  The great God
cannot be less than a different God.  When the Apostle said of the Son,
we look for ‘that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great
God and our Saviour Jesus Christ,’ <span
id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446.md) did he think of Him as greater than
the Father? <span id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447.md)   It is the Son, not
the Father, Whose appearance and advent we are waiting for.  These terms
are thus used without distinction of both the Father and the Son, and no
exact nicety is observed in their employment.  ‘Being equally with
God’ <span id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448.md) is identical with being
equal with God. <span id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449.md)   Since the Son
‘thought it not robbery’ to be equal with God, how can He be unlike and
unequal to God?  Jews are nearer true religion than Eunomius.  Whenever
the Saviour called Himself no more than Son of God, as though it were
due to the Son, if He be really Son, to be Himself equal to the Father,
they wished, it is said, to stone Him, not only because He was breaking
the Sabbath, but because, by saying that God was His own Father, He made
Himself equal with God. <span id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md)   
Therefore, even though <span id="page_xliii">p. xliii</span> <span
id="vi.ii.ii-Page_xliii"></span>Eunomius is unwilling that it should be
so, according both to the Apostle and to the Saviour’s own words, the
Son is equal with the Father.”

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p199"></span>*On* <span
id="vi.ii.ii-p199.1"></span>*[Matt. xx.
23](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#023.md)<span id="vi.ii.ii-p199.2"></span>. 
Is not Mine to give, save for whom it is prepared*. <span
id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md)

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p201"></span>“If the Son has not authority over the
judgment, and power to benefit some and chastise others, how could He
say, ‘The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto
the Son’? <span id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452.md)   And in another
place, ‘The Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins;’ <span
id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453.md) and again, ‘All power is given unto me
in heaven and in earth;’ <span id="fr_454"></span>[455](#fn_454.md) and to
Peter, ‘I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven;’ <span
id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455.md) and to the disciples, ‘Verily, I say
unto you that ye which have followed me, in the regeneration,…shall sit
upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.’ <span
id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456.md)   The explanation is clear from the
Scripture, since the Saviour said, ‘Then will I reward every man
according to his work;’ <span id="fr_457"></span>[458](#fn_457.md) and in
another place, ‘They that have done good shall come forth unto the
resurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the resurrection
of damnation.’ <span id="fr_458"></span>[459](#fn_458.md)   And the Apostle
says, ‘We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that every
one may receive the things done in his body, according to what he hath
done, whether it be good or bad.’ <span
id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459.md)   It is therefore the part of the
recipients to make themselves worthy of a seat on the left and on the
right of the Lord:  it is not the part of Him Who is able to give it,
even though the request be unjust.” <span
id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460.md)

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p211"></span>*On* <span
id="vi.ii.ii-p211.1"></span>*[Ps. xviii.
31](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#031.md)<span id="vi.ii.ii-p211.2"></span>,
LXX.  Who is God, save the Lord?  Who is God save our God?*

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p212"></span>“It has already been sufficiently
demonstrated that the Scriptures employ these expressions and others of
a similar character not of the Son, but of the so-called gods who were
not really so.  I have shewn this from the fact that in both the Old and
the New Testament the son is frequently styled both God and Lord.  David
makes this still clearer when he says, ‘Who is like unto Thee?’ <span
id="fr_461"></span>[462](#fn_461.md) and adds, ‘among the gods, O Lord,’
and Moses, in the words, ‘So the Lord alone did lead them, and there was
no strange god with him.’ <span id="fr_462"></span>[463](#fn_462.md)   And
yet although, as the Apostle says, the Saviour was with them, ‘They
drank of that spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was
Christ,’ <span id="fr_463"></span>[464](#fn_463.md) and Jeremiah, ‘The gods
that have not made the heavens and the earth,…let them perish under the
heavens.’ <span id="fr_464"></span>[465](#fn_464.md)   The Son is not meant
among these, for He is himself Creator of all.  It is then the idols and
images of the heathen who are meant alike by the preceding passage and
by the words, ‘I am the first God and I am the last, and beside me there
is no God,’ <span id="fr_465"></span>[466](#fn_465.md) and also, ‘Before me
there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me,’ <span
id="fr_466"></span>[467](#fn_466.md) and ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God
is one Lord.’ <span id="fr_467"></span>[468](#fn_467.md)   None of these
passages must be understood as referring to the Son.”

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p220"></span>The Fifth Book against Eunomius is on
the Holy Spirit, and therefore, even if it were of indubitable
genuineness, it would be of comparatively little importance, as the
subject is fully discussed in the treatise of his mature life.  A reason
advanced against its genuineness has been the use concerning the Holy
Ghost of the term God.  (§ 3.)  But it has been replied that the reserve
which St. Basil practiced after his elevation to the episcopate was but
for a special and temporary purpose.  He calls the Spirit God in Ep.
VIII. §11.  At the time of the publication of the Books against Eunomius
there would be no such reason for any “economy” <span
id="fr_468"></span>[469](#fn_468.md) as in 374.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p222"></span>(ii)  *De Spiritu Sancto*.  To the
illustration and elucidation of this work I have little to add to what
is furnished, however inadequately, by the translation and notes in the
following pages.  The famous treatise of St. Basil was one of several
put out about the same time by the champions of the Catholic cause. 
Amphilochius, to whom it was <span id="page_xliv">p. xliv</span> <span
id="vi.ii.ii-Page_xliv"></span>addressed, was the author of a work which
Jerome describes (*De Vir. Ill*., cxxxiii.) as arguing that He is God
Almighty, and to be worshipped.  The *Ancoratus* of Epiphanius was
issued in 373 in support of the same doctrine.  At about the same time
Didymus, the blind master of the catechetical school at Alexandria,
wrote a treatise which is extant in St. Jerome’s Latin; and of which the
work of St. Ambrose, composed in 381, for the Emperor Gratian, is “to a
considerable extent an echo.” <span id="fr_469"></span>[470](#fn_469.md)

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p224"></span>So in East and West a vigorous defence
was maintained against the Macedonian assault.  The Catholic position is
exactly defined in the Synodical Letter sent by Damasus to Paulinus of
Tyre in 378. <span id="fr_470"></span>[471](#fn_470.md)   Basil died at the
crisis of the campaign, and with no bright Pisgah view of the ultimate
passage into peace.  The generalship was to pass into other hands. 
There is something of the irony of fate, or of the mystery of
Providence, in the fact that the voice condemned by Basil to struggle
against the mean din and rattle of Sasima should be the vehicle for
impressing on the empire the truths which Basil held dear.  Gregory of
Sasima was no archiepiscopal success at Constantinople.  He was not an
administrator or a man of the world.  But he was a great divine and
orator, and the imperial basilica of the Athanasia rang with outspoken
declarations of the same doctrines, which Basil had more cautiously
suggested to inevitable inference.  The triumph was assured, Gregory was
enthroned in St. Sophia, and under Theodosius the Catholic Faith was
safe from molestation.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p98"></span> It will be noted that Basil explains
this passage on different grounds from those suggested by the Clause in
the Athanasian Creed, on which Waterland’s remark is that it “needs no
comment.”  St. Athanasius himself interpreted the “minority” not of the
humanity, or of the special subordination of the time when the words
were uttered.  *cf*. Ath., *Orat. c. Ar*. i. § 58:  “The Son says not
‘my Father is better than I,’ lest we should conceive Him to be foreign
to His nature, but ‘greater,’ not indeed in size, nor in time, but
because of His generation from the Father Himself; nay, in saying
‘greater,’ He again shews that He is proper to His essence” (Newman’s
transl.).  The explanation given in *Letter* viii., p. 118, does include
the inferiority as touching His manhood.

in hunc mundum venit, imo antequam etiam naturam humanam assumeret, cum
patriarchæ et Judæi prisci ad salutem consequendam in Christum venturum
credere necesse habuerint.  Itaque cum debeamus necessario credere in
Filium omni ætate et tempore; hinc efficitur, Filium esse natura, non

the word <span class="Greek"><span

arguments alleged against its genuineness, for in Book. II., Capp. 6, 7,

it apparently without objection in the sentence <span

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p152"></span> The English word *firstborn* is not an
exact rendering of the Greek <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.ii-p152.1"></span>πρωτότοκος</span>, and in its theological
use it may lead to confusion.  “Bear” and its correlatives in English
are only used of the mother.  <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.ii-p152.2"></span>τίκτω</span> (¶TEK. *cf*. Ger. *Zeug*.) is
used indifferently of both father and mother.  <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.ii-p152.3"></span>πρωτότοκος</span> is exactly rendered
*firstborn* in [Luke ii. 7](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#007.md)<span
id="vi.ii.ii-p152.4"></span>; but *first begotten*, as in A.V. [Heb. i.
6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006.md)<span id="vi.ii.ii-p152.5"></span>,
and [Rev. i. 5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md)<span
id="vi.ii.ii-p152.6"></span>, more precisely renders the word in the
text, and in such passages as [Ex. xiii.

and [Psalm lxxxix. 28](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#028.md)<span
id="vi.ii.ii-p152.8"></span>, which are Messianically applied to the
divine Word.  So early as Clemens Alexandrinus the *only begotten* and
*first begotten* had been contrasted with the *first created*, and
highest order of created being.  With him may be compared Tertullian,
*Adv. Prax*. 7, *Adv. Marc*. v. 19, Hippolytus, *Hær*. x. 33, Origen,
*C. Cels*. vi. 47, 63, 64, *In Ioann*. 1, § 22 (iv. p. 21), xix. § 5 (p.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p158"></span> Jerome’s *Tract on the Perpetual
Virginity of the Blessed Virgin* appeared about 383, and was written at
Rome in the episcopate of Damasus (363–384).  The work of Helvidius
which Jerome controverted was not published till about 380, and there
can be no reference to him in the passage in the text.  Basil is
contending against the general Arian inference, rather than against any
individual statement  as to who the “Brethren of the Lord” were.  *cf*.
also dub. *Hom. in Sanct. Christ. Gen*. p. 600. Ed. Garn.  On the whole
subject see Bp. Lightfoot, in his *Ep. to the Galatians*, E. S. Ffoulkes
in *D.C.B. s.v*. Helvidius, and Archdeacon Farrar in his *Life of
Christ*, chap. vii., who warmly supports the Helvidian theory in
opposition to the almost universal belief of the early Church.  Basil
evidently has no more idea that the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.ii-p158.1"></span>ἕ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.ii-p158.2"></span>ως οὗ</span> of [Matt. i.
25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#025.md)<span id="vi.ii.ii-p158.3"></span>,
implies anything as to events subsequent to the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.ii-p158.4"></span>τόκος</span> than the
author of [2 Sam. 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#023.md)<span
id="vi.ii.ii-p158.5"></span>. had when he said that Michal had no child
till (LXX. <span class="Greek"><span

id="vi.ii.ii-p158.9"></span>χρις οὗ</span>) He had put all enemies under
His feet implied that He would not reign afterwards.  Too much
importance must not be given to niceties of usage in Hellenistic Greek,
but it is a well-known distinction in Attic Greek that <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.ii-p158.10"></span>πρίν</span> with the
infinitive is employed where the action is not asserted to take place,
while it is used with the indicative of a *past fact*.  Had St. Matthew
written <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.ii-p158.11"></span>πρίν
συνῆλθον</span>, the Helvidians might have laid still greater stress
than they did on the argument from [Matt. i.
18](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018.md)<span id="vi.ii.ii-p158.12"></span>,
which St. Jerome ridicules.  His writing <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.ii-p158.13"></span>πρὶν ἢ συνελθεῖν</span> is what might have
been expected if he wished simply to assert that the conception was not
preceded by any cohabitation.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p200"></span> I do not here render with the Arian
gloss of A.V., infelicitously reproduced in the equally inexact
translation of R.V.  The insertion of the words “it shall be given” and
“it is” is apparently due to a pedantic prejudice against translating
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.ii-p200.1"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.ii-p200.2"></span>λλά</span> by “save” or
“except,” a rendering which is supported in classical Greek by such a
passage as Soph., *O.T*. 1331, and in Hellenistic Greek by [Mark ix.
8](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#008.md)<span id="vi.ii.ii-p200.3"></span>. 
The Vulgate has, quite correctly, “*non est meum dare vobis, sed quibus
paratum est a patre meo*,” so far as the preservation of the Son as the
giver is concerned.  A similar error is to be found in both the French
and German (Luther’s) of Bagster’s polyglot edition.  Wiclif has
correctly, “is not myn to geve to you but to whiche it is made redi of
my fadir.”  So Tyndale, “is not myne to geve but to them for whom it is
prepared of my father.”  The gloss begins with Cranmer (1539), “it shall
chance unto them that it is prepared for,” and first appears in the
Geneva of 1557 as the A.V. has perpetuated it.  The Rheims follows the
*vobis* of the Vulgate, but is otherwise correct.  *cf*. note on
Theodoret in this edition, p. 169.

however, by no means a mere copy; and other writers besides Didymus are
laid under contribution in the argument; *e.g.* St. Basil and perhaps
St. Athanasius.”
