<span id="ix.cclxxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cclxxxiv-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLXXXIII. <span
id="fr_3241"></span>[3242](#fn_3241.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxxxiv-p3"></span>To a widow.

<span id="ix.cclxxxiv-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxxxiv-p4.1"></span>I hope</span> to find a suitable day for
the conference, after those which I intend to fix for the hill-country. 
I see no opportunity for our meeting (unless the Lord so order it beyond
my expectation), other than at a public conference.

<span id="ix.cclxxxiv-p5"></span>You may imagine my position from your
own experience.  If in the care of a single household you are beset with
such a crowd of anxieties, how many distractions, think you, each day
brings to me?

<span id="ix.cclxxxiv-p6"></span>Your dream, I think, reveals more
perfectly the necessity of making provision for spiritual contemplation,
and cultivating that mental vision by which God is wont to be seen. 
Enjoying as you do the consolation of the Holy Scriptures, you stand in
need neither of my assistance nor of that of anybody else to help you to
comprehend your duty.  You have the all-sufficient counsel and guidance
of the Holy Spirit to lead you to what is right.
