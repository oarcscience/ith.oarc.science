<p class="c20"><a name="ix.cxxx-p5"></A>1.&#160; I <span class="c14"><a name="ix.cxxx-p5.1"></A>knew</span> that the charge which had lately sprung up against the loquacious Apollinarius would sound strange in the ears of your excellency.&#160; I did not know myself, till now, that he was accused; at the present time, however, the Sebastenes, after search in some quarter or another, have brought these things forward, and they are carrying about a document for which they are specially trying to condemn me on the ground that I hold the same sentiments.&#160; It contains the following phrases.&#160; &#8220;Wherefore it is everywhere necessary to understand the first identity in conjunction with, or rather in union with, the second, and to say that the second and the third are the same.&#160; For what the Father is firstly, the Son is secondly, and the Spirit thirdly.&#160; And, again, what the Spirit is firstly, the Son is secondly, in so far as the Spirit is the Lord; and the Father thirdly, in so far as the Spirit is God.&#160; And, to express the ineffable with greatest force, the Father is Son in a paternal sense, and the Son Father in a filial sense, and so in the case of the Spirit, in so far as the Trinity is one God.&#8221;&#160; This is what is being bruited about.&#160; I never can believe it to have been invented by those through whom it has been published, although, after their slanders against me, I can regard nothing as beyond their audacity.&#160; For writing to some of their party, they advanced their false accusation against me, and then added the words I have quoted, describing them as the work of heretics, but saying nothing as to the author of the document, in order that it might vulgarly be supposed to have come from my pen.&#160; Nevertheless, in my opinion, their intelligence would not have gone far enough in putting the phrases together.&#160; On this account, in order to repudiate the growing <A NAME="page_198"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 198</FONT></A> <a name="ix.cxxx-Page_198"></A>blasphemy against myself, and shew to all the world that I have nothing in common with those who make such statements, I have been compelled to mention Apollinarius as approximating to the impiety of Sabellius.&#160; Of this subject I will say no more.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.cxxx-p6"></A>2.&#160; I have received a message from the court that, after the first impulse of the Emperor, to which he was impelled by my calumniators, a second decree has been passed, that I am not to be delivered to my accusers, nor given over to their will, as was ordered at the beginning; but that there has been in the meanwhile some delay.&#160; If then this obtains, or any gentler measure is determined on, I will let you know.&#160; If the former prevails, it shall not be so, without your knowledge.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.cxxx-p7"></A>3.&#160; Our brother Sanctissimus has certainly been with you a long time, and you have learnt the objects he has in view.&#160; If, then, the letter to the Westerns seems to you to contain at all what is requisite, be so good as to have it written out and conveyed to me, that I may get it signed by those who think with us, and may keep the subscription ready, and written out on a separate paper, which we can fasten on to the letter which is being carried about by our brother and fellow presbyter.&#160; As I did not find in the minute anything conclusive, I was in a difficulty on what point to write to the Westerns.&#160; Necessary points are anticipated, and it is useless to write what is superfluous, and on such points would it not be ridiculous to show feeling?&#160; One subject, however, did appear to me to be hitherto untouched, and to suggest a reason for writing, and that was an exhortation to them not indiscriminately to accept the communion of men coming from the East; but, after once choosing one side, to receive the rest on the testimony of their fellows, and not to assent to every one writing a form of creed on the pretext of orthodoxy.&#160; If they do so, they will be found in communion with men at war with one another, who often put forward the same formul&aelig;, and yet battle vehemently against one another, as those who are most widely separated.&#160; To the end, then, that the heresy may not be the more widely kindled, while those who are at variance with one another mutually object to their own formul&aelig;, they ought to be exhorted to make a distinction between the acts of communion which are brought them by chance comers, and those which are duly drawn up according to the rule of the Church.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2428"></A><A HREF="#fn_2428"><FONT SIZE="1">2429</FONT></A>
