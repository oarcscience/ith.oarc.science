<span id="ix.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.xvi-p1.1"></span>Letter XV. <span
id="fr_1896"></span>[1897](#fn_1896.md) </span>

<span id="ix.xvi-p3"></span>*To Arcadius, Imperial Treasurer*. <span
id="fr_1897"></span>[1898](#fn_1897.md)

<span id="ix.xvi-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xvi-p5.1"></span>The</span> townsmen of our metropolis have
conferred on me a greater favour than they have received, in giving me
an opportunity of writing to your excellency.  The kindness, to win
which they have received this letter from me, was assured them even
before I wrote, on account of your wonted and inborn courtesy to all. 
But I have considered it a very great advantage to have the opportunity
of addressing your excellency, praying to the holy God that I may
continue to rejoice, and share in the pleasure of the recipients of your
bounty, while you please Him more and more, and while the splendour of
your high place continues to increase.  I pray that in due time I may
with joy once more welcome those who are delivering this my letter into
your hands, <span id="fr_1898"></span>[1899](#fn_1898.md) and send them
forth praising, as do many, your considerate treatment of them, and I
trust that they will have found my recommendation of them not without
use in approaching your exalted excellency.

<span id="ix.xvi-p6"></span> There is confusion here in the text, and
the Benedictines think it unmanageable as it stands.  But the matter is
of no importance.
