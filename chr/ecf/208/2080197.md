<span id="ix.cxxv-p3"></span>*To Theodorus*.

<span id="ix.cxxv-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxxv-p4.1"></span>It</span> is sometimes said that slaves to the
passion of love, when by some inevitable necessity they are separated
from the object of their desire, are able to stay the violence of their
passion by indulging the sense of sight, if haply they can look at the
picture of the beloved object.  Whether this be true or not I cannot
say; but what has befallen me in your case, my friend, is not very
different.  I have felt a disposition towards your godly and guileless
soul, somewhat, if I may so say, of the nature of love; but the
gratification of my desire, like that of all other blessings, is made
difficult to me by the opposition of my sins.  However, I have seemed to
see a very good likeness of you in the presence of my very reverend
brothers.  And if it had been my lot to fall in with you when far away
from them, I should have fancied that I saw them in you.  For the
measure of love in each of you is so great, that in both of you there is
a plain contest for the superiority.  I have thanked God for this.  If
any longer life be left me, I pray that my life may be made sweet
through you, just as now I look on life as a wretched thing to be
avoided, because I am separated from the companionship of those I love
best.  For, in my judgment, there is nothing in which one can be
cheerful when cut off from those who truly love us.
