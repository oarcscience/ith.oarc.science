id="ix.cclxxxi-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLXXX. <span
id="fr_3238"></span>[3239](#fn_3238.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxxxi-p3"></span>To Modestus the Prefect.

<span id="ix.cclxxxi-p4"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxxxi-p4.1"></span>feel</span> my boldness in pressing my suit
by letter upon a man in your position; still the honour that you have
paid me in the past has banished all my scruples.  Accordingly I write
with confidence.

<span id="ix.cclxxxi-p5"></span>My plea is for a relative of mine, a man
worthy of respect for his integrity.  He is the bearer of this letter,
and he stands to me in the place of a son.  Your favour is all that he
requires for the fulfilment of his wishes.  Deign therefore to receive,
at the hands of the aforesaid bearer, my letter in furtherance of his
plea.  I pray you to give him an opportunity of explaining his affairs
at an interview with those in a position to help him.  So by your
direction shall he quickly obtain his desires; while I shall have
occasion for boasting that by God’s favour I have found a champion who
regards the entreaties of my friends as personal claims to his
protection.
