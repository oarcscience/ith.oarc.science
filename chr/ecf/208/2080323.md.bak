<span id="ix.ccli-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ccli-p1.1"></span>Letter CCL. <span
id="fr_3092"></span>[3093](#fn_3092.md) </span>

<span id="ix.ccli-p3"></span>To Patrophilus, bishop of Ægæ.

<span id="ix.ccli-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccli-p4.1"></span>There</span> has been some delay in my
receiving your answer to my former letter; but it has reached me through
the well-beloved Strategius, and I have given thanks to the Lord for
your continuance in your love to me.  What you have now been kind enough
to write on the same subject proves your good intentions, for you think
as you ought, and you counsel me to my gain.  But I see that my words
will be extending too far, if I am to reply to everything written to me
by your excellency.  I therefore say no more than this, that, if the
blessing of peace goes no further than the mere name of peace, it is
ridiculous to go on picking out here one and there another, and allow
them alone a share in the boon, while others beyond number are excluded
from it.  But if agreement with mischievous men, under the appearance of
peace, really does the harm an enemy might do to all who consent to it,
then only consider who those men are who have been admitted to their
companionship, who have conceived an unrighteous hatred against me; who
but men of the faction not in communion with me.  There is no need now
for me to mention them by name.  They have been invited by them to
Sebasteia; they have assumed the charge of the Church; they have
performed service at the altar:  they have given of their own bread to
all the people, being proclaimed bishops by the clergy there, and
escorted through all the district as saints and in communion.  If one
must adopt the faction of these men, it is absurd to begin at the
extremities, and not rather to hold intercourse with those that are
their heads. <span id="fr_3093"></span>[3094](#fn_3093.md)   If then we are
to count heretic and shun no one at all, why, tell me, do you separate
yourself from the communion of certain persons?  But if any are to be
shunned, let me be told by these people who are so logically consistent
in everything, to what party those belong whom they have invited over
from Galatia to join them?  If such things seem grievous to you, charge
the separation on those who are responsible for it.  If you judge them
to be of no importance, forgive me for declining to be of the leaven of
the teachers of wrong doctrine. <span
id="fr_3094"></span>[3095](#fn_3094.md)   Wherefore, if you will, have no
more to do with those specious arguments, but with all <span
id="page_291">p. 291</span> <span id="ix.ccli-Page_291"></span>openness
confute them that do not walk aright in the truth of the Gospel.
