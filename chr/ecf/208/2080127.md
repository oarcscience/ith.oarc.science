<span id="ix.lv-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.lv-p1.1"></span>Letter LIV. <span
id="fr_2198"></span>[2199](#fn_2198.md) </span>

<span id="ix.lv-p3"></span>*To the Chorepiscopi*.

<span id="ix.lv-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lv-p4.1"></span>I am</span> much distressed that the canons of
the Fathers have fallen through, and that the exact discipline of the
Church has been banished from among you.  I am apprehensive lest, as
this indifference grows, the affairs of the Church should, little by
little, fall into confusion.  According to the ancient custom observed
in the Churches of God, ministers in the Church were received after
careful examination; the whole of their life was investigated; an
enquiry was made as to their being neither railers nor drunkards, not
quick to quarrel, keeping their youth in subjection, so as to be able to
maintain “the holiness without which no man shall see the Lord.” <span
id="fr_2199"></span>[2200](#fn_2199.md)   This examination was made by
presbyters and deacons living with them.  Then they brought them to the
Chorepiscopi; and the Chorepiscopi, after receiving the suffrages of the
witnesses as to the truth and giving information to the Bishop, so
admitted the minister to the sacerdotal order. <span
id="fr_2200"></span>[2201](#fn_2200.md)   Now, however, you have quite
passed me over; you have not even had the grace to refer to me, and have
transferred the whole authority to yourselves.  Furthermore, with
complete indifference, you have allowed presbyters and deacons to
introduce unworthy persons into the Church, just any one they choose,
without any previous examination of life and character, by mere
favoritism, on the score of relationship or some other tie.  The
consequence is, that in every village, there are reckoned many
ministers, but not one single man worthy of the service of the altars. 
Of this you yourselves supply proof from your difficulty in finding
suitable candidates for election.  As, then, I perceive that the evil is
gradually reaching a point at which it would be incurable, and
especially at this moment when a large number of persons are presenting
themselves for the ministry through fear of the conscription, I am
constrained to have recourse to the restitution of the canons of the
Fathers.  I thus order you in writing to send me the roll of the
ministers in every village, stating by whom each has been introduced,
and what is his mode of life.  You have the roll in your own keeping, so
that your version can be compared with the documents which are in mine,
and no one can insert his own name when he likes.  So if any have been
introduced by presbyters after the first appointment, <span
id="fr_2201"></span>[2202](#fn_2201.md) let <span id="page_158">p.
158</span> <span id="ix.lv-Page_158"></span>them be rejected, and take
their place among the laity.  Their examination must then be begun by
you over again, and, if they prove worthy, let them be received by your
decision.  Drive out unworthy men from the Church, and so purge it.  For
the future, test by examination those who are worthy, and then receive
them; but do not reckon them of the number before you have reported to
me.  Otherwise, distinctly understand that he who is admitted to the
ministry without my authority will remain a layman.

*On the Council of Nicæa*, i. 23.  *Ordo*, the nearest Latin equivalent
to the Greek <span class="Greek"><span

in the church, *e.g.* St. Jerome, *On Isaiah* v. 19, 18.

<span id="ix.lv-p8"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.lv-p8.1"></span>μετὰ τὴν πρώτην ἐπινέμησιν.  ᾽Επινέμησις</span>
is in later Greek the recognized equivalent for “*indictio*” in the
sense of a period of fifteen years (*Cod. Theod*. xi. 28. 3).  I have
had some hesitation as to whether it could possibly in this passage
indicate a date.  But <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.lv-p8.2"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.lv-p8.3"></span>πινέμησις</span> does not appear to have been
used in its chronological sense before Evagrius, and his expression (iv.
29) <span class="Greek"><span id="ix.lv-p8.4"></span>τοὺς περιόδους τῶν
κύκλων καλουμένων ἐπινεμήσεων</span> looks as though the term were not
yet common; <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.lv-p8.5"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.lv-p8.6"></span>πινέμησις</span> here I take to refer to the
assignment of presbyters to different places on ordination.  I am
indebted to Mr. J. W. Parker for valuable information and suggestions on
this question.
