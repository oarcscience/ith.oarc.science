<span id="ix.ccvi-p3"></span>*To Elpidius the bishop*. <span

<span id="ix.ccvi-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccvi-p5.1"></span>Once</span> again I have started the
well-beloved presbyter Meletius to carry my greeting to you.  I had
positively determined to spare him, on account of the weakness which he
<span id="page_246">p. 246</span> <span id="ix.ccvi-Page_246"></span>has
voluntarily brought upon himself, by bringing his body into subjection
for the sake of the gospel of Christ.  But I have judged it fitting to
salute you by the ministry of such men as he is, able to supply of
themselves all the shortcomings of my letter, and to become, alike to
writer and recipient, a kind of living epistle.  I am also carrying out
the very strong wish, which he has always had, to see your excellency,
ever since he has had experience of the high qualities you possess.  So
now I have besought him to travel to you, and through him I discharge
the debt of the visit I owe you, and beseech you to pray for me and for
the Church of God, that the Lord may grant me deliverance from the
injuries of the enemies of the Gospel, and to pass my life in peace and
quiet.  Nevertheless, if you in your wisdom, think it needful that we
should travel to the same spot, and meet the rest of our right
honourable brother bishops of the sea board regions, do you yourself
point out a suitable place and time where and when this meeting may take
place.  Write to our brethren to the end that each and all may, at the
appointed time, leave the business they may have in hand, and may be
able to effect something for the edification of the Churches of God, do
away with the pain which we now suffer from our mutual suspicions, and
establish love, without which the Lord Himself has ordained that
obedience to every commandment must be of none effect.

friendly relations with Basil, and therefore was not in communion with
Eustathius of Sebaste.  (*Letter* ccli.)
