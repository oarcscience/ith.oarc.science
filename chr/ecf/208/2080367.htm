<p class="c54"><a name="ix.ccxcv-p2"></A>To Festus and Magnus.</p>  
<p class="c20"><a name="ix.ccxcv-p3"></A><span class="c14"><a name="ix.ccxcv-p3.1"></A>It</span> is doubtless a father&#146;s duty to make provision for his children; a husbandman&#146;s to tend his plants and crops; a teacher&#146;s to bestow care upon his pupils, especially when, innate goodness shews signs of promise for them.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.ccxcv-p4"></A>The husbandman finds toil a pleasure when he sees the ears ripen or the plants increase; the teacher is gladdened at his pupils&#146; growth in knowledge, the father at his son&#146;s in stature.&#160; But greater is the care I feel for you; higher the hopes I entertain; in proportion as piety is more excellent than all the arts, than all the animals and fruits together.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.ccxcv-p5"></A>And piety I planted in your heart while still pure and tender, and I matured it in the hopes of seeing it reach maturity and bearing fruits in due season.&#160; My prayers meanwhile were furthered by your love of learning.&#160; And you know well that you have my good wishes, and that God&#146;s favour rests upon your endeavours; for when rightly directed, called or uncalled, God is at hand to further them.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.ccxcv-p6"></A>Now every man that loves God is prone to teaching; nay, where there is the power to teach things profitable, their eagerness is well nigh uncontrollable; but first their hearers&#146; minds must be cleared of all resistance.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.ccxcv-p7"></A>Not that separation in the body is a hindrance to instruction.&#160; The Creator, in the fulness of His love and wisdom, did not confine our minds within our bodies, nor the power of speaking to our tongues.&#160; Ability to profit derives some advantage even from lapse of time; thus we are able to transmit instruction, not only to those who are dwelling far away, but even to those who are hereafter to be born.&#160; And experience proves my words:&#160; those who lived many years before teach posterity by instruction preserved in their writings; and we, though so far separated in the body, are always near in thought, and converse together with ease.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.ccxcv-p8"></A>Instruction is bounded neither by sea nor land, if only we have a care for our souls&#146; profit.</p>
