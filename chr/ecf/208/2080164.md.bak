<span id="ix.xcii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.xcii-p1.1"></span>Letter XCI. <span
id="fr_2304"></span>[2305](#fn_2304.md) </span>

<span id="ix.xcii-p3"></span>*To Valerianus, Bishop of Illyricum*. <span
id="fr_2305"></span>[2306](#fn_2305.md)

<span id="ix.xcii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xcii-p5.1"></span>Thanks</span> be to the Lord, Who has permitted
me to see in your unstained life the fruit of primitive love.  Far apart
as you are in body, you have united yourself to me by writing; you have
embraced me with spiritual and holy longing; you have implanted
unspeakable affection in my soul.  Now I have realized the force of the
proverb, “As cold water is to a thirsty soul so is good news from a far
country.” <span id="fr_2306"></span>[2307](#fn_2306.md)   Honoured brother,
I really hunger for affection.  The cause is not far to seek, for
iniquity is multiplied and the love of many has grown cold. <span
id="fr_2307"></span>[2308](#fn_2307.md)   For this reason your letter is
precious to me, and I am replying by our reverend brother Sabinus.  By
him I make myself known to you, and beseech you to be watchful in
prayers on our behalf, that God may one day grant calm and quiet to the
Church here, and rebuke this wind and sea, that so we may be freed from
the storm and agitation in which we are now every moment expecting to be
submerged.  But in these our troubles one great boon has God given us in
hearing that you are in exact agreement and unity with one another, and
that the doctrines of true religion are preached among you without let
or hindrance.  For at some time or other, unless the period of this
world is not already concluded, and if there yet remain days of human
life, it must needs be that by your means the faith must be renewed in
the East and that in due season you recompense her for the blessings
which she has given you.  The sound part among us here, which preserves
the true religion of the Fathers, is sore stricken, and the devil in his
wiliness has shattered it by many and various subtle assaults.  But, by
the help of the prayers of you who love the Lord, may the wicked and
deceitful heresy of the Arian error be quenched; may the good teaching
of the Fathers, who met at Nicæa, shine forth; so that the ascription of
glory may be rendered to the blessed Trinity in the terms of the baptism
of salvation.

of Aquileia, was present at the Synod held in Rome in 371 (Theodoret,
*Hist. Ecc*. ii. 2.) and also at the Synod in the same city in 382. 
(Theod. *Ecc. Hist*. v. 9, where see note.)  Dorotheus or Sabinus had
brought letters from Athanasius and at the same time a letter from
Valerianus.  Basil takes the opportunity to reply.
