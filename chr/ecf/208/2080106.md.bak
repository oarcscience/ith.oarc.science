id="ix.xxxiv-p5.1"></span>Who</span> knows so well as you do how to
respect an old friendship, to pay reverence to virtue, and to sympathise
with the sick?  Now my God-beloved brother Gregory the bishop has become
involved in matters which would be under any circumstances disagreeable,
and are quite foreign to his bent of mind.  I have therefore thought it
best to throw myself on your protection, and to endeavour to obtain from
you some solution of our difficulties.  It is really an intolerable
state of things that one who is neither by nature nor inclination
adapted for anything of the kind should be compelled to be thus
responsible; that demands for money should be made on a poor man; and
that one who has long determined to pass his life in retirement should
be dragged into publicity.  It would depend upon your wise counsel
whether you think it of any use to address the Comes Thesaurorum or any
other persons.

clxxviii., ccciv., and also cxcvi., though the last is also attributed
to Greg. Naz.  He was an important lay compatriot of Basil.  Tillemont
was of opinion that the dear brother Gregory referred to in this letter
is Gregory of Nyssa; but Maran points out that the events referred to
are the same as those described in *Letter* xxxii., and supposes the
word *episcopus* to have been inserted by a commentator.
