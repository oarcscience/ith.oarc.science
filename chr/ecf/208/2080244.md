<span id="ix.clxxii-p3"></span>*To Gregory*.

<span id="ix.clxxii-p4"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxxii-p4.1"></span>wrote</span> to you, not long ago, about
Glycerius and the virgins.  Even now they have not returned, but are
still hesitating, how and why I know not.  I should be sorry to charge
this against you, as though you were acting thus to bring discredit on
me, either because you have some ground of complaint against me, or to
gratify others.  Let them then come, fearing nothing.  Do you be surety
for their doing this.  For it pains me to have my members cut off,
although they have been rightly cut off.  If they hold out the burden
will rest on others.  I wash my hands of it.
