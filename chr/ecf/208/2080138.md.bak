privileges to which my superior age entitles me, and wait for you to
take the initiative in communica<span id="page_163">p. 163</span> <span

adhere more persistently to your evil counsel of inaction, what end will
there be to our silence?  However, where friendship is involved, to be
defeated is in my opinion to win, and so I am quite ready to gave you
precedence, and retire from the contest as to which should maintain his
own opinion.  I have been the first to betake myself to writing, because
I know that “charity beareth all things…endureth all things…seeketh not
her own” and so “never faileth.” <span
id="fr_2233"></span>[2234](#fn_2233.md)   He who subjects himself to his
neighbour in love can never be humiliated.  I do beg you, then, at all
events for the future, show the first and greatest fruit of the Spirit,
Love; <span id="fr_2234"></span>[2235](#fn_2234.md) away with the angry
man’s sullenness which you are showing me by your silence, and recover
joy in your heart, peace with the brothers who are of one mind with you,
and zeal and anxiety for the continued safety of the Churches of the
Lord.  If I were not to make as strenuous efforts on behalf of the
Churches as the opponents of sound doctrine make to subvert and utterly
destroy them, you may be quite sure that there is nothing to prevent the
truth from being swept away and destroyed by its enemies, and my being
involved in the condemnation, for not shewing all possible anxiety for
the unity of the Churches, with all zeal and eagerness in mutual
unanimity and godly agreement.  I exhort you then, drive out of your
mind the idea that you need communion with no one else.  To cut one’s
self off from connexion with the brethren is not the mark of one who is
walking by love, nor yet the fulfilling of the commandment of Christ. 
At the same time I do wish you, with all your good intentions, to take
into account that the calamities of the war which are now all round
about us <span id="fr_2235"></span>[2236](#fn_2235.md) may one day be at
our own doors, and if we too, like all the rest, have our share of
outrage, we shall not find any even to sympathise with us, because in
the hour of our prosperity we refused to give our share of sympathy to
the wronged.

<span id="ix.lxvi-p2"></span> Placed about 371, or, at all events,
according to Maran, before the year 373, when the ill will of Atarbius
towards Basil was violently manifested.

id="ix.lxvi-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxvi-p4"></span> Atarbius is recognised as bishop of
Neocæsarea, partly on the evidence of the Codices Coislinanus and
Medicæus, which describe him as of Neocæsarea, partly on a comparison of
*Letters* lxv. and cxxvi., addressed to him, with the circumstances of
the unnamed bishop of Neocæsarea referred to in *Letter* ccx.  Moreover
(*cf*. Bp. Lightfoot, D.C.B. i. 179) at the Council of Constantinople he
represented the province of Pontus Polemoniacus, of which Neocæsarea was
metropolis.  On the authority of an allusion in *Letter* ccx. sec. 4,
Atarbius is supposed to be a kinsman of Basil.
