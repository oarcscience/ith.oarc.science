id="ix.cxcvi-p1.1"></span>Letter CXCV. <span
id="fr_2681"></span>[2682](#fn_2681.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cxcvi-p3"></span>*To Euphronius, bishop of Colonia
Armeniæ*.

<span id="ix.cxcvi-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxcvi-p4.1"></span>Colonia</span>, which the Lord has placed
under your authority, is far out of the way of ordinary routes.  The
consequence is that, although I am frequently writing to the rest of the
brethren in Armenia Minor, I hesitate to write to your reverence,
because I have no expectation of finding any one to convey my letter. 
Now, however, that I am hoping either for your presence, or that my
letter will be sent on to you by some of the bishops to whom I have
written, I thus write and salute you by letter.  I wish to tell you that
I seem to be still alive, and at the same time to exhort you to pray for
me, that the Lord may lessen my afflictions, and lift from me the heavy
load of pain which now presses like a cloud upon my heart.  I shall have
this relief if He will only grant a quick restoration to those godly
bishops who are now punished for their faithfulness to true religion by
being scattered all abroad.
