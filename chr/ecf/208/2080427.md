<span id="ix.ccclv-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ccclv-p1.1"></span>Letter CCCLX. <span
id="fr_3288"></span>[3289](#fn_3288.md) </span>

<span id="ix.ccclv-p3"></span>Of the Holy Trinity, the Incarnation, the
invocation of Saints, and their Images.

<span id="ix.ccclv-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccclv-p4.1"></span>According</span> to the blameless faith of the
Christians which we have obtained from God, I confess and agree that I
believe in one God the Father Almighty; God the Father, God the Son, God
the Holy Ghost; I adore and worship one God, the Three. <span
id="fr_3289"></span>[3290](#fn_3289.md)   I confess to the œconomy of the
Son in the flesh, <span id="fr_3290"></span>[3291](#fn_3290.md) and that
the holy Mary, who gave birth to Him according to the flesh, was Mother
of God. <span id="fr_3291"></span>[3292](#fn_3291.md)   I acknowledge also
the holy apostles, prophets, and martyrs; and I invoke them to
supplication to God, that through them, that is, through their
mediation, the merciful God may be propitious to me, and that a ransom
may be made and given me for my sins.  Wherefore also I honour and kiss
the features of their images, inasmuch as they have been handed down
from the holy apostles, and are not forbidden, but are in all our
churches.

id="ix.ccclv-p1.2"></span>

<span id="ix.ccclv-p2"></span> This letter is almost undoubtedly
spurious, but it has a certain interest, from the fact of its having
been quoted at the so-called 7th Council (2d of Nicæa) in 787.  Maran
(*Vit. Bas*. xxxix.) is of opinion that it is proved by internal
evidence to be the work of some Greek writer at the time of the
Iconoclastic controversy.  The vocabulary and style are unlike that of
Basil.

Nestorian controversy, which was after Basil’s time.
