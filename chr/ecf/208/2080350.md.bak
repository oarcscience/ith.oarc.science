id="ix.cclxxviii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLXXVII. <span
id="fr_3232"></span>[3233](#fn_3232.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxxviii-p3"></span>To the learned Maximus.

<span id="ix.cclxxviii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxxviii-p4.1"></span>The</span> excellent Theotecnus has given
mean account of your highness, whereby he has inspired me with a longing
for your acquaintance, so clearly do his words delineate the character
of your mind.  He has enkindled in me so ardent an affection for you,
that were it not that I am weighed down with age, that I am the victim
of a congenital ailment, that I am bound hand and foot by the numberless
cares of the Church, nothing would have hindered my coming to you.  For
indeed it is no small gain that a member of a great house, a man of
illustrious lineage, in adopting the life of the gospel, should bridle
the propensities of youth by reflection, and subject to reason the
affections of the flesh; should display a humility consistent with his
Christian profession, bethinking himself, as is his duty, whence he is
come and whither he is going.  For it is this consideration of our
nature that reduces the swelling of the mind, and banishes all
boastfulness and arrogance.  In a word it renders one a disciple of our
Lord, Who said, “Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.” <span
id="fr_3233"></span>[3234](#fn_3233.md)   And in truth, very dear son, the
only thing that deserves our exertions and praises is our everlasting
welfare; and this is the honour that comes from God.

<span id="ix.cclxxviii-p6"></span>Human affairs are fainter than a
shadow; more deceitful than a dream.  Youth fades more quickly than the
flowers of spring; our beauty wastes with age or sickness.  Riches are
uncertain; glory is fickle.  The pursuit of arts and sciences is bounded
by the present life; the charm of eloquence, which all covet, reaches
but the ear:  whereas the practice of virtue is a precious possession
for its owner, a delightful spectacle for all who witness it.  Make this
your study; so will you be worthy of the good things promised by the
Lord.

<span id="ix.cclxxviii-p7"></span>But a recital of the means whereby to
make the acquisition, and secure the enjoyment of these blessings, lies
beyond the intention of this present letter.  Thus much however, after
what I heard from my brother Theotecnus, it occurred to me to write to
you.  I pray that he may always speak the truth, especially in his
accounts of you; that the Lord may be the more glorified in you,
abounding as you do in the most precious fruits of piety, although
derived from a foreign root.
