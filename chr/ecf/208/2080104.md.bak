id="fr_2005"></span>[2006](#fn_2005.md) </span>

<span id="ix.xxxii-p3"></span>*To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata*.

<span id="ix.xxxii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xxxii-p4.1"></span>The</span> death is still with us, and I am
therefore compelled to remain where I am, partly by the duty of
distribution, and partly out of sympathy for the distressed.  Even now,
therefore, I have not been able to accompany our reverend brother
Hypatius, <span id="fr_2006"></span>[2007](#fn_2006.md) whom I am able to
style brother, not in mere conventional language, but on account of
relationship, for we are of one blood.  You know how ill he is.  It
distresses me to think that all hope of comfort is cut off for him, as
those who have the gifts of healing have not been allowed to apply their
usual remedies in his case.  Wherefore again he implores the aid of your
prayers.  Receive my entreaty that you will give him the usual
protection alike for your own sake, for you are always kind to the sick,
and for mine who am petitioning on his behalf.  If possible, summon to
your side the very holy brethren that he may be treated under your own
eyes.  If this be impossible, be so good as to send him on with a
letter, and recommend him to friends further on.
