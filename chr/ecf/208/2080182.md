id="ix.cx-p1.1"></span>Letter CIX. <span
id="fr_2371"></span>[2372](#fn_2371.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cx-p3"></span>*To the Count Helladius*.

<span id="ix.cx-p4"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cx-p4.1"></span>shrink</span> from troubling your good nature, on
account of the greatness of your influence, for fear of seeming to make
an unwarrantable use of your friendship; however, the necessity of the
case prevents my holding my peace.  Our sister, who is a relative of
mine, and now in the sorrowful position of a widow, has to look after
the affairs of her orphan boy.  On seeing her above measure oppressed by
intolerable responsibilities, I felt great compassion for her, and,
feeling deeply on the subject, I have hastened to invoke your aid, in
order that you may, if possible, deign to support the messenger whom she
has sent, to the end that when she has paid what she promised in person
in my presence, she may be freed from any further pressure.  She had
agreed that she should be relieved from the interest on payment of the
capital.  Now, however, those who are looking after the affairs of her
heirs are trying to exact the payment of the interest as well as that of
the capital.  The Lord, you know, makes the care of widows and orphans
His own, and so do you strive to use your best endeavours in this
matter, in the hope of the recompense which God Himself will give you. 
I cannot help thinking that, when our admirable and kindly prefect has
heard of the discharge of the capital, he will feel for this afflicted
and unhappy house now stricken to the knee, and no longer able to cope
with the injuries inflicted upon it.  Pardon, then, the necessity which
compels me to intrude upon you; and give your help <span
id="page_188">p. 188</span> <span id="ix.cx-Page_188"></span>in this
matter, in proportion to the power which Christ has given you, good and
true man as you are, and using your talents for the best.
