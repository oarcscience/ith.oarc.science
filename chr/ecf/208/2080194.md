id="ix.cxxii-p5.1"></span>The</span> winter is severe and protracted, so
that it is difficult for me even to have the solace of letters.  For
this reason I have written seldom to your reverence and seldom heard
from you, but now my beloved brother Sanctissimus, the co-presbyter, has
undertaken a journey as far as your city.  By him I salute your
lordship, and ask you to pray for me, and to give ear to Sanctissimus,
that from him you may learn in what situation the Churches are placed,
and may give all possible heed to the points put before you.  You must
know that Faustus came with letters for me, from the pope, requesting
that he might be ordained bishop.  When however I asked him for some
testimonial from yourself, and the rest of the bishops, he made light of
me and betook himself to Anthimus.  He came back, ordained by Anthimus,
without any communication having been made to me on the subject.
