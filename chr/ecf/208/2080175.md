<span id="ix.ciii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ciii-p1.1"></span>Letter CII. <span
id="fr_2356"></span>[2357](#fn_2356.md) </span>

<span id="ix.ciii-p3"></span>*To the citizens of Satala*. <span
id="fr_2357"></span>[2358](#fn_2357.md)

<span id="ix.ciii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ciii-p5.1"></span>Moved</span> by your importunity and that of
all your people, I have undertaken the charge of your Church, and have
promised before the Lord that I will be wanting to you in nothing which
is within my power.  So I have been compelled, as it is written, to
touch as it were the apple of my eye. <span
id="fr_2358"></span>[2359](#fn_2358.md)   Thus the high honour in which I
hold you has suffered me to remember neither relationship, nor the
intimacy which I have had from my boyhood with the person in question,
as making a stronger demand on me than your request.  I have forgotten
all the private considerations which made him near and dear to me,
making no account of the sighs which will be heaved by all my people on
being deprived of his rule, none of the tears of all his kindred; nor
have I taken to heart the affliction of his aged mother, who is
supported by his aid alone.  All these considerations, great and many as
they are, I have put aside, keeping only in view the one object of
giving your Church the blessing of the rule of such a man, and of aiding
her, now distressed as she is, at being so long without a head, and
needing great and powerful support to be enabled to rise again.  So much
for what concerns myself.  Now, on the other hand, I ask you not to fall
short of the hope which I have entertained and of the promises which I
have made him, that I have sent him to close friends.  I ask every one
of you to try to surpass the rest in love and affection to him.  I
entreat you to show this laudable rivalry, and to comfort his heart by
the greatness of your attentions to him, that he may forget his own
home, forget his kinsfolk, and forget a people so dependent on his rule,
like a child weaned from his mother’s breast.

<span id="ix.ciii-p7"></span>I have despatched Nicias beforehand to
explain everything to your excellencies, and that you may fix a day to
keep the feast and give thanks to the Lord, Who has granted the
fulfilment of your prayer. <span id="fr_2359"></span>[2360](#fn_2359.md)
