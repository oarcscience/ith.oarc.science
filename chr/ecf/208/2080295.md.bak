<span id="ix.ccxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ccxxiii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXXII. <span
id="fr_2871"></span>[2872](#fn_2871.md) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxxiii-p3"></span>*To the people of Chalcis*. <span
id="fr_2872"></span>[2873](#fn_2872.md)

<span id="ix.ccxxiii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxxiii-p5.1"></span>The</span> letter of your reverences came
upon me in an hour of affliction like water poured into the mouths of
racehorses, inhaling dust with each eager breath at high noontide in the
middle of the course.  Beset by trial after trial, I breathed again, at
once cheered by your words and invigorated by the thought of your
struggles to meet that which is before me with unflinching courage.  For
the conflagration which has devoured a great part of the East is already
advancing by slow degrees into our own neighbourhood, and after burning
everything round about us is trying to reach even the Churches in
Cappadocia, already moved to tears by the smoke that rises from the
ruins of our neighbours’ homes. <span
id="fr_2873"></span>[2874](#fn_2873.md)   The flames have almost reached
me.  May the Lord divert them by the breath of His mouth, and stay this
<span id="page_262">p. 262</span> <span
id="ix.ccxxiii-Page_262"></span>wicked fire.  Who is such a coward, so
unmanly, so untried in the athlete’s struggles, as not to be nerved to
the fight by your cheers, and pray to be hailed victor at your side? 
You have been the first to step into the arena of true religion; you
have beaten off many an attack in bouts with the heretics; you have
borne the strong hot wind <span id="fr_2874"></span>[2875](#fn_2874.md) of
trial, both you who are leaders of the Church, to whom has been the
ministry of the altar, and every individual of the laity, including
those of higher rank.  For this in you is specially admirable and worthy
of all praise, that you are all one in the Lord, some of you leaders in
the march to what is good, others willingly following.  It is for this
reason that you are too strong for the attack of your assailants, and
allow no hold to your antagonists in any one of your members, wherefore
day and night I pray the King of the ages to preserve the people in the
integrity of their faith, and for them to preserve the clergy, like a
head unharmed at the top, exercising its own watchful forethought for
every portion of the body underneath.  For while the eyes discharge
their functions, the hands can do their work as they ought, the feet can
move without tripping, and no part of the body is deprived of due care. 
I beseech you, then, to cling to one another, as you are doing and as
you will do.  I beseech you who are entrusted with the care of souls to
keep each and all together, and to cherish them like beloved children. 
I beseech the people to continue to show you the respect and honour due
to fathers, that in the goodly order of your Church you may keep your
strength and the foundation of your faith in Christ; that God’s name may
be glorified and the good gift of love increase and abound.  May I, as I
hear of you, rejoice in your progress in God.  If I am still bidden to
sojourn in the flesh in this world, may I one day see you in the peace
of God.  If I be now summoned to depart this life, may I see you in the
radiant glory of the saints, together with all them who are accounted
worthy through patience and showing forth of good works, with crowns
upon your heads.

Maran *Vit. Bas*. Chap. xxxiii. supposes this letter to have been
probably carried with *Letter* ccxxi. by Acacius.

<span id="ix.ccxxiii-p6"></span> Maran *Vit. Bas.* l. c. says that these
words cannot refer to the persecution of Valens in Cappadocia in 371,
for that persecution went on between Constantinople and Cappadocia, and
did not start from the East.  There need be no surprise, he thinks, at
the two preceding letters containing no mention of this persecution,
because Acacius, who was a native of Bera, would be sure to report all
that he had observed in Cappadocia.  I am not sure that the reference to
a kind of prairie fire spreading from the East does not rather imply a
prevalence of heresy than what is commonly meant by persecution. 
Meletius, however, was banished from Antioch in 374 and Eusebius from
Samosata in the same year, as graphically described by Theodoret *H.E.*
iv. 13.
