<span id="ix.clxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.clxxvi-p1.1"></span>Letter CLXXV. <span
id="fr_2575"></span>[2576](#fn_2575.md) </span>

<span id="ix.clxxvi-p3"></span>*To Count Magnenianus*. <span
id="fr_2576"></span>[2577](#fn_2576.md)

<span id="ix.clxxvi-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxxvi-p5.1"></span>Your</span> excellency lately wrote to me,
plainly charging me, besides other matters, to write concerning the
Faith.  I admire your zeal in the matter, and I pray God that your
choice of good things may be persistent, and that, advancing in
knowledge and good works, you may be made perfect.  But I have no wish
to leave behind me a treatise on the Faith, or to write various creeds,
and so I have declined to send what you asked. <span
id="fr_2577"></span>[2578](#fn_2577.md)   You seem to me to be surrounded
by the din of your men there, idle fellows, who say certain things to
calumniate me, with the idea that they will improve their own position
by lying disgracefully against me. <span
id="fr_2578"></span>[2579](#fn_2578.md)   The past shews what they are, and
future experience will shew them in still plainer colours.  I, however,
call on all who trust in Christ not to busy themselves in opposition to
the ancient faith, but, as we believe, so to be baptized, and, as we are
baptized, so to offer the doxology. <span
id="fr_2579"></span>[2580](#fn_2579.md)   It is enough for us to confess
those names which we have received from Holy Scripture, and to shun all
innovation about them.  Our salvation does not lie in the invention of
modes of address, but in the sound confession of the Godhead in which we
have professed our faith.

<span id="ix.clxxvi-p6"></span> But what Basil declined to do at the
prompting of Magnenianus, he shortly afterwards did for Amphilochius,
and wrote the *De Spiritu Sancto*.

allusion is to Atarbuis of Neocæsarea and to some of his presbyters.
