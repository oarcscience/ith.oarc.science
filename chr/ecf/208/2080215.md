<span id="ix.cxliii-p5"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxliii-p5.1"></span>assembled</span> all my brethren the
chorepiscopi at the synod of the blessed martyr Eupsychius <span
id="fr_2471"></span>[2472](#fn_2471.md) to introduce them to your
excellency.  On account of your absence they must be brought before you
by letter.  Know, therefore, this brother as being worthy to be trusted
by your intelligence, because he fears the Lord.  As to the matters on
behalf of the poor, which he refers to your good-will, deign to believe
him as one worthy of credit, and to give the afflicted all the aid in
your power.  I am sure you will consent to look favourably upon the
hospital of the poor which is in his district, and exempt it altogether
from taxation.  It has already seemed good to your colleague to make the
little property of the poor not liable to be rated.
