<span id="ix.cxxxiii-p3"></span>*To Abramius, bishop of Batnæ*. <span

<span id="ix.cxxxiii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxxxiii-p5.1"></span>Ever</span> since the autumn I have been
quite ignorant of the whereabouts of your reverence; for I kept hearing
uncertain rumours, some saying that you were stopping at Samosata, and
some in the country, while others maintained that they had seen you at
Batnæ.  This is the reason of my not writing frequently.  Now, on
hearing that you are staying at Antioch, in the house of the honourable
Count Saturninus, I have been glad to give this letter to our beloved
and reverend brother Sanctissimus, our fellow presbyter, <span
id="page_200">p. 200</span> <span id="ix.cxxxiii-Page_200"></span>by
whom I salute you, and exhort you, whereever you be, to remember firstly
God, and secondly myself, whom you determined from the beginning to love
and to reckon among your most intimate friends.
