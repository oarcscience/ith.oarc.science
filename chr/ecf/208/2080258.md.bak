id="ix.clxxxvi-p1.1"></span>Letter CLXXXV. <span
id="fr_2602"></span>[2603](#fn_2602.md) </span>

<span id="ix.clxxxvi-p3"></span>*To Theodotus, bishop of Beræa*. <span
id="fr_2603"></span>[2604](#fn_2603.md)

<span id="ix.clxxxvi-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxxxvi-p5.1"></span>Although</span> you do not write to me, I
know that there is recollection of me in your heart; and this I infer,
not because I <span id="page_223">p. 223</span> <span
id="ix.clxxxvi-Page_223"></span>am worthy of any favourable
recollection, but because your soul is rich in abundance of love.  Yet,
as far as in you lies, use whatever opportunities you have of writing to
me, to the end that I may both be cheered by hearing news of you, and
have occasion to send you tidings of myself.  This is the only mode of
communication for those who live far apart.  Do not let us deprive one
another of it, so far as our labours will permit.  But I pray God that
we may meet in person, that our love may be increased, and that we may
multiply gratitude to our Master for His greater boons.
