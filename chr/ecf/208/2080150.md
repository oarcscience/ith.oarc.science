<span id="ix.lxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.lxxviii-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXVII. <span
id="fr_2269"></span>[2270](#fn_2269) </span>

<span id="ix.lxxviii-p3"></span>*Without inscription:  about
Therasius*. <span id="fr_2270"></span>[2271](#fn_2270)

<span id="ix.lxxviii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxxviii-p5.1"></span>One</span> good thing we have certainly
gained from the government of the great Therasius and that is that you
have frequently paid us a visit.  Now, alas! we have lost our governor,
and we are deprived of this good thing too.  But since the boons once
given us by God remain immovable, and, although we are parted in body,
abide fixed by memory in the souls of each of us, let us constantly
write, and communicate our needs to one another.  And this we may well
do at the present moment, when the storm for a brief space has cried a
truce.  I trust that you will not part from the admirable Therasius, for
I think that it is very becoming to share his great anxieties, and I am
delighted at the opportunity given you both of seeing your friends and
of being seen by them. <span id="fr_2271"></span>[2272](#fn_2271)   I
have much to say about many things, but I put it off till we meet, for
it is, I think, hardly safe to entrust matters of such importance to
letters.

<span id="ix.lxxviii-p2"></span> Of the same date as the preceding.

<span id="ix.lxxviii-p4"></span> Perhaps to Elpidius.  Therasius is
probably the governor referred to in *Letter* xcvi. to Sophronius.

say “*corruptissimus*.”
