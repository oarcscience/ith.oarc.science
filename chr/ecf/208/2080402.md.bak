<span id="ix.cccxxx-p2"></span>*Basil to Libanius*. <span
id="fr_3266"></span>[3267](#fn_3266.md)

<span id="ix.cccxxx-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cccxxx-p5.1"></span>I am</span> really ashamed of sending you the
Cappadocians one by one.  I should prefer to induce all our youths to
devote themselves to letters and learning, and to avail themselves of
your instruction in their training.  But it is impracticable to get hold
of them all at once, while they choose what suits themselves.  I
therefore send you those who from time to time are won over; and this I
do with the assurance that I am conferring on them a boon as great as
that which is given by those who bring thirsty men to the fountain.  The
lad, whom I am now sending, will be highly valued for his own sake when
he has been in your society.  He is already well known on account of his
father, who has won a name among us both for rectitude of life and for
authority in our community.  He is, moreover, a close friend of my own. 
To requite him for his friendship to me, I am conferring on his son the
benefit of an introduction to you—a boon well worthy of being earnestly
prayed for by all who are competent to judge of a man’s high character.

<span id="ix.cccxxx-p4"></span>Maran (*Vit. Bas*. xxxix. 2) thinks that
the Libanian correspondence, assuming it to be genuine, is to be
assigned partly to the period of the retreat, partly to that of the
presbyterate, while two only, the one a complaint on the part of
Libanius that bishops are avaricious, and Basil’s retort, may perhaps
have been written during the episcopate.  He would see no reason for
rejecting them on the ground merely of the unlikelihood of Basil’s
corresponding with a heathen philosopher, but he is of opinion that the
style of most of them is unworthy both of the sophist and of the
archbishop.  Yet there seems no reason why they should have been
invented.  It is intelligible enough that they should have been
preserved, considering the reputation of the writers; but they suggest
no motive for forgery.  The life of Libanius extended from 314 to nearly
the end of the fourth century.  J. R. Mozley, in *D.C.B.* (iv. 712)
refers to G. R. Siever (*<span id="ix.cccxxx-p4.1"></span>Das Leben des
Libanius*, Berlin, 1868) as the fullest biographer.
