<span id="ix.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.vi-p1.1"></span>Letter V. <span
id="fr_1767"></span>[1768](#fn_1767.md) </span>

<span id="ix.vi-p3"></span>*To Nectarius*. <span
id="fr_1768"></span>[1769](#fn_1768.md)

<span id="ix.vi-p5"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.vi-p5.1"></span>I heard</span> of your unendurable loss, and was
much distressed.  Three or four days went by, and I was still in some
doubt because my informant was not able to give me any clear details of
the melancholy event.  While I was incredulous about what was noised
abroad, because I prayed that it might not be true, I received a letter
from the Bishop fully confirming the unhappy tidings.  I need not tell
you how I sighed and wept.  Who could be so stony-hearted, so truly
inhuman, as to be insensible to what has occurred, or be affected by
merely moderate grief?  He is gone; heir of a noble house, prop of a
family, a father’s hope, offspring of pious parents, nursed with
innumerable prayers, in the very bloom of manhood, torn from his
father’s hands.  These things are enough to break a heart of adamant and
make it feel.  It is only natural then that I am deeply touched at this
trouble; I who have been intimately connected with you from the
beginning and have made your joys and sorrows mine.  But yesterday it
seemed that you had only little to trouble <span id="page_114">p.
114</span> <span id="ix.vi-Page_114"></span>you, and that your life’s
stream was flowing prosperously on.  In a moment, by a demon’s
malice, <span id="fr_1769"></span>[1770](#fn_1769.md) all the happiness of
the house, all the brightness of life, is destroyed, and our lives are
made a doleful story.  If we wish to lament and weep over what has
happened, a lifetime will not be enough and if all mankind mourns with
us they will be powerless to make their lamentation match our loss. 
Yes, if all the streams run tears <span
id="fr_1770"></span>[1771](#fn_1770.md) they will not adequately weep our
woe.

<span id="ix.vi-p8"></span>2.  But we mean,—do we not?—to bring out the
gift which God has stored in our hearts; I mean that sober reason which
in our happy days is wont to draw lines of limitation round our souls,
and when troubles come about us to recall to our minds that we are but
men, and to suggest to us, what indeed we have seen and heard, that life
is full of similar misfortunes, and that the examples of human
sufferings are not a few.  Above all, this will tell us that it is God’s
command that we who trust in Christ should not grieve over them who are
fallen asleep, because we hope in the resurrection; and that in reward
for great patience great crowns of glory are kept in store by the Master
of life’s course.  Only let us allow our wiser thoughts to speak to us
in this strain of music, and we may peradventure discover some slight
alleviation of our trouble.  Play the man, then, I implore you; the blow
is a heavy one, but stand firm; do not fall under the weight of your
grief; do not lose heart.  Be perfectly assured of this, that though the
reasons for what is ordained by God are beyond us, yet always what is
arranged for us by Him Who is wise and Who loves us is to be accepted,
be it ever so grievous to endure.  He Himself knows how He is appointing
what is best for each and why the terms of life that He fixes for us are
unequal.  There exists some reason incomprehensible to man why some are
sooner carried far away from us, and some are left a longer while behind
to bear the burdens of this painful life.  So we ought always to adore
His loving kindness, and not to repine, remembering those great and
famous words of the great athlete Job, when he had seen ten children at
one table, in one short moment, crushed to death, “The Lord gave and the
Lord hath taken away.” <span id="fr_1771"></span>[1772](#fn_1771.md)   As
the Lord thought good so it came to pass.  Let us adopt those marvellous
words.  At the hands of the righteous Judge, they who show like good
deeds shall receive a like reward.  We have not lost the lad; we have
restored him to the Lender.  His life is not destroyed; it is changed
for the better.  He whom we love is not hidden in the ground; he is
received into heaven.  Let us wait a little while, and we shall be once
more with him.  The time of our separation is not long, for in this life
we are all like travellers on a journey, hastening on to the same
shelter.  While one has reached his rest another arrives, another
hurries on, but one and the same end awaits them all.  He has
outstripped us on the way, but we shall all travel the same road, and
the same hostelry awaits us all.  God only grant that we through
goodness may be likened to his purity, to the end that for the sake of
our guilelessness of life we may attain the rest which is granted to
them that are children in Christ.
