<span id="ix.cvii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cvii-p1.1"></span>Letter CVI. <span
id="fr_2366"></span>[2367](#fn_2366.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cvii-p3"></span>*To a soldier*.

<span id="ix.cvii-p4"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cvii-p4.1"></span>have</span> many reasons for thanking God for
mercies vouchsafed to me in my journey, but I count no blessing greater
than the knowledge of your excellency, which has been permitted me by
our good Lord’s mercy.  I have learnt to know one who proves that even
in a soldier’s life it is possible to preserve the perfection of love to
God, <span id="fr_2367"></span>[2368](#fn_2367.md) and that we must mark a
Christian not by the style of his dress, but by the disposition of his
soul.  It was a great delight to me to meet you; and now, whenever I
remember you, I feel very glad.  Play the man; be strong; strive to
nourish and multiply love to God, that there may be given you by Him yet
greater boons of blessing.  I need no further proof that you remember
me; I have evidence in what you have done.
