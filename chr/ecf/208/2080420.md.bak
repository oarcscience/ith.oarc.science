id="ix.cccxlviii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCCLIII.</span>

<span id="ix.cccxlviii-p2"></span>Basil to Libanius.

<span id="ix.cccxlviii-p3"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cccxlviii-p3.1"></span>have</span> read your speech, and have
immensely admired it.  O muses; O learning; O Athens; what do you not
give to those who love you!  What fruits do not they gather who spend
even a short time with you!  Oh for your copiously flowing fountain! 
What men all who drink of it are shewn to be!  I seemed to see the man
himself in your speech, in the company of his chattering little woman. 
A living story has been written on the ground by Libanius, who alone has
bestowed the gift of life upon his words.
