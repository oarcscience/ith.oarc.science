<span id="ix.cl-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cl-p5.1"></span>You</span> yourself have seen with your own eyes
the distressing condition of Maximus, once a man of high reputation, but
now most of all to be pitied, formerly prefect of my country.  Would
that he had never been so!  Many, I think, would be likely to shun
provincial governorships, if their dignities are likely to issue in such
an end.  To a man, then, from the quickness of his intelligence, able
from a few circumstances to conjecture the rest, I need hardly narrate
in detail all that I have seen and all that I have heard.  Perhaps,
however, I shall not seem to be telling a superfluous story if I mention
that, though many and terrible things were audaciously done against him
before your coming, what went on afterwards was such as to cause the
former proceedings to be reckoned as kindness; to such an excess of
outrage and injury and actually of personal cruelty did the proceedings
go which were afterwards taken against him by the person in authority. 
Now he is here with an escort to fill up the measure of his evil deeds
unless you are willing to stretch out your strong hand to protect the
sufferer.  In urging your goodness to an act of kindness I feel that I
am undertaking an unnecessary task.  Yet since I desire to be
serviceable to Maximus I do beg your lordship to add something for my
sake to your natural zeal for what is right, to the end that he may
clearly perceive that my intervention on his behalf has been of service
to him.

points to its having been written to some one else.  Trajan had had no
personal knowledge of the troubles of Maximus.
