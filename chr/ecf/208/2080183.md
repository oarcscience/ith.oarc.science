<span id="ix.cxi-p3"></span>*To the prefect Modestus*. <span

<span id="ix.cxi-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxi-p5.1"></span>In</span> kindly condescending to come down to
me you give me great honour and allow me great freedom; and these in
like, aye and in greater, measure, I pray that your lordship may receive
from our good Master during the whole of your life.  I have long wanted
to write to you and to receive honour at your hands, but respect for
your great dignity has restrained me, and I have been careful lest I
should ever seem to abuse the liberty conceded to me.  Now, however, I
am forced to take courage, not only by the fact of my having received
permission from your incomparable excellency to write, but also by the
necessity of the distressed.  If, then, prayers of even the small are of
any avail with the great, be moved, most excellent sir, of your good
will to grant relief to a rural population now in pitiable case, and
give orders that the tax of iron, paid by the inhabitants of
iron-producing Taurus, may be made such as it is possible to pay.  Grant
this, lest they be crushed once for all, instead of being of lasting
service to the state.  I am sure that your admirable benevolence will
see that this is done.
