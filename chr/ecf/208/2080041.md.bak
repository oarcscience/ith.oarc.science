<span id="vii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.</span>

<span id="vii.xii-p2"></span>That they who deny the Spirit are
transgressors.

<span id="vii.xii-p3"></span>27.  “<span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xii-p3.1"></span>Who</span> hath woe?  Who hath sorrow?” <span
id="fr_938"></span>[939](#fn_938.md)   For whom is distress and darkness? 
For whom eternal doom?  Is it not for the transgressors?  For them that
deny the faith?  And what is the proof of their denial?  Is it not that
they have set at naught their own confessions?  And when and what did
they confess?  Belief in the Father and in the Son and in the Holy
Ghost, when they renounced the devil and his angels, and uttered those
saving words.  What fit title then for them has been discovered, for the
children of light to use?  Are they not addressed as transgressors, as
having violated the covenant of their salvation?  What am I to call the
denial of God?  What the denial of Christ?  What but transgressions? 
And to him who denies the Spirit, what title do you wish me to apply? 
Must it not be the same, inasmuch as he has broken his covenant with
God?  And when the confession of faith in Him secures the blessing of
true religion. and its denial subjects men to the doom of godlessness,
is it not a fearful thing for them to set the confession at naught, not
through fear of fire, or sword, or cross, or scourge, or wheel, or rack,
but merely led astray by the sophistry and seductions of the
pneumatomachi?  I testify to every man who is confessing Christ and
denying God, that Christ will profit him nothing; <span
id="fr_939"></span>[940](#fn_939.md) to every man that calls upon God but
rejects the Son, that his faith is vain; <span
id="fr_940"></span>[941](#fn_940.md) to every man that sets aside the
Spirit, that <span id="page_18">p. 18</span> <span
id="vii.xii-Page_18"></span>his faith in the Father and the Son will be
useless, for he cannot even hold it without the presence of the Spirit. 
For he who does not believe the Spirit does not believe in the Son, and
he who has not believed in the Son does not believe in the Father.  For
none “can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost,” <span
id="fr_941"></span>[942](#fn_941.md) and “No man hath seen God at any time,
but the only begotten God which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath
declared him.” <span id="fr_942"></span>[943](#fn_942.md)

<span id="vii.xii-p9"></span>Such an one hath neither part nor lot in
the true worship; for it is impossible to worship the Son, save by the
Holy Ghost; impossible to call upon the Father, save by the Spirit of
adoption.

the Bodleian, and that at Vienna.  “Son” is read by Regius III., Regius
I., Regius IV., and Regius V. in Paris, the three last being all of the
14th century, the one in the British Museum, and another in the Imperial
Library at Vienna, which generally agrees with our own in the Museum.
