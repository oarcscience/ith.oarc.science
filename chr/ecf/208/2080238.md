id="ix.clxvi-p1.1"></span>Letter CLXV. <span
id="fr_2550"></span>[2551](#fn_2550) </span>

<span id="ix.clxvi-p3"></span>*To Ascholius, bishop of
Thessalonica*. <span id="fr_2551"></span>[2552](#fn_2551)

<span id="ix.clxvi-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxvi-p5.1"></span>God</span> has fulfilled my old prayer in
deigning to allow me to receive the letter of your veritable holiness. 
What I most of all desire is to see you and to be seen by you, and to
enjoy in actual intercourse all the graces of the Spirit with which you
are endowed.  This, however, is impossible, both on account of the
distance which separates us, and the engrossing occupations of each of
us.  I therefore pray, in the second place, that my soul may be fed by
frequent letters from your love in Christ.  This has now been granted me
on taking your epistle into my hands.  I have been doubly delighted at
the enjoyment of your communication.  I felt as though I could really
see your very soul shining in your words as in some mirror; and I was
moved to exceeding joy, not only at your proving to be what all
testimony says of you, but that your noble qualities are the ornament of
my country.  You have filled the country beyond our borders with
spiritual fruits, like some vigorous branch sprung from a glorious
root.  Rightly, then, does our country rejoice in her own offshoots. 
When you were engaging in con<span id="page_217">p. 217</span> <span
id="ix.clxvi-Page_217"></span>flicts for the Faith she heard that the
goodly heritage of the Fathers was preserved in you, and she glorified
God.  And now what are you about?  You have honoured the land that gave
you birth by sending her a martyr who has just fought a good fight in
the barbarian country on your borders, just as a grateful gardener might
send his first fruits to those who had given him the seeds.  Verily the
gift is worthy of Christ’s athlete, a martyr of the truth just crowned
with the crown of righteousness, whom we have gladly welcomed,
glorifying God who has now fulfilled the gospel of His Christ in all the
world.  Let me ask you to remember in your prayers me who love you, and
for my soul’s sake earnestly to beseech the Lord that one day I, too,
may be deemed worthy to begin to serve God, according to the way of His
commandments which He has given us to salvation.

that there can be no doubt of the letter being addressed, not to
Ascholius, but to Soranus, duke of Scythia.  We have seen in letter 255
that Basil requested his relative Julius Soranus to send him some relics
of the Gothic martyrs.  This letter appears to refer to his prompt
compliance with the request by sending relics of Saint Sabas.
