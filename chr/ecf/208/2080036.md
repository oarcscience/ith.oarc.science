<span id="vii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.</span>

<span id="vii.vii-p2"></span>Issue joined with those who assert that the
Son is not with the Father, but after the Father.  Also concerning the
equal glory.

<span id="vii.vii-p3"></span>13.  <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.vii-p3.1"></span>Our</span> opponents, while they thus artfully
and perversely encounter our argument, cannot even have recourse to the
plea of ignorance.  It is obvious that they are annoyed with us for
completing the doxology to the Only Begotten together with the Father,
and for not separating the Holy Spirit from the Son.  On this account
they style us innovators, revolutionizers, phrase-coiners, and every
other possible name of insult.  But so far am I from being irritated at
their abuse, that, were it not for the fact that their loss causes me
“heaviness and continual sorrow,” <span
id="fr_785"></span>[786](#fn_785.md) I could almost have said that I was
grateful to them for the blasphemy, as though they were agents for
providing me with blessing.  For “blessed are ye,” it is said, “when men
shall revile you for my sake.” <span id="fr_786"></span>[787](#fn_786.md)  
The grounds of their indignation are these:  The Son, according to them,
is not together with the Father, but after the Father.  Hence it follows
that glory should be ascribed to the Father “*through* him,” but not
“*with* him;” inasmuch as “*with* him” expresses equality of dignity,
while “*through* him” denotes subordination.  They further assert that
the Spirit is not to be ranked along with the Father and the Son, but
under the Son and the Father; not coordinated, but subordinated; not
connumerated, but subnumerated. <span id="fr_787"></span>[788](#fn_787.md)

<span id="vii.vii-p7"></span>With technical terminology of this kind
they pervert the simplicity and artlessness of the faith, and thus by
their ingenuity, suffering no one else to remain in ignorance, they cut
off from themselves the plea that ignorance might demand.

<span id="vii.vii-p8"></span>14.  Let us first ask them this question: 
In what sense do they say that the Son is “after the Father;” later in
time, or in order, or in dignity?  But in time no one is so devoid of
sense as to assert that the Maker of the ages <span
id="fr_788"></span>[789](#fn_788.md) holds a second place, when no interval
intervenes in the natural conjunction of the Father with the Son. <span
id="fr_789"></span>[790](#fn_789.md)   And indeed so far as our conception
of human relations goes, <span id="fr_790"></span>[791](#fn_790.md) it is
impossible to think of the Son as being later than the Father, not only
from the fact that Father and Son are mutually conceived of in
accordance with the relationship subsisting between them, but because
posteriority in time is predicated of subjects separated by a less
interval from the present, and priority of subjects farther off.  For
instance, what happened in Noah’s time is prior to what happened to the
men of Sodom, inasmuch as Noah is more remote from our own day; and,
again, the events of the history of the men of Sodom are posterior,
because they seem in a sense to approach nearer to our own day.  But, in
addition to its being a breach of true religion, is it not really the
extremest folly to measure the existence of the life which transcends
all time and all the ages by its distance from the present?  Is it not
as though God the Father could be compared with, and be made superior
to, God the Son, who exists before the ages, precisely in the same way
in which things liable to beginning and corruption are described as
prior to one another?

<span id="vii.vii-p12"></span>The superior remoteness of the Father is
really inconceivable, in that thought and intelligence are wholly
impotent to go beyond the generation of the Lord; and St. John has
admirably confined the conception within circumscribed boundaries by two
words, “In the *beginning was* the Word.”  For thought cannot travel
outside “was,” nor imagination <span id="fr_791"></span>[792](#fn_791.md)
beyond “*beginning*.”  Let <span id="page_9">p. 9</span> <span
id="vii.vii-Page_9"></span>your thought travel ever so far backward you
cannot get beyond the “*was*,” and however you may strain and strive to
see what is beyond the Son, you will find it impossible to get further
than the “*beginning*.”  True religion, therefore, thus teaches us to
think of the Son together with the Father.

<span id="vii.vii-p14"></span>15.  If they really conceive of a kind of
degradation of the Son in relation to the Father, as though He were in a
lower place, so that the Father sits above, and the Son is thrust off to
the next seat below, let them confess what they mean.  We shall have no
more to say.  A plain statement of the view will at once expose its
absurdity.  They who refuse to allow that the Father pervades all things
do not so much as maintain the logical sequence of thought in their
argument.  The faith of the sound is that God fills all things; <span
id="fr_792"></span>[793](#fn_792.md) but they who divide their up and down
between the Father and the Son do not remember even the word of the
Prophet:  “If I climb up into heaven thou art there; if I go down to
hell thou art there also.” <span id="fr_793"></span>[794](#fn_793.md)  
Now, to omit all proof of the ignorance of those who predicate place of
incorporeal things, what excuse can be found for their attack upon
Scripture, shameless as their antagonism is, in the passages “Sit thou
on my right hand” <span id="fr_794"></span>[795](#fn_794.md) and “Sat down
on the right hand of the majesty of God”? <span
id="fr_795"></span>[796](#fn_795.md)   The expression “right hand” does
not, as they contend, indicate the lower place, but equality of
relation; it is not understood physically, in which case there might be
something sinister about God, <span id="fr_796"></span>[797](#fn_796.md)
but Scripture puts before us the magnificence of the dignity of the Son
by the use of dignified language indicating the seat of honour.  It is
left then for our opponents to allege that this expression signifies
inferiority of rank.  Let them learn that “Christ is the power of God
and wisdom of God,” <span id="fr_797"></span>[798](#fn_797.md) and that “He
is the image of the invisible God” <span
id="fr_798"></span>[799](#fn_798.md) and “brightness of his glory,” <span
id="fr_799"></span>[800](#fn_799.md) and that “Him hath God the Father
sealed,” <span id="fr_800"></span>[801](#fn_800.md) by engraving Himself on
Him. <span id="fr_801"></span>[802](#fn_801.md)

<span id="vii.vii-p25"></span>Now are we to call these passages, and
others like them, throughout the whole of Holy Scripture, proofs of
humiliation, or rather public proclamations of the majesty of the Only
Begotten, and of the equality of His glory with the Father?  We ask them
to listen to the Lord Himself, distinctly setting forth the equal
dignity of His glory with the Father, in His words, “He that hath seen
me hath seen the Father;” <span id="fr_802"></span>[803](#fn_802.md) and
again, “When the Son cometh in the glory of his Father;” <span
id="fr_803"></span>[804](#fn_803.md) that they “should honour the Son even
as they honour the Father;” <span id="fr_804"></span>[805](#fn_804.md) and,
“We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the
Father;” <span id="fr_805"></span>[806](#fn_805.md) and “the only begotten
God which is in the bosom of the Father.” <span
id="fr_806"></span>[807](#fn_806.md)   Of all these passages they take no
account, and then assign to the Son the place set apart for His foes.  A
father’s bosom is a fit and becoming seat for a son, but the place of
the footstool is for them that have to be forced to fall. <span
id="fr_807"></span>[808](#fn_807.md)

<span id="vii.vii-p32"></span>We have only touched cursorily on these
proofs, because our object is to pass on to other points.  You at your
leisure can put together the items of the evidence, and then contemplate
the height of the glory and the preeminence of the power of the Only
Begotten.  However, to the well-disposed hearer, even these are not
insignificant, unless the terms “right hand” and “bosom” be accepted in
a physical and derogatory sense, so as at once to circumscribe God in
local limits, and invent form, mould, and bodily position, all of which
are totally distinct from the idea of the absolute, the infinite, and
the incorporeal.  There is moreover the fact that what is derogatory in
the idea of it is the same in the case both of the Father and the Son;
so that whoever repeats these arguments does not take away the dignity
of the Son, but does incur the charge of blaspheming the Father; for
whatever audacity a man be guilty of against the Son he cannot but
transfer to the Father.  If he assigns to the Father the upper place
<span id="page_10">p. 10</span> <span id="vii.vii-Page_10"></span>by way
of precedence, and asserts that the only begotten Son sits below, he
will find that to the creature of his imagination attach all the
consequent conditions of body.  And if these are the imaginations of
drunken delusion and phrensied insanity, can it be consistent with true
religion for men taught by the Lord himself that “He that honoureth not
the Son honoureth not the Father” <span
id="fr_808"></span>[809](#fn_808.md) to refuse to worship and glorify with
the Father him who in nature, in glory, and in dignity is conjoined with
him?  What shall we say?  What just defence shall we have in the day of
the awful universal judgment of all-creation, if, when the Lord clearly
announces that He will come “in the glory of his Father;” <span
id="fr_809"></span>[810](#fn_809.md) when Stephen beheld Jesus standing at
the right hand of God; <span id="fr_810"></span>[811](#fn_810.md) when Paul
testified in the spirit concerning Christ “that he is at the right hand
of God;” <span id="fr_811"></span>[812](#fn_811.md) when the Father says,
“Sit thou on my right hand;” <span id="fr_812"></span>[813](#fn_812.md)
when the Holy Spirit bears witness that he has sat down on “the right
hand of the majesty” <span id="fr_813"></span>[814](#fn_813.md) of God; we
attempt to degrade him who shares the honour and the throne, from his
condition of equality, to a lower state? <span
id="fr_814"></span>[815](#fn_814.md)   Standing and sitting, I apprehend,
indicate the fixity and entire stability of the nature, as Baruch, when
he wishes to exhibit the immutability and immobility of the Divine mode
of existence, says, “For thou sittest for ever and we perish
utterly.” <span id="fr_815"></span>[816](#fn_815.md)   Moreover, the place
on the right hand indicates in my judgment equality of honour.  Rash,
then, is the attempt to deprive the Son of participation in the
doxology, as though worthy only to be ranked in a lower place of honour.
