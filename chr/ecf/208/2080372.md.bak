<span id="ix.ccc-p4"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccc-p4.1"></span>was</span> aware, before you told me, that you
do not like your employment in public affairs.  It is an old saying that
those who are anxious to lead a pious life do not throw themselves with
pleasure into office.  The case of magistrates seems to me like that of
physicians.  They see awful sights; they meet with bad smells; they get
trouble for themselves out of other people’s calamities.  This is at
least the case with those who are real magistrates.  All men who are
engaged in business, look also to make a profit, and are excited about
this kind of glory, count it the greatest possible advantage to acquire
some power and influence by which they may be able to benefit their
friends, punish their enemies, and get what they want for themselves. 
You are not a man of this kind.  How should you be?  You have
voluntarily withdrawn from even high office in the State.  You might
have ruled the city like one single house, but you have preferred a life
free from care and anxiety.  You have placed a higher value on having no
troubles yourself and not troubling other people, than other people do
on making themselves disagreeable.  But it has seemed good to the Lord
that the district of Ibora <span id="fr_3259"></span>[3260](#fn_3259.md)
should not be under the power of hucksters, nor be turned into a mere
slave market.  It is His will that every individual in it should be
enrolled, as is right.  Do you therefore accept this responsibility?  It
is vexatious, I know, but it is one which may bring you the approbation
of God.  Neither fawn upon the great and powerful, nor despise the poor
and needy.  Show to all under your rule an impartiality of mind,
balanced more exactly than any scales.  Thus in the sight of those who
have entrusted you with these responsibilities your zeal for justice
will be made evident, and they will view you with exceptional
admiration.  And even though you go unnoticed by them, you will not be
unnoticed by our God.  The prizes which He has put before us for good
works are great.
