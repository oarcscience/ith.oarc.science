id="ix.lxxi-p5.1"></span>To</span> renew laws of ancient love, and once
again to restore to vigorous life that heavenly and saving gift of
Christ which in course of time has withered away, the peace, I mean, of
the Fathers, is a labour necessary indeed and profitable to me, but
pleasant too, as I am sure it will seem to your Christ-loving
disposition.  For what could be more delightful than to behold all, who
are separated by distances so vast, bound together by the union effected
by love into one harmony of members in Christ’s body?  Nearly all the
East (I include under this name all the regions from Illyricum to Egypt)
is being agitated, right honourable father, by a terrible storm and
tempest.  The old heresy, sown by Arius the enemy of the truth, has now
boldly and unblushingly reappeared.  Like some sour root, it is
producing its deadly fruit and is prevailing.  The reason of this is,
that in every district the champions of right doctrine have been exiled
from their Churches by calumny and outrage, and the control of affairs
has been handed over to men who are leading captive the souls of the
simpler brethren.  I have looked upon the visit of your mercifulness as
the only possible solution of our difficulties.  Ever in the past I have
been consoled by your extraordinary affection; and for a short time my
heart was cheered by the gratifying report that we shall be visited by
you.  But, as I was disappointed, I have been constrained to beseech you
by letter to be moved to help us, and to send some of those, who are
like minded with us, either to conciliate the dissentient and bring back
the Churches of God into friendly union, or at all events to make you
see more plainly who are responsible for the unsettled state in which we
are, that it may be obvious to you for the future with whom it befits
you to be in communion.  In this I am by no means making any novel
request, but am only asking what has been customary in the case of men
who, before our own day, were blessed and dear to God, and conspicuously
in your own case.  For I well remember learning from the answers made by
our fathers when asked, and from documents still preserved among us,
that the illustrious and blessed bishop Dionysius, conspicuous in your
see as well for soundness of faith as for all other virtues, visited by
letter my Church of Cæsarea, and by letter exhorted our fathers, and
sent men to ransom our brethren from captivity. <span
id="fr_2252"></span>[2253](#fn_2252.md)   But now our condition is yet more
painful and gloomy and needs more careful treatment.  We are lamenting
no mere overthrow of earthly buildings, but the capture of Churches;
what we see <span id="page_167">p. 167</span> <span
id="ix.lxxi-Page_167"></span>before us is no mere bodily slavery, but a
carrying away of souls into captivity, perpetrated day by day by the
champions of heresy.  Should you not, even now, be moved to succour us,
ere long all will have fallen under the dominion of the heresy, and you
will find none left to whom you may hold out your hand.

<span id="ix.lxxi-p6"></span> The Ben. Ed. points out that what is
related by Basil, of the kindness of the bishops of Rome to other
churches, is confirmed by the evidence both of Dionysius, bishop of
Corinth (*cf*. Eusebius, *Hist. Ecc.* iv. 23), of Dionysius of
Alexandria (Dionysius to Sixtus II. *Apud Euseb., Ecc. Hist.* vii. 5),
and of Eusebius himself who in his history speaks of the practice having
been continued down to the persecution in his own day.  The troubles
referred to by Basil took place in the time of Gallienus, when the
Scythians ravaged Cappadocia and the neighbouring countries.  (*cf.*
Sozomen, ii. 6.)  Dionysius succeeded Sixtus II. at Rome in 259.
