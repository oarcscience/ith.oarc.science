<span id="vii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.</span>

<span id="vii.x-p2"></span>Definitive conceptions about the Spirit which
conform to the teaching of the Scriptures.

<span id="vii.x-p3"></span>22.  <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.x-p3.1"></span>Let</span> us now investigate what are our common
conceptions concerning the Spirit, as well those which have been
gathered by us from Holy Scripture concerning It as those which we have
received from the unwritten tradition of the Fathers.  First of all we
ask, who on hearing the titles of the Spirit is not lifted up in soul,
who does not raise his conception to the supreme nature?  It is called
“Spirit of God,” <span id="fr_910"></span>[911](#fn_910.md) “Spirit of
truth which proceedeth from the Father,” <span
id="fr_911"></span>[912](#fn_911.md) “right Spirit,” <span
id="fr_912"></span>[913](#fn_912.md) “a leading Spirit.” <span
id="fr_913"></span>[914](#fn_913.md)   Its <span
id="fr_914"></span>[915](#fn_914.md) proper and peculiar title is “Holy
Spirit;” which is a name specially appropriate to everything that is
incorporeal, purely immaterial, and indivisible.  So our Lord, when
teaching the woman who thought God to be an object of local worship that
the incorporeal is incomprehensible, said “God is a spirit.” <span
id="fr_915"></span>[916](#fn_915.md)   On our hearing, then, of a spirit,
it is impossible to form the idea of a nature circumscribed, subject to
change and variation, or at all like the creature.  We are compelled to
advance in our conceptions to the highest, and to think of an
intelligent essence, in power infinite, in magnitude unlimited,
unmeasured by times or ages, generous of Its good gifts, to whom turn
all things needing sanctification, after whom reach all things that live
in virtue, as being watered by Its inspiration and helped on toward
their natural and proper end; perfecting all other things, but Itself in
nothing lacking; living not as needing restoration, but as Supplier of
life; not growing by additions; but straightway full, self-established,
omnipresent, origin of sanctification, light perceptible to the mind,
supplying, as it were, through Itself, illumination to every faculty in
the search for truth; by nature unapproachable, apprehended by reason of
goodness, filling all things with Its power, <span
id="fr_916"></span>[917](#fn_916.md) but communicated only to the worthy;
not shared in one measure, but distributing Its energy according to “the
proportion of faith;” <span id="fr_917"></span>[918](#fn_917.md) in essence
simple, in powers various, wholly present in each and being wholly
everywhere; impassively divided, shared without loss of ceasing to be
entire, after the likeness of the sunbeam, whose kindly light falls on
him who enjoys it as though it shone for him alone, yet illumines land
and sea and mingles with the air.  So, too, is the Spirit to every one
who receives it, as though given to him alone, and yet It sends forth
grace sufficient and full for all mankind, and is enjoyed by all who
share It, according to the capacity, not of Its power, but of their
nature.

<span id="vii.x-p12"></span>23.  Now the Spirit is not brought into
intimate association with the soul by local approximation.  How indeed
could there be a corporeal approach to the incorporeal?  This
association results from the withdrawal of the passions which, coming
afterwards gradually on the soul from its friendship to the flesh, have
alienated it from its close relationship with God.  Only then after a
man is purified from the shame whose stain he took through his
wickedness, and has come back again to his natural beauty, and as it
were cleaning the Royal Image and restoring its ancient form, only thus
is it possible for him to draw near to the Paraclete. <span
id="fr_918"></span>[919](#fn_918.md)   And He, like the sun, will by the
aid of thy purified eye show thee in Himself the image of the invisible,
and in the blessed spectacle of the image thou shalt behold the
unspeakable beauty of the archetype. <span
id="fr_919"></span>[920](#fn_919.md)   Through His aid hearts are lifted
up, the weak are held by the hand, and they who are advancing are
brought to perfection. <span id="fr_920"></span>[921](#fn_920.md)   Shining
upon those that are cleansed from every spot, He makes them spiritual by
fellowship with Himself.  Just as when a sunbeam falls on bright and
transparent bodies, they themselves become brilliant too, and shed forth
a fresh brightness from themselves, so souls wherein the Spirit dwells,
illuminated by the Spirit, themselves become spiritual, and send forth
their grace to others.  <span id="page_16">p. 16</span> <span
id="vii.x-Page_16"></span>Hence comes foreknowledge of the future,
understanding of mysteries, apprehension of what is hidden, distribution
of good gifts, the heavenly citizenship, a place in the chorus of
angels, joy without end, abiding in God, the being made like to God,
and, highest of all, the being made God. <span
id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921.md)   Such, then, to instance a few out of
many, are the conceptions concerning the Holy Spirit, which we have been
taught to hold concerning His greatness, His dignity, and His
operations, by the oracles <span id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922.md) of
the Spirit themselves.

<span id="vii.x-p13"></span> *cf*. Theodoret, *Dial*. i. p. 164, Schaff
and Wace’s ed. “Sin is not of nature, but of corrupt will.”  So the
ninth article of the English Church describes it as not the nature, but
the “fault and corruption of the nature, of every man.”  On the figure
of the restored picture *cf*. Ath. *de Incar*. § 14, and Theod. *Dial*.
ii. p. 183.

<span id="vii.x-p14"></span> *cf*. Ep. 236<span
id="vii.x-p14.1"></span>.  “Our mind enlightened by the Spirit, looks
toward the Son, and in Him, as in an image, contemplates the Father.” 
There seems at first sight some confusion in the text between the “Royal
Image” in us and Christ as the image of God; but it is in proportion as
we are like Christ that we see God in Christ.  It is the “pure in heart”
who “see God.”

<span id="vii.x-p16"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.x-p16.1"></span>Θεὸν γενεσθαι</span>.  The thought has its most
famous expression in Ath. *de Incar*. § 54.  He was made man that we
might be made God—<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.x-p16.2"></span>Θεοποιηθῶμεν</span>.  *cf*. *De Decretis*, § 14,
and other passages of Ath. Irenæus (*Adv. Hær*. iv. 38 \[lxxv.\]) writes
“*non ab initio dii facti sumus, sed primo quidem homines, tunc demum
dii.”  “Secundum enim benignitatem suam bene dedit bonum, et similes
sibi suæ potestatis homines fecit*;” and Origen (*contra Celsum*, iii.
28), “That the human nature by fellowship with the more divine might be
made divine, not in Jesus only, but also in all those who with faith
take up the life which Jesus taught;” and Greg. Naz. *Or*. xxx. § 14,
“Till by the power of the incarnation he make me God.”

<span id="vii.x-p17"></span>In Basil *adv. Eunom*. ii. 4. we have, “They
who are perfect in virtue are deemed worthy of the title of God.”

<span id="vii.x-p18"></span>*cf*. [2 Pet. i.
4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004.md)<span id="vii.x-p18.1"></span>: 
“That ye might be partakers of the divine nature.”

<span id="fn_922"></span>[16:923](2080039.htm#fr_922.md) <span

id="vii.x-p19.1"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.x-p19.2"></span>π᾽ αὐτῶν τῶν λογίων τοῦ πνεύματος</span>.  St.
Basil is as unconscious as other early Fathers of the limitation of the
word <span class="Greek"><span id="vii.x-p19.3"></span>λόγια</span> to
“discourses.”  *Vide* Salmon’s *Int. to the N.T. Ed*. iv. p. 95.
