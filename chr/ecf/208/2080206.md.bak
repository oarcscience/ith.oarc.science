<span id="ix.cxxxiv-p2"></span>*To Peter, bishop of Alexandria*. <span
id="fr_2440"></span>[2441](#fn_2440.md)

<span id="ix.cxxxiv-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxxxiv-p4.1"></span>The</span> sight of the eyes brings about
bodily friendship, and long companionship strengthens it, but genuine
regard is the gift of the Spirit, Who unites what is separated by long
distances, and makes friends known to one another, not by bodily
qualities, but by the characteristics of the soul.  The grace of the
Lord has granted me this favour, by permitting me to see you with the
soul’s eye, and to embrace you with genuine affection, and as it were,
to be drawn very near to you, and to come into close union with you in
the communion of faith.  I am sure that you, disciple as you are of so
great a man, and long associated with him, will walk in the same spirit
and follow the same doctrines of true religion.  Under these
circumstances I address your excellency, and beseech you that among the
other things in which you have succeeded that great man, you will
succeed him in love to me, that you will frequently write me news of
you, and will give heed to the brotherhood all over the world with the
same affection and the same zeal which that most blessed man always
showed to all that love God in truth.
