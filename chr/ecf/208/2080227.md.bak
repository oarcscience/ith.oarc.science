<span id="ix.clv-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.clv-p1.1"></span>Letter CLIV. <span
id="fr_2505"></span>[2506](#fn_2505.md) </span>

<span id="ix.clv-p3"></span>*To Ascholius, bishop of
Thessalonica*. <span id="fr_2506"></span>[2507](#fn_2506.md)

<span id="ix.clv-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clv-p5.1"></span>You</span> have done well, and in accordance
with the law of spiritual love, in writing to me first, and by your good
example challenging me to like energy.  The friendship of the world,
indeed, stands in need of actual sight and intercourse, that thence
intimacy may begin.  All, however, who know how to love in the spirit do
not need the flesh to <span id="page_210">p. 210</span> <span
id="ix.clv-Page_210"></span>promote affection, but are led to spiritual
communion in the fellowship of the faith.  Thanks, then, to the Lord Who
has comforted my heart by showing me that love has not grown cold in
all, but that there are yet in the world men who show the evidence of
the discipleship of Christ.  The state of affairs with you seems to be
something like that of the stars by night, shining some in one part of
the sky and some in another, whereof the brightness is charming, and the
more charming because it is unexpected.  Such are you, luminaries of the
Churches, a few at most and easily counted in this gloomy state of
things, shining as in a moonless night, and, besides being welcome for
your virtue, being all the more longed for because of its being so
seldom that you are found.  Your letter has made your disposition quite
plain to me.  Although small, as far as regards the number of its
syllables, in the correctness of its sentiments it was quite enough to
give me proof of your mind and purpose.  Your zeal for the cause of the
blessed Athanasius is plain proof of your being sound as to the most
important matters.  In return for my joy at your letter I am exceedingly
grateful to my honourable son Euphemius, to whom I pray that all help
may be given by the Holy One, and I beg you to join in my prayers that
we may soon receive him back with his very honourable wife, my daughter
in the Lord.  As to yourself, I beg that you will not stay our joy at
its beginning, but that you will write on every possible opportunity,
and increase your good feeling towards me by constant communication. 
Give me news, I beg you, about your Churches and how they are situated
as regards union.  Pray for us here that our Lord may rebuke the winds
and the sea, and that with us there may be a great, calm.
