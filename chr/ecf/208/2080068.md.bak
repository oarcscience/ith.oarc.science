<span id="viii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="viii.vii-p1.1"></span>Homily VI.</span>

<span id="viii.vii-p2"></span>The creation of luminous bodies.

<span id="viii.vii-p3"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="viii.vii-p3.1"></span>At</span> the shows in the circus the
spectator must join in the efforts of the athletes.  This the laws of
the show indicate, for they prescribe that all should have the head
uncovered when present at the stadium.  The object of this, in my
opinion, is that each one there should not only be a spectator of the
athletes, but be, in a certain measure, a true athlete himself. <span
id="fr_1564"></span>[1565](#fn_1564.md)   Thus, to investigate the great
and prodigious show of creation, to understand supreme and ineffable
wisdom, you must bring personal light for the contemplation of the
wonders which I spread before your eyes, and help me, according to your
power, in this struggle, where you are not so much judges as fellow
combatants, <span id="fr_1565"></span>[1566](#fn_1565.md) for fear lest the
truth might escape you, and lest my error might turn to your common
prejudice.  Why these words?  It is because we propose to study the
world as a whole, and to consider the universe, not by the light of
worldly wisdom, but by that with which <span id="page_82">p. 82</span>
<span id="viii.vii-Page_82"></span>God wills to enlighten His servant,
when He speaks to him in person and without enigmas.  It is because it
is absolutely necessary that all lovers of great and grand shows should
bring a mind well prepared to study them.  If sometimes, on a bright
night, <span id="fr_1566"></span>[1567](#fn_1566.md) whilst gazing with
watchful eyes on the inexpressible beauty of the stars, you have thought
of the Creator of all things; if you have asked yourself who it is that
has dotted heaven with such flowers, and why visible things are even
more useful than beautiful; if sometimes, in the day, you have studied
the marvels of light, if you have raised yourself by visible things to
the invisible Being, then you are a well prepared auditor, and you can
take your place in this august and blessed amphitheatre.  Come in the
same way that any one not knowing a town is taken by the hand and led
through it; thus I am going to lead you, like strangers, through the
mysterious marvels of this great city of the universe. <span
id="fr_1567"></span>[1568](#fn_1567.md)   Our first country was in this
great city, whence the murderous dæmon whose enticements seduced man to
slavery expelled us.  There you will see man’s first origin and his
immediate seizure by death, brought forth by sin, the first born of the
evil spirit.  You will know that you are formed of earth, but the work
of God’s hands; much weaker than the brute, but ordained to command
beings without reason and soul; inferior as regards natural advantages,
but, thanks to the privilege of reason, capable of raising yourself to
heaven.  If we are penetrated by these truths, we shall know ourselves,
we shall know God, we shall adore our Creator, we shall serve our
Master, we shall glorify our Father, we shall love our Sustainer, we
shall bless our Benefactor, we shall not cease to honour the
Prince <span id="fr_1568"></span>[1569](#fn_1568.md) of present and future
life, Who, by the riches that He showers upon us in this world, makes us
believe in His promises and uses present good things to strengthen our
expectation of the future.  Truly, if such are the good things of time,
what will be those of eternity?  If such is the beauty of visible
things, what shall we think of invisible things?  If the grandeur of
heaven exceeds the measure of human intelligence, what mind shall be
able to trace the nature of the everlasting?  If the sun, subject to
corruption, is so beautiful, so grand, so rapid in its movement, so
invariable in its course; if its grandeur is in such perfect harmony
with and due proportion to the universe:  if, by the beauty of its
nature, it shines like a brilliant eye in the middle of creation; if
finally, one cannot tire of contemplating it, what will be the beauty of
the Sun of Righteousness? <span id="fr_1569"></span>[1570](#fn_1569.md)  
If the blind man suffers from not seeing the material sun, what a
deprivation is it for the sinner not to enjoy the true light!

<span id="viii.vii-p13"></span>2.  “*And God said, Let there be lights
in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, and to
divide the day from the night*.” <span
id="fr_1570"></span>[1571](#fn_1570.md)   Heaven and earth were the first;
after them was created light; the day had been distinguished from the
night, then had appeared the firmament and the dry element.  The water
had been gathered into the reservoir assigned to it, the earth displayed
its productions, it had caused many kinds of herbs to germinate and it
was adorned with all kinds of plants.  However, the sun and the moon did
not yet exist, in order that those who live in ignorance of God may not
consider the sun as the origin and the father of light, or as the maker
of all that grows out of the earth. <span
id="fr_1571"></span>[1572](#fn_1571.md)   That is why there was a fourth
day, and then God said:  “Let there be lights in the firmament of the
heaven.”

<span id="viii.vii-p16"></span>When once you have learnt Who spoke,
think immediately of the hearer.  God said, “Let there be lights…and God
made two great lights.”  Who spoke? and Who made?  Do you not see a
double person?  Everywhere, in mystic language, history is sown with the
dogmas of theology.

<span id="viii.vii-p17"></span>The motive follows which caused the
lights to be created.  It was to illuminate the earth.  Already light
was created; why therefore say that the sun was created to give light? 
And, first, do not laugh at the strangeness of this expression.  We do
not follow your nicety about words, and we trouble ourselves but little
to give them a harmonious turn.  Our writers do not amuse <span
id="page_83">p. 83</span> <span id="viii.vii-Page_83"></span>themselves
by polishing their periods, and everywhere we prefer clearness of words
to sonorous expressions.  See then if by this expression “to light up,”
the sacred writer sufficiently made his thought understood.  He has put
“to give light” <span id="fr_1572"></span>[1573](#fn_1572.md) instead of
“illumination.” <span id="fr_1573"></span>[1574](#fn_1573.md)   Now there
is nothing here contradictory to what has been said of light.  Then the
actual nature of light was produced:  now the sun’s body is constructed
to be a vehicle for that original light.  A lamp is not fire.  Fire has
the property of illuminating, and we have invented the lamp to light us
in darkness.  In the same way, the luminous bodies have been fashioned
as a vehicle for that pure, clear, and immaterial light.  The Apostle
speaks to us of certain lights which shine in the world <span
id="fr_1574"></span>[1575](#fn_1574.md) without being confounded with the
true light of the world, the possession of which made the saints
luminaries of the souls which they instructed and drew from the darkness
of ignorance.  This is why the Creator of all things, made the sun in
addition to that glorious light, and placed it shining in the heavens.

<span id="viii.vii-p21"></span>3.  And let no one suppose it to be a
thing incredible that the brightness of the light is one thing, and the
body which is its material vehicle is another.  First, in all composite
things, we distinguish substance susceptible of quality, and the quality
which it receives.  The nature of whiteness is one thing, another is
that of the body which is whitened; thus the natures differ which we
have just seen reunited by the power of the Creator.  And do not tell me
that it is impossible to separate them.  Even I do not pretend to be
able to separate light from the body of the sun; but I maintain that
that which we separate in thought, may be separated in reality by the
Creator of nature.  You cannot, moreover, separate the brightness of
fire from the virtue of burning which it possesses; but God, who wished
to attract His servant by a wonderful sight, set a fire in the burning
bush, which displayed all the brilliancy of flame while its devouring
property was dormant.  It is that which the Psalmist affirms in saying
“The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire.” <span
id="fr_1575"></span>[1576](#fn_1575.md)   Thus, in the requital which
awaits us after this life, a mysterious voice seems to tell us that the
double nature of fire will be divided; the just will enjoy its light,
and the torment of its heat will be the torture of the wicked.

<span id="viii.vii-p23"></span>In the revolutions of the moon we find
anew proof of what we have advanced.  When it stops and grows less it
does not consume itself in all its body, but in the measure that it
deposits or absorbs the light which surrounds it, it presents to us the
image of its decrease or of its increase.  If we wish an evident proof
that the moon does not consume its body when at rest, we have only to
open our eyes.  If you look at it in a cloudless and clear sky, you
observe, when it has taken the complete form of a crescent, that the
part, which is dark and not lighted up, describes a circle equal to that
which the full moon forms.  Thus the eye can take in the whole circle,
if it adds to the illuminated part this obscure and dark curve.  And do
not tell me that the light of the moon is borrowed, diminishing or
increasing in proportion as it approaches or recedes from the sun.  That
is not now the object of our research; we only wish to prove that its
body differs from the light which makes it shine.  I wish you to have
the same idea of the sun; except however that the one, after having once
received light and having mixed it with its substance, does not lay it
down again, whilst the other, turn by turn, putting off and reclothing
itself again with light, proves by that which takes place in itself what
we have said of the sun.

<span id="viii.vii-p24"></span>The sun and moon thus received the
command to divide the day from the night.  God had already separated
light from darkness; then He placed their natures in opposition, so that
they could not mingle, and that there could never be anything in common
between darkness and light.  You see what a shadow is during the day;
that is precisely the nature of darkness during the night.  If, at the
appearance of a light, the shadow always falls on the opposite side; if
in the morning it extends towards the setting sun; if in the evening it
inclines towards the rising sun, and at mid-day turns towards the north;
night retires into the regions opposed to the rays of the sun, since it
is by nature only the shadow of the earth.  Because, in the same way
that, during the day, shadow is produced by a body which intercepts the
light, night comes naturally when the air which surrounds the earth is
in shadow.  And this is precisely what Scripture says, “God divided the
light from the darkness.”  Thus darkness fled at the approach of light,
the two being at their first creation divided by a natural antipathy. 
Now God commanded the sun to measure the day, and the moon, whenever she
rounds her disc, to rule the night.  For then these two luminaries are
almost diametrically opposed; when the sun <span id="page_84">p.
84</span> <span id="viii.vii-Page_84"></span>rises, the full moon
disappears from the horizon, to re-appear in the east at the moment the
sun sets.  It matters little to our subject if in other phases the light
of the moon does not correspond exactly with night.  It is none the less
true, that when at its perfection it makes the stars to turn pale and
lightens up the earth with the splendour of its light, it reigns over
the night, and in concert with the sun divides the duration of it in
equal parts.

<span id="viii.vii-p25"></span>4.  “*And let them be for signs, and for
seasons, and for days and years*.” <span
id="fr_1576"></span>[1577](#fn_1576.md)   The signs which the luminaries
give are necessary to human life.  In fact what useful observations will
long experience make us discover, if we ask without undue curiosity! 
What signs of rain, of drought, or of the rising of the wind, partial or
general, violent or moderate!  Our Lord indicates to us one of the signs
given by the sun when He says, “It will be foul weather to-day; for the
sky is red and lowering.” <span id="fr_1577"></span>[1578](#fn_1577.md)  
In fact, when the sun rises through a fog, its rays are darkened, but
the disc appears burning like a coal and of a bloody red colour.  It is
the thickness of the air which causes this appearance; as the rays of
the sun do not disperse such amassed and condensed air, it cannot
certainly be retained by the waves of vapour which exhale from the
earth, and it will cause from superabundance of moisture a storm in the
countries over which it accumulates.  In the same way, when the moon is
surrounded with moisture, or when the sun is encircled with what is
called a halo, it is the sign of heavy rain or of a violent storm;
again, in the same way, if mock suns accompany the sun in its course
they foretell certain celestial phenomena.  Finally, those straight
lines, like the colours of the rainbow, which are seen on the clouds,
announce rain, extraordinary tempests, or, in one word, a complete
change in the weather.

<span id="viii.vii-p28"></span>Those who devote themselves to the
observation of these bodies find signs in the different phases of the
moon, as if the air, by which the earth is enveloped, were obliged to
vary to correspond with its change of form.  Towards the third day of
the new moon, if it is sharp and clear, it is a sign of fixed fine
weather.  If its horns appear thick and reddish it threatens us either
with heavy rain or with a gale from the South. <span
id="fr_1578"></span>[1579](#fn_1578.md)   Who does not know how
useful <span id="fr_1579"></span>[1580](#fn_1579.md) are these signs in
life?  Thanks to them, the sailor keeps back his vessel in the harbour,
foreseeing the perils with which the winds threaten him, and the
traveller beforehand takes shelter from harm, waiting until the weather
has become fairer.  Thanks to them, husbandmen, busy with sowing seed or
cultivating plants, are able to know which seasons are favourable to
their labours.  Further, the Lord has announced to us that at the
dissolution of the universe, signs will appear in the sun, in the moon
and in the stars.  The sun shall be turned into blood and the moon shall
not give her light, <span id="fr_1580"></span>[1581](#fn_1580.md) signs of
the consummation of all things.

<span id="viii.vii-p35"></span>5.  But those who overstep the
borders, <span id="fr_1581"></span>[1582](#fn_1581.md) making the words of
Scripture their apology for the art of casting nativities, pretend that
our lives depend upon the motion of the heavenly bodies, and that thus
the Chaldæans read in the planets that which will happen to us. <span
id="fr_1582"></span>[1583](#fn_1582.md)   By these very simple words “let
them be for signs,” they understand neither the variations of the
weather, nor the change of seasons; they only see in them, at the will
of their imagination, the distribution of human destinies.  What do they
say in reality?  When the planets cross in the signs of the Zodiac,
certain figures formed by their meeting give birth to certain destinies,
and others produce different destinies.

<span id="viii.vii-p38"></span>Perhaps for clearness sake it is not
useless to enter into more detail about this vain science.  I will say
nothing of my own to refute them; I will use their words, bringing a
remedy for the infected, and for others a preservative from falling. 
The inventors of astrology seeing that in the extent of time many signs
escaped them, divided it and enclosed each part in narrow limits, as if
in the least and shortest interval, in a moment, in the twinkling of an
eye, <span id="fr_1583"></span>[1584](#fn_1583.md) to speak with the
Apostle, the greatest difference should be found between one birth and
another.  Such an one is born in this moment; he will be a prince over
cities and will govern the people, <span id="page_85">p. 85</span> <span
id="viii.vii-Page_85"></span>in the fulness of riches and power. 
Another is born the instant after; he will be poor, miserable, and will
wander daily from door to door begging his bread.  Consequently they
divide the Zodiac into twelve parts, and, as the sun takes thirty days
to traverse each of the twelve divisions of this unerring circle, they
divide them into thirty more.  Each of them forms sixty new ones, and
these last are again divided into sixty.  Let us see then if, in
determining the birth of an infant, it will be possible to observe this
rigorous division of time.  The child is born.  The nurse ascertains the
sex; then she awaits the wail which is a sign of its life.  Until then
how many moments have passed do you think?  The nurse announces the
birth of the child to the Chaldæan:  how many minutes would you count
before she opens her mouth, especially if he who records the hour is
outside the women’s apartments?  And we know that he who consults the
dial, ought, whether by day or by night, to mark the hour with the most
precise exactitude.  What a swarm of seconds passes during this time! 
For the planet of nativity ought to be found, not only in one of the
twelve divisions of the Zodiac, and even in one of its first
subdivisions, but again in one of the sixtieth parts which divide this
last, and even, to arrive at the exact truth, in one of the sixtieth
subdivisions that this contains in its turn.  And to obtain such minute
knowledge, so impossible to grasp from this moment, each planet must be
questioned to find its position as regards the signs of the Zodiac and
the figures that the planets form at the moment of the child’s birth. 
Thus, if it is impossible to find exactly the hour of birth, and if the
least change can upset all, then both those who give themselves up to
this imaginary science and those who listen to them open-mouthed, as if
they could learn from them the future, are supremely ridiculous.

<span id="viii.vii-p40"></span>6.  But what effects are produced?  Such
an one will have curly hair and bright eyes, because he is born under
the Ram; such is the appearance of a ram.  He will have noble feelings;
because the Ram is born to command.  He will be liberal and fertile in
resources, because this animal gets rid of its fleece without trouble,
and nature immediately hastens to reclothe it.  Another is born under
the Bull:  he will be enured to hardship and of a slavish character,
because the bull bows under the yoke.  Another is born under the
Scorpion; like to this venomous reptile he will be a striker.  He who is
born under the Balance will be just, thanks to the justness of our
balances.  Is not this the height of folly?  This Ram, from whence you
draw the nativity of man, is the twelfth part of the heaven, and in
entering into it the sun reaches the spring.  The Balance and the Bull
are likewise twelfth parts of the Zodiac.  How can you see there the
principal causes which influence the life of man?  And why do you take
animals to characterize the manners of men who enter this world?  He who
is born under the Ram will be liberal, not because this part of heaven
gives this characteristic, but because such is the nature of the beast. 
Why then should we frighten ourselves by the names of these stars and
undertake to persuade ourselves with these bleatings?  If heaven has
different characteristics derived from these animals, it is then itself
subject to external influences since its causes depend on the brutes who
graze in our fields.  A ridiculous assertion; but how much more
ridiculous the pretence of arriving at the influence on each other of
things which have not the least connexion!  This pretended science is a
true spider’s web; if a gnat or a fly, or some insect equally feeble
falls into it it is held entangled; if a stronger animal approaches, it
passes through without trouble, carrying the weak tissue away with
it. <span id="fr_1584"></span>[1585](#fn_1584.md)

<span id="viii.vii-p42"></span>7.  They do not, however, stop here; even
our acts, where each one feels his will ruling, I mean, the practice of
virtue or of vice, depend, according to them, on the influence of
celestial bodies.  It would be ridiculous seriously to refute such an
error, but, as it holds a great many in its nets, perhaps it is better
not to pass it over in silence.  I would first ask them if the figures
which the stars describe do not change a thousand times a day.  In the
perpetual motion of planets, some meet in a more rapid course, others
make slower revolutions, and often in an hour we see them look at each
other and then hide themselves.  Now, at the hour of birth, it is very
important whether one is looked upon by a beneficent star or by an evil
one, to speak their language.  Often then the astrologers do not seize
the moment when a good star shows itself, and, on account of having let
this fugitive moment escape, they enrol the newborn under the influence
of a bad genius.  I am compelled to use their own words.  What madness! 
But, above all, what impiety!  For the evil stars throw the blame of
their wickedness upon Him Who made them.  If evil is inherent in their
nature, the <span id="page_86">p. 86</span> <span
id="viii.vii-Page_86"></span>Creator is the author of evil.  If they
make it themselves, they are animals endowed with the power of choice,
whose acts will be free and voluntary.  Is it not the height of folly to
tell these lies about beings without souls?  Again, what a want of sense
does it show to distribute good and evil without regard to personal
merit; to say that a star is beneficent because it occupies a certain
place; that it becomes evil, because it is viewed by another star; and
that if it moves ever so little from this figure it loses its malign
influence.

<span id="viii.vii-p43"></span>But let us pass on.  If, at every instant
of duration, the stars vary their figures, then in these thousand
changes, many times a day, there ought to be reproduced the
configuration of royal births.  Why then does not every day see the
birth of a king?  Why is there a succession on the throne from father to
son?  Without doubt there has never been a king who has taken measures
to have his son born under the star of royalty.  For what man possesses
such a power?  How then did Uzziah beget Jotham, Jotham Ahaz, Ahaz
Hezekiah?  And by what chance did the birth of none of them happen in an
hour of slavery?  If the origin of our virtues and of our vices is not
in ourselves, but is the fatal consequence of our birth, it is useless
for legislators to prescribe for us what we ought to do, and what we
ought to avoid; it is useless for judges to honour virtue and to punish
vice.  The guilt is not in the robber, not in the assassin:  it was
willed for him; it was impossible for him to hold back his hand, urged
to evil by inevitable necessity.  Those who laboriously cultivate the
arts are the maddest of men.  The labourer will make an abundant harvest
without sowing seed and without sharpening his sickle.  Whether he
wishes it or not, the merchant will make his fortune, and will be
flooded with riches by fate.  As for us Christians, we shall see our
great hopes vanish, since from the moment that man does not act with
freedom, there is neither reward for justice, nor punishment for sin. 
Under the reign of necessity and of fatality there is no place for
merit, the first condition of all righteous judgment.  But let us stop. 
You who are sound in yourselves have no need to hear more, and time does
not allow us to make attacks without limit against these unhappy men.

<span id="viii.vii-p44"></span>8.  Let us return to the words which
follow.  “Let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and
years.” <span id="fr_1585"></span>[1586](#fn_1585.md)   We have spoken
about signs.  By times, we understand the succession of seasons, winter,
spring, summer and autumn, which we see follow each other in so regular
a course, thanks to the regularity of the movement of the luminaries. 
It is winter when the sun sojourns in the south and produces in
abundance the shades of night in our region.  The air spread over the
earth is chilly, and the damp exhalations, which gather over our heads,
give rise to rains, to frosts, to innumerable flakes of snow.  When,
returning from the southern regions, the sun is in the middle of the
heavens and divides day and night into equal parts, the more it sojourns
above the earth the more it brings back a mild temperature to us.  Then
comes spring, which makes all the plants germinate, and gives to the
greater part of the trees their new life, and, by successive generation,
perpetuates all the land and water animals.  From thence the sun,
returning to the summer solstice, in the direction of the North, gives
us the longest days.  And, as it travels farther in the air, it burns
that which is over our heads, dries up the earth, ripens the grains and
hastens the maturity of the fruits of the trees.  At the epoch of its
greatest heat, the shadows which the sun makes at mid-day are short,
because it shines from above, from the air over our heads.  Thus the
longest days are those when the shadows are shortest, in the same way
that the shortest days are those when the shadows are longest.  It is
this which happens to all of us “Hetero-skii” <span
id="fr_1586"></span>[1587](#fn_1586) (shadowed-on-one-side.md) who inhabit
the northern regions of the earth.  But there are people who, two days
in the year, are completely without shade at mid-day, because the sun,
being perpendicularly over their heads, lights them so equally from all
sides, that it could through a narrow opening shine at the bottom of a
well.  Thus there are some who call them “askii” (shadowless).  For
those who live beyond the land of spices <span
id="fr_1587"></span>[1588](#fn_1587.md) see their shadow now on one side,
now on another, the only inhabitants of this land of which the shade
falls at mid-day; thus they are given the name of “amphiskii,” <span
id="fr_1588"></span>[1589](#fn_1588.md) (shadowed-on-both-<span
id="page_87">p. 87</span> <span id="viii.vii-Page_87"></span>sides ). 
All these phenomena happen whilst the sun is passing into northern
regions:  they give us an idea of the heat thrown on the air, by the
rays of the sun and of the effects that they produce.  Next we pass to
autumn, which breaks up the excessive heat, lessening the warmth little
by little, and by a moderate temperature brings us back without
suffering to winter, to the time when the sun returns from the northern
regions to the southern.  It is thus that seasons, following the course
of the sun, succeed each other to rule our life.

<span id="viii.vii-p51"></span>“Let them be for days” <span
id="fr_1589"></span>[1590](#fn_1589.md) says Scripture, not to produce them
but to rule them; because day and night are older than the creation of
the luminaries and it is this that the psalm declares to us.  “The sun
to rule by day…the moon and stars to rule by night.” <span
id="fr_1590"></span>[1591](#fn_1590.md)   How does the sun rule by day? 
Because carrying everywhere light with it, it is no sooner risen above
the horizon than it drives away darkness and brings us day.  Thus we
might, without self deception, define day as air lighted by the sun, or
as the space of time that the sun passes in our hemisphere.  The
functions of the sun and moon serve further to mark years.  The moon,
after having twelve times run her course, forms a year which sometimes
needs an intercalary month to make it exactly agree with the seasons. 
Such was formerly the year of the Hebrews and of the early Greeks. <span
id="fr_1591"></span>[1592](#fn_1591.md)   As to the solar year, it is the
time that the sun, having started from a certain sign, takes to return
to it in its normal progress.

<span id="viii.vii-p55"></span>9.  “*And God made two great
lights*.” <span id="fr_1592"></span>[1593](#fn_1592.md)   The word “great,”
if, for example we say it of the heaven of the earth or of the sea, may
have an absolute sense; but ordinarily it has only a relative meaning,
as a great horse, or a great ox.  It is not that these animals are of an
immoderate size, but that in comparison with their like they deserve the
title of great.  What idea shall we ourselves form here of greatness? 
Shall it be the idea that we have of it in the ant and in all the little
creatures of nature, which we call great in comparison with those like
themselves, and to show their superiority over them?  Or shall we
predicate greatness of the luminaries, as of the natural greatness
inherent in them?  As for me, I think so.  If the sun and moon are
great, it is not in comparison with the smaller stars, but because they
have such a circumference that the splendour which they diffuse lights
up the heavens and the air, embracing at the same time earth and sea. 
In whatever part of heaven they may be, whether rising, or setting, or
in mid heaven, they appear always the same in the eyes of men, a
manifest proof of their prodigious size.  For the whole extent of heaven
cannot make them appear greater in one place and smaller in another. 
Objects which we see afar off appear dwarfed to our eyes, and in measure
as they approach us we can form a juster idea of their size.  But there
is no one who can be nearer or more distant from the sun.  All the
inhabitants of the earth see it at the same distance.  Indians and
Britons see it of the same size.  The people of the East do not see it
decrease in magnitude when it sets; those of the West do not find it
smaller when it rises.  If it is in the middle of the heavens it does
not vary in either aspect.  Do not be deceived by mere appearance, and
because it looks a cubit’s breadth, imagine it to be no bigger. <span
id="fr_1593"></span>[1594](#fn_1593.md)   At a very great distance objects
always lose size in our eyes; sight, not being able to clear the
intermediary space, is as it were exhausted in the middle of its course,
and only a small part of it reaches the visible object. <span
id="fr_1594"></span>[1595](#fn_1594.md)   Our power of sight is small and
makes all we see seem small, affecting what it sees by its own
condition.  Thus, then, if sight is mistaken its testimony is fallible. 
Recall your own impressions and you will find in yourself the proof of
my words.  If you have ever from the top of a high mountain looked at a
large and level plain, how big did the yokes of oxen appear to <span
id="page_88">p. 88</span> <span id="viii.vii-Page_88"></span>you?  How
big were the ploughmen themselves?  Did they not look like ants? <span
id="fr_1595"></span>[1596](#fn_1595.md)   If from the top of a commanding
rock, looking over the wide sea, you cast your eyes over the vast extent
how big did the greatest islands appear to you?  How large did one of
those barks of great tonnage, which unfurl their white sails to the blue
sea, appear to you.  Did it not look smaller than a dove?  It is because
sight, as I have just told you, loses itself in the air, becomes weak
and cannot seize with exactness the object which it sees.  And further: 
your sight shows you high mountains intersected by valleys as rounded
and smooth, because it reaches only to the salient parts, and is not
able, on account of its weakness, to penetrate into the valleys which
separate them.  It does not even preserve the form of objects, and
thinks that all square towers are round.  Thus all proves that at a
great distance sight only presents to us obscure and confused objects. 
The luminary is then great, according to the witness of Scripture, and
infinitely greater than it appears.

<span id="viii.vii-p60"></span>10.  See again another evident proof of
its greatness.  Although the heaven may be full of stars without number,
the light contributed by them all could not disperse the gloom of
night.  The sun alone, from the time that it appeared on the horizon,
while it was still expected and had not yet risen completely above the
earth, dispersed the darkness, outshone the stars, dissolved and
diffused the air, which was hitherto thick and condensed over our heads,
and produced thus the morning breeze and the dew which in fine weather
streams over the earth.  Could the earth with such a wide extent be
lighted up entirely in one moment if an immense disc were not pouring
forth its light over it?  Recognise here the wisdom of the Artificer. 
See how He made the heat of the sun proportionate to this distance.  Its
heat is so regulated that it neither consumes the earth by excess, nor
lets it grow cold and sterile by defect.

<span id="viii.vii-p61"></span>To all this the properties of the moon
are near akin; she, too, has an immense body, whose splendour only
yields to that of the sun.  Our eyes, however, do not always see her in
her full size.  Now she presents a perfectly rounded disc, now when
diminished and lessened she shows a deficiency on one side.  When waxing
she is shadowed on one side, and when she is waning another side is
hidden.  Now it is not without a secret reason of the divine Maker of
the universe, that the moon appears from time to time under such
different forms.  It presents a striking example of our nature.  Nothing
is stable in man; here from nothingness he raises himself to perfection;
there after having hasted to put forth his strength to attain his full
greatness he suddenly is subject to gradual deterioration, and is
destroyed by diminution.  Thus, the sight of the moon, making us think
of the rapid vicissitudes of human things, ought to teach us not to
pride ourselves on the good things of this life, and not to glory in our
power, not to be carried away by uncertain riches, to despise our flesh
which is subject to change, and to take care of the soul, for its good
is unmoved.  If you cannot behold without sadness the moon losing its
splendour by gradual and imperceptible decrease, how much more
distressed should you be at the sight of a soul, who, after having
possessed virtue, loses its beauty by neglect, and does not remain
constant to its affections, but is agitated and constantly changes
because its purposes are unstable.  What Scripture says is very true,
“As for a fool he changeth as the moon.” <span
id="fr_1596"></span>[1597](#fn_1596.md)

<span id="viii.vii-p63"></span>I believe also that the variations of the
moon do not take place without exerting great influence upon the
organization of animals and of all living things.  This is because
bodies are differently disposed at its waxing and waning.  When she
wanes they lose their density and become void.  When she waxes and is
approaching her fulness they appear to fill themselves at the same time
with her, thanks to an imperceptible moisture that she emits mixed with
heat, which penetrates everywhere. <span
id="fr_1597"></span>[1598](#fn_1597.md)   For proof, see how those who
sleep under the moon feel abundant moisture filling their heads; <span
id="fr_1598"></span>[1599](#fn_1598.md) see how fresh meat is quickly
turned under the action of the moon; <span
id="fr_1599"></span>[1600](#fn_1599.md) see the brain of animals, the
moistest part of marine animals, the pith of trees.  Evidently the moon
must be, as Scripture says, of enormous size and power to make all
nature thus participate in her changes.

<span id="viii.vii-p71"></span>11.  On its variations depends also the
condition of the air, as is proved by sudden dis<span id="page_89">p.
89</span> <span id="viii.vii-Page_89"></span>turbances which often come
after the new moon, in the midst of a calm and of a stillness in the
winds, to agitate the clouds and to hurl them against each other; as the
flux and reflux in straits, and the ebb and flow of the ocean prove, so
that those who live on its shores see it regularly following the
revolutions of the moon.  The waters of straits approach and retreat
from one shore to the other during the different phases of the moon;
but, when she is new, they have not an instant of rest, and move in
perpetual swaying to and fro, until the moon, reappearing, regulates
their reflux.  As to the Western sea, <span
id="fr_1600"></span>[1601](#fn_1600.md) we see it in its ebb and flow now
return into its bed, and now overflow, as the moon draws it back by her
respiration and then, by her expiration, urges it to its own
boundaries. <span id="fr_1601"></span>[1602](#fn_1601.md)

<span id="viii.vii-p74"></span>I have entered into these details, to
show you the grandeur of the luminaries, and to make you see that, in
the inspired words, there is not one idle syllable.  And yet my sermon
has scarcely touched on any important point; there are many other
discoveries about the size and distance of the sun and moon to which any
one who will make a serious study of their action and of their
characteristics may arrive by the aid of reason.  Let me then
ingenuously make an avowal of my weakness, for fear that you should
measure the mighty works of the Creator by my words.  The little that I
have said ought the rather to make you conjecture the marvels on which I
have omitted to dwell.  We must not then measure the moon with the eye,
but with the reason.  Reason, for the discovery of truth, is much surer
than the eye.

<span id="viii.vii-p75"></span>Everywhere ridiculous old women’s tales,
imagined in the delirium of drunkenness, have been circulated; such as
that enchantments can remove the moon from its place and make it descend
to the earth.  How could a magician’s charm shake that of which the Most
High has laid the foundations?  And if once torn out what place could
hold it? <span id="fr_1602"></span>[1603](#fn_1602.md)

<span id="viii.vii-p80"></span>Do you wish from slight indications to
have a proof of the moon’s size?  All the towns in the world, however
distant from each other, equally receive the light from the moon in
those streets that are turned towards its rising.  If she did not look
on all face to face, those only would be entirely lighted up which were
exactly opposite; as to those beyond the extremities of her disc, they
would only receive diverted and oblique rays.  It is this effect which
the light of lamps produces in houses; if a lamp is surrounded by
several persons, only the shadow of the person who is directly opposite
to it is cast in a straight line, the others follow inclined lines on
each side.  In the same way, if the body of the moon were not of an
immense and prodigious size she could not extend herself alike to all. 
In reality, when the moon rises in the equinoctial regions, all equally
enjoy her light, both those who inhabit the icy zone, under the
revolutions of the Bear, and those who dwell in the extreme south in the
neighbourhood of the torrid zone.  She gives us an idea of her size by
appearing to be face to face with all people.  Who then can deny the
immensity of a body which divides itself equally over such a wide
extent?

<span id="viii.vii-p81"></span>But enough on the greatness of the sun
and moon.  May He Who has given us intelligence to recognise in the
smallest objects of creation the great wisdom of the Contriver make us
find in great bodies a still higher idea of their Creator.  However,
compared with their Author, the sun and moon are but a fly and an ant. 
The whole universe cannot give us a right idea of the greatness of God;
and it is only by signs, weak and slight in themselves, often by the
help of the smallest insects and of the least plants, that we raise
ourselves to Him.  Content with these words let us offer our thanks, I
to Him who has given me the ministry of the Word, you to Him who feeds
you with spiritual food; Who, even at this moment, makes you find in my
weak voice the strength of barley bread.  May He feed you for ever, and
in proportion to your faith grant you the manifestation of the
Spirit <span id="fr_1603"></span>[1604](#fn_1603.md) in Jesus Christ our
Lord, to whom be glory and power for ever and ever.  Amen.

<span id="viii.vii-p57"></span> “*Tertia ex utroque vastitas solis
aperitur, ut non sit necesse amplitudinem ejus oculorum argumentis,
atque conjectura animi scrutari:  immensum esse quia arborum in
limitibus porrectarum in quotlibet passuum millia umbras paribus jaciat
intervallis, tanquam toto spatio medius:  et quia per æquinoctium
omnibus in meridiana plaga habitantibus, simul fiat a vertice:  ita quia
circa solstitialem circulum habitantium meridie ad Septemtrionem umbræ
cadant, ortu vero ad occasum.  Quæ fieri nullo modo possent nisi multo
quam terra major esset*.”  Plin. ii. 8.

<span id="viii.vii-p59"></span> Plato (*Phæd*. § 133) makes the same

himself *in loc*.  Virg., *Georg*. iii. 337, *“Roscida Luna,*” and
Statius, *Theb*. i. 336:

<span id="viii.vii-p68"></span> The baleful influence of “*iracunda
Diana*” (Hor., *De Art. Poet*. 454) is an early belief, not yet
extinct.  *cf*. the term <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.vii-p68.1"></span>σελήνιασμός</span> for epilepsy, and
“*lunaticus*” for the “moonstruck” madman.  *Vide* Cass., *Quæst. Med*.
xxv. 1.  Perowne on [Ps. cxxi. 6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#006.md)<span
id="viii.vii-p68.2"></span> notes, “De Wette refers to Andersen’s
*Eastern Travels* in proof that this opinion is commonly entertained. 
Delitzsch mentions having heard from Texas that the consequence of
sleeping in the open air, when the moon was shining, was mental
aberration, dizziness, and even death.”

<span id="viii.vii-p69"></span>“*<span id="viii.vii-p69.1"></span>Dass
auch der Mond in heller Nacht dem ohne gehörigen Schutz Schlafenden
schaden könne ist allgemeine Meinung des Orients und der köhlen Nächte

<span id="viii.vii-p70"></span> A fact, however explained.  Plutarch
(*Sympos. Prob*. iii. 10) discusses the question <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.vii-p70.1"></span>Διὰ τί τὰ κρέα σήπεται
μᾶλλον ὑπὸ τὴν σελήνην ἢ τὸν ἥλιον</span>, and refers the decomposition
to the moistening influence of the moon.  “Air, moisture, and a certain
degree of warmth, are necessary to the decay of animal bodies…where
moisture continues present—even though warmth and air be in a great
measure excluded—decay still slowly takes place.”  J. F. W. Johnston,
*Chemistry of Common Life*, ii. 273.

<span id="viii.vii-p73"></span> Pytheas, of Marseilles, is first named
as attributing the tides to the moon.  Plut. <span class="Greek"><span

Durat tamen tradita persuasio in magna parte vulgi, veneficiis et herbis

it was a custom to avert the spells of sorceresses, which might bring
the eclipsed moon to the ground, by beating brass and shouting.  *cf*.
