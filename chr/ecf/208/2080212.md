<span id="ix.cxl-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cxl-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXXIX. <span
id="fr_2455"></span>[2456](#fn_2455.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cxl-p3"></span>*To the Alexandrians*. <span
id="fr_2456"></span>[2457](#fn_2456.md)

<span id="ix.cxl-p5"></span>1.  I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxl-p5.1"></span>have</span> already heard of the persecution in
Alexandria and the rest of Egypt, and, as might be expected, I am deeply
affected.  I have observed the ingenuity of the devil’s mode of
warfare.  When he saw that the Church increased under the persecution of
enemies and flourished all the more, he changed his plan.  He no longer
carries on an open warfare, but lays secret snares against us, hiding
his hostility under the name which they bear, in order that we may both
suffer like our fathers, and, at the same time, seem not to suffer for
Christ’s sake, because our persecutors too bear the name of Christians. 
With these thoughts for a long time we sat still, dazed at the news of
what had happened, for, in sober earnest, both our ears tingled on
hearing of the shameless and inhuman heresy of your persecutors.  They
have reverenced neither age, nor services to society, <span
id="fr_2457"></span>[2458](#fn_2457.md) nor people’s affection.  They
inflicted torture, ignominy, and exile; they plundered all the property
they could find; they were careless alike of human condemnation and of
the awful retribution to come at the hands of the righteous Judge.  All
this has amazed me and all but driven me out of my senses.  To my
reflections has been added this thought too; can the Lord have wholly
abandoned His Churches?  Has the last hour come, and is “the falling
away” thus coming upon us, that now the lawless one “may be revealed,
the son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is
called God and is worshipped”? <span
id="fr_2458"></span>[2459](#fn_2458.md)   But if the temptation is for a
season, bear it, ye noble athletes of Christ.  If the world is being
delivered to complete, and final destruction, let us not lose heart for
the present, but let us await the revelation from heaven, and the
manifestation of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ.  If all
creation is to be dissolved, and the fashion of this world transformed,
why should we be surprised that we, who are apart of creation, should
feel the general woe, and be delivered to afflictions which our just God
inflicts on us according to the measure of our strength, not letting us
“be tempted above that we are able, but with the temptation giving us a
way to escape that we may be able to bear it”? <span
id="fr_2459"></span>[2460](#fn_2459.md)   Brothers, martyrs’ crowns await
you.  The companies of the confessors are ready to reach out their hands
to you and to welcome you into their own ranks.  Remember how none of
the saints of old won their crowns of patient endurance by living
luxuriously and being courted; but all were tested by being put through
the fire of great afflictions.  “For some had trial of cruel mockings
and scourgings, and others were sawn asunder and were slain with the
sword.” <span id="fr_2460"></span>[2461](#fn_2460.md)   These are the
glories of saints.  Blessed is he who is deemed worthy to suffer for
Christ; more blessed is he whose sufferings are greater, since “the
sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the
glory that shall be revealed in us.” <span
id="fr_2461"></span>[2462](#fn_2461.md)

<span id="ix.cxl-p11"></span>2.  Had it but been possible for me to
travel to you I should have liked nothing better than to meet you, that
I might see and embrace Christ’s athletes, and share your prayers and
spiritual graces.  But now my body is wasted by long sickness, so that I
can scarcely even leave my bed, and there are many who are lying in wait
for me, like ravening wolves, watching the moment when they may be able
to rend Christ’s sheep.  I have therefore been compelled to visit you by
letter; and I exhort you first of all most earnestly to pray for me,
that for the rest of my remaining days or hours I may be enabled to
serve the Lord, in accordance with the gospel of His kingdom.  Next I
beg you to pardon me for my absence and for my delay in writing to you. 
I have only with great difficulty found a man able to carry out my
wishes.  I speak of my son, the monk Eugenius, by whom I beseech you to
pray for me and for the whole Church, and to write back news of you so
that, when I hear, I may be more cheerful.
