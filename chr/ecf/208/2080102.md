<span id="ix.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.xxx-p1.1"></span>Letter XXIX. <span
id="fr_1999"></span>[2000](#fn_1999.md) </span>

<span id="ix.xxx-p3"></span>*To the Church of Ancyra. 
Consolatory*. <span id="fr_2000"></span>[2001](#fn_2000.md)

<span id="ix.xxx-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xxx-p5.1"></span>My</span> amazement at the most distressing news
of the calamity which has befallen you for a long time kept me silent. 
I felt like a man whose ears are stunned by a loud clap of thunder. 
Then I somehow recovered a little from my state of speechlessness.  Now
I have mourned, as none could help mourning, over the event, and, in the
midst of my lamentations, have sent you this letter.  I write not so
much to console you,—for who could find words to cure a calamity so
great?—<span id="page_134">p. 134</span> <span
id="ix.xxx-Page_134"></span>as to signify to you, as well as I can by
these means, the agony of my own heart.  I need now the lamentations of
Jeremiah, or of any other of the Saints who has feelingly lamented a
great woe.  A man has fallen who was really a pillar and stay of the
Church or rather he himself has been taken from us and is gone to the
blessed life, and there is no small danger lest many at the removal of
this prop from under them fall too, and lest some men’s unsoundness be
brought to light.  A mouth is sealed gushing with righteous eloquence
and words of grace to the edification of the brotherhood.  Gone are the
counsels of a mind which truly moved in God.  Ah! how often, for I must
accuse myself, was it my lot to feel indignation against him, because,
wholly desiring to depart and be with Christ, he did not prefer for our
sakes to remain in the flesh! <span id="fr_2001"></span>[2002](#fn_2001.md)
  To whom for the future shall I commit the cares of the Churches?  Whom
shall I take to share my troubles?  Whom to participate in my gladness? 
O loneliness terrible and sad!  How am I not like to a pelican of the
wilderness? <span id="fr_2002"></span>[2003](#fn_2002.md)   Yet of a truth
the members of the Church, united by his leadership as by one soul, and
fitted together into close union of feeling and fellowship, are both
preserved and shall ever be preserved by the bond of peace for spiritual
communion.  God grants us the boon, that all the works of that blessed
soul, which he did nobly in the churches of God, abide firm and
immovable.  But the struggle is no slight one, lest, once more strifes
and divisions arising over the choice of the bishop, all your work be
upset by some quarrel.
