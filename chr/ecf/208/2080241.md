<span id="ix.clxix-p3"></span>*To Antiochus*. <span

<span id="ix.clxix-p5"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxix-p5.1"></span>mourn</span> for the Church that is deprived
of the guidance of such a shepherd. <span
id="fr_2557"></span>[2558](#fn_2557)   But I have so much the more
ground for congratulating you on being worthy of the privilege of
enjoying, at such a moment, the society of one who is fighting such a
good fight in the cause of the truth, and I am sure that you, who nobly
support and stimulate his zeal, will be thought worthy by the Lord of a
lot like his.  What a blessing, to enjoy in unbroken quiet the society
of the man so rich in learning and experienced in life!  Now, at least,
you must, I am sure, know how wise he is.  In days gone by his mind was
necessarily given to many divided cares, and you were too busy a man to
give your sole heed to the spiritual fountain which springs from his
pure heart.  God grant that you may be a comfort to him, and never
yourself want consolation from others.  I am sure of the disposition of
your heart, alike from the experience which I, for a short time, have
had of you, and from the exalted teaching your illustrious instructor,
with whom to pass one single day is a sufficient provision for the
journey to salvation.

<span id="ix.clxix-p6"></span> Eusebius was now in exile in Thrace.  On
this picturesque scene of his forced departure from his diocese, the
agony of his flock at losing him, and his calm submission to the tyranny
of Valens, see Theodoret iv. 12 and 13, pp. 115, 116, of this edition.
