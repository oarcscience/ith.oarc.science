<span id="ix.xxxvi-p4"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xxxvi-p4.1"></span>have</span> written to you about many people
as belonging to myself; now I mean to write about more.  The poor can
never fail, and I can never say, no.  There is no one more intimately
associated with me, nor better able to do me kindnesses wherever he has
the ability, than the reverend brother Leontius.  So treat his house as
if you had found me, not in that poverty in which now by God’s help I am
living, but endowed with wealth and landed property.  There is no doubt
that you would not have made me poor, but would have taken care of what
I had, or even added to my possessions.  This is the way I ask you to
behave in the house of Leontius.  You will get your accustomed reward
from me; my prayers to the holy God for the trouble you are taking in
shewing yourself a good man and true, and in anticipating the
supplication of the needy.
