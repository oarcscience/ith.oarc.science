<span id="ix.clxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.clxxiii-p1.1"></span>Letter CLXXII. <span
id="fr_2567"></span>[2568](#fn_2567.md) </span>

<span id="ix.clxxiii-p3"></span>*To Sophronius, the bishop*. <span
id="fr_2568"></span>[2569](#fn_2568.md)

<span id="ix.clxxiii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxxiii-p5.1"></span>There</span> is no need for me to say how
much I was delighted by your letter.  Your own <span id="page_219">p.
219</span> <span id="ix.clxxiii-Page_219"></span>words will enable you
to conjecture what I felt on receiving it.  You have exhibited to me in
your letter, the first fruits of the Spirit, love.  Than this what can
be more precious to me in the present state of affairs, when, because
iniquity abounds, the love of many has waxed cold? <span
id="fr_2569"></span>[2570](#fn_2569.md)   Nothing is rarer now than
spiritual intercourse with a brother, a word of peace, and such
spiritual communion as I have found in you.  For this I thank the Lord,
beseeching Him that I may have part in the perfect joy that is found in
you.  If such be your letter, what must it be to meet you in person?  If
when you are far away you so affect me, what will you be to me when you
are seen face to face?  Be sure that if I had not been detained by
innumerable occupations, and all the unavoidable anxieties which tie me
down, I should have hurried to see your excellency.  Although that old
complaint of mine is a great hindrance to my moving about, nevertheless
in view of the good I expect, I would not have allowed this to stand in
my way.  To be permitted to meet a man holding the same views and
reverencing the faith of the Fathers, as you are said to do by our
honourable brethren and fellow presbyters, is in truth to go back to the
ancient blessedness of the Churches, when the sufferers from unsound
disputation were few, and all lived in peace, “workmen” obeying the
commandments and not “needing to be ashamed,” <span
id="fr_2570"></span>[2571](#fn_2570.md) serving the Lord with simple and
clear confession, and keeping plain and inviolate their faith in Father,
Son and Holy Ghost.
