id="fr_3029"></span>[3030](#fn_3029.md) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxliii-p3"></span>*To the Westerns*. <span
id="fr_3030"></span>[3031](#fn_3030.md)

<span id="ix.ccxliii-p5"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxliii-p5.1"></span>The</span> Holy God has promised a happy of
issue out of all their infirmities to those that trust in Him.  We,
therefore, though we have been cut off in a mid-ocean of troubles,
though we are tossed by the great waves raised up against us by the
spirits of wickedness, nevertheless hold out in Christ Who strengthens
us.  We have not slackened the strength of our zeal for the Churches,
nor, as though despairing of our salvation, while the billows in the
tempest rise above our heads, do we look to be destroyed.  On the
contrary, we are still holding out with all possible earnestness,
remembering how even he who was swallowed by the sea monster, because he
did not despair of his life, but cried to the Lord, was saved.  Thus too
we, though we have reached the last pitch of peril, do not give up our
hope in God.  On every side we see His succour round about us.  For
these reasons now we turn our eyes to you, right honourable brethren. 
In many an hour of our affliction we have expected that you would be at
our side; and disappointed in that hope we have said to ourselves, “I
looked for some to take pity and there was none; and for comforters but
I found none.” <span id="fr_3031"></span>[3032](#fn_3031.md)   Our
sufferings are such as to have reached the confines of the empire; and
since, when one member suffers, all the members suffer, <span
id="fr_3032"></span>[3033](#fn_3032.md) it is doubtless right that your
pity should be shown to us who have been so long in trouble.  For that
sympathy, which we have hoped you of your charity feel for us, is caused
less by nearness of place than by union of spirit.

<span id="ix.ccxliii-p8"></span>2.  How comes it to pass then that we
have received nothing of what is due to us by the law of love; no letter
of consolation, no visit from brethren?  This is now the thirteenth year
since the war of heresy began against us. <span
id="fr_3033"></span>[3034](#fn_3033.md)   In this the Churches have
suffered more tribulations than all those which are on record since
Christ’s gospel was first preached. <span
id="fr_3034"></span>[3035](#fn_3034.md)   I am unwilling to de<span
id="page_283">p. 283</span> <span id="ix.ccxliii-Page_283"></span>scribe
these one by one, lest the feebleness of my narrative should make the
evidence of the calamities less convincing.  It is moreover the less
necessary for me to tell you of them, because you have long known what
has happened from the reports which will have reached you.  The sum and
substance of our troubles is this:  the people have left the houses of
prayer and are holding congregations in the wildernesses.  It is a sad
sight.  Women, boys, old men, and those who are in other ways infirm,
remain in the open air, in heavy rain, in the snow, the gales and the
frost of winter as well as in summer under the blazing heat of the sun. 
All this they are suffering because they refuse to have anything to do
with the wicked leaven of Arius.

<span id="ix.ccxliii-p11"></span>3.  How could mere words give you any
clear idea of all this without your being stirred to sympathy by
personal experience and the evidence of eyewitnesses?  We implore you,
therefore, to stretch out a helping hand to those that have already been
stricken to the ground, and to send messengers to remind us of the
prizes in store for the reward of all who patiently suffer for Christ. 
A voice that we are used to is naturally less able to comfort us than
one which sounds from afar, and that one coming from men who over all
the world are known by God’s grace to be among the noblest; for common
report everywhere represents you as having remained steadfast, without
suffering a wound in your faith, and as having kept the deposit of the
apostles inviolate.  This is not our case.  There are among us some who,
through lust of glory and that puffing up which is especially wont to
destroy the souls of Christian men, have audaciously uttered certain
novelties of expression with the result that the Churches have become
like cracked pots and pans and have let in the inrush of heretical
impurity.  But do you, whom we love and long for, be to us as surgeons
for the wounded, as trainers for the whole, healing the limb that is
diseased, and anointing the limb that is sound for the service of the
true religion.

<span id="ix.ccxliii-p4"></span> This and the following letter refer to
the earlier of two missions of Dorotheus to the West.  In the latter he
carried *Letter* cclxiii.  The earlier was successful at least to the
extent of winning sympathy.  Maran (*Vit. Bas. cap.* xxxv.) places it
not earlier than the Easter of 376, and objects to the earlier date
assigned by Tillemont.

<span id="ix.ccxliii-p9"></span> Valens began the thirteenth year of his
reign in the March of 376, and this fact is one of Maran’s reasons for
placing this letter where he does.  Tillemont reckons the thirteen years
from 361 to 374, but Maran points out that if the Easterns had wanted to
include the persecution of Constantius they might have gone farther
back, while even then the lull under Julian would have broken the
continuity of the attack.  *Vit. Bas.* xxxv.  *cf*. note on p. 48.

<span id="fn_3034"></span>[282:3035](2080315.htm#fr_3034.md) <span
id="ix.ccxliii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ccxliii-p10"></span> A rhetorical expression not to be
taken literally.  Some of the enormities committed under Valens, *e.g.*
the alleged massacre of the Orthodox delegates off Bithynia in 370 (Soz.
vi. 14, Theod. iv. 21), would stand out even when matched with the
cruelties perpetrated under Nero and Diocletian, if the evidence for
them were satisfactory.  *cf*. Milman, *Hist. Christ*. iii. 45.  The
main difference between the earlier persecutions, conventionally
reckoned as ten, and the persecution of the Catholics by Valens, seems
to be this, that while the former were a putting in force of the law
against a *religio non licita*, the latter was but the occasional result
of the personal spite and partizanship of the imperial heretic and his
courtiers.  Valens would feel bitterly towards a Catholic who thwarted
him.  Basil could under Diocletian hardly have died in his bed as
archbishop of Cæsarea.
