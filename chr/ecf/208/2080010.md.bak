<span id="vi.i.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.i.iv-p1.1"></span>IV.—Basil and the Councils, to the Accession of
Valens.</span>

<span id="vi.i.iv-p2"></span>Up to this time St. Basil is not seen to
have publicly taken an active part in the personal theological
discussions of the age; but the ecclesiastical world was eagerly
disputing while he was working in Pontus.  Aetius, the uncompromising
Arian, was openly favoured by Eudoxius of Germanicia, who had
appropriated the see of Antioch in 357.  This provoked the Semiarians to
hold their council at Ancyra in 358, when the Sirmian “Blasphemy” of 357
was condemned.  The Acacians were alarmed, and manœuvred for the
division of the general council which Constantius was desirous of
summoning.  Then came Ariminum, Nike, and Seleucia, in 359, and “the
world groaned to find itself Arian.”  Deputations from each of the great
parties were sent to a council held under the personal presidency of
Constantius at Constantinople, and to one of these the young deacon was
attached.  The date of the ordination to this grade is unknown.  On the
authority of Gregory of Nyssa <span id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87.md) and
Philostorgius, <span id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88.md) it appears that
Basil accompanied his namesake of Ancyra and Eustathius of Sebaste to
the court, and supported Basil the bishop.  Philostorgius would indeed
represent the younger Basil as championing the Semiarian cause, though
with some cowardice. <span id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md)   It may be
concluded, with Maran, that he probably stood forward stoutly for the
truth, not only at the capital itself, but also in the neighbouring
cities of Chalcedon and Heraclea. <span id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md)  
But his official position was a humble one, and his part in the
discussions and amid the intrigues of the council was only too likely to
be misrepresented by those with whom he did not agree, and even
misunderstood by his own friends.  In 360 Dianius signed the creed of
Ariminum, brought to Cæsarea by George of Laodicea; and thereby Basil
was so much distressed as henceforward to shun communion with his
bishop. <span id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md)   He left Cæsarea and
betook himself to Nazianzus to seek consolation in the society of his
friend.  But his feelings towards Dianius were always affectionate, and
he indignantly repudiated a calumnious assertion that he had gone so far
as to anathematize him.  Two years later Dianius fell sick unto death
and sent for Basil, protesting that at heart he had always been true to
the Catholic creed.  Basil acceded to the appeal, and in 362 once again
communicated with his bishop and old friend. <span
id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92.md)   In the interval between the <span
id="page_xix">p. xix</span> <span id="vi.i.iv-Page_xix"></span>visit to
Constantinople and this death-bed reconciliation, that form of error
arose which was long known by the name of Macedonianism, and which St.
Basil was in later years to combat with such signal success in the
treatise *Of the Spirit*.  It combined disloyalty to the Spirit and to
the Son.  But countervailing events were the acceptance of the
Homoousion by the Council of Paris, <span id="fr_93"></span>[94](#fn_93.md)
and the publication of Athanasius’ letters to Serapion on the divinity
of the two Persons assailed.  To this period is referred the compilation
by Basil of the *Moralia*. <span id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94.md)

<span id="vi.i.iv-p11"></span>The brief reign of Julian would affect
Basil, in common with the whole Church, in two ways:  in the relief he
would feel at the comparative toleration shewn to Catholics, and the
consequent return of orthodox bishops to their sees; <span
id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95.md) in the distress with which he would
witness his old friend’s attempts to ridicule and undermine the Faith. 
Sorrow more personal and immediate must have been caused by the harsh
treatment of Cæsarea <span id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md) and the cruel
imposts laid on Cappadocia.  What conduct on the part of the Cæsareans
may have led Gregory of Nazianzus <span id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md)
to speak of Julian as *justly* offended, we can only conjecture.  It may
have been the somewhat disorderly proceedings in connexion with the
appointment of Eusebius to succeed Dianius.  But there can be no doubt
about the sufferings of Cæsarea nor of the martyrdom of Eupsychius and
Damas for their part in the destruction of the Temple of Fortune. <span
id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md)

<span id="vi.i.iv-p16"></span>The precise part taken by Basil in the
election of Eusebius can only be conjectured.  Eusebius, like Ambrose of
Milan, a layman of rank and influence, was elevated *per saltum* to the
episcopate.  Efforts were made by Julian and by some Christian objectors
to get the appointment annulled by means of Gregory, Bishop of
Nazianzus, on the ground of its having been brought about by violence. 
Bishop Gregory refused to take any retrogressive steps, and thought the
scandal of accepting the tumultuary appointment would be less than that
of cancelling the consecration.  Gregory the younger presumably
supported his father, and he associates Basil with him as probable
sufferers from the imperial vengeance. <span
id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md)   But he was at Nazianzus at the time of
the election, and Basil is more likely to have been an active
agent. <span id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md)

<span id="vi.i.iv-p19"></span>To this period may be referred Basil’s
receipt of the letter from Athanasius, mentioned in Letter CCIV., §
6. <span id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101.md)   On the accession of Jovian,
in June, 363, Athanasius wrote to him asserting the Nicene Faith, but he
was greeted also by a Semiarian manifesto from Antioch, <span
id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md) of which the first signatory was
Meletius.

<span id="vi.i.iv-p22"></span>Valentinian and Valens, on their accession
in the following year, thus found the Church still divided on its
cardinal doctrines, and the lists were marked in which Basil was
henceforward to be a more conspicuous combatant.

also *Epp*. xxxix., xl., and xli., with the notes on pp. 141, 142, for
the argument for and against the genuineness of the correspondence.  Two
Eupsychii of Cæsarea are named in the *Acta Sanctorum* and by the
*Petits Bollandistes*,—one celebrated on April 9, said to have been
martyred in the reign of Hadrian, the other the victim of Julian in 362,
commemorated on Sept. 7.  Tillemont identifies them.  Baronius thinks
them distinct.  J. S. Stilting (*Act. Sanct*. ed. 1868) is inclined to
distinguish them mainly on the ground that between 362 and the time of
Basil’s describing the festival as an established yearly commemoration
there is not sufficient interval for the cultus to have arisen.  This
alone seems hardly convincing.  The local interest in the victim of
Julian’s severity would naturally be great.  Becket was murdered in 1170
and canonized in 1173, Dec. 29 being fixed for his feast; Lewis VII. of
France was among the pilgrims in 1179.  Bernadette Soubirous announced
her vision at Lourdes in 1858; the church was begun there in 1862.
