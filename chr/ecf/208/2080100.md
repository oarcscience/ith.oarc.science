<span id="ix.xxviii-p3"></span>*To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata*. <span

<span id="ix.xxviii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xxviii-p5.1"></span>When</span> by God’s grace, and the aid of
<span id="page_132">p. 132</span> <span
id="ix.xxviii-Page_132"></span>your prayers, I had seemed to be somewhat
recovering from my sickness, and had got my strength again, then came
winter, keeping me a prisoner at home, and compelling me to remain where
I was.  True, its severity was much less than usual, but this was quite
enough to keep me not merely from travelling while it lasted, but even
from so much as venturing to put my head out of doors.  But to me it is
no slight thing to be permitted, if only by letter, to communicate with
your reverence, and to rest tranquil in the hope of your reply. 
However, should the season permit, and further length of life be allowed
me, and should the dearth not prevent me from undertaking the
journey, <span id="fr_1992"></span>[1993](#fn_1992) peradventure through
the aid of your prayers I may be able to fulfil my earnest wish, may
find you at your own fireside, and, with abundant leisure, may take my
fill of your vast treasures of wisdom.

<span id="ix.xxviii-p4"></span> This, the first of twenty-two letters
addressed by Basil to Eusebius of Samosata, has no particular interest. 
Eusebius, the friend of Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus, and of Meletius,
was bishop of Samosata (in Commagene on the Euphrates, now Samsat) from
360 to 373, and was of high character and sound opinions.  Theodoret
(*Ecc. Hist*. iv. 15), in mentioning his exile to Thrace in the
persecution under Valens, calls him “that unflagging labourer in
apostolic work,” and speaks warmly of his zeal.  Concerning the singular
and touching circumstances of his death, *vide* Theodoret, *E.H*. v. 4,
and my note in the edition of this series, p. 134.

<span id="ix.xxviii-p6"></span> Samosata was about two hundred miles
distant from Cæsarea, as the crow flies.
