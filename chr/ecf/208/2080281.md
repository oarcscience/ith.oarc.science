<span id="ix.ccix-p3"></span>*To Eulancius*.

<span id="ix.ccix-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccix-p4.1"></span>You</span> have been long silent, though you
have very great power of speech, and are well trained in the art of
conversation and of exhibiting yourself by your eloquence.  Possibly it
is Neocæsarea which is the cause of your not writing to me.  I suppose I
must take it as a kindness if those who are there do not remember me,
for, as I am informed by those who report what they hear, the mention
made of me is not kind.  You, however, used to be one of those who were
disliked for my sake, not one of those who dislike me for the sake of
others.  I hope this description will continue to fit you, that wherever
you are you will write to me, and will have kindly thoughts of me, if
you care at all for what is fair and right.  It is certainly fair that
those who have been first to show affection should be paid in their own
coin.
