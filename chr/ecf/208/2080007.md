<span id="vi.i.i-p7"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="vi.i.i-p7.1"></span>Under</span> the persecution of the second
Maximinus, <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0) a Christian gentleman of
good position and fair estate in Pontus <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1) and Macrina his wife, suffered severe
hardships. <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2)   They escaped with their
lives, and appear to have retained, or recovered, some of their
property. <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3)   Of their children the
names of two only have survived:  Gregory <span
id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4) and Basil. <span id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5)
  The former became bishop of one of the sees of Cappadocia.  The latter
acquired a high reputation in Pontus and the neighboring districts as an
advocate of eminence, <span id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6) and as a teacher
of rhetoric.  His character in the Church for probity and piety stood
very high. <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7)   He married an orphaned
gentlewoman named Emmelia, whose father had suffered impoverishment and
death for Christ’s sake, and who was herself a conspicuous example of
high-minded and gentle Christian womanhood.  Of this happy union were
born ten children, <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8) five boys and five
girls.  One of the boys appears to have died in infancy, for on the
death of the elder Basil four sons and five daughters were left to share
the considerable wealth which he left behind him. <span
id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9)   Of the nine survivors the eldest was a
daughter, named, after her grandmother, Macrina.  The eldest of the sons
was Basil, the second Naucratius, and the third Gregory.  Peter, the
youngest of the whole family, was born shortly before his father’s
death.  Of this remarkable group the eldest is commemorated as Saint
Macrina in the biography written by her brother Gregory.  Naucratius
died in early manhood, <span id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10) about the
time of the ordination of Basil as reader.  The three remaining brothers
occupied respectively the sees of Cæsarea, Nyssa, and Sebasteia.

<span id="vi.i.i-p19"></span>As to the date of St. Basil’s birth
opinions have varied between 316 and 330.  The later, which is supported
by Garnier, Tillemont, Maran, <span id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11)
Fessler, <span id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12) and Böhringer, may
probably be accepted as approximately correct. <span
id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13)   It is true that Basil calls himself an
old man in 374, <span id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14) but he was
prematurely worn out with work and bad health, and to his friends wrote
freely and without concealment of his infirmities.  There appears no
reason to question the date 329 or 330.

<span id="vi.i.i-p24"></span>Two cities, Cæsarea in Cappadocia and
Neocæsarea in Pontus, have both been named as his birthplace.  There
must be some amount of uncertainty on this point, from the fact that no
direct statement exists to clear it up, and that the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.i.i-p24.1"></span>πατρίς</span> was loosely
employed <span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span> <span
id="vi.i.i-Page_xiv"></span>to mean not only place of birth, but place
of residence and occupation. <span id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15)  
Basil’s parents had property and interests both in Pontus and Cappadocia
and were as likely to be in the one as in the other.  The early
statement of Gregory of Nazianzus has been held to have weight, inasmuch
as he speaks of Basil as a Cappadocian like himself before there was any
other reason but that of birth for associating him with this
province. <span id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16)   Assenting, then, to the
considerations which have been held to afford reasonable ground for
assigning Cæsarea as the birthplace, we may adopt the popular estimation
of Basil as one of “The Three Cappadocians,” <span
id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17) and congratulate Cappadocia on the
Christian associations which have rescued her fair fame from the slur of
the epigram which described her as constituting with Crete and Cilicia a
trinity of unsatisfactoriness. <span id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18)  
Basil’s birth nearly synchronizes with the transference of the chief
seat of empire from Rome to Byzantium.  He is born into a world where
the victory already achieved by the Church has been now for sixteen
years officially recognized. <span id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19)   He
is born into a Church in which the first great Council has already given
official expression to those cardinal doctrines of the faith, of which
the final and formal vindication is not to be assured till after the
struggles of the next six score of years.  Rome, reduced, civilly, to
the subordinate rank of a provincial city, is pausing before she
realises all her loss, and waits for the crowning outrage of the
barbarian invasions, ere she begins to make serious efforts to grasp
ecclesiastically, something of her lost imperial prestige.  For a time
the centre of ecclesiastical and theological interest is to be rather in
the East than in the West.

heathenism to delay the official recognition of the victory of the

Armenia, St. George, St. Agnes, St. Lucy, St. Margaret of Antioch, St.
Katharine of Alexandria.

<span id="vi.i.i-p22"></span> Gregory of Nazianzus, so called, was born
during the episcopate of his father, Gregory, bishop of Nazianzus. 
Gregory the elder died in 373, after holding the see forty-five years. 
The birth of Gregory the younger cannot therefore be put before 328, and
Basil was a little younger than his friend.  (Greg. Naz., *Ep*.
xxxiii.)  But the birth of Gregory in his father’s episcopate has
naturally been contested.  *Vide D.C.B*. ii. p. 748, and L. Montaut,
*Revue Critique* on Greg. of N. 1878.

id="vi.i.i-p24.2"></span>

<span id="vi.i.i-p25"></span> Gregory of Nazianzus calls Basil a
Cappadocian in *Ep*. vi., and speaks of their both belonging to the same
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.i.i-p25.1"></span>πατρίς</span>.  In
his Homily *In Gordium martyrem*, Basil mentions the adornment of
Cæsarea as being his own adornment.  In *Epp*. lxxvi. and xcvi. he calls
Cappadocia his <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.i.i-p25.2"></span>πατρίς</span>.  In *Ep*. lxxiv., Cæsarea.  In
*Ep*. li. it is doubtful whether it is Pontus, whence he writes, which
is his <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.i.i-p25.3"></span>πατρίς</span>,
or Cæsarea, of which he is writing.  In *Ep*. lxxxvii. it is apparently
Pontus.  Gregory of Nyssa (*Orat. I. in xl. Mart*.) calls Sebaste the
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.i.i-p25.4"></span>πατρίς</span> of his
forefathers, possibly because Sebaste had at one time been under the
jurisdiction of Cappadocia.  So in the N.T. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.i.i-p25.5"></span>πατρίς</span> is the place of the early life
and education of our Lord.
