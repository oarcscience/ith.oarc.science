id="ix.cccxxxvii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCCXLII.</span>

<span id="ix.cccxxxvii-p2"></span>Basil to Libanius.

<span id="ix.cccxxxvii-p3"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cccxxxvii-p3.1"></span>All</span> who are attached to the rose,
as might be expected in the case of lovers of the beautiful, are not
displeased even at the thorns from out of which the flower blows.  I
have even heard it said about roses by some one, perhaps in jest, or, it
may be, even in earnest, that nature has furnished the bloom with those
delicate thorns, like stings of love to lovers, to excite those who
pluck them to intenser longing by these ingeniously adapted
pricks. <span id="fr_3276"></span>[3277](#fn_3276.md)  But what do I mean
by this introduction of the rose into my letter?  You do not need
telling, when you remember your own letter.  It had indeed the bloom of
the rose, and, by its fair speech, opened out all spring to me; but it
was bethorned with certain fault findings and charges against me.  But
even the thorn of your words is delightful to me, for it enkindles in me
a greater longing for your friendship.
