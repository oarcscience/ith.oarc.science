<span id="ix.cliii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cliii-p5.1"></span>If</span> I were to fail to write to any one
else I might possibly with justice incur the charge of carelessness or
forgetfulness.  But it is not possible to forget you, when your name is
in all men’s mouths.  But I cannot be careless about one who is perhaps
more distinguished than any one else in the empire.  The cause of my
silence is evident.  I am afraid of troubling so great a man.  If,
however, to all your other virtues you add that of not only receiving
what I send, but of actually asking after what is missing, lo! here I am
writing to you with joyous heart, and I shall go on writing for the
future, with prayers to God that you may be requited for the honour you
pay me.  For the Church, you have anticipated my supplications, by doing
everything which I should have asked.  And you act to please not man but
God, Who has honoured you; Who has given you some good things in this
life, and will give you others in the life to come, because you have
walked with truth in His way, and, from the beginning to the end, have
kept your heart fixed in the right faith.
