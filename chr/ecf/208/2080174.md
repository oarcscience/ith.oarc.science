<span id="ix.cii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cii-p5.1"></span>This</span> is my first letter to you, and I
could have prayed that its subject were a brighter one.  Had it been so,
things would have fallen out as I desire, for it is my wish that the
life of all those who are purposed to live in true religion should be
happily spent.  But the Lord, Who ordains our course in accordance with
His ineffable wisdom, has arranged that all these things should come
about for the advantage of our souls, whereby He has, on the one hand,
made your life sorrowful, and on the other, roused the sympathy of one
who, like myself, is united to you in godly love.  Therefore on my
learning from my brothers what has befallen you it has seemed to me that
I could not but give you such comfort as I can.  Had it indeed been
possible to me to travel to the place in which you are now living I
would have made every effort to do so.  But my bad health and the
present business which occupies me have caused this very journey, which
I have <span id="page_185">p. 185</span> <span
id="ix.cii-Page_185"></span>undertaken, to be injurious to the interests
of my Church.  I have, therefore, determined to address your excellency
in writing, to remind you that these afflictions are not sent by the
Lord, Who rules us, to the servants of God to no purpose, but as a test
of the genuineness of our love to the divine Creator.  Just as athletes
win crowns by their struggles in the arena, so are Christians brought to
perfection by the trial of their temptations, if only we learn to accept
what is sent us by the Lord with becoming patience, with all
thanksgiving.  All things are ordained by the Lord’s love.  We must not
accept anything that befalls us as grievous, even if, for the present,
it affects our weakness.  We are ignorant, peradventure, of the reasons
why each thing that happens to us is sent to us as a blessing by the
Lord but we ought to be convinced that all that happens to us is for our
good, either for the reward of our patience, or for the soul which we
have received, lest, by lingering too long in this life, it be filled
with the wickedness to be found in this world.  If the hope of
Christians is limited to this life, it might rightly have been reckoned
a bitter lot to be prematurely parted from the body; but if, to them
that love God, the sundering of the soul from these bodily fetters is
the beginning of our real life, why do we grieve like them which have no
hope? <span id="fr_2355"></span>[2356](#fn_2355)   Be comforted then,
and do not fall under your troubles, but show that you are superior to
them and can rise above them.
