id="fr_3231"></span>[3232](#fn_3231) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxxvii-p3"></span>To the great Harmatius.

<span id="ix.cclxxvii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxxvii-p4.1"></span>The</span> common law of human nature makes
elders fathers to youngsters, and the special peculiar law of us
Christians puts us old men in the place of parents to the younger.  Do
not, then, think that I am impertinent or shew myself indefensibly
meddlesome, if I plead with you on behalf of your son.  In other
respects I think it only right that you should exact obedience from him;
for, so far as his body is concerned, he is subject to you, both by the
law of nature, and by the civil law under which we live.  His soul,
however, is derived from a diviner source, and may properly be held to
be subject to another authority.  The debts which it owes to God have a
higher claim than any others.  Since, then, he has preferred the God of
us Christians, the true God, to your many gods which are worshipped by
the help of material symbols, be not angry with him.  Rather admire his
noble firmness of soul, in sacrificing the fear and respect due to his
father to close conjunction with God, through true knowledge and a life
of virtue.  Nature herself will move you, as well as your invariable
gentleness and kindliness of disposition, not to allow yourself to feel
angry with him even to a small extent.  And I am sure that you will not
set my mediation at naught,—or rather, I should say, the mediation of
your townsmen of which I am the exponent.  They all love you so well,
and pray so earnestly for all blessings for you, that they suppose that
in you they have welcomed a Christian too.  So overjoyed have they been
at the report which has suddenly reached the town.
