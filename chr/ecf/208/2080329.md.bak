<span id="ix.cclvii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cclvii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLVI. <span
id="fr_3122"></span>[3123](#fn_3122.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cclvii-p3"></span>*To the very well beloved and reverend
brethren the presbyters Acacius, Aetius, Paulus, and Silvanus; the
deacons Silvinus and Lucius, and the rest of the brethren the monks,
Basil, the bishop.* <span id="fr_3123"></span>[3124](#fn_3123.md)

<span id="ix.cclvii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclvii-p5.1"></span>News</span> has reached me of the severe
persecution carried on against you, and how directly after Easter the
men who fast for strife and debate <span
id="fr_3124"></span>[3125](#fn_3124.md) attacked your homes, and gave your
labours to the flames, preparing for you indeed a house in the heavens,
not made with hands, <span id="fr_3125"></span>[3126](#fn_3125.md) but for
themselves laying up in store the fire which they had used to your
hurt.  I no sooner heard of this than I groaned over what had happened;
pitying not you, my brethren, (God forbid!) but the men who are so sunk
in wickedness as to carry their evil deeds to such an extent.  I
expected you all to hurry at once to the refuge prepared for you in my
humble self; and I hoped that the Lord would give me refreshment in the
midst of my continual troubles in embracing you, and in receiving on
this inactive body of mine the noble sweat which you are dropping for
the truth’s sake, and so having some share in the prizes laid up for you
by the Judge of truth.  But this did not enter into your minds, and you
did not even expect any relief at my hands.  I was therefore at least
anxious to find frequent opportunities of writing to you, to the end
that like those who cheer on combatants in the arena, I might myself by
letter give you some encouragement in your good fight.  For two reasons,
however, I have not found this easy.  In the first place, I did not know
where you were residing.  And, secondly, but few of our people travel in
your direction.  Now the Lord has brought us the very well beloved and
reverend brother Sanctissimus, the presbyter.  By him I am able to
salute you, and I beseech you to pray for me, rejoicing and exulting
that your reward is great in heaven, <span
id="fr_3126"></span>[3127](#fn_3126.md) and that you have freedom with the
Lord to cease not day and night calling on Him to put an end to this
storm of the Churches; <span id="page_294">p. 294</span> <span
id="ix.cclvii-Page_294"></span>to grant the shepherds to their flocks,
and that the Church may return to her proper dignity.  I am persuaded
that if a voice be found to move our good God, He will not make His
mercy afar off, but will now “with the temptation make a way to escape,
that ye may be able to bear it.” <span
id="fr_3127"></span>[3128](#fn_3127.md)   Salute all the brethren in Christ
in any name.

that the Acacius heading this list is probably the Acacius who in 375
had invited Basil in the name of the Church of Berœa, and was afterwards
famous alike for his episcopate at Berœa and his hostility to St.
Chrysostom.  *cf. Letter* ccxx. p. 260.
