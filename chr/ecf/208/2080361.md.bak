<span id="ix.cclxxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cclxxxix-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLXXXVIII. <span
id="fr_3247"></span>[3248](#fn_3247.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxxxix-p3"></span>Without address.  Excommunicatory.

<span id="ix.cclxxxix-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxxxix-p4.1"></span>When</span> public punishment fails to
bring a man to his senses, or exclusion from the prayers of the Church
to drive him to repentance, it only remains to treat him in accordance
with our Lord’s directions—as it is written, “If thy brother shall
trespass against thee….tell him his fault between thee and him;…if he
will not hear thee, take with thee another;” “and if he shall” then
“neglect to hear, tell it unto <span id="page_314">p. 314</span> <span
id="ix.cclxxxix-Page_314"></span>the Church; but if he neglect to hear
even the Church, let him be unto thee henceforth as an heathen man, and
as a publican.” <span id="fr_3248"></span>[3249](#fn_3248.md)   Now all
this we have done in the case of this fellow.  First, he was accused of
his fault; then he was convicted in the presence of one or two
witnesses; thirdly, in the presence of the Church.  Thus we have made
our solemn protest, and he has not listened to it.  Henceforth let him
be excommunicated.

<span id="ix.cclxxxix-p6"></span>Further, let proclamation be made
throughout the district, that he be excluded from participation in any
of the ordinary relations of life; so that by our withholding ourselves
from all intercourse with him he may become altogether food for the
devil. <span id="fr_3249"></span>[3250](#fn_3249.md)
