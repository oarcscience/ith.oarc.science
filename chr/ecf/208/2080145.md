id="ix.lxxiii-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXII. <span

<span id="ix.lxxiii-p3"></span>*To Hesychius*. <span

<span id="ix.lxxiii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxxiii-p5.1"></span>I know</span> your affection for me, and your
zeal for all that is good.  I am exceedingly anxious to pacify my very
dear son Callisthenes, and I thought that if I could associate you with
me in this I might more easily achieve my object.  Callisthenes is very
much annoyed at the conduct of Eustochius, and he has <span
id="page_168">p. 168</span> <span id="ix.lxxiii-Page_168"></span>very
good ground for being so.  He charges the household of Eustochius with
impudence and violence against himself.  I am begging him to be
propitiated, satisfied with the fright which he has given the impudent
fellows and their master, and to forgive, and end the quarrel.  Thus two
results will follow; he will win the respect of men, and praise with
God, if only he will combine forbearance with threats.  If you have any
friendship and intimacy with him, pray ask this favour of him, and, if
you know any in the town likely to be able to move him, get them to act
with you, and tell them that it will be specially gratifying to me. 
Send back the deacon so soon as his commission is performed.  After men
have fled for refuge to me, I should be ashamed not to be able to be of
any use to them.
