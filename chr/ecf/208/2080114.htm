<p class="c21"><a name="ix.xlii-p5"></A>2.&#160; Your excellent tribune Lausus, trusty minister of your orders, has also reported to me that a certain woman came as a suppliant to your serenity on the occasion of the death of her son by poison; that it has been judged by you that poisoners are not allowed to exist;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2057"></A><A HREF="#fn_2057"><FONT SIZE="1">2058</FONT></A>
 if any there be, that they are to be destroyed, or, only those are reserved, who are to fight with beasts.&#160; And, this rightly decided by you, seems strange to me, for your efforts to cure the pain of great wounds by petty remedies are to the last degree ridiculous.&#160; After insulting God, it is useless for you to give heed to widows and orphans.&#160; The former is mad and dangerous; the latter the part of a merciful and kindly man.&#160; It is a serious thing for a private individual like myself to speak to an emperor; it will be more serious for you to speak to God.&#160; No one will appear to mediate between God and man.&#160; What you read you did not understand.&#160; If you had understood, you would not have condemned.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2058"></A><A HREF="#fn_2058"><FONT SIZE="1">2059</FONT></A>
