<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.lxxxvi-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXXV. <span
id="fr_2290"></span>[2291](#fn_2290) </span>

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p3"></span>*That the oath ought not to be
taken*. <span id="fr_2291"></span>[2292](#fn_2291)

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxxxvi-p5.1"></span>It</span> is my invariable custom to protest
at every synod and to urge privately in conversation, that oaths about
the taxes ought not to be imposed on husbandmen by the collectors.  It
remains for me to bear witness, on the same matters, in writing, before
God and men, that it behoves you to cease from inflicting death upon
men’s souls, and to devise some other means of exaction, while you let
men keep their souls unwounded.  I write thus to you, not as though you
needed any spoken exhortation (for you have your own immediate
inducements to fear the Lord), but that all your dependents may learn
from you not to provoke the Holy One, nor let a forbidden sin become a
matter of indifference, through faulty familiarity.  No possible good
can be done them by oaths, with a view to their paying what is exacted
from them, and they suffer an undeniable wrong to the soul.  For when
men become practised in perjury, they no longer put any pressure on
themselves to pay, but they think that they have discovered in the oath
a means of trickery and an opportunity for delay.  If, then, the Lord
brings a sharp retribution on the perjured, when the debtors are
destroyed by punishment there will be none to answer when summoned.  If
on the other hand the Lord endures with long suffering, then, as I said
before, those who have tried the patience of the Lord despise His
goodness.  Let them not break the law in vain; let them not whet the
wrath of God against them.  I have said what I ought.  The disobedient
will see.

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p4"></span> The distress of the Cappadocians under
the load of taxes is described in *Letter* lxxiv.  An objectionable
custom arose, or was extended, of putting the country people on oath as
to their inability to pay.
