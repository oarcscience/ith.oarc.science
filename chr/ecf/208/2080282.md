<span id="ix.ccx-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccx-p4.1"></span>It</span> is your lot to share my distress, and
to do battle on my behalf.  Herein is proof of your manliness.  God, who
ordains our lives, grants to those who are capable of sustaining great
fights greater opportunity of winning renown.  You truly have risked
your own life as a test of your valour in your friend’s behalf, like
gold in the furnace.  I pray God that other men may be made better; that
you may remain what you are, and that you will not cease to find fault
with me, as you do, and to charge me with not writing often to you, as a
wrong on my part which does you very great injury.  This is an
accusation only made by a friend.  Persist in demanding the payment of
such debts.  I am not so very unreasonable in paying the claims of
affection.
