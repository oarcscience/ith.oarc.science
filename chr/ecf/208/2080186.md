id="ix.cxiv-p1.1"></span>Letter CXIII. <span
id="fr_2379"></span>[2380](#fn_2379) </span>

<span id="ix.cxiv-p3"></span>*To the presbyters of Tarsus*. <span
id="fr_2380"></span>[2381](#fn_2380)

<span id="ix.cxiv-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxiv-p5.1"></span>On</span> meeting this man, I heartily thanked
God that by means of his visit He had comforted me in many afflictions
and had through him shewn me clearly your love.  I seem to see in one
man’s disposition the zeal of all of you for the truth.  He will tell
you of our discourses with one another.  What you ought to learn
directly from me is as follows.

<span id="ix.cxiv-p6"></span>We live in days when the overthrow of the
Churches seems imminent; of this I have long been cognisant.  There is
no edification of the Church; no correction of error; no sympathy for
the weak; no single defence of sound brethren; no remedy is found either
to heal the disease which has already seized us, or as a preventive
against that which we expect.  Altogether the state of the Church (if I
may use a plain figure though it may seem too humble an one) is like an
old coat, which is always being torn and can never be restored to its
original strength.  At such a time, then, there is need of great effort
and diligence that the Churches may in some way be benefited.  It is an
advantage that parts hitherto severed should be united.  Union would be
effected if we were willing to accommodate ourselves to the weaker,
where we can do so without injury to souls; since, then, many mouths are
open against the Holy Ghost, and many tongues whetted to blasphemy
against Him, we implore you, as far as in you lies, to reduce the
blasphemers to a small number, and to receive into communion all who do
not assert the Holy Ghost to be a creature, that the blasphemers may be
left alone, and may either be ashamed and return to the truth, or, if
they abide in their error, may cease to have any importance from the
smallness of their numbers.  Let us then seek no more than this, but
propose to all the brethren, who are willing to join <span
id="page_190">p. 190</span> <span id="ix.cxiv-Page_190"></span>us, the
Nicene Creed.  If they assent to that, let us further require that the
Holy Ghost ought not to be called a creature, nor any of those who say
so be received into communion.  I do not think that we ought to insist
upon anything beyond this.  For I am convinced that by longer
communication and mutual experience without strife, if anything more
requires to be added by way of explanation, the Lord Who worketh all
things together for good for them that love Him, <span
id="fr_2381"></span>[2382](#fn_2381) will grant it.
