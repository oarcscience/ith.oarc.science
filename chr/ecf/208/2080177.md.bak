<span id="ix.cv-p3"></span>*To the prefect Modestus*. <span

<span id="ix.cv-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cv-p5.1"></span>Merely</span> to write to so great a man, even
though there be no other reason, must be esteemed a great honour.  For
communication with personages of high distinction confers glory upon all
to whom it is permitted.  My supplication, however, is one which I am
driven by necessity to make to your excellency, in my great distress at
the condition of my whole country.  Bear with me, I beg you, kindly and
in accordance with your own characters and reach a helping hand to my
<span id="page_186">p. 186</span> <span
id="ix.cv-Page_186"></span>country, now beaten to the knee.  The
immediate object of my entreaty is as follows.  By the old census, the
clergy of God, presbyters and deacons, <span
id="fr_2363"></span>[2364](#fn_2363.md) were left exempt.  The recent
registrars, however, without any authority from your lordship, have
enrolled them, except that in some cases a few were granted immunity on
the score of age.  I ask, then, that you will leave us this memorial of
your beneficence, to preserve through all coming time your good fame;
that in accordance with the old law the clergy be exempt from
contribution.  I do not ask the remission to be conceded personally and
individually to those who are now included, in which case the grace will
pass to their successors, who may not always be worthy of the sacred
ministry.  I would suggest that some general concession be made to the
clergy, according to the form in the open register, so that the
exemption may be given in each place to ministers by the rulers of the
Church.  This boon is sure to bring undying glory to your excellency for
your good deeds, and will cause many to pray for the imperial house.  It
will also really be profitable to the government, if we afford the
relief of exemption, not generally to all the clergy, but to those who
from time to time are in distress.  This, as any one who chooses may
know, is the course we actually pursue when we are at liberty.
