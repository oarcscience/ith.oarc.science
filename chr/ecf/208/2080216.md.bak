<span id="ix.cxliv-p3"></span>*To another accountant*. <span

<span id="ix.cxliv-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxliv-p5.1"></span>Had</span> it been possible for me to meet
your excellency I would have in person brought before you the points
about which I am anxious, and would have pleaded the cause of the
afflicted, but I am prevented by illness and by press of business.  I
have therefore sent to you in my stead this chorepiscopus, my brother,
begging you to give him your aid and use him and to take him into
counsel, for his truthfulness and sagacity qualify him to advise in such
matters.  If you are so good as to inspect the hospital for the poor,
which is managed by him, (I am sure you will not pass it without a
visit, experienced as you are in the work; for I have been told that you
support one of the hospitals at Amasea out of the substance wherewith
the Lord has blessed you), I am confident that, after seeing it, you
will give him all he asks.  Your colleague has already promised me some
help towards the hospitals.  I tell you this, not that you may imitate
him, for you are likely to be a leader of others in good works, but that
you may know that others have shown regard for me in this matter.
