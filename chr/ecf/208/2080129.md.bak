<span id="ix.lvii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.lvii-p1.1"></span>Letter LVI. <span
id="fr_2205"></span>[2206](#fn_2205.md) </span>

<span id="ix.lvii-p3"></span>*To Pergamius*. <span
id="fr_2206"></span>[2207](#fn_2206.md)

<span id="ix.lvii-p5"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lvii-p5.1"></span>naturally</span> forget very easily, and I have
had lately many things to do, and so my natural infirmity is increased. 
I have no doubt, therefore, that you have written to me, although I have
no recollection of having received any letter from your excellency; for
I am sure you would not state what is not the case.  But for there
having been no reply, it is not I that am in fault; the guilt lies with
him who did not ask for one.  Now, however, you have this letter,
containing my defence for the past and affording ground for a second
greeting.  So, when you write to me, do not suppose that you are taking
the initiative in another correspondence.  You are only discharging your
proper obligation in this.  For really, although this letter of mine is
a return for a previous one of yours, as it is more than twice as bulky,
it will fulfil a double purpose.  You see to what sophisms my idleness
drives me.  But, my dear Sir, do not in a few words bring serious
charges, indeed the most serious of all.  Forgetfulness of one’s
friends, and neglect of them arising from high place, are faults which
involve every kind of wrong.  Do we fail to love <span id="page_159">p.
159</span> <span id="ix.lvii-Page_159"></span>according to the
commandment of the Lord?  Then we lose the distinctive mark imprinted on
us.  Are we puffed to repletion with empty pride and arrogance?  Then we
fall into the inevitable condemnation of the devil.  If, then, you use
these words because you held such sentiments about me, pray that I may
flee from the wickedness which you have found in my ways; if, however,
your tongue shaped itself to these words, in a kind of inconsiderate
conventionality, I shall console myself, and ask you to be good enough
to adduce some tangible proof of your allegations.  Be well assured of
this, that my present anxiety is an occasion to me of humility.  I shall
begin to forget you, when I cease to know myself.  Never, then, think
that because a man is a very busy man he is a man of faulty character.
