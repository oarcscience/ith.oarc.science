<span id="vii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.</span>

<span id="vii.xiii-p2"></span>Against those who assert that the baptism
in the name of the Father alone is sufficient.

<span id="vii.xiii-p3"></span>28.  <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xiii-p3.1"></span>Let</span> no one be misled by the fact of the
apostle’s frequently omitting the name of the Father and of the Holy
Spirit when making mention of baptism, or on this account imagine that
the invocation of the names is not observed.  “As many of you,” he says,
“as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ;” <span
id="fr_943"></span>[944](#fn_943.md) and again, “As many of you as were
baptized into Christ were baptized into his death.” <span
id="fr_944"></span>[945](#fn_944.md)   For the naming of Christ is the
confession of the whole, <span id="fr_945"></span>[946](#fn_945.md) shewing
forth as it does the God who gave, the Son who received, and the Spirit
who is, the unction. <span id="fr_946"></span>[947](#fn_946.md)   So we
have learned from Peter, in the Acts, of “Jesus of Nazareth whom God
anointed with the Holy Ghost;” <span id="fr_947"></span>[948](#fn_947.md)
and in Isaiah, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because the Lord hath
anointed me;” <span id="fr_948"></span>[949](#fn_948.md) and the Psalmist,
“Therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of
gladness above thy fellows.” <span id="fr_949"></span>[950](#fn_949.md)  
Scripture, however, in the case of baptism, sometimes plainly mentions
the Spirit alone. <span id="fr_950"></span>[951](#fn_950.md)

<span id="vii.xiii-p12"></span>“For into one Spirit,” <span
id="fr_951"></span>[952](#fn_951.md) it says, “we were all baptized
in <span id="fr_952"></span>[953](#fn_952.md) one body.” <span
id="fr_953"></span>[954](#fn_953.md)   And in harmony with this are the
passages:  “You shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost,” <span
id="fr_954"></span>[955](#fn_954.md) and “He shall baptize you with the
Holy Ghost.” <span id="fr_955"></span>[956](#fn_955.md)   But no one on
this account would be justified in calling that baptism a perfect
baptism wherein only the name of the Spirit was invoked.  For the
tradition that has been given us by the quickening grace must remain for
ever inviolate.  He who redeemed our life from destruction <span
id="fr_956"></span>[957](#fn_956.md) gave us power of renewal, whereof the
cause is ineffable and hidden in mystery, but bringing great salvation
to our souls, so that to add or to take away anything <span
id="fr_957"></span>[958](#fn_957.md) involves manifestly a falling away
from the life everlasting.  If then in baptism the separation of the
Spirit from the Father and the Son is perilous to the baptizer, and of
no advantage to the baptized, how can the rending asunder of the Spirit
from Father and from Son be safe for us? <span
id="fr_958"></span>[959](#fn_958.md)   Faith and baptism are two kindred
and inseparable ways of salvation:  faith is perfected through baptism,
baptism is established through faith, and both are completed by the same
names.  For as we believe in the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost,
so are we also baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
the Holy Ghost; first comes the confession, introducing us to salvation,
and baptism follows, setting the seal upon our assent.
