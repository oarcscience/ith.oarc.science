<span id="ix.ccxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ccxvi-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXV. <span
id="fr_2820"></span>[2821](#fn_2820) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxvi-p3"></span>To the Presbyter Dorotheus.

<span id="ix.ccxvi-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxvi-p4.1"></span>I took</span> the earliest opportunity of
writing to the most admirable Count Terentius, thinking it better to
write to him on the subject in hand by means of strangers, and being
anxious that our very dear brother Acacius shall not be inconvenienced
by any delay.  I have therefore given my letter to the government
treasurer, who is travelling by the imperial post, and I have charged
him to shew the letter to you first.  I cannot understand how it is that
no one has told you that the road to Rome is wholly impracticable in
winter, the country between Constantinople and our own regions being
full of enemies.  If the route by sea must be taken, the season will be
<span id="page_255">p. 255</span> <span
id="ix.ccxvi-Page_255"></span>favourable; if indeed my God-beloved
brother Gregory <span id="fr_2821"></span>[2822](#fn_2821) consents to
the voyage and to the commission concerning these matters.  For my own
part, I do not know who can go with him, and am aware that he is quite
inexperienced in ecclesiastical affairs.  With a man of kindly character
he may get on very well, and be treated with respect, but what possible
good could accrue to the cause by communication between a man proud and
exalted, and therefore quite unable to hear those who preach the truth
to him from a lower standpoint, and a man like my brother, to whom
anything like mean servility is unknown?
