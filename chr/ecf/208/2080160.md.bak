<span id="ix.lxxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.lxxxviii-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXXVII. <span
id="fr_2294"></span>[2295](#fn_2294.md) </span>

<span id="ix.lxxxviii-p3"></span>*Without address on the same
subject*. <span id="fr_2295"></span>[2296](#fn_2295.md)

<span id="ix.lxxxviii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxxxviii-p5.1"></span>I am</span> astonished that, with you to
appeal to, so grave an offence should have been committed against the
presbyter as that he should have been deprived of his only means of
livelihood.  The most serious part of the business is that the
perpetrators transfer the guilt of their proceedings to you; while all
the while it was your duty not only not to suffer such deeds to be done,
but to use all your authority to prevent them in the case of any one,
but specially in the case of presbyters, and such presbyters as are in
agreement with me, and are walking in the same way of true religion.  If
then you have any care to give me gratification, see that these matters
are set right without delay.  For, God helping you, you are able to do
this, and greater things than this to whom you will.  I have written to
the governor of my own country, <span
id="fr_2296"></span>[2297](#fn_2296.md) that, if they refuse to do what is
right of their own accord, they may be compelled to do so on pressure
from the courts.
