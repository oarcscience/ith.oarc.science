<span id="ix.clvi-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.clvi-p1.1"></span>Letter CLV. <span
id="fr_2507"></span>[2508](#fn_2507) </span>

<span id="ix.clvi-p3"></span>*Without address*. <span
id="fr_2508"></span>[2509](#fn_2508)   *In the case of a trainer*.

<span id="ix.clvi-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clvi-p5.1"></span>I am</span> at a loss how to defend myself
against all the complaints contained in the first and only letter which
your lordship has been so good as to send me.  It is not that there is
any lack of right on my side, but because among so many charges it is
hard to select the most vital, and fix on the point at which I ought to
begin to apply a remedy.  Perhaps, if I follow the order of your letter,
I shall come upon each in turn.  Up to to-day I knew nothing about those
who are setting out for Scythia; nor had any one told me even of those
who came from your house, so that I might greet you by them, although I
am anxious to seize every opportunity of greeting your lordship.  To
forget you in my prayers is impossible, unless first I forget the work
to which God has called me, for assuredly, faithful as by God’s grace
you are, you remember all the prayers <span
id="fr_2509"></span>[2510](#fn_2509) of the Church; how we pray also for
our brethren when on a journey and offer prayer in the holy church for
those who are in the army, and for those who speak for the sake of the
Lord’s name, and for those who show the fruits of the Spirit.  In most,
or all of these, I reckon your lordship to be included.  How could I
ever forget you, as far as I am individually concerned, when I have so
many reasons to stir me to recollection, such a sister, such nephews,
such kinsfolk, so good, so fond of me, house, household, and friends? 
By all these, even against my will, I am perforce reminded of your good
disposition.  As to this, however, our brother has brought me no
unpleasant news, nor has any decision been come to by me which could do
him any injury.  Free, then, the chorepiscopus and myself from all
blame, and grieve rather over those who have made false reports.  If our
learned friend wishes to bring an action against me, he has law courts
and laws.  In this I beg you not to blame me.  In all the good deeds
that you do, you are laying up treasure for yourself; you are preparing
for yourself in the day of retribution the same refreshment which you
are providing for those who are persecuted for the sake of the name of
the Lord.  If you send the relics of the martyrs home you will do well;
as you write that the persecution there is, even now, causing martyrs to
the Lord. <span id="fr_2510"></span>[2511](#fn_2510)

<span id="ix.clvi-p4"></span> Supposed by Maran (*Vit. Bas*.) to be
Julius Soranus, a relative of Basil, and dux of Scythia.  Maran supposes
that a copyist added these words to the title because Soranus was “a
trainer” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.clvi-p4.1"></span>αλείπτης</span>) and encourager of martyrs; in
*Letter* clxiv. Basil calls Ascholius “a trainer” of the martyr Sabas.

<span id="ix.clvi-p6"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.clvi-p6.1"></span>κηρύγματα</span>.  On St. Basil’s use of this
word for decree, *vide De Sp. S.*c. 66.  Here it seems to have the force
of an appointed liturgy.  *cf*. the letter of Firmilianus to Cyprian. 
(*Ep. Cyp*. 75.)

<span id="ix.clvi-p7"></span> This is one of the earliest references to
the preservation of relics.  So late as the case of St. Fructuosus
(*Acta SS. Fructuosi*, etc.), who died at Tarragona in 259, the friends
are forbidden to keep the relics.  On St. Basil’s views on the subject,
*cf*. *Hom. in Mart. Jul.* 2 and *Hom. de SS*. xl. *MM.* 8.  So Gregory
of Nyssa, *Hom*. i. *in* xl. *Mar*. ii. 935.  As early as the time of
St. Augustine (†430) a thriving trade in forged relics had already
begun.  (Aug., *De Opere Monach*. 28.)  *cf*. Littledale’s *Plain
Reasons*, p. 51.
