<span id="ix.cclix-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cclix-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLVIII. <span
id="fr_3130"></span>[3131](#fn_3130.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cclix-p3"></span>*To Epiphanius the bishop.* <span
id="fr_3131"></span>[3132](#fn_3131.md)

<span id="ix.cclix-p5"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclix-p5.1"></span>It</span> has long been expected that, in
accordance with the prediction of our Lord, because of iniquity
abounding, the love of the majority would wax cold. <span
id="fr_3132"></span>[3133](#fn_3132.md)   Now experience has confirmed this
expectation.  But though this condition of things has already obtained
among us here, it seems to be contradicted by the letter brought from
your holiness.  For verily it is no mere ordinary proof of love, first
that you should remember an unworthy and insignificant person like
myself; and secondly, that you should send to visit me brethren who are
fit and proper ministers of a correspondence of peace.  For now, when
every man is viewing every one else with suspicion, no spectacle is
rarer than that which you are presenting.  Nowhere is pity to be seen;
nowhere sympathy; nowhere a brotherly tear for a brother in distress. 
Not persecutions for the truth’s sake, not Churches with all their
people in tears; not this great tale of troubles closing round us, are
enough to stir us to anxiety for the welfare of one another.  We jump on
them that are fallen; we scratch and tear at wounded places; we who are
supposed to agree with one another launch the curses that are uttered by
the heretics; men who are in agreement on the most important matters are
<span id="page_295">p. 295</span> <span
id="ix.cclix-Page_295"></span>wholly severed from one another on some
one single point.  How, then, can I do otherwise than admire him who in
such circumstances shews that his love to his neighbour is pure and
guileless, and, though separated from me by so great a distance of sea
and land, gives my soul all the care he can?

<span id="ix.cclix-p7"></span>2.  I have been specially struck with
admiration at your having been distressed even by the dispute of the
monks on the Mount of Olives, and at your expressing a wish that some
means might be found of reconciling them to one another.  I have further
been glad to hear that you have not been unaware of the unfortunate
steps, taken by certain persons, which have caused disturbance among the
brethren, and that you have keenly interested yourself even in these
matters.  But I have deemed it hardly worthy of your wisdom that you
should entrust the rectification of matters of such importance to me: 
for I am not guided by the grace of God, because of my living in sin; I
have no power of eloquence, because I have cheerfully withdrawn from
vain studies; and I am not yet sufficiently versed in the doctrines of
the truth.  I have therefore already written to my beloved brethren at
the Mount of Olives, our own Palladius, <span
id="fr_3133"></span>[3134](#fn_3133.md) and Innocent the Italian, in answer
to their letters to me, that it is impossible for me to make even the
slightest addition to the Nicene Creed, except the ascription of Glory
to the Holy Ghost, because our Fathers treated this point cursorily, no
question having at that time arisen concerning the Spirit.  As to the
additions it is proposed to make to that Creed, concerning the
incarnation of our Lord, I have neither tested nor accepted them, as
being beyond my comprehension. <span
id="fr_3134"></span>[3135](#fn_3134.md)   I know well that, if once we
begin to interfere with the simplicity of the Creed, we shall embark on
interminable discussion, contradiction ever leading us on and on, and
shall but disturb the souls of simpler folk by the introduction of new
phrases. <span id="fr_3135"></span>[3136](#fn_3135.md)

<span id="ix.cclix-p11"></span>3.  As to the Church at Antioch (I mean
that which is in agreement in the same doctrine), may the Lord grant
that one day we may see it united.  It is in peril of being specially
open to the attacks of the enemy, who is angry with it because there the
name of Christian first obtained. <span
id="fr_3136"></span>[3137](#fn_3136.md)   There heresy is divided against
orthodoxy, and orthodoxy is divided against herself. <span
id="fr_3137"></span>[3138](#fn_3137.md)   My position, however, is this. 
The right reverend bishop Meletius was the first to speak boldly for the
truth, and fought that good fight in the days of Constantine.  Therefore
my Church has felt strong affection towards him, for the sake of that
brave and firm stand, and has held communion with him.  I, therefore, by
God’s grace, have held him to be in communion up to this time; and, if
God will, I shall continue to do so.  Moreover the very blessed Pope
Athanasius came from Alexandria, and was most anxious that communion
should be established between Meletius and himself; but by the malice of
counsellors their conjunction was put off to another season.  Would that
this had not been so!  I have never accepted communion with any one of
those who have since been introduced into the see, not because I count
them unworthy, but because I see no ground for the condemnation of
Meletius.  Nevertheless I have heard many things about the brethren,
without giving heed to them, because the accused were not brought face
to face with their accusers, according to that which is written, “Doth
our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he
doeth?” <span id="fr_3138"></span>[3139](#fn_3138.md)   I cannot therefore
at present write to them, right honourable brother, and I ought not to
be forced to do so.  It will be becoming to your peaceful disposition
not to cause union in one direction and disunion in another, but to
restore the severed member to the original union.  First, then, pray;
next, to the utmost of your ability, exhort, that ambition may be driven
from their hearts, and that reconciliation may be effected between them
both to restore strength to the Church, and to destroy the rage of our
foes.  It has given great comfort to my soul that, in addition to your
other right and accurate statements in theology, you should acknowledge
the necessity of stating that the hypostases are three.  Let the
brethren at Antioch be instructed by you after this manner.  Indeed I am
confident that they have been so instructed; for I am sure you would
never have accepted communion with them unless you had carefully made
sure of this point in them.

<span id="ix.cclix-p15"></span>4.  The Magusæans, <span
id="fr_3139"></span>[3140](#fn_3139.md) as you were good <span
id="page_296">p. 296</span> <span id="ix.cclix-Page_296"></span>enough
to point out to me in your other letter, are here in considerable
numbers, scattered all over the country, settlers having long ago been
introduced into these parts from Babylon.  Their manners are peculiar,
as they do not mix with other men.  It is quite impossible to converse
with them, inasmuch as they have been made the prey of the devil to do
his will.  They have no books; no instructors in doctrine.  They are
brought up in senseless institutions, piety being handed down from
father to son.  In addition to the characteristics which are open to
general observation, they object to the slaying of animals as
defilement, and they cause the animals they want for their own use to be
slaughtered by other people.  They are wild after illicit marriages;
they consider fire divine, and so on. <span
id="fr_3140"></span>[3141](#fn_3140.md)   No one hitherto has told me any
fables about the descent of the Magi from Abraham:  they name a certain
Zarnuas as the founder of their race.  I have nothing more to write to
your excellency about them.

<span id="ix.cclix-p4"></span> The learned and saintly bishop of Salamis
in Cyprus.  About this time he published his great work against heresy,
the <span class="Greek"><span id="ix.cclix-p4.1"></span>Πανάριον</span>,
and also travelled to Antioch to reconcile the Apollinarian Vitalis to
Paulinus.  On the failure of his efforts, and the complicated state of
parties at Antioch at this time, *cf.* Epiphan., lxxvii. 20–23; Jerome,
*Epp*. 57, 58, and Soz., *H.E.* vi. 25.

<span id="ix.cclix-p8"></span> This Palladius may possibly be identified
with the Palladius of Cæsarea of Athanasius, *Ep. ad Pall*.  Migne,
*Pat*. xxvi. 1167, and in the Ath. of this series, p. 580.

<span id="fn_3134"></span>[295:3135](2080331.htm#fr_3134.md) <span

<span id="ix.cclix-p9"></span> The Ben. note remarks “*Cum nonnulli
formulæ Nicenæ aliquid de Incarnatione adderent ad comprimendos
Apollinaristas, id Basilius nec examinaverat*,” etc.  I rather
understand the present <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.cclix-p9.1"></span>προσυφαίνομενα</span> to refer to the
proposals of Innocent to Palladius.

<span id="fn_3135"></span>[295:3136](2080331.htm#fr_3135.md) <span
id="ix.cclix-p9.2"></span>

<span id="ix.cclix-p10"></span> Yet Basil will admit an addition which
he holds warranted, in the case of the glorification of the Spirit, and
would doubtless have acquiesced in the necessity of the additions
finally victorious in 451.

<span id="fn_3136"></span>[295:3137](2080331.htm#fr_3136.md) <span

id="ix.cclix-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ix.cclix-p13"></span> In 377 Meletius was in exile, and
Paulinus the bishop of the “old Catholics,” or Eustathians (Soc., *H.E.*
iv. 2, v. 5) opposing Vitalius, who was consecrated to the episcopate by
Apollinaris.  On the confusion resulting from these three nominally
orthodox claimants, *vide* Jerome’s *Letter* xvi. in this series, p. 20.

id="ix.cclix-p16.1"></span>

<span id="ix.cclix-p17"></span> With the statements of Basil may be
compared those of Bardesanes in Eusebius, *Præp. Evan*. vi. 275, and of
Epiphanius in his *Exp. Cathol. Fid*.
