<span id="vii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.</span>

<span id="vii.v-p2"></span>That there is no distinction in the
scriptural use of these syllables.

<span id="vii.v-p3"></span>6.  <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.v-p3.1"></span>We</span> acknowledge that the word of truth has
in many places made use of these expressions; yet we absolutely deny
that the freedom of the Spirit is in bondage to the pettiness of
Paganism.  On the contrary, we maintain that Scripture varies its
expressions as occasion requires, according to the circumstances of the
case.  For instance, the phrase “*of* which” does not always and
absolutely, as they suppose, indicate the material, <span
id="fr_724"></span>[725](#fn_724) but it is more in accordance with the
usage of Scripture to apply this term in the case of the Supreme Cause,
as in the words “One God, of whom are all things,” <span
id="fr_725"></span>[726](#fn_725) and again, “All things of God.” <span
id="fr_726"></span>[727](#fn_726)   The word of truth has, however,
frequently used this term in the case of the material, as when it says
“Thou shalt make an ark of incorruptible wood;” <span
id="fr_727"></span>[728](#fn_727) and “Thou shalt make the candlestick
of pure gold;” <span id="fr_728"></span>[729](#fn_728) and “The first
man is of the earth, earthy;” <span id="fr_729"></span>[730](#fn_729)
and “Thou art formed out of clay as I am.” <span
id="fr_730"></span>[731](#fn_730)   But these men, to the end, as we
have already remarked, that they may establish the difference of nature,
have laid down the law that this phrase befits the Father alone.  This
distinction they have originally derived from heathen authorities, but
here they have shewn no faithful accuracy of limitation.  To the Son
they have in conformity with the teaching of their masters given the
title of instrument, and to the Spirit that of place, for they say *in*
the Spirit, and *through* the Son.  But when they apply “of whom” to God
they no longer follow heathen example, but “go over, as they say, to
apostolic usage, as it is said, “But of him are ye in Christ
Jesus,” <span id="fr_731"></span>[732](#fn_731) and “All things of
God.” <span id="fr_732"></span>[733](#fn_732)   What, then, is the
result of this systematic discussion?  There is one nature of Cause;
another of Instrument; another of Place.  So the Son is by nature
distinct from the Father, as the tool from the craftsman; and the Spirit
is distinct in so far as place or time is distinguished from the nature
of tools or from that of them that handle them.

id="vii.v-p5.1"></span>ὕ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.v-p5.2"></span>λη</span> in Plato bears the same signification
as in ordinary speech:  it means wood, timber, and sometimes generally
material.  The later philosophic application of the word to signify the
abstract conception of material substratum is expressed by Plato, so far
as he has that concept at all, in other ways.”  Ed. Zeller.  *Plato and
the older Academy*, ii. 296.  Similarly Basil uses <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.v-p5.3"></span>ὕ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.v-p5.4"></span>λη</span>.  As a technical
philosophic term for abstract matter, it is first used by Aristotle.

R.V. “acacia.”  St. Ambrose (*de Spiritu Sancto*, ii. 9) seems, say the
Benedictine Editors, to have here misunderstood St. Basil’s argument. 
St. Basil is accusing the Pneumatomachi not of tracing all things to God
as the material “of which,” but of unduly limiting the use of the term
“of which” to the Father alone.
