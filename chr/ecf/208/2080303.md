<span id="ix.ccxxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ccxxxi-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXXX. <span
id="fr_2936"></span>[2937](#fn_2936.md) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxxxi-p3"></span>To the magistrates of Nicopolis.

<span id="ix.ccxxxi-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxxxi-p4.1"></span>The</span> government of the Churches is
carried on by those to whom the chief offices in them have been
entrusted, but their hands are strengthened by the laity.  The measures
which lay with the God-beloved bishops have been taken.  The rest
concerns you, if you deign to accord a hearty reception to the bishop
who has been given you, and to make a vigorous resistance to attacks
from outside.  For nothing is so likely to cause discouragement to all,
whether rulers or the rest who envy your peaceful position, as agreement
in affection to the appointed bishop, and firmness in maintaining your
ground.  They are <span id="page_272">p. 272</span> <span
id="ix.ccxxxi-Page_272"></span>likely to despair of every evil attempt,
if they see that their counsels are accepted neither by clergy nor by
laity.  Bring it about then that your own sentiments as to the
right <span id="fr_2937"></span>[2938](#fn_2937.md) may be shared by all
the city, and so speak to the citizens, and to all the inhabitants of
the district, in confirmation of their good sentiments, that the
genuineness of your love to God may be everywhere known.  I trust that
it may be permitted me one day to visit and inspect a Church which is
the nursing mother of true religion, honoured by me as a metropolis of
orthodoxy, because it has from of old been under the government of men
right honourable and the elect of God, who have held fast to “the
faithful word as we have been taught.” <span
id="fr_2938"></span>[2939](#fn_2938.md)   You have approved him who has
just been appointed as worthy of these predecessors, and I have agreed. 
May you be preserved by God’s grace.  May He scatter the evil counsels
of our enemies, and fix in your souls strength and constancy to preserve
what has been rightly determined on.
