<span id="vii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.</span>

<span id="vii.xxiv-p2"></span>The glorifying of the enumeration of His
attributes.

<span id="vii.xxiv-p3"></span>54. <span
id="fr_1178"></span>[1179](#fn_1178.md)   <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xxiv-p4.2"></span>Now</span> of the rest of the Powers each
<span id="page_35">p. 35</span> <span id="vii.xxiv-Page_35"></span>is
believed to be in a circumscribed place.  The angel who stood by
Cornelius <span id="fr_1179"></span>[1180](#fn_1179.md) was not at one and
the same moment with Philip; <span id="fr_1180"></span>[1181](#fn_1180.md)
nor yet did the angel who spoke with Zacharias from the altar at the
same time occupy his own post in heaven.  But the Spirit is believed to
have been operating at the same time in Habakkuk and in Daniel at
Babylon, <span id="fr_1181"></span>[1182](#fn_1181.md) and to have been at
the prison with Jeremiah, <span id="fr_1182"></span>[1183](#fn_1182.md) and
with Ezekiel at the Chebar. <span id="fr_1183"></span>[1184](#fn_1183.md)  
For the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world, <span
id="fr_1184"></span>[1185](#fn_1184.md) and “whither shall I go from thy
spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?” <span
id="fr_1185"></span>[1186](#fn_1185.md)   And, in the words of the Prophet,
“For I am with you, saith the Lord…and my spirit remaineth among
you.” <span id="fr_1186"></span>[1187](#fn_1186.md)   But what nature is it
becoming to assign to Him who is omnipresent, and exists together with
God?  The nature which is all-embracing, or one which is confined to
particular places, like that which our argument shews the nature of
angels to be?  No one would so say.  Shall we not then highly exalt Him
who is in His nature divine, in His greatness infinite, in His
operations powerful, in the blessings He confers, good?  Shall we not
give Him glory?  And I understand glory to mean nothing else than the
enumeration of the wonders which are His own.  It follows then that
either we are forbidden by our antagonists even to mention the good
things which flow to us from Him. or on the other hand that the mere
recapitulation of His attributes is the fullest possible attribution of
glory.  For not even in the case of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ and of the Only begotten Son, are we capable of giving Them glory
otherwise than by recounting, to the extent of our powers, all the
wonders that belong to Them.

<span id="vii.xxiv-p4"></span> Here the Benedictine Editors begin
Chapter xxiii., remarking that they do so “*cum plures <span
class="c14"><span id="vii.xxiv-p4.1"></span>mss.</span> codices. tum
ipsam sermonis seriem et continuationem secuti.  Liquet enim hic
Basilium ad aliud argumentum transire*.”  Another division of the text
makes Chapter XXIII. begin with the words “But I do not mean by glory.”
