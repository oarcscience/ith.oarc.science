<span id="ix.cxlvii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cxlvii-p1.1"></span>Letter CXLVI. <span
id="fr_2480"></span>[2481](#fn_2480) </span>

<span id="ix.cxlvii-p3"></span>*To Antiochus*. <span
id="fr_2481"></span>[2482](#fn_2481)

<span id="ix.cxlvii-p5"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxlvii-p5.1"></span>cannot</span> accuse you of carelessness and
inattention, because, when an opportunity of writing occurred, you said
nothing.  For I count the greeting which you have sent me in your own
honoured hand worth many letters.  In return I salute you, and beg you
earnestly to give heed to the salvation of your soul, disciplining all
the lusts of the flesh by reason, and ever keeping the thought of God
built up in your soul, as in a very holy temple.  In every deed and
every word hold before your eyes the judgment of Christ, so that every
individual action, being referred to that exact and awful examination
may bring you glory in the day of retribution, when you win praise from
all creation.  If that great man <span
id="fr_2482"></span>[2483](#fn_2482) should be able to pay me a visit,
it would be a pleasure to me to see you here with him.
