<span id="ix.cxcviii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cxcviii-p1.1"></span>Letter CXCVII. <span
id="fr_2683"></span>[2684](#fn_2683.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cxcviii-p3"></span>*To Ambrose, bishop of Milan*. <span
id="fr_2684"></span>[2685](#fn_2684.md)

<span id="ix.cxcviii-p5"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxcviii-p5.1"></span>The</span> gifts of the Lord are ever great
and many; in greatness beyond measure, in number incalculable.  To those
who are not insensible of His mercy one of the greatest of these gifts
is that of which I am now availing myself, the opportunity allowed us,
far apart in place though we be, of addressing one another by letter. 
He grants us two means of becoming acquainted; one by personal
intercourse, another by epistolary correspondence.  Now I have become
acquainted with you through what you have said.  I do not mean that my
memory is impressed with your outward appearance, but that the beauty of
the inner man has been brought home to me by the rich variety of your
utterances, for <span id="page_235">p. 235</span> <span
id="ix.cxcviii-Page_235"></span>each of us “speaketh out of the
abundance of the heart.” <span id="fr_2685"></span>[2686](#fn_2685.md)   I
have given glory to God, Who in every generation selects those who are
well-pleasing to Him; Who of old indeed chose from the sheepfold a
prince for His people; <span id="fr_2686"></span>[2687](#fn_2686.md) Who
through the Spirit gifted Amos the herdman with power and raised him up
to be a prophet; Who now has drawn forth for the care of Christ’s flock
a man from the imperial city, entrusted with the government of a whole
nation, exalted in character, in lineage, in position, in eloquence, in
all that this world admires.  This same man has flung away all the
advantages of the world, counting them all loss that he may gain
Christ, <span id="fr_2687"></span>[2688](#fn_2687.md) and has taken in his
hand the helm of the ship, great and famous for its faith in God, the
Church of Christ.  Come, then, O man of God; not from men have you
received or been taught the Gospel of Christ; it is the Lord Himself who
has transferred you from the judges of the earth to the throne of the
Apostles; fight the good fight; heal the infirmity of the people, if any
are infected by the disease of Arian madness; renew the ancient
footprints of the Fathers.  You have laid the foundation of affection
towards me; strive to build upon it by the frequency of your
salutations.  Thus shall we be able to be near one another in spirit,
although our earthly homes are far apart.

<span id="ix.cxcviii-p9"></span>2.  By your earnestness and zeal in the
matter of the blessed bishop Dionysius you testify all your love to the
Lord, your honour for your predecessors, and your zeal for the faith. 
For our disposition towards our faithful fellow-servants is referred to
the Lord Whom they have served.  Whoever honours men that have contended
for the faith proves that he has like zeal for it.  One single action is
proof of much virtue.

<span id="ix.cxcviii-p10"></span>I wish to acquaint your love in Christ
that the very zealous brethren who have been commissioned by your
reverence to act for you in this good work have won praise for all the
clergy by the amiability of their manners; for by their individual
modesty and conciliatoriness they have shewn the sound condition of
all.  Moreover, with all zeal and diligence they have braved an
inclement season; and with unbroken perseverance have persuaded the
faithful guardians of the blessed body to transmit to them the custody
of what they have regarded as the safeguard of their lives.  And you
must understand that they are men who would never have been forced by
any human authority or sovereignty, had not the perseverance of these
brethren moved them to compliance.  No doubt a great aid to the
attainment of the object desired was the presence of our well beloved
and reverend son Therasius the presbyter.  He voluntarily undertook all
the toil of the journey; he moderated the energy of the faithful on the
spot; he persuaded opponents by his arguments; in the presence of
priests and deacons, and of many others who fear the Lord, he took up
the relics with all becoming reverence, and has aided the brethren in
their preservation.  These relics do you receive with a joy equivalent
to the distress with which their custodians have parted with them and
sent them to you.  Let none dispute; let none doubt.  Here you have that
unconquered athlete.  These bones, which shared in the conflict with the
blessed soul, are known to the Lord.  These bones He will crown,
together with that soul, in the righteous day of His requital, as it is
written, “we must stand before the judgment seat of Christ, that each
may give an account of the deeds he has done in the body.” <span
id="fr_2688"></span>[2689](#fn_2688.md)   One coffin held that honoured
corpse.  None other lay by his side.  The burial was a noble one; the
honours of a martyr were paid him.  Christians who had welcomed him as a
guest and then with their own hands laid him in the grave, have now
disinterred him.  They have wept as men bereaved of a father and a
champion.  But they have sent him to you, for they put your joy before
their own consolation.  Pious were the hands that gave; scrupulously
careful were the hands that received.  There has been no room for
deceit; no room for guile.  I bear witness to this.  Let the untainted
truth be accepted by you.
