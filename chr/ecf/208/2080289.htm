 journeys have taken me from home.&#160; I have been as far as Pisidia to settle the matters concerning the brethren in Isauria in concert with the Pisidian bishops.&#160; Thence I journeyed into Pontus, for Eustathius had caused no small disturbance at Dazimon, and had caused there a considerable secession from our church.&#160; I even went as far as the home of my brother Peter,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2824"></A><A HREF="#fn_2824"><FONT SIZE="1">2825</FONT></A>
 and, as this is not far from Neoc&aelig;sarea, there was occasion of considerable trouble to the Neoc&aelig;sareans, and of much rudeness to myself.&#160; Some men fled when no one was in pursuit.&#160; And I was supposed to be intruding uninvited, simply to get compliments from the folk there.&#160; As soon as I got home, after contracting a severe illness from the bad weather and my anxieties, I straightway received a letter from the East to tell me that Paulinus had had certain letters from the West addressed to him, in acknowledgement of a sort of higher claim; and that the Antiochene rebels were vastly elated by them, and were next preparing a form of creed, and offering to make its terms a condition of union with our Church.&#160; Besides all this it was reported to me that they had seduced to their faction that most excellent man Terentius.&#160; I wrote to him at once as forcibly as I could, to induce him to pause; and I tried to point out their disingenuousness.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.ccxvii-p5"></A> On this word <i>other</i> the Ben. note grounds the argument that Meletius had proposed a journey which Basil had not undertaken, and hence that the unnamed bishop of <i>Letter</i> ccxiii. is Meletius; and further that the fact of the bishop not being named in ccxiii., and the obscurity of this and of other letters, may indicate the writer&#146;s hesitation to put particulars in his letters which might be more discreetly left to be conveyed by word of mouth.</p>
