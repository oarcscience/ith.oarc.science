<span id="ix.ccxxx-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ccxxx-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXXIX. <span
id="fr_2933"></span>[2934](#fn_2933.md) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxxx-p3"></span>To the clergy of Nicopolis.

<span id="ix.ccxxx-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxxx-p4.1"></span>I am</span> sure that a work done by one or
two pious men is not done without the cooperation of the Holy Spirit. 
For when nothing merely human is put before us, when holy men are moved
to action with no thought of their own personal gratification, and with
the sole object of pleasing God, it is plain that it is the Lord Who is
directing their hearts.  When spiritually-minded men take the lead in
counsel, and the Lord’s people follow them with consentient hearts,
there can be no doubt that their decisions are arrived at with the
participation of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who poured out His blood for the
Churches’ sake.  You are therefore right in supposing that our very
God-beloved brother and fellow minister Pœmenius, <span
id="fr_2934"></span>[2935](#fn_2934.md) who arrived among you at an
opportune moment, and discovered this means of consoling you, has been
divinely moved.  I not only praise his discovery of the right course to
take; I much admire the firmness with which, without allowing any delay
to intervene, so as to slacken the energy of the petitioners, or to give
the opposite party an opportunity of taking precautions, and to set in
motion the counterplots of secret foes, he at once crowned his happy
course with a successful conclusion.  The Lord of His especial grace
keep him and his, so that the Church, as becomes her, may remain in a
succession in no way degenerate, and not give place to the evil one, who
now, if ever, is vexed at the firm establishment of the Churches.

<span id="ix.ccxxx-p6"></span>2.  I have also written at length to
exhort our brethren at Colonia.  You, moreover, are bound rather to put
up with their frame of mind than to increase their irritation, as though
you despised them for their insignificance, or provoked them to a
quarrel by your contempt.  It is only natural for disputants to act
without due counsel, and to manage their own affairs ill with the object
of vexing their opponents.  And no one is so small as not to be now able
to give an occasion, to those who want an occasion, for great troubles. 
I do not speak at random.  I speak from my own experience of my own
troubles.  From these may God keep you in answer to your prayers.  Pray
also for me, that I may have a successful journey, and, on my arrival,
may share your joy in your present pastor, and with you may find
consolation at the departure of our common father. <span
