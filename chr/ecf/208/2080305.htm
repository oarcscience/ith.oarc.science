 you rouse me to nightly toil; and by your sweet meats you seem to pledge yourself securely that all my body is in good case.&#160; But there is no munching for me at my time of life, for my teeth have long ago been worn away by time and bad health.&#160; As to what you have asked me there are some replies in the document I send you, written to the best of my ability, and as opportunity has allowed.</p>

Bas</i>. xxxv., thinks that this letter is to be placed either in the last days of 375, if the Nativity was celebrated on December 25, or in the beginning of 376, if it followed after the Epiphany.&#160; The Oriental usage up to the end of the fourth century, was to celebrate the Nativity and Baptism on January 6.&#160; St. Chrysostom, in the homily on the birthday of our Saviour, delivered c. 386, speaks of the separation of the celebration of the Nativity from that of the Epiphany as comparatively recent.&#160; <i>cf.</i> <i>D.C.A.</i>, 1, pp. 361, 617.</p>
