<span id="ix.cxxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cxxxviii-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXXVII. <span
id="fr_2446"></span>[2447](#fn_2446.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cxxxviii-p3"></span>*To Antipater, on his assuming the
governorship of Cappadocia*. <span id="fr_2447"></span>[2448](#fn_2447.md)

<span id="ix.cxxxviii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxxxviii-p5.1"></span>I do</span> now really feel the loss which
I suffer from being ill; so that, when such a man succeeds to the
government of my country, my having to nurse myself compels me to be
absent.  For a whole month I have been undergoing the treatment of
natural hot springs, in the hope of drawing some benefit from them.  But
I seem to be troubling myself to no purpose in my solitude, or indeed to
be deservedly a laughing stock to mankind, for not heeding the proverb
which says “warmth is no good to the dead.”  Even situated as I am, I am
very anxious to put aside everything else, and betake myself to <span
id="page_202">p. 202</span> <span id="ix.cxxxviii-Page_202"></span>your
excellency, that I may enjoy the benefit of all your high qualities, and
through your goodness settle all my home affairs here in a proper
manner.  The house of our reverend mother Palladia is my own, for I am
not only nearly related to her, but regard her as a mother on account of
her character.  Now, as some disturbance has been raised about her
house, I ask your excellency to postpone the enquiry for a little while,
and to wait till I come; not at all that justice may not be done, for I
had rather die ten thousand times than ask a favour of that kind from a
judge who is a friend of law and right, but that you may learn from me
by word of mouth matters which it would be unbecoming for me to write. 
If you do so you will in no wise fail in fealty to the truth, and we
shall suffer no harm.  I beg you then to keep the individual in
question <span id="fr_2448"></span>[2449](#fn_2448.md) in safe custody
under the charge of the troops, and not refuse to grant me this harmless
favour.
