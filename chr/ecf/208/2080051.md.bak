<span id="vii.xxii-p2"></span>Proof from Scripture that the Spirit is
called Lord.

<span id="vii.xxii-p3"></span>52.  <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xxii-p3.1"></span>But</span> why get an unfair victory for our
argument by fighting over these undignified questions, when it is within
our power to prove that the excellence of the glory is beyond dispute by
adducing more lofty considerations?  If, indeed, we repeat what we have
been taught by Scripture, every one of the Pneumatomachi will
peradventure raise a loud and vehement outcry, stop their ears, pick up
stones or anything else that comes to hand for a weapon, and charge
against us.  But our own security must not be regarded by us before the
truth.  We have learnt from the Apostle, “the Lord direct your hearts
into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ” <span
id="fr_1157"></span>[1158](#fn_1157.md) *for our tribulations*.  Who is the
Lord that directs into the love of God and into the patient waiting for
Christ for tribulations?  Let those men answer us who are for making a
slave of the Holy Spirit.  For if the argument had been about God the
Father, it would certainly have said, ‘the Lord direct you into His own
love,’ or if about the Son, it would have added ‘into His own
patience.’  Let them then seek what other Person there is who is worthy
to be honoured with the title of Lord.  And parallel with this is that
other passage, “and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one
toward another, and toward all men, even as we do towards you; to the
end He may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God, even
our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His
saints.” <span id="fr_1158"></span>[1159](#fn_1158.md)   Now what Lord does
he entreat to stablish the hearts of the faithful at Thessalonica,
unblamable in holiness before God even our Father, at the coming of our
Lord?  Let those answer who place the Holy Ghost among the ministering
spirits that are sent forth on service.  They cannot.  Wherefore let
them hear yet another testimony which distinctly calls the Spirit Lord. 
“The Lord,” it is said, “is that Spirit;” and again “even as from the
Lord the Spirit.” <span id="fr_1159"></span>[1160](#fn_1159.md)   But to
leave no ground for objection, I will quote the actual words of the
Apostle;—“For even unto this day remaineth the same veil untaken away in
the reading of the Old Testament, which veil is done away in
Christ.…Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be
taken away.  Now the Lord is that Spirit.” <span
id="fr_1160"></span>[1161](#fn_1160.md)   Why does he speak thus?  Because
he who abides in the bare sense of the letter, and in it busies himself
with the observances of the Law, has, as it were, got his own heart
enveloped in the Jewish acceptance of the letter, like a veil; and this
befalls him because of his ignorance that the bodily observance of the
Law is done away by the presence of Christ, in that for the future the
types are transferred to the reality.  Lamps are made needless by the
advent of the sun; and, on the appearance of the truth, the occupation
of the Law is gone, and prophecy is hushed into silence.  He, on the
contrary, who has been empowered to look down into the depth of the
meaning of the Law, and, after passing through the obscurity of the
letter, as through a veil, to arrive within things unspeakable, is like
Moses taking off the veil when he spoke with God.  He, too, turns from
the letter to the Spirit.  So with the veil on the face of Moses
corresponds the obscurity of the teaching of the Law, and spiritual
contemplation with the turning to the Lord.  He, then, who in the
reading of the Law takes away the letter and turns to the Lord,—and the
Lord is now called the <span id="page_34">p. 34</span> <span
id="vii.xxii-Page_34"></span>Spirit,—becomes moreover like Moses, who
had his face glorified by the manifestation of God.  For just as objects
which lie near brilliant colours are themselves tinted by the brightness
which is shed around, so is he who fixes his gaze firmly on the Spirit
by the Spirit’s glory somehow transfigured into greater splendour,
having his heart lighted up, as it were, by some light streaming from
the truth of the Spirit. <span id="fr_1161"></span>[1162](#fn_1161.md)  
And, this is “being changed from <span
id="fr_1162"></span>[1163](#fn_1162.md) the glory” of the Spirit “into” His
own “glory,” not in niggard degree, nor dimly and indistinctly, but as
we might expect any one to be who is enlightened by <span
id="fr_1163"></span>[1164](#fn_1163.md) the Spirit.  Do you not, O man,
fear the Apostle when he says “Ye are the temple of God, and the Spirit
of God dwelleth in you”? <span id="fr_1164"></span>[1165](#fn_1164.md)  
Could he ever have brooked to honour with the title of “temple” the
quarters of a slave?  How can he who calls Scripture
“God-inspired,” <span id="fr_1165"></span>[1166](#fn_1165.md) because it
was written through the inspiration of the Spirit, use the language of
one who insults and belittles Him?

<span id="vii.xxii-p4"></span> [2 Thess. iii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#005.md)<span id="vii.xxii-p4.1"></span>.  A
note of the Benedictine Editors on this passage says:  “It must be
admitted that these words are not found in the sacred text and are
wanting in three manuscripts of this work.  Moreover, in the *Regius
Quintus* they are only inserted by a second hand, but since they are
shortly afterwards repeated by Basil, as though taken from the sacred
context, I am unwilling to delete them, and it is more probable that
they were withdrawn from the manuscripts from which they are wanting
because they were not found in the apostle, then added, without any
reason at all, to the manuscripts in which they occur.”
