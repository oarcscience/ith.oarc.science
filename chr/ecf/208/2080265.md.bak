<span id="ix.cxciii-p3"></span>*To Sophronius the Master*.

<span id="ix.cxciii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxciii-p4.1"></span>With</span> your extraordinary zeal in good
deeds you have written to me to say that you yourself owe me double
thanks; first, for getting a letter from me, and secondly, for doing me
a service.  What thanks, then, must not I owe you, both for reading your
most delightful words, and for finding what I hoped for so quickly
accomplished!  The message was exceedingly gratifying on its own
account, but it gave me much greater gratification from the fact that
you were the friend to whom I owed the boon.  God grant that ere long I
may see you, and return you thanks in words, and enjoy the great
pleasure of your society.
