<span id="ix.xxxix-p1"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="ix.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXVIII. <span
id="fr_2021"></span>[2022](#fn_2021.md) </span>

<span id="ix.xxxix-p3"></span>*To his Brother Gregory, concerning the
difference between* <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xxxix-p3.1"></span>οὐσία</span> *and* <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xxxix-p3.2"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xxxix-p3.3"></span>πόστασις</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xxxix-p3.4"></span> .</span>

<span id="ix.xxxix-p4"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xxxix-p4.1"></span>Many</span> persons, in their study of the
sacred dogmas, failing to distinguish between what is common in the
essence or substance, and the meaning of the hypostases, arrive at the
same notions, and think that it makes no difference whether <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.xxxix-p4.2"></span>οὐσία</span> or hypostasis
be spoken of.  The result is that some of those who accept statements on
these subjects without any enquiry, are pleased to speak of “one
hypostasis,” just as they do of one “essence” or “substance;” while on
the other hand those who accept three hypostases are under the idea that
they are bound in accordance with this confession, to assert also, by
numerical analogy, three essences or substances.  Under these
circumstances, lest you fall into similar error, I have composed a short
treatise for you by way of memorandum.  The meaning of the words, to put
it shortly, is as follows:

<span id="ix.xxxix-p5"></span>2.  Of all nouns the sense of some, which
are predicated of subjects plural and numerically various, is more
general; as for instance *man*.  When we so say, we employ the noun to
indicate the common nature, and do not confine our meaning to any one
man in particular who is known by that name.  Peter, for instance is no
more *man*, than Andrew, John, or James.  The predicate therefore being
common, and extending to all the individuals ranked under the same name,
requires some note of distinction whereby we may understand not man in
general, but Peter or John in particular.

<span id="ix.xxxix-p6"></span>Of some nouns on the other hand the
denotation is more limited; and by the aid of the limitation we have
before our minds not the common nature, but a limitation of anything,
having, so far as the peculiarity extends, nothing in common with what
is of the same kind; as for instance, Paul or Timothy.  For, in a word,
of this kind there is no extension to what is common in the nature;
there is a separation of certain circumscribed conceptions from the
general idea, and expression of them by means of their names.  Suppose
then that two or more are set together, as, for instance, Paul,
Silvanus, and Timothy, and that an enquiry is made into the essence or
substance of humanity; no one will give one definition of essence or
substance in the case of Paul, a second in that of Silvanus, and a third
in that of Timothy; but the same words which have been employed in
setting forth the essence or substance of Paul will apply to the others
also.  Those who are described by the same definition of essence or
substance are of the same essence or substance <span
id="fr_2022"></span>[2023](#fn_2022.md) when the enquirer has learned what
is common, and turns his attention to the differentiating properties
whereby one is distinguished from another, the definition by which each
is known will no longer tally in all particulars with the definition of
another, even though in some points it be found to agree.

<span id="ix.xxxix-p8"></span>3.  My statement, then, is this.  That
which is spoken of in a special and peculiar manner is indicated by the
name of the hypostasis.  Suppose we say “a man.”  The indefinite meaning
of the word strikes a certain vague sense upon the ears.  The nature is
indicated, but what subsists and is specially and peculiarly indicated
by the name is not made plain.  Suppose we say “Paul.”  We set forth, by
what is indicated by the name, the nature subsisting. <span
id="fr_2023"></span>[2024](#fn_2023.md)

<span id="ix.xxxix-p10"></span>This then is the hypostasis, or
“*understanding*;” not the indefinite conception of the essence or
substance, which, because what is signified is general, finds no
“*standing*,” but the conception which by means of <span
id="page_138">p. 138</span> <span id="ix.xxxix-Page_138"></span>the
expressed peculiarities gives *standing* and circumscription to the
general and uncircumscribed.  It is customary in Scripture to make a
distinction of this kind, as well in many other passages as in the
History of Job.  When purposing to narrate the events of his life, Job
first mentions the common, and says “a man;” then he straightway
particularizes by adding “a certain.” <span
id="fr_2024"></span>[2025](#fn_2024.md)   As to the description of the
essence, as having no bearing on the scope of his work, he is silent,
but by means of particular notes of identity, mentioning the place and
points of character, and such external qualifications as would
individualize, and separate from the common and general idea, he
specifies the “certain man,” in such a way that from name, place, mental
qualities, and outside circumstances, the description of the man whose
life is being narrated is made in all particulars perfectly clear.  If
he had been giving an account of the essence, there would not in his
explanation of the nature have been any mention of these matters.  The
same moreover would have been the account that there is in the case of
Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and each of the men there
mentioned. <span id="fr_2025"></span>[2026](#fn_2025.md)   Transfer, then,
to the divine dogmas the same standard of difference which you recognise
in the case both of essence and of hypostasis in human affairs, and you
will not go wrong.  Whatever your thought suggests to you as to the mode
of the existence of the Father, you will think also in the case of the
Son, and in like manner too of the Holy Ghost.  For it is idle to bait
the mind at any detached conception from the conviction that it is
beyond all conception. <span id="fr_2026"></span>[2027](#fn_2026.md)   For
the account of the uncreate and of the incomprehensible is one and the
same in the case of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. 
For one is not more incomprehensible and uncreate than another.  And
since it is necessary, by means of the notes of differentiation, in the
case of the Trinity, to keep the distinction unconfounded, we shall not
take into consideration, in order to estimate that which differentiates,
what is contemplated in common, as the uncreate, or what is beyond all
comprehension, or any quality of this nature; we shall only direct our
attention to the enquiry by what means each particular conception will
be lucidly and distinctly separated from that which is conceived of in
common.

<span id="ix.xxxix-p14"></span>4.  Now the proper way to direct our
investigation seems to me to be as follows.  We say that every good
thing, which by God’s providence befalls us, is an operation, of the
Grace which worketh in us all things, as the apostle says, “But all
these worketh that one and the self same Spirit dividing to every man
severally as he will.” <span id="fr_2027"></span>[2028](#fn_2027.md)   If
we ask, if the supply of good things which thus comes to the saints has
its origin in the Holy Ghost alone, we are on the other hand guided by
Scripture to the belief that of the supply of the good things which are
wrought in us through the Holy Ghost, the Originator and Cause is the
Only-begotten God; <span id="fr_2028"></span>[2029](#fn_2028.md) for we are
taught by Holy Scripture that “All things were made by Him,” <span
id="fr_2029"></span>[2030](#fn_2029.md) and “by Him consist.” <span
id="fr_2030"></span>[2031](#fn_2030.md)   When we are exalted to this
conception, again, led by God-inspired guidance, we are taught that by
that power all things are brought from non-being into being, but yet not
by that power to the exclusion of origination. <span
id="fr_2031"></span>[2032](#fn_2031.md)   On the other hand there is a
certain power subsisting without generation and without
origination, <span id="fr_2032"></span>[2033](#fn_2032.md) which is the
cause of the cause of all things.  For the Son, by whom are all things,
and with whom the Holy Ghost is inseparably conceived of, is of the
Father. <span id="fr_2033"></span>[2034](#fn_2033.md)   For it is not
possible for any one to conceive of the Son if he be not previously
enlightened by the Spirit.  Since, then, the Holy Ghost, from Whom all
the supply of good things for creation has its source, is attached to
the Son, and with Him is inseparably apprehended, and has Its <span
id="fr_2034"></span>[2035](#fn_2034.md) being attached to the Father, as
cause, from Whom also It proceeds; It has this note of Its peculiar
hypostatic nature, that It is known after the Son <span
id="fr_2035"></span>[2036](#fn_2035.md) and together with the Son, and that
It has Its subsistence of the Father.  The Son, Who declares the Spirit
proceeding from the Father through Himself and with Himself, shining
forth alone and by only-begetting from the unbegotten light, so far as
the peculiar notes are concerned, has nothing in common either with the
Father or with <span id="page_139">p. 139</span> <span
id="ix.xxxix-Page_139"></span>the Holy Ghost.  He alone is known by the
stated signs.  But God, Who is over all, alone has, as one special mark
of His own hypostasis, His being Father, and His deriving His
hypostasis <span id="fr_2036"></span>[2037](#fn_2036.md) from no cause; and
through this mark He is peculiarly known.  Wherefore in the communion of
the substance we maintain that there is no mutual approach or
intercommunion of those notes of indication perceived in the Trinity,
whereby is set forth the proper peculiarity of the Persons delivered in
the faith, each of these being distinctively apprehended by His own
notes.  Hence, in accordance with the stated signs of indication,
discovery is made of the separation of the hypostases; while so far as
relates to the infinite, the incomprehensible, the uncreate, the
uncircumscribed, and similar attributes, there is no variableness in the
life-giving nature; in that, I mean, of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but
in Them is seen a certain communion indissoluble and continuous.  And by
the same considerations, whereby a reflective student could perceive the
greatness of any one of the (Persons) believed in in the Holy Trinity,
he will proceed without variation.  Beholding the glory in Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost, his mind all the while recognises no void interval
wherein it may travel between Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, for there is
nothing inserted between Them; nor beyond the divine nature is there
anything so subsisting as to be able to divide that nature from itself
by the interposition of any foreign matter.  Neither is there any vacuum
of interval, void of subsistence, which can make a break in the mutual
harmony of the divine essence, and solve the continuity by the
interjection of emptiness.  He who perceives the Father, and perceives
Him by Himself, has at the same time mental perception of the Son; and
he who receives the Son does not divide Him from the Spirit, but, in
consecution so far as order is concerned, in conjunction so far as
nature is concerned, expresses the faith commingled in himself in the
three together.  He who makes mention of the Spirit alone, embraces also
in this confession Him of whom He is the Spirit.  And since the Spirit
is Christ’s and of God, <span id="fr_2037"></span>[2038](#fn_2037.md) as
says Paul, then just as he who lays hold on one end of the chain pulls
the other to him, so he who “draws the Spirit,” <span
id="fr_2038"></span>[2039](#fn_2038.md) as says the prophet, by His means
draws to him at the same time both the Son and the Father.  And if any
one verily receives the Son, he will hold Him on both sides, the Son
drawing towards him on the one His own Father, and on the other His own
Spirit.  For He who eternally exists in the Father can never be cut off
from the Father, nor can He who worketh all things by the Spirit ever be
disjoined from His own Spirit.  Likewise moreover he who receives the
Father virtually receives at the same time both the Son and the Spirit;
for it is in no wise possible to entertain the idea of severance or
division, in such a way as that the Son should be thought of apart from
the Father, or the Spirit be disjoined from the Son.  But the communion
and the distinction apprehended in Them are, in a certain sense,
ineffable and inconceivable, the continuity of nature being never rent
asunder by the distinction of the hypostases, nor the notes of proper
distinction confounded in the community of essence.  Marvel not then at
my speaking of the same thing as being both conjoined and parted, and
thinking as it were darkly in a riddle, of a certain <span
id="fr_2039"></span>[2040](#fn_2039.md) new and strange conjoined
separation and separated conjunction.  Indeed, even in objects
perceptible to the senses, any one who approaches the subject in a
candid and uncontentious spirit, may find similar conditions of things.

<span id="ix.xxxix-p28"></span>5.  Yet receive what I say as at best a
token and reflexion of the truth; not as the actual truth itself.  For
it is not possible that there should be complete correspondence between
what is seen in the tokens and the objects in reference to which the use
of tokens is adopted.  Why then do I say that an analogy of the separate
and the conjoined is found in objects perceptible to the senses?  You
have before now, in springtime, beheld the brightness of the bow in the
cloud; the bow, I mean, which, in our common parlance, is called Iris,
and is said by persons skilled in such matters to be formed when a
certain moisture is mingled with the air, and the force of the winds
expresses what is dense and moist in the vapour, after it has become
cloudy, into rain.  The bow is said to be formed as follows.  When the
sunbeam, after traversing obliquely the dense and darkened portion of
the cloud-formation, has directly cast its own orb on some cloud, the
radiance is then reflected back from what is moist and shining, and the
result is a bending and return, as it were, of the light upon itself. 
For flame-like flashings are so constituted that if they <span
id="page_140">p. 140</span> <span id="ix.xxxix-Page_140"></span>fall on
any smooth surface they are refracted on themselves; and the shape of
the sun, which by means of the beam is formed on the moist and smooth
part of the air, is round.  The necessary consequence therefore is that
the air adjacent to the cloud is marked out by means of the radiant
brilliance in conformity with the shape of the sun’s disc.  Now this
brilliance is both continuous and divided.  It is of many colours; it is
of many forms; it is insensibly steeped in the variegated bright tints
of its dye; imperceptibly abstracting from our vision the combination of
many coloured things, with the result that no space, mixing or paring
within itself the difference of colour, can be discerned either between
blue and flame-coloured, or between flame-coloured and red, or between
red and amber.  For all the rays, seen at the same time, are far
shining, and while they give no signs of their mutual combination, are
incapable of being tested, so that it is impossible to discover the
limits of the flame-coloured or of the emerald portion of the light, and
at what point each originates before it appears as it does in glory.  As
then in the token we clearly distinguish the difference of the colours,
and yet it is impossible for us to apprehend by our senses any interval
between them; so in like manner conclude, I pray you, that you may
reason concerning the divine dogmas; that the peculiar properties of the
hypostases, like colours seen in the Iris, flash their brightness on
each of the Persons Whom we believe to exist in the Holy Trinity; but
that of the proper nature no difference can be conceived as existing
between one and the other, the peculiar characteristics shining, in
community of essence, upon each.  Even in our example, the essence
emitting the many-coloured radiance, and refracted by the sunbeam, was
one essence; it is the colour of the phænomenon which is multiform.  My
argument thus teaches us, even by the aid of the visible creation, not
to feel distressed at points of doctrine whenever we meet with questions
difficult of solution, and when at the thought of accepting what is
proposed to us, our brains begin to reel.  In regard to visible objects
experience appears better than theories of causation, and so in matters
transcending all knowledge, the apprehension of argument is inferior to
the faith which teaches us at once the distinction in hypostasis and the
conjunction in essence.  Since then our discussion has included both
what is common and what is distinctive in the Holy Trinity, the common
is to be understood as referring to the essence; the hypostasis on the
other hand is the several distinctive sign. <span
id="fr_2040"></span>[2041](#fn_2040.md)

<span id="ix.xxxix-p30"></span>6.  It may however be thought that the
account here given of the hypostasis does not tally with the sense of
the Apostle’s words, where he says concerning the Lord that He is “the
brightness of His glory, and the express image of His person,” <span
id="fr_2041"></span>[2042](#fn_2041.md) for if we have taught hypostasis to
be the conflux of the several properties; and if it is confessed that,
as in the case of the Father something is contemplated as proper and
peculiar, whereby He alone is known, so in the same way is it believed
about the Only-begotten; how then does Scripture in this place ascribe
the name of the hypostasis to the Father alone, and describes the Son as
form of the hypostasis, and designated not by His own proper notes, but
by those of the Father?  For if the hypostasis is the sign of several
existence, and the property of the Father is confined to the unbegotten
being, and the Son is fashioned according to His Father’s properties,
then the term unbegotten can no longer be predicated exclusively of the
Father, the existence of the Only-begotten being denoted by the
distinctive note of the Father.

<span id="ix.xxxix-p32"></span>7.  My opinion is, however, that in this
passage the Apostle’s argument is directed to a different end; and it is
looking to this that he uses the terms “brightness of glory,” and
“express image of person.”  Whoever keeps this carefully in view will
find nothing that clashes with what I have said, but that the argument
is conducted in a special and peculiar sense.  For the object of the
apostolic argument is not the distinction of the hypostases from one
another by means of the apparent notes; it is rather the apprehension of
the natural, inseparable, and close relationship of the Son to the
Father.  He does not say “Who being the glory of the Father” (although
in truth He is); he omits this as admitted, and then in the endeavour to
teach that we must not think of one form of glory in the case of the
Father and of another in that of the Son, He defines the glory of the
Only-begotten as the brightness of the glory of the Father, and, by the
use of the example of the light, causes the Son to be thought of in
indisso<span id="page_141">p. 141</span> <span
id="ix.xxxix-Page_141"></span>luble association with the Father.  For
just as the brightness is emitted by the flame, and the brightness is
not after the flame, but at one and the same moment the flame shines and
the light beams brightly, so does the Apostle mean the Son to be thought
of as deriving existence from the Father, and yet the Only-begotten not
to be divided from the existence of the Father by any intervening
extension in space, but the caused to be always conceived of together
with the cause.  Precisely in the same manner, as though by way of
interpretation of the meaning of the preceding cause, and with the
object of guiding us to the conception of the invisible by means of
material examples, he speaks also of “express image of person.”  For as
the body is wholly in form, and yet the definition of the body and the
definition of the form are distinct, and no one wishing to give the
definition of the one would be found in agreement with that of the
other; and yet, even if in theory you separate the form from the body,
nature does not admit of the distinction, and both are inseparably
apprehended; just so the Apostle thinks that even if the doctrine of the
faith represents the difference of the hypostases as unconfounded and
distinct, he is bound by his language to set forth also the continuous
and as it were concrete relation of the Only-begotten to the Father. 
And this he states, not as though the Only-begotten had not also a
hypostatic being, but in that the union does not admit of anything
intervening between the Son and the Father, with the result that he, who
with his soul’s eyes fixes his gaze earnestly on the express image of
the Only-begotten, is made perceptive also of the hypostasis of the
Father.  Yet the proper quality contemplated in them is not subject to
change, nor yet to commixture, in such wise as that we should attribute
either an origin of generation to the Father or an origin without
generation to the Son, but so that if we could compass the impossibility
of detaching one from the other, that one might be apprehended severally
and alone, for, since the mere name implies the Father, it is not
possible that any one should even name the Son without apprehending the
Father. <span id="fr_2042"></span>[2043](#fn_2042.md)

<span id="ix.xxxix-p34"></span>8.  Since then, as says the Lord in the
Gospels, <span id="fr_2043"></span>[2044](#fn_2043.md) he that hath seen
the Son sees the Father also; on this account he says that the
Only-begotten is the express image of His Father’s person.  That this
may be made still plainer I will quote also other passages of the
apostle in which he calls the Son “the image of the invisible
God,” <span id="fr_2044"></span>[2045](#fn_2044.md) and again “image of His
goodness;” <span id="fr_2045"></span>[2046](#fn_2045.md) not because the
image differs from the Archetype according to the definition of
indivisibility and goodness, but that it may be shewn that it is the
same as the prototype, even though it be different.  For the idea of the
image would be lost were it not to preserve throughout the plain and
invariable likeness.  He therefore that has perception of the beauty of
the image is made perceptive of the Archetype.  So he, who has, as it
were mental apprehension of the form of the Son, prints the express
image of the Father’s hypostasis, beholding the latter in the former,
not beholding in the reflection the unbegotten being of the Father (for
thus there would be complete identity and no distinction), but gazing at
the unbegotten beauty in the Begotten.  Just as he who in a polished
mirror beholds the reflection of the form as plain knowledge of the
represented face, so he, who has knowledge of the Son, through his
knowledge of the Son receives in his heart the express image of the
Father’s Person.  For all things that are the Father’s are beheld in the
Son, and all things that are the Son’s are the Father’s; because the
whole Son is in the Father and has all the Father in Himself. <span
id="fr_2046"></span>[2047](#fn_2046.md)   Thus the hypostasis of the Son
becomes as it were form and face of the knowledge of the Father, and the
hypostasis of the Father is known in the form of the Son, while the
proper quality which is contemplated therein remains for the plain
distinction of the hypostases.

<span id="ix.xxxix-p23"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xxxix-p23.1"></span>μετὰ τὸν υἱ& 231·ν</span>.  So the
Benedictine text with four <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xxxix-p23.2"></span>mss.</span> in the Paris Library, and the
note.  “<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.xxxix-p23.3"></span>μετὰ τοῦ
υἱοῦ</span>” is a reading which is inadmissible, repeating as it does
the sense of the following clause <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xxxix-p23.4"></span>καὶ σὺν αὐτῷ</span>.  The sense in which the
Son is both “after the Son” and “with the Son” is explained further on
by St. Basil, where he says that the three Persons are known in
consecution of order but in conjunction of nature.

<span id="ix.xxxix-p26"></span> Apparently a mistaken interpretation of
the LXX. version of [Ps. cxix.
131](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#131.md)<span id="ix.xxxix-p26.1"></span>,
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.xxxix-p26.2"></span>εἵλκυσα

id="ix.xxxix-p27.4"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span

class="Greek"><span id="ix.xxxix-p27.7"></span>ξ αἰνιγμάτων</span>, as
in Æsch., *Ag*. 1113=by dark hints.  The bold oxymoron concluding this
sentence is illustrated by Ovid’s “*impietate pia*” (*Met*. viii. 477),
Lucan’s “*concordia discors*” (*Phars.* i. 98), or Tennyson’s “faith
unfaithful.”

id="ix.xxxix-p28.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxxix-p29"></span> The scientific part of the analogy of
the rainbow is of course obsolete and valueless.  The general principle
holds good that what is beyond comprehension in theology finds its
parallel in what is beyond comprehension in the visible world.  We are
not to be staggered and turn dizzy in either sphere of thought at the
discovery that we have reached a limit beyond which thought cannot go. 
We may live in a finite world, though infinite space is beyond our
powers of thought:  we may trust in God revealed in the Trinity, though
we cannot analyse or define Him.

<span id="ix.xxxix-p33"></span> The simpler explanation of the use of
the word hypostasis in the passage under discussion is that it has the
earlier sense, equivalent to <span class="Greek"><span
