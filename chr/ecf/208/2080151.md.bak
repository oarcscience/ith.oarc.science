<span id="ix.lxxix-p3"></span>*Without inscription, on behalf of
Elpidius*.

<span id="ix.lxxix-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxxix-p4.1"></span>I have</span> not failed to observe the
interest you have shown in our venerable friend Elpidius; and how with
your usual intelligence you have given the prefect an opportunity of
showing his kindness.  What I am now writing to ask you is to make this
favour complete and suggest to the prefect that he should by a
particular order set over our city the man who is full of all possible
care for the public interests.  You will therefore have many admirable
reasons to urge upon the prefect for his ordering Elpidius to remain at
Cæsarea.  There is at all events no need for you to be taught by me,
since you yourself know only too well, what is the position of affairs,
and how capable Elpidius in administration.
