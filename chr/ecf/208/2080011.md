<span id="vi.i.v"></span>

<span id="vi.i.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.i.v-p1.1"></span>V.—The Presbyterate.</span>

<span id="vi.i.v-p2"></span>Not long after the accession of Valens,
Basil was ordained presbyter by Eusebius. <span
id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md)   An earlier date has been suggested,
but the year 364 is accepted as fitting in better with the words of
Gregory <span id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104.md) on the free speech
conceded to heretics.  And from the same Letter it may be concluded that
the ordination of Basil, like that of Gregory himself, was not wholly
voluntary, and that he was forced against his inclinations to accept
duties when he hesitated as to his liking and fitness for them.  It was
about this time that he wrote his Books against Eunomius; <span
id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md) and it may possibly have been this
work which specially com<span id="page_xx">p. xx</span> <span
id="vi.i.v-Page_xx"></span>mended him to Eusebius.  However this may be,
there is no doubt that he was soon actively engaged in the practical
work of the diocese, and made himself very useful to Eusebius.  But
Basil’s very vigour and value seem to have been the cause of some
alienation between him and his bishop.  His friend Gregory gives us no
details, but it may be inferred from what he says that he thought Basil
ill-used. <span id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md)   And allusions of
Basil have been supposed to imply his own sense of discourtesy and
neglect. <span id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md)   The position became
serious.  Bishops who had objected to the tumultuary nomination of
Eusebius, and had with difficulty been induced to maintain the
lawfulness of his consecration, were ready to consecrate Basil in his
place.  But Basil shewed at once his wisdom and his magnanimity.  A
division of the orthodox clergy of Cappadocia would be full of danger to
the cause.  He would accept no personal advancement to the damage of the
Church.  He retired with his friend Gregory to his Pontic
monasteries, <span id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) and won the battle
by flying from the field.  Eusebius was left unmolested, and the
character of Basil was higher than ever. <span
id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md)

<span id="vi.i.v-p10"></span>The seclusion of Basil in Pontus seemed to
afford an opportunity to his opponents in Cappadocia, and according to
Sozomen, <span id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) Valens himself, in 365,
was moved to threaten Cæsarea with a visit by the thought that the
Catholics of Cappadocia were now deprived of the aid of their strongest
champion.  Eusebius would have invoked Gregory, and left Basil alone. 
Gregory, however, refused to act without his friend, and, with much tact
and good feeling, succeeded in atoning the two offended parties. <span
id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md)   Eusebius at first resented Gregory’s
earnest advocacy of his absent friend, and was inclined to resent what
seemed the somewhat impertinent interference of a junior.  But Gregory
happily appealed to the archbishop’s sense of justice and superiority to
the common unwillingness of high dignitaries to accept counsel, and
assured him that in all that he had written on the subject he had meant
to avoid all possible offence, and to keep within the bounds of
spiritual and philosophic discipline. <span
id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md)   Basil returned to the metropolitan
city, ready to cooperate loyally with Eusebius, and to employ all his
eloquence and learning against the proposed Arian aggression.  To the
grateful Catholics it seemed as though the mere knowledge that Basil was
in Cæsarea was enough to turn Valens with his bishops to flight, <span
id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md) and the tidings, brought by a furious
rider, of the revolt of Procopius, <span
id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md) seemed a comparatively insignificant
motive for the emperor’s departure.

<span id="vi.i.v-p16"></span>There was now a lull in the storm.  Basil,
completely reconciled to Eusebius, began to consolidate the
archiepiscopal power which he afterward wielded as his own, <span
id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md) over the various provinces in which
the metropolitan of Cæsarea exercised exarchic authority. <span
id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md)   In the meantime the Semiarians were
beginning to share with the Catholics the hardships inflicted by the
imperial power.  At Lampsacus in 364 they had condemned the results of
Ariminum and Constantinople, and had reasserted the Antiochene
Dedication Creed of 341.  In 366 they sent deputies to Liberius at Rome,
who proved their orthodoxy by subscribing the Nicene Creed.  Basil had
not been present at Lampsacus, <span id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md)
but he had met Eustathius and other bishops on their way thither, and
had no doubt influenced the decisions of the synod.  Now the deputation
to the West consisted of three of those bishops with whom he was in
communication, Eustathius of Sebasteia, Silvanus of Tarsus, and
Theophilus of Castabala.  To the first it was an opportunity for
regaining a position among the orthodox prelates.  It can hardly have
been without the persuasion of Basil that the deputation went so far as
they did in accepting the homoousion, but it is a little singular, and
indicative of the comparatively slow awakening of the Church in general
to the perils of the degradation of the Holy Ghost, that no profession
of faith was demanded from the Lampsacene delegates on this
subject. <span id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md)   In 367 the council of
Tyana accepted the restitution of the Semiarian bishops, and so far
peace had been promoted. <span id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md)   To
this period may very probably be referred the compilation of the Liturgy
which formed the basis of that which bears Basil’s name. <span
id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md)   The claims of theology and of
ecclesiastical administration in Basil’s <span id="page_xxi">p.
xxi</span> <span id="vi.i.v-Page_xxi"></span>time did not, however,
prevent him from devoting much of his vast energy to works of charity. 
Probably the great hospital for the housing and relief of travellers and
the poor, which he established in the suburbs of Cæsarea, was planned,
if not begun, in the latter years of his presbyterate, for its size and
importance were made pretexts for denouncing him to Elias, the governor
of Cappadocia, in 372, <span id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) and at
the same period Valens contributed to its endowment.  It was so
extensive as to go by the name of Newtown, <span
id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) and was in later years known as the
“Basileiad.” <span id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md)   It was the mother
of other similar institutions in the country-districts of the province,
each under a Chorepiscopus. <span id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md)  
But whether the Ptochotrophium <span id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md)
was or was not actually begun before Basil’s episcopate, great demands
were made on his sympathy and energy by the great drought and consequent
famine which befell Cæsarea in 368. <span
id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md)   He describes it with eloquence in
his Homily *On the Famine and Drought*. <span
id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md)   The distress was cruel and
widespread.  The distance of Cæsarea from the coast increased the
difficulty of supplying provisions.  Speculators, scratching, as it
were, in their country’s wounds, hoarded grain in the hope of selling at
famine prices.  These Basil moved to open their stores.  He distributed
lavishly at his own expense, <span id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md) and
ministered in person to the wants of the sufferers.  Gregory of
Nazianzus <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) gives us a picture of
his illustrious friend standing in the midst of a great crowd of men and
women and children, some scarcely able to breathe; of servants bringing
in piles of such food as is best suited to the weak state of the
famishing sufferers; of Basil with his own hands distributing
nourishment, and with his own voice cheering and encouraging the
sufferers.

<span id="vi.i.v-p32"></span>About this time Basil suffered a great loss
in the death of his mother, <span id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) and
sought solace in a visit to his friend Eusebius at Samosata. <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md)   But the cheering effect of his
journey was lessened by the news, which greeted him on his return, that
the Arians had succeeded in placing one of their number in the see of
Tarsus. <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md)    The loss of Silvanus
was ere long followed by a death of yet graver moment to the Church.  In
the middle of 370 died Eusebius, breathing his last in the arms of
Basil. <span id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md)

<span id="vi.i.v-p3"></span> It will have been noted that I have
accepted the authority of Philostorgius that he was already deacon.  The
argument employed by Tillemont against this statement is the fact of no
distinct diaconate being mentioned by Gregory of Nazianzus.  But the
silence of Gregory does not conclusively outweigh the distinct <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.i.v-p3.1"></span>ἔ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.i.v-p3.2"></span>τι τάξιν διακόνου
ἔχων</span> of Philostorgius; and a diaconate is supported by the
mistaken statement of Socrates (*H.E*. iv. 26) that the deacon’s orders
were conferred by Meletius.

<span id="vi.i.v-p8"></span> Gregory has no doubt that Eusebius was in

Basil fled Gregory here (*id*. 29) calls <span class="Greek"><span

Aristophanes (*Clouds*, 94) of the house or school of Socrates, and
apparently a comic parody on <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.i.v-p8.4"></span>δικαστήριον</span>.  It might be rendered
“reflectory.”  “Contemplatory” has been suggested.  It is to be noted
that Basil in the *De Sp. Scto*. (see p. 49, n.) appears to allude to
the Acharnians.  The friends probably read Aristophanes together at
Athens.

ἀφειδῶς ἀναλώσας τοῖς πένησι καὶ μάλιστα ἐν τῷ τῆς σιτοδείας καιρῷ, καθ᾽

καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα, μηδὲ τῶν ὑπολειφθέντων φεισάμενος</span>.  Maran (*Vit.
Bas*. xi. § 4), with the object of proving that Basil had completely
abandoned all property whatsoever, says that this must refer to a legacy
from his mother.  The terms used are far more consistent with the view
already expressed (§ III.).  So in his *Orat. in Bas*. Gregory speaks of
Basil at the time as “selling his own possessions, and buying provisions
with the proceeds.”
