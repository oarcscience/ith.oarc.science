<span id="ix.lxxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.lxxxix-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXXVIII. <span
id="fr_2297"></span>[2298](#fn_2297.md) </span>

<span id="ix.lxxxix-p3"></span>*Without address on the subject of the
exaction of taxes*.

<span id="ix.lxxxix-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxxxix-p4.1"></span>Your</span> excellency knows better than any
one else the difficulty of getting together the gold furnished by
contribution. <span id="fr_2298"></span>[2299](#fn_2298.md)   We have no
better witness to our poverty than yourself, for with your great
kindness you have felt for us, and, up to the present time, so far as
has lain within your power, have borne with us, never departing from
your own natural forbearance from any alarm caused by superior
authority.  Now of the whole sum there is still something wanting, and
that must be got in from the contribution which we have recommended to
all the town.  What I ask is, that you will grant us a little delay,
that a reminder may be sent to dwellers in the country, and most of our
magistrates are in the country.  If it is possible for it to be sent in
short of as many pounds as those in which we are still behind-hand, I
should be glad if you would so arrange, and the amount shall be sent
later.  If, however, it is absolutely necessary that the whole sum
should be sent in at once, then I repeat my first request that we may be
allowed a longer time of grace.

id="ix.lxxxix-p5.1"></span>χρυσίον πραγματευτικόν</span>, Lat. *aurum
comparatitium*.  The gold collected for the equipment of troops.  *Cod.
Theod*. vii. 6. 3.  The provinces of the East, with the exception of
Osroene and Isauria, contributed gold instead of actual equipment.  The
Ben. note quotes a law of Valens that this was to be paid between Sept.
1 and April 1, and argues thence that this letter may be definitely
dated in March, 372, and not long before Easter, which fell on April 8.
