id="ix.xcvii-p1.1"></span>Letter XCVI. <span

<span id="ix.xcvii-p3"></span>*To Sophronius, the master*. <span

<span id="ix.xcvii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xcvii-p5.1"></span>Who</span> ever loved his city, honouring with
filial love the place which gave him birth <span id="page_181">p.
181</span> <span id="ix.xcvii-Page_181"></span>and nurture, as you do;
praying for the whole city together, and for every one in it
individually, and not merely praying but confirming your prayers by your
own means?  For this you are able to effect by God’s help, and long,
good man that you are, may you be able so to do.  Nevertheless in your
time our city has enjoyed but a brief dream of prosperity, in being
committed to the charge of one the like of whom, according to the
students of our oldest annals, never sat in the præfectorial chair.  But
now the city has suddenly lost his services, through the wickedness of
men who have found a ground of attack in his very liberality and
impartiality, and, without the knowledge of your excellency, have made
up calumnies against him.  There is therefore universal depression among
us at the loss of a governor with unique capacity for raising our
dejected community, a true guardian of justice, accessible to the
wronged, a terror to law breakers, of like behaviour to rich and poor,
and, what is most important, one who has restored the interests of
Christians to their old place of honour.  That he was, of all men that I
know, the most incapable of being bribed, and never did any one an
unfair favour, I have passed by as a small point in comparison with his
other virtues.  I am indeed testifying to all this too late, like men
who sing dirges to console themselves when they can get no practical
relief.  Yet, it is not useless that his memory should remain in your
generous heart, and that you should be grateful to him as a benefactor
of your native place.  Should any of those who feel a grudge against
him, for not sacrificing justice to their interests, attack him, it will
be well for you to defend and protect him.  Thus you will make it clear
to all that you count his interests yours, and think it quite a
sufficient reason for this your close association with him that his
record should be so unimpeachable, and his administration so remarkable
in view of the time.  For what any other man would not be able to affect
in many years has been quickly accomplished by him.  It will be a great
favour to me, and a comfort under the circumstances, if you will
recommend him to the Emperor, and dispel the calumnious charges brought
against him.  Believe me that I am speaking here not for myself alone,
but for the whole community, and that it is our unanimous prayer that he
may reap some benefit from your excellency’s aid.
