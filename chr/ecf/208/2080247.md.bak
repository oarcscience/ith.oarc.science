<span id="ix.clxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.clxxv-p1.1"></span>Letter CLXXIV. <span
id="fr_2573"></span>[2574](#fn_2573.md) </span>

<span id="ix.clxxv-p3"></span>*To a Widow*.

<span id="ix.clxxv-p4"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxxv-p4.1"></span>have</span> been most wishful to write
constantly to your excellency, but I have from time to time denied
myself, for fear of causing any temptation to beset you, because of
those who are ill disposed toward me.  As I am told, their hatred has
even gone so far that they make a fuss if any one happens to receive a
letter from me.  But now that you have begun to write yourself, and very
good it is of you to do so, sending me needful information about all
that is in your mind, I am stirred to write back to you.  Let me then
set right what has been omitted in the past, and at the same time reply
to what <span id="page_220">p. 220</span> <span
id="ix.clxxv-Page_220"></span>your excellency has written.  Truly
blessed is the soul, which by night and by day has no other anxiety than
how, when the great day comes wherein all creation shall stand before
the Judge and shall give an account for its deeds, she too may be able
easily to get quit of the reckoning of life.

<span id="ix.clxxv-p5"></span>For he who keeps that day and that hour
ever before him, and is ever meditating upon the defence to be made
before the tribunal where no excuses will avail, will sin not at all, or
not seriously, for we begin to sin when there is a lack of the fear of
God in us.  When men have a clear apprehension of what is threatened
them, the awe inherent in them will never allow them to fall into
inconsiderate action or thought.  Be mindful therefore of God.  Keep the
fear of Him in your heart, and enlist all men to join with you in your
prayers, for great is the aid of them that are able to move God by their
importunity.  Never cease to do this.  Even while we are living this
life in the flesh, prayer will be a mighty helper to us, and when we are
departing hence it will be a sufficient provision for us on the journey
to the world to come. <span id="fr_2574"></span>[2575](#fn_2574.md)

<span id="ix.clxxv-p7"></span>Anxiety is a good thing; but, on the other
hand, despondency, dejection, and despair of our salvation, are
injurious to the soul.  Trust therefore in the goodness of God, and look
for His succour, knowing that if we turn to Him rightly and sincerely,
not only will He not cast us off forever, but will say to us, even while
we are in the act of uttering the words of our prayer, “Lo! I am with
you.”
