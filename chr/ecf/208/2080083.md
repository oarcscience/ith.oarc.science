When the men who devote themselves to this craft have caught one, they
tame it, and make it feed with them.  Then they smear its wings with
sweet oil, and let it go and join the rest outside.  Then the scent of
that sweet oil makes the free flock the possession of the owner of the
tame bird, for all the rest are attracted by the fragrance, and settle

the house.  But why do I begin my letter thus?  Because I have taken
your son Dionysius, once Diomedes, <span
id="fr_1884"></span>[1885](#fn_1884) and anointed the wings of his soul
with the sweet all of God, and sent him to you that you may take flight
with him, and make for the nest which he has built under my roof.  If I
live to see this, and you, my honoured friend, translated to our lofty
life, I shall require many persons worthy of God to pay Him all the
honour that is His due.

after giving reasons why the name Julitta should not be introduced into
the address, continues:  “*neque etiam in hac et pluribus aliis Basilii
epistolis* <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xi-p4.2"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xi-p4.3"></span>λευθέρα</span> *nomen proprium est, sed viduam

est viduam, apellat Simpliciam quam ipsius quondam conjugem fuisse

<span id="ix.xi-p6"></span> A second name was given at baptism, or
assumed with some religious motive.  In the first three centuries
considerations of prudence would prevent an advertisement of
Christianity through a name of peculiar meaning, and even baptismal
names were not biblical or of pious meaning and association.  Later the
early indifference of Christians as to the character of their names
ceased, and after the fourth century heathen names were discouraged. 
*cf*. D.C.A. ii. 1368.  “Dionysius,” though of pagan origin, is
biblical; but “martyrs often encountered death bearing the names of
these very divinities to whom they refuse to offer sacrifice.”  So we
have Apollinarius, Hermias, Demetrius, Origenes (sprung from Horus),
Arius, Athenodorus, Aphrodisius, and many more.
