<span id="ix.xcvi-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.xcvi-p1.1"></span>Letter XCV. <span
id="fr_2335"></span>[2336](#fn_2335.md) </span>

<span id="ix.xcvi-p3"></span>*To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata*.

<span id="ix.xcvi-p4"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xcvi-p4.1"></span>had</span> written some while since to your
reverence about our meeting one another and other subjects, but I was
disappointed at my letter not reaching your excellency, for after the
blessed deacon Theophrastus had taken charge of the letter, on my
setting out on an unavoidable journey, he did not convey it to your
reverence, because he was seized by the sickness of which he died. 
Hence it happened that I was so late in writing, that, the time being
now so exceedingly short, I did not look for there being much use in
this letter.  The godly bishop Meletius and Theodotus had strongly urged
me to visit them, representing that a meeting would be a proof of
affection, and being wishful of remedying the troubles which are at
present a cause of anxiety. <span id="fr_2336"></span>[2337](#fn_2336.md)  
They had appointed, as a time for our meeting, the middle of the
approaching month of June, and for the place, Phargamus, a spot famous
for martyr’s glory and for the large number of people attending the
synod there every year.  Directly I returned and heard of the death of
the blessed deacon, and that my letter was lying useless at home, I felt
that I must not be idle, because thirty-three days were still remaining
up to the appointed time, and so I hurriedly sent the letter to the very
reverend Eustathius, my fellow minister, with the object of its being
sent on by him to your reverence and of getting an answer without
delay.  If, then, it is possible and agreeable to you to come, I will
come too.  If not, I, God willing, will pay the debt of meeting due from
last year:  unless haply some hindrance for my sins comes in the way
again, in which case I must put off my meeting with the bishops to
another time.
