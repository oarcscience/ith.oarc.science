id="ix.cclxxi-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLXX. <span
id="fr_3220"></span>[3221](#fn_3220) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxxi-p3"></span>*Without Address.  Concerning
Raptus.* <span id="fr_3221"></span>[3222](#fn_3221)

<span id="ix.cclxxi-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxxi-p5.1"></span>I am</span> distressed to find that you are
by no means indignant at the sins forbidden, and that you seem incapable
of understanding, how this *raptus*, which has been committed, is an act
of unlawfulness and tyranny against society and human nature, and an
outrage on free men.  I am sure that if you had all been of one mind in
this matter, there would have been nothing to prevent this bad custom
from being long ago driven out of your country.  Do thou at the present
time shew the zeal of a Christian man, and be moved as the wrong
deserves.  Wherever you find the girl, insist on taking her away, and
restore her to her parents, shut out the man from the prayers, and make
him excommunicate.  His accomplices, according to the canon <span
id="fr_3222"></span>[3223](#fn_3222) which I have already put forth, cut
off, with all their household, from the prayers.  The village which
received the girl after the abduction, and kept her, or even fought
against her restitution, shut out with all its inhabitants from the
prayers; to the end that all may know that we regard the ravisher as a
common foe, like a snake or any other wild beast, and so hunt him out,
and help those whom he has wronged.

<span id="ix.cclxxi-p4"></span> On this subject see before *Letters*
cxcix. and ccxvii. pp. 238 and 256.  See Preb. Meyrick in *D.C.A.* ii.
1102:  “It means not exactly the same as our word ravishment, but the
violent removal of a woman to a place where her actions are no longer
free, for the sake of inducing her or compelling her to marry.…By some
*raptus* is distinguished into the two classes of *raptus seductionis*
and *raptus violentiæ*.”  *cf*. *Cod. Theod*. ix. *tit*. xxiv. *legg*.
1, 2, and *Cod. Justin*. ix.–xiii. *leg*. 1 *Corp. Juris*. ii. 832.

right in understanding the word not to refer to any decree on this
particular case, but to Basil’s general rule in Canon xxx.  *cf*. p.
