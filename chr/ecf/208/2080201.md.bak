<span id="ix.cxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cxxix-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXVIII. <span
id="fr_2421"></span>[2422](#fn_2421.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cxxix-p3"></span>*To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata*. <span
id="fr_2422"></span>[2423](#fn_2422.md)

<span id="ix.cxxix-p5"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxxix-p5.1"></span>Hitherto</span> I have been unable to give any
adequate and practical proof of my earnest desire to pacify the Churches
of the Lord.  But in my heart I affirm that I have so great a longing,
that I would gladly give up even my life, if thereby the flame of
hatred, kindled by the evil one, could be put out.  If it was not for
the sake of this longing for peace that I consented to come to
Colonia, <span id="fr_2423"></span>[2424](#fn_2423.md) may my life be
unblessed by peace.  The peace I seek is the true peace, left us by the
Lord Himself; and what I have asked that I may have for my assurance
belongs to one who desires nothing but the true peace, <span
id="page_197">p. 197</span> <span id="ix.cxxix-Page_197"></span>although
some perversely interpret the truth into another sense.  Let them use
their tongues as they will, but assuredly they will one day be sorry for
their words.

<span id="ix.cxxix-p7"></span>2.  Now I beseech your holiness to
remember the original propositions, and not to be led away by receiving
answers that do not fit the questions, nor yet to give practical weight
to the quibbles of men who, without any power of argument, very cleverly
pervert the truth, from their own ideas alone.  I set out propositions
which were perfectly simple, clear and easy to remember; do we decline
to receive into communion those who refuse to accept the Nicene Creed? 
Do we refuse to have part or lot with those who have the hardihood to
assert that the Holy Ghost is a creature?  He, however, <span
id="fr_2424"></span>[2425](#fn_2424.md) instead of answering my questions
word for word, has concocted the statement which you have sent me:—and
this not from simplemindedness, as might be imagined, nor yet from his
inability to see the consequences.  What he reckons is that, by
repudiating my proposition, he will expose his true character to the
people; while, if he agrees to it, he will depart from that *via media*
which has hitherto seemed to him preferable to any other position.  Let
him not try to beguile me, nor, with the rest, deceive your
intelligence.  Let him send a concise answer to my question, whether he
accepts or repudiates communion with the enemies of the faith.  If you
get him to do this and send me such a distinct answer as I pray for, I
own myself in error in all that has gone before; I take all the blame
upon myself; then ask from me a proof of humility.  But, if nothing of
the kind come to pass, pardon me, most God-beloved father, in my
inability to approach God’s altar with hypocrisy.  Were it not for this
dread, why should I separate myself from Euippius, so learned a man, so
advanced in age, and bound to me by so many ties of affection?  If,
however, in this case I acted rightly, it would, I am sure, be absurd to
appear united with those who maintain the same views as Euippius,
through the mediation of these amiable and charming persons.

<span id="ix.cxxix-p9"></span>3.  Not that I think it is absolutely our
duty to cut ourselves off from those who do not receive the faith, but
rather to have regard to them in accordance with the old law of love,
and to write to them with one consent, giving them all exhortation with
pity, and to propose to them the faith of the fathers, and invite them
to union.  If we succeed we should be united in communion with them; if
we fail we must be content with one another and purge our conduct of
this uncertain spirit, restoring the evangelical and simple conversation
followed by those who accepted the Word from the beginning.  “They,” it
is said, “were of one heart and of one soul.” <span
id="fr_2425"></span>[2426](#fn_2425.md)   If they obey you, this will be
best; if not, recognise the real authors of the war, and, for the future
do not write me any more letters about reconciliation.
